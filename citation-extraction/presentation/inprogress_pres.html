# Extracting Citations from Government Reports

---

# Agenda

1. Introduction

2. Results so far

3. Future work

---

# Introduction

* How do we measure impact of scientific research on government policy?

* Look at what they cite.

---

# Regulator Impact Analysis

* Each new government regulation has an associated RIA.

* RIAs detail the potential effects of a new regulation.

* Assess how scientific research is used by seeing what RIAs cite.

---

# Current Data Collection Process

* Byzantine.

* Undergraduate coders read RIAs and put info into a database.

---

# Proposed Process

* Use existing citation indexing software to extract citations.

* ParsCit - used by CiteSeerX project.

---

# How well does ParsCit do?

* Tested on hand-coded set of 104 RIAs.

* Across all citation types, accuracy rate of about 30% compared to hand-collected sample.

* About 50% for scholarly citations.

---

# Future Work

* Look at improving ParsCit for RIAs.

* Improve flow of metadata coding using DOIs.
