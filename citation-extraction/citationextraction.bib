abstract = "Abstract This study established a technological impact factor (TIF) derived from journal impact factor (JIF), which is proposed to evaluate journals from the aspect of practical innovation. This impact factor mainly examines the influence of journal articles on patents by calculating the number of patents cited to a journal divided by the number of articles published in that particular journal. The values of \{TIF\} for five-year (TIF5) and ten-year (TIF10) periods at the journal level and aggregated \{TIF\} values (TIFAGG_5 and TIFAGG_10) at the category level were provided and compared to the JIF. The results reveal that journals with higher \{TIF\} values showed varied performances in the JCR, while the top ten journals on \{JIF5\} showed consistent good performance in TIFs. Journals in three selected categories Ð Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering, Research &amp; Experimental Medicine, and Organic Chemistry Ð showed that \{TIF5\} and \{TIF10\} values are not strongly correlated with JIF5. Thus, \{TIFs\} can provide a new indicator for evaluating journals from the aspect of practical innovation. "

abstract = "Abstract This study aims to explore the relationship between science and technology via analyzing cross citations between papers and patents in fuel cells. To calculate cross citation indicators, papers were retrieved from the \{WOS\} database and patent data from the \{USPTO\} during the period between 1991 and 2010, resulting in a total of 20,758 papers and 8112 patents. This study shows that there is a gradually increasing convergence between science and technology, particularly of science linkage in recent years. Papers citing patents are more time-sensitive than patents citing papers. Academic institutions are more likely to cite papers and patents published by other academic institutions. "

abstract = "Abstract By empirical demonstration, this study extends the assessments of \{BRICS\} countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in performing science and technology in previous studies by exploring their cumulative patterns of science and technology (proxied by publications and patents respectively). Projections of cumulative production in science and technology are made using logistic growth function. Our analyses show that Ð though having different growth trajectories in science production Ð the \{BRICS\} countries exhibit similar patterns in pursuing technology. This embodies the strong commitment of \{BRICS\} to improve their technological capabilities in the process of industrial development. Inspired by the Relative Impact Index (RII) proposed by Nesta and Patel, we propose the Relative Science Impact Index (RSII) to evaluate the relative impact of science and technology on the process of technological catching-up in emerging economies and examine the co-evolution between science-based patents and patent citations. Our correlation analysis between forward citation and \{RSII\} marks some distinctive pursuits of \{BRICS\} countries in science-based patenting activities. "
