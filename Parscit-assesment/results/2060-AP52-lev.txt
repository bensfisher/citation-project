(1) Operating and capital costs: Using the IPM parsed outputs for the base case and the proposed Toxics Rule policy case, EPA identified units that installed one or more pollution control technologies under the proposed rule. The equations for calculating operating and capital costs were adopted from technology assumptions used in EPA‘s version of IPM (version 4.10). The model calculates the capital cost (in $/MW); the fixed operation and maintenance (O&M) cost (in $/MW-year); and the variable O&M cost (in $/MWh).	1.4) Description of Significant Alternatives As required by RFA section 609(b), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act (SBREFA), EPA conducted outreach to small entities and convened a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) Panel (composed of EPA, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)) to obtain the advice and recommendations of small entity representatives (SERs) that potentially would be subject to the requirements of the proposed Toxics Rule. The outreach consisted of meeting with some organizations that represent and include small entities in their membership, including the American Public Power Association (APPA),	Lung Cancer, Cardiopulmonary Mortality, and Long-term Exposure to Fine Particulate Air Pollution.‖	Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
