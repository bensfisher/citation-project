The benefit values presented in this table are the estimated ‚Äúmean‚Äù values. Additional ‚Äúlow‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù value estimates are presented in Chapter 11 of the EEBA. b. Total Social Costs include compliance costs to facilities and government administrative costs.	a. Options are presented in order of increasing stringency. b. Net benefits are calculated by subtracting total annualized costs from total annual benefits. c. Incremental net benefits are equal to the difference between net benefits of an option and net benefits of the previous, less stringent option.

At a 3 percent discount rate, total annual social costs are $326.55 million; at a 7 percent discount rate, these costs are $383.10 million.

Table 13-6 also reports the discounted present value and annualized value of benefits and costs Source: U.S. EPA Analysis,	13.3.3 Analysis Impact on Small Governments As presented in Table 13-9, costs are lower for small governments in comparison to large governments in the aggregate, and approximately the same on a per facility basis. Under Option 1, the 10 facilities owned by small 224 Maximum per facility values are reported on an unweighted basis.	Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 13: Cost and Economic Impact of Additional Option	13.3.4 Analysis Summary Table 13-10 presents a summary of compliance costs under Option 4 for publicly- and privately-owned facilities, along with government administrative costs, for each regulatory option.	For Option 4, EPA estimates total annual compliance costs for government-owned Electric Generators at $9.5 million. NPDES permitting authorities are expected to incur another $3.2 million per year to implement this option for both Electric Generators and Manufacturers, resulting in a total annual cost of approximately $12.7 million for State and local governments. The maximum compliance cost for government-owned Electric Generators in any one year under Option 4 is $17.6 million in 2033. The maximum administrative cost to NPDES authorities in any single year for administering this option is $4.0	Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 13: Cost and Economic Impact of Additional Option	13.4 Cost and Economic Impact Analysis ‚Äì Manufacturers a.

Thus, this option would have no material impact on small Manufacturers entities.
