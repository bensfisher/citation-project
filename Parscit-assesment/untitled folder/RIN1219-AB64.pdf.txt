I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

INTRODUCTION 

The proposed rule would lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust by revising 

the Mine Safety and Health Administration’s (MSHA) existing standards on miners’ 
occupational exposure to respirable coal mine dust.  The major provisions of the proposed rule 
would lower the existing exposure limit from 2.0 mg/m3 to 1.0 mg/m3 over a two-year phase-in 
period; provide for full-shift sampling; redefine the term “normal production shift;” and add 
reexamination and decertification requirements for persons certified to sample, and maintain and 
calibrate sampling devices.  In addition, the proposed rule would provide for single shift 
compliance sampling (single sample) under the mine operator and MSHA’s inspector sampling 
programs, and would establish sampling requirements for use of the Continuous Personal Dust 
Monitor (CPDM) and expanded requirements for medical surveillance. 

BACKGROUND 

MSHA’s existing standards require coal mine operators to continuously maintain the 

average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner is exposed during each shift at or 
below 2.0 mg/m3.  Miners who have evidence of pneumoconiosis and are employed at 
underground coal mines or surface work areas of underground coal mines have the option to 
work in areas where average respirable dust concentrations do not exceed 1.0 mg/m3.  There is 
not a separate standard for respirable silica; rather, where the total respirable coal mine dust 
contains more than five percent quartz, the respirable coal mine dust standard is computed by 
dividing the percentage of quartz into the number ten.  This formula was designed to limit a 
miner’s exposure to respirable quartz by reducing the amount of respirable quartz in the air to 
0.1 mg/m3 (100 µg mg/m3).  For example, if the coal mine dust were 10 percent quartz, the 
formula would result in a reduced respirable dust standard of 1.0 mg/m3 (Note: 10% of 
1.0 mg/m3 is 0.1 mg/m3.) 

Under MSHA’s existing standards, compliance determinations are based on the average 

concentration of respirable dust measured by five valid respirable dust samples taken by the 
operator during five consecutive normal production shifts or five normal production shifts 
worked on consecutive days.  Underground coal operators are required to collect bimonthly 
respirable dust samples and submit them to MSHA for analysis to determine compliance with 
applicable respirable dust standards.  If compliance samples do not meet the requirements of the 
applicable dust standard, MSHA issues a citation for a violation of the standard.  Similarly, 
operators of surface work areas of underground coal mines and surface coal mines are required 
to collect bimonthly samples from “designated work positions” (DWPs) designated by the 
District Manager. 

Compliance determinations are also based on the average of multiple measurements 

taken by an MSHA inspector over a single shift (multiple, single-shift samples) or on the average 
of multiple measurements obtained for the same occupations on successive days (multiple-shift 
samples).

MINING SECTORS COVERED BY THE PROPOSED RULE 

The proposed rule would apply to all underground and surface coal mines in the 
United States.  The average number of active underground coal mines for the 12 months 
ending January 2010, was 424.  These mines employed approximately 47,000 miners and 
contractors (excluding office workers).  The average number of active surface coal mines 
for the 12 months ending January 2010, was 1,123.  These mines employed 
approximately 32,300 miners (excluding office workers). 

SUMMARY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROPOSED RULE 
 

The proposed rule would: 

•  For underground and surface coal mines, lower the limit from 2.0 mg/m3 to 

1.0 mg/m3 over an 8-hour shift, over a 24-month phase in period.  Also, for intake 
air and for Part 90 miners, lower the limit from 1.0 mg/m3 to 0.5 mg/m3 over a 
6-month phase in period. 

•  Over an 18-month period, phase in the use of the CPDM, a new technology that 
provides a direct, real-time measurement of respirable coal mine dust.  Operators 
would use CPDMs to monitor underground miners in occupations exposed to the 
highest dust concentrations and miners who have evidence of pneumoconiosis, 
every day for the full shift.  Use of the CPDM would be optional for surface 
miners and for underground miners in non-production areas (such as outby areas).  
The CPDM stores data that would be electronically sent to MSHA. 

•  Require that single, full-shift samples, collected by the Agency or the operator, be 

used to determine noncompliance with MSHA’s dust standards. 

•  Require dust samples to include the entire time the miner works, rather than a 

maximum of 8 hours required by the existing standard. 

•  Change the existing definition of normal production shift, which requires operator 

sampling at 50 percent of production, to a more reliable representation of the 
operator’s actual production, which would be based on the last 30 production 
shifts. 

•  Extend the existing x-ray surveillance program for underground coal miners to 

surface miners.  Also, add a new examination for Spirometry, occupational 
history, and symptom assessment. 

BENEFITS 

The proposed rule would significantly improve health protections for coal miners by 

reducing their occupational exposure to respirable coal mine dust and lowering the risk that they 
will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity over their working lives. 

To estimate the benefits of the proposed rule, MSHA’s QRA compared the risks for two 

hypothetical cohorts of miners with the same occupation/coal rank distribution.  The cohort 
designed to characterize risks to current workforce was assigned 45-year life-time exposures 
based on current monitoring data.  The comparison cohort was assigned 45-year life-time 
exposures designed to represent risks associated with two provisions of the proposed rule (i.e., 

 

2

lowering the limit from 2.0 mg/m3 to 1.0 mg/m3 and basing determinations of noncompliance on 
single samples rather than the average of 5 samples).  Since the two cohorts being compared are 
independent, it is important to note two important caveats: 1) no benefits were projected for 
slowing or stopping the progression of disease among the population that has experienced 
current (or historical) exposures during their working lifetime; and 2) due to the latency between 
exposure and disease, especially for such endpoints as severe emphysema, a large portion of the 
benefits estimated by this analysis would not be expected to accrue for many years into the 
future.  

In summary, MSHA estimates that over a 45-year working lifetime two provisions of the 
proposed rule (i.e., lowering the limit from 2.0 mg/m3 to 1.0 mg/m3 and basing determinations of 
noncompliance on single samples rather than the average of 5 samples) would prevent:  
1,301 cases of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP 1+); 985 cases of CWP 2+; 641 cases of 
progressive massive fibrosis (PMF); 556 cases of severe emphysema; and 106 deaths from 
non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD).  MSHA projects that there would be additional 
reductions in cases of CWP, PMF, severe emphysema, and NMRD resulting from other proposed 
changes.  If the proposed requirement for full-shift sampling and the proposed definition of 
normal production shift had been in effect in 2009, the amount of dust on the samples would 
have been higher because of the longer time and the higher levels of production.  Lowering 
exposures from these higher levels to the levels being proposed would result in additional 
benefits beyond those associated with the actual recorded sampling results.   MSHA used 
additional data from the feasibility assessment to extrapolate the further impact of these two 
provisions.  The results suggest an increase in the number of cases prevented to: 1,607 cases of 
CWP 1+; 1,216 cases of CWP 2+; 791 cases of PMF; 687cases of severe emphysema; and 
131 deaths from non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD).    

MSHA did not quantify the benefits associated with several provisions of the 
proposed rule (e.g., sampling the designated occupations (DOs) and Part 90 miners on 
every production shift using the CPDM, periodic examinations, expanding the Part 90 
option to surface miners).  MSHA also projects that there would be reductions in cases of 
other adverse health effects that result from exposure to respirable coal mine dust, such as 
silicosis and chronic bronchitis, which the Agency has not quantified.   

To estimate the monetary values of the reductions in cases of CWP1+, CWP2+, PMF, 

severe emphysema and deaths from NMRD, MSHA performed an analysis of the imputed value 
of illnesses and fatalities avoided based on a willingness-to-pay approach. This approach relies 
on the theory of compensating wage differentials (i.e., the wage premium paid to workers to 
accept the risk associated with various jobs) in the labor market.  MSHA estimates that the 
proposed rule would result in a low of $99 to $197 million in benefits over a 45-year working 
lifetime. 

When estimating the annual benefits it is necessary to take into account the timing of 

when the health benefits accrue.  However, gauging the timing of reductions in chronic diseases 
that may not develop until years after initial exposure, and whose progression may not be 
instantly stopped even if exposure were completely eliminated, is quite difficult.  MSHA did not 
have the data necessary to project the timing of CWP and related diseases.  Furthermore, MSHA 
does not have data on the historical exposures of the current workforce of coal miners; they have 
already been exposed to various levels of respirable coal mine dust and some lung damage has 
invariably already been done.

See Chapter III of this analysis for a detailed explanation of the benefits of the proposed 

rule. 

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY 

To meet the requirements of the proposed rule, operators would have to develop 
and follow well-designed dust control plans, train miners and certified persons, monitor 
concentrations of respirable coal mine dust over a full work shift using approved 
sampling devices, take corrective actions in the case of overexposures, report sampling 
results and plan changes to MSHA and the miners’ representative, and conduct medical 
surveillance.   

Sampling data indicate that not only are mine operators keeping miners’ 

exposures at or below the levels required under the existing standards, but dust exposures 
at most operations average less than the proposed standard of 1.0 mg/m³.  The majority of 
miners’ exposures are at or below the limits in the proposed rule when sampling is 
conducted under the requirements of the existing standard.  MSHA understands that these 
data reflect measurements under the existing sampling program and that requirements 
under the proposed rule (e.g., use of single full-shift samples to determine 
noncompliance, change in the definition of normal production shift) would result in 
higher measured exposures compared to the existing sampling program.  However, 
existing engineering controls including ventilation, sprays and environmentally 
controlled cabs along with changes in work practices can be used to further reduce dust 
levels.   MSHA acknowledges that in rare instances, some operators, after taking these 
actions, may encounter implementation issues as they attempt to comply with the 
proposed requirements and need to take additional measures to comply with the proposed 
standard. However, MSHA believes with the two-year phase-in period to allow mine 
operators time to come into compliance with the proposed 1.0 mg/m³ standard all coal 
mines will have sufficient time to either upgrade existing controls or to install additional 
measures to meet the proposed requirements. 
 
monitoring technology, the CPDM.  The CPDM provides real-time information on 
respirable coal mine dust (respirable dust) levels to which miners are exposed.  The 
proposal would require the operator to use the CPDM to sample certain underground 
occupations, after a 12- or 18-month phase-in period, unless notified by the Secretary.  
MSHA believes that the proposed phase-in periods would allow manufacturers enough 
time to produce the necessary quantity of CPDMs, and MSHA and operators enough time 
to train necessary personnel in the use and care of the device. 
   
of the proposed rule. 

The proposed rule would also require implementation of new and improved dust

COST SUMMARY 

MSHA estimates that the first year cost of the proposed rule would be 

approximately $72.4 to $93.2 million and the annualized cost of the proposed rule would 
be approximately $40.4 to $44.5 million. 

 

4

The estimated first year costs of the proposed rule for underground coal mine 
operators would be approximately $63.6 to $84.4 million.  Costs associated with the 
proposed requirement to use CPDMs ($51.5 million) and upgrading and maintaining 
existing engineering controls and work practices ($12.6 to $33.4 million) represent the 
most significant first year costs for underground coal operators. 

The first year costs of the proposed rule for surface coal mine operators would be 

approximately $8.8 million.  The proposed expansion of the Part 90 transfer option to 
surface miners represents the most significant first year cost for surface operators. 

MSHA estimates that at a 7% discount rate, the annualized costs of the proposed 
rule for underground coal mine operators would be approximately $35.6 to 39.7 million.  
Costs associated with the proposed requirement to use CPDMs ($24.8 million) and  
upgrading and maintaining existing engineering controls and work practices ($5.1 to 9.1 
million) represent the most significant annualized costs for underground coal operators. 
MSHA estimates that at a 7% discount rate, the annualized costs of the proposed 

rule for surface coal operators would be approximately $4.8million.  Costs associated 
with the proposed expansion of the Part 90 transfer option to surface miners ($1.9 
million) represent 40 percent of the total annualized costs for surface operators. 
For a detailed explanation of the estimated costs of the proposed rule see 

Chapter V of this analysis. 

ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY 

MSHA has traditionally used a revenue screening test—whether the annualized 

compliance costs of a regulation are less than 1 percent of revenues, or are negative (i.e., 
provide net cost savings)—to establish presumptively that compliance with the regulation 
is economically feasible for the mining industry.  Based upon this test, MSHA has 
concluded that the requirements of the proposed rule are economically feasible since the 
estimated compliance costs for both underground and surface coal mines are below one 
percent of their estimated annual revenue. 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866 AND THE REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT 

Executive Order 12866 requires that regulatory agencies assess the costs and benefits of 

intended regulations.  MSHA has fulfilled this requirement for the proposed rule and based on its 
analysis of compliance costs, the Agency has determined that the proposed rule is not an 
economically significant regulatory action in terms of compliance costs under §3(f)(1) of 
Executive Order 12866.  However, benefit effects of the proposed rule are likely to exceed $100 
million and would be economically significant in terms of benefits. 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory 

Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), requires regulatory agencies to consider a rule’s economic 
impact on small entities.  For rulemaking purposes, the Agency has traditionally defined a small 
mine to be one employing 1-19 employees and a large mine to be one employing 20 or more 
employees.  However, to comply with the requirements of the SBREFA amendments to the 
RFA, MSHA also uses Small Business Administration’s (SBA) definition for a small entity 
when determining a rule’s economic impact.  For the mining industry, SBA defines a small mine 
as one with 1-500 employees and a large mine as one with more than 500 employees. 

 

5

In accordance with § 605 of the RFA, MSHA certifies that the proposed rule does not 
have a significant economic compliance cost impact on a substantial number of small entities.  
Under the SBREFA amendments to the RFA, MSHA must include in the proposed rule a factual 
basis for this certification.  The analysis that provides the factual basis for this certification is 
discussed in Chapter VI of this document and in the preamble to the proposed rule published in 
the Federal Register.  MSHA has consulted with the SBA’s Office of Advocacy and believes 
that the analysis provides a reasonable basis for this certification. 
NET BENEFITS 

This section presents a summary of estimated benefits and costs of the proposed 
rule for informational purposes only. Under the Mine Act, MSHA is not required to use 
estimated net benefits as the basis for its decision.  MSHA’s estimates suggest, however, 
that net benefits are positive, with estimated annualized benefits ranging from $99 to 
$197 million and estimated annualized costs ranging from $40 to $44 million.  The 
estimates of costs and benefits are only roughly comparable due to both limitations in the 
data and different underlying assumptions.

II. INDUSTRY PROFILE 

 

INTRODUCTION 

This chapter provides information concerning the structure and economic characteristics 
of the coal mining industry, including the number and type of mines and employees by type and 
size of mine.  The source of these preliminary data is the U.S. Department of Labor, MSHA’s 
Office of Program Evaluation and Information Resources (PEIR). 

STRUCTURE OF THE MINING INDUSTRY 

MSHA divides the mining industry into two major sectors based on commodity:  (1) coal 

mines and (2) metal and nonmetal mines.  Each sector is further divided by type of operation 
(e.g., underground mines or surface mines).  The Agency maintains data on the number of mines 
and on mining employment by mine type and size.  MSHA also collects data on the number of 
independent contractor firms and their employees.  Each independent contractor is issued one 
MSHA contractor identification number but may work at any mine. 
 

STRUCTURE OF THE UNDERGROUND COAL MINING INDUSTRY 

The average number of   active underground coal mines for 12 months ending January 
2010, was 424.  These mines employed 47,204 miners, excluding office workers.  As of May 
2010, there were 232 underground coal mine contractor firms with 6,685 employees, excluding 
office workers.  Table II-1 presents the number of underground coal mines and miners, by size of 
mine.

STRUCTURE OF THE SURFACE COAL MINING INDUSTRY 

The average number of   active surface coal mines for the 12 month ending January 2010, 

was 1,123.  These mines employed 56,067 miners, excluding office workers.  As of May 2010, 
there were 2,431 surface coal mine contractor firms.  These 2,431 firms had 23,817 employees, 
excluding office workers.  Table II-3 presents the number of surface coal mines and miners, by

ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COAL MINING INDUSTRY 

The estimated value of coal produced in U.S. underground coal mines in 2009 was 

$17 billion.  The average open market U.S. sales price of underground coal for 2008 was $51.35 
per short ton.  The estimated value of coal produced in U.S. surface coal mines for 2009 was 
$16.6 billion.  The average open market U.S. sales price of surface coal for 2008 was $22.35 per 
short ton.  The price per short ton for underground and surface coal is from the Department of 
Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA), Annual Coal Report 2008, October 
2009, Table 28.

MSHA classifies the U.S. coal mining sector into three major commodity groups: 

bituminous, lignite, and anthracite.1  Bituminous operations represent approximately 97% of coal 
mining operations and approximately 99% of coal miners and total coal production.  Anthracite 
operations represent approximately 2% of coal mining operations and less than 1% of coal 
miners and total coal production.  Lignite operations represent less than 1% of coal mining 
operations, coal miners, and total coal production. 

The U.S. surface coal sector produced an estimated 742.5 million short tons in 2009.    

The average price of coal in surface mines in 2008 was $22.35 per short ton.  The U.S. 
underground coal sector produced an estimated 331.9 million short tons in 2009.  The average 
price of coal in underground mines in 2008 was $51.35 short per ton. Table II-4 presents the coal 
production and revenues for 2009.

INTRODUCTION 

III.  BENEFITS 

This section presents a summary of the adverse health effects from exposure to respirable 

coal mine dust; health risks under the existing standard; estimated health risks under the 
proposed standard; and the estimated benefits resulting from proposed changes to Part 70 
(underground coal mines), Part 71 (surface coal mines and surface work areas of underground 
coal mines), and Part 90 (coal miners who have evidence of the development of 
pneumoconiosis).  The proposed changes are designed to lower miners' exposures by:  phasing in 
reduced respirable coal mine dust standards; ensuring that sampling results more accurately 
represent conditions to which coal miners are exposed; providing for the use of a single, full-shift 
sample, by MSHA or the operator, to make compliance determinations; and phasing in the use of 
the continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM), a new sampling technology which provides real-
time exposure measurement. 
 
1.  Lower Standard:  Proposed §§ 70.100 and 71.100 would lower the standard over a 
period of 24 months from the existing 2.0 milligrams of respirable coal mine dust per 
cubic meter of air (mg/m3) for 8 hours to 1.0 mg/m3.  Proposed § 90.100 would lower the 
standard for Part 90 miners (i.e., miners who have evidence of the development of 
pneumoconiosis) from the existing 1.0 mg/m3 to 0.5 mg/m3 over a period of 6 months.  In 
addition, the proposed rule would lower the existing standards from 1.0 mg/m3 to 0.5 
mg/m3 over a period of 6 months for intake air and belt air courses. 
 
2.  Compliance Determinations Based on a Single Shift Sample:  Under proposed 
§ 72.800, MSHA would base a determination of non-compliance on a single, full-shift 
sample of respirable coal mine dust.  This compliance sampling strategy, applicable to 
both MSHA and the operator’s programs, would replace the existing method of issuing 
citations based on the average of multiple samples.  Averaging multiple measurements 
can mask overexposures by diluting a measurement of high dust exposure with lower 
measurements. 
 
3.  Compliance Determinations Based on Full-Shift Sampling:  Proposed §§ 70.201(e), 
71.201(b), and 90.201(b) would require that sampling devices be worn from portal to 
portal during the entire length of each sampled shift, so that the sample would account for 
all the time that a miner works.  For shifts longer than 8 hours, the measured 
concentration would be adjusted to an 8-hour exposure.  Under the existing standards, 
sampling devices are worn for a maximum of 8 hours. 
 
4.  Compliance Determinations Based on Normal Production:  Under proposed 
§ 70.201(i), MSHA would change the definition of “normal production shift” to reflect a 
more reliable representation of the operator’s actual production, as determined by the 
average over the 30 most recent production shifts.  The existing standards require 
sampling during production of at least 50 percent of average production.

5.  Use of the Continuous Personal Dust Monitor (CPDM):  The proposal would phase-in, 
over an 18-month period, the use of the CPDM for underground production miners and 
Part 90 miners.  Because all samples taken for compliance purposes with the approved 
coal mine dust personal sampler units must be transmitted to MSHA for processing, the 
results are not known for days after sampling.  If the results require the operator to take 
corrective action to reduce respirable coal mine dust concentrations, those efforts would 
affect only exposures on subsequent work shifts.  The CPDM would provide mine 
operators and miners with information about the actual dust levels in the workplace on a 
real-time basis.  This would permit mine management and miners to be proactive in 
taking corrective action during the shift to prevent overexposures by implementing 
appropriate measures to correct problems as they arise. 
 

To estimate the benefits of the proposed regulation MSHA’s QRA compared the risks for 
two hypothetical cohorts of miners with the same occupation/coal rank distribution.  The cohort 
designed to characterize risks to current workforce was assigned 45-year life-time exposures 
based on current monitoring data.  The comparison cohort was assigned 45-year life-time 
exposures designed to represent risks associated with two provisions of the proposed rule (i.e., 
lowering the limit from 2.0 mg/m3 to 1.0 mg/m3 and basing determinations of noncompliance on 
single samples rather than the average of 5 samples).  Since the two cohorts being compared are 
independent, it is important to note two important caveats: 1) no benefits were projected for 
slowing or stopping the progression of disease among the population that has experienced 
current (or historical) exposures during their working lifetime; and 2) due to the latency between 
exposure and disease, especially for such endpoints as severe emphysema, a large portion of the 
benefits estimated by this analysis would not be expected to accrue for many years into the 
future.  

In summary, MSHA estimates that over a 45-year working lifetime, two provisions of the 
proposed rule (i.e., lowering the limit from 2.0 mg/m3 to 1.0 mg/m3 and basing determinations of 
noncompliance on single samples rather than the average of 5 samples) would prevent:  
1,301 cases of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP 1+); 985 cases of CWP 2+; 641 cases of 
progressive massive fibrosis (PMF); 556 cases of severe emphysema; and 106 deaths from 
non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD).  MSHA projects that there would be additional 
reductions in cases of CWP, PMF, severe emphysema, and NMRD resulting from other proposed 
changes.  The proposed requirement for full-shift sampling and the proposed definition of normal 
production shift had been in effect in 2009, then the amount of dust on the samples would have 
been higher the because of the longer time and the higher levels of production.  Lowering 
exposures from these higher levels to the levels being proposed would result in additional 
benefits beyond those associated with the actual recorded sampling results.   MSHA used 
additional data from the feasibility assessment to extrapolate the further impact of these two 
provisions.  The results suggest an increase in the number of cases prevented to: 1,607 cases of 
CWP 1+; 1,216 cases of CWP 2+; 791 cases of PMF; 687cases of severe emphysema; and 
131 deaths from non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD).    

MSHA did not quantify the benefits associated with several provisions of the 
proposed rule (e.g., sampling the designated occupations (DOs) and Part 90 miners on 
every production shift using the CPDM, periodic examinations, expanding the Part 90 
option to surface miners).  MSHA also projects that there would be reductions in cases of 

 

11

other adverse health effects that result from exposure to respirable coal mine dust, such as 
silicosis and chronic bronchitis, which the Agency has not quantified.   

The basis for these estimates is presented below. 

ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO RESPIRABLE COAL 
MINE DUST 

 

Exposure to excessive levels of respirable coal mine dust, which includes quartz 

in varying proportions, imposes significant health risks on miners.  These include the 
following adverse health effects:  coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), progressive 
massive fibrosis (PMF), silicosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
(e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema).  Cumulative exposure to respirable coal mine dust 
is the main determinant in the development of both simple CWP and PMF, although 
other factors, such as the percentage of quartz in the respirable coal mine dust and the 
type of coal, also affect the risk of miners developing respiratory disease. 

 

Three documents that examined the program to control respirable coal mine dust 
in U.S. mines were MSHA’s Respirable Dust Task Group Report, the National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) Criteria Document on Occupational 
Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, and the Report of the Secretary of Labor's 
Advisory Committee on the Elimination of Pneumoconiosis Among Coal Mine Workers.  
While recognizing that significant progress had been made to reduce respirable coal mine 
dust levels in coal mines, these documents concluded that there are existing practices in 
the dust program that should be changed to provide miners with increased health 
protection.  This proposed rule would address many of the recommendations made in 
those documents.  The primary benefit of the proposed rule is the reduction of 
occupational lung disease among coal miners from improving the existing program to 
control respirable coal mine dust and quartz, and reducing miners’ exposure to these 
hazards. 

DETERMINING THE HEALTH RISKS OF EXPOSURE UNDER EXISTING 
EXPOSURE CONDITIONS AND APPROACH FOR DETERMINING 
COMPLIANCE 

In 2000 and 2003, MSHA conducted quantitative assessments of the health risks 

(referred to hereafter as QRAs) associated with exposures to respirable coal mine dust 
under the existing standard, and possible reductions in exposures under proposed rules at 
that time, including possible reductions in adverse health effects.  In 2010, the Agency 
conducted a new QRA, which was peer-reviewed by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration and NIOSH.  The 2010 QRA estimated the effects of the proposed 
lowering of the standard to 1.0 mg/m3 for most miners (0.5 mg/m3 for Part 90 miners) and 
the proposed use of single samples to determine noncompliance. 

 

Source of Exposure Data 

As was done in MSHA’s two previous QRAs, the Agency based its 2010 QRA on 
the existing exposures for the coal mining population.  MSHA primarily limited the data 

 

12

used for the 2010 QRA to valid samples taken by MSHA inspectors on the first day of 
sampling (Day-1 samples) to reduce biases that could result from using samples taken 
during subsequent days of multiple-day sampling when conditions might have been 
altered.  From a database of nearly 200,000 inspector samples in the MSHA Standardized 
Information System that were taken during the period 2004 – 2008, the Agency excluded 
approximately 18,000 samples that had been voided.  An additional 14,000 samples were 
removed because they were within 21 days of a prior inspection and they could not be 
considered to have come from independent inspections.  10,000 Day-1 intake air samples 
were excluded and 11,000 other Day-1 samples were removed because they could not be 
linked to an occupational exposure.  After the exclusion, approximately 147,000 valid 
Day-1 inspector samples remained in the dataset. 
 
Methods for Estimating Existing Exposures 

MSHA limited its 2000 and 2003 QRAs to underground mines exhibiting a group 
of recurrent exposures (recurrency measure), which was defined as two or more samples 
that exceeded the applicable standard in a year.  In the earlier QRAs, the Agency used 
three exposure groups:  designated occupation (DO), non-designated occupation (NDO), 
and roof-bolter designated area (RB-DA). 

MSHA’s approach in the earlier QRAs was based on the assumption that the 

designated occupation would have the highest exposure at each mechanized mining unit 
(MMU) and that reducing exposure for a DO would also reduce exposures for the NDOs 
at that MMU by a commensurate amount.  However, later statistical analyses revealed 
that at least one NDO exposure exceeded the associated DO exposure on more than 
50 percent of MSHA’s Day 1 respirable coal mine dust sampling inspections during 
2000-2002 (Kogut, 2003) and that at least one NDO exposure exceeded the associated 
DO exposure on 55 percent of the Day-1 shifts inspected during 2004 – 2008, (2010 
QRA, p. 7). 

Based on these findings and to better reflect the variability among exposures, 
MSHA used a more disaggregated approach for the 2010 QRA.  Specifically, for the 
2010 QRA, MSHA developed estimates for many more categories or groups of 
exposures, according to work location, coal "rank" (carbon content), and recurrency (how 
frequently measurements exceeded 2.0 mg/m3 or 1.0 mg/m3), as explained below.   

MSHA stratified the 2004-2008 exposure data according to work location (WL).  
Each WL consisted of miners in the same job category who worked in the same general 
area.  There were 12,634 WLs in underground mines, 7,811 WLs in surface mines, and 
3,585 WLs in surface processing facilities.  When there were fewer than two inspector 
samples for a specific job category in a specific work location, or the average of the 
inspector samples was less than the average of the operator samples, MSHA combined 
inspector and operator samples to estimate exposures.  MSHA then sorted the data within 
each WL according to three factors: 

•  By occupation -- The 2010 QRA used 33 occupational categories, plus a separate 

category for Part 90 miners. 

 

13

•  By coal rank -- Rank is a measure of carbon content.  Higher rank is associated 

with higher risk of lung disease.  MSHA’s 2010 QRA used three coal rank 
categories: 

o  Anthracite; 
o  High-rank bituminous, containing less than 4% of moisture in air-dried 

coal or more than 84 percent of carbon in dry, ash-free coal; and 

o  Low/medium rank. 

•  By recurrency class -- MSHA’s 2010 QRA used three recurrency classes:  

o  WLs with at least two valid samples greater than 2.0 mg/m3 in 2008;  
o  WLs with at least two samples between 1.0 mg/m3 and 2.0 mg/m3 in 2008; 

and  

o  WLs with no more than one valid sample greater than 1.0 mg/m3 in 2008.  

Together, these three factors defined groupings of work environments that 
presented similar health risks to miners.  The use of disaggregated data (i.e., data 
stratified by three factors), permits the identification of high risk combinations that would 
likely be missed if just the average exposures of large groups with dissimilar risks were 
considered.  
 
Estimated Adverse Health Effects 

MSHA estimated the numbers of adverse health effects that would result from a 

45-year working life-time of exposures to respirable coal mine dust under existing 
conditions, using the existing approach to determining compliance by applying statistical 
modeling techniques to the estimated average exposures for groupings of WLs.  MSHA's 
2010 QRA used three exposure models to estimate the risks of five adverse health effects: 

•  The risk of developing CWP 1+; 
•  The risk of developing CWP 2+; 
•  The risk of developing PMF; 
•  The risk of developing severe emphysema; and 
•  The risk of dying from non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD), which 

includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, CWP, PMF, and silicosis. 
Model 1.  As was done in its 2000 and 2003 QRAs, MSHA used the 1995 

Attfield-Seixas model to relate constant levels of exposure to respirable coal mine dust 
for 45 years to cases of CWP and PMF.  The more detailed categorization of exposures in 
the 2010 QRA compared to the previous QRAs improved the accuracy of estimates, for 
example, by enabling separate equations for high-rank and low/medium rank coal.  More 
data points allowed estimates to more closely track the nonlinear nature of the exposure-
response model. 

Model 2.  The Agency used the model in the 2009 Kuempel et al. study of the 

relationship between emphysema severity at autopsy and impaired lung function during 
life to estimate the number of cases of severe emphysema that would result from 45 years 
of levels of exposure to respirable coal mine dust under existing conditions and the 
existing methods of determining compliance. 

 

14

Model 3.  Mortality due to non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD) includes 

deaths ascribed to either pneumoconiosis or any of the various chronic obstructive 
pulmonary diseases (COPD) including emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic airways 
obstruction.  The Agency used the model in the 2008 Attfield-Kuempel et al. study of the 
relationship between cumulative exposure to respirable coal mine dust among working 
coal miners and causes of death as recorded on their death certificates to estimate cases of 
NMRD. 
 
Estimated Cases per Thousand Miners based on Existing Conditions 

•  Pneumoconioses.  Among every one-thousand miners who work 45 years in 
coal mines under existing conditions, MSHA estimates that there would be 
between 2 and 652 cases of CWP 1+, between 1 and 715 cases of CWP 2+, 
and between 1 and 643 cases of PMF by age 73, depending on occupation.  
The occupation associated with the lowest rate of illness is the utility man at 
surface anthracite mines and the occupation associated with the highest rate 
of illness is classified as other underground workers in high rank bituminous 
mines.  (See Tables 13 – 15 in the 2010 QRA.) 

•  Emphysema.  Among every one-thousand white miners who work 45 years in 

coal mines under existing conditions and never smoked, MSHA estimates 
that there would be between 6 and 306 cases of severe emphysema by age 73, 
depending on occupation.  The occupation associated with the lowest rate of 
illness is the crane/dragline operator at surface and the occupation associated 
with the highest rate of illness is classified as other underground workers.    
(See Table 16 in the 2010 QRA. MSHA developed separate estimates of the 
risk of developing severe emphysema per thousand exposed miners for 
whites and non-whites.  However, since MSHA does not have employment 
data by race, the Agency used the risk factors for white miners, which are 
lower than for non-whites, to estimate the benefits.) 

•  Non–Malignant Respiratory Disease.  Among every one-thousand miners 

who work 45 years in coal mines under existing conditions, MSHA estimates 
that there would be between 1 and 164 deaths from NMRD by age 73, 
depending on occupation.  Several occupations at low rank surface mines are 
associated with the lowest rate of illness and the utility man that surface 
anthracite mines is associated with the highest rate of illness.  (See Table 17 
in the 2010 QRA.) 
The 2010 QRA only evaluated the three adverse health effects noted above and 
did not address other adverse health effects that could result from exposure to respirable 
coal mine dust. 
 

ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED RULE ON MINERS’ EXPOSURES 

 

In the 2010 QRA, MSHA projected average exposures in each WL for a cohort of 

miners assumed to be exposed only to conditions consistent with the proposed reduction in the 
PEL and  the proposed application of single sample to determine noncompliance for a 45-year 
working life-time.  That is, the cohort modeled in this portion of the assessment was assumed not 

 

15

In estimating the impact of the proposed rule, MSHA assumed that exposures that 

to have had the prior exposures that the actual current population of miners has experienced to 
date over their working lifetime. 
 
Furthermore, MSHA’s 2010 did not consider other changes in the proposed rule 
(e.g., sampling for the full-shift, changes in the definition of normal production shift, and 
sampling the DOs and Part 90 miners on every production shift using the CPDM).  The 
Agency then aggregated the projections by the same groupings of work environments as 
used in evaluating existing risks.  MSHA assumed that exposures for samples that 
currently exceed the proposed standards of 1.0 mg/m3, or of 0.5 mg/m3 for Part 90 miners 
would be reduced to exactly the proposed standards.  For non-Part 90 miners, all samples 
greater than 1.0 mg/m3 were replaced by a value of 1.0 mg/m3 and for Part 90 miners all 
samples greater than 0.5 mg /m3 were replaced by a value of 0.5 mg /m3. 
 
currently exceed the proposed standard of 1.0 mg/m3 for non-Part 90 miners would be 
lowered to exactly 1.0 mg/m3.   Although the majority of miners' exposures are currently 
at or below 1.0 mg/m3, the percentage of samples above 1.0 mg/m3 taken at the WLs 
ranges from less than 1 percent for a few surface occupations to more than 70 percent for 
longwall tailgate operators.   
 
of 0.5 mg/m3 for Part 90 miners would be lowered to exactly 0.5 mg/m3.  For Part 90 
miners, exposures currently exceed 0.5 mg/m3 at more than 20 percent of WLs. 
MSHA projected that average exposures in each WL with exposures under existing 
standards between 1.0 mg/m3 and 2.0 mg/m3 would be lowered by an average of nearly 
one third.  MSHA projected that most Part 90 miners would experience a reduction in 
average dust concentration of about 40 percent. 

MSHA also assumed that exposures that currently exceed the proposed standard 

MSHA used the models based on the Attfield-Seixas, Kuempel et al., and 

Attfield-Kuempel et al. studies described above to estimate the adverse health effects 
under conditions consistent with two provisions of the proposed rule.  With the average 
exposures that would occur under the lower limit and single, full-shift sample provisions 
of the proposed rule, MSHA's 2010 QRA estimated  the following risks among every 
one-thousand exposed miners who work 45 years in coal mines: 

 

•  Pneumoconioses.  Among every one-thousand miners who work 45 years in 
coal mines, MSHA projects that there would be between 2 and 178 cases of 
CWP 1+, between 1 and 141 cases of CWP 2+, and between 1 and 97 cases 
of PMF by age 73, depending on occupation.   The occupation associated 
with the lowest rate of illness is the utility man at surface anthracite mines 
and the occupation associated with the highest rate of illness is the utility man 
in high rank bituminous mines.   (See Tables 21 – 23 in the 2010 QRA.) 

•  Emphysema.  Among every one-thousand white miners who work 45 years in 
coal mines and never smoked, MSHA projects that there would be between 5 
and 94 cases of severe emphysema by age 73, depending on occupation.  The 
occupation associated with the lowest rate of illness is the crane/dragline 
operator at surface and the occupation associated with the highest rate of 

 

16

illness is the utility man in high rank bituminous mines.  (See Table 24 in the 
2010 QRA.) 

•  Non–Malignant Respiratory Disease.  Among every one-thousand miners 

who work 45 years in coal mines, MSHA projects that there would be 
between 1 and 110 deaths from NMRD by age 73, depending on occupation.  
Several occupations at surface mines are associated with the lowest rate of 
illness and other surface workers at anthracite mines is associated with the 
highest rate of illness.  (See Table 25 in the 2010 QRA.) 

 

REDUCTION IN RISK UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE 

By subtracting the risk estimated under exposure conditions consistent with 
the proposed rule from the estimated risks based on average exposures from 2004 – 
2008 using the existing approach to compliance, MSHA estimated the change in risk 
that might be associated with two provisions of the proposed rule.  Table III-1 shows 
the reduction in risks by age 73 per one-thousand exposed miners who work 45 years 
in coal mines would be as follows:   

  

•  Pneumoconioses.  Among every one-thousand miners who work 45 years in 
coal mines, MSHA projects that there would be a reduction of between 1 and 
105 cases of CWP 1+, between 1 and 102 cases of CWP 2+, and up to 75 
cases of PMF, by age 73, depending on occupation.    Several occupations at 
surface mines are associated with the lowest reductions of illness and the 
cutting machine operator at underground mines is associated with the highest 
reduction of illness. 

•  Emphysema.  Among every one-thousand white miners who work 45 years in 

coal mines and never smoked, MSHA projects that there would be a 
reduction of up to 35 cases of severe emphysema by age 73, depending on 
occupation.   Several occupations at surface mines are associated with the 
lowest reductions of illness and the cutting machine operator at underground 
mines is associated with the highest reduction of illness. 

•  Non–Malignant Respiratory Disease.  Among every one-thousand miners 

who work 45 years in coal mines, MSHA projects that there would be a 
reduction of between 1 and 6 deaths from NMRD by age 73, depending on 
occupation.  Several occupations at surface mines are associated with the 
lowest reductions of illness and the cutting machine operator at underground 
mines is associated with the highest reduction of illness. 
 

Application of Risk Reduction Estimates to Population of Miners 
 
prevented per thousand exposed miners) to the current number of coal miners estimated 
to be in each occupation2.  As shown in Table III-2, over a 45-year period, MSHA 

MSHA then applied these risk estimates (i.e., the numbers of cases and deaths 

                                                           
2 Employment estimates by occupation were developed by MSHA’s Coal Division of Health. 

 

17

estimates that  there would be 1,301 cases of CWP 1+, 985 cases of CWP 2+, 641 cases 
of PMF, 556 cases of severe emphysema, and 106 deaths from NMRD prevented. 
 
These are chronic diseases requiring many years to develop.  The literature on the 
health effects resulting from exposure to respirable coal mine dust indicates that there are 
various latency periods associated with the various effects, and that the latency may be 
associated with the intensity of exposure.  Due to the latency periods, one would not 
expect all benefits to materialize immediately after exposures have been substantially 
reduced or eliminated.  To illustrate the impact of our uncertainty about the latency, when 
MSHA monetizes the stream of benefits (below) two alternative values are provided: one 
using a 10 year latency and one using no latency. 
 
experience two different life-time exposure scenarios, it is not possible to quantify the 
reduction in risk that would occur to a population with who experienced a reduction in 
exposures. Such a calculation would require validated information on the shape of the 
cessation lag for each endpoint.  For instance, in the case of cigarette smoking, we know 
that risks drop off dramatically five years after ceasing exposure. However the situation 
with coal miner exposure is not as straight forward in the mining context, where 
exposures are being reduced but not eliminated and where it is not clear how whether 
disease progression is halted or only slowed.  Thus, no benefits were projected for 
slowing or stopping the progression of disease among the population with previous 
exposures and an underlying disease burden.  
 

 Similarly, because MSHA’s analysis compares two separate cohorts who

Extrapolation of Additional Benefits from Shift and Production Adjustments to 
Determining Compliance 

MSHA’s 2010 QRA presents estimates for two of the proposed changes – 

lowering the limit from 2.0 mg/m3 to 1.0 mg/m3 and basing determinations of 
noncompliance on single samples rather than the average of 5 samples.  However, as is 
explained in the Technological Feasibility section, if the proposed requirement for full-
shift sampling and the proposed definition of normal production shift had been in effect 
in 2009, the amount of dust on the samples would have been higher the because of the 
longer time and the higher levels of production.  Lowering exposures from these higher 
levels to the levels being proposed would result in additional benefits beyond those 
associated with the recorded sampling results.   

To illustrate how much these two requirements could increase the benefits, 

MSHA assumed that the additional reduction in health effects would be proportional to 
the additional reduction in exposure associated with the two additional proposed 
provisions.  MSHA used the factors developed for adjusting exposures to assess 
technological feasibility (see IV. Technological Feasibility for the derivation of these 
factors) to also adjust the benefit estimates.  For underground and Part 90 miners, MSHA 
multiplied the benefits by a factor of 1.13 to account for the application of full shift 
sampling and by a factor of 1.09 to account for the application of the proposed definition 
of normal production shift.  For surface miners, MSHA multiplied the benefits by a factor 
of 1.25 to account for the application of full shift sampling.  The benefit estimates 
presented in Table III-3 are the estimates in Table III-2, plus the estimates associated 
with two other provisions of the proposed rule (i.e., adjusted by the factors from the 
Feasibility Assessment to account for full-shift sampling and the proposed definition of 
normal production shift).

ESTIMATED MONETIZED VALUE OF FATALITIES AND ILLNESSES 
PREVENTED 

To estimate the monetary values of the reductions in cases of CWP 1+, CWP 2+, 
PMF, severe emphysema and deaths from NMRD, MSHA performed an analysis of the 
imputed value of illnesses and fatalities avoided based on a willingness-to-pay approach. 
This approach relies on the theory of compensating wage differentials (i.e., the wage 

 

21

premium paid to workers to accept the risk associated with various jobs) in the labor 
market.  A number of studies have shown a correlation between higher job risk and 
higher wages, suggesting that employees demand monetary compensation in return for 
incurring a greater risk of illness or fatality.   

Viscusi & Aldy (2003) conducted an analysis of studies that use a willingness-to-

pay methodology to estimate the imputed value of life-saving programs (i.e., meta-
analysis) and found that each fatality avoided was valued at approximately $7 million and 
each lost work-day injury was approximately $50,000 in 2000 dollars.  Using the GDP 
Deflator (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2010), this yields an estimate of $8.7 
million for each fatality avoided and $62,000 for each injury avoided in 2009 dollars.  
MSHA is using the $8.7 million estimate for the value of a death prevented and $62,000 
for each case of CWP 1+ or CWP 2+ prevented.  This value of a statistical life (VSL) 
estimate is within the range of the substantial majority of such estimates in the literature 
($1 million to $10 million per statistical life), as discussed in OMB Circular A-4 (OMB, 
2003).   

Given the disabling consequences of PMF and severe emphysema, MSHA does 

not believe that limiting the value to the estimate for lost workday injuries is appropriate. 
Instead, MSHA based the value of a case of PMF and severe emphysema prevented on 
the work of Magat, Viscusi & Huber (1996), which estimated the value of a non-fatal 
cancer avoided.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) used this 
approach in the Final Economic Analysis (FEA) supporting its hexavalent chromium 
final rule, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used this approach in its Stage 2 
Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts water rule (EPA, 2003).  Although PMF and 
severe emphysema are not non-fatal cancers, MSHA believes that they have a similar 
impact on the quality of life and would thus result in similar valuations.   Based on 
Magat, Viscusi & Huber (1996), EPA valued the prevention of a case of nonfatal cancer 
at 58.3 percent of the value of a fatal cancer avoided.  MSHA estimates the value of a 
case of PMF or severe emphysema prevented to be $5.1 million ($5.1 million = 58.3 
percent of $8.7 million). 

Although MSHA is using the willingness-to-pay approach as the basis for 

monetizing the expected benefits of the proposed rule, the Agency does so with several 
reservations, given the methodological difficulties involved in estimating the 
compensating wage differentials (see Hintermann, Alberini and Markandya, 2008).  
Furthermore, these estimates pooled across different industries may not capture the 
unique circumstances faced by coal miners.  For example, some have suggested that VSL 
models be disaggregated to account for different levels of risk, as might occur in coal 
mining (see Sunstein, 2004).  In addition, coal miners may have few options of 
alternative employers and in some cases only one employer (near-monopsony or 
monopsony) that may depress wages below those in a more competitive labor market. 

MSHA developed the estimates in Table III-4 by multiplying the number of 

adverse health effects in Tables III-2 and III-3 by the monetized value of each adverse 
health effect.

The monetized benefits in Table III-4 cover a 45-year period.  When estimating 
the annual benefits it is necessary to take the timing of when the health benefits accrue 
into account.  However, it is quite difficult to gauge the timing of reductions in chronic 
diseases that may not develop until years after initial exposure and whose progression 
may not be instantly stopped even if exposure were completely eliminated.  MSHA did 
not have the data necessary to project the timing of CWP and related diseases.  
Furthermore, MSHA does not have data on the historical exposures of the current 
workforce of coal miners; they have already been exposed to various levels of respirable 
coal mine dust and some lung damage has invariably already been done.  In the absence 
of this data and the information on the latency and cessation lags, MSHA estimated the 
monetized benefits under two alternative assumptions to illustrate some of the uncertainty 
in its estimates.   

 

•  First, MSHA made the assumption that benefits begin immediately and that 
annual benefits equal lifetime benefits divided by 45 years.  This assumption 
is equivalent to assuming that the benefits begin to accrue in the first year 
after the provisions are put into effect, which MSHA admits is highly 
unrealistic.  

•  Second, MSHA assumed that no benefits would occur for the first 10 years 

and that the annualized benefit for each of the next 35 years would be equal to 
the projected benefits divided by 35 years.   

The impact of each of these assumptions is calculated using a 7 percent discount 

rate, consistent with OMB’s Circular A-4.

Uncertainties in the Benefits Estimates 
 
The analysis numbers presented in Table III-5 might be viewed as incomplete 
estimates because they do not include the potential impacts of other provisions of the 
proposed rule.  In addition, MSHA’s estimates are based on a series of simplifying 
assumptions.  The impact of these assumptions on the total benefits depends on the 
degree of the mismatch between the assumption and reality.  Unfortunately, MSHA does 
not have the data to quantify this uncertainty.  However, the impact of assumptions about 
the timing of the benefits probably has the most significant impact on the estimated 
monetized benefits.  
 
Summary of Limitations and Assumptions: 
 

•  MSHA did not quantify the benefits associated with several provisions of the 
proposed rule (e.g., sampling the designated occupations (DOs) and Part 90 
miners on every production shift using the CPDM, periodic examinations, 
expanding the Part 90 option to surface miners). 

•  MSHA does not have data from which to predict disease latency, thus it is not 

clear how soon the benefits estimated in this analysis will accrue. 

•  MSHA’s analysis compares two separate cohorts who experience two different 

life-time exposure scenarios, thus, it is not clear whether the actual cohort of 
miners (who already have prior exposures) are likely to experience the magnitude 
of “avoided” adverse health effects documented.  

•  On the other hand, the lack of information on the distribution of cumulative 

exposures of current miners (e.g., the distribution of the number of years that the 
current population of miners has worked in coal mines) and the lack of 
information from which to specify a cessation lag means that no benefits were 
projected for slowing or stopping the progression of disease associated with 
historical exposures.  
In the QRA, MSHA assumes that operators would bring single-shift exposures 
that under existing standards exceed the proposed standard of 1.0 mg/m3 (or 0.5 
mg/m3 for Part 90 miners) down to exactly the proposed standard.  It is possible 
that exposures would be reduced to even lower levels.   

• 

•  MSHA’s methodology did not take into account that the measures that operators 
may take to avoid having exposures on any shift exceed the proposed standards 
would also likely lower exposures that are now below the proposed exposure 
limit.  Specifically, the proposed rule would require that the CPDM be used to 
monitor dust levels of the DOs and Part 90 miners on every shift.  The CPDM 

 

24

would enable mine management to be proactive and take immediate preventive 
action to avoid potentially excessive exposures. 

•  The Agency's QRA uses average exposures by occupation, coal rank, and 

recurrency class to estimate risk.   

•  Since MSHA does not have data on the racial composition of the mining 

population, the Agency applies the risk factors for whites to all miners when 
calculating the number of cases of severe emphysema that would be prevented.  
As shown in Table 28 of the 2010 QRA, the reduction in excess risk of severe 
emphysema per thousand exposed miners is greater for non-whites than for 
whites. 

•  MSHA’s 2010 QRA does not take into account potential reductions in other 

adverse health effects associated with coal dust, particularly when the dust has 
high levels of certain minerals such as silica that might be reduced by the 
provisions of the proposed regulation.

IV. TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY 

INTRODUCTION 

This chapter discusses MSHA’s evaluation of the technological feasibility of the 

proposed rule.  Based on the analysis that follows, MSHA has determined that the 
proposed rule is technologically feasible. 

To meet the requirements of the proposed rule, operators would have to develop 
and follow well-designed dust control plans, train miners and certified persons, monitor 
concentrations of respirable coal mine dust over a full work shift using approved 
sampling devices, take corrective actions in the case of overexposures, report sampling 
results and plan changes to MSHA and the miners’ representative, and conduct medical 
surveillance.   

The most significant change would require operators to meet dust exposure limits 

50 percent lower than the existing limits.  However, sampling data (see Table IV-1) 
indicate that not only are mine operators keeping miners’ exposures at or below the levels 
required under the existing standards, but dust exposures at most operations average less 
than the proposed standard of 1.0 mg/m³.  Thus the majority of miners’ exposures are at 
or below the limits in the proposed rule.  MSHA understands that these data reflect 
measurements under the existing sampling program and that requirements under the 
proposed rule (e.g. use of single full-shift samples to determine noncompliance, change 
in the definition of normal production shift) would result in higher exposures compared 
to the existing sampling program.  However, existing engineering controls including 
ventilation, sprays and environmentally controlled cabs along with changes in work 
practices can be used to further reduce dust levels.  MSHA acknowledges that in rare 
instances, some operators, after taking these actions, may encounter implementation 
issues as they attempt to comply with the proposed requirements and need to take 
additional measures to comply with the proposed standard.  

To facilitate operator implementation of the requirements in the proposed rule 
related to the lower exposure limits, MSHA has included a two-year phase-in period to 
allow mine operators time to come into compliance with the proposed 1.0 mg/m³ 
standard.  During this phase-in period, MSHA will work with the mining industry to help 
them identify, develop, and implement feasible engineering controls, and train miners and 
supervisors in new technology. 
The proposal would also require implementation of new and improved dust 
 
monitoring technology, the CPDM.  The CPDM provides real-time information on 
respirable coal mine dust (respirable dust) levels to which miners are exposed.  Use of the 
CPDM, in conjunction with currently available control measures, would enable the 
operator to better monitor dust exposures during the shift and be proactive in taking 
appropriate corrective measures during the shift to prevent possible overexposures. 
The proposal would require the operator to use the CPDM to sample certain 

underground occupations, after a 12- or 18-month phase-in period, unless notified by the 
Secretary.  MSHA believes that the proposed phase-in periods would allow 

 

26

manufacturers enough time to produce the necessary quantity of CPDMs, and MSHA and 
operators enough time to train necessary personnel in the use and care of the device. 

MSHA acknowledges that, initially, some mines would encounter implementation 

issues as they attempt to comply with the proposed requirements.  However, MSHA 
believes that most coal mines, regardless of their size and type of mining system being 
used, would be able to address any implementation issues and meet the requirements of 
the proposed rule within the proposed two-year phase-in period for the standards and 18 
month phase-in period for the CPDM.   MSHA believes that as a result of the proposed 
phase-in of the requirements, all coal mines, including longwall operations with the 
highest dust concentrations, would have sufficient time to either upgrade existing controls 
or to install additional measures to meet the proposed requirements. 
 

FEASIBILITY OF COMPLYING WITH THE PROPOSED STANDARDS 

This section presents MSHA’s evaluation of the feasibility of maintaining miners’ 

respirable dust exposures during each work shift at or below the exposure limits 
prescribed in the proposed rule.  The evaluation is based on (1) an analysis of results of 
respirable coal mine dust samples (unadjusted and adjusted for full-shift and normal 
production, if applicable) that were collected by MSHA inspectors and mine operators 
during calendar year 2009; (2) review of the best practices currently available to control 
respirable coal mine dust in underground and surface coal mining operations; and (3) 
Agency enforcement experience. 

On the basis of the Agency’s evaluations of the 2009 sampling data, best 

practices, and the effectiveness of existing engineering controls that have developed into 
industry standards, MSHA has concluded that it is technologically feasible for the coal 
mining industry to reduce miners’ exposure to the proposed respirable dust limits and 
maintain compliance on each work shift as prescribed in the proposed rule. 

 The proposed rule would reduce the respirable coal mine dust standards in phases 

from the existing 2.0 mg/m3 to 1.0 mg/m3 over a two-year period.  The proposed  rule 
would also reduce the standards for Part 90 miners and intake air from the existing 1.0 
mg/m3 to 0.5 mg/m3 over a six month period. 

There are two other changes in the proposed rule that merit discussion as the 

Agency addresses feasibility: (1) the proposed requirements to base determinations of 
noncompliance on single full-shift samples taken during normal production, and (2) the 
proposed requirement to use the CPDM to sample designated occupations (DO) and 
Part 90 miners on every shift after the 12 month phase-in period. 

MSHA’s evaluation of the technological feasibility of keeping miner exposures to 

respirable coal mine dust during each work shift in all active workings of underground 
and surface operations at or below the proposed standards of 1.0 mg/m3 for most miners 
and 0.5 mg/m3 for Part 90 miners and intake air is presented below. 
 
Dust Exposure Conditions in Coal Mines under the Existing Standards 

In assessing the ability of the coal mining industry to meet the lower proposed 

standards on each shift, MSHA evaluated the industry’s experience in complying with the 
existing dust standards.  Under the existing standards, both inspector and operator 

 

27

compliance sampling in the MMUs is performed (1) over time periods no longer than 
eight hours and (2) at production levels of at least 80 percent of average production when 
sampled by an MSHA inspector or at least 50 percent of the production reported during 
the collection of the last five valid bimonthly samples when sampled by the operator.  
Sampling of other entity types such as designated areas (DAs), DWPs, and Part 90 miners 
conducted by MSHA and operators are also carried out over eight hours and under 
operating conditions involving normal mining activity. 

MSHA’s accumulated enforcement experience suggests that past performance 

remains an important predictor of how the mining industry will respond to more 
challenging health regulations such as those being proposed.  Table IV-1 provides a 
summary of the key respirable dust performance metrics for each type of entity sampled 
in surface and underground coal mining operations by MSHA inspectors and mine 
operators during CY 2009.  The average concentrations across all entity types in surface 
and underground operations were well below existing standards, as well as below the 
proposed standards of 1.0 mg/m3 (or 0.5 mg/m3 for Part 90 miners and intake air) for all 
entities sampled, except for longwall MMUs.  Average concentrations ranged from a high 
of 0.481 mg/m3 to 0.229 mg/m3 for surface occupations, with at least 88% of individual 
samples below 1.0 mg/m3.  At underground mines, average concentrations ranged from 
0.748 mg/m3 for non-longwall DOs to 1.206 mg/m3 for longwall DOs, while the 
percentage of individual samples below 1.0 mg/m3 ranged from a high of 77% to a low of 
40%.  Longwall mining operations are the highest coal producers in underground mining 
and as a result, tend to generate significant levels of respirable coal mine dust in the 
process. 

Although longwall MMUs as a group averaged dust concentrations that exceeded 

the proposed standard of 1.0 mg/m3 by approximately 21 percent, when each observed 
concentration measurement was compared to its applicable standard, the reported 
concentrations were, on average, significantly below the applicable standard - 0.725 
mg/m3 lower for MSHA inspector samples and 0.791 mg/m3 lower for operator 
compliance samples.  This indicates that longwall MMUs effectively maintained dust 
concentrations well below the applicable standards on sampled shifts, very few of which 
were below the existing 2.0 mg/m3 standard due to quartz. 

Other important indicators of the operators’ ability to maintain dust 

concentrations below the existing standards are presented in Table IV-2.  Fewer than 230 
noncompliance decisions were issued during 2009, less than one tenth of one percent of 
the over 26,000 compliance determinations estimated to have been processed that year.  
Overall compliance rates on shifts sampled by both MSHA and operators exceeded an 
estimated 95 percent, even on longwall MMUs that historically have had difficulty 
maintaining compliance due to the large amounts of dust that they generate.

Adjusted Equivalent Concentrations Compared to Proposed Standards               

Under proposed §§ 70.201(e), 71.201(b) and 90.201(b)), sampling would be 

carried out over the entire work shift.  Since the work shift for many miners normally 
extends beyond eight hours, it is likely that the reported sampling results for CY 2009 
understate miners’ everyday respirable dust exposures.  Also, since selected occupations 
on each MMU would be sampled every production shift when using the new CPDM, the 
sampling results would better reflect actual dust exposures under everyday production 
conditions.  These regulatory changes would result in more representative monitoring of 
dust concentrations to which miners are being exposed on a daily basis in the active 
workings. 

Assuming all other variables being constant, one would expect the observed dust 
concentrations to increase as a result of these changes.  In order to evaluate the impact of 
these changes for feasibility purposes, MSHA applied two adjustments to the CY 2009 
data.  The first adjustment involved multiplying each concentration value by the 
appropriate industry-wide average full-shift factor to estimate the equivalent 
concentration, as defined in the proposed rule, to which miners were being exposed if 
sampling had been carried out over a full work shift instead of eight hours.  This yielded 
an estimated quantity that was equivalent in dosage to the concentration as measured by 
an approved sampler on an 8-hour work shift.  This quantity underwent a second 
adjustment by applying an industry-wide production factor, if it involved an underground 
sampling entity (excluding intake air), to compensate for differences between the 
production rate on the sampling shift and the production rate when sampling is not taking 
place.  The derivation of these adjustment factors is discussed below. 

In deriving the industry-wide average full-shift factors, MSHA assumed that the 

dust generation rate during the first eight hours would be similar to the rate during the 
extended period, resulting in the dust accumulated during the extended period to be solely 
a function of the additional time.  Using 2009 shift length information for each mine 
stored in the MSHA Standardized Information System (MSIS) database, MSHA 
determined that the average shift length across all surface operations regardless of type or 
size of operation was approximately 10 hours.  The average for longwall MMUs was 
10 hours.  The average for non-longwall MMUs was 9 hours.  These calculated values for 
underground operations were comparable to the shift lengths reported by MSHA 
inspectors during an enforcement activity carried out in October 2009.  This special 
activity involved sampling approximately 25% of the active MMUs or some 193 MMUs 
and collecting production and other information for use in this rulemaking. 

The average shift lengths were then divided by the 8-hour sampling time to arrive 

at an adjustment factor for full-shift sampling.   The 10 hour average for surface and 
longwall shifts resulted in an adjustment factor of 1.25 (i.e., 10/8).  The 9 hour average 
shift in non-longwalls resulted in an adjustment factor of 1.13 (i.e., 9/8).   The individual 
inspector and operator sampling results from 2009 were then multiplied by the 
appropriate factor to adjust for the proposed requirement to sample over a full-shift.

In deriving the normal production factor for underground mines, MSHA applied a 
conservative method using production data for the previous 30 production shifts collected 
from mine operators during the Agency’s enforcement activities in October 2009.  First, 
the 30-shift average production was calculated for each of the 193 MMUs that were 
inspected.  These production values were then averaged across all non-longwall and 
longwall MMUs, yielding estimated overall 30-shift averages of 921 tons and 7,355 tons, 
respectively. These averages were then divided by the average shift length applicable to 
the MMU type established earlier to estimate average production rate in tons per hour. 
For example, to estimate the overall longwall MMU production rate, 7,355 tons, which 
represents the full-shift production, was divided by 10 hours, yielding an estimated 
production rate of 736 tons/hour. The same calculation was performed for non-longwall 
MMUs resulting in a production rate of 102 tons/hour. 

Next, the actual production reported for each MSHA inspector and operator 

sample collected during CY 2009 was averaged across all non-longwall and longwall 
MMUs.  This yielded overall 8-hour averages of 672 tons and 5,537 tons, respectively, 
for MSHA inspector samples, and 703 tons and 5,398, respectively, for operator 
compliance samples.  These averages were then divided by 8 hours, yielding estimates of 
the average production rate across the respective MMU types.  For example, the non-
longwall production rate for operator samples was estimated at 88 tons/shift (703 tons ÷ 
8) and 675 tons/shift (5,398 tons ÷ 8) for longwall MMUs. 

These estimates of average production rates were used to derive the industry-wide 

production factors by dividing the estimated overall 30-shift average production rate by 
the overall CY 2009 average production rate.  In the case of non-longwall MMUs, each 
operator DO concentration that was previously adjusted to an equivalent full-shift 
concentration was multiplied by 1.16 (102 tons/hr ÷ 88 tons/hr).   And each longwall 
MMU sample was multiplied by 1.09 (735 tons/hr ÷ 675 tons/hr).  These production 
factors were applied to each previously adjusted sample for the MMUs to generate the 
final estimated equivalent concentration levels.  The resulting effects of these adjustments 
are shown in Table IV-3 and examined for each entity type in surface and underground 
operations. 

Surface DWPs and NDWPs - The adjusted data show that at least 88% of 

exposures for each entity type at surface operations are already meeting the proposed 1.0 
mg/m3 standard.  The average deviation of sample concentrations from the applicable 
standard as measured by the average difference, which ranged from a high of -1.356 
mg/m3 for other DWP occupations to -0.498 mg/m3 for highwall drill operators, indicates 
that operators were effective in maintaining dust concentrations well below the applicable 
standard in effect during the sampled shifts. 

The data indicate that, by diligent application of available engineering controls 
and following good work practices, the dust concentrations at all work locations can be 
maintained consistently in compliance with the proposed exposure limit of 1.0 mg/m3 on 
each shift.  For example, one of the most effective ways to control dust generated during 
drilling operations is to equip the highwall drill with a properly designed and maintained 
dry dust collection system.  Enclosing the drill operator in an environmentally controlled 
cab would also protect the miner from exposure to respirable coal mine dust that may 
escape capture or that may be generated by other mobile equipment working nearby.  

 

32

Like highwall drill operators, operators of most mobile equipment being used at surface 
mines and facilities, such as bulldozers, can be protected from exposure to excessive dust 
concentrations with properly installed and maintained environmental cabs.  Dust from 
haulage roads can be suppressed with water or a variety of chemical agents. 

Likewise, workers in surface facilities can be protected by enclosing the dust-

generating processes, placing the operator in an environmentally controlled booth, using 
dust collectors to limit the amount of dust that becomes airborne, ensuring that the 
equipment is being maintained and functioning properly, and following good work 
practices. 

Part 90 Miners – The adjusted data show that the Part 90 miner adjusted average 
concentrations were below the proposed standard of 0.5 mg/m3 and that on average Part 
90 miners are being exposed to concentrations that are 0.5 to 0.6 mg/m3 below the 
existing standard of 1.0 mg/m3.  Approximately 69% of MSHA samples and 76% of 
operator samples are at or below 0.5 mg/m3, which suggests that operators are capable of 
complying with the proposed limit on the non-compliant shifts.  The use of the new 
CPDM, in conjunction with currently available control measures, would enable the 
operator to better monitor dust exposures during the shift and be proactive in taking 
appropriate corrective measures during the shift to prevent possible overexposures of 
Part 90 miners. 

Underground Operations – The adjusted data indicate that a substantial number of 

shifts at work locations in underground mines experience exposure levels above the 
proposed limits.  Therefore, instead of conducting the analysis at the mine level, MSHA 
examined the data on specific entity types in underground mines. 

Intake Air – The adjusted operator intake air concentrations, which primarily 

On the other hand, the quality of the intake air reaching the working faces was 

reflect the dust concentration in the belt air prior to mixing with regular intake air used to 
ventilate the working faces, averaged 0.535 mg/m3 or slightly above the proposed 
standard of 0.5 mg/m3.  Approximately 59% of the adjusted concentrations were at or 
below the proposed standard. 
  
significantly better as measured by MSHA inspectors, averaging 0.196 mg/m3 or 
approximately 61% less dusty than would be permitted under the proposed limit. In fact, 
93% of the adjusted concentrations were at or below 0.5 mg/m3.  The dust levels in the 
intake air can be further reduced by employing currently available engineering controls 
such as wetting roads and following good work practices such as limiting vehicle 
movement.  Thus, the adjusted inspector data clearly show that most mines are currently 
meeting the proposed limit for intake air and all should be able to comply on a consistent 
basis.

Many of the high dust concentrations for intake air represented samples taken 

while belt entries were being used as intake air courses.   Dust concentrations in the belt 
entry course, when used as an intake air course, can be consistently maintained below the 
proposed limit by employing currently available engineering controls such as water 
sprays at transfer points to adequately wet the conveyer belt and transported coal, 
combined with regular belt maintenance and cleaning of the belt entry.  Moreover, no 
mine is required to use belt entries as intake air courses.  In fact, relatively few operators 
use belt entries as intake air courses.  If maintaining the belt entries proves to be too 
burdensome for some of these operators, they have the option of using another entry for 
intake air. 

Roof Bolter DAs – Both the average adjusted inspector and operator 

concentrations (0.797 mg/m3 and 0.742 mg/m3, respectively) were below the proposed 
standard of 1.0 mg/m3.  No fewer than 74% of the individual adjusted concentrations 
were at or below the proposed limit. 

The experience of roof bolter operations required to comply with the reduced 

standards of 1.0 mg/m3 or less due to the presence of quartz is a further indication of the 
ability to comply with the proposed standard.  As shown in Table IV-4, 20% or some 442 
of the roof bolter DA samples were collected when the applicable standard in effect was 
1.0 mg/m3 or less.  Almost three quarters of these samples had adjusted concentrations 
that were at or below the proposed limit of 1.0 mg/m3.  This serves as further evidence 
that operators can maintain exposures of roof bolter operators at or below 1.0 mg/m3 
using currently available engineering controls and work practices such as properly 
maintaining the roof bolter dry dust collector system in approved condition; cleaning the 
dust box and replacing the filter media and other components when necessary; and 
following a mining cycle that limits roof bolting downwind of any dust generation 
sources.  Furthermore, the use of the CPDM would allow operators to make necessary 
alterations during the shift to prevent exposing roof bolter operators to excessive levels of 
respirable coal mine dust. 

Non-longwall MMUs – As a group, non-longwall MMUs represent approximately 

96% of the active MMUs in operation today, the vast majority of which employ 
continuous mining machines for coal extraction.  During 2009, nearly 1,100 non-longwall 
MMUs were sampled by MSHA inspectors and mine operators.  The adjusted DO 
concentrations averaged 1.101 mg/m3 and 0.980 mg/m3 based on MSHA and operator 
samples, respectively.  Approximately 55% (MSHA) and 66% (operator) of the adjusted 
DO concentrations were at or below 1.0 mg/m3.  The estimated adjusted average 
concentrations are at or marginally above 1.0 mg/m3.  MSHA believes that mines can 
meet the proposed lower limits using available and properly maintained engineering 
controls. 

To get additional insight regarding the industry’s ability to meet the proposed 

exposure limit, MSHA examined the statistic “average difference,” which estimates the 
average amount by which each adjusted concentration deviates below or above the 
applicable standard.  According to Table IV-3, inspector and operator adjusted DO 
concentrations were on average 0.701 mg/m3 and 0.841 mg/m3 below the applicable 
standard.  This important statistic indicates that, while not required to, operators chose to 
maintain concentrations well below the applicable standards in effect during the sampled 

 

35

shifts.  One would expect that practice to be continued when the proposed limits become 
effective. 

Further confirmation of the industry’s ability to meet lowered exposure limits is 

provided in Table IV-4, which shows the performance of MMUs required to comply with 
reduced standards of 1.0 mg/m3 or less due to the presence of quartz.  While the number  
of inspector (359 or 9%) and operator (1845 or 8%) DO samples taken at MMUs with 
applicable standards of 1.0 mg/m3 or less is relatively small compared to the total number 
of collected samples, they do provide additional indications that mines are capable of 
complying with standards that are as low as those being proposed.  It’s important to keep 
in mind that the enforcement scheme in effect when these and other entities were sampled 
involved averaging multiple samples for determining noncompliance, which permitted 
excursions above the applicable standard on individual shifts.  Even so, at least 61% of 
the adjusted DO concentrations were at or below 1.0 mg/m3.  On an MMU basis, the 
adjusted data show that of the 173 non-longwall MMUs required to comply with 
applicable standards of 1.0 mg/m3 or less at some period during 2009, 19 of these MMUs 
submitted DO samples that were all at or below the reduced standards. 

On the basis of these data, MSHA believes that it is technologically feasible for 

the non-longwall MMUs to meet the proposed 1.0 mg/m3 limit on each shift using 
currently available engineering controls, implementing well-designed face ventilation 
systems and controls, and following good maintenance and work practices.  Using the 
CPDM would permit operators to make necessary alterations to these controls during the 
shift to maintain dust concentration levels below the permissible exposure limit and 
prevent overexposures on individual shifts. 

Longwall MMUs – 55 longwall MMUs were sampled during 2009.  Based on the 

adjusted MSHA and operator data in Table IV-3, longwall DO concentrations averaged 
1.614 mg/m3 and 1.557 mg/m3, respectively.  The adjusted estimates are approximately 
34% to 36% higher than the unadjusted average concentrations and significantly higher 
than the proposed limit of 1.0 mg/m3.  Approximately 77% (MSHA) and 74% (operator) 
of the adjusted DO concentrations exceeded the proposed limit, which represents a 
greater than 43% increase compared to the unadjusted concentrations.

The fact that the longwall MMUs as a whole are not currently meeting the 

proposed limit is not an indication of whether or not it is feasible for these MMUs to 
meet the 1.0 mg/m3 proposed limit on each shift.  As noted previously, these MMUs were 
operating under the existing standards.  The “average difference” statistic shows that DO 
concentrations were on average 0.3 mg/m3 or more lower than the existing standards that 
were in effect at the time the samples were taken.  This confirms the operator’s ability to 
maintain concentrations below the existing standards on sampled shifts. 

Also, as it was pointed out previously, the enforcement scheme currently in effect 

permits excursions above the applicable standard on individual shifts.  The fact that 
longwall MMUs had a compliance rate exceeding 95%, having been cited only 14 times 
during 2009, provides evidence of their ability to comply with the exposure limit that was 
in effect at the time the samples were taken.  While this is not proof that the longwall 
operators can meet the proposed limits, it does indicate that these operators are not 
having difficulty meeting the existing limits. 

Ventilation is the most effective control to reduce the dust levels in the longwall 

MMUs.  The amount of ventilation reaching the MMUs can be increased by better 
maintenance and positioning of the line curtains and stoppings, increasing the size and 
number of fans, and reducing the restrictions in the air intake.  In some case, operators 
may have to switch to exhaust ventilation or develop additional airways.  In addition to 
ventilation, sprays and work practices are critical to holding down the amount of 
respirable dust in the air.  Dust concentrations could be further reduced at some MMUs 
by installing more efficient and better positioned nozzles as well as increasing the water 
pressure and volume.  Work practices, such as proper positioning of the miner as well as 
the cleaning and maintenance of the dust controls would further reduce dust levels.  
Using the CPDM would permit operators to make necessary alterations to these controls 
during the shift to maintain dust concentration levels below the permissible exposure 
limit and prevent overexposures on individual shifts. 

MSHA acknowledges that in rare instances, some operators after taking these 

actions may encounter implementation issues as they attempt to comply with the 
proposed requirements and need to take additional measures to comply with the proposed 
standard.  However, while these implementation issues may be challenging for some 
longwall operators, given the advancements in longwall mining technology and 
automation achieved to date, and the available proven engineering controls, MSHA 
believes that the proposed exposure limit of 1.0 mg/m3 is technologically feasible for 
longwall MMUs. 
 

FEASIBILITY OF USING THE CPDM 

The CPDM has undergone extensive testing in a variety of underground coal 

mines.  This testing was conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH) through an informal partnership with industry, labor, and MSHA. The 
in-mine testing verified the new sampling device to be accurate and reliable, 
ergonomically acceptable to miners, and sufficiently durable to withstand the rigors of 

 

38

the underground environment.  This testing demonstrated that the new CPDM is suitable 
for use in coal mines to monitor and prevent overexposure to respirable coal mine dust.3 
MSHA recognizes that the CPDM is a new technology and that there are only a 

few hundred of these devices currently in use.  However, the proposed rule would require 
the operator to use the CPDM to sample certain underground occupations, after a 12 or 
18-month phase-in period, unless notified by the Secretary.  MSHA believes that the 
proposed phase-in periods would allow the manufacturer enough time to produce the 
necessary quantity of CPDMs, and MSHA and operators enough time to train necessary 
personnel in the use and care of the device. 

MSHA recognizes that availability of the device may present logistical and other 

issues at the time the final rule becomes effective.  The Agency intends to address the 
issue of availability in two ways.  First, the proposal would require the use of the CPDM 
to sample (1) the Designated Occupation in each MMU, and (2) each Other Designated 
Occupation, within a 12-month and 18-month period, respectively, unless notified by the 
Secretary.  If, during the phase-in periods, MSHA determines that there would be 
logistical and feasibility issues surrounding the availability of CPDMs by the time these 
provisions of the final rule would become effective, the Agency will, through publication 
in the Federal Register, notify the public of the Agency’s plans.  Second, assuming no 
logistical or feasibility issues concerning the availability of CPDMs, and depending on 
manufacturer projections, if CPDMs are not available in sufficient quantities, MSHA 
would accept, as good faith evidence of compliance with the final rule, a valid, bona fide, 
written purchase order with a firm delivery date for the CPDMs.  Finally, the Agency has 
specifically included a request for comment on the proposed phase-in period in the 
preamble to the proposed rule. 
 

CONCLUSION 

Sampling data indicate that not only are mine operators keeping miners’ 

exposures at or below levels required under the existing standards, but dust exposures at 
most operations average less than the proposed standard of 1.0 mg/m3.  Thus, the 
majority of miners’ exposures are at or below the limits in the proposed rule.  In addition, 
existing engineering controls including ventilation, sprays and environmentally 
controlled cabs along with changes in work practices can be used to further reduce dust 
levels.  Therefore, MSHA has preliminarily concluded that it is technologically feasible 
for the coal mining industry to reduce miners’ exposure in underground and surface coal 
mines to the proposed respirable dust limits and maintain compliance on each work shift 
as prescribed in the proposed rule. 

While technologically feasible, MSHA acknowledges that operators will 
encounter implementation issues, in particular those operations in which average 
exposures currently exceed the proposed lower limit, as they attempt to achieve

compliance with the new limits.  MSHA believes that using currently available dust 
controls, which NIOSH studies indicate offer substantial exposure reduction, in 
combination with good work practices, will permit these operations to achieve 
compliance on each shift.  These dust controls are discussed in several NIOSH 
publications and available as free downloads from the Agency’s web site  
(http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/topics/topicpage3.htm).  Furthermore, MSHA believes 
that the two-year phase-in period to allow operators time to come into compliance with 
the proposed 1.0 mg/m3 standard would give operators sufficient time to either upgrade 
controls or to install additional measures to comply with the proposed standard. 

 Lowering the exposure limits in phases, as has been proposed, would permit all 
operators to properly assess and implement control measures appropriate for their mines 
and make necessary operational modifications to meet the proposed limits on each work 
shift when they become effective.  Use of the CPDM, over the 12 to 18 month phase-in 
period required by the proposed rule and in conjunction with currently available control 
measures, would enable the operator to better monitor dust exposures during the shift and 
be proactive in taking appropriate corrective measures during the shift to prevent possible 
overexposures.  MSHA also believes that the proposed phase-in period for the CPDM 
would allow manufacturers enough time to produce the necessary quantity of devices, 
and MSHA and operators enough time to train necessary personnel in the use and care of 
the CPDM.

INTRODUCTION 

V. COMPLIANCE COSTS 

This section presents MSHA’s estimates of costs that would be incurred by 

underground and surface coal operators to comply with the proposed coal mine dust rule.  
These costs are based on the assessment of MSHA staff of the most likely actions that 
would be necessary to comply with the proposed rule.  MSHA acknowledges that in rare 
instances, after taking these projected actions, some mine operators may need to take 
additional measures to comply.  In order to illustrate the full range of possible 
compliance costs, this section also includes a discussion of three potential situations 
where some operators could incur additional costs.  All three of the following situations 
are in underground coal mines: (1) longwall mines that have two entries; (2) mines that 
have multiple MMUs on a single split of air; and (3) mines operating under reduced 
respirable coal dust standards below 1.0 mg/m3 due to the presence of quartz.    

MSHA presents two values for the engineering and work practice estimates and 

the total cost estimates for underground coal mines.  The lower value represents MSHA’s 
most likely estimate.  The higher value includes additional costs for those rare instances 
where some operators after taking these actions may encounter implementation issues as 
they attempt to comply with the proposed requirements and need to take additional 
measures to comply with the proposed standard.    

MSHA estimates that the first year cost of the proposed rule would be 

approximately $72.4 to $93.2 million (see Table V-1) and the annualized cost of the 
proposed rule would be approximately $40.4 to $44.5 million (see Table V-2).

The estimated first year costs of the proposed rule for underground coal mine 
operators would be approximately $63.6 to $84.4 million.  Costs associated with the 
proposed requirement to use CPDMs ($51.5 million) and upgrading and maintaining 
existing engineering controls and work practices ($12.6 to $33.4 million) represent the 
most significant first year costs for underground coal operators. 

The first year costs of the proposed rule for surface coal mine operators would be 

approximately $8.8 million.  The proposed expansion of the Part 90 transfer option to 
surface miners represents the most significant first year cost for surface operators.

MSHA estimates that at a 7% discount rate, the annualized costs of the proposed 
rule for underground coal mine operators would be approximately $35.6 to 39.7 million.  
See Table V-2.  Costs associated with the proposed requirement to use CPDMs ($24.8 
million) and  upgrading and maintaining existing engineering controls and work practices 
($5.1 to 9.1 million) represent the most significant annualized costs for underground coal 
operators. 

MSHA estimates that at a 7% discount rate, the annualized costs of the proposed 

rule for surface coal operators would be approximately $4.8 million.  See Table V-2.  
Costs associated with the proposed expansion of the Part 90 transfer option to surface 
miners ($1.9 million) represent 40 percent of the total annualized costs for surface 
operators. 
 

METHODOLOGY 

For this Preliminary Regulatory Economic Analysis (PREA), MSHA annualized costs 

using the annualization formula: 

a = (i * (1 + i)n) /((1 + i)n - 1), 

where “a” equals the annualization factor, “i” equals the annual discount rate of 7% (as 
recommended by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for private investment 
discounting), and “n” equals the service life of the equipment or time horizon of the analysis.     
MSHA used two specific annualization factors for equipment costs: 0.244 for equipment 

Several provisions result in costs that occur every year, but begin at some time in 

with a 5 year service life and 0.142 for equipment with a 10 year service life (both using a 
7 percent discount rate).  For example, the annualized cost of a $1,000 piece of equipment that 
has a service life of 5 years would be $244 ($1,000 x 0.244).    
 
the future.  For these provisions, MSHA calculated the present value of the costs 
occurring each year over a 10 year period4, summed the present values and then 
annualized the sum of the present values.  For example, the cost of filters for CPDMs to 
monitor the DOs would begin after 12 months and the costs for filters for CPDMs to 
monitor ODOs would begin after 18 months.  If the cost of filters is $100 per year 
beginning in the second year, the present value of the costs of these filters for 10 years 
would be about $651 (the sum of the present value of a $100 expenditure in year two - 
about $93.50, the present value of $100 in year three - about $87.30…, the present value 
of $100 in year 10 - about $54.40).  Annualizing the present value of $651 over 10 years 
yields an annualized cost of about $92.50 ($651 x 0.142).  Since this is the same result as 

                                                           
4 MSHA believes using a 10-year time horizon is a reasonable approach for converting costs beginning in 
the second year to equivalent costs beginning in the first year.  The life span of individual mines varies 
significantly, with some operating for very short periods and others for many years.  Assuming a longer 
time horizon would increase annualized costs (e.g., a 15-year time horizon would result in annualized costs 
of about $96.20 for a $100 expenditure beginning in the second year), while assuming a shorter time 
horizon would reduce annualized costs (e.g., a 5-year time horizon would result in annualized costs of 
about $82.60 for a $100 expenditure beginning in the second year). 

 

43

Costs that occur every year, such as maintenance and recordkeeping costs, are 

multiplying by a single discount factor of 0.925, for ease of calculations MSHA used two 
discount factors to calculate the present value of annual costs that begin in the future: 
0.925 for annual costs that begin in the second year and 0.859 for annual costs that begin 
after 18 months.  Both factors are based on a 7 percent rate. 
 
included in annualized costs.   
With respect to underground coal mines, MSHA based many of the estimated 
   
costs on the average number of mechanized mining units (MMUs) in operation from 
February 2009 through January 2010.  MSHA estimates that there are 881 MMUs: 
81 MMUs were in mines with 1-19 employees; 708 MMUs in mines with 20-500 
employees (of which 22 MMUs are longwall MMUs); and 92 MMUs in mines with 501+ 
employees (of which 20 MMUs are longwall MMUs).   

Some of the costs were based on the number of underground and surface coal 
mines (see Chapter 2, Tables II-1 and II-3) and on the estimated number of production 
shifts.  Based on MSHA data and experience, turnover rates of six percent for 
underground coal miners and three percent for surface coal miners were used in this 
analysis.  Unless otherwise noted the term shift used in this analysis refers to production 
shifts.  In addition, some of the totals in the tables may not sum due to rounding.

Cost to Install Engineering Controls to Meet Lower Respirable Dust Standards 

The proposed rule would lower the respirable dust standard for surface and 

underground mines. The proposal would phase in the lower standards from 2.0 mg/m3 to 
1.0 mg/m3 over a 24 month period as follows: 

•  2.0 mg/m3 on the effective date of the final rule; 
•  1.7 mg/m3 6 months after the effective date of the final rule; 
•  1.5 mg/m3 12 months after the effective date of the final rule; and 
•  1.0 mg/m3 24 months after the effective date of the final rule. 

The proposal would also lower the dust levels allowed in intake air courses, where belt 
air is used as an intake air course, and in areas where a Part 90 miner is working.  The standard 
would be lowered from 1.0 mg/m3 to 0.5 mg/m3 6 months after the effective date of the rule.  In 
addition to lowering the standards, the proposal would also change the way compliance is 
determined. 

•  Proposed §§ 70.201(e), 71.201(b) and 90.201(b) would require full-shift 

sampling. 

 

44

•  Proposed § 70.207(a) would require gravimetric sampling of MMUs during 

normal production shifts. 

•  Proposed §§ 70.207(e), 70.208(d), 70.209(c), 71.207(i), 72.800, 90.208(c) and 

90.209(c) would base noncompliance determinations on single samples. 

 

The proposed rule would lower the respirable dust standard when quartz is 

present.  As discussed previously for feasibility, these proposed changes would require 
mine operators to take additional steps to meet the proposed requirements.   Costs are 
presented for both typical operations and for operations that MSHA anticipates would 
incur above average costs (such as some operations operating under an existing reduced 
standard of less than 1.0 mg/m3).   Costs are presented separately for surface and 
underground operations by mine size. 

Some engineering controls would need to be applied throughout the mine, while 
others would be specific to an MMU.  The types of engineering controls that operators 
are expected to implement as a result of the proposed rule are discussed below along with 
their unit cost.  Tables are then presented showing MSHA’s estimate of the total costs, by 
mine size, to implement the engineering controls.  The discussion below first focuses on 
underground coal mines and then on surface coal mines. 

Underground Coal Mines 

The use of engineering controls to curb dust levels at mechanized mining units 
(MMUs) is paramount to controlling dust levels in mines.  Traditionally, engineering 
controls have been successfully used to control respirable dust levels in mines.  
Comments to MSHA’s 2003 proposed rules on the Determination of Concentration of 
Respirable Coal Mine Dust (68 FR 10940) and Verification of Underground Coal Mine 
Operators' Dust Control Plans and Compliance Sampling for Respirable Dust (68 FR 
11770) noted how engineering controls have been used to address dust levels at MMUs.  
Changing air flows, redesigning cutting heads, controlling shearer speed, use of water 
sprays on shearers and belts, assessing the way water was being controlled at the stage 
loader, and even implementing water infusion with wetting agents that saturate the coal 
block, were mentioned in the comments as engineering controls that have been shown to 
decrease dust levels at MMUs. 

In order to comply with the lower proposed dust standards, coal operators would 

need to change or adjust dust control parameters that affect dust levels in the mine 
atmosphere.  In general, changing or adjusting dust control parameters focuses on the 
following areas:  ventilation; dust suppression; and dust collection. 
 

Controls Applied to Surface Areas of Underground Coal Mines 

Dust concentrations associated with mobile equipment and fixed locations at 

surface areas of underground coal mines can be controlled through the use of 
environmental cabs or enclosures.  The cabs and enclosures are outfitted with a filtration 
unit that removes dust from the outside air and provides a means to pressurize the cab to 
prevent outside dust from migrating inside.   

Based on data and enforcement experience, MSHA believes that all of the 

equipment currently being used at the surface areas of underground coal mines come 

 

45

equipped with the necessary cabs, but some cabs would require additional maintenance to 
meet the proposed standard.  MSHA estimates that the cab of 1 bulldozer operating at a 
mine with 1-19 employees would need to be refurbished by changing the interior lining 
of the cab and sealing all cracks and holes at a cost of $4,000. 

The cab of a bulldozer has two filters.  Air inside a cab can be compromised as a 

result of these filters not being changed at the appropriate time.  MSHA estimates that 
more frequent filter changes would be needed for:  1 bulldozer at a mine with 1-19 
employees; 1 bulldozer at a mine with 20-500 employees and 1 bulldozer at a mine with 
501+ employees.  Current practice is to change these filters once per month.  MSHA 
believes that in order to meet the proposed requirements, the filters would need to be 
changed once a week.  Thus, these filters would need to be changed an additional 3 times 
per month and it would take about 45 minutes (0.75 hours) to change the 2 filters.  At a 
cost of $50 per filter, MSHA estimates that the annual cost for more frequent filter 
changes would be $4,860 per machine [3 additional changes per mo. x 12 mos. x 
((2 filters x $50 per filter) + (0.75 hrs. x $35.98 hourly wage rate)]. 

MSHA estimates that 2 processing plants at mines with 20-500 employees and 

2 processing plants at mines with 501+ employees would need to repair 2 enclosures per 
plant.  Repairs consist of an underground surface mechanic, earning $35.98 per hour, 
working, on average, 4 hours to seal cracks and leaks.  MSHA estimates that the cost to 
repair 2 enclosures per plant would be $288 (4 hours of repairs x $35.98 hourly wage rate 
x 2 enclosures x 1 plant).  Also, MSHA estimates that 1 plant in a mine with 20-500 
employees would need a portable fan and associated tubing to capture localized welding 
fumes and/or grinding dust. 
 

Controls Applied at Underground Coal Mines 

 
Dust concentrations in underground coal mines can be controlled through a 

combination of ventilation, sprays and work practices.   Based on data and enforcement 
experience, MSHA has determined that all of these controls are currently in use at 
underground coal mines.  In order to comply with the proposed standard, most operators 
would have to make minor modifications and adjustments to existing equipment.  At 
some mines, particularly long walls and mines operating under reduced standards, 
operators would have to install additional equipment and modify their methods of 
mining.  (Comments to MSHA’s 2003 proposed rules on the Determination of 
Concentration of Respirable Coal Mine Dust and Verification of Underground Coal Mine 
Operators' Dust Control Plans and Compliance Sampling for Respirable Dust expressed 
concern over the excessive levels of respirable coal mine dust on longwall MMUs due to 
the amounts of dust being generated and the extended faces of some longwalls.)  

MSHA estimates that all underground mines (81 mines with 1-19 employees, 

331 mines with 20-500 employees, and 12 mines with 501+ employees) would need to 
adjust regulators to increase the air flow at the working areas of the mine.  MSHA 
estimates that it would cost $200 per mine to adjust regulators and take air readings to 
ensure that adjustments are correct. 
 
1-19 employees, 83 mines with 20-500 employees; and 3 mines with 501+ employees) 

MSHA estimates that approximately 25 percent of mines (20 mines with 

 

46

would need to install a water pressure pump to increase the flow rate and pressure of the 
water delivered to the MMU.  MSHA estimates that pumps range from $7,500 to $10,000 
(for an average of $8,750).  Each affected mine with 1-19 employees would need 
1 additional pump costing $8,750, while each mine with 20 or more employees would 
need 3 additional pumps per mine costing $26,250 (3 pumps x $8,750). 

MSHA estimates that 331 mines with 20-500 employees and 12 mines with 

501+ employees would need to adjust fan blades to increase the quantities of air delivered 
by the main and bleeder fans.  MSHA estimates that adjusting fan blades would cost $600 
per mine. 

MSHA also determined that some mines operating under an existing reduced 

standard due to the presence of quartz would incur additional costs to meet the proposed 
requirements.  Based on 2009 operator sample results, it is MSHA’s best judgment that 
3 mines (each with 20-500 employees) were on a reduced standard of 0.5 mg/m3 or below 
with 50% or more of their 2009 sample results exceeding the applicable standard.  
MSHA has determined that these 3 mines would need to take the additional step of 
installing a surfactant system to reduce the quartz content of the dust.  A surfactant 
system dispenses soaps and/or detergents at regular intervals into a water supply at a 
surface location of the mine and can then be delivered to MMUs operating in the mine.  
Surfactants are beneficial in controlling quartz after all other engineering controls have 
been implemented to control respirable dust.  Mixing water with surfactants decreases the 
surface tension of water, which allows the available moisture to wet more particles per 
unit volume.  MSHA estimates that the initial cost of constructing a surfactant system 
would be approximately $10,000.  Assuming 2 MMUs are operating per affected mine, 
MSHA estimates that the annual cost for chemicals to dispense into the water would be 
$96,000 ($4,000 per month x 12 months x 2 MMUs per mine).   

MSHA acknowledges that it is possible that additional mines operating under an 

existing reduced standard of below 1.0 mg/m3 may incur additional compliance costs 
because the proposed changes to the sampling strategy would take effect immediately 
(basing non-compliance on single full-shift samples; definition of normal production 
shift) before these operators have time to implement the engineering controls and work 
practices presented above.   It is possible that for the first year, some of these mines could 
be required to alter their production to minimize quartz exposures.   

Extracting coal from its natural deposits is currently being conducted by mining 

the full seam of coal and rock at a desired height.  The coal and rock are extracted 
simultaneously as the continuous mining machine cuts the coal and rock.  This process 
generates dust containing silica in addition to coal dust.  Under the proposed rule, some 
operators mining coal in this manner may need to change the way they mine coal to 
reduce the amount of silica in the air by using a technique called “cutting to an open 
face.”  This technique involves extracting the coal from its natural deposits without 
cutting the rock at the same time.  Once the coal is mined to the desired depth of the cut, 
the mining machine is brought back to the beginning of the cut to extract the rock 
resulting in less dust generation.   

MSHA estimates that this change in mining practices would decrease the amount 

of coal mined per shift by about 5 percent which would in turn result in increasing the 
operator’s cost per ton of coal mined.  This coal is not lost; the recovery of the coal is 

 

47

only delayed by the change to cutting to an open face.  MSHA has determined that, on 
average, the recovery of the coal will be delayed by about 5 years. 

MSHA projects that the operations with more than half of their samples above the 
applicable standard are the ones most likely to encounter problems during the transitional 
period.  In 2009, MSHA determined that 38 MMUs operating on a reduced standard 
below 1.0 mg/m3 had 50% or more of the operator sampling results exceeding the 
applicable standard.  All of these MMUs were in mines with 501+ employees and 
produced an average of 334,134 tons of coal.   

Controls Applied to MMUs in Underground Coal Mines 

 
MSHA estimates that all MMUs operating in underground coal mines (81 MMUs 

If half of the 38 MMUs would need to change their method of mining, this could 
result in additional compliance costs of $ 4.7 million (334,134 tons per year per MMU x 
0.05 x $51.35 per ton x 0.287 x  19 MMUs).  Amortizing these costs at 7 percent over 5 
years would result in additional annualized compliance costs of $1.1 million ($4.7 million 
x an annualization factor of 0.244). 
 
 
 
in mines with 1-19 employees, 708 MMUs in mines with 20-500 employees, and 
92 MMUs in mines with 501+ employees) would need to adjust the type and/or pressure 
of water sprays and increase the flow rate of sprays by changing the orifice size of the 
spray.  MSHA estimates that:  adjusting water sprays would cost $800 on a non-longwall 
MMU and $2,000 on a longwall MMU; increasing the flow rate of sprays by changing 
the orifice size of the spray would cost $300 on a non-longwall MMU and $800 on a 
longwall MMU. 

All non-longwall MMUs (81 MMUs in mines with 1-19 employees, 

686 non-longwall MMUs in mines with 20-500 MMUs and 72 non-longwall MMUs in 
mines with 501+ employees) would need to place belting over the throat of the 
continuous mining machine to reduce dust concentrations at an estimated cost of $300 
per MMU. 
 
All longwall MMUs (22 MMUs in mines with 20-500 employees and 20 MMUs 
in mines with 501+ employees) would need to install headgate shield detectors at a cost 
of $1,300 per MMU and a headgate scrubber system at a cost of $30,000 per MMU.      
 
MSHA estimates that 34 non-longwall MMUs in mines with 20-500 employees 
and 4 non-longwall MMUs in mines with 501+ employees need exhaust fans to operate 
on the MMU.  MSHA estimates that an exhaust fan costs $100,000 per MMU and tubing 
needed for the exhaust fan costs $7,500.  In addition, due to damage to tubing $750 of 
replacement tubing would be needed each year.  Also, additional electrical costs to 
operate an exhaust fan would be $100 per day.  MSHA estimates that additional annual 
electrical cost to operate an exhaust fan would be:  $30,000 per year for an MMU in a 
mine with 20-500 employees ($100 per day x 300 days); and $35,000 per year for an 
MMU in a mine with 501+ employees ($100 per day x 350 days). 

In addition, based upon the 2009 data, MSHA estimates that 4 non-longwall 

MMUs in mines with 1-19 employees and 25 non-longwall MMUs in mines with 
20-500 employees that operated on a reduced standard of 0.5 mg/m3 or less in 2009 
would need to change to a larger scrubber screen on the continuous mining machine and 
retrofit dust collectors on roof bolters to accommodate a bagging system in order to 

 

48

reduce the quartz content of dust on the MMU.  MSHA estimates that changing the 
scrubber screen size would cost $800 per continuous mining machine and retrofitting a 
dust collector on two roof bolter machines to accommodate a bagging system would cost 
$3,000 (1,500 per dust collector x 2 roof bolters per MMU).  The cost per MMU would 
be $3,800.  There is also an annual costs related to the bags for the dust collectors.  Two 
roof bolters operating on an MMU are assumed to use a total of 8 bags during a shift.  At 
a cost of $9 per bag, MSHA estimates that annual cost of bags for roof bolters per MMU 
would be:  $14,400 for an MMU in a mine with 1-19 employees (8 bags x $9 per bag x 
200 days); and $43,200 for an MMU in a mine with 20-500 employees (8 bags x $9 per 
bag x 300 days x 2 shifts per day). 

MSHA acknowledges that even with these controls, some longwall operators may 
have difficulty complying with the proposed standard.  In particular, the limited number 
of entries currently available at some longwall operations, may make it difficult to 
provide sufficient ventilation at the face.  Four underground coal mines in District 9 with 
20-500 employees operating longwall MMUs have only two entries.  In order to comply 
with the proposed rule, some of these mines may have to substantially increase the 
amount of air at the face.  Although MSHA believes that these mines have sufficient 
capacity to increase the amount of air delivered to their working sections, it may be 
possible that under the proposed rule one of these mines would find it necessary to sink 
an additional shaft and install additional fan capacity to provide the necessary ventilation.  
The cost of sinking a shaft and increasing fan capacity could range up to $10 million per 
mine.  The additional first year cost for this mine would be $10 million.  Amortizing this 
cost at 7 percent over 10 years would result in additional annualized compliance costs of 
$1.4 million. 
 

Proposed § 75.332 Working sections and working places 
Proposed § 75.332(a)(1) would require each MMU where mechanized mining 

equipment is being installed or removed to be ventilated by a separate split of intake air 
directed by overcasts, undercasts or other permanent ventilation controls.  The proposed 
definition of an MMU in § 70.2 states that when two sets of mining equipment are used 
in a series of working places within the same working section and only one production 
crew is employed, the two sets of equipment are identified as a single MMU but when 
two or more production crews are employed, each set of mining equipment would be 
identified as a separate MMU.  Under the existing standard, multiple sets of mining 
equipment are permitted to operate as a single MMU using a single split of air as long as 
they are not operating simultaneously.  The proposed changes would allow multiple sets 
of mining equipment to operate as a single MMU as long as one production crew is 
employed. 

MSHA believes that operators are unlikely to incur any increased costs for this 
proposal, since operators can use either one or two sets of equipment at each MMU, as 
long as they use only one production crew.  MSHA acknowledges, however, that during 
the transition to the new operating procedures, it is possible that some mines may 
experience production delays.  MSHA does not believe that any necessary production 
delay would be significant because, under the existing standard, the multiple sets of 
equipment can not be operated simultaneously if the MMU is supplied by a single split of 

 

49

air.  So the delay in production would be limited to the time it takes for one crew to move 
from one set of equipment to another.  MSHA estimates that the delay would average 
about 5 percent of the production and that it would take mine operators an average of one 
year to completely reconfigure their operations so that each MMU operates on a single 
set of equipment. 

MSHA assumes that the recovery of the coal will occur on average in about 

5 years.  Therefore, the cost of delaying production is the price of the coal production 
delayed minus the price of the coal expected to be recovered in 5 years discounted to its 
present value at 7 percent, which is determined by using a factor of 0.287 [1-(1/1.075)]. 
MSHA estimates that about 50 MMUs at mines with 20-500 employees currently 

have multiple MMUs on a single split of air.  If half of these MMUs would incur 
production delays of 5 percent during the first year, this could result in additional 
compliance costs of $ 6.2 million (334,134 tons per year per MMU x 0.05 x $51.35 per 
ton x 0.287 x 25 MMUs).  Amortizing these costs over at 7 percent 5 years would result 
in additional annualized compliance costs of $1.5 million ($6.2 million x an annualization 
factor of 0.244). 
 
Engineering Control Costs for Underground Coal Mines by Mine Size 

Underground Coal Mines with 1-19 Employees 
Table V-3 shows the costs of the engineering controls that would be expected to 
be used both underground and on the surface for underground coal mine operators with 
1-19 employees to meet the proposed standards requirements.  Table V-4 shows, for the 
same mine size, the costs for the engineering controls that would need to be implemented 
at each MMU.  The total costs for underground coal mine operators with 1-19 employees 
to implement engineering controls to meet with the proposed requirements are the sum of 
the costs from Tables V-3 and V-4.  First year costs are approximately $323,800 
($195,200 from Table V-3 + $128,600 from Table V-4).  First year costs were   
multiplied by a 5 year annualization factor of 0.244 based on 7 percent to arrive at 
approximately $79,000 ($47,600 from Table V-3 + $31,400 from Table V-4).  Annual 
costs are approximately $62,200 ($4,600 from Table V-3 + $57,600 from Table V-4).

Underground Coal Mines with 20-500 Employees 
Table V-5 shows the engineering controls and their costs, which would need to be 

implemented for underground coal mines with 20-500 employees to meet the proposed 
standards requirements.  Table V-6 shows, for the same mine size, the costs of the 
engineering controls that would need to be implemented by each MMU.  The total costs 
for underground coal mines with 20-500 employees to implement engineering controls to 
comply with the proposed requirements are the sum of the costs from Tables V-5 and 
V-6.  First year costs are approximately $8.3 million ($2.9 million from Table V-5 + 
$5.4 million from Table V-6).  First year costs were annualized by multiplying them by a 
5 year annualization factor of 0.244 based on 7 percent to arrive at $2.0 million 
($0.7 million from Table V-5 + $1.3 million from Table V-6).  Annual costs are 
approximately $2.4 million ($0.3 million from Table V-5 + $2.1 million from Table V-6).

Underground Coal Mines with 501+ Employees 
Table V-7 shows the costs of the engineering controls that would need to be 
implemented for underground coal mines with 501+ employees to meet the proposed 
standards requirements.  Table V-8 shows, for the same mine size, the costs for the 
engineering controls that would need to be implemented by each MMU.  The total costs 
for underground coal mines with 501+ employees to implement engineering controls to 
comply with the proposed requirements are the sum of the costs from Tables V-7 and 
V-8.  First year costs are approximately $1.3 million ($0.1 million from Table V-7 + 
$1.2 million from Table V-8).  First year costs were annualized by multiplying them by a 
5 year annualization factor of 0.244 based on 7 percent to arrive at $318,000 ($22,000 
from Table V-7 + $296,000 from Table V-8).  Annual costs are approximately $147,600 
($4,600 from Table V-7 + $143,000 from Table V-8).

Surface Coal Mines (including Surface Facilities) 

Most surface coal mine operators would not need to implement additional 
engineering controls to meet the proposed requirements.  However, there are some 
surface mines that MSHA has determined would need additional engineering controls for 
equipment (either bulldozers and/or highwall drills), plants and in shops that are on 
surface mine property.  The types of engineering controls along with their unit costs and 
where they apply are discussed below.  After the discussion, a table is presented showing 
cost estimates for the additional engineering controls that would be needed to meet the 
proposed requirements. 

MSHA estimates that 3 machines at mines with 20-500 employees and 1 machine 

at a mine with 501+ employees would need a new cab either because the machine 
currently does not have a cab or because the existing cab cannot be refurbished or 
repaired.  On average, MSHA estimates that installing a new cab on a machine would 
cost about $8,000. 

MSHA estimates that: 2 machines at mines with 1-19 employees; 8 machines at 

mines with 20-500 employees; and 4 machines at mines with 501+ employees would 
need refurbished cabs.  Refurbishing a cab would entail installing new interior, sealing 
cracks, and thoroughly cleaning the inside cab area.  On average, MSHA estimates that 
refurbishing a cab would cost about $4,000 (including labor). 

MSHA estimates that: 8 machines at mines with 1-19 employees; 24 machines at 

mines with 20-500 employees; and 8 machines at mines with 501+ employees would 
need cab repair.  Repairing an existing cab would entail sealing all cracks and cleaning 
the cab interior.  On average, MSHA estimates that it would take a surface mechanic, 
earning $32.97 per hour, 1 hour to repair an existing cab. 

   The need to frequently change the cabin and air conditioning filters on machines 

was discussed earlier when talking about operating machines efficiently at surface areas 

 

54

of underground coal mines.  Frequently changing these filters on machines for purposes 
of efficiency also applies to machines operated at surface coal mines.  MSHA estimates 
that:  10 machines in mines with 1-19 employees; 35 machines in mines with 20-500 
employees; and 20 machines in mines with 501+ employees would need more frequent 
filter changes.  Current practice is to change these filters once per month.  MSHA 
believes that in order to meet the proposed requirements, the filters would need to be 
changed once a week.  Thus, 3 additional changes per month are needed.  MSHA 
estimate that a surface mechanic would take 45 minutes (0.75 hours) to change both 
filters and that each filter cost about $50.  MSHA estimates that the annual costs to 
change these filters more frequently would be $4,490 [3 additional filter changes per mo. 
x 12 mos. x ((2 filters x $50 per filter) + (0.75 hrs. x $32.97 hourly wage rate))]. 

Engineering controls would also need to be installed in processing plants.  MSHA 

estimates that operators of 4 plants in surface mines with 20-500 employees and 1 plant 
in a mine with 501+ employees would need to repair 3 enclosures per plant.  In many 
cases operators place miners inside enclosures that are located inside the plant.  These 
enclosures protect miners from encountering the air outside the enclosure (which is the 
air inside the plant) that is compromised by dust and other airborne particles.  MSHA 
estimates that it would take a surface mechanic 4 hours to repair an enclosure.  MSHA 
estimates that the cost to repair 3 enclosures in a plant would be approximately $396 
(4 hrs. x $32.97 hourly wage rate x 3 enclosures). 

In addition, MSHA estimates that 1 processing plant and 2 shops in mines with 

20-500 employees and 1 plant in a mine with 501+ employees would need a portable 
exhaust fan and tubing to capture welding fumes and/or grinding dust.  The portable 
exhaust fan and tubing is mobile and can be place in different areas of the plant when 
problems with airborne particles arise.  MSHA estimates that each plant or shop would 
need 1 portable exhaust fan and tubing costing approximately $1,500. 

In areas of a plant or shop that continually have problems with airborne particles, 

it is better to build a stationary exhaust system for the problem area rather than 
purchasing a portable exhaust fan.  MSHA estimates that 4 shops in mines with 20-500 
employees would need to construct a stationary exhaust system.  MSHA estimates that it 
would take a surface welder, earning $34.49 per hour, an average of 8 hours to construct 
a stationary exhaust system.  The system would require $400 worth of sheeting material 
and $300 for a motor and exhaust fan.  MSHA estimates that constructing a stationary 
exhaust system in a shop would cost $976 [($400 for sheeting materials + $300 for 
exhaust motor and fan + (8 hours x $34.49 hourly wage rate)]. 
 

Engineering Costs for Surface Coal Mines by Mine Size 
Table V-9 shows the breakdown of MSHA’s estimated total cost for surface coal 

mines to implement engineering controls to comply with the proposed rule.   First year 
costs would be approximately $101,000, which when annualized are about $25,000.  
Annual costs are $292,000, and annualized costs (annualized first year costs plus annual 
costs) would be approximately $317,000 ($25,000 + $292,000).

Table V-10 shows that the costs for implementing engineering controls in the first 
year that the final rule is effective would be approximately $12.6 million for underground 
coal operators and $393,000 for surface coal operators (costs in the first year are the sum 
of the first year costs and annual costs).

Estimated Abatement Costs  

MSHA expects that operators would put in place additional engineering controls 
to comply with the proposed rule.  During the first few years that the proposed rule is in 
effect, operators would have to make adjustments to these engineering controls as they 
become more familiar with the appropriate controls.  During this transition, MSHA 
expects that operators would receive more citations for coal dust overexposures than 
under the existing standards. 

Under the proposed rule, an operator would receive a citation if the sample result 
exceeded the equivalent concentration value (ECV).  (An ECV is the lowest equivalent 
concentration measurement demonstrating that the applicable dust standard has been 
exceeded at a confidence level of at least 95 percent.)  If an operator receives a citation 
for excessive dust, the operator would be required to take corrective actions to address 
the problem.  After taking corrective actions, the operator would be required to sample to 
ensure that the problem has been corrected and that dust concentrations are at an 
acceptable level.   

Several provisions are triggered whenever sampling results exceed the applicable 

standard.  The requirements of proposed §§ 70.207(g), 70.207(h), 70.208(f), 70.209(e), 
70.209(f), 71.207(k), 71.207(l), 90.208(e), 90.208(f) and 90.209(e) would be triggered 
whenever a citation has to be abated.  The requirements of proposed §§ 70.207(i), 
70.208(g), 70.209(g), 71.207(m), 71.207(n), 90.208(g), and 90.209(f) would be triggered 
when sampling results exceed the applicable standard but are below the ECV.  In order to 
estimate the cost of these provisions, MSHA had to estimate the number of times the 
applicable standards would be exceeded. 

MSHA’s estimates are based on valid respirable dust samples collected by coal 

mine operators and processed by MSHA’s Standardized Information System (MSIS) 
during calendar year 2009.  Since the current 2.0 mg/m3 standard was in effect at the time 
the samples were collected, MSHA had to make several adjustments to the data to 

 

57

account for the proposed changes in both the level of the standard and the manner in 
which non-compliance determinations would be made. 

Under proposed § 72.800, MSHA would issue citations based on a single full-

shift sample of respirable coal mine dust rather than the average of five 8-hour samples.  
Using the same approach that was used previously for the single sample proposed rule 
(65 FR 42074), MSHA determined the number of additional violations that would occur 
if a single sample in each group of sampling results (usually 5 samples) exceeded the 
applicable ECV.  Only one violation was counted, even if multiple samples in the group 
exceeded the ECV. 

Under proposed §§ 70.201(e), 71.201(b) and 90.201(b) sampling devices would 
be worn from portal to portal and be required during the entire length of each sampled 
shift.  Since operator sampling in 2009 was for only 8 hours, MSHA adjusted the 
sampling results to account for full-shift sampling. 

Proposed § 70.2, would define “normal production shift” for underground mines 

as a production shift during which production equals either (1) at least the average 
production for the 30 most recent production shifts or (2) at least the average production 
for the “most recent production shifts” if 30 shifts of production data were not available. 
The underground operator sampling in 2009 only had to be conducted when production 
was at least 50 percent of the average production reported for the last set of five valid 
samples. With all else being equal, higher production levels result in higher exposure 
levels, so MSHA also adjusted the underground results to account for higher levels of 
production. 

 

Estimated Number of Additional Violations 

Due to the uncertainty involved in projecting dust levels several years in the 
future based upon these adjustments, MSHA only estimated the number of times the 
sampling results would result in violations of the applicable standards and did not try to 
estimate the small number of times the applicable standards would be exceeded but the 
results would be below the ECV.  MSHA believes that very few results (probably less 
than 5% of the projected number of citations) would be in the narrow range of exceeding 
the standard but below the ECV.  For similar reasons, MSHA only estimated the number 
of violations that would occur from exceeding the applicable ECVs and did not attempt to 
estimate the number of times a weekly accumulated exposure would exceed the 
permissible weekly accumulated exposure when none of the individual results exceed the 
applicable ECV.   Again, this number is likely to be quite small, probably less than 1% of 
the projected number of violations. 

 
Surface Coal Mines 
Under proposed § 72.800, noncompliance determinations would be based on 

single samples rather than the average of multiple samples.  MSHA used the experience 
gained during the 1998 Interim Single-Sample Enforcement Policy (ISSEP) to assess the 
impact of this proposed change.  As was noted in the preamble to the Single Sample 
Proposed Rule (65 FR 42074), MSHA only found 14 of the 4,500 surface entities (0.3%) 
sampled during the ISSEP to be out of compliance with the 2.0 mg/m3 standard when 
determinations of noncompliance were based on single samples.  Even though conditions 

 

58

have improved since ISSEP, MSHA used the noncompliance rate during that program to 
estimate the number of citations that would occur under the proposed rule.  Proposed 
§ 71.207(b) would increase the number of DWPs from 497 in 2009 to an estimated 3,019.  
MSHA applied the 0.3% rate during ISSEP to the 3,019 projected number of DWPs to 
arrive at an estimated 10 citations from basing noncompliance determinations on single 
samples. 

The proposed § 71.201(b) would require operators to take full-shift samples rather 

than 8 hour samples.  MSHA took 8-hour samples during ISSEP, so the estimate had to 
be adjusted to account for full-shift sampling.  MSHA used 2009 operator samples to 
develop an adjustment factor.  First MSHA determined that 40 individual 2009 samples 
were at or above the proposed ECV.  Next, MSHA assumed that each miner works an 
average shift of 10 hours and adjusted the data by multiplying each sample result by 1.25 
(i.e., 10 hours/8 hours).  This resulted in a doubling of the number of operator samples at 
or above the ECV.  Therefore, MSHA doubled the 10 citations projected from the ISSEP 
rate to arrive at an estimated 20 citations in a sampling period. 

Under the proposed rule, surface operators would have to sample each DWP four 
times during the first year.  MSHA inspects surface mines twice per year.  So there would 
be 6 sampling cycles per DWP during the first year.  MSHA projects that the number of 
estimated citations would decline by about 15% per sampling period, so that the number 
of violations would decline to 9 by the sixth sampling period, a reduction of 55% 
compared to the projected 20 citations in the first sampling period. 

 This resulted in an estimated 83 citations in the first year.  Although this estimate 
does not account for the proposed reduction of the standard to 1.7 mg/m3 after 6 months, 
based upon its feasibility assessment, MSHA projects that this would have a negligible 
impact on the number of citations given the current dust levels and the 6 month period 
mine operators would have to prepare for this standard. 

After one year, proposed § 71.100 would reduce the standard in the active 
workings of each surface mine to 1.5 mg/m3.  Based upon the 2009 data, MSHA 
estimates that the number of adjusted samples at or above the ECV would increase by 
75% under a 1.5 mg/m3 standard.   Multiplying the 9 citations projected in the last 
sampling period of the first year by 1.75, MSHA estimates that 16 citations would occur 
in the first sampling period of the second year.  MSHA again projects that the number of 
estimated citations would decline by about 15% per sampling period, so that the number 
of violations would decline to 7 by the sixth sampling period of the second year, a 
reduction of 55% compared to the projected 16 citations in the first sampling period. 

After two years, proposed § 71.100 would reduce the standard in the active 

workings of each surface mine to 1.0 mg/m3.  The number of adjusted 2009 operator 
samples at or above the ECV is 45% higher under a 1.0 mg/m3 standard compared to a 
1.5 mg/m3 standard.  Multiplying the estimated 7 citations projected during the last 
sampling period of the second year standard by 1.45, MSHA estimates that 10 citations 
would occur during the first sampling period of the third year.  MSHA projects that the 
number of estimated citations would decline by about 15% per sampling period, so that 
the number of violations would decline to 4 by the sixth sampling period of the third 
year, a reduction of 55% compared to the projected 10 citations in the first sampling 

 

59

period.  This would result in a projected total of 42 citations during the third year.  
MSHA expects that the number of citations would remain at about 4 per sampling period 
or 24 per year thereafter.

Numbers in Table may not sum due to rounding. 
1 The estimated number of compliance determinations is based on 3,019 DWPs being sampled 6 
times per year. 
2 The estimated compliance rate = 1 – (estimated number of citations divided by the estimated 
number of compliance determinations). 

 

In 2009 there were 7 citations.  Subtracting this baseline of 7 citations from the 
projected number of citations yields an estimate of the additional citations, e.g., in the 
first year MSHA projects 76 additional citations. 
 

Underground Coal Mines 
Under the proposed rule underground mines would have to sample the MMUs, 

outby DAs and intake air.   Based upon the feasibility analysis and an examination of the 
2009 data, MSHA does not anticipate an increase in the number of citations related to 
intake air.  The estimates for the additional citations related to the MMUs and the outby 
DAs are presented below. 

 

 

MMUs 

MSHA based the estimates of the additional citations related to the MMUs on 

sampling data for the DOs since the DOs are routinely exposed to the highest dust 
concentrations in the units.  MSHA used an approach similar to that presented above for 
surface mines to estimate the number of additional citations that would occur at 
underground mines under the proposed rule.  MSHA used the ISSEP experience and 
2009 operator data to assess the impact of the proposed standard.  However, as is 
discussed below, some slight differences in the methodology were necessary to account 
for the proposed requirement to use the CPDM. 

 

60

Under proposed § 72.800 noncompliance determinations would be based on 

single samples rather than the average of multiple samples.  The rate of noncompliance at 
underground mines during ISSEP was 11%.  As was done for the surface mines, MSHA 
used the noncompliance rate during that program to estimate the number of citations that 
would occur under the proposed rule even though conditions have improved since ISSEP.  
MSHA multiplied the 881 MMUs by the 11% ISSEP rate of noncompliance to arrive at 
an estimated 97 citations if noncompliance determinations were based on single samples. 

Since the proposed rule would also require that the samples be taken over a full-
shift (proposed § 70.201(e)) during normal production (proposed § 70.207(d)), MSHA 
made two adjustments to the 2009 operator data.  First, each sample result for non-
longwall MMUs was multiplied by 1.13 and each sample result for longwall MMUs was 
multiplied by 1.25 to account for sampling on shifts longer than 8 hours.  Then each 
adjusted result was multiplied by 1.16 (non-longwall) and 1.09 (longwall) to account for 
the change in the definition of normal production shift.  (The derivation of these factors 
was previously presented in the feasibility assessment.)  After applying the two factors to 
the 2009 sampling results, MSHA determined that the number of samples at or exceeding 
the ECV increased by 60% compare to the unadjusted data.  So MSHA multiplied the 
estimated 97 citations by 1.6 to get the adjusted estimate of 155 citations in the first 
sampling period during the first year. 

As mine operators and miners become familiar with the proposed methods of 

determining noncompliance based on full-shift single samples taken during normal 
production, the number of citations per sampling period should decrease.  Under the 
proposed rule, underground operators would have to sample each MMU six times during 
the first year.  MSHA inspects underground mines four times each year.  So there would 
be 10 sampling cycles per MMU during the first year.  MSHA projects that the number of 
estimated citations would decline by about 20% per sampling period during the first year, 
so that the number of violations would decline to 21 by the tenth sampling period, a 
reduction of 87% compared to the projected 155 citations in the first sampling period. 

 This resulted in an estimated 692 citations in the first year.  Although this 

estimate does not account for the proposed reduction of the standard to 1.7 mg/m3 after 6 
months, based upon its feasibility assessment, MSHA projects that this would have a 
negligible impact on the number of citations given the current dust levels and the 6 month 
period mine operators would have to prepare for this standard. 

 After 12 months, two additional changes would occur under the proposed rule.  

Proposed § 70.100 would reduce the standard in active underground workings to 1.5 
mg/m3 and proposed § 70.201(a) would require the CPDM to be used for all sampling of 
the DOs.  Using the CPDM would have two effects.  First miners would be sampled on 
every production shift rather than for 5 consecutive shifts each bi-monthly sampling 
period.  In addition, the CPDM would provide mine operators with information about the 
actual exposures of the DOs on a real-time basis and allow mine management to be 
proactive in taking corrective action during the shift to prevent possible overexposures.  
MSHA believes that after the mining community adjusts to the use of the CPDM no 
miner should ever be overexposed except due to the failure to pay attention to the CPDM 
display or due to some “emergency situation”.  However this adjustment would take 
some time. 

 

61

Based upon the 2009 data, MSHA estimates that the number of adjusted samples 

at or above the ECV is 25% higher under a 1.5 mg/m3 standard compared to the 2.0 
mg/m3 standard.   MSHA multiplied the 21 citations projected during the last (i.e., 10th) 
sampling period in year 1 by 1.25 to arrive at an estimated 26.25 citations in the first 
sampling period in year 2.  Proposed § 70.210(f) requires the CPDM sampling results to 
be transmitted to MSHA at the end of each week.  Therefore, for this analysis MSHA is 
considering a week to be the sampling period for the CPDM, so there are 52 sampling 
periods in a year.  As mine operators and miners become familiar with the CPDM, 
MSHA projects that the number of estimated citations would decline by about 2.0% per 
week during the second year.   By the end of the second year, MSHA projects that the 
number of citations would decline to 9.4 per week compared to 26.25 in week 1, a 
reduction of about 65%.  This would result in a projected total of 853 citations during the 
second year. 

  After 24 months, proposed § 70.100 would reduce the standard in active 

underground workings to 1.0 mg/m3.  Based upon the feasibility assessment, MSHA has 
determined that all mines should be able to meet the proposed standard.   With operators 
having two years to prepare for the proposed 1.0 mg/m3 standard combined with a full 
year of using the CPDM to sample DOs on every shift, there should not be a significant 
increase in the number of citations when the proposed standard would take effect. 
Nevertheless, in recognition of the fact that some operators may delay the 

implementation of the necessary controls to meet the proposed 1.0 mg/m3 standard (e.g., 
because they mistakenly believed the coal seam would be worked out before the standard 
took effect), MSHA projects a 50% increase in citations to 14.0 citations during the first 
week of the third year compared to 9.4 during the last week of the second year.  Once 
again, as mine operators adjust to the new standard, MSHA projects that this number 
would decline by about 2% per week during the third year.  By the end of the third year, 
MSHA projects that the number of citations would fall to 5 per week compared to 14 in 
week 1, a reduction of about 65%.  This would result in a projected total of 458 citations 
during the third year.  MSHA expects that the number of citations would remain at about 
5 per week or 260 per year thereafter.

Outby DAs 

Based upon the feasibility analysis and an examination of the 2009 data, MSHA 
anticipates few additional citations in the outby DAs.  In 2009, dust concentrations in the 
outby DAs averaged less than 1 mg/m3 and the compliance rate with the 2.0 mg/m3 
standard exceeded 99.5 percent.  As the feasibility analysis indicates, MSHA expects that 
mine operators would have little trouble complying with the proposed standard in the 
outby DAs.  For cost estimation purposes, MSHA assumed a 1% rate of noncompliance.  
Applying this rate to the 487 outby DAs and multiplying by 8 to account for the sampling 
periods each year (4 by the operator and 4 by MSHA) resulted in an estimated 39 
citations per year.

Part 90 Miners 
Proposed § 72.800 noncompliance determinations would be based on single 

samples rather than the average of multiple samples.  Proposed § 90.201(b) would require 
that the samples be taken over a full-shift and proposed § 90.100 would reduce the 
standard from 1.0 mg/m3 to 0.5 mg/m3 after one year.  However, based upon the 
feasibility analysis and an examination of the 2009 data, MSHA does not anticipate an 
increase in the number of citations related to Part 90 miners.  Moreover, proposed 
§ 90.201(a) would require the CPDM to be used for all sampling of Part 90 miners in the 
second year.  Given the low exposures found in 2009 sampling results for Part 90 mines, 
the availability of areas with even lower concentrations and the required use of the 

 

63

CPDM, MSHA believes that there is no reason for operators to allow the overexposure of 
Part 90 miners. 
 
Estimated Abatement Costs Resulting from Proposed Rule 

The estimated costs to abate the citations are presented below. The abatement 

costs consist of several items including modifying the mine ventilation and CPDM 
performance plans, taking corrective actions and validating the corrective actions by 
sampling the dust levels.   MSHA did not estimate the cost of the penalties resulting from 
the citations because the Agency considers penalties to be transfer payments (as are taxes 
and subsidies) and not to be social costs.  Moreover, based on the feasibility assessment, 
MSHA has determined that the technology exists to prevent miners from being exposed 
to respirable dust concentrations in excess of the proposed standards.  The estimates 
presented above were based upon the assumption that some operators would delay the 
implementation of the necessary controls and incur the projected additional citations. 

Costs in First Year - Resulting from Citations Received in the First Year 
As noted in the Tables V-12 to V-14, in the first year that the final rule becomes 
effective MSHA estimates that underground coal operators would receive 504 additional 
MMU and outby DA citations (48 citations in mines with 1-19 employees, 403 citations 
in mines with 20-500 employees; and 53 citations in mines with 501+ employees).  
Surface coal operations would receive 76 additional citations (38 citations in mines with 
1-19 employees, 32 citations in mines with 20-500 employees; and 6 citations in mines 
with 501+ employees).  Under the proposed rule operators would receive a citation when 
they meet or exceed the excessive concentration value (ECV).  To abate a citation 
operators would incur various costs for taking corrective actions, such as:  conducting 
abatement sampling (if using a gravimetric sampler); revising mine ventilation, dust 
control or CPDM plans (whichever is applicable); and making a record under existing 
§ 75.363. 

However, under the proposed rule many of the above costs would also be incurred 

by operators if they did not receive a citation but rather had a sample result that was 
above the applicable standard but below the ECV.  MSHA assumes that on average 
approximately 5 percent of the time an additional citation would be issued the sample 
exceeded the applicable standard but be below the ECV.  MSHA estimates that the 
number of times a sample result would be above the applicable standard but below the 
ECV in underground coal mines would be:  2 in mines with 1-19 employees; 20 in mines 
with 20-500 employees; and 3 in mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates that the 
number of times sample results would be above the applicable standard but below the 
ECV in surface coal mines would be:  2 in mines with 1-19 employees; 2 in mines with 
20-500 employees; and 1 in a mine with 501+ employees. 

Since the CPDM is not required until 12 months after the effective date of the 
final rule, the costs for abating a citation or obtaining a sample above the applicable 
standard but below the ECV during the first year were based on sampling with a 
gravimetric sampler.

Submit Corrective Actions - Proposed §§ 70.207(g)(2), 70.208(f)(3), 
70.209(e)(2), 71.207(k)(2), 90.208(e)(2), 90.209(e)(3) and Revising Mine 
Ventilation or Dust Control Plan – Proposed §§ 70.207(h), 70.209(f), 71.207(l), 
71. 300(a), 90.208(f), and 90.300(a) 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(g)(2), 70.209(e)(2), and 

90.208(e)(2)) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(k)(2)) would be 
required, during the abatement time fixed in a citation for violation of the applicable 
standard to submit corrective actions for MSHA approval.  Underground coal operators 
under proposed §§ 70.208(f)(3) and 90.209(e)(3) would be required to submit corrective 
actions for MSHA approval when a valid end-of-shift equivalent concentration 
measurement meets or exceeds the applicable ECV, or exceeds a weekly permissible 
accumulated exposure. 

Also, for underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(h), 70.209(f), 

90.208(f) and 90.300(a)) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(l), 
71.300(a), 90.208(f) and 90.300(a)), one of the conditions for terminating a citation for a 
violation of the applicable standard is when the underground operator has submitted 
revised dust control parameters as part of the mine ventilation plan, or a dust control plan 
or revisions, and when the surface operator has submitted a new or revised dust control 
plan applicable to the DWP or Part 90 miner identified in the citation. 

For underground coal operators, MSHA estimates the number of corrective action 
submissions, in the first year that the final rule is effective, would be:  48 submissions in 
mines with 1-19 employees; 403 submissions in mines with 20-500 employees; and 
53 submissions in mines with 501+ employees.  For surface coal operators, MSHA 
estimates the number of corrective action submissions, in the first year that the final rule 
is effective, would be:  38 submissions in mines with 1-19 employees, 32 submissions in 
mines with 20-500 employees; and 6 submissions in mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that a supervisor (earning $84.70 per hour in an underground 

coal mine and $69.98 per hour in a surface coal mine) would take 15 minutes 
(0.25 hours) to write up the corrective actions for submission; and a clerical employee 
(earning $26 per hour in an underground coal mine and $25.45 in a surface coal mine) 
would take 6 minutes (0.1 hours) to submit the corrective actions.  In addition, MSHA 
estimates that copy and postage costs are $1.30 per submission [(2 pages x $0.15 per 
page) + $1 postage]. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to submit corrective actions in the first year that the 

final rule is effective would be approximately $12,600 for underground coal operators 
and $1,600 for surface coal operators.  These figures consist of: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,204 in mines with 1-19 employees [48 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x  
$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; 

•  $10,105 in mines with 20-500 employees [403 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; and, 

•  $1,329 in mines with 501+ employees [53 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x 
$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]. 

 

65

Surface operators: 
•  $811 in mines with 1-19 employees [38 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x $69.98 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; 

•  $683 in mines with 20-500 employees [32 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$69.98 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; and, 

•  $128 in mines with 501+ employees [6 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x $69.98 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]. 

 

Implement Corrective Actions - Proposed §§ 70.207(g)(3), 70.207(i)(2), 
70.209(e)(3), 71.207(k)(3), 90.208(g)(2) and 90.208(e)(2)(i) 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(g)(3), 70.209(e)(3), and 

90.208(e)(2)(i)) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(k)(3)) upon 
issuance of a citation for a violation of the applicable standard and after receiving the 
District Manager’s approval of the submitted corrective actions would be required to 
implement the corrective actions.  In addition, underground coal operators (under 
proposed §§ 70.207(i)(2) and 90.208(g)(2) would be required to take corrective action 
when the result of sample results collected by the operator indicate that the equivalent 
concentration of one or more valid samples are above the applicable standard but below 
the ECV. 

The costs for meeting the proposed standards were presented previously.  MSHA 
assumes that the corrective actions that would be taken by both underground and surface 
operators in response to samples above the standards would be to adjust the existing 
controls.  In underground coal mines, these corrective actions could consist of:  adjusting 
regulators and then taking readings; adjusting the type, flow rate and/or pressure of water 
sprays and changing sprays to increase flow rate.  In surface coal mines, the corrective 
actions could consist of cleaning and/or repairing cabs; and changing filters.   MSHA 
estimates that, on average, the cost (including labor) for corrective actions would be 
approximately $1,000 in an underground coal mine and $500 in a surface coal mine. 

Since corrective actions would need to be implemented when sample results are 
above the applicable standard and when they meet or exceed the ECV, MSHA estimates 
that the number of corrective actions required in underground coal mines would be:  
50 (48 + 2) in mines with 1-19 employees; 423 (403 + 20) in mines with 20-500 
employees; and 56 (53 + 3) in mines with 501+ employees.  In surface coal mines, 
MSHA estimates that the number of corrective actions required would be:  38 in mines 
with 1-19 employees; 32 in mines with 20-500 employees; and 6 in mines with 501+ 
employees. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to implement corrective actions in the first year that 

the propose rule is effective would be approximately $529,000 for underground coal 
operators and $38,000 for surface coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown 
below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $50,000 in mines with 1-19 employees (50 corrective actions x $1,000); 

 

66

•  $423,000 in mines with 20-500 employees (423 corrective actions x $1,000); and, 
•  $56,000 in mines with 501+ employees (56 corrective actions x $1,000). 
Surface operators: 
•  $19,000 in mines with 1-19 employees (38 corrective actions x $500); 
•  $16,000 in mines with 20-500 employees (32 corrective actions x $500); and, 
•  $3,000 in mines with 501+ employees (6 corrective actions x $500). 

 

Conducting Sampling - Proposed §§ 70.207(c)(2), 70.207(g)(3), 70.209(b)(2), 
70.209(e)(3), 90.208(b)(2), 90.208(e)(2)(i), 71.207(k)(3), and 71.207(m) 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(g)(3), 70.209(e)(3), and 

90.208(e)(2)(i)) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(k)(3)) would be 
required to take five abatement samples upon issuance of a citation for a violation of the 
applicable standard.  In addition, underground coal operators (under proposed 
§§ 70.207(c)(2), 70.209(b)(2) and 90.208(b)(2)) and surface coal operators (under 
proposed § 71.207(m)) would be required to take five samples if any sample result from 
the most recent bimonthly sampling period is above the new applicable standard. 

Operators would be required to take additional samples whenever the standard is 
exceeded, whether or not this results in a citation for noncompliance.   For underground 
coal mines, MSHA estimates that the number of occasions where five samples are taken 
would be:  50 occasions (48 + 2) in mines with 1-19 employees; 423 occasions (403 + 
20) in mines with 20-500 employees; and 56 occasions (53 + 3) in mines with 501+ 
employees. 

However, MSHA does not estimate any additional sampling for surface coal 

mines in the first year that the final rule is effective.  Existing § 71.208(c) requires that 5 
additional samples be taken whenever a result exceeds the applicable standard.   Since the 
sampling required by the proposed rule when a sample exceeds the applicable standard 
during the first six months would have also been required under existing regulations, 
there is no change.  After six months, the proposed rule would reduce the standard to 
1.7 mg/m3.  Based upon an examination of 2009 operator sampling results, MSHA has 
determined that very little additional sampling would be needed during this six month 
period because very few results would fall in the narrow range of 1.7 mg/m3 to 
2.0 mg/m3.   During the first year of the final rule, MSHA assumes that very little 
additional sampling above what is currently being done would be needed at surface 
mines.  MSHA did not take the existing sampling due to results above the existing 
applicable standard into account when developing the estimates in the subsequent years.  
Therefore, any underestimate of the costs during the first year would be more than 
compensated for by the overestimate of the costs during the subsequent years. 

MSHA based the additional sampling costs for underground mines on the use of 
the gravimetric sampler.  On average, MSHA estimates that it would take approximately 
1 hour to prepare the gravimetric sampler and perform the required checks during 
sampling.  This time period includes 50 minutes (0.8333 hours) of a certified dust 
technician’s time to prepare, disassemble, and clean the sampling unit after completion of 
sampling.  In addition, it would take a mine supervisor 10 minutes (0.1666 hours) to 

 

67

make the required operational checks of the sampling device during the shift.  A certified 
dust technician’s hourly wage is estimated to be $31.77 per hour in an underground coal 
mine.  A supervisor’s hourly wage is estimated to be $84.70 in an underground mine.  
The cost for each filter for a gravimetric sampler is $19.89.  Also with each sample a 
control filter is needed costing an additional $19.89.  MSHA estimates that the cost to 
take a sample is $80.36 ($31.77 per hr. x 0.8333 hrs. + $84.70 per hr. x 0.1666 hrs. + 
$19.89 per filter + $19.89 per control filter) for underground mines.  Five samples are 
taken each time sampling is conducted with the gravimetric sampler. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to conduct sampling in the first year that the final 

rule is in effect would be approximately $212,600 for underground coal operators.  Costs 
for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 

•  $20,090 in mines with 1-19 employees (50 occasions x 5 samples x $80.36 cost to 

sample); 

•  $169,961 in mines with 20-500 employees (423 occasions x 5 samples x 

$80.36 cost to sample); and 

•  $22,501 in mines with 501+ employees (56 occasions x 5 samples x $80.36 cost 

to sample). 

 

Completing Dust Data Card and Sending Sample and Card to MSHA – Proposed 
§§ 70.210(c), 71.208(c), and 90.210(c) 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.210(c) and 90.210(c)) and 

surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.208(c)) must complete a dust data card and 
submit the card to MSHA along with the sample.  As noted above, since there is no 
additional sampling in surface coal mines in the first year of the final rule there is no cost 
for completing dust data cards and for sending them to MSHA along with the samples. 

The person completing the dust data card in underground coal mines is a certified 
dust technician with an estimated hourly wage of $31.77.   On average, MSHA estimates 
that a certified dust technician would take 6 minutes (0.1 hours) to complete the dust data 
card, sign it and send it along with the sample to MSHA.  After filling out the dust data 
card, a certified person signs the card and writes the certification number on it.  On 
average, MSHA estimates that a certified person (normally the mine safety inspector or 
an equivalent person) would take 1.5 minutes (0.025 hours) to review and sign the dust 
data card.  A supervisor’s hourly wage is estimated to be $84.70 in an underground mine.  
MSHA estimates postage costs at $1 per sample mailed. 

The estimated number of dust data cards equals the number of samples taken.  
Therefore, for underground coal mines, MSHA estimates that the number of dust data 
cards to complete, sign, and send would be:  250 dust cards (50 occasions x 5 samples) in 
mines with 1-19 employees; 2,115 dust cards (423 occasions x 5 samples) in mines with 
20-500 employees; and 280 dust cards (56 occasions x 5 samples) in mines with 501+ 
employees. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to complete, sign, and send dust data cards, along 

with samples, to MSHA in the first year that the final rule is in effect would be 

 

68

approximately $16,650 for underground coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are 
shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,574 in mines with 1-19 employees [250 dust cards x ((0.1 hrs. x $31.77 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.025 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate) + $1)]; 

•  $13,313 in mines with 20-500 employees [2,115 dust cards x ((0.1 hrs. x 

$31.77 hourly wage rate) + (0.025 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate) + $1)]; and 

•  $1,762 in mines with 501+ employees [280 dust cards x ((0.1 hrs. x $31.77 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.025 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate) + $1)]. 

 

Posting Sample Results – Proposed §§ 70.211(b), 71.209(b), and 90.211(b) 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.211(b)) and surface coal 

operators (under proposed § 71.209(b)) must post sample results.  Proposed § 90.211(b) 
requires mine operators to provide Part 90 miners with a copy of the sample results.  As 
noted above, since there is no additional sampling in surface coal mines in the first year 
of the final rule there is no cost for posting sample results. 

For purposes of this cost analysis, MSHA assumes that it would take the same 

amount of time to provide a copy of the sample results to the Part 90 miner as it does to 
post the sample results on the mine bulletin board.  On average, MSHA estimates that a 
clerical employee would take 0.1 hours (6 minutes) to copy and post the sample results.  
Photocopying costs are estimated to be $0.15 per page.  MSHA’s current practice is to 
transmit the sampling results to the operator in a group, so the number of postings equate 
to the number of occasions when samples have to be taken.  In underground coal mines, 
MSHA estimates that there would be:  50 postings (48 + 2) in mines with 1-19 
employees; 423 postings (403 + 20) in mines with 20-500 employees; and 56 postings 
(53 + 3) in mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to post sample results in the first year that the rule 

is in effect would be approximately $1,500 for underground coal operators.  Costs by 
mine size are shown below: 
Underground operators: 
•  $138 in mines with 1-19 employees [50 postings x ((0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage 

rate) + $0.15)]; 

•  $1,163 in mines with 20-500 employees [423 postings x ((0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate) + $0.15)]; and 

•  $154 in mines with 501+ employees [56 postings x ((0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage 

rate) + $0.15)]. 

 

Make Existing § 75.363 Record -  Proposed §§ 70.207(i)(3) and 90.208(g)(3) 
Under proposed §§ 70.207(i)(3) and 90.208(g)(3), when sample results collected 
by the underground coal operator indicate the equivalent concentration of a sample result 
is above the applicable standard but below the ECV a record of the corrective actions 

 

69

taken must be made in the same manner as the record required by existing § 75.363.  For 
underground coal mines, MSHA estimates there would be:  2 records in mines with 1-19 
employees; 20 records in mines with 20-500 employees; and 3 records in mines with 
501+ employees. 

Under existing § 75.363 a certified person would make the record and the record 
must be countersigned by a mine foreman or equivalent mine official.  MSHA estimates 
that a certified person (earning a supervisor’s wage rate) would take 6 minutes (0.1 hrs.) 
to make the record; and a mine official (also earning a supervisor’s wage rate) would take 
3 minutes (0.05 hrs.) to countersign the record. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to make a record as required by existing § 75.363 in 
the first year that the rule is in effect would be approximately $350 for underground coal 
operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $25 in mines with 1-19 employees [2 records x ((0.1 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.05 hrs. x $84.79 hourly wage rate))]; 

•  $254 in mines with 20-500 employees [20 records x ((0.1 hrs. x $84.70 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.05 hrs. x $84.79 hourly wage rate))]; and 

•  $38 in mines with 501+ employees [3 records x ((0.1 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.05 hrs. x $84.79 hourly wage rate))]. 

 

Operator Adjustments to Plan – Proposed §§ 70.207(c)(2), 70.209(b)(2),  
71.207(h)(2),  and 90.208(b)(2) 
For underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(c)(2), 70.209(b)(2), 

and 90.208(b)(2)) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(h)(2)), if a sample 
result is above the new applicable standard, the underground coal operator must make 
necessary adjustments to the dust control parameters in the mine ventilation plan and the 
surface coal operator must revise the dust control parameters. 

MSHA estimates that in underground coal mines operators would make 

adjustments on:  2 occasions in mines with 1-19 employees; 20 occasions in mines with 
20-500 employees; and 3 occasions in mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates 
that surface coal operators would revise plans on:  2 occasions in mines with 1-19 
employees; 2 occasions in mines with 20-500 employees; and 1 occasion in a mine with 
501+ employees.  On average, MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor (earning 
$84.70 per hour in an underground mine and $69.98 per hour in a surface mine) 
15 minute (0.25 hrs.) to make adjustments. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to revise plans in the first year that the rule is in 

effect would be approximately $500 for underground coal operators and $100 for surface 
coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $42 in mines with 1-19 employees [2 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; 

 

70

•  $424 in mines with 20-500 employees [20 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $84.70 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; and 

•  $64 in mines with 501+ employees [3 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]. 

Surface operators: 
•  $35 in mines with 1-19 employees [2 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $69.98 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; 

•  $35 in mines with 20-500 employees [2 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $69.98 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; and 

•  $17 in mines with 501+ employees [1 plan x ((0.25 hrs. x $69.98 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]. 

 

Notify Representative of the Miners – Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(i), 75.370(f)(1), 
and 90.301(d) and Proposed §§ 71.300(a)(1), and 71.301(d)(1) 
Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(i) and 75.370(f)(1) for underground coal operators and 

proposed §§ 71.300(a)(1) and 71.301(d)(1) for surface coal operators would require 
operators to notify the representative of miners of a plan revision.  Existing § 90.301(d) 
requires a copy of the dust control plan be provided to the Part 90 miner.  MSHA 
estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to notify and 
provide a copy of the plan to the representative of the miners or Part 90 miner.  MSHA 
assumes that all miners’ representatives would request a copy of the plan.  MSHA 
estimates that copy costs are $0.30 (2 pgs. x $0.15).  There are no postage costs because 
MSHA assumes that a copy of the plan would be given to the representative of the miners 
at the mine site. 

MSHA estimates that the number of notifications would be equal to the number of 

corrective actions submitted, which was determined above.  For underground coal 
operators there would be:  48 notifications in mines with 1-19 employees; 
403 notifications in mines with 20-500 employees; and 53 notifications in mines with 
501+ employees.  For surface coal mines, there would be:  38 notifications in mines with 
1-19 employees; 32 notifications in mines with 20-500 employees; and 6 notifications in 
mines with 501+ employees. 

In the first year that the rule is in effect, MSHA estimates that the cost to notify 

the miner representative and provide a copy if requested would be approximately $3,400 
for underground coal operators and $500 for surface coal operators.  Costs for each mine 
size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $326 in mines with 1-19 employees [48 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $2,740 in mines with 20-500 employees [403 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x 

$26 hourly wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $360 in mines with 501+ employees [53 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]. 

 

71

Surface operators: 
•  $253 in mines with 1-19 employees [38 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $213 in mines with 20-500 employees  [32 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x 

$25.45 hourly wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $40 in mines with 501+ employees [6 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]. 

 

Post Copy of Plan Revision – Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(iii), and 75.370(f)(3) and 
Proposed §§ 71.300(a)(3), and 71.301(d)(3) 
Underground coal operators under existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(iii) and 75.370(f)(3) 
and surface coal operators under proposed §§ 71.300(a)(3), and 71.301(d)(3) would be 
required to post a copy of the proposed or revised plan on the mine bulletin board.  
MSHA estimates that in underground coal mines there would be:  48 posting in mines 
with 1-19 employees; 403 postings in mines with 20-500 employees; and 53 postings in 
mines with 501+ employees.  In surface coal mines, MSHA estimates there would be:  
38 postings in mines with 1-19 employees; 32 postings in mines with 20-500 employees; 
and 6 postings in mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to 

copy, and post.  Copy costs are $0.30 (2 pgs. x $0.15).  There are no postage costs.  
MSHA estimates that cost to copy and post in the first year the final rule is effective 
would be approximately $3,400 for underground coal operators and $500 for surface coal 
operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $326 in mines with 1-19 employees [48 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage 

rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $2,740 in mines with 20-500 employees [403 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $360 in mines with 501+ employees [53 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage 

rate + $0.30)]. 
Surface operators: 
•  $253 in mines with 1-19 employees [38 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $213 in mines with 20-500 employees  [32 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $40 in mines with 501+ employees [6 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage 

rate + $0.30)]. 

 

Costs in Second Year - Resulting from Citations Received in the Second Year 
As shown in Tables V-13 and 14 above in the second year that the final rule 
becomes effective MSHA estimates that underground coal operators would receive 

 

72

666 additional citations (629 additional MMU citations plus 37 additional DA citations).  
MSHA estimates there would be:  63 citations in mines with 1-19 employees; 533 
citations in mines with 20-500 employees; and 70 citations in mines with 501+ 
employees.  Surface coal operations would receive 59 additional DWP citations:  
30 citations in mines with 1-19 employees; 25 citations in mines with 20-500 employees; 
and 4 citations in mines with 501+ employees.  Like the first year, under the proposed 
rule operators would receive a citation when they meet or exceed the excessive 
concentration value (ECV). 

As was previously discussed, MSHA estimates that for every 20 additional 
citations there would be an instance where a sample result exceeds the applicable 
standard but is below the ECV.  MSHA estimates that the sample result would be above 
the applicable standard but below the ECV in underground coal mines on:  3 occasions in 
mines with 1-19 employees; 27 occasions in mines with 20-500 employees; and 
4 occasions in mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates that the sample result 
would be above the applicable standard but below the ECV in surface coal mines on 
2 occasions in mines with 1-19 employees; 1 occasion in a mine with 20-500 employees; 
and 1 occasion in a mine with 501+ employees. 

Since the majority of the additional citations for underground mines in the second 

year are expected to result from DO samples taken with the CPDM, MSHA based the 
abatement costs for underground coal operators on the use of the CPDM.   Surface coal 
operators in the second year of the final rule are still expected to use the gravimetric 
sampler for DWP sampling so MSHA based the abatement costs for surface coal 
operators on the use of the gravimetric sampler. 
 

Submit Corrective Actions and Revise Mine Ventilation or Dust Control Plan - 
Proposed §§ 70.208(f)(3), 71.207(k)(2), 90.209(e)(3), 90.300(a) 
Proposed § 70.208(f)(3) would require underground coal operators to submit 

corrective actions to the District Manger for approval when a valid end-of-shift 
equivalent concentration measurement meets or exceeds the applicable ECV, or a weekly 
accumulated exposure exceeds the weekly permissible accumulated exposure.  Proposed 
§ 90.209(e)(3) would require underground coal operators to submit corrective actions if 
the corrective action involve implementation of dust control measures.  Under proposed 
§ 90.300(a) operators must submit or revise dust control plans for the Part 90 miner 
identified in a citation.  Proposed § 71.207(k)(2) would require surface coal operators to 
submit corrective actions upon receiving a citation for a violation of the applicable 
standard. 

For underground coal operators, MSHA estimates the number of corrective action 

submissions in the second year that the final rule is effective would be:  63 submissions 
in mines with 1-19 employees; 533 submissions in mines with 20-500 employees; and 
70 submissions in mines with 501+ employees.  For surface coal operators, MSHA 
estimates the number of corrective action submissions in the second year that the final 
rule is effective would be:  30 submissions in mines with 1-19 employees; 
25 submissions in mines with 20-500 employees; and 4 submissions in mines with 501+ 
employees. 

 

73

MSHA estimates that a supervisor (earning $84.70 per hour in an underground 

coal mine and $69.98 per hour in a surface coal mine) would take 15 minutes 
(0.25 hours) to write up the correction actions for submission; and a clerical employee 
(earning $26 per hour in an underground coal mine and $25.45 in a surface coal mine) 
would take 6 minutes (0.1 hours) to submit the correction actions.  In addition, MSHA 
estimates that copy and postage costs are $1.30 per submission [(2 pages x $0.15 per 
page) + $1 postage]. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to submit corrective actions in the second year that 
the final rule is effective would be approximately $16,700 for underground coal operators 
and $1,200 for surface coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,580 in mines with 1-19 employees [63 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; 

•  $13,365 in mines with 20-500 employees [533 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x 
$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; and 

•  $1,755 in mines with 501+ employees [70 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x 
$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]. 

Surface operators: 
•  $640 in mines with 1-19 employees [30 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x $69.98 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; 

•  $534 in mines with 20-500 employees [25 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$69.98 hourly wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]; and 
•  $85 in mines with 501+ employees [4 submissions x ((0.25 hrs. x $69.98 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)]. 

 

Review CPDM Plan - Proposed §§ 70.208(f)(4), 70.208(g)(4), 70.209(g)(4), 
71.207(k)(4), 71.207(n)(2), 90.209(e)(4) and 90.209(f)(4) 
Proposed §§ 70.208(f)(4) and 90.209(e)(4) would  require underground coal 

operators to review the adequacy of the approved CPDM Performance Plan and submit 
any necessary revisions to the District Manager when a valid end-of-shift equivalent 
concentration measurement meets or exceeds the applicable ECV or a weekly 
accumulated exposure exceeds the weekly permissible accumulated exposure.  Surface 
coal operators under proposed § 71.207(k)(4) would be required to review the adequacy 
of the approved CPDM Performance Plan and submit any revisions upon issuance of a 
citation for violation of the applicable standard.  In addition, for underground coal 
operators (under proposed §§ 70.208(g)(4), 70.209(g)(4), and 90.209(f)(4)) and surface 
coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(n)(2)) the CPDM plans would have to be 
reviewed when a valid end-of shift equivalent concentration measurement exceeds the 
applicable standard but is below the applicable ECV. 

As noted above, MSHA does not project any additional citations for Part 90 

miners and expects that surface operators would choose to use the gravimetric sampler.  

 

74

Therefore, no costs were estimated for reviewing the CPDM plan due to the sampling 
results of either the Part 90 miners or the DWPs exceeding the applicable standard.  

Also, as noted above, the number of samples expected to exceed the applicable 
standard would be equal to the projected number of times the ECV would be exceeded 
plus 5 percent to account for the additional times the sample would exceed the standard 
but be below the ECV.  

For underground coal operators, MSHA estimates that the number of CPDM 
plans to review would be:  66 reviews for mines with 1-19 employees (63 citations x 
1.05); 560 reviews for mines with 20-500 employees (533 citations x 1.05); and 
74 reviews for mines with 501+ employees (70 citations x 1.05).  On average, MSHA 
estimates that an underground coal supervisor would take 15 minutes (0.25 hrs.) to 
review a CPDM plan.  MSHA estimates that the cost to submit corrective actions in the 
second year that the final rule is effective would be approximately $14,800 for 
underground coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,398 in mines with 1-19 employees (66 reviews x 0.25 hrs. x $84.70 hourly 

wage rate); 

•  $11,858 in mines with 20-500 employees (560 reviews x 0.25 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate); and 

•  $1,567 in mines with 501+ employees (74 reviews x 0.25 hrs. x $84.70 hourly 

wage rate). 

 

Implement Corrective Actions - Proposed §§ 70.208(g)(2), 70.209(g)(2), 
71.207(k)(3) and 90.209(e)(2) 
Proposed §§ 70.208(g)(2) and 70.209(g)(2) would require underground coal 

operators to implement corrective actions when a valid end-of-shift equivalent 
concentration measurement exceeds the applicable standard but is below the applicable 
ECV.  Underground coal operators would be required to implement corrective actions 
under proposed § 90.209(e)(2) when a valid end-of-shift equivalent concentration 
measurement meets or exceeds the applicable ECV or a weekly accumulated exposure 
exceeds the weekly permissible accumulated exposure.  Surface coal operators under 
proposed § 71.207(k)(3) would be required to implement corrective actions when a 
citation is issued for a violation of the applicable standard. 

The types of engineering controls implemented in the second year that the final 

rule is effective are similar to those implemented in the first year and which were 
discussed above.  MSHA estimates that, on average, the cost (including labor) for 
corrective actions would be approximately $1,000 in an underground coal mine and $500 
in a surface coal mine.  Corrective actions would need to be implemented when sample 
results are above the applicable standard (whether or not they meet or exceed the ECV).  
MSHA estimates that corrective actions would be taken in underground coal mines on:  
66 occasions (63 + 3) in mines with 1-19 employees; 560 occasions (533 + 27) in mines 
with 20-500 employees; and 74 occasions (70 + 4) in mines with 501+ employees.  
MSHA estimates that corrective actions would be taken in surface coal mines on:  

 

75

32 occasions (30 + 2) in mines with 1-19 employees; 26 occasions (25 + 1) in mines with 
20-500 employees; and 5 occasions (4 + 1) in mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to implement corrective actions in the second year 

that the final rule is effective would be approximately $700,000 for underground coal 
operators and $31,500 for surface coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown 
below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $66,000 in mines with 1-19 employees (66 occasions x $1,000); 
•  $560,000 in mines with 20-500 employees (560 occasions x $1,000); and 
•  $74,000 in mines with 501+ employees (74 occasions x $1,000). 
Surface operators: 
•  $16,000 in mines with 1-19 employees (32 occasions x $500); 
•  $13,000 in mines with 20-500 employees (26 occasions x $500); and 
•  $2,500 in mines with 501+ employees (5 occasions x $500). 

 

Conducting Sampling - Proposed §§ 70.209(b)(2), 70.209(e)(3), 71.207(k)(3), and 
71.207(m) 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §70.209(e)(3)) and surface coal 
operators (under proposed § 71.207(k)(3)) would be required to take five abatement 
samples upon issuance of a citation for a violation of the applicable standard.  In addition, 
underground coal operators (under proposed §70.209(b)(2)) and surface coal operators 
(under proposed § 71.207(m)) would be required to take five samples if any sample result 
from the most recent bimonthly sampling period is above the new applicable standard. 
As noted earlier, under the proposed rule most of the underground coal operator 

sampling with a CPDM would be conducted for the designated occupation (DO); for 
purposes of this analysis MSHA assumes that any additional citations would result from 
DO sampling with the CPDM.  Since DO sampling with a CPDM under the proposed 
rule is conducted on every MMU, on every shift, there is no additional sampling for 
underground coal operators calculated here.  With respect to surface coal operators, 
MSHA estimates that five samples would be taken on:  32 occasions (30 + 2) in mines 
with 1-19 employees; 26 occasions (25 + 1) in mines with 20-500 employees; and 
5 occasions (4 + 1) in mines with 501+ employees. 

The calculation used to estimate the cost per sample (including filters) for 

sampling conducted by underground coal operators in the first year of the final rule can 
be used for surface coal operators in the second year, except that surface coal hourly 
wage rates apply.  MSHA estimates that the cost to take a sample is $75.32 ($28.66 per 
hr. x 0.8333 hrs. + $69.98 per hr. x 0.1666 hrs. + $19.89 per filter + $19.89 per control 
filter) for surface mines.  Five samples are taken each time sampling is conducted with 
the gravimetric sampler. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to conduct sampling in the second year that the 

final rule is in effect would be approximately $23,700 for surface coal operators.  Costs 
for each mine size are shown below: 

 

76

Surface operators: 
•  $12,051 in mines with 1-19 employees (32 occasions x 5 samples x $75.32 cost to 

sample); 

•  $9,792 in mines with 20-500 employees (26 occasions x 5 samples x $75.32 cost 

to sample); and 

•  $1,883 in mines with 501+ employees (5 occasions x 5 samples x $75.32 cost to 

sample). 

 

Completing Dust Data Card and Sending Sample and Card to MSHA – Proposed 
§ 71.208(c) 
Surface coal operators under proposed § 71.208(c) would be required to complete 

the dust data card and submit the card to MSHA along with the sample.  The person 
completing the dust data card is a certified dust technician with an estimated hourly wage 
of $28.66 in a surface coal mine.   On average, MSHA estimates that a certified dust 
technician would take 6 minutes (0.1 hours) to complete the dust data card, sign it and 
send it along with the sample to MSHA.  After filling out the dust data card, a certified 
person signs the card and writes the certification number on it.  On average, MSHA 
estimates that a certified person (normally the mine safety inspector or an equivalent 
person) would take 1.5 minutes (0.025 hours) to review and sign the dust data card.  A 
supervisor’s hourly wage is estimated to be $69.98 in a surface mine.  MSHA estimates 
postage costs at $1 per sample mailed. 

The number of dust data cards equates to the number of samples taken.  

Therefore, for surface coal mines, MSHA estimates that the number of dust data cards to 
complete, sign, and send would be:  160 dust cards (32 occasions x 5 samples) in mines 
with 1-19 employees; 130 dust cards (26 occasions x 5 samples) in mines with 20-500 
employees; and 25 dust cards (5 occasions x 5 samples) in mines with 501+ employees. 
MSHA estimates that the cost to complete, sign, and send dust data cards, along 

with samples, to MSHA in the second year that the final rule is in effect would be 
approximately $1,800 for surface coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown 
below: 

Surface operators: 
•  $898 in mines with 1-19 employees [160 dust cards x ((0.1 hrs. x $28.66 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.025 hrs. x $69.98 hourly wage rate) + $1)]; 

•  $730 in mines with 20-500 employees [130 dust cards x ((0.1 hrs. x $28.66 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.025 hrs. x $69.98 hourly wage rate) + $1)]; and 

•  $140 in mines with 501+ employees [25 dust cards x ((0.1 hrs. x $28.66 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.025 hrs. x $69.98 hourly wage rate) + $1)]. 

 

Posting Sample Results – Proposed § 71.209(b) 
Surface coal operators under proposed § 71.209(b) would be required to post 

sample results.  On average, MSHA estimates that a clerical employee earning $25.45 per 
hour would take 0.1 hours (6 minutes) to copy and post the sample results.  Photocopying 

 

77

costs are estimated to be $0.15 per page.  The number of postings equals the number of 
times operators are required to sample due to exposures above the applicable standard.  In 
surface coal mines, MSHA estimates that the number of postings would be:  32 postings 
(30 + 2) in mines with 1-19 employees; 26 postings (25 + 1) in mines with 20-500 
employees; and 5 postings (4 + 1) in mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates that 
the cost to post sample results in the second year that the rule is in effect would be 
approximately $200 for surface coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown 
below: 

Surface operators: 
•  $86 in mines with 1-19 employees [32 postings x ((0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage 

rate) + (1 pg. x $0.15))]; 

•  $70 in mines with 20-500 employees [26 postings x ((0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate) + (1 pg. x $0.15))]; and 

•  $13 in mines with 501+ employees [5 postings x ((0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage 

rate) + (1 pg. x $0.15))]. 

 

Make Existing § 75.363 Record -  Proposed §§ 70.208(f)(5), 70.208(g)(3), 
70.209(g)(3), 90.209(e)(5), and 90.209(f)(3) 
For underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.208(g)(3), 70.209(g)(3), 

and 90.209(f)(3)) when a valid end-of-shift equivalent concentration measurement 
exceeds the applicable standard but is below the applicable ECV, the operator would be 
required to record the corrective actions taken in the same manner as the record required 
by existing § 75.363.  In addition, for underground coal operators under proposed 
§§ 70.208(f)(5) and 90.209(e)(5) the same type of record would be required to be made 
when a valid end-of-shift equivalent concentration measurement meets or exceeds the 
applicable ECV, or a weekly accumulated exposure exceeds the weekly permissible 
accumulated exposure. 

For underground coal mines, MSHA estimates the number of records would be:  
66 records in mines with 1-19 employees; 560 records in mines with 20-500 employees; 
and 74 records in mines with 501+ employees.  Under existing § 75.363 a certified 
person would make the record and the record must be countersigned by a mine foreman 
or equivalent mine official.  MSHA estimates that a certified person (earning a 
supervisor’s wage rate) would take 6 minutes (0.1 hrs.) to make the record and a mine 
official (also earning a supervisor’s wage rate) would take 3 minutes (0.05 hrs.) to 
countersign the record.  MSHA estimates that the cost to make a record as required by 
existing § 75.363 in the second year that the rule is in effect would be approximately 
$5,200 for underground coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $489 in mines with 1-19 employees [66 records x ((0.1 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.05 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate))]; 

•  $4,151 in mines with 20-500 employees [560 records x ((0.1 hrs. x $84.70 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.05 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate))]; and 

 

78

•  $548 in mines with 501+ employees [74 records x ((0.1 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.05 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate))]. 

 

Notify Representative of the Miners – Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(i), 75.370(f)(1) 
and 90.301(d) and Proposed §§ 71.300(a)(1) and 71.300(d)(1) 
Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(i) and 75.370(f)(1) for underground coal operators 

requires and proposed §§ 71.300(a)(1) and 71.300(d)(1) for surface coal operators would 
require notification to the representative of miners of a plan revision.  Existing 
§ 90.301(d) requires a copy of the dust control plan be provided to the Part 90 miner.  
MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to notify 
and provide a copy of the plan to the representative of the miners or Part 90 miner.  
MSHA assumes that all miners’ representatives would request a copy of the plan.  MSHA 
estimates that copy costs are $0.30 (2 pgs. x $0.15).  There are no postage costs because 
MSHA assumes that a copy of the plan would be given to the representative of the miners 
at the mine site. 

MSHA estimates that the number of notifications would be equal to the number of 

occasions corrective actions were submitted, which was determined above.  For 
underground coal operators, the notifications would be:  63 notifications in mines with 
1-19 employees; 533 notifications in mines with 20-500 employees; and 70 notifications 
in mines with 501+ employees.  For surface coal mines, MSHA estimates that the 
number of notifications would be:  30 notifications in mines with 1-19 employees; 
25 notifications in mines with 20-500 employees; and 4 notifications in mines with 501+ 
employees. 

MSHA estimates that the cost to notify the miner representative and provide a 
copy if requested in the second year that the rule is in effect would be approximately 
$4,500 for underground coal operators and $400 for surface coal operators.  Costs for 
each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $428 in mines with 1-19 employees [63 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $3,624 in mines with 20-500 employees [533 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x 

$26 hourly wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $476 in mines with 501+ employees [70 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]. 

Surface operators: 
•  $200 in mines with 1-19 employees [30 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $167 in mines with 20-500 employees  [25 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x 

$25.45 hourly wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $27 in mines with 501+ employees [4 notifications x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)].

Post Copy of Plan Revision – Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(iii), and 75.370(f)(3) and 
Proposed §§ 71.300(a)(3), and 71.301(d)(3) 
Underground coal operators under existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(iii) and 75.370(f)(3) 

are required and surface coal operators under proposed §§ 71.300(a)(3), and 71.301(d)(3) 
would be required to post a copy of the proposed or revised plan on the mine bulletin 
board.  MSHA estimates that the number of postings for underground mines would be: 
63 posting in mines with 1-19 employees; 533 postings in mines with 20-500 employees; 
and 70 postings in mines with 501+ employees.  For surface coal mines, MSHA 
estimates that the number of proposed or revised plans to post would be:  30 postings in 
mines with 1-19 employees; 25 postings in mines with 20-500 employees; and 4 postings 
in mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to 

copy and post.  Copy costs are $0.30 (2 pgs. x $0.15).  There are no postage costs.  
MSHA estimates that the costs to copy and post in the second year the final rule is in 
effect would be approximately $4,500 for underground coal operators and $400 for 
surface coal operators.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $428 in mines with 1-19 employees [63 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage 

rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $3,624 in mines with 20-500 employees [533 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $476 in mines with 501+ employees [70 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage 

rate + $0.30)]. 
Surface operators: 
•  $200 in mines with 1-19 employees [30 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; 

•  $167 in mines with 20-500 employees  [25 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly 

wage rate + $0.30)]; and 

•  $27 in mines with 501+ employees [4 postings x (0.25 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage 

rate + $0.30)]. 

 

Costs in Third Year and Every Year Thereafter- Resulting from Citations 
Received in the Third Year and Every Year Thereafter 
With respect to underground coal operators, MSHA estimated that the number of 
additional citations would increase in years one and two and then decrease beginning in 
the third year that the final rule is effective.  Beginning in the fourth year, the number of 
citations would remain at a constant level each year.  With respect to surface coal 
operators, MSHA estimated that the number of additional citations would increase in year 
one, decrease in the second and third year, and then remain at a constant level beginning 
in the fourth year and every year thereafter that the final rule is in effect.  The Agency 
took into account each year’s delay before costs would be incurred by multiplying each 
year’s cost (except for the costs incurred in the first year) during a 10 year period by the 
appropriate discount factor.  The discount factor is derived by using the formula 

 

80

1/(1+0.07)n, where n equals the number of years.  The discounted amounts were summed 
and amortized over a 10 year period by multiplying by an annualization factor of 0.142 
based on a 7 percent discount rate in order to arrive at a annualized cost. 
 
receiving additional citations would be approximately $2.1 million for underground coal 
operators and $208,000 for surface coal operators.

Costs to Certify Persons to Sample and Maintain Certification 
Proposed § 70.202, 71.202, and 90.202 
Sampling by Certified Person 
 
Proposed §§ 70.202(a), 71.202(a), and 90.202(a) are the same as the existing 
standards and would require that respirable dust sampling be performed by a certified 

 

81

Proposed §§ 70.202(b), 71.202(b), and 90.202(b) would retain the existing 

person.  Since this is an existing requirement, there are no new costs associated with this 
provision.  Costs for the additional persons that would be needed and the additional 
sampling that would be required under the proposed requirements are presented below. 
 
Cost to Certify Persons to Perform Sampling 
 
requirement that candidates for certification pass an MSHA examination to demonstrate 
competency in respirable dust sampling procedures.  To ensure consistent administration 
of the certification process, however, the proposal would add a new requirement that 
candidates complete an MSHA course of instruction prior to certification.  MSHA would 
provide the course of instruction at no charge.  However, MSHA assumes that persons 
becoming certified to sample would travel to either an MSHA district or field office to 
take the course. 

The proposed rule would not require persons currently certified to perform 

sampling to take the course of instruction unless they failed the exam.  Currently, there 
are a sufficient number of persons certified to perform the required sampling using the 
gravimetric sampler at all underground coal mines and approximately 20 percent of 
surface coal mines.  Since MSHA’s existing standards do not permit the use of the 
CPDM to sample for compliance purposes, there are no persons certified to sample using 
the CPDM at either underground or surface coal mines. 

The number of persons that would be needed to meet the proposed requirements 
is determined below, first for underground coal mines and then for surface coal mines. 
 

Estimated Number of Certified Persons at Underground Mines: 

Since there are a sufficient number of persons currently certified to sample with a 

gravimetric sampler at underground coal mines, only the costs related to certifying 
persons to conduct CPDM sampling are new.  MSHA estimates that one person per 
MMU per shift would need to be certified to sample with the CPDM.  Since many 
certified persons (e.g., the section boss) would likely have to remain at the MMU during 
sampling, MSHA assumes an additional person per underground coal mine would also 
have to be certified to handle other designated occupation (ODO) sampling in outby 
areas.  Finally, MSHA assumes that another person would have to be certified to sample 
in underground coal mines that have facilities on the surface (such as a preparation plant, 
a mill, shop or yard).  MSHA estimates that the number of underground coal mines with 
surface facilities that would need a person certified would be:  3 mines with 1-19 
employees; 21 mines with 20-500 employees; and 8 mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA 
estimates that the number of persons that underground coal operators would need to have 
certified would be: 

•  96 persons in mines with 1-19 employees [(69 MMUs x 1 shift x 1 person per 

shift) + (12 MMUs x 2 shifts x 1 person per shift) + (3 mines with surface 
facilities x 1 person per mine)]; 

•  1,797 persons in mines with 20-500 employees [(45 MMUs x 1 shift x 1 person 
per shift) + (589 MMUs x 2 shifts x 1 person per shift) + (74 MMUs x 3 shifts x 

 

82

1 person per shift) + (331 mines x 1 person for sampling outby areas) + (21 mines 
with surface facilities x 1 person per mine)]; and 

•  293 persons in mines with 501+ employees [(3 MMUs x 2 shifts x 1 person per 

shift) + (89 MMUs x 3 shifts x 1 person per shift) + (12 mines x 1 person for 
sampling outby areas) + (8 mines with surface facilities x 1 person per mine)]. 

 

Estimated Number of Certified Persons at Surface Mines: 

Surface coal mines currently sample about 320 designated work positions (DWPs) 
at approximately 225 mines.  This represents about 20 percent of all surface coal mines.  
Under the proposed rule, surface coal mine operators would have the option to use either 
a gravimetric sampler or a CPDM to conduct sampling.  When the rule becomes 
effective, MSHA assumes that surface coal mine operators would choose to conduct 
sampling using the less expensive gravimetric sampler unless they have Part 90 miners 
who must use the CPDM.5  Therefore, the 80 percent of surface coal mines (898 mines) 
that currently do not sample would need to have persons take the applicable course and 
examination that would be required by proposed § 71.202(b) to become certified.  In 
addition, MSHA expects that the 20 percent of surface coal mines that currently are 
sampling would each need additional persons to be certified to perform sampling because 
of the increased sampling that would be required under the proposed requirements (e.g., 
proposed § 71.207(b) establishes more DWPs than currently exist). 

MSHA estimates that the 898 surface coal mines that currently do not conduct 

sampling would need to obtain certification for:  2 persons at each mine with 1-19 
employees; 3 persons at each mine with 20-500 employees; and 6 persons at each mine 
with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates that the 225 surface coal mines that currently 
conduct sampling have an average of 2 persons per mine that are currently certified to 
sample.  Surface coal mine operators already performing sampling would need 
certifications to sample for 1 additional person in mines with 20-500 employees and 
4 additional persons in mines with 501+ employees.  No additional persons would need 
to be certified to sample for surface coal mine operators with 1-19 employees.  MSHA 
estimates that the number of persons that surface coal mine operators would need to have 
certified to sample would be: 

•  992 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (620 surface mines x 2 persons x 

80 percent); 

•  1,276 persons in mines with 20-500  employees [(491 surface mines x 3 persons x 

80 percent) + (491 surface mines x 1 person x 20 percent)]; and 

•  68 persons in mines with 501+ employees [(12 surface mines x 6 persons x 

80 percent) + (12 surface mines x 4 persons x 20 percent)]. 

 

Estimated Costs 

                                                           

5 Since surface miners are not currently eligible to become Part 90 miners, MSHA placed all of the 

costs related to the use of the CPDM at surface mines, including those related to certified persons, under 
proposed § 90.1, which would to expand the scope of the Part 90 option to surface mines.  

 

83

MSHA estimates that it would take a person 9 hours to complete the CPDM 

course and examination on sampling (7 hours for the course, 1 hour for the examination 
and 1 hour to travel to and from the course site); and 3.5 hours for the course and 
examination on sampling with the gravimetric sampler (2 hours for the course, 0.5 hours 
for the exam, 1 hour to travel to and from the course site).  MSHA estimates that a person 
certified for sampling earns $31.77 per hour in an underground coal mine and $28.66 per 
hour in a surface coal mine.  MSHA estimated that the travel expenses would average 
$50 per round trip.  MSHA estimates that first year costs to certify persons to sample 
would be approximately: $734,300 for underground coal mine operators and $351,100 
for surface coal mine operators.  Costs for underground and surface operators for each 
mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 

•  $32,249 in mines with 1-19 employees [96 persons x (9 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $603,666 in mines with 20-500 employees [1,797 persons x (9 hrs. for course, 
examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; and 

•  $98,427 in mines with 501+ employees [293 persons x (9 hrs. for course, 
examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 
Surface operators: 

•  $149,108 in mines with 1-19 employees [992 persons x (3.5 hrs. for course, 
examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $191,796 in mines with 20-500 employees [1,276 persons x (3.5 hrs. for course, 
examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; and 

•  $10,221 in mines with 501+ employees [68 persons x (3.5 hrs. for course, 
examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying them by an 

annualization factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized 
cost of approximately $104,300 for underground coal mine operators and $50,000 for 
surface coal mine operators. 
 
Turnover Costs Related to Certifying Persons to Perform Sampling 
 
have to be replaced or a new mine starting up would need certified persons.  In some 
instances, these persons will already have certification to perform the required sampling.  
However, in other instances these persons would need to become certified to perform 
sampling. 

There would be occasions when persons certified to sample will leave the job and 

MSHA estimates that the annual need for replacement certified persons would be 
6 percent of the persons certified in underground coal mines and 3 percent of the persons 
certified in surface coal mines.  MSHA assumes that persons employed at underground 
coal mines would have to become certified to sample with both the gravimetric sampler 
and CPDM, while persons employed at surface coal mines would only have to become 
certified to sample with the gravimetric sampler. 

 

84

MSHA estimates that annual cost to certify replacement persons to sample would 
be approximately $54,800 for underground coal mine operators and $10,500 for surface 
coal mine operators.  Costs for underground and surface operators for each mine size are 
shown below: 

Underground operators: 

The time to certify persons in underground coal mines would be 11.5 hours 

(8 hours for the CPDM course and exam, 2.5 hours for the gravimetric course and exam, 
and 1 hour for travel to and from the course site). 

•  $2,492 in mines with 1-19 employees [(96 persons x 6 percent) x ((11.5 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate) + $50 travel 
expenses)]; 

•  $44,858 in mines with 20-500 employees [(1,797 persons x 6 percent) x 

((11.5 hrs. for course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate) + $50 
travel expenses)]; and 

•  $7,476 in mines with 501+ employees [(293 persons x 6 percent) x ((11.5 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate) + $50 travel 
expenses)]. 

Surface operators: 
  At surface coal mines, the time to certify persons in surface coal mines would be 
3.5 hours (2.5 hours for the course and exam, and 1 hour for travel to and from the course 
site). 

•  $4,509 in mines with 1-19 employees [(992 persons x 3 percent) x ((3.5 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate) + $50 travel 
expenses)]; 

•  $5,712 in mines with 20-500 employees [(1,276 persons x 3 percent) x ((3.5 hrs. 

for course, examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate) + $50 travel 
expenses)]; and 

•  $301 in mines with 501+ employees [(68 persons x 3 percent) x ((3.5 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate) + $50 travel 
expenses)]. 

 
Costs for Persons to Take Examination to Maintain their Certification to Perform 
Sampling 

Proposed §§ 70.202(c), 71.202(c) and 90.202(c) are new and would require 

persons certified in dust sampling procedures to pass the MSHA examination every three 
years to demonstrate competency in sampling procedures. Persons that pass the 
examination maintain their certification.  Persons that fail the examination must take the 
course and pass the examination to become recertified. 
 

Estimated Number of Persons Taking the Examination 
The number of persons in underground coal mines that would be required to take 
the MSHA examination to maintain certification to sample is the same as those estimated 
earlier to become certified to sample with the CPDM under proposed § 70.202(b): 

 

85

96 persons in mines with 1-19 employees; 1,797 persons in mines with 20-500 
employees; and 293 persons in mines with 501+ employees.  However, with respect to 
surface coal mines, persons that were certified to sample with the gravimetric sampler 
due to proposed § 71.202(b), as well as persons already holding certifications to sample 
with the gravimetric sampler when the rule would take effect, would need to take the 
re-certification examination.  The number of persons in surface coal mines that would 
need to take a MSHA examination to maintain their certification to sample would be:  
1,240 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (620 mines x 2 persons); 1,473 persons in 
mines with 20-500 employees (491 mines x 3 persons); and 72 persons in mines with 
501+ employees (12 mines x 6 persons). 

It was not possible for MSHA to estimate with any degree of precision when 
persons would have to be re-certified.  For example, for underground mines, MSHA 
assumed that all of the new certifications resulting from the proposal would occur in the 
first year following the effective date of the rule.  This is a simplification.  Some may 
become certified before the rule would take effect.  Others may wait until the second year 
when the requirement for additional monitoring with the CPDM would take effect. 

Due to the difficulty of determining exactly when persons would take the 

examination to re-certify, and that some persons may recertify earlier than required, 
MSHA made the simplifying assumption for costing purposes that one third of the 
persons that are certified to perform sampling would take the re-certification examination 
each year.  Thus, MSHA estimates that the number of persons taking the examination ach 
year to maintain their certifications would be approximately: 

Underground Operators: 
•  32 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (96 persons / 3); 
•  599 persons in mines with 20-500 employees (1,797 persons / 3); and 
•  98 persons in mines with 501+ employees (293 persons / 3). 
Surface Operators: 
•  413 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (1,240 persons / 3); 
•  491 persons in mines with 20-500 employees (1,473 persons / 3); and 
•  24 persons in mines with 501+ employees (72 persons / 3). 

Costs for the Examinations 
As noted above, with respect to certification for sampling, MSHA estimates that it 
would take 1 hour for the CPDM examination, 0.5 hours for the gravimetric examination, 
and 1 hour to travel to and from the site where the examination is given.  MSHA assumes 
that all persons from underground coal mines would take both examinations and all 
persons from surface coal mines would take just the gravimetric exam.  For underground 
coal mines, this assumption is likely to result in a slight overestimate of the examination 
costs for re-certification because a small number of persons may be certified on only one 
device and take only one exam.  For example, after the requirement to sample the 
designated occupations (DOs) and ODOs with the CPDM becomes effective, 
underground coal mines would need fewer persons certified in the gravimetric sampler.  
As a result, not every certified person working underground would need to pass the 
examination for the gravimetric sampler.  However, this slight overestimation with regard 

 

86

to underground coal mines would be offset by the additional hours needed for travel if 
different persons have to take each exam.  All persons from surface coal mines would 
take the gravimetric exam.  MSHA estimates that annual cost for certified persons to take 
the examination to maintain their certification to sample would be approximately $92,800 
for underground coal mine operators and $94,350 for surface coal mine operators.  Costs 
for underground and surface operators for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $4,142 in mines with 1-19 employees [32 persons x (2.5 hrs. for gravimetric and 

CPDM examinations and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel 
expenses)]; 

•  $77,526 in mines with 20-500 employees [599 persons x (2.5 hrs. for gravimetric 

and CPDM examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel 
expenses)]; and 

•  $12,684 in mines with 501+ employees [98 persons x (2.5 hrs. for gravimetric and 

CPDM examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate) + $50 travel 
expenses)]. 

Surface Operators: 
•  $38,405 in mines with 1-19 employees [413 persons x (1.5 hrs. for examination 

and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $45,658 in mines with 20-500 employees [491 persons x (1.5 hrs. for examination 

and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; and 

•  $2,232 in mines with 501+ employees [24 persons x (1.5 hrs. for examination and 

travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 

 
Costs for Persons who Fail Examinations to Re-Certify to Perform Sampling 

Some of the persons taking the examination to maintain their certification to 

sample would fail the examination and need to take the course and examination again.  In 
addition, proposed §§ 70.202(d), 71.202(d), and 90.202(d) would provide that MSHA 
may revoke a person's certification for failing to properly carry out required sampling 
procedures, as appropriate.  MSHA assumes that 10 percent of the certified persons who 
work at underground coal mines and 5 percent who work at surface coal mines would 
have to take the course and examination to become recertified. 

Course and examination times are the same as determined above.  MSHA 

estimates that the annual cost for persons who failed the examination and need to retake 
the course and examination would be approximately $24,500 for underground coal mine 
operators and $7,100 for surface coal mine operators.  Costs for underground and surface 
operators for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
For underground coal mines, MSHA based the estimated times and costs on the 

CPDM examination, which would be harder to pass than the examination for the 
gravimetric sampler.   

 

87

•  $1,008 in mines with 1-19 employees [32 persons x 10 percent x (9 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $20,156 in mines with 20-500 employees [599 persons x 10 percent (9 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 
and 

•  $3,359 in mines with 501+ employees [99 persons x 10 percent x (9 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 

Surface operators: 
For surface coal mines, MSHA based the estimated times and costs on the 

examination for the gravimetric sampler. 

•  $3,157 in mines with 1-19 employees [413 persons x 5 percent x(3.5 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expense)]; 
•  $3,758 in mines with 20-500 employees [491 persons x 5 percent x((3.5 hrs. for 
course, examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expense)]; 
and 

•  $150 in mines with 501+ employees [24 persons x 5 percent x (3.5 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expense)]. 

 

Certified Person; Maintenance and Calibration 
Proposed § 70.203, 71.203, and 90.203 
Maintenance and Calibration Performed by a Certified Person 
 
Proposed §§ 70.203(a), 71.203(a), and 90.203(a) would require that persons who 
maintain and calibrate respirable dust sampling equipment be certified.  Since this is an 
existing requirement, there are no new costs associated with this provision.  Costs for 
additional persons to become certified and costs for the additional maintenance that 
would be needed under the proposed requirements are presented below. 
 
Cost to Certify Persons to Maintain and Calibrate (M&C) Sampling Devices 
For underground coal mine operators, proposed § 70.203(b) would require a person to 
complete an MSHA course of instruction and pass an MSHA examination in order to 
become certified to maintain and calibrate approved sampling devices.  Like the 
certification to perform sampling, MSHA would provide this course at no charge; 
however, persons becoming certified would have to travel to either an MSHA district or 
field office to take the course.  Estimates of the number of persons that operators would 
need to become certified to perform M&C are determined as follows. 
 
Estimated Number of Certified Persons at Underground Mines 
 
maintaining and calibrating those devices, no additional persons would be needed at 
underground mines to maintain and calibrate the gravimetric sampler.   However, all 
underground coal mines are assumed to need at least one person certified in the 

Since all underground coal mines currently use the gravimetric sampler and are 

 

88

maintenance and calibration of the CPDM.   Underground mines with 501+ employees 
are assumed to need 2 persons. 

•  81 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (81 mines x 1 person per mine); 
•  331 persons in mines with 20-500 employees (331 mines x 1 person per mine); 

and 

•  24 persons in mines with 501+ employees (12 mines x 2 persons per mine). 

As was noted above, surface coal mines are not expected to use the CPDM unless 

 
Estimated Number of Certified Persons at Surface Mines 
 
they have Part 90 miners.  The 225 surface coal mines that currently sample with the 
gravimetric sampler are not expected to need additional persons to be certified to 
maintain and calibrate that device.  However, MSHA assumes that each of the 898 
surface coal mines (80 percent of surface mines) that currently do not sample would need 
1 person to be certified to maintain and calibrate the gravimetric sampler. 

•  496 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (620 mines x 80 percent x 1 person per 

mine); 

•  393 persons in mines with 20-500 employees (491 mines x 80 percent x 1 person 

per mine); and 

•  10 persons in mines with 501+ employees (12 mines x 80 percent x 1 person per 

mine). 

 

Estimated Costs 

MSHA estimates that it would take a person 9 hours for the CPDM course and 

 
examination on maintenance and calibration (7 hours for the course, 1 hour for the 
examination and 1 hour to travel to and from the course site).  Also, MSHA estimates that 
it would take a person 6 hours for the course and examination on maintenance and 
calibration for the gravimetric sampler (4 hours for the course, 1 hour for the exam, 
1 hour to travel to and from the course site).  MSHA estimates that a certified person 
earns $31.77 per hour in an underground coal mine and $28.66 in a surface coal mine.  
MSHA estimates that first year costs to certify persons to maintain and calibrate sampling 
device would be approximately $146,500 for underground coal mine operators and 
$199,400 for surface coal mine operators.  Costs for underground and surface operators 
for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 

•  $27,210 in mines with 1-19 employees [81 persons x (9 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $111,193 in mines with 20-500 employees [331 persons x (9 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; and 

•  $8,062 in mines with 501+ employees [24 persons x (9 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 
Surface Operators: 

 

89

•  $110,092 in mines with 1-19 employees [496 persons x (6 hrs. for course, 
examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 
•  $87,186 in mines with 20-500 employees [393 persons x (6 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; and 

•  $2,131 in mines with 501+ employees [10 persons x (6 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying by an annualization 

There would be occasions when persons certified to sample will leave the job and 

factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized cost of 
approximately $20,800 for underground coal mine operators and $28,300 for surface coal 
mine operators. 
 
Turnover Costs Related to Certifying Persons to Maintain and Calibrate the Sampling 
Devices 
 
have to be replaced or a new mine starting up would need certified persons.  MSHA 
assumes the same replacement rates for persons certified to maintain and calibrate the 
sampling devices as those for certifying persons to perform sampling noted above, 
6 percent at underground coal mines and 3 percent at surface coal mines.  MSHA 
estimates that annual costs to certify replacement persons to M&C sampling devices are 
approximately $15,000 for underground coal mine operators and $6,200 for surface coal 
mine operators.  Costs for underground and surface operators for each mine size are 
shown below: 

Underground operators: 
MSHA assumed that the certified persons at underground mines would have to be 

certified on the maintenance and calibration of both the gravimetric and CPDM sampling 
devices.  The time to certify replacement persons in underground coal mines would be 
15 hours which consist of:  9 hours for the first day (8 hours for the CPDM course and 
exam + 1 hour of travel time to and from the course site); and 6 hours for the second day 
(5 hours for the gravimetric course and exam + 1 hour for travel to and from the course 
site).  Travel costs are estimated to be $100 ($50 per day).  MSHA estimates that the 
number of persons to train are:  5 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (81 persons x 
6 percent; 20 persons in mines with 20-500 employees (331 persons x 6 percent); and 
1 person in mines with 501+ employees (24 persons x 6 percent). 

•  $2,883 in mines with 1-19 employees [5 persons x (15 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $100 travel expenses)]; 
•  $11,531 in mines with 20-500 employees [20 persons x (15 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $100 travel expenses)]; and 
•  $577 in mines with 501+ employees [1 person x (15 hrs. for course, examination 

and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $100 travel expenses)]. 

Surface operators: 
MSHA assumed that the certified persons at surface mines would have to be certified 

only on the maintenance and calibration of the gravimetric sampling device unless the 

 

90

mine had Part 90 miners.  The time to certify replacement persons in surface coal mines 
would be 6 hours (5 hours for the course and exam, and 1 hour for travel to and from the 
course site).  MSHA estimates that the number of persons to train are:  15 persons in 
mines with 1-19 employees (496 persons x 3 percent); 12 persons in mines with 20-500 
employees (393 persons x 3 percent); and 1 person in mines with 501+ employees 
(10 persons x 3 percent).   

•  $3,329 in mines with 1-19 employees [15 persons x (6 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $2,664 in mines with 20-500 employees [12 persons x (6 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; and 
•  $222 in mines with 501+ employees [1 person x (6 hrs. for course, examination 

and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 

Proposed §§ 70.203(c), 71.203(c) and 90.203(c) are new and would require 

 
Costs for Persons to Take the Examination to Maintain the Certification to Maintain and 
Calibrate Sampling Devices 
 
persons certified in dust sampling procedures to pass the MSHA examination 
demonstrating competency in sampling procedures or maintenance and calibration 
procedures every three years. Persons who pass the examination maintain their 
certification.  Persons who fail the examination must take the course and pass the 
examination to become re-certified. 
 

Estimated Number of Certified Persons Taking the Examination 

The number of certified persons in underground coal mines who would need to 

take the MSHA examination to maintain their certification to maintain and calibrate 
sampling devices is the same as that estimated above to become certified under proposed 
§ 70.203(b):  81 persons in mines with 1-19 employees; 331 persons in mines with 
20-500 employees; and 24 persons in mines with 501+ employees.  For surface coal 
mines, MSHA assumed that all mines would need to have one person certified to 
maintain and calibrate sampling devices.  The number of persons taking the examination 
is equal to the number of surface coal mines:  620 persons in mines with 1-19 employees; 
491 persons in mines with 20-500 employees; and 12 persons in mines with 501+ 
employees. 

As explained above in the discussion of re-certification of persons for sampling, 
due to the difficulty of determining exactly when persons would take the examination to 
re-certify, and the fact that some persons may recertify earlier than required, MSHA 
assumes that one-third of the persons who are certified to perform sampling would take 
the re-certification examination each year.  MSHA estimates that the number of persons 
taking the examination each year to maintain their certification is approximately: 

Underground operators: 
•  27 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (81 persons / 3); 
•  110 persons in mines with 20-500 employees (331 persons / 3); and 
•  8 persons in mines with 501+ employees (24 persons / 3). 

 

91

Surface operators: 
•  207 persons in mines with 1-19 employees (620 persons / 3); 
•  164 persons in mines with 20-500 employees (491 persons / 3); and, 
•  4 persons in mines with 501+ employees (12 persons / 3). 

 

Estimated Costs of the Examinations 

As noted above, with respect to certification to perform maintenance and 

calibration on sampling devices, MSHA estimates that it would take 1 hour for the 
CPDM examination, 1 hour for the gravimetric examination, and 1 hour to travel to and 
from the site where the examination is given.  MSHA assumes that all certified persons 
from underground coal mines would take both examinations and all persons from surface 
coal mines would only take the gravimetric examination.  For underground coal mines, 
this assumption is likely to result in a slight overestimate of the examination costs for 
re-certification because a small number of persons may be certified on only one device 
and take only one examination.  For example, after the proposed requirements to sample 
the DOs and ODOs with the CPDM go into effect, underground coal mines would need 
fewer persons certified in the gravimetric sampler. 

As a result, not every certified person working underground would need to pass 
the examination for the gravimetric sampler.  This slight overestimation with regard to 
underground coal mines would be offset by the additional hours needed for travel if 
different persons have to take each exam.  All certified persons from surface coal mines 
would take the gravimetric exam.  MSHA estimates that annual costs for certified persons 
to take the examination to keep their certification to maintain and calibrate sampling 
devices would be approximately $21,100 for underground coal mine operators and 
$40,200 for surface coal mine operators.  Costs for underground and surface operators for 
each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $3,923 in mines with 1-19 employees [27 persons x (3 hrs. for gravimetric and 

CPDM examinations and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel 
expenses)]; 

•  $15,984 in mines with 20-500 employees [110 persons x (3 hrs. for gravimetric 

and CPDM examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel 
expenses)]; and 

•  $1,162 in mines with 501+ employees [8 persons x (3 hrs. for gravimetric and 

CPDM examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 

Surface operators: 
•  $22,215 in mines with 1-19 employees [207 persons x (2 hrs. for examination and 

travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $17,600 in mines with 20-500 employees [164 persons x (2 hrs. for examination 

and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; and 

•  $429 in mines with 501+ employees [4 persons x (2 hrs. for examination and 

travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 

 

92

 
Cost for Persons who Fail the Examinations 
 
Some persons taking the examination to keep their certification to maintain and 
calibrate sampling devices would fail the examination and need to take the course and 
examination again.  In addition, proposed §§ 70.203(d), 70.203(d) and 90.203(d) would 
provide that MSHA may revoke a person's certification for failing to properly carry out 
required maintenance and calibration procedures, as appropriate.  MSHA assumes that 
10 percent of the certified persons who work at underground coal mines and 5 percent 
who work at surface coal mines would have to become re-certified by taking the course 
and the examination.  The course and examination times are the same as determined 
above. 

MSHA estimates that the annual cost for persons who failed the examination and 

need to re-take the course and examination would be approximately $5,000 for 
underground coal mine operators and $4,200 for surface coal mine operators.  Costs for 
underground and surface operators for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,008 in mines with 1-19 employees [27 persons x 10 percent x (9 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 

•  $3,695 in mines with 20-500 employees [110 persons x 10 percent (9 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]; 
and 

•  $336 in mines with 501+ employees [8 persons x 10 percent x (9 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $31.77 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expenses)]. 

Surface operators: 
•  $2,220 in mines with 1-19 employees [207 persons x 5 percent x(6 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expense)]; 

•  $1,776 in mines with 20-500 employees [164 persons x 5 percent x (6 hrs. for 

course, examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expense)]; 
and 

•  $222 in mines with 501+ employees [4 persons x 5 percent x (6 hrs. for course, 

examination and travel x $28.66 hourly wage rate + $50 travel expense)]. 

 

Table V-17 shows, by mine size, a summary of the first year costs to certify 

persons to perform sampling and to maintain and calibrate (M&C) sampling equipment 
for underground and surface coal mine operators.  The dollar amounts in Table IV-17 
were derived by summing the first year cost estimates (first year costs plus annual costs) 
for proposed § 70.202 and proposed § 70.203.  MSHA estimates that the first year costs 
to certify persons to sample and to maintain and calibrate equipment would be 
approximately $1.1 million for underground coal operators and $705,100 for surface coal 
operators.

Proposed § 70.201(i) would require the operator to record the amount of 

Record of Production 
 
run-of-mine material produced by each MMU during each shift.  Production data are used 
to determine the average production for the most recent 30 production shifts or for the 
most recent production shifts if fewer than 30 shifts of production data are available.  The 
operator would also be required to retain production records for at least six months and 
make the records available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary 
and the miners’ representative. 

 

95

Some mines already record the material produced per shift; however, most do not.  

Underground coal mines with 1-19 employees operate 93 shifts per day (69 MMUs 
operating 1 shift per day + 12 MMUs operating 2 shifts per day).  MSHA estimates that 
material produced is not recorded for 90 percent of these shifts, or 84 shifts per day 
(93 shifts x 90 percent).  Underground coal mines with 20-500 employees operate 
1,445 shifts per day (45 MMUs operating 1 shift per day + 589 MMUs operating 2 shifts 
per day + 74 MMUs per day operating 3 shifts per day).  MSHA estimates that material 
produced is not recorded for 75 percent of these shifts operating each day or 1,084 shifts 
(1,445 shifts x 75 percent).    All mines with 501+ employees are assumed to already 
record the amount of material produced.  MSHA estimates that the annual number of 
workdays is:  200 days in mines with 1-19 employees; and 300 days in mines with 
20-500 employees.  MSHA assumes that a supervisor, earning $84.70 an hour, would 
take 5 minutes (0.0833 hours) to record the material produced on each shift.  MSHA 
estimates that underground coal mine operators’ annual cost to record the material 
produced on each shift would be approximately $2.4 million.  Costs for each mine size 
are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $118,533 in mines with 1-19 employees (84 shift per day x 200 days x 0.0833 hrs. 

x $84.70 hourly wage rate); and, 

•  $2,294,452 in mines with 20-500 employees (1,084 shifts per day x 300 days x 

0.0833 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate). 

 

Table V-19 provides cost data for each mine size and shows that the annualized 

cost for underground coal mine operators to record the material produced would be 
approximately $2.4 million.  The annualized costs for underground coal mine operators 
would also occur in the first year.

Record of Shift Length 
Proposed §§ 70.201, 71.201, and 90.201 Sampling; General and Technical 
Requirements 
 
Record of the Shift Length 

Proposed §§ 70.201(g), 71.201(d) and 90.201(f) are new and would require the 
operator to make a record showing the length of each production shift for each MMU,  

 

96

DWP and Part 90 miner, to retain the records for at least six months, and to make the 
records available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the 
miners’ representative. 

For underground coal mine operators, proposed §§ 70.211(c) and 90.211(c) would 
require that operators validate, certify and post for each MMU or provide to each Part 90 
miner the shift length and other information regarding CPDM sampling results.  MSHA 
assumes that records of the shift length required by proposed §§ 70.201(g) and 90.201(f) 
would be made at the same time as the recording of the shift length and other information 
for CPDM sampling results required by proposed §§ 70.211(c) and 90.211(c).  The time 
and cost for underground coal mine operators to record shift length required by proposed 
§§ 70.201(g) and 90.201(f) is accounted for below in calculating the compliance costs 
under proposed §§ 70.211(c) and 90.211(c). 

The requirement under proposed § 71.201(d) to record shift length for DWPs 

would involve a new cost for underground coal mine operators who have surface 
operations.  Surface coal mine operators, too, would incur a new cost for recording shift 
length for their DWPs. 

MSHA estimates that it would take a miner, earning $35.30 an hour in an 

underground coal mine or $31.84 an hour in a surface mine, one minute (0.167 hours) to 
record shift length for a DWP.  MSHA estimates that the number of DWP in surface 
areas of underground coal mines are:  13 DWPs in mines with 1-19 employees; 47 DWPs 
in mines with 20-500 employees and; 29 DWPs in mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA 
estimates that the number of DWPs in surface coal mines would be:  1,107 DWPs in 
mines with 1-19 employees; 1,759 DWPs in mines with 20-500 employees and; 
64 DWPs in mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates that the average number of 
shifts per day is 1 in mines with 1-19 employees, 2 in mines with 20-500 employees, and 
2 in mines with 501+ employees.  The estimated average number of workdays per year is 
200 in underground mines with 1-19 employees and 250 in surface mines with 1-19 
employees, 300 in both underground and surface mines with 20-500 employees, and 350 
in both underground and surface mines with 501+ employees. 

The estimated annual costs for making a record of the shift length would be 

$768,300.  This figure consists of $36,100 for surface operations at underground coal and 
$732,200 for surface coal.  Costs for underground and surface operators for each mine 
size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,533 for mines with 1-19 employees (13 DWPs x 1 shift x 200 workdays x  

$35.30 x 0.0167); 

•  $16,624 for mines with 20-500 employees (47 DWPs x 2 shifts x 300 workdays x  

$35.30 x 0.0167); and, 

•  $17,951 for mines with 501+ employees (29 DWPs x 3 shifts x 350 workdays x 

$35.30 x 0.0167). 

Surface operators: 
•  $147,156 for mines with 1-19 employees (1,107 DWPs x 1 shift x 250 workdays 

x  $31.84 x 0.0167); 

 

97

•  $561,186 for mines with 20-500 employees (1,759 DWPs x 2 shifts x 300 

workdays x  $31.84 x 0.0167); and, 

•  $23,821 for mines with 501+ employees (64 DWPs x 2 shifts x 350 workdays x 

$31.84 x 0.0167). 

 
 

Costs Related to Using Gravimetric Sampler 

Proposed §§ 70.207, 70.209, 71.207 and 90.208 would revise the existing 
bimonthly sampling requirements when using the gravimetric sampler.  Currently, 
operators conduct the required sampling in one of three ways: some sample using their 
own equipment, some sample using rented equipment, and some hire contractors to 
sample.  The amount of sampling that would be required under the proposed rule is 
significantly greater than is currently required (e.g., § 70.207 would require underground 
operators to sample designated areas (DAs) on 5 consecutive production shifts and 
§ 71.207 would significantly expand the number of DWPs at surface mines).  MSHA has 
determined that the Agency’s historical experience does not provide a good indication of 
how operators would choose to sample to meet the proposed requirements.  Instead, 
MSHA assumed that due to the increased sampling requirements all mine operators 
would choose to purchase the sampling units and conduct sampling.  If some operators 
choose to use an alternative means that proves to be less expensive, then the estimated 
costs presented below would be overstated. 
 
Estimated Cost to Purchase the Sampling Devices 

MSHA assumes that underground mine operators currently have sufficient 

numbers of gravimetric samplers to conduct the sampling that would be required.  The 
estimated difference in the costs of filters, maintenance, and posting are presented below. 
As noted above, surface coal mine operators currently sample about 320 DWPs at 

approximately 225 mines.  This represents about 20 percent of all surface coal mines.  
Proposed § 71.207(b) would expand the number of DWPs and would require that all 
surface mines perform sampling.   Under the proposed rule, surface coal mine operators 
would have the option to use either a gravimetric sampler or a CPDM to conduct 
sampling.  When the rule becomes effective, MSHA assumes that surface coal mine 
operators would choose to conduct sampling only using the less expensive gravimetric 
sampler unless they have Part 90 miners who must use the CPDM.  Therefore, 898 
surface coal mines that currently do not sample would need to purchase gravimetric 
samplers. 

MSHA estimates the following number of gravimetric samplers would be needed:  

1 at each mine with 1-19 employees; 2 at each mine with 20-500 employees; and 3 at 
each mine with 501+ employees.  MSHA assumes that the 225 surface coal mines 
currently sampling have 1 gravimetric sampler per mine.  Surface coal mine operators 
already performing sampling would need 1 additional unit in mines with 20-500 

 

98

employees and 2 additional units in mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates that 
surface coal mine operators would need 1,413 additional gravimetric samplers: 

•  496 samplers in mines with 1-19 employees (620 surface mines x 80 percent); 
•  884 samplers in mines with 20-500  employees (491 surface mines x 2 samplers x 

80 percent) + (491 surface mines x 1 sampler x 20 percent); and, 

•  34 samplers in mines with 501+ employees (12 surface mines x 3 samplers x 

80 percent) + (12 surface mines x 2 samplers x 20 percent). 
MSHA estimates that each gravimetric sampler would cost $700 to purchase and 
have a useful life of 5 years.  Thus, the first year costs for surface coal mines to purchase 
the gravimetric samplers would be $989,800; $347,200 for the 620 mines with 1-19 
employees (496 samplers x $700 per sampler); $618,800 for the 491 mines with 20-500 
employees (884 samplers x $700 per sampler); and $23,800 for the 12 mines with 501+ 
employees (34 samplers x $700 per sampler). 

First year costs were multiplied by an annualization factor of 0.244 based on a 
7 percent discount rate to reflect the 5-year service life.  The annualized first year costs 
would be approximately $241,511 for surface coal mine operators. 

 

Estimated Costs for Listing the DWPs 

Proposed § 71.207(c) would require mine operators to provide the district 

manager with a list identifying the specific work positions where DWP samples would be 
collected.  MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor 5 minutes (0.0833 hours) to 
prepare the list.  The supervisor’s wage rate is $84.70 per hour at underground mines and 
$69.98 per hour at surface mines.  A clerical employee would take 5 minutes (0.0833 
hours) to type the list and mail it to MSHA.  The clerical wage is $26.00 per hour at 
underground mines and $25.45 per hour at surface mines.  Postage and handling is $1 per 
list. 
 
      First Year Costs 

In the first year after the rule would take effect, the number of lists that would be 
required is equal to the number of surface areas at underground mines plus the number of 
surface mines and facilities. 
 

Surface Areas at Underground Mines 
MSHA estimates that it would take underground coal mine operators 5.3 hours in 

 
the first year to submit the lists of the DWPs - 0.5 hours at mines with 1-19 employees 
(3 surface areas x 0.167 hours per area), 3.5 hours at mines with 20-500 (21 surface areas 
x 0.167 hours per area), and 1.3 hours at mines with 501+ employees (8 surface areas x 
0.167 hours per area).  This would result in first year costs of $326; $31 at mines with 
1-19 employees [(0.25 hours x $26.00 per hour) + (0.25 hours x $84.70 per hour) +  
(3 areas x $1 per area)], $215 at mines with 20-500 employees [(1.75 hours x $26.00 per 
hour) + (1.75 hours x $84.70 per hour) +  (21 areas x $1 per area)], and $80 at mines with 
501+ employees [(1.3 hours x $26.00 per hour) + (1.3 hours x $84.70 per hour) +  (8 
areas x $1 per area)].  These first year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying 

 

99

them by a factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at an annualized 
cost of $46. 
 

Surface Mines and Facilities 
MSHA estimates that it would take surface coal mine operators 187.5 hours in the 
first year to submit the lists of the DWPs; 103.5 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (620 
mines and facilities x 0.167 hours), 82.0 hours at mines with 20-500 (491 mines and 
facilities x 0.167 hours), and 2.0 hours at mines with 501+ employees (12 mines and 
facilities x 0.167 hours).  This would result in first year costs of $10,070; $5,559 at mines 
with 1-19 employees [(51.75 hours x $25.45 per hour) + (51.75 hours x $69.98 per hour) 
+  (620 mines and facilities x $1)], $4,404 at mines with 20-500 employees [(41.0 hours x 
$25.45 per hour) + (41.0 hours x $69.98 per hour) + (491 mines and facilities x $1)], and 
$107 at mines with 501+ employees [(1.0 hours x $25.45 per hour) + (1.0 hours x $69.98 
per hour) +  (12 mines and facilities x $1)].  These first year costs were amortized over 10 
years by multiplying them by a factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to 
arrive at annualized cost of $1,430. 
 

Annual Costs 
MSHA assumes that each year about 10 percent of underground mines with 

 
surface areas plus the number of surface mines and facilities would have to submit a new 
list of DWPs.  This 10 percent includes new mines and facilities submitting a list for the 
first time and existing mines and facilities revising the list to account for changes in their 
operations. 
 

Surface Areas at Underground Mines 
MSHA estimates that it would take underground coal mine operators 0.6 hours 

annually to submit the lists of the DWPs; 0.1 hours at mines with 1-19 employees 
(3 surface areas x 0.1 x 0.167 hours per area), 0.4 hours at mines with 20-500 (21 surface 
areas x 0.1 x 0.167 hours per area), and 0.1 hours at mines with 501+ employees 
(8 surface areas x 0.1 x 0.167 hours per area).  This would result in annual costs of $36; 
$6 at mines with 1-19 employees [(0.05 hours x $26.00 per hour) + (0.05 hours x 
$84.70 per hour) +  (3 areas x 0.1 x $1 per area)], $24 at mines with 20-500 employees 
[(0.2 hours x $26.00 per hour) + (0.2 hours x $84.70 per hour) +  (21 areas x 0.1 x $1 per 
area)], and $6 at mines with 501+ employees [(0.1 hours x $26.00 per hour) + (0.1 hours 
x $84.70 per hour) +  (8 areas x 0.1 x $1 per area)].   
 

Surface Mines and Facilities 
MSHA estimates that it would take surface coal mine operators 18.8 hours 

annually to submit the lists of the DWPs; 10.4 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (620 
mines and facilities x 0.1 x 0.167 hours), 8.2 hours at mines with 20-500 (491 mines and 
facilities x 0.1 x 0.167 hours), and 2.0 hours at mines with 501+ employees (12 mines 
and facilities x 0.1 x 0.167 hours).  This would result in annual costs of $1,009; $558 at 
mines with 1-19 employees [(5.2 hours x $25.45 per hour) + (5.2 hours x $69.98 per 
hour) +  (620 mines and facilities x 0.1 x $1)], $440 at mines with 20-500 employees 

 

100

[(4.1 hours x $25.45 per hour) + (4.1 hours x $69.98 per hour) +  (491 mines and 
facilities x $1)], and $11 at mines with 501+ employees [(0.1 hours x $25.45 per hour) + 
(0.1 hours x $69.98 per hour) +  (12 mines and facilities s x 0.1 x $1)].   
 
Estimated Costs for Sampling 

On average, MSHA estimates that it would take approximately 1 hour to prepare 
the sampling device and perform the required checks during sampling.  This time period 
includes 50 minutes (0.8333 hours) of a certified dust technician’s time to prepare, 
disassemble, and clean the sampling unit after completion of sampling.  In addition, it 
would take a mine supervisor 10 minutes (0.1666 hours) to make the required operational 
checks of the sampling device during the shift.  A certified dust technician’s hourly wage 
is estimated to be $31.77 per hour in an underground coal mine and $28.66 in a surface 
coal mine.  A supervisor’s hourly wage is estimated to be $84.70 in an underground mine 
and $69.98 in a surface mine.  The cost for each filter used is $19.89.  Two filters are 
used for each sample; the filter used to take the sample and the control filter.  The 
estimated cost to take a sample is $80.36 ($31.77 per hr. x 0.8333 hrs. + $84.70 per hr. x 
0.1666 hrs. + $19.89 per filter x 2 filters) for underground mines and $75.32 ($28.66 per 
hr. x 0.8333 hrs. + $69.98 per hr. x 0.1666 hrs. + $19.89 per filter x 2 filters) for surface 
mines. 
 

Underground Coal Mines 
Underground coal mine operators currently sample DOs on 5 consecutive shifts or 

days six times per year (i.e., bi-monthly sampling).  There would be no change for 
operator DO sampling during the first year under the proposed requirements.   However, 
in the first year, in additional to the DOs, underground mine operators would also have to 
sample the DAs quarterly on 5 consecutive shifts (rather than the current bimonthly 
sampling for one shift) using either the gravimetric sampler or the CPDM.  MSHA 
assumes operators would use the gravimetric sampler.  In the first year under the 
proposed requirements, DWPs at surface areas of underground coal mines would have to 
be sampled 4 times per year.  Although this represents a decrease in the sampling 
frequency from the bimonthly sampling required by the existing standard, the number of 
DWPs would increase under the proposed standard.  In the first year, the proposed 
requirements would reduce the sampling frequency for Part 90 miners from 6 times per 
year to 4 times per year however, the number of samples taken during each sampling 
period would be increased from 1 per Part 90 miner to 5. 

Twelve months after the effective date of the standard, operators would be 

required to perform DO sampling using the CPDM, leading to a reduction in sampling 
with the gravimetric samplers.  Eighteen months after the effective date of the standard, 
operators would be required to perform ODO sampling using the CPDM, leading to a 
further decline in gravimetric sampling. 

The costs of DO and ODO sampling using the CPDM are presented separately 

below.  However, in this section, MSHA estimates the savings to underground operators 
from not having to perform DO sampling using the gravimetric sampler.  Since the 
sampling requirements would be changing over the first two years, MSHA presents 

 

101

separate cost estimates for years one, two and thereafter. 
 

  Change in the Number of Samples 

 

 
•  The proposed requirements would make no changes to DO sampling in the first 

Year 1 

year. 

•  As noted above, proposed § 70.209(a) would require each DA to be sampled 4 
times per year rather than the 6 times per year currently required.  However, it 
would also require 5 shifts to be sampled at each DA rather than the one currently 
sampled.  Together these two changes would result in 14 additional samples being 
taken at each DA each year (i.e., 5 samples 4 times per year under the proposed 
rule minus 1 sample taken 6 times per year under the existing rule).  There are 
currently 105 DAs at underground mines with 1-19 employees, 814 DAs at 
underground mines with 20-500 employees, and 87 DAs at underground mines 
with 501+ employees.  The proposed change would result in 14,084 additional 
samples taken:  1,470 samples at mines with 1-19 employees (105 DAs x 14 
samples); 11,396 samples at mines with 20-500 employees (814 DAs x 14 
samples); and 1,218 samples at mines with 501+ employees (87 DAs x 14 
samples). 

•  Proposed § 71.207(a) would require each DWP to be sampled 4 times per year 

rather than the 6 times per year currently required.  However, proposed 
§ 71.207(b) would increase the number of DWPs from the current 11 to 89.  
Taken together the proposed rule would increase the number of DWP samples by 
290. 

o  DWP sampling at surface areas of underground mines with 1-19 

employees would increase by 52.  (Projected 13 DWPs sampled 4 times 
per year). 

o  DWP sampling at surface areas of underground mines with 20-500 

employees would increase by 152.  (Projected 47 DWPs sampled 4 times 
per year – current 6 DWPs sampled 6 times per year). 

o  DWP sampling at surface areas of underground mines with 501+ 

employees would increase by 86.  (Projected 29 DWPs sampled 4 times 
per year – current 5 DWPs sampled 6 times per year). 
 

• 

In the first year after the effective date, proposed § 90.208(a) would reduce the 
sampling frequency for Part 90 miners from 6 times per year to 4 times per year 
and would also increase the number of samples taken during each period from 1 
to 5.  14 additional samples would be taken for each Part 90 miner in the first year 
(4 x 5 – 6).  The proposed change would result in 924 additional samples:  0 at 
mines with 1-19 employees (there are no Part 90 miners at small mines); 658 
samples at mines with 20-500 employees (47 Part 90 miners x 14 samples); and 
266 samples at mines with 501+ employees (19 Part 90 miners x 14 samples). 

102

 

 

 

 

Year 2 

 
•  Beginning in the second year after the effective date, proposed § 70.201(a) would 
require all DO sampling to be conducted with the CPDM.  Therefore, the number 
of DO samples taken with the gravimetric sampler would be reduced by 
30 samples per year for each MMU (i.e., 5 samples x 6 bi-monthly sampling 
periods).  So the proposed change would result in 26,430 fewer samples taken:  
2,430 fewer samples at mines with 1-19 employees (81 MMUs x 30 samples); 
21,240 fewer samples at mines with 20-500 employees (708 MMUs x 
30 samples); and 2,760 fewer samples at mines with 501+ employees (92 MMUs 
x 30 samples). 

•  Proposed § 70.209(a) would require 5 samples to be taken at each DA 4 times per 

year.  However, proposed § 70.208(b) would convert the roofbolter DAs to 
ODOs.  Proposed § 70.201(c) would require the ODOs to be sampled with the 
CPDM (and not the gravimetric sampler) 18 months after the effective date of the 
standard.  Therefore, the amount of gravimetric sampling of DAs would decrease 
in the second year compared to the first.  There are currently 41 roofbolter DAs at 
mines with 1-19 employees, 388 roofbolter DAs at mines with 20-500 employees 
and 23 roofbolter DAs at mines with 501+ employees.  The roofbolter DAs would 
only be sampled 10 times in the second year.  This change would reduce the 
number of additional DA samples taken with the gravimetric sampler to 9,564 in 
the second year 1,060 samples at mines with 1-19 (1,470 samples – (41 roofbolter 
DAs x 10 samples per DA)); 7,516 samples at mines with 20-500 employees 
(11,396 samples – (388 roofbolter DAs x 10 samples per DA)); and 988 samples 
at mines with 501+ employees (1,218 samples – (23 roofbolter DAs x 10 samples 
per DA)). 

•  Beginning in the second year after the effective date, proposed § 90.201(a) would 

Year 3There would be no sampling of the roofbolter DAs using the 

require all Part 90 miners to be sampled with the CPDM.   This change would 
result in a decrease of 6 gravimetric samples for each Part 90 miner compared to 
the existing requirements, resulting in 396 fewer samples taken; 0 at mines with 
1-19 employees (there are no Part 90 miners at small mines); 282 samples at 
mines with 20-500 employees (47 Part 90 miners x 6 samples); and 114 samples 
at mines with 501+ employees (19 Part 90 miners x 6 samples). 
 
 
gravimetric sampler beginning in third year after the effective date.  This change 
would reduce the number of DA samples taken with the gravimetric sampler to 
5,044 in the third year: 650 samples at mines with 1-19 employees (1,470 samples 
– (41 roofbolter DAs x 20 samples per DA)); 3,636 samples at mines with 20-500 
employees (11,396 samples – (388 roofbolter DAs x 20 samples per DA)); and 
758 samples at mines with 501+ employees (1,218 samples – (23 roofbolter DAs 
x 20 samples per DA)).

Year 1Proposed § 70.209(a) would result in increased costs of 

 
$1,131,790 in the first year for DA sampling:  $118,129 at mines with 1-19 
employees (1,470 samples x $80.36 per sample); $915,783 at mines with 20-500 
employees (11,396 samples x $80.36 per sample); and $97,878 at mines with 
501+ employees (1,218 samples x $80.36 per sample). 

•  Proposed § 71.207(a) would result in increased costs of $23,304 beginning in the 
first year for DWP sampling:  $4,179 at mines with 1-19 employees (52 samples x 
$80.36 per sample); $12,215 at mines with 20-500 employees (152 samples x 
$80.36 per sample); and $6,911 at mines with 501+ employees (86 samples x 
$80.36 per sample). 

•  Proposed § 90.208(a) would result in increased costs of $74,253 in the first year 

for Part 90 miner sampling:  $52,877 at mines with 20-500 employees (658 
samples x $80.36 per sample); and $21,376 at mines with 501+ employees (266 
samples x $80.36 per sample). 
 

Year 2 

•  Proposed § 70.201(a) would result in cost savings of $2,123,915 beginning in the 

• 

second year for DO sampling:  $195,275 at mines with 1-19 employees 
(2,430 samples x $80.36 per sample); $1,706,846 at mines with 20-500 
employees (21,240 samples x $80.36 per sample); and $221,794 at mines with 
501+ employees (2,760 samples x $80.36 per sample). 
In the second year, the combination of proposed §§ 70.209(a), 70.208(b) and 
70.201(c) would result in increased costs of $768,563 for DA sampling compared 
to current practice:  $85,182 at mines with 1-19 employees (1,060 samples x 
$80.36 per sample); $603,986 at mines with 20-500 employees (7,516 samples x 
$80.36 per sample); and $79,396 at mines with 501+ employees (988 samples x 
$80.36 per sample). 

•  The costs resulting from proposed § 71.207(a) would remain unchanged in the 

second year at $23,304 for DWP sampling. 

•  Proposed § 90.201(a) would result in cost savings of $31,823 for Part 90 miner 

sampling beginning in the second year:  $22,662 at mines with 20-500 
employees (282 samples x $80.36 per sample); and $9,161 at mines with 501+ 
employees (114 samples x $80.36 per sample). 

 
Year 3  

•  The cost savings resulting from proposed § 70.201(a) would remain unchanged 

for DO sampling in the third year at $2,123,915. 

•  Beginning in the third year the costs of DA sampling would be $405,336 per year:  

$52,234 at mines with 1-19 employees (650 samples x $80.36 per sample); 
$292,189 at mines with 20-500 employees (3,636 samples x $80.36 per sample); 
and $60,913 at mines with 501+ employees (758 samples x $80.36 per sample). 
•  The costs resulting from proposed § 71.207(a) would remain unchanged in the 

third year at $23,304 for DWP sampling.

•  The cost savings resulting from proposed § 90.201(a) would remain unchanged in 

the third year at $31,823 for Part 90 miner sampling. 

 

Surface Coal Mines 
•  Proposed § 71.207(a) would require each DWP to be sampled 4 times per year 

rather than the 6 times per year currently required.  However, proposed § 
71.207(b) would increase the number of DWPs from the current 307 to 2,930.  
This would increase the number of samples taken by 9,878.DWP sampling at 
surface areas of underground mines with 1-19 employees would increase by 
3,564.  (Projected 1,107 DWPs sampling 4 times per year – current 144 DWPs 
sampling 6 times per year). 

•  DWP sampling at surface areas of underground mines with 20-500 employees 
would increase by 6,076.  (Projected 1,759 DWPs sampling 4 times per year – 
current 160 DWPs sampling 6 times per year). 

•  DWP sampling at surface areas of underground mines with 501+ employees 

would increase by 238.  (Projected 64 DWPs sampling 4 times per year – current 
3 DWPs sampling 6 times per year). 
 
Proposed § 71.207(a) would result in increased costs of $744,011 beginning in the 
first year:  $268,440 at mines with 1-19 employees (3,564 samples x $75.32 per sample); 
$457,644 at mines with 20-500 employees (6,076 samples x $75.32 per sample); and 
$17,926 at mines with 501+ employees (238 samples x $75.32 per sample). 
 

Estimated Costs for Reporting and Recordkeeping Cost of Transmitting the Samples 
Proposed §§ 70.210(c), 71.208(c) and 90.210(c) would require each sample to be 

transmitted to MSHA along with a completed dust data card.  The dust data card is 
provided by the manufacturer with each filter cassette.  On each dust data card, the 
person collecting the sample writes information about the production conditions under 
which the sample was collected.   Normally this is a certified dust technician with an 
estimated hourly wage of $31.77 in an underground coal mine and $28.66 in a surface 
coal mine.   On average, MSHA estimates that a certified dust technician would take 
6 minutes (0.1 hours) to prepare and send one sample, along with the dust data card, to 
MSHA.  MSHA estimates postage costs at $1 per sample mailed. 

After the dust data card has been filled out, a certified person signs the card and 

writes the certification number on it.  On average, MSHA estimates that a certified person 
(normally the mine safety inspector or an equivalent person) would take 1.5 minutes 
(0.025 hours) to complete and sign the dust data card.  A supervisor’s hourly wage is 
estimated to be $84.70 in an underground mine and $69.98 in a surface mine.

Year 1 

 

105

MSHA estimates that the time needed for underground coal mine operators to 

complete and sign the data cards and prepare the sample to be mailed would increase by 
1,912 hours in year one:  190 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (1,522 samples x 0.125 
hours per sample); 1,526 hours at mines with 20-500 employees (12,206 samples x 0.125 
hours per sample); and 196 hours at mines with 501+ employees (1,570 samples x 0.125 
hours per sample).  This would result in added costs of $96,293:  $9,580 at mines with 
1-19 employees [1,522 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 
per hour) + $1 per sample)]; $76,831 at mines with 20-500 employees [12,206 samples x 
((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]; and 
$9,882 at mines with 501+ employees [1,570 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + 
(0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]. 

 
Year 2 

Due to the proposed shift from the gravimetric sampler to the CPDM (for DOs, 
Part 90 miners and ODOs) in the second year after the effective date, MSHA estimates 
that the time needed for underground coal mine operators  to complete and sign the data 
cards and prepare the sample to be mailed would decline by 2,122 hours in year two:  
165 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (1,318 samples x 0.125 hours per sample);  
1,732 hours at mines with 20-500 employees (13,854 samples x 0.125 hours per sample); 
and 225 hours at mines with 501+ employees (1,800 samples x 0.125 hours per sample).  
This would result in reduced costs of $106,830:  $8,296 at mines with 1-19 employees 
[1,318 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 
per sample)]; $87,204 at mines with 20-500 employees [13,854 samples x ((0.1 hours x 
$31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]; and $11,330 at 
mines with 501+ employees [1,800 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 
hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]. 

 

Year 3 

Due to the shift from the gravimetric sampler to the CPDM (for DOs, Part 90 

miners and ODOs during the second year after the effective date), MSHA estimates that 
the time needed for underground coal mine operators  to complete and sign the data cards 
and prepare the sample to be mailed would decline by 2,687 hours in year three and 
thereafter:  216 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (1,728 samples x 0.125 hours per 
sample); 2,217 hours at mines with 20-500 employees (17,734 samples x 0.125 hours per 
sample); and 254 hours at mines with 501+ employees (2,030 samples x 0.125 hours per 
sample).  This would result in reduced costs of $135,282:  $10,877 at mines with 1-19 
employees [1,728 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 per 
hour) + $1 per sample)]; $111,627 at mines with 20-500 employees [17,734 samples x 
((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]; and 
$12,778 at mines with 501+ employees [2,030 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + 
(0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]. 

 
Surface Coal Mines 
MSHA estimates that the time needed for surface coal mine operators to complete 

and sign the data cards and prepare the sample to be mailed would increase by 1,236 

 

106

hours:  446 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (3,564 samples x 0.125 hours per 
sample); 760 hours at mines with 20-500 employees (6,076 samples x 0.125 hours per 
sample); and 30 hours at mines with 501+ employees (238 samples x 0.125 hours per 
sample).  This would result in added costs of $55,470:  $20,014 at mines with 1-19 
employees [3,564 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 per 
hour) + $1 per sample)]; $34,120 at mines with 20-500 employees [6,076 samples x ((0.1 
hours x $31.77 per hour) + (0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]; and 
$1,336 at mines with 501+ employees [238 samples x ((0.1 hours x $31.77 per hour) + 
(0.025 hours x $84.70 per hour) + $1 per sample)]. 

 
Cost of Posting the Sample Results 

After processing the gravimetric samples, the Agency sends the sample results to 

the operator.  Upon receiving the results, proposed §§ 70.211(b) and 71.209(b) would 
require mine operators to post the sampling results on the mine bulletin board.   Proposed 
§ 90.211(b) would require mine operators to provide Part 90 miners with a copy of the 
sample results.  For purposes of this cost analysis, MSHA assumes that it would take the 
same amount of time to provide a copy of the sample results to the Part 90 miner as it 
does to post the sample results on the mine bulletin board. 

MSHA’s current practice is to transmit the sampling results to the operator in a 
group, so the number of postings equate to the number of occasions when samples have 
to be taken.  Since mine operators would be required to sample the DOs, DAs and Part 90 
miners 5 times during each sampling period, the number of occasions would be equal to 
the number of samples divided by 5.  Since the DWPs are only sampled once, the number 
of occasions would be equal to the number of samples. 

On average, MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 0.1 hours 

Year 1 

(6 minutes) to copy and post the sample results.  Photocopying costs are estimated to be 
$0.15 per page.  Thus, MSHA estimates that the cost for a clerical employee to copy and 
post the sample results would be:  $2.75 for underground coal mine operators [(0.1 hrs. x 
$26.00 hourly wage) + (1 pg. x $0.15)] and $2.70 for surface coal mine operators 
[(0.1 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage) + (1 pg. x $0.15)]. 
 

Underground Coal Mines 
 
 
In the first year, there would be no change to the number of times the DO results 
would have to be posted.  Posting the DA results and providing the Part 90 miner results 
would decrease by 2 occasions due to the decrease in the sampling frequency.  For DWPs 
the frequency of posting would decrease by 2 occasions but the number of DWPs would 
increase.  So the net change in the posting of the DWP results would be four times the 
number of additional DWPs minus twice the number of current DWPs.  MSHA estimates 
that the time needed to post the gravimetric sample results would decrease by 182 hours 
in year one:  16 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (158 postings x 0.1 hours per 
posting); 155 hours at mines with 20-500 employees (1,546 postings x 0.1 hours per 
posting); and 11 hours at mines with 501+ employees (106 postings x 0.1 hours per 
posting).  This would result in cost savings of $4,979:  $435 at mines with 1-19 

 

107

employees [158 postings x ((0.1 hours x $26.00 per hour) + $0.15 per postings]; $4,252 
at mines with 20-500 employees [1,546 postings x ((0.1 hours x $26.00 per hour) + $0.15 
per posting)]; and $292 at mines with 501+ employees [106 postings x ((0.1 hours x 
$26.00 per hour) + $0.15 per posting)]. 

 
Years 2 and After 

Due to the shift from the gravimetric sampler to the CPDM (for DOs and Part 90 
miners) in the second year, beginning in the second year there would be a decrease in the 
number of gravimetric sampling results to be posted equal to 6 times the number of DOs 
and the number of results to be provided to Part 90 miners equal to 6 times the number of 
Part 90 miners.  The decrease in the number of DA sampling result postings would 
remain at twice the number of DAs and the change in the number of postings of the DWP 
sampling results would remain at four times the number of additional DWPs minus twice 
the number of current DWPs.  MSHA estimates that the time needed post the gravimetric 
sample results would decrease by 746 hours in the second year:  75 hours at mines with 
1-19 employees (748 postings x 0.1 hours per posting); 598 hours at mines with 20-500 
employees (5,982 postings x 0.1 hours per posting); and 73 hours at mines with 501+ 
employees (734 postings x 0.1 hours per posting).  This would result in decreased costs 
of $20,527:  $2,057 at mines with 1-19 employees [748 postings x ((0.1 hours x $26.00 
per hour) + $0.15 per postings]; $16,451 at mines with 20-500 employees [5,982 postings 
x ((0.1 hours x $26.00 per hour) + $0.15 per posting)]; and $2,019 at mines with 501+ 
employees [734 postings x ((0.1 hours x $26.00 per hour) + $0.15 per posting)]. 

 
Surface Coal Mines 
MSHA estimates that the time needed for surface coal mine operators to complete 

and sign the dust data cards and prepare the sample to be mailed would increase by 
988 hours:  356 hours at mines with 1-19 employees (3,564 samples x 0.1 hours per 
sample); 608 hours at mines with 20-500 employees (6,076 samples x 0.1 hours per 
sample); and 24 hours at mines with 501+ employees (238 samples x 0.1 hours per 
sample).  This would result in added costs of $26,621:  $9,605 at mines with 1-19 
employees [3,564 samples x ((0.1 hours x $25.45 per hour) + $0.15 per sample)]; 
$16,375 at mines with 20-500 employees [6,076 samples x ((0.1 hours x $25.45 per hour) 
+ $0.15 per sample)]; and $641 at mines with 501+ employees [238 samples x ((0.1 hours 
x $25.45 per hour) + $0.15 per sample)]. 
 

Status change reports 
If there is a change in operational status that affects the respirable dust sampling 

 
requirements, the operator shall report the change in operational status of the mine, MMU 
or DA (under proposed § 70.212(a) and (b) for underground coal operators) and the mine 
or DWP (under proposed § 71.210(a) and (b) for surface coal operators) to the MSHA 
District Manager or to any other MSHA office designated by the District Manager.  
Status changes shall be reported in writing or electronically within 3 working days after 
the status change has occurred.  Operators are already required to provide status change 
reports to MSHA District Managers under existing § 70.220 for underground coal mines 
and existing § 71.220 for surface coal mines.  The number of status change reports 

 

108

generated as a result of the proposed rule is expected to be small; the costs for these 
proposed standards are minimal and not included in this analysis. 
 

Summary 
Table V-20 shows that the net present value first year costs related to performing 

sampling with a gravimetric sampler would be a net cost savings of approximately 
$10.6 million for underground coal mine operators, and increased costs of approximately 
$1.8 million for surface coal mine operators.

CPDM Plans at Underground Mines 
Proposed §§ 70.206 and 90.206 
Cost to Write and Submit CPDM Plans to MSHA for Approval 

Proposed §§ 70.206(a), 71.206(a) and 90.206(a) and (b) are new and would 

require operators who use CPDMs to develop and submit for approval a CPDM 
Performance Plan (Plan) prior to using them.  The proposal specifies the information that 
would be required to be contained in the Plan and would establish Plan approval 
procedures. 

Since surface mine operators are not expected to use CPDMs to sample unless 

they have Part 90 miners who are required to use the CPDM, proposed § 71.206 is 
discussed later in this analysis when developing CPDM plans for Part 90 miners at 
surface coal mines. 

Each underground coal mine operator would need a CPDM plan.  MSHA expects 

that underground coal mine operators  would develop an initial plan that addresses DO, 
Part 90 miner, and ODO sampling even though the proposed requirements for DO and 
Part 90 miner sampling with a CPDM would begin 6 months before the proposed 
requirement to use the CPDM to conduct ODO sampling.  This would be more efficient 
than having to make significant plan revisions less than 6 months later to include ODO 
sampling. 

Also, MSHA expects that underground coal mine operators would include 

information about Part 90 miners in the CPDM plan, if applicable, rather than develop a 
completely different plan for Part 90 miners.  However, under proposed § 90.206(d), any 
Part 90 miner information included in a CPDM plan may not be posted, but must be 
provided to the affected Part 90 miner.  MSHA expects that operators will meet these 
requirements. 

  Each underground coal mine would need a CPDM plan resulting in:  81 plans for 

mines with 1-19 employees; 331 plans for mines with 20-500 employees; and 12 plans 
for mines with 501+ employees.  On average, MSHA estimates that it would take a 
supervisor 4 hours to write a proposed CPDM plan and a clerical employee 15 minutes 
(0.25 hours) to copy and submit it.  MSHA estimates that, on average, the copy and 
postage costs are $1.60 for mines with 1-19 employees [(4 pgs. x $0.15) + $1 postage] 
and $2.20 for mines with 20 or more employees [(8 pgs. x $0.15) + $1 postage].  MSHA 
estimates that first year costs for underground coal mine operators to write CPDM plans 

 

110

and submit them to MSHA would be approximately $147,300.  Costs for each mines size 
are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $28,099 in mines with 1-19 employees [81 plans x ((4 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $1.60)]; 

•  $115,023 in mines with 20-500 employees [331 plans x ((4 hrs. x $84.70 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $2.20)]; and 

•  $4,170 in mines with 501+ employees [12 plans x ((4 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $2.20)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying them by an 

annualization factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized 
costs of approximately $21,000 for underground coal mine operators. 

 
Costs to Revise Proposed Plans 
MSHA estimates that 35 percent of mine operators that submit proposed CPDM 
plans to the Agency for approval would need to revise the plans before MSHA approval 
could be obtained.  MSHA estimates that the number of plans to be revised would be:  
28 plans for mines with 1-19 employees (81 plans x 0.35); 116 plans for mines with 
20-500 employees (331 plans x 0.35); and 4 plans for mines with 501+ employees 
(12 plans x 0.35).  On average, MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor 
30 minutes (0.5 hours) to revise a proposed plan and 15 minutes (0.25 hours) for a 
clerical employee to copy and resubmit the plan.  Copy and postage costs are the same as 
determined above.  MSHA estimates that first year costs for underground coal mine 
operators to develop and submit revised proposed CPDM plans would be approximately 
$7,600.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $1,413 in mines with 1-19 employees [28 plans x ((0.5 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 

rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $1.60)]; 

•  $5,922 in mines with 20-500 employees [116 plans x ((0.5 hrs. x $84.70 hourly 

wage rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $2.20)]; and 

•  $200 in mines with 501+ employees [4 plans x ((4 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate) 

+ (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $2.20)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying them by an 

annualization factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized 
cost of approximately $1,000 for underground coal mine operators. 
 
Cost to Notify and Provide to the Miners’ Representative a Copy of the Proposed CPDM 
Plans and Revisions Submitted to MSHA for Approval 

Proposed § 70.206(a)(1) would require underground mine operators to notify the 
miners’ representative at least 5 days prior to submitting a CPDM Performance Plan, or 
any proposed revision to the Plan, to the District Manager for approval.  The proposal 

 

111

would also require operators to provide a copy of the Plan to the miners' representative, if 
requested. 

MSHA made the conservative assumption that the plan would be requested 

100 percent of the time at underground coal mines.  MSHA estimates that the number of 
proposed CPDM plans and proposed plan revisions that operators would provide to the 
representative of the miners would be:  109 plans at mines with 1-19 employees (81 plans 
+ 28 revised plans); 447 plans (331 plans + 116 revised plans) at mines with 20-500 
employees; and 16 plans (12 plans + 4 revised plans) at mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to 

notify and provide a copy of the plan to the miners’ representative.  MSHA estimates that 
copy costs are $0.60 (4 pgs. x $0.15) for mines with 1-19 employees and $1.20 (8 pgs. x 
$0.15) for mines with 20 or more employees).  There are no postage costs because 
MSHA assumes that a copy of the plan would be given to the representative of the miners 
at the mine site.  MSHA estimates that first year costs to underground coal mine 
operators to notify and provide to the miners’ representative proposed and revised CPDM 
plans submitted to MSHA for approval would be approximately $4,300.  Costs for each 
mine size are shown below: 
Underground Operators: 
•  $774 for mines with 1-19 employees [109 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly 

wage rate) + $0.60)]; 

•  $3,442 for mines with 20-500 employees [447 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly 

wage rate) + $1.20)]; and 

•  $123 for mines with 501+ employees [16 plans x ((0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage 

rate) + $1.20)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying by an annualization 

factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized costs of 
approximately $600 for underground coal mine operators. 
 
Make Available a Copy of the Proposed CPDM Plan or Revisions Submitted to MSHA 
for Approval 

Proposed § 70.206(a)(2) would require underground coal mine operators  to have 

a copy of any proposed CPDM plan or revision, submitted for approval, available for 
inspection by the representative of miners.  MSHA expects that underground coal mines 
would not incur any costs to comply with this proposed standard because coal mine 
operators normally have copies of their plans available for inspection. 
 
Costs to Post Proposed CPDM Plans or Revisions Submitted to MSHA for Approval 

Proposed § 70.206(a)(3) would require a copy of the proposed Plan or revisions 
submitted for approval to be posted on the mine bulletin board at the time of submittal.  
The proposed plan or revision would be required to remain posted on the bulletin board 
until approved, withdrawn or denied. As was stated earlier, MSHA expects that one 

 

112

CPDM plan would be developed by each underground mine operator.  The copy of any 
plan that is posted would have the language that pertains to the Part 90 miner edited out. 

The number of plans and revisions to be posted is the same as the number 
previously estimated that would have to be provided to the miners’ representative: 
109 plans at mines with 1-19 employees; 447 plans at mines with 20-500 employees; and 
16 plans at mines with 501+ employees.  MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would 
take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to edit, copy, and post the proposed plans and revisions.  
Copy costs are the same as above - $0.60 (4 pgs. x $0.15) for mines with 1-19 employees 
and $1.20 (8 pgs. x $0.15) for mines with 20 or more employees.  There are no postage 
costs.  MSHA estimates that first year cost to underground coal mine operators to copy 
and post proposed and revised CPDM plans submitted to MSHA for approval would be 
approximately $4,300.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $774 for mines with 1-19 employees [109 plans x (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage 

rate + $0.60)]; 

•  $3,442 for mines with 20-500 employees [447 plans  to post  x (0.25 hrs. x 

$26.00 hourly wage rate + $1.20)]; and 

•  $123 for mines with 501+ employees [16 plans to post x (0.25 hrs. x 

$26.00 hourly wage rate + $1.20)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying by an annualization 

factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized cost of 
approximately $600 for underground coal mine operators. 
 
Comments Submitted by Representative of Miners 

Proposed §§ 70.206(a)(4) would address procedures for miners’ representatives to 

provide comments on the Plan to the District Manager.  It would permit the miners’ 
representative, following receipt of a proposed Plan or proposed revision, to submit 
timely, written comments to the District Manager for consideration during the review 
process.  The proposal would also require the District Manager to provide a copy of the 
miners’ representative’s comments to the operator upon the operator’s request. This 
provision does not impose any costs on coal mine operators.  MSHA estimated no costs 
for the miners’ representatives because the submission of comments is voluntary. 
 
Contents of CPDM Plan 

Proposed §§ 70.206(b) and 90.206(c) would specify the information that would be 

required in CPDM Performance Plans. There would be no additional costs associated 
with these proposed requirements because they were already included in the estimated 
costs to develop and submit CPDM plans to MSHA for approval. 
  
Posting and Providing Approved Plans 

Proposed §§ 70.206(c) would require a copy of the approved plan to be posted 

and to be provided to the miners’ representative upon request.  MSHA has not estimated 

 

113

any additional costs for this proposed requirement because the costs of posting and 
providing copies to the miners’ representatives of all of the proposed plans and revisions 
were included in MSHA’s estimates presented earlier.  Proposed § 90.206(d) would 
require that if the mine has Part 90 miners, then they need to be given a copy of the 
approved plan.  As of January 2010 there were:  no Part 90 miners in mines with 1-19 
employees; 47 Part 90 miners in mines with 20-500 employees; and 19 Part 90 miners in 
mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to 

edit, copy, and post the proposed plans and revisions.  Copy costs are the same as 
determined above.  There are no postage costs.  MSHA estimates that first year costs to 
underground coal mine operators to copy and post proposed and revised CPDM plans 
submitted to MSHA for approval would be approximately $500.  Costs for each mine 
size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $0 for mines with 1-19 employees; 
•  $362 for mines with 20-500 employees [47 plans x (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly 

 

wage rate + $1.20)]; and 

•  $146 for mines with 501+ employees [19 plans x (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage 

rate + $1.20)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying by an annualization 

factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized cost of 
approximately $70 for underground coal mine operators. 

 
Costs of Revising Approved CPDM Plans 
Cost to Revise and Submit Revisions to Approved CPDM Plans 
 
operators  would occur under proposed §§ 70.206(d), 70.208(f)(4), 70.208(g)(4), 
70.209(g)(4), 90.206(b), 90.206(e), 90.209(e)(4) and 90.209(f)(4).  MSHA also expects 
that a small number of revisions could address new mines that use and would need to 
revise model plans. 

MSHA expects that revisions to approved CPDM plans by underground coal mine 

MSHA estimates that 25 percent of underground coal mine operators  would 

propose revisions to approved CPDM plans each year:  20 mines with 1-19 employees 
(81 x 0. 25); 83 mines with 20-500 employees (331 x 0.25); and 3 mines with 501+ 
employees (12 x 0.25).  On average, MSHA estimates that a supervisor would take 
15 minutes (0.25 hours) to revise an approved plan and a clerical employee would take 
15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and submit the revision.  Copy and postage costs per 
revision would be $1.30 [(2 pgs. x $0.15) + $1 postage].  MSHA estimates that the 
number of plan revision per mine would be:  2 revisions in mines with 1-19 employees; 
4 revisions in mines with 20-500 employees; and 6 revisions in mines with 501+ 
employees.  Since CPDMs would not be required to be used until 12 months after the 
final rule became effective, revisions to approved plans are assumed to begin after that 
time.  Therefore, the annual costs beginning in year 2 were discounted by applying a 
discount factor of 0.925 based on 7 percent. 

 

114

MSHA estimates that the discounted annual costs for underground coal mine 

operators to revise their approved CPDM plans would be approximately $10,450.  Costs 
for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $1,072 for mines with 1-19 employees [20 mines x 2 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$84.70) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)] x 0.925; 

•  $8,899 for mines with 20-500 employees [83 mines x 4 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. 

x $84.70) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)] x 0.925; and 

•  $483 for mines with 501+ employees [3 mines x 6 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$84.70) + (0.25 hrs. x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $1.30)] x 0.925. 

 
Cost to Notify and Provide the Miners’ Representative a Copy of the Approved CPDM 
Plan and Revisions to Approved CPDM Plans 

Proposed § 70.206(c)(1) would require the approved CPDM Plan and revisions to 

the Plan be provided to the representative of miners upon request.  MSHA made the 
conservative assumption that approved plan revisions would be requested 100 percent of 
the time at underground coal mines.  On average, MSHA estimates that a clerical 
employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and provide the revisions of the 
approved CPDM plan to the miners’ representative.  On average, MSHA estimates that 
copy costs for approved plan revisions would be $0.30 (2 pgs. x $0.15).  There are no 
postage costs because MSHA assumes that a copy of the plan would be given to the 
representative of the miners at the mine site.  The discount factor of 0.925 based on a 
7 percent discount rate is applied to the annual costs for the same reason as noted above.  
MSHA estimates that the annual costs for underground coal mine operators to provide 
approved CPDM plan revisions to the representative of the miners would be 
approximately $2,450.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $252 for mines with 1-19 employees [20 mines x 2 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$26.00 hourly wage rate) + $0.30)] x 0.925; 

•  $2,089 for mines with 20-500 employees [83 mines x 4 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. 

x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $0.30)] x 0.925; and 

•  $113 for mines with 501+ employees [3 mines x 6 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$26.00 hourly wage rate) + $0.30)] x 0.925. 

 
Make Copies Available of the Approved Plan and Revisions 

Proposed § 70.206(c)(2) would require coal mine operators  to have a copy of the 
approved plan and any revisions available for inspection by the representative of miners.  
MSHA expects that underground coal mines would not incur any costs to comply with 
this proposal because mine operators normally have copies of their approved plans 
available for inspection. 
 

 

115

Cost to Post Approved CPDM Plans and Revisions 

Proposed §§ 70.206(c)(3) would require the approved Plan and revisions be 

posted on the mine bulletin board within 1 working day following notification of 
approval, and to remain posted for the period that the Plan is in effect. Proposed 
§ 90.206(d) would require that Part 90 miners be given a copy of the plan.  As was stated 
earlier, MSHA expects that one CPDM plan would be developed by each underground 
mine operator.  The Part 90 miner would be provided the entire plan and the plan that is 
posted would have the language that pertains to the Part 90 miner edited out.  The 
number of revised CPDM plans submitted for approval was determined above. 

MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to 

copy and post or copy and provide revisions to the Part 90 miner.  Copy costs are the 
same as determined above.  There are no postage costs.  Since these costs would begin in 
the second year, a discount factor of 0.925 based on a 7 percent discount rate, was 
applied to the annual costs for the same reason noted above.  MSHA estimates that 
annual costs for underground coal mine operators to copy and post approved CPDM plan 
revisions would be approximately $2,450.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $252 for mines with 1-19 employees [20 mines x 2 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$26.00 hourly wage rate) + $0.30)] x 0.925; 

•  $2,089 for mines with 20-500 employees [83 mines x 4 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. 

x $26.00 hourly wage rate) + $0.30)] x 0.925; and 

•  $113 for mines with 501+ employees [3 mines x 6 revisions/yr. x ((0.25 hrs. x 

$26.00 hourly wage rate) + $0.30)] x 0.925.

Using CPDMs at Underground Mines 
Cost of CPDM Training for Miners Expected to Use a CPDM 

Proposed §§ 70.201(j) and 90.201(h) are new and require that training be 

provided to all miners expected to wear a CPDM.  The training shall be completed prior 
to a miner being required to wear a CPDM and repeated every 12 months thereafter.  The 
training would include: 1) explaining the basic features and capabilities of the CPDM; 
2) how to setup the CPDM for compliance sampling; 3) a discussion of the various types 
of information displayed by the CPDM and how to access that information; 4) how to 
start and stop a short-term sample run during compliance sampling; and 5) the 
importance of continuously monitoring dust concentrations and properly wearing the 
CPDM. 

The number of miners at underground coal mines expected to be trained on the 
use of the CPDM is based upon the number of MMUs, the number of shifts per day, the 
number of MMUs using supplementary controls, and the number of Part 90 miners.  This 
training is assumed to occur in the first year after the rule become effective.  MSHA 
assumes that: 

•  Every MMU operating 1 shift per day would have 1 DO and 1 ODO each using a 

CPDM; 

•  Every MMU operating 2 shifts per day would have 1 DO and 2 ODOs per shift 

each using a CPDM; 

•  20 percent of total shifts operating per day would have 1 additional person (ODO) 

to be monitored with a CPDM; 

•  Each Part 90 miner would use a CPDM; 
•  The number of additional persons needing to wear a CPDM for MMUs using 
supplementary controls in accordance with proposed § 70.208(h) would be:  
24 persons at MMUs in mines with 1-19 employees; 150 persons at MMUs in 
mines with 20-500 persons; and no persons at MMUs in mines with 501+ 
employees; and 

•  On every shift, 1 additional person would be trained on how to use a CPDM to 

account for unexpected absences. 
MMUs operate on:  93 shifts in mines with 1-19 employees (69 MMUs x 1 shift 

per day + 12 MMUs x 2 shifts per day); 1,445 shifts in mines with 20-500 employees 
(45 MMUs x 1 shift per day + 589 shifts x 2 shifts per day + 74 MMUs x 3 shifts per 
day); and 273 shifts in mines with 501+ employees (3 MMUs x 2 shifts per day + 
89 MMUs x 3 shifts per day).  Based on the above, the number of persons in underground 
coal mines that MSHA estimates would need to be trained on using a CPDM is: 
 
 
 

346 persons in mines with 1-19 employees 
 
 

[69 MMUs x 1 shift x (1 DO + 1 ODO] +

to use the CPDM.  MSHA estimates that the annual costs of miners’ time to receive 
annual CPDM training would be approximately $136,500.  Costs for each mine size are 
shown below: 

MSHA estimates that it would take 30 minutes (0.5 hours) to train a miner on how 

Underground operators: 
•  $6,107 for mines with 1-19 employees (346 miners x 0.5 hrs. x $35.30 hourly 

wage rate); 

•  $109,801 for mines with 20-500 employees (6,221 miners x 0.5 hrs. x 

$35.30 hourly wage rate); and 

•  $20,580 for mines with 501+ employees (1,166 miners x 0.5 hrs. x $35.30 hourly 

wage rate). 
Also, MSHA estimates that the person certified in sampling with a CPDM, 

earning $31.77 per hour in an underground coal mine, would spend 30 minutes 
(0.5 hours) providing one CPDM training session for each shift that an MMU operates.  
Since the number of training sessions equals the number of shifts MMUs operate, there 
will be:  93 training sessions for mines with 1-19 employees; 1,445 training sessions for 
mines with 20-500 employees; and 273 training sessions for mines with 501+ employees.  
MSHA estimates that the annual costs for a certified technician, earning an hourly wage 
rate of $31.77, to provide the annual CPDM training to miners would be approximately 
$28,800.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,477 for mines with 1-19 employees (93 training sessions x 0.5 hrs. x 

$31.77 hourly wage rate); 

•  $22,954 for mines with 20-500 employees (1,445 training sessions x 0.5 hrs. x 

$31.77 hourly wage rate); and 

 

119

•  $4,337 for mines with 501+ employees (273 training sessions x 0.5 hrs. x 

$31.77 hourly wage rate). 

Proposed §§ 70.201(k) and 90.201(i) are new and require coal mine operators  

 
 Costs of Records for CPDM Training 
 
keep a record of miners who receive CPDM training.  The estimated number of miners at 
underground mines who would receive CPDM training was presented in the previous 
section; 346 miners in mines with 1-19 employees; 6,277 miners in mines with 20-500 
employees; and 1,190 miners in mines with 501+ employees. 

MSHA estimates that it would take a clerical employee 0.00833 hours 

(30 seconds) to make a record of each miner who received CPDM training.  MSHA 
estimates that the annual costs to make records for miners receiving CPDM training 
would be approximately $1,700.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $75 for mines with 1-19 employees (346 miners x 0.00833 hrs. x $26 hourly wage 

rate); 

•  $1,347 for mines with 20-500 employees (6,221 miners x 0.00833 hrs. x 

$26 hourly wage rate); and 

•  $252 for mines with 501+ employees (1,166 miners x 0.00833 hrs. x $26 hourly 

wage rate). 

 
Costs Incurred When Using a CPDM to Sample 
Proposed §§ 70.201(a) and 90.201(a) would require that DOs in each MMU and 
 
Part 90 miners be sampled with CPDMs beginning 12 months after the effective date of 
the final rule.  Proposed § 70.201(c) would require that ODOs associated with an MMU 
be sampled with CPDMs beginning 18 months after the effective date of the final rule.  
Proposed § 70.208(h) would require the use of the CPDM to sample while supplementary 
controls are used. 
 
Costs to Purchase Related Equipment When Using a CPDM to Sample 
 
Proposed §§ 70.210(f) and 90.210(f) are new and would apply when operators use 
CPDMs to sample.  The proposal would require that, within 12 hours after the end of the 
last sampling shift of the work week, a designated mine official must validate, certify, 
and transmit electronically to MSHA all daily sample and error data file information 
collected during the previous calendar week (Sunday through Saturday) and stored in the 
CPDM.  The proposal would also require the operator to maintain all CPDM data files 
transmitted to MSHA for at least 12 months. 
 
use a CPDM.  Proposed § 70.211(c) would require the designated mine official to 
validate, certify, and post certain sampling information on the mine bulletin board.  
Proposed § 90.211(c) would require certain sampling information be provided to Part 90 
miners. 

Proposed §§ 70.211(c) and 90.211(c) are new and would apply to operators who 

 

120

MSHA had determined that a computer would be needed to download the 

sampling data from the CPDM and transmit it to MSHA.  A printer would also be needed 
to print the data so that copies can be posted and provided to the miners’ representative 
and Part 90 miners. 

Proposed §§ 70.204(d) and 90.204(d) are new and would require that when 

CPDMS are used, a person certified in sampling or in maintenance and calibration follow 
the examination, testing, and set-up procedures contained in the approved CPDM 
Performance Plan.  MSHA has determined that a flow meter would be needed to perform 
the required calibration of the CPDM. 

MSHA estimates that 75 percent of mines would need to purchase a computer and 
printer to process information generated by the CPDM.  The number of underground coal 
mine operators that would need computers and printers would be:  61 mines with 1-19 
employees (81 mines x 75 percent); 248 mines with 20-500 employees (331 mines x 
75 percent); and 9 mines with 501+ employees (12 mines x 75 percent).  In addition, to 
perform the required monthly calibration on a CPDM, a flow meter would be needed to 
conduct a flow audit.  MSHA estimates that the number of mines that would need to 
purchase a flow meter is:  81 mines with 1-19 employees (all mines in this size group) 
and 83 mines with 20-500 employees (331 mines x 25 percent).  MSHA expects that all 
mines with 501+ employees currently have flow meters.  MSHA estimates that a 
computer and printer cost $1,000 (includes ink and paper) and a flow meter costs $1,700.  
MSHA estimates a 5 year life for the computer, printer and flow meter.  MSHA estimates 
that underground coal mine operators ’ first year cost to purchase computers, printers and 
flow meters when using CPDMs would be approximately $597,000.  Costs for each mine 
size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $198,700 for mines with 1-19 employees [(61 mines x 1 computer and printer x 

$1,000) + (81 mines x 1 flow meter x $1,700)]; 

•  $389,100 for mines with 20-500 employees [(248 mines x 1 computer and printer 

x $1,000) + (83 mines x 1 flow meter x $1,700)]; and 

•  $9,000 for mines with 501+ employees (9 mines x 1 computer and printer x 

$1,000). 
First year costs were multiplied by an annualization factor of 0.244 based on a 
7 percent discount rate to reflect a 5 year service life for the computer, printer and flow 
meter.  The annualized first year costs would be approximately $145,600 for underground 
coal mine operators. 
 
Costs to Purchase CPDMs (including Warranty) 
 
to use CPDMs to sample the DO in each MMU during each production shift beginning 
12 months after the effective date of the final rule.  Proposed §§ 90.201(a) and 
90.209(a)(1) are new and would require operators to use CPDMs to sample the work 
environment of each Part 90 miner during each shift beginning 12 months after the 
effective date of the standard.  Proposed §§ 70.201(c) and 70.208(a)(2) are new and 

Proposed § 70.201(a) and 70.208(a)(1) are new and would require mine operators 

 

121

would require mine operators using CPDMs to sample ODOs in each MMU during each 
production shift for 14 consecutive calendar days during each quarterly period beginning 
18 months after the effective date of the final rule.  Proposed § 70.208(h) would provide 
that for the 24-month period following the effective date of the final rule, if an operator is 
unable to maintain compliance with the applicable standard for an MMU and the operator 
determines that all feasible engineering or environmental controls are being used on the 
MMU, the operator may request approval for the use of supplementary controls in 
conjunction with monitoring miners’ exposures with CPDMs to reduce affected miners’ 
dust exposure.  MSHA estimated the costs based upon the number of CPDMs that would 
be required to comply with each provision. 
 
 
before it needs to be recharged.  Recharging would take at least 6 hours.  One CPDM 
would be needed to sample a DO at an MMU that operates one shift per day.  Two 
CPDMs would needed to sample each DO at an MMU operating two shifts per day since 
the CPDM used for the first shift would be recharging during the second shift.  Also, two 
CPDMs would be needed to sample each DO at an MMU that operates three shifts per 
day because the same CPDM could be used on the first and third shifts. 

CPDMs Needed for DO and Part 90 Miner Sampling 
There is one DO during each shift at each MMU.  A CPDM operates for 12 hours 

Each Part 90 miner would need a CPDM.  In January 2010, there were 66 Part 
90 miners:  none employed at mines with 1-19 employees, 47 employed at mines with 
20-500 employees and 19 employed at mines with 501+ employees. 

Since the proposed rule would require DO and Part 90 miner sampling with a 

CPDM to begin 12 months after the effective date of the final rule, MSHA expects that 
operators would purchase CPDMs to perform DO and Part 90 sampling within that 12 
month period.  MSHA estimates that underground coal mine operators  would purchase 
1,714 CPDMs to perform DO and Part 90 miner sampling required by the proposed rule.  
CPDM purchases for each mine size are shown below: 

•  93 CPDMs for mines with 1-19 employees [(69 MMUs with one shift per day x 

1 CPDM) + (12 MMUs with two shifts per day x 2 CPDMs)]; 

•  1,418 CPDMs for mines with 20-500 employees [(45 MMUs with one shift per 
day x 1 CPDM) + (589 MMUs with two shifts per day x 2 CPDMs) + 74 MMUs 
with three shifts per day x 2 CPDMs)] + [47 Part 90 miners x 1 CPDM]; and 

 

•  203 CPDMs for mines with 501+ employees [(3 MMUs with two shifts per day x 

2 CPDMs) + 89 MMUs with three shifts per day x 2 CPDMs)] + [19 Part 90 
miners x 1 CPDM]. 
CPDMs Needed for ODO Sampling 
Since proposed § 70.208(a)(2) would require that each ODO be sampled for only 
14 days per quarter, one CPDM can be used to sample several ODOs.  MSHA estimates 
that 1 CPDM would be needed in mines with 1-19 employees and 2 CPDMs would be 
needed in mines with 20-500 and 501+ employees. 

•  81 CPDMs for mines with 1-19 with employees (81 mines x 1 CPDMs); 
•  662 CPDMs for mines with 20-500 employees (331 mines x 2 CPDMs); and 
•  24 CPDMs for mines with 501+ employees (12 mines x 2 CPDMs). 

 

122

CPDMs Needed for Sampling During the Use of Supplementary Controls 
Under proposed § 70.208(h), supplementary controls could be used on MMUs for 
a 6 month period during the first 24 months after the effective date of the final rule if an 
operator is unable to maintain compliance with the applicable dust standard for the 
MMU.  Based upon the feasibility analysis presented previously, MSHA has determined 
that all mines can comply with the proposed respirable dust standards given the two-year 
phase-in of the lower dust exposure limits. 

However, since proposed full-shift sampling (proposed § 70.201(e)) and 

single-sample (proposed § 72.800) provisions would be effective on the effective date of 
the rule, it may not be feasible for all mines to comply with proposed dust standards 
during the first 24-month period.  It is likely that the provisions that take immediate effect 
would have the greatest impact on the MMU currently operating under a reduced 
standard due to the presence of quartz.  Therefore, MSHA based the costs of complying 
with proposed § 70.208(h) on MMUs currently operating under a reduced standard of 
0.5 mg/m3 where at least 50 percent of the operators’ sample results were above the 
applicable standard in 2009; based on data and experience, the Agency expects these 
MMUs would most likely need supplementary controls to meet the proposed standards. 

In estimating the cost of the engineering controls, MSHA determined that 

29 MMUs (4 MMUs in mines with 1-19 employees and 25 MMUs in mines with 20-500 
employees) are currently operating under a reduced standard of 0.5 mg/m3 and had at 
least 50 percent of the operators sample results above the applicable standard in 2009.  
MSHA expects that these 29 MMUs would institute controls in addition to those being 
instituted at the other MMUs. 

MSHA expects that operators with MMUs using supplementary controls would 

need to monitor additional occupations with CPDMs and would need to purchase CPDMs 
in addition to those purchases estimated above to monitor DOs, ODOs, and Part 90 
miners.   MSHA assumes that where supplementary controls would be used on the MMU 
3 CPDMs in addition to the CPDM needed to sample the DO would be required on each 
shift.  MSHA assumes that operators using supplementary controls operate an average of 
2 shifts per day.  MSHA estimates that the number of additional CPDMs used by 
underground coal mine operators when supplementary controls would be used would be: 

•  24 CPDMs for MMUs in mines with 1-19 employees (4 MMUs x 3 CPDMs x 

2 shifts); and, 

•  150 CPDMs for MMUs in mines with 20-500 employees (25 MMUs x 3 CPDMs 

x 2 shifts). 
Costs of the CPDMs (including warranty) 
MSHA estimates the average cost of a CPDM to be $10,000.  MSHA assumes 

that a 5 year warranty would be purchased at a cost of $2,875 with each CPDM sold and 
that the service life of a CPDM is 5 years.  First year costs were multiplied by an 
annualization factor of 0.244 based on a 7 percent discount rate to amortize the costs of 
the CPDM over its 5 year service life.  Costs for CPDMs purchased for ODO sampling 
were multiplied by a discount factor of 0.903 based on 7 percent to reflect the fact that 
these CPDMs would be purchased 18 months after the final rule goes into effect.  Costs 
for CPDMs for the DO and Part 90 miner sampling, and for sampling where 

 

123

supplemental controls would be used were not discounted since MSHA expects the costs 
to occur in the first year. 

Table V-24 shows that the estimated first year costs to purchase CPDMs would be 

approximately $33.2 million.  Annualized first year costs would be approximately 
$8.1 million.

Additional CPDMs 

MSHA expects that additional CPDMs would be needed at times when deployed 
CPDMs are not operating correctly (e.g., units are not fully charged or require cleaning).  
There are approximately 120 CPDMs already purchased by underground coal mine 
operators, and additional orders for CPDMs are expected to continue in the future.  
MSHA expects that, before the final rule goes into effect, there would be at least 200 
CPDMs owned by underground coal mine operators.  Since these units are in excess of 
the number that would be needed to comply with the proposed requirements, the costs of 
which were presented above, they represent a stockpile of spare units.  When the 

 

124

supplemental controls are no longer being used, the CPDMs used during the period while 
supplemental controls were being used represent a second stock pile of spares units. 

Since large mine operators are currently purchasing most of the CPDMs, MSHA 

expects that most of the spare CPDMs would end up being owned by the larger mine 
operators.  MSHA did not estimate the cost of spare units for smaller operators because 
MSHA assumed that the small mines with 1 to 19 employees would be able to handle a 
problem with one of their CPDMs without purchasing a spare.  In estimating the costs for 
small mines, MSHA assumed that each operator would purchase one CPDM per MMU 
per shift for DO sampling and an additional unit for the other ODO sampling.  Since 
§ 70.208(a)(2) only requires the sampling of the ODOs for 14 consecutive shifts each 
quarter, MSHA expects that if one CPDM is not working then the operator would send 
that unit to be repaired, delay the ODO sampling until the end of the quarter and use the 
other CPDM for DO sampling.  MSHA expects that the broken CPDM can be repaired 
and returned in time for quarterly ODO sampling. 
 
Cost for CPDM Filters 

Filters Needed 

A new CPDM filter is needed for each CPDM used on every shift sampled.  The 

number of CPDMs used on each shift depends on the type of sampling conducted. 

DO and Part 90 miner sampling 
The DO sampling with a CPDM would occur on every production shift.  There is 
1 DO sampled with a CPDM on each shift.  The number of shifts per day multiplied by 
the number of CPDMs used on each shift equates to the number of CPDM filters used per 
day.  For underground mines, MSHA estimates that the number of shifts per day operated 
by MMUs would be:  93 shifts in mines with 1-19 employees (69 MMUs operating 
1 shift per day + 12 MMUs operating 2 shifts per day); 1,445 shifts in mines with 20-500 
employees (45 MMUs x 1 shift per day + 589 shifts x 2 shifts per day + 74 MMUs x 
3 shifts per day); and 273 shifts in mines with 501+ employees (3 MMUs x 2 shifts per 
day + 89 MMUs x 3 shifts per day). 

In addition, every Part 90 miner is sampled each shift they work.  There are 47 

Part 90 miners currently employed at mines with 20-500 employees and 19 at mines with 
501+ employees.  The number of CPDM filters used per day by underground coal mine 
operators ’ to perform DO and Part 90 miner sampling would be: 

•  93 filters per day for mines with 1-19 employees [1 filter x ((69 MMUs x 1 shift 

per day) + (12 MMUs x 2 shifts per day))]; 

•  1,492 filters per day for mines with 20-500 employees [1 filter x ((45 MMUs x 

1 shift per day) + (589 MMUs x 2 shifts per day) + (74 MMUs x 3 shifts per day) 
+ (47 Part 90 miners x 1 shift per day))]; and, 

•  292 filters per day for mines with 501+ employees [1 filter x ((3 MMUs x 2 shifts 
per day) + (89 MMUs x 3 shifts per day) + (19 Part 90 miners x 1 shift per day))]. 
ODO sampling 

 

125

Each ODO would be sampled on each production shift in each MMU for 14 

consecutive days each quarter.  For mines with 1-19 employees, MSHA estimates that 
there would be 1 ODO on each shift at each MMU.  For mines with 20 or more 
employees, MSHA estimates that there would be 1 ODO at each MMU that operates 
1 shift per day and 2 ODOs per shift at each MMU that operates 2 or 3 shifts per day.  In 
addition, MSHA projects that an additional ODO would be sampled on every fifth shift 
(20 percent of total shifts).  Every ODO sampled would need a new CPDM filter on each 
shift where ODO sampling occurs.  MSHA estimates that the number of CPDM filters 
used per day of ODO sampling by underground coal mine operators would be: 

•  112 filters per day in mines with 1-19 employees [1 filter x ((69 MMUs x 1 shift x 

1 ODO) + (12 MMUs x 2 shifts x 1  ODO)))] + [1 filter x (93 total shifts per day 
on which MMUs operate / 5) x 1 ODO)]; 

•  3,134 filters per day in mines with 20-500 employees [1 filter x ((45 MMUs x 
1 shift 1 ODO) + (589 MMUs x 2 shifts x 2 ODOs) + (74 MMUs x 3 shifts x 
2 ODOs))] + [1 filter x ((1,445 total shifts on which MMUs operate / 5) x 
1 ODO)]; and 

•  601 filters per day in mines with 501+ employees [1 filter x ((3 MMUs x 2 shifts 
x 2 ODOs) + (89 MMUs x 3 shifts x 2 ODOs))] + [1 filter x ((273 shifts on which 
MMUs operate / 5) x 1 ODO)]. 
Sampling While Supplementary Controls are in Use 
A new filter would be needed for each CPDM on every shift where the CPDM is 

used in conjunction with supplementary controls.  For mines using supplementary 
controls on MMUs, MSHA expects that the number of shifts operating per day would be 
2 shifts per day for non-longwall MMUs.  As noted above, 3 additional CPDMs per 
MMU per shift would be needed for MMUs using supplementary controls.  MSHA 
estimates that the number of CPDM filters per day needed by operators using 
supplementary controls would be: 

•  24 filters per day for MMUs in mines with 1-19 employees [1 filter x (4 MMUs x 

2 shifts per day x 3 additional CPDMs)]; and, 

•  150 filters per day for MMUs in mines with 20-500 employees [1 filter x 

(25 non-longwall MMUs x 2 shifts per day x 3 CPDMs)]. 

CPDM Filter Costs 

MSHA estimates that a CPDM filter costs $5.50.  The DO, Part 90 miner 

sampling and sampling in MMUs using supplementary controls would occur on each day 
the mine operates.  MSHA estimates that the number of workdays per year in 
underground coal mines is:  200 workdays in mines with 1-19 employees; 300 workdays 
in mines with 20-500 employees; and 350 workdays in mines with 501+ employees.  
Each ODO would be sampled for 14 consecutive days during each calendar quarter (or 
56 days per year per ODO sampled). 

Since DO and Part 90 Miner sampling with the CPDM would not be required 
until 12 months after the final rule is in effect and would continue annually, the filter 
costs are multiplied by a discount factor of 0.925 based on 7 percent.  Since ODO 
sampling with a CPDM is not required until 18 months after the final rule is in effect and 

 

126

would continue annually, the filter costs are multiplied by a discount factor of 0.859 
based on 7 percent.  MSHA expects that mines that use supplementary controls would do 
so for an average of one year and that these costs would typically occur in the first year 
for the reasons discussed above.  The filter costs for operators that have MMUs using 
supplementary controls were treated as a capital cost and amortized over 5 years by using 
an annualization factor of 0.244 based on a 7 percent discount rate. 

Table V-25 shows that the estimated annual costs for CPDM filters would be 

approximately $3.9 million.  First year costs would be approximately $274,000.   
Annualized first year costs would be approximately $67,000.

Costs for CPDM Annual Maintenance 
 
CPDMS are used, a person certified in sampling or in maintenance and calibration follow 
the examination, testing, and set-up procedures contained in the approved CPDM 

Proposed §§ 70.204(d) and 90.204(d) are new and would require that when 

 

127

Performance Plan.  According to the manufacturer’s recommendations, the following 
monthly maintenance is required:  clean cyclone and inlet tubing; perform a sample line 
leak check; and perform a flow audit procedure. 

For underground mines, MSHA estimates that monthly maintenance by a certified 

person earning $31.77 per hour would take 35 minutes to clean the cyclone and inlet 
tubing; 5 minutes for a sample line leak check; and 5 minutes for a flow audit 
(0.75 hours).  The annual cost to perform monthly maintenance on a CPDM would be 
approximately $286 (12 mos. x 0.75 hrs. x $31.77 hourly wage rate).  A calibration audit 
must be performed on the CPDM once a year at a cost of approximately $32 (1 hr. for 
audit x $31.77 hourly wage rate). 

MSHA expects that items on the CPDM unit that are not covered by the warranty 

may need to be replaced periodically.  The manufacturer lists the following parts of the 
CPDM that are not covered by the warranty:  auxiliary board; modified display; front and 
rear case assembly; PTO cable assembly; digital board; amplifier board; and cyclone 
assembly.  During the warranty period, there is a one time free replacement of the pump 
assembly and battery pack.  If these parts fail the second time, then the operator would be 
responsible for the costs of the replacement parts.  Manufacturer costs for the items noted 
above range from $200 for a front case assembly to $1,300 for the LED cap lamp 
assembly.  MSHA does not expect that each CPDM would need all of these items 
replaced annually.  However, as these devices are deployed in the mining environment 
they would be damaged and replacement parts would be needed.  MSHA projects $1,000 
for annual replacement parts.  MSHA estimates total annual maintenance costs for a 
CPDM would be approximately $1,318 ($286 + $32 + $1,000). 

With respect to ODO sampling with a CPDM, MSHA expects that the $1,318 of 
annual maintenance costs would apply to mines with 20 or more employees, and half of 
that amount ($659) would apply to mines with 1-19 employees.  MSHA expects half of 
the annual maintenance cost for the smallest mine size category because these mines 
would use the CPDM for ODO sampling less than one month per quarter (e.g., to sample 
one ODO for 14 consecutive days on one or two shifts).  This limited use of the CPDM 
would mean that repair and maintenance costs should be lower. 

With respect to sampling with a CPDM at MMUs using supplementary controls, 

MSHA expects that the $1,318 annual maintenance costs noted above would apply 
because CPDMs used in conjunction with supplementary controls would be used every 
production shift each day. 

Since some of the CPDM maintenance costs do not begin until some time in the 
second year, they have been amortized over 5 years using the same methodology used to 
estimate the costs of CPDM filters.  Table V-26 shows that annual maintenance costs for 
CPDMs would be approximately $2.5 million.  First year costs would be approximately 
$229,000 and annualized first year costs would be $56,000.

Maintenance Costs on CPDM Performed Before Shift Begins 

Based on manufacturer’s recommendations, after the CPDM has been used on a 
shift and before it can be used again, the TEOM filter must be replaced; and the grit pot, 
mass transducer area and sample lines must be cleaned.  In addition, the CPDM has to be 
programmed before each shift on which it is used.  MSHA estimates that it would take a 
certified person, earning $31.77 per hour, 15 minutes (0.25 hrs.) to perform the above 
tasks.  The maintenance would be performed before every shift where a CPDM is used. 

Since a new filter must be used each time a CPDM is used, the estimate of the 

number of filters used per day can be used as the estimate of the number of times per day 
that this maintenance would be performed on CPDMs. 

Since some of the costs do not begin until some time in the second year, they have 
been annualized using the same methodology used to estimate the costs of CPDM filters.  
Table V-27 shows that the annual before shift maintenance costs for CPDMs would be 
approximately $5.6 million.  First year costs for before shift maintenance being 
performed on CPDMs would be approximately $396,000 and annualized first year costs 
would be approximately $97,000.

Proposed § 70.208 Sampling of mechanized mining units; requirements when using a 
CPDM 
Costs to Request Use of Supplementary Controls 

  
$5,645,737 $395,537 

 
  
  

  

Proposed § 70.208(h) permits an operator to request MSHA approval to use 

supplementary controls during the 24 month period after the effective date of the final 
rule for a period not to exceed 6 months if the operator is unable to maintain compliance 
with the applicable standard for an MMU and has determined that all feasible engineering 
or environmental controls are being used on the MMU. 

In the request to use supplementary controls, the operator must include a report 
that:  1) evaluates the specific situation in the MMU; 2) outlines all controls that would 
be used during this time period to prevent miners from being exposed to concentrations 
exceeding the applicable standard; 3) addresses the actions that would be taken to lower 
miners’ exposures through the use of engineering and environmental controls; and 

 

130

4) establishes the time line for implementation of the engineering and environmental 
controls. 

MSHA estimates that a supervisor would take 8 hours to write the request to use 
supplementary controls for each MMU and a clerical employee 15 minutes (0.25 hrs.) to 
copy and submit the request.  On average, MSHA estimates that each request would be 
10 pages.  MSHA estimates that copy and postage costs would be $2.50 [(10 pages x 
$0.15) + $1 postage].  The number of MMUs in which supplementary controls are 
expected to be used was determined above.  MSHA expects most of the requests would 
occur during the first year that the rule would take effect and mine operators would make 
an average of 2 requests per MMU (i.e., request to use the supplementary controls for two 
six-month periods).  MSHA estimates that first year costs to underground coal mine 
operators to write initial requests to use supplementary controls would be approximately 
$40,000.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $6,000 for mines with 1-19 employees [4 MMUs x 2 requests x ((8 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $2.50)]; and 
•  $34,000 for mines with 20-500 employees [25 MMUs x 2 request x ((8 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (0.25 hrs. x $26 hourly wage rate) + $2.50)]. 
The first year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying them by an 

annualization factor of 0.142 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized 
cost of approximately $6,000. 
 
Proposed §§ 70.210 and 90.210 Respirable Dust Samples; Transmission by Operator 
Costs to Validate, Certify, and Transmit Electronically CPDM Data to MSHA 
 
Proposed §§ 70.210(f) and 90.210(f) are new and would apply when operators use 
CPDMs to sample.  The proposal would require that, within 12 hours after the end of the 
last sampling shift of the work week, a designated mine official must validate, certify, 
and transmit electronically to MSHA all daily sample and error data file information 
collected during the previous calendar week (Sunday through Saturday) and stored in the 
CPDM.  The proposal would also require the operator to maintain all CPDM data files 
transmitted to MSHA for at least 12 months. 
 
sampling data from the CPDM and transmit it to MSHA was estimated previously.  
MSHA estimates that validating, certifying, and uploading the CPDM data to a computer 
and then transmitting it electronically to MSHA would take a designated mine official, 
earning a supervisor’s wage, 6 minutes (0.1 hours).  The number of CPDMs estimated 
above and can be used to derive costs for this proposed requirement. 

For underground coal mines, the cost of the computer needed to download the 

Since some of the costs do not begin until some time in the second year, they have 

been annualized using the same methodology for deriving CPDM filter costs.  Table 
V-28 shows that annual costs to validate, certify, and transmit electronically CPDM data 
would be approximately $950,500.  First year costs would be approximately $74,000 and 
annualized first year costs would be approximately $18,000.

use a CPDM.  Proposed § 70.211(c) would require the designated mine official to 
validate, certify, and post certain sampling information on a daily and weekly basis.  
Proposed § 90.211(c) would require certain sampling information be provided to Part 90 
miners. 
 
The sampling results must include:  the mine identification number; the locations 
within the mine from which the samples were taken; the concentration of respirable dust 
for each valid sample; the total amount of exposure accumulated by the sampled 
occupation during the shift; the occupation code, where applicable; the reason for voiding 
any sample; the shift length; and any other information required by the District Manager.  
With the exception of the information concerning the shift length and the total amount of 

 

132

Proposed § 70.201(g) is new and would require the operator to make a record 

exposure accumulated by the sampled occupation during the shift, this information is 
included in the available data that can be printed from the CPDM.  MSHA expects that 
the information not included on the printout would be written down on the printout and a 
copy of the printout would be posted to satisfy the requirements of this provision. 
 
showing the length of each production shift for each MMU, retain the records for at least 
six months and make them available for inspection by authorized representatives of the 
Secretary and the miners’ representative and submitted to the district manager when 
requested.  Proposed § 90.201(f) is new and would require the operator to make a record 
showing the length of each shift for each Part 90 miner, retain the records for at least six 
months, and make them available for inspection by authorized representatives of the 
Secretary or submitted to the District Manager when requested in writing. 
 
 MSHA assumes that after recording the shift length on the printout, the operator 
would then record the shift length in a book to comply with proposed §§ 70.201(g) and 
90.201(f).  The costs for the computer and printer needed to download the sampling data 
from the CPDM and print out the dust cards were estimated previously. 

Every time a CPDM is used to sample, a new CPDM filter is needed and a 

printout is generated after the sample is taken.  The number of printouts to be completed 
and posted equals the number of CPDM filters used.  MSHA estimates that a supervisor, 
earning $84.70 an hour, would take 3 minutes (0.05 hours) to complete the functions 
described above.  MSHA also estimates it would cost $0.15 to make a copy of each 
printout.  The number of workdays was determined previously and is used to derive these 
compliance costs. 

Since some of the costs do not begin until some time in the second year, they have 
been annualized using the same methodology for deriving filter costs.  Table V-29 shows 
that annual costs to validate, certify, and post sampling information and provide the 
sampling information to the Part 90 miners would be approximately $3.1 million.  First 
year costs would be approximately $218,000 and annualized first year costs would be 
approximately $53,000.

Proposed §§ 70.212, 71.210, and 90.212 Change in Status Report 

Proposed §§ 70.212(c), 71.210(c), and 90.212(b) are new and would require the 
mine operator to report to MSHA status changes that affect the operational readiness of 
any CPDM unit.  Since the CPDM is a new technology, MSHA has no basis upon which 
to estimate the number of times this would occur.  However, this requirement should 
represent a minimal burden since the reporting can be done electronically and since 
MSHA expects the mines using the CPDM would all have computers (in order to 
download and transmit the CPDM sampling data).  MSHA has assessed one burden hour 
for this provision at a cost of $84.70, the supervisory wage rate for underground mines, 
where the preponderance of the CPDMs would be used.

Proposed § 75.362(a)(2) is revised to require that the person conducting the 

On-Shift Examinations 
Proposed § 75.362 
 
examination to ensure compliance with the respirable dust control parameters specified in 
the mine ventilation plan also record the results of the examination and corrective actions 
taken at the end of each shift for each MMU.  This proposed requirement would only 
impact underground coal mines. 

MSHA estimates that a supervisor, earning $84.70 per hour, would take 3 minutes 
(0.05 hours) to make a record of the examination for the average mine in all mine sizes.  
MSHA estimates that the number of shifts per day are:  93 shifts per day in mines with 
1-19 employees (69 MMUs with 1 shift per day + 12 MMUs with 2 shifts per day); 
1,445 shifts per day in mines with 20-500 employees (45 MMUs with 1 shift per day + 
589 MMUs with 2 shifts per day + 74 MMUs with 3 shifts per day); and 273 shifts per 
day in mines with 501+ employees (3 MMUs with 2 shifts per day + 89 MMUs with 
3 shifts per day).  Records of the examinations would need to be made of these shifts 
each working day. MSHA estimates that, on average, the number of workdays per year 
is:  200 days for mines with 1-19 employees (4 days per week x 50 weeks); 300 days for 
mines with 20 or more employees (6 days per week x 50 weeks); and 350 days for mines 
with 501+ employees (7 days per week x 50 weeks). MSHA estimates that the annual 
cost to record the results from on-shift examinations would be approximately 
$2.3 million.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $78,771 in mines with 1-19 employees (93 shifts per day x 200 days x 0.05 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate); 

•  $1,835,873 in mines with 20-500 employees (1,445 shifts per day x 300 days x 

0.05 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate); and 

•  $404,654 in mines with 501+ employees (273 shifts per day x 350 days x 

0.05 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage rate). 
Proposed § 75.362(g)(2)(i) requires that the proposed § 75.362(a)(2) record be 

certified by initials, date and time on a board maintained at the section load-out or similar 
location showing that the examination was made prior to resuming production. This 
proposed standard does not add any new costs and is already being required under 
existing § 75.362(g)(1) and § 75.362(g)(2). 

Proposed § 75.362(g)(2)(ii) requires that the proposed § 75.362(a)(2) record be 

verified by the certified person directing the on-shift examination, by initials and date for 
compliance with the respirable control parameters specified in the mine ventilation plan. 
Verification shall be made no later than the end of the shift for which the examination 
was made.  Proposed § 75.362(g)(3) requires that the mine foreman or equivalent official 
countersign each examination record under proposed paragraph (a)(2) after they are 
verified by certified person in proposed paragraph (g)(2)(ii). MSHA estimates that it 
would take 1 minute (0.0167 hours) to verify the record by a certified person earning 
$84.70 per hour; and another 1 minute (0.0167 hours) to review and countersign the 
record by a mine foreman or equivalent mine official earning $84.70 per hour. 

 

136

MSHA estimates that the number of records to be verified and countersigned per 
year is: 18,600 records in mines with 1-19 employees (93 shifts per day x 200 days per 
year); 433,500 records in mines with 20-500 employees (1,445 shifts per day x 300 days 
per year); and 95,550 records in mines with 501+ employees (273 shifts per day x 
350 days per year).  MSHA estimates that underground coal mine operators’ annual cost 
to verify and countersign the proposed § 75.362(a)(2) record would be approximately 
$1.6 million. Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground Operators: 
•  $52,619 in mines with 1-19 employees [(18,600 records x 0.0167 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (18,600 records x 0.0167 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 
rate)]; 

•  $1,226,363 in mines with 20-500 employees [(433,500 records x 0.0167 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (433,500 records x 0.0167 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 
rate)]; and 

•  $270,309 in mines with 501+ employees [(95,550 records x 0.0167 hrs. x 

$84.70 hourly wage rate) + (95,550 records x 0.0167 hrs. x $84.70 hourly wage 
rate)]. 
Table V-32 shows that the annualized costs for underground coal mines to record, 

review and countersign the records would be approximately $3.9 million.

Proposed § 75.371 Mine Ventilation Plan: Contents 

Proposed § 75.371(f) and (j) would revise the information that operators would be 

required to provide in mine ventilation plans.  Proposed paragraph (f) would add a new 
requirement to include the minimum quantity of air that would be delivered to the 
working section for each MMU.  Proposed paragraph (j) would be revised to add a new 
requirement that the type and size of dust collector screens used and a description of the 
procedures to be followed in properly maintaining dust collectors used on equipment  be 
included in the ventilation plan.  These requirements would only pertain to underground 
coal mines. 
 
changes to the mine ventilation plan could be made at the time when operators are 
changing their mine ventilation plans due to the installation of engineering controls to 

MSHA has not estimated a separate cost for this proposed provision because these 

 

137

ensure compliance with the rule or, as part of the changes that are made to mine 
ventilation plan when they are reviewed every six months under existing § 75.370(g). 
 

Periodic Examinations Proposed § 72.100 

Proposed § 72.100 (a) and (b) would require each coal mine operator  to provide 

periodic examinations including chest x-ray, spirometry, symptom assessment, and 
occupational history at no cost to each miner at least once every 5 years.  Under proposed 
§ 72.100(c), for miners who begin work at a coal mine for the first time (i.e., the miner 
has not previously worked in any coal mine), operator would provide both the chest x-ray 
and spirometry examinations at no cost to the miner no later than 30 days after beginning 
employment.  If the miner is still employed at the same mine or at a mine owned by the 
same operator, the operator would provide follow-up chest x-ray and spirometry 
examinations no later than 3 years after the initial examinations. 

If the follow-up examinations indicate coal miner's pneumoconiosis or decreased 
lung function, and if the miner is still employed at the same mine or at a mine owned by 
the same operator, then such miners would be provided additional follow-up 
examinations no later than 2 years after the follow-up examinations.  For costing 
purposes, MSHA included the costs of these examinations in the costs developed for the 
examinations of the currently employed miners. 

MSHA estimates that a chest x-ray costs an average of $100 and that a spirometry 

examination costs an average of $35.  Under 42 CFR 37.3, operators already must 
provide underground coal miners the opportunity for chest x-rays at the frequencies noted 
above.  For underground coal mines, the only additional costs due to proposed §§ 72.100 
(a), (b), and (c) would be for the spirometry examination. 

Approximately 20 percent of miners at underground miners take the chest x-rays 
that are currently being offered.  MSHA assumes that the same percentage of miners at 
underground mines would take the spirometry examination and that the same percentage 
of miners at surface mines would take both the chest x-ray and spirometry examinations.  
(This is a conservative estimate.  Since this rate of pneumoconiosis is considerably lower 
for surface miners than for underground miners, it is likely that the percentage of surface 
miners who would choose to take the examinations would be lower.)  Since these 
examinations must be offered once every 5 years, MSHA estimates that on average 4% of 
currently employed miners would take the examinations every year (i.e., 20% taking the 
exam/ 5 years). 

MSHA used turnover rates of 6 percent in underground coal and 3 percent in 
surface coal to estimate the number of new miners who would have to take the initial 
examinations.  MSHA assumed that 20% of this group of miners would take the follow-
up examinations.  Since follow-up examinations would be offered every 3 years, this 
represents an average of 0.4% of miners in underground mines and 0.2% of miners in 
surface mines taking follow-up examinations each year. 

MSHA estimates that each year 10.4 percent of miners in underground coal mines 

(4% representing current miners, 6% representing newly-hired miners and 0.4% 
representing newly-hired miners taking follow-up examinations) would take both 

 

138

examinations each year.  MSHA estimates that each year 7.2 percent of miners in surface 
coal mines (4% representing current miners, 3% representing newly hired miners and 
0.2% representing newly hired miners taking follow-up examinations) would take both 
examinations each year. 

MSHA estimates that 4,888 employed miners (including contractor employees) in 

underground coal mines would take the spirometry examination each year:  230 in 
underground mines with 1-19 employees (2,214 current miners x 0.104); 3,581 in mines 
with 20-500 employees (34,430 current miners x 0.104); and 1,077 miners in mines with 
501+ employees (10,360 current miners x 0.104).  MSHA also estimates that 4,036 
currently employed miners at surface coal mines would take the x-ray and spirometry 
examinations each year:  968 miners at mines with 1-19 employees (13,448 current 
miners x 0.072), 2,698 miners at mines with 20-500 employees (37,478 current miners x 
0.072); and 370 miners at surface mines with 501+ employees (5,141 current miners x 
0.072). 

The estimated annual costs for x-ray and spirometry examinations under proposed 
§§ 72.100 (a), (b) and (c) would be $716,000, of which $171,000 is for underground coal 
and $545,000 is for surface coal.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $8,050 for mines with 1-19 employees (230 miners x $35 for spirometry 

examination); 

•  $125,335 for mines with 20-500 employees (3,581 miners x $35 for spirometry 

examination); and 

•  $37,695 for mines with 501+ employees + 1,077 miners x $35 for spirometry 

examination). 
Surface operators: 
•  $130,680 for mines with 1-19 employees (968 miners x ($100 for chest x-ray 

+$35 for spirometry examination)); 

•  $364,230 for mines with 20-500 employees (2,698 miners x ($100 for chest x-ray 

+$35 for spirometry examination)); and 

•  $49,950 for mines with 501+ employees (370 miners x ($100 for chest x-ray +$35 

for spirometry examination)). 
Proposed § 72.100 (d) would require each coal mine operator to develop and 
submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a roster and plan for providing 
miners with the required x-rays and spirometry examinations.  Proposed § 72.100(e) 
would required to post the approved plan on the mine bulletin board. 

Under 42 CFR 37.4, each operator of an underground coal mine is already 

required to submit to NIOSH a roster and plan for providing miners with the required 
chest x-rays and to post it on the mine bulletin board.   MSHA assumes that, in the first 
year of the proposed rule, underground coal mine operators would simply revise the 
existing roster and plans for chest x-rays to add spirometry testing.  In an underground 
coal mine, MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor, earning $84.70 an hour, ten 
minutes (0.167 hours) to revise the roster and plan and a clerical employee, earning 

 

139

$26.00 an hour, five minutes (0.0833 hours) to copy and submit the revised roster and 
plan.  It would also cost $0.30 to copy two pages. 

Each surface coal mine operator  would have to develop and submit to NIOSH a 
roster and plan for providing both x-ray and spirometry examinations.  In a surface coal 
mine, MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor earning $69.98 per hour, one hour 
to develop the roster and plan and a clerical employee, earning $25.45 an hour, 5 minutes 
(0.083 hours) to copy and submit the roster and plan.  It would also cost $0.30 to copy 2 
pages. 

The estimated first year costs under proposed §§ 72.100 (d) and (e) would be 

$88,300, of which $7,000 is for underground coal and $81,300 is for surface coal.  Costs 
for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $1,345 for mines with 1-19 employees [81 revised plans x (($84.70 hourly wage x 

0.167 hrs.) + ($26 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $0.30 for copying)]; 

•  $5,498 for mines with 20-500 employees [331 revised plans x (($84.70 hourly 

wage x 0.167 hrs.) + ($26 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $0.30 for copying)]; and 
•  $199 for mines with 501+ employees [12 revised plans x (($84.70 hourly wage x 

0.167 hrs.) + ($26 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) for labor + $0.30 for copying)]. 

Surface operators: 
•  $44,888 for mines with 1-19 employees [620 plans x (($69.98 hourly wage x 

1 hr.) + ($25.45 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $0.30 for copying)]; 

•  $35,548 for mines with 20-500 employees [491 plans x (($69.98 hourly wage x 

1 hr.) + ($25.45 hourly wage x 0.0833 hr.) + $0.30 for copying)]; and 

•  $869 for mines with 501+ employees [12 plans x (($69.98 hourly wage x 1 hr.) + 

($25.45 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $0.30 for copying)]. 
First year costs were amortized over 10 years by multiplying them by an 
annualization factor of 0.142 based on 7 percent to arrive at an annualized cost of 
$12,500, of which $1,000 is for underground coal mines and $11,500 is for surface coal 
mines. 

Since the x-ray and spirometry examinations must be provided at least once every 
5 years, MSHA assumes that each year one fifth of the mines would have to revise a plan 
to specify the 6 month period and the NIOSH approval facility for the examinations.  
MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor, earning $84.70 an hour in an 
underground coal mine or $69.98 an hour in a surface coal mine, ten minutes (0.167 
hours) to revise the plan and a clerical employee, earning $26.00 an hour in an 
underground coal mine or $25.45 an hour in a surface coal mine, five minutes (0.0833 
hours) to copy and submit the revised plan and that it would cost $0.30 to copy each plan.  
The estimated annual costs would be $4,600, of which $1,400 is for underground coal 
and $3,200 is for surface coal mines.  Costs for each mine size are shown below: 

Underground operators: 
•  $266 for mines with 1-19 employees [16 mines x (($84.70 hourly wage x 

0.167 hrs.) + ($26 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $.30 for copying)]; 

 

140

•  $1,096 for mines with 20-500 employees [66 mines x (($84.70 hourly wage x 

0.167 hrs.) + ($26 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $.30 for copying)]; and 
•  $33 for mines with 501+ employees [2 mines x (($84.70 hourly wage x 

0.167 hrs.) + ($26 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $.30 for copying)]. 

Surface operators: 
•  $1,749 for mines with 1-19 employees [124 mines x (($69.98 hourly wage x 

0.167 hrs.) + ($25.45 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $.30 for copying)]; 

•  $1,383 for mines with 20-500 employees [98 mines x (($69.98 hourly wage x 

0.167 hrs.) + ($25.45 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $.30 for copying)]; and 

•  $28 for mines with 501+ employees [2 mines x (($69.98 hourly wage x 
0.167 hrs.) + ($25.45 hourly wage x 0.0833 hrs.) + $.30 for copying)]. 

 

Table V-33 shows, by mine size, that for proposed § 72.100 first year costs 
related to X-ray and spirometry examinations would be approximately $179,500 for 
underground coal mine operators  and $629,500 for surface coal mine operators.

Proposed § 72.700 Equipment; Respirable Dust 

Proposed § 72.700(a) would require operators to maintain an adequate supply of 

respiratory equipment.  The proposal would expand the existing standard's scope of 
coverage to include miners at surface mines and Part 90 miners. 

The requirement under existing § 70.300 requires underground mine operators to 

maintain a supply of respiratory equipment adequate to deal with occurrences of 
concentrations of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere in excess of the applicable 
standard.  Therefore, there are no additional costs for underground mine operators. 

MSHA expects that surface coal mine operators already have an adequate supply 
of respirators and would not need to purchase additional ones as a result of the proposed 
rule.  Some operators of surface coal mines also operate underground coal mines where 
there is a history of respirator use.  These operators routinely provide respirators at both 
their underground and surface coal mines.  In addition, surface coal mine operators 
consider it a good work practice to provide respirators to miners when necessary.  Having 
respirators on hand to provide to miners is viewed by operators as part of a 
comprehensive plan that increases the protection of miner against job-related health 
hazards while at the same time minimizing operator workers’ compensation cost 
premiums from health insurance providers.  Therefore, MSHA assumes that there are also 
no additional costs for surface mine operators to purchase respirators. 

Proposed § 72.700 (b) would require coal mine operators  to provide training on 

the care, fit, use and limitations of each type of respirator to miners who would have 
respirators made available to them under proposed § 72.700 (a) unless the miner received 
training on the types of available respirators within the previous 12 months.  MSHA has 
determined that three groups of miners would be offered respiratory protection - miners 
in MMUs, miners in outby DAs and miners in DWPs on the surface. 

MSHA estimates that training would take fifteen minutes (0.25 hours) and be 

given by a supervisor, earning $84.70 an hour in an underground coal mine or $69.98 an 
hour in a surface mine.  The average miner wage is $35.30 in underground coal and 
$31.84 in surface coal mines.

For miners in MMUs and Part 90 miners, proposed §§ 70.207(g)(1), 70.208(f)(1), 

90.208(e)(1), and 90.209(e)(1) would require that respiratory protection be made 
available whenever a single-shift equivalent concentration measurement meets or exceeds 
the applicable ECV, or a weekly accumulated exposure exceeds the weekly permissible 
accumulated exposure.  Proposed §§ 70.207(i)(1), 70.208(g)(1), 90.208(g)(1), and 
90.209(f)(1) would require that respiratory protection be made available whenever a 
single-shift equivalent concentration measurement exceeds the applicable standard and is 
below the applicable ECV.  Based upon the estimates of the citations present above and 
the assumption that an additional 5 percent of samples would exceed the applicable 
standards and be below the applicable ECVs, most mines would have at least one sample 
exceeding the applicable standard each year. 

In order to reduce the possibility of disrupting production because a trainer was 
not available to provide the required respiratory protection training, MSHA expects that 
underground mine operators would provide respiratory protection training each year 
during regularly scheduled training sessions rather than wait to train the miners until after 
a sample exceeded the applicable standard.  MSHA assumes that the training would be 
conducted in groups so that all miners at the same MMU on the same shift receive 
training at the same time including the Part 90 miners and miners working in the outby 
DAs.  In the calculations below, the number of training sessions equals the number of 
shifts estimated earlier.  There are typically 6 miners working at each MMU per shift.  
MSHA multiplied the number of shifts by 6.1, rather than 6, to account for underground 
coal miners who are not working on MMUs but still would require the training.  
Therefore, MSHA estimates that the number of underground coal miners to train are:  
567 trainees in mines with 1-19 employees (93 sessions x 6.1 trainees per session); 
8,815 trainees in mines with 20-500 employees (1,445 sessions x 6.1 trainees per session) 
and; 1,665 trainees in mines with 501+ employees (273 sessions x 6.1 trainees).  

Respiratory protection would be required to be made available in a DA under 
proposed § 70.209(e)(1) when a citation is issued, and under proposed § 70.209(g)(1) 
when the equivalent concentration measurement exceeds the applicable standard but is 
less than the applicable ECV, thereby triggering the requirements of proposed 
§ 72.700(b).  To simplify the calculations, MSHA added 0.1 to the number of miners at 
each MMU in order to account for miners in outby DAs and Part 90 miners who require 
training.  (The number of miners at the outby DAs averages slightly more than one while 
the estimated number of violations projected at the outby DAs is less than one-tenth the 
number of MMUs.  There are fewer than 50 Part 90 mines.) 

Proposed § 71.207(k)(1) would require that respiratory protection be made 

available whenever a citation is issued for exceeding the applicable standard, thereby 
triggering the requirements of proposed § 72.700 (b).  For surface mines, the number of 
miners needing training due to a violation of the standard would equal the estimated 
number of violations projected for the DWPs.  MSHA increased this estimate by 5 
percent to account for the times when the result of a sample exceeded the standard but did 
not exceed the ECV.   The number of miners to be trained in surface coal mines would 
vary according to the estimated number of violations, which would be different in the 
first year, second year, and third year, before reaching a steady level in the fourth year.  
MSHA estimated the cost of respirator training in each year over a 10-year period.

The estimated annualized costs for respirator training under proposed § 72.700 (b) 

would be $137,000.  This figure consists of an annual cost of $136,000 for underground 
coal and an annualized cost of $907 for surface coal.  In surface coal, the total costs for 
respirator training under proposed § 72.700 (b) would be $2,000 in the first year, $1,600 
in the second year, and $1,000 in the third year and $440 in the fourth year and each year 
thereafter. 

Annual Costs for Underground Operators: 
•  $6,973 for mines with 1-19 employees [(567 trainees x $35.30 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + (93 sessions x $84.70 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. of 
instructor time)]; 

•  $108,390 for mines with 20-500 employees [(8,815 trainees x $35.30 hourly wage 

rate x 0.25 hrs. for training) + (1,445 sessions x $84.70 hourly wage rate x 
0.25 hrs. of instructor time)]; and 

•  $20,474 for mines with 501+ employees [(1,665 trainees x $35.30 hourly wage 

rate x 0.25 hrs. for training) + (273 sessions x $84.70 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. 
of instructor time)]. 

 
Costs for Surface Operators 

First Year: 

•  $1,018 for mines with 1-19 employees [40 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; 

•  $866 for mines with 20-500 employees [34 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; and 

•  $153 for mines with 501+ employees [6 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]. 

 

Second year: 

•  $815 for mines with 1-19 employees [32 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; 

•  $662 for mines with 20-500 employees [26 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; and 

•  $102 for mines with 501+ employees [4 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]. 

 

Third year: 

 

144

•  $484 for mines with 1-19 employees [19 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; 

•  $407 for mines with 20-500 employees [16 trainees x (($31.84  hourly wage rate 

x 0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98  hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; and 

•  $76 for mines with 501+ employees [3 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]. 

 

Each year thereafter: 

•  $229 for mines with 1-19 employees [9 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; 

•  $178 for mines with 20-500 employees [7 trainees x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 

0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]; and 

•  $26 for mines with 501+ employees [1 trainee x (($31.84 hourly wage rate x 
0.25 hrs. for training) + ($69.98 hourly wage rate x 0.25 hrs. for instructors' 
time))]. 

 

MSHA discounted the stream of training costs over 10 years based on a 7% 

discount rate to arrive at an estimated net present value of $6,385.  MSHA then amortized 
these costs over 10 years by multiplying by an annualization factor of 0.142 based on a 
7 percent discount rate to arrive at an annualized cost of $907. 

Proposed § 72.700 (c) would require coal mine operators to keep a record of 

respirator training for two years after completion of the respirator training.  This record 
may be kept elsewhere if the record is immediately available at the mine site by 
electronic transmission. 

MSHA estimates that it would take a clerical employee, earning $26.00 an hour in 

an underground coal mine or $25.45 an hour in a surface mine, thirty seconds (0.00833 
hours) per trainee to make a record of respirator training.  The estimated annualized costs 
for recordkeeping under proposed § 72.700(c) would be $2,462.  This figure consists of 
an annual cost of $2,393 for underground coal and an annualized cost of $8 for surface 
coal.  In surface coal, the total costs for recordkeeping under proposed § 72.700 (c) would 
be $28 in the first year, $48 in the second year, and $73 in the third year and in each year 
thereafter.  Costs for each mine size are shown below:

Each year thereafter: 

•  $2 for mines with 1-19 employees (9 trainees x $25.45 hourly wage rate x 

0.00833 hrs. for clerical labor); 

•  $2 for mines with 20-500 employees (7 trainees x $25.45 hourly wage rate x 

0.00833 hrs. for clerical labor); and, 

•  $1 for mines with 501+ employees (1 trainees x $25.45 hourly wage rate x 

0.00833 hrs. for clerical labor). 
MSHA discounted the stream of training costs over 10 years using a 7% annual 

rate to arrive at an estimated net present value of $ 55.  MSHA then amortized these costs 

 

146

over 10 years by multiplying by an annualization factor of 0.142 based on 7 percent to 
arrive at an annualized cost of $8. 
 
 
and recordkeeping would be approximately $138,000 for underground coal mine 
operators and $6,000 for surface coal mine operators.

Expansion of Part 90 Option to Surface Mines  
CPDM Costs for Surface Mines 

 

Proposed Part 71 does not have a requirement for surface mine operators to use 

the CPDM.  Therefore, monitoring coal miners working at surface mines with the CPDM 
would be voluntary.  Since monitoring with the CPDM is more expensive than 

 

147

monitoring with the gravimetric sampler, MSHA does not expect surface mine operators 
to use CPDMs to sample unless they have Part 90 miners who are required to use the 
CPDM. 
Proposed § 90.1 Scope 

Proposed § 90.1 would expand the scope of the Part 90 option to include miners 

employed at surface coal mines.  The current scope is limited to miners employed at 
underground coal mines or at surface areas of underground coal mines. 

Under the proposed rule, miners who exercise their Part 90 option must be 

transferred to an area of a mine where the average concentration of respirable dust in the 
mine atmosphere during each shift to which that miner is exposed is continuously 
maintained at or below 0.5 mg/m3.  Based upon the historical monitoring data collected 
from surface mines presented previously in the technological feasibility analysis, MSHA 
has determined that there are numerous areas at surface mines that meet this standard.  
Therefore, the costs associated with transferring the miners who exercise the Part 90 
option should be de minimis. 

However, proposed § 90.201 would require that operators sample the 

concentration of respirable coal mine dust in the working environment of each Part 90 
miner.  For 12 months after the effective date of the rule, the sampling can be done with 
the gravimetric sampler.  Beginning in the second year, the sampling must be done with 
the CPDM. 

Most of the costs of using the gravimetric sampler (training the certified persons, 

purchasing the samplers, etc.) have already been estimated above.  The only additional 
costs for using the gravimetric sampler to monitor Part 90 miners would result from 
proposed § 90.208(a) which would require that 5 samples be taken each quarter. 

The costs of using the CPDM to monitor Part 90 miners working on the surface 

were not previously estimated.  These costs are estimated below. 
 
Miners Who Would Exercise their Part 90 Option 

Since MSHA has no experience with offering the Part 90 option to miners at 
surface coal mines, there are no historical data upon which to estimate the number of 
miners at surface coal mines who would exercise their Part 90 option. 

According to historical data from NIOSH’s miner x-ray programs (e.g., Miners’ 
Choice and the Coal Workers' X-ray Surveillance Program), 1,264 of the 32,250 surface 
miners examined (about 3.9 percent) showed evidence of pneumoconiosis.  MSHA does 
not expect all of these miners to exercise their Part 90 option.  Currently there are only 
66 Part 90 miners.  The NIOSH data indicate that 19,148 of the 224,131 miners at 
underground mines examined (about 8.5 percent) showed evidence of pneumoconiosis.  
Based upon this percentage, approximately 3,427 miners (8.5% of 40,319 underground 
miners) are eligible for the Part 90 option.  So, most miners who qualify do not exercise 
their option.  However, to account for the likelihood that surface miners would exercise 
their Part 90 option at greater rates than underground miners are currently doing (e.g., 
underground miners exercised their Part 90 option at greater rates when the Part 90 

 

148

option was first made available), MSHA assumes that 200 surface miners (three times the 
number of underground miners) would exercise their Part 90 option. 
 
Costs of Expanding the Scope of Part 90 Program to Cover Surface Miners 

In order to exercise their Part 90 option, miners must have evidence of the 

development of pneumoconiosis.  Under proposed § 72.100, mine operators must provide 
miners with the option to be tested once every five years.  Since surface operators are not 
currently required to provide this testing, MSHA assumes that no new miners would 
exercise their option for at least the first year, while the NIOSH medical surveillance 
plans are developed, the miners are tested, the results are reviewed, etc.  Therefore, 
MSHA has not estimated any costs for Part 90 miners in the first year related to the use of 
the gravimetric sampler, which is phased out 12 months after the effective date of the 
final rule.  MSHA also assumes that 200 surface miners would exercise their Part 90 
option in the second year and that the costs related to the use of the CPDM would start at 
the beginning of the second year.  Finally, MSHA assumed that no surface miner who 
begins work at a coal mine for the first time would suffer from pneumoconiosis, a 
necessary condition to exercise the Part 90 option.  MSHA believes that the estimate of 
200 surface miners exercising their Part 90 option probably overstates the costs because 
many surface operators may not offer to provide testing for their existing workforce until 
the fourth year after the effective date of the final rule. 
 

Costs to Certify Persons to Perform Sampling and Maintenance and Calibration 
(M&C) 
Proposed § 90.202(b) would retain the existing requirement that candidates for 
certification pass an MSHA examination to demonstrate competency in respirable dust 
sampling procedures. To ensure consistent administration of the certification process, 
however, the proposal would add a new requirement that candidates complete an MSHA 
course of instruction prior to certification.  Proposed § 90.203(b) requires that persons 
complete an MSHA course of instruction and pass an MSHA examination to become 
certified to maintain and calibrate approved sampling devices.  Like the certification to 
perform sampling, MSHA would provide both courses at no charge; however, persons 
becoming certified for both sampling and maintenance and calibration would travel to 
either an MSHA district or field office to take the courses. 

MSHA assumed that surface mines would only certify persons to perform 
sampling using the gravimetric sampler if they had Part 90 miners.  Based on the 
worst-case assumption that all 200 Part 90 miners were employed at different mines, 
MSHA estimates that 200 persons would have to be certified on the CPDM.   MSHA 
assumes that these 200 persons would become certified to both sample with and maintain 
the CPDM. 

MSHA estimates that it would take a person 9 hours for the CPDM course and 

examination on sampling (7 hours for the course, 1 hour for the examination and 1 hour 
to travel to and from the course site) and 9 hours for the CPDM course and examination 
on maintenance and calibration (7 hours for the course, 1 hour for the examination and 
1 hour to travel to and from the course site).  MSHA also expects that each person would 

 

149

require $100 in travel expenses.  Therefore, the estimated costs to certify each person 
would be $615.88 ($28.66 per hour x 18 hours + $100).  MSHA applied a discounted 
factor of 0.934 based on 7 percent to the second-year costs to bring them forward one 
year.  MSHA estimates the cost to certify 200 persons would be $115,046:  $17,255 in 
mines with 1-19 employees (30 persons x $615.88 per certification x 0.934); $85,191 in 
mines with 20-500 employees (148 persons x $615.88 per certification x 0.934); and 
$12,600 in mines with 501+ employees (22 persons x $615.88 per certification x 0.934).  
The first year costs were then amortized over 10 years by applying an annualization 
factor of 0.142 based on 7 percent to arrive at annualized cost of approximately $16,336. 
 

Turnover Costs Related to Certifying Persons 
Based upon a turnover rate of 3 percent, MSHA estimates that an additional 
6 persons (200 x 0.03) would have to be certified each year.  This would result in an 
estimated annual cost of $3,695; $616 in mines with 1-19 employees (1 person x $615.88 
per certification), $2,464 in mines with 20-500 employees (4 persons x $615.88 per 
certification), and $616 in mines with 501+ employees (1 person x $615.88 per 
certification). 
 

Costs for Persons to Take Examinations to Maintain the Certifications 
Proposed §§ 90.202(c) and 90.203(c) would require certified persons to pass the 
MSHA examinations demonstrating competency in sampling procedures or maintenance 
and calibration procedures every three years to maintain their certifications.  Persons that 
fail the examination must retake the course and pass the examination to become 
recertified. 

As was done previously, MSHA made the simplifying assumption that one-third 

of the certified persons would take the re-certification examination each year.  MSHA 
estimates that 66 persons (200 x 0.33) would have to take the examination each year.  
MSHA adjusted this by 10% to account for some persons failing an examination and 
having to retake it.  Therefore, MSHA estimates that 73 persons would take the 
examination each year (66 x 1.1). 

MSHA estimates that it would take 1 hour for the CPDM examination on 

sampling, 1 hour for CPDM examination on maintenance and calibration, and 1 hour to 
travel to and from the site where the examination is given.  MSHA assumes that travel 
costs would be $50.  Therefore, the estimated cost of the examinations is $136 (3 hours x 
$28.66 per hour + $50).  This would result in estimated annual costs of $9,928:  $1,496 in 
mines with 1-19 employees (11 persons x $136 per certification); $7,344 in mines with 
20-500 employees (54 persons x $136 per certification); and $1,088 in mines with 501+ 
employees (8 persons x $136 per certification). 
 

Revoking a Person's Certification 
Proposed § 90.202(d) and 90.203(d) would provide that MSHA may revoke a 
person's certification for failing to pass the MSHA examination or failing to properly 

 

150

carry out required sampling or maintenance and calibration procedures, as appropriate.  
MSHA included the additional persons needing retraining in the estimates presented 
above.  The persons who fail a certification examination were included in the failure rates 
used for the re-certification estimates, and substitute persons requiring certifications were 
included in the turnover rates used for the new certification estimates.  Therefore, no 
additional costs were estimated for this provision. 
 

Costs to Develop and Submit CPDM Plans to MSHA for Approval 
  Proposed § 71.206(a) would require operators to develop and submit CPDM 

Performance Plans (Plan) to MSHA for approval prior to using CPDMs.  However, 
MSHA assumes that no CPDM plans would be developed by surface coal mines unless 
they have Part 90 miners.  Proposed § 90.206(b) would require operators who use 
CPDMs to develop and submit for approval a Plan prior to using them.  The proposal 
specifies the information that would be required to be contained in the Plan and would 
establish Plan approval procedures.  Each of the estimated 200 surface mines with Part 90 
miners would need a Plan.  MSHA increased this estimate by 10 percent to account for 
some plans having to be resubmitted for MSHA approval. 

MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor 4 hours to develop a proposed 

Plan and a clerical employee 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and submit it for approval.  
MSHA estimate that copy and postage costs are $1.60 [(4 pgs. x $0.15) + $1 postage].  
The average cost of developing and submitting a plan is $287.88 (4 x $69.98 + .25 x 
$25.45 + $1.60).    MSHA applied a discounted factor of 0.934 based on 7 percent to the 
second-year costs bring them forward one year.  This would result in estimated costs of 
$59,154:  $8,872 in mines with 1-19 employees (33 mines x $287.88 per plan x 0.934); 
$43,804 in mines with 20-500 employees (163 mines x $287.88 per plan x 0.934); and 
$6,478 in mines with 501+ employees (24 mines x $287.88 per plan x 0.934). 

The first year costs were then amortized over a 10 year life by applying an 

annualization factor of 0.142 based on 7 percent to arrive at annualized cost of 
approximately $8,400. 
 

Costs of CPDM Training for Miners Expected to Use a CPDM 
Proposed § 90.201(h) would require that CPDM training be provided to all 

Part 90 miners.  The training shall be completed prior to a miner being required to wear a 
CPDM and repeated every 12 months thereafter.  The training would include: 
1) explaining the basic features and capabilities of the CPDM; 2) how to setup the CPDM 
for compliance sampling; 3) a discussion of the various types of information displayed by 
the CPDM and how to access that information; 4) how to start and stop a short-term 
sample run during compliance sampling; and 5) the importance of continuously 
monitoring dust concentrations and properly wearing the CPDM. 
 
CPDM, earning $28.66 per hour approximately 30 minutes (0.5 hours) to train each 
Part 90 miner, earning $ 31.84 per hour, on the CPDM.  The cost of training each Part 90 
miner would be $30.35 ($28.66 per hour x 0.5 hours + $31.84 per hour x 0.5 hours).  

MSHA estimates that it would take the person certified in sampling with a 

 

151

MSHA estimates the cost of training the 200 Part 90 miners at surface mines and 
facilities to be $6,050 per year:  $907 for mines with 1-19 employees (30 miners x $30.35 
per training session); $4,477 in mines with 20-500 employees (148 miners x $30.35 per 
training session); and $666 in mines with 501+ employees (22 miners x $30.35 per 
training session). 
 
  

Costs of Records for CPDM Training 
Proposed § 90.201(i) would require coal mine operators keep a record of miners 

who receive CPDM training.  MSHA estimates that it would take a clerical employee 
0.00833 hours (30 seconds) to make a record of each Part 90 miner who received CPDM 
training.  The annual costs to make records for the 200 Part 90 miners receiving CPDM 
training would be approximately $42:  $6 in mines with 1-19 employees (30 miners x 
0.00833 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate); $31 in mines with 20-500 employees 
(148 miners x 0.00833 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate); and $5 in mines with 501+ 
employees (22 miners x 0.00833 hrs. x $25.45 hourly wage rate). 
 

Costs to Provide Copies of Approved CPDM Plans to Part 90 Miners 
  Proposed § 90.206(d) would require that the Part 90 miners be given a copy of 

the approved CPDM plan and revisions.  MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would 
take 5 minutes (0.083 hours) to copy and provide the plan to a Part 90 miner.  Copy costs 
are the same as determined above, $1.60.  The cost of providing the Part 90 miner with a 
copy of a plan is $7.96 (.25 x $25.45 + $1.60).  MSHA applied a discounted factor of 
0.934 based on 7 percent to the second-year costs bring them forward one year.  This 
would result in estimated costs of $1,486:  $223 in mines with 1-19 employees (30 plans 
x $7.96 per plan x 0.934); $1,100 in mines with 20-500 employees (148 mines x $7.96 
per plan x 0.934): and $163 in mines with 501+ employees (22 plans x $7.96 per plan x 
0.934).  The first year costs were then amortized over a 10-year life by applying an 
annualization factor of 0.142 based on 7 percent to arrive at annualized cost of 
approximately $211. 
 

Contents of CPDM Plan 
Proposed § 90.206(c) specifies the information that would be required in CPDM 

 
Performance Plans.  There are no additional costs associated with this requirement 
because the costs of addressing this requirement were already determined above when 
deriving the cost to develop and submit CPDM plans to MSHA for approval. 

 
Costs of Revising Approved CPDM Plans 

Costs to Revise and Submit Revisions to Approved CPDM Plans 
MSHA anticipates that revisions to approved CPDM plans would occur from 

situations that develop as a result of proposed §§ 90.206(b), 90.209(e)(4), and 
90.209(f)(4).  MSHA estimates that 25 percent of surface mines with Part 90 miners 
would make revisions to approved CPDM plans each year.  MSHA estimates that a 
supervisor would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to revise an approved plan and a clerical 

 

152

employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and submit the revision.  Copy and 
postage costs per revision would be $1.30 [(2 pgs. x $0.15) + $1 postage].  The average 
cost of revising a plan is $25.16 (.25 x $69.98 + .25 x $25.45 + $1.30).  Since these costs 
would begin in the second year, MSHA applied a discount factor of 0.925 based on 
7 percent to discount this stream of costs by one year.  This would result in estimated 
costs of $1,164:  $175 in mines with 1-19 employees (7.5 plans x $25.16 per plan x 
0.925); $861 in mines with 20-500 employees (37 plans x $25.16 per plan x 0.925); and 
$128 in mines with 501+ employees (5.5 plans x $25.16 per plan x 0.925). 
 

Cost to Provide the Part 90 Miners with a Copy of the Revised CPDM Plans 
Proposed § 90.206(d) would require operators to provide the Part 90 miners with 
a copy of the plan and revisions.  On average, MSHA estimates that a clerical employee 
would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and provide the revised plan to the Part 90 
miners.  Copy costs per revision would be $0.30 (2 pgs. x $0.15).  There are no postage 
costs as the Part 90 miners are expected to be at the mine.  The average cost of providing 
a plan is $6.66 (.25 x $25.45 + $0.30).  Since these costs would begin in the second year, 
MSHA applied a  factor of 0.925 based on 7 percent to discount this stream of costs by 
one year.  This would result in estimated costs of $307:  $46 in mines with 1-19 
employees (7 plans x $6.66 per plan x 0.925); $228 in mines with 20-500 employees (37 
plans x $6.66 per plan x 0.925); and $33 in mines with 501+ employees (5 plans x $6.66 
per plan 0.925). 
 
Costs Incurred When Using a CPDM to Sample 

Costs to Purchase Equipment When Using a CPDM to Sample 
Proposed § 90.201(a) would require that beginning 12 months after the effective 

date of the rule Part 90 miners be sampled with a CPDM.  Operators would have to 
purchase the CPDM units as well as related equipment to transmit to MSHA on a weekly 
basis all daily sample and error data file information (proposed § 90.210(f)).  The 
estimated 200 surface mines using the CPDM to sample Part 90 miners would need to 
purchase a computer and printer (including ink and paper) to handle the information 
generated by the CPDM at an estimated $1,000 per mine.  These mines would also have 
to purchase a flow meter at an estimated cost of $1,700.  MSHA estimates a 5 year 
service life for the computer, printer and flow meter.  Since these costs would begin in 
the second year, MSHA applied a discount factor of 0.934 based on 7 percent to calculate 
the present value (first year costs) of purchasing the equipment in the second year.  This 
would result in estimated costs of $504,360:  $75,654 in mines with 1-19 employees (30 
mines x $2,700 per mine x 0.934); $373,226 in mines with 20-500 employees (148 mines 
x $2,700 per mine x 0.934); and $55,480 in mines with 501+ employees (24 mines x 
$2,700 per mine).  The first year costs were then amortized over a 5-year life by applying 
an annualization factor of 0.244 based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized 
costs of $123,064. 
 

Cost to Purchase CPDMs (including Warranty) 

 

153

Proposed § 90.209(a)(1) would require operators to use a CPDM to sample the 

work environment of each Part 90 miner each shift beginning 12 months after the 
effective date of the standard.  MSHA estimates an average cost of $10,000 per CPDM.  
MSHA expects that a 5-year warranty would be purchased at a cost of $2,875 with each 
CPDM sold and that the service life of a CPDM would be 5 years.  In addition, MSHA 
increased the cost estimate by 10% in order to account for the cost of spares or leased 
units needed for the occasions when the CPDMs are not operating.  Since these costs 
would begin in the second year, MSHA applied a discount factor of 0.934 based on 
7 percent to calculate the present value (first year costs) of purchasing the CPDMs in the 
second year.  This would result in estimated costs of $2,645,555:  $369,833 in mines with 
1-19 employees (30 miners x $14,163 per miner x 0.934); $1,957,711 in mines with 
20-500 employees (148 miners x $14,163 per miner x 0.934); and $291,011 in mines 
with 501+ employees (22 miners x $14,163 per miner x 0.934).  The first year costs were 
then amortized over a 5 -year service life by applying an annualization factor of 0.244 
based on a 7 percent discount rate to arrive at annualized costs $645,516. 
 

Cost for CPDM Filters 
A new CPDM filter is needed for each CPDM used on every shift sampled.  

MSHA assumes that each Part 90 miner would require 250 filters per year (5 days per 
week x 50 weeks).  Since these costs would begin in the second year, MSHA applied a 
factor of 0.925 to discount this stream of costs by one year.  This would result in 
estimated costs of $254,375:  $38,156 in mines with 1-19 employees (30 miners x $5.50 
per filter x 250 filters per miner x 0.925); $188,238 in mines with 20-500 employees 
(148 miners x $5.50 per filter x 250 filters per miner x 0.925); and $27,981 in mines with 
501+ employees (24 miners x $5.50 per filter x 250 filters per miner x 0.925).  
 

Costs for CPDM Annual Maintenance 
Proposed § 90.204(d) would require that when CPDMs are used, a person 

 
certified in sampling or in maintenance and calibration follow the examination, testing, 
and set-up procedures contained in the approved CPDM Performance Plan.  According to 
the manufacturer’s recommendations, the following maintenance must be performed on a 
CPDM each month:  clean cyclone and inlet tubing; perform a sample line leak check; 
and perform a flow audit procedure. 

MSHA estimates that monthly maintenance by a certified person earning $28.66 
per hour would take 35 minutes to clean cyclone and inlet tubing; 5 minutes for sample 
line leak check; and 5 minutes for a flow audit (0.75 hours).  The annual cost to perform 
monthly maintenance on a CPDM would be approximately $258 (12 mos. x 0.75 hrs. x 
$28.66 hourly wage rate).  Also, a calibration audit must be performed on the CPDM 
once a year at a cost of approximately $29 (1 hr. for audit x $28.66 hourly wage rate). 

There is also periodic maintenance for items on the CPDM unit that are not 

covered by the warranty and they may need to be replaced periodically. The manufacturer 
lists the following parts of the CPDM that are not covered by the warranty:  auxiliary 
board; modified display; front and rear case assembly; PTO cable assembly; digital 
board; amplifier board; and cyclone assembly.  During the warranty period, there is a 

 

154

one-time free replacement of the pump assembly and battery pack.  If these parts fail a 
second time, then the operator would absorb the costs of replacing these parts.  
Manufacturer costs for the items noted above range from $200 for a front case assembly 
to $1,300 for the LED cap lamp assembly.  MSHA does not expect that each CPDM 
would need all of these items replaced annually.  However, as these devices are deployed 
in the mining environment they would be damaged and replacement parts would be 
needed.  MSHA projects $1,000 for annual replacement parts.  MSHA estimates total 
annual maintenance costs for a CPDM would be approximately $1,287 ($258 + $29 + 
$1,000).    Since these costs would begin in the second year, MSHA applied a factor of 
0.925 based on a 7 percent discount rate to discount this stream of costs by one year.   
This would result in estimated costs of $238,084:  $35,712 in mines with 1-19 

employees (30 miners x $1,287 per miner x 0.925); $176,182 in mines with 20-500 
employees (148 miners x $1,287 per miner x 0.925); and $26,190 in mines with 501+ 
employees (24 miners x $1,287 per miner x 0.925). 
 

Maintenance Cost on CPDM Performed Before Shift Begins 
Based on manufacturer’s recommendations, after the CPDM has been used on a 
shift and before it can be used again, the TEOM filter must be replaced and the grit pot, 
mass transducer area and sample lines must be cleaned.  In addition, the CPDM has to be 
programmed before each shift on which it is used.  MSHA estimates that it would take a 
certified person earning $28.66 per hour 15 minutes (0.25 hrs.) to perform the above 
tasks before every shift that a CPDM is used, which results in an estimated cost of $7.17 
per use.  Since these costs would begin in the second year, MSHA applied a factor of 
0.925 based on 7 percent to discount this stream of costs by one year. 

This before shift maintenance would result in estimated annual costs of $331,382:  

$49,708 in mines with 1-19 employees (30 miners x $7.17 per day x 250 days x 0.925); 
$245,222 in mines with 20-500 employees (148 miners x $7.17 per day x 250 days x 
0.925); and $36,452 in mines with 501+ employees (22 miners x $7.17 per day x 250 
days x 0.925).  
 

Cost to Validate, Certify, and Transmit Electronically CPDM Data to MSHA 
Proposed § 90.210(f)  would require that, within 12 hours after the end of the last 

 
sampling shift of the work week, a designated mine official must validate, certify, and 
transmit electronically to MSHA all daily sample and error data file information collected 
during the previous calendar week and stored in the CPDM.  The proposal would also 
require the operator to maintain all CPDM data files transmitted to MSHA for at least 12 
months. 
 
CPDM to a computer and then transmitting it electronically to MSHA would take, a 
designated mine official earning a supervisory wage of $69.98, 6 minutes (0.1 hours) per 
week.  Since these costs would begin in the second year, MSHA applied a factor of 0.925 
based on 7 percent to discount this stream of costs by one year. 

MSHA estimates that validating, certifying, and uploading the CPDM data from a 

 

155

This would result in estimated costs of $64,732:  $9,709 in mines with 1-19 
employees (30 miners x $7.00 per week x 50 weeks x 0.925); $47,934 in mines with 
20-500 employees (148 miners x $7.00 per week x 50 weeks x 0.925); and $7,089 in 
mines with 501+ employees (22 miners x $7.00 per week x 50 weeks x 0.925). 
 

Cost to Validate, Certify and Provide CPDM Sampling Information to Part 90 

Proposed § 90.211(c) would require operators to provide certain sampling 

Miners 
 
information to Part 90 miners.  The sampling results must include:  the mine 
identification number; the location within the mine from which the samples were taken; 
the concentration of respirable dust for each valid sample; the total amount of exposure 
accumulated by the sampled occupation during the shift; the occupation code, where 
applicable; the reason for voiding a sample; the shift length; the Part 90 miner’s MSHA 
Individual Identification Number (MIIN); and any other information required by the 
District Manager.  This information is included on the printout from the CPDM, with the 
exception of the information concerning the shift length and the total amount of exposure 
accumulated by the sampled occupation during the shift.  MSHA expects that the 
information not included on the CPDM printout would be written down on the printout. 
 
Proposed § 90.201(f) would require the operator to make a record showing the 
length of each shift for each Part 90 miner, retain the records for at least six months, and 
make them available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and 
submit them to the District Manager when requested in writing. 

A new CPDM filter is used every time a CPDM is used to sample and a printout 
is generated after the sample is taken.  The number of printouts to be completed equals 
the number of CPDM filters used.  MSHA estimates that a supervisor, earning $69.98 an 
hour, would take 3 minutes (0.05 hours) to perform the functions described above.  
MSHA also estimates it would cost $0.15 to make a copy of each printout.  So the 
estimated cost per card is $3.65 ($69.98 x 0.05 + $0.15).  Since these costs would begin 
in the second year, MSHA applied a factor of 0.925 based on 7 percent to discount this 
stream of costs by one year. 

This would result in estimated costs of $168,767:  $25,315 in mines with 1-19 
employees (30 miners x $3.65 per card x 250 cards x 0.925); $124,887 in mines with 
20-500 employees (148 miners x $3.65 per card x 250 cards x 0.925); and $18,565 in 
mines with 501+ employees (22 miners x $3.65 per card x 250 cards x 0.925). 
 
$4.3 million of first year costs related to using CPDMs to sample Part 90 miners.

ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY 

MSHA has traditionally used a revenue screening test—whether the annualized 

compliance costs of a regulation are less than 1 percent of revenues, or are negative (i.e., 
provide net cost savings)—to establish presumptively that compliance with the regulation 
is economically feasible for the mining industry.  Based upon this test, MSHA has 
concluded that the requirements of the proposed rule are economically feasible.  The 
annualized compliance costs of the proposed rule to underground coal mine operators are 
$35.6 to 39.7 million, which are approximately 0.2 percent of total annual revenue of 
$17 billion ($39.7 million / $17 billion) for all underground coal mines.  The annualized 
compliance costs of the proposed rule to surface coal mine operators are $4.8 million, 
which are approximately 0.03 percent of total annual revenue of $16.6 billion 
($4.8 million / $16.6 billion) for all surface coal mines.  Since the estimated compliance 
costs for both underground and surface coal mines are below one percent of their 
estimated annual revenue, MSHA concludes that compliance with the provisions of the 
proposed rule would be economically feasible for the coal industry.

VI.  REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY CERTIFICATION 

INTRODUCTION 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, as amended by the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), MSHA has analyzed the 
compliance cost impact of the proposed rule on small entities.  Based on that analysis, 
MSHA certifies that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities in terms of compliance costs.  The factual basis for 
this certification is presented below. 

DEFINITION OF A SMALL MINE 

Under the RFA, in analyzing the impact of a rule on small entities, MSHA must 

use the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) definition for a small entity, or after 
consultation with the SBA Office of Advocacy, establish an alternative definition for the 
mining industry by publishing that definition in the Federal Register for notice and 
comment.  MSHA has not established an alternative definition, and is required to use 
SBA’s definition.  The SBA defines a small entity in the mining industry as an 
establishment with 500 or fewer employees. 

MSHA has also examined the impact of the proposed rule on mines with fewer 

than 20 employees, which MSHA and the mining community have traditionally referred 
to as “small mines.”  These small mines differ from larger mines not only in the number 
of employees, but also in economies of scale in material produced, in the type and 
amount of production equipment, and in supply inventory.  Therefore, their costs of 
complying with MSHA's rules and the impact of the Agency's rules on them would also 
tend to be different.  This analysis complies with the requirements of the RFA for an 
analysis of the impact on “small entities” while continuing MSHA's traditional definition 
of “small mines.” 

FACTUAL BASIS FOR CERTIFICATION 

General Approach 

MSHA’s  analysis of the economic impact on small entities begins with a 

“screening” analysis.  The screening analysis compares the estimated annualized cost of 
the proposed rule for small entities to their estimated annual revenue.  When the 
estimated cost is less than one percent of the estimated revenue for small entities, MSHA 
believes it is generally appropriate to conclude that the proposed rule would not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  If the estimated 
cost is equal to or exceeds one percent of revenue, MSHA will investigate whether 
further analysis is required. 

Derivation of Costs and Revenues for Mines 

The compliance costs noted in this chapter were previously presented in 

Chapter V of this document along with an explanation of how they were derived and the 
cost impact on mines, by size.  Revenue for underground and surface coal mines is 

 

159

derived from data on coal prices and tonnage.  The 2008 price of coal was $51.35 per 
short ton for underground coal and $22.35 per short ton for surface coal.6 

Total underground coal production in 2009 was approximately 5 million short 
tons for mines with 1-19 employees.  Multiplying tons by the 2008 price per ton, 2009 
underground coal revenue was $259 million for mines with 1-19 employees.  Total 
underground coal production in 2009 was approximately 242 million short tons for mines 
with 1-500 employees.  Multiplying tons by the 2008 price per ton, 2009 underground 
coal revenue was $12.4 billion for mines with 1-500 employees.  Total underground coal 
production in 2009 was approximately 332 million short tons.  Multiplying tons by the 
2008 price per ton, total estimated revenue in 2009 for underground coal production was 
$17.0 billion. 

Total surface coal production in 2009 was approximately 19.7 million short tons 
for mines with 1-19 employees.  Multiplying tons by the 2008 price per ton, 2009 surface 
coal revenue was $441 million for mines with 1-19 employees.  Total surface coal 
production in 2009 was approximately 495 million short tons for mines with 1-500 
employees.  Multiplying tons by the 2008 price per ton, 2009 surface coal revenue was 
$11.1 billion for mines with 1-500 employees.  Total surface coal production in 2009 was 
approximately 743 million short tons.  Multiplying tons by the 2008 price per ton, total 
estimated revenue in 2009 for surface coal production was $16.6 billion. 
 

Screening Analysis for Underground Coal Mines 

Table VI-1 below shows MSHA’s estimate of the cost of the proposed rule 

compared to mine revenue, by mine size.  The Agency has provided in Chapter V of the 
PREA a discussion of the costs of the proposed rule for each size category of mines.

As shown in Table VI-1, the annualized cost of the proposed rule for underground 
coal mines with 1-19 employees is approximately $1.6 million, or approximately $20,000 
per mine.  This is equal to approximately 0.63 percent of annual revenues.  MSHA

estimates that some mines might experience costs somewhat higher than the average per 
mine in their size category while others might experience lower costs. 

When applying SBA’s definition of a small mine, the annualized cost of the 
proposed rule for underground coal mines with 1-500 employees is approximately 
$34.1 million, or approximately $82,800 per mine.  This is equal to approximately 
0.28 percent of annual revenue. 

Based on this analysis, MSHA has determined that the proposed rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small underground coal 
mine operators with 500 or fewer employees.

mines with 1-19 employees is approximately $1.1 million, or approximately $1,800 per 
mine.  This is equal to approximately 0.25 percent of annual revenues.  MSHA estimates 
that some mines might experience costs somewhat higher than the average per mine in 
their size category while others might experience lower costs. 

When applying SBA’s definition of a small mine, the annualized cost of the 

proposed rule for surface coal mines with 1-500 employees is approximately 
$4.4 million, or approximately $4,000 per mine.  This is equal to approximately 
0.04 percent of annual revenue. 

Based on this analysis, MSHA has determined that the proposed rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small surface coal mine 
operators with 500 or fewer employees.

VII. OTHER REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA) 

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et. 

seq.), requires each Federal agency to consider the environmental effects of final actions 
and to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on major actions significantly 
affecting the quality of the environment.  MSHA has reviewed the proposed standard in 
accordance with NEPA requirements, the regulation of the Council on Environmental 
Quality (40 CFR Part 1500), and the Department of Labor’s NEPA procedures (29 CFR 
Part 11).  As a result of this review, MSHA has preliminarily determined that this 
proposed rule would have no significant environmental impact. 
 

THE UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT 

MSHA has reviewed the proposed rule under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).  MSHA has determined that this proposed rule does not include 
any federal mandate that may result in increased expenditures by State, local, or tribal 
governments; nor would it increase private sector expenditures by more than $100 million in any 
one year or significantly or uniquely affect small governments.  Accordingly, the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) requires no further Agency action or 
analysis. 
 

THE TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 1999:  
ASSESSMENT OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND POLICIES ON FAMILIES 

Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999 (5 
U.S.C. 601) requires agencies to assess the impact of Agency action on family well-being.  
MSHA has determined that the proposed rule would have no effect on family stability or safety, 
marital commitment, parental rights and authority, or income or poverty of families and children.  
The proposed rule impacts the coal mine industry.  Accordingly, MSHA certifies that the 
proposed rule would not impact family well-being. 
 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12630:  GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AND INTERFERENCE 
WITH CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED PROPERTY RIGHTS 

This proposed rule does not implement a policy with takings implications.  Accordingly, 

under E.O. 12630, no further Agency action or analysis is required. 
 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12988:  CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM 

The proposed rule was written to provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct and 
was carefully reviewed to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguities, so as to minimize litigation 
and undue burden on the Federal court system.  Accordingly, the proposed rule would meet the 
applicable standards provided in § 3 of E.O. 12988, Civil Justice Reform. 

 

162

 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13045:  PROTECTION OF CHILDREN FROM 
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RISKS AND SAFETY RISKS 
The proposed rule would have no adverse impact on children.  Accordingly, under E.O. 13045, 
no further Agency action or analysis is required. 
 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13132:  FEDERALISM 

The proposed rule does not have “federalism implications” because it would not “have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and 
the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
government.”  Accordingly, under E.O. 13132, no further Agency action or analysis is required. 
 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13175:  CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION WITH 
INDIAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS 

The proposed rule does not have “tribal implications” because it would not “have 

substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal 
government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the 
Federal government and Indian tribes.”  Accordingly, under E.O. 13175, no further Agency 
action or analysis is required. 
 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13211:  ACTIONS CONCERNING REGULATIONS THAT 
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ENERGY SUPPLY, DISTRIBUTION, OR USE 

Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to publish a statement of energy effects when a 
rule has a significant energy action that adversely affects energy supply, distribution or use.  The 
proposed rule has been reviewed for its impact on the supply, distribution, and use of energy 
because it applies to the coal mining industry.  Insofar as the proposed rule would result in 
annualized compliance costs of $35.6 to 39.7 million for the underground coal industry relative 
to annual revenues of $17 billion in 2009 and annualized compliance costs of $4.8 million for 
surface coal industry relative to annual revenue of $16.6 billion in 2009, it is not a “significant 
energy action” because it is not “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, 
distribution, or use of energy * * * (including a shortfall in supply, price increases, and increased 
use of foreign supplies).” Accordingly, Executive Order 13211 requires no further Agency action 
or analysis. 
 

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13272:  PROPER CONSIDERATION OF SMALL ENTITIES IN 
AGENCY RULEMAKING 

MSHA has thoroughly reviewed the proposed rule to assess and take appropriate account 

of its potential impact on small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small 
organizations.  MSHA has determined and certified that the proposed rule does not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

VIII. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF 1995 

INTRODUCTION 

This section shows the estimated paperwork burden hours and related costs to 

underground and surface mine operators under the proposed rule.  The burden hour and 
cost estimates presented in this chapter are based upon the detailed analysis presented in 
Chapter V.  The estimates for underground mine operators including Part 90 miners 
employed at underground mines are presented first followed by the estimates for the 
surface mine operators including Part 90 miners employed at surface mines. 

SUMMARY OF PAPERWORK BURDEN HOURS AND RELATED COSTS 

Table VIII-1 shows that, in the first year the proposed rule is in effect, coal mine 
operators would incur 120,864 hours with related costs of approximately $10.2 million at 
underground and surface operations.

DESCRIPTION OF PAPERWORK PROVISIONS 
 
A. Proposed §§ 70.201(k) and 90.201(k) -Training for Miners Using CPDMP 
Burden to Make Records for CPDM Training 

 

164

Proposed § 70.201(k) and 90.201(k) would require that operators keep a record of the 
CPDM training. MSHA estimates that 7,813 miners would receive CPDM training each 
year.  MSHA estimates that it takes a clerical employee earning $26.00 an hour 
0.00833 hours (30 seconds) to make a record of each miner that received CPDM training.  
MSHA estimates that the annual burden hours and costs to make records for miners 
receiving CPDM training are approximately 65 hours (7,813 x 0.00833) and $1,690 (65 
hours x $26.00 per hour). 
B. Proposed §§ 70.201(g) and 90.201(f) Record of Shift Length 
Burden to Make a Record of Shift Length for Underground Mines 
Proposed § 70.201(g) and 90.201(f) would require the operator to record the actual length 
of each production shift for each MMU. MSHA estimates that a supervisor, earning 
$84.70 an hour, would take 1 minute (0.0167 hours) to record the length of each 
production shift. 
MSHA estimates that there are 93 shifts per day in mines with 1-19 employees (69 
MMUs with 1 shift per day + 12 MMUs with 2 shifts per day); 1,445 shifts per day in 
mines with 20-500 employees (45 MMUs with 1 shift per day + 589 MMUs with 2 shifts 
per day + 74 MMUs with 3 shifts per day) ; and 273 shifts per day in mines with 501+ 
employees (3 MMUs with 2 shifts per day + 89 MMUs with 3 shifts per day).  Records 
would need to be made of the length of these shifts each working day. MSHA estimates 
that, on average, the number of workdays per year is:  200 days for mines with 1-19 
employees (4 days per week x 50 weeks); 300 days for mines with 20 or more employees 
(6 days per week x 50 weeks) ; and 350 days for mines with 501+ employees (7 days per 
week x 50 weeks). MSHA’s estimates of underground coal operators’ annual burden 
hours and related costs are presented below (these estimates do not include the hours and 
costs for records of shift length at surface areas of underground mines; these are 
presented below).

C. Proposed § 71.201(d) Record of Shift Length 
Burden to Make a Record of Shift Length for Surface Mines 
Proposed § 71.201(d) would require the operator to record the actual length of each 
normal work shift for each DWP working at surface mines.  MSHA estimates that a 
miner, earning $31.84 an hour, would take 1 minute (0.0167 hours) to record the length 
of each normal work shift. 
MSHA estimates that the average number of shifts per day is:  1 shift per day in mines 
with 1-19 employees; 2 shifts per day in mines with 20-500 employees; and 2 shifts per 
day in mines with 501+ employees.  Records would need to be made of the length of 

93 shifts per day x 200 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 311 hrs. 
1,445 shifts per day x 300 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 7,239 hrs. 
273 shifts per day x 350 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 1,596 hrs.

22,995 hrs. x $31.84 wage rate = $732,160 

1,107 DWPs x 1shift per day x 250 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 4,622 hrs. 
1,759 DWPs x 2 shifts per day x 300 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 17,625 hrs. 
64 DWPs x 2 shifts per day x 350 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 748 hrs. 

these shifts each working day.  MSHA estimates that, on average, the number of 
workdays per year is:  250 days for mines with 1-19 employees (5 days per week x 
50 weeks); 300 days for mines with 20 or more employees (6 days per week x 50 weeks); 
and 350 days for mines with 501+ employees (7 days per week x 50 weeks). There are 
2,930 DWPs at surface mines and facilities, 1,107 DWPs at mines with 1-19 employees; 
1,759 DWPs at mines with 20-500 employees; and 64 DWPs at mines with 501+ 
employees.  MSHA’s estimates of surface coal operators’ annual burden hours and 
related costs are presented below.

Burden to Make a Record of Shift Length for Surface Areas at Underground Mines 
Proposed § 71.201(d) would require the operator to record the actual length of each 
normal work shift for each DWP working at surface areas of underground mines.  MSHA 
estimates that a miner, earning $35.30 an hour, would take 1 minute (0.0167 hours) to 
record the length of each normal work shift. 
MSHA estimates that the average number of shifts per day is:  1 shift per day in mines 
with 1-19 employees, 2 shifts per day in mines with 20-500 employees, and 3 shifts per 
day in mines with 501+ employees.  Records would need to be made of the length of 
these shifts each working day. The number of workdays is the same as estimated above 
for underground mines: 200 days for mines with 1-19 employees, 300 days for mines 
with 20-500 employees and 350 days for mines with 501+ employees. There are 89 
DWPs at surface areas of underground mines, which consist of: 13 DWPs at mines with 
1-19 employees, 47 DWPs at mines with 20-500 employees and 29 DWPs at mines with 
501+ employees.  MSHA’s estimates of underground coal operators’ annual burden hours 
and related costs are presented below.

D. Proposed § 70.201(i) Record of Material Produced 
Burden to Make a Record of Material Mined 
Proposed § 70.201(i) would require the operator to record the amount of run-of-mine 
material produced by each MMU during each shift. Some mines already record the 

13 DWPs x 1shift per day x 200 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 43 hrs. 
47 DWPs x 2 shifts per day x 300 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 471 hrs. 
29 DWPs x 3 shifts per day x 350 days x 0.0167 hrs. = 509 hrs. 

1,023 hrs. x $35.30 wage rate = $36,112 

 

166

84 shifts per day x 200 days x 0.0833 hrs. = 1,399 hrs. 
1,084 shifts per day x 300 days x 0.0833 hrs. = 27,089 hrs. 

28,488 hrs. x $84.70 wage rate = $2,412,933 

material produced per shift, however, most do not. MSHA estimates that a supervisor, 
earning $84.70 an hour, would take 5 minutes (0.0833 hours) to record the material 
produced on each shift. 
MSHA estimates that material produced is not recorded for 90% of shifts in mines with 
1-19 employees and75% of shifts in mines with 20-500 employees. All mines with 501+ 
employees currently record the material produced on each shift. MSHA estimates that 
material produced is not recorded for 84 shifts per day in mines with 1-19 employees (93 
shifts x 0.90) and 1,084 shifts per day in mines with 20-500 employees (1,445 shifts x 
0.75. MSHA’s estimates of underground coal operators’ annual burden hours and related 
costs are presented below.

E. Proposed §§ 70.206 and 90.206 Burden to Write, Submit, and Revise CPDM 
Plans to MSHA for Approval and Related Provisions 
Burden to Write and Submit CPDM Plans to MSHA for Approval 
Proposed § 70.206(a) and § 90.206(a) and (b) for underground coal mines would require 
that operators using a CPDM must have an approved CPDM Performance Plan to ensure 
that no miner working on an MMU shall be exposed to concentrations of respirable coal 
mine dust in excess of the applicable standard.  MSHA assumes that underground 
operators would develop one CPDM plan that covers all miners working at underground 
mines including Part 90 miners.  So each underground coal operator would need a plan 
and the number of plans would be equal to the number of mines, i.e., 424.  On average, 
MSHA estimates that a supervisor will take 4 hours to write a proposed CPDM plan and 
a clerical employee will take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and submit it.  MSHA’s 
estimates of underground coal operators first year burden hours and related costs are 
presented below.

148 revised plans x 0.5 hrs. = 74 hrs. 
148 revised plans x 0.25 hrs. = 37 hrs. 
Total burden hours = 111 hrs. 

MSHA estimates that 35 percent of mine operators that submit CPDM plans to the 
Agency for approval would need to revise the plans before MSHA approval could be 
obtained.  MSHA estimates that 148 plans would be revised (424 x 0.35).  On average, 
MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor 0.5 hours (30 minutes) to write revisions 
to a proposed plan and a clerical employee 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and submit 
the plan.  MSHA’s estimates of underground coal operators first year burden hours and 
related costs are presented below.

at least 5 days prior to submission of a CPDM Performance Plan and any revisions.  If 
requested, the operator shall provide a copy to the representative of the miners.  MSHA 
assumes that 100 percent of the time the representative of the miners would request to be 
provided with the plan.  MSHA estimates that 572 plans (424 proposed plans + 148 
revised plans) would be provided to the miners’ representative. MSHA estimates that a 
clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to notify and provide a copy of the 
CPDM plan.  MSHA estimates that first year burden hours and related costs to 
underground coal operators to notify and provide to the miners representative proposed 
and revised CPDM plans submitted to MSHA for approval are 143 hours (572 plans x 
0.25) and $3,718 (143 hrs. x $26.00). 
Burden to Post CPDM Plans Submitted to MSHA for Approval 
Proposed § 70.206(a)(3) would require that a copy of proposed CPDM Performance 
Plans and any revisions submitted for approval be posted on the mine bulletin board. 
Proposed § 90.206(d) would require that if a mine has Part 90 miners, then they need to 
be given a copy of the plan. The number of proposed and revised CPDM plans submitted 
for approval determined above would be posted or provided to a Part 90 miner.  MSHA 
estimates that a clerical employee would take 0.25 hours (15 minutes) to copy and post or 
copy and provide the plan to a Part 90 miner.  MSHA estimates that first year burden 
hours and related costs to underground coal operators to copy and post proposed and 
revised CPDM plans submitted to MSHA for approval are 143 hours (572 plans x 0.25) 
and $3,718 (143 hrs. x $26.00). 
Posting and Providing Approved Plans 

 

168

Proposed §§ 70.206(c) would require a copy of the approved plan to be posted and to be 
provided to the miners’ representative upon request.  MSHA has not assessed any 
additional burden or costs for this proposed requirement because the burden and costs of 
posting and providing copies to the miners’ representatives of all of the proposed plans 
and revisions were included in the previous estimates.  Once the plans are approved the 
miners’ representative would already have the copy and would just have to be notified.  If 
the plans are not approved the cost for the revisions (including the posting and providing 
copies to the mines’ representative) was also included in the estimates presented above. 
Proposed § 90.206(d) would require that Part 90 miners be given a copy of the plan.  The 
number of Part 90 miners as of January 2010 is:  no Part 90 miners in mines with 1-19 
employees, 47 Part 90 miners in mines with 20-500 employees, and 19 Part 90 miners in 
mines with 501+ employees. 
MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to provide 
a copy of the plan to a Part 90 miner.  MSHA estimates that first year burden hours and 
cost would be approximately 17 hours (66 plans x 0.25 hours) and $429 (17 hours x 
$26.00). 
F. Proposed §§ 70.206 70.208, 70.209, 90.206, and 90.209 Burden of Revisions to 
MSHA Approved CPDM Performance Plans 
Burden to Revise and Submit Revisions to Approved CPDM Plans 
MSHA anticipates that revisions to approved CPDM plans by underground coal operators 
would occur under proposed §§ 70.206(d), 70.208(f)(4), 70.208(g)(4), 70.209(g)(4), 
90.206(b), 90.206(e), 90.209(e)(4) and 90.209(f)(4).  MSHA estimates that 25 percent of 
mine operators would make revisions to approved CPDM plans each year.  This estimate 
includes the small number of plans being submitted by “new” mines where the operator 
revises a “model” plan supplied by MSHA or a plan previously used at another location. 
Thus, 106 underground coal operators would make revisions to an approved CPDM plan 
each year (424 x 0.25). MSHA estimates that there would be 390 revisions each year: 40 
revisions for mines with 1-19 employees (20 mines x 2 revisions), 332 revisions in mines 
with 20-500 employees (83 mines x 4 revisions), and 18 revisions with 501+ employees 
(3 mines x 6 revisions). On average, MSHA estimates that a supervisor takes 0.25 hours 
(15 minutes) to revise an approved plan, and a clerical employee takes 0.25 hours 
(15 minutes) to copy and submit the revision. Since CPDMs are not required to be used 
until 12 months after the final rule becomes effective, revisions to approved plans are not 
assumed to occur until after that time. MSHA’s estimates of the annual burden hours and 
related costs to underground coal operators beginning in the second year are presented 
below.

Burden to Notify and Provide to the Representative of the Miners Revisions to Approved 
CPDM Plans 
Under proposed § 70.206(c)(3) revisions to approved CPDM plans must be provided to 
the miners representative, if requested.  MSHA assumes that a 100% of the time the 
miners’ representative would request the revisions to an approved CPDM plan.  On 
average, MSHA estimates that a clerical employee takes 0.25 hrs. (15 minutes) to copy 
and provide the revisions to the approved CPDM plan.  MSHA estimates that the annual 
burden hours and related costs to underground coal operators to provide approved CPDM 
plan revisions to the representative of the miners are approximately 98 hours (390 
revisions x 0.25) and $2,548 (98 hours x $26.00). 
Burden to Post Approved CPDM Plans and Revisions 
Proposed § 70.206(c)(3) would require that revisions of approved CPDM plans be posted 
on the mine bulletin board.  Proposed § 90.206(d) would require Part 90 miners to be 
given a copy of the plan. Out of the number of approved CPDM plan revisions 
determined above, there would be 66 posted or provided to the Part 90 miners.  MSHA 
estimates that a clerical employee takes 0.25 hours (15 minutes) to copy and post or copy 
and provide revisions to a Part 90 miner.  MSHA estimates that annual burden hours and 
related costs to underground coal operators to copy and post approved CPDM plan 
revisions are approximately 17 hours (66 revisions x 0.25) and $442 (17 hours x $26.00). 
G. Proposed § 70.208(h) Use of Supplementary Controls 
Proposed § 70.208(h) would require that during the period specified, if an operator is 
unable to maintain compliance with the applicable standard for an MMU and has 
determined that all feasible engineering or environmental controls are being used on the 
MMU, the operator may request through the District Manager that the Administrator for 
Coal Mine Safety and Health approve the use of supplementary controls for a period not 
to exceed 6 months. 
MSHA estimates that a supervisor takes 8 hours to write an initial request to use 
supplementary controls for each MMU and a clerical employee 15 minutes (0.25 hrs.) to 
copy and submit the request.  MSHA estimates that a total of 29 MMUs would need to 
request the use of supplementary controls. MSHA estimates the operators would make an 
average of 2 requests per MMU during the year, since approvals for such requests are 
only good for 6 months. MSHA’s estimates of the first year burden hours and costs to 
underground coal operators are presented below. 
      Burden Hours

H. Proposed §§ 70.210 and 90.210 Respirable Dust Samples; Transmission by 
Operator 
Cost to Validate, Certify, and Transmit CPDM Data Electronically to MSHA 
Proposed §§ 70.210(f) and 90.210(f) require underground coal operators to have a 
designated mine official validate, certify, and transmit electronically to MSHA within 
12 hours after the end of the last sampling shift of the work week all daily samples and 
error data file information collected during the previous week.  MSHA estimates that 
validating, certifying, and uploading the data from a CPDM to a computer and then 
transmitting the data electronically to MSHA would take a designated mine official 
earning a supervisor’s wage, 6 minutes (0.1 hours).  MSHA estimates that each CPDM 
would be used for 50 working weeks per year. 
 
MSHA assumes that CPDMs associated with the use of supplementary controls would 
typically only be used in the first year (i.e., supplementary controls would not be 
permitted after the second year and CPDM use for DOs, Part 90 miners and ODOs would 
not be required until the second year.) MSHA estimates that first year burden hours and 
cost to underground coal operators to validate, certify, and transmit electronically CPDM 
data from supplementary controls to MSHA would be approximately 870 hours (174 
CPDMs x 50 weeks x 0.1 hrs) and $73,689 (870 hours x $84.70). 
 
In the second year the use of CPDMs associated with supplementary controls would be 
phased out.  Sampling of the DOs and Part 90 miners would begin at the start of the 
second year and sampling of the ODOs would begin after 6 months. Annual burden hours 
and costs beginning the second year would be 8,570 hours (1,714 CPDMs x 50 weeks x 
0.1 hrs.) and $725,880 (8,570 hrs. x $84.70) for DOs and Part 90 miners. For ODOs the 
burden hours and costs would be 1,918 hours (767 CPDMs x 25 weeks x 0.1 hrs.) and 
$162,455 (1,918 hrs. x $84.70). 
Year 3 
  
 
In the third year the CPDM would be used to sample DOs and Part 90 miners as 
well as ODOs. Annual burden hours and costs in the third year would be 12,405 hours 
(2,481 CPDMs x 50 weeks x 0.1 hrs.) and $1,050,705 (12,405 hrs. x $84.70). 
I. Proposed §§ 70.211(c) and 90.211(c) CPDM Sampling Information 
Burden to Validate, Certify, and Post CPDM Sampling Information 
Proposed §§ 70.211(c) and 90.211(c) would require the operator to validate and certify 
sampling information after each shift.  The information for underground miners must be 
posted on the mine bulletin board, and the sampling information for each Part 90 miner 
must be provided to the miner. Proposed § 70.201(g) and § 90.201(f) require a record to 
be made of the length of each shift for each MMU.  MSHA assumes that this would be 
done at the same time as the posting of sampling information, which also would require a 
record of the shift length. The paperwork burden hours and costs for proposed § 

 

171

70.211(c) that were developed below include the hours and cost of both proposed § 
70.201(g) and § 90.201(f).  MSHA estimates that a supervisor, earning $84.70 an hour, 
would take 3 minutes (0.05 hours) to complete copy and post each set of sampling 
information. 
Year 1 
Mines that request and use supplementary controls would be required to sample using a 
CPDM. Every time a CPDM is used to sample, a new CPDM filter is used and sampling 
information is generated after the sample is taken.  Therefore, the number of sets of 
sampling information to validate, certify, and post, or provide to the Part 90 miner, equals 
the number of CPDM filters used. MSHA estimates that 49,800 filters would be used to 
monitor workers using CPDMs associated with supplementary controls during the first 
year. MSHA estimates that the first year burden hours would be 2,490 (49,800 sampling 
information x 0.05 hours) and the cost would be $210,903 (2,490 hours x $84.70). 
Year 2 
Based upon the estimated shifts worked at each mine size and the estimated days of 
production each year MSHA estimates that underground mine operators would take 
568,400 samples with the CPDM each year for DO and Part 90 miners and have to fill 
out 568,400 sets of sampling information. The annual burden hours for underground DO 
and Part 90 samples is 28,420 (568,400 sample information x 0.05 hours) and the cost is 
$2,407,174 (28,420 hours x $84.70 per hour). 
Based upon the estimated shifts worked at each mine size, MSHA estimates that 3,847 
ODO samples would be taken during each day of sampling. The proposed rule would 
require each ODO to be sampled for 14 days each quarter; therefore, MSHA estimates 
that 53,858 ODO samples would be taken each quarter.  ODO sampling begins after 18 
months; therefore there would be 2 quarters of ODO sampling in the second year.  
MSHA estimates that the second year burden and cost to complete and post a dust data 
card printouts for each CPDM after each shift of ODO sampling is approximately 5,386 
hours (53,858 samples per quarter x 2 quarters x 0.05 hours) and a cost of $456,194 
(5,386 hours x $84.70). 
Year 3 
The annual burden hours and cost for underground DO and Part 90 samples are the same 
as the second year, 28,420 hours and $2,407,174.  The annual burden hours and cost for 
ODO sampling would be twice as high as in the second year because 4 quarters of 
sampling will occur rather than 2 - 10,772 hours and $912,388. 
J. Proposed §§ 70.210(c), 70.211(b), 71.208(c), 71.209(b), 90.210(c) and 90.211(b) 
Gravimetric Sampling 
Burden of Transmitting the Samples 
Proposed §§ 70.210(c), 71.208(c) and 90.210(c) would require each sample to be 
transmitted to MSHA along with a completed dust data card.  MSHA estimates that a 
certified dust technician with an estimated hourly wage of $31.77 in an underground coal 
mine and $28.66 in a surface coal mine would take 6 minutes (0.1 hours) to prepare and 
send one sample, along with the dust data card, to MSHA.  After filling out the dust data 
card, a certified person signs the card and writes the certification number on it.  On

15,298 samples x 0.1 hrs. = 1,530 hrs. 
15,298 samples x 0.025 hrs. = 382 hrs. 
Total burden hours = 1,912 

1,530 hrs. x $31.77 wage rate = $48,608 
382 hrs. x $84.70 wage rate = $32,355 
Total burden cost = $80,964 

average, MSHA estimates that a certified person (normally the mine safety inspector or 
an equivalent person) with an estimated hourly wage of $84.70 in an underground mine 
and $69.98 in a surface mine takes 1.5 minutes (0.025 hours) to complete and sign the 
dust data card. MSHA’s estimates of the burden hours and costs are presented below. 
Estimate for Underground Mines: 
Due to phasing out of the gravimetric sampler for the monitoring of DOs and Part 90 
miners (in 12 months) and ODOs (in 18 months), the estimates for underground coal 
operators vary by year. 
Year 1 
Due to the increased sampling required under the proposed provisions, in year 1, there 
would be an increase of 15,298 samples for underground mines.

Cost of Posting the Sample Results 
Proposed §§ 70.211(b) and 71.209(b) would require mine operators to post the sample 
results on the mine bulletin board.   Proposed § 90.211(b) would require mine operators 
to provide Part 90 miners with a copy of the sample results.  For purposes of this burden 
analysis, MSHA assumes that it takes the same amount of time to provide a copy of the 
sample results to the Part 90 miner as it does to post the sample results on the mine 
bulletin board. 
On average, MSHA estimates that it takes a clerical employee, making $26.00 an hour in 
underground mines and $25.45 an hour at surface mines, 0.1 hours (6 minutes) to copy 
and post the sample results. MSHA’s estimates of the burden hours and costs are 
presented below. 
Underground Mines: 
Due to the phasing out of the gravimetric sampler for the monitoring of DOs and Part 90 
miners (in 12 months) and ODOs (in 18 months), the estimates for underground coal 
operators vary by year. 
Year 1 
In the first year, there would be no change to the number of times the DO results would 
have to be posted.  The posting of the DA results and providing the Part 90 miner results 
would decrease by 2 occasions due to the decrease in the sampling frequency from 
bimonthly to quarterly.  Therefore MSHA estimates a decrease of 1,810 postings in 

 

174

underground mines in the first year.   MSHA estimates that the burden hour and cost 
savings to underground coal mines in the first year are approximately 181 saved hours 
(1,810 postings x 0.1 hours) and $4,706 (181 hours x $26.00) in saved costs. 
Year 2 
Due to the shift from the gravimetric sampler to the CPDM for DOs and Part 90 miners at 
the beginning of the second year and for the ODOs after 18 months, MSHA estimates 
that there would be an overall decrease of 7,464 postings for underground mines. MSHA 
estimates that the burden hour and cost savings to underground coal mines in the second 
year are approximately 746 saved hours (7,464 postings x 0.1 hours) and $19,396 (746 
hours x $26.00) in saved costs. 
Year 3 
Due to the shift from the gravimetric sampler to the CPDM (for DOs, Part 90 miners and 
ODOs) during the second year, MSHA estimates that there would be an overall decrease 
of 7,464 postings for underground mines in the third year. MSHA estimates that the 
burden hour and cost savings to underground coal mines in the third year are 
approximately 746 saved hours (7,464 postings x 0.1 hours) and $19,396 (746 hours x 
$26.00) in saved costs. 
Surface Mines: 
The posting of the DWP results would increase by twice the number of additional DWPs, 
therefore MSHA estimates an annual increase in samples for surface mines of 9,878. 
MSHA estimates that the annual burden hours and costs to surface mines are 
approximately 988 hours (9,878 samples x 0.1 hours) and $25,145 (988 hours x $25.45). 
K. Estimated Burden and Cost for Abatement Resulting from Proposed Rule 
Burden to Submit Corrective Actions - Proposed §§ 70.207(g)(2), 70.208(f)(3), 
70.209(e)(2), 71.207(k)(2), 90.208(e)(2), 90.209(e)(3) and Revising Mine Ventilation or 
Dust Control Plan – Proposed §§ 70.207(h), 70.209(f), 71.207(l), 71.300(a), 90.208(f) 
and 90.300(a) 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(g)(2), 70.209(e)(2), and 
90.208(e)(2)) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(k)(2)) would be 
required, during the abatement time fixed in a citation for violation of the applicable 
standard to submit corrective actions for MSHA approval.  Underground coal operators 
under proposed §§ 70.208(f)(3) and 90.209(e)(3) would be required to submit corrective 
actions for MSHA approval when a valid end-of-shift equivalent concentration 
measurement meets or exceeds the applicable ECV, or exceeds a weekly permissible 
accumulated exposure. 
For underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(h), 70.209(f), 90.208(f) and 
90.300(a)) and surface coal operators (under proposed §§ 71.207(l), 71.300(a), 90.208(f) 
and 90.300(a)), one of the conditions for terminating a citation for violation of the 
applicable standard is that the underground operator submits revised dust control 
parameters as part of the mine ventilation plan, or a dust control plan or revisions, and the 
surface operator submits a new or revised dust control plan applicable to the DWP or 
Part 90 miner identified in the citation. Further, underground coal operators under

504 submissions x 0.25 hrs. = 126 hrs. 
504 submissions x 0.1 hrs. = 50 hrs. 
Total burden hours = 176 hrs. 

proposed § 90.300(a) and surface coal operators under proposed § 71.300(a) would need 
to submit a dust control plan or revision to a dust control plan identified in a citation. 
MSHA estimates that a supervisor (earning $84.70 per hour in an underground coal mine 
and $69.98 per hour in a surface coal mine) would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to write 
up the corrective actions for submission; and a clerical employee (earning $26 per hour in 
an underground coal mine and $25.45 in a surface coal mine) would take 6 minutes 
(0.1 hours) to submit the corrective actions.  MSHA’s estimates for burden hours and 
costs are presented below.

Burden of Completing Dust Data Card and Sending the Gravimetric Sample and Card to 
MSHA 
Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.210(c) and 90.210(c)) and surface 
coal operators (under proposed § 71.208(c)) must complete the dust data card and submit 
the card to MSHA along with the sample. 
On each dust data card, the person completing the dust data card is a certified dust 
technician with an estimated hourly wage of $31.77 in an underground coal mine and 
$28.66 in surface mines.  On average, MSHA estimates that a certified dust technician 
takes 6 minutes (0.1 hours) to complete the dust data card, sign it and send it along with 
the sample to MSHA.  After filling out the dust data card, a certified person signs the 
card and writes the certification number on it.  On average, MSHA estimates that a 
certified person (normally the mine safety inspector or an equivalent person) takes 
1.5 minutes (0.025 hours) to review and sign the dust data card.  A supervisor’s hourly 
wage is estimated to be $84.70 in an underground mine and $69.98 in a surface mine. 
Year 1 
Underground Mines: 
In year 1 underground mines would be using the gravimetric sampler, thus the number of 
dust data cards equates to the number of abatement samples taken. Five abatement 
samples must be taken if there is a violation of the applicable dust standard or the sample 
exceeds the applicable standard but is below the ECV.  Therefore, for underground coal 
mines, MSHA estimates that the number of dust data cards to complete, sign, and send 
would be 2,645 (529 times standard was exceeded x 5 samples).  MSHA’s estimates of 
the burden hours and costs are presented below.

Surface Mines: 
As is explained in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA has not projected any additional costs 
for surface coal mines completing dust data cards and sending them along with the 
samples to MSHA in the first year because the existing standards currently require 
surface mine operators to take 5 additional samples, complete the data cards and send the 
results to MSHA whenever a sample result exceeds the applicable standard. 
Year 2 
Underground Mines: 

2,645 submissions x 0.025 hrs. = 66 hrs. 
2,645 submissions x 0.1 hrs. = 265 hrs. 
Total burden hours = 331 hrs. 

66 hrs. x $84.70 wage rate = $5,590 
265 hrs. x $31.77 wage rate = $8,419 
Total burden cost = $14,009

8 hrs. x $69.98 wage rate = $560 
32 hrs. x $28.66 wage rate = $917 
Total burden cost = $1,477 

As explained in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA has not projected any additional costs 
for underground coal mines completing dust data cards and sending them along with the 
samples to MSHA in the second year because these mines would be using the CPDM to 
sample every day. 
Surface Mines: 
The number of dust data cards equates to the number of samples taken.  Therefore, for 
surface coal mines, MSHA estimates that the number of dust data cards to complete, sign, 
and send would be 315. MSHA’s estimates of the burden and cost to complete, sign, and 
send dust data cards, along with samples, to MSHA in the second year that the final rule 
is in effect are presented below.

Underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.211(b)) and surface coal operators 
(under proposed § 71.209(b)) must post sample results.  Proposed § 90.211(b) would 
require mine operators to provide Part 90 miners with a copy of the sample results. 
MSHA assumes that it takes the same amount of time to provide a copy of the sample 
results to the Part 90 miner as it does to post the sample results on the mine bulletin 
board.  On average, MSHA estimates that a clerical employee takes 0.1 hours (6 minutes) 
to copy and post the sample results. The number of sample results to post equates to the 
number of samples taken. 
Year 1 
Underground Mines: 
MSHA estimates that the number of samples to post would be 529. MSHA estimates that 
the burden and cost to post sample results in the first year that the rule is in effect would 
be approximately 53 hours (529 summaries x 0.1 hours) and $1,378 (53 hours x $26.00). 
Surface Mines: 
As noted above, since there is no additional sampling in surface coal mines in the first 
year of the final rule there are no cost for posting sample results. 
Year 2 
Underground Mines: 
As explained in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA has not projected any additional costs 
for underground coal mines posting the gravimetric sample results in the second year 
because these mines would be using the CPDM to sample every day. 
Surface Mines: 
MSHA estimates that the number of samples to post would be 63.  MSHA estimates that 
the burden and cost to post sample results in the second year that the rule is in effect 
would be approximately 7 burden hours (63 results x 0.1 hours) and a cost of $178 (7 
hours x $25.45). 
Year 3 
Underground Mines: 
As is explained in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA has not projected any additional costs 
for underground coal mines completing posting the gravimetric sample results in the 
second year because these mines would be using the CPDM to sample every day. 
Surface Mine: 
MSHA estimates that the number of samples to post in the third year would be 39.  
MSHA estimates that the burden and cost to post sample results in the third year that the 
rule is in effect would be approximately 4 burden hours (39 results x 0.1 hours) and a cost 
of $102 (4 hours x $25.45).

operator indicate the equivalent concentration of a sample result is above the applicable 
standard a record of the corrective actions taken must be made in the same manner as the 
record required by existing § 75.363. 
Under existing § 75.363 a certified person would make the record and the record must be 
countersigned by a mine foreman or equivalent mine official.  MSHA estimates that a 
certified person (earning a supervisor’s wage rate) would take 6 minutes (0.1 hrs.) make 
the record and a mine official (also earning a supervisor’s wage rate) would take 
3 minutes (0.05 hrs.) to countersign the record.

Operator Adjustments to Plan – Proposed §§ 70.207(c)(2), 70.209(b)(2), 71.207(h)(2),  
and 90.208(b)(2) 
For underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.207(c)(2), 70.209(b)(2), and 
90.208(b)(2) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(h)(2)) if a sample 
result is above the new applicable standard, the underground coal operator must make 
necessary adjustments to the dust control parameters in the mine ventilation plan and the 
surface coal operator must revise the dust control parameters. 
MSHA estimates that the number of occasions where operators would make adjustments 
would be 25 in underground mines and 5 in surface mines.  On average, MSHA estimates 
that it would take a supervisor (earning $84.70 per hour in an underground mine and 
$69.98 per hour in a surface mine) 15 minutes (0.25 hrs.) to make adjustments. MSHA’s 
estimates for the burden hours and costs in the first year for underground mines are 6 
burden hours (25 revisions x 0.25 hours) and a cost of $508 (6 hours x $84.70). MSHA’s 
estimates for the burden hours and costs in the first year for surface mines are 1 hour (5 
revisions x 0.25 hours) and $70 (1 hour x $69.98). 
Notify Representative of the Miners – Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(i), 75.370(f)(1) and 
Proposed §§ 71.300(a)(1) and 71.300(d)(1) 
Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(i) and 75.370(f)(1) for underground coal operators and proposed 
§§ 71.300(a)(1) and 71.300(d)(1) for surface coal operators would require notification to 
the representative of miners of a plan revision.  MSHA estimates that a clerical employee 
takes 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to notify and provide a copy of the plan to the 
representative of the miners.  MSHA assumes that all miners’ representatives would 
request a copy of the plan.  MSHA estimates that the number of notifications would be 
equal to the number of occasions corrective actions were submitted, which was 
determined above. 
Year 1 
The number of notifications in the first year would be 504 for underground coal operators 
and 76 for surface coal mines.  MSHA estimates that the burden and cost to notify the 
miners’ representative and provide a copy if requested in the first year that the rule is in 
effect would be approximately 126 hours (504 notifications x 0.25 hours) and $3,276 
(126 hours x $26.00) for underground coal operators and 19 hours (76 notifications x 
0.25) and $484 (19 hours x $25.45) for surface coal operators. 
Year 2 
The number of notifications in year 2 would be 666 for underground coal operators and 
59 for surface coal mines. MSHA estimates that the burden and cost to notify the miners’ 

 

182

representative and provide a copy if requested in the second year that the rule is in effect 
would be approximately 167 hours (666 notifications x 0.25 hours) and $4,342 (167 
hours x $26.00) for underground coal operators. For surface operators MSHA estimates 
15 hours (59 notifications x 0.25 hours) and $382 (15 hours x $25.45). 
Year 3 
The number of  notifications in the third year would be 269 for underground coal 
operators and 36 for surface coal mines.  MSHA estimates that the burden and cost to 
notify the miners’ representative, and provide a copy if requested, in the third year that 
the rule is in effect would be approximately 68 hours (269 notifications x 0.25 hours) and 
$1,768 (68 hours x $26.00) for underground coal operators and 10 hours (36 notifications 
x 0.25 hours) and $255 (10 hours x $25.45) for surface coal operators. 
Post Copy of Plan Revision – Existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(iii), and 75.370(f)(3) and 
Proposed §§ 71.301(a)(3), and 71.301(d)(3) 
Underground coal operators under existing §§ 75.370(a)(3)(iii) and 75.370(f)(3) and 
surface coal operators under proposed §§ 71.301(a)(3), and 71.301(d)(3) would be 
required to post a copy of the proposed or revised Plan on the mine bulletin board.  
MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy 
and post. 
Year 1 
MSHA estimates that the number of postings in year 1 would be 504 in underground 
mines and 76 for surface mines. MSHA estimates that the burden and cost to copy and 
post in the first year the final rule is effective would be approximately 126 hours (504 
notifications x 0.25 hours) and $3,276 (126 hours x $26.00) for underground coal 
operators and 19 hours (76 x 0.25) and $484 (19 hours x $25.45) for surface coal 
operators. 
Year 2 
MSHA estimates that the number of postings in the second year would be 666 in 
underground mines and 59 in surface coal mines.  MSHA estimates that the burden and 
cost to copy and post in the second year the final rule is effective would be approximately 
167 hours (666 notifications x 0.25 hours) and $4,342 (167 hours x $26.00) for 
underground coal operators. For surface operators MSHA estimates 15 hours (59 
notifications x 0.25 hours) and $382 (15 hours x $25.45) for surface coal operators. 
Year 3 
MSHA estimates that the number of postings in the third year would be 269 in 
underground mines and 36 in surface coal mines. MSHA estimates that the burden and 
cost to copy and post in the third year the final rule is effective would be approximately 
68 hours (269 notifications x 0.25 hours) and $1,768 (68 hours x $26.00) for underground 
coal operators and 10 hours (36 notifications x 0.25 hours) and $255 (10 hours x $25.45)

Review CPDM Plan - Proposed §§ 70.208(f)(4), 70.208(g)(4), 70.209(g)(4), 
71.207(k)(4), 71.207(n)(2), 90.209(e)(4) and 90.209(f)(4) 

 

183

Underground coal operators under proposed §§ 70.208(f)(3) and 90.209(e)(4) must 
review the adequacy of the approved CPDM Performance Plan and submit any necessary 
revisions when a valid end-of-shift equivalent concentration measurement meets or 
exceeds the applicable ECV or a weekly accumulated exposure exceeds the weekly 
permissible accumulated exposure.  Surface coal operators under proposed § 71.207(k)(4) 
must review the adequacy of the approved CPDM Performance Plan and submit any 
revisions upon issuance of a citation for violation of the applicable standard.  In addition, 
for underground coal operators (under proposed §§ 70.208(g)(4), 70.209(g)(4), and 
90.209(f)(4)) and surface coal operators (under proposed § 71.207(n)(2)) the CPDM plan 
must be reviewed when a valid end-of shift equivalent concentration measurement 
exceeds the applicable standard but is below the applicable ECV. 
As noted in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA does not project any additional citations for 
Part 90 miners and expects that surface operators would choose to use the gravimetric 
sampler.  Therefore, no costs were estimated for reviewing the CPDM plan due to the 
sampling results of either the Part 90 miners or the DWPs exceeding the applicable 
standard. MSHA estimates that an underground coal supervisor would take 15 minutes 
(0.25 hrs.) to review a CPDM plan. 
Year 2 
MSHA estimates that the number of CPDM plans to review would be 700 for 
underground coal operators. On average,  MSHA estimates that the burden and cost to 
submit corrective actions in the second year that the final rule is effective would be 
approximately 175 hours (700 reviews x 0.25 hours) and $14,823 (175 hours x $84.70). 
Year 3 
MSHA estimates that the number of CPDM plans to review in the third year would be 
282 for underground coal operators.  MSHA estimates that the burden and cost to submit 
corrective actions in the third year that the final rule is effective would be approximately 
71 hours (282 reviews x 0.25 hours) and $6,014 (71 hours x $84.70). 
L. Proposed § 72.100 Periodic Examinations 
Burden to Develop Periodic Examinations Plan 
Proposed § 72.100 (d) would require each coal operator to develop and submit to NIOSH 
a plan for providing miners with the required chest x-rays, spirometry, symptom 
assessment, and occupational history and a roster specifying the name and current 
address of each miner covered by the plan.  Proposed paragraph (e) would require the 
operator to post the approved plan on the mine bulletin board. 
Under Title 42, § 37.4, each operator of an underground coal mine is already required to 
submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a plan for providing miners with 
the required chest x-rays and to post it on the mine bulletin board.  NIOSH has required 
that rosters be provided since the early 1990s, so this requirement would not create an 
additional burden for mine operators. 
Year 1 
MSHA assumes that, in the first year of the proposed rule, underground coal operators 
would simply revise the existing rosters and plans for chest x-rays to add spirometry, 

 

184

424 Revisions x 0.167 hrs. = 71 hrs. 
424 Revisions x 0.083 hrs. = 35 hrs. 
Total burden hours = 106 hrs.

Total burden cost = $6,924 

symptom assessment, and occupational history.  MSHA estimates that it would take a 
supervisor, earning $84.70 an hour, ten minutes (0.167 hours) to revise the plan and 
roster and a clerical employee, earning $26.00 an hour, five minutes (0.0833 hours) to 
copy and submit the revised plan and roster.  Each surface coal operator would have to 
develop and submit to NIOSH a roster and plan for providing chest x-rays, spirometry, 
symptom assessment, and occupational history.  MSHA estimates that it would take a 
supervisor earning $69.98 an hour, one hour to develop the plan and roster and a clerical 
employee, earning $25.45 an hour 5 minutes (0.083 hours) to copy and submit the plan 
and roster.  MSHA estimates that there are 424 underground mines that would need 
revisions and 1,123 surface mines that will need to develop and submit plans and rosters.  
MSHA’s estimates of first-year burden and costs under proposed § 72.100 (d) and (e) are 
presented below.

Burden to Revise Plan in Years 2 and 3 
Since chest x-rays, spirometry, symptom assessment, and occupational history must be 
provided at least once every 5 years, MSHA assumes that each year one fifth of the mines 
would have to revise a plan and roster.  MSHA estimates that 84 underground mines and 
224 surface mines will need revisions.  MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor, 
earning $84.70 an hour in an underground coal mine or $69.98 an hour in a surface coal 
mine, ten minutes (0.167 hours) to revise the plan and roster and a clerical employee, 
earning $26.00 an hour in an underground coal mine or $25.45 an hour in a surface coal 
mine, five minutes (0.0833 hours) to copy and submit the revised plan and roster.  

1,123 hrs. x $69.98 wage rate = $78,588 
94 hrs. x $25.45 wage rate = $2,392 
Total burden cost = $80,980 

1,123 plans x 1 hr. = 1,123 hrs. 
1,123 plans x 0.083 hrs. = 94 hrs. 
Total burden hours = 1,217 hrs.

7 hrs. x $26.00 wage rate = $182 
Total burden cost = $1,368 

224 revisions x 0.167 hrs. = 37 hrs. 
224 revisions x 0.083 hrs. = 19 hrs. 
Total burden hours = 56 hrs.

CPDM Costs for Surface Mines 
Burden to Write and Submit CPDM Plans to MSHA for Approval 
Proposed §§ 71.206(a) and 90.206(b) would require operators who use CPDMs to 
develop and submit for approval a CPDM Performance Plan (Plan) prior to using them.  
The proposal specifies the information that would be required to be contained in the Plan 
and would establish Plan approval procedures. 
As discussed in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA assumes that no surface operator would 
choose to use the CPDM unless they have Part 90 miners. MSHA estimates that 200 
surface mines would have Part 90 miners and that each would need a CPDM plan.  In 
addition, MSHA estimate that 20 plans (10 percent) would have to be resubmitted before 
approval. On average, MSHA estimates that it takes a supervisor, earning $69.98 an hour, 
4 hours to write a proposed CPDM plan and a clerical employee, earning $25.45 an hour, 
15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and submit it.  MSHA’s estimates of the burden and cost 
to write, copy and submit a CPDM plan are presented below. 
      Burden Hours

Burden to Make Records for CPDM Training 
Proposed §§ 71.201(h) and 90.201(i) would require coal operators keep a record of 
miners who receive CPDM training.  As discussed in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA 
assumes that no surface operator would choose to use the CPDM unless they have Part 90 
miners.  MSHA estimates that 200 Part 90 miners at surface mines would receive CPDM 
training.  MSHA estimates that it takes a clerical employee 0.00833 hours (30 seconds) to 
make a record of each Part 90 miner who received CPDM training.  MSHA estimates that 
the annual burden and cost to make a record of CPDM training would be approximately 2 
hours (200 records x 0.00833 hours) and $51 (2 hours x $25.45). 
Burden to Notify and Provide to the Representative of Miners CPDM Plans Submitted to 
MSHA for Approval 
Proposed § 71.206(a)(1) would require that a copy of the CPDM plan be provided to the 
representative of the miners, if requested, and proposed § 71.206(c)(1) would require a 
copy of any revision be provided as well. MSHA assumes that no surface operator would 
use CPDMs for anyone except Part 90 miners. Since surface operators do not have to 
provide a copy of Part 90 CPDM plans to the representative of the miners, MSHA 
assumes that there is no burden or cost to surface operators for these two provisions. 
Burden to Post and Provide a Copy of the CPDM Plans to the Part 90 Miners 
Proposed § 71.206(a)(3) would require a copy of the CPDM performance plan to be 
posted and § 90.206(d) would require that the Part 90 miners be given a copy of the 
CPDM plan.  As discussed in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA assumes that no plans 
would be posted because no surface operator would choose to use the CPDM unless they 
have Part 90 miners.  MSHA estimates that a clerical employee would take 5 minutes 
(0.083 hours) to copy and provide the plan to a Part 90 miner.  MSHA estimates that 
there are 200 Part 90 miners who would receive a copy of the CPDM plan. MSHA 
estimates that the first year burden and cost to provide the plan to all Part 90 miners 
would be approximately 17 hours (200 plans x 0.0833 hours) and $433 (17 hours x 
$25.45). 
Burden to Revise and Submit Revisions to Approved CPDM Plans 
MSHA anticipates that revisions to approved CPDM plans would occur from situations 
that develop as a result of proposed §§ 71.206(c), 71.206(d), 90.206(b), 90.206(e), 
90.209(e)(4) and 90.209(f)(4).  MSHA estimates that approximately 49 surface mines 
(25 percent) with Part 90 miners would make revisions to approved CPDM plans each 
year. On average, MSHA estimates that a supervisor takes 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to 
revise an approved plan and a clerical employee takes 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy

 Burden to Provide the Part 90 Miners with a Copy of the Revised CPDM Plans 
Proposed § 71.206(c)(3) would require a copy of the CPDM performance plan revisions 
to be posted and § 90.206(d) would require that the Part 90 miners be given a copy of the 
CPDM plan revisions.  As discussed in Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA assumes that no 
plans would be posted because no surface operator would choose to use the CPDM unless 
they have Part 90 miners. On average, MSHA estimates that a clerical employee takes 
15 minutes (0.25 hours) to copy and provide the plan to the Part 90 miners.  MSHA 
estimates that there are 49 Part 90 miners who would receive a copy of the revised 
CPDM plan. MSHA estimates that the second year and subsequent years burden hours 
and cost to provide the revised plan to Part 90 miners would be approximately 12 hours 
(49 plans x 0.25) and $305 (12 hours x $25.45). 
Burden to Validate, Certify, and Transmit Electronically CPDM Data to MSHA 
Proposed §§ 71.208(f) and 90.210(f) would require that, within 12 hours after the end of 
the last sampling shift of the work week, a designated mine official must validate, certify, 
and transmit electronically to MSHA all daily sample and error data file information 
collected during the previous calendar week and stored in the CPDM.   As discussed in 
Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA assumes that since no surface operator would choose to 
use the CPDM unless they have Part 90 miners. 
MSHA estimates that validating, certifying, and uploading the CPDM data from a CPDM 
to a computer and then transmitting it electronically to MSHA takes a designated mine 
official, earning a supervisor’s wage of $69.98, 6 minutes (0.1 hours) per CPDM per 
week.  The number of CPDMs is equal to the number of Part 90 miners.  MSHA is 
assuming 50 weeks per year for all mine sizes. MSHA estimates that the annual burden 
and cost to validate, certify, and transmit electronically to MSHA all daily sample and 
error data file information would be approximately 1,000 hours (200 CPDMs x 50 weeks 
x 0.1 hours) and $69,980 (1,000 hours x $69.98). 
Burden to Validate, Certify, and Post CPDM Sampling Information 
Proposed §§ 71.209(c) and 90.211(c) would require operators to post certain sampling 
information and provided it to Part 90 miners.  This information is included on the dust 
data card that can be printed from the CPDM, with the exception of the information 
concerning the shift length and the total amount of exposure accumulated by the sampled 

 

188

occupation during the shift.  MSHA assumes that the information not included on the 
dust data card printout would be written down on the dust data card printout. 
Proposed §§ 71.209(c) and 90.201(f) would require the operator to make a record 
showing the length of each shift for each DWP and Part 90 miner.  As discussed in 
Chapter V of the PREA, MSHA assumes that no surface operator would choose to use 
the CPDM unless they have Part 90 miners; therefore, the shift lengths of the DWPs 
would not have to be recorded.  The shift lengths of the 200 Part 90 miners would have to 
be recorded every time the CPDM is used. 
A new CPDM filter is used every time a CPDM is used to sample, and a dust data card 
printout is generated after the sample is taken.  The number of dust data card printouts to 
be completed and posted equals the number of CPDM filters used. MSHA estimates that 
miners are working 5 days per week for 50 weeks or 250 days a year.  MSHA estimates 
that a supervisor, earning $69.98 an hour, would take 3 minutes (0.05 hours) to do the 
functions described above. MSHA estimates that the annual burden and cost to make a 
record for the length of each shift for each Part 90 miner would be approximately 2,500 
hours (200 Part 90 miners x 250 days x 0.05 hours) and $174,950 (2,500 hours x $69.98). 
N. Proposed §§ 70.212 and 71.210 Change in Status Report 
Burden to Change Status Report 
Proposed §§ 70.212(c) and 71.210(c) are new and would require the mine operator to 
report status changes that affect the operational readiness of any CPDM unit.  Since the 
CPDM is a new technology, MSHA has no basis upon which to estimate the number of 
times this would occur.  However, this requirement should represent a minimal burden 
since the reporting can be done electronically and the mines using the CPDM would all 
have computers (in order to download and transmit the CPDM sampling data) to do the 
reporting.  MSHA has assessed one burden hour for this provision at a cost of $84.70, the 
supervisor’s wage rate for underground mines, where the preponderance of the CPDMs 
would be used. 
O. Proposed § 71.207(c) Listing DWPs 
Estimated Burden for Listing the DWPs 
Proposed § 71.207(c) would require mine operators to provide the district manager with a 
list identifying the specific work positions where DWP samples would be collected.  
MSHA estimates that it would take a supervisor 5 minutes (0.0833 hours) to prepare the 
list.  The supervisor’s wage rate is $84.70 at underground mines and $69.98 at surface 
mines.  A clerical employee would take 5 minutes (0.0833 hours) to type the list and mail 
it to MSHA.  The clerical wage is $26.00 at underground mines and $25.45 at surface 
mines. 
First Year Costs 
In the first year the number of lists would be equal to the number of surface areas at 
underground mines plus the number of surface mines and facilities. 
Surface Areas at Underground Mines 
MSHA estimates that there are 32 surface areas at underground mines. MSHA’s estimate 
of the first year burden and cost to underground mines is presented below.

mines and facilities revising the list to account for changes in their operations.

Proposed § 72.700 Respiratory Equipment; Respirable Dust 
Burden to Make a Record of Respiratory Training 
Proposed §§ 72.700 (c) would require coal operators to make a record after completion of 
the respirator training.  MSHA estimates that 11,047 underground miners would need the 
training annually.   For surface mines, the number of miners needing the training due to a 
violation of the standard equals the estimated number of violations projected for the 
DWPs.  MSHA increased this estimate by 5 percent to account for the times when the 
result exceeded the standard but did not exceed the ECV.   The number of miners to be 
trained in surface coal mines would vary according to the estimated number of violations, 
80 miners in the first year, 62 miners in the second year, and 38 miners in the third year. 
MSHA estimates that it would take a clerical employee, earning $26.00 an hour in an 
underground coal mine or $25.45 an hour in a surface mine, thirty seconds (0.00833 
hours) per trainee to make a record of respirator training.  MSHA’s estimates of the 
burden hours and costs are presented below.

Proposed § 75.362 On-Shift Examinations 
Burden to make a record of the examinations results and have them verified and 
countersigned 
Burden to make a record of examinations 
In order to ensure compliance with the respirable dust control parameters specified in the 
mine ventilation plan proposed § 75.362(a)(2) would require that the person conducting 
the examination at underground mines also record the results of the examination and 
corrective actions taken at the end of each shift for each MMU.  MSHA estimates that a 
supervisory person, earning $84.70 per hour, would take 3 minutes (0.05 hours) to make 
a record of the examination for the average mine in all mine sizes. 
Based upon the number of shifts operated at each mine size, MSHA estimates that the 
examination for 547,650 shifts would have to be recorded each year. MSHA estimates 
that underground coal operators annual burden hours and cost to record the results of on-
shift examinations are approximately 27,383 hours (547,650 records x 0.05 hours per 
record) and $2,319,340 (27,383 hours x $84.70). 
Burden to certify examination by initials, date, and time at examination location 
Proposed § 75.362(g)(2)(i) would require that the proposed § 75.362(a)(2) record be 
certified by initials, date and time on a board maintained at the section load-out or similar 
location showing that the examination was made prior to resuming production. The 
certified person directing the on shift examination would do the certification. This 
proposed standard does not add any new burdens or costs and is already being done under 
existing § 75.362(g)(1) and § 75.362(g)(2). 
Burden to have the record verified and countersigned 
Proposed § 75.362(g)(2)(ii) would require that the proposed § 75.362(a)(2) record be 
verified by initials and date for compliance with the respirable dust control parameters 
specified in the mine ventilation plan. Verification would have to be made no later than 
the end of the shift for which the examination was made. Proposed § 75.362(g)(3) would 

 

192

require that the mine foreman or equivalent official countersign each examination record 
under proposed § 75.362(a)(2) after it is verified by the certified person directing the 
examination under proposed § 75.362 (g)(2)(ii). MSHA estimates that:  it takes 1 minute 
(0.0167 hours) to verify the record by a certified person earning $84.70 per hour ; and 
another 1 minute (0.0167 hours) to review and countersign the record by a mine foreman 
or equivalent mine official earning $84.70 per hour.  MSHA estimates that underground 
coal operators annual burden hours and costs to verify and countersign the proposed 
§ 75.362(a)(2) record are approximately 18,292 hours (547,650 records x 0.0334 hours) 
and $3,098,582 (18,292 hours x $84.70).

IX. SUMMARY OF ESTIMATED BENEFITS AND COSTS 

This section presents a summary of estimated benefits and costs of the proposed 
rule for informational purposes only. Under the Mine Act, MSHA is not required to use 
estimated net benefits as the basis for its decision.  MSHA’s estimates suggest, however, 
that net benefits are positive, with estimated annualized benefits ranging from $99 to 
$197 million and estimated annualized costs ranging from $40 to $44 million.  The 
estimates of costs and benefits are only roughly comparable due to both limitations in the 
data and different underlying assumptions. 

 
The annualized dollar value of the benefits MSHA estimated range from a low of 
$99 million per year for only two provisions of the proposed rule and an assumption of a 
10 year latency period at a discount rate of 7% to a high of $197 million per year for four 
of the provisions of the rule and an assumption of no latency. These estimates are both 
incomplete and highly uncertain because they do not include the potential impacts of 
other provisions of the proposed rule and because MSHA does not have the data 
necessary to either a) calculate benefits to those with historical exposures and pre-
existing conditions or b) estimate how long into the future it will be until the benefits of 
this regulation might begin to accrue.  With respect to the latter, the comparison of 
benefits streams from assuming no latency to assuming a ten-year latency highlights the 
degree of uncertainty.  While an estimate of no latency is unrealistic, so are the implicit 
assumptions that there would be no benefits of the provisions that were not included and 
no benefits would accrue to those with significant historical exposures.  Thus, these 
estimates encompass a significant amount of uncertainty.  MSHA requests comments on 
methods to both improve the comprehensiveness of the benefits estimates and better 
characterize timing of the stream of benefits.

The annualized costs MSHA estimated range from $40.4 to $44.5 million.  The 

lower value represents MSHA’s most likely estimate.  The higher value includes 
additional costs for those rare instances where some operators of underground mines may 
encounter implementation issues as they attempt to comply with the proposed 
requirements and may need to take additional measures to comply with the proposed

The range of benefits and costs estimated by MSHA do not correspond to the 

same assumptions: the benefit range corresponds to changes in assumptions about latency 
periods while the cost range corresponds to assumptions about whether some mines may 
incur additional costs.  Thus, the probability that the benefits will be at the high end of 
the benefit distribution is entirely independent of the probability that the costs will be at 
the high end of the cost distribution.  A comparison of benefits and costs, therefore, 
encompasses a broad range of independent assumptions.   

standard.   MSHA requests comments on the cost estimates and solicits information on 
data sources to better characterize the cost range.
