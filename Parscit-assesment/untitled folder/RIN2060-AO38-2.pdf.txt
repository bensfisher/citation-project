CHAPTER 3  Emission Inventory 
3.1  Introduction 

  Ships (i.e., ocean-going vessels) are significant contributors to the total United States 
(U.S.) mobile source emission inventory.  The U.S. ship inventory reported here focuses on 
Category 3 (C3) vessels, which use C3 engines for propulsion.  C3 engines are defined as having 
displacement above 30 liters per cylinder (L/cyl).  The resulting inventory includes emissions 
from both propulsion and auxiliary engines used on these vessels, as well as those on gas and 
steam turbine vessels. 

 Most of the vessels operating in U.S. ports that have propulsion engines less than 30 

liters per cylinder are domestic and are already subject to strict national standards affecting NOX, 
PM, and fuel sulfur content.  As such, the inventory does not include any ships, foreign or 
domestic, powered by Category 1 or Category 2 (i.e., <30 L/cyl) engines.  In addition, as 
discussed in Sections 3.3.2.5 and 3.3.3.2, this inventory is primarily based on activity data for 
ships that carry foreign cargo.  Category 3 vessels carrying domestic cargo that operate only 
between U.S. ports are only partially accounted for in this inventory.1  Emissions due to military 
vessels are also excluded. 

 The regional and national inventories for C3 vessels presented in this chapter are sums of 

independently constructed port and interport emissions inventories.  Port inventories were 
developed for 89 deep water and 28 Great Lake ports in the U.S.2  While there are more than 117 
ports in the U.S., these are the top U.S. ports in terms of cargo tonnage.  Port-specific emissions 
were calculated with a “bottom-up” approach, using data for vessel calls, emission factors, and 
activity for each port.  Interport emissions were obtained using the Waterway Network Ship 
Traffic, Energy and Environment Model (STEEM).3,4  STEEM also uses a “bottom-up” 
approach, estimating emissions from C3 vessels using historical North American shipping 
activity, ship characteristics, and activity-based emission factors.  STEEM was used to quantify 
and geographically (i.e., spatially) represent interport vessel traffic and emissions for vessels 
traveling within 200 nautical miles (nm) of the U.S. 

 The detailed port inventories were spatially merged into the STEEM gridded inventory to 

create a comprehensive inventory for Category 3 vessels.  For the 117 ports, this involved 
removing the near-port portion of the STEEM inventory and replacing it with the detailed port 
inventories.  For the remaining U.S. ports for which detailed port inventories are not available, 
the near-port portion of the STEEM inventory was simply retained.  This was done for a base 
year of 2002.  Inventories for 2020 were then projected using regional growth rates5,6 and 
adjustment factors to account for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier 1 and Tier 
2 NOX standards and NOX retrofit program.2  Inventories incorporating additional Tier 3 NOX 
and fuel sulfur controls within the proposed Emission Control Area (ECA) were also developed 
for 2020 and 2030. 

 This chapter details the methodologies used to create the baseline and future year 

inventories and presents the resulting inventories for the U.S.  Section 3.2 describes the modeling 
domain and geographic regions used in this analysis.  Section 3.3 describes the methodology and 

3-2 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

results for the 2002 base year inventory.  Section 3.4 follows with a discussion of the growth 
rates and methodology used to create the 2020 and 2030 baseline and control inventories.  
Section 3.5 presents the estimated contribution of Category 3 vessels to U.S. national and local 
inventories.    Section 3.6 follows with estimates of the projected emission reductions due to the 
proposed control program.  Section 3.7 concludes the chapter by describing the changes in the 
inventories between the baseline scenarios used for the air quality modeling and the updated 
baseline scenarios in this proposed rule. 

 The inventory estimates reported in this chapter include emissions out to 200 nm from 

the U.S. coastline, including Alaska and Hawaii, but not extending into the Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ) of neighboring countries.  Inventories are presented for the following pollutants: 
oxides of nitrogen (NOX), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2).  The PM inventories 
include directly emitted PM only, although secondary sulfates are taken into account in the air 
quality modeling. 
3.2  Modeling Domain and Geographic Regions 

The inventories described in this chapter reflect ship operations that occur within the area 

that extends 200 nautical miles (nm) from the official U.S. baseline, which is recognized as the 
low-water line along the coast as marked on the official U.S. nautical charts in accordance with 
the articles of the Law of the Sea.  This boundary is roughly equivalent to the border of the U.S 
Exclusive Economic Zone.  The U.S. region was then clipped to the boundaries of the U.S. 
Exclusive Economic Zone.  The boundary was divided into regions using geographic 
information system (GIS) shapefiles obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, Office of Coast Survey.7  The accuracy of the NOAA shapefiles was verified 
with images obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey.  The confirmed NOAA shapefiles were 
then combined with a shapefile of the U.S. international border from the National Atlas.8 

 The resulting region was further subdivided for this analysis to create regions that were 

compatible with the geographic scope of the regional growth rates, which are used to project 
emission inventories for the years 2020 and 2030, as described later in this document. 

•  The Pacific Coast region was split into separate North Pacific and South Pacific regions 
along a horizontal line originating from the Washington/Oregon border (Latitude 46° 15’ 
North). 

•  The East Coast and Gulf of Mexico regions were divided along a vertical line roughly 

drawn through Key Largo (Longitude 80° 26’ West). 

•  The Alaska region was divided into separate Alaska Southeast and Alaska West regions 
along a straight line intersecting the cities of Naknek and Kodiak.  The Alaska Southeast 
region includes most of the State’s population, and the Alaska West region includes the 
emissions from ships on a great circle route along the Aleutian Islands between Asia and 
the U.S. West Coast.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

•  For the Great Lakes domain, a similar approach was used to create shapefiles containing 
all the ports and inland waterways in the near port inventory and extending out into the 
lakes to the international border with Canada.  The modeling domain spanned from Lake 
Superior on the west to the point eastward in the State of New York where the St. 
Lawrence River parts from U.S. soil. 

•  The Hawaiian domain was subdivided so that a distance of 200 nm beyond the 

southeastern islands of Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, Molokai, Niihau, Kauai, Lanai, and 
Kahoolawe was contained in Hawaii East.  The remainder of the Hawaiian Region was 
then designated Hawaii West.  
 

This methodology resulted in nine separate regional modeling domains that are identified 

below and shown in Figure 3-1.  U.S. territories are not included in this analysis.

3.3  Development of 2002 Baseline Inventory 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

This section describes the methodology and inputs, and presents the resulting inventories 
for the 2002 baseline calendar year.  The first section describes the general methodology.  The 
second section describes the methodology, inputs, and results for near port emissions.  The third 
section describes the methodology and inputs for emissions when operating away from port (also 
referred to as “interport” emissions).  The fourth section describes the method for merging the 
interport and near port portions of the inventory.  Resulting total emissions for the U.S., as well 
as for nine geographic regions within the U.S., are then presented. 

3.3.1 Outline of Methodology 

 The total inventory was created by summing emissions estimates for ships while at port 

(near port inventories) and while underway (interport inventories).  Near port inventories for 
calendar year 2002 were developed for 117 U.S. commercial ports that engage in foreign trade.  
Based on an ICF International analysis,9 these 117 commercial ports encompass nearly all U.S. 
C3 vessel calls.10 

The outer boundaries of the ports are defined as 25 nm from the terminus of the reduced 
speed zone for deep water ports and 7 nm from the terminus of the reduced speed zone for Great 
Lake ports.  Port emissions are calculated for different modes of operation and then summed.  
Emissions for each mode are calculated using port-specific information for vessel calls, vessel 
characteristics, and activity, as well as other inputs that vary instead by vessel or engine type 
(e.g., emission factors). 

 The interport inventory was estimated using the Waterway Network Ship Traffic, Energy, 
and Environmental Model (STEEM).3,4  The model geographically characterizes emissions from 
ships traveling along shipping lanes to and from individual ports, in addition to the emissions 
from vessels transiting near the ports.  The shipping lanes were identified from actual ship 
positioning reports.  The model then uses detailed information about ship destinations, ship 
attributes (e.g., vessel speed and engine horsepower), and emission factors to produce spatially 
allocated (i.e., gridded) emission estimates for ships engaged in foreign commerce. 

 The 117 near port inventories are an improvement upon STEEM’s near port results in 

several ways.  First, the precision associated with STEEM’s use of ship positioning data may be 
less accurate in some locations, especially as the lanes approach shorelines where ships would 
need to follow more prescribed paths.  Second, the STEEM model includes a maneuvering 
operational mode (i.e., reduced speed) that is generally assumed to occur for the first and last 20 
kilometers of each trip when a ship is leaving or entering a port.  In reality, the distance when a 
ship is traveling at reduced speeds varies by port.  Also, the distance a ship traverses at reduced 
speeds often consists of two operational modes:  a reduced speed zone (RSZ) as a ship enters or 
leaves the port area and actual maneuvering at a very low speed near the dock.  Third, the 
STEEM model assumes that the maneuvering distance occurs at an engine load of 20 percent, 
which represents a vessel speed of approximately 60 percent of cruise speed.  This is 
considerably faster than ships would maneuver near the docks.  The single maneuvering speed 
assumed by STEEM also does not reflect the fact that the reduced speed zone, and therefore 
emissions, may vary by port.  Fourth, and finally, the STEEM model does not include the 

3-5 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

emissions from auxiliary engines during hotelling operations at the port.  The near-port 
inventories correct these issues. 

 The regional emission inventories produced by the current STEEM interport model are 

most accurate for vessels while cruising in ocean or Great Lakes shipping lanes, and the near 
port inventories, which use more detailed local port information, are significantly more accurate 
near the ports.   Therefore, the inventories in this analysis are derived by merging together:  (1) 
the near port inventories, which extend 25 nautical miles and 7 nautical miles from the terminus 
of the RSZ for deep water ports and Great Lake ports, respectively, and (2) the remaining 
interport portion of the STEEM inventory, which extends from the endpoint of the near port 
inventories to the 200 nautical mile boundary or international border with Canada, as 
appropriate.  Near some ports, a portion of the underlying STEEM emissions were retained if it 
was determined that the STEEM emissions included ships traversing the area near a port, but not 
actually entering or exiting the port. 

3.3.2 Near Port Emissions 

 Near port inventories for calendar year 2002 were developed for ocean-going vessels at 
89 deep water and 28 Great Lake ports in the U.S.  The inventories include emissions from both 
propulsion and auxiliary engines on these vessels. 

 This section first describes the selection of the ports for analysis and then provides the 

methodology used to develop the near port inventories.  This is followed by a description of the 
key inputs.  Total emissions by port and pollutant for 2002 are then presented.  The work 
summarized here was conducted by ICF International under contract to EPA.2  The ICF 
documentation provides more detailed information.2 

3.3.2.1  Selection of Individual Ports to be Analyzed 

 All 150 deep sea and Great Lake ports in the Principal Ports of the United States dataset11 
were used as a starting point.  Thirty ports which had no foreign traffic were eliminated because 
there is no information in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) entrances and clearances 
data about domestic traffic. (See Section 3.3.2.5 for a further discussion of domestic traffic and 
how it is accounted for in this study).  In addition, two U.S. Territory ports in Puerto Rico were 
removed as these were outside the area of interest for this study.  Several California ports were 
added to the principle ports list because ARB provided the necessary data and estimates for those 
ports.  This is discussed in Section 3.3.2.4.1.  Also, a conglomerate port in the Puget Sound area 
was added as discussed in Section 3.3.2.4.2.  The final list of 117 deep sea and Great Lake ports, 
along with their coordinates, is given in the Appendix, Table 3-102. 

3.3.2.2  Port Methodology 

 Near port emissions for each port are calculated for four modes of operation: (1) 
hotelling, (2) maneuvering, (3) reduced speed zone (RSZ), and (4) cruise.  Hotelling, or 
dwelling, occurs while the vessel is docked or anchored near a dock, and only the auxiliary 
engine(s) are being used to provide power to meet the ship’s energy needs.  Maneuvering occurs 
within a very short distance of the docks.  The RSZ varies from port to port, though generally the 

3-6 

RSZ would begin and end when the pilots board or disembark, and typically occurs when the 
near port shipping lanes reach unconstrained ocean shipping lanes.  The cruise mode emissions 
in the near ports analysis extend 25 nautical miles beyond the end of the RSZ lanes for deep 
water ports and 7 nautical miles for Great Lake ports.

Main engine load factors are calculated directly from the propeller curve based upon the 
cube of actual speed divided by maximum speed (at 100% maximum continuous rating [MCR]).  
In addition, cruise mode activity is based on cruise distance and speed inputs.  The following 
sections provide the specific equations used to calculate propulsion and auxiliary emissions for 
each activity mode. 

3.3.2.2.1  Cruise

Since cruise speed is estimated at 94 percent of maximum speed12, the load factor for 

main engines at cruise is 0.83. 

 Substituting Equation 3-3 for time in cruise into Equation 3-2, and using the load factor 
of 0.83, the equation used to calculate cruise mode emissions for the main engines becomes the

The inputs of calls, cruise distance, and vessel speed are the same for main and auxiliary 
engines.  Relative to the main engines, auxiliary engines have separate inputs for engine power, 
load factor, and emission factors.  The activity-related inputs, such as engine power, vessel 
speed, and calls, can be unique to each ship calling on a port, if ship-specific information is 
available.  For this analysis, as discussed in Section 3.3.2.3.1.1, these inputs were developed by 
port for bins that varied by ship type, engine type, and dead weight tonnage (DWT) range. 

3.3.2.2.2  Reduced Speed Zone

 Emission factors are considered to be relatively constant down to about 20 percent load.  

Below that threshold, emission factors tend to increase significantly as the load decreases.  
During the RSZ mode, load factors can fall below 20 percent.  Low load multiplicative 
adjustment factors were developed and applied when the load falls below 20 percent (0.20).  If 
the load factor is 0.20 or greater, the low load adjustment factor is set to 1.0.

 Unlike main engines, there is no need for a low load adjustment factor for auxiliary 

engines, because of the way they are generally operated.  When only low loads are needed, one 
or more engines are shut off, allowing the remaining engines to maintain operation at a more 
efficient level. 

 The inputs of calls, RSZ distance, and RSZ speed are the same for main and auxiliary 

engines.  Relative to the main engines, auxiliary engines have separate inputs for engine power, 
load factor, and emission factors.  The RSZ distances vary by port rather than vessel or engine 
type.  Some RSZ speeds vary by ship type, while others vary by DWT.  Mostly, however, RSZ 
speed is constant for all ships entering the harbor area.  All Great Lake ports have reduced speed 
zone distances of three nautical miles occurring at halfway between cruise speed and 
maneuvering speed. 

3.3.2.2.3  Maneuvering 

 Maneuvering emissions are calculated for both propulsion (main) and auxiliary engines.

 Maneuvering time-in-mode is estimated based on the distance a ship travels from the 
breakwater or port entrance to the pier/wharf/dock (PWD).  Maneuvering times also include 
shifts from one PWD to another or from one port within a greater port area to another.  Average

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

maneuvering speeds vary from 3 to 8 knots depending on direction and ship type.  For 
consistency, maneuvering speeds were assumed to be the dead slow setting of approximately 5.8 
knots. 

Load factor during maneuvering is calculated as follows:

Also, the maneuvering speed is 5.8 knots.  Substituting Equation 3-16 into Equation 3-15, and 
using a maneuvering speed of 5.8 knots, the equation to calculate load factor becomes:

Since the load factor during maneuvering usually falls below 20 percent, low load 

adjustment factors are also applied accordingly.  Maneuvering times are not readily available for 
all 117 ports.  For this analysis, maneuvering times and load factors available for a subset of the 
ports were used to calculate maneuvering emissions for the remaining ports.  This is discussed in 
more detail in Section 3.3.2.3.8.

 Hotelling times are not readily available for all 117 ports.  For this analysis, hotelling 

times available for a subset of the ports were used to calculate hotelling emissions for the 
remaining ports.  This is discussed in more detail in Section 3.3.2.3.8. 

3.3.2.3  Inputs for Port Emission Calculations 

 From a review of the equations described in Section 3.3.2.2, the following inputs are 

required to calculate emissions for the four modes of operation (cruise, RSZ, maneuvering, and 
hotelling): 

3-13 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 

 

•  Number of calls 
•  Main engine power 
•  Cruise (vessel service) speed 
•  Cruise distance 
•  RSZ distance for each port 
•  RSZ speed for each port 
•  Auxiliary engine power 
•  Auxiliary load factors 
•  Main and auxiliary emission factors 
•  Low load adjustment factors for main engines 
•  Maneuvering time-in-mode (hours/call) 
•  Hotelling time-in-mode (hours/call) 

Note that load factors for main engines are not listed explicitly, since they are calculated 

as a function of mode and/or cruise speed.  This section describes the inputs in more detail, as 
well as the sources for each input. 

3.3.2.3.1  Calls and Ship Characteristics (Propulsion Engine Power and Cruise Speed) 

 For this analysis, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) entrance and clearance data 
for 2002,13 together with Lloyd’s data for ship characteristics,14 were used to calculate average 
ship characteristics and calls by ship type for each port.  Information for number of calls, 
propulsion engine power, and cruise speed were obtained from these data. 

3.3.2.3.1.1  Bins by Ship Type, Engine Type, and DWT Range 

The records from the USACE entrances and clearances data base were matched with 

Lloyd’s data on ship characteristics for each port.  Calls by vessels that have either Category 1 or 
2 propulsion engines were eliminated from the data set.  The data was then binned by ship type, 
engine type and dead weight tonnage (DWT) range.  The number of entrances and clearances in 
each bin are counted, summed together and divided by two to determine the number of calls (i.e., 
one entrance and one clearance was considered a call).  For Great Lake ports, there is a larger 
frequency of ships either entering the port loaded and leaving unloaded (light) or entering the 
port light and leaving loaded.  In these cases, there would only be one record (the loaded trip into 
or out of the port) that would be present in the data.  For Great Lake ports, clearances were 
matched with entrances by ship name.  If there was not a reasonable match, the orphan entrance 
or clearance was treated as a call. 
 

Propulsion power and vessel cruise speed are also averaged for each bin.  While each port 

is analyzed separately, the various bins and national average ship characteristics are given in 
Table 3-1 for deep sea ports and Table 3-2 for Great Lake ports.  Auxiliary engine power was 
computed from the average propulsion power using the auxiliary power to propulsion power 
ratios discussed in Section 3.3.2.3.4.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 

3.3.2.3.1.2  Removal of Category 1 and 2 Ships 

 Since these inventories were intended to cover ships with Category 3 propulsion engines 

only, the ships with Category 1 and 2 propulsion engines were eliminated.  This was 
accomplished by matching all ship calls with information from Lloyd’s Data, which is produced 
by Lloyd’s Register-Fairplay Ltd.14  Over 99.9 percent of the calls in the entrances and 
clearances data were directly matched with Lloyd’s data.  The remaining 0.1 percent was 
estimated based upon ships of similar type and size. 
 

 Engine category was determined from engine make and model.  Engine bore and stroke 
were found in the Marine Engine 2005 Guide15 and displacement per cylinder was calculated.  
Ships with Category 1 or 2 propulsion engines were eliminated from the data. 
 

Many passenger ships and tankers have either diesel-electric or gas turbine-electric 
engines that are used for both propulsion and auxiliary purposes.  Both were included in the 
current inventory. 

3.3.2.3.1.3  Treatment of Electric-Drive Ships 

 Many passenger ships and tankers have either diesel-electric or gas turbine-electric 
engines that are used for both propulsion and auxiliary purposes.  Both were included in the 
current inventory. 
 

Lloyds clearly calls out these types of engines in their database and that information was 
used to distinguish them from direct and geared drive systems.  Generally the power Lloyds lists 
is the total power.  To separate out propulsion from auxiliary power for purposes of calculating 
emissions, the total power listed in the Lloyds data was divided by 1 plus the ratio of auxiliary to 
propulsion power (given in Table 3-3) to obtain the propulsion power portion of the total.  The 
remaining portion was considered auxiliary engine power.  In addition, no low load adjustment 
factor was applied to diesel and gas turbine electric engines for loads below 20 percent MCR 
because several engines are used to generate power, and some can be shut down to allow others 
to operate at a more efficient setting. 

3.3.2.3.2  Cruise Distance 

 Cruise mode emissions are calculated assuming a 25 nautical mile distance into and out 
of the port for deep sea ports and 7 nautical miles into and out of the port for Great Lake ports 
outside of the reduced speed and maneuvering zones. 

3.3.2.3.3  RSZ Distances and Speeds by Port 

 Reduced speed zone (RSZ) distance and speed were determined for each port.   For deep 

sea ports, the RSZ distances were developed from shipping lane information contained in the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Waterway Network.16  The NWN is a geographic 
database of navigable waterways in and around the U.S.  The database defines waterways as 
links or line segments that, for the purposes of this study, represent actual shipping lanes (i.e., 

3-20 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

channels, intracoastal waterways, sea lanes, and rivers).  The geographic locations of the 
waterways that were directly associated with each of the 117 ports were viewed using geographic 
information system computer software.  The sea-side endpoint for the RSZ was selected as the 
point along the line segment that was judged to be far enough into the ocean where ship 
movements were unconstrained by the coastline or other vessel traffic.  These RSZ sea-side 
endpoints typically coincided with estimates provided by the pilots for the major ports as 
reported in earlier work.  The resulting RSZ distance was then measured for each deep sea port.  
The final RSZ distances and endpoints for each port are listed in the Appendix, Table 3-103.  
The RSZ for each Great Lake port was fixed at three nautical miles, as previously discussed in 
Section 3.3.2.2.2. 
 

 The RSZ speeds were primarily taken from previous studies by ICF17,18 or from an 
ENVIRON report19 based upon discussions with pilots.  A few of the RSZ speeds were also 
modified based upon newer information obtained from conversations with pilots.  The final RSZ 
speeds for each port are listed in the Appendix, Table 3-103.  The RSZ speeds for the Great Lake 
ports vary by vessel type and are the average of the vessel service speed and the maneuvering 
speed. 

3.3.2.3.4  Auxiliary Engine Power and Load Factors 

Since hotelling emissions are a large part of port inventories, it is important to distinguish 

propulsion engine emissions from auxiliary engine emissions.  In the methodology used in this 
analysis, auxiliary engine maximum continuous rating power and load factors were calculated 
separately from propulsion engines and different emission factors (EFs) applied.  All auxiliary 
engines were treated as Category 2 medium-speed diesel (MSD) engines for purposes of this 
analysis. 
 

 Auxiliary engine power is not contained in the USACE database and is only sparsely 

populated in the Lloyd’s database; as a result, it must be estimated.  The approach taken was to 
derive ratios of average auxiliary engine power to propulsion power based on survey data.  The 
California Air Resources Board (ARB) conducted an Oceangoing Ship Survey of 327 ships in 
January 2005 that was principally used for this analysis.20  Average auxiliary engine power to 
propulsion power ratios were estimated by ship type and are presented in Table 3-3.  These ratios 
by ship type were applied to the propulsion power data to derive auxiliary power for the ship 
types at each port.

 Load factors for auxiliary engines vary by ship type and operating mode.  It was 

previously thought that power generation was provided by propulsion engines in all modes but 
hotelling.  Starcrest’s Vessel Boarding Program12 showed that auxiliary engines are on all of the 
time, except when using shoreside power during hotelling.   Table 3-4 shows the auxiliary engine 
load factors by ship type determined by Starcrest, through interviews conducted with ship 
captains, chief engineers, and pilots during its vessel boarding programs.  Auxiliary load factors 
were used in conjunction with total auxiliary power.  Auxiliary load factors listed in Table 3-4 
are used together with the total auxiliary engine power (determined from total propulsion power 
and the ratios from Table 3-3) to calculate auxiliary engine emissions.

3.3.2.3.5  Fuel Types and Fuel Sulfur Levels 

 There are primarily three types of fuel used by marine engines: residual marine (RM), 
marine diesel oil (MDO), and marine gas oil (MGO), with varying levels of fuel sulfur.5  MDO 
and MGO are generally described as distillate fuels. For this analysis, RM and MDO fuels are 
assumed to be used.  Since PM and SO2 emission factors are dependent on the fuel sulfur level, 
calculation of port inventories requires information about the fuel sulfur levels associated with 
each fuel type, as well as which fuel types are used by propulsion and auxiliary engines. 
 

An ARB survey20 found that almost all ships used RM in their main propulsion engines, 

and that only 29 percent of all ships (except passenger ships) used distillate in their auxiliary 
engines, with the remaining 71 percent using RM.  However, only 8 percent of passenger ships 
used distillate in their auxiliary engines, while the other 92 percent used RM.  We used the 
results of this survey as reasonable approximations for calculations of emission factors.  
However, their accuracy for years other than those of the ARB survey may be affected by fuel 
prices, since as fuel prices increase, more ships will use RM in their auxiliary engines.   
 

 Based on the ARB survey, average fuel sulfur level for residual marine was set to 2.5 
percent for the west coast and 2.7 percent for the rest of the country.  A sulfur content of 1.5 
percent was used for MDO.21  While a more realistic value for MDO used in the U.S. appears to 
be 0.4 percent, given the small proportion of distillate fuel used by ships relative to RM, the 
difference should not be significant.  Sulfur levels in other areas of the world can be significantly 
higher for RM.  Table 3-5 provides the assumed mix of fuel types used for propulsion and 
auxiliary engines by ship type.

3.3.2.3.6  Propulsion and Auxiliary Engine Emission Factors 

 An analysis of emission data was prepared and published in 2002 by Entec.21  The 

resulting Entec emission factors include individual factors for three speeds of diesel engines 
(slow-speed diesel (SSD), medium-speed diesel (MSD), and high-speed diesel (HSD)), steam 
turbines (ST), gas turbines (GT), and two types of fuel used here (RM and MDO).  Table 3-6 
lists the propulsion engine emission factors for NOX and HC that were used for the 2002 port 
inventory development.  The CO, PM, SO2 and CO2 emission factors shown in the table come 
from other data sources as explained below.

 CO emission factors were developed from information provided in the Entec appendices 
because they are not explicitly stated in the text. .  HC and CO emission factors were confirmed 
with a recent EPA review.22 
 

 PM10 values were determined by EPA based on existing engine test data in consultation 
with ARB.23  GT PM10 emission factors were not part of the EPA analysis but assumed here to 
be equivalent to ST PM10 emission factors.  Test data shows PM10 emission rates as dependent 
upon fuel sulfur levels, with base PM10 emission rates of 0.23 g/kw-hr with distillate fuel (0.24% 
sulfur) and 1.35 g/kw-hr with residual fuel (2.46% sulfur).24  The equation used to generate 
emission factors based on sulfur content is shown below.  

 

Equation 3-21 Calculation of PM10 Emission Factors Based on Fuel Sulfur Levels 

PMEF = PMNom + [(SAct – SNom) × BSFC × FSC × MWR × 0.0001] 

 Where: 
  PMEF  = PM emission factor adjusted for fuel sulfur 
  PMNom = PM emission rate at nominal fuel sulfur level 
   = 0.23 g/kW-hr for distillate fuel, 1.35 g/kW-hr for residual fuel 

3-24 

  SAct = Actual fuel sulfur level (weight percent) 
  SNom = nominal fuel sulfur level (weight percent) 
   = 0.24 for distillate fuel, 2.46 for residual fuel 
  BSFC = fuel consumption in g/kW-hr 

= 200 g/kW-hr used for this analysis 

  FSC = percentage of sulfur in fuel that is converted to direct sulfate PM 
   = 2.247% used for this analysis 
  MWR = molecular weight ratio of sulfate PM to sulfur 

= 224/32 = 7 used for this analysis 

 
The PM10 to PM2.5 conversion factor used here is 0.92.  While the NONROAD model 

uses 0.97 for such conversion based upon low sulfur fuels, a reasonable value seems to be closer 
to 0.92 because higher sulfur fuels in medium and slow speed engines would tend to produce 
larger particulates than high speed engines on low sulfur fuels. 
 

 SO2 emission factors were based upon a fuel sulfur to SO2 conversion formula which was 
supplied by ENVIRON.25  Emission factors for SO2 emissions were calculated using the formula 
assuming that 97.753 percent of the fuel sulfur was converted to SO2.26 The brake specific fuel 
consumption (BSFC)A that was used for SSDs was 195 g/kWh, while the BSFC that was used 
for MSDs was 210 g/kWh based upon Lloyds 1995.  The BSFC that was used for STs and GTs 
was 305 g/kWh based upon Entec.21  
 

Equation 3-22 Calculation of SO2 Emission Factors, g/kWh 

SO2 EF = BSFC x 2 x 0.97753 x Fuel Sulfur Fraction 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 

 

 CO2 emission factors were calculated from the BSFC assuming a fuel carbon content of 

86.7 percent by weight21 and a ratio of molecular weights of CO2 and C at 3.667. 
 

Equation 3-23 Calculation of CO2 Emission Factors, g/kWh 

CO2 EF = BSFC x 3.667 x 0.867 

Fuel consumption was calculated from CO2 emissions based on a 1:3.183 ratio.  3.183 

tons of CO2 emissions are assumed produced from one metric ton of fuel.   

 The most current set of auxiliary engine emission factors comes from Entec except as 

noted below.  Table 3-7 provides these auxiliary engine emission factors.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 It should be noted that Entec used 2.7 percent fuel sulfur content for RM, and 1.0 percent 
for MDO which is consistent with the RM assumptions made in this analysis for other than West 
Coast ports.  For MDO, there is a slight discrepancy between the 1.0 percent used by Entec 
versus the 1.5 percent estimate used for this analysis.  SO2 emission factors were calculated 
based upon the assumed sulfur levels and the methodology suggested by ENVIRON25 while PM 
emissions were determined by EPA based on existing engine test data in consultation with 
ARB.23 
 

 Using the ratios of RM versus MDO use determined by the ARB study20 as given in 

Table 3-5 together with the emission factors shown in Table 3-7, the auxiliary engine emission 
factor averages by ship type are listed in Table 3-8.  As discussed above, this fuel sulfur level 
may be too high for the U.S.  However, we do not believe this emission factor has a significant 
effect on the total emission inventory estimates. 
 

If the fuel sulfur level for MDO is correctly adjusted from 1.5 percent to 1.0 percent, the 
effect on SO2 emissions is still less than 7 percent, due to the high percentage of RM fuel used in 
auxiliary engines.  The difference for PM is within the round off error of the emission factor.

3.3.2.3.7  Low Load Adjustment Factors for Propulsion Engines 

 Emission factors are considered to be constant down to about 20 percent load.  Below 

that threshold, emission factors tend to increase as the load decreases.  This trend results because 
diesel engines are less efficient at low loads and the BSFC tends to increase.  Thus, while mass 
emissions (grams per hour) decrease with low loads, the engine power tends to decrease more 
quickly, thereby increasing the emission factor (grams per engine power) as load decreases.  
Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA) demonstrated this effect in a study prepared for 
EPA in 2000.27  In the EEA report, various equations have been developed for the various 
emissions.  The low-load emission factor adjustment factors were developed based upon the 
concept that the BSFC increases as load decreases below about 20 percent load.  For fuel 
consumption, EEA developed the following equation: 
 

Equation 3-24 

Fuel Consumption (g/kWh) = 14.1205 (1/Fractional Load) + 205.7169 

 
In addition, based upon test data, they developed algorithms to calculate emission factors 

at reduced load.  These equations are noted below: 
 

 

3-26 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 

Equation 3-25 

Emission Rate (g/kWh) = a (Fractional Load)-x + b 

For SO2 emissions, however, EEA developed a slightly different equation: 
 

Emission Rate (g/kWh) = a (Fuel Consumption x Fuel Sulfur Fraction) + b 

Equation 3-26 

The coefficients for the above equations are given in Table 3-9 below.

 The underlying database used to calculate these coefficients includes primarily tests on 

engines rated below 10,000 kW, using diesel fuel.  This introduces uncertainty regarding the use 
of these coefficients for Category 3 engines using residual fuel; however, these are the best 
estimates currently available. 
 

 Using these algorithms, fuel consumption and emission factors versus load were 

calculated.  By normalizing these emission factors to 20% load, the low-load multiplicative 
adjustment factors presented in Table 3-10 are calculated.  SO2 adjustment factors were 
calculated using 2.7% sulfur.  The SO2 multiplicative adjustment factors at 2.5 percent sulfur are 
not significantly different.

 There is no need for a low load adjustment factor for auxiliary engines, because they are 
generally operated in banks.  When only low loads are needed, one or more engines are shut off, 
allowing the remaining engines to operate at an efficient level. 

3.3.2.3.8  Use of Detailed Typical Port Data for Other Inputs 

 There is currently not enough information to readily calculate time-in-mode (hours/call) 

for all 117 ports during the maneuvering and hotelling modes of operation.  As a result, it was 
necessary to review and select available detailed emission inventories that have been estimated 
for selected ports to date.  These ports are referred to as typical ports.  The typical port 
information for maneuvering and hotelling time-in-mode (as well as maneuvering load factors 
for the propulsion engines) was then used for the typical ports and also assigned to the other 
modeled ports.  A modeled port is the port in which emissions are to be estimated.  The 
methodology that was used to select the typical ports and match these ports to the other modeled 
ports is briefly described in this section, and more fully described in the ICF documentation.2 

3.3.2.3.8.1  Selection of Typical Ports 

 In 1999, EPA published two guidance documents17,18 to calculate marine vessel activity 
at ports.  These documents contained detailed port inventories of eight deep sea ports, two Great 

3-28 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 
Lake ports and two inland river ports.  The detailed inventories were developed by obtaining ship 
call data from Marine Exchanges/Port Authorities (MEPA) at the various ports for 1996 and 
matching the various ship calls to data from Lloyds Maritime Information Services to provide 
ship characteristics.  The ports for which detailed inventories were developed are shown in Table 
3-11 for deep sea ports and Table 3-12 for Great Lake ports along with the level of detail of 
shifts for each port.  Most ports provided the ship name, Lloyd’s number, the vessel type, the 
date and time the vessel entered and left the port, and the vessel flag. Inland river ports were 
developed from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Waterborne Commerce Statistics 
Center data.

 Since 1999, several new detailed emissions inventories have been developed and were 

reviewed for use as additional or replacement typical ports:  These included: 

•  Port of Los Angeles12,28 
•  Puget Sound Ports29 
•  Port of New York/New Jersey30 
•  Port of Houston/Galveston31 
•  Port of Beaumont/Port Arthur32 
•  Port of Corpus Christi33 
•  Port of Portland34 
•  Ports of Cleveland, OH and Duluth-Superior, MN&WI35 
 

 Based on the review of these newer studies, some of the previous typical ports were 

replaced with newer data and an additional typical port was added.  Data developed for 
Cleveland and Duluth-Superior for LADCO was used in lieu of the previous typical port data for 
Cleveland and Burns Harbor because it provided more detailed information and better engine 
category definitions.  The Port of Houston/Galveston inventory provided enough data to add an 
additional typical port.  All three port inventories were adjusted to reflect the current 
methodology used in this study. 
 

 The information provided in the current inventory for Puget Sound Ports29 was used to 

calculate RSZ speeds, load factors, and times for all Puget Sound ports.  As described in Section 
3.3.2.4.2, an additional modeled port was also added to account for the considerable amount of 
Jones Act tanker ship activity in the Puget Sound area that is not contained in the original 
inventory. 
 

 The newer Port of New York/New Jersey inventory provided a check against estimates 

made using the 1996 data.  All other new inventory information was found to lack sufficient 
detail to prepare the detailed typical port inventories needed for this project. 
 

 The final list of nine deep sea and two Great Lake typical ports used in this analysis and 

their data year is as follows: 

•  Lower Mississippi River Ports [1996]

•  Ports on the Patapsco River [1996] 
•  Port of Coos Bay, OR [1996] 
•  Port of Tampa, FL [1996] 
•  Port of Cleveland, OH on Lake Erie [2005] 
•  Duluth-Superior, MN & WI on Lake Michigan [2005] 

 

 The maneuvering and hotelling time-in-modes, as well as the maneuvering load factors 
for these typical ports, were binned by ship type, engine type, and DWT type, using the same 
bins described in Section 3.3.2.3.1.1. 

3.3.2.3.8.2  Matching Typical Ports to Modeled Ports 

 The next step in the process was to match the ports to be modeled with the typical port 

which was most like it.  Three criteria were used for matching a given port to a typical port: 
regional differences,B maximum vessel draft, and the ship types that call on a specific port.  One 
container port, for instance, may have much smaller bulk cargo and reefer ships number of calls 
on that port than another.  Using these three criteria and the eleven typical ports that are suitable 
for port matching, the 89 deep sea ports and 28 Great Lake ports were matched to the typical 
ports.  For a typical port, the modeled and typical port is the same (i.e., the port simply represents 
itself).  For California ports, we used data provided by ARB as discussed in Section 3.3.2.4.  The 
matched ports for the deep sea ports are provided in Table 3-13.

 Once a modeled port was matched to a typical port, the maneuvering and hotelling time-
in-mode values, as well as the maneuvering load factors by bin for the typical ports, were used 
directly for the modeled ports, with no adjustments.  The other inputs used for both the typical 
and modeled ports are as described in Section 3.3.2.3. 

3-34 

3.3.2.3.8.3  Bin Mismatches 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 In some cases, the specific DWT range bin at the modeled port was not in the typical like 
port data.  In those cases, the next nearest DWT range bin was used for the calculations.  In a few 
cases, the engine type for a given ship type might not be in the typical like port data.  In these 
cases, the closest engine type at the typical like port was used.  Also in a few cases, a specific 
ship type in the modeled port data was not in the typical like port data.  In this case, the nearest 
like ship type at the typical port was chosen to calculate emissions at the modeled port. 

3.3.2.4  Stand Alone Ports 

 In a few cases, the USACE entrances and clearances data was not used to calculate 

emissions at the modeled port.  These include the California ports for which we received data 
from ARB, the Port of Valdez, Alaska, and a conglomerate port within the Puget Sound area, as 
described below. 

3.3.2.4.1  California Ports 

 The California Air Resources Board (ARB) supplied inventories for 14 California ports 

for 2002.  The data received from ARB for the California ports were modified to provide 
consistent PM and SO2 emissions to those calculated in this report.  In addition, cruise and RSZ 
emissions were calculated directly based upon average ship power provided in the ARB 
methodology document36 and number of calls, because ARB did not calculate cruise emissions, 
and transit (RSZ) emissions were allocated to counties instead of ports.  ARB provided transit 
distances for each port to calculate the RSZ emissions.  Ship propulsion and auxiliary engine 
power were calculated based upon the methodology in Section 3.3.2.3.1.3 for use in computing 
cruise and RSZ emissions.  For maneuvering and hotelling emissions, the ARB values were used 
and adjusted as discussed below.  The data supplied by ARB included domestic traffic as well as 
foreign cargo traffic. 
 

 For PM emission calculations, ARB used an emission factor of 1.5 g/kWh to calculate 

total PM emissions and factors of 0.96 and 0.937 to convert total PM to PM10 and PM2.5 
respectively.  Since an emission factor of 1.4 g/kWh was used in our calculations for PM10 and 
an emission factor of 1.3 g/kWh for PM2.5, ARB PM10 and PM2.5 emissions were multiplied by 
factors of 0.972 and 0.925, respectively to get consistent PM10 and PM2.5 emissions for 
propulsion engines. 
 

 For auxiliary engines, ARB used the same emission factors as above, while we used 

PM10 and PM2.5 emission factors of 1.3 and 1.2 g/kWh, respectively for passenger ships and 1.1 
and 1.0 g/kWh, respectively for all other ships.  In the ARB inventory, all passenger ships are 
treated as electric drive and all emissions are allocated to auxiliary engines.  ARB auxiliary 
engine emissions were thus multiplied by factors of 0.903 and 0.854 respectively for passenger 
ships and 0.764 and 0.711 respectively for other ships to provide consistent PM emission 
calculations. 
 

3-35 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 SO2 emissions were also different between the ARB and these analyses.  ARB used a 
compositeC propulsion engine SO2 emission factor of 10.55 g/kWh while we used a composite 
SO2 emission factor of 9.57 g/kWh.  Thus, ARB SO2 propulsion emissions were multiplied by a 
factor of 0.907 to be consistent with our emission calculations.  For auxiliary engines, ARB used 
SO2 emission factors of 11.48 and 9.34 g/kWh, respectively for passenger and other ships, while 
we use emission factors of 9.93 and 9.07 g/kWh, respectively.  Thus, ARB auxiliary SO2 
emissions were multiplied by factors of 0.865 and 0.971, respectively for passenger and other 
ships to provide consistent SO2 emissions. 

3.3.2.4.2  Port in Puget Sound 

 In the newest Puget Sound inventory29, it was found that a considerable amount of tanker 
ships stop at Cherry Point, Ferndale, March Point and other areas which are not within the top 89 
U.S. deep sea ports analyzed in this analysis.  In addition, since they are ships carrying U.S. 
cargo (oil from Alaska) from one U.S. port to another, they are not documented in the USACE 
entrances and clearances data.  To compensate for this anomaly, an additional port was added 
which encompassed these tanker ships stopping within the Puget Sound area but not at one of the 
Puget Sound ports analyzed in this analysis.  Ship calls in the 1996 typical port data to ports 
other than those in the top 89 U.S. deep sea ports were analyzed separately.  There were 363 ship 
calls by tankers to those areas in 1996.  In the inventory report for 2005, there were 468 calls.  
For 2002, it was estimated there were 432 calls.  The same ship types and ship characteristics 
were used as in the 1996 data, but the number of calls was proportionally increased to 432 calls 
to represent these ships.  The location of the “Other Puget Sound” port was approximately at 
Cherry Point near Aberdeen. 

3.3.2.4.3  Port of Valdez 

 In a recent Alaska port inventory,37 it was found that significant Category 3 domestic 

tanker traffic enters and leaves the Port of Valdez on destination to West Coast ports.  Since the 
USACE entrances and clearances data did not contain any tanker calls at Valdez in 2002, the 
recent Alaska inventory data was used to calculate emissions at that port.  In this case, the 
number of calls and ship characteristics for 2002 were taken directly from the Alaska inventory 
and used in determining emissions for the modeled port with the Puget Sound area typical port 
being used as the like port. 

3.3.2.5  Domestic Traffic 

 One of the concerns with using USACE entrances and clearances data is that it only 

contains foreign cargo movements moved by either a foreign flag vessel or a U.S. flag vessel.  
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) maintains the Foreign Traffic Vessel Entrances and 
Clearances database, which contains statistics on U.S. foreign maritime trade.  Data are compiled 
during the regular processing of statistics on foreign imports and exports.  The database contains 
information on the type of vessel, commodities, weight, customs districts and ports, and origins 
and destinations of goods.  Thus domestic traffic, i.e., U.S. ships delivering cargo from one U.S. 
                                                 
C Based upon ARB assuming 95 percent of the engines were SSD and 5 percent were MSD. The composite SO2 EF 
of 9.57 g/kW-hr was calculated using this weighting, along with the SSD and MSD SO2 EFs for the West Coast 
ports reported in Table 3-6. 

3-36 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 
port to another U.S. port, is covered under the Jones Act and is not accounted for in the database.  
However, U.S. flagged ships carrying cargo from a foreign port to a U.S. port or from a U.S. port 
to a foreign port are accounted for in the USACE entrances and clearances database, as these are 
considered foreign cargo movements. 
 

Under the Jones Act, domestic cargo movements from one U.S. port to another U.S. port 
must be carried by a U.S. flag ship.  The Jones Act also requires ships traveling between United 
States ports to be constructed by United States companies and owned by a United States 
company or citizen. Members of the ships’ crews must be United States citizens or legal aliens.   
Because of the use of USACE data, in the present baseline and future year inventories, only 
limited Jones Act ships were counted.  These ships included those servicing California ports, 
those serving the Port of Valdez and those serving other Puget Sound ports.  At all other ports, 
Jones Act ships were not counted. 
 

ICF conducted an analysis to estimate the amount of Category 3 Jones Act ships calling 

at the 117 U.S. ports.  This was done by analyzing marine exchange data obtained from port 
authorities for eleven typical ports and using this information to estimate the Jones Act ship 
contribution for the remaining ports.  Based on this limited analysis, Jones Act ships are 
estimated to account for 9.2% of the total installed power calling on U.S. ports.  Approximately 
30% of these ships, largely in the Alaska and Pacific regions, have been included in the 2002 
baseline inventory.  Based on this analysis, Jones Act ships excluded from this inventory 
constitute roughly 6.5% of total installed power.38  This results in an underestimation of the port 
ship inventory and therefore the benefits of the coordinated program reported in this chapter are 
also underestimated. 

3.3.2.6  2002 Near Port Inventories 

 This section presents a summary of the baseline near port inventories for 2002.  

Individual port inventories are presented separately for deep sea ports and Great Lake ports 
because of the difference in ship types between the two.  This is followed by totals for the 
summed port inventories, provided by engine type (propulsion and auxiliary), mode of operation, 
and ship type. 

3.3.2.6.1  Deep Sea Ports 

 Emission inventories for the 89 deep sea ports are presented here.  Total emissions 

(propulsion and auxiliary) by ports are given in Table 3-15.  Auxiliary only emissions by ports 
are given in Table 3-16.  Emissions by mode are given in Table 3-17 for cruise, Table 3-18 for 
reduced speed zone, Table 3-19 for maneuvering, and Table 3-20 for hotelling.  Emissions by 
ship type by port are given in Table 3-21 through Table 3-31.  Ports that are missing from those 
lists had no emissions related to that ship type during 2002. 
 

 For deep sea ports, auxiliary emissions are responsible for roughly 47% of the NOX and 

PM emissions, primarily due to emissions during the hotelling mode.  Container and Tanker 
ships combined are responsible for approximately half the total emissions, followed by 
Passenger ships and Bulk Carrier ships.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

3.3.2.6.2  Great Lake Ports 

 Emissions inventories for 28 Great Lake ports were developed and are presented here.  
Great Lake ships include self-unloading bulk carriers (Bulk Carrier, SU) which tend to operate 
within the Great Lakes only.  Other ships travel down the St. Lawrence River from the open 
ocean.  Integrated tug-barges (ITB) are also used on the Great Lakes. 
 

 Total emissions by port for Great Lakes Ports are shown in Table 3-32.  Auxiliary engine 

emissions for Great Lake ports are shown in Table 3-33.  Emissions by mode for Great Lake 
ports are shown in Table 3-34 for cruise, Table 3-35 for reduced speed zone, Table 3-36 for 
maneuvering, and Table 3-37 for hotelling.  Emissions by ship type are shown in Table 3-38 
through Table 3-42.

3.3.2.6.3  Summary 

 For Great Lake ports, auxiliary emissions are responsible for roughly 50% of the NOX 

and PM emissions, primarily due to emissions during the hotelling mode.  Bulk Carrier ships are 
responsible for the vast majority of the emissions. 

 This section provides a summary of the total port emissions for 2002.  Table 3-43 and 

Table 3-44 provide a breakout of the total port emissions by auxiliary and propulsion engines, in 
units of metric tonnes and short tons, respectively.  Table 3-45 and Table 3-46 provide the 
breakout by mode of operation, while Table 3-47 and Table 3-48 provide a summary of port 
emissions by ship type. 
 

 Auxiliary emissions at ports are responsible for 39-48% of the total inventory, depending 
on the pollutant.  Hotelling, cruise, and RSZ modes of operation are all important contributors to 
emissions.  Container and Tanker ships are the largest contributors to port emissions.

3.3.3 Interport Emissions 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 This section presents our nationwide analysis of the methodology and inputs used to 
estimate interport emissions from main propulsion and auxiliary engines used by Category 3 
ocean-going vessels for the 2002 calendar year.  The modeling domain for vessels operating in 
the ocean extends from the U.S. coastline to a 200 nautical mile boundary.  For ships operating 
in the Great Lakes, it extends out to the international boundary with Canada.  The emission 
results are divided into nine geographic regions of the U.S. (including Alaska and Hawaii), and 
then totaled to provide a national inventory. 
 

 The interport emissions described in this section represent total interport emissions prior 
to any adjustments made to incorporate near-port inventories.  The approach used to replace the 
near-port portion of the interport emissions is provided in Section 3.3.3.3.  The final adjusted 
interport emissions are provided in Section 3.3.4. 

3.3.3.1  Methodology 

 The interport emissions were estimated using the Waterway Network Ship Traffic, 

Energy, and Environmental Model (STEEM).3,4  STEEM was developed by the University of 
Delaware as a comprehensive approach to quantify and geographically represent interport ship 
traffic, emissions, and energy consumption from large vessels calling on U.S. ports or transiting 
the U.S. coastline to other destinations, and shipping activity in Canada and Mexico.  The model 
estimates emissions from main propulsion and auxiliary marine engines used on Category 3 
vessels that engage in foreign commerce using historical North American shipping activity, ship 
attributes (i.e., characteristics), and activity-based emission factor information.  These inputs are 
assembled using a geographic information system (GIS) platform that also contains an 
empirically derived network of shipping lanes.  It includes the emissions for all ship operational 
modes from cruise in unconstrained shipping lanes to maneuvering in a port.  The model, 
however, excludes hotelling operations while the vessel is docked or anchored, and very low 
speed maneuvering close to a dock.  For that reason, STEEM is referred to as an “interport” 
model, to easily distinguish it from the near ports analysis. 
 

 STEEM uses advanced ArcGIS tools and develops emission inventories in the following 
way.39  The model begins by building a spatially-defined waterway network based on empirical 
shipping location information from two global ship reporting databases.  The first is the 
International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), which contains reports on 
marine surface and atmospheric conditions from the Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) fleet.  
There are approximately 4,000 vessels worldwide in the VOS system.  The ICOADS project is 
sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Science 
Foundation's National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The second database is the 
Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue (AMVER) system.  The AMVER data set is based 
on a ship search and rescue reporting network sponsored by the U.S. Coast Guard.  The AMVER 
system is also voluntary, but is generally limited to ships over 1,000 gross tons on voyages of 24 
hours or longer.  About 8,600 vessels reported to AMVER in 2004. 
 

3-79 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 The latitude and longitude coordinates for the ship reports in the above databases are 

used to statistically create and spatially define the direction and width of each shipping lane in 
the waterway network.  Each statistical lane (route and segment) is given a unique identification 
number for computational purposes.  For the current analysis, STEEM used 20 years of ICOADS 
data (1983-2002) and about one year of AMVER data (part of 2004 and part of 2005) (Figure 
3-2). 

 

 Every major ocean and Great Lake port is also spatially located in the waterway network 

using ArcGIS software.  For the U.S., the latitude and longitude for each port is taken from the 
USACE report on vessel entrances and clearances.13  There are 251 U.S. ports in the USACE 
entrances and clearances report.  Each port also has a unique identification number for 
computational purposes. 

Figure 3-2 AMVER and ICOADS data

 As illustrated in Figure 3-3, the waterway network represented by STEEM resembles a 

highway network on land.  It is composed of ports, which are origins and destinations of 
shipping routes: junctions where shipping routes intersect, and segments that are shipping lanes 
between two connected junctions.  Each segment can have only two junctions or ports, and ship 
traffic flow can enter and leave a segment only through a junction or at a port.  The figure 
represents only a sample of the many routes contained in the model.

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 

Figure 3-3 Illustration of STEEM Modeling Domain and Spatial Distribution of Shipping Lanes 

 

 
 

 
 

 Every major ocean and Great Lake port is also spatially located in the waterway network 

using ArcGIS software.  For the U.S., the latitude and longitude for each port is taken from the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report on vessel entrances and clearances (subsequently referred 
to as USACE).13  There are 251 U.S. ports in the entrances and clearances report.  Each port also 
has a unique identification number for computational purposes. 
 

 The STEEM interport model also employs a number of databases to identify the 

movements for each vessel (e.g., trips), individual ship attributes (e.g., vessel size and 
horsepower), and related emission factor information (e.g., emission rates) that are subsequently 
used in the inventory calculations. 
 

 Once the waterway network and various databases are constructed, STEEM uses ArcGIS 

Network Analyst tools along with specific information on each individual ship movement to 
solve the most probable path on the network between each pair of ports (i.e., a trip) for a certain 
ship size.  This is assumed to represent the least-energy path, which in most cases is the shortest 
distance unless prevented by weather or sea conditions, water depth, channel width, navigational 
regulations, or other constraints that are beyond the model’s capability to forecast. 
 

 After identifying the shipping route and resulting distance associated with each unique 

trip, the emissions are simply calculated for each operational mode using the following 
generalized equation along with information from the ship attributes and emission factor 
databases: 
 

Emissions per trip = distance (nautical miles) / speed (nautical miles/hour) x 

horsepower (kW) x fractional load factor x emission 
factor (g/kW-hour) 

3-81 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 
 In STEEM, emissions are calculated separately for distances representing cruise and 
maneuvering operational modes.  Maneuvering occurs at slower speeds and load factors than 
during cruise conditions.  In STEEM, maneuvering is assumed to occur for the first and last 20 
kilometers of each trip when a ship is entering or leaving a port.  A ship is assumed to move at 
maneuvering speed for an entire trip if the distance is less than 20 kilometers. 
 

 Finally, the emissions along each shipping route (i.e., segment) for all trips are 

proportioned among the respective cells that are represented by the gridded modeling domain.  
For this work, emissions estimates were produced at a cell resolution of 4 kilometers by 4 
kilometers, which is appropriate for most atmospheric air quality models. The results for each 
cell are then summed, as appropriate, to produce emission inventories for the various geographic 
regions of interest in this analysis. 

3.3.3.1.1  Emission Inputs 

 The STEEM waterway network model relies on a number of inputs to identify the 

movements for each vessel, individual ship attributes, and related emission factor information.  
Each of these databases is described separately below. 

3.3.3.1.1.1  Shipping Movements 

 The shipping activity and routes database provides information on vessel movements or 
trips.  It is developed using port entrances and clearances information from the USACE report 
for the U.S. and the Lloyd’s Maritime Intelligence Unit (LMIU) for Canada and Mexico.40  
These sources contain information for each vessel carrying foreign cargo at each major port or 
waterway that, most importantly for this analysis, includes: 
 

•  Vessel name 
•  Last port of call (entrance record) or next port of call (clearance record) 

 The database then establishes unique identification numbers for each ship, each port pair, 

and each resulting trip. 

3.3.3.1.1.2  Ship Attributes 

 

 

 The ship attributes data set contains the important characteristics of each ship that are 

necessary for the STEEM interport model to calculate the emissions associated with each trip.  
The information in this data set is matched to each previously assigned ship identification 
number.  The following information comes from the USACE entrances and clearances report for 
each ship identification number: 
 

•  Ship type 
•  Gross registered tonnage (GRT) 
•  Net registered tonnage (NRT) 

3-82 

 The ship attributes data set contains the following information from Lloyd’s Register-

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

Fairplay for each ship identification number.14  
 

•  Main propulsion engine installed power (horsepower) 
•  Service speed (cruise speed) 
•  Ship size (length, wide, and draft) 

 Sometimes data was lacking from the above references for ship speed.  In these instances, 

the missing information was developed for each of nine vessel types and the appropriate value 
was applied to each individual ship of that type.  Specifically, the missing ship speeds for each 
ship category were obtained from the average speeds used in a Lloyd’s Register study of the 
Baltic Sea and from an Entec UK Limited study for the European Commission.41,21  The 
resulting vessel cruise speeds for ships with missing data are shown in Table 3-49.

 The average speed during maneuvering is approximately 60 percent of a ship’s cruise 
speed based on using the propeller law described in Section 3.3.2 above and the engine load 
factor for maneuvering that is presented later in this section. 
 

 As with vessel cruise speed, main engine installed power was sometimes lacking in the 
Lloyd’s Register-Fairplay data set.  Here again, the missing information was developed for nine 
different vessel types and the appropriate value was applied to each individual ship of that type 
when the data were lacking.  In this case, the missing main engine horsepower was estimated by 
regressing the relationships between GRT and NRT, and between installed power and GRT for 
each category.  This operation is performed internally in the model and the result applied to each 
individual ship, as appropriate. 
 

 The ship attributes database also contains information on the installed power of engines 
used for auxiliary purposes.  However, this information is usually lacking in the Lloyds data set, 
so an alternative technique was employed to estimate the required values.  In short, the STEEM 
model uses a ratio of main engine horsepower to auxiliary engine horsepower that was 
determined for eight different vessel types using information primarily from ICF International.42

(The ICF report attributed these power values to a study for the Port of Los Angeles by Starcrest 
Consulting.12)  The auxiliary engine power for each individual vessel of a given ship type is then 
estimated by multiplying the appropriate main power to auxiliary power ratio and the main 
engine horsepower rating for that individual ship.  The main and auxiliary power values and the 
resulting auxiliary engine to main engine ratios are shown in Table 3-50.

c  The STEEM purportedly used values for Roll On-Roll Off main and auxiliary engines that 
represent a trip weighted average of the Auto Carrier and Cruise Ship power values from the ICF 
reference. 

 

 Finally, the ship attributes database provides information on the load factors for main 

engines during cruise and maneuvering operation, in addition to load factors for auxiliary marine 
engines.  Main engine load factors for cruise operation were taken from a study of international 
shipping for all ship types, except passenger vessels.43  For this analysis, the STEEM model used 
a propulsion engine load factor for passenger ship engines at cruise speed of 55 percent of the 
total installed power.  This is based on engine manufacturer data contained in two global 
shipping studies.43,44   During maneuvering, it was assumed that all main engines, including 
those for passenger ships, operate at 20 percent of the installed power.  This is consistent with a 
study done by Entec UK for the European Commission.21  The main engine load factors at cruise 
speed by ship type are shown in Table 3-51. 
 

 Auxiliary engine load factors, except for passenger ships, were obtained from the ICF 
International study referenced above.  These values are also shown in Table 3-51.   For cruise 
mode, neither port nor interport portions of the inventory were adjusted for low load operation, 
as the low load adjustments are only applied to propulsion engines with load factors below 20%.

3.3.3.1.1.3  Emission Factor Information 

 The emission factor data set contains emission rates for the various pollutants in terms of 
grams of pollutant per kilowatt-hour (g/kW-hr).  The main engine emission factors are shown in 
Table 3-52 .  The speed specific factors for NOX, HC, and SO2 were taken from several recent 
analyses of ship emissions in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. 21,36,42,43, 45  The PM factor was 
based on discussions with the California Air Resources Board (ARB) staff.  The fuel specific CO 
emission factor was taken from a report by ENVIRON International.19  The STEEM study used 
the composite emission factors shown in the table because the voyage data used in the model do 
not explicitly identify main engine speed ratings, i.e., slow or medium, or the auxiliary engine 
fuel type, i.e., marine distillate or residual marine.  The composite factor for each pollutant is 
determined by weighting individual emission factors by vessel engine population data from a 
2005 survey of ocean-going vessels that was performed by ARB.20  Fuel consumption was 
calculated from CO2 emissions using the same ratio (1:3.183) as used in the near-port analysis.

The emission factors for auxiliary engines are shown in Table 3-53.  The fuel specific

from Entec and Corbett and Koehler.21,43

 As for main engines, the STEEM study used the composite emission factors for auxiliary 

engines.  For all pollutants other than SO2, underlying data used in the model do not explicitly 
identify auxiliary engine voyages by fuel type, i.e., marine distillate or residual marine.  Again, 
the composite factor for those pollutants was determined by weighting individual emission 
factors by vessel engine population data from a 2005 survey of ocean-going vessels that was 
performed by ARB.20 
 

 For SO2, composite emission factors for auxiliary engines were calculated for each vessel 
type.  These composite factors were determined by taking the fuel specific emission factors from 
Table 3-53 and weighting them with an estimate of the amount of marine distillate and residual 
marine that is used by these engines.  The relative amount of each fuel type consumed was taken 
from the 2005 ARB survey.  The relative amounts of each fuel type for each vessel type and the 
resulting SO2 emission factors are shown in Table 3-54.

3.3.3.1.1.4  EPA Adjustments to STEEM PM and SO2 Emission Inventories 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 The interport emission results contained in this study for PM10 and SO2 were taken from 
the STEEM inventories and then adjusted to reflect EPA’s recent review of available engine test 
data and fuel sulfur levels as described Section 3.3.2.3 for the near port analysis.  In the near 
ports work, a PM emission factor of 1.4 g/kW-hr was used for most main engines, e.g., slow 
speed diesel and medium speed diesel engines, all of which are assumed to use residual marine.  
A slightly higher value was used for steam turbine and gas turbine engines, and a slightly lower 
value was used for most auxiliary engines.  However, these engines represent only a small 
fraction of the total emissions inventory.  As shown in Section 3.3.3.1.1.3, the STEEM study 
used an emission factor of 1.5 g/kW-hr for all main engines and a slightly lower value for 
auxiliary engines.  Here again, the auxiliary engines comprise only a small fraction of the total 
emissions from these ships.  Therefore, for simplicity, EPA adjusted the interport PM inventories 
by multiplying the STEEM results by the ratio of the two primary emission factors, i.e., 1.4/1.5 
or 0.933, to approximate the difference in fuel effects. 
 

 The STEEM SO2 emission inventories were similarly adjusted using SO2 emission 
factors from the interport analysis (Section 3.3.3.1.1.3) and the near ports analysis (Section 
3.3.2.3).  This information is displayed in Table 3-55.  The composite values in the table are 
calculated by mathematically weighting the slow speed and medium speed emission factors from 
each study by their individual population fraction from the 2005 ARB shipping survey, i.e., 95 
percent and 5 percent, respectively.20  Therefore, the interport SO2 inventories that appear in this 
report are the result of multiplying the STEEM inventories by the ratio of the two composite 
g/kW-hr emission factors shown in table, i.e., 10.33 /10.6 or 0.975.

3.3.3.2  Interport Domestic Traffic 

 As previously noted, STEEM includes the emissions associated with ships that are 

engaged in foreign commerce.  As a result, U.S.-flagged vessels carrying domestic cargo (Jones 
Act ships) are not included.  The STEEM interport analysis also roughly estimated the emissions 
associated with these ships that are engaged solely in domestic commerce.1,4  Specifically, the 
interport analysis estimated that the large ocean-going vessels carrying only domestic cargo 
excluded from STEEM represent approximately 2-3 percent of the total U.S. emissions.

3-87 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 

In Section 3.3.2.5, in the estimation of port inventories, the estimate of excluded installed 

power was roughly 6.5 percent.  It is not inconsistent that the STEEM estimate of excluded 
emissions is lower than the excluded power estimated from calls to U.S. ports, since the STEEM 
model includes ships that are transiting without stopping at U.S. ports.  Since most of the Jones 
Act ships tend to travel closer along the coast line, most of the Jones Act ship traffic is expected 
to fall within the proposed ECA.  Therefore, the results presented in this chapter are expected to 
underpredict the benefits of the proposed ECA. 

3.3.3.3  Combining the Near Port and Interport Inventories 

 The national and regional inventories in this study are a combination of the results from 
the near ports analysis described in Section 3.3.2 and the STEEM interport modeling described 
in this section.  The two inventories are quite different in form.  As previously presented in 
Figure 3-1, the STEEM modeling domain spans the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the northern 
hemisphere.  The model characterizes emissions from vessels while traveling between ports.  
That includes when a vessel is maneuvering a distance of 20 kilometers to enter or exist a port, 
cruising near a port as it traverses the area, or moving in a shipping lane across the open sea.  For 
the U.S., STEEM includes the emissions associated with 251 ports.  The results are spatially 
reported in a gridded format that is resolved to a cell dimension of 4 kilometers by 4 kilometers. 
 

 The near port results, however, are much more geographically limited and are not 

reported in a gridded format.  The analysis includes the emissions associated with ship 
movements when entering or exiting each of 117 major U.S. ports.  For deep sea ports that 
includes when a vessel is hotelling and maneuvering in the port, operating in the RSZ that varies 
in length for each port, and cruising 25 nautical miles between the end of the RSZ and an 
unconstrained shipping lane.  For Great Lakes ports that includes hotelling and maneuvering, 
three nautical miles of RSZ operation, and cruising 7 nautical miles between the end of the RSZ 
and open water.  The results are reported for each port and mode of operation. 
 

 To precisely replace only the portion of the STEEM interport inventory that is 

represented in the near port inventory results, it is necessary to spatially allocate the emissions in 
a format that is compatible with the STEEM 4 kilometers by 4 kilometers gridded output.  Once 
that has been accomplished, the two inventories can be blended together.  Both of these 
processes are described below.  This work was conducted by ENVIRON International as a 
subcontractor under the EPA contract with ICF.2 

3.3.3.3.1  Spatial Location of the Near Port Inventories 

 The hotelling, maneuvering, RSZ, and cruise emissions from the near port inventories 

were spatially located by their respective latitude and longitude coordinates using ArcGIS 
software.  For this study, shapefiles were created that depicted the emission locations as 
described above.  Additional shapefiles were also obtained to locate other geographic features 
such as the coastline and rivers of the U.S.  These shapefiles and the STEEM output can be 
layered upon each other, viewed in ArcMap, and analyzed together.  The following sections 
provide a more detailed description of how the shapefiles representing the ports, RSZ lanes, and 
cruise lanes were developed. 

3-88 

3.3.3.3.1.1  Ports 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 Each port, and thus the designated location for hotelling and maneuvering emissions, is 
modeled as a single latitude/longitude coordinate point using the port center as defined by the 
Army Corp of Engineers in the Principal Ports of the United States dataset.11  One additional 
port, “Other Puget Sound,” which was specially created in the near ports analysis, was added to 
the list of ports.  Some port locations were inspected by consulting Google Earth satellite images 
to ensure that the point that defined the port’s location was physically reasonable for the 
purposes of this analysis.  This resulted in slightly modifying the locations of five ports:  Gray’s 
Harbor, Washington; Freeport and Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; and Moreshead City, 
North Carolina.  In all five cases the change was very small.  The hotelling and maneuvering 
emissions represented by the latitude/longitude coordinate for each port were subsequently 
assigned to a single cell in the gridded inventory where that point was located.  It should be 
noted that modeling a port as a point will over specify the location of the emissions associated 
with that port if it occupies an area greater than one grid cell, or 4 kilometers by 4 kilometers.  
The coordinates of all of the 117 ports used in this work are shown in the Appendix, Table 
3-102. 

3.3.3.3.1.2  Reduced Speed Zone Operation 

 The RSZ routes associated with each of the 117 ports were modeled as lines.  Line 

shapefiles were constructed using the RSZ distance information described in Section 3.3.2 and 
the Army Corp of Engineers National Waterway Network (NWN) geographic database of 
navigable waterways in and around the U.S.16  The coordinates of RSZ endpoints for all of the 
117 ports used in this work are shown in the Appendix, Table 3-103. 
 

 The RSZ emissions were distributed evenly along the length of the line.  The 

latitude/longitude coordinates for each point along the line were subsequently used to assign the 
emissions to a grid cell based on the proportion of the line segment that occurred in the 
respective cell.  Figure 3-4 illustrates how the length of the RSZ line can vary in any grid cell. 
 

 In several instances the NWN links and STEEM data indicated there were two RSZs.  

These ports are:  Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles, Long Beach and El Segundo, California; 
Brunswick, Georgia; and Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Port of South Louisiana, and Plaquemines, 
Louisiana.  The lengths of the two lines were similar in every case, so the RSZ emissions from 
the near ports analysis were divided equally between both branches.  Figure 3-5 shows an 
example of a port with multiple RSZs.

3.3.3.3.1.3  Cruise Operations 

 The cruise mode links that extend 25 nautical miles for deep sea ports or 7 nautical miles 
for Great Lake ports from the end of the RSZ end point were also modeled with line shapefiles.  
These links were spatially described for each port following the direction of the shipping lane 
evident in the STEEM data.  Again, as with RSZ emissions, the latitude/longitude coordinates 
for each point along the line were subsequently used to assign the emissions to a grid cell based 
on the proportion of the line segment that occurred in the respective cell. 
 

 The STEEM data sometimes indicated there were two or three cruise mode links 

associated with a port.  In these cases, the underlying STEEM ship movement data was evaluated 
to determine whether any particular route should be assigned larger emissions than the others.  
That information was judged to be inadequate to justify such differential treatment, so the near 
port cruise emissions for ports with multiple cruise lanes were assigned equally to each link.  
Figure 3-6 provides an example of multiple cruise lanes.

3.3.3.3.2  Combining the Near Port and STEEM Emission Inventories 

 After spatially defining the geographic location of the near port emissions, but before 

actually inserting them into the gridded STEEM inventory, it was necessary to determine if all of 
the STEEM emissions within an affected cell should be replaced, or if some of the emissions 
should be retained.  In this latter case, ships would be traversing the area near a port, but not 
actually entering or exiting the port. 
 

 This evaluation was performed for each port by first overlaying the RSZ and cruise 

shapefiles on the STEEM gridded inventory, and then using ArcGIS tools to create a series of 
circular buffers with a radius of 25 nautical miles around each of the points that represented an 
RSZ line.  A single elongated buffer was then made from the intersection or outer boundaries of 
all the individual circular buffers. As illustrated in Figure 3-6, the resulting RSZ buffer encloses 
the port, RSZ links and cruise mode links.  The STEEM emissions underneath the buffer were 
then evaluated.  In cases where the STEEM data showed that ships were routed directly to an 
isolated port, the STEEM emissions were completely replaced by near port emissions (Figure 
3-7).  Conversely, when the examination revealed that the underlying STEEM emissions 
included some ship passages that were simply traversing near the port, the emissions associated 
with those vessel movements were retained, i.e., not completely replaced with the near port 

3-92 

emission results (Figure 3-8).  The methodology for determining the emissions from transient 
ship operation is described below.

Figure 3-8 Example of Partial Replacement of STEEM Emissions  

(Coos Bay, Oregon) 

 

 

 
 

 The percentage of STEEM emissions that are attributable to a port, and should be 

replaced, were approximated by dividing the STEEM emissions in the isolated portion of the 
route that lead only to the port, with the STEEM emissions in the major shipping lane.  As an 
example, the STEEM emissions in the portion of the buffer in Figure 3-8 that only went to the 
port were approximately 347 kg/cell/year.  The emissions within the buffer for just the major 
shipping lane were 6996 kg/cell/year.  Therefore, the emissions in the grid cells that comprised 
the portion of the buffer overlaying the major shipping lane were reduced by the fraction 
347/6996, or 5 percent before the near port emissions were added to the gridded inventory. 
 

 The actual merging of the two inventories was performed by creating a number of 

databases that identified the fraction of the near port inventory for each pollutant species and 
operating mode that should be added to the grid cells for each port.  A similar database was also 
created that identified how much of the original STEEM emissions should be reduced to account 
for ship movements associated directly with a port, while preserving those that represented 
transient vessel traffic.  These databases were subsequently used to calculate the new emission 
results for each affected cell in the original STEEM gridded inventory, resulting in the combined 
inventory results for this study. 
 

3-94 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 Figure 3-9 provides side-by-side comparisons of the original STEEM emissions 

inventory and the new merged inventory.  The results indicate that the spatial allocation of the 
near port emissions conducted in this study provides a more precise assessment of vessel travel 
near a port than the STEEM methodology.  As previously described, the near port ship emissions 
may be over specified, but this approach generally provides a more reasonable placement of 
emissions near the coastline than the wide shipping lanes in the STEEM model, which in some 
cases show shipping emissions over land.

3.3.4 2002 Baseline Emission Inventories 

 The modeling domain of the new combined emission inventory described above is the 
same as the original STEEM domain, i.e., the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, 
the Great Lakes, Alaska and Hawaii.  Inventories for the nine geographic regions of the U.S. 
specified in Section 3.2 were created using ArcGIS software to intersect the regional shapefiles 
with the 4 kilometers by 4 kilometers gridded domain.  Any grid cell split by a regional boundary 
was considered to be within a region if over 50 percent of its area was within the region.  The 
emissions in each of the cells defined within a region were then summed.  The final emission 
inventories for 2002 are shown in Table 3-56 for each of the nine geographic regions and the 
nation.  The geographic scope of these regions was previously displayed in Figure 3-1.  The fuel 
consumption by fuel type associated with each region is also provided in Table 3-57.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 As previously noted, the inventories in the above table reflect the emissions associated 

with Category 3 ocean-going vessels that are engaged in foreign commerce.  The STEEM 
interport analysis also roughly estimated the emissions associated with these ships that are 
engaged solely in domestic commerce.1,4  These vessels are sometimes referred to as Jones Act 
ships, as explained in Section 3.3.2.5.  Specifically, the interport analysis estimated that the 
emissions from large ocean-going vessels carrying only domestic cargo represent approximately 
2-3 percent of the total values presented in Table 3-56.  This is less than the 6.5 percent estimate 
based on calls to U.S. ports, since the interport traffic includes transiting traffic in U.S. waters. 
 

 The relative contributions of the near port and interport emission inventories to the total 

U.S. emissions are presented in Table 3-58 and Table 3-59.  As expected, based on the 
geographic scope of the two types of inventories, the interport and near port inventories are about 
80 percent and 20 percent of the total, respectively.  The deep sea ports are about 97 to nearly 
100 percent and the Great Lake ports are about 3 to almost zero percent of the total inventories, 
depending on the port region.  This result is also expected given the small number of Great Lake 
ports and more limited geographic area of the modeling domain.

3.4  Development of 2020 and 2030 Scenarios 
3.4.1 Outline of Methodology 

 The emissions from Category 3 ocean-going vessels (main propulsion and auxiliary 
engines) are projected to 2020 and 2030 by applying certain adjustment factors to the 2002 
emission inventories to account for the change in ship traffic over these time periods, i.e., 
growth, and the effect of the current controls and the NOX and fuel controls described in the 
proposed rule. 
 

 The following sections describe the derivation of the growth adjustment factors for each 

of the modeling regions described in Section 3.2, the emission adjustment factors, and the 
resulting 2020 and 2030 emission inventories. 
 

 The final section describes the baseline and control emission inventories that were 

developed for calendar years 2020 and 2030.  The 2030 inventories were used for air quality 
modeling, although the 2020 control inventories reported here have been updated relative to 
those used for the air quality modeling.  A comparison of the 2020 control case inventories 
reported here with those used for the air quality modeling is provided in Section 3.7. 

3.4.2 Growth Factors by Geographic Region 

 This section describes the growth factors that are used to project the emissions to 2020 
and 2030 for each of the nine geographic regions evaluated in this analysis.  These factors are 
based on the expected demand for marine bunker fuels that is associated with shipping goods, 
i.e., commodities, into and out of the U.S.  The use of bunker fuel as a surrogate for estimating 
future emissions is appropriate because the quantity of fuel consumed by C3 engines is highly 

3-99 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

correlated with the amount of combustion products, i.e., pollutants, that are emitted from those 
vessels.  The term bunker fuel in this report also includes marine distillate oil and marine gas oil 
that are used in some auxiliary power engines. 
 

 The remainder of this section first summarizes the development of growth rates by RTI 
International (RTI) for five geographic regions of the U.S., as performed under contract to EPA 
(Section 3.4.2.1).5,6  This is followed by the derivation of the growth factors that are used in this 
study for the nine geographic regions of interest (Section 3.4.2.9). 

3.4.2.1  Summary of Regional Growth Rate Development 

 RTI developed fuel consumption growth rates for five geographic regions of the U.S.  

These regions are the East Coast, Gulf Coast, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Great Lakes.  The 
amount of bunker fuel required in any region and year is based on the demand for transporting 
various types of cargo by Category 3 vessels.  This transportation demand is in turn driven by the 
demand for commodities that are produced in one location and consumed in another, as predicted 
by an econometric model.  The flow of commodities is matched with typical vessels for trade 
routes (characterized according to cargo capacity, engine horsepower, age, specific fuel 
consumption, and engine load factors). Typical voyage parameters are then assigned to the trade 
routes that include average ship speed, round trip mileage, tons of cargo shipped, and days in 
port.  Fuel consumption for each trade route and commodity type thus depends on commodity 
projections, ship characteristics, and voyage characteristics.  Figure 3-10 from RTI illustrates the 
approach to developing baseline projections of marine fuel consumption. 
 

As a means of comparison, the IMO Secretary General’s Informal Cross 

Government/Industry Scientific Group of Experts presented a growth rate that ranged from 3.3% 
to 3.7%.46  RTI’s overall U.S. growth rate was projected at 3.4%, which is consistent with that 
range.

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

 The overall forecast of demand for shipping services and bunker fuel was determined for 
each of the areas using information on commodity flows from Global Insight’s (GI) World Trade 
Service.  Specifically, GI provided a specialized forecast that reports the flow of each commodity 
type for the period 1995–2024, based on a proprietary econometric model.  The general structure 
of the GI model for calculating trade flows assumes a country’s imports from another country are 
driven by the importing country’s demand forces (given that the exporting country possesses 
enough supply capacity), and affected by exporting the country’s export price and importing 
country’s import cost for the commodity. The model then estimates demand forces, country-
specific exporting capacities, export prices, and import costs. 
 

 The GI model included detailed annual region-to-region trade flows for eight composite 
commodities from 1995 to 2024, in addition to the total trade represented by the commodities. 
Table 3-61 illustrates the projections for 2012 and 2020, along with baseline data for 2005.  In 
2005, dry bulk accounted for 41 percent of the total trade volume, crude oil accounted for 28 
percent, and containers accounted for 12 percent.  Dry bulk and crude oil shipments are expected 
to grow more slowly over the forecast period than container shipments.  By 2020, dry bulk 
represents 39 percent of the total, crude oil is 26 percent, and containers rise to 17 percent.

3.4.2.3  Ship Analysis by Vessel Type and Size 

 Different types of vessels are required to transport the different commodities to the 

various regions of the world.  As shown at the top of Figure 3-10, profiles of these ships were 
developed to identify the various vessel types and size categories that are assigned to transport 
commodities of each type along each route.  These profiles include attributes such as ship size, 
engine horsepower, engine load factors, age, and engine fuel efficiency.  This information was 
subsequently used to estimate average daily fuel consumption for each typical ship type and size 
category. 
 

3-103 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 The eight GI commodity categories were mapped to the type of vessel that would be used 

to transport that type of cargo using information from Clarksons Shipping Database.48  These 
assignments are shown in Table 3-62.

 Each of the vessel types were classified by their cargo carrying capacity or deadweight 
tons (DWT).  The size categories were identified based on both industry definitions and natural 
size breaks within the data.  Table 3-63 summarizes the size categories that were used in the 
analysis and provides other information on the general attributes of the vessels from Clarksons 
Shipping Database.  The vessel size descriptions are also used to define shipping routes based on 
physical limitations that are represented by canals or straits through which ships can pass.  Very 
large crude oil tankers are the largest by DWT rating, and the biggest container ships (Suezmax) 
are also very large.

 The average fuel consumption for each vessel type and size category was estimated in a 
multi-step process using individual vessel data on engine characteristics.  Clarksons’ Shipping 
Database Register provides each ship’s total installed horsepower (HP), type of propulsion 
(diesel or steam), and year of build.  These characteristics are then matched to information on 
typical specific fuel consumption (SFC), which is expressed in terms of grams of bunker fuel 
burned per horsepower-hour (g/HP-hr). 
 

3-105 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 The specific SFC values are based on historical data from Wartsila Sulzer, a popular 
manufacturer of diesel engines for marine vessels.  RTI added an additional 10 percent to the 
reported “test bed” or “catalogue” numbers to account for the guaranteed tolerance level and an 
in-service SFC differential. Overall, the 10 percent estimate is consistent with other analyses that 
show some variation between the “test bed” SFC values reported in the manufacturer product 
catalogues and those observed in actual service.  This difference is explained by the fact that old, 
used engines consume more fuel than brand new engines and in-service fuels may be different 
than the test bed fuels.49 
 

 Figure 3-11 shows SFC values that were used in the model regarding the evolution of 
specific fuel oil consumption rates for diesel engines over time.  Engine efficiency in terms of 
SFC has improved over time, most noticeably in the early 1980s in response to rising fuel prices.  
However, there is a tradeoff between improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions.  
Conversations with engine manufacturers indicate that it is reasonable to assume SFC will 
remain constant for the projection period of this study, particularly as they focus on meeting 
NOX emission standard as required by MARPOL Annex VI, or other potential pollution control 
requirements.

Figure 3-11 Diesel Engine Specific Fuel Consumption 

 RTI assumed a fixed SFC of 220 g/HP-hr for steam engines operating on bunker fuel. 

 Using the above information, the average daily fuel consumption (AFC), expressed in 
metric tons of fuel at full engine load, for each vessel type and size category is found using the 
following equation:

 As previously noted, AFC values calculated in the above equation are based on total

factors that were used to estimate the typical average daily fuel consumption (tons/day) for the 
main propulsion engine and the auxiliary engines when operated at sea and in port.50

 The RTI analysis also assumed that the shipping fleet changes over time as older vessels 
are scrapped and replaced with newer ships.  Specifically, vessels over 25 years of age are retired 
and replaced by new ships of the most up-to-date configuration.  This assumption leads to the 
following change in fleet characteristics over the projection period: 
 

•  New ships have engines rated at the current SFC, so even though there are no further 
improvements in specific fuel consumption, the fuel efficiency of the fleet as a whole 
will improve over time through retirement and replacement. 

3-107 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

 

•  New ships will weigh as much as the average ship built in 2005, so the total cargo 
capacity of the fleet will increase over time as smaller ships retire and are replaced. 

•  Container ships will increase in size over time on the trade routes between Asia to 

either North America or Europe. 

3.4.2.4  Trade Analysis by Commodity Type and Trade Route 

 Determining the total number of days at sea and in port, as shown in the middle portion 
of Figure 3-10, requires information on the relative amount of each commodity that is carried by 
the different ship type size categories on each of the trade routes.  For example, to serve the large 
crude oil trade from the Middle East Gulf region to the Gulf Coast of the U.S., 98 percent of the 
deadweight tonnage is carried on very large oil tankers, while the remaining 2 percent is carried 
on smaller Suezmax vessels.  After the vessel type size distribution was found, voyage 
parameters were estimated.  Specifically, these are days at sea and in port for each voyage (based 
on ports called, distance between ports, and ship speed), and the number of voyages (based on 
cargo volume projected by GI and the DTW from Clarksons Shipping Database).   The length of 
each voyage and number of voyages were used to estimate the total number of days at sea and at 
port, which is a parameter used later to calculate total fuel consumption for each vessel type and 
size category over each route and for each commodity type.  (More information on determining 
the round trip distance for each voyage that is associated with cargo demand for the U.S. is 
provided in Section 3.4.2.5.) 
 

 The days at sea were calculated by dividing the round trip distance by the average vessel 

 Table 3-65 presents the speeds by vessel type that were used in the analysis.50  These 

values are the same for all size categories, and are assumed to remain constant over the forecast 
period.

 The number of voyages along each route for each trade was estimated for each vessel 

type v and size category s serving a given route by dividing the tons of cargo moved by the 
amount of cargo (DTW) per voyage:

 Fleet average DWT = Median dead weight tonnage carrying capacity in  metric  tons 
 Utilization rate = Fraction of total ship DWT capacity used 

 The cargo per voyage is based on the fleet average ship size from the vessel profile 
analysis.  For most cargo, a utilization rate of 0.9 is assumed to be constant throughout the 
forecast period.  Lowering this factor would increase the estimated number of voyages required 
to move the forecasted cargo volumes, which would lead to an increase in estimated fuel 
demand. 
 

 In addition to calculating the average days at sea per voyage, the average days in port per 
voyage was also estimated by assuming that most types of cargo vessels spend four days in port 
per voyage.  RTI notes, however, that this can vary somewhat by commodity and port. 

3.4.2.5  Worldwide Estimates of Fuel Demand 

 This section describes how the information from the vessel and trade analyses were used 
to calculate the total annual fuel demand associated with international cargo trade.  Specifically, 
for each year y of the analysis, the total bunker fuel demand is the sum of the fuel consumed on 
each route of each trade (commodity).  The fuel consumed on each route of each trade is in turn 
the sum of the fuel consumed for each route and trade for that year by propulsion main engines

 Figure 3-13 shows the annual growth rates by vessel-type/cargo that are used in the 

projections shown in Figure 3-12.  Total annual growth is generally between 2.5 percent and 3.5 
percent over the time period between 2006 and 2020 and generally declines over time, resulting 
in an average annual growth of around 2.6 percent.

3.4.2.7  Fuel Demand Used to Import and Export Cargo for the United States 

 The methodology described above provides an estimate of fuel consumption for 

international cargo worldwide.  RTI also estimated the subset of fuel demand for cargo imported 
to and exported from five regions of the U.S.  The five regions are: 
 

•  North Pacific 
•  South Pacific 
•  Gulf 
•  East Coast 
•  Great Lakes 

 

 For this analysis, the same equations were used, but were limited to routes that carried 

cargo between specific cities in Asia, Europe and Middle East to the various ports in the specific 
regions of the U.S. 
 

 The trip distances for non-container vessel types were developed from information from 
Worldscale Association and Maritime Chain.51  The data from Worldscale is considered to be the 

3-112 

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

industry standard for measuring port-to-port distances, particularly for tanker traffic.  The 
reported distances account for common routes through channels, canals, or straits.  This distance 
information was supplemented by data from Maritime Chain, a web service that provides port-to-
port distances along with some information about which channels, canals, or straits must be 
passed on the voyage. 
 

 Voyage distances for container vessels are based on information from Containerization 

International Yearbook (CIY) and calculations by RTI.  That reference provides voyage 
information for all major container services.  Based on the frequency of the service, number of 
vessels assigned to that service, and the number of days in operation per year, RTI estimated the 
average length of voyages for the particular bilateral trade routes in the Global Insights trade 
forecasts. 
 

 The distance information developed above was combined with the vessel speeds 

previously shown in Table 3-65 to find the length of a voyage in days.  Table 3-66 presents the 
day lengths for non-containerized vessel types and Table 3-67 shows the same information for 
container vessels.

3.4.2.8  Bunker Fuel Consumption for the United States 

 Figure 3-14 and Figure 3-15 present the estimates of fuel use for delivering trade goods 

to and from the U.S.  The results in Figure 3-14 show estimated historical bunker fuel use in year 
2001 of around 47 million tons (note: while this fuel is used to carry trade goods to and from the 
U.S., it is not necessarily all purchased in the U.S. and is not all burned in U.S. waters).  This 
amount grows to over 90 million tons by 2020 with the most growth occurring on trade routes 
from the East Coast and the “South Pacific” region of the West Coast.

3.4.2.9  2020 and 2030 Growth Factors for Nine Geographic Regions 

 The results of the RTI analysis described above are used to develop the growth factors 

that are necessary to project the 2002 base year emissions inventory to 2020 and 2030.  The next 
two sections describe how the five RTI regions were associated with the nine regions analyzed in 
this report, and how the specific growth rates for each of the nine regions were developed. 

3.4.2.9.1  Mapping the RTI Regional Results to the Nine Region Analysis 

 As described in Section 3.3.4, the nine geographic regions analyzed in this study were 

designed to be consistent with the five RTI regional modeling domains.  More specifically, four 
of the nine geographic areas in this study, i.e., Alaska East, Alaska West, Hawaii East, and 
Hawaii West are actually subsets of two broader regional areas that were analyzed by RTI, i.e., 
the North Pacific for both Alaska regions and South Pacific for Hawaii.  Therefore, the growth 
rate information from the related larger region was assumed to be representative for that state. 
 

 The nine geographic regions represented in the emission inventory study are presented in 

Figure 3-1.  The association of the RTI regions to the emission inventory regions is shown in 
Table 3-68.

3.4.2.9.2  Growth Factors for the Emission Inventory Analysis 

 Emission inventories for 2020 and 2030 are estimated in Section 3.4.5 by multiplying the 

2002 baseline inventory for each region by a corresponding growth factor that was developed 
from the RTI regional results.  Specifically, the average annual growth rate from 2002-2020 was 
calculated for each of the five regions.  Each regional growth rate was then compounded over the 
inventory projection time period for 2020 and 2030, i.e., 18 and 28 years, respectively.  The 
resulting multiplicative growth factors for each emission inventory region and the associated RTI 
average annual growth rate are presented in Table 3-69 for each projection year.

3.4.3 Emission Controls in Baseline and Control Scenarios 

This section describes the control programs present in the baseline and control scenarios, 

as well as the resulting emission factors. 

 
The baseline scenario includes the International Marine Organization’s (IMO) Tier 1 
NOX standard for marine diesel engines that became effective in 2000.  The control scenario 
applies global controls as well as additional ECA controls within the ECA boundaries  
 

The global NOX controls include a retrofit program for Tier 0 (pre-control) engines, 

which was modeled as 11 percent control from Tier 0 for 80 percent of 1990 thru 1999 model 
year (MY) engines greater than 90 liters per cylinder (L/cyl) starting in 2011.  The retrofit 
program was also modeled with a five year phase-in.  The current Tier 1 controls, which also are 
modeled as achieving an 11 percent reduction from Tier 0, apply to the 2000 thru 2010 MY 
engines.  In 2011 thru 2015, Tier 2 controls are applied.  Tier 2 controls are modeled as a 2.5 
g/kW-hr reduction from Tier 1.  Fuel sulfur content for the global control area is assumed to be 
controlled to 5,000 ppm.  No controls are assumed for HC or CO. 

 
Within the ECA areas, additional Tier 3 NOX controls are applied for 2016 MY engines 

and beyond.  Tier 3 controls are modeled as achieving an 80 percent reduction from Tier 1 
levels.  In addition to the NOX control program, fuel sulfur content is also assumed to be 
controlled to 1,000 ppm within the ECA in 2020 and 2030.  Fuel sulfur content affects SO2 and 
PM emissions.  Note that gas and steam turbine engines are not subject to any of the NOX 
standards; however, these engines are not a large part of the inventory. 
 

 Within the control scenario, global controls are applied for the Alaska West and Hawaii 
West regions.  Global controls are also applied beyond 200 nm from shore for the 48 contiguous 
states, Alaska East, and Hawaii East.  The ECA controls are applied within 200 nm from shore 
for the 48 contiguous states as well as the Alaska East and Hawaii East regions. 

3.4.3.1  2020 and 2030 Emission Factors 

 The baseline scenario described in the previous section includes Tier 1 NOX control.  The 
control scenario includes additional NOX controls and fuel sulfur controls, the latter affecting PM 
and SO2 emissions.  The switch to lower sulfur distillate fuel use is also assumed to lower CO2 
emissions slightly.  HC and CO are assumed to remain unchanged. 
 

 The NOX emission factors (EFs) by engine/ship type and tier are provided in Table 3-70.  

Tier 0 refers to pre-control.  There are separate entries for Tier 0/1 base and Tier 0/1 control, 
since the Tier 0/1 control engines would be using distillate fuel, and there are small NOX 
emission reductions assumed when switching from residual to distillate fuel.21  The NOX control 
EFs by tier were derived using the assumptions described in Section 3.4.3.

Note: 
a The retrofit program applies to engines over 90 L/cyl; auxiliary engines are smaller than this 
cutpoint and would therefore not be subject to the program. 

 

 

 The NOX EFs by tier were then used with the age distributions in Table 3-71 and Table 

3-72 below to generate calendar year NOX EFs by engine/ship type for the base and control areas 
included in the scenarios.  These calendar year NOX EFs are provided in Table 3-73.  Since the 
age distributions are different for vessels in the Great Lakes, NOX EFs were determined 
separately for the Great Lakes.

 For PM and SO2, there are no proposed standards; however, the control of fuel sulfur 
affects these pollutants.  Therefore, the PM and SO2 EFs are strictly a function of fuel sulfur 
level.  For the baseline portions of the inventory, there are two residual fuel sulfur levels 
modeled: 25,000 ppm for the West Coast and 27,000 ppm for the rest of the U.S.  The baseline 
distillate fuel sulfur level assumed for all areas is 15,000 ppm.  As discussed in Section 3.3.2.3.5, 
for the baseline, main engines use residual fuel and auxiliary engines use a mix of residual and 
distillate fuel.  For the control areas, there are two levels of distillate fuel sulfur assumed to be 
used by all engines: 5,000 ppm for the global control areas and 1,000 ppm for the ECA control 
areas. 
 

Table 3-74 provides the PM10 EFs by engine/ship type and fuel sulfur level.  For 

modeling purposes, PM2.5 is assumed to be 92 percent of PM10.  The PM EFs are adjusted to 
reflect the appropriate fuel sulfur levels using the equation described in Section 3.3.2.3.6. 
 

 Table 3-75 provides the modeled SO2 EFs.  SO2 emission reductions are directly 

proportional to reductions in fuel sulfur content. 
 

 CO2 is directly proportional to fuel consumed.  Table 3-76 provides the modeled CO2 and 
brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) EFs.  Due to the higher energy content of distillate fuel 
on a mass basis, the switch to distillate fuel for the control areas results in a small reduction to 
BSFC and, correspondingly, CO2 emissions.21

3.4.4 Calculation of Near Port and Interport Inventories 

Based on the emission factors described in Section 3.4.3.1, appropriate growth factors 

and emission adjustment factors were applied to the 2002 baseline inventory to obtain the NOX, 
PM (PM10 and PM2.5), SO2, and CO2 inventory of each 2020 and 2030 scenario.  Adjustment 
factors are ratios of the 2020 or 2030 calendar year EFs to the 2002 calendar year EFs.  
Adjustment factors are derived separately by engine type for propulsion and auxiliary engines.  
The adjustment factors for propulsion engines are applied to the propulsion portion of the port 
inventory and the interport portion of the inventory.  The adjustment factors for auxiliary engines 
are applied to the auxiliary portion of the port inventory.  This section describes the development 
and application of the adjustment factors to the port and interport inventories, and the 
methodology for combining the port and interport portions. 

3.4.4.1  Port Methodology 

3.4.4.1.1  Non-California Ports 

 For the non-California ports, 2002 emissions for each port are summed by engine/ship 

type.  Propulsion and auxiliary emissions are summed separately, since the EF adjustment factors 
differ.  The appropriate regional growth factor, as provided in Table 3-69, is then applied, along 
with EF adjustment factors by engine/ship type.  The EF adjustment factors are a ratio of the 
control EF to the 2002 EF.  Table 3-77 thru Table 3-81 provide the EF adjustment factors for 
each pollutant and control area.  The ports will be subject to ECA controls in the control 
scenarios.  These tables are also used as input for the California ports and interport control 
inventory development, discussed in subsequent sections.  Since the control scenario assumes a 
portion of the inventory is subject to global controls, the adjustment factors for the 2020 and 
2030 global controls are also provided.  The baseline adjustment factors are also provided.

3.4.4.1.2  California Ports 

 For the California ports, 2002 emissions for each port are summed by ship type.  

Propulsion and auxiliary emissions are summed separately, since the EF adjustment factors 
differ.  The EF adjustment factors by engine/ship type, provided in the previous section, are 
consolidated by ship type, using the CARB assumption that engines on all ships except 
passenger ships are 95 percent slow speed diesel (SSD) engines and 5 percent medium speed 
diesel engines (MSD) based upon a 2005 ARB survey.53  All passenger ships were assumed to 
be medium speed diesel engines with electric drive propulsion (MSD-ED).  Steam turbines (ST) 
and gas-turbines (GT) are not included in the CARB inventory.  The EF adjustment factors by 
ship type are then applied, along with ship-specific growth factors supplied by CARB.  The ship-
specific growth factors relative to 2002 are provided in Table 3-82 below.

3.4.4.2  Interport Methodology 

 The interport portion of the inventory is not segregated by engine or ship type.  As a 

result, regional EF adjustment factors were developed based on the assumed mix of main 
(propulsion) engine types in each region.  The mix of main engine types by region was 
developed using the ship call and power data and is presented in Table 3-83 and Figure 3-16.  
Main engines are considered a good surrogate for interport emissions, since the majority of 
emissions while underway are due to the main engines.  The EF adjustment factors by main 
engine type in Section 3.4.4.1.1 were used together with the mix of main engine types by region 
to develop the EF regional adjustment factors for each control area.  The resulting EF regional 
adjustment factors for each pollutant and control area are provided in Table 3-84 thru Table 3-88 
below.  These EF regional adjustment factors, together with the regional growth factors in Table 
3-69, were applied to calculate the future inventories for each control area.

3.4.4.3  Estimating and Combining the Near Port and Interport Inventories 

 To produce future year control scenarios, the interport inventories were scaled by a 

growth factor to 2020 and 2030, as previously described.  An ECA boundary line was drawn so 
that each point on it was at a 200 nm distance from the nearest point on land.  Adjustment 
factors, as described in Section 3.4.3.1, were then applied to interport emissions within the ECA 
boundary. 
 

To create control scenarios in the near port inventories, growth and control factors were 
applied to the 2002 near port inventories (described in Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3.1).  The near port 
inventories were then converted into a gridded format (Section 3.3.3.3).  Using this grid, STEEM 
values were removed from near port cells and near port emissions were used as replacement 
values.  In cases where the emissions near ports were only partially attributable to port traffic, the 
STEEM inventory was reduced rather than removed. 
 

Interport and near port emissions were then aggregated to form regional totals. 

 

3.4.5 2020 and 2030 Baseline Inventories 

The resulting 2020 and 2030 estimated emission inventories by region and the nation are 

shown in Table 3-89 and Table 3-90.  These baseline inventories account for growth as well as

3.4.6 2020 and 2030 Control Inventories 

 For the control scenario, the inventories for each of the nine geographic regions, the U.S. 

total, and the 48-state total are presented in Table 3-92 and Table 3-93.  The regional and total 
inventories include all emissions within 200nm of shore.  For the purposes of this analysis, ECA 
controls are assumed to apply to all regions, except Alaska West and Hawaii West.  For the 
Alaska West and Hawaii West regions, global controls apply.  Estimated fuel consumption for 
the control inventories by region and fuel type is given in Table 3-94.

3.5  Estimated Category 3 Inventory Contribution 

 This section describes the contribution of Category 3 marine engines to national and 

selected local emission inventories in 2002, 2020, and 2030.  The pollutants analyzed are NOX, 
directly emitted PM2.5, and SO2.  All weight units in the following tables are short tons. 
3.5.1 Baseline Contribution of C3 Vessels to National Level Inventory 

 Category 3 marine engines contribute to the formation of ground level ozone and 
concentrations of fine particles in the ambient atmosphere.  Based on our current emission 
inventory analysis, we estimate that these engines contributed nearly 6 percent of mobile source 
NOX, over 10 percent of mobile source PM2.5, and about 40 percent of mobile source SO2 in 
2002.  We estimate that their contribution will increase to about 40 percent of mobile source 
NOX, 48 percent of mobile source PM2.5, and 95 percent of mobile source SO2 by 2030 without 
further controls on these engines.  Our current estimates for NOX, PM2.5, and SO2 inventories are 
set out in the following tables.  Inventory projections for 2020 and 2030 include the effect of 
existing emission mobile source and stationary source control programs previously adopted by 
EPA.

Chapter 3: Emission Inventory 
 

3.5.2 Contribution to Mobile Source Inventories for Selected Cities 

 Commercial marine vessels, powered by Category 3 marine engines, contribute 

significantly to the emissions inventory for many U.S. ports.  This is illustrated in Table 3-98, 
which presents the mobile source inventory contributions of these vessels for several ports.  The 
ports in this table were selected to present a sampling over a wide geographic area along the U.S. 
coasts.  In 2005, these twenty ports received approximately 60 percent of the vessel calls to the 
U.S. from ships of 10,000 dead weight tons (DWT) or greater.54

Currently, more than 40 major U.S. deep sea ports are located in areas that are designated 

as being in nonattainment for either or both the 8-hour ozone NAAQS and PM2.5 NAAQS.  
Many ports are located in areas rated as class I federal areas for visibility impairment and 
regional haze.  It should be noted that emissions from ocean-going vessels are not simply a 
localized problem related only to cities that have commercial ports.  Virtually all U.S. coastal 
areas are affected by emissions from ships that transit between those ports, using shipping lanes 
that are close to land.  Many of these coastal areas also have high population densities.  For 
example, Santa Barbara, which has no commercial port, estimates that engines on ocean-going 
marine vessels currently contribute about 37 percent of total NOX in their area.55  These 

3-139 

Regulatory Impact Analysis 

emissions are from ships that transit the area, and “are comparable to (even slightly larger than) 
the amount of NOX produced onshore by cars and truck.”  By 2015 these emissions are expected 
to increase 67 percent, contributing 61 percent of Santa Barbara’s total NOX emissions. This mix 
of emission sources led Santa Barbara to point out that they will be unable to meet air quality 
standards for ozone without significant emission reductions from these vessels, even if they 
completely eliminate all other sources of pollution.  Interport emissions from OGV also 
contribute to other environmental problems, affecting sensitive marine and land ecosystems. 
 
3.6  Projected Emission Reductions 

 The projected tons reductions for each of the 2020 control cases relative to the 2020 

baseline, as well as the tons reductions for the 2030 control case relative to the 2030 baseline, are 
presented in Table 3-99 thru Table 3-100.  Reductions by region, for the total U.S., and for the 
total 48-states, are provided by pollutant in each table.

The emission inventories for 2020 presented in this chapter are slightly different from the 

emissions inventories used in the air quality modeling presented in Chapter 2.  Specifically, the 
2020 inventories used in the air quality modeling reflect a slightly different boundary for the 
proposed ECA that was based on a measurement error.  Due to the nature of the measurement 
error, the corrections to the ECA boundaries are not uniform, but are different by coastal area.  
The measurement error affects only those portions that are farthest from shore.  The 2030 
inventories are not affected by this error. 
 

 A comparison of the air quality and final inventories by region for the 2020 baseline 

scenario is provided in Table 3-101.  Results are provided only for NOX, PM2.5, and SO2, since 
the air quality modeling is focused on ozone and PM2.5.  In addition, Alaska and Hawaii are not 
included, since the air quality modeling domain does not include these states.  As seen in Table 
3-101, the changes due to the boundary error are not expected to have a significant impact on the 
results of our analysis.

 The 2020 control inventories are also subject to the boundary error.  In addition, the 2020 

air quality control case does not include global controls for areas that are beyond 200 nm but 
within the air quality modeling domain.  The impact of this latter difference is expected to be 
minimal. 
 

 The modeling for 2030 was based on inventories that reflected an ECA distance closer to 

shore than what we are proposing.  The air quality modeling, and related estimates of benefits, 
therefore reflect the impacts associated with approximately 80% of the emission reductions 
achieved by the proposed coordinated strategy.  As a result, the 2030 air quality impacts and 
health benefits presented in Chapters 2 and 6, respectively, should be considered conservative 
estimates of the improvements in air quality associated with the proposal.  For the final RIA, we 
plan to model the 2030 coordinated strategy to control ship emissions with a 200 nm boundary 
and global controls beyond.

APPENDIX 3B 

 
 

Inventory Impacts of Alternative Program 

 

 The proposed program represents a comprehensive approach to reduce emissions from 
Category 3 marine diesel engines.  As we developed this proposal, we evaluated an alternative, 
which considers the possibility of pulling ahead the CAA Tier 3 NOX standard from 2016 to 
2014.  NOX emissions were calculated for the year 2023 under three scenarios: Tier 1 only NOX 
standards (the base case), the coordinated strategy as proposed in NPRM which includes the 
2016 NOX standards in effect 2016 (the primary case), and NOX standards for U.S.-vessels only 
pulled ahead to 2014 (the alternative case).  This appendix describes the methodology that was 
used to estimate the NOX inventories for the proposed and alternative program scenarios in 2023. 
 

 The inventories described in this chapter are for calendar years 2002, 2020, and 2030.  To 

calculate inventories for 2023, a spreadsheet model was developed and used.  For both the 
proposed and alternative scenarios, it was assumed that the proposed ECA controls apply within 
200 nautical miles for all 48 contiguous states.  The only difference modeled was the different 
start dates for Tier 3.  Note that only emissions from U.S. vessels are impacted by the proposed 
alternative.  
 

 Under the proposed base scenario, 48-state NOX emissions in 2023 are 10,494,636 short 
tons.  With the coordinated strategy in effect (the primary case), 48-state NOX emissions in 2023 
are 7,515,389 short tons, a 28.4 % reduction from Tier 1 only standards. Under the alternative 
scenario, 48-state NOX emissions in 2023 are 7,444,866 short tons, a difference of 0.9 percent 
from the primary case (Figure 3B-1).
