Section 1 

Introduction 

 

 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to phase-in the major source 
applicability thresholds for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the Prevention of Significant 
Deterioration (PSD) and title V programs of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and to set a PSD 
significance level for GHG emissions (proposal also referred to as tailoring rule).  This proposal 
is necessary because of EPA’s “Proposed Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for 
Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act” determining GHGs emissions to be an air 
pollutant1, and because EPA expects soon to promulgate regulations under the CAA to control 
GHG emissions from light-duty motor vehicles and, as a result, trigger PSD and title V 
requirements for GHG emissions.2  If PSD and title V requirements apply at the applicability 
levels provided under the CAA, State permitting authorities would be paralyzed by enormous 
numbers of permit applications; the amounts are orders of magnitude greater than the current 
inventory of permits and would vastly exceed the current administrative resources of the 
permitting authorities.  Given this circumstance, and relying on established legal doctrines as 
described in the proposal notice, this proposed rule would phase-in PSD and title V applicability 
by temporarily establishing revised applicability thresholds for both the PSD and title V 
programs, and temporarily establishing a PSD significance level.  Concurrently EPA will 
conduct a study of the permitting authorities’ ability to administer the programs going forward, 
and conduct a rulemaking to establish revised applicability levels or other methods for 
streamlining administration, all within six years of the effective date of final action of this 
proposal.  EPA also proposes to identify as the pollutant subject to PSD and title V the group of 
up to six GHG emissions, each one weighted for its global warming potential, that are included 
in regulations for their control under the CAA.  EPA also proposes to conform its action on PSD 
state implementation plans (SIPs) and title V programs to match the proposed Federal 
applicability requirements.

This rule does not impose any new burden as it provides temporary regulatory relief for 
sources of GHG emissions below a level of 25,000 tpy CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents).  The 
primary GHGs of concern directly emitted by human activities include CO2, methane (CH4), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur 
hexafluoride (SF6).  Different GHGs have different heat-trapping capacities.  It is useful to 
compare them to each other through the use of the CO2e metric.  This metric incorporates both 
the heat-trapping ability and atmospheric lifetime of each GHG and can be used to adjust the 
quantities, in tpy, of all GHGs relative to the global warming potential (GWP) of CO2.  When 
quantities of the different GHGs are multiplied by their GWPs, the different GHGs can be 
summed and compared on a CO2e basis.  Depending on which GWP values are used, the 
calculated GHG emissions on a CO2e basis will vary.  Throughout this document, we are 
applying the GWP values established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
in its Second Assessment Report (SAR) (IPCC 1996).3  

In the U.S., the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, gas) is the largest source of CO2 

emissions and accounts for 80 percent of total GHG emissions.  More than half the energy-
related emissions come from large stationary sources such as power plants, while about a third 
comes from transportation.  Of the six primary GHGs, four (CO2, CH4, N2O, and HFCs) are 
emitted by motor vehicles.  Industrial processes (such as the production of cement, steel, and 
aluminum), agriculture, forestry, other land use, and waste management are also important 
sources of GHG emissions in the U.S.  These emissions are inventoried at a national level by 
EPA in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.4 The entities affected by this 
rule are small stationary GHG emitting sources. 

We have completed a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) that estimates the cost savings 

to sources and permitting authorities achieved by this rule. Because the need for the tailoring rule 
is predicated on a separate action taken by the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA, 
this analysis focuses on the effects of regulation assuming that such an action occurs.  However,

because a triggering action may not yet have happened, there is at least some uncertainty about 
when it will occur.  This uncertainty has been directly considered in developing regulatory 
alternatives considered in this RIA.  Figure 1.0 below depicts alternative states of regulation 
considered in analyzing the impacts of the tailoring rule in this RIA.  As shown in Figure 1.0, 
these states of the regulation may be initially divided into those where a triggering event has 
occurred or has not.  The left branch of the figure shows the case where a triggering event has 
taken place.  For purposes of this RIA, alternatives shown on the left branch of the figure (GHG 
Permitting Triggered) are directly considered in the regulatory alternatives analyzed in this 
report.  Within these alternatives, the EPA will further consider regulatory relief threshold 
alternatives, as well as, the consequences likely to occur if the EPA takes no regulatory relief 
action.  In contrast, those circumstances shown in the right branch (GHG Permitting Not 
Triggered) require no action on the part of sources or permitting authorities and the state of the 
regulation remains unchanged from the present.  If GHG permitting is not triggered, there is no 
immediate need for the tailoring rule.  However, if the tailoring rule is advanced before any 
triggering regulation, it would be in place in the event such an action takes place at some point in 
the future.  If the EPA does not pursue reduction of GHG emissions in a separate regulatory 
action, the tailoring rule will have no impact.   

While this RIA does not directly consider these alternative states of the regulation in the 

analytics presented, it should be noted that the possibilities are feasible outcomes absent a 
triggering mechanism. Because of the existence of these possibilities, the regulatory analysis 
could plausibly have employed two baselines: 

1)  Estimation of cost savings of the tailoring rule assuming the triggered PSD and Title V 

requirements as outlined in this RIA; 

2)  Estimation of total costs associated with the tailoring rule assuming that the statutory 

requirements have not been triggered. 

As noted above, this RIA examined the rule in detail using the Baseline 1 approach, but 
did not examine Baseline 2 in detail due to the negligible impact the tailoring rule would have 
prior to a GHG regulation triggering the statutory requirements.  We seek comment on whether 
EPA should further conduct analysis using Baseline 2.   

 

5

We also note that, under Baseline 1, for any of the thresholds analyzed, there is also a 
class of very large sources and modifications that will remain subject to PSD and/or title V for 
GHG following a GHG-triggering regulation.  We do not analyze the magnitude of the costs and 
benefits of PSD/Title V regulation for those sources because they are, by definition, sources that 
are included in the baseline.  The information in Appendix A indicates that at the proposed 
25,000 tons/year CO2e threshold, about 14,000 sources would be classified as major for GHG, 
and about 400 new sources and modifications each year would trigger PSD for GHG.  We 
estimate that all but about 3,000 of the sources and about 60 of the modifications likely would 
already be major for other pollutants.  The permitting burden for such sources is not attributable 
to the tailoring rule.  However, under our analysis of Baseline 1, we consider alternatives to the 
25,000 threshold that could result in greater or lesser coverage compared to the baseline, within 
the constraints imposed by the legal doctrines described in the preamble.

1.1 Executive Summary 
 
This RIA examines the benefits, costs, and economic impacts of the proposed rule for 
affected entities and society as a whole.  This proposed rule lifts, for a period of six years, the 
burden to obtain a title V operating permit required by the CAA for smaller existing sources of 
GHGs and the burden of NSR requirements for smaller new or modifying sources of GHGs.  
Thus this rule may be viewed as providing regulatory relief rather than regulatory requirements 
for these smaller GHG sources for a period of six years.  For larger sources of GHGs, there are 
no direct economic burdens or costs as a result of this proposed rule, because requirements to 
obtain a title V operating permit or to adhere to NSR requirements of the CAA are already 
mandated by the Act and by existing rules and are not imposed as a result of this proposed 
rulemaking.  The RIA conducted for this proposed rule may be considered illustrative of the 
benefits in terms of regulatory relief that smaller GHG sources will experience in terms of costs 
avoided as a result of this proposed rule.   

This rulemaking provides proposed permitting thresholds for sources of GHGs that 

exceed levels contained in the CAA.  Specifically, sources with the potential to emit less than 
25,000 tons per year (tpy) CO2e are not required to obtain an operating permit or PSD permit for 
a period of at least five years at which time a study will be conducted and the decision revisited 
after six years.  In the six years following promulgation of this rule, the EPA estimates that, 
compared to baseline estimates that do not include the effects of this rule, over six million 
sources of GHG emissions will be allowed to operate without a title V operating permits and tens 
of thousands of new sources or modifying sources will not be subject to NSR requirements for 
GHGs.  For this large number of smaller sources, this rule alleviates the regulatory burden 
associated with obtaining an operating or PSD permit or complying with NSR BACT 
requirements.  Therefore, this proposed action may be considered beneficial to these small 
entities as it provides relief from regulation that would otherwise be required.  However, this 
decision does potentially have environmental consequences in the form of lesser emission 
reductions during the six year period of time.  Given that these smaller sources of GHG account 
for an estimated 7 percent of the six directly emitted GHGs nationally from industrial, 
commercial, and residential source categories, while representing over 95 percent of the total 
number of sources potentially requiring a PSD permit for GHGs under current permitting 
thresholds in the CAA, the EPA believes this is a prudent decision.  Requiring such a large 

 

8

number of small sources to obtain permits for the first time would overtax the permitting 
authorities’ abilities to process new permits without commensurate benefits.  Moreover, 
reductions from these small sources will still be occurring, notwithstanding the fact that 
permitting requirements would not apply to them.  These smaller sources of GHG will be the 
focus of voluntary emission reduction programs and energy efficiency measures that lead to 
reductions in GHGs.  The EPA will also reevaluate this decision after a six year period and a 
study of the implications of permitting smaller GHG sources to those sources and permitting 
authorities.

Section 2 

Regulatory Alternatives and Affected Entities 

As previously stated, this proposed rule is essentially providing regulatory relief and 

 
does not include direct regulatory provisions for any industrial, commercial or residential 
entities.  An analysis is presented for smaller sources that experience regulatory relief.  This 
proposal increases the GHG threshold for title V applicability to obtain a title V operating permit 
potential to emit levels from 100 tpy to 25,000 tpy CO2e or greater annual emissions or potential 
emissions.  In addition, under the proposal, new sources of GHG emissions with the potential to 
emit 25,000 tpy CO2e or more emissions rather than the CAA mandated 250 tpy are subject to 
NSR and are required to obtain a PSD permit and to comply with BACT regulatory requirements 
by the CAA.  Major modifications at sources of GHG emissions are also required to obtain a 
PSD permit and to meet BACT regulatory requirements, when the projected emissions increase 
from such modification exceeds the NSR significant level (with the promulgated level to be 
selected from a proposed range of values between 10,000 and 25,000 tpy CO2e).  Impacts on 
new and modified sources of GHG emissions with the potential to emit 25,000 tpy CO2e or 
greater annual emissions are not included in this RIA since these impacts are not associated with 
this rule.  In addition to consideration of the proposed threshold of 25,000 CO2e tpy potential to 
emit, this RIA examines alternative regulatory thresholds of 10,000 tpy CO2e and 50,000 tpy 
CO2e potential to emit, as well as, an alternative of no regulatory action that leaves the 
permitting thresholds in the CAA unaltered for sources of GHG emissions.  

The information on number of affected sources utilized in this RIA is based on emission 

estimates that represent a facility’s potential-to-emit (PTE).   PTE is defined as the maximum 
capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design, 
including certain legal limitations, for example, on emissions or hours of operation.  NSR and 
title V programs both use PTE for defining major sources.  This is particularly relevant concern 
for determining the number of facilities in the commercial and residential sector that may be 
affected, where CO2 emissions are primarily due to space heating/appliance usage and the 
combustion units are not likely to be used constantly at their maximum rated capacity.   Our 
basis for these PTE adjustments in the residential and commercial sectors are based on  
information on heating equipment and appliance usage in these sectors, and resulted in a range of 

 

10

85 to 90 percent upwards adjustment in emissions from actual emission values.  A full 
description of the basis of these PTE adjustments can be found in Attachment B, Technical 
Support Document for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Threshold Evaluation.   

The rationale for proposing the 25,000 tpy CO2e threshold in the proposed tailoring rule 
is based in part on our review of the costs and benefits associated with the different thresholds 
evaluated and described in this RIA.  However, the primary basis for choosing the 25,000 tpy 
CO2e threshold was to ensure consistency with the legal doctrines set forth in the preamble of the 
proposed tailoring rule.   To apply the statutory PSD and title V applicability thresholds to 
sources of GHG emissions would create immediate and insuperable administrative burdens for 
permitting authorities.  By establishing the applicability thresholds at the 25,000-tpy levels for 
the first phase, we would avoid an administratively impossible scenario where each year tens of 
thousands of new sources and modifications would become subject to PSD review; and, in total, 
millions of sources would require title V operating permits.   We used the results of this RIA to 
support the decision on proposing a 25,000 tpy CO2e threshold, which we believe would result in 
a variance from existing statutory permitting thresholds that would – consistent with the 
supporting legal rationale -- be as limited as possible and with consideration given to costs and 
benefits as described in this RIA. 
 
regulatory alternatives in this RIA.  As shown on Table 2-1, leaving the CAA thresholds 
unchanged for sources of GHG emissions is the baseline or no action alternative that will render 
this tailoring rule as having no impact on sources or permitting authorities beyond the current 
CAA requirements. Thus this is a regulatory alternative with zero benefits and zero costs. Under 
this alternative, small and large sources of GHG emissions will be required to obtain operating 
and PSD permits as mandated by the Act.  While this alternative is considered for analytical 
completeness, its impact is essentially the same as no GHG tailoring rule and no further 
discussion of this alternative is considered in this document.  
 
avoided at smaller sources by increasing the threshold levels above current CAA requirements as 
reflected on Table 2-1.  Under this proposal, millions of title V sources and thousands of NSR 
sources are afforded regulatory relief.  For the proposed regulatory alternative increasing the

1 This table assumes that a separate action has regulated GHG, triggering permitting for sources.  When this 
happens, sources with the potential to emit 100 tpy CO2e will be required to obtain a Title V permit and new or 
modifying sources with the potential to emit 250 tpy will be required to obtain a PSD permit as required by the 
CAA.  If current threshold levels in the CAA remain unchanged for GHG emissions, the tailoring rule has no effect 
on sources or permitting authorities and provides no regulatory relief to such sources.

regulatory alternatives in Section 3 of this document.

The EPA considered a number of factors involving administrative burden and necessity 

  

  

in proposing a threshold of 25,000 tpy CO2e.  When comparing the regulatory alternatives 
discussed above, there is a non-trivial difference between them.  The reason the 25,000 tpy 
threshold is preferred to 10,000 tpy is because permitting authorities cannot immediately 
accommodate a huge immediate increase in permitting.  The proposed threshold of 25,000 tpy 
CO2e is also superior to the 50,000 tpy CO2e because there is evidence that permitting authorities

can run programs for the levels of permitting that would be required at 25,000 tpy CO2e, and the 
EPA believes legal doctrine requires the threshold to be as low as administratively feasible.  The 
choice of a threshold is a balancing act of administrative considerations between threshold levels 
that the EPA feels are not administratively feasible (i.e., 10,000 tpy CO2e potential to emit 
threshold) compared to thresholds levels that are not impossible (i.e., 50,000 tpy CO2e potential 
to emit threshold) with the proposed threshold of 25,000 tpy CO2e achieving a reasonable 
balance. For more information on this issue see Attachment B.

Section 3 

Information Collection Costs 

EPA estimated the costs for small sources of GHG that will be postponed as a result of 
this rulemaking in the form of avoided information collection costs or burden costs associated 
with obtaining a title V or PSD permit.  This analysis focuses upon the burdens that are being 
lifted for smaller sources as a result of this proposed rule.  In addition, an accounting of the 
avoided costs to State, local, and tribal permitting authorities is provided.  These avoided costs 
relate specifically to information collection costs or burden costs for sources of GHG emissions 
that would have been required to obtain an operating permit under title V or required to modify 
an existing permit to address GHGs if not for this rule.  Avoided costs shown also include 
information collection requirements for additional PSD permits required for new or modifying 
sources of GHGs, as well as, the costs to state, local and tribal permitting authorities for 
extending their existing permitting programs to include sources of GHGs. 

Time and costs associated with permit activities are derived from existing Information 

ICRs.  Significant uncertainties exist in the following estimates due to the lack of historical 
record and permitting experience upon which to base resource needs for including GHG sources.  

3.1 Burden Costs for Title V  

Major sources of GHGs with the potential to emit 25,000 tpy CO2e from the six directly 
emitted GHGs are required to obtain a title V operating permit.  Those sources emitting less than 
25,000 tpy CO2e will experience regulatory relief under this proposal.  Table 3-1 shows the 
estimated first-year information collection costs for an industrial source subject to title V 
postponed for small GHG sources.   

As shown on Table 3-1, the cost for an industrial source to obtain an operating permit is 
estimated to be approximately $46.4 thousand (2007$) per permit.  Over 195 thousand industrial 
sources are likely to benefit from this rule due to the postponement of permitting requirements.  
The burden cost to obtain a new commercial or multi-family residential operating permit is 
estimated to be approximately $5.0 thousand (2007$) per permit with approximately 6 million of 
these sources benefitting from this rule by avoiding these costs for at least six years.  The total 
information collection costs postpones for smaller sources of GHGs amount to approximately 
$38 billion (2007$).

Avoided costs for sources at alternative threshold levels of <10,000 tpy and <50,000 tpy are also 
presented in Table 3-1.  The avoided costs for title V represent initial costs expected to be 
incurred by sources when the program is extended to sources of GHG emissions absent this rule.  
Title V sources are required to obtain an operating permit and to renew this permit every five 
years.   

State, local and tribal permitting authorities will also benefit from this rule by avoiding 

the administrative burden of processing over 6 million title V operating permits for small sources 
of GHGs.  ICR cost estimates for permitting authorities and sources are calculated based on 
information obtained from the April 2007 Information Collection Request for State Operating 
Permit Regulations5. Annual values are derived from Tables 7 and 8 of this document.  For 
consistency, the permitting authority labor costs are updated to 2007 dollars utilizing the 2007 
General Schedule Salary Table from the Office of Personnel Management.  For the purposes of 
this analysis, we assumed that commercial/residential sources that exceed the major source 
threshold due to GHG emissions will not likely have substantial applicable requirements in the 
near term. We also assumed that permits for such sources will not require as much time to 
prepare and issue as those for industrial sources, which have applicable requirements in addition 
to GHG. Therefore, it is estimated that new commercial/residential permits require 10% of the 
time needed for new industrial permits, or 43 hours compared to 428 hours for permitting 
authorities. For significant revisions and permit renewals, it is assumed that incorporating GHG 
information adds 9 hours, or an additional 10% to the current updating and processing time. For 
more information on the methods used to calculate ICR costs for permitting authorities for title V 
permitting, see Attachment C -“Summary of ICR-based Data Used to Estimate Avoided Burden 
and Evaluate Resource Requirements at Alternative GHG Permitting Thresholds”. 
The cost savings for permitting authorities are summarized in Table 3-1 and are estimated to 
exceed $15 billion (2007$).  Costs avoided for permitting authorities at alternative threshold 
levels are also shown on Table 3-1.

3-2. Information Collection Costs Associated with the NSR Program 

This proposed rulemaking limits the new sources requiring PSD permits to those that 

meet a potential to emit threshold of 25,000 tpy CO2e with a significance level for modifications 
from 10,000 to 25,000 tpy CO2e considered.  (Note: a significance level of 25,000 tpy CO2e is 
assumed for analysis purposes.)  Table 3-2 summarizes the estimated avoided burden cost 
afforded to small sources and permitting authorities by this proposed rule.  The estimated burden 
or reporting and recordkeeping costs avoided by small GHG sources amounts to over $900 
million annually with the burden costs per permit expected to be $131 thousand for new sources, 
$84.5 thousand for modified industrial sources, $21.9 thousand for new commercial or 
residential sources and $16.9 thousand for modifying commercial or residential sources (2007$).    
State, local and tribal permitting authorities are expected to avoid administrative costs of $249 
million annually.   

Burden estimates for the PSD program permitting authorities are calculated based on 

listed values obtained from Tables 6-1 and 6-2 the August 2008 Information Collection Request 
for Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR)6. NSR 
ICR at 18-19.  It is assumed that permit preparation and issuance for commercial/residential 
permits requires only 20% of the time necessary to prepare and issue industrial source permits 
since commercial/residential sources would likely be less complex in terms of numbers and types 
of emission sources and control requirements. Estimates obtained are additional burden and costs 
to those currently experienced by permitting authorities and sources.  For more information on 
the estimates of ICR costs for PSD permits see Attachment C.  Avoided costs for regulatory 
alternatives of <10,000 tpy and 50,000tpy CO2e potential to emit are also shown on Table 3-2.  
The PSD estimated costs represent annual estimates of costs avoided for sources and permitting 
authorities. 

This rule also alleviates the regulatory burden associated with complying with NSR 

BACT requirements for small new and modifying sources. The BACT costs foregone are not 
estimated or shown in Table 3-2 due to the significant uncertainties involved in these 
requirements for affected sources.  Likewise the foregone emission reductions associated with

Section 4 

Impacts of Regulatory Relief 

This proposed rulemaking does not impose economic impacts on any sources or 

permitting authorities, but should be instead be viewed as regulatory relief for smaller GHG 
emission sources.  This RIA illustrates the burden impacts avoided as a result of this proposed 
rule.  The avoided impacts of extending these programs for state, local, and tribal permitting 
authorities are also reported.  To estimate the avoided economic impacts, which include small 
business impacts, EPA conducted an assessment estimating cost-to-sales ratios by comparing the 
estimated total annualized compliance cost per permit per source avoided to industry average 
revenues per establishment.  The EPA also evaluated cost-to-sales ratios by comparing burden 
costs to revenues of firms at different firm size categories recognizing that the sources required 
to comply with these CAA provisions are larger emissions sources and more likely to be large 
business entities.   

4-1. Method for Analyzing Avoided Economic and Small Entity Impacts 

EPA used cost-to-sales comparisons to evaluate the potential impacts to sources affected 

by this rule.  Since this regulatory action provides regulatory relief, these cost-to-sales ratios 
represent the economic impacts that are avoided or postponed for small GHG sources as a result 
of this rule.  For all regulatory actions, EPA must determine whether a rule will have a 
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (SISNOSE).  This rule provides 
regulatory relief to small sources and thus does not have a significant impact to a substantial 
number of small entities. The approach for estimating the postponed economic impacts and the 
small entity analysis are the same for this analysis.  The steps followed include, gathering data to 
characterize the affected entities by size, selecting and describing the measures and economic 
impact thresholds used in the analysis, and determining cost-to-sales ratios for the affected 
industrial, commercial and residential categories. 

4-1.1 Identifying Affected Sectors and Entities 

The industrial, commercial and residential sectors covered by the rule were identified 

during the development of the cost analysis for the rule. For the industrial sector, these sources 

 

20

are summarized with applicable NAICS codes in Table 4-1 through 4-4.  For commercial and 
residential sources, the sources are listed in Tables 4-5 through 4-8.  

4-1.2. Data Used to Characterize Affected Entities by Size 

The Census Bureau’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB) data provide national 

information on the distribution of economic variables by industry and size.7 Specifically, the 
tables report data for each industry on the number of firms (Table 4-1), number of establishments 
(Table 4-2), employment (Table 4-3), and receipts (Table 4-4) by enterprise size category in 
affected sectors.  Similar results are shown for commercial and residential sources on Tables 4-5 
through 4-8. The census definitions in these data elements are as follows: 

  establishment: An establishment is a single physical location where business is 

conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.  

  employment: Paid employment consists of full- and part-time employees, including 
salaried officers and executives of corporations, who were on the payroll in the pay 
period including March 12. Included are employees on sick leave, holidays, and 
vacations; not included are proprietors and partners of unincorporated businesses. 

  receipts: Receipts (net of taxes) are defined as the revenue for goods produced, 

distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes.  

  enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 

domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments.8 

The SBA small business size standard(s) is provided for each industry group in order to facilitate 
comparisons and different thresholds.  

                                                 
 
7 These data were developed in cooperation with, and partially funded by, the Office of Advocacy of the Small 

Business Administration (SBA). 

8 Because the SBA’s business size definitions (SBA, 2008c) apply to an establishment’s “ultimate parent company,” 
we assume in this analysis that the “enterprise” definition above is consistent with the concept of ultimate parent 
company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening 
analyses and the terms are used interchangeably. 

 

21

The receipt data are reported in 2002 dollars. Therefore, to adjust to 2007 dollars for 

comparison to costs, the EPA utilized the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index 
(CPI).  Using the annual U.S. city average price index for all consumer goods revenues are 
adjusted to 2007 dollars.   

Because the SBA’s business size definitions (SBA, 2008c) apply to an establishment’s 
“ultimate parent company,” we assume in this analysis that the “enterprise” definition above is 
consistent with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses and the terms are used 
interchangeably. We also report the SBA size standard(s) for each industry group, to facilitate 
comparisons and different thresholds.

The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the 
establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated 
establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent with the 
concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses.  SBA size standards as of 8/11/08. 
1: NAICS codes 221111, 221112, 221113, 221119, 221121, 221122 – A firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy 
for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours. 
2:  500 to 1,500.  For NAICS code 324110 – For purposes of Government procurement, the petroleum refiner must be a concern that has 1,500 employees or less or has 125,000 barrels per calendar day or 
less total Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation capacity. Capacity includes owned or leased facilities as well as facilities under a processing agreement or an arrangement such as an exchange 
agreement or a throughput. The total product to be delivered under the contract must be at least 90 percent refined by the successful bidder from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks. 
3. NAICS Subsectors 333, 334, 335 and 336 – For rebuilding machinery or equipment on a factory basis, or equivalent, use the NAICS code for a newly manufactured product. Concerns performing major 
rebuilding or overhaul activities do not necessarily have to meet the criteria for being a "manufacturer" although the activities may be classified under a manufacturing NAICS code. Ordinary repair services 
or preservation are not considered rebuilding. 
4:  Subsector 486 – Pipeline Transportation (486110 Pipeline Transportation of Crude Oil 1,500, 486210 Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas $7.0 million , 486910 Pipeline Transportation of Refined 
Petroleum Products 1,500, 486990 All Other Pipeline Transportation $34.5 million)

The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the establishment 
are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent with the concept 
of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses.  SBA small entity definitions as of 8/11/08. 
1: NAICS codes 221111, 221112, 221113, 221119, 221121, 221122 – A firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale 
and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours. 
2:  500 to 1,500.  For NAICS code 324110 – For purposes of Government procurement, the petroleum refiner must be a concern that has 1,500 employees or less or 125,000 barrels or less per calendar day total 
Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation capacity. Capacity includes owned or leased facilities as well as facilities under a processing agreement or an arrangement such as an exchange agreement or a 
throughput. The total product to be delivered under the contract must be at least 90 percent refined by the successful bidder from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks. 
3. NAICS Subsectors 333, 334, 335 and 336 – For rebuilding machinery or equipment on a factory basis, or equivalent, use the NAICS code for a newly manufactured product. Concerns performing major rebuilding 
or overhaul activities do not necessarily have to meet the criteria for being a "manufacturer" although the activities may be classified under a manufacturing NAICS code. Ordinary repair services or preservation are 
not considered rebuilding. 
4:  Subsector 486 – Pipeline Transportation (486110 Pipeline Transportation of Crude Oil 1,500, 486210 Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas $7.0 million , 486910 Pipeline Transportation of Refined Petroleum 
Products 1,500, 486990 All Other Pipeline Transportation $34.5 million)

The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the 
establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated 
establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent 
with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses.  SBA size categories as of 8/11/08.

The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the 
establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated 
establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent 
with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses. SBA small business sizes as of 8/11/08.

The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the 
establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the associated 
establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent

4-2.  Developing Economic and Small Entity Regulatory Relief Impact Measures 

We measured the postponed impacts of the rule on small entities in each sector using 

methods presented in EPA’s Final SBREFA Guidance. (EPA, 2006) Because the rule covers a 
large number of sectors and primarily covers businesses, the analysis generated a set of sales tests 
(represented as cost-to-receipt ratios)9 for NAICS codes associated with the affected sectors. 
Although the appropriate SBA size definition should be applied at the parent company 
(enterprise) level, data limitations allowed us only to compute and compare ratios for a model 
establishment for six enterprise size ranges (i.e., all categories, enterprises with 1 to 20 
employees, 20 to 99 employees, 100 to 499 employees, 500 to 999 employees, and 1,000 to 1,499 
employees. This approach allows us to account for differences in establishment receipts between 
large and small enterprises and differences in small business definitions across affected industries. 
It is also a conservative approach, because an establishment’s parent company (the “enterprise”) 
may have other economic resources that could be used to cover the costs of the reporting 
program. 

4-3. 

Implementing the Sales Test to Measure Impacts on Industrial, Commercial and Multi-

family Residential Sources 

To implement the recommended sales test, EPA computed cost-to-sales ratios for affected 

sectors at the establishment (or facility) level.10 The ratios examine the ratio of the average 
establishment’s total annualized mandatory reporting costs to the average establishment receipts 
for enterprises within several employment categories11 . The average entity costs used to compute 
the sales test are the same across all of these enterprise size categories. As a result, the sales-test 
will overstate the cost-to-receipt ratio for establishments owned by small businesses, because the 
reporting costs are likely lower than average entity estimates provided by the engineering cost 
analysis.  
                                                 
 
9The following metrics for other small entity economic impact measures (if applicable) would potentially include 
  Small governments (if applicable): “Revenue” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 

  Small non-profits (if applicable): “Expenditure” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 

government revenues 

operating expenses 

10 Typically, SBREFA impact assessments are conducted at the ultimate parent company level. As noted above, we 

assume that Census definition of enterprise is equivalent to ultimate parent company. Theoretically, the 
comparison of compliance costs to sales should be conducted at the enterprise level. Because Census only 
provides data for typical establishments within various enterprise size categories, EPA chose to compute the 
cost-to-sales ratio at the establishment (or facility level). The same ratio could be computed at the enterprise level 
by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the typical number of establishments per enterprise in 
the appropriate enterprise size categories. Using the SUSB data on typical establishments means that the cost-to-
sales ratios are identical, whether computed at the establishment level or at the enterprise level. 

11For the one to 20 employee category, we exclude SUSB data for enterprises with zero employees. These 

enterprises did not operate the entire year. 

 

39

Cost-to-sales ratios for industrial categories are reported in Tables 4-9 through 4-11.  

Table 4-9 shows impacts avoided for small sources of GHGs for title V.  On Tables 4-10 and 4-11 
impacts avoided for new and modifying PSD sources, respectively are presented.  These ratios are 
calculated using data on the average avoided cost of compliance per facility, and data on the 
average sales per establishment obtained from the Census Bureau.  Cost-to-sales or Revenue 
ratios for commercial and residential categories are reported in Tables 4-12 through 4-14. Table 
4-12 shows impacts avoided for small commercial and residential sources of GHGs for Title V.  
Tables 4-13 and 4-14 shows impacts avoided for modifying and new PSD commercial and 
residential sources, respectively.  

The total national burden avoided per-entity costs of the rule are shown on Table 3-1.  

For title V, the avoided burden costs associated with obtaining an operating permit is $46.4 
thousand per source for industrial sources of GHG emissions and approximately $5 thousand for 
commercial and residential sources.  For modifying PSD sources, the avoided burden costs with 
obtaining a permit is $84.5 thousand per source for industrial sources of GHG emissions and 
$16.9 thousand per source for commercial and residential sources.  Finally, for new PSD sources, 
the avoided burden costs are the sum of the avoided title V and modifying PSD costs.  Thus, the 
avoided burden costs are approximately $130.8 thousand per source for industrial sources of 
GHG emissions and approximately $22 thousand per source for commercial and residential 
sources.  

The cost-to-sales estimates show that the avoided costs for industrial sources typically are 

up to 2 percent of their sales, but they can be as high as 53 percent for certain sources (e.g., 
aluminum plants with less than 20 employees).  For commercial sources,  the avoided costs are 
typically up to 1 percent of their sales or revenues, but they can be as high as 9 percent for 
certain sources (e.g., refrigerated warehouses).   

 

4-4.  Economic Relief to Permitting Authorities 

 

 

In this proposal the thresholds for requiring title V and PSD permits are increased to 
25,000 tpy CO2e potential to emit resulting in millions of potential title V sources and tens of 
thousands of new and modifying PSD sources being able to postpone obtaining a permit for a 
period of at least six years.  This action will provide significant regulatory relief to States, local 
government, and tribal permitting authorities.  The magnitude of permits that would need to be 

 

40

addressed and the dollar estimate of the additional costs in labor and administrative costs 
permitting authorities would otherwise incur if GHG are a regulated pollutant absent this 
rulemaking are shown in Tables 3-1 and 3-2 above.   

For title V permits, permitting authorities will experience avoided costs of approximately 

$15.6 billion dollars relating to approximately 6 million new operating permits that otherwise 
would need to be processed.  While this administrative burden represents a huge burden to these 
agencies, Part 70 of the CAA does provide for a mechanism for the affected permitting 
authorities to recoup the costs of operation associated with administering this expanded permit 
program.  The EPA recognizes in this tailoring rule that the sheer magnitude and burden of these 
additional small GHG sources cannot feasibly be met by these permitting authorities on 
administrative burden grounds for a period of at least five years regardless of the ability to 
include these increased costs in fees charged to sources.  However, the economic consequences 
to permitting authorities of this permitting program are offset in the fee structure these authorities 
are allowed to charge sources obtaining title V permits.      

 

 For PSD permitting authorities no such mitigating fee structure currently exists.  Thus, 
the funding for administering a PSD permitting program to include tens of thousands additional 
new and modifying PSD sources annually would need to be met by these permitting authorities 
from current revenues sources. At present, there are approximately 58 State, local and tribal PSD 
permitting programs operating in the U.S. and approximately 49 additional State, local or tribal 
government authorities that are administering federal programs under delegation from the EPA.  
It is difficult to estimate the economic consequences of the regulatory relief afforded to the 
individual permitting authorities, because the number of PSD permits processed each year varies 
by permitting authority over time depending upon the number of new and modifying sources 
occurring in a given location.  However, the National Association of Clean Air Agencies 
(NACAA) has, through a member survey, broadly assessed the additional resource and burden 
considerations of EPA treating GHG as a regulated pollutant.   NACAA provided this 
information to EPA to help improve our understanding of agencies’ burdens.12  Under the current 
PSD program requirements, these permitting authorities process an average of 8 PSD permits for 
new and modifying sources each year (range of 0 to 56 for individual respondents).  These

Group, U.S. EPA OAQPS.  September 3, 2009.

surveyed permitting authorities indicate they would need an average of 12 new full time 
employees (range of 1 to 63) costing an average of $1.1 million annually (range $60 thousand to 
$6.3 million) with a 10 fold increase in permits occurring due to including GHG as a regulated 
pollutant.  Some of these permitting authorities indicated that hiring new employees is not 
possible at this time due to budget constraints and hiring freezes.  All respondents indicated that 
new training would be needed to address GHGs permitting.  Rather than the 10 fold increase in 
permits postulated in NACAA’s survey, the EPA estimates the increase would more likely be 
140 fold making these estimates a significant understatement of the potential impacts on 
permitting authorities.

Footnotes for Tables 4-9. through 4-11. 
NA – Not available. 
The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were 
specified under common ownership or control. The enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. 
Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual payroll are summed from the 
associated establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate 
parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition above is consistent with the 
concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses. 
1: NAICS codes 221111, 221112, 221113, 221119, 221121, 221122 – A firm is small if, 
including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or 
distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal 
 
year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours. 
2:  500 to 1,500.  For NAICS code 324110 – For purposes of Government procurement, the petroleum refiner 
must be a concern that has no more than 1,500 employees nor more than 125,000 barrels 
per calendar day total Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation capacity. Capacity 
includes owned or leased facilities as well as facilities under a processing agreement or 
an arrangement such as an exchange agreement or a throughput. The total product to be 
delivered under the contract must be at least 90 percent refined by the successful bidder 
from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks. 
3. NAICS Subsectors 333, 334, 335 and 336 – For rebuilding machinery or equipment on a factory basis, or equivalent, 
use the NAICS code for a newly manufactured product. Concerns performing major rebuilding or overhaul activities do 
not necessarily have to meet the criteria for being a "manufacturer" although the activities may be classified under a 
manufacturing NAICS code. Ordinary repair services or preservation are not considered rebuilding. 
4:  Subsector 486 – Pipeline Transportation (486110 Pipeline Transportation of Crude Oil 1,500, 
486210 Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas $7.0 million , 486910 Pipeline Transportation of 
Refined Petroleum Products 1,500, 486990 All Other Pipeline Transportation $34.5 million)

Footnotes for Tables 4-12-4-14 
The Census Bureau defines an enterprise as a business organization consisting of one or more domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control.  
The enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each multi-establishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and annual  
payroll is summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated establishments. 
Since the SBA’s business size definitions (http://www.sba.gov/size) apply to an establishment’s ultimate parent company, we assume in this analysis that the enterprise definition 
above is consistent with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) screening analyses. 
NAICS code 611519 – Job Corps Centers. For classifying a Federal procurement, the purpose of the solicitation must be for the management and operation of a U.S. Department  
of Labor Job Corps Center. The activities involved include admissions activities, life skills training, educational activities, comprehensive career preparation activities, career 
development activities, career transition activities, as well as the management and support functions and services needed to operate and maintain the facility. For SBA assistance  
as small business concern, other than for Federal Government procurements, a concern must be primarily engaged in providing the services to operate and maintain Federal Job 
Corps Centers 
NAICS code 541711 and 541712 – For research and development contracts requiring the delivery of a manufactured product, the appropriate size standard is that of the  
manufacturing industry.

 Social Costs 

EPA examined the social costs of this proposed rule.  For this proposal, the social costs 
represent the foregone environmental benefits that would occur if regulatory relief were offered 
to small sources of GHG emissions as proposed. This proposal is one of regulatory relief since it 
increases the emissions thresholds for the title V and PSD programs, as they apply to sources of 
GHGs, to levels above those in the CAA.  Previous sections have discussed the avoided cost of 
such relief, but there is also a social cost imposed by such relief because this rule may forego 
some of the possible benefits associated with title V and PSD programs for sources of GHG 
emissions below 25,000 tpy CO2e but above the statutory 100/250 tpy levels.  These benefits are 
those attributed to title V and PSD permitting programs in general.  These benefits are based 
upon the relevance of these programs to policymaking, transparency issues, and market 
efficiency, and therefore are very difficult to quantify and monetize.  For title V, they include the 
benefits of improved compliance with CAA requirements that stem from (1) improved clarity 
regarding applicability of requirements, (2) discovery and required correction of noncompliance 
prior to receiving a permit, (3) improving monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting concerning 
compliance status, (4) self-certification of compliance with applicable requirements initially and 
annually, and prompt reporting of deviations from permit requirements, (5) enhanced 
opportunity for the public to understand and monitor sources’ compliance obligations, and (6) 
improved ability of EPA, permitting authorities, and the public to enforce CAA requirements.  
However, it is important to remember that a title V permit does not add new requirements for 
pollution control itself, but rather collects all of a facility’s applicable requirements under the 
CAA in one permit.  Therefore, the compliance benefits above are less when title V permits 
contains few or no CAA applicable requirements.  During the first phase under this proposal, 
when the title V threshold is 25,000 tpy, we expect that the vast majority of sources excluded 
from title V would be sources that have no CAA applicable requirements for GHG emissions and 
few or no requirements for other pollutants because their emissions of those pollutants are so 
small.  For this reason while it is extremely difficult to measure the degree of improved 
compliance, if any, that would be foregone, or to quantify the social costs that would be imposed, 
we expect that they would be negligible. 

 54

 
For PSD, the primary social cost imposed by the tailoring rule stems from the foregone 
benefit of applying BACT to the tens of thousands of small new sources and modifications that 
will be below our proposed thresholds during the first phase.  This social cost potentially weighs 
against the cost savings described above that stem (in part) from avoiding the administrative and 
control costs of applying BACT to these sources.  The BACT requirement assures that new and 
modified sources, when they increase their emissions are using state-of-the-art emission controls 
and affords the public an opportunity to comment on the control decision.  It does not prohibit 
increases but it assures that such controls are applied.  Delaying the BACT requirement for 
numerous small sources during the first phase of this proposed rule could allow increases from 
these smaller sources that are greater than they would be if BACT were applied.  A detailed 
analysis of this difference is beyond the scope of this rule because we do not have detailed 
information on the universe of these tens of thousands of small PSD actions, the candidate 
BACT technologies for each of them, how permitting authorities would make the BACT 
decisions, and how the BACT limit would compare to what would otherwise be installed absent 
BACT.  Below we present an illustrative example of how BACT impacts might be determined 
for sources that would be excluded from review under the tailoring rule.  This example illustrates 
the difficulty in quantifying the social costs of avoided BACT, but helps explain the nature of 
such costs. 

To assess the effect of avoided BACT, we would identify the universe of source types 

that are affected by the tailoring rule.  More specifically, we would have to project the number of 
various source types (within those affected by the tailoring rule) that would actually be 
constructing or modifying. We have generally characterized these sources as part of the tailoring 
rule threshold evaluation, and have determined a large proportion of these to consist of small 
commercial and residential sources.  This determination was based on rough energy usage data, 
but to assess BACT, we would require more specific information about the proposed equipment 
that will actually be emitting GHG (e.g., water heaters, furnaces, cooking equipment, dryers, 
etc.) and more specific characterization would be subject to a very high degree of uncertainty. 
Following characterization of new and modified sources, we would need to determine, 
for each category of source, what GHG control technologies are available for such equipment.  
For commercial sources, we may have to determine commercial availability of a range of lower 
emitting processes, more efficient technologies, and other techniques for improving energy 

 55

efficiency.  Next, we would assess affected sources capital and operating costs of control options 
and determine energy and environmental impacts.  Finally, we would need to apply judgment (as 
the permitting authority would do in each case) to select the technology that represented the 
maximum degree of control taking the costs, energy and environmental impacts into account. 

The social cost component of the impact of foregoing BACT for sources that construct or 

modify during the first phase would be represented by the difference between the increased 
emissions that would result from such proposed sources absent BACT and the increase that 
would be allowed under the BACT requirement.  However, while we can point to the existence 
of such differences, we cannot quantify them (though as explained below we expect that overall 
they will be very limited in scope and magnitude).  Since there has been no regulatory 
experience with controlling GHG emissions from these sources, and limited permitting 
experience of any kind with mandatory control requirements on smaller commercial and 
residential sources, we are not in position at this point to identify the specific control 
technologies and quantify this difference to estimate the greater increases that might occur in the 
absence of applying the BACT process to these sources across the country.  In addition, since the 
PSD BACT review and selection process is implemented on a case-by-case basis, there is 
additional uncertainty in predicting program-wide reductions because even for similar sources, 
permitting authorities may, ultimately weigh the BACT factors differently and adopt different 
control measures.  
 
BACT.  However we note that the universe of possible emissions that would be regulated by 
sources excluded under the tailoring rule is small compared to those that would remain subject to 
PSD.  The sources excluded in the first phase of this proposal comprise only 7 percent of total 
stationary source GHG emissions, while 68 percent remain subject to regulation.   Furthermore, 
we expect the emissions differences due to BACT controls for such sources to be relatively small 
due to the lack of available capture and control technologies for GHG at such sources that are 
akin to those that exist for conventional pollutants and sources, as well as the likelihood that 
even in the absence of BACT such sources would already be installing relatively efficient GHG 
technologies to save on fuel costs.  Thus, while potential benefits would be foregone by 
excluding smaller sources from the permitting programs, these benefits are likely to be small.  
Under the tailoring rule, we will be working during the six-year period to greatly improve our 

For all these reasons, it is not possible at this time to quantify the social costs of avoided 

 56

Since the EPA is unable to quantify these GHG emission reductions foregone at this time 

understanding of both the administrative costs of regulating and the social costs of not regulating 
smaller sources under PSD and Title V, and we will be relying on that information to support our 
future threshold analyses called for under the proposal.    
 
due to these uncertainties involved in this estimation, it is also not possible to provide a 
monetized estimate of the foregone benefits or social costs of this rule.  If such emission 
reductions foregone were quantified, the EPA could use a social cost of carbon benefit estimates 
such as those used in the “Proposed Rulemaking to Establish Light Duty Vehicle Greenhouse 
Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards”13 recently published 
to compute the dollar value associated with the social costs of this proposed rule.  Nonetheless, 
we expect that the value would be small because, as discussed above, the emissions differences 
from which this value would be computed are small. 

In reaching the decisions for this GHG tailoring rule, the EPA recognizes the GHG 

emissions can remain in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, meaning that their 
concentrations become well-mixed throughout the global atmosphere regardless of emission 
origin, and their effects on climate are long lasting and significant.  A detailed explanation of 
climate change and its impact on health, society, and the environment is included in EPA's 
technical support document for the endangerment finding proposal (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-
OAR-2009-0171). The EPA recognizes the importance of reducing climate change emissions for 
all sources of GHG emissions including those sources afforded regulatory relief in this rule and 
plans to address potential emission reductions from these small sources using voluntary and 
energy efficiency approaches.  Elsewhere, we have discussed EPA's interest in continuing to use 
regulatory and/or non-regulatory tools for reducing emissions from smaller GHG sources 
because we believe that these tools will likely result in more efficient and cost-effective 
regulation than would case-by-case permitting.

Technical Support Document for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Thresholds Evaluation 

 
 

 

1.  Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to provide the background information that was used to 

 
 
support EPA's decision process in evaluating and selecting proposed greenhouse gas (GHG) 
major source applicability thresholds for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and 
Title V permitting programs as part of its proposed rule “Prevention of Significant Deterioration 
and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule” (GHG Tailoring Rule).  The document describes 
the methodology used to estimate the number of existing and new facilities (e.g., industrial plant 
or commercial building) that would exceed different GHG emission threshold levels.  The 
document also summarizes the results of this analysis for each sector.  The results of this analysis 
served as one of the bases for evaluating administrative burdens at both existing permitting 
thresholds under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and for evaluating and selecting proposed alternative 
permitting thresholds to address administrative necessity concerns. 
 

2.  Overview 

In order to support EPA's assessment of the administrative burden created by adding 

Eight threshold levels ranging from 100 to 100,000 tons per year of GHG emissions were 

 
 
GHGs to existing PSD and Title V permitting programs, it was necessary to develop information 
on the number of affected facilities at both the current CAA permitting major source thresholds 
(generally, 100 tons per year for Title V and 100 or 250 tons per year for PSD depending on the 
source category classification) and at alternative higher thresholds.  An affected facility would be 
one who's annual emissions of the GHG equal or exceed the major source threshold being 
evaluated. 
 
 
evaluated.  Some of the alternative thresholds evaluated are the same as ones (e.g., 25,000 tons 
per year CO2-equivalents) considered in previous studies and in support of EPA's proposed GHG 
Mandatory Reporting Rule (GHG MRR, 74 FR 68, Pages 16447 – 16731).  One key difference 
between the emissions data developed for this analysis and the emissions data developed to 
support the proposed GHG MRR is that this analysis is based on a facility's "potential to emit" 
(PTE) while the proposed GHG reporting rule is based on "actual" emissions (i.e., the emissions 
a facility actually emits in a given year).  PTE is defined as the maximum capacity of a stationary 
source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design, including certain legal 
limitations, for example, on emissions or hours of operation.  PSD and Title V programs both use 
PTE for defining major sources.  The end result is generally that more facilities will exceed a 
given threshold on a PTE basis than on an actual basis.  This is an important differentiation in 
terms of both evaluating the thresholds under this proposed rule and when comparing the results 
to other threshold analysis, such as the supporting data for the EPA's proposed GHG MRR. 

 

4

 
 
Although the primary focus of this analysis was on the potential administrative burden 
associated with different GHG permitting emission levels as represented in terms of number of 
facilities potentially subject to permitting, information on GHG emissions from affected facilities 
was also collected to assess the relative coverage of national stationary source GHG emissions at 
the different threshold levels.  While the environmental impact associated with the different 
GHG permitting levels was not used as the basis for the proposed temporary GHG thresholds in 
the proposed GHG Tailoring Rule, the information on national emissions coverage provides a 
useful measure to consider the potential scope of the proposed alternative thresholds, their 
coverage of key GHG emission source categories, and whether they promote the environmental 
purposes of the PSD and Title V programs. 
 

3.  Emissions-based Threshold Analysis 

3.1  General Description of Overall Approach 

 

 

This section presents a general description of the overall approach EPA used to evaluate a 

range of permitting thresholds in terms of the number of sources affected, and amount of 
emissions covered. 

 
EPA made use of earlier analyses performed to develop emission thresholds for the 

proposed GHG MRR, or used the same data sources when additional analyses were required.  
EPA did not conduct primary research for this analysis, but instead relied on published research 
and publicly available government data, such as EPA's eGRID database of electric generating 
source emissions, Economic and Housing Census data, and Energy Information Agency (EIA) 
data on energy consumption. 

 

5

 

3.1.1  Threshold Levels 

 
 
 
 
 

 

EPA evaluated eight different potential to emit thresholds: 

GHG Thresholds 
(tons per year) 
 
100 
250 
1,000 
5,000 
10,000 
25,000 
50,000 
100,000 

The first two thresholds (100 and 250 tons per year) are the current Clean Air Act major 
source criteria pollutant thresholds for the federal operating permit program under Title V, and 
the PSD construction permit program under Title I. 

 
The six additional thresholds cover the range of thresholds evaluated for the proposed 

GHG MRR, and add two additional thresholds at 5,000 and 50,000 tons per year.  Like the Clean 
Air Act, the permit thresholds are based on U.S. short tons (tons) instead of metric tons (mtons). 
 

There is a three-orders-of-magnitude range in the thresholds which reflects the much 
higher quantity of GHG emissions compared to criteria pollutant emissions from the primary 
source of GHG emissions, fossil fuel combustion.  For example, an uncontrolled natural gas-
fired boiler that emits 100 tons of NOx annually would at the same time emit about 100,000 tons 
of CO2. 
 
 
The threshold analysis of source counts and emissions was done on a "potential to emit" 
basis, because that is the basis that is relevant for the permit rule.  Potential emissions (in short 
tons) from each source were evaluated against the threshold levels in order to determine whether 
or not a source would be included in the threshold count.  When a source was identified as being 
covered by a given threshold level, the actual emissions from that source were included to 
determine the emissions covered by the threshold.  In other words, where summary tables present 
"Tg GHG Emissions Covered per Year" these are the actual emissions that would be covered by 
the threshold level, given the source count arrived at considering potential to emit emission 
levels.

3.1.2  Greenhouse Gases 

 
EPA evaluated emissions of the major GHGs that are directly emitted by human activities 
at the eight threshold levels.  The GHGs evaluated are shown below in Table 1.  For purposes of 
this analysis emissions were evaluated on both an individual GHG mass basis and CO2-
equivalent basis (CO2e).  CO2e normalizes the different heat trapping capacities of the different 
GHGs to that of CO2.  A quantity of a GHG is converted to a CO2e basis by multiplying the mass 
of the compound emitted by its Global Warming Potential (GWP).  The GWP is a metric that 
incorporates both the heat-trapping ability and atmospheric lifetime of each GHG relative to 
CO2.

*  EPA has chosen to use GWPs published in the Intergovernmental Panel on 

Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment Report (SAR) published in 
1996.  For those fluorinated compounds that are not listed in the SAR, EPA 
is using the most recent available GWPs, either the IPCC Third Assessment 
Report (2001) or Fourth Assessment Report (2007).  For more specific 
information about the GWP of specific GHGs, please see Table A-1 in the 
proposed GHG MRR. 

 
 
Sector descriptions contained in this document include a discussion of GHGs evaluated 

 
for each sector.  If the analysis included more than one GHG, the description includes gas-
specific counts as well as a CO2e count.  The threshold analyses for stationary fossil fuel 
combustion were simplified by excluding CH4 and N2O emissions, because CO2 comprises over 
99 percent of GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion.

3.1.3  Source Sectors  

 
In this analysis EPA evaluated the same range of stationary source types with direct GHG 
emissions as identified in the proposed GHG MRR.  The proposed GHG MRR source categories 
were based on a comprehensive review of all U.S. source categories with GHG emissions, to 
include the categories that emit the most significant amount of GHG emissions.  The stationary 
sources evaluated in this analysis can be grouped in the sectors shown below: 

●  Electricity Generation (facilities with fossil fuel-fired electric generating units); 
●  Industry (range of industries with process and combustion GHG emissions); 
●  Energy (oil and gas extraction, transport, and processing; underground coal mining); 
●  Waste Treatment (landfills and municipal solid waste incinerators); 
●  Agriculture (stationary fuel combustion); 
●  Commercial (stationary fuel combustion); and 
●  Residential (stationary fuel combustion). 

 

 

A number of direct emission source types included in the proposed reporting rule analysis 

 
were not included in the potential to emit analysis because the GHG emissions from these 
sources were primarily fugitive emissions.  Fugitive emissions are emissions which are not 
released, or could not be reasonably released, through a stack or vent.  Under the PSD rules, 
fugitive emissions are only included in potential to emit estimates if the source is one of 28 listed 
PSD source categories.  Excluded fugitive emissions sources are listed below: 
 

●  Electrical equipment SF6 emissions; 
 
●  Wastewater treatment plants not associated with one of 28 listed PSD source categories 

(combustion is captured in the commercial sector analysis); and 

 
●  Agricultural manure management. 
 

3.1.4  Potential to Emit Methodology 

 
As noted earlier, the potential to emit (PTE) is the amount of emissions that can be 

emitted from a source operating at full capacity.  The annual PTE is based on operation at full 
equipment capacity, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year (8,760 hours per year).  For example, if 
a boiler has a maximum rated heat input capacity of ten million Btu per hour, the annual PTE for 
that boiler is the amount of emissions from burning 87,600 million Btu of fuel: 

 
10 mmBtu/hr x 8,760 hrs/yr = 87,600 mmBtu/yr 
 
Capacity information and annual GHG emissions were available for some of the source 

categories from analyses performed to support the proposed GHG MRR.  In some cases the 
supporting analyses had already calculated GHG emissions on a full capacity basis, in which 

 

8

case EPA directly used those estimates as PTE estimates.  Alternatively, some data from the 
supporting analysis estimated actual annual emissions using a baseline year.  If capacity and 
baseline year production information was provided in the supporting data, EPA adjusted the 
source actual emissions estimate by the ratio of annual capacity to baseline production to 
estimate PTE.  If capacity information was not available, EPA used capacity factors from other 
data sources to adjust actual emission estimates to PTE estimates.  These capacity factors add 
varying uncertainty to the PTE estimate.  Detailed descriptions of the different PTE calculation 
methodologies are included in the source descriptions in the following section. 

 
 
Removal by pollution control equipment was considered in the PTE estimates, though 
control equipment removal was relevant in only a few cases (thermal oxidation of HPCs and 
CH4).  Also, as noted earlier, fugitive emissions, were only included in the PTE estimates if the 
source was one of the 28 listed PSD source categories.  For example, fugitive CH4 emissions 
from oil and gas processing plants were not included in CH4 or CO2e emissions when comparing 
to the different thresholds, but were included for iron and steel plants. 
 

3.1.5  New and Modified Sources 

 
The source population data from the analyses supporting the proposed reporting rule 

analyses, and other data sources provide information on existing sources and their emissions.  
The PSD and NSR program construction permit requirements, however, apply to new or 
modified sources. 

The general approach for new sources was to apply growth rates in the number of units or 

facilities in a source category to the number of existing facilities at the different thresholds.  
Growth rates were available from a variety of sources including Economic Census data, EIA 
energy survey data, and various EPA regulatory impact analyses and information collection 
requests which require source population estimates.  In some cases there was sufficient 
information to distribute new sources to different thresholds based on emission information 
specific to the new sources (electric generating, municipal solid waste combustors, and 
commercial stationary fuel combustion).  Otherwise EPA assumed the same size and threshold 
distribution for new units as for existing units.  For example, if the annual growth rate in a 
category was one percent, the number of existing facilities above a threshold was multiplied by 
the fractional growth rate to estimate the number of new facilities at that threshold per year. 

 
EPA did not develop a method for estimating the number of modifications of existing 

sources for the permit threshold analysis. 

 

3.2  Threshold Summary Results 

 
The resulting counts of affected stationary source facilities and the amount of actual 

GHG emissions covered at different PTE thresholds for all sectors are shown in the tables below.  
GHG emissions covered at each threshold are in Tg, which is equivalent to million metric tons.

3.3  Electricity Generating Sector 

 

The latest version of EPA's eGRID database (2006) was used to estimate the PTE of 

Data Sources 
 
 
electricity generating facilities and counts of units above the different emission thresholds.  The 
eGRID database includes year 2004 characteristics, operating information, and annual emissions 
(including CO2) for U.S. facilities that have a generation capacity greater than one MW, and sell 
electric power to the grid.   
 
 
A facility's PTE was estimated based on the eGRID generator table.  The generator table, 
which is based on the 2004 EIA form 860 database, provides prime mover, generator nameplate 
capacity, and primary energy source (fuel type) for each generator down to 0.1 MW.  To 
calculate PTE, we combined the nameplate capacity and primary fuel for each of the fossil-fired 
units with average fuel based prime mover heat rates (Btu/kWh) published by EIA (EIA, 2007).

The eGRID database includes cogeneration plants and generating units at industrial 
plants that primarily supply electric power and steam to a host facility.  We eliminated these

Classification System (NAICS) code, so that the only facilities included were facilities with a 
NAICS code beginning with 22 (Utilities). 
 
 
cogeneration plants, where a portion of the burner heat input provides useful thermal energy in 
addition to electric output.  This potential to underestimate PTE affects 321 of 2,237 or 14 
percent of facilities evaluated. 
 
Methodology for Existing Facilities 
 
 
Fuel combustion was the only source of GHG emissions considered for the electricity 
generation sector.  From the eGRID and EIA information EPA calculated a maximum annual 
fuel heat input based on 8,760 hours of operation for the combustors associated with the 
generator.  This calculated maximum annual heat input was used with fuel combustion emission 
factors from the proposed reporting rule for the primary fuel, to calculate the facility PTE.  The 
calculations covered 10,487 fossil fuel-fired generators with nameplate capacities down to 0.1 
MW or 100,000 kW. 
 
 
fired steam electric plants with heat input greater than 250 mmBtu/hr heat input are one of the 28 
listed PSD source categories that include fugitive emissions when calculating PTE.  However, 
the CO2 PTE from combustion alone for this size facility is about 225,000 tons per year.  This is 

EPA also did not evaluate fugitive CH4 emissions from facility coal piles.  Fossil fuel-

 

13

well over all of the emission thresholds considered in this analysis without consideration of the 
contribution of fugitive CH4. 
 
New Units 
 
 
The eGRID generator table includes an online year field.  To determine the number of 
new units per year at different thresholds EPA counted generators online each year and totaled 
the emissions associated with those generators at the facility level over the 15-year period from 
1990 through 2004.  Counts were made of the number of these facilities over the different PTE 
thresholds, and averaged over the 15 years to arrive at the number of new or modified facilities 
per year.   
 
Threshold Summary 
 
The table below shows the facilities and emissions covered at the different emission 
 
thresholds based on the described methodology.  There were a total of 2,237 facilities in the 
electric generation population, so all facilities and all emissions are covered up to the 5,000 ton 
PTE threshold.  Almost all emissions (99.9 percent), and about 75 percent of facilities are 
covered at the highest 100,000 ton PTE threshold.

3.4  Industrial Sector 

 

The industrial sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or 

chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, and 
specifically includes businesses classified in Sectors 31 – 33 according to the North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Industrial source greenhouse gases result from 
manufacturing processes as well as combustion processes.  Because there is a great deal of 
variability within the sector, this technical support document includes industry-specific 
discussions after a general sector overview. 

 
For the industrial sector, EPA considered the six individual greenhouse gases separately, 

and also prepared an analysis considering CO2e.  In preparation of the GHG MRR, EPA 
identified 23 industrial sectors where the GHG emissions were significant; these sectors are 
listed in Table 9.

In addition, there are a large number of industrial establishments across all industrial 

sectors that emit less significant amounts of GHGs (primarily CO2) from stationary source fuel 
combustion.  Combustion emissions from these establishments were analyzed under the 
Unspecified Industrial Stationary Combustion source category.   

 

 

16

3.4.1  Data Sources 

 

There were several primary data sources used in preparation of the permit threshold 

analysis.  EPA consulted analyses prepared in support of the GHG MRR for the 23 industrial 
sectors for which combustion, process and fugitive emissions were significant.  These documents 
can be found in the docket numbered EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508.  The TSDs contain industry-
specific analyses of process, fugitive, and combustion emissions for industries.  Supporting 
analyses used to prepare the TSDs are found in entries 0046.7 and 0046.8 of the GHG MRR 
docket.  These emissions estimate details were helpful in breaking down TSD emission estimates 
to compare facility-specific emissions against the additional threshold levels considered in the 
permit threshold analysis, including 100, 250, 5,000, and 50,000 tons per year. 

 
Combustion emissions analyses for the Unspecified Industrial Stationary Combustion 
sectors used data from the 2002 Manufacturing Energy Combustion Survey (MECS) and the 
U.S. Census Bureau's 2002 Economic Census.  MECS is a survey of manufacturing and 
industrial energy uses and costs prepared by the EIA (EIA, 2007).  Data is collected by 
manufacturing establishment through mailed questionnaires.  The 2002 MECS data reflects 
responses accounting for approximately 98 percent of the manufacturing payroll, and reports 
separate energy use estimates for 48 NAICS industrial sector groups.  The MECS provided 
information on the amount of fuel burned in 2002 by sector on an employment basis.  The 2002 
Economic Census data provided information on the number of establishments sorted by three-
digit NAICS code and disaggregated into specific size categories based on employment (U.S. 
Census, 2004). 

 

3.4.2  Potential to Emit 

 

As mentioned earlier in this document, permit threshold analyses considered both actual 

emissions and PTE.  When capacity information was not available, the analyses applied 
utilization rates from the Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization, Federal Reserve 
Statistical Release G-17 in order to adjust actual emissions to determine PTE emissions.  These 
utilization rates are prepared quarterly with annual revisions, and are published on the web 
(http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17).  The main data source for the industrial production 
and capacity utilization rates is the U.S. Census Bureau's Census of Manufactures.  Data 
introduced from other Census Bureau publications include the Census of Services and the 
Services Annual Survey (for publishing) and selected Current Industrial Reports.  Additional 
government source data include new annual data on minerals from the U.S. Geological Survey 
(USGS) and updated deflators from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).  In addition, the 
annual revisions include monthly production estimates that reflect updated seasonal factors and 
the inclusion of monthly source data that became available (or were revised) after the closing of 
the regular four-month reporting window.  

 

17

3.4.3  Methodology for New Units 

To determine the number of new units per year, EPA compared the number of 

 
 
establishments by three-digit NAICS code in 1998 to the number of establishments by three-digit 
NAICS code in 2002, and determined an average annual growth rate for each three-digit NAICS 
code.  The growth rates were applied to each threshold count to determine the number of annual 
new establishments per industry per threshold.  If the growth rate was determined to be negative, 
EPA assumed that no new establishments would be added; however, establishments were not 
reduced to reflect negative growth rates.  EPA also supplemented these growth rates with agency 
estimates of expected new sources from various information collection requests (ICR) and 
regulatory impact analyses (RIA) efforts. 
 

3.5  Methodology for Existing Unspecified Industrial Stationary Combustion Source 

Category Emissions 

 
 
In order to determine establishment counts and emissions totals for the unspecified 
industrial stationary combustion sources, EPA used 2002 Economic Census data showing 
manufacturing employment by NAICS code and Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey 
(MECS) data published by EIA.  Calculating greenhouse gas emissions required determining 
energy consumption per employee by industry and applying emission factors specific to the 
consumption profile derived from MECS data. 
 

The Economic Census data (2002) provide a count of establishments by employment 

category, where employment category is defined by number of employees (e.g., 1 – 4,  
5 – 9,…,500 – 999,…,more than 2,500).  The MECS energy consumption data provide energy 
consumption by industry.  Both the employment data and the energy consumption data are 
organized according to the NAICS codes.   

 
As part of this analysis, EPA calculated industry-specific GHG emission factors.  The 

factors were calculated by considering actual fuel consumption in 2002, as determined by EIA.  
Actual fuel consumed was multiplied by fuel-specific GHG emission factors to determine GHG 
emissions by fuel type by industry.  To simplify the analysis, EPA only included CO2 emissions 
and ignored CH4 and N2O in the CO2e calculations.  CO2 makes up between 99.7 to 99.3 percent 
of estimated CO2e emissions.  Emissions for each fuel type were combined to determine total 
emissions for a sector.  Total emissions per sector were divided by total energy consumption per 
sector to determine a factor to calculate GHG emissions per mmBtu of energy consumption 
specific to the industrial sector. 

 
The GHG emission factors were then multiplied by the energy consumption per 

employee in order to determine emissions per employee.  Multiplying the result by the average 
number employees per establishment, EPA determined total GHG emissions per establishment.  

 

18

The total emissions numbers were used to determine number of establishments and volume of 
emissions that would be caught by each of the permit thresholds under consideration.   

 
As discussed previously, a separate threshold analysis was conducted for 23 industrial 
sectors determined to have significant GHG emissions in the GHG MRR analysis.  In order to 
quantify the unspecified industrial stationary combustion source emissions, the combustion 
emissions and establishment counts from 19 of these sectors were subtracted from the total 
industrial MECS analysis.  For the remaining four industries, HCFC-22 production, hydrogen 
production, magnesium production, and nitric acid production, EPA could not readily isolate 
combustion emissions.  For these industries, their establishment counts were subtracted from the 
unspecified industrial source threshold counts based on process emission threshold evaluations, 
assuming that any facility exceeding a threshold for process-based emissions would exceed the 
threshold regardless of their combustion CO2 emissions. 

Potential to Emit

 Methodology for Existing Specific Industrial Sectors Considering Combustion, Process 

and Fugitive Emissions 

These analyses were based primarily on the GHG MRR TSDs and the supporting 
analyses, including facility specific emission information.  The estimates considered each 
greenhouse gas separately.  The GHG MRR TSDs included threshold counts and emissions 
calculations for 1,000, 10,000, 25,000 and 100,000 metric tons per year.  Two steps were 
required for permit threshold consideration.  First, emissions were recalculated in order to 
conduct the analysis in short tons for comparison to the permit thresholds.  Second, the emissions 
were considered against the finer threshold stratification considered in the permit threshold 
analysis. 
 
For the permit threshold analysis, EPA determined that if the GHG MRR analysis 

showed all of the establishments exceeded a threshold, after adjustment for short tons, all of the 
establishments exceeded any lower thresholds.  However, where fewer than 100 percent of the 
establishments exceeded a threshold, additional analysis was required to compare emissions to 
the permit thresholds of 100, 250, 5,000, and 50,000 tons per year.  EPA used the supporting 
summaries for the GHG MRR which included facility-specific consumption, process, and 
fugitive emission reports in order to determine counts and emissions for each of the permit 
thresholds.

3.6.1  Adipic Acid Production 

There are four Adipic Acid Production plants in the U.S., all of which are estimated to 

 

Individual plant production and emission estimates were not made available because of 

The uncontrolled N2O emission factor is 300 kg N2O/mton adipic acid.  Based on the two 

 
exceed the highest 100,000 metric tons per year emission threshold for CO2e on an actual 
emissions basis.  Therefore all plants will also exceed all PTE thresholds on a CO2e basis.  The 
CO2e emission estimate includes N2O process emissions that total about 5.9 million metric tons 
CO2e, and 3.4 million metric tons of CO2 from stationary fuel combustion sources.   
 
N2O 
 
 
confidential business information (CBI) claims.  However, from the Technical Support 
Document for the Adipic Acid Production Sector:  Proposed Rule for Mandatory Reporting of 
Greenhouse Gases (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0005), overall U.S. adipic acid production was 
estimated to total approximately one million metric tons in 2006.  The smallest U.S. plant only 
produced about two percent of the total.  This plant, however, is the only plant that is 
uncontrolled.  The three larger plants with the bulk of production have control equipment with 
N2O control efficiencies that range from 90 to 99 percent.   
 
 
percent production share, this uncontrolled plant emitted about 6,000 metric tons of N2O (no 
GWP adjustment).  This leaves about 13,100 metric tons of N2O from the three larger controlled 
plants.  Two plants representing about 64 percent of production have control efficiencies in the 
range of 90 to 95 percent, and one plant with about 34 percent of production has control close to 
99 percent (EPA, 2001). 
 
 
assumed for this analysis to be equivalent to capacity) appears to range from 30 to 35 percent for 
the three plants.  Therefore, emissions and PTE for the controlled plants range from to 4,000 
metric tons to 4,700 metric tons of N2O per year. 
 
CO2 
 
 
The smallest plant, with only two percent of national production, is estimated at CO2 emissions 
of 67,500 metric tons, and the next smallest, with 30 percent of national production, is estimated 
at 101,300 metric tons. 
 
Potential to Emit 

The CO2 emissions from fuel combustion can similarly be apportioned to the four plants.  

Assuming similar production shares today, the share of national production (which is 

 
The PTE for each facility was assumed to be equivalent to the emissions based on the 

 
apportionment described above.

3.6.2  Aluminum Production 

The primary aluminum production process results in emissions of CO2 and PFCs.  The 

 
 
reduction of the alumina occurs through electrolysis in a molten bath of natural or synthetic 
cryolite (Na3AlF6).  The reduction cells contain a carbon lining that serves as the cathode.  
Carbon is also contained in the anode, which can be a carbon mass of paste, coke briquettes, or 
prebaked carbon blocks from petroleum coke.  During reduction, most of the carbon in the anode 
is oxidized and released to the atmosphere as CO2. 
 
Potential to Emit 
 
CO2 
 
The Technical Support Document for Process Emissions from Primary Production of 
 
Aluminum:  Proposed Rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (EPA-HQ-OAR-
2008-0508-0006) apportioned CO2 emission estimates from the U.S. GHG inventory to the 13 
operating smelters based on each smelters share of total capacity.  Operating smelter emissions 
were all above 100,000 tons of CO2, so no PTE estimate was required.  Capacity information for 
the two idle smelters shows that these smelters are also capable of emitting over 100,000 tons of 
CO2 per year. 
 
PFCs 
 

 

23

The reduction cells also emit two PFCs:  perfluoromethane (CF4) and perfluoroethane 

 
(C2F6).  The GWPs of the two PFCs are 6,500 and 9,200 respectively.  During the smelting 
process, when the alumina ore content of the electrolytic bath falls below critical levels required 
for electrolysis, rapid voltage increases occur, which are termed "anode effects."  Anode effects 
cause carbon from the anode and fluorine from the dissociated molten cryolite bath to combine, 
and produce fugitive emissions of CF4 and C2F6.   
 
 
Anode effects released approximately 2.5 million metric tons of CF4 and C2F6 in 2006 as 
documented in the GHG MRR TSD.  CF4 made up at least 85 percent of the combined emissions 
in 2006 (Inventory of U.S. GHG Emissions and Sinks:  1990 – 2007).  These emissions on a 
CO2e basis are equivalent to about 410 short tons of combined emissions as PFC.  The proposed 
GHG MRR TSD estimated CO2e emissions from primary aluminum smelters at full capacity.  
The largest smelter has 11 percent of U.S. operating capacity.  Therefore the largest smelter has a 
PTE of not more than 45 tons of PFC, and no facilities have a PTE greater than 100 tons.

EPA reviewed the proposed Supporting Data for Threshold Analysis Subpart E – W, 
 
Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Rulemaking, March 10, 2009 (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-
0508-0046.7) to determine actual emissions and calculate the potential to emit for 24 ammonia 
plants in operation.  The analysis spreadsheet details CO2 actual emission calculations for each 
plant based on ammonia production and urea production, and CO2, CH4 and N2O emission 
calculations for stationary fuel combustion based on 2006 data.  For purposes of permit threshold 
analysis, the CH4 and N2O emissions from combustion were not significant. 
 
Potential to Emit 

 
Capacity information in the spreadsheet is based on the engineering design capacity 

adjusted for 340 days per year of effective production capability, using information provided by 
the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  The PTE estimates were made by multiplying the 
actual emission estimates by the ratio of annual ammonia capacity to annual ammonia 
production adjusted to 365 days a year of operation instead of 340.  EPA assumed that ratio also 
held for stationary combustion units at the plant.

3.6.4  Cement Production 

Process-related CO2 emissions from cement production are the second largest source of 
industrial CO2 emissions in the United States.  Cement production is done in two stages.  The 
first stage is clinker production.  In clinker production, raw materials (primarily limestone) are 
heated to induce calcination and produce lime.  Lime reacts with silica-containing materials and 
iron ore and aluminum to form clinker.  During the process, CO2 is generated as a byproduct and 
released to the atmosphere.  Also during clinker production, some of the clinker raw materials 
form partially or fully calcinated cement kiln dust instead of forming clinker, resulting in 
additional process-related CO2 emissions.  In the second stage of the production process, the 
clinker is ground and mixed with gypsum and other materials to make cement. 

 

Potential to Emit 

 
The Technical Support Document for Process Emissions from Cement:  Proposed Rule 
for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0008) shows 107 
cement facilities in the U.S., 106 of which exceed all permit thresholds for CO2 (according to the 
TSD, the one facility that does not exceed the 100,000 tons per year threshold accounted for over 
90,000 metric tons of CO2e and approximately one-tenth of one percent of the cement industry 
emissions in 2006).

long-lived fluorinated gases in plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition 
(PECVD) processes to produce semiconductor products.  These include PFCs, which are also 
used as heat transfer fluids.  Approximately 3.5 million metric tons of PFCs as CO2e were 
emitted from the semiconductor industry in 2006 (Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
and Sinks:  1990 – 2007).

3.6.6  Ethanol Production 

In the proposed GHG MRR, EPA determined that the sources of GHG emissions at 

 
 
ethanol production facilities that must be reported under the proposed rule are stationary fuel 
combustion, onsite landfills, and onsite wastewater treatment.  For the GHG MRR supporting 
analysis, data were unavailable to estimate facility emissions from these combined sources.  
Instead, data on stationary fuel combustion requirements for different plant capacities were used 
to estimate the minimum number of facilities that would meet each of the examined reporting 
rule facility-level thresholds.  CO2 emissions from combustion constitute the majority of the 

 

29

GHG emissions from ethanol production and therefore provide an adequate measure for 
determining threshold counts.

The permit threshold PTE analysis relied on this same approach and data.  Therefore CH4 
emissions from onsite landfills and wastewater treatment plant digesters were not included in the 

 

30

PTE analysis, and we did not estimate emission coverage at each threshold.  Also, the analysis 
for the proposed GHG MRR did not evaluate thresholds of 100, 250, 5,000, and 50,000 tons per 
year.  EPA assumed that all existing plants would exceed the 100 and 250 ton per year thresholds 
based on fuel combustion associated with the wet milling process.  For the 5,000 and 50,000 
thresholds, EPA included the number of sources exceeding the next highest threshold.  For 
example, the count of sources exceeding the 5,000 tons per year level only includes the sources 
exceeding the 10,000 ton threshold in the Technical Support Document for Ethanol Facilities:  
Proposed Rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-

EPA estimates that ten new ethanol production facilities will be built per year.

utilization estimates for the primary metals industry classification which shows utilization at 85.9 
percent for 2006.  The PTE calculations do not affect the threshold analysis, because all facilities

3.6.8  Food Processing 

Food processing includes meat, poultry and fruit and vegetable processing.  Emissions 
derive from combustion and fugitive methane related to wastewater treatment.  For purposes of 
this permit threshold analysis, EPA did not consider the fugitive methane from wastewater 
treatment because these are the only greenhouse gas emissions from the source category other 
than combustion, and food processing is not a listed PSD source category.  Consequently, 
emissions from this subsector considered in this analysis were limited to combustion emissions 
and were calculated using the MECS approach.   

Potential to Emit 

 
EPA used the Federal Reserve's 2004 capacity utilization factor of 79.3 percent for the 

food industry to calculate PTE emissions.   

 

 

 

New Units 

 
In addition, new establishments were calculated assuming a continuation of the growth 

rate of 1.2 percent, as calculated using the methodology described earlier in this document.

EPA used the Supporting Data for Threshold Analysis Subpart E – W, Greenhouse Gas 

 
 
Mandatory Reporting Rulemaking, March 10, 2009 (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0046.7).to 
analyze emissions for permit thresholds from glass manufacturing.  Annual fuel combustion and 
glass production are estimated for each plant based on 2004 estimated plant sales and 2002 
MECS energy intensity (energy per sales dollars).  The spreadsheet shows CO2 emission 
estimates from industrial processes and stationary fuel combustion, as well as CH4 and N2O 
emission estimates from stationary fuel combustion.   
 
Potential to Emit 
 

Plant capacities are not available in the spreadsheet.  To estimate PTE, EPA divided the 

actual annual emissions by a capacity utilization factor of 0.79 or 79 percent, based on the 
Federal Reserve's 2004 monthly industrial capacity utilization estimates for the non-metallic 
minerals industry.   

 

New Units 
 

EPA used an estimated annual growth rate of 0.4 percent for the nonmetallic mineral 

product manufacturing sector to determine the number of new units for this analysis.

3.6.10  HCFC-22 Production 

Chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22) is produced for use in refrigeration and air 

 
 
conditioning systems and as a chemical feedstock for manufacturing synthetic polymers.  
Because HCFC-22 depletes stratospheric ozone, its production for non-feedstock uses is 
scheduled to be phased out by 2020 under the U.S. Clean Air Act.  Feedstock production, 
however, is permitted to continue indefinitely. 
 
 
A high global warming potential (GWP) greenhouse gas, trifluoromethane (HFC-23), is 
generated as a byproduct during the manufacture of HCFC-22.  Emissions of HFC-23 in 2006 
were estimated to be 13.8 million metric tons on a CO2e basis from three HCFC-22 production 
plants.  Estimates were based on the plants operating at capacity.  Annual emissions in terms of 
both metric tons CO2e and tons HFC-23 are summarized in Table 30 below.

Confidential business information (CBI) claims on production information limited EPA's 

Because the TSD did not include estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, and 

PTE analysis.  The Technical Support Document for Emissions of HFC-23 from Production of 
HCFC-22:  Proposed Rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (EPA-HQ-OAR-
2008-0508-0015) estimated that all three plants emit over 100,000 metric tons CO2e on a 
capacity basis by a factor of 85 or more, or a minimum of 800 short tons of HFC-23.  These 
estimates did not account for HFC-23 capture and destruction at two of the three plants.  
Therefore, actual emissions at two of the plants will be lower, and can be limited through 
permitting.  We assumed that all three plants exceed the 100 and 250 ton actual and PTE 
thresholds, and that one plant (uncontrolled) exceeds the 1,000 ton PTE threshold. 
 
 
the CBI claims noted above, the PTE analysis does not quantify fuel combustion emissions 
specifically for the three plants.  Stationary fuel combustion emissions from the plants were 
instead captured under the analysis for unspecified industrial stationary combustion.  
 
New Units 
 
 
declined by 62 percent.  The declines in emissions from control equipment and process changes 
offset the production increases.  Therefore we did not estimate any new facilities or 
modifications that would increase facility emissions more than 100 tons per year. 
 

U.S. production between 1990 and 2006 increased by 11 percent while emissions

3.6.11  Hydrogen Production 

 

EPA estimated CO2 emissions from merchant hydrogen production using the process and 

combustion ratio of 8.62 tons of CO2 emissions per ton of hydrogen production.  About 95 
percent of all hydrogen (not just merchant hydrogen) produced in the U.S. today is made from 
natural gas via steam methane reforming.  In steam methane reforming fueled by natural gas 
combustion, the process and combustion emissions go up the same stack from the 

 

37

boiler/reformer unit.  Because the emissions are predominately process emissions and because 
the natural gas combustion products are emitted from the same stack, EPA has treated all the 
emissions as process emissions. 
 
Potential to Emit 
 
 
adjustment to the emissions estimates is needed to account for PTE emissions.   
 
New Units 
 

EPA developed estimates assuming hydrogen production at capacity level.  Therefore, no 

Based on the industry growth factor of -0.1 percent for chemical manufacturing, EPA 

assumed that no new plants would be constructed.

3.6.12  Iron and Steel Production 

 
EPA used the Supporting Data for Threshold Analysis Subpart E – W, Greenhouse Gas 
 
Mandatory Reporting Rulemaking, March 10, 2009 (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0046.7) for the 
proposed GHG MRR threshold analysis to determine process and combustion CO2 and process 
CH4.  The iron and steel production source category includes taconite iron ore processing 
facilities, integrated iron and steel making facilities, electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking 

 

38

facilities that are not located at integrated iron and steel facilities, and coke oven facilities that 
are not located at integrated iron and steel facilities.  Facility processes and facilities covered in

emissions reported in the U.S. GHG Inventory, and apportioning these emissions to the different 
plants based on their capacity in those processes.  N2O emissions are primarily related to fuel 
combustion and were not backed out for separate treatment.

No new iron and steel facilities are expected to be built.  The growth rate in primary 

metals from the Economic Census data is only about 0.4 percent.

3.6.13  Lead Production 

According to the 2006 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), lead production in the U.S. 
includes both the primary, direct smelting (one facility) and secondary lead production (16 
facilities).  Process emissions of CO2 are a byproduct of the coke consumed during the smelting 
or reforming processes.  EPA calculated total process emissions based on lead production as 
reported in the USGS.   

 
In the Supporting Data for Threshold Analysis Subpart E – W, Greenhouse Gas 

Mandatory Reporting Rulemaking (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0046.7), combustion emissions 
are combined with process emissions to determine total actual emissions. 

Potential to Emit 

 
In order to determine PTE emissions, EPA considered the Federal Reserve's 2006 

monthly industrial capacity utilization estimates for primary metals industry classification which 
shows utilization at 85.9 percent for 2006, and adjusted to achieve 100 percent utilization.   

New Units 

 
EPA assumed no new facilities would be added for the industry, given an expected 

growth rate of 0.4 percent per year for primary metal manufacturing industry.

estimate GHG PTE for lime plants.   
 
Potential to Emit 
 

To estimate PTE, EPA divided annual actual CO2 emissions from the calcining process 
and fuel combustion emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O by regional capacity factors available in 
the spreadsheet for each plant.  The capacity factors ranged from 43 to 136 percent. 

 

EPA assumed no new facilities would be added for the industry.

3.6.15  Magnesium Production and Processing 

The magnesium metal production (primary and secondary) and casting industry typically 

 
 
uses SF6 as a cover gas to prevent the rapid oxidation and burning of molten magnesium in the 
presence of air.  A dilute gaseous mixture of SF6 with dry air and/or CO2 is blown over molten 
magnesium metal to induce and stabilize the formation of a protective crust.  A small portion of 
the SF6 reacts with the magnesium to form a thin molecular film of mostly magnesium oxide and 
magnesium fluoride.  The amount of SF6 reacting in magnesium production and processing is 
being studied but presently assumed to be negligible, and therefore all SF6 used is assumed to be 
emitted into the atmosphere. 
 
 
Magnesium Production and Processing:  Proposed Rule for Mandatory Reporting of 
Greenhouse Gases, EPA reported that national annual SF6 emissions from magnesium 
production and processing totaled approximately 3.2 million metric tons CO2e in 2006.  The 
facility population totaled 13 facilities that emitted 3.0 million metric tons CO2e.  The SF6 
emissions (no GWP adjustment) were 148 and 138 short tons respectively.  Ten magnesium die 
casting facilities accounted for 29 percent (44 tons), and primary and secondary production 
accounted for 64 percent (96 tons) of the total emissions.  Other small casting activities 
accounted for the remaining 7 percent (ten tons).    
 

For the proposed GHG MRR Technical Support Document for Process Emissions from 

 

43

Potential to Emit 

EPA used the analysis in the TSD for the proposed GHG MRR, where EPA had 

evaluated thresholds of 1,000, 10,000, 25,000, and 100,000 metric tons per year.  Facility-level 
information is not made publicly available because of confidential business information (CBI) 
claims.  From that earlier analysis EPA estimated that the same number of facilities exceeded the 
100, 250, and 1,000 tons CO2e per year PTE threshold as determined in the GHG MRR TSD for 
the 1,000 metric tons per year threshold.  In a similar fashion, EPA used the GHG MRR TSD 
facility counts at 10,000 metric tons CO2e per year to estimate facilities at the 5,000 tons per year 
PTE threshold, and 100,000 metric tons per year for the 50,000 tons CO2e per year PTE 
threshold.  The permit threshold analysis did not include CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.  
That information was not available in the TSD for the proposed GHG MRR.   

 
On an SF6 mass basis, the average emissions per facility are only 11 tons of SF6, well 
below 100 tons per year.  Therefore we assumed that none of the facilities have a potential to 
emit more than 100 tons per year of SF6.

3.6.16  Nitric Acid Production 

 
 
EPA used the 2006 nameplate capacity (metric tons of HNO3 100 percent acid basis) for 
45 nitric acid plants and 2006 acid production from the GHG MRR TSD supporting spreadsheet 
(EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0046.7) to determine N2O emissions.   
 
Potential to Emit 
 

The GHG PTE was calculated by multiplying actual N2O emissions as CO2e by the ratio 

of nameplate capacity to 2006 production.  The permit threshold analysis, based on the GHG 
MRR TSD, does not include GHG emissions from co-located stationary combustion units.  Also 
the permit threshold analysis does not account for overlap between facilities in the Nitric Acid 
and Ammonia categories, which have both ammonia and nitric acid production processes.

3.6.17  Petrochemical Production  

 

 
 

 

 

 

New Units 

EPA determined that the portion of the petrochemical production sector most relevant for 
permit threshold analysis includes the manufacture and production of acrylonitrile, carbon black, 
ethylene, ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide, and methanol, because the IPCC considers 
production of greenhouse gases from these processes significant compared to other 
petrochemical processes.   

 
Emissions from the manufacturing processes vary significantly, and process emissions 
take many forms.  Process emissions include direct oxidation of CO2, off-gassing of CH4 and 
CO2, and the direct release of CO2 and CH4 from equipment leaks.  Process emissions are the 
primary consideration for acrylonitrile, ethylene, and ethylene oxide processes.  In addition, 
some processes require combustion of supplemental fuel.  Both process and combustion 
emissions are significant for carbon black and methanol processes.   

Potential to Emit 

 
EPA's analysis assumed petrochemical production at the capacity level.  Therefore, no 

adjustment to the emissions estimates is needed to account for PTE.   

 
Based on an industry growth factor of -0.1 percent for chemical manufacturing, EPA 

assumed that no new plants would be constructed.

In developing the permit threshold analysis for petroleum refineries, EPA quantified CH4 

process emissions from wastewater, fugitive, flares, and storage tanks.  Process CO2 emissions 
derived from flares, hydrogen plant emissions, and sulfur plant emissions.  In addition, on-site 
combustion emissions were calculated considering fuel consumed by type.   

Potential to Emit 

 
EPA assumed that petroleum refineries were operating at capacity level.  Therefore, no 

adjustment to the emissions estimates was needed to account for PTE.  

New Units 

 
According to the ICR prepared for the New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), EPA 

expects that no new refineries will be built over the next few years.

3.6.19  Phosphoric Acid Production 

Phosphoric acid is produced by combining sulfuric acid and phosphate rock.  CO2 is 

emitted when the limestone component of phosphate rock reacts with the sulfuric acid.   

 

Potential to Emit 

 
When these process emissions are combined with combustion emissions, all 14 plants 

have emissions that exceed the highest threshold level; consequently, no PTE analysis was 
required. 
 

New Units 

 
Based on an industry growth factor of -0.1 percent for chemical manufacturing, EPA 

assumed that no new plants would be constructed.

3.6.20  Pulp and Paper Manufacturing 

Permit threshold analysis for this sector is focused on the energy intensive, fugitive 

emitting pulp, paper, and paperboard manufacturing subsectors.  Process emissions include CO2 
which is emitted in the recovery cycle at kraft and soda facilities associated with the chemical 
pulp process.  The CO2 emitted from kraft mill lime kilns originates from two sources:  (1) fossil 
fuels burned in the kiln, and (2) conversion of calcium carbonate (or "lime mud") generated in 
the recovery process to calcium oxide. 
 

The bulk of the emissions considered derive from combustion.  Many boilers use biomass 

fuel, and the burning of spent pulping liquors to produce steam for facility processes is 
considered biomass combustion for the GHG MRR.  The emissions numbers considered for the 
permit threshold analysis are non-biogenic (net of any biogenic emissions).  Considering only 
non-biogenic emissions, 96.5 percent of the facilities and 99.7 percent of the emissions are 
captured by all of the thresholds proposed for consideration of the permit threshold rule.   

Potential to Emit 

 

 

Because 99.7 percent of emissions were captured at even the highest threshold, no 

additional PTE estimate was calculated in this analysis. 
 

 

51

New Units 

 
Based on an industry growth factor of -2.5 percent for paper manufacturing, and previous 

EPA analysis for the pulp and paper NSPS ICR, EPA assumed that no new plants would be 
constructed.

3.6.21  Silicon Carbide Manufacturing 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

In 2006, one facility produced silicon carbide in the U.S.  Silicon carbide is primarily an 
industrial abrasive manufactured from silica sand or quartz and petroleum coke.  Approximately 
35 percent of the carbon from the petroleum coke is retained with the silicon carbide, and the rest 
is emitted as both CO2 and CH4.  In addition, emissions from combustion account for 
approximately ten percent of total emissions.   

 
Emissions from this plant exceed all permit threshold levels; as a result, EPA did not

In consideration of the permit thresholds, EPA considered the Fugitive Emissions 
 
Reporting from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Industry:  Background Technical Support 
Document (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0023).  This document details combustion emissions and 
fugitive emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas facilities, onshore natural gas 
processors, onshore natural gas transmission, underground natural gas storage, and liquid natural 
gas storage.  EPA determined that oil and gas exploration, development, transmission, and 
distribution are not listed PSD source categories, and therefore fugitive emissions from these 
activities were not considered for PSD applicability as it relates to major source thresholds.  
EPA's analysis focused on combustion emissions from these sources. 
 
Potential to Emit 

 
EPA considered capacity utilization figure of 90 percent as published in the Federal 

Reserve's capacity utilization data to determine PTE emission estimates and counts.

3.7.2  Underground Coal Mining 

GHG emissions from underground coal mining include CH4 fugitive emissions released 

 
 
from the coal seam and surrounding rock during mining and post-mining activities (coal bed 
CH4), and fuel combustion emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O.  Fugitive CH4, emissions are 
captured and vented by ventilation systems and degassing systems.  Captured and vented CH4 
emissions from active mines were considered in the PTE analysis.  Because underground coal 
mining is not one of the 28 PSD source categories for which fugitive emissions were required to 
be included in the emissions determination, fugitive emissions from post mining operations, 
surface mines, and inactive mines were not included in the permit thresholds analysis.  
 
The Technical Support Document for Underground Coal Mines:  Proposed Rule for 
 
Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508-0032) identified 612 
active underground coal mining facilities but analysis of CH4 emissions was limited to 128 
"gassy" mines where CH4 monitoring was already in place (due to existing CH4 emissions above 
Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) threshold levels).  The U.S. GHG Inventory 
(EPA, 2008) reports that 233 underground coal mines (including 133 gassy mines) ventilated 

 

58

CH4 in 2007.  Fuel combustion emission estimates for the GHG MRR TSD from all underground 
coal mines, based on U.S. Census energy use data, were found to comprise between one and 
three percent of total CO2e emissions, with coal bed CH4 accounting for the bulk of GHG 
emissions. 
 
 
In addition to the emissions data on the 128 gassy mines contained in the GHG MRR 
TSD, EPA considered combustion emissions from 289 bituminous underground coal mines, 
using U.S. Census data from 2002. 
 
Potential to Emit 
 
CH4 
 
 
CH4 emission estimates that were developed for the GHG MRR TSD were used for both 
actual emissions and PTE emissions permit threshold analysis.  EPA assumed that venting and 
degassing were continuous throughout the year; therefore, actual emission estimates equal PTE 
emission estimates.  The estimates considered 128 gassy mines, which were assumed to be the 
largest emitters of vented CH4.  The smallest mine of this group had annual CH4 emissions of 26 
tons; therefore EPA assumed that the annual CH4 emissions from the 105 vented mines that were 
not included in the TSD analysis were less than 26 tons.   
 
CO2  
 
 
Stationary Combustion categories, based on the ICF analysis (ICF, 2007) using the MECS 
approach.  Emissions were estimated based on Census information including fuel consumption 
per employee and the distribution of establishments by the number of employees.  PTE was 
estimated by using a capacity utilization factor of 86.3 percent as published by the Federal 
Reserve. 
 
New Units 
 
 
data show that only Colorado had an increase in the number of underground coal mines between 
2006 and 2007 (EIA, 2008).  The EIA data show that overall the number of underground coal 
mines decreased from 2006 to 2007 by eight percent; consequently, EPA assumed no new 
underground mines would be built.  http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/acr/table1.html 
 

CO2 emissions were estimated in the same manner as for other Unspecified Industrial 

The number of underground bituminous coal mines in the U.S. is on the decline.  EIA

3.8  Waste Sector 

 

3.8.1  Landfills 

The landfill PTE analysis includes both municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and onsite 

 
 
industrial landfills associated with pulp and paper and food processing.  The analysis used a 
modification of the landfill emission modeling approach used for the proposed GHG MRR 
threshold analysis.  Like the GHG MRR analysis, the permit threshold PTE analysis did not 
include onsite industrial landfills for ethanol processing facilities or industrial land application 
systems.   
 
GHG Emissions 
 
Decomposition of waste in landfills generates CH4 and CO2.  The amount of CH4 
 
generated from a given landfill is a function of several factors: the total amount of waste 
disposed in the landfill, the characteristics of the waste, and the climatic conditions.  The amount 
of CH4 emitted is the amount of CH4 generated minus the amount of CH4 oxidized by aerobic 
microorganisms in the landfill cover material.  Also subtracted from the total is the amount of 
CH4 that is destroyed by combustion of the vented gas.  The CO2 produced by decaying waste is 
not considered an anthropogenic emission, and is not counted in GHG emission totals.  Likewise, 
CO2 resulting from the combustion of landfill CH4 is not accounted for as an anthropogenic 
emission under international accounting guidance. 

 

61

 
 
According to the 2008 U.S. Inventory, MSW landfills emitted 111.2 million metric tons 
CH4 (CO2e basis) in 2006.  The majority of the CH4 emissions from on-site industrial landfills 
occurs at pulp and paper facilities and food processing facilities.  In 2006, these landfills emitted 
14.6 million metric tons CO2e 
 
Potential to Emit  
 
 
The methodology used for the proposed GHG MRR threshold analysis was also used to 
estimate CH4 generation rates and emissions in 2006 for the PTE analysis.  A landfill-specific 
model developed by EPA to support its proposed GHG MRR was used to estimate CH4 
generation and potential generation from municipal landfills.  The generation estimate was 
adjusted with assumptions on oxidation in landfill cover, and destruction by combustion for 
energy recovery or flaring.  The industrial landfill generation and emission estimates are based 
on the U.S. GHG Inventory.  Industrial landfills were assumed not to have energy recovery or 
flaring, so there was no difference between generation and emissions. 
 
New Units 
 
 
EPA did not estimate the number of new facilities added each year with CH4 emissions 
above the different thresholds due to the time delay between landfill construction and emission 
generation.   
 

3.8.2  Municipal Solid Waste Combustors 

 

 

The threshold analysis for the proposed GHG MRR included municipal solid waste 

 
combustors (MWC) in the general stationary fuel combustion category.  The analysis used the 
eGRID database, which is discussed in the PTE methodology description for electric generating 
units.  
 
Data and Methodology 

 
EPA used the latest version of the eGRID database (2006) to estimate the PTE of MWC 
facilities and counts of facilities above the different emission thresholds.  The eGRID database 
includes year 2004 characteristics, operating information, and annual CO2 emissions for U.S. 
facilities that have a generation capacity greater than one MW and sell electric power to the grid.  
By using eGRID, EPA assumed that all MWC facilities sell power to the grid. 
 
Potential to Emit 
 
 
EPA identified 75 MWC facilities based on the generator primary fuel in the generator 
table (primary fuel equals MSW) in the eGRID database.  The eGRID database contains CO2 
annual emissions estimates for the facilities.  For CO2 emissions, eGRID uses a standard 
assumption that 70 percent of the heat value of the waste stream comes from renewable materials 

 

62

To determine the number of new per year at different thresholds, EPA counted the 

and 30 percent comes from nonrenewable materials.  The renewable fraction has a CO2 emission 
rate of zero; therefore, the PTE threshold analysis is based on the nonrenewable or fossil fraction 
assumption.  EPA estimated PTE by dividing the annual emissions from eGRID by the eGRID 
plant capacity factor. 
 
New Units 
 
 
number of generators online each year, and totaled the nameplate capacity for each online year.  
This information was compared to the total facility nameplate capacity, and the PTE for the 
increased capacity was calculated by multiplying the facility PTE by the fraction of nameplate 
capacity associated with the new generators.  EPA counted the facilities that exceeded the PTE 
thresholds during each period, and computed a 15-year average to determine the number of new 
or modified facilities per year.

3.9  Agriculture (Stationary Fuel Combustion) 

The analysis for the Agriculture sector was limited to stationary fuel combustion CO2 
 
emissions from internal combustion diesel engine generators.  Fugitive emissions of CH4 from 
enteric fermentation, and CO2, CH4 and N2O from manure management were not included 
because farms and related operations are not in the 28 PSD source categories that require 

 

 

63

quantification of fugitive emission PTE for determining major source status, and because of the 
large uncertainties and lack of information on determining what component of the non-
combustion emissions at agricultural operations would be defined as non-fugitive for PSD 
purposes.  Fuel combustion for building space heating and other farm purposes were not 
included in the estimates, but would be a component of farm PTE.   
 
Data and Methodology 
 
 
EPA used the 2007 ICF analysis to estimate the number of farms covered by the different 
thresholds (ICF, 2007).  Emissions from diesel generators on farms were estimated using data on 
the average generator size in Delaware (EEA, 2004), and data on energy use on farms for non-
transport/non-machinery motors (Brown and Neal 2005).  Using these data, EPA estimated the 
number of diesel generators on farms and apportioned the generators across farm sizes, assuming 
no farm has more than one generator.   
 
Potential to Emit 
 
 
EPA assumed that a high proportion of farms would run the generators infrequently, and 
a smaller proportion would have a generator as the only power source, requiring nearly constant 
operation.  EPA used this distribution to determine actual and potential emissions, with PTE 
emissions based on the assumption that the generators ran 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 
 
 
combustion sources, because it is limited to diesel engine generators used primarily to run pumps 
and motors, and does not include additional sources such as fuel combustion for drying and 
curing, space heating, and water heating.  
 
New Units 
 
 
New generator installations were estimated based on information in the Regulatory 
Impact Analysis (RIA) for the spark ignition stationary combustion engine NSPS and area 
NESHAPS (EPA, 2007).  The on-farm engine population of diesel generators used for irrigation 
increased four percent between 1998 and 2003, or about 0.8 percent annually.   
 

EPA recognizes that this approach underestimates the PTE for all farm stationary fuel

EPA used EIA's Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) to estimate 

 
Data Source 
 
 
commercial sector stationary fuel combustion GHG emissions and PTE.  CBECS is a national 
sample survey that collects information on the stock of U.S. commercial buildings, their energy-
related building characteristics, and their energy consumption and expenditures.  Commercial 
buildings include all buildings in which at least half of the floor space is used for a purpose that 
is not residential, industrial, or agricultural; thus, the source category includes building types that 
might not traditionally be considered "commercial," such as schools, correctional institutions, 
and buildings used for religious worship.  The CBECS survey is conducted every four years and 
the most recent survey was completed for 2003.  
 
 
estimate characteristics of the entire nationwide commercial building stock.  The 2003 survey 
selected 6,955 potential case buildings for sampling.  The sampling procedures resulted in 5,215 
completed building interviews for a response rate of 82 percent.  To make national estimates 
from the sample data, EIA calculated base sampling weights for each building (the reciprocal of 
the probability of that building being selected into the sample).  In other words, the base

website.  The CBECS microdata consist of the 5,215 sampled building records, which each 
correspond to a single sampled building.  For each building, these files contain information such 
as the building size, climatic region, census region, year constructed, types of energy used, and 
energy consumption and expenditures.  These individual building microdata records are also the 
basis for the summary tables published by EIA.

populations above emission thresholds.  Each of the 5,215 microdata records corresponds to a 
single sampled building.  EIA has made available 20 different data files of the microdata records 
which contain a wide range of information on characteristics and energy use for each building. 
 
 
EPA's analysis relied on guidance provided by EIA on how to use the data.  As noted 
above, the CBECS sample was designed so that survey responses could be used to estimate 
characteristics of the entire commercial building stock nationwide.  The table below provides 
examples from EIA on how to calculate national commercial building characteristics from the 
sample building data.

EIA calculated base sampling weights for each surveyed building (these are the 

 
reciprocal of the probability of that building being selected into the sample).  Therefore, a 
building with a base weight of 1,000 represents itself and 999 similar but unsampled buildings in 
the total building stock.  The base weight is further adjusted to account for non-response bias.  
The variable "ADJWT8" in the data file is the final weight.  The ADJWT8 weight factor is used 
as described in Table 63 to extrapolate the survey sample to a national scale for any value.  In 
order to obtain a national value each sample building's value must be multiplied by the building's 
weight (ADJWT8).  All of the weighted values are then summed.   
 
2003 CO2 Emissions 
 
 
EPA calculated the CO2 emissions for each of the 5,215 buildings based on the annual 
natural gas and oil consumption reported for the building.  For national emission estimates and 
counts of buildings with annual CO2 emissions over any threshold, EPA multiplied the base 
weights by the sample emission totals to determine the national estimate of buildings with 
emissions over the threshold. 
 
Potential to Emit 
 
 
considered several sources in making the PTE factor determination:   
 

EPA estimates that commercial buildings operate at 15 percent of capacity.  EPA 

●  A report prepared by Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. for Oak Ridge National 

Laboratory describing the industrial and commercial boiler population in the United 
States (EEA, 2005).  The report estimated an average commercial boiler capacity factor 
of 16 percent. 
 

●  Reports on cooking equipment energy use by the Food Service Technology Center in 

California suggesting that the cooking equipment in food service establishments operate 
at about ten percent of a theoretical maximum capacity based on 8,760 hours per year 
(Pechan, et.al, 2008). 
 

●  A study of Los Angeles dry cleaners performed by the Pollution Prevention Education 

and Research Center (PPERC) in 2004 which demonstrates that dry cleaners operate 
boilers at about ten to 15 percent of maximum capacity over a normal year (Pechan, et 
al., 2008). 
 

New Buildings 
 
 
The CBECS data identifies the year the sampled buildings were constructed.  We used 
the construction year information to identify the number of new buildings built each year in the 
1990 to 2003 period.  Counts of the average number of these buildings built per year were then 
made at the different emissions and PTE thresholds. 
 
Threshold Summary

3.11  Residential Buildings  

 
Data Sources 
 
 
EPA used residential fuel consumption data from EIA's Residential Energy Consumption 
Survey, and multi-family building and unit data from U.S. Census (Census) surveys to estimate 
CO2 emissions and PTE for fuel combustion at single and multi-family residential properties.  
The RECS is a national area-probability sample survey that collects energy-related data for 
occupied primary housing units.  The most recent 2005 survey collected data from 4,382 
households in housing units statistically selected to represent the 111.1 million housing units in 
the United States.  RECS data are tabulated for the four Census regions, the nine Census 
divisions, and for the four most populous States -- California, Florida, New York, and Texas. 
 
 
The RECS sample was designed so that survey responses could be used to estimate 
characteristics of the national stock of occupied housing units.  In order to arrive at national 
estimates from the RECS sample, EPA calculated base sampling weights for each housing unit 
as the reciprocal of the probability of that building being selected into the sample.  Therefore, a 
housing unit with a base weight of 10,000 represents itself and 9,999 similar, but not sampled 
housing units in the total stock of occupied residential housing units.  The base weight is further 
adjusted to account for non-response bias.  Ratio adjustments were also used to ensure that the

The RECS data are provided at the housing unit level, and not at the building level.  EPA 

RECS weights add up to Census Current Population Survey estimates of the number of 
households. 
 
 
used additional data from the Census on multi-family building population characteristics to 
estimate total property emissions and PTE for multi-unit properties.  Census data were from two 
sources:  the Property Owner and Manager Survey (POMS, 1996) and the American Housing 
Survey (AHS, 2005). 
 

3.11.1  Single-Family Homes 

The annual energy consumption by fuel (1,000 Btu’s) for the surveyed unit was 

The RECS data was used directly to estimate CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion 

 
 
at single-family housing units for space heating, water heating, and appliances.  EPA assumed 
that each unit in an attached single-family building was a separate source, with combustion 
equipment under different ownership.  
 
 
multiplied by the fuel CO2 emission factor to estimate annual emissions.  Total single-family unit 
emissions for the entire country were calculated by multiplying CO2 emissions for each units by 
the base sampling weight.  
 
Potential to Emit 
 
 
The PTE for a single-family unit was calculated by dividing the CO2 emissions from the 
unit by a capacity factor of 0.1.  This factor was estimated by comparing the average annual CO2 
emissions per heated floor space area per hour by climate zone, to required heat input capacity.  
The required heat input capacity was based on rule of thumb heating system requirements for the 
different climate zones.  The table below shows the average Btu/ft2-hour from the RECS data 
and Heating Requirement (Btu/ft2) by climate zone.  A heating system efficiency of 80 percent 
was used to estimate the required space heating capacity.

3.11.2  Multi-Family Residential Buildings 

As noted earlier in the Data Source section, the RECS data are on an individual unit 

 
Emission Rates 
 
 
basis, not building or property basis, so a different approach was required for multi-family units 
where EPA assumed common ownership of the property fuel combustion equipment.  In order to 
estimate property emissions and the number of properties above different emission and PTE 
thresholds, EPA combined the RECS data with data from the POMS and AHS. 
 
 
From the RECS data, EPA first calculated average residential unit CO2 emissions for the 
two most common fuels (natural gas and oil) by multi-family category.  These are shown in the 
table below.

EPA also obtained annual CO2 emission rates from an EPA analysis that was based on 

 
 
 
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) modeling studies.  Those rates were estimated for old 
and new building units (see Table 67).  The pre-1980 building estimate compares with the 
overall average from the RECS data.  The post-1980 building estimates are much lower, 
particularly for units burning fuel oil.

Information on the distribution of multi-family properties by number of units per property

was taken from the 1995 – 1996 POMS.  The data are aggregated by different housing unit 
ranges.  The table below shows the property size distribution from unpublished POMS data 
(NMHC Quick Facts -- Apartment Stocks (http://www.nmhc.org)).  The POMS data were for 
privately owned housing only, and excluded public housing projects (about 13,500 buildings and 
1,326,000 units).  For our estimates, the building numbers were adjusted to current (2005) levels 
based on the RECS unit data (unit ratio of RECS to POMS).  EPA assumed the same unit 
distribution in the adjustment.

For our final estimates we used the LBNL based emission factors for post-1980 

PTE was estimated using the same ten percent capacity factor as used for the single 

The adjusted POMS size distribution and average number of units in each category were 

 
 
 
combined with information from RECS on the percentage of units that use gas or oil for space 
heating.  The gas and oil emission factors from the previous tables were applied to the average 
number of units in each property size category by fuel to estimate property annual CO2 
emissions.   
 
 
buildings, over the RECS based factor.  We found that these lower emission factors resulted in 
total emissions more in line with the total based on all RECS units and residential sector 
estimates in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory.  The RECS-based factors combined with the 
POMS property distribution data resulted in a larger overestimate in overall category annual 
emissions.  The lack of information on the building population over 50 units, and lack of 
information on the correlation between unit emissions and the building/property size are large 
sources of uncertainty in the estimates at thresholds above 1,000 tons.

The AHS data provided information on new construction used to estimate the number of 
new buildings and new units with natural gas space heating that were constructed in the 1999 – 
2005 period.  To simplify the analysis, EPA ignored the limited use of fuel oil for space heating 
in new units.   
 
 
per year, and a size distribution for all new buildings per year.  The AHS size distribution 
stopped at 50 and larger, and was slightly different in other categories from the POMS data.  
EPA adjusted the distribution based on the POMS distribution and then used the same emission 
and capacity factor approach as used for existing units.

Summary of ICR-based Data Used to Estimate Avoided Burden and Evaluate Resource 

Requirements at Alternative GHG Permitting Thresholds 

Attachment C 

 

 

Prepared by EPA Staff 

 
1.  Introduction 

August 2009 

This paper summarizes an assessment of the potential resource requirements for 

permitting authorities to include GHGs at different possible major source permitting thresholds 
and the avoided burden and costs for permitting authorities and sources as a result of including 
GHGs at a 25,000 tpy permitting threshold for Title V and Prevention of Significant 
Deterioration (PSD) permitting programs.  The analysis was performed using a GHG permitting 
threshold metric based on CO2-equivalents (CO2e), which represents the sum of the six primary 
GHGs with their global warming potentials (GWP) applied.  Time and costs associated with 
permit activities are derived from existing Information Collection Requests (ICRs).   Estimates 
for the number of affected permits used in this analysis were obtained from two technical support 
documents developed for the proposed GHG tailoring rule:  Technical Support Document for 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Thresholds Evaluation (GHG Thresholds TSD) and Methodology for 
Estimating New and Modified Sources that Would Be Subject to PSD Permitting for GHGs 
(GHG PSD Sources TSD), both of which can be found at EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0517.   
Significant uncertainties exist in the following estimates due to the lack of historical record and 
permitting experience upon which to base resource needs for including GHG sources. 
 
2.  Evaluation of ICR-based Resource Requirements for Permitting Authorities at Different 
Possible GHG Permitting Thresholds 
 
Title V Permits 

Table 2-1 presents the estimated burden estimates for permitting authorities at different 

possible Title V GHG major source applicability thresholds.  Descriptions of the different 
thresholds selected are provided below. Burden estimates are calculated based on information 
obtained from the April 2007 Information Collection Request for State Operating Permit

Regulations14. Annual values are derived from Tables 7 and 8 of the ICR.  For consistency, the 
permitting authority labor costs are updated to 2007 dollars utilizing the 2007 General Schedule 
Salary Table from the Office of Personnel Management.  For the purposes of this analysis, we 
assumed that commercial/residential sources that exceed the major source threshold due to GHG 
emissions will not likely have substantial applicable requirements in the near term. We also 
assumed that permits for such sources will not require as much time to prepare and issue as those 
for industrial sources, which have applicable requirements in addition to GHG. Therefore, it is 
estimated that new commercial/residential permits require 10% of the time needed for new 
industrial permits, or 43 hours compared to 428 hours for permitting authorities. For significant 
revisions and permit renewals, it is assumed that incorporating GHG information adds 9 hours, 
or an additional 10% to the current updating and processing time. Out of the 14,700 existing 
Title V permits, the Title V ICR estimates that 3,267 permits annually undergo renewal. It is 
estimated that the remaining 11,433 permits would need to undergo significant revision.  
 
Baseline 

To determine the impact under current Title V program conditions, baseline burden and 

cost are calculated at the 100 tpy threshold level, which is the generally applied major source 
applicability level under Title V. The GHG Thresholds TSD results indicate that 97% of the new 
sources that would need to apply for a Title V permit will be commercial/residential. All existing 
sources with operating permits will need to undergo significant revisions or permit renewals. The 
estimated total additional burden for permitting authorities is 340,957,876 hours, which, 
assuming 2000 hours per year per full time employee (FTE), equates to 170,479 new FTE’s at a 
cost of $15,684,062,296.  
 
Alternate Threshold Scenarios 

In addition to the baseline scenario, permitting authority burden was examined at three 
different GHG permitting threshold levels (10,000 tpy, 25,000 tpy, and 50,000 tpy) to evaluate 
the relative differences in impacts to permitting authorities.  All assumptions for Title V listed 
above remain the same for these scenarios.

The GHG Thresholds TSD indicates that 12,487 new and existing sources will be 
affected if the threshold is set at 10,000 tpy. All remaining existing sources have operating 
permits and will need to undergo significant revisions or permit renewals. Of the new sources, 
57% represent commercial/residential sources, while 43% represent industrial sources. Similar to 
the baseline analysis, a weighted average was developed for newly permitted sources to reflect 
differences between commercial/residential and industrial source permits. The total estimated 
burden at this threshold for permitting authorities is 2,713,976 hours requiring 1,357 new FTEs 
at a cost of $1,148,804.   

The GHG Thresholds TSD indicates there will be 3,189 new and existing sources that 

will need to obtain an operating permit at a threshold of 25,000 tpy.  Of these new sources, 1331, 
or 42% will require commercial/residential permits, with the remainder needing industrial 
permits. The total estimated burden at this threshold for permitting authorities is 984,757 hours, 
or 492 FTE’s, at a cost of $45,298,822.  

Finally, at a 50,000 tpy threshold, the GHG Thresholds TSD indicates there will be 697 
new and existing affected sources that will need to apply for and obtain operating permits.  The 
total estimated burden at this threshold for permitting authorities is 190,761 hours, requiring 95 
new FTEs at a cost of $8,775,006.

PSD Permits 

Table 2-2 presents the estimated burden estimates for permitting authorities at different 

possible PSD GHG major source applicability thresholds.  Descriptions of the different 
thresholds selected are provided below. Burden estimates for the PSD program are calculated 
based on listed values obtained from Tables 6-1 and 6-2 the August 2008 Information Collection 
Request for Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattainment New Source Review 
(NSR)15. NSR ICR at 18-19.  It is assumed that permit preparation and issuance for 
commercial/residential permits requires only 20% of the time necessary to prepare and issue 
industrial source permits since commercial/residential sources would likely be less complex in 
terms of numbers and types of emission sources and control requirements. Estimates obtained are 
additional burden and costs to those currently experienced by permitting authorities and sources. 
In addition to utilizing the GHG Thresholds TSD to determine new sources, modification 
numbers are derived from the GHG PSD Sources TSD.  Both of these TSDs can be found at 
EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0517. 
 
Baseline 

In order to determine the impact under current PSD program conditions, baseline burden 
and cost were calculated at the 250 tpy permitting threshold. The general 250 tpy PSD threshold, 
rather than the 100 tpy PSD threshold for selected industries/sources, is selected for calculations 
because it provides results more representative of the general population of sources that would 
exceed the major stationary source GHG threshold and potentially be subject to PSD 
requirements. At the 250 tpy threshold, the GHG Thresholds TSD indicates that 87% of all new 
NSR permits for GHG will be commercial/residential, with the remaining 13% for industrial 
sources.  It is assumed for this analysis that a commercial/residential permit will be less complex 
and generally limited to GHGs such that emission of additional pollutants is not expected and 
therefore the permitting process is simplified. To account for the resource requirement 
differences between the two categories of permits, it is assumed that preparing and issuing a 
commercial/residential PSD permit requires only 20% of the time necessary for an industrial

permit. The additional annual permitting burden for permitting authorities is 3,336,844 hours, 
which equates to approximately 1,668 new FTE’s, at a cost of $257,671,094. 
 
Alternate Threshold Scenarios 

After determining the baseline, additional burden was determined at three different major 

stationary source threshold levels (10,000 tpy, 25,000 tpy, and 50,000 tpy) to evaluate the 
relative differences in impacts to permitting authorities.  All assumptions for PSD permits listed 
above remain the same for these scenarios. 

The GHG Thresholds TSD and the PSD Sources TSD indicate that 827 sources will be 

affected if the permitting applicability threshold is set at 10,000 tpy.  Of these sources, it is 
estimated that 69% would consist of industrial source categories, while 31% fall under the 
commercial/residential categories. The total burden at this threshold for permitting authorities is 
estimated at 186,990 hours, requiring ninety-three new FTE’s at a cost of $14,439,368  

The GHG Thresholds TSD and PSD Sources TSD indicate there will be 401 affected 

sources at a threshold of 25,000 tpy.  Of these new sources, approximately 9% will fall under the 
commercial/residential source categories. For permitting authorities, the total estimate burden at 
this threshold is 112,025 hours, or 56 new FTE’s, at a cost of $8,650,571.  

At a 50,000 tpy threshold, the GHG Thresholds TSD and PSD Sources TSD indicate 

there will be 222 affected sources. Of these affected sources, we estimate that 15 will be 
associated with commercial sources, while the remaining will be for industrial sources due to the 
higher threshold applicability level.  For permitting authorities, the total estimated additional 
burden for permitting authorities will be 63,207 hours, requiring 32 new FTEs at a cost of 
$4,880,845.

3.  Estimates of Avoided ICR-based Burden for Permitting Authorities and Sources at 
Different Possible GHG Major Source Applicability Threshold for Title V and PSD 
 

The following tables indicate the burden avoided from the baseline scenarios by 

establishing a 10,000 tpy, 25,000 tpy, or 50,000 tpy major source applicability threshold for both 
the Title V and PSD programs. In Tables 3-1 through 3-3, the first three columns indicate the 
cost per permit and total cost to permitting authorities if the threshold level for carbon dioxide 
equivalents was set at the current threshold levels for Title V and PSD (100 and 250 tpy, 
respectively). The next three columns reflect the estimated costs for permitting authorities with 
the threshold set at the specified tons per year CO2e. In the final three columns, the avoided 
burden is estimated – the time and costs alleviated relative to the baseline scenario by 
establishing a GHG major source applicability level of 10,000 tpy, 25,000 tpy, or 50,000 tpy 
CO2e respectively. On average, permitting authorities would avoid an estimated $15 billion in 
costs. 

Set up similarly to the permitting authority table, Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6 below indicate 

the avoided burden for sources that emit less than 10,000 tpy, 25,000 tpy, or 50,000 tpy CO2e 
respectively.  On average, an estimated $39 billion in costs are avoided. Most of the sources that 
will not be required to obtain Title V or PSD permits at this time are commercial or residential.
