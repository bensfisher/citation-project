DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 

Wage and Hour Division 

29 CFR Part 552 
RIN 1235–AA05 

Application of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act to Domestic Service 
AGENCY: Wage and Hour Division, 
Department of Labor. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. 
SUMMARY: The Department of Labor (the 
Department or DOL) proposes to revise 
the current Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA or the Act) regulations pertaining 
to the exemption for companionship 
services and live-in domestic services. 
Section 13(a)(15) of the FLSA exempts 
from its minimum wage and overtime 
provisions domestic service employees 
employed ‘‘to provide companionship 
services for individuals who (because of 
age or infirmity) are unable to care for 
themselves (as such terms are defined 
and delimited by regulations of the 
Secretary).’’ Section 13(b)(21) of the 
FLSA exempts from the overtime 
provision any employee employed ‘‘in 
domestic service in a household and 
who resides in such household.’’ 

These exemptions were enacted in 
1974 at the same time that Congress 
amended the FLSA to extend coverage 
to domestic service employees 
employed by private households. The 
regulations governing these exemptions 
have been substantively unchanged 
since they were promulgated in 1975. 
Due to significant changes in the home 
health care industry over the last 35 
years, workers who today provide in- 
home care to individuals are performing 
duties and working in circumstances 
that were not envisioned when the 
companionship services regulations 
were promulgated. The number of 
workers providing these services has 
also greatly increased, and a significant 
number of these workers are being 
excluded from the minimum wage and 
overtime protections of the FLSA under 
the companionship services exemption. 
The Department has re-examined the 
regulations and determined that the 
regulations, as currently written, have 
expanded the scope of the exemption 
beyond those employees whom 
Congress intended to exempt when it 
enacted §§ 13(a)(15) and 13(b)(21) of the 
FLSA. Therefore, the Department 
proposes to amend the regulations to 
revise the definitions of ‘‘domestic 
service employment’’ and 
‘‘companionship services.’’ The 
Department also proposes to clarify the 
type of activities and duties that may be

considered ‘‘incidental’’ to the provision 
of companionship services. In addition, 
the Department proposes to amend the 
record-keeping requirements for live-in 
domestic workers. Finally, the 
Department proposes to amend the 
regulation pertaining to employment by 
a third party of companions and live-in 
domestic workers. This change would 
continue to allow the individual, family, 
or household employing the worker’s 
services to apply the companionship 
and live-in exemptions and would deny 
all third party employers the use of such 
exemptions.

II. Background 

Congress extended FLSA coverage to 

‘‘domestic service’’ workers in 1974, 
amending the law to apply to employees 
performing services of a household 
nature in or about the private home of 
the person by whom they are employed. 
See 29 U.S.C. 202(a), 206(f), 207(l). 
Domestic service workers were made 
subject to the FLSA even though they 
worked for a private household and not 
for a covered enterprise. Domestic 
service workers include, for example, 
employees employed as cooks, butlers, 
valets, maids, housekeepers, 
governesses, janitors, laundresses, 
caretakers, handymen, gardeners, and 
family chauffeurs. Senate Report No. 
93–690, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. p. 20

(1974). The 1974 Amendments also 
created an exemption from both the 
minimum wage and overtime pay 
requirements of the Act for casual 
babysitters and persons ‘‘employed in 
domestic service employment to 
provide companionship services for 
individuals who (because of age or 
infirmity) are unable to care for 
themselves (as such terms are defined 
and delimited by regulations of the 
Secretary).’’ 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(15). 
Congress also created a more limited 
exemption from the overtime pay 
requirement for domestic service 
employees who reside in the household 
where they work. 29 U.S.C. 213(b)(21). 

Congressional committee reports 
describe the bases for extending the 
minimum wage protections to domestics 
as ‘‘so compelling and generally 
recognized as to make it hardly 
necessary to cite them.’’ Senate Report 
No. 93–690, at p. 18. Private household 
work had been one of the least attractive 
fields of employment. Wages were low, 
work hours were highly irregular, and 
non-wage benefits were few. Id. 

The U.S. House of Representatives 
Committee on Education and Labor 
stated its expectation ‘‘that extending 
minimum wage and overtime protection 
to domestic service workers will not 
only raise the wages of these workers 
but will improve the sorry image of 
household employment. * * * 
Including domestic workers under the 
protection of the Act should help to 
raise the status and dignity of this 
work.’’ House Report No. 93–913, 93rd 
Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 33–34 (1974). The 
legislative history explains that the 1974 
Amendments were intended to include 
all employees whose vocation was 
domestic service, but to exempt from 
coverage babysitters and companions 
who were not regular bread-winners or 
responsible for their families’ support. It 
was not intended to exclude trained 
personnel such as nurses, whether 
registered or practical, from the 
protections of the Act. See Senate 
Report No. 93–690, at p. 20. Senator 
Williams, Chairman of the Senate 
Subcommittee on Labor and the Senate 
floor manager of the 1974 Amendments 
to the FLSA, described companions as 
‘‘elder sitters’’ whose main purpose is to 
watch over an elderly or infirm person 
in the same manner that a babysitter 
watches over children. 119 Cong. Rec. 
S24773, S24801 (daily ed. July 19, 
1973). Senator Williams further noted 
that all other work, such as occasionally 
making a meal or washing clothes for 
the person, must be incidental to that 
primary purpose. Id. 

On February 20, 1975, the Department 
issued regulations and interpretations in

29 CFR part 552 implementing the 
domestic service employment 
provisions See 40 FR 7404. Subpart A 
of the rule defined and delimited the 
terms ‘‘domestic service employee,’’ 
‘‘employee employed on a casual basis 
in domestic service employment to 
provide babysitting services,’’ and 
‘‘employment to provide 
companionship services to individuals 
who (because of age or infirmity) are 
unable to care for themselves.’’ Subpart 
B of the rule set out statements of 
general policy and interpretation 
concerning the application of the FLSA 
to domestic service employees. Section 
552.109 contained the Department’s 
position that the exemptions contained 
in § 13(a)(15) and § 13(b)(21) of the Act 
(exemptions for companions or live-in 
domestic service workers) were 
applicable to employees of a third party 
employer or agency. 

On December 30, 1993, the 

Department published a notice of 
proposed rulemaking in the Federal 
Register, inviting public comments on a 
proposal to revise 29 CFR 552.109 to 
clarify that, in order for the exemptions 
under § 13(a)(15) and § 13(b)(21) of the 
FLSA to apply, employees engaged in 
companionship services and live-in 
domestic service who are employed by 
a third party employer or agency must 
be ‘‘jointly’’ employed by the family or 
household using their services. Other 
minor updating and technical 
corrections were included in the 
proposal. See 58 FR 69310. On 
September 8, 1995, the Department 
published a final rule revising the 
regulations to incorporate changes 
required by the recently enacted 
changes to Title II of the Social Security 
Act and making other updating and 
technical revisions. See 60 FR 46766. 
That same day, the Department 
published a proposed rule reopening 
and extending the comment period on 
the proposed changes to § 552.109 
concerning third party employment. See 
60 FR 46797. The Department did not 
finalize this proposed change. 

On January 19, 2001, the Department 

published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to amend the regulations to 
revise the definition of ‘‘companionship 
services’’ to more closely mirror 
Congressional intent. The Department 
also sought to clarify the criteria used to 
determine whether employees qualify as 
trained personnel and to amend the 
regulations concerning third party 
employment. On April 23, 2001, the 
Department published a proposed rule 
reopening and extending the comment 
period on the January 2001 proposed 
rule. See 66 FR 20411. This rulemaking 
was eventually withdrawn and 

terminated on April 8, 2002. See 67 FR 
16668. 
III. Need for Rulemaking 

The home care industry has 

undergone a dramatic transformation 
since the Department published the 
implementing regulations in 1975. 
There has been a growing demand for 
long-term in-home care for persons of 
all ages, in part because of the rising 
cost of traditional institutional care, and 
because of the availability of funding 
assistance for in-home care under 
Medicare and Medicaid. The growing 
demand for long-term in-home care for 
persons is also partly due to the 
significant increase in our aging 
population.1 

In response to the growing demand 
for long-term in-home care, the home 
health care services industry has grown. 
According to the National Association 
of Home Care (NAHC) publication, 
Basic Statistics About Home Care 
(March 2000), data from the Department 
of Health and Human Services’ Health 
Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 
showed that the number of Medicare- 
certified home care agencies increased 
from 2,242 in 1975 to 7,747 in 1999. In 
the NAHC 2008 update, this number 
increased to 9,284 by the end of 2007. 
The number of for-profit agencies not 
associated with a hospital, rehabilitation 
facility, or skilled nursing facility, i.e., 
freestanding agencies, increased more 
than any other category of agency from 
47 in 1975 to 4,919 in 2006. These for- 
profit agencies grew from 2 percent of 
total Medicare-certified agencies in 1975 
to 68 percent by 2006, and now 
represent the greatest percentage of 
certified agencies. Public health 
agencies, which constituted over one- 
half of the certified agencies in 1975, 
now represent only 15 percent. 

Public funds pay the overwhelming 

majority of the cost for providing home 
care services. Medicaid payments 
represent nearly 40 percent of the 
industry’s total revenues; other payment 
sources include Medicare, insurance 
plans, and direct pay. Based on data 
from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of the 
Actuary, National Health Care 
Expenditures Historical and Projections: 
1965–2016, Medicare and Medicaid 
together paid over one-half of the funds 
to freestanding agencies (37 and 19 
percent, respectively). State and local 
governments account for 20 percent, 
while private health insurance accounts 
for 12 percent. Out-of-pocket funds

Demographic Profile of the United States,

account for 10 percent of agency 
revenues. 

There has been a similar increase in 
the employment of home health aides 
and personal care aides in the private 
homes of individuals in need of 
assistance with basic daily living or 
health maintenance activities. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics’ (BLS) national 
occupational employment and wage 
estimates from the Occupational 
Employment Statistics (OES) survey 
show that the number of workers in 
these jobs tripled during the decade 
between 1988 and 1998, and by 1998 
there were 430,440 workers employed 
as home health aides and 255,960 
workers employed as personal care 
aides. The combined occupations of 
personal care and home health aides 
constitute a rapidly growing 
occupational group. BLS statistics 
demonstrate that between 1998 and 
2008, this occupational group has more 
than doubled with home health aides 
increasing to 955,220 and personal care 
aides increasing to 630,740. (http://
www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes399021.
htm). 

The growth in demand for in-home 

care and in the home health care 
services industry has not resulted in 
growth in earnings for workers 
providing in-home care. The earnings of 
employees in the home health aide and 
personal care aide categories remain 
among the lowest in the service 
industry. Studies have shown that the 
low income of direct care workers 
including home care workers continues 
to impede efforts to improve both jobs 
and care.2 Protecting domestic service 
workers under the Act is an important 
step in ensuring that the home health 
care industry attracts and retains 
qualified workers that the sector will 
need in the future. Moreover, the 
workers that are employed by home care 
staffing agencies are not the workers 
that Congress envisioned when it 
enacted the companionship exemption 
i.e., neighbors performing elder sitting, 
but are instead professional caregivers 
entitled to FLSA protection. In view of 
the dramatic changes in the home health 
care sector in the 36 years since these 
regulations were first promulgated and 
the growing concern about the proper 
application of the FLSA minimum wage 
and overtime protections to domestic 
service employees, the Department 
believes it is appropriate to reconsider 
whether the scope of the regulations are 

2 See Brannon, Diane, et al., ‘‘Job Perceptions and 

Intent to Leave Among Direct Care Workers: 
Evidence From the Better Jobs Better Care 
Demonstrations’’ The Gerontologist, Vol. 47, No. 6, 
p. 820–829 (2007). 

now too broad and not in harmony with 
Congressional intent. 
IV. Proposed Regulatory Revisions 
A. Domestic Service Employment (29 
CFR 552.3) 

Current § 552.3 states that ‘‘As used in 

section 13(a)(15) of the Act, the term 
domestic service employment refers to 
services of a household nature 
performed by an employee in or about 
a private home (permanent or 
temporary) of the person by whom he or 
she is employed.’’ The current 
definition also lists various occupations 
which are considered ‘‘domestic service 
employment.’’ The Department 
proposes to update and clarify the 
§ 552.3 definition of ‘‘domestic service 
employment’’ in order to reflect the 
changing workforce. 

The Department proposes to remove 

the qualifying introductory language 
‘‘[A]s used in section 13(a)(15) of the 
Act’’ because the definition of domestic 
service employment has broader context 
than simply those employed to provide 
babysitting services on a casual basis 
and those performing companionship 
services. The proposed definition also 
removes the language that the domestic 
service work be performed in or about 
the home ‘‘of the person by whom he or 
she is employed.’’ This language has 
been part of the regulations since first 
implemented in 1975; however, the 
Department believes the definition may 
be confusing and may be misread as 
impermissibly narrowing coverage of 
domestic service employees under the 
FLSA. The Senate Committee 
responsible for the 1974 Amendments 
looked at regulations issued under the 
Social Security Act for defining 
domestic service. The Department 
borrowed this language from the Social 
Security regulations without discussion 
or elaboration, and has consistently 
maintained that the phrase is extraneous 
vestige. See Long Island Care at Home, 
Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 169–70 
(2007) (concluding that § 552.3 does not 
answer the question on third party 
employment and that the Department’s 
third party regulation at § 552.109 
controls). Moreover, the legislative 
history states that Congress intended to 
extend FLSA coverage to all employees 
whose ‘‘vocation’’ was domestic service, 
but to exempt from coverage casual 
babysitters and companions who were 
not regular breadwinners or responsible 
for their families’ support. See House 
Report No. 93–913, p. 36. Removal of 
this extraneous language more 
accurately reflects Congressional intent 
and clarifies coverage of these workers. 

Congress considered domestic service 

workers to include, for example, 
employees working as cooks, butlers, 
valets, maids, housekeepers, 
governesses, janitors, laundresses, 
caretakers, handymen, gardeners, and 
family chauffeurs. See Senate Report 
No. 93–690, p. 20. The Department 
included these occupations in § 552.3 as 
illustrative of domestic service workers. 
The Department proposes to delete the 
more outdated occupations in the list, 
such as governesses, footmen, and 
grooms, and to add additional modern 
day occupations such as nannies, home 
health aides, and personal care aides. 
The Department also proposes to 
include babysitters and companions to 
the list of domestic service workers, as 
workers in those occupations are 
domestic service workers, however, 
workers in those occupations may be 
exempt under FLSA § 13(a)(15) or 
§ 13(b)(21). The list continues to be 
illustrative, not exhaustive. 
B. Duties of a Companion (29 CFR 
552.6) 

The Department proposes to revise 

§ 552.6, the regulation pertaining to 
companionship services for the aged 
and infirm. Current § 552.6 defines 
‘‘companionship services’’ including 
‘‘fellowship, care, and protection’’ 
provided to a person who, because of 
advanced age or physical or mental 
infirmity, can not care for his or her 
own needs. This regulation defines 
exempt services as including household 
work related to the person’s care (such 
as meal preparation, bed making, 
washing of clothes, and other similar 
services). Under the current regulation, 
a companion may also perform 
additional general household work 
within the exemption if it is 
‘‘incidental’’ and comprised of no more 
than 20 percent of the total weekly 
hours worked. This regulation further 
explains that the term ‘‘companionship 
services’’ does not include services 
relating to the care and protection of the 
aged or infirm which require and are 
performed by trained personnel, such as 
a registered or practical nurse. 
1. Companionship Services 

In 1974 Congress amended the FLSA 
specifically to include domestic service 
workers (such as maids, cooks, valets 
and laundresses) as among those to be 
covered by the Act. Congress 
simultaneously created a narrow 
exemption for casual babysitters and 
those providing companionship to the 
elderly or infirm. The Senate debate of 
the companionship services exemption 
provides insight into the type of work 
Congress sought to exempt:

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

81193 

Senator Burdick: I am not concerned about 
the professional domestic who does this as a 
daily living. But we have situations in which 
young people, a widow, a divorcee, or a 
family of low income, of necessity, must have 
someone sit with their children while they 
are at work. 

We have another category of people who 
might have an aged father, an aged mother, 
an infirm father, an infirm mother, and a 
neighbor comes in and sits with them. 

This, of course, entails some work, such as 

perhaps making lunch for the children, or 
making lunch for the infirm person, and may 
even require throwing some diapers in the 
automatic washing machine for the baby. 
This would be incidental to the main 
purpose of the employment. 

The Senator has used the word 

‘‘companion’’ in the exception. When the 
Senator uses the word ‘‘companion,’’ the 
Senator does not mean that in the ordinarily 
accepted sense, that they are there to make 
them feel good. They are there to take care 
of them, he means, when he uses the word 
‘‘companion.’’ Is that correct? 

Senator Williams: We use the situation in 

which people are in a household not to do 
household work but are there, first, as 
babysitters. I think we all have the full 
meaning in mind of what a babysitter is there 
for—to watch the youngsters. 

‘‘Companion,’’ as we mean it, is in the 

same role—to be there and to watch an older 
person, in a sense. 

Senator Burdick: In other words, an elder 

sitter. 

Senator Williams: Exactly. 
119 Cong. Rec. at S24801. 

The House Report offers further 

insight into Congressional intent with 
respect to those employees providing 
‘‘companionship services’’ stating: 

It is the intent of the committee to include 
within the coverage of the Act all employees 
whose vocation is domestic service. 
However, the exemption reflects the intent of 
the committee to exclude from coverage 
babysitters for whom domestic service is a 
casual form of employment and companions 
for individuals who are unable because of age 
or infirmity to care for themselves. But it is 
not intended that trained personnel such as 
nurses, whether registered or practical, shall 
be excluded. People who will be employed 
in the excluded categories are not regular 
bread-winners or responsible for their 
families support. The fact that persons 
performing casual services as babysitters or 
services as companions do some incidental 
household work does not keep them from 
being casual babysitters or companions for 
purposes of this exclusion. 
House Report No. 93–913, p. 36. 

This legislative history indicates that 

Congress intended to remove from 
minimum wage and overtime pay 
protection only those domestic service 
workers for whom domestic service was 
not their vocation and whose actual 
purpose was to provide casual 
babysitting or companionship services. 
Congress also intended that a limited

amount of incidental work, such as 
making a meal or washing diapers for 
the person being cared for, would not 
remove the worker from the exemption. 
In addition to the legislative history, 

the dictionary definition of 
‘‘companionship’’ is instructive in 
understanding the scope of a companion 
as originally intended in the legislative 
history, that is, someone in the home 
primarily to watch over and care for the 
elderly or infirm person. The dictionary 
defines companionship as the 
‘‘relationship of companions; 
fellowship,’’ and the term ‘‘companion’’ 
is defined as a ‘‘person who associates 
with or accompanies another or others; 
associate; comrade’’ and as a ‘‘person 
employed to live with or travel with 
another.’’ See Webster’s New World 
Dictionary, p. 288 (2d College Ed. 1972). 
It further defines ‘‘fellowship’’ as 
including ‘‘a mutual sharing, as of 
experience, activity, interest, etc.’’ Id. at 
514. 

The Department is concerned that the 

current regulatory definition of 
‘‘companionship services’’ allows for 
the denial of minimum wage and 
overtime pay protection to workers who 
work in private homes and routinely 
perform general household work or 
provide medical care, and who may also 
provide fellowship and protection as an 
incidental activity to the household 
work or medical care. The current 
regulatory language places 
inappropriate emphasis on the 
‘‘household work related to the person’s 
care,’’ such as meal preparation, bed 
making, washing of clothes, and other 
similar services. These activities, 
particularly when combined with the 
current 20 percent tolerance for general 
household work, exempt workers for 
whom providing ‘‘fellowship and 
protection’’ is incidental to their 
employment as cooks, waiters, butlers, 
valets, maids, housekeepers, nannies, 
nurses, janitors, laundresses, caretakers, 
handymen, gardeners, home health 
aides, personal care aides, and 
chauffeurs of automobiles for family 
use. Therefore, the Department proposes 
to revise § 552.6 to clarify the tasks an 
exempt companion may perform and to 
more closely align the regulation with 
Congressional intent. 

The Department proposes to divide 
§ 552.6 into four paragraphs. Proposed 
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) will clarify 
what duties and activities may be 
considered ‘‘companionship services’’ 
and ‘‘incidental’’ to companionship 
services. Proposed paragraph (d) 
explains and clarifies that the 
companionship exemption is not 
applicable to medical care typically 

provided by personnel with specialized 
training. 

Current § 552.6 defines the term 

‘‘companionship services.’’ Proposed 
§ 552.6(a) also defines ‘‘companionship 
services’’ as ‘‘the provision of 
fellowship and protection for a person 
who, because of advanced age or 
physical or mental infirmity, is unable 
to care for themselves’’ and adds 
language that defines the terms 
‘‘fellowship’’ and ‘‘protection.’’ The 
legislative history describes a 
companion as someone who ‘‘sits with 
[an infirm parent];’’ provides ‘‘constant 
attendance;’’ and renders services 
similar to a babysitter, i.e., ‘‘someone to 
be there and watch an older person,’’ an 
‘‘elder sitter.’’ Such duties fall under the 
umbrella of fellowship and protection. 
Examples of activities that fall within 
fellowship and protection may include 
playing cards, watching television 
together, visiting with friends and 
neighbors, taking walks or engaging in 
hobbies. In addition, a companion may 
provide assistance with mobility and 
transfers. In the Department’s view, 
‘‘mobility’’ includes assistance with 
ambulation, including the use of a 
wheelchair or walker, and ‘‘transfers’’ 
include assisting the recipient in 
moving from one seating or reclining 
area to another. The Department 
believes that such tasks are consistent 
with what a babysitter or elder sitter 
would perform as contemplated by 
Senator Burdick in his explanation of 
the bill. The Department believes this 
expanded paragraph clarifies what is 
meant by ‘‘companionship services,’’ 
‘‘fellowship,’’ and ‘‘protection.’’ 

Proposed § 552.6(b) explains that 

‘‘companionship services’’ may include 
the intimate personal care services that 
the Secretary considers ‘‘incidental’’ to 
the provision of fellowship and 
protection. The proposed regulation 
limits a companion’s duties to 
fellowship and protection with some 
allowance for certain incidental work, 
provided the incidental duties are 
performed concurrent with fellowship 
and protection of the individual and 
exclusively for that individual. The 
discussion of companionship duties in 
the legislative history allows incidental 
work, such as ‘‘making lunch for the 
infirm person’’ and ‘‘some incidental 
household work.’’ See 119 Cong. Rec. at 
S24801. However, such incidental 
services must be performed attendant to 
and in conjunction with the provision of 
fellowship and protection and in close 
physical proximity to the aged or infirm 
individual. Proposed paragraph (b) 
makes clear that such intimate personal 
care services that are incidental to the 
provision of fellowship and protection

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

must not exceed 20 percent of the total 
hours worked in the workweek. Should 
the provision of these incidental 
services exceed 20 percent of the total 
hours worked in any workweek, then 
the exemption may not be claimed for 
that week and workers must be paid 
minimum wage and overtime. 

Proposed paragraph (b) also provides 

an illustrative list of permissible 
incidental services that may be provided 
by an exempt companion. In proposed 
§ 552.6(b)(1), the Department proposes 
to include assistance with occasional 
dressing of the elderly or infirm person 
as an incidental activity. The 
Department believes that allowing 
assistance with dressing is consistent 
with Congressional intent, as assistance 
with dressing is something that would 
normally be contemplated by a 
babysitter or elder sitter. For example, a 
companion may assist an elderly or 
infirm person in laying down or arising 
from a nap which may either be 
preceded by shedding of some clothing 
or applying some clothing. Adjustments 
in weather may also require either the 
addition or subtraction of certain 
clothing or footwear, or the elderly or 
infirm person may, on occasion, need 
assistance in dressing after soiling their 
clothing by spilling food on their blouse 
or shirt during a meal, for example. This 
type of occasional dressing is 
permissible; however, the Department 
does not envision this task as being a 
regular and recurring part of the 
companion’s duties. Further, the 
Department does not consider the 
application of special appliances or 
medical wraps (that require specialized 
training to apply) as part of assistance 
with dressing. 

In proposed § 552.6(b)(2), the 

Department proposes that an exempt 
companion be allowed to assist with 
occasional grooming, including combing 
and brushing hair, assistance with 
brushing teeth, application of 
deodorant, or cleansing of the person’s 
face and hands, such as following a 
meal. The Department recognizes that 
occasional grooming of the aged or 
infirm person is consistent with the 
Department’s goal of providing 
incidental intimate personal care 
services attendant to and in conjunction 
with the provision of fellowship and 
protection for the aged or infirm person. 

In proposed § 552.6(b)(3), the 

Department has included assistance 
with toileting, including assistance with 
transfers, mobility, positioning, use of 
toileting equipment and supplies (such 
as toilet paper, wipes, and elevated 
toilet seats or safety frames), diaper 
changing, and related personal 
cleansing. In the Department’s view, 

assistance with toileting is carried out 
attendant to and in conjunction with the 
provision of fellowship and protection 
of the aged or infirm person. Because 
toileting is a basic human need and not 
a function that can be scheduled, the 
Department proposes to include it in the 
list of incidental tasks that may be 
performed by the exempt companion. 
The Department specifically invites 
comment on the inclusion of occasional 
toileting and diaper changing to the list 
of incidental activities performed by the 
exempt companion. 

Proposed § 552.6(b)(4) suggests that 

an exempt companion may occasionally 
drive the aged or infirm individual to 
appointments, errands, and social 
events. The Department believes there is 
some justification for a companion who 
provides ‘‘fellowship and protection’’ to 
accompany an aged or infirm person to 
certain appointments. There is, 
however, some concern that providing 
transportation may be more akin to the 
duties of a chauffeur than to the duties 
of a companion. The Department is 
mindful that drivers and chauffeurs 
were expressly considered by Congress 
as among those they intended to be 
covered by the Act. The Department is 
also concerned about issues such as 
extra costs for the domestic worker and/ 
or their employer with respect to 
insurance coverage levels, for example. 
The Department proposes that 
occasional driving can be a component 
of incidental duties; however, with the 
cap on incidental duties at 20 percent, 
the Department anticipates that only a 
limited amount of time will be spent 
driving the aged or infirm person to 
appointments, errands and social 
events. The Department notes that while 
it seeks to limit the time an exempt 
companion spends driving the aged or 
infirm individual, the Department 
considers time spent accompanying an 
aged or infirm individual to 
appointments, errands or social events 
(e.g., traveling via a taxi cab or using 
public transportation) to be providing 
fellowship and protection. The 
Department explicitly invites comment 
on the proposal to include driving 
among the incidental activities an 
exempt companion may perform. 

Proposed § 552.6(b)(5) provides that 

an exempt companion may provide 
occasional assistance with feeding the 
aged or infirm person, including food 
preparation and clean-up associated 
with feeding; however, the Department 
considers feeding through or assistance 
with a feeding tube to be medical care 
(that is typically provided by personnel 
with specialized training) that is 
excluded from the definition of 
‘‘companionship services.’’ The 

Department notes that Senator Burdick 
stated in his floor speech that 
companionship was meant to include, 
‘‘some work, such as perhaps making 
lunch for the children, or making lunch 
for the infirm person * * *.’’ 119 Cong. 
Rec. at S24801. The Department 
proposes to require that in order for 
food preparation to be considered as an 
incidental activity, the food prepared by 
the companion must be eaten by the 
aged or infirm person while the 
companion is present. The Department 
believes that this is consistent with the 
goal that incidental intimate personal 
care services be provided attendant to 
and in conjunction with the provision of 
fellowship and protection of the aged or 
infirm person. However, it is not the 
Department’s intent that an exempt 
companion will be permitted to cook a 
week’s worth of food while the aged or 
infirm individual is engaged in other 
activities, for example, because that 
would not be attendant to and in 
conjunction with providing fellowship 
and protection. 

Proposed § 552.6(b)(6) provides that 

an exempt companion may occasionally 
place clothing worn by the person in the 
hamper, deposit the aged or infirm 
person’s clothing into the washing 
machine or dryer, and assist with 
hanging, folding, and putting away the 
aged or infirm person’s clothing. The 
Department’s review of the legislative 
history indicates that occasional, light 
laundry was contemplated by Congress 
in consideration of the casual babysitter 
and companionship exemptions. In 
their exchange, Senators Williams and 
Burdick indicated that one ‘‘may even 
require throwing some diapers in the 
automatic washing machine for the 
baby. This would be incidental to the 
main purpose of the employment.’’ 119 
Cong. Rec. at S24801. 

Proposed § 552.6(b)(7), allows for 

occasional assistance with bathing the 
aged or infirm person. The Department 
does not consider bathing to be part of 
the regular duties of the exempt 
companion; however, the Department 
believes that in certain exigent 
circumstances, a companion may need 
to provide assistance with bathing to the 
elderly or infirm person. An example of 
exigent circumstances would be when 
the elderly or infirm person has an 
unexpected toileting accident requiring 
the need for bathing. Generally, the 
Department believes that bathing is 
something that can be scheduled to not 
coincide with the companion’s duty 
hours, but proposes to allow reasonable 
but limited exceptions that more closely 
align to an imminent need to assist the 
elderly or infirm person with cleansing.

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

81195 

The Department specifically invites 

comments with respect to the 20 percent 
threshold for incidental care services, 
and whether this percentage is an 
appropriate figure. Further, the 
Department invites comments on the list 
of services, whether additional services 
should be included or certain services 
should be excluded, whether the list 
should be an exclusive list of permitted 
incidental services, and whether the 
requirement that such services must be 
performed attendant to and in 
conjunction with the provision of 
fellowship and protection to the elderly 
or infirm person should be adopted. 

Proposed § 552.6(c), makes clear that 

work benefiting other members of the 
household, such as preparing meals for 
the household, performing 
housekeeping or laundry for the other 
members of the household does not fall 
within incidental duties for an exempt 
companion. Similarly, general 
household services not otherwise 
allowed in § 552.6(b) and (d), are not 
considered ‘‘companionship services.’’ 
The Department’s proposal includes a 
change from the current regulation that 
allows the companionship services 
exemption to apply when the worker 
spends up to 20 percent of his or her 
time performing general household 
work which is unrelated to the care of 
the person. General household work 
that is not allowed under proposed 
§ 552.6(b), such as vacuuming, washing 
windows, and dusting, is the sort of 
work that Congress sought to cover 
when it amended the Act in 1974 to 
reach domestic service workers such as 
maids and housekeepers, and therefore, 
companions are precluded from 
performing such tasks in order for the 
exemption to apply. The Department 
believes the proposed revisions to the 
definition strike a balance that 
implements Congress’ twin goals of 
extending FLSA coverage to domestic 
service workers generally while 
exempting companions, by recognizing 
that the fellowship and protection 
provided by a companion are very 
different from the household chores 
performed by a maid or cook or 
laundress. Further, the proposed 
regulations also reflect that coverage 
under the FLSA is construed broadly 
and the exemptions are construed 
narrowly to effectuate the Act’s 
remedial purposes. 

Thus, the performance of duties that 
are not for fellowship and protection of 
the aged or infirm person, or incidental 
to the provision of fellowship and 
protection, are not ‘‘companionship 
duties,’’ and therefore, any performance 
of general household work would result 
in the loss of the exemption for the 

week. The Department believes that the 
combination of proposed § 552.6(b) and 
(c) results in the narrow slice of the 
workforce that Congress intended to 
exempt under the companionship 
exemption. 
2. Medical Care 

Proposed paragraph § 552.6(d) 

excludes from the definition of 
‘‘companionship services’’ medical care 
that is typically provided by personnel 
with specialized training. The 
Department proposes in § 552.6(d) to 
continue to make clear that 
‘‘companionship services’’ does not 
include care that is typically provided 
by personnel with specialized training 
and provides an illustrative and non- 
exhaustive list of examples of the type 
of care that is not considered 
‘‘companionship services.’’ 

The Department proposes to maintain 

the exclusion of medical care from the 
definition of ‘‘companionship services,’’ 
but proposes to clarify that 
companionship services do not include 
the performance of medically-related 
tasks for which training is typically a 
prerequisite. The Department’s 
experience indicates that many workers 
for whom the companionship 
exemption is claimed are categorized as 
personal care aides or home health 
aides. The Department understands that 
these workers often visit a care recipient 
for the purpose of providing wound care 
such as changing bandages, taking the 
care recipients vital signs, evaluating 
the care recipient’s health and 
performing other diagnostic or 
medically-related tasks. While some 
personal care or home health aides may 
be engaged to perform companionship 
services, the Department is concerned 
that many such workers are primarily 
performing medically-related or 
personal-care-related tasks rather than 
providing fellowship and protection, 
and are being denied minimum wage 
and overtime pay protections through 
misapplication of the companionship 
services exemption. 

The Department proposes to exclude 
from the definition of companionship 
services medically-related duties such 
as medication management, the taking 
of vital signs (pulse, respiration, blood 
sugar screening, and temperature), 
routine foot, skin, and back care, and 
assistance with physical therapy. This 
list is illustrative, not exhaustive. 
Similarly, determining whether 
prescription medication needs to be 
taken would remove the domestic 
service worker from the companionship 
exemption. 

However, the Department notes that 

reminders of medical appointments or a 

predetermined medicinal schedule 
would be encompassed within 
companionship duties. For example, 
where the companion is provided clear 
instructions to remind the aged or 
infirm person to take medication that 
has been provided in a daily pillbox at 
a prescribed time and the companion 
exercises no discretion as to the amount 
or when the care recipient takes the 
medication, such work generally would 
be intimate personal care activities 
considered by the Secretary to be 
incidental to the provision of fellowship 
and protection. The Department 
believes, however, that Congress did not 
intend the companionship services 
exemption to apply to employees who 
perform medically-related duties, such 
as registered or licensed nurses, 
certified nursing assistants, or certified 
nursing aides. Tasks being performed by 
these workers that typically require 
medical training and are beyond what 
Congress envisioned when it stated that 
persons providing companionship 
services are present in the home, as a 
neighbor might be, to watch over an 
elderly person the way a babysitter 
watches over a child. 

The Department specifically seeks 

comment on whether the proposed rule 
appropriately reflects medical care tasks 
currently performed by home health 
aides or personal care aides which 
require training in order to perform. The 
Department also seeks comment on 
whether the rule should list additional 
examples of minor health-related 
actions that do not require training and 
could be included within 
companionship services, such as 
applying a band aid to a minor cut or 
helping an elderly person take over-the- 
counter medication. 

It is important to note that workers 

providing healthcare in homes are 
already subject to minimum wage and 
overtime protections. However, the 
Department invites comment on the 
potential effects of the proposed 
changes as discussed above on the 
delivery of companionship services and 
whether unique circumstances exist that 
impact the provision of companionship 
services in the context of the broader 
healthcare system. 
C. Third Party Employment (29 CFR 
552.109) 

The Department also proposes to 

revise § 552.109, the regulation 
pertaining to third party employment. 
Current § 552.109 provides that 
employees who are employed by an 
employer or agency other than the 
family or household using the 
companionship services may be subject 
to the FLSA exemption from minimum

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

wage and overtime pay for companions 
under § 13(a)(15). The current regulation 
also provides that live-in workers who 
are employed by a third party may be 
subject to an overtime exemption under 
§ 13(b)(21) of the FLSA. 

Upon further consideration and 

analysis, the Department believes that 
these two exemptions from the 
minimum wage and overtime 
protections of the FLSA should not be 
applicable to employees of third party 
employers. The Department proposes to 
revise § 552.109 to limit the application 
of these exemptions to the individual, 
family or household employing the 
companion or live-in domestic worker, 
regardless of whether the family 
member employing the companion or 
live-in domestic worker resides in the 
home where the services are performed. 
The Department believes this proposed 
change better reflects the understanding 
of Congress when it created these 
exemptions. In addition, the Department 
believes amending this regulation is 
necessary to address the changes that 
have taken place in the home health 
care industry since this regulation was 
first promulgated. 

As noted by the Supreme Court, the 

Department has ‘‘struggled with the 
third party employment question.’’ Long 
Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 
U.S. 158, 171 (2007). In 1974, the 
Department proposed a regulation that 
would have denied the exemptions in 
§§ 13(a)(15) and 13(b)(21) of the Act to 
employees who, although providing 
companionship or live-in domestic 
services, were employed by an employer 
or agency other than the family or 
household using their services. See 39 
FR 35383. However, in the final 
regulation, promulgated in 1975, the 
Department concluded that the 
exemption could be applicable to 
employees providing companionship or 
live-in domestic services employed by 
such third party employers. See 40 FR 
7404. In 1993, 1995, and 2001, the 
Department revisited this regulation 
specifically, proposing amendments that 
would have curtailed the applicability 
of these exemptions to the employees of 
third party employers. 

In revisiting the legislative history of 
the 1974 Amendments, the Department 
believes that Congress contemplated 
that individual family members, and not 
third party employers that already were 
covered by the FLSA, would be 
impacted by the extension of coverage 
to domestic service workers. ‘‘I just 
cannot imagine the housewife struggling 
with the paper work which would be 
required.’’ 120 Cong. Rec. S5269 (daily 
ed. Mar. 5, 1974) (statement of Sen. 
Fannin). ‘‘The position of the committee 

in adding complete coverage for 
domestics and thus adding additional 
recordkeeping and other chores for the 
American housewife * * *’’ 120 Cong. 
Rec. S5275 (statement of Sen. 
Dominick). Because Congress believed 
that private households would be 
impacted by the expansion of FLSA 
coverage, it is reasonable to conclude 
that Congress intended only private 
households to be entitled to the 
exemptions from FLSA protections for 
domestic service workers. Professional 
caregivers, such as those individuals 
employed by third party employers, are 
simply not the type of employment 
arrangements that Congress sought to 
exempt. In view of the 
professionalization and standardization 
of this growth industry that has taken 
place over the last three decades, it is 
the Department’s position that 
employees providing companionship 
services who are employed in the 
vocation of caregiver by third parties 
should have the same minimum wage 
and overtime protections that other 
workers enjoy. 

Statements in the Congressional 
Record made by supporters of the 
amendment also demonstrate that 
Congress considered the impact that the 
expansion of FLSA coverage would 
have on poor women, many of them 
women of color, employed as domestics. 
Senator Williams noted that ‘‘the plain 
fact is that private household domestic 
workers are overwhelmingly female and 
members of minority groups,’’ and ‘‘[i]n 
failing to cover domestics under our 
basic wage and hour law we would be 
turning our backs on these people.’’ 119 
Cong. Rec. S24799 (statement of Senator 
Williams). Senator Williams further 
emphasized that ‘‘[s]ince domestic 
employment is one of the prime sources 
of jobs for poor and unskilled workers, 
it is clear that there is an important 
national interest at stake in insuring that 
the wages received for such work do not 
fall below a minimal standard of 
decency.’’ Id. at 24800. Such statements 
indicate that Congress intended broad 
FLSA coverage for domestic workers. 
Poor, minority women, many of them 
immigrants, continue to comprise the 
great majority of the companion 
workforce today. The fact that 70 
percent of home health care workers are 
employed by third party agencies—and 
fall outside of FLSA coverage under the 
current third party regulation—is an 
important indication that what Congress 
intended to accomplish in amending the 
FLSA in 1974 remains unfinished.3 

Moreover, under the 1974 Amendments, 
Congress explicitly extended FLSA 
coverage to domestic service employees 
who were not previously covered, i.e., 
those who worked only for a private 
family or a small business and not for 
a covered enterprise. Prior to 1974, 
employees who had worked for a 
covered placement agency, but were 
assigned to work in someone’s home 
were covered by the FLSA. 39 FR 35385. 
Congress did not intend for the 1974 
Amendments, which sought to extend 
the reach of the FLSA, to exclude 
workers already covered by the Act. The 
focus of the floor debate concerned the 
extension of coverage to categories of 
domestic workers who were not already 
covered by the FLSA, specifically, those 
not employed by an enterprise-covered 
agency. See, e.g., 119 Cong. Rec. at 
S24800 (‘‘coverage of domestic 
employees is a vital step in the direction 
of insuring that all workers affecting 
interstate commerce are protected by the 
Fair Labor Standards Act’’); see also 
Senate Report No. 93–690 at p. 20 (‘‘The 
goal of the Amendments embodied in 
the committee bill is to update the level 
of the minimum wage and to continue 
the task initiated in 1961—and further 
implemented in 1966 and 1972—to 
extend the basic protection of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act to additional 
workers and to reduce to the extent 
practicable at this time the remaining 
exemptions.’’) (emphasis added). 
Further, there is no indication that 
Congress considered limiting enterprise 
coverage for third party employers 
providing domestic services. The only 
expressions of concern by opponents of 
the amendment related to the new 
recordkeeping burdens on private 
households. Recognizing this intended 
expansion of the Act, the exemptions 
excluding employees from coverage 
must therefore be defined narrowly in 
the regulations to achieve the law’s 
purpose of extending coverage broadly. 
This is consistent with the general 
principle that coverage under the FLSA 
is broadly construed so as to effect its 
remedial purposes, and exemptions are 
narrowly interpreted and limited in 
application to those who clearly are 
within the terms and spirit of the 
exemption. See, e.g., A.H. Phillips, Inc. 
v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 493 (1945). 
Upon further analysis, the Department 
acknowledges that the regulatory 
rollback of coverage for many workers 
that resulted from current § 552.109 was 
not in accord with Congress’ purpose of 
expanding coverage.

statutes providing minimum wage and 
overtime protections to all or most 
third-party-employed home care 
workers who may otherwise fall under 
the federal companion exemption. 
These states are Colorado, Hawaii, 
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, 
New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, 
Washington, and Wisconsin. Maine and 
California extend minimum wage and 
overtime protections to all companions 
employed by for-profit agencies. Five 
more states (Arizona, Nebraska, North 
Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota) and 
the District of Columbia provide only 
minimum wage coverage only to home 
care workers, including companions, 
employed by third parties. 

Significantly, several of the states 

have instituted these protections in the 
last several years. For example, in 
January 2010 Colorado extended 
minimum wage and overtime protection 
to home care workers not employed by 
private households; in October 2003 
Michigan extended minimum wage and 
overtime protection to home care 
workers employed by an employer with 
2 or more employees and in July 2003 
California extended minimum wage 
coverage to all companions employed 
by third parties and overtime coverage 
to companions employed by for-profit 
agencies. The fact that these state 
statutes exist negates many of the 
objections raised in the past regarding 
the feasibility and expense of 
prohibiting third parties from claiming 
the companionship and live-in worker 
exemptions. 

Members of Congress have also 
recently urged the Department to 
narrow the scope of these exemptions. 
In 2009, over 50 Members of Congress 
wrote to Secretary Solis, urging the 
Department to revise the 
companionship regulation because it 
‘‘interpreted a narrow exemption 
Congress provided for ‘companionship 
services’ to exclude all workers, 
including those employed by a third 
party, who provide in-home care for 
elderly or disabled people from the 
FLSA’s wage and overtime protections.’’ 
See Letter from Representative Sanchez 
et al. to Secretary Solis, May 18, 2009; 
Letter from Senator Harkin, et al., to 
Secretary Solis, June 11, 2009. The 
Members also noted that most home 
care workers are women and often the 
sole bread winners for their families. 
The latter point is important because 
Congress stated that ‘‘[p]eople who will 
be employed in the excluded categories 
are not regular bread winners or 
responsible for their families’ support.’’ 
Senate Report No. 93–690, at p. 20. The 

expanded coverage was needed to raise 
incomes for those workers who 
depended on domestic work as a ‘‘daily 
living,’’ which was the workforce that 
Rep. Shirley Chisholm described as the 
‘‘thousands of ladies who have the sole 
responsibility for taking care of their 
families and will not be able to 
adequately support their families.’’ This 
situation continues today. One survey in 
New York City, for example, reported 
that 81 percent of home care workers 
served as the primary income earner for 
their family.4 

In 2007, the Department’s third party 
employment regulation was addressed 
by the Supreme Court. See Coke, 551 
U.S. 158. In Coke, a home health care 
worker employed by a third party 
challenged the validity of the 
Department’s regulation permitting 
employees of third parties to claim the 
companionship exemption. The Court 
acknowledged that the statutory text 
and legislative history do not provide an 
explicit answer to the third party 
employment question. Id. at 168. Rather, 
the FLSA leaves gaps as to the scope 
and definition of statutory terms such as 
‘‘domestic service employment’’ and 
‘‘companionship services,’’ and it 
provides the Department with the power 
to fill those gaps. Id. at 167. Further, 
when the Department fills statutory gaps 
with any reasonable interpretation, and 
in accordance with other applicable 
requirements, the courts accept the 
result as legally binding. Id. at 167–68. 
The Court noted that the 1974 
Amendment ‘‘expressly instructs the 
agency to work out the details of those 
broad definitions’’ and explained that 
the regulation ‘‘concerns a matter in 
respect to which the agency is expert,’’ 
because whether the 1974 Amendment 
should extend protection to any third 
party companions turns ‘‘upon the kind 
of thorough knowledge of the subject 
matter and ability to consult at length 
with affected parties that an agency, 
such as the Department of Labor, 
possesses.’’ Id. at 167–68. The Court 
concluded that ‘‘whether to include 
workers paid by third parties within the 
scope of the definitions is one of those 
details’’ that Congress entrusted to the 
Department. Id. at 167. 

In Coke, the Department argued that 

the third party regulation was an 
exercise of its expressly delegated 
legislative rulemaking authority, and as 
such, was legally binding and must be 
accorded the highest level of deference. 
The position taken by the Department in 

4 Gilbert, Lenora. Home Care Workers: The New 

York City Experience, Encyclopedia of 
Occupational Safety and Health, Vol. 3. (4th ed. 
International Labor Organization, 1998). 

Coke concerning deference, as affirmed 
by a unanimous Supreme Court, 
remains relevant as the Department 
reconsiders the scope of these 
exemptions. By engaging in a new 
round of notice and comment 
rulemaking, the Department is again 
appropriately exercising its expressly 
delegated rulemaking authority. The 
Department’s proposal to revise the 
third party regulation is in no way 
inconsistent with the Court’s ruling. 
Rather, the Court recognized that the 
statutory text does not answer the 
question and affirmed the Department’s 
broad authority to promulgate 
regulations that define the scope of the 
exemption. The Court explicitly 
recognized that the Department may 
interpret its ‘‘regulations differently at 
different times in their history,’’ and 
may make changes to its position, 
provided that the change creates no 
unfair surprise. Id. at 170–71. The Court 
also recognized that when the 
Department utilizes notice-and- 
comment rulemaking in an attempt to 
codify a new regulation, as it is doing 
now, such rulemaking makes surprise 
unlikely. Id. at 170. 

It must be noted that the Department 
argued in Coke, as well as in Wage and 
Hour Advisory Memorandum 
(‘‘WHAM’’) 2005–1 (Dec. 1, 2005) 
(found at http://www.dol.gov/whd/ 
FieldBulletins/index.htm), that the third 
party regulation, as currently written, 
was the Department’s best reading of 
these statutory exemptions. However, 
upon further consideration of the 
purpose and objectives behind the 1974 
Amendments, the Department is no 
longer convinced that our prior reading 
is the best one. The purpose behind the 
Amendments, confirmed by the 
legislative history, was to extend FLSA 
coverage to domestic workers who were 
not employed by covered enterprises. In 
recognition that it was expanding 
coverage to workers employed by 
private households, Congress created 
the narrow exemption for casual 
babysitters and companions whose 
vocation is not domestic service. In light 
of the purposes behind the amendment 
and the exemption, § 13(a)(15) of the 
FLSA cannot and should not necessarily 
be read to apply to third party 
employers, as we argued for in the 
WHAM. The Department erroneously 
focused on the phrase ‘‘any employee,’’ 
instead of focusing on the purpose and 
objective behind the 1974 Amendments, 
which was to expand minimum wage 
and overtime protections to workers 
employed by private households that 
did not otherwise meet the FLSA 
coverage requirements. The Supreme 

81198 

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

Court has ‘‘stressed that in expounding 
a statute, we must not be guided by a 
single sentence or member of a 
sentence, but look to the provisions of 
the whole law, and to its object and 
policy.’’ U.S. Nat’l Bank of Oregon v. 
Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 
439, 455 (1993) (internal quotation 
marks omitted). The Supreme Court 
concluded that ‘‘the text of the FLSA 
does not expressly answer the third 
party employment question.’’ Coke, 551 
at 168. Thus, the statutory phrase ‘‘any 
employee’’ cannot, standing alone, 
answer the question at hand, and after 
considering the purpose and objectives 
of the Amendments as a whole, the 
Department believes that the 
companionship exemption was not 
intended to apply to third party 
employers. 

Moreover, upon further reflection, the 
Department is no longer convinced that 
Congress’ failure to limit the 
companionship exemption to employees 
of a particular employer is evidence of 
Congressional intent on this issue. 
WHAM at 2. In 1974, Congress 
understood that enterprises that 
employed domestic service workers to 
perform services in private homes were 
already covered employers under the 
Act and thus, their employees already 
received the protections of the FLSA 
even when they performed 
companionship services. There is no 
indication that Congress intended to 
narrow coverage of those employed by 
third party employers when this would 
be contrary to the intent and purpose of 
expanding coverage and protecting low- 
wage workers. By focusing on the 
impact that the 1974 Amendments 
would have upon private households 
during the debates, Congress 
presumably did not think it necessary to 
explicitly limit the narrowly created 
statutory exemptions to families and 
households who employ companions, 
causal babysitters and live-in domestics. 
Rather, Congress provided the 
Department with the power to fill these 
kinds of statutory gaps. 

The WHAM noted the ambiguity and 

lack of clarity in the companionship 
regulations, stating that ‘‘phrases in the 
[companionship regulations] could 
potentially be read to exclude third 
party employees from the definition of 
domestic service employment.’’ WHAM 
at 3. This admitted lack of clarity is one 
of the reasons the Department has 
revisited these regulations, and, upon 
further consideration, proposes 
amending this regulation to state that 
employees of third party employers may 
not use these exemptions. This 
proposed amendment, as explained 
above, is based upon a closer 

examination of the legislative history 
and legislative intent, the manner in 
which the home health care industry 
has evolved, an attempt to better 
harmonize the regulations pertaining to 
companionship, 36 years of enforcement 
experience, and additional information 
provided by stakeholders, Members of 
Congress, and individual states. 

Based on the foregoing reasons, the 

Department proposes to revise 
§ 552.109(a) and (c) to apply the 
exemptions in §§ 13(a)(15) and 13(b)(21) 
of the FLSA only to workers employed 
by the individual, family or household 
using the worker’s services. Further, to 
address concerns expressed in the 
legislative history that FLSA 
compliance would be a burden to the 
individual, family, or household, the 
Department believes it is consistent 
with the statute to maintain the 
§§ 13(a)(15) and 13(b)(21) exemptions 
for the individual, family, or household 
even if they engage the services of a 
third party employer. Therefore, if the 
individual, family, or household and the 
third party agency are joint employers, 
only the individual, family, or 
household is still entitled to assert the 
exemptions. However, regardless of 
whether a joint employment 
relationship exists, the exemptions are 
not available to the third party 
employer. Thus, all workers employed 
by a third party, whether solely or 
jointly, are entitled to the minimum 
wage and overtime protections of the 
Act. The Department further notes that 
if the employee fails to qualify as an 
exempt companion, such as if the 
employee performs incidental duties 
that exceed the 20 percent tolerance 
allowed under the proposed § 552.6(b), 
or the employee provides medical care 
for which training is a prerequisite, the 
individual, family or household member 
cannot assert the exemption and is 
jointly and severally liable for the 
violation. The proposed revision 
appropriately limits these exemptions to 
the scope Congress intended. 

Finally, the proposed regulation refers 

to ‘‘the individual or member of the 
family or household’’ who employs the 
companion or live-in domestic worker. 
It is the Department’s intent that 
‘‘member of the family or household’’ be 
construed broadly, and no specific 
familial relationship is necessary. For 
example, a ‘‘member of the family or 
household’’ may include an individual 
who is a child, niece, guardian or 
authorized representative, housemate, 
or person acting in loco parentis to the 
elderly or infirm individual needing 
companionship or live-in services. 

The Department invites comments on 
the proposed changes to the third party 

employment regulation, and specifically 
seeks feedback from home health care 
workers, organizations, and employers. 
D. Live-in Domestic Service Employees 
(29 CFR 552.102 and 552.110) 

The Department proposes revisions to 

the recordkeeping requirements in 29 
CFR part 552 applicable to live-in 
domestic employees, in order to ensure 
that employers maintain an accurate 
record of hours worked by such workers 
and pay for all hours worked in 
accordance with the FLSA. Section 
13(b)(21) of the Act, provides an 
overtime exemption for live-in domestic 
employees; however, such workers 
remain subject to the FLSA minimum 
wage protections. Current § 552.102 
allows the employer and employee to 
enter into an agreement that excludes 
the amount of sleeping time, meal time, 
and other periods of complete freedom 
from duty when the employee may 
either leave the premises or stay on the 
premises for purely personal pursuits. 
Paragraph 552.102(a) makes clear that if 
the free time is interrupted by a call to 
duty, the interruption must be counted 
as hours worked. Paragraph 552.102(b) 
allows an employer and employee who 
have such an agreement to establish the 
employee’s hours of work in lieu of 
maintaining precise records of the hours 
actually worked. The employer is to 
maintain a copy of the agreement and 
indicate that the employee’s work time 
generally coincides with the agreement. 
If there is a significant deviation from 
the agreement, a separate record should 
be kept or a new agreement should be 
reached. 

The Department is concerned that not 

all hours worked are actually captured 
by such agreement and paid, which may 
result in a minimum wage violation. 
The current regulations do not provide 
a sufficient basis to determine whether 
the employee has in fact received at 
least the minimum wage for all hours 
worked. 

Proposed § 552.102(b) would no 

longer allow the employer of a live-in 
domestic employee to use the agreement 
as the basis to establish the actual hours 
of work in lieu of maintaining an actual 
record of such hours. Instead, the 
employer will be required to keep a 
record of the actual hours worked. 
Consequently, the language suggesting 
that a separate record of hours worked 
be kept when there is a significant 
deviation from the agreement is deleted. 
Nonetheless, proposed § 551.102(b) 
requires entering into a new written 
agreement whenever there is a 
significant deviation from the existing 
agreement.

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

81199 

The Department also proposes to 
amend § 552.110 with respect to the 
records kept for live-in domestic 
employees. Current § 552.110 specifies 
the recordkeeping requirements for 
domestic service employees. Paragraph 
552.110(b) provides that records of 
actual hours worked are not required for 
live-in domestic employees; instead, the 
employer may maintain a copy of the 
agreement referred to in § 552.102. It 
also states that the more limited 
recordkeeping requirement in this 
section does not apply to third-party 
employers and that no records are 
required for casual babysitters. 
Paragraph 552.110(c) permits, when a 
domestic service employee works a 
fixed schedule, the employer to use the 
schedule that the employee normally 
works and either provide some notation 
that such hours were actually worked 
or, when more or less hours are actually 
worked, show the exact number of 
hours worked. Paragraph 552.110(d) 
permits an employer to require the 
domestic service employee to record the 
hours worked and submit the record to 
the employer. 

For the reasons outlined above, 

proposed § 552.110(b) will no longer 
permit an employer to maintain a copy 
of the agreement as a substitution for 
recording actual hours worked by the 
live-in domestic employee. Instead, it 
requires that the employer maintain a 
copy of the agreement and maintain 
records showing the exact number of 
hours worked by the live-in domestic 
employee. Proposed § 552.110(b) also 
makes clear that the provisions of 29 
CFR 516.2(c) do not apply to live-in 
domestic employees, which means that 
employers of such employees may not 
maintain a simplified set of records for 
live-in domestic employees who work a 
fixed schedule. As a result, § 552.110(c) 
is revised to clearly state that the 
provision does not apply to live-in 
domestic workers. The Department 
believes that the frequency of schedule 
changes simply makes reliance on a 
fixed schedule and noting exceptions 
too unreliable to ensure an accurate 
record of hours worked by these 
employees. In addition, the proposed 
changes to § 552.109 makes the 
reference in § 552.110(b) to third-party 
employers not being able to rely on the 
simplified recordkeeping requirements 
moot; consequently, it is removed from 
proposed § 552.110(b). The proposed 
regulations also revise § 552.110(d), thus 
no longer allowing the employer to 
require the live-in domestic service 
employee to record the hours worked 
and submit the record to the employer. 
As with other employees, the employer

is responsible for making, keeping, and 
preserving records of hours worked and 
ensuring their accuracy. As is the case 
now, the Department does not require 
records for casual babysitters as defined 
by § 552.5; however, that provision is in 
a stand-alone paragraph, proposed 29 
CFR 552.110(e). 
V. Paperwork Reduction Act 

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 

(PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and its 
attendant regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, 
requires that the Department consider 
the impact of paperwork and other 
information collection burdens imposed 
on the public. Under the PRA, an 
agency may not collect or sponsor the 
collection of information, nor may it 
impose an information collection 
requirement unless it displays a 
currently valid Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) control number. See 
5 CFR 1320.8(b)(3)(vi). 

This action contains the following 
proposed amendments to the existing 
information collection requirements 
previously approved under OMB 
Control Number 1235–0018. As required 
by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3507(d), the Department has 
submitted these proposed information 
collection amendments to OMB for its 
review. 

Summary: The Department seeks to 

minimize the paperwork burden for 
individuals, small businesses, 
educational and nonprofit institutions, 
Federal contractors, State, local, and 
tribal governments, and other persons 
resulting from the collection of 
information by or for the agency. The 
PRA typically requires an agency to 
provide notice and seek public 
comments on any proposed collection of 
information contained in a proposed 
rule. See 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B); 5 CFR 
1320.8. 

The PRA requires all Federal agencies 

to analyze proposed regulations for 
potential time burdens on the regulated 
community created by provisions 
within the proposed regulations that 
require the submission of information. 
These information collection (IC) 
requirements must be submitted to OMB 
for approval. Persons are not required to 
respond to the information collection 
requirements as contained in this 
proposal unless and until they are 
approved by the OMB under the PRA at 
the final rule stage. This ‘‘paperwork 
burden’’ analysis estimates the burdens 
for the proposed regulations as drafted. 
The Department proposes to amend 29 
CFR part 552 with respect to the records 
kept for live-in domestic employees. 
Proposed 29 CFR 552.102(b) would no 
longer allow the employer of a live-in 

domestic employee to use an agreement 
as the basis to establish hours worked in 
lieu of maintaining actual record of such 
hours. Instead, the employer will be 
required to keep a record of the actual 
hours worked. Concurrently, proposed 
29 CFR 552.110(b) will no longer permit 
an employer to maintain a copy of an 
agreement as a substitute for keeping 
records of hours worked by the live-in 
domestic employee. Finally, the 
Department’s proposed amendments to 
29 CFR part 552 results in fewer 
employees being exempt from the 
minimum wage and overtime law. 
Employers must maintain records of 
hours worked for employees who are 
not exempt from minimum wage and 
overtime pay requirements. Therefore, 
the number of employees for whom an 
employer must maintain records of 
hours worked will increase under the 
proposed rule. This will increase the 
burden under 29 CFR part 516, the 
general recordkeeping regulation under 
the FLSA. 

Circumstances Necessitating 

Collection: The Fair Labor Standards 
Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq., sets 
the Federal minimum wage, overtime 
pay, recordkeeping and youth 
employment standards of most general 
application. Section 11(c) of the FLSA 
requires all employers covered by the 
FLSA to make, keep, and preserve 
records or employees and of wages, 
hours, and other conditions and 
practices of employment. A FLSA 
covered employer must maintain the 
records for such period of time and 
make such reports as prescribed by 
regulations issued by the Secretary of 
Labor. The Department has promulgated 
regulations at 29 CFR part 516 to 
establish the basic FLSA recordkeeping 
requirements. The Department has also 
issued specific recordkeeping 
requirements in 29 CFR part 552 which 
is the subject of this collection. The 
Department proposes to amend 
recordkeeping requirements in 
§ 552.102 and § 552.110 regarding 
agreements for live-in domestic workers. 
The Department also notes that the 
proposed amendments to the definition 
of companion results in fewer 
employees being exempt from the 
minimum wage and overtime 
requirements of the FLSA. 

Purpose and Use: The Wage and Hour 
Division (WHD) and employees use this 
information to determine whether 
covered employers have complied with 
various FLSA requirements. Employers 
use the records to document FLSA 
compliance, including showing 
qualification for various FLSA 
exemptions.

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

Technology: The recordkeeping aspect 

of this collection makes clear that the 
regulations prescribe no particular order 
or form of records and employers may 
preserve records in such forms as 
microfilm, or automated word or data 
processing memory is acceptable 
provided facilities are available for 
inspection and transcription of the 
records. 

Duplication: This information is not 

available through any other source. 
Minimizing Small Entity Burden: 

Although this information collection 
does involve small businesses, 
including small State and Local 
government agencies, the Department 
minimizes respondent burden by 
requiring no specific order or form of 
records in responding to this 
information collection. Moreover, 
employers would normally maintain the 
records identified in this information 
collection under usual or customary 
business practices. 

Agency Need: The Department is 

assigned a statutory obligation to ensure 
employer compliance with the FLSA. 
The Department uses records covered by 
this information collection to determine 
compliance with the FLSA. 

Special Circumstances: There are no 
special circumstances associated with 
this collection. 

Public Comments: The Department 
seeks public comments regarding the 
burdens imposed by information 
collections contained in sections 
552.102 and 552.110 of this proposed 
rule. In particular, the Department seeks 
comments that: Evaluate whether the 
proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including

VI. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes the importance of 
quantifying both costs and benefits, of 
reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, 

and of promoting flexibility. This rule 
has been designated a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ because it is 
economically significant, under section 
3(f) of Executive Order 12866, based on 
the Preliminary Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (PRIA) presented below. As a 
result, the OMB has reviewed this 
proposed rule. The Department also has 
concluded that this proposed rule is a 
major rule under the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996 (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.). 

Preliminary Regulatory Impact 

Analysis of the Proposed Revisions to 
the Companionship 

Regulations Background 
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 

51735, October 4, 1993), the Department 
must determine whether a regulatory 
action is ‘‘significant’’ and therefore 
subject to OMB review and the 
requirements of the Executive Order. 
Executive Order 12866 defines 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ as one 
that is likely to result in a rule that may 
have ‘‘an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more or adversely 
affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, 
public health or safety, or state, local, or 
tribal governments or communities; 
create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or 
policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in the Executive 
Order.’’ This proposed rule meets the 
criteria for a significant regulatory 
action because it is anticipated to have 
an annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more. As a result, the rule is 
submitted to OMB for review. 

The provisions of the FLSA apply to 

all enterprises that have employees 
engaged in commerce or in the 
production of goods for commerce and 
have an annual gross volume of sales 
made or business done of at least 
$500,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at 
the retail level that are separately 
stated); or, are engaged in the operation 
of a hospital, an institution primarily 
engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, 
or the mentally ill who reside on the 
premises; a school for mentally or 
physically disabled or gifted children; a 
preschool, elementary or secondary 
school, or an institution of higher 
education (regardless whether such 
hospital, institution or school is public 
or private, or operated for profit or not);

or, are engaged in an activity of a public 
agency. 

There are two ways an employee may 

be covered by the provisions of the 
FLSA: (1) Any employee of an 
enterprise covered by the FLSA is 
covered by the provisions of the FLSA, 
and (2) even if the enterprise is not 
covered, individual employees whose 
work engages the employee in interstate 
commerce or in the production of goods 
for commerce or in domestic service is 
covered by the provisions of the FLSA. 
Covered employers are required by the 
provisions of the FLSA to: (1) Pay 
employees who are not exempt from the 
Act’s requirements not less than the 
Federal minimum wage for all hours 
worked and overtime premium pay at a 
rate of not less than one and one-half 
times the employee’s regular rate of pay 
for all hours worked over 40 in a 
workweek, and (2) make, keep, and 
preserve records of the persons 
employed by the employer and of the 
wages, hours, and other conditions and 
practices of employment. 

In 1974, Congress expressly extended 

FLSA coverage to ‘‘domestic service’’ 
workers performing services of a 
household nature in private homes not 
previously subject to minimum wage 
and overtime requirements. While 
domestic service workers are covered by 
FLSA minimum wage and overtime 
requirements even though they work for 
a private household and not a covered 
enterprise, Congress created exemptions 
from these requirements for casual 
babysitters and persons employed in 
domestic service employment to 
provide companionship services for 
individuals who (because of age or 
infirmity) are unable to care for 
themselves.5 
Need for Regulation and Why the 
Department Is Considering Action 

In 1974, Congress extended coverage 
of the FLSA to many domestic service 
employees performing services of a 
household nature in private homes not 
previously subject to minimum wage 
and overtime pay requirements. Section 
13(a)(15) of the Act exempts from its 
minimum wage and overtime pay 
provisions domestic service employees 
employed ‘‘to provide companionship 
services for individuals who (because of 
age or infirmity) are unable to care for 
themselves (as such terms are defined 
and delimited by regulations of the 
Secretary).’’ Section 13(b)(21) of the 
FLSA exempts from the overtime pay 
provision any employee employed ‘‘in 
domestic service in a household and 
who resides in such household.’’

Since the 1975 regulations were 

implemented, the home health care 
industry has evolved and expanded in 
response to the increasing size of the 
population in need of such services, the 
growing demand for in-home care 
instead of institutional care for persons 
of all ages, and the availability of public 
funding assistance for such services 
under Medicare and Medicaid. As the 
industry has expanded, so has the range 
of tasks performed by workers providing 
companionship services. The range now 
includes assistance with activities of 
daily living (ADLs), instrumental 
activities of daily living (IADLs), and 
paramedical tasks (such as catheter 
hygiene or changing of aseptic 
dressings).6 Public funding programs do 
not cover services such as social 
support, fellowship or protection.7 
According to the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS), 
‘‘[s]imple companionship or custodial 
observation of an individual, absent 
hands-on or cueing assistance that is 
necessary and directly related to ADLs 
and IADLs, is not a Medicaid personal 
care service.’’ 8 

The Department of Labor believes that 

the current application of the 
companionship services exemption in 
the home health care industry is not 
consistent with the original 
Congressional intent. The Department 
proposes to modify the definition of 
companionship services to exclude 
personnel who perform functions that 
require training in the performance of 
medically-related duties, and to provide 
only a 20 percent tolerance for intimate 
personal care services and related 
household work. As a result, to qualify 
for the companionship services 
exemption, workers must spend at least 
80 percent of their time in activities that 
provide fellowship or protection. Those 
workers who are providing home health 
care services that exceed the 20 percent 
tolerance for intimate personal care 
services and related household work 
must be paid in accordance with federal 
minimum wage and overtime 
requirements.

employees employed ‘‘to provide 
companionship services for individuals 
who (because of age or infirmity) are 
unable to care for themselves (as such 
terms are defined and delimited by 
regulations of the Secretary).’’ Due to 
significant changes in the home health 
care industry over the last 36 years, 
workers who today provide in-home 
care to individuals are performing 
duties and working in circumstances 
that were not envisioned when the 
companionship services regulations 
were promulgated. Section 13(b)(21) 
provides an exemption from the Act’s 
overtime pay requirements for live-in 
domestic workers. The current 
regulations allow an employer of a live- 
in domestic worker to maintain a copy 
of the agreement of hours to be worked 
and to indicate that the employee’s 
work time generally coincides with that 
agreement, instead of requiring the 
employer to maintain an accurate record 
of hours actually worked by the live-in 
domestic worker. The Department is 
concerned that not all hours worked are 
actually captured by such agreement 
and paid, which may result in a 
minimum wage violation. The current 
regulations do not provide a sufficient 
basis to determine whether the 
employee has in fact received at least 
the minimum wage for all hours 
worked. 

The Department has re-examined the 

regulations and determined that the 
regulations, as currently written, have 
expanded the scope of the 
companionship services exemption 
beyond those employees whom 
Congress intended to exempt when it 
enacted § 13(a)(15) of the Act, and do 
not provide a sufficient basis for 
determining whether live-in workers 
subject to § 13(b)(21) of the Act have 
been paid at least the minimum wage 
for all hours worked. Therefore, the 
Department proposes to amend the 
regulations to revise the definitions of 
‘‘domestic service employment’’ and 
‘‘companionship services,’’ and to 
require employers of live-in domestic 
workers to maintain an accurate record 
of hours worked by such employees. In 
addition, the proposed regulation would 
limit the scope of duties a companion 
may perform, and would prohibit 
employees of third-party employers 
from claiming the exemption. 
Summary of Impacts 

The Department projects that the 

average annualized cost of the rule will 
total about $4.7 million per year over 10 
years. In addition to the direct cost to 
employers of the rule, there are also 
transfer effects resulting from the rule. 
The primary impacts of the rule are

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

income transfers to home health care 
workers in the form of: increased hourly 
wages to reach minimum wage (about 
$16.1 million in the first year, negligible 
thereafter); payment for time spent 
traveling between patients (average 
annualized value of $34.7 million per 
year); and payment of an overtime 
premium when hours worked exceed 40 
hours per week. Because overtime 
payments depend on how employers 
adjust scheduling to eliminate or reduce 
overtime hours, the Department 
considered three adjustment scenarios 
resulting in payment of: 100 percent of 
current overtime hours worked (average 
annualized value of $180.7 million per 
year); 50 percent of current overtime 
hours worked (average annualized value 
of $90.4 million per year); or no 

payment of overtime. On the basis of 
previous evidence on the impact of 
overtime pay, the Department judges 
that overtime payments in the range of 
scenarios 2 and 3 are more likely than 
scenario 1. 

Although the transfer of income to 

workers in the form of higher wages is 
not considered a cost of the rule from 
a societal perspective, higher wages do 
increase the cost of providing home 
health care services, resulting in the 
provision of fewer services. This 
reduction in the provision of services 
causes the market to function less 
efficiently, and this allocative 
inefficiency is a cost from a societal 
perspective. With a 3% real rate, the 
Department measures the range of 
average annualized deadweight loss 

attributable to this allocative 
inefficiency as $105,000 when no 
overtime pay adjustment is assumed, 
$36,000 when 50% of overtime pay is 
assumed to adjust and $3,000 when a 
100% adjustment in overtime pay is 
assumed. The relatively small 
deadweight loss primarily occurs 
because both the demand for and supply 
of home health care services appear to 
be inelastic—that is, the equilibrium 
quantity of companionship services is 
not very responsive to changes in price, 
possibly due to the importance of these 
services and the coverage of many 
companionship services by Medicare 
and Medicaid. Table 1 summarizes the 
projected costs, transfer effects and 
impacts of the proposed revisions to the 
FLSA.

State Law Requirements 

In evaluating the economic impact of 

the proposed rule, it is important to 

consider the current wage requirements 
for home health care workers. There are 
numerous state laws pertaining to home 
health care workers. The State Medicaid 

Manual requires states to develop 
qualifications or requirements (such as 
background checks, training, age, 
supervision, health, literacy, or

education, or other requirements) for 
Medicaid-financed personal care 
attendants. These state programs can 
each have multiple delivery models, 
with care being agency-directed or 
consumer-directed with care given by 
agencies or independent providers. 
These delivery models are not 
necessarily mutually exclusive. In 
general, for the purposes of this 
analysis, we refer to independent 
providers as workers providing services 
through informal arrangements, and 
therefore they are not counted in the 
statistics on home health care providers 
used as the basis for this analysis. 

A 2006 report by the HHS Office of 
the Inspector General (OIG) found that 
states have established multiple sets of 
worker requirements that often vary 
among the programs within a state and 
among the delivery models within 
programs, resulting in 301 sets of 
requirements nationwide.9 Four of the 
consumer-directed programs in the OIG 
review had no attendant requirements. 

Furthermore, states define these 

requirements differently, and specify 
different combinations of requirements 
in different programs. The most 
common requirements, and some 
characterization of how these might be 
defined by different programs, include: 

• Background Checks. May include 

the following: criminal background 
checks; checks of abuse or neglect 
registries; and checks of Federal or State 
exclusion lists for previous fraudulent 
or abusive activities. 

• Training. May include the 

following: First aid or cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR); basic health 
knowledge (e.g., food and nutrition, 
blood-borne pathogens, hygiene, 
universal precautions); assistance with 
daily living activities (e.g., patient 
transfer techniques, proper patient 
bathing and showering techniques, and 
grooming); program orientation (e.g., 
beneficiary rights and responsibilities, 
safety, behavioral issues, patient 
confidentiality); training specific to an 
individual beneficiary’s needs; or other 
training. 
• Supervision. Might be performed by 

registered or licensed practical nurses 
(RN or LPN); home health or personal 
care service agency staff; case managers; 
other qualified staff or individuals; or 
the beneficiary. 

• Minimum Age. Most commonly set 
at 18-years-old, but in some states might 
be 14-years-old, 19-years-old, or of 
‘‘legal working age.’’ 

• Health. May include the following: 
Test negative for tuberculosis; be able to 
perform the services in the plan of care; 
meet an established minimum level of 

physical ability (e.g., able to lift a 
certain weight or stand for a certain 
time); be free of communicable disease; 
pass a physical examination; or drug 
test. 

• Education/Literacy. Minimum 

requirements might include: An ability 
to read and write adequately to follow 
instructions or to keep records; a 
General Education Diploma (GED) or 
high school diploma; completed a 
certain grade; be a Certified Nursing 
Assistant (CNA) or a home health aide; 
have a Homemaker/Personal Care 
Service Provider certification issued by 
the state; be able to communicate with 
the beneficiary and/or supervisory staff; 
pass a competency test or have previous 
experience; have the skills, knowledge, 
and abilities necessary to perform the 
services needed; be able to meet the 
needs of the beneficiary; or be mature 
and sympathetic. 

• Other. Might be required to: Have a 

Social Security number; have an 
identification card; be a U.S. citizen; or 
meet state motor vehicle requirements if 
providing transportation. 

The number of states that included 

each requirement in at least one 
program and the number of state 
program sets that include each 
requirement are summarized in Table

States’ laws also vary in whether they 

extend minimum wage and overtime 
provisions to home health care workers. 
In many states companions or home 
health care workers are not explicitly 
named in the regulations, but often fall 
under those regulations that apply to 
domestic service employees. 

• 16 states extend both minimum 
wage and overtime coverage to most 
home health care workers who would 
otherwise be excluded under the current 
regulations: California, Colorado, 
Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, 

Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New 
York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and 
Wisconsin. However, in some states 
certain types of these workers remain 
exempt, such as those employed 
directly by households or by non-profit 
organizations. Additionally, New York’s 
overtime law provides that workers who 
are exempt from the FLSA and 
employed by a third-party agency need 
only be paid time and one-half the 
minimum wage (as opposed to time and 
one-half of the worker’s regular wage). 

Minnesota’s overtime provision applies 
only after 48 hours of work. 

• Five states (Arizona, Nebraska, 

North Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota) 
and the District of Columbia extend 
minimum wage, but not overtime 
coverage to home care workers. There 
are again some exemptions for those

.................... All companions as defined in the FLSA are entitled to 
minimum wage. California’s overtime rules create in 
terms  of  overtime  four  categories  of  workers  who 
provide home care. (1) Those who are employed by 
non-profits  and  do  no  additional  work  beyond  feed-
ing, dressing, and supervising the person do not re-
ceive  overtime.  (2)  Those  who  are  employed  by 
non-profits  but  do  additional  work  beyond  feeding, 
dressing,  and  supervising  do  receive  overtime.  (3) 
All  for-profit  workers  receive  overtime  regardless  of 
their  job  description.  (4)  County-employed  home 
care  worker,  of  whom  there  are  approximately 
367,000, receive up to $11.50 an hour straight time 
per their union contracts and may also receive over-
time under those contracts.

definition of ‘‘companion’’ is much narrower than the 
FLSA definition. Companions may not help to bathe

keeping,  or  remind  the  person  to  take  medication. 
People  who  do  those  tasks  are  more  than  just

Data Sources 

The primary data services used by the 

Department to estimate the number of 
workers, establishments, and customers 
likely to be impacted by the proposed 
rule include: 

• Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 

2009 Occupational Employment Survey, 
employment and wages by state for SOC 
codes 39–9021 (Personal Care Aides) 
and 31–1011 (Home Health Aides); 

• BLS Quarterly Census of 

Employment and Wages, 2009 for 
NAICS 6216 and 62412; 

• BLS National Employment Matrix, 

2008; 

for NAICS 6216 and 62412; and 

• 2007 Statistics of U.S. Businesses, 
• 2007 Economic Census, by state for 

NAICS 6216 and 62412. 

The key limitation of this set of data 

sources is that it results in an 
inconsistency between the Department’s 
best estimate of agency-employed 
caregivers (from the 2009 BLS 
Occupational Employment Survey), and 
its best estimate of independent 
providers directly employed by families 
(from the 2008 BLS National 
Employment Matrix). The Occupational 
Employment Survey (OES) is employer 
based, and does not collect data from 
the self-employed. The National 

Employment Matrix (NEM) obtains 
estimates on the self-employed from the 
Current Population Survey. However, it 
is not possible to match the OES 
estimates by subtracting the estimated 
number of self-employed workers from 
the NEM. Because these two estimates 
cannot be completely reconciled, the 
Department uses each source as the best 
estimate for one segment of the labor 
market and acknowledges there is some 
inconsistency between the two.

next few decades with the aging of the 
‘‘baby boomer generation.’’ According to 
PHI: 

Nearly one out of four U.S. households 

provides care to a relative or friend aged 50 
or older and about 15 percent of adults care 
for a seriously ill or disabled family member. 
Over the next two decades the population 
over age 65 will grow to more than 70 million 
people [the U.S. population 65 years and 
older was estimated at 40 million in 2009 12]. 
Additionally, with significant increases in 
life expectancy and medical advances that 
allow individuals with chronic conditions to 
live longer, the demand for caregiving is 
expected to grow exponentially. The growth 
in the demand for in-home services is further 
amplified by an increasing preference for 
receiving supports and services in the home 
as opposed to institutional settings. This 
emphasis has been supported by the 
increased availability of publicly funded in- 
home services under Medicaid and Medicare 
as an alternative to traditional and 
increasingly costly institutional care.13 

While many recipients of home health 

care services are elderly, about two- 
fifths of those in need of these services 

are under 65 and include those with 
varying degrees of mental or 
developmental disabilities. This group 
of home health care recipients is also 
anticipated to grow rapidly as more 
individuals opt for home-based care 
over institutional settings.14 It is 
estimated that the demand for home 
health care workers will grow to 
approximately 5.7 to 6.6 million 
workers in 2050, an increase in the 
current demand for workers of between 
3.8 and 4.6 million (200 percent and 242 
percent respectively).15 The home 
health care industry has grown 
significantly over the past decade and is 
projected to continue growing rapidly; 
for example: 

• The number of establishments in 

Home Health Care Services (HHCS) 
grew by 70 percent between 2001 and 
2009; during that same period, the 
number of establishments in Services 
for the Elderly and Persons with 
Disabilities (SEPD) grew by 355 
percent.16 

• Between 2008 and 2018 the number 

of home health aides is projected to 
increase by 50 percent and the number 
of personal care aides by 46 percent. 
Employers and Funding Sources 

This section focuses on the employers 

of workers who are currently classified 
as companions and common sources of 
funding for the services they provide; 
the next section describes the workers 
and the work they do. Services in the 
home health care industry are provided 
through two general delivery models: 
Agencies and consumer-directed (which 
often use independent providers and 
family caregivers). 

Figure 2 provides a visual overview of 

the home care and personal assistance 
industry and the two primary models 
for service provision, which are 
discussed in more detail in the sections 
that follow. 
Figure 2. Overview of the Home Health 
Care Industry and Funding Sources 

Agency Model 

Under the agency model a third-party 

provider of home care and personal 
assistance services (usually a home 
health care company) employs the home 

care workers and is responsible for 
ensuring that services authorized by a 
public program or contracted for by a 
private party are in fact delivered.17 
There are currently about 73,000 

establishments providing these services. 
The services are paid for through public 
programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, 
and other state programs, and through 
private sources such as private health

billion in annual revenue dispersed to 
these agencies.18 

Agencies providing home care and 

personal assistance services are covered 

by two primary industries: Home Health 
Care Services (HHCS, NAICS 6216), and 
Services for Elderly and Persons with 
Disabilities (SEPD, NAICS 62412).19 
HHCS is dominated by for-profit 
agencies that are Medicare-certified and 
depends on public programs for three- 
quarters of its revenue.20 SEPD is a 

rapidly growing industry that is 
dominated by small non-profit 
enterprises. Table 2–1 provides an 
overview of these two industries in 
terms of number of employees, 
establishments, payroll and wages, and 
estimated revenues.

[a] Employees include HHA, PCA, and other occupations. 
Sources: BLS QCEW 2009; BLS National Employment Matrix, 2008. 

These two industries primarily 

employ workers as home health aides 
(HHA) and personal care aides (PCA) in 
addition to other occupations. However, 
not all of the HHA and PCA employed 
by these agencies work as companions 
under the companionship exemption; 
these agencies provide a variety of 
health-related services that may be 
delivered in private homes (and 
potentially companionship services) or 
in public or private facilities (and not 
defined as companionship services). 
Simply put, only a fraction of the 1.7 
million employees listed in the table 
above are currently working as exempt 
companions who may see changes in 
their wages and/or work schedules as a 
result of the proposed rule. 

Within these two industries there are 

three broad employer types: Home 
health care companies, for-profit 
franchise chains, and private-duty home 
care companies. The latter two types are 
smaller, emerging types of employers 
that focus on the provision of non- 
medical care for clients. Home health 
care companies focus on providing 
medically-oriented home health care 
services and non-medical home care or 
personal assistance services. Many of 
these agencies are Medicare-certified; 
those that avoid obtaining certification 
do so because they do not provide the 
skilled nursing care required by 
Medicare. These companies also derive 
a significant portion of their revenue 
from the provision of medical devices to 
customers.21 

Consumer-Directed Models 

Under the consumer-directed model, 
the consumer or his/her representative 
has more control than in the agency- 
directed model over the services 
received, and when, how, and by whom 
the services are provided. The 
approaches to delivering services under 
this model range from the more formal 
state-organized systems to informal 
arrangements coordinated through 
word-of-mouth between care recipients. 
In the public version of this model, the 
care is funded either by Medicaid, 
directly by states, or through programs 
or grants administered by the HHS 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS). 

Other recipients arrange for and pay 

for care privately through informal 
negotiations with individual service 
providers. In this model, the customer 
may act as the sole or a joint employer 
and has varying degrees of 
responsibility for interviewing, hiring, 
training, managing, and firing the 
provider. Due to the sometimes informal 
nature of the consumer-directed 
employment arrangements, there are no 
data on the total number of customers 
under this model, and there is limited 
information on the total number of 
providers. BLS National Employment 
Matrix data show that 127,000 Personal 
Care Aides (about 16 percent) are 
employed in private households and 
61,500 (about 8 percent) are self- 
employed, for a total of 188,500 workers 
(about 23 percent) that may provide 
services as independent contractors.22 

Fewer Home Health Aides are employed 
in this manner, with 1,700 (less than 
one percent) working for private 
households and 16,400 (about two 
percent) who are self-employed. 
Combining the data for Personal and 
Home Health Aides suggests that 
206,600 of these workers (about twelve 
percent) may be either self-employed or 
employed in private households. The 
Department believes that these workers 
can reasonably be described as 
independent providers that directly 
provide caregiver services to families, 
perhaps through informal arrangements. 

However, consumer-directed 

employment is sometimes referred to as 
a ‘‘grey market;’’ that contains an 
element of ‘‘over-the-back-fence 
network of women [who are] usually 
untrained, unscreened, and 
unsupervised, but more affordable 
without an agency’s fee, less 
constrained by regulations and hired 
through personal recommendation.’’ 23 
The term ‘‘grey market’’ is sometimes 
used to suggest that at least some of 
these private arrangements are designed 
to avoid applicable labor laws; the 
extent to which care recipients use 
private arrangements for this purpose is 
unclear; there is very little information 
available about this segment of the 
market for home health services. It is 
also possible, and likely, that care 
providers who are employed by an 
agency or who provide services through 
a state registry also occasionally provide 
services through informal arrangements. 
The Department’s best estimate of 
consumer-directed employment is

19 These two industries are the primary employers 

of workers currently classified as companions; 
however, based on data reported by BLS in the 
National Employment Matrix there are 

approximately 25 other industries that also employ 
these workers. Since these other industries employ 
so few of the workers under consideration here they 
will be minimally affected by this proposed rule.

summarized in the previous paragraph, 
and we are unable to estimate the extent 
to which the group of providers 
described above participates in the 
informal market. We are also unable to 
characterize the extent to which other 
providers not included in this estimate 
participate in the ‘‘grey market.’’ 

There is no consolidated source of 

data on state consumer-directed 
programs; however, PHI offers an 
overview of what programs are offered: 
Seven states have no publicly-funded 
consumer-directed program, 38 states 
offer options under one or more 
Medicaid Waivers, seven states offer 
options under Medicaid Home Health 
programs, and 12 states offer consumer/ 
participant-directed options under 
Medicaid Personal Care Option.24 

Of those states that do offer a 

consumer-directed program, some have 
implemented a ‘‘public authority’’ 
model. In this model, a public authority 
or some other governmental or quasi- 
governmental entity plays a role in 
setting compensation and other 
employment terms for the service 
provider, who is compensated through 
public funds, acts as the ‘‘employer-of- 
record,’’ and may provide training, and 
create and maintain registries of 
providers.25 Service providers in this 
system have the option to select 
representatives for collective bargaining 
with the state. Six states (California, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, 
Washington, and Wisconsin) have fully 
implemented a public authority, and 
Missouri is in the process of doing so. 
Several states have implemented a 
consumer-directed program without 
creating a public authority, they 
include: Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, and 
Ohio. 

California’s policies are of particular 

note because it has one of the largest 
home care caseloads. This is due to a 
combination of demographic factors and 
a robust social movement of the 
disabled community that created 
Centers for Independent Living in the 
1970s.26 California’s In-Home 
Supportive Services (IHSS) program was 
created in 1973. IHSS is the largest 
personal care program in the nation and 
is funded through a combination of 
state, county, and federal Medicaid 
funds.27 A 2000 study of independent

home care workers found that IHSS 
employed more than 200,000 
independent personal care workers 
through IHSS, 72,000 in Los Angeles 
County alone. 

IHSS initially allowed counties to 

organize the service in different ways, 
and each had a different approach to 
employing the worker. Under the 
individual provider model, the 
consumer hired the worker and the 
worker was considered an independent 
contractor, with the state paying for the 
service and social workers allocating 
hours. Under the county model, the 
worker was a government employee. 
Under the contract model, the county 
contracted with an agency which 
became the employer.28 Ambiguity 
about who was really employing IHSS 
workers continued in the following 
decades. In 1985, California’s attorney 
general determined that IHSS attendants 
came under state workers’ 
compensation and other labor laws, and 
were county employees for purposes of 
collective bargaining. However in 
Service Employees International Union, 
Local 434 v. County of Los Angeles, the 
court found IHSS workers to be 
independent contractors because the 
counties did not control their activities 
directly.29 In 1992, California began to 
establish county-based public 
authorities. Under the public authority 
model, workers are no longer self- 
employed, and the employer 
responsibilities are split between the 
public authority (which serves as the 
employer in collective bargaining with 
the union) and the consumer (who is 
responsible for the selecting, hiring, and 
supervising of workers).30 Today there 
are approximately 367,000 home care 
workers employed by the California 
public authority.31 

In an effort to connect participants in 
consumer-directed programs with care 
providers, some states and public 
authorities have created matching 
registries; these systems provide some 
insight into how consumers identify 
care providers to meet their needs. 
Depending on the registry, consumers 
can either search the worker database 
online, or speak to trained staff who 
conduct the search and report the 
results to the consumer. Some registries 
may also offer worker screening and 
orientation, access to consumer and

worker training, and recruitment and 
outreach to potential workers.32 Others 
stipulate that providers in the database 
have not been pre-screened in any way 
and such responsibilities lie with the 
consumer. The PHI Matching Services 
Project 33 has identified 16 state-based 
matching services and six states with 
regional matching services. Of the 16 
state-based matching services, five 
(California, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Oregon, and Washington) operate under 
a public authority. Wisconsin’s registry, 
which also operates under a public 
authority, is currently regional but 
scheduled to become state-wide in 2011. 
These registries are listed in Table A–1 
in APPENDIX A. PHI notes that these 
public matching registries are not to be 
confused with the registries that exist in 
all states to perform criminal 
background checks on potential care 
providers or verify nursing training. 

The Department also located registries 
operated by not-for-profit organizations, 
such as the Meals on Wheels of Contra 
Costa County Home Care Registry,34 
where the registry recruits, screens, and 
checks the references of local care 
providers, but the care providers are 
self-employed and work as independent 
contractors. Various private sector 
entities that refer to themselves as 
registries, 35 36 37 38 however, appear to 
be operating under an agency or quasi- 
agency model, with the care recipient 
paying the company a weekly or bi- 
weekly registry fee in addition to paying 
the caregiver, or with the company 
receiving some portion of the caregiver’s 
hourly rate. 

When consumers are allowed to hire 
any worker they choose, many choose 
friends or family members. For instance, 
the Cash and Counseling demonstration 
program provides a monthly allowance 
to Medicaid beneficiaries that 
beneficiaries can use to hire their choice 
of worker. In this program, 58 percent

of directly hired workers in Florida, 71 
percent in New Jersey, and 78 percent 
in Arkansas were related to the 
consumer, and about 80 percent of those 
directly hired workers had provided 
unpaid care to the consumer before the 
demonstration began. 

Since the passage of the National 
Family Caregiver Support Program 
enacted under the Older Americans Act 
Amendments of 2000, Medicaid waivers 
and state-funded programs have 
provided the bulk of public financing to 
support family caregiving.39 A survey of 
state consumer direction and family 
caregiving programs found that: 

Over one-half (86 out of 150, or 57 

percent) of the programs in 44 states and 
the District of Columbia say family 
members can be paid to provide care. 
Viewed another way, the vast majority 
of programs that offer some component 
of consumer direction, allow payment to 
relatives to provide care (86 out of 106 
programs, or 81 percent). Only six states 
(Alaska, Delaware, Mississippi, Nevada, 
Pennsylvania, and Tennessee) did not 
allow payments to family members in 
any of their programs at the time of the 
study.40 

Of the 86 programs that allow 
relatives to be paid providers, 73 
percent allow family members to 
provide personal care, 70 percent allow 
family members to provide respite care, 
20 percent allow family members to act 
as homemakers or do chores, and 6 
percent allowed family members to 
provide any service needed.41 Some 
programs place restrictions on what 
type of family members are allowed to 
be paid providers as well. Among these 
86 programs, 61 percent do not permit 
spouses to be paid providers, while 

others do not permit parents/guardians 
(37 percent), primary caregivers (18 
percent), legal guardians (8 percent), 
children 18 and under (6 percent), or 
other relatives (4 percent).42 These 
programs and their stipulations about 
payment to family caregivers are 
summarized in Table B–1 in 
APPENDIX B. 
Funding Sources 

There are a variety of different 

funding sources for provision of home 
health services. Table 2–3 provides an 
overview of these funding sources, care 
recipient eligibility requirements, and 
types of home health services covered. 
Public funding sources such as 
Medicare and Medicaid provide a 
majority of the reimbursement for 
services. In 2008, Medicare and 
Medicaid accounted for nearly 75 
percent of home health care services 
revenue, followed by 15 percent from 
private insurance coverage, five percent 
from patients paying out-of-pocket, and 
the remaining five percent contributed 
by a mix of other government 
programs.43 

In 2009, HHS outlays for Medicare 

programs totaled $424 billion, and 
outlays in support of Medicaid totaled 
$251 billion.44 Under Medicare, an 
estimated $18.3 billion went to home 
health programs.45 In 2006, Medicaid 
programs accounted for approximately 
$38.1 billion (about $40 billion inflated 
to 2009 dollars) through Medicaid Home 
Health ($4.6 billion), State-Plan 
Personal Care Services benefit ($8.5 
billion), and Medicaid Home and 
Community-based Services (HCBS) 
benefits ($25 billion).46 Thus, payments 

for home health care programs 
composed approximately 4 percent of 
Medicare spending, and about 15 
percent of Medicaid spending. 

Both Medicaid and Medicare pay the 
service provider directly. The Medicare 
program uses a prospective payment 
system (PPS) to reimburse home health 
agencies a pre-determined base payment 
for an episode of care; this base payment 
is adjusted for the condition and needs 
of the beneficiary as well as geographic 
variation in wages.47 Under Medicaid, 
the state agency implementing the 
program pays the service provider 
directly except under certain consumer- 
directed programs. 

The Medicare and Medicaid programs 

also work together to provide services 
for a group of care recipients referred to 
as ‘‘dual eligibles,’’ that is, care 
recipients that are eligible for both 
Medicare and Medicaid coverage. 
Studies have found that individuals 
covered by both Medicare and Medicaid 
are among the most expensive groups to 
cover and are more likely to use more 
Medicare-covered home health services 
than Medicare home health care 
patients not also covered by Medicaid. 
Also, states with low Medicaid 
spending appear to shift costs to the 
Medicare home health program 
spending.48 Most of the public matching 
registries listed in Appendix A are 
funded by the state, with a few receiving 
federal dollars through reimbursement 
for Medicaid administrative costs or 
receiving initial funding through federal 
Medicaid Systems Transformation 
grants.49

Home Health Care Workers 

Number of Affected Workers 

This section provides an estimate of 

the total number of home health care 
workers who may be impacted by the 
proposed rule as well as the 
characteristics of these workers, the 
services they provide, and the wages 
they receive for their work. 

The workers who will be directly 

affected by the change to the 
companionship exemption are 
concentrated in two occupations: Home 
Health Aides (SOC 31–1011) and 
Personal Care Aides (39–9021). These 
workers are concentrated in two 

industries: Home Health Care Services 
(NAICS 6216) and Services for the 
Elderly and Disabled Persons (NAICS 
62412). 

These workers are predominantly 

women in their mid-forties, minorities, 
with a high school diploma or less 
education but this varies highly by

region. A similar percentage of PCAs are 
Black and Hispanic (20% and 19%, 
respectively), but a much higher 
percentage of HHAs are Black (35%) 
than Hispanic (8%). One in four (25%) 
PCAs are foreign-born, with higher 
percentages (over 50%) in certain 
regions of the country, e.g., California 
and New York. California also has a 
high percentage of caregivers who are 
paid family members.50 

Home health care workers are called 
by a variety of titles, including: home 
health aides, home care aides, personal 
care aides, personal assistants, home 
attendants, homemakers, companions, 
personal care staff, resident care aides, 
and direct support professionals. They 
are tracked by the following 
occupational titles.51 

Personal Care Aide (SOC 39–9021): 
‘‘Assist the elderly, convalescents, or 
persons with disabilities with daily 
living activities at the person’s home or 
in a care facility. Duties performed at a 
place of residence may include keeping 
house (making beds, doing laundry, 
washing dishes) and preparing meals. 
May provide assistance at non- 
residential care facilities. May advise 
families, the elderly, convalescents, and 
persons with disabilities regarding such 
things as nutrition, cleanliness, and 
household activities.’’ 

Home Health Aide (SOC 31–1011): 

‘‘Provide routine individualized 
healthcare such as changing bandages 
and dressing wounds, and applying 
topical medications to the elderly, 
convalescents, or persons with 
disabilities at the patient’s home or in 
a care facility. Monitor or report changes 
in health status. May also provide 
personal care such as bathing, dressing, 
and grooming of patient.’’ 

Note that the companionship services 

of fellowship and protection are not 
included in either the definition of 
personal care aide or home health aide. 
Companionship services as defined in 
this NPRM are separate from the 
services provided by home health care 
workers as defined officially above and 
outlined in detail below. 

The Department uses BLS’ employer- 

based OES estimate of the number of 
workers in the PCA and HHA 
occupational categories as its best 
estimate of the number of caregivers 
employed by agencies that might be 
affected by the proposed rule. There 
were approximately 1.59 million 
caregivers employed by agencies in 
2009, composed of

• 631,000 PCAs, and 
• 955,000 HHAs.52 
These data do not include workers 

providing these services as independent 
providers who may be affected by the 
proposed rule. As described above, the 
Department determined from the NEM 
that an estimated additional 

• 188,500 PCAs, and 
• 18,100 HHAs 53 

can be considered independent 
providers directly employed by families. 
Thus, we estimate 
• 819,500 PCAs, and 
• 973,100 HHAs, 

for a total of 1.79 million caregivers, 
might be affected by the proposed rule. 
However, not all 1.79 million of these 
PCAs and HHAs are employed as FLSA- 
exempt companions. Many of these 
workers are employed at agencies that 
provide a variety of health-related 
services that may or may not be 
provided in the home; HHA and PCA 
employed in facilities, such as nursing 
homes and hospitals, are not classified 
as providing companionship services. 
Furthermore, many of these workers 
who are classified as companions are 
employed in states which currently 
provide minimum wage and overtime 
coverage. Only a subset of the 1.79 
million workers, those who provide 
services in the home and are not eligible 
for minimum wage or overtime pay 
under state law, will be directly 
impacted by the proposed rule. The 
Department will define the number of 
workers directly affected by both the 
minimum wage and overtime pay 
provisions of the proposed rule. 
While many agency-employed 
caregivers might work in various 
facilities that make them ineligible for 
the FLSA companionship exemption, 
there is little information available 
concerning independent providers. The 
Department assumes that all PCAs and 
HHAs classified in the NEM as self- 
employed or employed by households 
are independent providers directly 
employed by the family, and are thus by 
assumption currently exempt from the 
FLSA. 
Tasks, Wages, Hours 

Traditionally, companionship tasks 

have been defined to include 
fellowship, care, protection, and a 
limited amount of assistance with 
general household tasks.54 

• Fellowship: Defined in the 

proposed regulation as meaning ‘‘to 

engage the person in social, physical, 
and mental activities, including 
conversation, reading, games, crafts, 
walks, errands, appointments, and 
social events’’.55 Fellowship services are 
generally not covered by public 
programs. 

• Protection: Defined in the proposal 

as ‘‘being present with the person in 
their home or to accompany the person 
when outside of the home to monitor 
the person’s safety and well-being.’’ 56 
Some states reimburse specific types of 
participants (i.e., those living with 
mental disabilities) for protection 
services. 

• Social support: Services that enable 

the consumer to take an active part in 
his or her family and community, 
includes accompanying the consumer to 
regular social activities and ensuring 
that the consumer’s cognitive state does 
not deteriorate due to social isolation. 
The spectrum of tasks performed by 

modern workers classified as 
companions has expanded beyond 
traditional companionship to include: 
activities of daily living (ADLs), 
instrumental activities of daily living 
(IADLs), and paramedical 
(‘‘medicalized’’) tasks. 

• ADLs: Assistance with the 

following activities: personal hygiene, 
dressing and changing clothes, 
transferring, toileting, eating and 
drinking, maintaining continence, and 
ambulation. 
• IADLs: Includes tasks such as light 

housework, preparation of meals, 
assistance with physical taking of 
medications, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, escorting, 
assistance with the management of 
money, and other tasks that allow the 
consumer to live independently in the 
community. 

• Paramedical tasks: May include 

tasks such as changing of aseptic 
dressings, administration of non- 
injectible medications (e.g., blood 
pressure medication in tablet form); 57 
and ostomy, catheter and bowel 
hygiene. 

While PCAs and HHAs overlap to 

some extent in the type of services they 
provide—both generally provide 
assistance with ADLs and IADLs—it is 
primarily HHAs who are employed by 
Medicare-certified agencies who may be 
asked to perform paramedical tasks. 
Those workers are required by Medicare 
to be trained and certified to perform 
these types of tasks.

81213 

Generally speaking, a home health 

aide or agency is authorized to provide 
a specific number of hours of service to 
care recipients depending on their 
needs. Agencies work to schedule home 
health aides to cover the number of 
hours needed for the portfolio of cases 
they have, often taking into account 
continuity of service to each recipient, 
total number of hours each aide is 
scheduled per week, frequency of 
weekend services needed, and the 
distance between the aide’s home 
residence and the care recipient’s. In the 
home care industry, agencies typically 
strive to provide services seven days a 
week and 24 hours a day. 

The greatest scheduling challenges to 
the agencies come from 12-hour and 24- 
hour (or sleep-in) cases; these cases are 
also of particular concern with respect 
to overtime. A 12-hour case is a care 
recipient who requires services to be 
provided by a home health aide for a 12- 
hour block of time; a 24-hour case is a 
care recipient who requires a home 
health aide to be present to provide 
services around the clock. The key 
scheduling concerns that agencies 
contend exist with these cases are that: 
• Because workers are scheduled to 
work in lengthy shifts (up to 12 hours), 
it is difficult to redistribute overtime 
hours to workers with fewer hours; 

• Aides are paid an hourly rate, plus 

an hourly overtime premium where 
applicable; however, agencies are often 
reimbursed for these cases on a flat rate 
that does not account for overtime 
premiums or other costs; 

• Sleep-in cases usually include an 

eight-hour period to allow the worker to 
sleep while on site; however, the aide is 
not necessarily off-duty because s/he 
would be expected to assist the client if 
an urgent need arose. If the agency is 
required to count sleep hours toward 
the total number of hours worked per 
week then it may become costly to 
provide 24-hour care. 

Some agencies take a proactive 

approach to scheduling these cases in 
order to manage the total number of 
hours on duty required from each 
worker. For example, an agency may 
split a 12-hour case between two aides 
by having one aide provide services 
Sunday through half of the Wednesday 
shift when the second aide would take 
over and work through Saturday.58 This 
reduces the total number of hours each 
aide must work, limits the work to one 
weekend day, and avoids overwhelming 
the care recipient with too many

different care providers. A similar 
approach may be applied to cases that 
require 24-hour care.59 

The workers themselves report 

working an average of 31 to 35 hours per 
week and available data suggest that 
very few work overtime.60 Based on an 
analysis of the 2007 National Home 
Health Aide Survey and the 2009 
Annual Social and Economic 
Supplement of the Current Population 
Survey, PHI reports that 92 percent of 
HHAs and 85 percent of PCAs work less 
than 40 hours per week for an average 
of 31 hours and 35 hours per week, 
respectively. By extension, only eight 
percent of HHAs and 15 percent of 
PCAs reported working greater than 40 
hours per week. 

However, this information may not 

fully capture the total number of hours 
worked by these individuals because 
some aides work for multiple 
employers, many aides work part-time, 
and some employers do not compensate 
workers for travel time between clients 
(because they are not reimbursed for 
this time). Furthermore, there is very 
limited information on hours worked by 
independent providers or those working 
as live-in, on-call, or night shift aides. 
The Department assumes that in general 
independent providers directly 
employed by families work similar 
hours as caregivers employed by 
agencies. 

The wages for these workers vary 

widely by occupation and geographic 
location. Based on detailed wage data 
from the BLS Occupational Employment 
Statistics Survey, the hourly wages of 
PCAs and HHAs range from about $6.79 
to $20.61 (approximately 0.5% earn less 
than $6.79 and 0.5% earn more than 
$20.61) with the average wage being 
approximately $10.14.61 As discussed 
above, wages for PCAs tend to be 
slightly lower on average than those for 
HHAs. The Department assumes that in 
general independent providers directly 
employed by families receive similar 
hourly wages as caregivers employed by 
agencies. In 70 percent of states (36 
states), average hourly wages for PCAs 
were below 200 percent of the federal 
poverty level wage ($10.42) for 
individuals in one-person households 
working full-time. Current research 

59 Some agencies have experimented with 

breaking a 24 hour case into two 12 hour cases that 
are staffed by four home care aides; this reduces 
total number of hours worked and eliminates the 
need for the 8 hour rest period but also increases 
the number of aides that the client must become 
comfortable with.

suggests that these workers find it 
difficult to support their households on 
these wages; approximately 44 percent 
of PCAs have to rely on public benefits 
and fewer than 20 percent report having 
health insurance.62 
Costs and Transfers 

This section describes the costs and 
transfers associated with the proposed 
rule and the Department’s approach to 
estimating their magnitude. The primary 
costs of this rule are expected to be 
regulatory familiarization. The 
Department estimates the first-year cost 
of the rule will total $9.9 million. In 
following years, regulatory 
familiarization costs are projected to 
increase from $3.5 million in year 2, to 
$4.4 million in year 10 as new firms 
enter the market and new families hire 
home health care workers. 

Transfers result from the wage 

increases to comply with minimum 
wage and overtime pay requirements. 
Total estimated transfers depend in part 
on the response of employers to the 
regulatory changes; in other words, will 
employers respond by paying overtime 
to current workers, changing scheduling 
practices to avoid paying overtime, 
hiring additional workers, or some 
combination of these approaches. Based 
on the methods described below, the 
Department estimates that first-year 
transfers from the rule will range from 
$42.8 to $182.1 million. In years 2 
through 10, the lower end of the range 
is projected to increase from $27.8 
million to $45.8 million while the upper 
end of the range is projected to increase 
from $172.6 million to $284.6 million. 

Total costs and transfers from the rule 
will range from $52.7 to $192.1 million 
in the first year. In subsequent years, the 
lower end of the range is projected to 
increase from $31.4 million to $50.2 
million in total costs and transfers. The 
upper range of total costs and transfers 
is projected to increase from $176.2 
million to $289.0 million. 
Regulatory Familiarization 

When a new rule is promulgated, all 
the establishments affected by the rule 
will need to invest time to read and 
understand the components of the new 
rule; this is commonly referred to as 
regulatory familiarization. Each 
establishment will spend resources to 
familiarize itself with the requirements 
of the rule and ensure it is in 
compliance. 

Each home health care establishment 

will require about two hours of an HR 
staff person’s time to read and review 
the new regulation, update employee

handbooks and make any needed 
changes to the payroll systems. Based 
on our analysis of the industry and 
occupational data, the Department 
judges that each employer in HHCS and 
SEPD likely employs workers who 
could be classified as companions and 
therefore will need to review the 
proposed rule. There are about 73,000 
establishments in SEPD and HHCS; 
assuming a mid-level HR wage of $26.79 
per hour over two hours equals about $4 
million for regulatory familiarization in 
the first year following promulgation of 
the rule.63 

For independent providers, the 

employer is considered to be the family 
that hires them. Therefore, families that 
directly employ these caregivers will 
also have to review the regulatory 
revisions. Because the employer- 
employee relationship is less complex 
than for an agency that employs 
multiple workers caring for multiple 
clients, the Department expects the 
burden of regulatory familiarization will 

be smaller. The Department therefore 
assumes that each family that directly 
hires a caregiver will spend one hour on 
regulatory familiarization. The 
Department uses the national average 
hourly wage of $29.07 (loaded) to 
represent the opportunity cost of 
reviewing the regulatory revisions.64 

The Department has found no data to 

support an estimate of the number of 
families that directly hire independent 
providers. The Department assumes 
each independent provider is hired by 
a single family, and therefore, because it 
estimates there are 206,600 independent 
providers, 206,600 families will incur 
the cost of one hour to review the 
revised regulations. These families incur 
one hour of time at an opportunity cost 
of $29.07 per hour for a total of about 
$6 million for regulatory familiarization 
in the first year following promulgation 
of the rule. The Department 
acknowledges this estimate is based on 
an assumed value and requests from 
commenters information or data that 

would allow it to better estimate the 
number of families that directly hire 
independent providers. 
Wages and Overtime 65 

Many home care workers are already 

covered by minimum wage and 
overtime provisions at the state level 
and will not drive additional costs 
related to the proposed rule. Sixteen 
states require minimum wage for all 
hours worked for most home health care 
workers and guarantee some type of 
overtime pay for home health care 
workers who would otherwise be 
excluded under the FLSA.66 Five states 
and the District of Columbia require 
minimum wage for all hours worked but 
do not guarantee overtime. 67 Twenty- 
nine states do not require minimum 
wage or overtime. Table 3–1 
summarizes the wages for PCA and 
HHA occupations based on state level 
minimum wage and overtime coverage.

Source: BLS OES, 2009; Note: based on the hourly wage percentiles, the minimum wage paid to workers is below the Federal minimum wage 

in some states with minimum wage laws. 

In order to define the subset of 

workers from the table that will be 
directly affected by the minimum wage 
and overtime components of the 
proposed rule, the Department made 
three primary calculations: (1) Removed 
from the data set those workers not 
currently employed as exempt 
companions (those providing services in 
facilities rather than homes); (2) added 
employees of tax exempt organizations 
in states with overtime coverage to the 

set of workers without state-level 
overtime coverage (as they are 
sometimes exempt from the state 
overtime laws); and (3) identified the 
number of workers currently receiving 
less than the federal minimum wage 
($7.25 per hour). 

The data presented in Table 3–1 do 

not differentiate the workers who 
provide services in the homes of clients 
(eligible for companionship services 
exemption) and those that provide 

services primarily in facility settings 
(not eligible for companionship services 
exemption). To identify agency- 
employed HHAs and PCAs likely to be 
providing services in facilities and 
exclude them from the estimation of 
costs, the Department examined the BLS 
National Employment Matrix of 
industries for each occupation. Based on 
the description of the industry 
employing the HHA or PCA, the 
Department made a judgment of 

63 Mid-level HR loaded hourly rate from BLS.

home; then, the number of workers 
likely to be providing services in the 
home were summed and compared to 
the total number of workers in the 
occupation to estimate the percent of 
that occupation providing services in 

the home. Table 3–2 summarizes the 
data as well as the determination of 
whether the industry would be home or 
facility-based. This percentage, 
approximately 80 percent of PCAs and 
45 percent of HHAs, is used to adjust 
the number of workers below minimum 
wage and the number of workers 

without overtime pay used in the more 
detailed calculations described below. 
By definition, the Department assumes 
that 100 percent of PCAs and HHAs 
working as independent providers work 
in the home setting.

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

It is important to note that the 

determination of whether the industry is 
home- or facility-based is an estimate; 
some industries that appear to provide 
services primarily in a nursing facility, 
for example, may employ a few aides 
who provide services in the homes of 
clients to assist with transitioning of the 
client from the facility back to their 
home. Also, some industries that appear 
to provide services primarily in the 
home, HHCS for example, may also 
employ aides that work primarily in 
facilities. 

Next, the workers in the states with 

minimum wage and overtime pay are, in 
general, already receiving at least the 
minimum wage and some form of 
overtime premium for hours worked 
beyond 40 hours and do not need to be 
included when calculating the costs 
associated with additional wages 
resulting from the application of the 
federal minimum wage or payment of an 
overtime premium. The exception is for 
workers employed by public agencies, 
non-profit organizations, and other tax 
exempt entities who are exempt from 
many of the applicable state laws. To 
account for these workers, the 
Department used the 2007 Economic 
Census to estimate the proportion of 
workers in those states who are 
employed in establishments exempt 
from Federal income tax; this 
proportion was multiplied by the 
number of workers in each state to 
estimate the number of workers likely to 
be employed by an employer not 
covered by the state level laws related 
to minimum wage and overtime.68 
These workers were added to the total 
number of workers without overtime 
coverage in order to estimate the costs 
of providing overtime pay to workers 
under the proposed rule. States vary 

widely in terms of exemptions from 
minimum wage and overtime rules and 
not all states have these types of 
exemptions; as a result, this approach 
results in an overestimate of the number 
of workers who will receive additional 
overtime wages as a result of the 
proposed rule. The Department judges 
that this is the best available method to 
estimate these additional workers given 
available data. 

The Department then analyzed the 
2009 BLS OES data on PCA and HHA 
wages by percentile to identify those 
workers receiving less than the federal 
minimum wage (usually those in the 
10th and 25th percentiles in states 
without minimum wage coverage). 

Finally, due to lack of data, the 

Department selected the assumptions it 
would use to analyze independent 
providers directly employed by families. 
The Department assumes that 
independent providers: (1) Generally 
will not be eligible for overtime wage 
premiums, and (2) earn less than the 
current federal minimum wage in the 
same proportion as agency-employed 
caregivers. 

To be eligible for the overtime wage 

premium, an independent provider 
would have to work more than 40 hours 
per week for the same employer (i.e., 
family); an agency-employed caregiver 
is eligible if he or she works more than 
40 hours for the agency regardless of the 
number of families visited. Thus, the 
Department believes that independent 
providers are much less likely to be 
eligible for the overtime premium than 
agency-employed workers; those 
independent providers who work more 
than 40 hours per week are likely to be 
employed by more than one family. 

By assuming that the proportion of 

independent providers earning less than 
the federal minimum wage is identical 

to that for agency-employed caregivers, 
the Department implicitly assumes 
independent providers work in similar 
patterns as agency-employed caregivers. 
That is, independent providers are 
distributed across states in the same 
proportion as agency-employed 
caregivers, and are as likely to earn less 
than minimum wage as those employed 
by agencies. 

Table 3–3 summarizes the number of 

workers estimated to be directly 
impacted by the minimum wage and 
overtime provisions of the proposed 
rule. These numbers reflect the 
adjustments discussed above that 
account for employees of tax-exempt 
organizations not covered by their 
state’s overtime requirements and for 
the percent of workers likely to be 
employed in a home versus a facility. 
These estimates are described in more 
detail in the following sections. 

From the initial total of 1.59 million 

agency-employed workers, the 
Department estimates 934,000 are 
employed in homes as exempt 
companions. Of all agency-employed 
PCAs and HHAs, the Department 
estimates that 738,000, almost 47 
percent are unlikely to be covered by 
current overtime provisions 69 and 
31,000 (1.9%) are paid less than the 
federal minimum wage. 

Since 3.9 percent of agency-employed 
PCAs earn less than minimum wage, the 
Department assumes 3.9 percent of the 
188,500 PCA independent providers 
also earn less than minimum wage, 
about 7,350 caregivers. Similarly, 
because 0.7 percent of agency-employed 
HHAs earn less than minimum wage, 
0.7 percent of the 18,100 HHA 
independent providers, about 120 
workers, also earn less than minimum 
wage.

68 The Department used a proportion of 100 

percent for workers in New York to account for the 
fact that New York law establishes an overtime 
premium for these workers of one and one-half 
times the minimum wage (rather than the workers’ 

regular rate). This produces an overestimate of the 
number of workers who will receive additional 
overtime pay as a result of the proposed rule. 

69 The total number of workers without overtime 
coverage does not include the 367,000 providers in 

California because they are currently covered by an 
overtime provision under a collective bargaining 
agreement. If the terms of that agreement change, 
then costs will be impacted.

Minimum Wage 

Based on BLS data describing the 

wages of PCAs and HHAs by percentile, 
there are 14,200 HHAs and 30,700 PCAs 
in 13 states where the minimum wage 
is below the federal minimum wage of 
$7.25. Approximately 32,600 of those 
workers are providing services in homes 
rather than facilities (85 percent 
multiplied by 30,700, plus, 46 percent 
multiplied by 14,200), and therefore are 
receiving only their states’ minimum 
wage. The average wage of these 
workers is $7.02 per hour. As a result 
of the proposed changes to the 
companionship exemption, these 
workers will receive an additional $0.23 
per hour. Based on available data on the 
number of hours worked by PCAs and 
HHAs, drawn from several nationally 
representative surveys, the Department 
judges that 35 hours per week is a 
reasonable upper-bound assumption of 
the average number of hours worked per 
week. Assuming that each of these 
workers is employed for 52 weeks per 
year, and works an average of 35 hours 
per week 70 then the additional cost of 
wages paid to these workers will be 
approximately $13.0 million in the first 
year. Review of BLS data suggests that 
the number of workers earning less than 
minimum wage should be negligible in 
subsequent years.71

families, then all of the estimated 7,350 
PCAs and 120 HHAs earning less than 
the minimum wage provide service in 
homes, and no further adjustment to 
these numbers is necessary. If these 
7,470 caregivers also receive an 
additional $0.23 per hour to raise their 
wage to the federal minimum, and work 
an average of 35 hours per week, then 
the additional cost of wages paid to 
these workers will be approximately 
$3.1 million in the first year. With no 
evidence to the contrary, we maintain 
our working assumption that wages for 
self-employed caregivers track those of 
agency-employed caregivers. 
Overtime 

Limited data exist on the amount of 
overtime worked by this population. A 
PHI analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
Current Population Survey, Annual 
Social and Economic Supplement 
(ASEC) on home health care workers 
found 8 to 15 percent of PCAs and 
HHAs may work overtime. Among home 
health aides, 8 percent worked more 
than 40 hours per week, and 2 percent 
worked more than 50 hours per week; 
15 percent of personal care attendants 
appeared to work more than 40 hours 
per week, although PHI believes this 
may be an overestimate based on the 
2010 ASEC supplement that suggests 
that approximately 42 percent of aides 
in HHCS report working full-time year 
round. 72 

A significant overtime pay issue in 

this industry is associated with overtime

pay for the care of patients requiring 24- 
hour services. Attending staff may be 
eligible for pay up to 16 of every 24 
hours or even more (if the staff is not 
provided a bona fide sleep period). The 
City of New York and New York State 
Association of Counties filed an amicus 
brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in 
Long Island Care at Home, Inc. v. 
Coke.73 The brief asserted that changing 
the FLSA companionship services 
exemption would significantly increase 
the cost to the City and State for 
providing home healthcare services. The 
brief included an estimate of the 
increased costs. The additional costs for 
home health care workers in New York 
City attending patients requiring 24- 
hour attendance is by far the largest 
component of these costs, exceeding the 
Department’s estimate of nationwide 
overtime for all workers in all states not 
currently covered by overtime. 

Unfortunately the brief does not 
adequately describe how the cost 
estimates were arrived at, nor does it 
provide estimates of the number of 
patients requiring 24-hour care or the 
workers caring for them. The numbers 
presented in the brief suggest over 33.6 
million hours of annual overtime are 
worked just to care for patients 
requiring 24-hour care plus an 
additional 14.6 million hours of 
overtime hours are worked to care for 
other patients.74 This exceeds by 37

of New York and New York State Association of

under this regulation is the difference between the 
current hourly rate paid for home health care 
workers, and the rate that would be paid if this

percent the total amount of overtime the 
Department estimated for the 34 states 
and Washington, DC that do not 
currently require overtime pay, based on 
estimates of hours worked derived from 
a nationwide, statistically representative 
sample.75 Furthermore, this sample, 
from the Current Population Survey 
Annual Social and Economic 
Supplement, should reflect all hours 
worked, including that of home health 
care workers caring for patients 
requiring 24-hour care. In addition, the 
need to provide a patient with 24-hour 
care does not necessarily result in 72 
hours of overtime per week. 
Maintaining continuity of care does not 
require a single care giver in attendance 
for the entire week; service can be 
provided with adequate continuity of 
care by two or four workers.76 
Therefore, because the brief does not 
explain the basis for the numbers, the 
Department has not relied upon those 
estimates, but rather has generally relied 
upon nation-wide data from BLS in 
developing this economic impact 
analysis. 

BLS data show there are about 

492,000 total home health care workers 
in facilities and private homes in states 
without state-mandated overtime 
coverage, plus 143,000 workers 
employed in New York, and an 
additional 136,000 workers employed 
by tax-exempt organizations in states 
with overtime coverage who are not 
eligible for coverage. In total, the 
Department estimates that there are 
770,445 workers without overtime 
coverage that will be eligible for it as a 
result of the proposed rule. 

Based on the PHI analysis of ASEC 

data on overtime worked in this 
industry, the Department calculates that 
if 10 percent of these 770,445 home 
health care workers are employed 45 
hours per week (5 hours of overtime), 
and an additional 2 percent are 
employed 52.5 hours per week (12.5 
hours of overtime), then about 30 
million hours of overtime are worked 
per year. Using the weighted median 
wage of $9.51 per hour, these workers 
would earn an overtime premium of 
$4.75 per hour. Under these 

regulation is promulgated (i.e., the overtime 
differential) applied to hours worked in excess of 
40 hours per week. If straight time pay is currently 
about $10 per hour, the incremental cost will be $5 
per hour. New York City projects the rule will cost 
$168 million per year for care of patients requiring 
24 hour care; $168 million divided by $5 suggests 
that roughly 33.6 million overtime hours per year 
are worked in New York City alone to care for these 
patients. 

75 The PHI analysis is based on the U.S. Census 
Bureau, Current Population Survey, 2009 Annual 
Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement.

assumptions the additional cost of 
overtime pay would be approximately 
$143 million per year absent changes to 
employment practices that could reduce 
or even eliminate overtime for these 
employees.77 

As described above, the Department 
does not expect independent providers 
to be affected by overtime provisions. It 
expects few, if any, of these caregivers 
work more than 40 hours per week for 
the same family. 
Market Response to Overtime 
Requirement 

It is highly unlikely that agencies will 

simply accept overtime costs without 
changing operating and staffing policies. 
Currently, agencies have little incentive 
to manage overtime because hours 
worked in excess of 40 per week are 
paid at the same rate as hours less than 
40 per week. Because overtime hours 
will now cost agencies more, they will 
have an incentive to manage those hours 
better to reduce costs. 

At least three possible agency 

responses to overtime pay requirements 
can be identified. First, the agency 
might manage existing staff to reduce 
overtime hours while maintaining the 
same caseload and staffing levels. 
However, there is little evidence on 
which to predict how agencies might 
reorganize staff time to support the same 
caseload. It seems doubtful that many 
agencies can support their caseload 
without at least some overtime 
payments, but it is unclear how much 
overtime might be reduced. In addition, 
the time spent reorganizing staffing 
plans is not costless. In this scenario 
agencies will incur opportunity costs for 
managerial time in addition to overtime 
pay, even if management pay is 
unchanged. 

Second, as suggested in the City of 

New York’s amicus brief, agencies might 
choose not to allow staff to exceed 40 
work hours per week.78 After the Court 
of Appeals for the Second Circuit 
concluded in Coke that home health 
care workers were entitled to overtime 
pay, the experience of New York City 
indicates this might be a common 
response in some regions. Such an 
approach will require increased staffing 
to cover the existing caseload. The New 
York City experience suggests it became 
common for staff that worked more than 
40 hours per week at a single agency to 
continue to work more than 40 hours 

77 If the 367,000 providers in CA that currently 

receive overtime coverage under the terms of a 
collective bargaining agreement lose that coverage 
due to a change in the terms, the additional costs 
of overtime would be approximately $75 million 
under the same assumptions.

per week, but for multiple agencies.79 
For example, a home health care worker 
might work perhaps 25 hours per week 
at two different agencies, thus not 
becoming eligible for overtime pay 
despite working 50 hours per week. 
Once again, agencies will incur 
additional managerial costs as they hire 
and manage additional staff. Employees 
that begin to work for more than one 
agency will also incur opportunity costs 
as they coordinate their schedules with 
multiple agencies. Finally, agencies 
might increase staffing by hiring new 
workers; depending on the tightness of 
the labor market, this might necessitate 
increasing hourly wages to attract new 
workers. 

The third scenario comprises a mix of 

the first and second approach. Neither 
of those approaches is costless to 
agencies, therefore, agencies will weigh 
the cost of hiring additional workers 
with the cost of paying overtime to 
existing workers to determine the 
optimal mix of overtime and new hires 
appropriate to their circumstances. 
Agency caseload, current staffing 
patterns, the cost of hiring new workers, 
and managerial preferences for staffing 
mix will affect the final decision. 

One factor that may help determine 

how many employees currently 
exceeding 40 hours of work per week 
would receive overtime pay compared 
to having their hours reduced below 40 
per week is the potential for existing 
workers to absorb additional hours 
without exceeding 40 hours per week. 
Available data suggest many employees 
are working significantly less than 40 
hours per week and at least some of 
those workers are interested in working 
additional hours. As has been 
mentioned, studies show that HHAs and 
PCAs work, on average, 35 hours per 
week at most, and approximately 45 
percent of workers in HHCS work part- 
time.80 In addition, the 2010 CPS ASEC 
asked part-time workers why they did 
not work full-time; 22 percent of aides 
indicated they could only find part-time 
work and 18 percent stated they worked 
part-time due to business conditions. 
Thus potentially 40 percent of part-time 
aides might be interested in increasing 
their hours worked if more hours were 
available. 

This suggests that of 1.59 million 

PCAs and HHAs, approximately 720,000 
are part-time, and 288,000 might be 
interested in increasing their hours 
worked. Employees in this industry 
currently average at most 35 hours 
worked per week; if each of the 288,000 
part-timers that might like to work

additional hours increased their average 
hours worked by 1.8 per week, they 
could absorb the estimated 26.8 million 
hours of overtime currently worked 
without exceeding 40 hours per week 
themselves. Not all employers will be 
able to redistribute hours to interested 
part-time workers in this way, and it 
may be difficult for agencies to adjust 
worker schedules to come close to, but 
not exceed, 40 hours due to the nature 
of the work; the types of services they 
provide do not necessarily fit into one- 
hour increments. However, those 
employers who can adjust schedules 
and redistribute hours can be expected 
to decrease overtime costs significantly. 
Travel Time 

The FLSA requires that employees 

who, in the normal course of work, 
travel to more than one worksite during 
the workday be paid for travel time 
between each worksite. (If the home 
health care worker travels to the first 
client directly from home, and returns 
directly home from the final client, 
travel time for the first trip and last trip 
generally are not eligible for pay.) It is 
clear that at least some home health care 
workers travel between clients and are 
thus eligible to be paid for that time. 
However, the Department has been 
unable to find evidence concerning how 
many workers routinely travel as part of 
the job, the number of hours spent on 
travel, or what percentage of that travel 
time currently is compensated. 

New York City’s amicus brief does 

suggest, however, that projected travel 
costs would be about 19.2 percent of the 
size of overtime costs.81 With no other 
data available, this ratio seems 
reasonable to estimate potential travel 
costs. A number of qualifications apply 
to the use of this ratio. First, there is 
anecdotal evidence that agencies that 
operate in the city make little effort to 
minimize travel on the part of their 
workers; since travel is ‘‘free’’ to the 
agency, there is little incentive to 
manage travel time. Second, because 
there is no explanation of how either 
overtime or travel time estimates were 
generated, a closer examination of the 
data might change either or both 
estimates.82 Third, it is unclear how 
work and travel patterns in New York 
City apply to the rest of the country. For 
example, anecdotal evidence suggests 
that home health care workers in rural 
areas might have to travel further 
between clients, but their typical 

81 Brief of Amici Curiae City of New York, 2007. 
82 Thus, it is plausible that a modification in the 
assumptions used to generate one estimate might 
also affect the second estimate. The ratio of travel 
time to overtime might remain relatively stable even 
if the absolute values of the estimates change. 

caseload patterns and total travel time 
are unknown. A survey of 131 home 
health care workers in Maine found 
companions traveled between 0 to 438 
miles per week for an average 
unreimbursed mileage of 45 miles per 
week. One survey participant’s 
comment was compelling: ‘‘I had to give 
up my other clients because the price of 
gas and low wages I wasn’t making ends 
meet.83 

The Department expects no 

independent providers will be affected 
by the travel time provision. Although 
the FLSA requires that employees who 
travel to more than one worksite during 
the workday be paid for travel time 
between each worksite, in the case of 
independent providers, any travel 
between work sites most likely 
represents travel from one employer to 
another, not travel between sites for the 
same employer. Therefore the 
Department anticipates independent 
providers will not be eligible for travel 
costs. 

Subject to the qualifications described 

above, using New York City’s 19.2 
percent of overtime figure, the 
Department estimates that the 
requirement to pay travel time under the 
FLSA might add approximately $26.7 
million per year to home health care 
agency costs.84 Because the Department 
has assumed that travel costs will 
maintain a constant proportion to 
overtime pay (as calculated under 
Scenario 1), we project that travel pay 
will increase from $27.8 million to 
$45.8 million from year 2 through year 
10. 
Market Response to Travel Time 
Requirement 

As a result of this provision, agencies 

should have significant incentive to 
reduce travel between clients for their 
employees, and therefore costs. It is 
difficult, however, to predict the 
potential magnitude of the cost 
reduction. It might be difficult to reduce 
travel due to client preferences for 
specific caregivers, or the geographical

aide’s voices from the field: Job experiences of 
personal support specialists. The Maine home care 
worker retention study. Home Healthcare Nurse, 
July/August 2010, 28(7), 399–405. 

84 It is unknown whether travel hours will be paid 

at straight time or overtime rates; this will vary 
according to the circumstances of the individual 
worker. If we assume all travel hours are overtime 
hours, and are paid at approximately $15 per hour, 
then the $31 million in incremental travel costs 
suggests about 2.1 million hours per year are spent 
in travel. If we assume all travel hours are straight 
time hours, and are paid at approximately $10 per 
hour, then the $31 million in incremental travel 
costs suggests about 3.1 million hours per year are 
spent in travel. 

dispersion of clients (especially in rural 
areas). 

Agencies might also find alternative 

methods to reduce the travel costs it 
pays to employees without reducing 
actual travel time. For example, an 
agency might be able to reduce its 
employees’ hourly wage, but increase 
hours paid by including travel time in 
such a way that employees’ take-home 
pay is left unchanged. There are, 
however, some constraints that might 
limit agencies’ ability to utilize such a 
strategy. First, employees must earn at 
least the federal minimum wage for all 
hours worked, including travel time, 
after this policy is implemented. 
Second, agencies will expend 
managerial resources implementing 
such a policy, which may at least 
partially offset the savings from reduced 
wages. Third, management frequently 
has multiple goals, some of which might 
conflict with such a policy. If, for 
example, newer employees are paid a 
wage closer to the federal minimum, 
then their hourly wages might be 
reduced a lesser amount than more 
senior staff. This might conflict with the 
agencies’ desired pay scale, as well as 
other goals such as employee retention. 

Therefore, although the Department 
anticipates travel will be reduced as a 
result of the proposed rule, it cannot 
predict the magnitude of this reduction. 
First, there may be some minimum level 
of necessary travel that is irreducible. 
Second, although agencies have 
incentive to more carefully manage 
costs associated with employee travel, 
they might be able to do so in such a 
way that agencies avoid increased costs, 
but results in little reduction in travel 
by their employees. 
Live-in Domestic Staff 

The proposed rule would limit the 

application of the overtime exemption 
contained in § 13(b)(21) of the Act to the 
individual, family or household 
employing the live-in domestic worker. 
Third-party employers would no longer 
be entitled to claim the exemption. In 
addition, the proposed rule would 
require employers of live-in domestic 
workers to maintain an accurate record 
of hours worked, rather than simply 
keeping a copy of the agreement made 
by the employer and employee covering 
hours of work. The cost to employers of 
the proposed recordkeeping 
requirement, discussed more fully in the 
Paperwork Reduction Act section of this 
preamble, is estimated to be $22,580,605 
(which reflects the amount for the entire 
information collection-approximately 
$3,059,650 of which stems from this 
NPRM). The Department has been 
unable to identify current data to

estimate the number of live-in domestic 
workers employed by third-party 
agencies, but based on historical data, 
we do not expect the impact of the 
proposed change concerning third-party 
employment to be substantial. Although 
the Department has estimated the 
number of live-in domestics for 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction 
Act (PRA), we have not included such 
data in the economic analysis as the 
Department relied upon aged data for 
the PRA section. The Department 
utilized a 1979 study of Domestic 
Service Employees which incorporated 
1974 data and assumed for purposes of 
the PRA that a similar percentage of the 
current domestic worker population is 
employed in live-in domestic work 
today. The Department specifically 
invites comments and data on the 
number of live-in domestic workers and 
their employers who may be subject to 
this rule. 
Total Transfers 

Due to the continuum of different 

responses to the proposed regulation, 

the Department analyzed three possible 
scenarios with respect to overtime. One 
approach assumes the agency pays 
employees the overtime premium for all 
overtime hours worked. Conversely, the 
employer might change scheduling 
practices to avoid overtime costs and 
hire additional workers as necessary to 
work the extra hours. The final 
approach is modeled as a combination 
of the first two, half of employers pay 
overtime as in the first scenario and half 
of employers hire more workers, as in 
the second scenario. As described 
above, additional managerial costs to 
agencies might occur as a result of 
changes in staffing; the Department has 
no basis for estimating these costs, but 
believes they are relatively small. 
Therefore, they are not included in the 
three scenarios. 

highest to lowest amount are: 

The three scenarios in rank order from 
• OT Scenario 1: The Department 

assumes agencies make no adjustments 
to staffing and pay employees the 
overtime premium for all hours worked 
in excess of 40 per week.

Total Transfers by Scenario 

• OT Scenario 2: The Department 

assumes agencies make a partial 
adjustment to staffing; overtime pay is 
reduced, but not eliminated, by hiring 
some additional staff or increasing 
hours to part-time workers. For the 
purposes of this estimate, the 
Department assumes agencies evenly 
split the current overtime hours 
between current workers (who will thus 
work 50 percent of the overtime hours 
they currently work), and new workers 
(who will not work any overtime hours). 

• OT Scenario 3: The Department 
assumes agencies ban overtime and 
increase staffing to ensure no employee 
works more than 40 hours per week. In 
addition, it is assumed that additional 
staff can be hired at the current going 
wage rate. 

Table 3–4 presents an overview of the 

total estimated transfers of this rule 
where the scenarios represent a range of 
potential outcomes and actual transfers 
will depend on the response of 
employers to the proposed rule.

The Department examined three 

scenarios representing varying agencies’ 
potential responses to the overtime pay 
requirement. There is little hard 
evidence concerning the likelihood that 
each scenario might occur. However, the 
Department expects: Scenario 1 is the 
least likely; there is no reason to believe 
agencies will simply continue current 
staffing patterns and pay workers 
overtime for any hours exceeding 40 per 
week. Scenario 1 represents an upper 
bound estimate that projected transfer 
effects should not exceed.

Scenarios 2 and 3 are more likely to 
occur.85 Agencies have alternatives to 
paying the overtime premium: 
Spreading existing overtime hours to 
other workers, either new employees or 

85 National level quantitative analyses have 

produced results consistent with the Department’s 
qualitative analysis for this labor market:

current employees who want more 
hours. Thus, the Department believes 
the true transfer effects resulting from 
the overtime requirement: 

• Will exceed the estimate presented 
as Scenario 3; agencies are unlikely to 
be able to perfectly spread all overtime 
hours. This may result from specific 
rigidities associated with individual 
agencies: An inability to divide certain 
cases among workers so that none 
exceed 40 hours; insufficient part-time 
staff willing to take on additional hours, 
or a local labor pool with workers 
unwilling to work at the current wage 
level. Scenario 3 thus represents a lower

bound estimate below which projected 
transfers are unlikely to fall. 

The degree to which actual transfer 
effects will be greater than or less than 
Scenario 2 is uncertain. However, the 
Department expects the lower scenario 
is more likely; there are multiple 
channels through which hours can be 
spread to additional workers without 
significantly increasing non-overtime 
wages. The extent to which current 
employees work more than 40 hours per 
week provides little evidence of a 
potential labor shortage in this industry; 
because most agencies are not covered 
by overtime requirements, they have 
had no incentive to manage workers in 
a way to avoid overtime. 
Projected Future Costs and Transfer 
Effects Due to Industry Growth 

As documented above in this analysis, 

the demand for home health care 
workers has grown significantly over the 
past decade and is projected to continue 
growing rapidly. One researcher has 
projected at least a 200 percent increase 
in demand for home health care workers 
over the next 40 years.86 Therefore, the 
Department examined how the 
provisions in the proposed rule might 
impact a rapidly growing industry. 
To estimate projected regulatory 

familiarization costs, the Department 

first estimated both the number of 
agencies and the number of 
independent providers likely to enter 
the market. The Department used U.S. 
Census’ Business Dynamics Statistics to 
estimate an average annual firm ‘‘birth’’ 
rate of 8.6 percent of existing firms.87 
With 73,175 affected agencies in the 
baseline, this projects to 6,314 new 
agencies per year that will incur 
incremental regulatory familiarization 
costs. 

The projected number of families 

expected to hire independent providers 
was calculated using U.S. Census 
population projections by age. Census 
projected that the number of individuals 
age 65 and older will increase from 40.2 
million in 2010 to 50.8 million in 2020 
(36 percent), while those age 85 and 
older will increase from 5.8 million to 
6.6 million (15 percent) over the same 
time period.88 The Department selected 
the midpoint of these two age groups to 
estimate the growth rate of the 
population most likely requiring 
assistance; including all those in their 
mid 60s and early 70s was judged to be 
too inclusive and would overestimate 
the growth of the relevant population, 
while many requiring assistance might 
have died before the age of 85, and thus 
that age group would underestimate 

growth. This growth rate over 10 years 
(34 percent) was applied to the number 
of independent home care providers in 
the baseline year (206,600) to estimate 
that 285,900 independent providers 
would be supplying services by 2020, an 
average of 7,208 new workers per year 
from 2010 to 2020. 

However, this estimate does not 

account for turnover among families 
hiring independent home care 
providers; the Department accounted for 
this by assuming that 50 percent of the 
previous year’s independent home 
health care providers would gain a new 
client, and that client’s family would 
require regulatory familiarization. Thus, 
on average, regulatory familiarization 
costs among families hiring 
independent providers each year was 
calculated at 50 percent of the previous 
year’s providers plus 7,208. 

Consistent with the baseline estimate, 

new agencies projected to incur 
regulatory familiarization costs are 
assumed to require two incremental 
hours at a rate $26.79 per hour. Families 
hiring independent providers are 
assumed to require one hour of 
regulatory familiarization at a rate of 
$29.07. Table 3–5 summarizes the 
estimation of projected regulatory 
familiarization costs.

To estimate the number of 

incremental home healthcare providers 
that might earn an overtime wage 
premium or travel pay under the 
proposed revisions, the Department 
utilized BLS Occupational Outlook 
employment projections for 2018.89 The 

Department interpolated employment 
data for 2011 through 2017, and 
extrapolated the time series through 
2020 using a constant rate of growth 
assumption. Wage data were directly 
extrapolated using the time trend from 

2000 through 2010. Based on these time 
series:

Table 4–2 presents the impact of 
regulatory familiarization costs on 
existing agencies and families in the 
first year. First year regulatory 

familiarization costs total $9.9 million; 
when annualized at a 7 percent discount 
rate over 10 years, total annualized costs 
are $1.3 million per year. Cost per 

agency is $54, while families employing 
independent providers will incur costs 
of $29 per family.

and therefore do not affect their ability 
to bear regulatory familiarization costs. 
The approach to estimate regulatory 
familiarization costs to new entrants is 
discussed above in Projected Future 
Costs. 
Market Impacts 

The Department anticipates that the 
proposed rule will have relatively little 
effect on the provision of 
companionship services. There are 
almost no data, such as price elasticities 
of supply or demand, that can directly 
be used to model the market for 
companionship services. Furthermore, 
because approximately 75 percent of 
expenditures on home health services 
are reimbursed by Medicare and 
Medicaid, the effect of the rule depends 
vitally on how Medicare and Medicaid 
respond to the increase in the cost of 
providing home health services. 
However, despite these limitations, the 
Department used available data 
combined with best professional 
judgment to appropriately adjust 
parameter values, to project deadweight 
loss and disemployment effects of the 
proposed rule. 

In this section, the Department first 
presents estimated costs and transfer 
effects for each provision of the 
proposed rule, along with qualitative 
discussion of potential market 
adjustments and impacts of that 
provision. The Department then 
presents the projected deadweight loss 
and disemployment effects of the 
proposed rule using a market model 
framework. 

The Department estimates: 
• Regulatory familiarization and 
adjustments to managing travel and 
overtime are projected to cost less than 
$4 million in the first year, or about $54 
per establishment, which is perhaps 

0.005 percent of average annual 
establishment revenue. As noted 
previously in this analysis, between 8 
and 15 percent of PCAs and HHAs may 
work overtime, and employers currently 
manage these issues for other 
occupational categories. Furthermore, 
while employers of PCAs and HHAs 
who work overtime may require more 
time spent in managing travel and 
overtime, the Department believes, on 
average, there should be little impact on 
employment attributable to regulatory 
familiarization costs. 
• Minimum wage provisions total 

$13.0 million (Table 3–4), a 3.3 percent 
increase in wage for 31,000 affected 
workers employed by agencies. In 
addition, the Department estimates that 
7,500 independent providers directly 
employed by families might also receive 
a 3.3 percent wage increase attributable 
to the minimum wage provisions. If the 
price elasticity of demand for these 
workers is similar to the national 
average price elasticity of demand for all 
workers (¥0.3), 93 about 310 agency- 
employed and 74 independent 
providers might lose their positions 
because of this provision. However, 
because many of these services are paid 
by Medicare and Medicaid, demand for 
them might be less elastic than the 
overall national average; this would 
reduce the disemployment effect; this 
will be discussed in greater detail 
below. Furthermore, it is likely these 
workers will be able to find new 
positions due to the overtime pay 
provisions and because the demand for 
these workers is projected to grow by 
200 percent by 2050.94 
• Projected travel costs represent a 
transfer of $27 million per year from 
agencies to employees (Table 3–4, 
although this might decline as agencies 
will now have incentive to more closely 

93 Hamermesh, D.S., Labor Demand. Princeton, 

N.J.: Princeton University Press. 1993. 

94 HHS 2003, p. v. 

manage travel time). If these payments 
are spread equally over all agencies in 
this industry, they represent about a 
0.06 percent increase in wages to 
employees. It is more likely that these 
payments will be distributed less 
uniformly; employees of some agencies 
might receive significant travel transfer 
effects, while others receive less. 

• Transfer effects associated with 

overtime are most difficult to project. If 
Scenario 2 represents the best point 
estimate of overtime payments, then the 
$69.7 million in additional wages 
compose about 0.17 percent of annual 
wages if overtime is spread over all 
workers, or about 0.09 percent of 
average industry annual revenues if 
spread over all establishments. Again, it 
is likely that overtime payments will be 
distributed less uniformly in a way that 
is difficult to predict. 

However, changes in wages are not 

the only determinant of how the market 
might tend to respond to the proposed 
rule; the demand for home health 
services, and therefore the demand for 
workers in this industry, also affects the 
market response. Conceptually, the 
demand for companionship services 
probably has two distinct components: 
Patients covered by Medicare and 
Medicaid, and out-of-pocket payers. 
According to the Medicare Payment 
Advisory Commission (MEDPAC), 
Medicare and Medicaid accounted for 
35 and 41 percent, respectively, of total 
spending on home health in 2008.95 Of 
the remaining 24 percent, out-of-pocket 
payers (including private insurance) are 
20 percent (the remaining 4 percent is 
a mix of other governmental sources).96

81224 

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

Currently, Medicare will cover, 

without a copayment requirement, all— 
or almost all—of allowed payment rate 
for home health care services for 
patients eligible for Medicare payments. 
Thus, the demand for services by these 
patients is likely to be highly inelastic, 
and the purchase of these services is 
dependent primarily on need and 
eligibility rather than price.97 In 
addition, Medicare has historically 
determined the payment rate to 
providers of these services based in part 
on regional market prices of inputs, 
which in home health care services 
labor constitutes 77 percent of the cost 
of services.98 Because minimum wage 
and travel are unavoidable costs of 
providing these services, it seems 
reasonable to assume that these costs 
will eventually be reflected in payment 
rates. The impact of overtime pay on 
reimbursement rates is more uncertain. 
Patients that pay all, or a significant 

share, of costs out-of-pocket might have 
a significantly different price elasticity 
of demand for home health care 
services. Little information is known 
about this market segment, including 
the percent of home health care patients 
paying out-of-pocket, or the extent to 
which some have private insurance to 
cover costs. Because Medicare and 
Medicaid account for about 75 percent 
of total payments for home health care 
services, it is likely that the self-pay 
market segment is significantly smaller. 
To the extent that these patients are not 
covered by private insurance and pay 
out-of-pocket, they are likely to have a 
more elastic demand for services; if the 
prices for home health services 
increases, these patients are more likely 
to search for lower cost alternatives,

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 
(MedPAC). October 2010, available at: http:// 
www.medpac.gov/documents/ 
MedPAC_Payment_Basics_08_HHA.pdf. Medicare, 
for example, does not require copayment for eligible 
patients. 

98 Section 1895 of the Social Security Act 

required that that the home health prospective 
payment system (HH PPS) make payment for all 
costs of home health services. As such, under the 
HH PPS, Medicare covers and pays for all home 
health services, including medical supplies, that are 
reasonable and necessary, for beneficiaries that are 
eligible for the Medicare home health benefit. The 
law requires that the HH PPS rates be updated, on 
an annual basis, by the home health market basket 
update (plus or minus any percentage legislated by 
Congress). CMS uses the home health market basket 
index, which measures (and tracks) inflation in the 
prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services 
that HHAs purchase in furnishing home health care. 
Medicare cost report data are used to construct the 
cost weights for the blended wage and benefit 
index. See also Home Health Care Services Payment 
System. MedPAC. 2010.

including relying on family members to 
provide care, institutionalizing the 
patient (but see discussion of Medicare 
and Medicaid, infra, indicating that this 
may not occur), or accessing the grey 
market. However, the size of such an 
effect is difficult to predict on the basis 
of extant information. 

Because incremental transfers are 

projected to be small relative to industry 
wages and revenues, and because the 
market for these services is dominated 
by government payers, the Department 
expects the impact of the proposed rule 
on the market for home health care 
services to be relatively small. However, 
to the extent that some transfers are not 
reimbursed by government payers, and 
that agencies might therefore increase 
price to patients, they might result in 
some patients seeking alternatives to the 
organized market for home health care 
services. 
Deadweight Loss 

Deadweight loss from a regulation 

results from a wedge driven between the 
price consumers pay for a product or 
service, and the price received by the 
suppliers of those services. In this case, 
the transfer of income from agency 
owners to agency employees through 
minimum wage and overtime provisions 
reduces agencies’ willingness to provide 
companionship services at the current 
market price. Because patients and their 
families must now pay more to receive 
the same hours of service, they reduce 
the number of hours of services they 
purchase; it is this reduction in services 
that causes the allocative inefficiency 
(deadweight loss) of the rule. 

To estimate deadweight loss, the 

Department must estimate the reduction 
in services agencies are willing to 
provide at the current market price, the 
resulting increase in market price paid 
by patients and families, and their 
reduced purchases of companion 
services. To do this, the Department will 
use: (1) The current market wage and 
hours purchased of companion services; 
(2) the estimated regulatory costs and 
income transfers resulting from the rule; 
and (3) the price elasticity of demand 
for and supply of companion services. 
As described above, the Department 
has estimated approximately 353,000 
HHAs and 423,000 PCAs work in states 
without current overtime and/or 
minimum wage provisions or are 
directly employed by the home; of 
these, 339,000 HHAs and 399,000 PCAs 
are employed in agencies and are 
potentially affected by the overtime 
provisions of the proposed rule. These 
caregivers each provide about 35 hours 
per week of companion services in the 
home. The average hourly wage in these 

states is $9.85 for HHAs and $9.45 for 
PCAs. The Department used the number 
of employees affected by overtime 
provisions in its calculation of 
deadweight loss because: (1) The 
populations of affected workers in states 
without minimum wage and overtime 
provisions are largely overlapping and 
thus create potential double-counting; 
(2) under Scenario 2, overtime 
premiums are four times larger than 
projected minimum wage payments, 
and (3) spreading costs and transfers 
over a smaller worker population results 
in a more conservative estimate of 
deadweight loss (that is, the Department 
is more likely to overestimate, than 
underestimate deadweight loss). 

The Department estimated a range of 

regulatory costs and income transfers 
depending on the assumptions made 
concerning business response to the 
regulation. As discussed above, the most 
probable of the three scenarios 
considered (Scenario 2) assumes an 
equal split of overtime costs between 
agencies, who pay at least some limited 
amount of overtime, and caregivers, 
who reduce hours worked at that agency 
(although they might seek additional 
hours to work at other agencies). 
Combining projected costs under 
Scenario 2, with the amounts due based 
upon the minimum wage and travel pay 
provisions, the Department estimated 
the deadweight loss of the rule based on 
first year compliance costs of $122.4 
million. Thus, the rule might cost $166 
per potentially affected worker, or 
approximately $0.0912 per hour 
assuming workers average 35 hours per 
week, about 0.93 percent of current 
hourly wage for HHAs and 0.96 percent 
for PCAs. 

There are no econometric estimates of 
the price elasticity of demand or supply 
for companionship services. The price 
elasticity of demand for labor services 
has been estimated as ¥0.3 (a 1 percent 
increase in wages will cause a 0.3 
percent reduction in hours purchased). 
However, it is reasonable to expect that 
the demand for companionship services 
is less elastic than the demand for 
general labor services because much of 
the cost is paid by Medicare and 
Medicaid. As a result, patients and 
family members are largely cushioned 
from the direct effects of changes in 
price for these services and are thus less 
likely to change their demand for them. 
Therefore, the Department assumes the 
demand for home companionship 
services is one-half the price elasticity 
of demand for general labor services, or 
¥0.15. 

The price elasticity of supply for 

hourly labor has been estimated at 0.1 
(a 1 percent increase in wages will cause

81225 

a 0.1 percent increase in hours 
supplied). However, among married 
women, that price elasticity of supply is 
estimated to be about 0.14; because 
hours worked in this labor market are 
primarily supplied by married women, 
the Department selected a value of 0.14 
to use as the price elasticity of supply 
of home healthcare services in this 
analysis. 

Based on these price elasticities of 

supply and demand, the estimated cost 
per caregiver hour, and baseline 
employment and wages, the Department 
projects that for: 

• HHAs, hourly wage will increase by 

$0.044 to $9.89, and employment will 
decrease by about 227, or about 413,000 
hours of companionship services 

annually; deadweight loss will be 
$18,800 annually. 

• PCAs, hourly wage will increase by 

$0.044 to $9.50, and employment will 
decrease by 278, or about 507,000 hours 
of companionship services annually; 
deadweight loss will be $23,100 
annually. 

In addition, transfers to home 

caregivers will be borne by the patients 
and their families in the form of higher 
prices, and by agencies and their owners 
in the form of reduced income. The 
determination of who pays these 
transfers is a function of the relative 
price elasticities of supply and demand; 
with inelastic demand and labor supply, 
these transfers are approximately 
equally shared between purchasers 
(about 48.3 percent borne by patients, 

their families, and Medicare and 
Medicaid) and agencies (about 51.7 
percent). For: 

• HHAs, about $27.1 million is 

estimated to be paid by patients, their 
families, and Medicare and Medicaid; 
while $29.1 million is estimated to be 
paid by agencies and their owners in the 
form of reduced income. 

• PCAs, patients, their families, and 
Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to 
pay about $31.9 million, and $34.2 
million is estimated to be paid by 
agencies and their owners in the form of 
reduced income.

$251 billion.99 Under Medicare, an 
estimated $18.3 billion went to home 
health programs, while Medicaid 
programs accounted for approximately 
another $38.1 billion (approximately 
$40 billion inflated to 2009 dollars) 
through various programs.100 In 2008, 
Medicare and Medicaid accounted for 
nearly 75 percent of home health care

services revenue; thus, the impact of the 
proposed rule on home health care will 
depend vitally on how Medicare and 
Medicaid respond to increased labor 
costs. 

Although increased payments to 
workers associated with minimum 
wage, travel, and overtime provisions of 
the proposed rule are considered 
transfer effects from a societal 
perspective, the Department expects 
agencies will try to pass these transfers 
through to Medicare and Medicaid. 
Under the three overtime scenarios 
examined, average annualized payments 
range from $41.5 to $226.0 million 
depending on how home health care 

agencies respond to overtime 
requirements. If Medicare and Medicaid 
continue to pay 75 percent of home 
health care costs, roughly $31.1 million 
to $169.5 million in costs might be 
incurred by these government programs. 
These costs compose 0.06 to 0.29 
percent of total HHS and state outlays 
for home health care programs ($58.1 
billion). 

We invite comment on the impact of 
the rule of on Medicaid, Medicare, and 
the private market, including the impact 
on the affordability of home health and 
home and community-based services.

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

Projected Future Transfer Effects Due to 
Industry Growth 

This section projects costs, and 

impacts over 10 years. The Department 
used several key assumptions to 
develop these projections. First, the 
Department assumed that the number of 
home healthcare workers directly 
employed in the homes or employed in 
states without current overtime 
premium requirements will remain a 
constant percentage of total employment 
in those occupations between 2010 and 
2020 (about 35.5 percent of HHAs and 
63.3 percent of HHAs). 

Second, we also maintained the 

assumptions that 12 percent of workers 
exceed 40 hours worked per week and 
that 10 percent of these caregivers work 
45 hours per week while 2 percent work 
12.5 hours of overtime per week. These 
overtime assumptions are identical to 
those used to estimate costs and 
transfers for 2009, while the percentages 

used to estimate the number of workers 
potentially affected in each year were 
calculated from the 2009 analysis. 
Third, consistent with the 2009 

analysis, we project two three overtime 
scenarios: And one for travel costs: 
• Scenario 1: Employers make no 

adjustment to hours worked and pay all 
workers the overtime premium for all 
hours worked in excess of 40 per week. 

• Scenario 2: Employers adjust 
schedules and/or hire additional 
workers to reduce overtime payment; 
we assume 50 percent of overtime 
payments can be avoided through these 
market adjustments. 

• Scenario 3: Employers adjust 
schedules and/or hire additional 
workers to eliminate overtime 
payments. 

Finally, we continue to estimate travel 
costs 19.2 percent of Overtime Scenario 
1 costs. 

The Department excluded potential 

transfer effects associated with the 

minimum wage provision from the 
projections because the current number 
of workers earning less than the 
minimum wage is relatively small and 
will decline steadily as nominal wages 
increase. Although the Department 
expects that the parameters used in this 
analysis will not remain constant, it has 
no information on which to base 
estimates of how these key variables 
might change over time. Therefore, 
maintaining the assumptions used in 
the analysis for 2009 provide the best 
basis for projecting future costs and 
transfer effects. 

Based on the data and assumptions 

described in this section, and the 
employment and wage projections in 
Table 3–6, Table 4–4 presents the 
Department’s projections through 2020 
of overtime and travel payments 
attributable to the revisions to the 
companionship regulations FLSA 
proposed in this notice.

[a] Calculations based on employment and wage data in Table 3–6 and specified assumptions. 
[b] Under Scenario 3, no overtime payments are incurred. 
[c] Because overtime payments under Scenario 3 are zero, total payments under Scenario 3 are identical to travel payments. Total payments 

under Scenarios 1 and 2 are equal to overtime payments under that scenario plus travel payments. 

The Department projects that paid 

overtime hours will increase from 30.5 
million to 53.1 million between 2010 
and 2020 with a consequent increase in 
overtime pay from $147.1 million to 

$309.9 million assuming employers 
make no adjustment to overtime work 
patterns (Scenario 1). In inflation- 
adjusted dollars, overtime pay is 
projected to increase from $144.8 

million to $261.9 million. Assuming 
employers are able to cover 50 percent 
of overtime hours through scheduling 
changes and/or hiring additional 
workers (Scenario 2), the projected

increase is half that of Scenario 1. 
Travel pay is projected to increase from 
$28.2 million to $59.5 million in 
nominal dollars ($27.8 million to $50.3 
million in inflation-adjusted dollars) 
over that same period. 

To place these projected future 
transfer effects resulting from the 
proposed rule in context, the 
Department compared nominal transfer 
effects to projected Medicare spending 
over the same period. The Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services report 
that in 2010 Medicare expenditures 
totaled $522.8 billion, $19.1 billion of 
which was spent on the provision of 
home health care services, and that 
annual Medicare expenditures are 
projected to increase to $932.1 billion 
by 2020.101 Assuming that expenditures 
of home health services as a percent of 
total Medicare expenditures remains 

constant, annual home health care 
expenditures might increase to $34.1 
billion by 2020.102 

However, the total overtime and travel 

payments projected to result from the 
proposed rule will not paid by 
Medicare. On average, about 51.7 
percent of projected costs and transfer 
effects are expected to be paid by 
providers in the form of lower profits 
(see discussion of deadweight loss for 
details). Further, only about 75 percent 
of payments for home health care 
services are attributable to Medicare and 
Medicaid; patients and their families 
and their private insurance account for 
20 percent of payments. About 5 percent 
is accounted for by a mix of other 
governmental programs. 

After adjusting projected overtime 

and travel transfer effects, the 
Department expects incremental 
Medicare payments attributable to the 

rule will increase from about $59.8 
million in 2010 to $133.8 million in 
2020 under Scenario 1, and from $34.7 
million to $77.6 million under the more 
probable Scenario 2, and from $9.6 
million to $21.5 million under Scenario 
3 (as discussed above, the Department 
expects the market response to the rule 
will most likely lie somewhere between 
Scenario 2 and Scenario 3). These 
incremental payments compose no more 
than 0.4 percent of projected Medicare 
Home Health Care expenditures under 
Scenario 1, and 0.23 percent of those 
expenditures under Scenario 2, and 0.06 
percent under Scenario 3. Table 4–5 
summarizes projected Medicare 
budgets, incremental payments 
attributable to the proposed rule, and 
those payments as a percent of Medicare 
Home Health Care expenditures from 
2010 through 2020.

Total average annualized regulatory 

familiarization costs, and minimum 
wage, overtime premium, and travel 
payments range from $41.5 million to 
$226.0 million per year based on how 
employers adjust to the requirement to 
pay overtime wage premiums. These 
costs and transfers are projected to 
cause average annualized deadweight 
loss ranging from $3,000 to $105,000 per 
year. These costs and transfers are also 
projected to cause disemployment 
impacts ranging from 172 to 938 
workers per year. 
Non-monetized Projected Impact 

Two additional aspects of home 

health care services might be affected by 
the proposed rule. First, the proposed 
rule might result in increased purchases 
of home health care services through the 
informal, or ‘‘grey,’’ market. Second, 
although the hours of care received by 
patients might be unaffected by the 
increased costs of care, the quality of 
that care might suffer (however, the 
quality of care also may increase due to 
increased professionalism and 
decreased turnover). These are 
discussed in turn below. 

The Grey Market 

An unknown number of patients 
receive home care services through 
more informal arrangements with care 
providers, sometimes called the ‘‘grey’’ 
market. Here, informal agreements are 
reached between the patient (or 
patient’s family) and the caregiver 
regarding hours of care and hourly pay 
rates. Because income and payroll taxes 
can be avoided, services can be 
provided at lower cost than when 
provided through agencies. 

The proposed rule will increase costs 
to home health care agencies that offer 
services in states where they are not 
required to pay the minimum wage and/ 
or overtime pay and an unknown 
percentage of those costs might be 
reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid. 
If the costs are not fully reimbursed, 
home health care agencies might 
increase the rates they charge patients, 
have their profit margin squeezed, or 
both. If costs are passed through to 
patients and their families, they will 
have incentive to look for lower cost 
alternatives such as the grey market. In 
addition, workers who desire to work 
more than 40 hours per week might 
have opportunities to provide services 
through the grey market rather than 
work for multiple agencies. Although 

the proposed rule might increase 
incentives on both sides to use the grey 
market, there is no information available 
to project potential changes to that 
market. 
Continuity of Care 

Continuity of care ‘‘is commonly 

framed as being composed of provider 
continuity (a relationship between a 
patient and provider over time), 
information continuity (availability and 
use of data from prior events during 
current client encounters) and 
management continuity (coherent 
delivery of care from different 
doctors).’’ 103 In the home care scenario, 
concerns have been raised that 
continuity of care, specifically provider 
continuity, may suffer if employers opt 
not to pay overtime for aides who, for 
example, work more than 40 hours per 
week for a single client and instead 
employ other aides to also provide 
companionship to that client in the 
same workweek. Some are concerned 
that a break in the continuity of care

may result in a reduction in the quality 
of care. 

The Department understands that 
home health care involves more than 
the provision of impersonal services; 
when a caregiver spends significant 
time with a client in the client’s home, 
the personal relationship between 
caregiver and patient can be very 
important. Certain clients may prefer to 
have the same caregiver(s), rather than 
a sequence of different caregivers. The 
extent to which home health care 
agencies choose to spread employment 
(hire more companions) rather than pay 
overtime may cause an increase in the 
number of caregivers for a client; the 
client may be less satisfied with that 
care, and communication between 
caregivers might suffer, affecting the 
quality of care for the client.104 
Although matching client and 
caregiver in a long-term personal 
relationship is the ideal for many 
clients, it may not be the norm. For 
instance, the turnover rate (those 
leaving and entering home care work) 
for workers in the home health care 
industry has been estimated to range 
from 44 to 65 percent per year.105 Other 
studies have found turnover rates to be 
much higher, up to 95 percent 106 and, 
in some cases, 100 percent annually.107 
Thus, many clients already experience a 
sequence of different caregivers, and it 
is not apparent that the proposed rule 
will necessarily worsen the turnover 
rate. In fact, coverage under the FLSA 
may reduce turnover rates. Frequent 
turnover is costly for employers in terms 
of recruitment costs and training of new 
aides and also in terms of the likelihood 
of a reduction of quality care or not 
being able to provide care at all. The 
employee turnover rate in this industry 
is high because of low wages, poor or 
nonexistent benefits, and erratic and 
unpredictable hours. Job satisfaction, 
and the desire to remain in a given 
position, is highly correlated with 
wages, workload, and working 
conditions. Increased pay for the same 
amount of work and overtime 
compensation likely would aid in 
employee retention and attracting new 
hires. Those employers who choose not 
to pay overtime essentially would need 
to spread the hours among their 

employees, resulting in more consistent 
work hours for many aides. Moreover, 
any extra wages earned may be used to 
pay for other benefits, such as health 
insurance coverage. As one study found, 
for this low-income workforce, 
‘‘compensation accounts for more actual 
job turnover. [Therefore, h]igher wages, 
more hours, and travel cost 
reimbursement are found to be 
significantly associated with reduced 
turnover.’’ 108 Another report 
determined that ‘‘increases in the 
federal or state minimum wage can 
make home care employment more 
desirable.’’ 109 

For the estimated 8 to 15 percent of 

aides who work more than 40 hours per 
week, only a portion of that percentage 
likely provides services for the same 
client. Many who work overtime accrue 
long hours in the service of at least a few 
clients, traveling between client homes 
during the workweek. It is also 
conceivable that in a minority of cases, 
the aide provides companionship 
services around the clock for a stretch 
of a few or several days. Most, however, 
have been estimated to work 45 hours 
per week on average, not including 
travel time between client homes. 

Provider continuity that results in 

overtime work, however, has 
drawbacks. From the aide’s perspective, 
the long work hours can be a burden. 
For instance, ‘‘it cannot be denied shifts 
beyond the traditional 8 hours have 
been associated with increased risk of 
errors, incidents, and accidents.’’ 110 
Many studies have shown that extended 
work hours result in increased fatigue, 
decreased alertness and decreased 
productivity, negatively affecting 
employee health and well-being. Long 
work hours in the healthcare field ‘‘have 
adverse effects on patient outcomes and 
increase health care errors and patient 
injuries.’’ 111 For example, nurses 
working more than 8 hours report more 
medication errors, falling asleep at 
work, a decrease in productivity, and 
impaired critical thinking abilities. The 
error rates double when nurses work 
12.5 or more consecutive hours. A 2004 
National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health report found that ‘‘12- 
hour shifts combined with more than 40 
hours of work per week reported

increases in health complaints, 
deterioration in performance, or slower 
pace of work.’’ 112 One study that 
analyzed 13 years worth of data and 
nearly 100,000 job records notes that 
‘‘long working hours indirectly 
precipitate workplace accidents through 
a causal process, for instance, by 
inducing fatigue or stress in affected 
workers.’’ 113 It is therefore telling that 
‘‘[d]irect care workers have the highest 
injury rate in the United States, 
primarily due to work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders.’’ 114 One of 
the purposes of the FLSA’s overtime pay 
requirement is to induce employers to 
hire more people to work fewer hours 
each. Doing so in those circumstances 
where excessive overtime hours are 
worked may therefore result in better 
care provided. 

Many regard having the same home 

care aide for long hours as a cornerstone 
of ‘‘continuity of care’’ and having more 
aides to cover the same number of 
companion hours for a client as 
negatively impacting quality of care. As 
discussed above, however, the opposite 
may be true. Working extended hours 
may affect the quality of care that the 
aide is able to provide and even the 
aide’s own health and well-being. 
Coverage for companions under wage 
and hour laws may also result in 
improved retention and hiring, which 
saves the employer costs related to 
turnover rates; job satisfaction; and 
increase in pay. Attendant benefits of 
spreading work hours more evenly may 
include job stability for companions, 
decreased risk of fatigue, errors and 
work-related injuries, and better overall 
job performance, resulting in improved 
client care and outcomes. 

Furthermore, it has been shown that 

paying employees below minimum 
wages, not paying for all hours worked 
or overtime, and providing no training 
or benefits is not the only path to 
success that an employer has in the 
home care industry. Another business 
model, in which employees receive 
training, an overtime wage differential, 
and health care benefits, has been

successful. Cooperative Home Care 
Associates (CHCA), based in New York, 
for example, has always paid workers 
overtime. Although overtime at CHCA is 
carefully managed, it can still be 
substantial (e.g., 30 percent or more of 
employees exceed 40 work hours per 
week); allowing, even expecting 
overtime, permits CHCA, however, to 
use a staffing plan that maintains 
continuity of care. These policies have 
driven CHCA’s turnover rate far below 
the industry average, a major factor in 
its financial success.115 In terms of 
employee coverage, CHCA cases 
requiring weekday and weekend 
coverage are assigned permanent aides 
who work on alternate weekends. Also, 
cases requiring 24-hour coverage, seven 
days per week, are shared among four 
aides, requiring only some overtime 
hours.116 Other agencies such as 
Community Care Systems, Inc., in 
Springfield, Illinois, have reduced 
overtime costs by distributing extra 
hours more evenly among workers 
through better tracking of work hours. 
Close monitoring of employee 
workloads and spreading of work hours 
also curbed overtime use for Illinois- 
based Addus HealthCare, one of the 
nation’s largest home care employers. 
These employers pay overtime even in 
those states that do not require it, 
demonstrating that ‘‘wage and hour 
protections are economically realistic 
for the industry, and can be achieved 
without excessive use of costly overtime 
hours.’’ 117 These examples suggest that 
requiring overtime pay in this industry 
does not inevitably cause disruption of 
employer-employee relationships and 
caregiver-patient relationships leading 
to higher turnover, discontinuity of 
patient care, and increased use of the 
grey market. 
Benefits 

This section describes the expected 
benefits of the proposed change to the 
companionship exemption. Potential 
benefits of this revision to the 
‘‘companionship services exemption’’ 
flow from the transfer of regular and 
overtime wages to workers from their 
employers, and include: Reduced 
worker turnover, reduced worker injury 
rates, and decreased worker reliance on 
public assistance programs. 
Transfer Effects 

Perhaps the most significant effect of 

the proposed rule is the transfer of 
income from businesses and their 
owners to workers, and potentially,

from one group of workers to another 
group of workers. In economics, a 
transfer payment is broadly defined as 
a redistribution of income in the market 
system that does not affect output. 
Transfer Effects Associated With 
Minimum Wage and Travel Provisions 

The proposed rule leads to an 

unambiguous transfer from employers to 
employees in those states that currently 
do not require agencies to pay minimum 
wage to employees who provide this 
type of home health care services. 
Similarly, payment for travel time is 
also an unambiguous transfer of income 
from businesses and their owners to 
workers. These are estimated to be 
approximately $39.7 million. In 
addition, the $3.1 million in minimum 
wage payments to independent 
providers directly employed by families 
represent an unambiguous transfer from 
families to caregivers. 

Two factors could change the 

dynamics of this transfer scenario. First, 
increased wages and travel cost might 
be passed through to patients in the 
form of higher prices for home health 
care services. If those higher prices 
result in patients finding alternatives to 
home health care services (e.g., 
accessing the grey market for services or 
institutionalizing the patient), then the 
income transfer through travel and 
overtime pay is partially offset because 
the provision of home health services is 
reduced, resulting in reduced revenues 
to agencies, and the deadweight loss to 
the economy. This reduction in demand 
by households will be less pronounced 
if the demand for home health care 
services is inelastic (i.e., the hours of 
home health care services purchased 
does not change when price increases), 
as assumed in this analysis. The 
Department believes the market 
response to the proposed rule will be 
relatively small, but did not estimate the 
response due to lack of information. 

Second, the Department expects that 

over time some of these costs may be 
reimbursed to agencies through 
increased Medicare and Medicaid 
payments. To the extent that Medicare 
and Medicaid increase reimbursement 
rates to cover these costs, the transfer is 
from the federal and state agencies to 
workers. 
Transfer Effects Associated With 
Overtime Provisions 

The transfer of income associated 

with the payment of the overtime 
differential is more ambiguous. 
Employers are likely to respond to 
overtime pay requirements along a 
spectrum ranging from (1) banning all 
overtime and spreading hours to other 

workers or hiring new workers to fill the 
available hours, to (2) maintaining 
current staffing patterns and paying 
overtime for all work hours exceeding 
40 per week. To the extent that 
employers choose to pay overtime, the 
income transfer is from businesses and 
their owners to workers. However, to 
the extent that employers eliminate 
overtime and spread the now available 
hours to other employees or new hires, 
the transfer is from worker to worker. 
Employees who used to exceed 40 hours 
of work per week will work fewer hours, 
transferring income to fellow workers 
who will absorb the extra hours. It is 
also possible that those employees 
working greater than forty hours may 
distribute those hours among multiple 
employers. 
Potential Macroeconomic Impacts of 
Transfer Effects 

In the first year, the proposed rule is 

expected to transfer $42.8 million in 
income from businesses and families to 
home health care workers due to 
minimum wage and travel time pay 
requirements. Up to $139.3 million 
more might be transferred in the first 
year to workers due to the overtime 
provisions, although the total amount 
transferred, and the percent transferred 
from owners versus other workers 
depends on how owners modify staffing 
plans in response to the rule. 

Because employees in this industry 

earn on average hourly wages of 
approximately $10.14, it is reasonable to 
assume that a high percentage of the 
extra income would be spent by the 
employees and their families. The 
percent spent of each additional dollar 
earned is the marginal propensity to 
consume (MPC) out of income. It is also 
reasonable to assume that the MPC for 
these employees is higher than the MPC 
of their employers; for example, 
employees might spend $0.90 of each 
additional dollar earned, while their 
employers, with significantly higher 
incomes, might spend only $0.50 of 
each additional dollar earned. Thus, the 
transfer of income from employers to 
employees is likely to result in 
increased aggregate consumption 
because of employees’ higher MPC. 

The additional consumption might 

stimulate the economy an amount that 
exceeds the initial expenditure through 
the multiplier effect (e.g., the increased 
purchases by home health care workers 
generate additional income for those 
businesses, whose owners then increase 
their own spending). Moody’s 
Economy.com model suggests the 
multiplier effect for low-income 
consumers ranges from 1.64 for income 
associated with food stamps to 1.73 for

income from unemployment benefits.118 
Thus, $1 of food stamps given to low 
income consumers increases GDP by 
$1.64 dollars. 

The key unknowns in estimating any 

multiplier effect associated with the 
proposed rule include: 

• Estimating income transfers strictly 
from employers to employees, excluding 
transfers from one group of employees 
to another group of similar employees. 
• The difference between the MPC of 

employers and employees; the 
Department was unable to find 
estimates of MPC by annual income. 
• The size of the multiplier. 
The Department did not estimate the 
multiplier effect due to the uncertainty 
associated with key variables and 
parameters for the calculation. 
Reduction in Employee Turnover Rates 

Researchers have found that lower 

wages are associated with higher 
turnover and lower quality of care, and 
that increases in wages for home health 
care workers result in decreased 
turnover rates. Excessive employee 
turnover is costly to businesses, and as 
mentioned earlier, studies have found 
turnover rates in the home health care 
industry range from 44 to 95 percent per 
year, and even approach 100 percent per 
year.119 

Frequent turnover is costly for 

employers in terms of recruitment costs 
and training of new aides and also in 
terms of the likelihood of a reduction in 
the quality of care or not being able to 
provide care at all. The employee 
turnover rate in this industry is high 
because of low wages, poor or 
nonexistent benefits, and erratic and 
unpredictable hours. Job satisfaction, 
and the desire to remain in a given 
position, is highly correlated with 
wages, workload, and working 
conditions. Increased pay for the same 
amount of work and overtime 
compensation likely would aid in 
employee retention and attracting new 
hires. Those employers who choose not 
to pay overtime essentially would need 
to spread the hours among their 
employees, resulting in more consistent 
work hours for many aides. 

Decreasing the rate of employee 

turnover may result in significant cost 
savings to employers. For example, an 
agency employing 50 workers with a 
turnover rate of 35 percent replaces 
about 18 workers per year. The new 
workers hired to replace the workers

who left must be recruited, interviewed 
and trained to perform the job tasks, 
requiring a significant investment of 
time and resources by the employer. If 
the turnover rate decreases by 10 
percent to 25 percent per year, then only 
about 13 workers would be replaced 
annually. 
Reduction in Worker Injuries and 
Illnesses 

Many studies have shown that 

extended work hours result in increased 
fatigue, decreased alertness, and 
decreased productivity, negatively 
affecting employee health and well- 
being. A 2004 National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health report 
found that ‘‘12-hour shifts combined 
with more than 40 hours of work per 
week reported increases in health 
complaints, deterioration in 
performance, or slower pace of 
work.’’ 120 One study that analyzed 13 
years worth of data and nearly 100,000 
job records notes that ‘‘long working 
hours indirectly precipitate workplace 
accidents through a causal process, for 
instance, by inducing fatigue or stress in 
affected workers.’’ 121 It is therefore 
telling that ‘‘[d]irect care workers have 
the highest injury rate in the United 
States, primarily due to work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders.’’ 122 The rate 
of days away from work (work days 
missed due to on-the-job injuries) for 
nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants 
was almost four times greater than the 
all-worker rate—449 per 10,000 
compared to 113 per 10,000 for all 
workers.123 One of the results of the 
FLSA’s overtime pay requirement is to 
induce employers to hire more people to 
work fewer hours each. Doing so in 
those circumstances where excessive 
overtime hours are worked may 
therefore result in fewer injuries and 
illnesses incurred. 
Reduced Reliance on Public Assistance 

An increase in wages might reduce 
home care worker reliance on public 
assistance programs to meet the needs of 
their own households. Recent research 
finds that approximately 40 percent of 
home health care workers receive public 
assistance.124 Almost 90 percent of 
these workers are women.125

124 PHI 2010a, p. 36 
125 PHI 2010a, p. 26 

Assuming these workers are in a 

family consisting of themselves and two 
children, the average amount of public 
assistance for such families is about 
$10,300.126 In addition, many minimum 
wage workers also receive food stamps. 
The federally-assisted Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, 
previously referred to as the Food 
Stamp Program) provided aid to 33.5 
million participants in 2009 with total 
expenditures of $50.4 billion, an average 
of $1,500 in food stamps expenditures 
per participant.127 This would entail 
$4,500 per family for an assumed family 
of three. In total, the average home 
health services worker might receive 
$14,800 in public assistance and food 
stamps to provide for her/his family. 

Increased wages should reduce 

demand for public assistance services 
resulting in a savings to these programs; 
however, the Department is unable to 
quantify the savings due to lack of data 
on how the benefits of these programs 
vary with income. The savings 
associated with the minimum wage 
provisions under the proposed rule 
might be small; the Department 
estimated that the average below- 
minimum wage worker would receive a 
raise of $0.23 per hour to reach 
minimum wage. If such employees work 
the average 35 hours per week for 52 
weeks per year, their additional income 
will be about $400 per year. To the 
extent that the employees’ work requires 
significant travel time and overtime, or 
added hours of work due to employer 
schedule adjustments, they will also 
receive additional income. The 
Department did not estimate this 
portion of the potential economic 
impact due to uncertainty about the 
number of workers who would receive 
payment for travel time or additional 
hours of work. 
Improved Quality of Care 

As has been stated previously, one of 
the main benefits of this proposed rule 
is that the professionals who are 
entrusted to care for the elderly, 
disabled, and sick in their homes will 
have the same protections in the labor 
market as almost all other employees. 
Guaranteed minimum wage and 
overtime pay for home care jobs, 
comparable to similar occupations, will 
also more likely attract more qualified 
workers to the home care industry, 
which will improve the quality of care 
overall. The increased availability of 
home care workers will allow employers

to not only meet significant demand for 
home care services, but also spread 
employment, so that (1) workers are 
working fewer overtime hours which 
will result in less fatigue and more 
energy devoted to their clients; and (2) 
more workers will be serving fewer 
clients, which is a desire of many 
customers seeking home care. In 
addition, with the standard of pay 
raised, more highly trained and certified 
workers will seek out and remain in the 
HHA and PHA occupations, and a 
higher quality service will be provided 
to the client. While a monetary value 
cannot be placed on increased 
professionalism and improved care, 
those expected benefits are noteworthy. 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 

(RFA) as amended by the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), 
hereafter jointly referred to as the RFA, 
requires agencies to prepare regulatory 
flexibility analyses and make them 
available for public comment, when 
proposing regulations that will have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. See 
5 U.S.C. 603. If the rule is not expected 
to have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities, the RFA allows an agency to 
certify such, in lieu of preparing an 
analysis. See 5 U.S.C. 605. 

For the reasons explained in this 

section, the Department believes this 
NPRM is not likely to have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities, and therefore 
an initial regulatory flexibility analysis 
is not required by the RFA. However, in 
the interest of transparency and to 
provide an opportunity for the public to 
comment, the Department has prepared 
the following initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis to assess the impact 
of this regulation on small entities. The 
Department specifically invites 
comment on the impacts of the 
proposed rule on small businesses, 
including whether alternatives exist that 
will reduce burden on small entities 
while still meeting the objectives of the 
FLSA. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy 
of the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) was notified of a draft of this rule 
upon submission of the rule to the 
Office of Management and Budget under 
E.O. 12866, as amended, ‘‘Regulatory 
Planning and Review’’ 58 FR 51735, 67

1. Reasons Why Action by the Agency 
Is Being Considered 

The home care industry has 

undergone a dramatic transformation 

since the Department published the 
implementing regulations in 1975. 
There has been a growing demand for 
long-term in-home care for persons of 
all ages, in part because of the rising 
cost of traditional institutional care, and 
because of the availability of funding 
assistance for in-home care under 
Medicare and Medicaid. The growing 
demand for long-term in-home care for 
persons is also partly due to the 
significant increase in our aging 
population.128 

In response to the growing demand 
for long-term in-home care, the home 
health care services industry has grown. 
According to the National Association 
of Home Care (NAHC) publication, 
Basic Statistics About Home Care 
(March 2000), data from the Department 
of Health and Human Services’ Health 
Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 
showed that the number of Medicare- 
certified home care agencies increased 
from 2,242 in 1975 to 7,747 in 1999. In 
the NAHC 2008 update, this number 
increased to 9,284 by the end of 2007. 
The number of for-profit agencies not 
associated with a hospital, rehabilitation 
facility, or skilled nursing facility, i.e., 
freestanding agencies, increased more 
than any other category of agency from 
47 in 1975 to 4,919 in 2006. These for- 
profit agencies grew from 2 percent of 
total Medicare-certified agencies in 1975 
to 68 percent by 2006, and now 
represent the greatest percentage of 
certified agencies. Public health 
agencies, which constituted over one- 
half of the certified agencies in 1975, 
now represent only 15 percent. 

Public funds pay the overwhelming 

majority of the cost for providing home 
care services. Medicaid payments 
represent nearly 40 percent of the 
industry’s total revenues; other payment 
sources include Medicare, insurance 
plans, and direct pay. Based on data 
from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of the 
Actuary, National Health Care 
Expenditures Historical and Projections: 
1965–2016, Medicare and Medicaid 
together paid over one-half of the funds 
to freestanding agencies (37 and 19 
percent, respectively). State and local 
governments account for 20 percent, 
while private health insurance accounts 
for 12 percent. Out-of-pocket funds 
account for 10 percent of agency 
revenues. 

There has been a similar increase in 
the employment of home health aides 
and personal care aides in the private 
homes of individuals in need of 

128 See Shrestha, Laura, The Changing 

Demographic Profile of the United States, 
Congressional Research Service p. 13–14 (2006). 

assistance with basic daily living or 
health maintenance activities. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics’ (BLS) national 
occupational employment and wage 
estimates from the Occupational 
Employment Statistics (OES) survey 
show that the number of workers in 
these jobs tripled during the decade 
between 1988 and 1998, and by 1998 
there were 430,440 workers employed 
as home health aides and 255,960 
workers employed as personal care 
aides. The combined occupations of 
personal care and home health aides 
constitute a rapidly growing 
occupational group. BLS statistics 
demonstrate that between 1998 and 
2008, this occupational group has more 
than doubled with home health aides 
increasing to 955,220 and personal care 
aides increasing to 630,740. (http:// 
www.bls.gov/oes/current/ 
oes399021.htm). 

The growth in demand for in-home 

care and in the home health care 
services industry has not resulted in 
growth in earnings for workers 
providing in-home care. The earnings of 
employees in the home health aide and 
personal care aide categories remain 
among the lowest in the service 
industry. Studies have shown that the 
low income of direct care workers 
including home care workers continues 
to impede efforts to improve both jobs 
and care.129 Protecting domestic service 
workers under the Act is an important 
step in ensuring that the home health 
care industry attracts and retains 
qualified workers that the sector will 
need in the future. Moreover, the 
workers that are employed by home care 
staffing agencies are not the workers 
that Congress envisioned when it 
enacted the companionship exemption 
i.e., neighbors performing elder sitting, 
but are instead professional caregivers 
entitled to FLSA protection. In view of 
the dramatic changes in the home health 
care sector in the 36 years since these 
regulations were first promulgated and 
the growing concern about the proper 
application of the FLSA minimum wage 
and overtime protections to domestic 
service employees, the Department 
believes it is appropriate to reconsider 
whether the scope of the regulations are 
now too broad and not in harmony with 
Congressional intent. 
2. Statement of Objectives and Legal 
Basis for the Proposed Rule 

Section 13(a)(15) of the FLSA exempts 

from its minimum wage and overtime

and Intent to Leave Among Direct Care Workers:

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

81233 

pay provisions domestic service 
employees employed ‘‘to provide 
companionship services for individuals 
who (because of age or infirmity) are 
unable to care for themselves (as such 
terms are defined and delimited by 
regulations of the Secretary).’’ Due to 
significant changes in the home health 
care industry over the last 36 years, 
workers who today provide in-home 
care to individuals are performing 
duties and working in circumstances 
that were not envisioned when the 
companionship services regulations 
were promulgated. Section 13(b)(21) 
provides an exemption from the Act’s 
overtime pay requirements for live-in 
domestic workers. The current 
regulations allow an employer of a live- 
in domestic worker to maintain a copy 
of the agreement of hours to be worked 
and to indicate that the employee’s 
work time generally coincides with that 
agreement, instead of requiring the 
employer to maintain an accurate record 
of hours actually worked by the live-in 
domestic worker. The Department is 
concerned that not all hours worked are 
actually captured by such agreement 
and paid, which may result in a 
minimum wage violation. The current 
regulations do not provide a sufficient 
basis to determine whether the 
employee has in fact received at least 
the minimum wage for all hours 
worked. 

The Department has re-examined the 

regulations and determined that the 
regulations, as currently written, have 
expanded the scope of the 
companionship services exemption 
beyond those employees whom 
Congress intended to exempt when it 
enacted § 13(a)(15) of the Act, and do 
not provide a sufficient basis for 
determining whether live-in workers 
subject to § 13(b)(21) of the Act have 
been paid at least the minimum wage 
for all hours worked. Therefore, the 
Department proposes to amend the 
regulations to revise the definitions of 
‘‘domestic service employment’’ and 
‘‘companionship services,’’ and to 
require employers of live-in domestic 
workers to maintain an accurate record 
of hours worked by such employees. In 
addition, the proposed regulation would 
limit the scope of duties a companion 
may perform, and would prohibit 

employees of third-party employers 
from claiming the exemption. 
3. Description of and, Where Feasible, 
an Estimate of the Number of Small 
Entities To Which the Proposed Rule 
Will Apply 
Definition of Small Entity 

The RFA defines a ‘‘small entity’’ as 
a (1) small not-for-profit organization, 
(2) small governmental jurisdiction, or 
(3) small business. The Department used 
standards defined by SBA to classify 
entities as small for the purpose of this 
analysis. For the two industries that are 
the focus of this analysis, the SBA 
defines a small business as one that has 
average annual receipts of less than 
$13.5 million for HHCS and $7 million 
for SEPD. 
Data Sources and Methods 

The Department combined Quarterly 
Census of Employment and Wages data 
for the HHCS and SEPD industries, then 
used the Statistics of US Business 
(SUSB), 2002, data set to distribute 
establishments and employees to the 
following size categories: 0, 1–4, 5–9, 
10–19, 20–99, 100–499, and 500+ 
employees. Therefore, the Department 
analyzed small business impacts using 
establishment size as a proxy for firm 
size. 

Although basing this analysis on 

establishment size will bias results, the 
bias will tend to overestimate the 
number of small business affected by 
the rule and the impacts to those small 
businesses. First, the analysis 
overestimates the number of small 
entities; a firm composed of multiple 
establishments might earn aggregate 
revenues that exceed the threshold the 
SBA used to define ‘‘small’’ in these 
industries. Second, costs are in part a 
function of the number of firms in the 
industry due to the need for each firm 
to become familiar with the proposed 
rule. Our cost model thus assigns those 
familiarization costs to each 
establishment. Again, to the extent firms 
own multiple establishments, 
compliance costs associated with 
regulatory familiarization will be 
smaller than estimated here. Third, 
compliance costs are also a function of 
the number of establishment employees. 
Because there are no data linking the 

failure to pay minimum and overtime 
wages to establishment size, the 
Department assumed compliance costs 
associated with meeting those 
requirements would be proportionate to 
the number of establishment employees. 
Therefore, these costs increase in 
proportion to establishment size (as 
measured by the number of employees), 
and smaller establishments are not 
unduly impacted relative to larger 
establishments. 
Number of Small Entities Impacted by 
Proposed Rule 

Based on the estimated average 

annual revenues per establishment in 
each employment size category derived 
from SUSB data and attributed to the 
establishments in the HHCS and SEPD 
industries, it appears that no employers 
exceed the SBA size standards of $13.5 
million in annual revenues for HHCS 
and $7 million in annual revenues for 
SEPD. Thus, for the purposes of this 
analysis, the entire HHCS and SEPD 
industries are composed of small 
businesses. Although in reality it is 
highly likely that there are some firms 
in the 100–499 and 500+ employee 
categories that earn revenues in excess 
of the SBA standard for their industry, 
we have not underestimated the number 
of small firms affected by the rule. We 
also believe we have not 
mischaracterized this sector in any 
meaningful way; we believe these 
industries are primarily, if not 
completely, composed of small 
businesses by SBA standards. 

Table 6–1 presents the estimated 

number of establishments, employees, 
and revenue by establishment size, 
although the Department is analyzing 
and presenting the impacts to small 
businesses without identifying any of 
the employers as large (in the 100–499 
and the 500+ employee categories). 
Table 6–1 shows that the 500+ 
employee category employs 42 percent 
of workers, and accounts for 19 percent 
of establishments and 42 percent of 
revenue for the combined industries. 
Conversely, establishments with fewer 
than 20 employees account for only six 
percent of employment but nearly 44 
percent of establishments.

4. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping 
and Other Compliance Requirements of 
the Proposed Rule 

The FLSA sets minimum wage, 
overtime pay, and recordkeeping 
requirements for employment subject to 
its provisions. Unless exempt, covered 
employees must be paid at least the 
minimum wage and not less than one 
and one-half times their regular rates of 
pay for overtime hours worked. Workers 
performing domestic service but not 
meeting the proposed definition of 
companionship services and 
companions and live-in domestic 
service workers employed by third 
parties will need to be paid in 
accordance with the FLSA’s minimum 
wage and overtime pay provisions. 

Every covered employer must keep 
certain records for each non-exempt 
worker. The regulations at 29 CFR part 
516 requires employers to maintain 
records for employees subject to the 
minimum wage and overtime pay 
provisions of the FLSA. As indicated in 
this analysis, the NPRM would expand 
minimum wage and overtime pay 
coverage to approximately 776,000 
workers. The recordkeeping 
requirements under 29 CFR part 516 are 
not new requirements, however, some 
employees would be included in the 
universe of covered employees if the 
NPRM were to be made final without 
change. This would result in an increase 
in employer burden and is estimated in 
the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
section of this NPRM. Note that the 
burdens reported for the PRA section of 

this NPRM include the entire 
information collection and not merely 
the additional burden estimated as a 
result of this NPRM. 
Cost to Small Entities 

Tables 6–2 through 6–4 present the 
results of the first year, recurring year, 
and annualized cost and impact 
analyses as distributed by establishment 
size. The figures in these tables include 
the costs of regulatory familiarization, 
complying with minimum wage 
requirements, travel pay, and overtime 
pay assuming employers respond to 
work in excess of 40 hours per week by 
paying the overtime premium (Scenario 
1). This scenario is the most costly of 
the three examined, and thus the results 
presented here show the upper bound 
limit anticipated.

First year costs range from $54 for 

entities where the owner has no 
employees in addition to him- or herself 
(a 0 employee establishment), to $5,600 
per establishment for entities with more 
than 500 employees (Table 6–2). Annual 
recurring costs are somewhat smaller, 
ranging from $151 per year per 
establishment in the 1 to 4 employee 
class, to $5,500 in the 500 employee or 
more size class (Table 6–3). Over ten 
years, the rule is projected to cost 
establishments an annual average 
ranging from $7 for 0 employee 
establishments to $5,500 for 500+ 
employee establishments per year when 
costs are annualized using a 7 percent 
real interest rate (Table 6–4). 

Total costs and cost per establishment 

are consistently proportionate to 
establishment size as measured by 
either revenues or employment 
regardless of cost type (first year, 
recurring, or annualized). For example, 
employers with more than 500 
employees are projected to incur 41 
percent of total first year costs, which is 
proportionate to their share of the 
industry employment and revenues (see 
Table 6–2). In addition, the ratio of 
compliance costs to average 
establishment revenue is relatively 
similar regardless of establishment size. 
For example, Table 6–4 shows that 
average annualized compliance costs 
vary between 0.16 and 0.24 percent of 
average annual revenues for all 
establishments ranging from the 1 to 4 
employee class to the 500+ employee 
class. 

In summary, first-year compliance 

costs do not exceed $2,600 for 
establishments with fewer than 100 
employees, and do not exceed $5,600 
for those with more than 100 
employees; first-year compliance costs 
do not exceed 0.24 percent of 
establishment revenue for all 
establishment size classes; average 
annualized compliance costs do not 
exceed $2,600 for establishments with 
fewer than 100 employees, and do not 
exceed $5,600 for those with more than 
100 employees; and average annualized 
compliance costs do not exceed 0.24 
percent of establishment revenue 
regardless of establishment size. 

Impacts to small businesses are 

unlikely to vary significantly over time. 
Existing firms incur regulatory 
familiarization costs once, and these 
costs do not impose a significant 
economic burden. Recurring costs such 
as overtime and travel pay (transfer 
payments in the E.O. 12866 analysis) are 
proportionate to firm size. These costs 
will increase if the firm grows, but in 
proportion to the firm’s ability to bear 
them. As new firms enter the market, 
they will bear the same costs: one-time 
regulatory familiarization costs, and 
recurring payments for overtime and 
travel. Again, recurring costs will be 
proportionate to firm size. Therefore, if 
the proposed revisions to the 
companionship regulations are 
affordable for existing firms, they will 
be affordable to new market entrants as 
well. 

There are limitations to this analysis. 

It is assumed that the distribution of 
employees by establishment size has not 
changed significantly since 2002 
(although the number of employees has 
increased significantly). We also assume 
that the occupations of HHA and PCA 
are distributed by establishment size 
similarly to other occupations in the 
HHCS and SEPD industries. With the 
exponential growth in these industries, 
it is possible that the distribution of 
workers by employment size class has 
shifted. In addition, the cost analysis 
conducted in this report is unable to 
capture the difference in costs for urban 
versus rural home health care agencies. 
Differing Compliance and Reporting 
Requirements for Small Entities 

This NPRM provides no differing 

compliance requirements and reporting 
requirements for small entities. The 
Department has strived to minimize 
respondent recordkeeping burden by 
requiring no order or specific form of 
records that are required under the 
FLSA and its corresponding regulations. 
Moreover, employers would normally 
maintain the records under usual or 
customary business practices. 
Least Burdensome Option or 
Explanation Required 

The Department believes it has 

chosen the most effective option that 
updates and clarifies the rule and which 
results in the least burden. Among the 
options considered by the Department, 
the least restrictive option was taking no

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

regulatory action and the most 
restrictive was defining companionship 
services as fellowship and protection of 
the aged or infirm individual 
accompanied by a five percent 
allowance for assistance with ADLs 
only. Taking no regulatory action does 
not address the Department’s concerns 
discussed above under Need for 
Regulation. The Department found the 
most restrictive option to be overly 
burdensome on business in general and 
specifically small business. 

Pursuant to section 603(c) of the RFA, 

the following alternatives are to be 
addressed: 

i. Differing compliance or reporting 

requirements that take into account the 
resources available to small entities. The 
FLSA creates a level playing field for 
businesses by setting a floor below 
which employers may not pay their 
employees. As discussed elsewhere in 
this IRFA, the annualized cost of the 
proposed rule is estimated to be $158 
for an employer with 1–4 employees 
and $5533 for an employer with more 
than 500 employees. See Table 6–4. To 
establish differing compliance or 
reporting requirements for small 
businesses would undermine this 
important purpose of the FLSA and 
appears to not be necessary given the 
small annualized cost of the rule. The 
Department makes available a variety of 
resources to employers for 
understanding their obligations and 
achieving compliance. Therefore the 
Department declines to establish 
differing compliance or reporting 
requirements for small businesses. 

ii. The clarification, consolidation, or 

simplification of compliance and 
reporting requirements for small 
entities. This proposed rule simplifies 
and clarifies compliance requirements 
for employers of workers performing 
companionship services. The proposed 
rule imposes no reporting requirements. 
The recordkeeping requirements 
imposed by this proposed rule are 
necessary for the Department and 
domestic service employees to 
determine the employer’s compliance 
with the law. The recordkeeping 
provisions apply generally to all 
businesses—large and small—covered 
by the FLSA, no rational basis exists for 
creating an exemption from compliance 
and recordkeeping requirements for 
small businesses in the HHCS and SEPD 
industries. The Department makes 
available a variety of resources to 
employers for understanding their 
obligations and achieving compliance. 

iii. The use of performance rather 

than design standards. Under the 
proposed rule, the employer may 
achieve compliance through a variety of 

means. The employer may elect to 
provide companionship services as 
defined in the proposed rule and 
maintain the exemption; or hire 
additional workers and/or spread 
employment over the employer’s 
existing workforce to ensure employees 
do not work more than 40 hours in a 
workweek, and/or pay employees time 
and one-half for time worked over 40 
hours in a workweek. In addition, the 
FLSA recordkeeping provisions require 
no particular order or form of records to 
be maintained so employers may create 
and maintain records in the manner best 
fitting their situation. The Department 
makes available a variety of resources to 
employers for understanding their 
obligations and achieving compliance. 

iv. An exemption from coverage of the 

rule, or any part thereof, for such small 
entities. Creating an exemption from 
coverage of this rule for businesses with 
as many as 500 employees, those 
defined as small businesses under 
SBA’s size standards, is inconsistent 
with Congressional intent in expanding 
FLSA coverage to domestic service 
workers and its creation of the 
companionship services exemption. 
5. Identification, to the Extent 
Practicable, of all Relevant Federal 
Rules That May Duplicate, Overlap, or 
Conflict With the Proposed rule 

The Department is not aware of any 
federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or 
conflict with this NPRM. 
Unfunded Mandates 

Title II of the Unfunded Mandates 

Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L.104–4; 
UMRA) establishes requirements for 
Federal agencies to assess the effects of 
their regulatory actions on State, local, 
and tribal governments as well as on the 
private sector. Under Section 202(a)(1) 
of UMRA, the Department must 
generally prepare a written statement, 
including a cost-benefit analysis, for 
proposed and final regulations that 
‘‘includes any Federal mandate that may 
result in the expenditure by State, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate 
or by the private sector’’ in excess of 
$100 million per year. 

State, local and tribal government 

entities are within the scope of the 
regulated community for this proposed 
regulation to the extent government 
agencies employ HHAs and PCAs to 
provide home health care services, and 
claim these employees are exempt from 
minimum wage and overtime 
requirements because of the 
companionship services exemption 
under the FLSA. State governments 
might also be affected by the rule 
because Medicaid payments for such 

services might increase as a result of 
these proposed revisions to the 
exemption. 

The Department has determined that 

this rule contains a Federal mandate 
that is likely to result in expenditures of 
$100 million or more for State, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate, 
or the private sector in any one year. 
Total costs are projected to exceed $100 
million in the first year of the rule and 
in average annualized costs (see Tables 
4–1 and 4–2) under two of the three 
scenarios examined. 

The Department has determined that 

the rule does not significantly affect a 
substantial number of small business 
entities that provide home health care 
services. Although it has not estimated 
the number of government agencies that 
provide similar services, there is 
insufficient basis for expecting that 
costs and impacts to government 
agencies that provide these services will 
differ significantly from private 
business. Identified compliance costs 
consist of a one-time cost for regulatory 
familiarization, and potential additional 
costs per employee should the agency 
choose to pay overtime rather than 
increase employment to cover hours 
worked in excess of 40 hours per week 
by its employees. The data show that a 
relatively small percent of employees in 
these professions work more than 40 
hours per week for the same employer. 
The Department expects that 
compliance costs for government 
agencies will be a similar magnitude as 
for private businesses. 

Finally, on average, about 75 percent 

of home health care costs are paid by 
Medicare and Medicaid, and the 
government agencies spent about $58.1 
billion on home health care programs in 
2009. The Department projects the 
average first year cost of the rule ranges 
from $43 to $182 million depending on 
how home health care agencies respond 
to overtime requirements. If Medicare 
and Medicaid continue to pay 75 
percent of home health care costs, 
roughly $32 million to $137 million in 
costs might be incurred by these 
government agencies. These costs 
compose 0.06 to 0.24 percent of total 
HHS and state outlays for home health 
care programs. 
VIII. Executive Order 13132 
(Federalism) 

The proposed rule does not have 

federalism implications as outlined in 
Executive Order 13132 regarding 
federalism. The proposed rule does not 
have substantial direct effects on the 
states, on the relationship between the 
national government and the states, or 
on the distribution of power and

responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
IX. Executive Order 13175, Indian 
Tribal Governments 

This proposed rule was reviewed 
under the terms of Executive Order 
13175 and determined not to have 
‘‘tribal implications.’’ The proposed rule 
does not have ‘‘substantial direct effects 
on one or more Indian tribes, on the 
relationship between the Federal 
government and Indian tribes, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
government and Indian tribes.’’ As a 
result, no tribal summary impact 
statement has been prepared. 
X. Effects on Families 

The undersigned hereby certifies that 

this proposed rule will not adversely 
affect the well-being of families, as 
discussed under section 654 of the 
Treasury and General Government 
Appropriations Act, 1999. 
XI. Executive Order 13045, Protection 
of Children 

Executive Order 13045, dated April 
23, 1997 (62 FR 19885), applies to any 

rule that (1) is determined to be 
‘‘economically significant’’ as defined in 
Executive Order 12866, and (2) concerns 
an environmental health or safety risk 
that the promulgating agency has reason 
to believe may have a disproportionate 
effect on children. This proposal is not 
subject to Executive Order 13045 
because it has no environmental health 
or safety risks that may 
disproportionately affect children. 
XII. Environmental Impact Assessment 

A review of this proposal in 

accordance with the requirements of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; the 
regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality, 40 CFR part 
1500 et seq.; and the Departmental 
NEPA procedures, 29 CFR part 11, 
indicates that the proposed rule will not 
have a significant impact on the quality 
of the human environment. As a result, 
there is no corresponding 
environmental assessment or an 
environmental impact statement. 

XIII. Executive Order 13211, Energy 
Supply 

This proposed rule is not subject to 

Executive Order 13211. It will not have 
a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy. 
XIV. Executive Order 12630, 
Constitutionally Protected Property 
Rights 

This proposal is not subject to 

Executive Order 12630, because it does 
not involve implementation of a policy 
‘‘that has takings implications’’ or that 
could impose limitations on private 
property use. 
XV. Executive Order 12988, Civil 
Justice Reform Analysis 

This proposed rule was drafted and 

reviewed in accordance with Executive 
Order 12988 and will not unduly 
burden the Federal court system. The 
proposed rule was: (1) Reviewed to 
eliminate drafting errors and 
ambiguities; (2) written to minimize 
litigation; and (3) written to provide a 
clear legal standard for affected conduct 
and to promote burden reduction.

Federal  Register / Vol.  76,  No.  248 / Tuesday,  December  27,  2011 / Proposed  Rules 

List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 552 

Domestic service workers, 

Companionship, Employment, Labor, 
Minimum wages, Overtime pay, 
Reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements, Wages. 

Signed at Washington, DC on this 16th day 

of December. 
Nancy J. Leppink, 
Deputy Administrator, Wage and Hour 
Division. 

For the reasons discussed in the 

preamble, the Wage and Hour Division 
proposes to amend 29 CFR part 552 as 
follows: 

PART 552—APPLICATION OF THE 
FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT TO 
DOMESTIC SERVICE 

1. The authority citation for part 552 

continues to read as follows: 

Authority: 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(15), (b)(21), 88 

stat. 62; Sec. 29(b) of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act Amendments of 1974 (Pub. L. 
93–259, 88 Stat. 76). 

2. Revise § 552.3 to read as follows: 

§ 552.3 Domestic Service Employment. 

The term ‘‘domestic service 

employment’’ means services of a 
household nature performed by an 
employee in or about a private home 
(permanent or temporary). The term 
includes services performed by 
employees such as companions, 
babysitters, cooks, waiters, butlers, 
valets, maids, housekeepers, nannies, 
nurses, janitors, laundresses, caretakers, 
handymen, gardeners, home health 
aides, personal care aides, and 
chauffeurs of automobiles for family 
use. This listing is illustrative and not 
exhaustive. 

3. Revise § 552.6 to read as follows: 

§ 552.6 Companionship services for the 
aged or infirm. 

(a) As used in section 13(a)(15) of the 
Act, the term ‘‘companionship services’’ 
means the provision of fellowship and 
protection for a person who, because of 
advanced age or physical or mental 
infirmity, is unable to care for 
themselves. The provision of fellowship 
means to engage the person in social, 
physical, and mental activities, 
including conversation, reading, games, 
crafts, walks, errands, appointments, 
and social events. The provision of 
protection means to be present with the 
person in their home or to accompany 
the person when outside of the home to 
monitor the person’s safety and well- 
being. 

(b) The term ‘‘companionship 

services’’ may include intimate personal 
care services that are incidental to the 
provision of fellowship and protection

for the aged or infirm person. Intimate 
personal care services that are 
incidental to the provision of fellowship 
and protection for the aged or infirm 
person must be performed attendant to 
and in conjunction with the provision of 
fellowship or protection. The 
performance of incidental intimate 
personal care services must not exceed 
20 percent of the total hours worked in 
the workweek. These incidental 
intimate personal care services include 
tasks assisting the person being cared 
for, such as: 

(1) occasional dressing, such as 

assistance with putting on and taking off 
outerwear and footwear; 

(2) occasional grooming, including 
combing and brushing hair, assisting 
with brushing teeth, application of 
deodorant, or cleansing the hands and 
face of the person, such as before or 
after meals; 

(3) occasional toileting, including 

assisting with transfers, mobility, 
positioning, use of toileting equipment 
and supplies (such as toilet paper, 
wipes, and elevated toilet seats or safety 
frames), changing diapers, and related 
personal cleansing; 

(4) occasional driving to 

appointments, errands, and social 
events; 

(5) occasional feeding, including 
preparing food eaten by the person 
while the companion is present and 
assisting with clean-up associated with 
such food preparation and feeding; 

(6) occasional placing clothing that 

has been worn by the person in the 
laundry, including depositing the 
person’s clothing in a washing machine 
or dryer, and assisting with hanging, 
folding, and putting away the person’s 
clothing; and 

(7) occasional bathing when exigent 

circumstances arise. 

(c) Incidental intimate personal care 

services does not include household 
work benefiting other members of the 
household, such as general 
housekeeping, making meals for other 
members of the household or laundering 
clothing worn or linens used by other 
members of the household. Similarly, 
household services performed by, or 
ordinarily performed by, employees 
such as cooks, waiters, butlers, valets, 
maids, housekeepers, nannies, nurses, 
janitors, laundresses, caretakers, 
handymen, gardeners, home health 
aides, personal care aides, and 
chauffeurs of automobiles for family 
use, are not ‘‘companionship services’’ 
unless they are performed only 
incidental to the provision of fellowship 
and protection as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. 

(d) The term ‘‘companionship 

services’’ does not include medical care 
(that is typically provided by personnel 
with specialized training) for the 
person, including, but not limited to, 
catheter and ostomy care, wound care, 
injections, blood and blood pressure 
testing, turning and repositioning, 
determining the need for medication, 
tube feeding, and physical therapy. 
Performing such medical care in or 
about a private household is included in 
the category of domestic service 
employment. The term ‘‘companionship 
services’’ however, includes reminding 
the aged or infirm person of a medical 
appointment or a predetermined 
medicinal schedule. Such a reminder is 
part of the intimate personal care 
services that are incidental to the 
provision of fellowship and protection 
for the aged or infirm person. 

§ 552.102 [Amended] 

4. Revise § 552.102 (b) to read as 

follows: 
*

* 

* 

* 

(b) If it is found by the parties that 

there is a significant deviation from the 
initial agreement, the parties should 
reach a new agreement that reflects the 
actual facts. 

5. Amend § 552.109 to revise 

paragraphs (a) and (c) to read as follows: 

§ 552.109 Third Party Employment. 

(a) Third party employers of 

employees engaged in companionship 
services within the meaning of § 552.6 
may not avail themselves of the 
minimum wage and overtime exemption 
provided by section 13(a)(15) of the Act, 
even if the employee is jointly 
employed by the individual or member 
of the family or household using the 
services. However, the individual or 
member of the family or household, 
even if considered a joint employer, is 
still entitled to assert the exemption, if 
the employee meets all of the 
requirements of § 552.6. 

(b) * * * 
(c) Third party employers of 

household workers engaged in live-in 
domestic services within the meaning of 
§ 552.102 may not avail themselves of 
the overtime exemption provided by 
section 13(b)(21) of the Act, even if the 
employee is jointly employed by the 
individual or member of the family or 
household using the services. However, 
the individual or member of the family 
or household, even if considered a joint 
employer, is still entitled to assert the 
exemption.
