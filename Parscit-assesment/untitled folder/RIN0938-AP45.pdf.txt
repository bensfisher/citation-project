Medicare Program; Proposed Hospice 
Wage Index for Fiscal Year 2010 
AGENCY: Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS), HHS. 
ACTION: Proposed rule; request for 
comments. 

SUMMARY: This proposed rule would set 
forth the hospice wage index for fiscal 
year 2010. The proposed rule would 
adopt a MedPAC recommendation 
regarding a process for certification and 
recertification of terminal illness. This 
proposed rule would also continue the 
phase-out of the wage index budget 
neutrality adjustment factor (BNAF), 
which will conclude in 2011. In 
addition, we are requesting comments 
on a suggestion to require recertification 
visits by physicians or advanced 
practice nurses, and on issues of 
payment reform for use in possible 
future policy development. Finally, the 
proposed rule would make several 
technical and clarifying changes to the 
regulatory text. 
DATES: To be assured consideration, 
comments must be received at one of 
the addresses provided below, no later 
than 5 p.m. on June 22, 2009.

A. General 
1. Hospice Care 

Hospice care is an approach to 
treatment that recognizes that the 
impending death of an individual 
warrants a change in the focus from 
curative care to palliative care for relief 
of pain and for symptom management. 
The goal of hospice care is to help 
terminally ill individuals continue life 
with minimal disruption to normal 
activities while remaining primarily in 
the home environment. A hospice uses

an interdisciplinary approach to deliver 
medical, nursing, social, psychological, 
emotional, and spiritual services 
through use of a broad spectrum of 
professional and other caregivers, with 
the goal of making the individual as 
physically and emotionally comfortable 
as possible. Counseling services and 
inpatient respite services are available 
to the family of the hospice patient. 
Hospice programs consider both the 
patient and the family as a unit of care. 
Section 1861(dd) of the Social Security 
Act (the Act) provides for coverage of 
hospice care for terminally ill Medicare 
beneficiaries who elect to receive care 
from a participating hospice. Section 
1814(i) of the Act provides payment for 
Medicare participating hospices. 
2. Medicare Payment for Hospice Care 

Our regulations at 42 CFR part 418 

establish eligibility requirements, 
payment standards and procedures, 
define covered services, and delineate 
the conditions a hospice must meet to 
be approved for participation in the 
Medicare program. Part 418, subpart G 
provides for payment in one of four 
prospectively-determined rate categories 
(routine home care, continuous home 
care, inpatient respite care, and general 
inpatient care) to hospices based on 
each day a qualified Medicare 
beneficiary is under a hospice election. 
B. Hospice Wage Index 

Our regulations at § 418.306(c) require 
that the wage index for all labor markets 
in which Medicare-participating 
hospices do business be established 
using the most current hospital wage 
data available, including any changes by 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) to the Metropolitan Statistical 
Areas (MSAs) definitions. OMB revised 
the MSA definitions beginning in 2003 
with new designations called the Core 
Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). For the 
purposes of the hospice benefit, the 
term ‘‘MSA-based’’ refers to wage index 
values and designations based on the 
previous MSA designations before 2003. 
Conversely, the term ‘‘CBSA-based’’ 
refers to wage index values and 
designations based on the OMB revised 
MSA designations in 2003, which now 
include CBSAs. In the August 11, 2004 
IPPS final rule (69 FR 49026), the 
revised labor market area definitions 
were adopted at § 412.64(b), which were 
effective October 1, 2004 for acute care 
hospitals. We also revised the labor 
market areas for hospices using the new 
OMB standards that included CBSAs. In 
the FY 2006 hospice wage index final 
rule (70 FR 45130), we implemented a 
1-year transition policy using a 50/50 
blend of the CBSA-based wage index

values and the MSA-based wage index 
values for FY 2006. The one-year 
transition policy ended on September 
30, 2006. For FY 2007, FY 2008, and FY 
2009, we used wage index values based 
on CBSA designations. 

The hospice wage index is used to 

adjust payment rates for hospice 
agencies under the Medicare program to 
reflect local differences in area wage 
levels. The original hospice wage index 
was based on the 1981 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics hospital data and had not been 
updated since 1983. In 1994, because of 
disparity in wages from one 
geographical location to another, a 
committee was formulated to negotiate 
a wage index methodology that could be 
accepted by the industry and the 
government. This committee, 
functioning under a process established 
by the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 
1990, was comprised of national 
hospice associations; rural, urban, large 
and small hospices; multi-site hospices; 
consumer groups; and a government 
representative. On April 13, 1995, the 
Hospice Wage Index Negotiated 
Rulemaking Committee signed an 
agreement for the methodology to be 
used for updating the hospice wage 
index. 

In the August 8, 1997 Federal 

Register (62 FR 42860), we published a 
final rule implementing a new 
methodology for calculating the hospice 
wage index based on the 
recommendations of the negotiated 
rulemaking Committee, using a hospital 
wage index rather than continuing to 
use the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
data. The committee statement was 
included in the appendix of that final 
rule (62 FR 42883). The reduction in 
overall Medicare payments if a new 
wage index were adopted was noted in 
the November 29, 1995 notice 
transmitting the recommendations of 
the negotiated rulemaking committee 
(60 FR 61264). Therefore, the Committee 
also decided that for each year in 
updating the hospice wage index, 
aggregate Medicare payments to 
hospices would remain budget neutral 
to payments as if the 1983 wage index 
had been used. 

As decided upon by the Committee, 

budget neutrality means that, in a given 
year, estimated aggregate payments for 
Medicare hospice services using the 
updated hospice values will equal 
estimated payments that would have 
been made for these services if the 1983 
hospice wage index values had 
remained in effect. Although payments 
to individual hospice programs may 
change each year, the total payments 
each year to hospices would not be 
affected by using the updated hospice 

wage index because total payments 
would be budget neutral as if the 1983 
wage index had been used. To 
implement this policy, a BNAF would 
be computed and applied annually to 
the pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index, when deriving the hospice 
wage index. 

The BNAF is calculated by computing 

estimated payments using the most 
recent completed year of hospice claims 
data. The units (days or hours) from 
those claims are multiplied by the 
updated hospice payment rates to 
calculate estimated payments. For this 
proposed rule, that means estimating 
payments for FY 2010 using FY 2007 
hospice claims data, and applying the 
estimated FY 2010 hospice payment 
rates (updating the FY 2009 rates by the 
FY 2010 estimated hospital market 
basket update). The FY 2010 hospice 
wage index values are then applied to 
the labor portion of the payment rates 
only. The procedure is repeated using 
the same claims data and payment rates, 
but using the 1983 BLS-based wage 
index instead of the updated raw pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index (note that both wage indices 
include their respective floor 
adjustments). The total payments are 
then compared, and the adjustment 
required to make total payments equal 
is computed; that adjustment factor is 
the BNAF. 

The hospice wage index is updated 

annually. Our most recent update, 
published in the Federal Register (73 
FR 46464) on August 8, 2008, set forth 
updates to the hospice wage index for 
FY 2009. That update also finalized a 
provision for a 3-year phase-out of the 
BNAF, which was applied to the wage 
index values. As discussed in detail 
below, the update was later revised with 
the February 17, 2009 passage of the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act (ARRA), which eliminated the 
BNAF phase-out for FY 2009. 
1. Raw Wage Index Values (Pre-Floor, 
Pre-Reclassified Hospital Wage Index) 
As described in the August 8, 1997 
hospice wage index final rule (62 FR 
42860), the pre-floor and pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index is used 
as the raw wage index for the hospice 
benefit. These raw wage index values 
are then subject to either a BNAF or 
application of the hospice floor 
calculation to compute the hospice 
wage index used to determine payments 
to hospices. 

Pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 

wage index values of 0.8 or greater are 
adjusted by the BNAF. Pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index values 
below 0.8 are adjusted by the greater of:

(1) The hospice BNAF; or (2) the 
hospice 15 percent floor adjustment, 
which is a 15 percent increase subject 
to a maximum wage index value of 0.8. 
For example, if County A has a pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index (raw wage index) value of 0.4000, 
we would perform the following 
calculations using the BNAF (which for 
this example is 0.060988; we added 1 to 
simplify the calculation) and the 
hospice floor to determine County A’s 
hospice wage index: 

Pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index value below 0.8 multiplied 
by the BNAF: (0.4000 × 1.060988 = 
0.4244) 

Pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 

wage index value below 0.8 multiplied 
by the hospice 15 percent floor 
adjustment: (0.4000 × 1.15 = 0.4600). 
Based on these calculations, County 

A’s hospice wage index would be 
0.4600. 

The BNAF has been computed and 

applied annually to the labor portion of 
the hospice payment. Currently, the 
labor portion of the payment rates is as 
follows: For Routine Home Care, 68.71 
percent; for Continuous Home Care, 
68.71 percent; for General Inpatient 
Care, 64.01 percent; and for Respite 
Care, 54.13 percent. The non-labor 
portion is equal to 100 percent minus 
the labor portion for each level of care. 
Therefore the non-labor portion of the 
payment rates is as follows: for Routine 
Home Care, 31.29 percent; for 
Continuous Home Care, 31.29 percent; 
for General Inpatient Care, 35.99 
percent; and for Respite Care, 45.87 
percent. 

The August 8, 2008 FY 2009 Hospice 

Wage Index final rule (73 FR 46464) 
implemented a phase-out of the hospice 
BNAF over 3 years, beginning with a 25 
percent reduction in the BNAF in FY 
2009, an additional 50 percent 
reduction for a total of 75 percent in FY 
2010, and complete phase out of the 
BNAF in FY 2011. However, subsequent 
to the publication of the above rule, the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111–5) (ARRA) 
eliminated the BNAF phase-out for FY 
2009. Specifically, division B, section 
4301(a) of ARRA prohibited the 
Secretary from phasing out or 
eliminating the BNAF in the Medicare 
hospice wage index before October 1, 
2009, and instructed the Secretary to 
recompute and apply the final Medicare 
hospice wage index for FY 2009 as if 
there had been no reduction in the 
BNAF. We have done so in an 
administrative instruction to our 
intermediaries, which was issued as 
Change Request (CR) #6418 (Transmittal 
#1701, dated 3/13/2009). 

While ARRA eliminated the BNAF 

phase-out for FY 2009, it neither 
changed the 75 percent reduction in the 
BNAF for FY 2010, nor prohibited the 
elimination of the BNAF in FY 2011 
that were previously implemented in 
the August 8, 2008 Hospice Wage Index 
final rule. The provision in the ARRA 
that eliminated the FY 2009 BNAF 
reduction provided the hospice industry 
additional time to prepare for the FY 
2010 75 percent BNAF reduction and 
the FY 2011 BNAF elimination. 
Therefore, in accordance with the 
August 8, 2008 FY 2009 Hospice Wage 
Index final rule, the rationale presented 
in that final rule, and consistent with 
section 4301(a) of ARRA, CMS plans to 
reduce the BNAF by 75 percent in FY 
2010 and ultimately eliminate the BNAF 
in 2011. We are accepting comments on 
the BNAF reductions. 
2. Changes to Core Based Statistical 
Area (CBSA) Designations 

The annual update to the hospice 

wage index is published in the Federal 
Register and is based on the most 
current available hospital wage data, as 
well as any changes by OMB to the 
definitions of MSAs, which now 
include CBSA designations. The August 
4, 2005 hospice wage index final rule 
(70 FR 45130) set forth the adoption of 
the changes discussed in the OMB 
Bulletin No. 03–04 (June 6, 2003), 
which announced revised definitions 
for Micropolitan Statistical Areas and 
the creation of MSAs and Combined 
Statistical Areas. In adopting the OMB 
CBSA geographic designations, we 
provided for a 1-year transition with a 
blended hospice wage index for all 
hospices for FY 2006. Subsequent fiscal 
years have used the full CBSA-based 
hospice wage index. 
3. Definition of Rural and Urban Areas 

Each hospice’s labor market is 

determined based on definitions of 
MSAs issued by OMB. In general, an 
urban area is defined as an MSA or New 
England County Metropolitan Area 
(NECMA) as defined by OMB. Under 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(C), a rural area is 
defined as any area outside of the urban 
area. The urban and rural area 
geographic classifications are defined in 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (C), and 
have been used for the Medicare 
hospice benefit since implementation. 

In the August 22, 2007 FY 2008 

Inpatient Prospective Payment System 
(IPPS) final rule with comment period 
(72 FR 47130), § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(B) was 
revised such that the two ‘‘New England 
deemed Counties’’ that had been 
considered rural under the OMB 
definitions (Litchfield County, CT and 

Merrimack County, NH) but deemed 
urban, were no longer considered urban 
effective for discharges occurring on or 
after October 1, 2007. Therefore, these 
two counties are considered rural in 
accordance with § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(C). 

The recommendations to adjust 

payments to reflect local differences in 
wages are codified in § 418.306(c) of our 
regulations; however there had been no 
explicit reference to § 412.64 in 
§ 418.306(c) before implementation of 
the August 8, 2008 FY 2009 Hospice 
Wage Index final rule. Although 
§ 412.64 had not been explicitly referred 
to, the hospice program has used the 
definition of urban in 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B), and 
the definition of rural as any area 
outside of an urban area in 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(C). With the 
implementation of the August 8, 2008 
FY 2009 Wage Index final rule, we now 
explicitly refer to those provisions in 
§ 412.64 to make it absolutely clear how 
we define urban and rural for purposes 
of the hospice wage index. 

Litchfield County, CT and Merrimack 

County, NH are considered rural areas 
for hospital IPPS purposes in 
accordance with § 412.64. Effective 
October 1, 2008, Litchfield County, CT 
was no longer considered part of urban 
CBSA 25540 (Hartford-West Hartford- 
East Hartford, CT), and Merrimack 
County, NH was no longer considered 
part of urban CBSA 31700 (Manchester- 
Nashua, NH). Rather, these counties are 
now considered to be rural areas within 
their respective States under the hospice 
payment system. When the raw pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index was adopted for use in deriving 
the hospice wage index, it was decided 
not to take into account IPPS geographic 
reclassifications. This policy of 
following OMB designations of rural or 
urban, rather than considering some 
counties to be ‘‘deemed’’ urban, is 
consistent with our policy of not taking 
into account IPPS geographic 
reclassifications in determining 
payments under the hospice wage 
index. 
4. Areas Without Hospital Wage Data 

When adopting OMB’s new labor 
market designations in FY 2006, we 
identified some geographic areas where 
there were no hospitals, and thus, no 
hospital wage index data on which to 
base the calculation of the hospice wage 
index. Beginning in FY 2006, we 
adopted a policy to use the FY 2005 pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index value for rural areas when no 
hospital wage data were available. We 
also adopted the policy that for urban 
labor markets without a hospital from

which hospital wage index data could 
be derived, all of the CBSAs within the 
State would be used to calculate a 
Statewide urban average pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index value to 
use as a reasonable proxy for these 
areas. Consequently, in subsequent 
fiscal years, we applied the average pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index data from all urban areas in that 
state, to urban areas without a hospital. 
The only affected CBSA is 25980, 
Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia. 

Under the CBSA labor market areas, 
there are no hospitals in rural locations 
in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. Since 
there was no rural proxy for more recent 
rural data within those areas, in the FY 
2006 hospice wage index proposed rule 
(70 FR 22394, 22398), we proposed 
applying the FY 2005 pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index value to 
rural areas where no hospital wage data 
were available. In the FY 2006 final rule 
and in the FY 2007 update notice, we 
applied the FY 2005 pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index data to 
areas lacking hospital wage data in rural 
Massachusetts and rural Puerto Rico. 
In the FY 2008 hospice wage index 

final rule (72 FR 50217), we considered 
alternatives to our methodology to 
update the pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index for rural areas 
without hospital wage data. We 
indicated that we believed that the best 
imputed proxy for rural areas would— 
(1) use pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital data; (2) use the most local data 
available to impute a rural pre-floor, 
pre-reclassified hospital wage index; (3) 
be easy to evaluate; and (4) be easy to 
update from year-to-year. 

Therefore, in FY 2008, and again in 

FY 2009, in cases where there was a 
rural area without rural hospital wage 
data, we used the average pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index data 
from all contiguous CBSAs to represent 
a reasonable proxy for the rural area. 
This approach does not use rural data, 
however, the approach uses pre-floor, 
pre-reclassified hospital wage data, is 
easy to evaluate, is easy to update from 
year-to-year, and uses the most local 
data available. In the FY 2008 hospice 
wage index final rule (72 FR 50217), we 
noted that in determining an imputed 
rural pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index, we interpret the term 
‘‘contiguous’’ to mean sharing a border. 
For example, in the case of 
Massachusetts, the entire rural area 
consists of Dukes and Nantucket 
Counties. We determined that the 
borders of Dukes and Nantucket 
Counties are contiguous with Barnstable 
and Bristol Counties. Under the adopted 
methodology, the pre-floor, pre- 

reclassified hospital wage index values 
for the Counties of Barnstable (CBSA 
12700, Barnstable Town, MA) and 
Bristol (CBSA 39300, Providence-New 
Bedford-Fall River, RI–MA) would be 
averaged resulting in an imputed pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified rural hospital 
wage index for FY 2008. We noted in 
the FY 2008 final hospice wage index 
rule that while we believe that this 
policy could be readily applied to other 
rural areas that lack hospital wage data 
(possibly due to hospitals converting to 
a different provider type, such as a 
Critical Access Hospital, that does not 
submit the appropriate wage data), if a 
similar situation arose in the future, we 
would re-examine this policy. 

We also noted that we do not believe 

that this policy would be appropriate for 
Puerto Rico, as there are sufficient 
economic differences between hospitals 
in the United States and those in Puerto 
Rico, including the payment of hospitals 
in Puerto Rico using blended Federal/ 
Commonwealth-specific rates. 
Therefore, we believe that a separate 
and distinct policy for Puerto Rico is 
necessary. Any alternative methodology 
for imputing a pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index for rural Puerto 
Rico would need to take into account 
the economic differences between 
hospitals in the United States and those 
in Puerto Rico. Our policy of imputing 
a rural pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index based on the pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index(es) of CBSAs contiguous to the 
rural area in question does not recognize 
the unique circumstances of Puerto 
Rico. While we have not yet identified 
an alternative methodology for imputing 
a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index for rural Puerto Rico, we 
will continue to evaluate the feasibility 
of using existing hospital wage data and, 
possibly, wage data from other sources. 
For FY 2008 and FY 2009, we used the 
most recent pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index available for Puerto 
Rico, which is 0.4047. 
5. CBSA Nomenclature Changes 

The Office of Management and Budget 

(OMB) regularly publishes a bulletin 
that updates the titles of certain CBSAs. 
In the FY 2008 hospice wage index final 
rule (72 FR 50218) we noted that the FY 
2008 rule and all subsequent hospice 
wage index rules and notices would 
incorporate CBSA changes from the 
most recent OMB bulletins. The OMB 
bulletins may be accessed at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/ 
index.html.

6. Wage Data From Multi-Campus 
Hospitals 

Historically, under the Medicare 

hospice benefit, we have established 
hospice wage index values calculated 
from the raw pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage data (also called the IPPS 
wage index) without taking into account 
geographic reclassification under 
sections 1886(d)(8) and (d)(10) of the 
Act. The wage adjustment established 
under the Medicare hospice benefit is 
based on the location where services are 
furnished without any reclassification. 
For FY 2010, the data collected from 
cost reports submitted by hospitals for 
cost reporting periods beginning during 
FY 2005 were used to compute the 2009 
raw pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index data without taking into 
account geographic reclassification 
under sections 1886(d)(8) and (d)(10) of 
the Act. This 2009 raw pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index was 
used to derive the applicable wage 
index values for the hospice wage index 
because these data (FY 2005) are the 
most recent complete cost data. 

Beginning in FY 2008, the IPPS 

apportioned the wage data for multi- 
campus hospitals located in different 
labor market areas (CBSAs) to each 
CBSA where the campuses are located 
(see the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period 72 FR 47317 through 
47320). We are continuing to use the 
raw pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage data as a basis to determine the 
hospice wage index values for FY 2010 
because hospitals and hospices both 
compete in the same labor markets, and 
therefore, experience similar wage- 
related costs. We note that the use of 
raw pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
(IPPS) wage data, used to derive the FY 
2010 hospice wage index values, reflects 
the application of our policy to use that 
data to establish the hospice wage 
index. The FY 2010 hospice wage index 
values presented in this notice were 
computed consistent with our raw pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital (IPPS) 
wage index policy (that is, our historical 
policy of not taking into account IPPS 
geographic reclassifications in 
determining payments for hospice). As 
implemented in the August 8, 2008 FY 
2009 Hospice Wage Index final rule, for 
the FY 2009 Medicare hospice benefit, 
the hospice wage index was computed 
from IPPS wage data (submitted by 
hospitals for cost reporting periods 
beginning in FY 2004 (as was the FY 
2008 IPPS wage index)), which 
allocated salaries and hours to the 
campuses of two multi-campus 
hospitals with campuses that are located 
in different labor areas, one in

Massachusetts and another in Illinois. 
Thus, the FY 2009 hospice wage index 
values for the following CBSAs were 
affected by this policy: Boston-Quincy, 
MA (CBSA 14484), Providence-New 
Bedford-Falls River, RI–MA (CBSA 
39300), Chicago-Naperville-Joliet, IL 
(CBSA 16974), and Lake County- 
Kenosha County, IL–WI (CBSA 29404). 
7. Hospice Payment Rates 

Section 4441(a) of the Balanced 

Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) amended 
section 1814(i)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act to 
establish updates to hospice rates for 
FYs 1998 through 2002. Hospice rates 
were to be updated by a factor equal to 
the hospital market basket index, minus 
1 percentage point. However, neither 
the BBA nor subsequent legislation 
specified alteration to the hospital 
market basket adjustment to be used to 
compute hospice payment for fiscal 
years beyond 2002. Payment rates for 
FYs since 2002 have been updated 
according to section 1814(i)(1)(C)(ii)(VII) 
of the Act, which states that the update 
to the payment rates for subsequent 
fiscal years will be the market basket 
percentage for the fiscal year. It has been 
longstanding practice to use the 
inpatient hospital market basket as a 
proxy for a hospice market basket. 

Historically, the rate update has been 

published through a separate 
administrative instruction issued 
annually, in the summer, to provide 
adequate time to implement system 
change requirements. Hospices 
determine their payments by applying 
the hospice wage index in this proposed 
rule to the labor portion of the 
published hospice rates. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 
A. FY 2010 Proposed Hospice Wage 
Index 
1. Background 

The hospice final rule published in 
the Federal Register on December 16, 
1983 (48 FR 56008) provided for 
adjustment to hospice payment rates to 
reflect differences in area wage levels. 
We apply the appropriate hospice wage 
index value to the labor portion of the 
hospice payment rates based on the 
geographic area where hospice care was 
furnished. As noted earlier, each 
hospice’s labor market area is based on 
definitions of MSAs issued by the OMB. 
For this proposed rule, we will use the 
pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index, based solely on the CBSA 
designations, as the basis for 
determining wage index values for the 
proposed FY 2010 hospice wage index. 
As noted above, our hospice payment 
rules utilize the wage adjustment factors

used by the Secretary for purposes of 
section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act for 
hospital wage adjustments. We are 
proposing again to use the pre-floor and 
pre-reclassified hospital wage index 
data as the basis to determine the 
hospice wage index, which is then used 
to adjust the labor portion of the hospice 
payment rates based on the geographic 
area where the beneficiary receives 
hospice care. We believe the use of the 
pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index data, as a basis for the hospice 
wage index, results in the appropriate 
adjustment to the labor portion of the 
costs. For the FY 2010 update to the 
hospice wage index, we propose to 
continue to use the most recent pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index available at the time of 
publication. 
2. Areas Without Hospital Wage Data 
In adopting the CBSA designations, 

we identified some geographic areas 
where there are no hospitals, and no 
hospital wage data on which to base the 
calculation of the hospice wage index. 
These areas are described in section 
I.B.4 of this proposed rule. Beginning in 
FY 2006, we adopted a policy that, for 
urban labor markets without an urban 
hospital from which a pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index can be 
derived, all of the urban CBSA pre-floor, 
pre-reclassified hospital wage index 
values within the State would be used 
to calculate a statewide urban average 
pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index to use as a reasonable proxy for 
these areas. Currently, the only CBSA 
that would be affected by this policy is 
CBSA 25980, Hinesville, Georgia. We 
propose to continue this policy for FY 
2010. 

Currently, the only rural areas where 

there are no hospitals from which to 
calculate a pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index are Massachusetts 
and Puerto Rico. In August 2007 (72 FR 
50217) we adopted a methodology for 
imputing rural pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index values for areas 
where no hospital wage data are 
available as an acceptable proxy; that 
methodology is also described in section 
I.B.4 of this proposed rule. In FY 2010, 
Dukes and Nantucket Counties are the 
only areas in rural Massachusetts which 
are affected. We are again proposing to 
apply this methodology for imputing a 
rural pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index for those rural areas without 
rural hospital wage data in FY 2010. 

However, as we noted in section I.B.4 
of this proposed rule, we do not believe 
that this policy is appropriate for Puerto 
Rico. For FY 2010, we again propose to 
continue to use the most recent pre- 

floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index value available for Puerto Rico, 
which is 0.4047. This pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index value 
will then be adjusted upward by the 
hospice 15 percent floor adjustment in 
the computing of the proposed FY 2010 
hospice wage index. 
3. FY 2010 Wage Index With 75 Percent 
Reduced Budget Neutrality Adjustment 
Factor (BNAF) 

The hospice wage index set forth in 
this proposed rule would be effective 
October 1, 2009 through September 30, 
2010. We are not proposing any 
modifications to the hospice wage index 
methodology. In accordance with our 
regulations and the agreement signed 
with other members of the Hospice 
Wage Index Negotiated Rulemaking 
Committee, we are using the most 
current hospital data available. For this 
proposed rule, the FY 2009 hospital 
wage index was the most current 
hospital wage data available for 
calculating the FY 2010 hospice wage 
index values. We used the FY 2009 pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index data for this calculation. 

As noted above, for FY 2010, the 

hospice wage index values will be based 
solely on the adoption of the CBSA- 
based labor market definitions and the 
hospital wage index. We continue to use 
the most recent pre-floor and pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index data 
available (based on FY 2005 hospital 
cost report wage data). A detailed 
description of the methodology used to 
compute the hospice wage index is 
contained in the September 4, 1996 
hospice wage index proposed rule (61 
FR 46579), the August 8, 1997 hospice 
wage index final rule (62 FR 42860), and 
the August 8, 2008 FY 2009 Hospice 
Wage Index final rule (73 FR 46464). 

The August 8, 2008 FY 2009 Hospice 

Wage Index final rule finalized a 
provision to phase out the BNAF over 
3 years, with a 25 percent reduction in 
the BNAF in FY 2009, an additional 50 
percent reduction for a total of a 75 
percent reduction in FY 2010, and 
complete phase out in FY 2011. 
However, on February 17, 2009, the 
President signed ARRA (P.L. 111–5); 
Section 4301(a) of ARRA eliminated the 
BNAF phase-out for FY 2009. Therefore, 
in an administrative instruction (Change 
Request 6418, Transmittal 1701, dated 
3/13/2009) entitled ‘‘Revision of the 
Hospice Wage Index and the Hospice 
Pricer for FY 2009,’’ we instructed CMS 
contractors to use the revised FY 2009 
hospice Pricer, which included a 
revised hospice wage index to reflect a 
full (unreduced) BNAF rather than the 
25 percent reduced BNAF set forth in

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  78 / Friday,  April  24,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

18917 

the August 8, 2008 FY 2009 Hospice 
Wage Index final rule. 

While ARRA eliminated the BNAF 

phase-out for FY 2009, it did not change 
the 75 percent reduction in the BNAF 
for FY 2010, or the elimination of the 
BNAF in FY 2011 that was previously 
implemented in the August 8, 2008 FY 
2009 Hospice Wage Index final rule. 
The provision in ARRA that eliminated 
the FY 2009 BNAF reduction provided 
the hospice industry additional time to 
prepare for the FY 2010 75 percent 
BNAF reduction and the FY 2011 BNAF 
elimination. Therefore, in accordance 
with the August 8, 2008 FY 2009 
Hospice Wage Index final rule (73 FR 
46464), the rationale presented in that 
final rule, and consistent with the 
section 4301(a) of ARRA, we plan to 
reduce the BNAF for FY 2010 by 75 
percent, and ultimately eliminate the 
BNAF in FY 2011. We are accepting 
comments on the BNAF reductions. 

An unreduced BNAF for FY 2010 is 

computed to be 0.067845 (or 6.7845 
percent). A 75 percent reduced BNAF, 
which is subsequently applied to the 
pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index values greater than or equal to 0.8, 
is computed to be 0.016961 (or 1.6961 
percent). Pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index values, which are 
less than 0.8, are subject to the hospice 
floor calculation; that calculation is 
described in section I.B.1. 

The proposed hospice wage index for 
FY 2010 is shown in Addenda A and B. 
Specifically, Addendum A reflects the 
proposed FY 2010 wage index values for 
urban areas under the CBSA 
designations. Addendum B reflects the 
proposed FY 2010 wage index values for 
rural areas under the CBSA 
designations. 
4. Effects of Phasing Out the BNAF 

The full (unreduced) BNAF calculated 

for FY 2010 is 6.7845 percent. As 
implemented in the August 8, 2008 FY 
2009 Hospice Wage Index final rule (73 
FR 46464), we are reducing the BNAF 
by 75 percent for FY 2010, and 
eliminating it altogether for FY 2011 
and beyond. 

For FY 2010, this is mathematically 
equivalent to taking 25 percent of the 
full BNAF value, or multiplying 
0.067845 by 0.25, which equals 
0.016961 (1.6961 percent). The BNAF of 
1.6961 percent reflects a 75 percent 
reduction in the BNAF. The 75 percent 
reduced BNAF (1.6961 percent) would 
be applied to the pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index values 
of 0.8 or greater in the proposed FY 
2010 hospice wage index. 

The hospice floor calculation would 

still apply to any pre-floor, pre-

reclassified hospital wage index values 
less than 0.8. Currently, the hospice 
floor calculation has 4 steps. First, pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index values that are less than 0.8 are 
multiplied by 1.15. Second, the 
minimum of 0.8 or the pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index value 
times 1.15 is chosen as the preliminary 
hospice wage index value. Steps 1 and 
2 are referred to in this proposed rule 
as the hospice 15 percent floor 
adjustment. Third, the pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index value is 
multiplied by the BNAF. Finally, the 
greater result of either step 2 or step 3 
is chosen as the final hospice wage 
index value. The hospice floor 
calculation is unchanged by the BNAF 
reduction. We note that steps 3 and 4 
will become unnecessary once the 
BNAF is eliminated. 

We examined the effects of a 75 

percent reduction in the BNAF versus 
using the full BNAF of 6.7845 percent 
on the proposed FY 2010 hospice wage 
index. The FY 2010 BNAF reduction of 
75 percent resulted in approximately a 
4.76 to 4.77 percent reduction in most 
hospice wage index values. The 
elimination of the BNAF in FY 2011 
would result in an estimated final 
reduction of the FY 2011 hospice wage 
index values of approximately 1.66 to 
1.67 percent compared to FY 2010 
hospice wage index values. 

Those CBSAs whose pre-floor, pre- 

reclassified hospital wage index values 
had the hospice 15 percent floor 
adjustment applied before the BNAF 
reduction would not be affected by this 
proposed phase out of the BNAF. These 
CBSAs, which typically include rural 
areas, are protected by the hospice 15 
percent floor adjustment. We have 
estimated that 17 CBSAs are already 
protected by the hospice 15 percent 
floor adjustment, and are therefore 
completely unaffected by the BNAF 
reduction. There are over 100 hospices 
in these 17 CBSAs. 

Additionally, some CBSAs with pre- 

floor, pre-reclassified wage index values 
less than 0.8 will become newly eligible 
for the hospice 15 percent floor 
adjustment as a result of the 75 percent 
reduced BNAF. Areas where the hospice 
floor calculation would have yielded a 
wage index value greater than 0.8 if the 
full BNAF were applied, but which will 
have a final wage index value less than 
0.8 after the 75 percent reduced BNAF 
is applied, will now be eligible for the 
hospice 15 percent floor adjustment. 
These CBSAs will see a smaller 
reduction in their hospice wage index 
values since the hospice 15 percent 
floor adjustment will apply. We have 
estimated that 18 CBSAs will have their 

pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index value become newly protected by 
the hospice 15 percent floor adjustment 
due to the 75 percent reduction in the 
BNAF. Because of the protection given 
by the hospice 15 percent floor 
adjustment, these CBSAs will see 
smaller percentage decreases in their 
hospice wage index values than those 
CBSAs that are not eligible for the 
hospice 15 percent floor adjustment. 
This will affect those hospices with 
lower hospice wage index values, which 
are typically in rural areas. There are 
over 300 hospices located in these 18 
CBSAs. 

Finally, the hospice wage index 

values only apply to the labor portion of 
the payment rates; the labor portion is 
described in section I.B.1 of this 
proposed rule. Therefore the projected 
reduction in payments due to the 75 
percent reduction of the BNAF will be 
an estimated 3.2 percent, as described in 
column 4 of Table 1 in section VI of this 
proposed rule. In addition, the 
estimated effects of the phase-out of the 
BNAF will be mitigated by any hospital 
market basket updates in payments. We 
will not have the final market basket 
update for FY 2010 until the summer. 
However, the current estimate of the 
hospital market basket update for FY 
2010 is 2.1 percent. The final update 
will be communicated through an 
administrative instruction. The 
combined effects of a 75 percent 
reduction of the BNAF and an estimated 
hospital market basket update of 2.1 
percent for FY 2010 is an overall 
estimated decrease in payments to 
hospices in FY 2010 of 1.1 percent 
(column 5 of Table 1 in section VI of 
this proposed rule). 
B. Proposed Change to the Physician 
Certification and Recertification 
Process, § 418.22 

The Medicare Payment Advisory 

Commission (MedPAC) has noted an 
increasing proportion of hospice 
patients with stays exceeding 180 days, 
and significant variation in hospice 
length of stay. MedPAC has questioned 
whether there is sufficient 
accountability and enforcement related 
to certification and recertification of 
Medicare hospice patients. Currently, 
our policy requires the hospice medical 
director or physician member of the 
interdisciplinary group and the patient’s 
attending physician (if any) to certify 
the patient as having a terminal illness 
for the initial 90-day period of hospice 
care. Subsequent benefit periods only 
require recertification by the hospice 
medical director or by the physician 
member of the hospice interdisciplinary 
group. These certifications must

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  78 / Friday,  April  24,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

indicate that the patient’s life 
expectancy is 6 months or less if the 
illness runs its normal course, and must 
be signed by the physician. The medical 
record must include documentation that 
supports the terminal prognosis. 

At their November 6, 2008 public 

meeting, MedPAC presented the 
findings of an expert panel of hospice 
providers convened in October 2008; 
that panel noted that while many 
hospices comply with the Medicare 
eligibility criteria, some are enrolling 
and recertifying patients who are not 
eligible. 

The expert panel noted that there 

were several reasons for the variation in 
compliance. First, they noted that in 
some cases there was limited medical 
director engagement in the certification 
or recertification process. Physicians 
had delegated this responsibility to the 
staff involved with patients’ day-to-day 
care, and simply signed off on the 
paperwork. Second, inadequate charting 
of the patient’s condition or a lack of 
staff training had led some physicians to 
certify patients who were not truly 
eligible for Medicare’s hospice benefit. 
Finally, some panelists cited financial 
incentives associated with long-stay 
patients. The panelists mentioned 
anecdotal reports of hospices using 
questionable marketing strategies to 
recruit patients without mentioning the 
terminal illness requirement, and of 
hospices failing to discharge patients 
who had improved or enrolling patients 
who had already been discharged or 
turned away from other hospices. 
Consensus emerged among the panelists 
that more accountability and oversight 
of certification and recertification are 
needed. See, http://www.medpac.gov/ 
transcripts/ 
20081104_Hospice_final_public.pdf and 
http://www.medpac.gov/transcripts/ 
1106–1107MedPAC%20final.pdf. 

We believe that those physicians that 

are certifying a hospice patient’s 
continued eligibility can reasonably be 
expected to synthesize in a few 
sentences the clinical aspects of the 
patient’s condition that support the 
prognosis. We believe that such a 
requirement, as suggested by the expert 
panel and by MedPAC, would 
encourage greater physician engagement 
in the certification and recertification 
process by focusing attention on the 
physician’s responsibility to set out the 
clinical basis for the terminal prognosis 
indicated in the patient’s medical 
record. 

To increase accountability related to 

the physician certification and 
recertification process, we are proposing 
a change to § 418.22. Specifically, we 
propose to add a new paragraph (b)(3) 

to § 418.22 to require that physicians 
that certify or recertify hospice patients 
as being terminally ill include a brief 
narrative explanation of the clinical 
findings that support a life expectancy 
of 6 months or less. This brief narrative 
should be written or typed on the 
certification form itself. We do not 
believe that an attachment should be 
permissible because an attachment 
could easily be prepared by someone 
other than the physician. We seek 
comments on whether this proposed 
requirement would increase physician 
engagement in the certification and 
recertification process. 
C. Proposed Update of Covered Services, 
§ 418.202 

In Part 418, subpart F, we describe 

covered hospice services. In § 418.200, 
Requirements for Coverage, we note that 
covered services must be reasonable and 
necessary for the palliation or 
management of the terminal illness as 
well as related conditions. We also note 
that services provided must be 
consistent with the plan of care. The 
language at § 418.202, Covered services, 
describes specific types of hospices 
services that are covered. Section 
418.202(f) describes the coverage of 
medical appliances and supplies, 
including drugs and biologicals. The 
last sentence of § 418.202(f) states that 
covered ‘‘Medical supplies include 
those that are part of the written plan of 
care.’’ 

The updated CoPs, which were 

effective as of December 2008, require 
that hospices include all comorbidities 
in the plan of care, even if those 
comorbidities are not related to the 
terminal diagnosis. In § 418.54(c)(2) we 
refer to assessing the patient for 
complications and risk factors that affect 
care planning. Comorbidities that are 
unrelated to the terminal illness need to 
be addressed in the comprehensive 
assessment and should be on the plan 
of care, clearly marked as comorbidities 
unrelated to the terminal illness. The 
hospice is not responsible for providing 
care for the unrelated comorbidities. 
Because these unrelated comorbidities 
must be included in the plan of care, 
and the hospice is not responsible for 
providing the care for these unrelated 
comorbidities, we propose revising 
§ 418.202(f) to state that medical 
supplies covered by the Medicare 
hospice benefit include only those that 
are part of the plan of care and that are 
for the palliation or management of the 
terminal illness or related conditions. 

D. Proposed Clarification of Payment 
Procedures for Hospice Care, § 418.302 

Section 1861(dd) of the Act limits 

coverage of and payment for inpatient 
days for hospice patients. There are 
sometimes situations when a hospice 
patient receives inpatient care but is 
unable to return home, even though the 
medical situation no longer warrants 
general impatient care (GIP), or even 
though 5 days of respite have ended. In 
computing the inpatient cap, the 
hospice should only count inpatient 
days in which GIP or respite care is 
provided and billed as GIP or respite 
days. For example, assume a patient 
received 5 days of respite care while a 
caregiver was out of town, but the 
caregiver’s return was delayed for a day 
due to circumstances beyond her 
control. The patient had to remain as an 
inpatient for a 6th day, but was no 
longer eligible for respite care. 
According to § 418.302(e)(5), the 
hospice should switch from billing for 
respite care to billing for routine home 
care on the 6th day. The hospice should 
only count 5 days toward the inpatient 
cap, not 6 days, since only 5 inpatient 
days were provided and billed as respite 
days. 

Because we have received several 

inquiries about how to count inpatient 
days that are provided and billed as 
routine home care, we propose to revise 
§ 418.302(f)(2) to clarify that only 
inpatient days in which GIP or respite 
care is provided and billed are counted 
as inpatient days when computing the 
inpatient cap. 
E. Proposed Clarification of 
Intermediary Determination and Notice 
of Amount of Program Reimbursement, 
§ 405.1803 

Currently, hospices that exceed either 

the inpatient cap or the aggregate cap 
are sent a letter by their contractor 
(regional home health and hospice 
intermediary (RHHI) or fiscal 
intermediary (FI)), detailing the cap 
results, along with a demand for 
repayment. As described in an 
administrative instruction (CR 6400, 
Transmittal 1708, issued April 3, 2009) 
effective July 1, 2009, this letter of 
determination of program 
reimbursement will be sent to every 
hospice provider, regardless of whether 
or not the hospice has exceeded the cap. 
A demand for repayment will be 
included for those hospices which have 
exceeded either cap. If a hospice 
disagrees with the contractor’s cap 
calculations, the hospice has appeal 
rights which are set out at 42 CFR 
§ 418.311 and Part 405, Subpart R. The 
letter of determination of program

reimbursement shall include language 
describing the hospice’s appeal rights. 
We are proposing to clarify the language 
at § 405.1803(a) to note that for the 
purposes of hospice, the determination 
of program reimbursement letter sent by 
the contractors serves as the written 
notice reflecting the intermediary’s 
determination of the total amount of 
reimbursement due the hospice, which 
is commonly called a Notice of Program 
Reimbursement or NPR. Additionally, 
we are proposing to clarify 
§ 405.1803(a)(1)(i) to note that in the 
case of hospice, the reporting period 
covered by the determination of 
program reimbursement letter is the 
hospice cap year and the bases for the 
letter are the cap calculations rather 
than reasonable cost from cost report 
data. 
F. Proposed Technical and Clarifying 
Changes 

In addition to the proposals and 
solicitation of comments discussed 
above, we are proposing to make the 
following technical changes to clarify 
existing regulations text, correct errors 
that we have identified in the 
regulations, remove obsolete cross 
references, or to ensure consistent use of 
terminology in our regulations. 
1. Proposed Clarification of the 
Statutory Basis for Hospice Regulation, 
§ 418.1 

Currently, the statutory basis for the 

hospice regulations is described at 
§ 418.1, and notes that Part 418 
implements section 1861(dd) of the Act. 
The regulation describes section 
1861(dd) of the Act as specifying 
covered hospice services and the 
conditions that a hospice program must 
meet to participate in the Medicare 
program. While that is correct, section 
1861(dd) of the Act also specifies some 
limitations on coverage and payment for 
inpatient hospice care. We propose to 
clarify § 418.1 by adding a sentence 
noting that section 1861(dd) of the Act 
limits coverage and payment for 
inpatient hospice care. 
2. Proposed Update of the Scope of Part, 
§ 418.2 

The current regulations at § 418.2 

(‘‘Scope of part.’’) describe each of the 
subparts in Part 418. Some of these 
subparts have been revised or removed 
with the update of the hospice 
conditions of participation (CoPs) in 
2008. Specifically, subpart B specifies 
the eligibility and election 
requirements, along with the duration of 
benefits. Subparts C and D specify the 
Conditions of Participation, with 
subpart C now entitled ‘‘Patient Care’’ 

rather than ‘‘General Provisions and 
Administration’’, and subpart D now 
entitled ‘‘Organizational Environment’’ 
rather than ‘‘Core Services’’. Subpart E, 
which is currently described as 
specifying reimbursement methods and 
procedures, was removed and reserved 
with the update of the CoPs. Subparts F 
and G relate to payment policy, 
including covered services and hospice 
payment; currently subpart F is 
described in § 418.2 as specifying 
coinsurance amounts. Finally, subpart H 
specifies coinsurance amounts 
applicable to hospice care, rather than 
subpart F as the regulation currently 
reads. Accordingly, we propose to 
update section § 418.2 to reflect the 
current organization and scope of Part 
418. 
3. Proposed Revision of Hospice Aide 
and Homemaker Services, § 418.76 

We are proposing a technical 

correction at § 418.76(f)(1) to clarify that 
home health agencies that have been 
found out of compliance with 
paragraphs (a) or (b) of § 484.36, 
regarding home health aide 
qualifications, are prohibited from 
providing hospice aide training. The 
word ‘‘out’’ was inadvertently omitted 
from the regulation text in the June 5, 
2008 hospice final rule. 
4. Proposed Clarification of Hospice 
Multiple Location, § 418.100 

For the sake of clarity, we propose to 

delete the word ‘‘that’’ from 
§ 418.100(f)(1)(iii), regarding multiple 
locations. The revised element would 
require that the lines of authority and 
professional and administrative control 
must be clearly delineated in the 
hospice’s organizational structure and 
in practice, and must be traced to the 
location issued the certification number. 
5. Proposed Revision to Short Term 
Inpatient Care, § 418.108 

We propose to correct in 

§ 418.108(b)(1)(ii) an erroneous 
reference to § 418.110(f), Patient rooms. 
This section, which addresses facilities 
that are considered acceptable for the 
provision of respite care to hospice 
patients, was intended to reference the 
standard at § 418.110(e), Patient areas. 
The published reference to standard (f) 
was a typographic error, and we propose 
to correct it by changing the reference to 
standard (e). 
6. Proposed Clarification of the 
Requirements for Coverage, § 418.200 

Section 418.200 describes the 

requirements for coverage for Medicare 
hospice services, and references 
§ 418.58 (‘‘Conditions of Participation

plan of care’’). This cross reference is no 
longer accurate as § 418.58 was updated 
with the publication of the new CoPs in 
2008. We propose to detail the 
requirements for coverage related to the 
plan of care rather than cross refer to the 
CoPs regulations. This revision would 
avoid the need to make updates to this 
section each time the CoPs are changed. 
The statute specifies requirements for 

hospice coverage in section 
1814(a)(7)(A) through (C) of the Act. The 
Act requires that the hospice medical 
director and the patient’s attending 
physician certify the terminal illness for 
the initial period of hospice care and 
that the medical director recertify the 
terminal illness for each subsequent 
benefit period. Additionally, the Act 
requires that a plan of care exist before 
care is provided; that the plan of care be 
reviewed periodically by the attending 
physician, the medical director, and the 
interdisciplinary group; and that care be 
provided in accordance with the plan of 
care. We propose to clarify § 418.200 to 
incorporate these requirements for 
coverage, rather than cross reference 
CoP requirements in CoP regulations. 
7. Proposed Incorporation of the Term 
‘‘Hospice Aide,’’ § 418.202, § 418.204, 
and § 418.302 

Over the last several years, we have 

worked with the industry to update the 
hospice CoPs. These efforts culminated 
in publication of a final rule in 2008, 
which was effective December 2, 2008. 
The revised CoPs redesignated the 
‘‘home health aide’’ who works in 
hospice as a ‘‘hospice aide’’. We 
propose to revise § 418.202(g), 
§ 418.204(a), and § 418.302 to include 
the new terminology. 
8. Proposed Clarification of 
Administrative Appeals, § 418.311 

A hospice that does not believe its 

payments have been properly 
determined may request a review from 
the intermediary or from the Provider 
Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB), 
depending on the amount in 
controversy. Section 418.311 details the 
procedures for appealing a payment 
decision and also refers to Part 405, 
Subpart R. 

We propose to clarify the last 

sentence of this section, which currently 
notes that ‘‘the methods and standards 
for the calculation of the payment rates 
by CMS are not subject to appeal.’’ The 
payment rates referred to are the 
national rates which are set by statute, 
and updated according to the statute 
using the hospital market basket (unless 
Congress has instructed us to update the 
rates differently). To ensure better 
understanding of what is not subject to

to provide that methods and standards 
for the calculation of the statutorily 
defined payment rates by CMS are not 
subject to appeal. 
III. Request for Comments on Other 
Policy Issues 
A. Recertification Visits, § 418.22 

As noted earlier, MedPAC convened 

an expert panel from the hospice 
industry in late 2008. That panel noted 
that some hospices are enrolling and 
recertifying patients who are not eligible 
for hospice care under the Medicare 
benefit, and consensus emerged that 
greater accountability and oversight are 
needed in the certification and 
recertification process. To further 
increase accountability in the 
recertification process, several of the 
panelists suggested to MedPAC that an 
additional policy change be made to the 
recertification process. Several panelists 
supported a requirement that a hospice 
physician or advanced practice nurse 
visit the patient at the time of the 180- 
day recertification to assess continued 
eligibility, and at every certification 
thereafter. MedPAC recommended that 
the physician or advanced practice 
nurse be required to attest that the visit 
took place. See, http:// 
www.medpac.gov/transcripts/ 
20081104_Hospice_final_public.pdf and 
http://www.medpac.gov/transcripts/ 
1106-1107MedPAC%20final.pdf. 

At this time, we are not proposing any 

policy change requiring visits by 
physicians or advanced practice nurses 
in order to recertify patients. We note 
that the statute requires a physician to 
certify and recertify terminal illness for 
hospice patients, and specifically 
precludes nurse practitioners from 
doing so at 1814(a)(7)(A) of the Act. A 
recertification visit to a hospice patient 
by a nurse practitioner would not 
relieve the physician of his or her legal 
responsibility to recertify the terminal 
illness of such hospice patient. The 
physician is ultimately responsible for 
the recertification determination. 
However, the visit, if performed by a 
nurse practitioner, could potentially 
serve as an additional, objective source 
of information for the physician in the 
recertification of terminal illness 
decision. We are also considering other 
options related to a nurse practitioner 
making recertification visits. For 
example, a nurse practitioner who is 
involved in a patient’s day-to-day care 
may not be as objective in assessing 
eligibility for recertification as a nurse 
practitioner who is not caring for that 
patient regularly. One option to better 
ensure that a nurse practitioner visit 

results in additional, objective clinical 
assessment of the patient’s condition 
might be to require that such nurse 
practitioner not be involved in the 
hospice patient’s day-to-day care. Also, 
there are different possible approaches 
regarding the timeframe for making 
visits. Visits by a physician or nurse 
practitioner could be made within a 
timeframe close to the recertification 
deadline, such as the 2-week period 
centered around the recertification date, 
thereby allowing a window of time 
surrounding the recertification 
timeframe for a visit to occur. 

While we are not proposing a policy 

change regarding recertification visits at 
this time, we are soliciting comments on 
the suggestion to require physician or 
nurse practitioner visits for hospice 
recertifications at or around 180 days 
and for every benefit period thereafter. 
We are seeking comments on all aspects 
of this suggestion, including practical 
issues of implementation. We will 
analyze and consider the comments 
received in possible future policy 
development. 
B. Hospice Aggregate Cap Calculation 
As described in section 1814(i)(2)(A) 

through (C) of the Act, when the 
Medicare hospice benefit was 
implemented, the Congress included an 
aggregate cap on hospice payments. The 
hospice aggregate cap limits the total 
aggregate payment any individual 
hospice can receive in a year. The 
Congress stipulated that a ‘‘cap amount’’ 
be computed each year. The cap amount 
was set at $6,500 per beneficiary when 
first enacted in 1983 and is adjusted 
annually by the change in the medical 
care expenditure category of the 
consumer price index for urban 
consumers from March 1984 to March of 
the cap year. The cap year is defined as 
the period from November 1st to 
October 31st, and was set in place in the 
December 16, 1983 hospice final rule 
(48 FR 56022). This timeframe was 
chosen as the cap year since the 
Medicare hospice program began on 
November 1, 1983 (48 FR 56022). For 
the 2008 cap year, the cap amount was 
$22,386.15 per beneficiary. This cap 
amount is multiplied by the number of 
Medicare beneficiaries who received 
hospice care in a particular hospice 
during the year, resulting in its hospice 
aggregate cap, which is the allowable 
amount of total Medicare payments that 
hospice can receive for that cap year. A 
hospice’s total reimbursement for the 
cap year cannot exceed the hospice 
aggregate cap. If its hospice aggregate 
cap is exceeded, then the hospice must 
repay the excess back to Medicare.

Using the most recent (2008) payment 

rates before wage adjustment, the 2008 
cap amount ($22,386.15) is roughly 
equal to the cost of providing routine 
home care for 166 days. Because the 
hospice aggregate cap is computed in 
the aggregate for the entire hospice, 
rather than on a per beneficiary basis, 
hospices that admit a mix of short-stay 
and long stay Medicare beneficiaries 
will rarely exceed the cap. On average, 
lower expenditures made on behalf of 
Medicare beneficiaries with shorter 
hospice stays offset the expenditures 
made on behalf of Medicare 
beneficiaries with longer stays such that 
in the aggregate, the majority of 
hospices do not exceed the calculated 
aggregate cap. 

Until recently, hospices rarely 
exceeded the aggregate cap. The 
Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) found that between 1999 and 
2002, less than 2 percent of hospices 
exceeded the aggregate cap [United 
States Government Accountability 
Office, ‘‘Medicare Hospice Care. 
Modifications to Payment Methodology 
May Be Warranted’’. October 2004, 
Washington, DC. p. 18]. MedPAC 
reported that the number of hospices 
that exceeded the aggregate cap has 
grown steadily between 2002 and 2005, 
but remains just under 8 percent as of 
2005 [Medicare Payment Advisory 
Commission, ‘‘Report to the Congress: 
Reforming the Delivery System’’. June 
2008. Washington, DC. p. 212.]. We do 
not believe that hospices are exceeding 
the aggregate cap due to our 
intermediaries’ method of calculating 
the aggregate cap. Rather, MedPAC’s 
analyses suggest that certain hospices 
exceed the aggregate cap due to 
‘‘significantly longer lengths of stay’’ 
than hospices that do not exceed the cap 
[MedPAC, p. 214–15]. MedPAC suggests 
that longer average lengths of stay at 
certain hospices could be due, in part, 
to a change in their patient case-mix 
that has brought in more patients with 
less predictable disease trajectories 
[MedPAC, p. 213–14]. However, patient 
case mix was not found to account for 
all of the discrepancy in length of stay 
[MedPAC, p. 214–15]. MedPAC also 
found that for-profit ownership, smaller 
patient loads, and being a freestanding 
facility were correlated with longer 
lengths of stay and the consequent 
likelihood of exceeding the aggregate 
cap [MedPAC, p. 212–215]. 

As stated above, in our current 
hospice aggregate cap calculation 
methodology, the intermediary 
calculates each hospice’s aggregate cap 
amount by multiplying the per- 
beneficiary cap amount by the number 
of Medicare beneficiaries counted in

each cap year. Patients who receive 
hospice care in more than one cap year 
are counted so that, in the aggregate, the 
‘‘number of Medicare beneficiaries’’ for 
each year is reduced to reflect the 
proportion of time patients receive in 
other years. Hospices are currently 
required to submit a report of their 
Medicare beneficiary unduplicated 
census to their intermediary within 30 
days of the end of the cap year. Our 
current methodology also apportions the 
beneficiary across multiple hospices if 
the beneficiary receives care from more 
than one hospice during the cap year, 
with the proportional shares summing 
to 1. The intermediary reduces each 
hospice’s Medicare beneficiary count by 
that fraction which represents 
proportional days of care the beneficiary 
received in another hospice during the 
year, with all the proportional shares 
summing to 1. 

In counting the Medicare beneficiaries 

for the unduplicated census report, we 
instruct hospices to use a slightly 
different timeframe from the cap year 
used to count payments. When 
determining a hospice’s expenditures 
during a cap year, the intermediary 
sums all claims submitted by the 
hospice for services performed during 
the cap year, which begins on November 
1st of each year and ends on the October 
31st of the following year. However, we 
instruct hospices to include those 
beneficiaries who elect the benefit 
between September 28th of each year 
and September 27th of the following 
year, rather than following the 
November 1st to October 31st cap year. 
CMS (then HCFA) used mean length of 
stay from demonstration project data to 
determine the point at which to include 
a beneficiary in calculating the hospice 
cap. Using half of the mean length of 
stay, or 70 days/2 = 35 days, CMS 
implemented a timeframe for counting 
beneficiaries that began less than 35 
days from the end of the cap year. 
Therefore, the timeframe for counting 
beneficiaries was set as September 28th 
through September 27th (48 FR 56022). 
This method of reducing the number of 
Medicare beneficiaries counted in a cap 
year to reflect time spent in other years 
was implemented because it allows for 
counting the beneficiary in the reporting 
period where he or she used most of the 
days of covered hospice care (48 FR 
38158). We believe that the regulation 
complies with the statutory 
requirements without being unduly 
burdensome. This approach has the 
major advantage of allowing each 
hospice to estimate its aggregate cap 
calculation within a short period of time 
after the close of a cap year. While we

believe that the current hospice 
aggregate cap methodology equitably 
meets the statutory requirements for 
calculating the hospice aggregate cap set 
out at section 1814(i)(2) of the Act, the 
availability of more sophisticated 
databases and data systems provides us 
with an opportunity to incorporate 
efficiencies in the cap calculation 
process. The lack of sophisticated data 
systems in place in the 1980’s limited 
our options for how to efficiently 
compute the hospice aggregate cap. In 
the 1980’s access to claims data was 
very slow, and searchable claims 
databases were virtually non-existent. 
While the current system still has 
limitations, the advancement of 
technology has brought with it provider 
access to benefit period information in 
the Common Working File (CWF), 
which was created in the 1990’s, and 
faster processing speeds, which allow 
contractors and hospices easier access to 
claims information for hospice aggregate 
cap calculation purposes. Therefore, we 
are now able to consider more efficient 
approaches to calculating the aggregate 
cap. 

The time required for intermediaries 

to compute each hospice’s aggregate cap 
and send demand letters when 
overpayments exist delays our recovery 
of those overpayments and may also 
contribute to some hospices exceeding 
the cap in subsequent years. Hospices 
have described receiving demands for 
cap overpayments more than a year after 
the end of the cap year, and have 
expressed concern that they are not 
timely notified about their cap 
overpayments. Hospices which don’t 
closely monitor compliance with their 
aggregate cap may not have anticipated 
an overpayment, and the lag in 
notification may contribute to the risk of 
a hospice exceeding its aggregate cap in 
the subsequent year. More timely 
notification of overpayments would 
enable hospices to more quickly review 
their admissions practices, and make 
necessary changes to ensure that all 
their patients meet the eligibility 
requirements for hospice care. 

We are exploring a number of 
different hospice aggregate cap 
implementation methodology changes 
to address these issues, and to take 
advantage of the technological 
efficiencies available. Specifically, we 
are exploring enhancements to our 
current methodology which will 
improve the timeliness of hospices’ 
notification of cap overpayments, will 
enable such overpayments to be 
collected more quickly, and which will 
encourage hospices to be more 
proactively involved in managing their 
admissions practices such that they do 

not exceed their hospice aggregate cap. 
We are considering several changes to 
the annual hospice aggregate cap 
calculation implementation 
methodology which could help hospices 
avoid exceeding the aggregate cap. 

If a beneficiary receives hospice care 
for an extended period of time, or elects 
hospice toward the end of a cap year, he 
or she is more likely to cross into more 
than 1 cap year, or to receive care from 
more than 1 hospice. If we made a 
mathematically precise determination of 
the proportion of time each patient 
spent in each cap year at each hospice 
from which they received care, in order 
for a given cap year report to be final, 
adjustments to that cap year report 
would have to continue until the 
beneficiary actually died. Only then 
could a final determination of the 
aggregate cap be made for a given year 
for each hospice that had treated the 
beneficiary. Such an approach could be 
viewed as particularly burdensome to 
the hospice as a hospice’s financial 
system would likely need to be able to 
continually react to subsequent hospice 
aggregate cap calculations, readjusting 
payments to Medicare to account for an 
overpayment amount that is ever- 
changing, that is, until the beneficiary 
dies. 

A variation of this approach would 

approaches to counting beneficiaries, 
another option is to require hospices to 
compute their own hospice aggregate 
cap and submit a certified cap report to 
their contractors, along with any 
overpayment, 7 months after the end of 
the cap year. The information used for 
the hospice aggregate cap calculation 
originates with hospices, and is 
available to them through the CWF or 
through their own accounting records. 
Requiring hospices to compute and 
report their own hospice aggregate cap 
would result in hospices being proactive 
in managing their cap calculations. In 

allow apportioning of beneficiaries who 
receive care in more than 1 cap period 
over 2 consecutive years. This approach 
would minimize, but not completely 
eliminate, the adjustments required to 
prior year cap calculations. This method 
still has the effect of delaying the final 
cap determination. However, it raises 
questions about scenarios where a 
beneficiary received hospice care in his 
first and second cap year, either revoked 
or was discharged from the benefit, and 
returned to a different hospice at a 
much later date, such as in the third cap 
year. We would like public input from 
hospices, patient groups, other provider 
types, academics, and members of the 
general public on how to best handle 
this or similar scenarios. 

Besides considering different

this approach, contractors would still

We are soliciting comments on these 
and other policy options in an effort to 
gather more information on this issue, 
and any other possible underlying 
issues that may exist. 
C. Hospice Payment Reform 

Since the inception of the hospice 
benefit in 1983, the amount that the 
Medicare program has spent on this 
benefit has grown considerably. The 
number of unduplicated hospice 
Medicare beneficiaries has increased 
from 401,140 in FY 1998 to 986,435 in 
FY 2007, which represents a 146 
percent increase. Additionally, at the 
inception of the benefit, most hospice 
patients elected hospice care due to 
terminal cancer. The profile of the 
hospice patient has changed in recent 
years such that hospices now provide 
care to beneficiaries with a wide range 
of terminal conditions. In calendar year 
(CY) 1998, 54 percent of hospice 
patients had terminal cancer diagnoses. 
In CY 2007, only 28 percent of hospice 
patients had terminal cancer diagnoses. 
With the diversity of diagnoses, hospice 
stays began to increase. The national 
average length of stay for patients in 
hospice has risen from 48 days per 
patient in CY 1998 to 73 days per 
patient in CY 2006. Additionally, long 
hospice stays have grown even longer 
by about 50 percent. Between 2000 and 
2005, hospices in the 90th percentile for 
average length of stay increased their 
average length of stay from 144 to 212 
days. 

MedPAC has performed extensive 

analysis of the hospice benefit over the 
past few years, and has recommended 
that CMS reform the hospice payment 
structure to ensure greater 
accountability in the hospice benefit. 
MedPAC believes that the current 
hospice payment system contains 
incentives that make long hospice stays 
more profitable, which may result in 
misuse of the benefit. 

Medicare spending for hospice is 
rapidly growing, more than tripling 
between 2000 and 2007. In fiscal year 
(FY) 1998, expenditures for the 
Medicare hospice benefit were $2.2 
billion, while in FY 2007, expenditures 
for the Medicare hospice benefit were 
$10.6 billion, more than the Medicare 
program spends on inpatient 
rehabilitation hospitals, critical access 
hospitals, long term care hospitals, or 
psychiatric hospitals. Medicare hospice 
spending is expected to more than 
double in the next 10 years and will 
account for roughly 2.3 percent of 
overall Medicare spending in FY 2009.

The number of hospice agencies has 

also grown by over 70 percent since 
1997. The growth is overwhelmingly in 
the for-profit category. In 1997, there 
were 1,834 hospices, about 20 percent of 
which were for-profit and 80 percent 
were non-profit. In 2008, there were 
over 3,200 hospices, and 51 percent of 
these are for-profit entities. Since 2000, 
nearly all hospices newly participating 
in Medicare are for-profit entities. 
MedPAC reports that the newly 
participating hospices have margins five 
to six times higher than more 
established hospices. MedPAC estimates 
that, on average, hospice Medicare 
margins were approximately 3.4 percent 
in 2005. However, the for-profit 
hospices are estimated to have margins 
ranging from 15.9 percent in 2003 to 
11.8 percent in 2005. 

In their analyses of the hospice 

benefit in their June 2008 ‘‘Report to the 
Congress,’’ MedPAC found that hospice 
care is more costly at the beginning and 
end of an episode of hospice care, 
because of the intensity of services 
provided during those times. Hospices 
provide more visits to a patient right 
after a patient elects hospice and in the 
time shortly before death, than they 
provide during the middle of the 
episode. In its November 6, 2008 public 
meeting, MedPAC suggested that 
payments to hospices should decline as 
the beneficiary’s length of stay 
increases, thus better reflecting intensity 
and frequency of the hospice services 
provided over the course of treatment. 
MedPAC also suggested that payment to 
hospices should increase during the 
period just prior to the patient’s death 
to reflect the higher resource usage 
during this time [see, http:// 
www.medpac.gov/transcripts/ 
20081104_Hospice_final_public.pdf and 
http://www.medpac.gov/transcripts/ 
1106-1107MedPAC%20final.pdf.]. 
MedPAC believes this payment 
structure would better reflect hospice 
patient resource usage and hospice 
costs, and would encourage hospices to 
admit patients at the time in their 
illness which provides the most benefit 
to the patient. 

We are soliciting comments regarding 
MedPAC’s suggestions on reforming the 
hospice payment system, as well as 
broader comments and suggestions 
regarding hospice payment reform. We 
note that MedPAC’s suggested payment 
reforms would require Congressional 
action to change the statute. 
IV. Update on Additional Hospice Data 
Collection 

Over the past several years MedPAC, 
the GAO, and the Office of the Inspector 
General have all recommended that 

CMS collect more comprehensive data 
in order to better evaluate trends in 
utilization of the Medicare hospice 
benefit. We have been phasing in this 
process to collect more comprehensive 
data on hospice claims. We also began 
collecting additional data on hospice 
claims beginning in January 2007 
through an administrative instruction 
(CR 5245, Transmittal 1011, issued July 
28, 2006), when we started required 
reporting of a HCPCS code on the claim 
to describe the location where services 
were provided (Phase 1). In addition, we 
issued an administrative instruction (CR 
5567, Transmittal 1494, issued April 29, 
2008) requiring Medicare hospices to 
provide detail on their claims about the 
number of physician, nurse, aide, and 
social worker visits provided to 
beneficiaries. The start date of this 
mandatory CR 5567 reporting 
requirement was July 2008 (Phase 2). 

On several occasions, industry 

representatives have communicated to 
CMS that the newly required claims 
information was not comprehensive 
enough to accurately reflect hospice 
care. A major concern was that CMS 
was not requiring reporting of the visit 
intensity. As a result of these concerns, 
we committed to working with the 
industry to expand the data collection 
requirements. In October 2008, we 
solicited comments via a posting on 
CMS’ hospice center Web site (http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/center/hospice.asp) 
on an approach to collecting additional 
data about hospice resource use. We 
asked about data collection using 
hospice claims, along with data 
collection using hospice cost reports. 
This proposed rule provides an update 
on the additional data collection which 
is in process. 

Based on the feedback received from 
our October 2008 web posting, we have 
revised our plans for Phase 3 of the 
claims data collection. Those plans are 
currently being developed and will be 
implemented through an administrative 
instruction. 

Phase 3 will involve collecting new 
data on hospice claims. In addition to 
the existing visit reporting requirement, 
we anticipate requiring visit time 
reporting in 15 minute increments for 
nurses, social workers, and aides. We 
anticipate requiring visit and visit time 
reporting in 15 minute increments from 
physical therapists, occupational 
therapists, and speech language 
therapists. We also anticipate requiring 
reporting of some social worker phone 
calls and their associated time, within 
certain limits. Specifically, we 
anticipate requiring the reporting of 
social worker calls that are necessary for 
the palliation and management of the

terminal illness and related conditions 
as described in the patient’s plan of care 
(for example, counseling, speaking with 
a patient’s family, or arranging for a 
placement). Furthermore, we anticipate 
that only social worker phone calls 
related to providing and/or coordinating 
care to the patient and family, and 
documented as such in the clinical 
records, would be reported. We 
anticipate that visit and time data 
collection for respite and general 
inpatient care provided by non-hospice 
staff in contract facilities would be 
exempt from the reporting requirement. 
Finally, we anticipate that travel time, 
documentation time, and 
interdisciplinary group time would not 
be included in the time reporting. These 
changes would necessitate line-item 
billing on hospice claims. 

While other Medicare provider types 

(for example, home health agencies) 
have had to provide similar information 
on their claims, hospices have 
historically not had been required to 
provide this information. This 
additional data collection would bring 
the requirements for hospice claims 
more in line with the claim 
requirements of other Medicare benefits, 
and provide valuable information about 
services provided to Medicare 
beneficiaries. 

We also note that this additional data 

collection uses existing revenue codes 
and existing UB–04 and 837I claim 
forms. Those claims forms were 
previously approved by the OMB under 
control number #0938–0997. 

As stated above, these changes will be 

forthcoming through an administrative 
instruction, and are not to be considered 
as proposals in this rule; that instruction 
will be issued some time this spring or 
summer. 

Additionally, we are developing plans 

to revise the hospice cost reports to 
include additional sources of revenue, 
and to gather more detailed data on 
services provided by volunteers, by 
chaplains, by counselors, and by 
pharmacists. We will continue to work 
with the industry to seek out the best 
approach to these and any other changes 
we may make in order to collect useful 
information on hospice services. 
V. Collection of Information 
Requirements 

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, we are required to provide 60- 
day notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comment before a 
collection of information requirement is 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. In order to fairly evaluate 
whether an information collection

should be approved by OMB, section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork

solicit comment on the following issues: 

• The need for the information 

collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency.

information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 

We are soliciting public comment on 

the issue for the following section of 
this document that contains information 
collection requirements. 

Section 418.22 Certification of 

terminal illness. 

Section 418.22 requires the physician 
to include on or with the certification a 
brief narrative explanation of the 
clinical findings that support a life 
expectancy of 6 months or less. 

The burden associated with this 

requirement is the time and effort put 
forth by the physician to include a brief 
narrative explanation of the clinical 
findings that support a life expectancy 
of 6 months or less. We estimate it 
would take a physician 5 minutes to 
meet this requirement. We also estimate 
that a narrative would be provided on 
1,534,388 certifications or 
recertifications annually. Therefore, the 
total annual burden associated with this 
requirement is 127,866 hours. The 
current requirements for § 418.22 are 
approved under OMB# 0938–0302 with 
an expiration date of 8/31/2009. We will 
revise the currently approved PRA 
package to reflect any changes in 
burden.

collection and recordkeeping 
requirements, please do either of the

VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Overall Impact 

We have examined the impacts of this 

rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 (September 1993, Regulatory 
Planning and Review), the Regulatory 

Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 
1980, Pub. L. 96–354), section 1102(b) of 
the Social Security Act, the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4), Executive Order 13132 on 
Federalism, and the Congressional 
Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)). We 
estimated the impact on hospices, as a 
result of the changes to the proposed FY 
2010 hospice wage index and of 
reducing the BNAF by 75 percent. 

As discussed previously, the 

methodology for computing the hospice 
wage index was determined through a 
negotiated rulemaking committee and 
implemented in the August 8, 1997 
hospice wage index final rule (62 FR 
42860). The BNAF, which was 
implemented in the August 8, 1997 rule, 
is being phased out. This rule proposes 
updates to the hospice wage index in 
accordance with the August 8, 2008 FY 
2009 Hospice Wage Index final rule (73 
FR 46464), which originally 
implemented a 75 percent reduced 
BNAF for FY 2010 as the second year 
of a 3-year phase-out of the BNAF. 

Executive Order 12866 directs 

agencies to assess all costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
if regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits including potential 
economic, environmental, public health 
and safety effects, distributive impacts, 
and equity. A regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA) must be prepared for major rules 
with economically significant effects 
($100 million or more in any 1 year). We 
have determined that this proposed rule 
is an economically significant rule 
under this Executive Order. 

Column 4 of Table 1 shows the 
combined effects of the 75 percent 
reduction in the BNAF and of the 
updated wage data, comparing 
estimated payments for FY 2010 to 
estimated payments for FY 2009. In 
keeping with the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) 
mentioned earlier in this proposed rule, 
the FY 2009 payments used for 
comparison have a full (unreduced) 
BNAF applied. We estimate that the 
total hospice payments for FY 2010 will 
decrease by $340 million as a result of 
the application of the 75 percent 
reduction in the BNAF and the updated 
wage data. This estimate does not take 
into account any hospital market basket 
update, which is currently estimated to 
be about 2.1 percent for FY 2010. The 
final hospital market basket update will 
not be available until sometime later 
this year and will be communicated 
through an administrative instruction. 
The effect of an estimated 2.1 percent 
hospital market basket update on 
payments to hospices is approximately

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  78 / Friday,  April  24,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

$240 million. Taking into account an 
estimated 2.1 percent hospital market 
basket update, in addition to the 75 
percent reduction in the BNAF and the 
updated wage data, it is estimated that 
hospice payments would decrease by 
$100 million in FY 2010 ($340 million 
¥ $240 million = $100 million). The 
percent change in payments to hospices 
due to the combined effects of the 75 
percent reduction in the BNAF, the 
updated wage data, and the estimated 
hospital market basket update of 2.1 
percent is reflected in column 5 of the 
impact table (Table 1). 

The RFA requires agencies to analyze 

options for regulatory relief of small 
businesses if a rule has a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The majority of hospices and 
most other providers and suppliers are 
small entities, either by nonprofit status 
or by having revenues of less than $7 
million to $34.5 million in any 1 year 
(for details, see http://www.sba.gov/ 
contractingopportunities/officials/size/ 
index.html). While the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) does not define a 
size threshold in terms of annual 
revenues for hospices, they do define 
one for home health agencies ($13.5 
million; see http://www.sba.gov/idc/ 
groups/public/documents/ 
sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf). 
For the purposes of this proposed rule, 
because the hospice benefit is a home- 
based benefit, we are applying the SBA 
definition of ‘‘small’’ for home health 
agencies to hospices; we will use this 
definition of ‘‘small’’ in determining if 
this proposed rule has a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities (for example, hospices). Using 
2007 claims data, we estimate that 96 
percent of hospices have revenues 
below $13.5 million. 

As indicated in Table 1 below, there 

are 3,206 hospices as of January 29, 
2009. Approximately 49.8 percent of 
Medicare certified hospices are 
identified as voluntary or government 
agencies and, therefore, are considered 
small entities. Most of these and most of 
the remainder are also small hospice 
entities because, as noted above, their 
revenues fall below the SBA size 
thresholds. 

We note that the hospice wage index 
methodology was previously guided by 
consensus, through a negotiated 
rulemaking committee that included 
representatives of national hospice 
associations, rural, urban, large and 
small hospices, multi-site hospices, and 
consumer groups. Based on all of the 
options considered, the committee 
agreed on the methodology described in 
the committee statement, and after 
notice and comment, it was adopted 

into regulation in the August 8, 1997 
final rule. In developing the process for 
updating the hospice wage index in the 
1997 final rule, we considered the 
impact of this methodology on small 
hospice entities and attempted to 
mitigate any potential negative effects. 
Small hospice entities are more likely to 
be in rural areas, which are less affected 
by the BNAF reduction than entities in 
urban areas. Generally, hospices in rural 
areas are protected by the hospice floor 
adjustment, which mitigates the effect of 
the BNAF reduction. 

The effects of this rule on hospices are 

shown in Table 1. Overall, Medicare 
payments to all hospices will decrease 
by an estimated 3.2 percent, reflecting 
the combined effects of the 75 percent 
reduction in the BNAF and the updated 
wage data. However, when we consider 
the combined effects of the 75 percent 
reduction to the BNAF and the updated 
wage data on small or medium sized 
hospices, as defined by routine home 
care days rather than by the SBA 
definition, the effect is –2.9 percent. 
Furthermore, when including the 
estimated hospital market basket update 
of 2.1 percent into these estimates, the 
combined effects on Medicare payment 
to all hospices would result in an 
estimated decrease of approximately 1.1 
percent. For small to medium hospices 
(as defined by routine home care days), 
the effects on revenue when accounting 
for the updated wage data, the 75 
percent BNAF reduction, and the 
estimated hospital market basket update 
are –0.8 percent and –0.9 percent, 
respectively. Overall average hospice 
revenue effects will be slightly less than 
these estimates since according the 
National Hospice and Palliative Care 
Organization, about 16 percent of 
hospice patients are non-Medicare. HHS 
practice in interpreting the RFA is to 
consider effects economically 
‘‘significant’’ only if they reach a 
threshold of 3 to 5 percent or more of 
total revenue or total costs. As noted 
above, the combined effect of only the 
updated wage data and the 75 percent 
reduced BNAF for all hospices (large 
and small) is 3.2 percent. Since, by 
SBA’s definition of ‘‘small’’ (when 
applied to hospices), nearly all hospices 
are considered to be small entities, the 
combined effect of only the updated 
wage data and the 75 percent reduced 
BNAF (3.2 percent) exceeds HHS’ 3.0 
percent minimum threshold. However, 
HHS’ practice in determining 
‘‘significant economic impact’’ has 
considered either total revenue or total 
costs. Total hospice revenues include 
the effect of the market basket update. 
When we consider the combined effect

of the updated wage data, the 75 percent 
BNAF reduction, and the estimated 2.1 
percent 2009 market basket update, the 
overall impact is a decrease in hospice 
payments of 1.1 percent for FY 2010. 
Therefore, the Secretary has determined 
that this proposed rule does not create 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 

In the August 8, 2008 FY 2009 

Hospice Wage Index final rule, we 
implemented a 3-year phase-out of the 
BNAF. The BNAF was to be reduced by 
25 percent in FY 2009, by an additional 
50 percent for a total of 75 percent in 
FY 2010, and by a final 25 percent, for 
complete elimination in FY 2011. This 
phased approach to eliminating the 
BNAF was estimated to reduce 
payments by 1.1 percent in FY 2009, an 
additional 2 percent in FY 2010, and an 
additional 1 percent in FY 2011. As 
originally implemented, the phase out 
of the BNAF would not have a 
significant economic impact on small 
entities because in any of the 3 fiscal 
years, the estimated reduction in 
payments was less than 3 percent. 
However, on February 17, 2009, ARRA 
eliminated the phase-out for FY 2009, 
but left intact the BNAF reductions 
implemented in the August 8, 2008 FY 
2009 Hospice Wage Index final rule for 
FY 2010 and FY 2011. While we are still 
using a phased approach to eliminating 
the BNAF, the phase-out is now 
occurring over 2 years rather than over 
3 years. There is a greater impact on 
hospices in FY 2010 since hospices 
move from having a full (unreduced) 
BNAF in FY 2009 to a 75 percent 
reduced BNAF in FY 2010. 

The hospice floor calculation gives 
some relief to hospices with pre-floor, 
pre-reclassified wage index values less 
than 0.8. Hospices which are eligible for 
the hospice floor calculation will either 
be totally unaffected by the BNAF 
phase-out, or will be less affected by the 
phase-out. As noted in section II.A.4 of 
this proposed rule, there are just over 
100 hospices that will be totally 
unaffected by the BNAF phase-out and 
just over 300 hospices which will be 
less affected by the BNAF phase-out, 
due to the hospice floor calculation. 
Hospices do not need to take any 
action for the BNAF phase-out to be 
effective. The FY 2010 wage index 
includes the 75 percent reduced BNAF, 
and that wage index is applied to 
hospice payments automatically by the 
claims processing contractors, thereby 
relieving hospices of the responsibility

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  78 / Friday,  April  24,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

18925 

implemented in the August 8, 2008 FY 
2009 Hospice Wage Index final rule. 
With the passage of ARRA, hospices 
have been given additional time to 
prepare for the FY 2010 BNAF 
reduction, and the ultimate elimination 
of the BNAF in FY 2011. Second, we 
continue to publicize information about 
the BNAF phase-out on our hospice 
Web site. The hospice center page at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/center/ 
hospice.asp provides information about 
the BNAF phase-out and links to related 
documents. Third, we are publicizing 
the information about the BNAF phase- 
out through other avenues (for example, 
through Open Door Forums). All of 
these efforts should provide information 
to hospices to help them prepare for the 
BNAF phase-out. 

In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 

requires us to prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis if a rule may have a 
significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. This analysis must conform to 
the provisions of section 603 of the 
RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of 
the Act, we define a small rural hospital 
as a hospital that is located outside a 
metropolitan statistical area and has 
fewer than 100 beds. Therefore, the 
Secretary has determined that this 
proposed rule will not have a significant 
impact on the operations of a substantial 
number of small rural hospitals. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 

Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
also requires that agencies assess 
anticipated costs and benefits before 
issuing any rule whose mandates 
require spending in any 1 year of about 
$100 million or more in 1995 dollars, 
updated for inflation. That threshold is 
currently approximately $133 million in 

2009. This proposed rule is not 
anticipated to have an effect on State, 
local, or tribal governments or on the 
private sector of $133 million or more. 

Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule (and subsequent final 
rule) that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
We have reviewed this proposed rule 
under the threshold criteria of Executive 
Order 13132, Federalism, and have 
determined that it will not have an 
impact on the rights, roles, and 
responsibilities of State, local, or tribal 
governments. 
B. Anticipated Effects 

This section discusses the impact of 

the projected effects of the proposed 
hospice wage index, including the 
effects of an estimated 2.1 percent 
hospital market basket update that will 
be communicated separately through an 
administrative instruction. The 
proposed provisions include continuing 
to use the CBSA-based pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index as a 
basis for the hospice wage index and 
continuing to use the same policies for 
treatment of areas (rural and urban) 
without hospital wage data. In FY 2010, 
we are continuing with the 75 percent 
reduction of the BNAF which, in the 
August 8, 2008 FY 2009 Hospice Wage 
Index final rule (73 FR 46464), was 
originally implemented as the second 
year of a 3-year phase-out of the BNAF. 
The proposed FY 2010 hospice wage 
index is based upon the 2009 pre-floor, 
pre-reclassified hospital wage index and 
the most complete claims data available 

(FY 2007) with a 75 percent reduction 
in the BNAF. 

For the purposes of our impacts, our 

baseline is estimated FY 2009 payments 
(without any BNAF reduction) using the 
2008 pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index. Our first comparison 
(column 3, Table 1) compares our 
baseline to estimated FY 2010 payments 
(holding payment rates constant) using 
the updated wage data (2009 pre-floor, 
pre-reclassified hospital wage index). 
Consequently, the estimated effects 
illustrated in column 3 of Table 1 show 
the distributional effects of the updated 
wage data only. The effects of using the 
updated pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index data combined with 
the 75 percent reduction in the BNAF 
are illustrated in column 4 of Table 1. 

We have included a comparison of the 

combined effects of the 75 percent 
BNAF reduction, the updated pre-floor, 
pre-reclassified hospital wage index, 
and an estimated 2.1 percent hospital 
market basket increase for FY 2010 
(Table 1, column 5). Presenting these 
data gives the hospice industry a more 
complete picture of the effects on their 
total revenue of the proposed hospice 
wage index discussed in this rule, the 
BNAF phase-out, and the estimated FY 
2010 hospital market basket update. 
Certain events may limit the scope or 
accuracy of our impact analysis, because 
such an analysis is susceptible to 
forecasting errors due to other changes 
in the forecasted impact time period. 
The nature of the Medicare program is 
such that the changes may interact, and 
the complexity of the interaction of 
these changes could make it difficult to 
predict accurately the full scope of the 
impact upon hospices.

analysis as of January 29, 2009. In 
column 2, we indicate the number of 
routine home care days that were 
included in our analysis, although the 
analysis was performed on all types of 
hospice care. Columns 3, 4, and 5 
compare FY 2010 estimated payments 

with those estimated for FY 2009. The 
estimated FY 2009 payments 
incorporate a BNAF which has not been 
reduced. Column 3 shows the

to the combined effects of using the 
2009 pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital 
wage index and reducing the BNAF by

reduction, and a 2.1 percent estimated 
hospital market basket update. 

Table 1 also categorizes hospices by 

various geographic and hospice 
characteristics. The first row of data 
displays the aggregate result of the 
impact for all Medicare-certified 
hospices. The second and third rows of 
the table categorize hospices according 
to their geographic location (urban and 
rural). Our analysis indicated that there 
are 2,184 hospices located in urban 
areas and 1,022 hospices located in 
rural areas. The next two row groupings 
in the table indicate the number of 
hospices by census region, also broken 
down by urban and rural hospices. The 
next grouping shows the impact on 
hospices based on the size of the 
hospice’s program. We determined that 
the majority of hospice payments are 
made at the routine home care rate. 
Therefore, we based the size of each 
individual hospice’s program on the 
number of routine home care days 
provided in FY 2007. The next grouping 
shows the impact on hospices by type 
of ownership. The final grouping shows 
the impact on hospices defined by 
whether they are provider-based or 
freestanding. 

As indicated in Table 1, there are 
3,206 hospices. Approximately 49.8 
percent of Medicare-certified hospices 
are identified as voluntary (non-profit) 
or government agencies. Because the 
National Hospice and Palliative Care 
Organization estimates that 
approximately 83.6 percent of hospice 
patients in 2007 were Medicare 
beneficiaries, we have not considered 
other sources of revenue in this 
analysis. 

As stated previously, the following 

discussions are limited to demonstrating 
trends rather than projected dollars. We 
used the pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage indexes as well as the 
most complete claims data available (FY 
2007) in developing the impact analysis. 
The FY 2010 payment rates will be 
adjusted to reflect the full hospital 
market basket, as required by section 
1814(i)(1)(C)(ii)(VII) of the Act. As 
previously noted, we publish these rates 
through administrative instructions 
rather than in a proposed rule. Currently 
the FY 2010 hospital market basket 
update is estimated to be 2.1 percent; 
however this figure is subject to change. 
Since the inclusion of the effect of an 
estimated hospital market basket 
increase provides a more complete 
picture of projected total hospice 
payments for FY 2010, the last column 
of Table 1 shows the combined impacts 
of the updated wage index, the 75 
percent BNAF reduction, and an 

estimated 2.1 percent hospital market 
basket update factor. 

As discussed in the FY 2006 hospice 

wage index final rule (70 FR 45129), 
hospice agencies may use multiple 
hospice wage index values to compute 
their payments based on potentially 
different geographic locations. Before 
January 1, 2008, the location of the 
beneficiary was used to determine the 
CBSA for routine and continuous home 
care and the location of the hospice 
agency was used to determine the CBSA 
for respite and general inpatient care. 
Beginning January 1, 2008, the hospice 
wage index utilized is based on the 
location of the site of service. As the 
location of the beneficiary’s home and 
the location of the facility may vary, 
there will still be variability in 
geographic location for an individual 
hospice. We anticipate that the location 
of the various sites will usually 
correspond with the geographic location 
of the hospice, and thus we will 
continue to use the location of the 
hospice for our analyses of the impact 
of the proposed changes to the hospice 
wage index in this rule. For this 
analysis, we use payments to the 
hospice in the aggregate based on the 
location of the hospice. 

The impact of hospice wage index 

changes has been analyzed according to 
the type of hospice, geographic location, 
type of ownership, hospice base, and 
size. Our analysis shows that most 
hospices are in urban areas and provide 
the vast majority of routine home care 
days. Most hospices are medium-sized 
followed by large hospices. Hospices are 
almost equal in numbers by ownership 
with 1,598 designated as non-profit and 
1,608 as proprietary. The vast majority 
of hospices are freestanding. 
1. Hospice Size 

Under the Medicare hospice benefit, 

hospices can provide four different 
levels of care days. The majority of the 
days provided by a hospice are routine 
home care (RHC) days, representing 
about 97 percent of the services 
provided by a hospice. Therefore, the 
number of RHC days can be used as a 
proxy for the size of the hospice, that is, 
the more days of care provided, the 
larger the hospice. As discussed in the 
August 4, 2005 final rule, we currently 
use three size designations to present 
the impact analyses. The three 
categories are: (1) Small agencies having 
0 to 3,499 RHC days; (2) medium 
agencies having 3,500 to 19,999 RHC 
days; and (3) large agencies having 
20,000 or more RHC days. The updated 
FY 2010 wage index values without any 
BNAF reduction are anticipated to 
increase payments to small and medium

hospices by 0.1 percent, and to decrease 
payments to large hospices by 0.1 
percent (column 3); the FY 2010 wage 
index values using the updated wage 
data and the 75 percent BNAF reduction 
that was finalized in the FY 2009 final 
rule, published August 2008 (73 FR 
46464), are anticipated to decrease 
estimated payments to small and to 
medium hospices by 2.9 percent each, 
and to large hospices by 3.2 percent 
(column 4); and finally, the FY 2010 
wage index values with the updated 
wage data, the 75 percent BNAF 
reduction which was finalized in the FY 
2009 final rule, published in August 
2008 (73 FR 46464), and the estimated 
2.1 percent hospital market basket 
update are projected to decrease 
estimated payments by 0.8 percent for 
small hospices, by 0.9 percent for 
medium hospices, and to decrease 
estimated payments by 1.2 percent for 
large hospices (column 5). 
2. Geographic Location 

Column 3 of Table 1 shows that FY 

2010 wage index values without the 
BNAF reduction would result in little 
change in estimated payments. Urban 
hospices are anticipated to experience a 
slight decrease of 0.1 percent while 
rural hospices are anticipated to have a 
slight increase of 0.1 percent. For urban 
hospices, the greatest increase of 1.6 
percent is anticipated to be experienced 
by the Pacific regions, followed by an 
increase for West North Central regions 
of 0.4 percent, an increase for Mountain 
regions of 0.1 percent, and no change for 
the West South Central or New England 
regions. The remaining urban regions 
are anticipated to experience a decrease 
ranging from 0.1 percent in the Middle 
Atlantic region to a 1.2 percent decrease 
for Outlying regions. East South Central 
is anticipated to see a slight decrease 
which rounds to a 0.0 percent change. 

Column 3 shows that for rural 

hospices, Outlying regions are 
anticipated to experience no change. 
Five regions are anticipated to 
experience a decrease ranging from 0.1 
percent for the South Atlantic and East 
South Central regions to 0.6 percent for 
the East North Central region. The 
remaining regions are anticipated to 
experience an increase ranging from 0.6 
percent for the New England region to 
1.7 percent for the Pacific region. 

Column 4 shows the combined effect 
of the 75 percent BNAF reduction and 
the updated pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index values on estimated 
payments, as compared to the FY 2009 
estimated payments using a BNAF with 
no reduction. Overall urban hospices 
are anticipated to experience a 3.3 
percent decrease in payments, while

rural hospices expect a 2.3 percent 
decrease. The estimated percent 
decrease in payment for urban hospices 
ranged from 1.2 percent for Outlying 
hospices to 4.0 percent for South 
Atlantic hospices. 

The estimated percent decrease in 

payment for rural hospices ranged from 
0.9 percent for West South Central 
hospices to 3.8 percent for East North 
Central hospices. Rural Outlying 
estimated payments were unaffected. 

Column 5 shows the combined effects 

of the proposed FY 2010 wage index 
values with the updated wage data, the 
75 percent BNAF reduction which was 
finalized in the FY 2009 final rule, 
published in August 2008 (73 FR 
46464), and the estimated 2.1 percent 
hospital market basket update on 
estimated payments as compared to the 
estimated FY 2009 payments. Note that 
the FY 2009 payments had no BNAF 
reduction applied to them. Overall, 
urban hospices are anticipated to 
experience a 1.2 percent decrease in 
payments while rural hospices should 
experience a 0.3 percent decrease in 
payments. Urban hospices are 
anticipated to experience a decrease in 
estimated payments in 8 regions, 
ranging from a 0.8 percent decrease for 
the West North Central region to a 1.9 
percent decrease for South Atlantic 
hospices. Urban hospices in 2 regions 
are anticipated to see an increase in 
estimated payments of 0.1 percent for 
the Pacific region and 0.9 percent for 
Outlying regions. Rural hospices in 6 
regions are estimated to see a decrease 
in payments ranging from 0.4 percent 
for the West North Central region to 1.8 
percent for the East North Central 
region. Rural hospices in 4 regions are 
anticipated to see an increase in 
payments ranging from 0.3 percent for 
the Pacific region to 2.1 percent for the 
Outlying regions. 
3. Type of Ownership 

Column 3 demonstrates the effect of 
the updated pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index on FY 2010 
estimated payments versus FY 2009 
estimated payments with no BNAF 
reduction applied to them. We 
anticipate that using the updated pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage 
index data would increase estimated 
payments to proprietary (for-profit) 
hospices by 0.1 percent. We estimate a 
slight decrease in payments for 
voluntary (non-profit) and government 
hospices of 0.1 percent each. 

Column 4 demonstrates the combined 

effects of using updated pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index data 
and of incorporating a 75 percent BNAF 
reduction. Estimated payments to

proprietary (for-profit) hospices are 
anticipated to decrease by 3.0 percent, 
while voluntary (non-profit) and 
government hospices are each 
anticipated to experience decreases of 
3.3 percent. 

Column 5 shows the combined effects 
of the updated pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index values with the 
updated wage data, the 75 percent 
BNAF reduction, and the estimated 2.1 
percent hospital market basket update 
on estimated payments, comparing FY 
2010 to FY 2009 (using a BNAF with no 
reduction). Estimated FY 2010 
payments are anticipated to decrease by 
1.0 percent for proprietary (for-profit) 
hospices, and by 1.3 percent for both 
voluntary (non-profit) and government 
hospices. 
4. Hospice Base 

Column 3 demonstrates the effect of 

using the updated pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index values, 
comparing estimated payments for FY 
2010 to FY 2009 (using a BNAF with no 
reduction). Estimated payments are 
anticipated to decrease by 0.1 percent 
each for freestanding facilities and for 
hospices based out of skilled nursing 
facilities. Home health and hospital 
based facilities are anticipated to 
experience a 0.2 percent increase in 
estimated payments. 

Column 4 shows the combined effects 

of updating the pre-floor, pre- 
reclassified hospital wage index values 
and reducing the BNAF by 75 percent 
(as finalized in the FY 2009 final rule, 
published August 2008, 73 FR 46464), 
comparing FY 2010 to FY 2009 (using 
a BNAF with no reduction) estimated 
payments. Skilled nursing facility based 
hospices are estimated to see a 3.5 
percent decrease, freestanding hospices 
are estimated to see a 3.2 percent 
decrease, home health agency based 
hospices are anticipated to experience a 
3.1 percent decrease in payments, and 
hospital-based hospices are anticipated 
to experience a 3.0 percent decrease in 
payments. 

Column 5 shows the combined effects 
of the updated pre-floor, pre-reclassified 
hospital wage index, the 75 percent 
BNAF reduction which was finalized in 
FY 2009 hospice wage index final rule 
(73 FR 46464), and the estimated 2.1 
percent hospital market basket update 
on estimated payments, comparing FY 
2010 to FY 2009 (using a BNAF with no 
reduction). Estimated payments are 
anticipated to decrease by 0.9 percent 
for hospital based hospices, by 1.1 
percent for home health agency based 
hospices, and by 1.2 percent and by 1.5 
percent for freestanding hospices and 

skilled nursing facility based hospices, 
respectively. 
C. Accounting Statement 

As required by OMB Circular A–4 

(available at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/ 
a004/a-4.pdf), in Table 2 below, we 
have prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with the 
proposed provisions of this rule. This 
table provides our best estimate of the 
decrease in Medicare payments under 
the hospice benefit as a result of the 
changes presented in this proposed rule 
on data for 3,206 hospices in our 
database. All expenditures are classified 
as transfers to Medicare providers (that 
is, hospices).
