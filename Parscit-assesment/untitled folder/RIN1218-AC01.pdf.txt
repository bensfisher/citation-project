[Docket ID–OSHA–2007–0066] 

RIN 1218–AC01 

Cranes and Derricks in Construction 
AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA), Labor. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: OSHA is proposing a rule to 
protect employees from the hazards 
associated with hoisting equipment 
when used to perform construction 
activities. Under this proposed rule, 
employers would first determine 
whether the ground is sufficient to 
support the anticipated weight of 
hoisting equipment and associated 
loads. The employer then would be 
required to assess hazards within the 
work zone that would affect the safe 
operation of hoisting equipment, such 
as those of power lines and objects or 
personnel that would be within the 
work zone or swing radius of the 
hoisting equipment. Finally, the 
employer would be required to ensure 
that the equipment is in safe operating 
condition via required inspections and 
employees in the work zone are trained 
to recognize hazards associated with the 
use of the equipment and any related 
duties that they are assigned to perform. 
DATES: Submit comments (including 
comments to the information-collection 
(paperwork) determination described

651–678) (the OSH Act) authorizes the 
Secretary of Labor to adopt safety and 
health standards to reduce injuries and 
illnesses in American workplaces. 
Pursuant to that authority, the Secretary 
has adopted, among others, a set of 
safety and health standards applicable 
to the construction industry, 29 CFR 
Part 1926. Initially, standards for the 
construction industry were adopted 
under the Construction Safety Act, 40 
U.S.C. 333. Under the Construction 
Safety Act, those standards were limited 
to employers engaged in federally- 
financed or federally-assisted 
construction projects. The Secretary 
subsequently adopted them as OSHA 
standards pursuant to Section 6(a) of the 
OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 655(a), which 
authorized the Secretary to adopt 
established federal standards as OSH 
Act standards within the first two years 
the OSH Act was effective (36 FR 25232, 
Dec. 30, 1971). Subpart N of 29 CFR part 
1926, entitled ‘‘Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, 
Elevators, and Conveyors,’’ was 
originally adopted through this process. 

The section of subpart N of 29 CFR 

part 1926 that applies to cranes and 
derricks is § 1926.550. That section 
relies heavily on national consensus 
standards that were in effect in 1971, in 
some cases incorporating the consensus 
standards by reference. For example, 
§ 1926.550(b)(2) requires crawler, truck, 
and locomotive cranes to meet 
applicable requirements for design, 
inspection, construction, testing, 
maintenance, and operation prescribed 
in ANSI B30.5–1968, ‘‘Crawler, 
Locomotive and Truck Cranes.’’ 
Similarly, § 1926.550(e) requires 
derricks to meet applicable 
requirements for design, construction, 
installation, inspection, testing, 
maintenance, and operation prescribed 
in ANSI B30.6–1969, ‘‘Derricks.’’ Since 
1971, § 1926.550 has been amended 
substantively only twice. In 1988, a new 
paragraph (g) was added to establish 
clearly the conditions under which 
employees on personnel platforms may 
be hoisted by cranes and derricks. 53 FR 
29116 (Aug. 2, 1988). In 1993, a new 
paragraph § 1926.550(a)(19) was added 
to require that all employees be kept 
clear of lifted and suspended loads. 

There have been considerable 

technological changes since the 1971 
OSHA standard was issued. For 
example, hydraulic cranes were rare at 
that time but are now prevalent. 
Although the OSHA standard remains 
largely unchanged, the construction 
industry has updated the consensus 
standards on which the OSHA standard 
is based. For example, the industry 
consensus standard for derricks was 
most recently updated in 2003, and that 

for crawler, locomotive and truck cranes 
in 2004. 

In recent years, a number of industry 

stakeholders asked the Agency to 
update Subpart N’s cranes and derrick 
requirements. They were concerned that 
accidents involving cranes and derricks 
continued to be a significant cause of 
fatal and other serious injuries on 
construction sites and believed that an 
updated standard was needed to address 
the causes of these accidents and to 
reduce their numbers. They emphasized 
that the considerable changes in both 
work processes and technology have 
made much of Subpart N obsolete. 

In response to these requests, in 1998 

OSHA’s Advisory Committee for 
Construction Safety and Health 
(ACCSH) established a workgroup to 
develop recommended changes to the 
Subpart N requirements for cranes and 
derricks. The workgroup developed 
recommendations on some issues and 
submitted them to the full committee in 
a draft workgroup report. (OSHA–2007– 
0066–0020). In December 1999, ACCSH 
recommended to OSHA that the agency 
consider using a negotiated rulemaking 
process as the mechanism to update 
Subpart N (ACCSH 1999–4, Ex. 100x, 
p. 112). 
B. The Cranes and Derricks Negotiated 
Rulemaking Advisory Committee 
(C–DAC) 

In July 2002, OSHA announced its 
intent to use negotiated rulemaking 
under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act 
(NRA), 5 U.S.C. 561 et seq., to revise the 
cranes and derricks standard. The 
Agency made this decision in light of 
the stakeholder interest in updating 
Subpart N, the constructive discussions 
and work of the ACCSH workgroup, 
ACCSH’s recommendation, a positive 
assessment of the criteria listed in the 
NRA (5 U.S.C. 563(a)) for the use of 
negotiated rulemaking, and the 
Department of Labor’s policy on 
negotiated rulemaking (See ‘‘Notice of 
Policy on Use of Negotiated Rulemaking 
Procedures by Agencies of the 
Department of Labor,’’ 57 FR 61925 
(Dec. 29, 1992)). The Agency issued a 
notice of intent to use negotiated 
rulemaking for this project and establish 
the Cranes and Derricks Negotiated 
Rulemaking Advisory Committee 
(‘‘C–DAC’’ or ‘‘the Committee’’) (67 FR 
46612, July 16, 2002). 

Negotiated rulemaking is a process by 
which a proposed rule is developed by 
a committee comprised of members who 
represent the interests that will be 
significantly affected by the rule. 
Section 562 of the NRA defines 
‘‘interest’’ as follows:

‘‘[I]nterest’’ means, with respect to an issue 

or matter, multiple parties which have a 
similar point of view or which are likely to 
be affected in a similar manner. 

By bringing different viewpoints to 

the table and sharing views, the 
members of the negotiated rulemaking 
committee learn the reasons for different 
positions on the issues as well as the 
practical effect of various approaches. 
Each member of the committee 
participates in resolving the interests 
and concerns of other members. 
Negotiation allows interested parties, 
including members who represent the 
interests of employers who will be 
subject to the rule and the employees 
who stand to benefit from the safer 
workplaces the rule will produce, to 
become involved at an earlier stage of 
the rulemaking process. As a result, the 
rule that OSHA proposes will have 
already received close scrutiny by 
affected parties at the pre-proposal 
stage. 

The goal of the negotiated rulemaking 

process is to develop a proposed rule 
that represents a consensus of all the 
interests. The NRA defines consensus as 
unanimous concurrence among the 
interests represented on a negotiated 
rulemaking committee unless the 
committee itself unanimously agrees to 
use a different definition of consensus. 
As discussed below, C–DAC agreed by 
unanimous vote to a different definition: 
a consensus was reached on an issue 
when not more than two non-federal 
members dissented on that issue. 

In the July 2002 notice of intent to 

establish a negotiated rulemaking 
committee referred to above, the Agency 
listed key issues that OSHA expected 
the negotiations to address and the 
interests that OSHA had tentatively 
identified as being significantly affected 
by the rulemaking. Those interests were: 
—Crane and derrick manufacturers, 

suppliers, and distributors. 

—Companies that repair and maintain 

cranes and derricks. 

—Crane and derrick leasing companies. 
—Owners of cranes and derricks. 
—Construction companies that use 

cranes and derricks. 
—General contractors. 
—Labor organizations representing 

construction employees who operate 
cranes and derricks. 

—Labor organizations representing 

construction employees who work in 
conjunction with cranes and derricks. 
—Owners of electric power distribution 

lines. 

—Civil, structural and architectural 
engineering firms and engineering 
consultants involved with the use of 
cranes and derricks in construction.

—Crane and derrick operator testing 

organizations. 

—Insurance and safety organizations, 

and public interest groups. 

—Trade associations. 
—Government entities involved with 

construction safety and with 
construction operations involving 
cranes and derricks. 
OSHA asked for public comment on 

whether interests other than those listed 
would be significantly affected by a new 
rule. It also solicited requests for 
membership on the committee. OSHA 
urged interested parties to communicate 
with others who shared similar interests 
and to begin organizing coalitions to 
support those interests in order to 

identify individuals for nomination to 
the committee. 

The Agency noted that the need to 

limit the committee’s membership to a 
number that could conduct effective 
negotiations might mean that not all 
interests could be represented on the 
committee itself. However, OSHA 
further noted that interested persons 
had means other than committee 
membership available to participate in 
the committee’s deliberations, including 
attending committee meetings and 
addressing the committee, providing 
written comments to the committee, and 
participating in committee workgroups. 
67 FR at 46615. 

In response to its request for public 

input, the Agency received broad 

support for using negotiated rulemaking 
and 55 nominations for committee 
membership. To keep membership to a 
reasonable size, OSHA tentatively listed 
20 potential committee members and 
asked for public comment on that 
proposed list. 68 FR 9036 (Feb. 27, 
2003). In response to the comments, 
OSHA added three members to the 
committee—individuals from the 
mobile crane manufacturing industry, 
the Specialized Carriers & Rigging 
Association, and the outdoor advertising 
industry. 68 FR 39879 (July 3, 2003).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

in an impartial manner; 

(2) impartially assisting the members 

of the committee in conducting 
discussions and negotiations; and 

(1) Chairing the Committee’s meetings 

(3) supervising the taking of minutes 

and keeping of records and other 
relevant responsibilities, including the 
drafting of meeting summaries after 
each meeting to be reviewed and 
approved by C–DAC members. 

C–DAC first met from July 30 to 
August 1, 2003. Before addressing 
substantive issues, the Committee 
developed ground rules (formally 
approved on September 26, 2003) that 
would guide its deliberations. (OSHA– 
S030–2006–0663–0373). In addition to 
procedural matters, the ground rules 
addressed the nature and consequences 
of the Committee’s decision-making. 
C–DAC agreed that it would make every 
effort to reach unanimous agreement on 
all issues. However, if the facilitator 
determined that unanimous consent 
could not be achieved, the Committee 
would consider consensus to be reached 
when not more than two non-federal 
members (i.e., members other than the 
OSHA member) dissented. Under this 
definition, if OSHA dissented, there 
would be no consensus. 

This definition of consensus reflects 

the non-federal members’ view that 
Agency support of the Committee’s 
work was essential. The non-federal 
members believed that, if OSHA 
dissented, there would be little 
likelihood that the Committee’s work 
product would eventually be reflected 
in the final rule. These members wanted 
to ensure that concerns of the Agency 
that would prompt it to dissent were 
instead resolved in the negotiating 
process. 

Under this ground rule, if C–DAC 

reached a final consensus agreement on 
some or all issues, OSHA would use the 
consensus-based language on those 
issues for which agreement was reached 
as its proposed standard, and C–DAC 
members would refrain from providing 
formal written negative comment on 
those issues in response to the proposed 
rule. 

The ground rules provide that OSHA 
may only depart from this aspect of the 
agreement by either reopening the 
negotiated rulemaking process or 
providing to the C–DAC members a 
detailed statement of the reasons for 
altering the consensus-based language 
sufficiently far in advance of 
publication that the C–DAC members 
could express their concerns to OSHA. 
The Committee members could also 
provide negative or positive public 
comment in response to those changes. 
(OSHA–S030–2006–0663–0373). 

A tentative list of issues for the 

Committee to address was published 
along with the final list of Committee 
members (68 FR at 39879–90). At its 
initial meeting, the Committee reviewed 
and revised the issue list, adding several 
issues. (OSHA–S030–2006–0663–0372). 
The Committee met 11 times between 
July 30, 2003 and July 9, 2004. As the 
meetings progressed, the Committee 
reached consensus agreement on 
various issues and, at the final meeting, 
reached consensus agreement on all 
outstanding issues. The Committee’s 
work product, which is the Committee’s 
recommended regulatory text for the 
proposed rule, is referred to here as the 
C–DAC Consensus Document. (OSHA– 
S030–2006–0663–0639). On October 12, 
2006, ACCSH adopted a resolution 
supporting the C–DAC Consensus 
Document and recommending that 
OSHA use it as the basis for a proposed 
standard. (ACCSH 2006–1, Ex. 101x, pp. 
248–49). 

As noted earlier, OSHA’s assent was 
needed for C–DAC to reach consensus 
agreement on an issue. Thus, the fact 
that the Committee reached consensus 
agreement on all issues means that this 
proposal reflects OSHA’s agreement 
with the Consensus Document. In the 
discussion of the various sections of the 
proposal below, when the Committee’s 
views or conclusions are stated, OSHA 
agrees with those views or conclusions 
unless otherwise noted. 

In reviewing the Consensus Document 

to draft this proposed rule, OSHA 
identified certain problems in the 
Consensus Document. These range from 
misnumbering and other typographical/ 
technical errors to provisions that 
appear to be inconsistent with the 
Committee’s intent or that are worded in 
a manner that requires clarification. 
This proposed rule deviates from the 
Consensus Document where changes 
were clearly needed to reflect the 
Committee’s intent, or to correct 
typographical/technical errors. With 
respect to substantive changes, the 
Agency has identified and explained 
them in the portions of this preamble 
that address the affected provisions. 

There are instances where it appears 

to the Agency that other changes may be 
needed for several reasons: To conform 
to the Committee’s intent; where the 
precise form of a change needed to 
conform to that intent is not clear; or 
where an aspect of a significant issue 
appears not to have been considered by 
C–DAC. In each such instance OSHA 
has retained the regulatory language 
used in the Consensus Document but 
asks for public comment on them. 

Numerous Committee members had 

vast and varied experience in cranes 

and derricks in construction, which 
gave them a wealth of knowledge in the 
causes of accidents and safety issues 
involving such equipment. In addition, 
other members had substantial 
knowledge and experience in other 
types of subject areas that also related to 
crane and derrick safety. This is 
reflected in the summary of their 
qualifications (see list above). 

The members used this knowledge to 
identify issues that required particular 
attention and to devise regulatory 
language that would address the causes 
of such accidents. Their extensive 
practical experience in the construction 
industry and the other industries 
represented on the Committee helped 
them to design improvements to the 
current Subpart N requirements that 
would be practical and workable. This 
preamble describes the proposed 
standard and the Committee’s reasons 
for resolving the various issues in the 
manner it did. 

In examining the causes of crane 

accidents and devising ways to reduce 
them, the Committee concluded that 
incorrect operation was a factor in many 
accidents. Operating a crane is a 
complex job requiring skill and 
knowledge. To operate a crane safely 
requires a thorough knowledge of the 
equipment and controls and a complete 
understanding of the factors that can 
affect the safety of its operation. The 
Committee believed that it was essential 
to address the issue of operator 
qualification so that accidents resulting 
from incorrect operation would be 
reduced. 

C–DAC spent considerable time and 

effort determining how the proposed 
rule could best ensure that equipment 
operators are well qualified. C–DAC 
decided that it was necessary for crane 
operators to be certified or qualified 
through a formal process to ensure that 
they possessed the degree of knowledge 
necessary to operate their equipment 
safely. The Committee’s reasoning and 
the details of the qualification/ 
certification process are discussed 
below in connection with § 1926.1427, 
Operator Qualification and 
Certification. 

Another cause of numerous fatal and 
serious accidents that C–DAC addressed 
was equipment making electrical 
contact with power lines. Although 
Subpart N currently addresses this issue 
by requiring equipment to maintain a 
minimum distance from power lines 
that depends on the voltage of the line, 
the Committee identified reasons why 
the current standard was not preventing 
the many accidents that continue to 
occur. The Committee concluded that 
simply requiring a minimum clearance

distance was not sufficient to eliminate 
the human error that led to most 
instances of power line contact and that 
additional requirements that would help 
employers identify potential power line 
hazards and systematic procedures to 
protect against those hazards were 
needed to prevent power line contact. 
See the discussion below under 
§§ 1926.1407–1411, which deal with the 
various aspects of power line safety. 

As noted above, OSHA’s current 

standard on cranes and derricks, 29 CFR 
1926.550, incorporates numerous 
national consensus standards by 
reference. The Committee reviewed the 
most recent versions of these consensus 
standards. For some issues, the 
Committee determined that a different 
approach was warranted (such as in the 
case of protections against power lines 
and operator qualification/certification). 
In many other instances the Committee 
determined that concepts in the 
consensus standards were appropriate 
but that different wording was needed 
to improve clarity and enforceability, or 
to be more readable within the structure 
of the proposed rule. 

Where the Committee incorporated 

consensus standards by reference, it 
agreed with the concepts, found the 
structure and wording appropriate, and 
determined that the incorporation of the 
provisions would not detract from its 
goal of producing a readable document. 
In addition, to avoid encumbering the 
text with too much length and technical 
detail that would hinder readability, C– 
DAC decided to incorporate by 
reference certain requirements from 
consensus standards where those 
requirements addressed highly technical 
topics, such as welding criteria. 

C–DAC also determined that some 
categories of equipment needed to be 
addressed differently than others. The 
proposed standard contains general 
requirements in §§ 1926.1402–1434 that 
are appropriate for most types of 
equipment and workplaces but which 
contain certain specific exclusions. 
Sections 1926.1435–1441 each address a 
specific type of equipment, such as 
§ 1926.1435, Tower cranes. Those 
sections tailor the requirements of the 
proposed standard to accommodate the 
unique characteristics of that 
equipment. They state which of the 
general provisions in §§ 1926.1402– 
1434 apply to that type of equipment 
and which do not. They also include 
requirements specific to that type of 
equipment either (as specified) as a 
substitute for, or in addition to, the 
general provisions in §§ 1926.1402– 
1434. In this way, C–DAC ensured that 
each type of equipment would be

subject to requirements appropriate for 
that equipment. 

In drafting some of the provisions in 

this proposal, the Committee recognized 
that OSHA would be requiring cranes 
and derricks to be equipped with 
operational aids that have not been 
mandatory in the past. For some types 
of these aids, the Committee believed it 
would be impractical to require that 
cranes and derricks be retrofitted with 
the devices. In determining whether to 
propose that such requirements be 
prospective only, the Committee 
considered the degree of importance of 
the device to safety, whether the devices 
are required under industry consensus 
standards and, if so, the date they were 
first required under such standards. 
Recognizing that manufacturers 
generally follow industry consensus 
standards, C–DAC drafted these 
provisions to require equipment 
manufactured after the date an 
operational aid was required by an 
industry consensus standard to be 
equipped with the device. 

In situations where no industry 

consensus standard required that cranes 
or derricks be equipped with a certain 
operational aid or fall protection device, 
the Committee decided to allow 
sufficient lead time for manufacturers to 
install the aids and devices. The 
Committee proposed to require some 
aids and devices on equipment 
manufactured one year after the 
effective date of this standard. In other 
cases, the Committee specified that the 
aids and devices would be required on 
equipment manufactured after January 
1, 2008. 

It is now evident that the standard 
will not be finalized by that date and 
that keying requirements to that date 
will not afford employers the lead time 
intended by the Committee. To conform 
this proposed standard to the 
Committee’s intent, and to ensure that 
industry has sufficient lead time to 
equip cranes and derricks with the 
required aids and devices, OSHA is 
substituting ‘‘more than one year after 
the effective date of this standard’’ for 
‘‘January 1, 2008’’ wherever that date 
appears in the Committee’s draft. 
C. Hazards Associated With Cranes and 
Derricks in Construction Work 

OSHA estimates that 89 crane-related 
fatalities occur per year in construction 
work. The causes of crane-related 
fatalities were recently analyzed by 
Beavers, et al. J.E. Beavers, J.R. Moore, 
R. Rinehart, and W.R. Schriver, ‘‘Crane- 
Related Fatalities in the Construction 
Industry,’’ 132 Journal of Construction 
Engineering and Management 901 (Sept. 
2006) (OSHA–2007–0066–0012). The 

authors searched OSHA’s Integrated 
Management Information System (IMIS) 
database for all fatal accidents for 1997– 
2003 investigated by OSHA involving 
cranes in the construction industry. By 
searching the database for cases using 
the key words ‘‘crane,’’ ‘‘derrick,’’ or 
‘‘boom,’’ they identified 381 IMIS files 
for the covered years in the federal 
program states, which include states 
with about 57% of all workers 
throughout the country. The authors 
requested the case files from OSHA so 
that they could confirm that a crane or 
derrick was involved in the fatality. Of 
the 335 case files that OSHA provided, 
the authors identified 125 (involving 
127 fatalities) as being crane or derrick 
related. From these files, they 
determined that the percentages of 
fatalities caused by various types of 
incident are in Table 2 as follows:

A study by Suruda et al. examined the 

causes of crane-related deaths for the 
1984–1994 period. A. Suruda, M. Egger, 
& D. Liu, ‘‘Crane-Related Deaths in the 
U.S. Construction Industry, 1984–94,’’ 
The Center to Protect Workers’ Rights 
(Oct. 1997) (OSHA–2007–0066–0013). 
The authors examined OSHA IMIS data 
to identify the number of fatal accidents 
involving cranes and determine their 
causes. For the years in question, they 
found 479 accidents involving 502 
fatalities. In the worst year, 1990, 70 
deaths occurred. 

The authors noted some limitations in 

the data they examined: Data for 
California, Michigan, and Washington 
state were not available for 1984–1989; 
the proportion of fatal accidents that 
OSHA and the states that enforce their 
own state plans investigate is unknown; 
and some of the investigation reports 
were not sufficiently detailed to allow 
the cause of the accident or the type of 
crane involved to be determined. 

The Suruda study determined that the 

number and the percentage of fatalities 
from various causes are in Table 3 as

The proposed standard addresses the 

major causes of the equipment related 
fatalities identified in the Beavers and 
Suruda studies. The following is a brief 
synopsis of the sections in this proposed 
standard that address them; each 
proposed section is explained in detail 
later in this preamble. 

The electrocution hazard is addressed 
by proposed §§ 1926.1407–1411, which 
deal with various aspects of power line 
safety. These sections contain 
requirements designed to prevent 
equipment from contacting energized 
power lines. The proposed rule 
delineates systematic, reliable 
procedures and methods that must be 
used to prevent a safe clearance distance 
from being breached. If maintaining the 
safe clearance distance is infeasible, 
additional protections would be 
required, including grounding the 
equipment, covering the line with an 
insulating sleeve, and using insulating 
links and nonconductive tag lines. 

These procedures and methods are 

supplemented by requirements for 
training the operator and crew in power 
line safety and the requirement for 
operator qualification and certification 
in proposed § 1926.1427. C–DAC 
concluded that compliance with these 
training and certification requirements 
will not only reduce the frequency of 
power line contact but will give the 
workers the knowledge they need to 
help avoid injury in the event such 
contact does occur. 

Fatalities that involve employees 

being struck or crushed during 
assembly/disassembly are addressed in 
proposed §§ 1926.1403–1406. These 
sections require certain specific safe 
practice procedures to be followed and 
for the employer to address a list of 
specific hazards. Also, assembly/ 
disassembly must be supervised by an 
individual who is well qualified to see 
that these requirements are properly 
implemented. 

As the studies show and the 

Committee’s experience confirms, many 
disassembly accidents occur when

sections of lattice booms unexpectedly 
move and strike or crush an employee 
who is disassembling the boom. The 
proposal addresses this scenario in 
proposed § 1926.1404(f) by prohibiting 
employees from being under the boom 
when pins are removed unless special 
precautions are taken to protect against 
boom movement. 

Accidents resulting from boom or 

cable failure are addressed in a number 
of provisions. For example, the 
proposed standard includes 
requirements for: Proper assembly 
procedures (proposed § 1926.1403); 
boom stops to prevent booms from being 
raised too far and toppling over 
backwards (proposed § 1926.1415, 
Safety devices); a boom hoist limiting 
device to prevent excessive boom travel, 
and an anti-two-block device, which 
prevents overloading the boom from 
two-blocking (proposed § 1926.1416, 
Operational aids). Also, the inspection 
requirements (proposed § 1926.1412) are 
designed so that a structural deficiency 
in a boom will be detected and 
addressed before an accident occurs. 
Cable failure will be avoided by 
compliance with proposed sections 
such as § 1926.1413, Wire rope— 
inspection, § 1926.1414, Wire rope— 
selection and installation criteria, and 
the provision in proposed § 1926.1416 
requiring two-block protection. 

Crane tip-over is caused by factors 
such as overloading, improper use of 
outriggers and insufficient ground 
conditions. Proposed § 1926.1417, 
Operations, includes provisions 
designed to prevent overloading. That 
section prohibits the equipment from 
being operated in excess of its rated 
capacity and includes procedures for 
ensuring that the weight of the load is 
reliably determined and within the 
equipment’s rated capacity. Proposed 
§ 1926.1404(q) has requirements for 
outrigger use designed to ensure that 
outriggers are properly set when they 
are needed to provide stability when a 
load is lifted. Proposed § 1926.1402 has 
requirements designed to ensure 
sufficient ground conditions. 

The provisions on training and 

operator qualification and certification 
will also prevent this type of accident 
by ensuring that the operator is 
sufficiently knowledgeable and skilled 
to recognize situations when the crane 
may be overloaded and to either require 
that the situation be corrected or refuse 
to proceed in accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1418, Authority to stop 
operation. 

Fatalities that result from workers 

being struck by the cab or 
counterweights will be avoided by 
compliance with proposed § 1926.1424, 

Work area control. That section would 
require that employees who must work 
near equipment with a rotating 
superstructure be trained in the hazards 
involved, that employers mark or 
barricade the area within the area 
covered by the rotating superstructure, 
and that the operator be alerted 
whenever an employee must enter that 
area and not rotate the superstructure 
until the area is clear. Protection against 
being struck by a counterweight during 
assembly/disassembly is provided by 
proposed § 1926.1404(h)(9), which 
would require the assembly/ 
disassembly supervisor to address this 
hazard and take steps when necessary to 
protect workers against that danger. 

The proposal addresses a number of 

types of equipment failure that can 
result in the load striking a worker. 
Such accidents are directly addressed 
by proposed § 1926.1425, Keeping clear 
of the load, and § 1926.1426, Free fall/ 
controlled load lowering. In addition, 
improved requirements in proposed 
§§ 1926.1419–1422 for signaling will 
help avoid load struck-by accidents 
caused by miscommunication. 

Improper operation, including, for 

example, the failure to understand and 
compensate for the effects of factors 
such as dynamic loading, can also cause 
employees to be struck by a load. Such 
incidents will be reduced by 
compliance with proposed § 1926.1427, 
Operator qualification and certification 
and proposed § 1926.1430, Training. 
Other provisions, such as those for 
safety devices and operational aids 
(proposed § 1926.1415 and § 1926.1416), 
and the requirement for periodic 
inspections in proposed § 1926.1412, 
will also reduce the number of this type 
of accident. 

Protection against falling from 

equipment is addressed by proposed 
§ 1926.1423, Fall protection. That 
section would require new equipment to 
provide safe access to the operator work 
station by the use of devices such as 
steps, handholds, and grabrails. Certain 
new lattice boom equipment would 
have to be equipped with boom 
walkways. There are also fall protection 
provisions tailored to assembly and 
disassembly work and to other work. 
Proposed § 1926.1431, Hoisting 
personnel, addresses fall protection 
when employees are being hoisted. 
OSHA has investigated numerous 

equipment accidents that have resulted 
in fatalities from the causes listed in the 
Beavers and Suruda studies. Below is a 
discussion of examples from OSHA’s 
IMIS accident investigation reports from 
recent years that illustrate some of the 
types of accidents that occur when 
using the types of equipment covered by

this proposed standard and the ways 
that this proposed standard would 
prevent such incidents. These examples 
illustrate the limitations of the current 
standard and highlight the need for a 
revised standard that will address the 
causes of the equipment accidents that 
continue to kill and injure construction 
workers. 

1. February 16, 2004: 4 fatalities, 4 

injuries. A launching gantry collapsed 
and fatally injured 4 workers and sent 
4 other workers to the hospital. The 
launching gantry was being used to 
erect pre-cast concrete segments span by 
span. The manufacturer required that 
the rear legs and front legs be properly 
anchored to resist longitudinal and 
lateral forces that act on the launching 
gantry. The legs of the launching gantry 
were not properly anchored. (OSHA– 
2007–0066–0017). 

OSHA believes that this type of 

accident would be prevented by 
compliance with the provisions of this 
proposed standard for assembling 
equipment. Proposed § 1403 requires 
that equipment be assembled in 
compliance with manufacturer 
procedures or with alternative employer 
procedures (see proposed § 1406) 
designed, among other things, to 
prevent the equipment from collapsing. 
In addition, under proposed § 1404, 
assembly must be conducted under the 
supervision of a person who 
understands the hazards associated with 
an improperly assembled crane and is 
well-qualified to understand and 
comply with the proper assembly 
procedures. 

2. January 30, 2006. 1 fatality. An 

employee was crushed by the lower end 
section of the lattice boom on a truck 
mounted crane while working from a 
position underneath the boom to 
remove the 2nd lower pin. When the 
2nd lower pin was removed the 
unsecured/uncribbed boom fell on the 
employee. (OSHA–2007–0066–0017.1) 

Proposed § 1926.1404(f) would 

prevent this type of accident by 
generally prohibiting employees from 
being under the boom when pins are 
removed. In situations where site 
constraints require an employee to be 
under the boom when pins are removed, 
the employer must implement other 
procedures, such as ensuring that the 
boom sections are adequately 
supported, to prevent the sections from 
falling onto the employee. 

3. July 23, 2001: 1 fatality. Employee 
failed to extend the outriggers before he 
extended the boom of a service truck 
crane to lift up some pipes. As he 
extended his boom, the crane tipped 
over on its side and an employee was 
struck on the head by the hook block as

he stood near the rear of the truck. 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0017.10) 

This type of accident would be 

prevented by compliance with proposed 
§ 1926.1404(q), which contains several 
provisions designed to ensure that 
outriggers are deployed properly before 
lifting a load. In addition, the operator 
qualification and certification 
requirement of proposed § 1926.1427, 
which is intended to ensure that 
operators understand and follow the 
safety requirements for the equipment 
they are operating, would help prevent 
this type of accident. 

4. March 8, 1999. 1 fatality. Some 

employees were using a mobile crane to 
maneuver a load of steel joists. The 
crane contacted a 7,200-volt overhead 
power line, electrocuting an employee 
who was signaling and guiding the load. 
The crane operator jumped clear and 
was not injured. (OSHA–2007–0066– 
0017.11) 

Section 1926.1408 includes 

provisions that would prevent this type 
of accident. First, it would require the 
use of ‘‘encroachment prevention’’ 
measures designed to prevent the crane 
from breaching a safe clearance distance 
from the power line. Second, if tag lines 
are used to guide the load, they would 
have to be non-conductive. Third, if 
maintaining the normal clearance 
distance were infeasible, a number of 
additional measures would have to be 
used. One of those additional measures 
is the use of an insulating link between 
the end of the load line and the load. 
These measures would protect the 
employee guiding the load in several 
ways, including the following: First, 
they would reduce the chance that the 
crane would come into electrical contact 
with the power line. Second, if the 
employee were using a tag line to guide 
the load, it would have to be non- 
conductive, which would protect the 
employee if the load became energized. 

If the crane were intentionally 
operated closer than the normal 
clearance distance, and the employer 
complied with the additional protective 
measures required in that circumstance, 
an insulating link would be in place. In 
such a case, even if there was a failure 
of the encroachment prevention 
measures and electrical contact resulted, 
the insulating link would prevent the 
load from becoming energized and 
prevent the employee guiding the load 
from being electrocuted. 

5. August 21, 2003. 3 fatalities. A 

crane operator and two co-workers were 
electrocuted when a truck crane’s 
elevated boom contacted a 7,200 Volt 
uninsulated primary conductor 31 feet 
from the ground. When the operator 
stepped from the cab of the truck he 

created a conduction pathway to the 
ground through his right hand and right 
foot, causing him to be electrocuted. A 
co-worker attempted to revive the 
incapacitated crane operator with 
cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (‘‘CPR’’) 
while a third co-worker contacted 911 
and returned to the incident location. 
When the third co-worker 
simultaneously touched the energized 
truck crane and the back of his co- 
worker performing CPR, the resulting 
pathway created a conduction pathway 
through the workers, electrocuting them 
all. (OSHA–2007–0066–0017.12). 
This type of accident would be 
avoided by compliance with the 
proposed rule. First, as explained in the 
previous electrocution accident 
examples, proposed § 1926.1408 is 
designed to ensure that a minimum safe 
distance from the power line is 
maintained, which would prevent the 
equipment from becoming energized. 
Also, when working closer than the 
normal minimum clearance distance, 
the crane would have to be grounded; 
that would reduce the chance of an 
electrical pathway through the 
employees in this type of scenario. 

In addition, proposed § 1926.1408(g) 
would require the operator to be trained 
to remain inside the cab unless there is 
imminent danger of fire or explosion. 
The operator must also be trained in the 
danger of simultaneously touching the 
equipment and the ground, as he did in 
this case, and in the safest means of 
evacuating the equipment. The crane’s 
remaining crew must be trained to avoid 
approaching or touching the equipment. 
The required training would be 
reinforced by the electrocution warnings 
that must be posted in the cab and on 
the outside of the equipment. 

6. September 28, 1999: 1 fatality. A 

19-year old electrical instrument helper 
was at a construction site that was on a 
manufacturing company’s property. 
That morning a contractor had 
positioned a 50-ton hydraulic crane in 
an open area that consisted of 
compacted fill material. This was the 
only location that the crane could be 
situated because the receiving area for 
the equipment was very close to the 
property border. The crane was moving 
large sections of piping to a new 
location when it overturned and struck 
the helper. 

The crane’s outriggers were set but 

matting was placed only under the 
northwest outrigger pad. At the start of 
the construction project, the 
manufacturing company cleared the site 
and had fill material brought in. The site 
was originally swamp and large 
amounts of fill had been brought in. 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0017.13).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Proposed § 1926.1402, Ground 

conditions, is designed to prevent this 
type of accident. Under that paragraph, 
care must be taken to ensure that the 
surface on which a crane is operating is 
sufficiently level and firm to support the 
crane in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s specifications. A 
contributing factor to this accident may 
have been a lack of clarity regarding 
responsibility for adequate ground 
conditions due to the fact that the 
employer who operated the crane did 
not control the ground conditions on the 
property. 

Section 1926.1402 would impose 

specific duties on both the entity 
responsible for the project (the 
controlling entity) and the entity 
operating the crane to ensure that the 
crane is adequately supported. It places 
responsibility for ensuring that the 
ground conditions are adequate on the 
controlling entity while also making the 
employer operating the crane 
responsible for calling any deficiency to 
the controlling entity’s attention and 
having it corrected before using the 
crane. 

7. June 17, 2006: 1 fatality. A crane 
was being used on a barge to install a 
dock in a waterway. Employees were 
preparing to move the barge. A spud 
pipe, which anchored the barge, was 
being raised by the barge-mounted crane 
when the hoisting cable broke, dropping 
the headache ball and rigging onto one 
of the employees. (OSHA–2007–0066– 
0017.3). 

This type of accident can have various 

causes. An incorrectly selected wire 
rope (one that has insufficient capacity), 
use of a wire rope that is damaged or 
worn to the point where it needs to be 
replaced, or two-blocking, in which the 
headache ball is forced against the 
upper block, can each cause this type of 
failure. The provisions of proposed 
§§ 1926.1413 and 1414 on wire rope 
inspection, selection, and installation 
are designed to ensure that appropriate 
wire rope is installed, inspected and 
removed from service when its 
continued use would be unsafe. Section 
1926.1416, Operational aids, contains 
provisions designed to protect against 
two-blocking. 

8. July 13, 1999: 3 fatalities. Three 

employees were in a personnel basket 
280 feet above the ground. They were in 
the process of guiding a large roof 
section, being lifted by another crane, 
into place. Winds gusting to 27 miles 
per hour overloaded the crane holding 
the roof section; that crane collapsed, 
striking the crane that was supporting 
the personnel basket, causing the boom 
to fall. All three employees received 
fatal crushing injuries. (OSHA–2007–

0066–0017.4 & OSHA–2007–0066– 
0018). 

This type of accident would be 

prevented by compliance with proposed 
§ 1926.1417(n), which requires the 
competent person in charge of the 
operation to consider the effect of wind 
and other adverse weather conditions 
on the equipment’s stability and rated 
capacity. In addition, proposed 
§ 1926.1431, Hoisting personnel, 
requires that when wind speed 
(sustained or gust) exceeds 20 mph, 
personnel are prohibited from being 
hoisted by a crane unless a qualified 
person determines it is safe to do so. 
9. November 7, 2005: 1 fatality. A 

construction worker was crushed 
between the outrigger and the rotating 
superstructure of a truck crane. He 
apparently tried to retrieve a level and 
a set of blueprints which were laying on 
the horizontal member of one of the 
outriggers at the same time the operator 
began to swing the boom. (OSHA–2007– 
0066–0017.5). 

This type of accident would be 

avoided by compliance with proposed 
§ 1926.1424, Work area control. That 
section generally requires that 
employers erect barriers to mark the 
area covered by the rotating 
superstructure to warn workers of that 
danger zone. In addition, employees 
who must work near equipment with a 
rotating superstructure must be trained 
in the hazards involved. If an employee 
must enter the marked area, the crane 
operator must be alerted and not rotate 
the superstructure until the area is clear. 

10. March 19, 2005: 2 fatalities and 1 
injury. During steel erection operations, 
a crane was lifting three steel beams to 
a parking garage under construction. 
The crane tipped over and the boom 
collapsed. The boom and attached 
beams struck concrete workers next to 
the structure. Two were killed and one 
injured. The accident apparently 
occurred as a result of overloading the 
crane. (OSHA–2007–0066–0017.6). 

Overloading a crane can cause it to tip 

over. When it does, the load or crane 
structure can strike and fatally injure 
workers who may be some distance 
from the crane. Proposed § 1926.1417, 
Operations, includes provisions 
designed to prevent overloading. That 
section prohibits the equipment from 
being operated in excess of its rated 
capacity and includes procedures for 
ensuring that the weight of the load is 
reliably determined and within the 
equipment’s rated capacity. 

The provisions on operator training 

and certification/qualification will also 
help prevent this type of accident by 
ensuring that the operator is sufficiently 
knowledgeable and skilled in 

recognizing conditions that would 
overload the crane. 

11. December 7, 2005. 1 fatality. Two 

cranes were being used to lower a 
concrete beam across the river. During 
the lowering process, the west side of 
the beam became lower than the east 
side. The consequent shifting of the 
load’s weight to the west side crane 
caused that crane to tip over. The west 
end of the beam went into the river and 
the east end fell on the bank and a 
support mat, causing a flag person to be 
thrown into the beam. (OSHA–2007– 
0066–0017.7). 

This type of accident would be 

prevented by compliance with proposed 
§ 1926.1432, Multiple crane/derrick lifts. 
That section specifies that when more 
than one crane will be supporting a 
load, the operation must be performed 
in accordance with a plan developed by 
a qualified person. The plan must be 
designed to ensure that the 
requirements of this proposed standard 
will be met and must be reviewed with 
all individuals who will be involved in 
the process. Moreover, the lift must be 
supervised by an individual who 
qualifies as both a competent person 
and a qualified person as defined in this 
standard. 

In the type of scenario involved in 

this accident, a plan that would comply 
with this requirement would, for 
example, include a determination of the 
degree of level that is needed to be 
maintained in order to prevent either 
crane from being overloaded. In 
addition, such a plan would include a 
system of communications and a means 
of monitoring the operation designed to 
ensure that the cranes’ operation was 
properly coordinated. 

12. May 7, 2004: 1 fatality. An 

employee, a rigger/operator-in-training, 
was in the upper cab of a 60-ton 
hydraulic boom truck crane to set up 
and position the crane boom prior to a 
lift. The crane was equipped with two 
hoists, a main line and auxiliary. The 
main hoist line had a multi-sheave 
block and hook and the auxiliary line 
had a 285 pound ball and hook. When 
the employee was extending the 
hydraulic boom, a two-block condition 
occurred with the auxiliary line ball 
striking the auxiliary sheave head, 
knocking the sheave and ball from the 
boom. The employee was struck in the 
head and killed by the falling ball. 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0017.8). 

This type of accident would be 

prevented by compliance with proposed 
§ 1926.1416, Operational aids, which 
requires protection against two- 
blocking. A hydraulic boom crane, if 
manufactured after February 28, 1992, 
would have to be equipped with a

device that automatically prevents two- 
blocking. 

Also, the operator-in-training in this 

case apparently did not understand that 
extending a hydraulic boom would 
move the sheave head toward the ball 
and could cause two-blocking. The 
proposed standard, through proposed 
§ 1926.1427(a) and (f), would avoid 
having inexperienced operators make 
this type of mistake by prohibiting an 
operator-in-training from operating a 
crane without supervision and without 
first having had enough training to 
enable the operator to perform the 
assigned task safely. 

13. April 26, 2006: One fatality. The 

deceased employee was part of a 
framing crew which was in the process 
of installing sheathing for a roof. A 
bundle of plywood sheathing was being 
hoisted by a crane to a location on the 
roof. As the crane was positioning the 
bundle of sheathing above its landing 
location, the load hoist on the crane free 
spooled, causing an uncontrolled 
descent of the load. The employee was 
under the load, preparing to position it 
to its landing spot, when the load fell 
and crushed him. (OSHA–2007–0066– 
0017.9). 

Economic Analysis, OSHA finds that 
construction workers suffer 89 fatal 
injuries per year from the types of 
equipment covered by this proposed 
standard. Of that number, OSHA 
estimates that 53 would be avoided by 

This type of accident would be 

prevented by compliance with 
§ 1926.1426, Free fall and controlled 
load lowering, which prohibits free fall 
of the load line hoist and requires 
controlled load lowering when an 
employee is directly under the load. 

As discussed below in the Preliminary 

compliance with the proposed standard. 
In addition, OSHA estimates that the 
proposed standard would prevent 155 
non-fatal injuries each year. Based on all 
of the available evidence and on the 
collective expertise of the members of 
C–DAC, OSHA preliminarily finds that 
construction workers are faced with a 
significant risk of death and injury 
resulting from equipment operations 
and that the risk would be substantially 
reduced by compliance with this 
proposed standard. 

During the SBREFA process, several 
Small Entity Representatives expressed 
concern that the C–DAC proposal was 
so long and complex that small 
businesses would have difficulty 
understanding it and complying with it. 
The SBREFA Panel recommended that 
OSHA solicit public comment on how 
the rule could be simplified and made 
easier to understand without creating 
ambiguities. OSHA welcomes public 
comment on this issue. 
III. The SBREFA Process 

Before proceeding with a proposed 
rule based on the C–DAC Consensus 
Document, OSHA was required to 
comply with the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (SBREFA). 
This required OSHA to draft an initial 
regulatory flexibility analysis that 
would evaluate the potential impact of 
the rule on small entities (defined as 
small businesses, small governmental 
units, and small nonprofit 
organizations) and identify the type of 
small entities that might be affected by 
the rule. In accordance with SBREFA, 
OSHA then convened a Small Business 
Advocacy Review Panel (‘‘Panel’’) 
composed of representatives of OSHA, 

the Office of Management and Budget, 
and the Office of Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration. Individuals 
who were representative of affected 
small entities (Small Entity 
Representatives, or ‘‘SERs’’) were then 
identified for the purpose of obtaining 
advice and recommendations from those 
individuals about the potential impacts 
of the proposed rule. 

OSHA provided the SERs with the C– 
DAC consensus document and the draft 
regulatory flexibility analysis and 
afforded them the opportunity to submit 
written comments on those documents. 
The Agency also drafted questions 
asking them their views on the specific 
aspects of the C–DAC document it 
thought would be of most concern to 
small entities. 

The Panel conducted two conference 
calls with the SERs in which the SERs 
presented their views on various issues. 
After reviewing the SERs’ oral and 
written comments, on October 17, 2006, 
the Panel submitted its report 
summarizing the requirements of the 
C–DAC proposal, the comments 
received from the SERs, and presenting 
its findings and recommendations. 
(OSHA–S030A–2006–0664–0019). In its 
findings and recommendations, the 
Panel identified issues that it believed 
needed particular attention and analysis 
in the proposal or for which it believed 
OSHA should explicitly solicit public 
comment. 

In the discussion that follows, OSHA 

addresses each of the Panel’s findings 
and recommendations in the section 
pertaining to the issue involved. Table 
4 summarizes the Panel’s 
recommendations and the portions of 
this preamble in which they are 
discussed. 

TABLE 4—SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS AND OSHA RESPONSES 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The Panel recommends that OSHA provide full documentation for how 
it  estimated  the  number  of  affected  small  entities  and  all  other  cal-
culations and estimates provided in the PIRFA.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  reexamine  its  estimate  of  crane 
use  in  home  building,  the  coverage  of  crane  trucks  used  for  loading 
and  unloading,  and  the  estimates  of  the  number  of  jobs  per  crane. 
Changes  in  these  estimates  should  be  incorporated  into  the  esti-
mates of costs and economic impacts.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  review  its  estimates  for  the  direct 
costs  of  operator  certification  and  seek  comment  on  these  cost  esti-
mates.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  carefully  examine  certain  types  of 
impact that could result from an operator certification requirement, in-
cluding  reports  of  substantial  increases  in  the  wages  of  operators; 
the possibility of increased market power for firms renting out cranes; 
and  loss  of  jobs  for  existing  operators  due  to  language,  literacy,  or 
knowledge problems; and seek comment on these types of impacts.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  studying  the  impacts  of 

the implementation of operator certification in California.

TABLE 4—SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS AND OSHA RESPONSES—Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  reexamine  its  estimates  for  the 
amount of time required to assess ground conditions, the number of 
persons involved in the assessment, and the amount of coordination 
involved;  clarify  the  extent  to  which  such  assessments  are  currently 
being  conducted  and  what  OSHA  estimates  as  new  costs  for  this 
rule represent; and seek comments on OSHA’s cost estimates.

The Panel recommends that OSHA carefully review the documentation 
requirements  of  the  standard,  including  documentation  that  employ-
ers  may  consider  it  prudent  to  maintain;  estimate  the  costs  of  such 
requirements;  seek  ways  of  minimizing  these  costs  consistent  with 
the  goals  of  the  OSH  Act;  and  solicit  comment  on  these  costs  and 
ways of minimizing these costs.

The Panel recommends that OSHA examine whether the inspection re-
quirements  of  the  proposed  rule  require  procedures  not  normally 
conducted  currently,  such  as  lowering  and  fully  extending  the  boom 
before  the  crane  can  be  used  and  removing  non-hinged  inspection 
plates  during  the  shift  inspection,  estimate  the  costs  of  any  such  re-
quirements, and seek comment on these issues.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  the  costs  of  meeting  the 
requirements  for  original  load  charts  and  full  manuals,  and  solicit 
comments on such costs.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  provide  full  documentation  for  its 
analysis of the benefits the proposed rule is expected to produce and 
assure that the benefits analysis is reproducible by others.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment on whether the scope language should be clarified to explicitly 
state  whether  forklifts  that  are  modified  to  perform  tasks  similar  to 
equipment  (cranes  and  derricks)  modified  in  that  manner  would  be 
covered.

The Panel recommends that there be a full explanation in the preamble 
of  how  responsibility  for  ensuring  adequate  ground  conditions  is 
shared  between  the  controlling  entity,  and  the  employer  of  the  indi-
vidual supervising assembly/disassembly and/or the operator.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  restate  the  applicable  corrective 
action  provisions  (which  are  set  forth  in  the  shift  inspection)  in  the 
monthly inspection section.

The Panel recommends that OSHA solicit public comment on whether, 
and under what circumstances, booming down should be specifically 
excluded  as  a  part  of  the  shift  inspection,  and  whether  the  removal 
of  non-hinged  inspection  plates  should  be  required  during  the  shift 
inspection.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  whether 
to  include  an  exception  for  transportation  systems  in  proposed 
§ 1926.1412(a),  which  requires  an  inspection  of  equipment  that  has 
had  modifications  or  additions  that  affect  its  safe  operation,  and,  if 
so, what the appropriate terminology for such an exception would be.
The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  explain  in  the  preamble  that  the 
shift inspection does not need to be completed prior to each shift but 
may be completed during the shift.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  about 
whether  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  the  requirement  of  proposed 
§ 1926.1412(d)(1)(xi) that the equipment be inspected for ‘‘level posi-
tion’’.

See  the  Preliminary  Economic  Analysis  (PEA),  in  section  V.B.  of  this 

Federal Register notice. 

The  Agency  describes  the  documentation  requirements,  along  with 
cost estimates, in the section of this Preamble entitled ‘‘OMB Review 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.’’ 

As  explained  in  the  discussion  of  § 1926.1412,  Inspections,  OSHA’s 
current standard at 29 CFR 1926.550 requires inspections each time 
the equipment is used as well as thorough annual inspections. In ad-
dition,  national  consensus  standards  that  are  incorporated  by  ref-
erence  include  additional  inspection  requirements.  This  proposal 
would  list  the  inspection  requirements  in  one  place  rather  than  rely 
on  incorporated  consensus  standards.  OSHA  does  not  believe  this 
proposed  standard  imposes  significant  new  requirements  for  inspec-
tions. Section 1926.1413(a) explicitly says that booming down is not 
required for shift (and therefore monthly) inspections. 

Similarly, OSHA does not believe that inspection of any of those items 
would require removal of non-hinged inspection plates. In the discus-
sion  of  proposed  § 1926.1412,  OSHA  requests  public  comment  on 
these points. 

Currently,  Subpart  N,  at  29  CFR  1926.550(a)(2),  requires  load  charts, 
so  that  is  not  a  new  cost.  Subpart  N  does  not  require  manuals. 
OSHA  believes  that  most  crane  owners  and  operators  have  and 
maintain crane manuals, which contain the load charts and other crit-
ical  technical  information  about  crane  operations  and  maintenance. 
The  Agency  believes  that  the  cost  of  obtaining  a  copy  of  a  manual 
should be modest and solicits comment on how many owners or op-
erators do not have full manuals for their cranes or derricks. 

See  the  Preliminary  Economic  Analysis  (PEA),  in  section  V.B.  of  this 

Federal Register notice. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

§ 1926.1400(c)(8) and solicits public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  explains  in  the  discussion  of  proposed  § 1926.1402(e)  how  the 
various  employers,  including  the  controlling  entity,  the  employer 
whose  employees  operate  the  equipment,  and  the  employer  of  the 
A/D  supervisor  share  responsibility  for  ensuring  adequate  ground 
conditions.

TABLE 4—SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS AND OSHA RESPONSES—Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  comment  on  whether 
§ 1926.1412(f)(2)(xii)(D)  should  be  changed  to  require  that  pressure 
be inspected ‘‘at the end of the line,’’ as distinguished from ‘‘at each 
and  every  line,’’  and  if  so,  what  the  best  terminology  would  be  to 
meet  this  purpose.  (An  SER  indicated  that  proposed  paragraph 
(f)(2)(xiv)(D)  of  § 1926.1412  should  be  modified  to  ‘‘checking  pres-
sure setting,’’ in part to avoid having to check the pressure at ‘‘each 
and every line’’ as opposed to ‘‘at the end of the line.’’).

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  whether 
proposed  paragraph  (f)(2)(xx)  of  § 1926.1412  should  be  deleted  be-
cause  an  SER  believes  that  it  is  not  always  appropriate  to  retain 
originally  equipped  steps  and  ladders,  such  as  in  instances  where 
they are replaced with ‘‘attaching dollies.’’.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  the  ex-
tent of documentation of monthly and annual/comprehensive inspec-
tions the rule should require.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  whether 
the provision for monthly inspections should, like the provision for an-
nual  inspections,  specify  who  must  keep  the  documentation  associ-
ated with monthly inspections.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  ways  to  account  for  the 
possibility that there may sometimes be an extended delay in obtain-
ing  the  part  number  for  an  operational  aid  for  older  equipment  and 
solicit public comment on the extent to which this is a problem.

The  Panel  recommends  that  the  provision  on  fall  protection  (proposed 
§ 1926.1423)  be  proposed  as  written  and  that  OSHA  explain  in  the 
preamble how and why the Committee arrived at this provision.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  the  potential  advantages 
of  and  solicit  public  comment  on  adding  provisions  to  proposed 
§ 1926.1427  that  would  allow  an  operator  to  be  certified  on  a  par-
ticular  model  of  crane;  allow  tests  to  be  administered  by  an  accred-
ited educational institution; and allow employers to use manuals that 
have  been  re-written  to  accommodate  the  literacy  level  and  English 
proficiency of operators.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  clarify  in  the  preamble  how  the 
proposed  rule  addresses  an  SER’s  concern  that  his  crane  operator 
would  not  be  able  to  pass  a  written  qualification/certification  exam 
because the operator has difficulty in taking written exams.

There is no proposed requirement to check the pressure ‘‘at each and

checked  for  failure  to  reach  correct  pressure.  If  this  can  be  done  at 
one  point  for  the  entire  system,  then  that  would  satisfy  the  require-

mine  whether  that  deficiency  is  a  safety  hazard  requiring  immediate 
correction.  If  the  inspection  reveals  that  original  equipment,  such  as 
stairs and ladders, have been replaced with something equally safe, 
there  would  be  no  safety  hazard  and  no  requirement  for  corrective 
action.

and nature of operations.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  ask  for  public  com-
ment  as  to  whether  the  supervisor  responsible  for  oversight  for  an 
operator  in  the  pre-qualification  period  (§ 1926.1427(f))  should  have 
additional  training  beyond  that  required  in  the  C–DAC  document  at 
proposed § 1926.1427(f)(2)(iii)(B).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

TABLE 4—SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS AND OSHA RESPONSES—Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The  Panel  recommends  OSHA  solicit  comment  on  whether  there  are 
qualified  persons  in  the  field  with  the  necessary  expertise  to  assess 
how  the  rated  capacity  for  land  cranes  and  derricks  used  on  barges 
and other flotation devices needs to be modified as required by pro-
posed § 1926.1437(n)(2).

The Panel also recommends that OSHA solicit comment on whether it 
is  necessary,  from  a  safety  standpoint,  to  apply  this  provision  to 
cranes used only for duty cycle work, and if so, why that is the case, 
and how ‘‘duty cycle work’’ should be defined.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  ask  for  comment  on 
whether  it  would  be  appropriate  to  exempt  from  the  rule  small  side 
boom cranes incapable of lifting above the height of a truck bed and 
with a capacity of not more than 6,000 pounds.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  how  the 
proposed  rule  could  be  simplified  (without  creating  ambiguities)  and 
made easier to understand. (Several SERs believed that the C–DAC 
document  was  so  long  and  complex  that  small  businesses  would 
have difficulty understanding it and complying with it.).

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  outlining  the  inspection 
requirements  in  spreadsheet  form  in  an  Appendix  or  developing 
some  other  means  to  help  employers  understand  what  inspections 
are needed and when they must be done.

The Panel recommends that OSHA consider whether use of the words 
‘‘determine’’  and  ‘‘demonstrate’’  would  mandate  that  the  employer 
keep  records  of  such  determinations  and  if  records  would  be  re-
quired to make such demonstrations.

The Panel recommends soliciting public comment on whether the word 
‘‘days’’ as used in §§ 1926.1416(d) and 1926.1416(e) should be clari-
fied to mean calendar days or business days.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  carefully  discuss  what  is  included 

and excluded from the scope of this standard.

The Panel recommends that OSHA gather data and analyze the effects 

of already existing certification requirements.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  excluding  and  soliciting 
comment on whether equipment used solely to deliver materials to a 
construction  site  by  placing/stacking  the  materials  on  the  ground 
should be explicitly excluded from the proposed standard’s scope.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  should  consider  the  information 
and range of opinions that were presented by the SERs on the issue 
of  operator  qualification/certification  when  analyzing  the  public  com-
ments on this issue.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment on expanding the levels of certification so as to allow an oper-
ator to be certified on a specific brand’s model of crane.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment  on  expanding  the  levels  of  operator  qualification/certification  to 
allow  an  operator  to  be  certified  for  a  specific,  limited  type  of  cir-
cumstance.  Such  a  circumstance  would  be  defined  by  a  set  of  pa-
rameters that, taken together, would describe an operation character-
ized by simplicity and relatively low risk. The Agency should consider 
and solicit comment on whether such parameters could be identified 
in a way that would result in a clear, easily understood provision that 
could be effectively enforced.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment  on  allowing  the  written  and  practical  tests  described  in  Option 
(1)  of  § 1926.1427(b)  to  be  administered  by  an  accredited  edu-
cational institution.

The Panel recommends that OSHA solicit public comment on making it 
clear  that:  (1)  an  employer  is  permitted  to  equip  its  cranes  with 
manuals  re-written  in  a  way  that  would  allow  an  operator  with  a  low 
literacy  level  to  understand  the  material  (such  as  substituting  some 
text with pictures and illustrations), and (2) making it clear that, when 
the cranes are equipped with such re-written manuals and materials, 
the ‘‘manuals’’ and ‘‘materials’’ referred to in these literacy provisions 
would be the re-written manuals.

OSHA  addresses  these  recommendations  in  the  discussion  of  pro-
posed  § 1926.1437(n)(2)  and  requests  public  comment  on  the 
issues. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 
paragraph  § 1926.1440(a)  and  requests  public  comment  on  the 
issue. 

The length and comprehensiveness of the standard is an issue for this 
rulemaking.  OSHA  requests  comment  on  how  and  whether  the  pro-
posal  can  be  shortened  or  simplified—made  easier  to  understand— 
and the effect of that on addressing construction hazards. 

OSHA  will  consider  developing  such  an  aid  as  a  separate  guidance 

document. 

Some  SERs  requested  clarification  as  to  when  documentation  was  re-
quired, believing that the document implicitly requires documentation 
when it states that the employer must ‘‘determine’’ or ‘‘demonstrate’’ 
certain things. OSHA notes that it cannot cite an employer for failing 
to  have  documentation  not  explicitly  called  for  in  a  standard.  See 
also the discussion under proposed § 1926.1402(e). 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

§ 1926.1416(d) and requests public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  discusses  in  detail  the  types  of  machinery  that  are  included 
under this proposed standard and those that are excluded in the ex-
planation of § 1926.1400. 

OSHA has obtained and evaluated a study by the Construction Safety 
Association  of  Ontario  showing  that  Ontario’s  certification  require-
ment  has  led  to  a  substantial  decrease  in  crane-related  fatalities 
there. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

§ 1926.1400(c) and requests public comment on the issue. 

The  information  and  opinions  submitted  by  the  SERs  are  part  of  the 
record  for  this  rulemaking,  and  OSHA  will  consider  them  along  with 
the other public comments on the proposed rule.

TABLE 4—SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS AND OSHA RESPONSES—Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  explain  in  a  Small  Business  Com-
pliance Guide that the certification/qualification test does not need to 
be  administered  in  English  but  can  be  administered  in  a  language 
that the candidate can read; and that while the employee would also 
need to have a sufficient level of literacy to read and understand the 
relevant  information  in  the  equipment  manual,  that  requirement 
would be satisfied if the material is written in a language that the em-
ployee can read and understand.

OSHA  will  issue  a  Small  Business  Compliance  Guide  after  a  final  rule 

is issued and will explain these points in the Guide. 

IV. Summary and Explanation of the 
Proposed Standard 

The following discussion summarizes 

and explains each provision in the 
proposal and the substantive differences 
between the proposal and OSHA’s 
current standard for cranes and derricks 
at 29 CFR 1926.550, which is located in 
Subpart N of OSHA’s standards for 
construction work. In the discussion, 
OSHA explains corrections and 
clarifications it has made to the 
language in the C–DAC Document. The 
Agency also identifies other areas in the 
C–DAC Document it believes could 
benefit from modifications to the 
C–DAC language and asks for public 
comment on the need for such changes 
and, in some instances, the 
appropriateness of particular clarifying 
language. 
Section 1400 Scope 

Paragraphs (a) through (d) of proposed 

§ 1926.1400 set forth the scope of the 
proposed rule. Proposed paragraphs (a) 
through (c) describe, respectively, what 
equipment is included, the application 
of the standard to equipment used with 
attachments, and specific exclusions. 
Combining a Functional Description 
With a List of Covered Equipment 

Proposed paragraph (a) provides a 
functional definition of the covered 
equipment as well as a non-exclusive 
list of what is covered. C–DAC 
considered choosing between these 
approaches, but ultimately decided to 
use a combination of the two. The 
Committee also agreed that equipment 
listed in this proposed paragraph should 
be defined; these definitions, among 
others, are set forth in § 1926.1401, 
Definitions. It should be noted that the 
scope of some of the listed equipment 
is further delineated in the section of 
the standard that specifically relates to 
that equipment (for example, 
§ 1926.1436, Derricks and § 1926.1438, 
Overhead & Gantry Cranes). OSHA 
believes that this format strikes an 
appropriate balance between clarity and 
avoiding unintended limitations that 
might eliminate new and/or other

existing technology that is similar to the 
listed examples. 

The decision to propose a functional 
definition with a non-exclusive list of 
covered equipment followed 
considerable discussion. The Committee 
settled on a definition that focuses on 
the equipment’s elemental functions— 
hoisting, lowering, and horizontally 
moving a suspended load. The goal of 
this definition is to cover both existing 
and new technologies that share those 
same functions. Committee members 
rejected using just a list of equipment 
because: (1) Even the most 
comprehensive list might inadvertently 
omit existing technologies, and (2) they 
wanted to provide leeway in the scope 
for applying the new standard to future 
technologies. 

On the other hand, C–DAC decided 

against a functional definition alone 
because that might include equipment 
that the standard was not designed to 
address (for example, equipment that 
poses a different set of hazards than 
those addressed by the standard). The 
list provides a context in which to apply 
the functional definition. The Agency 
believes that this hybrid approach 
addresses C–DAC’s concerns. 
Dedicated Pile Drivers 

The Committee quickly agreed to 

include most of the items on the non- 
exclusive list. However, several items 
were included only after considerable 
debate. For example, C–DAC’s decision 
to include dedicated pile drivers 
followed much discussion, including a 
panel presentation. The panel was 
comprised of a manufacturer, 
represented by Ahti Knopp and Pentti 
Heinonen, President, of Junttan, as well 
as a user, represented by Pat Karinen 
and Dan Kuhs, of Pile Drivers Local 
Union 34 and 56. The focus of the 
discussion was whether to include 
machinery that fell outside what the 
industry traditionally considered to be a 
crane or derrick covered by existing 
Subpart N. 

Although the manufacturer’s 

representatives stated that they did not 
consider their equipment to be cranes, 

they ultimately supported the inclusion 
of dedicated pile drivers in the 
proposed standard for several reasons. 
Specifically, they emphasized certain 
mechanical similarities and the need for 
timely regulation. However, they 
requested that the standard be adjusted 
to address the equipment’s unique 
characteristics. 

The users on the panel, citing the 

similarities in functional capabilities 
and hazards between dedicated pile 
drivers and cranes, also supported their 
inclusion. They were particularly 
concerned about the need to establish 
required inspections for dedicated pile 
drivers in view of the stress placed on 
this type of equipment. 

The Committee acknowledged the 
dilemma it faced in establishing the 
parameters of the proposed standard— 
including machines not typically 
described as cranes versus omitting 
machines similar in hazards and 
construction—but ultimately decided to 
include dedicated pile drivers. Prior to 
that decision, however, several members 
voiced concerns. 

For example, some members were 

worried that including these machines 
might encourage their ‘‘use as cranes,’’ 
that is, primarily for hoisting objects. 
The manufacturer representatives 
pointed out that while these machines 
are designed to hoist within a very 
limited range and capacity, it is 
inappropriate to use them for hoisting 
beyond those restricted limits. Others 
were concerned that some requirements 
in the proposed standard might be a 
‘‘bad fit’’ for these machines. In 
response to such concerns, the 
Committee included dedicated pile 
drivers but tailored the requirements of 
the standard to take into account the 
specific characteristics of such 
equipment. As a result, proposed 
§ 1439, Dedicated pile drivers, provides 
that most provisions of the standard 
apply to dedicated pile drivers but 
excludes some that the Committee 
believed were inappropriate for such 
equipment. 

OSHA believes that this approach is 

appropriate to propose because it

59728 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

provides a workable approach that 
addresses the unique aspects of the 
equipment. 
Multi-purpose Machines 

The concept of ‘‘multi-purpose 

machines’’ was discussed in depth. This 
term, as used in the proposed standard, 
refers to a relatively new type of 
equipment that is designed to be 
configured in a variety of ways to 
perform a variety of different types of 
functions. For example, during the 
discussion, C–DAC members noted that 
this type of machinery in one 
configuration works as an aerial forklift, 
and in another configuration works as a 
crane. 

The Agency believes that the 

Committee developed an appropriate 
approach to coverage of this equipment. 
Specifically, the Committee defined this 
category of equipment in § 1926.1401, 
Definitions, to cover only machinery 
‘‘designed to be configured in various 
ways’’ and has included it within the 
proposed scope of the standard only 
when configured ‘‘to hoist (by means of 
a winch or hook) and horizontally move 
a suspended load.’’ In short, a multi- 
purpose machine would only be 
covered by the proposed standard when 
configured as a crane. 

For example, a machine might be 

configured variously as a rough-terrain 
type forklift, work platform, or as a 
crane. Such a machine would only be 
covered by the proposed standard when 
configured as a crane. Conversely, a 
traditional rough-terrain forklift is 
originally designed solely as a forklift. 
Even if an employer suspends a load 
from its fork, it would still be 
configured (and can only be configured) 
as a rough terrain forklift. Such forklifts 
are not multi-purpose machines and 
would specifically be excluded from the 
standard’s coverage by proposed 
§ 1926.1400(c)(8). 

For the same reason, aerial lifts that 

may have an incidental capacity to hoist 
(by means of suspending loads from the 
boom) are not multi-purpose machines. 
Even aerial lifts that are equipped with 
a low capacity hoisting device (usually 
located at basket level) are not 
‘‘designed to be configured in various 
ways’’ and, as such, would not fall 
within the definition of a multi-purpose 
machine. Such aerial lifts are designed 
to be configured in only one way, that 
is, as an aerial lift. In fact, the provision 
that specifically excludes aerial lifts, 
proposed § 1926.1400(c)(5), emphasizes 
that point in its description of aerial lifts 
by saying ‘‘[e]quipment originally 
designed as vehicle-mounted aerial 
devices (for lifting personnel) * * *.’’

The Agency agrees with the 

Committee that it is appropriate to 
propose covering multi-purpose 
equipment in this proposed standard 
(when configured as a crane) to protect 
employees from the types of hazards 
that are associated with the other 
equipment included in the Scope. 
Other Listed Equipment 

Some members were concerned that 
proposing to include industrial cranes 
on the list would result in such cranes 
being covered by this proposed standard 
even when used in a factory/general 
industry setting. That is not the case— 
this proposed standard applies only to 
employers engaged in construction, and 
therefore would apply to such 
equipment only when used in 
construction. 

The Committee decided to cover side- 
boom cranes, which are included in the 
current Subpart N.1 Committee 
members noted that side-boom cranes 
(defined in proposed § 1926.1401, 
Definitions) share characteristics with 
cranes. One member also stated that the 
American Pipeline Association supports 
their inclusion. 

Additional machinery that is 

proposed to be covered that is either not 
currently covered or not specifically 
addressed by Subpart N include cranes 
on a monorail, luffing tower cranes, 
straddle cranes, pedestal cranes and 
shearleg derricks (see § 1926.1436, 
Derricks). Each of these meets the 
functional definition in the proposed 
standard and presents the same types of 
hazards. 
Attachments 

Proposed § 1926.1400(b) would 

establish that equipment otherwise 
covered by proposed § 1926.1400(a) 
would remain within the scope of the 
proposed standard when used with 
attachments that are either ‘‘crane- 
attached or suspended.’’ As defined in 
§ 1926.1401, an ‘‘attachment’’ is ‘‘any 
device that expands the range of tasks 
that can be done by the equipment. 
Examples include, but are not limited 
to: an auger, drill, magnet, pile-driver, 
and boom-attached personnel platform.’’ 
This definition reflects an inclusive 
approach with respect to the use of 
attachments. 

The Committee recognized that 

equipment using these attachments 
retain their fundamental nature as 
cranes, including most of the hazards 
typically associated with crane use. For 
example, hazards associated with 

1 29 CFR 1926.550(a)(18) of Subpart N requires 

sideboom cranes mounted on wheel or crawler 
tractors to meet the requirements of SAE J743a– 
1964. 

ground conditions, assembly/ 
disassembly and operation near power 
lines, as well as the importance of 
proper signaling, work area control, and 
operator knowledge and skill, remain 
the same while an attachment is in use. 
Consequently, the proposed standard as 
a whole is well suited to the use of this 
equipment with attachments. 

The ACCSH December 2002 work 

group document provided C–DAC with 
an initial list of possible attachments 
(hooks, magnets, grapples, clamshell 
buckets, orange peel buckets) to be 
covered by the new rule. (OSHA–2007– 
0066–0020). Committee members 
suggested the remaining examples. 

Whether the proposed rule should 
apply to a personnel platform that is 
pinned to the boom was the subject of 
considerable discussion. Such a 
personnel platform was the subject of a 
presentation to C–DAC by Dan Wolff of 
the National Crane Corporation. 
Currently, Subpart N explicitly 
addresses suspended personnel 
platforms but does not specifically 
mention boom-attached personnel 
platforms. The Committee confirmed in 
its discussions that installing a boom- 
attached personnel platform does not 
change the nature of the equipment to 
the type of aerial lift that is excluded by 
this proposed standard (see proposed 
§ 1926.1400(c)(5)). The Committee was 
concerned that a failure to specifically 
address this type of platform could 
result in confusion as to whether its use 
would be governed by this standard or 
by the aerial lift standard. C–DAC 
concluded that it was appropriate to 
explicitly include boom-attached 
personnel platforms in this standard. 

Committee members expressed some 

concern as to whether the use of such 
an attachment involves additional 
hazards not addressed in this proposed 
standard. The Agency is asking for 
public comment on whether there are 
additional requirements that should 
apply when using a personnel platform 
that is attached directly to the boom. 
Exclusions 

Proposed paragraph (c) lists 

machinery that is specifically excluded 
from the scope of the proposed rule. The 
Committee referenced a list in the 
ACCSH December 2002 work group 
document as a starting point for 
discussion (OSHA–2007–0066–0020). 
As a result of that discussion, 
modifications to that list were made. As 
discussed below, the Agency believes 
that the list in the proposed standard, in 
combination with proposed paragraphs 
(a) and (b), sets appropriate limits to the 
proposed standard’s scope.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59729 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1) states that 

machinery otherwise included under 
proposed § 1926.1400(a) but ‘‘converted 
or adapted for non-hoisting use’’ is 
excluded. Power shovels, excavators 
and concrete pumps are listed as 
nonexclusive examples of such 
‘‘conversions/adaptations’’ or modified 
machinery. 

The view of the Committee was that, 

in most cases, once machinery that 
would otherwise be included under 
proposed § 1926.1400(a) is converted or 
adapted for non-hoisting use, the 
configuration and nature of operation of 
the machinery is generally changed to 
the point where many of the proposed 
provisions would not be directly 
relevant to the hazards presented. In 
contrast, as discussed above, C–DAC 
believed that equipment used with 
‘‘crane-attached or suspended’’ 
attachments typically retain many of 
their original characteristics and the 
proposed provisions remain relevant. 

The Agency recognizes that there may 

be some instances where covered 
equipment used with an attachment is 
similar in purpose to machinery 
converted or adapted for non-hoisting 
use. For example, a crane with a drilling 
attachment will serve the same function 
as a machine converted to a dedicated 
drilling rig. Nonetheless, the Agency 
believes that the approach 
recommended by C–DAC and reflected 
in the proposed rule sets an appropriate 
dividing line between covered and 
excluded machinery. The crane’s 
hoisting mechanisms are mostly still 
present while the attachment is in use, 
and the crane’s hoisting capability will 
likely be called upon fully once the 
attachment is removed. Having the 
machine move in and out of coverage of 
the rule as attachments are put on and 
taken off would create significant 
confusion. Furthermore, most of the 
operational characteristics and hazards 
of the equipment remain the same while 
the attachment is in use. The Agency 
believes that, overall, this represents a 
sensible approach to setting the breadth 
and limits of the proposed standard. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2) contains a 

specific list of excluded material 
handling machinery. This provision 
reflects C–DAC’s decision to name 
specific material handling machinery 
that is excluded rather than simply 
reference ‘‘material handling 
machinery’’ as a generic basis for 
exclusion. The Committee indicated 
that a generic exclusion based upon 
material handling would be too broad. 
For example, a crane, when equipped 
with a clamshell bucket, is used for 
material handling, and C–DAC believed

such equipment should be covered by 
the proposed standard. 

C–DAC also agreed to a Committee 

member’s suggestion of specifying that 
the listed machinery is excluded even 
when used with rigging to lift 
suspended loads. C–DAC acknowledged 
that some of the hazards of using this 
material handling machinery in this 
way are similar to the hazards 
associated with equipment covered by 
the proposed rule. However, the 
Committee also believed the differences 
between the covered equipment and the 
material handling machinery is such 
that one standard could not be readily 
designed to suit both. It should be noted 
that another construction standard, 29 
CFR 1926.602 in subpart O—Motor 
Vehicles, Mechanized Equipment, and 
Marine Operations, covers material 
handling equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3) excludes 
automotive wreckers and tow trucks 
‘‘when used to clear wrecks and haul 
vehicles.’’ A Committee member, citing 
C–DAC’s focus on construction 
activities, questioned the need for this 
provision. In response, another member 
explained that some of these vehicles 
have substantial hoisting capacity. The 
implication of that observation is that 
these machines have the capability of 
hoisting construction material and so 
some construction employers may use 
them for that purpose. Consequently, C– 
DAC decided to cover them generally, 
but to exclude them when used for 
clearing wrecks and hauling vehicles. 
The exclusion is based on the 
Committee’s view that, even if done as 
a construction activity (which would be 
very rare), clearing wrecks and hauling 
vehicles is a highly repetitious, 
predictable type of operation that is 
sufficiently distinct from typical 
construction crane and derrick use to 
justify an exclusion from the proposed 
rule. It should be noted that ‘‘cranes 
designed for . . . automobile wreck 
clearance’’ are excluded from the scope 
of ASME B30.5–2004. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(4), 

service trucks with mobile lifting 
devices for use in the power line and 
electric service industries, such as 
digger derricks, are excluded when 
engaged in certain listed activities for 
those industries. This machinery is 
currently covered by Subpart N, with 
the exception of certain provisions, by 
virtue of § 1926.952(c). We note that 
ASME B30.5–2004 excludes digger 
derricks and ‘‘cranes manufactured 
specifically for, or when used for, 
energized electrical line service’’ from 
the scope of that industry consensus 
standard. 

C–DAC ultimately adopted this 
exclusion because of the narrow, 
specialized range of activities and 
circumstances in which such trucks are 
used. The Agency is asking for public 
comment as to whether such an 
exclusion is appropriate and whether 
safety problems would be created by 
excluding them from coverage under the 
proposed standard. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(5) specifically 
excludes machinery originally designed 
as vehicle mounted aerial lifts and self- 
propelled elevating work platforms. The 
language of this provision reflects C– 
DAC’s intent to differentiate between 
equipment with an attachment such as 
a personnel platform pinned to the 
boom, which is within the scope of the 
proposed rule, and machinery originally 
designed to be configured only as an 
aerial lift, which is excluded. In 
excluding this machinery, the 
Committee discussed the fact that some 
aerial lifts have a small capacity 
auxiliary winch. C–DAC decided not to 
include such machinery. The use of 
such winches is only incidental to an 
aerial lift’s primary function. Also, 
another standard, § 1926.453, addresses 
aerial lifts. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(6) excludes 
telescopic/hydraulic gantry systems. 
This machinery is also not currently 
covered by Subpart N or any ANSI/ 
ASME standards. C–DAC made the 
decision to exclude this machinery after 
extensive discussion between members 
and a presentation by Mr. Kevin 
Johnston of J&R Engineering Co., Inc. 

The decision was based upon several 
factors. One factor was the difference in 
design between this machinery and 
other equipment covered by the 
proposed rule. Telescopic/hydraulic 
gantry systems consist (in their most 
basic configuration) of a header beam 
that is supported on each side by 
hydraulic jacks. The load is suspended 
by rigging from the header beam. The 
load is raised and lowered by raising 
and lowering the jacks. 

This type of design involves hazards 

that are unique to this type of 
equipment. For example, keeping the 
jacks plumb and closely coordinating 
their movements is very important. Mr. 
Johnston noted that because of these 
differences, many of the requirements in 
the proposed standard would not be 
workable or needed. Also, hazards 
unique to this type of machinery would 
not be addressed. 

C–DAC was concerned that a failure 

to include this machinery in the 
proposed rule could result in there 
being no applicable OSHA 
requirements. The Committee was 
particularly concerned about this

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

because there was no industry 
consensus standard for telescopic/ 
hydraulic gantry systems. Once the 
Specialized Carriers & Rigging 
Association (SC&RA) indicated its 
willingness to draft and complete a 
voluntary consensus standard for this 
machinery within a short time frame, 
the Committee was satisfied that the 
best approach was to exclude 
telescopic/hydraulic gantry systems 
from the proposed rule. 

The Agency notes that, in the fall of 

2004, SC&RA did in fact complete a 
voluntary consensus standard for 
telescopic/hydraulic gantry systems. 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0027). Accordingly, 
the Agency agrees with C–DAC that, 
under these circumstances, these 
systems should be excluded from the 
proposed rule. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(7), 

stacker cranes are excluded. This 
machinery, covered by ASME B30.18, 
was similarly excluded in the ACCSH 
draft. The Agency believes that these 
cranes are rarely used in construction, 
and that their configuration is too unlike 
other machinery covered by this 
proposed standard to warrant inclusion. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(8) excludes 

powered industrial trucks (forklifts). As 
noted during the C–DAC meetings, this 
machinery is already covered by 
§ 1926.602 of Subpart O—Motor 
Vehicles, Mechanized Equipment, and 
Marine Operations. The Agency believes 
that this type of machinery is mostly 
used in a manner that does not involve 
suspended loads and would often 
require different responses to the 
hazards presented than provided in this 
proposed standard. Therefore, the 
Agency agrees with C–DAC that this 
machinery should be excluded from the 
proposed standard. 

During the SBREFA process, one 

Small Entity Representative stated that 
the C–DAC document does not contain 
a provision explicitly excluding 
coverage of machines that are originally 
designed to function primarily as 
forklifts but are modified to perform 
tasks similar to cranes and derricks that 
are covered under the standard. The 
Panel recommended that OSHA 
consider and solicit public comment on 
whether the scope language should be 
modified to explicitly state whether 
forklifts modified in such a manner are 
covered. OSHA welcomes comment on 
this issue. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(9) excludes 

mechanic’s trucks with hoisting devices 
when used in activities related to 
equipment maintenance and repair. The 
treatment of this machinery is similar to 
that of automotive wreckers and tow 
trucks. This exclusion reflects the 

Committee’s conclusion that mechanic’s 
trucks, when used in these support 
activities, have the capability of hoisting 
construction material and so some 
construction employers may use them 
for that purpose. Consequently, C–DAC 
decided to cover them generally, but to 
exclude them when used for equipment 
maintenance and repair activities. The 
exclusion is based on the Committee’s 
view that, even if done as a construction 
activity (which would be very rare), the 
maintenance and repair activities are 
highly repetitious, predictable types of 
operations that are sufficiently distinct 
from typical construction crane and 
derrick use to justify an exclusion from 
the proposed rule. 

In proposed paragraph (c)(10), 

machinery that hoists by using a come- 
a-long or chainfall is excluded. This 
exclusion reflects currently industry 
practice as exemplified by OSHA’s steel 
erection standard. The definition of 
‘‘hoisting equipment’’ in OSHA’s steel 
erection standard, § 1926.751, defines 
‘‘come-a-long’’ as ‘‘a mechanical device 
typically consisting of a chain or cable 
attached at each end that is used to 
facilitate movement of materials through 
leverage’’ and notes that such a device 
is not considered ‘‘hoisting equipment.’’ 
§ 1926.1401 of this proposed standard 
sets forth the same definition of ‘‘come- 
a-long’’ as OSHA’s steel erection 
standard. Committee members decided 
that a specific exclusion was needed 
because these devices, that members 
term ‘‘tools of the trade,’’ are not all 
human-powered and thus might 
otherwise fall within the scope of the 
proposed rule. C–DAC was of the view 
that these tools are unlike the 
equipment covered by the proposed rule 
in terms of both scale and the set of 
hazards associated with their use. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(11) excludes 
dedicated drilling rigs. This exclusion 
was agreed upon after substantial 
discussion among Committee members. 
It should be noted that neither Subpart 
N nor other OSHA construction 
standards currently cover dedicated 
drilling rigs specifically. 

Much of the specific information as to 
the nature of dedicated drilling rigs and 
the concerns of drill rig industry 
stakeholders was ascertained during a 
panel discussion chaired by members of 
the International Association of 
Foundation Drilling. Panel members 
emphasized that, in their view, a 
dedicated drilling rig is not a crane, but 
rather is designed to function as 
excavating equipment. 

In support of that position, the 

panelists noted that, unlike cranes, this 
machinery lacks load charts and has 
only limited horizontal movement, 

radius, and hoisting capabilities. They 
also stated that although many are 
equipped with an auxiliary service 
winch, the primary use of this 
machinery is not for hoisting. Panelists 
suggested that accidents associated with 
the use of dedicated drilling rigs tend to 
result from improper use (that is, 
attempting to use them for more 
extensive hoisting work, beyond the 
narrow limits set by manufacturer 
specifications). Finally, the speakers 
emphasized that while they did not 
believe this machinery should be 
regulated as cranes under the proposed 
rule, if they were to be regulated, they 
should be under a more closely related 
standard, such as the excavation 
standard. 

Several additional concerns were 

examined in the course of the 
discussion. Some members suggested 
that dedicated pile drivers and 
dedicated drilling rigs be treated in the 
same manner—to either cover or 
exclude both. Others responded that the 
disparate treatment is justified by the 
fact that dedicated pile drivers are 
frequently used on barges, which 
involves additional hazards, and the 
more widespread use of that machine’s 
hoisting function. Some members 
expressed concern that the inclusion of 
dedicated drilling rigs under the 
proposed rule would encourage their 
misuse as cranes. 

The Committee decided that the 
arguments for excluding dedicated 
drilling rigs outweighed those for 
including them. The Agency agrees; 
while there are certain similarities to 
dedicated pile drivers in that both have 
an auxiliary hoisting capability, the 
dedicated drilling rigs are not typically 
used on barges and there seems to be 
less abuse of their very limited hoisting 
capabilities. Specific public comment is 
requested on these issues. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(12) contains 
an exclusion for gin poles used during 
the erection of communication towers. It 
is the Agency’s understanding that the 
erection of communication towers is a 
specialized subset of the construction 
industry, and involves issues that go 
beyond those C–DAC was designed to 
address. OSHA is therefore not 
proposing to include gin poles used for 
this purpose in the proposed rule. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(13) excludes 

tree trimming and tree removal work 
from the scope of the proposed rule. In 
correspondence to the Committee 
(OSHA S030–2006–0663–0534), the 
Tree Care Industry Association had 
requested that their work be excluded 
from the proposed rule. The Committee 
noted that the vast majority of the tree 
care industry’s work does not take place

in construction and agreed that such 
work should be excluded. The Agency 
believes that, since tree trimming and 
tree removal work so rarely falls within 
construction, it is appropriate to 
exclude tree trimming and removal from 
the proposed rule. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(14) excludes 
anchor handling with a vessel or barge 
using an affixed A-frame. C–DAC 
decided to exclude this activity after the 
Cranes on Barges Work Group found 
that there would be problems tailoring 
the general requirements of the C–DAC 
draft to address the use of these 
specialized devices. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(15), the final 
item listed, excludes roustabouts. The 
Committee was of the view that the 
proposed rule is not suited to 
addressing these devices, which are 
moved about by hand. 

The SBREFA Panel recommended 

that OSHA consider, and solicit 
comment on, whether equipment used 
solely to deliver materials to a 
construction site by placing/stacking the 
materials on the ground should be 
explicitly excluded from the scope of 
the rule. OSHA requests public 
comment on this issue. 

Note: OSHA replaced the word 

‘‘Equipment’’ used in proposed 
§§ 1926.1400(c)(1), (c)(5) and (c)(10) of the C– 
DAC Consensus Document with the word 
‘‘Machinery.’’ This was done because 
‘‘equipment’’ is a defined term in the 
proposed standard that refers to covered 
equipment and, thus, cannot be used to mean 
excluded machinery. 

Unspecified Equipment 

Proposed paragraph (d) is included to 

clarify that all provisions of the 
proposed rule apply to covered 
equipment unless otherwise noted. This 
paragraph was included because there 
are some types of equipment for which 
only limited requirements apply, and 
others where there are special 
requirements that supplement, rather 
than displace, the other requirements in 
the proposed rule. To avoid confusion, 
this proposed paragraph establishes that 
all parts of the proposed rule apply 
unless a provision specifically identifies 
other parts of the proposed rule as 
inapplicable, or identifies the only 
provisions of the standard that are 
applicable. 
Controlling Entities 

Proposed paragraph (e) provides that 

the duties of controlling entities 2 are 
not limited to the duties specified in 

2 The definition of ‘‘controlling entity’’ is 

explained in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1402(c).

§§ 1926.1402(c), (e) and 1926.1424(b). 
This was included to clarify that the 
controlling entity duties specified in the 
proposed rule are intended to 
supplement, rather than displace, 
controlling entity duties under OSHA’s 
multi-employer policy. 

The Agency has clear authority to 

include in this proposed rule the 
provisions in proposed §§ 1926.1402(c), 
(e) and 1926.1424(b), which would 
apply specific requirements to 
controlling entities. First, the plain 
language of the OSH Act and its 
underlying purpose support OSHA’s 
authority to place requirements on 
employers that are necessary to protect 
the employees of others. Second, 
congressional action subsequent to 
passage of the OSH Act recognizes this 
authority. Third, OSHA has consistently 
interpreted its statutory authority as 
permitting it to impose obligations on 
employers that extend beyond their own 
employees, as evidenced by the 
numerous standards, including several 
construction standards, that OSHA has 
promulgated with multi-employer 
provisions. Finally, OSHA’s authority to 
place obligations on employers that 
reach beyond an employer’s own 
employees has been upheld by 
numerous courts of appeals and the 
Occupational Safety and Health Review 
Commission (OSHRC). 

The purpose of the Act is to assure so 

far as possible safe and healthful 
working conditions for every working 
man and women in the nation. 29 U.S.C. 
651(b). To achieve this goal, Congress 
authorized the Secretary to establish 
mandatory occupational safety and 
health standards. The Act broadly 
defines an OSHA standard as a rule that 
‘‘requires conditions, or the adoption or 
use of one or more practices, means, 
methods, operations, or processes, 
reasonably necessary or appropriate to 
provide safe or healthful employments 
and places of employment.’’ 29 U.S.C. 
652(8). See Building and Constr. Trades 
Div., AFL-CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 
1278 (DC Cir. 1988). OSHA standards 
must prescribe measures that are 
appropriate to protect ‘‘places of 
employment’’; nothing in the statutory 
language suggests that OSHA may do so 
only by regulating an employer’s 
interaction with its own employees. On 
the contrary, the Act’s broad language 
gives OSHA almost ‘‘unlimited 
discretion’’ to devise means to reach the 
statutory goal. See United Steelworkers 
v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1230 (DC 
Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 913 
(1981). 

Similarly, Section 5(a)(2) provides 

that each employer ‘‘shall comply with 
occupational safety and health 

standards promulgated under this 
Act.’’ 3 Nothing in this language suggests 
that compliance is required only when 
necessary to protect the employers’ own 
employees, or that the employer is 
entitled to endanger other employers’ 
employees at the worksite. Finally, 
Section 6(b)(7) of the Act authorizes the 
Secretary to ‘‘prescribe the use of labels 
or other appropriate forms of warning as 
are necessary to insure that employees 
are apprised of all hazards to which 
they are exposed.’’ 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7). 
Again, this authority is not limited to 
labels that would warn the employer’s 
own employees of the hazard. Given the 
distribution of potentially hazardous 
products in commerce, employees are 
predictably exposed to hazardous 
conditions created by other employers. 
Requiring employers to include hazard 
information needed by downstream 
employees is a necessary and 
appropriate means to ensure that the 
employees are apprised of all hazards to 
which they are exposed. 

In short, the statute focuses on 

workplace conditions to effectuate the 
OSH Act’s congressional mandate, and 
not on a particular employment 
relationship. The OSH Act’s underlying 
purpose is broad—to assure safe and 
healthful working conditions for 
working men and women—and 
Congress made clear that it expected the 
Act to protect all employees. (H. Rep. 
No. 91–1291, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 
14–16 (July 9, 1970)). Numerous 
references in the legislative history of 
the Act require employers to provide a 
safe and healthful ‘‘place of 
employment’’ (see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 91– 
1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 
(October 6, 1970)). The OSH Act tasks 
OSHA with promulgating rules that will 
create safe places of employment, 
notwithstanding the many varied 
employment relationships that might 
exist at a worksite. 

Subsequent congressional action has 

also recognized OSHA’s authority to 
impose responsibilities on employers to 
protect employees who are not their 
own. For example, Congress directed 
OSHA to develop a chemical process 
safety standard (the PSM standard) 
requiring employers to ‘‘ensure 
contractors and contract employees are 
provided appropriate information and 
training’’ and to ‘‘train and educate 

3 This language is in marked contrast to the 

language of Section 5(a)(1) of the Act (known as the 
‘‘general duty clause’’), which requires each 
employer to ‘‘furnish to each of his employees 
employment and a place of employment which are 
free from recognized hazards that are causing or are 
likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his 
employees.’’ 29 U.S.C. 654(a)(1) (emphases added). 
See Brennan v. OSHRC, 513 F.2d 1032, 1037–38 
(2nd. Cir. 1975).

employees and contractors in 
emergency response.’’ (29 U.S.C. note) 
(quoting Pub.L. 101–549, Title III, Sec. 
304, November 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 
2576). This is a clear ratification of the 
Agency’s authority to require employers 
to protect the employees of others. 
Congress also approved of the Agency’s 
authority when it relied on the 
provisions of OSHA’s Hazard 
Communication standard in 
promulgating the Emergency Planning 
and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 
U.S.C. 11001–11050) (EPCRA). OSHA’s 
Hazard Communication standard, 
among other things, requires a 
manufacturer of a hazardous chemical 
to ‘‘inform not only its own employees 
of the dangers posed by the chemicals, 
but downstream employers and 
employees as well.’’ Martin v. American 
Cyanamid Co., 5 F.3d 140, 141 (6th Cir. 
1993). Congress incorporated provisions 
of the Hazard Communication standard 
in EPCRA as a basis for triggering 
obligations on owners or operators of 
facilities producing hazardous 
chemicals to provide local governments 
with information needed for emergency 
response. Had Congress not approved of 
the multi-employer provisions in the 
Hazard Communication standard, it 
would not have approved of it as a basis 
for obligations in the EPCRA. 

Furthermore, OSHA has consistently 
interpreted the OSH Act as authorizing 
it to impose multi-employer obligations 
in its standards. In addition to the 
Hazard Communication standard and 
PSM standard discussed above, OSHA 
included multi-employer provisions in 
its powered platforms standard, which 
requires that a building owner inform 
employers that the building installation 
has been inspected and is safe to use. 29 
CFR 1910.66(c)(3). OSHA has also 
imposed multi-employer obligations in 
other construction standards. 

For example, in the construction 
asbestos standard, OSHA requires 
building owners/employers to perform 
initial monitoring for asbestos and to 
communicate the presence of asbestos 
or presumed asbestos containing 
materials to prospective employers 
whose employees reasonably can be 
expected to work in exposed areas. 29 
CFR 1926.1101(k)(2). In the recently 
promulgated steel-erection standard, 
OSHA imposed duties on controlling 
contractors to ensure that site 
conditions are safe for steel erection. 29 
CFR 1926.752(c). OSHA just recently 
proposed in updates to its electric- 
power transmission and distribution 
construction standard similar multi- 
employer communication provisions. 
See 70 FR 34947–48. OSHA’s inclusion 
of multi-employer provisions in this

proposed rule is fully consistent with its 
past practice of ensuring the safety and 
health of all employees at construction 
worksites. 

Finally, OSHA’s authority to impose 

these provisions is confirmed by the 
decisions of numerous courts of appeals 
and the Occupational Safety and Health 
Review Commission holding that an 
employer’s duties and OSHA standards 
may extend beyond an employer’s own 
employees. See Universal Constr. Co. v. 
OSHRC, 182 F.3d 726, 728 (10th Cir. 
1999) (following decisions from Second, 
Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth 
Circuits); Access Equip. Sys., 18 BNA 
OSHC 1718, 1722–24 (No. 95–1449, 
1999). But see Melerine v. Avondale 
Shipyards, Inc., 659 F.2d 706 (5th Cir. 
1981). The DC Circuit suggested in 
Anthony Crane Rental, Inc. v. Reich, 70 
F.3d 1298, 1306 (DC Cir. 1995), 
however, that 29 CFR 1910.12(a)—a rule 
promulgated by OSHA to adopt 
Construction Safety Act (CSA) standards 
as OSHA standards—might limit an 
employer’s obligations under the 
construction standards in part 1926 to 
its own employees. The court did not 
reach the issue, noting that the parties 
had not briefed it. The proposed cranes 
and derricks in construction standard 
will be included in part 1926. 

Paragraph 1910.12(a) is consistent 

with the promulgation of requirements 
that place obligations on employers 
necessary to protect the employees of 
others. The provision states: 

The standards prescribed in part 1926 of 

this chapter are adopted as occupational 
safety and health standards under section 6 
of the Act and shall apply, according to the 
provisions thereof, to every employment and 
place of employment of every employee 
engaged in construction work. Each employer 
shall protect the employment and places of 
employment of each of his employees 
engaged in construction work by complying 
with the appropriate standards prescribed in 
this paragraph. 

The language of the provision 

supports OSHA’s interpretation that an 
employer’s responsibilities can extend 
beyond the employer’s employees. The 
first sentence makes the construction 
standards applicable to every 
employment and to every ‘‘place of 
employment’’ of every construction 
employee. This is broad language that 
does not limit an employer’s obligations 
to its own employees. The second 
sentence, by providing that each 
employer must protect the employment 
and the places of employment of each 
of his employees, does not limit an 
employer’s obligations to only 
protecting his or her employees and 
does not negate the broad reach of the 
first sentence. The two sentences, read 

together, require employers to comply 
with standards at all sites where they 
are working in order to protect 
employees who are predictably present 
at those sites. 

The sole purpose of the provision was 

to ‘‘adopt and extend’’ existing 
Construction Safety Act (CSA) standards 
applicable under the OSH Act. 29 CFR 
1910.11. Under the CSA, standards 
applied only to employers with 
Federally funded contracts, and only 
with respect to employees engaged on 
those Federal projects. See 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart B; CH2M Hill, Inc. v. 
Herman, 192 F.3d 711, 718 n.1 (7th Cir. 
1999). The function of 29 CFR 
1910.12(a) was to adopt the CSA 
standards as OSHA standards and in so 
doing to make it clear that neither of 
those limitations would apply. Thus, 
OSHA stressed that compliance would 
broadly extend to each construction 
employer (not just those with Federal 
contracts) and to every construction 
employee (not just those working on 
Federal projects). In no way did OSHA 
intend for the language of 29 CFR 
1910.12(a) to restrict its authority to 
promulgate construction standards that 
establish obligations extending beyond 
an employer’s own employees. 

Other factors confirm that OSHA had 
no intention in 29 CFR 1910.12(a) to bar 
multi-employer responsibilities under 
the construction standards. OSHA 
issued the regulation without notice and 
comment under Section 6(a) of the Act. 
That section provided authority only to 
adopt established federal standards, 
such as the CSA standards, without 
making any substantive changes. Usery 
v. Kennecott Copper Corp., 577 F.2d 
1113 (10th Cir. 1977). The CSA 
regulations did not limit multi-employer 
responsibilities; the regulations 
expressly provided for them. 29 CFR 
1926.16. OSHA could not have intended 
to limit statutory obligations in an 
action under Section 6(a). 

In addition, concurrently with 

issuance of 29 CFR 1910.12(a), OSHA 
issued its initial Field Operations 
Manual, which expressly directed 
issuance of citations to construction 
employers who created a hazard 
endangering their own employees or 
those of another employer. The Agency 
has also consistently promulgated rules 
in 29 CFR Part 1926 that expressly 
extend employers’ obligations beyond 
their own employees. The requirements 
in proposed 29 CFR 1926.1204 reflect 
this consistent interpretation and will 
ensure that all employees on 
construction worksites are protected 
from the hazards of confined spaces.

Review Commission’s recent decision in 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59733 

Secretary of Labor v. Summit 
Contractors (OSHRC Docket No. 03– 
1622 (April 27, 2007), has no 
application to this proposed rule. In 
Summit, a divided Review Commission 
vacated citations issued to a controlling 
employer for violations of a 
construction standard. The two 
Commissioners who joined in this result 
issued separate opinions; each read 29 
CFR 1910.12(a) as establishing a 
limitation on the Agency’s authority to 
hold controlling employers accountable 
for violations. OSHA believes this view 
is mistaken, and has appealed the 
OSHRC decision to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals (8th Cir. No. 07–2191). 

Moreover, Summit has no bearing on 

the duties established under the 
proposed rule. The Summit opinions 
interpreted OSHA’s intent under then 
existing rules. They did not question 
OSHA’s authority under the Act to 
establish multi-employer obligations 
through rulemaking. OSHA is exercising 
its authority under Section 6(b) to issue 
this proposed rule, and nothing in 29 
CFR 1910.12(a) limits an employer’s 
compliance obligations under the rule. 
Proposed paragraph (f) would require 
that where a provision in the proposed 
rule directs an operator, crewmember or 
other employee to take a specified 
action, it would be the employer’s 
responsibility to establish work rules to 

require the relevant employees to take 
that action, and to effectively 
communicate and enforce those work 
rules. This paragraph clarifies the 
employer’s obligations with regard to 
such provisions. 
Terminology 

According to § 1926.1401, Definitions, 

two terms are defined as meaning all 
equipment covered by this subpart: 
‘‘Equipment’’ and ‘‘cranes/derricks.’’ In 
reviewing the C–DAC document, OSHA 
has found that in some places it uses the 
word ‘‘crane’’ standing alone when C– 
DAC’s intent was to refer to all covered 
equipment. To avoid any ambiguity, 
OSHA has modified the document 
where appropriate to replace ‘‘crane’’ 
with either ‘‘equipment’’ or ‘‘crane/ 
derrick.’’ Where ‘‘crane’’ is used in a 
way that is technically correct, as in 
referring to ‘‘tower cranes,’’ OSHA has 
not changed it. 

In instances where the C–DAC 
document uses the phrase ‘‘crane 
operator,’’ OSHA has deleted the word 
‘‘crane.’’ By definition (in § 1926.1401) 
‘‘operator’’ refers to the equipment 
operator and, in many locations, the C– 
DAC document already uses ‘‘operator’’ 
without a modifier to refer to the 
equipment operator. Therefore, use of 
‘‘crane’’ to modify ‘‘operator’’ is 
unnecessary and potentially confusing. 

Section 1401 Definitions 

C–DAC included a number of 

definitions to clarify the meaning of 
terms used in the proposed standard. 
Many of the defined terms are 
commonly used in the industry, and 
C–DAC in most instances relied on 
standard industry sources or its own 
understanding of how terms are used in 
the industry to help ensure that the 
definitions would be readily understood 
by employers and employees. Industry 
sources on which C–DAC relied include 
existing OSHA standards, consensus 
standards, and ‘‘A Glossary of Common 
Crane and Rigging Terms’’ (Specialized 
Carriers and Rigging Foundation 1997) 
(‘‘SC&RF Handbook’’)(OSHA–2007– 
0066–0019). Some definitions were also 
included to ensure that certain terms 
used in the proposed standard have a 
precise, unambiguous meaning. 
Where defined terms are used 

primarily in a single section or group of 
sections (such as §§ 1926.1407–1411 on 
power line safety), the definition will be 
explained in the preamble to that 
section or group. Definitions that are 
used in a number of sections will be 
explained in this section. Table 5 shows 
the section or paragraph where each 
definition is discussed.

§ 1926.1413 

Four terms that are defined in the C– 

DAC document—‘‘alongside,’’ 
‘‘appointed person,’’ ‘‘blind pick,’’ and 
‘‘power down,’’—were used by C–DAC 
in earlier drafts but are not used in the 
proposed standard. OSHA has therefore 
not included them in this section. 

‘‘A/D supervisor’’ means ‘‘an 

individual who meets this standard’s 
requirements for an A/D supervisor, 
irrespective of the person’s formal job 
title or whether the person is non- 
management or management 
personnel.’’ 

‘‘Articulating crane’’ means ‘‘a crane 

whose boom consists of a series of 
folding, pin connected structural 
members, typically manipulated to 
extend or retract by power from 
hydraulic cylinders.’’ This definition is 
taken from the SC&RF Handbook 
definition of ‘‘articulating boom crane.’’ 

‘‘Assist crane’’ is ‘‘a crane used to 

assist in assembling or disassembling a 
crane.’’ 

‘‘Assembly/Disassembly’’ means ‘‘the 

assembly and/or disassembly of 
equipment covered under this standard. 
With regard to tower cranes, ‘‘erecting 
and climbing’’ replaces the term 
‘assembly,’ and ‘dismantling’ replaces 
the term ‘disassembly.’ ’’ 

‘‘Attachments’’ means ‘‘any device 

that expands the range of tasks that can 
be done by the equipment. Examples 
include, but are not limited to: an auger, 
drill, magnet, pile-driver, and boom- 
attached personnel platform.’’ This 
definition is discussed under paragraph 
1400(b) in the explanation of this 
proposed standard. 

‘‘Audible signal’’ means ‘‘a signal 
made by a distinct sound or series of 
sounds. Examples include, but are not 
limited to, sounds made by a bell, horn, 
or whistle.’’ 

‘‘Blocking’’ (also referred to as 

‘‘cribbing’’) ‘‘is wood or other material 
used to support equipment or a 
component and distribute loads to the 
ground. Typically used to support 
latticed boom sections during assembly/ 
disassembly and under outrigger floats.’’ 
‘‘Boatswain’s chair’’ is ‘‘a single-point 

adjustable suspension scaffold 
consisting of a seat or sling (which may 
be incorporated into a full body harness) 

designed to support one employee in a 
sitting position.’’ 

‘‘Bogie’’ is synonymous with ‘‘travel 

bogie,’’ which is defined below. 

‘‘Boom (equipment other than tower 
crane)’’ means ‘‘an inclined spar, strut, 
or other long structural member which 
supports the upper hoisting tackle on a 
crane or derrick. Typically, the length 
and vertical angle of the boom can be 
varied to achieve increased height or 
height and reach when lifting loads. 
Booms can usually be grouped into 
general categories of hydraulically 
extendible, cantilevered type, latticed 
section, cable supported type or 
articulating type.’’ This definition is 
taken from the SC&RF Handbook. 

‘‘Boom (tower cranes).’’ On tower 
cranes: if the ‘‘boom’’ (i.e., principal 
horizontal structure) is fixed, it is 
referred to as a jib; if it is moveable up 
and down, it is referred to as a boom. 
‘‘Boom angle indicator’’ is ‘‘a device 
which measures the angle of the boom 
relative to horizontal.’’ 

‘‘Boom hoist limiting device’’ 

‘‘includes boom hoist disengaging 
device, boom hoist shutoff, boom hoist 
disconnect, boom hoist hydraulic relief, 
boom hoist kick-outs, automatic boom 
stop device, or derricking limiter. This 
type of device disengages boom hoist 
power when the boom reaches a 
predetermined operating angle. It also 
sets brakes or closes valves to prevent 
the boom from lowering after power is 
disengaged.’’ 

‘‘Boom length indicator’’ ‘‘indicates 
the length of the permanent part of the 
boom (such as ruled markings on the 
boom) or, as in some computerized 
systems, the length of the boom with 
extensions/attachments.’’ 

‘‘Boom stop’’ ‘‘includes boom stops, 

(belly straps with struts/standoff), 
telescoping boom stops, attachment 
boom stops, and backstops. These 
devices restrict the boom from moving 
above a certain maximum angle and 
toppling over backward.’’ 

‘‘Boom suspension systems’’ are ‘‘a 

system of pendants, running ropes, 
sheaves, and other hardware which 
supports the boom tip and controls the 
boom angle.’’ 

‘‘Builder’’ means ‘‘an employer 

builder/constructor of equipment.’’ This 
definition is discussed under 
§ 1926.1436(c)(1) in the explanation of 
this proposed standard. 

‘‘Calculate’’ ‘‘includes use of a 

calculator.’’ The Committee included 
this definition to make clear that 
persons who performed calculations 
under this standard may use any 
method, including use of a calculator, 
that yields accurate results. 

‘‘Center of gravity.’’ ‘‘The center of 

gravity of any object is the point in the 
object around which its weight is evenly 
distributed. If you could put a support 
under that point, you could balance the 
object on the support.’’ 

‘‘Certified welder’’ is ‘‘a welder that 

meets the nationally recognized 
certification requirements that are 
applicable to the task being performed.’’ 

‘‘Climbing’’ is ‘‘the process in which 

a tower crane is raised to a new working 
height, either by adding additional 
tower sections to the top of the crane 
(top climbing), or by a system in which 
the entire crane is raised inside the 
structure (inside climbing).’’ 

‘‘Come-a-long’’ means ‘‘a mechanical 
device typically consisting of a chain or 
cable attached at each end that is used 
to facilitate movement of materials 
through leverage.’’ 

‘‘Competent person’’ is ‘‘a person who 

is capable of identifying existing and 
predictable hazards in the surroundings 
or working conditions which are 
unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to 
employees, and who has authorization 
to take prompt corrective measures to 
eliminate them.’’ This definition is 
taken from 29 CFR 1926.32(f), which 
defines ‘‘competent person’’ under 
OSHA’s construction standards. Those 
standards assign duties to ‘‘competent 
persons’’ that are similar to those 
assigned under this proposed standard. 

‘‘Controlled load lowering’’ means 

‘‘lowering a load by means of a 
mechanical hoist drum device that 
allows a hoisted load to be lowered with 
maximum control using the gear train or 
hydraulic components of the hoist 
mechanism. Controlled load lowering 
requires the use of the hoist drive motor,

rather than the load hoist brake, to 
lower the load.’’ 

‘‘Controlling entity’’ is ‘‘a prime 

contractor, general contractor, 
construction manager or any other legal 
entity which has the overall 
responsibility for the construction of the 
project—its planning, quality and 
completion.’’ 

‘‘Counterweight’’ is a ‘‘weight used to 
supplement the weight of equipment in 
providing stability for lifting loads by 
counterbalancing those loads.’’ 
‘‘Crane/derrick’’ includes ‘‘all 

equipment covered by this Subpart.’’ 
‘‘Crawler crane’’ means ‘‘equipment 
that has a type of base mounting which 
incorporates a continuous belt of 
sprocket driven track.’’ This definition 
is based on the definition of ‘‘crawler’’ 
in the SC&RF Handbook. Current 
industry terminology refers to crawler 
cranes and truck cranes together as 
‘‘mobile cranes.’’ See definition of 
‘‘mobile crane’’ below. 

‘‘Crossover points’’ are ‘‘locations on 
a wire rope which is spooled on a drum 
where one layer of rope climbs up on 
and crosses over the previous layer. 
This takes place at each flange of the 
drum as the rope is spooled onto the 
drum, reaches the flange, and begins to 
wrap back in the opposite direction.’’ 

‘‘Dedicated channel’’ is ‘‘a line of 

communication assigned by the 
employer who controls the 
communication system to only one 
signal person and crane/derrick or to a 
coordinated group of cranes/derrick/ 
signal person(s).’’ 

‘‘Dedicated pile-driver’’ is ‘‘a machine 
that is designed to function exclusively 
as a pile-driver. These machines 
typically have the ability to both hoist 
the material that will be pile-driven and 
to pile-drive that material.’’ 

‘‘Dedicated spotter (power lines)’’ is 

defined as follows: ‘‘In order to be 
considered a dedicated spotter, the 
requirements of § 1926.1428 (signal 
person qualifications) must be met and 
his/her sole responsibility is to watch 
the separation between the power line 
and: the equipment, load line and load 
(including rigging and lifting 
accessories), and ensure through 
communication with the operator, that 
the applicable minimum approach 
distance is not breached.’’ 

‘‘Directly under the load’’ means ‘‘a 

part or all of an employee is directly 
beneath the load.’’ 

‘‘Dismantling’’ ‘‘includes partial 

dismantling (such as dismantling to 
shorten a boom or substitute a different 
component).’’ 

‘‘Drum rotation indicator’’ is ‘‘a 
device on a crane or hoist which 
indicates in which direction and at what

relative speed a particular hoist drum is 
turning.’’ 

‘‘Electrical contact’’ refers to ‘‘when a 

person, object, or equipment makes 
contact or comes in close proximity 
with an energized conductor or 
equipment that allows the passage of 
current.’’ 

‘‘Employer-made equipment’’ means 
‘‘floating cranes/derricks designed and 
built by an employer for the employer’s 
own use.’’ 

‘‘Encroachment’’ is ‘‘where any part of 

the crane, load line or load (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) breaches 
a minimum clearance distance that this 
subpart requires to be maintained from 
a power line.’’ 

‘‘Equipment’’ means ‘‘equipment 

covered by this subpart.’’ 

‘‘Equipment criteria’’ means 

‘‘instructions, recommendations, 
limitations and specifications.’’ 

‘‘Fall protection equipment’’ means 
‘‘guardrail systems, safety net systems, 
personal fall arrest systems, positioning 
device systems or fall restraint 
systems.’’ 

‘‘Fall restraint system’’ means ‘‘a fall 

protection system that prevents the user 
from falling any distance. The system is 
comprised of either a body belt or body 
harness, along with an anchorage, 
connectors and other necessary 
equipment. The other components 
typically include a lanyard, and may 
also include a lifeline and other 
devices.’’ 

‘‘Fall zone’’ means ‘‘the area 

(including but not limited to the area 
directly beneath the load) in which it is 
reasonably foreseeable that partially or 
completely suspended materials could 
fall in the event of an accident.’’ 

‘‘Flange point’’ is ‘‘a point of contact 

between rope and drum flange where 
the rope changes layers.’’ 

‘‘Floating cranes/derricks’’ means 

‘‘equipment designed by the 
manufacturer (or employer) for marine 
use by permanent attachment to a barge, 
pontoons, vessel or other means of 
flotation.’’ 

‘‘For example’’ means ‘‘one example, 

although there are others.’’ This 
definition was included to demonstrate 
and clarify the usage of the word. 

‘‘Free fall (of the load line)’’ means 

‘‘where only the brake is used to 
regulate the descent of the load line (the 
drive mechanism is not used to drive 
the load down faster or retard its 
lowering).’’ 

‘‘Free surface effect’’ is ‘‘the 

uncontrolled transverse movement of 
liquids in compartments which reduce 
a vessel’s transverse stability.’’ 

‘‘Hoist’’ is ‘‘a mechanical device for 
lifting and lowering loads by winding 

rope onto or off a drum.’’ A hoist is the 
primary lifting mechanism used by 
cranes and derricks. 

‘‘Hoisting’’ is ‘‘the act of raising, 

lowering or otherwise moving a load in 
the air with equipment covered by this 
standard. As used in this standard, 
‘hoisting’ can be done by means other 
than wire rope/hoist drum equipment.’’ 
This definition makes clear that 
‘‘hoisting’’ is broad enough to 
encompass all movement of a load in 
the air by cranes/derricks and is not 
limited to movement caused by wire 
rope/hoist drum equipment. For 
example, movement resulting from 
booming out a hydraulic boom that is 
holding a load would be ‘‘hoisting.’’ 

‘‘Include/including’’ means 

‘‘including, but not limited to.’’ This 
definition demonstrates and clarifies the 
usage of the word. 

‘‘Insulating link/device’’ is ‘‘an 

insulating device listed, labeled, or 
accepted by a Nationally Recognized 
Testing Laboratory in accordance with 
29 CFR 1910.7.’’ 

‘‘Jib stop,’’ which is also referred to as 

a jib backstop, ‘‘is the same type of 
device as a boom stop but is for a fixed 
or luffing jib.’’ 

‘‘Land crane/derrick’’ is ‘‘Equipment 

not originally designed by the 
manufacturer for marine use by 
permanent attachment to barges, 
pontoons, vessels, or other means of 
floatation.’’ 

‘‘List’’ is the ‘‘angle of inclination 

about the longitudinal axis of a barge, 
pontoon, vessel or other means of 
flotation.’’ 

‘‘Load’’ refers to ‘‘the object(s) being 

hoisted and/or the weight of the 
object(s); both uses refer to the object(s) 
and the load-attaching equipment, such 
as, the load block, ropes, slings, 
shackles, and any other ancillary 
attachment.’’ This definition makes 
clear that in calculating the weight of 
the load for purposes such as making 
sure that the lift is within the 
equipment’s rated capacity, the weight 
of all objects used to attach the load to 
the equipment must be included. As 
drafted by C–DAC, ‘‘load’’ referred to 
the weight of the object being lifted but 
not the object itself. However, ‘‘load’’ is 
used throughout the proposed standard 
to refer to the object being hoisted in 
addition to the weight of the load. 
OSHA has modified the C–DAC 
definition accordingly. 

‘‘Load moment (or rated capacity) 

indicator’’ is ‘‘a system which aids the 
equipment operator by sensing the 
overturning moment on the equipment, 
i.e., load multiplied by radius. It 
compares this lifting condition to the 
equipment’s rated capacity, and

make clear that anyone operating 
equipment must meet all of the 
requirements of this subpart that apply 
to ‘‘operators.’’ 

‘‘Overhead and gantry cranes’’ is 

defined to include ‘‘overhead/bridge 
cranes, semigantry, cantilever gantry, 
wall cranes, storage bridge cranes, 
launching gantry cranes, and similar 
equipment, irrespective of whether it 
travels on tracks, wheels, or other 
means.’’ 

‘‘Paragraph’’ refers to ‘‘a paragraph in 
the same section of this subpart that the 
word ‘paragraph’ is used, unless 
otherwise specified.’’ For example, 
proposed paragraph 1423(a)(1) refers to 
‘‘paragraphs (b), (c)(2), and (e).’’ Under 
this definition, it is understood that 
those are paragraphs in § 1423. By 
contrast, paragraph 1439 refers to 
certain paragraphs in other sections and 
therefore includes the section 
designation in the reference, for 
example, ‘‘paragraph 1416(d)(3).’’ 

‘‘Pendants’’ are defined to ‘‘include 
both wire and bar types. Wire type: A 
fixed length of wire rope with 
mechanical fittings at both ends for 
pinning segments of wire rope together. 
Bar type: Instead of wire rope, a bar is 
used. Pendants are typically used in a 
latticed boom crane system to easily 
change the length of the boom 
suspension system without completely 
changing the rope on the drum when 
the boom length is increased or 
decreased.’’ 

‘‘Personal fall arrest system’’ means ‘‘a 

system used to arrest an employee in a 
fall from a working level. It consists of 
an anchorage, connectors, a body 
harness and may include a lanyard, 
deceleration device, lifeline, or suitable 
combination of these.’’ 

‘‘Portal cranes’’ are ‘‘a type of crane 
consisting of a rotating upperstructure, 
hoist machinery, and boom mounted on 
top of a structural gantry which may be 
fixed in one location or have travel 
capability. The gantry legs or columns 
usually have portal openings in between 
to allow passage of traffic beneath the 
gantry.’’ 

‘‘Power lines’’ are ‘‘electric 

transmission and distribution lines.’’ 
‘‘Procedures’’ ‘‘include, but are not 

limited to: instructions, diagrams, 
recommendations, warnings, 
specifications, protocols and 
limitations.’’ Several paragraphs of this 
proposed standard, such as 
§ 1926.1417(a), require employers to 
follow manufacturer procedures. C– 
DAC developed this definition to make 
clear that ‘‘procedures’’ in a provision 
such as § 1926.1417(a) is to be 
interpreted broadly to include all 
recommendations by the manufacturer 

indicates to the operator the percentage 
of capacity at which the equipment is 
working. Lights, bells, or buzzers may 
be incorporated as a warning of an 
approaching overload condition.’’ 

‘‘Load moment (or rated capacity) 
limiter’’ is ‘‘a system which aids the 
equipment operator by sensing the 
overturning moment on the equipment, 
i.e., load multiplied by radius. It 
compares this lifting condition to the 
equipment’s rated capacity, and when 
the rated capacity is reached, it shuts off 
power to those equipment functions 
which can increase the severity of 
loading on the equipment, e.g., hoisting, 
telescoping out, or luffing out. 
Typically, those functions which 
decrease the severity of loading on the 
equipment remain operational, e.g., 
lowering, telescoping in, or luffing in.’’ 

‘‘Locomotive crane’’ is ‘‘a crane 

mounted on a base or car equipped for 
travel on a railroad track.’’ OSHA 
included this definition to remain 
consistent with the industry’s use of the 
term as indicated in the SC&RF 
Handbook. 

‘‘Luffing jib limiting device’’ ‘‘is 

similar to a boom hoist limiting device, 
except that it limits the movement of the 
luffing jib.’’ 

‘‘Marine hoisted personnel transfer 

device’’ is ‘‘a device, such as a ‘transfer 
net,’ used to hoist an employee to or 
from a marine worksite that is designed 
to protect the employee during a marine 
transfer and that allows for rapid entry/ 
exit from the device. Such devices do 
not include a boatswain’s chair when 
hoisted by equipment covered by this 
standard.’’ 

‘‘Marine worksite’’ is ‘‘a construction 
worksite that is located in, on or above 
the water.’’ 

‘‘Mobile crane’’ is ‘‘a lifting device 

incorporating a cable suspended latticed 
boom or hydraulic telescopic boom 
designed to be moved between 
operating locations by transport over the 
road.’’ This definition is derived from 
the SC&RF Handbook. The term ‘‘mobile 
crane,’’ as used in ASME B30.5–2004, 
‘‘Mobile and Locomotive Cranes,’’ 
encompasses crawler cranes, truck 
cranes, and other wheel-mounted 
cranes. The 1968 version of ANSI B30.5, 
which is incorporated by reference into 
Subpart N, is entitled ‘‘Crawler, 
Locomotive and Truck Cranes’’ and also 
covered crawler cranes, truck cranes, 
and other wheel-mounted cranes (in 
addition to locomotive cranes). C–DAC 
included its definition of ‘‘mobile 
cranes’’ to reflect current industry 
terminology, which now refers to 
crawler cranes, truck cranes, and other 
wheel-mounted cranes collectively as 
‘‘mobile cranes.’’

The SC&RF Handbook definition 

states that in Europe, ‘‘mobile crane’’ 
refers to a crane mounted on a truck 
carrier. The C–DAC draft of the 
definition of ‘‘mobile crane’’ included 
this reference to European terminology. 
While the European terminology 
describes a device that is included in 
this proposed rule’s definition of mobile 
crane, OSHA has deleted the reference 
to the European terminology because it 
could be read to mean, erroneously, that 
only truck cranes fall within the 
definition of ‘‘mobile cranes.’’ As noted 
above, crawler cranes and wheel- 
mounted cranes other than truck cranes 
also qualify as ‘‘mobile cranes.’’ 

‘‘Moving point to point’’ means ‘‘the 
times during which an employee is in 
the process of going to or from a work 
station.’’ 

‘‘Multi-purpose machine’’ means ‘‘a 

machine that is designed to be 
configured in various ways, at least one 
of which allows it to hoist (by means of 
a winch or hook) and horizontally move 
a suspended load. For example, a 
machine that can rotate and can be 
configured with removable tongs (for 
use as a forklift) or with a winch pack, 
jib (with a hook at the end) or jib used 
in conjunction with a winch. When 
configured with the tongs, it is not 
covered by this Subpart. When 
configured with a winch pack, jib (with 
a hook at the end) or jib used in 
conjunction with a winch, it is covered 
by this Subpart.’’ 

‘‘Nationally recognized accrediting 

agency’’ is ‘‘an organization that, due to 
its independence and expertise, is 
widely recognized as competent to 
accredit testing organizations.’’ 

‘‘Non-conductive’’ means that, 

‘‘because of the nature and condition of 
the materials used, and the conditions 
of use (including environmental 
conditions and condition of the 
material), the object in question has the 
property of not becoming energized 
(that is, it has high dielectric properties 
offering a high resistance to the passage 
of current under the conditions of use).’’ 

‘‘Operational controls’’ are ‘‘levers, 
switches, pedals and other devices for 
controlling equipment operation.’’ 

‘‘Operational aids’’ are ‘‘devices that 
assist the operator in the safe operation 
of the crane by providing information or 
automatically taking control of a crane 
function. These include, but are not 
limited to, the devices listed in 
§ 1926.1416 (‘‘listed operational aids’’).’’ 

‘‘Operator’’ is ‘‘a person who is 

operating the equipment.’’ The term is 
therefore not restricted to job title but 
includes any and all persons who 
actually operate the equipment. The 
Committee included this definition to

regardless of the format of those 
recommendations. 

‘‘Proximity alarm’’ is ‘‘a device that 
provides a warning of proximity to a 
power line that has been listed, labeled, 
or accepted by a Nationally Recognized 
Testing Laboratory in accordance with 
29 CFR 1910.7.’’ 

‘‘Qualified evaluator (not a third 

party)’’ means ‘‘a person employed by 
the signal person’s employer who has 
demonstrated that he/she is competent 
in accurately assessing whether 
individuals meet the qualification 
requirements in this subpart for a signal 
person.’’ 

‘‘Qualified evaluator (third party)’’ is 
an ‘‘entity that, due to its independence 
and expertise, has demonstrated that it 
is competent in accurately assessing 
whether individuals meet the 
qualifications in this Subpart for a 
signal person.’’ This definition is 
discussed under § 1926.1428(a)(2) in the 
explanation of this proposed standard. 
‘‘Qualified person’’ means ‘‘a person 

who, by possession of a recognized 
degree, certificate, or professional 
standing, or who by extensive 
knowledge, training and experience, 
successfully demonstrated the ability to 
solve/resolve problems relating to the 
subject matter, the work, or the project.’’ 
This definition corresponds to the 
definition of ‘‘qualified’’ in 29 CFR 
1926.32(m). Its use here reflects the fact 
that the duties assigned to ‘‘qualified 
persons’’ under this proposal are similar 
to those assigned persons with 
comparable qualifications under other 
OSHA construction standards. By 
defining this term in the same way it is 
defined under other OSHA standards, 
C–DAC sought to make clear that 
construction industry employers could 
continue to rely on their understanding 
of the qualifications for a ‘‘qualified 
person’’ that is applied under existing 
standards. 

‘‘Qualified rigger’’ is ‘‘a rigger who 

meets the criteria for a qualified 
person.’’ 

‘‘Range control warning device’’ is ‘‘a 
device that can be set by the equipment 
operator to warn that the boom or jib tip 
is at a plane or multiple planes.’’ 

‘‘Rated capacity’’ is ‘‘the maximum 

working load permitted by the 
manufacturer under specified working 
conditions. Such working conditions 
typically include a specific combination 
of factors such as equipment 
configuration, radii, boom length, and 
other parameters of use.’’ The first 
sentence of this definition is taken from 
the SC&RF Handbook. The second 
sentence was added by C–DAC to clarify 
the meaning of ‘‘working conditions.’’

when the equipment’s ‘‘rated capacity’’ 
is exceeded, and the Committee sought 
to provide an unambiguous definition of 
the term to promote compliance with 
provisions that use the term. In 
reviewing the C–DAC consensus 
document, OSHA noted that ‘‘rated 
load’’ and ‘‘rated load capacity’’ were 
used in various places to mean the same 
thing as the Committee’s definition of 
‘‘rated capacity.’’ For consistency and to 
reflect the intention of the Committee, 
all references to ‘‘rated load’’ and ‘‘rated 
load capacity’’ in the consensus 
document have been changed to ‘‘rated 
capacity.’’ 

‘‘Rated capacity indicator’’ is an 
alternative term for ‘‘load moment 
indicator,’’ which is defined above. 

‘‘Rated capacity limiter’’ is an 

alternative term for ‘‘load moment 
limiter,’’ which is defined above. 

‘‘Repetitive pickup points’’ are ‘‘when 
operating on a short cycle operation, the 
rope being used on a single layer and 
being spooled repetitively over a short 
portion of the drum.’’ 

‘‘Running wire rope’’ is ‘‘a wire rope 

that moves over sheaves or drums.’’ 
‘‘Runway’’ is ‘‘a firm, level surface 

designed, prepared and designated as a 
path of travel for the weight and 
configuration of the crane being used to 
lift and travel with the crane suspended 
platform. This surface can be an existing 
surface or created for purposes of the 
work activity.’’ 

‘‘Section’’ means ‘‘a section of this 
subpart, unless otherwise specified.’’ 
This definition is included to ensure 
that the reader understands what 
‘‘section’’ means in this standard. 

‘‘Side-boom crane’’ is ‘‘a track-type or 

wheel-type tractor having a boom 
mounted on the side of the tractor, used 
for lifting, lowering, or transporting a 
load suspended on the load hook. The 
boom or hook can be lifted or lowered 
in a vertical direction only.’’ 

‘‘Special hazard warnings’’ are 

‘‘warnings of site-specific hazards (for 
example, proximity of power lines).’’ 
‘‘Stability (flotation device)’’ means 

‘‘the tendency of a barge pontoon, vessel 
or other means of flotation to return to 
an upright position after having been 
inclined by an external force.’’ 

‘‘Standard Method’’ means ‘‘the 

protocol in Appendices for hand 
signals.’’ 

‘‘Such as’’ means ‘‘such as, but not 

limited to.’’ This definition was 
included to demonstrate and clarify the 
usage of the phrase. 

‘‘Superstructure’’ is a synonym for 
‘‘upperstructure’’ and ‘‘upperworks,’’ 
which is defined below. 

‘‘Tag line’’ is a rope (usually fiber) 

attached to a lifted load for purposes of 

controlling load spinning and pendular 
motions or used to stabilize a bucket or 
magnet during material handling 
operations. This definition is included 
to ensure that the use of this term for the 
application of this proposed standard is 
consistent with how tag lines are 
commonly used to control loads during 
hoisting operations. 

‘‘Tender’’ is ‘‘an individual 

responsible for monitoring and 
communicating with a diver.’’ 

‘‘Tilt-up or tilt-down operation’’ is the 

‘‘raising/lowering of a load from the 
horizontal to vertical or vertical to 
horizontal.’’ 

‘‘Tower crane.’’ C–DAC defined a 

tower crane as: A type of lifting 
structure which utilizes a vertical mast 
or tower to support a working boom (jib) 
suspended from the working boom. 
While the working boom may be fixed 
horizontally or have luffing capability, it 
can always rotate about the tower center 
to swing loads. The tower base may be 
fixed in one location or ballasted and 
moveable between locations.’’ 

In reviewing this language, OSHA 

believes that several changes are 
needed. First, a characteristic of tower 
cranes that is missing from the C–DAC 
definition is that the working boom is in 
an elevated position above the ground. 
Second, the working boom on some 
tower cranes, even of the non-luffing 
type, may not be at a 90-degree angle to 
the tower, and so the term ‘‘fixed 
horizontally’’ may not always be 
appropriate. Third, there are ‘‘top 
slewing’’ tower cranes—those in which 
the working boom rotates on the top of 
a fixed tower, and ‘‘bottom slewing’’ 
tower cranes—those in which the tower 
itself (with the working boom fixed to 
it) rotates on its base. The definition 
does not make clear that both types are 
considered tower cranes for purposes of 
this proposed standard. 

Therefore, the Agency has modified 
this language for the definition in the 
proposed rule as follows: 

A type of lifting structure which utilizes a 
vertical mast or tower to support a working 
boom (jib) in an elevated position. Loads are 
suspended from the working boom. While 
the working boom may be of the fixed type 
(horizontal or angled) or have luffing 
capability, it can always rotate to swing 
loads, either by rotating on the top of the 
tower (top slewing) or by the rotation of the 
tower (bottom slewing). The tower base may 
be fixed in one location or ballasted and 
moveable between locations. 

OSHA requests public comment on 

these changes. 

‘‘Travel bogie (tower cranes)’’ is ‘‘an 
assembly of two or more axles arranged 
to permit vertical wheel displacement

and equalize the loading on the 
wheels.’’ 

‘‘Trim’’ is the ‘‘angle of inclination 

about the transverse axis of a barge, 
pontoon, vessel or other means of 
flotation.’’ 

‘‘Two blocking’’ means ‘‘a condition 

in which a component that is uppermost 
on the hoist line such as the load block, 
hook block, overhaul ball, or similar 
component, comes in contact with the 
boom tip, fixed upper block or similar 
component. This binds the system and 
continued application of power can 
cause failure of the hoist rope or other 
component.’’ 

‘‘Unavailable procedures’’ means 

‘‘procedures that are no longer available 
from the manufacturer, or have never 
been available from the manufacturer.’’ 

‘‘Upperstructure’’ is a synonym for 
‘‘superstructure’’ and ‘‘upperworks,’’ 
which is defined below. 

‘‘Upperworks’’ means ‘‘the revolving 

frame of equipment on which the engine 
and operating machinery are mounted 
along with the operator’s cab. The 
counterweight is typically supported on 
the rear of the upperworks and the 
boom or other front end attachment is 
mounted on the front.’’ 
‘‘Superstructure’’ and ‘‘upperstructure’’ 
are synonyms for ‘‘upperworks.’’ 

The second sentence of C–DAC’s 

version of this definition stated: ‘‘The 
counterweight is typically supported on 
the rear of the upperstructure * * *.’’ 
OSHA has changed the word 
‘‘upperstructure’’ to ‘‘upperworks’’ to 
avoid any confusion that could be 
caused by using one synonym in the 
definition of another. 

‘‘Up to’’ means ‘‘up to and including.’’ 

This definition is included to make the 
meaning of the phrase clear. 

‘‘Wire rope.’’ The C–DAC document 

defined this term as ‘‘rope made of 
wire,’’ the definition that is used in this 
proposed rule. However, some wire rope 
has a fiber core, which proposed 
§ 1926.1414 permits to be used for 
purposes other than boom hoist reeving. 
However, the C–DAC definition 
indicates that such rope would not be 
considered ‘‘wire rope.’’ OSHA requests 
public comment on whether a more 
suitable definition would be the one 
used by SC&RF, which is the following: 
A flexible rope constructed by laying steel 

wires into various patterns of multi-wired 
strands around a core system to produce a 
helically wound rope. 
Section 1402 Ground Conditions 
The Committee believed that the 

failure to have adequate ground 
conditions is a significant crane safety 
problem. Adequate ground conditions 
are essential for safe crane operations 

because the crane’s capacity and 
stability depend on such conditions 
being present. 

In the Committee’s view, there have 

been several key problems regarding 
ground conditions. First, cranes are 
commonly brought on site by a 
subcontractor, who typically neither has 
control over ground conditions nor 
knowledge of hidden hazards. For 
example, an HVAC subcontractor will 
usually not have the contractual 
authority to alter site conditions and 
will not know about hidden conditions 
such as sewer lines under the area 
where the crane will be located. 
Consequently, when ground conditions 
are inadequate, the subcontractor is 
typically unable to correct those 
conditions itself. Attempts to get other 
entities at the site to correct the 
conditions are often unsuccessful, 
which has led to cranes being set up on 
inadequate ground conditions. 

Another problem is that the entity 

that usually does have such authority— 
the controlling entity—may not have the 
expertise to know what changes are 
needed to make the ground conditions 
suitable for crane operations. This 
proposed section is designed to address 
these problems so that ground 
conditions will be made sufficient for 
safe crane operations. 
Paragraph 1402(a) Definitions 

Proposed paragraph (a) provides 

definitions of key terms used in this 
proposed section. 

The term ‘‘ground conditions’’ would 

be defined as the ability of the ground 
to support the equipment (including 
slope, compaction and firmness). The 
Committee believed that slope, 
compaction and firmness are the key 
factors that are involved in the ability of 
the ground to support the equipment. 

‘‘Supporting materials’’ would be 
defined as meaning blocking, mats, 
cribbing, marsh buggies (in marshes/ 
wetlands), or similar supporting 
materials or devices. Such materials 
typically help to distribute the load of 
the crane over a broad area and/or assist 
in leveling the equipment. The list in 
the definition of examples of such 
materials is nonexclusive—it includes 
similar materials and devices that 
would serve the same purpose(s). 
Paragraph 1402(b) 

Under proposed paragraph (b), the 
equipment would be prohibited from 
being assembled or used unless ground 
conditions are firm, drained (except for 
marshes/wetlands), and graded to a 
sufficient extent so that, in conjunction 
(if necessary) with the use of supporting 
materials, the equipment manufacturer’s 

specifications for adequate support and 
degree of level of the equipment are 
met. A crane’s stability depends (in 
part) on the crane being level, and 
‘‘degree of level’’ is a term used in the 
industry to describe the manufacturer’s 
specification for how level the crane 
must be. 

The Committee believed that crane 

tip-over incidents caused by inadequate 
ground conditions are a significant 
cause of injuries and fatalities. 
Conditions that enhance the chance of 
such accidents include ground that is 
wet or muddy, poorly graded, or that is 
loose fill (or otherwise disturbed soil) 
that has not been compacted. The 
Committee believed that requiring 
adequate ground conditions will 
prevent many of these accidents. 

This proposed provision would not 
require the ground conditions alone to 
be sufficient to support the equipment. 
The Committee recognized that such a 
requirement would be unnecessarily 
restrictive, since adequate support can 
often be achieved with the use of 
supporting materials. However, 
supporting materials cannot compensate 
for all ground condition problems. As a 
result, the Committee found that an 
appropriate approach would be to 
require that ground conditions be 
sufficiently firm, drained (except for 
marshes/wetlands) and graded to a 
sufficient extent so that, in conjunction 
(if necessary) with supporting materials, 
the support and degree of level would 
be adequate. ‘‘Adequate’’ in this context 
would mean sufficient to meet the 
equipment manufacturer’s 
specifications for support and degree of 
level of the equipment. 

In practical terms, the ultimate test of 
whether this criterion is met is whether 
the equipment can be set up so that it 
is within the manufacturer’s 
specifications for the needed support for 
the equipment and the degree of level of 
the equipment and whether it can 
remain within those specifications 
while in use. 

The Committee considered using 

more specific criteria, such as 
specifications for slope, compaction and 
firmness. That approach was rejected by 
the Committee for two reasons. First, in 
its view, such specifications would be 
unduly burdensome since employers 
would need to conduct complex tests 
with sophisticated instruments to 
ensure compliance. Second, it believed 
that such tests are unnecessary because 
the person or persons supervising the 
equipment assembly and the crane 
operator would have sufficient expertise 
to assess the adequacy of ground 
conditions without the use of complex

ground assessment tests and related 
instruments. 

The individual (or team) supervising 
the equipment assembly (referred to in 
proposed § 1926.1404(a) as the ‘‘A/D 
supervisor’’) would, under proposed 
§ 1926.1404(a), individually or 
collectively meet the definition of both 
a competent and qualified person. Also, 
under proposed § 1926.1427 (and 
specifically proposed 
§ 1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(E)(1)), the crane 
operator would have technical 
knowledge applicable to the suitability 
of the supporting ground and surface to 
handle expected loads. In view of that 
level of knowledge, the Committee 
believed that both the A/D supervisor 
and the crane operator would be able to 
assess the adequacy of ground 
conditions without the use of complex 
ground assessment tests and related 
instruments. 

OSHA notes that proposed 

§ 1926.1402(e) refers to the ‘‘individual’’ 
supervising the equipment assembly. 
Since the individual or individuals 
supervising the equipment assembly are 
referred to throughout this proposed 
rule as the ‘‘A/D supervisor,’’ 4 OSHA 
has, for clarity, replaced the phrase 
‘‘individual supervising the equipment 
assembly’’ in § 1926.1402(e) with ‘‘A/D 
supervisor.’’ 

Proposed paragraph 1402(b) would 

require the ground to be drained except 
for marshes/wetlands. This exception 
was included because the Committee 
was aware that, in many instances, the 
draining of marshes/wetlands is 
prohibited or restricted by 
environmental laws. Since there are 
devices available, such as marsh 
buggies, that are designed to provide 
adequate support to cranes in such areas 
(a marsh buggy is a device designed to 
support equipment such as a crane in 
swampy terrain; it can cross such terrain 
with that equipment on board), the 
Committee believed that such an 
exception would be appropriate. 
Paragraph 1402(c) 

Under proposed paragraph 1402(c), 

the controlling entity would have 
several specific duties regarding ground 
conditions. ‘‘Controlling entity’’ is 
defined in proposed § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a 
prime contractor, general contractor, 
construction manager or any other legal 
entity which has the overall 
responsibility for the construction of the 
project—its planning, quality and 
completion.’’ This definition, which 
mirrors the definition of ‘‘controlling 
contractor’’ in the steel erection 

4 ‘‘A/D supervisor’’ is defined in proposed 

§ 1926.1401, Definitions.

standard, subpart R of 29 CFR part 1926, 
reflects the core principle of general 
supervisory control over the 
construction site as the central theme of 
the concept. The Committee believed 
that ‘‘controlling entity’’ would be a 
better term for this concept than 
‘‘controlling contractor’’ because some 
employers may mistakenly believe that 
‘‘controlling contractor’’ refers only to 
general contractors. Since in some 
instances an entity other than a general 
contractor has general supervisory 
control of the worksite, such an entity 
would meet the terms of the definition. 
Proposed paragraph 1402(c)(1) would 
require the controlling entity to ensure 
that ground preparations necessary to 
meet the requirements in proposed 
paragraph (b) of this section are 
provided. 

Currently, Subpart N does not specify 

who is responsible for providing for 
such preparations. In effect, reliance is 
placed on the various parties to work 
out who would have such responsibility 
through contractual arrangements. In 
the experience of a number of 
Committee members, in many instances 
the parties are unable to agree on who 
will have (or has) that contractual 
responsibility, with the result that 
inadequate ground conditions often do 
not get corrected. Consequently, the 
Committee believed that it is necessary 
to specify who will have ground 
condition responsibility. 

In the Committee’s view, the crane 

user and operator typically do not have 
the equipment or authority to make 
such preparations. In contrast, the 
controlling entity, due to its control of 
the worksite, has the requisite authority 
and is in the best position to arrange for 
adequate ground conditions. The 
Committee considered the fact that 
some controlling entities claim to not 
know when a crane will arrive at the 
site, and would therefore be unable to 
timely arrange for the necessary ground 
condition preparations. However, the 
Committee found this unpersuasive. It 
believed that the controlling entity, by 
virtue of its control over the site and 
normal business responsibilities for the 
construction project itself, is fully able 
to be cognizant of construction 
schedules and information about crane 
use by its subcontractors. 

The Committee was concerned, 

however, that some controlling entities 
may lack the expertise to recognize 
when ground conditions are inadequate. 
To address this concern, the Committee 
developed proposed § 1926.1402(e). 
Under that proposed provision, if the 
A/D supervisor or the operator 
determines that ground conditions do 
not meet the requirements in proposed 

paragraph (b) of this section, that 
person’s employer would be required to 
have a discussion with the controlling 
entity.5 This discussion would concern 
the ground preparations that are needed 
so that, with the use of suitable 
supporting materials/devices (if 
necessary), the requirements in 
proposed paragraph (b) of this section 
can be met. This discussion would serve 
as a mechanism for those with expertise 
regarding the ground conditions needed 
to meet proposed paragraph (b) of this 
section to convey that information to the 
entity responsible for making the 
necessary preparations. 

Proposed paragraph 1402(c)(2) 
addresses the problem of hidden 
hazards beneath the equipment set-up 
area. Open spaces underground, such as 
from voids, tanks, and utilities such as 
sewer, water supply and drain pipes, 
can greatly compromise the ability of 
the ground above them to support the 
equipment. At the set-up area, there are 
often no readily apparent visual clues 
above ground that such hazards exist 
under the area. In the experience of 
members of the Committee, because of 
the hidden nature of these hazards, 
accidents have occurred when cranes 
have been set up above such hazards 
and a portion of the ground has given 
way. 

Under proposed paragraph 1402(c)(2), 
the controlling entity would be required 
to inform the user of the equipment and 
the equipment operator of the location 
of hazards beneath the equipment set-up 
area (such as voids, tanks, utilities) that 
are identified in documents (such as site 
drawings, as-built drawings, and soil 
analyses) if they are available to the 
controlling entity. 

In developing this proposed 

provision, the Committee was mindful 
that the controlling entity often has 
access to documents that may identify 
the location of such hazards. For 
example, a sewer line may be marked on 
a site drawing, an as-built drawing, or 
in a soil analysis. Under this proposed 
provision, if the controlling entity has 
such a document, whether at the site or 
at an off-site location, it would be 
required to inform the equipment user 
and operator of the location of the 
hazard as identified in it. If the 

5 The SBREFA Panel recommended that OSHA 

consider whether use of the words ‘‘determine’’ and 
‘‘demonstrate’’ would require employers to make 
and keep records to support such determinations 
and demonstrations. OSHA notes that records 
would not be required in these instances. Only 
where this proposal explicitly requires the 
employer to maintain records or documentation 
(see, e.g., proposed § 1926.1412(e)(3) on 
documentation of monthly inspections) is an 
employer required to create and/or maintain 
records.

controlling entity does not possess such 
a document, it would not be required to 
obtain it from another source. 

The proposed provision would not 

require the controlling entity to identify 
hazards that are not identified in such 
documents. In other words, it would not 
require the controlling entity to arrange 
for tests to be done at the site to 
determine if such hazards are present. 
The Committee believed that such a 
requirement would be unduly 
burdensome on the controlling entity. In 
its view the proposed provision would 
be sufficient because such hazards are 
typically identified in these documents 
in the normal course of business. 

The Committee also believed that the 
duty to provide this information should 
be limited to hazards identified in 
documents that are available to the 
controlling entity. Requiring the 
controlling entity to obtain such 
information from other sources would, 
in effect, require it to arrange for testing. 
As explained above, the Committee 
believed such a duty would be unduly 
burdensome and unnecessary. 

During the SBREFA meeting an SER 
commented on the difficulty and time 
consumed in getting approval from the 
controlling entity to make sure ground 
conditions were adequate, especially 
since many controlling entities were 
resistant to checking the site themselves 
for adequate ground conditions. The 
commenter further stated that his 
company relies on the steel erectors to 
test ground conditions for the proper 
support and that this system seems to 
work fine. OSHA notes that while the 
proposed rule would not preclude such 
arrangements, the responsibility for 
meeting the requirements of proposed 
paragraph (c) would nonetheless rest 
with controlling entity. Moreover, 
OSHA believes that this comment is 
illustrative of the need for the standard 
to require the controlling entity’s 
involvement in this phase of the project. 

Another SER expressed concern that 

the rule could not be properly 
implemented due to the number of 
communication channels a 
subcontractor would have to juggle 
before finally getting in contact with the 
controlling entity. For example, a 
subcontractor may have to go through 
several other subcontractors before it 
reaches the controlling entity. OSHA 
believes that, if controlling entities had 
the responsibilities set out in proposed 
paragraph (c), controlling entities would 
be more likely to facilitate such 
communication.

provides that the requirement in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be 
met by the employer that has authority 
at the site to make or arrange for ground 
preparations needed to meet paragraph 
(b) of this section. For example, if the 
employer who hires the crane has the 
authority to get the ground prepared in 
the absence of a controlling entity, the 
responsibility for complying with 
proposed paragraph (b) would fall to 
that employer. However, that employer 
would not be required to comply with 
proposed paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. This is because the information 
required to be disclosed under proposed 
paragraph (c)(2) is not likely to be 
available to that employer. 
Paragraph 1402(e) 

Proposed paragraph 1402(e) would 

establish a mechanism for a controlling 
entity to obtain information from the A/ 
D supervisor or the equipment operator 
about insufficient ground conditions 
and the preparations needed to correct 
the problem. Specifically (as discussed 
above in the context of proposed 
§ 1926.1402(c)(1)), if the A/D supervisor 
or equipment operator determines that 
ground conditions do not meet the 
criteria in proposed paragraph (b) of this 
section, that person’s employer would 
be required to have a discussion with 
the controlling entity regarding the 
ground preparations needed so that, 
with the use of suitable supporting 
materials/devices (if necessary), the 
requirements in proposed paragraph (b) 
can be met. 

The Committee believed that, in some 

instances, the controlling entity may 
lack the expertise needed to know what 
ground preparations may be needed. In 
such cases, it is necessary for the 
information it needs to be provided by 
the A/D supervisor or operator, who 
have that expertise, so that the 
preparations needed for safe crane 
operations can be made. 

For example, controlling entity C, 

who has experience working with only 
relatively light, low capacity cranes, 
believes that the ground in set-up area 
Q is suitable. However, the crane that is 
going to be used is a high capacity 
crane. Because of the substantially 
greater weight of the high capacity 
crane, a greater degree of compaction of 
the soil in set-up area Q is needed. 
When the operator of the high capacity 
crane arrives at the site, the operator 
recognizes the need for more 
compaction. In this example, under this 
proposed provision, the operator’s 
employer would then be required to 
have a discussion with controlling 
entity C regarding the need for greater 
compaction. As a result of the ensuing 

discussion, controlling entity C would 
have the additional information it needs 
so that it could then comply with 
proposed paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
by ensuring that the additional 
compaction needed to meet the criteria 
in proposed paragraph (b) of this section 
is performed. 

Also, proposed § 1926.1402(e) would 
place a duty on the employer of the A/ 
D supervisor or equipment operator 
irrespective of a controlling entity’s lack 
of expertise. For example, if the 
controlling entity fails to ensure 
necessary ground condition 
preparations, action would be required 
of the A/D supervisor’s or operator’s 
employer. If either determined that 
ground conditions were insufficient to 
meet the proposed paragraph (b) 
criteria, that employer would be 
required to discuss the preparations that 
needed to be made with the controlling 
entity. The Committee believed that, in 
such circumstances, such a discussion 
would make it more likely that the 
requirements in proposed paragraph (b) 
would be met which, as discussed 
above, is necessary for safe crane 
operations. 
Sections 1403–1406 Assembly and 
Disassembly 

Proposed §§ 1926.1403 through 

1926.1406 set out requirements 
designed to ensure the safety of 
employees while equipment is 
assembled and disassembled, which 
includes the erecting and dismantling of 
tower cranes. C–DAC members 
indicated that, in their experience, the 
failure to adequately address hazards 
associated with these processes is a 
significant cause of injuries and 
fatalities. Two analyses of data support 
their view. 

A recent analysis of data published in 
the Journal of Construction Engineering 
and Management, authored by J.E. 
Beavers, J.R. Moore, R. Rinehart and 
W.R. Schriver, found that being 
‘‘crushed during assembly/disassembly’’ 
was the third highest proximate cause of 
crane related fatalities during 1997 to 
2003.6 (OSHA–2007–0066–0012). 
Contributing physical factors included 
improper assembly, improper 
disassembly (specifically, pin removal), 
and improper boom support. The study 
indicates that these assembly/ 
disassembly fatalities occurred while

words ‘‘erecting,’’ ‘‘climbing,’’ and 
‘‘dismantling,’’ are used, and the 
definition of ‘‘assembly/disassembly’’ 
makes it clear that §§ 1926.1403–1406 
apply to tower cranes and, for that 
purpose, use tower crane terminology. 
Proposed § 1926.1403 would require 

fatalities from 1984 to 1994.7 This study 
determined that crane assembly and 
disassembly was the second leading 
cause of crane related fatalities, 
comprising 12% (or 58 deaths) of the 
total number of crane fatalities from 
1984 to 1994. More specifically, a 
majority of these fatalities involved 
lattice boom cranes and a relatively 
small number involved tower cranes.8 
Almost 90 percent of the fatalities 
involving lattice boom cranes resulted 
when employees were removing boom 
pins from underneath an unsupported 
boom. (A. Suruda, et al., ‘‘Crane-Related 
Deaths in the U.S. Construction 
Industry, 1984–94’’ (1997) (OSHA– 
2007–0066–0013).9 

The Committee also concluded that 
the most effective way to reduce these 
injuries and fatalities would be to have 
a standard that comprehensively 
addresses these hazards. 

Note that the term ‘‘procedures’’ 

which is used in the proposed 
assembly/disassembly provisions is 
defined (see § 1926.1401) to include (but 
is not limited to) instructions, diagrams, 
recommendations, warnings, 
specifications, protocols and 
limitations. The operation of an ‘‘assist’’ 
crane used to help in the assembly/ 
disassembly process is not covered by 
the assembly/disassembly requirements 
but is covered by the other sections of 
this proposed standard. 
Section 1403 Assembly/Disassembly— 
Selection of Manufacturer or Employer 
Procedures 

In § 1926.1401, ‘‘assembly/ 

disassembly’’ is defined to mean ‘‘the 
assembly and/or disassembly of 
equipment covered under this standard. 
With regard to tower cranes, ‘erecting 
and climbing’ replaces the term 
‘assembly,’ and ‘dismantling’ replaces 
the term ‘disassembly.’ ’’ C–DAC did not 
originally include a definition of 
‘‘assembly/disassembly,’’ but OSHA 
added this definition to avoid any 
implication that §§ 1926.1403–1406 on 
‘‘assembly/disassembly’’ do not apply to 
tower cranes because the terms 
‘‘assembly’’ and ‘‘disassembly’’ are not 
commonly used in the industry in 
referring to tower cranes. Instead, the 

7 This study was limited to crane related fatalities 

in the U.S. construction industry. 

8 Out of the 58 fatalities, 93% involved lattice 

boom cranes and 7% involved tower cranes. 
9 In contrast, a 34-year study (1969–2002) 

conducted by the Province of Ontario indicates that 
dismantling the boom is not a leading cause of 
mobile crane fatalities. This study concluded that 
dismantling the boom ranked sixth out of eight 
causes of mobile crane fatalities within the Province 
of Ontario during 1969 through 2002. Dismantling 
the boom comprised only 4% of the fatalities during 
this time period. (OSHA–2007–0066–0009).

methods that could be used to address 
them made specifying particular, 
detailed actions impractical and 
needlessly inflexible. For those, C–DAC 
decided to require that the hazard be 
addressed but to have an Assembly/ 
Disassembly supervisory (A/D 
supervisor) determine how to deal with 
them; these are covered in paragraph 
(h). Note that the requirements in 
proposed § 1926.1404 would apply 
irrespective of whether manufacturer or 
employer procedures were used. 
New Issue 

The Agency has been investigating a 

March 15, 2008 collapse of a tower 
crane in New York City. One aspect of 
that investigation has focused on the use 
of synthetic slings in the process of 
attaching a bracing collar to the tower 
(the installation of such collars is part 
of the crane assembly process). This 
prompted the Agency to examine the 
existing OSHA standards applicable to 
the use of synthetic slings during crane 
assembly/disassembly. 

In the course of that examination, 
OSHA has determined that neither 
Subpart N nor 29 CFR 1926.251, Rigging 
equipment for material handling, 
specifically addresses the hazard posed 
when a synthetic sling is used in a 
manner that can cause compression or 
distortion of the sling, or when the sling 
is in contact with a sharp edge. 
Consequently, the Agency is 
considering adding a provision to 
§ 1926.1404 to address these hazards.10 
One way of addressing these hazards 

would be to prohibit the use of synthetic 
slings in the assembly/disassembly of 
equipment covered by this proposed 
standard. Another way that the Agency 
is considering to address these hazards 
is to require padding or similar 
measures when needed to protect the 
slings from being damaged such as from 
being cut, compressed or distorted. 
OSHA requests public comment on this 
issue. 
Paragraph 1404(a) Supervision— 
Competent—Qualified Person 

Proposed paragraph (a) would require 

supervision of the assembly/ 
disassembly process by an ‘‘A/D 
supervisor.’’ Section 1926.1401 defines 
‘‘A/D supervisor’’ as ‘‘an individual who 
meets this proposed paragraph’s criteria 
for being an A/D supervisor, irrespective 
of the person’s formal job title or 
whether the person is non-management 
or management personnel.’’ C–DAC 
defined the term in this way to make 

10 C–DAC did not consider hazards associated 
with the use of synthetic slings during assembly/ 
disassembly. 

employers to choose among two 
options: Assemble and disassemble 
cranes and derricks by following the 
manufacturer’s procedures, or use their 
own assembly/disassembly procedures 
(if they meet the proposed rule’s criteria 
in § 1926.1406). Note, though, that the 
assembly/disassembly requirements in 
proposed §§ 1926.1404 and 1405 must 
be met regardless of which option the 
employer selects. 

Committee members discussed 

whether employers should be required 
to comply with the manufacturer’s 
procedures, or if deviations from those 
procedures should be allowed. The 
Committee determined, and OSHA 
agrees, that deviations should be 
allowed for two reasons. First, 
manufacturers’ procedures are typically 
designed for use in ‘‘ideal’’ 
environments: Large, flat, dry, 
unencumbered open areas. However, 
such conditions are not typical, 
especially in urban areas. Consequently, 
employers are currently unable to 
implement those procedures in those 
situations. Second, members were of the 
view that there is often more than one 
way to safely assemble and disassemble 
a crane, and that it is unnecessary to 
mandate that in every case the 
manufacturer procedures be used. 

The Committee also agreed that, while 

use of methods other than those of the 
manufacturer should be allowed, such 
employer-developed procedures need to 
meet certain benchmarks (see the 
criteria in proposed § 1926.1406) to 
ensure that they are adequate to protect 
the employees during the assembly/ 
disassembly process. 
Section 1404 Assembly/Disassembly— 
General Requirements (Applies to All 
Assembly and Disassembly Operations) 
In examining the underlying causes of 

fatalities and injuries from assembly/ 
disassembly accidents, the Committee 
determined that a systematic, proactive 
approach, designed to highlight the key 
hazards involved, was needed. C–DAC 
developed a list of those hazards and 
then considered how to deal with each 
one. It became apparent in that 
discussion that the action needed to 
address some of these hazards is 
specific and straightforward. These are 
addressed in paragraphs (a) through (g) 
and (j) through (q) of this proposed 
section. However, with regard to others, 
the wide variety of circumstances and

clear that it is the substance of the 
individual’s qualifications, and not his 
or her job title or position in the 
company hierarchy, that determines 
whether the person is qualified to act as 
an A/D supervisor. 

The A/D supervisor would have to 

meet the definition of both a 
‘‘competent’’ and ‘‘qualified’’ person as 
OSHA defines those terms.11 The 
Committee believed that having an A/D 
supervisor overseeing the assembly/ 
disassembly process who had both the 
authority to correct a hazard or stop the 
process and who had the expertise of a 
qualified person was necessary to 
ensure the safety of the operation. 

Many of the hazards involved in the 
process are not obvious to those with 
limited knowledge and experience in 
assembly/disassembly. There are 
numerous scenarios in which there is 
stored kinetic energy in the equipment’s 
component parts. The installation or 
removal of components in the wrong 
order, or using the wrong procedure, 
can release that energy in ways that 
would be unexpected to those with little 
knowledge of the process. 

For example, failure to place blocking 
in the correct position under a boom can 
lead to unexpected movement or 
collapse of the boom when a pin that is 
in tension is removed. Workers 
unfamiliar with the concept of pins in 
tension may not recognize the dangers 
of removing it in that circumstance. 
Having a person overseeing the process 
that has the expertise needed to know 
how the process is supposed to be done, 
the ability to recognize dangerous 
situations and how to remedy them, and 
the authority to take corrective action, is 
crucial to ensuring that the assembly/ 
disassembly process is completed 
safely. 

The Committee agreed that the A/D 

supervisor did not have to be one 
individual since two people (one with 
the requisite expertise and the other 
with the authority to take corrective 
action), working as a team, would be as 
effective in overseeing the process as 
one individual. 

11 Proposed § 1926.1401, Definitions, defines a 

‘‘competent person’’ as: One who is capable of 
identifying existing and predictable hazards in the 
surroundings or working conditions which are 
unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to employees, 
and who has authorization to take prompt 
corrective measures to eliminate them. Section 1401 
defines a ‘‘qualified person’’ in this proposed 
standard as: One who, by possession of a 
recognized degree, certificate, or professional 
standing, or who by extensive knowledge, training, 
and experience, has successfully demonstrated his 
ability to solve or resolve problems relating to the 
subject matter, the work, or the project. These 
definitions are essentially the same as the 
definitions in 29 CFR 1926.32(f) and 29 CFR 
1926.32(m).

The A/D supervisor would oversee 
the implementation of the proposed 
requirements in paragraphs (a) through 
(g) and (j) through (q) of this proposed 
section, and would also address the 
hazards as described in paragraph (h) of 
this proposed section. 
Paragraphs 1404(b) Knowledge of the 
Procedures, and 1404(c), Review of the 
Procedures 

Proposed paragraph (b) would require 
that the A/D supervisor understand the 
assembly/disassembly procedures. In 
addition, proposed paragraph (c) 
requires the A/D supervisor to review 
them prior to starting the process unless 
experience in having used them on the 
same type and configuration of 
equipment makes their review 
unnecessary. One example would be an 
A/D supervisor who has overseen the 
erection of a tower crane with the same 
configuration for numerous jobs in the 
past year. If that A/D supervisor had, 
through that repetitive experience, 
developed a knowledge and 
understanding of the assembly 
procedures to the point where reviewing 
them prior to beginning assembly was 
no longer necessary, he/she would not 
be required to review them. 

Without a thorough knowledge of 

these procedures, the A/D supervisor 
would be unable to ensure that the 
assembly/disassembly process is 
conducted safely. 
Paragraph 1404(d) Crew Instructions 

Under this proposed provision, before 

beginning assembly/disassembly 
operations, the A/D supervisor would 
have to determine that the crew 
members understand their tasks and the 
associated hazards, as well as any 
hazardous positions/locations that they 
need to avoid. 

The Committee was of the view that 

accidents during assembly/disassembly 
are often caused by misunderstandings 
of the employees working in the 
assembly/disassembly crew as to their 
tasks and how they are to be performed, 
as well as a failure to recognize 
potentially dangerous areas in and 
around the equipment. The details of 
these tasks and, in particular, the 
location of danger areas from which 
workers need to keep themselves and 
their extremities clear, often vary from 
one machine to another. Having the 
A/D supervisor check to make sure that 
the crew members know this essential 
information before starting the 
assembly/disassembly process would 
be, in the Committee’s view, an effective 
and practical means of addressing this 
aspect of the problem. 

Paragraph 1404(e) Protecting 
Assembly/Disassembly Crew Members 
Out of Operator View 

One of the hazards identified by the 
Committee is an operator swinging or 
moving the crane/derrick when 
assembly/disassembly personnel are in 
a crush/caught-in-between zone and out 
of the operator’s view. The Committee 
believed that an effective and practical 
means of preventing these accidents 
would be through a communication 
procedure that would provide key 
information to, and coordination 
between, the operator and these 
workers. 

This provision would therefore 

require that the crew member inform the 
operator that he/she is going to a 
location in, on, under, or near the 
equipment or load that is out of view of 
the operator where the movement of the 
equipment could injure the worker. The 
operator would be prohibited from 
moving any part of the crane/derrick or 
load until the operator gives a warning 
(the significance of which is understood 
by the crew member) and sufficient time 
for the crew member to move to a safe 
location, or the operator is informed 
through a pre-arranged means of 
communication that the crew member 
has moved to a safe location. Committee 
members indicated that the use of the 
(understood) warning coupled with 
sufficient time to exit, and the use of a 
pre-arranged means of communication, 
are each currently used by many 
employers and have proved to be 
effective. 

One Committee member suggested 
that instead of requiring that the crew 
member directly inform the operator of 
his/her location, the rule should permit 
the crew member to provide this 
information to the operator through a 
third person. For example, the crew 
member would instruct his/her foreman 
to radio the information to the operator. 
Such a change could be made by 
changing the last phrase in proposed 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section to read, 
‘‘the crew member shall inform the 
operator directly or through someone 
instructed by the crew member that the 
crew member is going to that location.’’ 
OSHA is asking for public comment on 
this suggestion. In particular, OSHA is 
asking for comment on whether this 
approach would be as protective of the 
crew members as the proposal, given 
that it would allow indirect 
communication between the crew 
members and the operator.

59744 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Paragraph 1404(f) Working Under the 
Boom, Jib or Other Components 

The proposed provision would 

establish a general prohibition against 
employees being under the component 
when pins or similar devices are being 
removed (note that this provision is 
similar to section 5–3.1.3(l) of ASME 
B30.5–2004). An exception is provided 
for instances where the employer 
demonstrates that site constraints 
require being positioned under the 
component and the employer takes 
steps to minimize the risk of dangerous 
movement and duration and extent of 
exposure. 

The Committee discussed the 
inherently hazardous nature of 
removing pins while being under the 
boom (and jib or similar components). If 
the wrong pins are removed while 
employees are under the component, it 
can move or collapse, posing a severe 
hazard to the worker. Even when pins 
are removed in the correct order, there 
may be unexpected stresses in the 
component which, as stored kinetic 
energy that may not be apparent until 
that energy is released upon the removal 
of the pin—at which time unexpected 
movement of the component may result. 
While other proposed provisions in the 
assembly/disassembly sections address 
this same hazard in other ways, these 
provisions in combination form a 
layered approach to safety. 

The Committee discussed whether 

any exceptions should be allowed to the 
prohibition against workers being under 
the component during pin removal. It 
determined, after considerable 
discussion, that the only type of 
situation where it may be inappropriate 
to apply the prohibition involves site 
constraints. For example, in some 
circumstances there is no room to 
assemble/disassemble the boom 
horizontally using ground support, and 
the boom has to be assembled/ 
disassembled ‘‘in the air’’ (that is, at an 
angle well above horizontal, or over an 
area, such as a large excavation, where 
there is no ground available for 
support). In some of those situations, 
one or more employees may have to be 
under the boom for certain periods of 
time in the pin removal process. 

Therefore, the proposed provision 
includes an exception to cover such 
instances. However, in those instances 
the hazard of being under the 
component is still present. Because of 
that, the Committee believed it 
important to limit the application of the 
exception and, where it would apply, to 
ensure that steps would be taken to 
limit the risks involved. Therefore, the 
exception would be applicable only

where the employer demonstrates that 
site constraints require being positioned 
under the component and the employer 
takes steps to minimize the risk of 
dangerous movement and duration and 
extent of exposure. 

An example of a method for 

minimizing that risk and the exposure is 
provided in proposed Non-Mandatory 
Appendix D. The Committee considered 
making that method mandatory, but 
decided to include it only as an example 
because there may be other effective 
methods, which should not be 
excluded. 
Paragraph 1404(g) Capacity Limits 

This proposed provision would 

require that the rated capacity limits for 
loads imposed on the equipment, each 
of its components, (including rigging), 
lifting lugs and equipment accessories 
being assembled or disassembled not be 
exceeded. The provision would apply 
‘‘during all phases of assembly/ 
disassembly.’’ One example of the risk 
created by not following capacity limits 
is the process of installing 
counterweights. In some cases the crane 
being assembled is used to install its 
own counterweights. Early in this 
process, when few counterweights are 
in place, the crane’s capacity will be so 
limited that swinging beyond a certain 
point, or booming out beyond a certain 
point, may cause it to overturn. 

It should be noted that where an assist 

crane is being used during the 
assembly/disassembly of another crane/ 
derrick, the requirements for rated 
capacity during operations must be met 
under proposed § 1926.1417(o), 
Compliance with rated capacity, with 
respect to the assist crane. 
Paragraph 1404(h) Addressing Specific 
Hazards 

For assembly and disassembly, this 

provision sets out specific hazard topics 
which the A/D supervisor must address. 
The Committee believed that requiring 
specific means and methods for 
protecting against these hazards (and, 
where specified goals are stated, for 
attaining those goals) would be too 
limiting. Therefore, the A/D supervisor 
must consider each listed hazard, 
determine the appropriate means of 
addressing it, and oversee the 
implementation of that method. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(1) Site and Ground 
Bearing Conditions 

This proposed provision would work 

in conjunction with proposed 
§ 1926.1402, which addresses ground 
conditions for both assembly/ 
disassembly and use of the equipment, 
including ground condition criteria. 

Proposed § 1926.1404(h)(1) would 
require the A/D supervisor to assess the 
ground conditions for conformance with 
those criteria, and to assess the site for 
suitability for assembly and 
disassembly. 

Before beginning assembly/ 

disassembly, the A/D supervisor would 
have to make the determination that 
ground bearing conditions are adequate 
to support the equipment during 
assembly/disassembly (the concept of 
adequate ground bearing conditions is 
discussed in detail above regarding 
proposed § 1926.1402). In addition, the 
A/D supervisor would have to consider 
the adequacy of site conditions which 
might affect the safety of assembly or 
disassembly. For example, at a 
construction site in an industrial facility 
with overhead piping carrying 
hazardous materials, the A/D supervisor 
would have to consider the potential for 
the equipment contacting the piping in 
determining where and how to conduct 
the assembly/disassembly operations. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(2) Blocking 
Material and 1404(h)(3) Proper Location 
of Blocking 

These two provisions address the 
hazards associated with inadequate 
blocking. ‘‘Blocking’’ (also referred to as 
‘‘cribbing’’) is defined in § 1926.1401 as 
‘‘wood or other material used to support 
equipment or a component and 
distribute loads to the ground. Typically 
used to support latticed boom sections 
during assembly/disassembly and under 
outrigger floats.’’ This definition is from 
the SC&RF Handbook. 

Proper blocking plays an important 
role in assembly/disassembly safety. 
Blocking is used in a variety of 
circumstances to compensate for minor 
ground sloping and/or to enhance 
stability by spreading out the area over 
which forces from the load are 
transferred to the ground. It is used to 
help support assembled equipment 
(usually placed under outrigger pads) 
and during assembly/disassembly to 
support components. Blocking that is 
undersized, insufficient in type or 
number, in poor condition, and/or 
stacked in an unstable manner could 
lead to a failure of support and 
consequent unplanned movement or 
collapse of the equipment or 
component. 

When used to support lattice booms 

or lattice components, the failure to 
place blocking in the correct location 
could have several dangerous 
consequences. For example, incorrect 
placement in some instances could 
cause a part of the lattice boom/ 
component to bear too much force and 
damage it. That damage could

compromise structural integrity and, in 
some cases, may not be immediately 
noticed. If the assembly process were to 
continue nonetheless, the boom/ 
component could fail. 

Improper blocking location may also 
result in a failure to provide adequate 
support of the boom/component. One 
example is blocking used to provide 
support to a boom section that will need 
it later in the disassembly process, such 
as after pins are removed. If the blocking 
is in the wrong place, once the pins are 
removed, unplanned movement or 
collapse could result. Note that 
proposed § 1926.1404(h)(3) on proper 
blocking location is similar to section 5– 
3.1.3(k) of ASME B30.5–2004 (blocking 
to be appropriately placed to prevent 
inadvertent dropping of the boom). 
Proposed paragraph (h)(3) (Proper 

location of blocking) is unchanged from 
the C–DAC document and its 
applicability is limited to lattice booms 
and components. However, it is the 
Agency’s understanding that other types 
of booms and components (i.e., those for 
hydraulic cranes) also are at times 
assembled and disassembled in the field 
and may similarly need blocking. 
Consequently, it appears to the Agency 
that it may be appropriate to broaden 
the provision so that it would apply to 
all booms and components, not just 
lattice boom and components. OSHA is 
soliciting comments from the public on 
whether proposed paragraph (h)(3) of 
this section should be broadened to 
apply to all booms and components. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(4) Verifying Assist 
Crane Loads 

This proposed paragraph requires 
that, when using an assist crane, the 
loads that will be imposed on the assist 
crane at each phase of assembly/ 
disassembly must be verified in 
accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1417(o)(3) to avoid exceeding the 
assist crane’s rated capacity. ‘‘Assist 
crane’’ is defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a 
crane used to assist in assembling or 
disassembling a crane.’’ When used for 
this purpose, an ‘‘assist crane’’ is subject 
to all applicable provisions of this 
standard, including the requirement of 
proposed paragraph (o) of this section 
that it not be used in a manner that 
exceeds its rated capacity. 

The Committee was concerned that, at 

times, resulting loads on assist cranes 
during the assembly/disassembly 
process are not properly anticipated. For 
example, when a boom is being 
disassembled in a cantilevered position, 
an assist crane is sometimes used to 
help support the boom. In some 
instances, the load prior to pin removal 
is within the assist crane’s rated 

capacity, but exceeds its rated capacity 
once the pins are removed, causing a 
collapse. 

The Committee discussed having one 

section on capacity limits for 
equipment, equipment components and 
accessories as well as for any assist 
equipment used while assembling or 
disassembling. The Committee agreed 
that having a separate section on 
capacity limits for assist cranes was less 
confusing and would help highlight the 
hazard as it pertains to assembly/ 
disassembly. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(5) Boom and Jib 
Pick Points 

This proposed provision would 

require the A/D supervisor to address 
the hazard of using improper boom and 
jib pick points. Specifically, the points 
of attachment of rigging to a boom/jib or 
boom/jib section(s) must be suitable for 
preventing structural damage. Such 
damage could compromise structural 
integrity and, in some cases, may not be 
immediately noticed. If that component 
were nonetheless used, the boom/ 
component could fail. 

The points of attachment also need to 

facilitate the safe handling of these 
components. Typically facilitating the 
safe handling of the boom/jib or boom/ 
jib sections means using pick points that 
will result in the boom/section being at 
an intended angle (that is, 90 degrees to 
the load line or some other intended 
angle) when hoisted. For example, if the 
boom/section is intended to be 
horizontal, and only one pick point is 
going to be used, the pick point must 
coincide with the center of gravity. If 
the boom/section is intended to be at 
some other angle, a pick point would 
need to be identified that would 
generate that intended angle. Failure to 
use an appropriate pick point in this 
regard can create a situation in which 
there is a greater likelihood of 
unintended movement in connecting or 
disconnecting the boom/section. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(6) Center of Gravity 

In a variety of instances the method 
used for maintaining stability during 
assembly/disassembly depends on 
supporting or rigging a component (or 
set of components) so that it remains 
balanced throughout the process. In 
such instances the A/D supervisor 
would be required to identify the center 
of gravity of the load. 

The ‘‘center of gravity’’ of an object is 
defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘the point in 
the object around which its weight is 
evenly distributed. If you could put a 
support under that point, you could 
balance the object on the support.’’ This

definition is similar to the one in the 
SC&RF Handbook. 

One example of where it would be 

necessary to identify the center of 
gravity is where the assembly/ 
disassembly crew relies on an assist 
crane to suspend a component in a 
horizontal position. In such instances 
the center of gravity must be identified 
in order to correctly install the rigging. 
If the center of gravity were not 
identified, employees might try to 
compensate by riding on the section/ 
component while it is being moved into 
place, which is quite dangerous. Also, 
in such a situation, if the component 
gets ‘‘hung-up,’’ it can move 
unexpectedly if it becomes freed. 

In contrast, some methods for 

maintaining stability do not depend on 
rigging or supporting the component to 
attain horizontal balance. For example, 
if two adjoining sections of a boom are 
being disconnected from each other, and 
both sections are supported at all four 
end points by blocking, identifying the 
center of gravity of each section would 
not normally be necessary. 

The Committee anticipated that there 

may be instances where the assembly/ 
disassembly method being used 
necessitates the identification of the 
center of gravity, but the employer is 
unable to get sufficient information to 
make that identification accurately. In 
those instances, measures would be 
required to be put in place that would 
prevent unintended dangerous 
movement resulting from an inaccurate 
identification of the center of gravity. 
An example of one such method is 
described in the proposed Non- 
Mandatory Appendix D of proposed 
subpart CC. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(7) Stability Upon 
Pin Removal 

This proposed paragraph requires that 

boom sections, boom suspension 
systems (such as gantry A-frames and jib 
struts) or components must be rigged or 
supported to maintain stability upon the 
removal of the pins. ‘‘Boom suspension 
systems’’ are defined in § 1926.1401 as 
‘‘a system of pendants, running ropes, 
sheaves, and other hardware which 
supports the boom tip and controls the 
boom angle.’’ This definition is the same 
as that for ‘‘boom suspension’’ in the 
SC&RF Handbook. 

The Committee identified the process 

of pin removal as one that has proved 
to be particularly hazardous. Potential 
energy in these sections, systems and 
components can be released suddenly 
during this process, resulting in 
unanticipated movement, ranging from 
shifting to collapse. Even small 
movements can result in injury,

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

including amputations; larger 
movements and collapses can cause 
fatal injuries. 

The Committee determined that the 

key to preventing these injuries and 
fatalities is through ensuring that the 
sections/components will remain stable 
upon the removal of the pins. Instability 
can have a variety of causes, including 
improper assembly/disassembly 
sequencing, improper rigging, 
incorrectly designed support, blocking 
failures and ground compression. 
Therefore, under this proposed 
provision, the A/D supervisor would be 
required to make sure that the sections/ 
components are rigged or supported by 
maintaining stability once the pins are 
removed. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(8) Snagging 

This proposed paragraph requires that 

suspension ropes and pendants not be 
allowed to catch on the boom or jib 
connection pins or cotter pins 
(including keepers and locking pins). In 
§ 1926.1401, ‘‘pendants’’ are defined to 
‘‘include both wire and bar types. Wire 
type: a fixed length of wire rope with 
mechanical fittings at both ends for 
pinning segments of wire rope together. 
Bar type: Instead of wire rope, a bar is 
used. Pendants are typically used in a 
latticed boom crane system to easily 
change the length of the boom 
suspension system without completely 
changing the rope on the drum when 
the boom length is increased or 
decreased.’’ This definition is similar to 
that in the SC&RF Handbook, but with 
the addition of the reference to ‘‘bar 
type’’ pendants. 

Many times the pendant cables hang 
alongside the boom and may get caught 
(snagged) on the pins, bolts, or keepers 
as the operator raises the boom. If this 
were to occur the cables could be 
damaged or the boom may rise then 
drop suddenly as a snagged cable 
releases from the pin. This can result in 
shock loading and damaging cables and 
components. For example, under this 
proposed provision, once all the boom 
sections are installed and the pendants 
are pinned together, the A/D supervisor 
must ensure that care is taken when 
raising the boom so that pendant cables 
and hoist cables do not snag on the pins 
or any other component during the 
boom raising process. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(9) Struck by 
Counterweights 

‘‘Counterweight’’ is defined in 
§ 1926.1401 as a ‘‘weight used to 
supplement the weight of equipment in 
providing stability for lifting loads by 
counterbalancing those loads.’’ This

definition is taken from the SC&RF 
Handbook. 

Counterweights are usually large, 

heavy plates made of steel and/or 
concrete. The A/D process typically 
involves the installation and removal of 
counterweights. This proposed 
provision would require that the A/D 
supervisor address the hazard of 
employees being struck by them during 
their installation/removal. During the 
installation/removal process, employees 
typically are in close proximity to them. 
An employee could be struck by a 
counterweight or crushed between it 
and the crane structure if it were to 
sway as it was being installed or 
removed. The A/D supervisor would be 
required to address this aspect of the 
hazard, such as by taking steps to have 
the operator minimize the amount of 
sway and by positioning the employees 
to minimize their hazard exposure. 

Additionally, after the counterweights 

are installed, the crane may have to 
swing to complete the boom assembly. 
The A/D supervisor would be required 
to address this aspect of the hazard as 
well, such as through the proper 
positioning of the employees and 
enhancing their awareness of the 
counterweight swing zone so that they 
will avoid being struck or crushed. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(10) Boom Hoist 
Brake Failure 

This proposed provision addresses a 

hazard that can occur both during 
assembly and disassembly, although it 
is more typically a hazard during 
assembly. In many older cranes the 
boom hoist brake mechanism has an 
external or internal mechanical brake 
band that operates by pressing against 
the hoist drum. As the configuration of 
the crane changes and, for example, 
more boom is added, this type of boom 
hoist brake may slip unless it has been 
adjusted to hold the extra weight. The 
Committee was concerned that the 
inability of an unadjusted brake to hold 
the increased load will not be evident 
until the additional boom section(s) has 
been added and the operator attempts to 
rely on the brake in a subsequent phase 
of the operation. If the operator does not 
first raise the boom a small amount after 
the section has been added (with the 
crew clear of the boom) to test the brake, 
employees could be injured later in the 
process when the operator manipulates 
the boom and finds that he/she is 
unable to brake it. 

To address this hazard, the employer 

would be required to test the brake to 
determine if it can hold the load. In 
many cases, if it is insufficient, an 
adjustment to the brake will correct the 
problem. If it remains insufficient, the 

employer would be required to use a 
boom hoist pawl, other locking device, 
back-up braking device, or another 
method of preventing dangerous boom 
movement (such as blocking or using an 
assist crane to support the load) from a 
boom hoist brake failure. 

The Agency is concerned that the text 

of the proposed provision may not be 
sufficiently clear regarding the timing of 
this brake test. OSHA’s interpretation is 
that the test would need to be done 
immediately after each section (or group 
of sections) is installed, and after all 
sections are in place. OSHA is soliciting 
public comment on this issue and if it 
is necessary to revise the language of the 
provision to clarify when the test must 
be done. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(11) Loss of 
Backward Stability 

The Committee identified three points 

during the assembly/disassembly 
process at which there is a heightened 
risk of loss of backward stability; these 
are: when swinging the upperworks, 
during travel, and when attaching or 
removing equipment components. 
Therefore, under this proposed 
provision, before any of these occur, the 
A/D supervisor would be required to 
consider whether precautions need to be 
instituted to ensure that backward 
stability is maintained. 

The illustration contained within the 

proposed requirements for loss of 
backward stability (§ 1926.1404(h)(11)) 
is taken from the ‘‘Mobile Crane 
Manual,’’ published by the Construction 
Safety Association of Ontario. 
Paragraph 1404(h)(12) Wind Speed 
and Weather 

Committee members believed that 
wind velocity and weather must be 
considered so that crane stability and 
capacity are not compromised. The 
Committee considered the option of 
establishing a maximum wind speed, as 
well as the option of incorporating 
ANSI’s provisions regarding wind 
speed. However, it believed that 
selecting any one particular speed as a 
maximum would be arbitrary because of 
the variety of factors involved. For 
example: different cranes and crane 
types vary with respect to the ‘‘sail’’ 
area they present; an assembly process 
involving use of an assist crane may 
require lower wind speeds than one in 
which no assist crane is used; and 
assembly/disassembly operations done 
‘‘in the air’’ (that is, with the boom 
elevated in the air, without ground 
support for the boom) may require lower 
wind speeds than a boom assembled/ 
disassembled on the ground.

59747 

The Committee ultimately decided 

that a better approach would be to have 
the A/D supervisor determine the 
maximum safe wind speed under the 
circumstances. 

Other weather conditions that can 

affect the safety of assembly/ 
disassembly would include, for 
example, ice accumulation on crane 
components. Ice can both add to the 
weight of the components and create 
slippery, dangerous surfaces on which 
employees work. The A/D supervisor 
must consider if weather conditions 
affect the safety of the operation. 

Paragraph 1404(i). [Reserved.] OSHA 

is proposing to reserve this paragraph 
because it can be difficult for readers to 
distinguish (i) from (j). 
Paragraph 1404(j) Cantilevered Boom 
Sections 

Members of the Committee believed 

that a common mistake in assembly/ 
disassembly is cantilevering too much 
boom. When too much boom is 
cantilevered structural failure can occur 
in components such as the mast/gantry, 
boom sections and lifting lugs. 
Employees may be struck by falling 
components from this type of failure. To 
prevent accidents from cantilevering too 
much boom during assembly/ 
disassembly, this provision would 
require manufacturer’s limitations on 
cantilevering not to be exceeded. 

If the manufacturer’s limitations were 

not available, the employer would be 
required to have a registered 
professional engineer (RPE) determine 
the appropriate limitations, and to abide 
by those limitations. The Committee 
believed that in such cases there would 
need to be a requirement that the RPE’s 
determination be in writing to ensure 
that the assessment has been done. 
Paragraph 1404(k) Weight of 
Components 

As with any load to be lifted by a 

crane/derrick, the weight of the 
components must be available to the 
operator so that the operator can 
determine if the lift can be performed 
within the crane/derrick’s capacity. This 
proposed requirement would apply 
irrespective of whether the component 
is being hoisted by the crane being 
assembled/disassembled or by an assist 
crane. 

Paragraph 1404(l). [Reserved.] OSHA 

is proposing to reserve this paragraph 
because it is inconvenient for readers to 
distinguish the letter ‘‘l’’ from the 
Arabic number ‘‘1.’’

Paragraph 1404(m) Components and 
Configuration 

This proposed provision deals with 

the selection of components that will be 
used to comprise the crane/derrick, the 
configuration of the equipment, and its 
inspection upon completion of 
assembly. Proper selection of 
components and proper configurations 
are explained in the manufacturer’s 
instructions, limitations, and 
specifications. Regarding component 
selection, the provision would address 
the hazards associated with use of 
components that the manufacturer had 
neither intended nor planned for 
incorporation into the equipment. 

The Committee believes that the use 

of such components could adversely 
affect the capacity and performance of 
the crane/derrick, cause the 
manufacturer’s specifications (including 
the load chart) and instructions to be 
inapplicable, and adversely affect other 
components on the crane/derrick. 

Similar hazards are posed by 

configuring the crane/derrick in a 
manner that does not accord with the 
manufacturer’s instructions, limitations 
and specifications. An example given by 
the Committee was trucks carrying 
boom sections arriving out of sequence. 
To save time, some employers assemble 
the sections in the order in which they 
arrive rather than waiting for the correct 
section. This would result in a crane/ 
derrick configured differently than 
intended by the manufacturer. Because 
the crane/derrick is designed and tested 
as a unit, the failure to configure the 
crane/derrick as the manufacturer had 
intended could present the same 
hazards as those described above for 
improper component selection. 

The Committee recognized that, 

especially in the case of very old 
equipment where the manufacturer no 
longer exists, there are instances where 
the employer can no longer obtain the 
manufacturer’s instructions, limitations 
and specifications regarding the 
selection of components and 
configuration of the equipment. In such 
instances the proposed provision would 
require that a registered professional 
engineer familiar with the type of 
equipment involved approve, in writing, 
the component selection and 
configuration. 

Another proposed section 

(§ 1926.1434) would allow cranes/ 
derricks to be modified under certain 
circumstances. To the extent a crane/ 
derrick were modified in accordance 
with that section, the employer would 
not be required to follow the 
manufacturer’s original instructions, 
limitations and specifications regarding 

component selection and configuration 
regarding those modifications. Instead, 
under proposed paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the employer would be 
required to follow the component 
selection and configuration 
requirements approved in accordance 
with proposed § 1926.1434. 

Finally, this proposed provision 

would require that the equipment be 
inspected after assembly has been 
completed to ensure that the component 
selection and configuration are correct. 
Paragraph 1404(n) Manufacturer 
Prohibitions 

As explained above regarding 

proposed § 1926.1403, an employer 
would be able to choose to use either 
manufacturer assembly/disassembly 
procedures or its own (as long as they 
met the requirements in proposed 
§ 1926.1406). However, in either case, 
the Committee believed that 
manufacturer prohibitions regarding 
assembly or disassembly would need to 
be met. In the Committee’s view, a 
prohibition specified by the 
manufacturer signals that, if not heeded, 
a significant hazard would likely be 
created. 
Paragraph 1404(o) Shipping Pins 
In order to properly address the 

hazards the Committee was concerned 
with, the Agency rewrote the language 
that C–DAC had originally agreed upon 
for this proposed provision. The original 
(C–DAC) language read as follows: 

(o) Shipping pins. Reusable shipping pins, 
straps, links and similar equipment must be 
removed and stowed in accordance with 
manufacturer instructions. 

In studying the regulatory text as it 
was originally drafted it appeared the 
language did not accurately reflect the 
intentions of the Committee. The 
provision was intended to address two 
hazards. The first hazard is the failure 
to remove items such as shipping pins, 
which if left in place during operation 
could damage the equipment. For 
example, if shipping pins are not 
removed and the boom is raised up, the 
boom could be damaged. The second 
hazard is injury to employees where 
items such as shipping pins are 
removed but not properly stowed (i.e., 
placed in a special hole or bracket 
designed to keep the item from being 
dislodged) or stored on the equipment 
(such as in an equipment box in the cab) 
after assembly. Where these items are 
left lying on the equipment and not 
properly stowed or stored they present 
a falling object hazard to employees. To 
better reflect the Committee’s intentions 
the Agency has altered the C–DAC 
language. The proposed provision reads:

(o) Shipping pins. Reusable shipping pins, 
straps, links and similar equipment must be 
removed. Once they are removed they must 
either be stowed or otherwise stored so that 
they do not present a falling object hazard. 

The Agency welcomes any comments 

with respect to this change. 
Paragraph 1404(p) Pile Driving 

This proposed provision would 

prohibit equipment used in pile driving 
operations from having a jib attached. 
The constant pounding of the pile 
driving hammer and the sometimes 
rapid descent of the pile causes the 
boom to bounce. If a jib were installed 
on the tip, as the boom bounces the jib 
could be thrown backward against its 
stops, which would likely cause 
structural damage to the boom. The 
damage could cause the boom to 
immediately fail or could diminish its 
capacity. 
Paragraph 1404(q) Outriggers 

This proposed paragraph specifies 

requirements regarding outrigger 
deployment. These requirements reflect 
current industry best practices in the 
use of outriggers. Failure to use 
outriggers in accordance with these 
practices could result in the overturning 
of the crane. 
Section 1926.1405 Disassembly— 
Additional Requirements for 
Disassembly of Booms and Jibs (Applies 
to Both the Use of Manufacturer 
Procedures and Employer Procedures) 

The Committee believed that many of 

the accidents associated with cranes 
occur during the removal of pendant, 
boom and jib pins. These accidents 
typically occur because of a failure to 
recognize that, in certain situations, 
particular pins are ‘‘in tension.’’ If 
removed while in that state the result 
will be unplanned movement of a 
component or the collapse of the boom 
or jib. 

Consequently, the Committee 

believed that the removal of pendant, 
boom section and jib pins warrants 
heightened attention. This proposed 
section focuses on protecting employees 
from these hazards during the 
dismantling of booms and jibs, either 
when disassembling the crane/derrick 
or when changing the length of a boom 
or jib. To make clear that ‘‘dismantling’’ 
includes activities such as shortening a 
boom, proposed § 1926.1401 defines 
‘‘dismantling’’ to include ‘‘partial 
dismantling (such as dismantling to 
shorten a boom or substitute a different 
component).’’ 

In this proposed section the 

Committee identified particular 
scenarios that, in the experience of 

many of the Committee members, pose 
specific hazards in disassembly if the 
wrong pins (that is, pins that are in 
tension) are partly or completely 
removed. The failure to follow the 
provisions would very likely result in 
unintended movement and or collapse 
of the components. OSHA believes that 
these requirements will help to prevent 
unintended movement or collapse of 
booms or jibs as they are being 
disassembled. 

While discussing the hazards 
associated with disassembly, the 
Committee reviewed particular 
illustrations from the ‘‘Mobile Crane 
Manual’’ by Construction Safety 
Association of Ontario. It was agreed 
that including these illustrations would 
be an effective way of communicating 
the dangers and the precautions 
specified in this proposed section. 
Section 1406 Assembly/Disassembly— 
Employer Procedures—General 
Requirements 

Under proposed § 1926.1403, 

employers would be permitted to follow 
their own procedures for assembling 
and disassembling a crane/derrick 
instead of those of the manufacturer. 
When doing so, the employer would 
have to ensure that its procedures met 
the general requirements in proposed 
§ 1926.1406. 

The proposed general requirements 

would focus on a ‘‘layered’’ strategy for 
preventing injuries and fatalities during 
this process: maintaining stability of the 
equipment and its components and 
positioning employees so that their 
exposure to unintended dangerous 
movement is minimized. This reflects 
the Committee members’ experience 
that maintaining stability and avoiding 
dangerous positions are the key 
elements to preventing these accidents. 

In addition, under proposed 

paragraph (b) of this section, the 
employer would be required to have its 
procedures developed by a qualified 
person. The Committee believed that, 
due to the complexity of the factors 
involved and the resultant expertise 
needed to develop such procedures, it 
would be necessary for them to be 
developed by a qualified person. 

Note that the Agency wording in 

proposed § 1926.1406(a)(1) includes a 
modification of the language in the C– 
DAC document. The C–DAC document 
stated: 

(1) Prevent unintended dangerous 

movement, and to prevent collapse, of part or 
all of the equipment. 

Read literally, this would mean that 

the employer could choose to design the 
procedures to prevent collapse either of 

part or of all of the equipment. The 
intent of the Committee was that the 
procedures must not allow unintended 
dangerous movement of any part of the 
equipment. Therefore, the Agency 
modified this language so that the 
proposed provision reads as follows: 

(1) Prevent unintended dangerous 

movement, and to prevent collapse, of all 
parts of the equipment. 
Sections 1407–1411 Power Lines 
Introduction 

Proposed §§ 1926.1407 through 

1926.1411 set out proposed 
requirements designed to help ensure 
the safety of employees while cranes/ 
derricks are being assembled, 
disassembled, operated, or while they 
travel under power lines. Section 1401 
defines ‘‘power lines’’ as ‘‘electric 
transmission and distribution lines.’’ 
This definition makes it clear that these 
sections apply to all electric 
transmission and distribution lines. C– 
DAC defined ‘‘power lines’’ as 
‘‘electrical distribution and electric 
transmission lines,’’ but OSHA changed 
the definition to make the terminology 
consistent with Subpart V of 29 CFR 
part 1926, which applies to the 
construction of ‘‘electric transmission 
and distribution lines and equipment.’’ 
29 CFR 1926.950(a). 

The Committee believed that there is 
a need to reduce the number of fatalities 
resulting from electrical contact with 
power lines. In its experience, the 
presence of power lines at construction 
sites poses a significant hazard to 
employees at the site. Power lines can 
be a hazard not only during the 
operation of cranes and derricks, such 
as lifting operations, but also during 
assembling and disassembling the 
equipment and traveling with such 
equipment under power lines. 
Employees are at risk of serious injury 
or death if the equipment they are in, on 
or near is at a construction site where 
there are power lines. 

The Committee’s perception of the 

significance of this problem is 
confirmed by data that indicate that 
electrocution is one of the leading 
causes of crane-related fatalities on 
construction sites. During the years 
1992 to 2005, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) reported 1,153 crane- 
related fatalities. These statistics 
include fatalities across all industries 
and are not exclusive to construction 
crane-related fatalities. Of those total 
crane-related fatalities the second 
highest cause is attributed to cranes 
contacting overhead power lines (19% 
or 219 fatalities). Specifically for the 
year 2005, BLS reported 85 crane-

In addition, a recent analysis of data 
published by the American Society of 
Civil Engineers (ASCE), authored by J.E. 
Beavers, J.R. Moore, R. Rinehart and 
W.R. Schriver, found that electric shock 
caused by cranes and other lifting 
equipment contacting a power source 
was the second highest proximate cause 
(after being struck by a load) of crane- 
related fatalities in the construction 
industry from 1997 to 2003. These 
fatalities all involved the failure to 
maintain the minimum approach 
distances set out in the existing Subpart 
N, § 1926.550 provisions.12 J.E. Beavers 
et al., ‘‘Crane-Related Fatalities in the 
Construction Industry,’’ 132 Journal of 
Construction Engineering and 
Management 901, 903–04 (2006) 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0012). 

The Construction Safety Association 

of Ontario conducted an extensive study 
which reviewed crane fatalities from 
1969 through 2002 in the Province of 
Ontario. (OSHA–2007–0066–0009). This 
study showed that the number one 
cause of mobile crane fatalities in the 
Province of Ontario construction 
industry during these 34 years was due 
to power line contact, with 50 of the 
115, or 43%, of the mobile crane 
fatalities caused by power line contact. 
A 1997 study by A. Suruda, M. Egger 

and D. Lui, analyzed crane related 
fatalities in the U.S. construction 
industry from 1984 to 1994. This study 
determined that electrocution by power 
line contact was the leading cause of 
crane related fatalities in the U.S. 
construction industry, with 39% of the 
502 fatalities caused by electrocution 
from power lines. In addition, the 
findings of this study further confirmed 
previous studies which indicated that 
power line contact contributes to a 
significant number of crane related 
fatalities.13 A. Suruda et al., ‘‘Crane- 
Related Deaths in the U.S. Construction 
Industry, 1984–94,’’ The Center to 
Protect Workers’ Rights (Oct. 1997) 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0013). 

Proposed § 1926.1401 defines 
‘‘electrical contact’’ as follows: 

When a person, object, or equipment 

makes contact or comes in close proximity 
with an energized conductor or equipment 
that allows the passage of current. 

12 The authors determined that a crane’s boom 

was generally the component which made contact 
with the power line. 

13 These studies include: D. MacCollum, ‘‘Critical 

Hazard Analysis and Crane Design,’’ Professional 
Safety (1980); D. Dickie, ‘‘Crane Study Confirms 
Downward Trend, Underlines Importance of 
Training,’’ The Crane Report (1993).

The Committee decided that it was 

necessary to define the term ‘‘electrical 
contact’’ to clarify that the term is not 
limited to a person, object, or equipment 
making physical contact with a power 
line but includes situations in which the 
object comes close enough to a power 
line for current to arc between the 
power line and the object and thereby 
energize the object. 

Currently Subpart N, in 29 CFR 

1926.550(a)(15)(i) and (ii), addresses 
power line hazards by specifying the 
minimum distance that must be 
maintained between a crane and an 
energized power line. For lines rated 50 
kilovolts (kV) or below, the minimum 
distance is 10 feet; for lines over 50 kV, 
the minimum distance is 10 feet plus 
0.4 inches for each 1 kV over 50 kV (we 
will refer to this Subpart N requirement 
in this preamble as the ‘‘10 foot rule’’). 
However, the existing Subpart N 
provisions, which instruct employers to 
maintain a minimum clearance 
distance, do little by way of requiring 
employers to implement measures to 
help prevent operators from 
inadvertently breaching that distance. 

The only preventative measure in 

Subpart N is a requirement, in 
paragraph 1926.550(a)(15)(iv), to use a 
spotter ‘‘where it is difficult for the 
operator to maintain the desired 
clearance by visual means.’’ In 
discussing how to reduce power line 
fatalities, the Committee determined 
that a systematic, proactive approach to 
preventing power line contact is 
needed. 

First, in the Committee’s experience, 
it is difficult for the operator, from his/ 
her position in the crane’s cab, to 
determine if the crane or load is 10 feet 
(or other applicable minimum distance) 
from a power line. According to C–DAC, 
generally operators know the 10 foot 
rule but they have problems being able 
to perceive or visually determine when 
the part of the equipment or load closest 
to the power line has reached the 10 
foot rule’s distance. The operator might 
think he/she is maintaining the required 
minimum distance when in fact the 
crane or load is closer than that to the 
line. Except for the limited requirement 
to use a spotter mentioned above, the 
existing Subpart N standard does not 
require any methodology or aids to be 
provided in each case to help the 
operator identify the location of this 
invisible boundary or otherwise avoid 
it. 

Second, the Committee believed that 

operators sometimes breach the 
minimum clearance distance when they 
forget about the presence of a power 
line. For example, an operator might 
conclude at the beginning of a shift that 

he/she can pick and set all necessary 
loads while maintaining the required 
minimum distance but may thereafter be 
called upon to pick or set a load closer 
to the power line than normal. Having 
once concluded that the power line 
presents no problem, the operator might 
not recognize that the situation has 
changed and that there is now a danger 
of breaching the minimum distance. 

Another scenario is when an operator 
concentrates so strongly on tasks related 
to moving the load, particularly if the 
load is one that requires the crane to be 
operated near its capacity, that he/she 
forgets about the power line. By not 
providing encroachment prevention 
measures, the current standard does not 
help the operator maintain the 10 foot 
rule and therefore does not address 
scenarios where operators forget about 
the presence of a power line. 

Further, the current standard’s 

provision for a spotter does not 
adequately address these scenarios. By 
requiring a spotter only ‘‘where it is 
difficult for the operator to maintain the 
desired clearance by visual means,’’ the 
provision implies that typically it is not 
difficult for the operator to accurately 
judge the distance and the equipment’s 
or load’s distance from the boundary. 
However, a crane operator, no matter 
how experienced, is normally not well- 
positioned to judge either the boundary 
distance or the distance the equipment 
or load is from it. In most cases the 
power line is thin, high up, and poorly 
contrasted against the sky. 

Adding to the operator’s difficulty is 

a confusion of angles posed by the 
power lines, load line, boom, and 
position of the operator away from the 
boundary. These factors are 
compounded by the distorting effects of 
distance on depth perception. Despite 
these factors, the operator must be able 
to accurately ascertain the location of an 
invisible boundary and judge relatively 
small distances with a high degree of 
precision. 

Even a small misjudgment can result 

in the minimum clearance distance 
being breached. In short, the current 
standard assumes a degree of visual 
acuity that experience has shown is 
unrealistic. The high number of 
fatalities that continue to result from 
electrocution by power lines 
demonstrates that the current, limited 
provision regarding a spotter is not 
effective. 

Third, the Committee discussed the 

reality that many employers 
intentionally perform work closer than 
the 10 foot rule to energized power 
lines. In only two circumstances does 
the current standard allow the operation 
of cranes closer than the 10 foot rule.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

The first instance is where the power 
lines have been deenergized and visibly 
grounded and the second is where 
insulating barriers (separate from the 
equipment) have been erected to 
prevent physical contact. 

Committee members noted that 

typically neither of these measures is 
implemented. Specifically, the 
Committee believed that most 
employers elect not to use the option to 
deenergize and ground because of the 
time, expense and difficulty in making 
those arrangements. In addition, the 
Committee determined that an 
‘‘insulating barrier’’ of the type that is 
currently available does not, by itself, 
adequately protect employees because 
these barriers are only effective for 
‘‘brush’’ contact. If there is more than 
brush contact, they will not protect 
employees from electrocution because 
the equipment will pierce the device. In 
order to address the lack of compliance 
and the insufficient protections 
provided to employees who work closer 
than the 10 foot rule, the Committee 
developed new provisions that it 
believed would be both realistic and 
effective for safely working in such 
circumstances. 

To summarize, the Committee found 
that the existing Subpart N provisions 
are inadequate. They fail to require 
employers to implement measures that 
would help prevent operators from 
inadvertently breaching the minimum 
clearance distance. The Committee 
determined that a systematic, proactive 
approach to preventing power line 
contact is needed. It recognized that 
while such an approach is necessarily 
more complex than the current 10 foot 
rule, it is essential to accomplishing the 
goal of reducing power line related 
fatalities and injuries. 
Brief Overview of Proposed 
Requirements 

The proposed standard would require 

the implementation of a systematic, 
proactive approach to dealing with the 
hazard of power lines. This approach 
would be comprised of the following 
steps: (1) Identify the work zone and 
assess it for power lines—determine 
how close the crane could get to them. 
The employer would have the option of 
doing this assessment for the area 360 
degrees around the crane or for a more 
limited, demarcated area; (2) If the 
assessment showed that the crane could 
get closer than a trigger distance—20 
feet for lines rated up to 350 kV (50 feet 
for lines rated over 350 kV)—then 
requirements for additional action 
would be triggered. 

Specifically, unless the power lines 

were deenergized and grounded,

encroachment/electrocution prevention 
measures would have to be 
implemented to prevent the crane from 
breaching a minimum clearance 
distance and protect against 
electrocution. The employer would be 
allowed to choose among several 
minimum clearance distance options. 
For example, for lines up to 350kV, 

the minimum clearance distance 
options would be: (1) 20 feet; or (2) the 
distance specified in Table A for the 
line’s voltage (Table A is the ‘‘10 foot 
rule’’; see discussion of Table A below); 
or (3) a distance closer than what is 
specified in Table A. 

However, there are limitations to the 

availability of some of these options, 
and the number of mandatory 
encroachment prevention (and other) 
measures increases when using a 
clearance distance closer than Table A. 
The proposed standard uses the word 
‘‘encroachment’’ to describe a situation 
in which equipment gets closer than the 
minimum allowed clearance distance to 
a power line. Under § 1926.1401, 
Definitions, encroachment ‘‘is where 
any part of the crane, load line or load 
(including rigging and lifting 
accessories) breaches a minimum 
clearance distance that this Subpart 
requires to be maintained from a power 
line.’’ Encroachment prevention 
measures are critical to compliance with 
this proposed standard’s minimum 
distance requirements. 

A similar approach to power line 
safety was developed for preventing 
electrocutions during the assembly and 
disassembly of equipment. This is 
addressed in a separate proposed 
section because the assembly/ 
disassembly process involves some 
different circumstances than are present 
during operation. 
Section 1407 Power Line Safety (Up to 
350 kV)—Assembly and Disassembly 

The proposed requirements in 

§ 1926.1407 address the hazards of 
assembling and disassembling 
equipment near power lines up to 350 
kV. The requirements in proposed 1407 
are similar in most respects to the 
requirements in proposed § 1926.1408, 
which address operations of equipment 
near power lines. 

OSHA notes that when an assist crane 

is used during the assembly or 
disassembly of another crane/derrick, 
the use of the assist crane, with respect 
to power line safety, would be 
considered ‘‘operations’’ and therefore 
covered by proposed § 1926.1408 (or, for 
power lines over 350 kV, proposed 
§ 1926.1409). This is because the assist 
crane has already been assembled and is 
being used for a crane operation. 

Therefore, use of the assist crane would 
be required to comply with proposed 
§ 1926.1408 during the assembly/ 
disassembly process rather than with 
proposed § 1926.1407. 

In contrast, a crane that is not yet 

fully assembled is often used to 
complete its own assembly. For 
example, a crane is often used to load 
its own counterweights. Similarly, it 
may unload its counterweights in its 
own disassembly process. Such 
activities would be covered under 
proposed § 1926.1407 since it is being 
assembled/disassembled. 
Paragraph 1407(a) 

Under this proposed paragraph, 

before beginning assembly or 
disassembly, the employer would be 
required to determine if any part of the 
crane, load or load line (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) could 
get, in the direction or area of assembly, 
closer than 20 feet to a power line. In 
other words, the employer would use 
the direction or area of assembly or 
disassembly in evaluating whether any 
such part could come closer than 20 
feet. If this 20 foot ‘‘trigger’’ 
determination is positive, then the 
employer would be required to take 
additional steps. Specifically, the 
employer would be required to meet the 
proposed requirements under either, 
Option (1), Option (2) or Option (3) of 
§ 1926.1407(a). If any part of the crane, 
load or load line could not come within 
more than 20 feet of a power line the 
employer would not be required to take 
any further action under this proposed 
section. 

Upon further review of C–DAC’s 

§ 1926.1407(a), OSHA realized there 
was an inadvertent omission. The C– 
DAC regulatory text read: 

(a) Before assembling or disassembling a 
crane, the employer must determine if any 
part of the crane, load, or load line (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) could get, in 
the direction or area of ‘‘assembly,’’ within 
20 feet of a power line during the assembly/ 
disassembly process. 

These provisions were intended to 

apply to both assembly and 
disassembly. The employer needs to 
evaluate power lines with respect to the 
direction or area of assembly when 
preparing to assemble the crane, and the 
direction or area of disassembly when 
preparing to disassemble the crane. A 
reference to ‘‘disassembly’’ in this 
regard was inadvertently omitted. 
Therefore, OSHA has changed the 
regulatory text to read: 

(a) Before assembling or disassembling a 
crane, the employer must determine if any 
part of the crane, load, or load line (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) could get, in

the direction or area of ‘‘assembly/ 
disassembly,’’ closer than 20 feet to a power 
line during the assembly/disassembly 
process.14 

The phrase ‘‘direction or area of 

assembly/disassembly’’ is designed to 
address the fact that, in some cases, the 
assembly or disassembly of a crane takes 
place not just in an ‘‘area,’’ that is, a 
fixed portion of the work site, but also 
in a ‘‘direction.’’ For example, when 
disassembling a crane, the disassembly 
process takes place in an area that 
includes the area under and around the 
boom’s path as it is lowered to the 
ground (in most, but not all cases, the 
boom is lowered to the ground for the 
disassembly process). Under this 
provision, the employer would be 
required to assess the promixity that the 
boom will be in to the power line in its 
path of travel to (and on) the ground. 

In another example, when assembling 

a lattice boom crane, the ‘‘area’’ 
involved will expand as boom sections 
are added.15 This area expands in the 
‘‘direction’’ in which the boom sections 
are added. The power line assessment 
has to be made for the portion of the site 
that will be involved as these boom 
sections are added. 

In addition, ‘‘direction’’ includes the 

direction that, for example, the boom 
will move as it rises into the air after the 
boom has been assembled on the 
ground. For example, the boom, when 
fully assembled on the ground, may be 
more than 20 feet from a power line. 
However, when raising it from the 
ground, it may get closer than 20 feet. 
Accordingly, under this language, the 
‘‘direction’’ that the boom will travel as 
it is raised must also be evaluated for 
proximity to power lines. 

Another example is the assembly of a 

tower crane. As tower sections are 
added, the assembly process may get 
closer to power lines than when the 
process began on the ground. That 
‘‘direction’’ of assembly upwards must 
also be evaluated. 
Paragraph (a)(1) Option (1) 

An employer choosing Option 1 

would protect against electrocution by 
having the power lines deenergized and 
visibly grounded. Where the employer 
elects this option, it would not have to 
implement any of the encroachment/ 
electrocution prevention measures 

14 As explained below, OSHA is changing ‘‘within 

20 feet of a power line’’ wherever it appears in the 
C–DAC document to ‘‘closer than 20 feet to a power 
line’’ to avoid potential confusion over whether 
‘‘within’’ means breaching or not breaching the 20 
foot distance. 

15 This also occurs with telescopic extensible 

boom cranes when a ‘‘dead man section’’ is added 
to the boom.

listed in proposed § 1926.1407(b). This 
option helps to eliminate the electrical 
hazards which are present with power 
lines. 

However, some amount of time is 

needed to arrange for the utility owner/ 
operator 16 to deenergize and ground the 
line. Also, in some instances, especially 
where the construction project is small, 
the cost of deenergizing and grounding 
may be a substantial portion of the cost 
of the project. The Committee 
recognized that, in practice, largely 
because of these factors, deenergizing 
and grounding has not been routinely 
done. 

Therefore, the Committee believed 

that providing other safe and practical 
options would help to reduce unsafe 
practices in the industry. Those other 
options (Options 2 and 3 in proposed 
§ 1926.1407(a)) combined with 
proposed § 1926.1407(b) are designed to 
be effective protection against the 
hazards of electrocution. 
Paragraph (a)(2) Option (2) 
Under Option 2 (proposed 

§ 1926.1407(a)(2)), the employer would 
be required to maintain a minimum 
clearance distance of 20 feet. To help 
ensure that this distance is not 
breached, the employer would have to 
implement the encroachment 
prevention measures in proposed 
§ 1926.1407(b). Under this proposed 
option, no part of the crane, load or load 
line, including rigging and lifting 
accessories, would be permitted closer 
than 20 feet to the power line. 

Employers using this proposed option 

would, in most cases, have to stay 
further away from the power line than 
under the existing Subpart N’s 10 foot 
rule (employers wanting to use the 10 
foot rule would have to use proposed 
Option 3, discussed below).17 However, 
an advantage of this proposed option to 
many employers is that they would not 
have to determine the exact voltage of 
the power line as they would if they 
were to apply Subpart N’s 10 foot rule. 
They would only have to determine that 
the line voltage is equal to or less than 

16 OSHA notes that the phrase ‘‘utility owner/ 

operator’’ reflects scenarios where utilities may not 
be operated by an owner but by some entity other 
than the owner. Therefore wherever the phrase 
‘‘utility owner/operator’’ is used in the standard or 
in the preamble it is meant to apply to utility 
owners or utility operators. In addition, in various 
places in the original C–DAC document, the 
Committee had used the terms ‘‘power line owner,’’ 
‘‘power line owner/operator’’ or a variation of those 
terms. The Agency has changed those terms to 
‘‘utility owner/operator’’ or a variation of those 
terms. The Agency has changed those terms to 
‘‘utility owner/operator’’ to be consistent 
throughout the proposed regulatory text. 

17 As discussed above, the 10 foot rule is a scale 

of voltages and distances that begins at 10 feet. 

350 kV. As a practical matter, since 
many employers rely on the utility 
owner/operator to provide voltage 
information, this option would save 
them that step. 

The Committee believed that, since 

the minimum clearance distance would 
be 20 feet, there would be no 
diminution of safety under this option 
since the maximum possible clearance 
distance under the current Subpart N’s 
formula is 20 feet. In fact, in the 
Committee’s experience, most power 
lines encountered by most employers 
have voltages that, under the current 
Subpart N formula, require a minimum 
clearance distance of 10 feet. Therefore, 
use of this option would, in most cases, 
result in a higher margin of safety. 
Employers who do not need to get closer 
than 20 feet in order to assemble/ 
disassemble the crane could use this 
option and would be saved the step of 
obtaining the exact line voltage. 
As noted above, in addition to 

maintaining a minimum clearance 
distance of 20 feet, employers using this 
option would be required to implement 
the encroachment prevention and other 
measures specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1407(b). 
Paragraph (a)(3) Option (3) 

Under Option 3 (proposed paragraph 
§ 1926.1407(a)(3)), the employer would 
be required to maintain a minimum 
clearance distance in accordance with 
Table A (of proposed § 1926.1408). 
Under Table A, depending on the 
voltage of the power line, the minimum 
approach distance ranges from 10 feet to 
20 feet for lines up to 350 kV. Therefore, 
the minimum clearance distance would 
be essentially the same under Option 3 
as under Subpart N’s 10 foot rule. Under 
this option the employer would be 
required to determine the line’s voltage. 

As a practical matter, in the 

Committee’s experience, the power lines 
most typically encountered by most 
employers would require a minimum 
clearance distance of 10 feet under 
Table A. As a result, employers could 
usually assemble/disassemble 
equipment closer to the lines under this 
option than under Option 2. 

Table A in essence is based upon the 

same formula as is currently used in 
existing Subpart N (the 10 foot rule) and 
is similar to Table 1 in ASME B30.5– 
2004. Unlike Subpart N, which requires 
employers to calculate the minimum 
clearance distance from a formula, Table 
A sets forth specified clearance 
distances in a readily understood table 
and requires no calculations. The 
Committee believed that a table with 
specified clearance distances is more

readily applied than the formula set out 
in the existing Subpart N requirements. 
The enhanced safety that would result 

under this option would stem from the 
fact that, first, there would be an 
affirmative obligation on the employer 
to determine the power line voltage so 
that the correct Table A minimum 
clearance distance could be determined. 
Second, in addition to maintaining the 
minimum clearance distance specified 
in the Table, employers using this 
option would be required to implement 
the encroachment prevention and other 
measures specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1407(b). 

In reviewing C–DAC’s draft of this 

provision, the Agency realized that C– 
DAC inadvertently failed to explicitly 
state that the Table A minimum 
clearance distance must not be 
breached. OSHA has modified proposed 
paragraph § 1926.1407(a)(3)(ii) to correct 
this error. Therefore, the last sentence of 
the C–DAC language has been expanded 
to read as follows: 

If so, then the employer must follow the 

requirements in paragraph (b) to ensure that 
no part of the crane, load line, or load 
(including rigging and lifting accessories), 
gets closer to the line than the minimum 
clearance distance. 
Paragraph 1407(b) Preventing 
Encroachment/Electrocution 

Once an employer has determined 

that some part of the crane, load or load 
line could come within the trigger 
distance of 20 feet of a power line (see 
§ 1926.1407(a)), if it chooses either 
Option (2) or (3) of § 1926.1407(a) it 
would be required to implement 
encroachment prevention measures to 
help ensure that the applicable 
minimum clearance distance (20 feet 
under Option 2 or the Table A distance 
under Option 3) is not breached.18 

Most of the measures in this proposed 

paragraph are designed to help the 
employer maintain the appropriate 
clearance distance and thereby prevent 
electrical contact while in the process of 
assembling or disassembling equipment. 
Some of the measures are designed to 
prevent electrocution in the event of 
electrical contact. The committee 
believed these proposed requirements 
would add layers of protection to help 
keep employees safe from power lines 
during the assembly or disassembly of 
the equipment. 
Paragraph 1407(b)(1) 

Under proposed paragraph (b)(1), the 
employer would be required to conduct 

18 Alternatively, under Option (1), the employer 
could have the lines deenergized and grounded. If 
Option (1) were selected, no further action under 
this section would be required.

a planning meeting with the Assembly/ 
Disassembly Supervisor (A/D 
Supervisor), operator, assembly/ 
disassembly crew and other workers 
who will be in the assembly/ 
disassembly area (including the area of 
the load). This planning meeting must 
include reviewing the location of the 
power line(s) and the steps that will be 
implemented to prevent encroachment 
and electrocution. 

As discussed below, under this 

proposed paragraph, certain 
encroachment/electrocution prevention 
measures would be required (they are 
listed in proposed paragraph (b)(1) and 
(2) of this section). In addition, the 
employer would be required to select at 
least one additional measure from the 
list in proposed § 1926.1407(b)(3). In the 
planning meeting, the employer would 
be required to make that selection and 
review all the measures that will be 
used to comply with this section. 

The purpose of this proposed 
requirement is to ensure that the 
operator and other workers who will be 
in the area understand these measures 
and how they will be implemented. 
That understanding is important to their 
successful implementation. Because of 
the critical nature of these measures, 
and the seriousness of the consequences 
to the safety of the employees if they are 
not implemented correctly, the 
Committee believed that it is necessary 
for there to be a structured process by 
which the employer communicates this 
information. 
Paragraph 1407(b)(2) 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would 
require that where tag lines are used 
they must be non-conductive. This 
provision uses two terms that are 
defined in § 1401. ‘‘Tag lines’’ is defined 
as ‘‘a rope (usually fiber) attached to a 
lifted load for purposes of controlling 
load spinning and pendular motions or 
used to stabilize a bucket or magnet 
during material handling operations.’’ 
Thus, one end of a tag line is attached 
to the load and the other end is held by 
an employee who controls the load’s 
motion by exerting force on the line. 

If the equipment or load were to make 

electrical contact with a power line 
while an employee was holding a tag 
line that was able to conduct electricity, 
the employee could be electrocuted. The 
requirement that the tag line be non- 
conductive is designed to protect 
against such an event. Section 
1926.1401 defines ‘‘non-conductive’’ as 
meaning that, ‘‘because of the nature 
and conditions of the materials used, 
and the conditions of use (including 
environmental conditions and condition 
of the material), the object in question 

has the property of not becoming 
energized (that is, it has high dielectric 
properties offering a high resistance to 
the passage of current under the 
conditions of use).’’ 

This definition recognizes that it is 

not only the inherent property of the tag 
line material that results in it being non- 
conductive but also the conditions of 
use. For example, if an otherwise non- 
conductive material were to become wet 
and therefore able to conduct electricity, 
it would no longer qualify as non- 
conductive under this proposed 
paragraph. 
Paragraph 1407(b)(3) 

Under this proposed paragraph the 

employer would be required to choose 
one of five encroachment prevention 
measures (§ 1926.1407(b)(3)(i) through 
(v)) to implement. The Committee 
concluded that the use of any one of 
these measures, in combination with the 
required measures listed elsewhere in 
proposed § 1926.1407(b), would be 
feasible and effective in protecting 
against encroachment. Specifically, the 
employer would be required to choose 
either: (i) The use of a dedicated spotter; 
(ii) a proximity alarm; (iii) a device that 
automatically warns the operator when 
to stop (i.e., a range control warning 
device); (iv) a device that automatically 
limits the range of movement of the 
equipment; or (v) an elevated: Warning 
line, barricade, or line of signs, in view 
of the operator, equipped with flags or 
similar high-visibility markings. 
Providing the ability to choose among 
these options would give the employer 
flexibility so that it could pick one that 
was well suited and efficient in the 
circumstances. 

A definition of ‘‘dedicated spotter 

(power lines)’’ is included in proposed 
§ 1926.1401, Definitions. That definition 
provides: 

In order to be considered a dedicated 
spotter, the requirements of § 1926.1428 
(signal person qualifications) must be met 
and his/her sole responsibility is to watch the 
separation between the power line and: the 
equipment, load line and load (including 
rigging and lifting accessories), and ensure 
through communication with the operator 
that the applicable minimum distance is not 
breached. 

When the employer uses a dedicated 
spotter to prevent encroachment under 
this section, that person has the critical 
responsibility of ensuring, through 
communication with the operator, that 
the equipment maintains a specified 
minimum clearance distance from a 
power line. This definition makes clear 
that the dedicated spotter cannot have 
any other responsibilities that detract 
him/her from this task. Also, the

dedicated spotter must have the 
qualifications required of a signal 
person under proposed § 1926.1428, 
discussed below. Those qualifications 
will ensure that the signal person can 
communicate effectively with the 
operator. They also ensure that the 
signal person is knowledgeable about 
crane dynamics and therefore is able to 
recognize situations in which the 
minimum clearance distance may 
inadvertently be breached if, for 
example, the load is stopped quickly 
while it is being moved near a power 
line. 

The devices listed in proposed 

§§ 1926.1407(b)(3)(ii) and (iii) are also 
defined in § 1401. ‘‘Proximity alarm,’’ is 
defined as ‘‘a device that provides a 
warning of proximity to a power line 
that has been listed, labeled, or accepted 
by a Nationally Recognized Testing 
Laboratory in accordance with 29 CFR 
1910.7.’’ 19 A Nationally Recognized 
Testing Laboratory is an organization 
that has been recognized by OSHA 
pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.7 as competent 
to evaluate equipment for conformance 
to appropriate safety test standards for 
that type of equipment. Thus, approval 
of a proximity alarm by a nationally 
recognized testing laboratory provides 
assurance that the device will work as 
intended. ‘‘Range control warning 
device,’’ is defined as ‘‘a device that can 
be set by an equipment operator to warn 
that the boom or jib tip is at a plane or 
multiple planes.’’ 

In reviewing this proposed provision, 
OSHA realized that some of the devices 
listed in proposed § 1926.1407(b)(3) 
would not be operational or effective 
against electrocution during certain 
phases of the assembly or disassembly 
process of certain types of cranes. For 
example, for lattice boom cranes, 
proximity alarm devices may not be able 
to be used when the boom is not yet 
fully assembled; at that point the 
proximity alarm typically cannot be 
connected and functioning. Therefore, 
during certain phases of assembly/ 
disassembly, one of the other options 
would need to be used (such as a 
dedicated spotter) in order to provide 
the needed protection. 

However, the regulatory text, as 
currently drafted, would permit an 
employer to select an option 

19 The C–DAC version of this provision defined 

proximity alarm as: ‘‘a device that provides a 
warning of proximity to a power line that has been 
approved by a Nationally Recognized Testing 
Laboratory.’’ OSHA has modified the provision to 
conform its language to that used in 29 CFR 1910.7, 
the OSHA rule governing nationally recognized 
testing laboratories, and to explicitly refer to 
§ 1910.7 to make clear that the listing, labeling, or 
acceptance of a device under this rule must be in 
accord with § 1910.7.

irrespective of whether it would be 
effective under the circumstances. In 
order to address this concern, OSHA 
requests public comment on whether 
proposed § 1926.1407(b)(3) should be 
revised to preclude the employer from 
selecting an option that, in the 
employer’s situation, would be 
ineffective, such as by revising the 
provision to read: 

(3) At least one of the additional measures 
listed in this paragraph must be in place. The 
measure selected from this list must be 
effective in preventing encroachment. The 
additional measures are: * * * 

In situations where an employer 

chooses the option of using a dedicated 
spotter, the employer would be required 
to meet the proposed requirements for 
spotters in proposed 
§ 1926.1407(b)(3)(i). As specified in 
proposed paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, the spotter would have to be 
equipped with a visual aid to assist in 
identifying the minimum clearance 
distance. The Committee concluded that 
a visual aid is needed for the spotter 
because of the difficulty in visualizing 
the minimum clearance distance 
boundary in the air (as discussed 
above). 

In the C–DAC version of this 

paragraph, examples of visual aids 
included a line painted on the ground, 
a clearly visible line of stanchions or a 
set of line-of-sight landmarks. An 
example of a clearly visible set of line- 
of-sight landmarks would be a fence 
post and a building corner. 

In reviewing C–DAC’s draft of this 
provision, the Agency noted that the 
stanchions and landmarks would have 
to be ‘‘clearly visible,’’ but that this 
language was not used with respect to 
the example of a painted line on the 
ground. Since all such visual aids 
would have to be clearly visible to be 
effective, and that was the evident 
intent of C–DAC, the Agency has 
modified the C–DAC language so that, 
in the proposed provision, all the listed 
examples would have to be ‘‘clearly 
visible.’’ This revision was also made in 
proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4)(ii)(A). 

Under proposed paragraphs 

(b)(3)(i)(B)–(D), the spotter would have 
to be positioned so that he/she can 
effectively gauge the clearance distance 
from the power line; the spotter, where 
necessary, would have to use equipment 
that enables him/her to communicate 
directly with the equipment operator; 
and the spotter would have to give 
timely information to the operator so 
that the required clearance distance can 
be maintained. C–DAC believed that 
each criterion is needed for the spotter 
to be able to be effective. 

Paragraph 1407(c) Assembly/ 
Disassembly Below Power Lines 
Prohibited 

This proposed paragraph would 

preclude employers from assembling or 
disassembling cranes/derricks beneath 
energized power lines. The Committee 
agreed that assembly/disassembly below 
energized power lines presents an 
extreme risk and needs to be prohibited. 
The assembly/disassembly process 
necessarily involves moving and 
hoisting parts of the equipment into 
place. If some of this work took place 
beneath a power line, the risk that a 
part, load, load line, or other equipment 
would make electrical contact is very 
high. Also, in both assembly and 
disassembly, maneuvering an assembled 
crane out from under the power lines, 
or maneuvering a crane that is about to 
be disassembled under them, itself 
poses a high risk of such contact. 

C–DAC’s agreement on this provision 
indicates a belief by the Committee that, 
in almost all cases, the employer can 
plan the assembly/disassembly so that 
there will be no need to be beneath 
power lines. The Committee also 
concluded that, in the very few 
instances where this is not possible, in 
light of the extreme risk involved, it is 
essential that the lines be deenergized 
and visibly grounded. 
Paragraph 1407(d) Assembly/ 
Disassembly Closer Than Table A 
Clearance Prohibited 

Assembly and disassembly of cranes/ 

derricks closer than the minimum 
clearance distance in proposed Table A 
(of proposed § 1926.1408) to an 
energized power line would be 
prohibited. If assembly or disassembly 
needed to take place closer than that 
distance, the employer would be 
required to have the line deenergized 
and visibly grounded. The rationale for 
this proposed provision is similar to 
that discussed above for assembly/ 
disassembly beneath power lines. 
Engaging in assembly/disassembly 
activity closer to an energized power 
line than the Table A distance was 
considered by the Committee to be too 
hazardous to be permitted under any 
circumstances. 

This reflects certain inherent 
characteristics of the assembly/ 
disassembly process that preclude the 
employer from being able to reliably 
maintain clearance distances closer than 
Table A (of proposed § 1926.1408). For 
example, when disassembling a lattice 
boom, pins that hold boom sections 
together are removed. Even when done 
properly, this can release stored kinetic 
energy and cause the boom section

being removed, as well as the remaining 
sections, to move. It is too difficult to 
estimate the amount of such potential 
movement with the precision that 
would be necessary when working 
closer than the Table A distances. 

Another example is when assembling 
a boom, an error in the assembly process 
may similarly cause unanticipated 
movement. Using clearances closer than 
those in Table A would not allow 
sufficient room in light of the difficulty 
of predicting the amount such 
movement.20 
Paragraph 1407(e) Voltage Information 

This proposed section operates in 

conjunction with proposed 
§ 1926.1407(a)(3). Under proposed 
§ 1926.1407(a)(3), employers who elect 
to use Option (3) of § 1926.1407(b) must 
determine the line’s voltage. Under 
proposed § 1926.1407(e), where the 
employer asks the utility owner/ 
operator for that voltage information, 
the utility owner/operator of the line 
would be required to provide the 
voltage information within two working 
days of the request. 

This reflects a belief of the Committee 

that, in the absence of such a time 
limitation on the utility owner/operator, 
in many instances Option (3) (proposed 
§ 1926.1407(b)) would not be useful 
because the employer would not be able 
to get the voltage information in 
sufficient time to be able to use it. Many 
employers would rely on the utility 
owner/operator to get this information. 
The Committee was concerned that an 
extended delay in getting it would result 
in employers, to some extent, doing the 
work anyway without the information. 
Therefore, for Option (3) (proposed 
§ 1926.1407(b)) to be viable, the 
Committee believed that a reasonable 
time limitation for the utility owner/ 
operator to respond is needed.21 

The Committee believed that two 
business days would be a reasonable 
amount of time to allow the utility 
owners/operator to respond and be 
sufficiently short to be useful to the 
employer requesting the information. 

In reviewing this provision, the 

Agency noted that the C–DAC provision 
reads: 

20 In this respect this proposed provision differs 

from proposed § 1926.1408. As discussed below, 
§ 1926.1408 would allow use of minimum clearance 
distances closer than Table A in some 
circumstances for crane ‘‘operations.’’ In contrast, 
proposed § 1926.1407(d) reflects a determination by 
the Committee that there are no circumstances for 
‘‘assembly/disassembly’’ when it would be safe for 
any part of the crane, load or load line (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) to get closer than the 
Table A minimum clearance distance. 

21 As noted in the introduction, C–DAC included 

two members from the electric utility industry.

Voltage information. Where Option (3) is 
used, owner/operators of power lines must 
provide the requested voltage information 
within two working days of the employer’s 
request. 

In a different context—determining 
the timeliness of notices of contest to 
OSHA citations—OSHA defines 
‘‘working days’’ to mean ‘‘Mondays 
through Fridays but shall not include 
Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal 
holidays.’’ 29 CFR 1903.22(c). Since the 
term is already defined in an OSHA 
regulation, the Agency would apply the 
same definition here unless this rule 
were to specify a different definition. 
Therefore, OSHA solicits comments on 
whether the phrase ‘‘working days’’ 
should be defined differently for 
purposes of this rule than it is in 29 CFR 
1903.22(c). 
Paragraph 1407(f) Power Lines 
Presumed Energized 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that employers always assume 
that all power lines are energized unless 
the utility owner/operator confirms that 
the power line has been and continues 
to be deenergized and visibly grounded 
at the worksite. This fundamental 
precaution is essentially the same as 
currently in Subpart N at 
§ 1926.550(a)(15)(vi). 
Paragraph 1407(g) Posting of 
Electrocution Warnings 

This proposed paragraph would 
require the posting of electrocution 
warnings as follows: One inside the cab 
in view of the operator and (except for 
overhead gantry and tower cranes) at 
least two on the outside of the 
equipment. The Committee believes that 
these electrocution warnings are 
necessary to protect the operator as well 
as any employees working in the area 
around the crane by increasing their 
awareness of the hazard. This provision 
is similar to section 5–3.4.5.2(d) of 
ASME B30.5–2004. 
Section 1408 Power Line Safety (Up to 
350 kV)—Operations 

As discussed above with respect to 

power line safety in assembly/ 
disassembly, the proposed standard 
would require the implementation of a 
systematic approach to power line 
safety for crane/derrick operations. This 
approach would consist of two basic 
steps. First, the employer would need to 
identify the work zone, assess it for 
power lines, and determine how close 
the crane could get to them. The 
employer would have the option of 
doing this assessment for the area 360 
degrees around the crane or for a more 
limited, demarcated area. Second, if the 

assessment showed that the crane could 
get closer than a trigger distance—20 
feet for lines rated up to 350 kV (50 feet 
for lines rated over 350 kV)—then 
requirements for additional action 
would be triggered. 

Specifically, unless the power lines 

were deenergized and grounded, 
encroachment prevention measures 
would have to be implemented to 
prevent the crane from breaching a 
minimum clearance distance. The 
employer would be allowed to choose 
among three minimum clearance 
distance options. For example, for lines 
up to 350kV, the minimum clearance 
distance options would be 20 feet, or the 
distance specified in Table A (of 
proposed § 1926.1408) for the line’s 
voltage (Table A is the ‘‘10 foot rule’’; 
see discussion of Table A below), or a 
distance closer than what is specified in 
Table A. 

However, there are limitations to the 

availability of some of these options, 
and the number of mandatory 
encroachment prevention (and other) 
measures increases when using a 
clearance distance closer than Table 
A.22 
Paragraph 1408(a) Hazard Assessments 
and Precautions Inside the Work Zone 

Before beginning crane/derrick 

operations, the employer would be 
required to determine if power lines 
would pose a hazard. The first step in 
this process would be to identify the 
work zone for which this hazard 
assessment will be made (proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(1)). The employer would 
have two options for defining the work 
zone. 

Under the first option (proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(1)(i)), the employer 
would be required to define the work 
zone by marking boundaries and 
prohibiting the operator from operating 
the equipment past those boundaries. 
Examples of how to demarcate the 
boundaries include using flags or 
devices such as a range limit device or 
range control warning device. ‘‘Range 
control warning device’’ is defined in 
§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘a device that can be set 
by an equipment operator to warn that 
the boom or jib tip is at a plane or 
multiple planes.’’ See the explanation 

22 An employer engaged in subpart V (of 29 CFR 

part 1926) work (power transmission and 
distribution) would also have to comply with most 
of these provisions. However, when certain 
prerequisites are met, it would be permitted to use 
the minimum clearance distances in Subpart V’s 
Table V–1. In addition, where additional 
prerequisites are met, it would be permitted to work 
closer than the Table V–1 distances. These are 
explained in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1410.

below of ‘‘range limit device’’ at the end 
of the discussion of this section. 

Employers would not be permitted to 

use existing landmarks to demarcate 
boundaries unless they are marked. For 
example, a line of trees would be 
insufficient. Without anything more the 
trees would not signal a reminder to the 
operator of there being a boundary that 
must be maintained. However, adding 
flags to those trees would be sufficient 
because the flags would serve as a 
reminder that the trees are located along 
a boundary that the operator must not 
breach. 

The boundaries must mark the limits 
of all crane movement. For example, a 
work zone could be defined by 
demarcating boundaries: (1) To the left 
and right of the operator, to limit the 
lateral movement of the boom, and (2) 
in front of the operator, in a line 
connecting the side boundaries, limiting 
the boom’s radius. 

In identifying the work zone, the 

employer must consider the entire area 
in which the crane will need to operate. 
If the crane will need to be positioned 
in more than one spot to accomplish its 
work, or to travel with a load, the 
employer would be required to consider 
the total area in which it will need to 
operate and set the boundaries 
accordingly. 

The second option for identifying the 

work zone (proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(1)(ii)) would be to define 
the work zone as the area 360 degrees 
around the crane, up to the crane’s 
maximum working radius. In other 
words, under this option, the work zone 
would be the area within a circle, with 
the crane at the center, and the radius 
defined by the maximum working 
radius of the crane. No boundaries 
would have to be marked under this 
option since the crane would be 
permitted to operate in the entire area 
that it could reach. 
Paragraph 1408(a)(2) 

Once the employer has identified the 

work zone according to proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(1), it would then be 
required to make the power line hazard 
assessment. Specifically, it must 
determine if any part of the crane, load 
or load line (including rigging and 
lifting accessories) could come within a 
‘‘trigger’’ distance—20 feet of a power 
line. This determination must be made 
based upon the assumption that the 
crane would be operated up to its 
maximum working radius (or, if a 
demarcated boundary is closer than the 
maximum working radius, the 
assessment must be made with the 
assumption that the crane would be 
operated up to that boundary).

Even if the employer has no intention 
of working up to the crane’s maximum 
radius in the work zone, the assessment 
must still be made using this 
assumption. The Committee believed 
that this is crucial since, even if the 
employer’s original intention was not to 
operate in that part of the work zone, 
unexpected events may occur that may 
lead the operator to operate the 
equipment there. 

If this 20 foot ‘‘trigger’’ determination 
is positive, then the employer would be 
required to take additional steps. 
Specifically, the employer would be 
required to meet the proposed 
requirements under either, Option (1), 
Option (2), or Option (3) of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2).23 
Paragraph 1408(a)(2)(i) Option (1) 
An employer choosing Option (1) 

would protect against electrocution by 
having the power lines deenergized and 
visibly grounded at the worksite. This 
option would prevent equipment that 
contacts the power line from becoming 
energized. The power line must be 
‘‘visibly grounded at the worksite’’ so 
that the employer can verify, through 
observation, that the protection 
provided by this option remains in 
place for as long as the employer 
continues to rely on it. 

Where the employer elects this 

option, it would not have to implement 
any of the encroachment/electrocution 
prevention measures listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b). However, some amount 
of time is needed to arrange for the 
utility owner/operator to deenergize and 
ground the line. Also, in some 
instances, especially where the 
construction project is small, the cost of 
deenergizing and grounding may be a 
substantial portion of the cost of the 
project. The Committee recognized that, 
in practice, largely because of these 
factors, deenergizing and grounding has 
not been routinely done. 

Therefore, the committee believed 

that providing other safe and practical 
options would help to reduce unsafe 
practices in the industry. Those other 
options (Options 2 and 3 in proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii) and (iii), discussed 

23 If any part of the crane, load or load line could 

not come closer than 20 feet to a power line the 
employer would not be required to take any further 
action under this proposed section. However, the 
employer may encounter a situation where it 
unexpectedly needs to increase the size of the work 
zone. This may occur, for example, as a result of 
an unanticipated need to change the crane’s 
position or to have the crane operate beyond the 
original work zone boundaries. In such a case the 
employer would be required to go back to the first

work zone and conduct a new 20 foot ‘‘trigger’’ 
assessment. 

below) combined with proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b) are designed to afford 
effective protection against the hazards 
of electrocution. 
Paragraph 1408(a)(2)(ii) Option (2) 

Under Option 2 (proposed 

§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii)), the employer 
would be required to maintain a 
minimum clearance distance of 20 feet. 
To help ensure that this distance is not 
breached, the employer would have to 
implement the encroachment 
prevention measures in proposed 
§ 1926.1407(b). Under this proposed 
option, no part of the crane, load or load 
line, including rigging and lifting 
accessories, would be permitted closer 
than 20 feet to the power line. 

Employers using this proposed option 

would, in most cases, have to stay 
further away from the power line than 
under the existing Subpart N’s 10 foot 
rule (employers wanting to use the 10 
foot rule would have to use proposed 
Option 3 (in § 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)). 
However, proper application of the 10 
foot rule, as a practical matter, 
necessitates determining the exact 
voltage of the power line.24 An 
advantage of this proposed option to 
many employers is that they would not 
have to determine the exact voltage of 
the power line (they would only have to 
determine that the line is equal to or 
less than 350 kV). As a practical matter, 
since many employers rely on the utility 
owner/operator to provide voltage 
information, this option would save 
them that step. 

The Committee believed that, since 

the minimum clearance distance would 
be 20 feet, there would be no 
diminution of safety under this option 
since the maximum possible clearance 
distance under the current Subpart N’s 
formula is 20 feet. In fact, in the 
Committee’s experience, most power 
lines encountered by most employers 
have voltages that, under the current 
Subpart N’s formula, require a 
minimum clearance distance of 10 feet. 
Therefore, use of this option would, in 
most cases, result in a higher margin of 
safety. Employers who do not need to 
get closer than 20 feet in order to do 
their work could use this option and 
would be saved the step of obtaining the 
exact line voltage. 

As noted above, in addition to 

maintaining a minimum clearance 
distance of 20 feet, employers using this 
option would be required to implement 
the encroachment prevention and other 

24 As discussed above, the 10 foot rule is a scale 
of voltages and distances that begins at 10 feet and 
increases to 20 feet (for line voltages up to 350kV).

measures specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b). 
Paragraph 1408(a)(2)(iii) Option (3) 

Under Option 3 (proposed 

§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)), the employer 
would be required to maintain a 
minimum clearance distance in 
accordance with Table A (of proposed 
§ 1926.1408). Under Table A, depending 
on the voltage of the power line, the 
minimum approach distance ranges 
from 10 feet to 20 feet.25 Under this 
option the employer would be required 
to determine the line’s voltage. 
As a practical matter, in the 

Committee’s experience, the power lines 
most typically encountered by most 
employers have a minimum clearance 
distance of 10 feet under Table A. As a 
result, employers could usually work 
closer to the lines under this option 
than under Option 2 (proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii)). Table A in essence 
is based upon the same formula as is 
currently used in existing Subpart N. 
Therefore, the minimum clearance 
distance would be similar under Option 
3 (in proposed § 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)) as 
under the existing requirements. 
The information in Table A (of 

proposed § 1926.1408) of the proposed 
rule is similar to information in Table 1 
of ASME B30.5–2004. The Committee 
believed that a table with specified 
clearance distances is more 
understandable than the formula set out 
in the existing Subpart N requirements. 
Proposed Table A is intended to be a 
clear way of conveying the minimum 
clearance distances. 

The enhanced safety that would result 

under this option would stem from the 
fact that, first, there would be an 
affirmative obligation on the employer 
to determine the power line voltage so 
that the correct Table A minimum 
clearance distance could be determined. 
Second, in addition to maintaining the 
minimum clearance distance specified 
in the Table, employers using this 
option would be required to implement 
the encroachment prevention and other 
measures specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b). 

In reviewing C–DAC’s draft of this 

provision, the Agency realized that C– 
DAC inadvertently failed to explicitly 
state that the Table A minimum 
clearance distance must not be 
breached. Therefore, OSHA has 
modified proposed § 1926.1408(a)(2) to 
correct this error. The last sentence of 
the C–DAC language has been expanded 
to read as follows: 

25 The range referred to here is the range in the 

part of the table that is applicable up to 350kV.

If so, then the employer must follow the 

requirements in paragraph (b) to ensure that 
no part of the crane, load line, or load 
(including rigging and lifting accessories), 
gets closer to the line than the minimum 
clearance distance. 

Paragraph 1408(b) Preventing 
Encroachment/Electrocution 

Once the employer has determined 

that some part of the crane, load or load 
line could come within the work zone 
assessment trigger distance of 20 feet of 
a power line (see proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)), if it chooses either 
Option (2) or (3) (of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii) and (iii)), it would 
be required to implement encroachment 
prevention measures to help ensure that 
the applicable minimum approach 
distance (20 feet under Option 2 or the 
Table A (of proposed § 1926.1408) 
distance under Option 3 is not 
breached.26 Most of the measures in this 
proposed paragraph are designed to 
help the employer maintain the 
appropriate distance and thereby 
prevent electrical contact while 
operating the equipment. Some of the 
measures are designed to prevent 
electrocution in the event of electrical 
contact. The committee believed these 
proposed requirements would add 
layers of protection to help keep 
employees safe from energized power 
lines. 
Paragraph 1408(b)(1) 

Under proposed 1408(b)(1) the 

employer would be required to conduct 
a planning meeting with the operator 
and other workers who will be in the 
area of the crane or load. This planning 
meeting must include reviewing the 
location of the power line(s) and the 
steps that will be implemented to 
prevent encroachment and 
electrocution. 

As discussed below, under this 

proposed paragraph, certain 
encroachment/electrocution prevention 
measures would be required (they are 
listed in proposed § 1926.1408(b)(1) 
through (3)). In addition, the employer 
would be required to select at least one 
additional measure from the list in 
proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4). In the 
planning meeting, the employer would 
be required to make that selection and 
review all the measures that will be 
used to comply with this section. The 
purpose of this proposed requirement is 
to ensure that the operator and other 
workers who will be in the area 

26 Alternatively, under Option (1) of proposed 

§ 1926.1408(a)(i), the employer could have the lines 
deenergized and grounded. If Option (1) were 
selected, no further action under this section would 
be required. 

understand these measures and how 
they will be implemented. That 
understanding is important to their 
successful implementation. Because of 
the critical nature of these measures, 
and the seriousness of the consequences 
to the safety of the employees if they are 
not implemented correctly, the 
Committee believed that it is necessary 
for there to be a structured process by 
which the employer communicates this 
information. 
Paragraph 1408(b)(2) 

Proposed § 1926.1408(b)(2) would 
require that where tag lines are used 
they must be non-conductive. This 
provision would provide additional 
protection to those employees who 
would be exposed to electrical hazards 
in the event that the equipment, load 
line, tag line or load contacts a power 
line and the tag line they are holding 
becomes energized. 
Paragraph 1408(b)(3) 

Proposed § 1926.1408(b)(3) would 

require elevated: Warning lines, 
barricades or line of signs, in view of the 
crane operator equipped with flags or 
similar high-visibility markings, at 20 
feet from the power line (if using Option 
(2) (of proposed § 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii)) or 
at the minimum approach distance 
under Table A (if using Option (3) (of 
proposed § 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)). This 
provision is designed to serve as a 
reminder to the operator that there are 
power lines with associated minimum 
clearance distances that must be met. 
Warning lines, barricades or a line of 
signs in the operator’s view equipped 
with high-visibility markings would 
also indicate to the operator where the 
minimum approach distance boundary 
is located. This would serve as one of 
two layers of protection (the second 
layer would consist of an additional 
means selected by the employer under 
proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4), discussed 
below). 

C–DAC discussed and ultimately 

rejected the idea of permitting a visual 
line on the ground which would mark 
the minimum approach distance 
because an operator would generally not 
notice or see a line on the ground and 
because, from where the operator sits, it 
would be particularly difficult for the 
operator to extrapolate from that line the 
location of the boundary in the air. The 
committee decided that these visual 
reminders need to be elevated, or as the 
proposed definition states, sufficiently 
elevated from the ground level to 
accurately enable the operator to judge 
the distance between the load, load line 
(including rigging and lifting

accessories) or crane and the boundary 
marked by the elevated warning line. 

In reviewing the C–DAC draft of this 

provision, OSHA realized that there 
may be situations where the employer 
would not be able to place such a line 
so that it would be visible to the 
operator. In such a case, in order to have 
two layers of protection, it would be 
necessary to require that a dedicated 
spotter be used in addition to one of the 
other (non-spotter) methods described 
below in proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4). 
Therefore, OSHA is planning on 
modifying this proposed provision by 
adding the following after the last 
sentence in proposed § 1926.1408(b)(3): 
If the operator is unable to see the elevated 

warning line, a dedicated spotter must be 
used as described in § 1926.1408(b)(4)(ii) in 
addition to implementing either the measure 
described in § 1926.1408(b)(4)(i), (iii), (iv) or 
(v). 

The Agency requests public comment 

on this issue. 
Paragraph 1408(b)(4) 

This proposed section sets out a list 

of five prevention measures, from which 
the employer would be required to 
select at least one, when the employer 
elects to use either Option (2) or Option 
(3) under § 1926.1408(a)(2). In the 
Committee’s experience, the use of any 
one of these measures, in combination 
with the required measures listed 
elsewhere in proposed § 1926.1408(b), 
would be feasible and effective in 
protecting against encroachment/ 
electrocution. The first four measures 
are methods for encroachment 
prevention. The fifth measure is a 
method of electrocution prevention in 
the event of electrical contact with a 
power line. Specifically, the employer 
would be required to choose either: (i) 
A proximity alarm; (ii) the use of a 
dedicated spotter; (iii) a device that 
automatically warns the operator when 
to stop (i.e., a range control warning 
device); (iv) a device that automatically 
limits the range of movement of the 
equipment; or (v) an insulating link/ 
device. 

C–DAC believed that allowing the 
employer to choose from a variety of 
options for this second layer of 
protection would allow the employer to 
select a method that it believed would 
be suitable, would increase the 
likelihood of employer compliance and 
would be an effective approach to 
reducing power line related injuries and 
fatalities. 

In situations where an employer 

chooses the option of using a dedicated 
spotter, the employer would be required 
to meet the proposed requirements for 
spotters in proposed

§ 1926.1408(b)(4)(ii). As specified in 
proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4)(ii)(A), the 
spotter would have to be equipped with 
a visual aid to assist in identifying the 
minimum clearance distance. The 
Committee concluded that a visual aid 
is needed for the spotter because of the 
difficulty in visualizing the minimum 
clearance distance boundary in the air 
(as discussed above). 

In the C–DAC version of this 

paragraph, examples of visual aids 
included a line painted on the ground, 
a clearly visible line of stanchions or a 
set of line-of-sight landmarks. An 
example of a clearly visible set of line- 
of-sight landmarks would be a fence 
post positioned behind the dedicated 
spotter and a building corner ahead of 
the spotter. 

In reviewing C–DAC’s draft of this 
provision, the Agency noted that that 
the stanchions and landmarks would 
have to be ‘‘clearly visible,’’ but that this 
language was not used with respect to 
the example of a painted line on the 
ground. Since all such visual aids 
would have to be clearly visible to be 
effective, and that was the evident 
intent of C–DAC, the Agency has 
modified the C–DAC language so that, 
in the proposed provision, all the listed 
examples would have to be ‘‘clearly 
visible.’’ This revision was also made in 
proposed § 1926.1407(b)(3)(i)(A). 

Under proposed 

§ 1926.1408(b)(4)(ii)(B)–(D), the spotter 
would have to be positioned so that he/ 
she can effectively gauge the clearance 
distance from the power line; the 
spotter, where necessary, must use 
equipment that enables him/her to 
communicate directly with the 
equipment operator; and the spotter 
must give timely information to the 
operator so that the required clearance 
distance can be maintained. C–DAC 
believed that each criterion is needed 
for the spotter to be able to be effective. 
Proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4)(iii) would 
give the employer the option of using a 
device that automatically warns the 
operator when to stop movement, such 
as a range control warning device. Such 
a device must be set to give the operator 
sufficient warning to prevent 
encroachment. ‘‘Range control warning 
device’’defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a 
device that can be set by an equipment 
operator to warn that the boom or jib tip 
is at a plane or multiple planes.’’ For 
example: an employer has chosen the 
option of maintaining a 20 foot distance 
from the power line. Under proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b)(4), it has chosen to use a 
range control warning device to help 
maintain that distance. The device 
would have to be set to alert the 
operator in time to prevent the boom, 

load line or load (which ever is closest 
to the line) from breaching that 20 foot 
distance. As a practical matter, the 
device would have to be set to sound 
the warning more than 20 feet from the 
line, since the operator will need some 
time to react and to account for the 
momentum of the equipment, load line 
and load. 

Proposed § 1926.1408 (b)(4)(iv) would 
give the employer the option of using a 
device that automatically limits the 
equipment’s range of motion and is set 
to prevent encroachment. Such a device 
could be particularly suitable for tower 
cranes, for which the swing angle can be 
programmed so that the operator cannot 
move the boom or jib past a certain 
range. The Committee recognized that it 
may be more technically difficult to 
apply swing limitation devices for use 
in mobile cranes but believed that the 
technology may develop so that they 
could be used in such cranes. 

As noted above, the insulating link 
option that would be available under 
proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4)(v) would not 
protect against encroachment but would 
provide protection to employees 
handling the load against electrocution 
in the event encroachment did occur. 
Such a device would have to be 
installed between the end of the load 
line and the load. When so installed, it 
prevents the load from becoming 
energized in the event the load line or 
other part of the equipment makes 
electrical contact with a power line. 
Preventing the load from becoming 
energized helps protect riggers, who 
often guide crane loads manually and 
who are therefore at high risk of being 
electrocuted if a load becomes 
energized. 

As stated in proposed § 1926.1401, 

‘‘Insulating link/device’’ would be 
defined as ‘‘an insulating device that 
has been listed, labeled, or accepted by 
a Nationally Recognized Testing 
Laboratory in accordance with 29 CFR 
1910.7.’’ This proposed definition 
reflects the Committee’s concern that 
there be some assurance that the 
insulating link/device would work as 
intended. That assurance would be 
accomplished by requiring that such 
link/device be approved by a Nationally 
Recognized Testing Laboratory. 
Paragraph 1408(b)(5) 

Employers engaged in construction of 

electric transmission and distribution 
lines, which is regulated by 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart V (§§ 1926.950 through 
960), would also have to meet the 
requirements in proposed § 1926.1408, 
with several exceptions. First, in 
accordance with proposed

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

cranes/derricks that is covered by 
Subpart V would not be required to 
comply with the proposed requirements 
in § 1926.1408(b)(4). Subpart V applies 
to the construction of electric 
transmission and distribution lines and 
equipment, which includes the 
alteration, conversion, and 
improvement of existing lines and 
equipment. Thus, when employees are 
engaged in Subpart V work near 
energized lines, by the nature of the job, 
their full attention is on the power lines. 

Subpart V contains additional 

requirements to protect those employees 
against making electrical contact with 
the lines. These include requirements in 
§ 1926.950(c) for guarding the line or 
using insulation (such as insulating 
gloves) to prevent electrical contact. 
Non-Subpart V workers, by contrast, do 
not work directly with the lines, and 
their attention is primarily directed 
elsewhere. In view of these differences, 
the Committee believed that the 
protective measures listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b)(4) were not necessary for 
Subpart V work. 

Second, as explained below in the 
discussion of proposed § 1926.1410, 
when certain prerequisites are met, the 
employer would be permitted to use the 
minimum clearance distances in 
Subpart V’s Table V–1. Also explained 
in that discussion is that where 
additional prerequisites are met, work 
would be permitted closer than the 
Table V–1 distances. 

Third, an employer engaged in 

Subpart V work would not be subject to 
the restrictions regarding operations 
below power lines, as explained in the 
discussion below of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(d). 
Paragraph 1408(c) Voltage Information 

This proposed section operates in 

conjunction with proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii) (Option 3—Table 
A clearance). Where an employer elects 
to use Option (3) (of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)), it would be 
required under proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)(A) to determine 
the voltage of the power lines. Under 
proposed § 1926.1408(c), utility owners/ 
operators of these lines must provide 
the requested voltage information 
within two working days of the request. 

The Committee believed that for 

Option (3) (of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(iii)) to be viable, a 
reasonable time limit for the utility 
owner/operator to respond is needed. 
Employers must generally rely on the 
utility owner/operator to provide the 
voltage of the power line. The 
Committee was concerned that an 
extended delay in obtaining the

information would lead some employers 
to do the work anyway without the 
information. The committee believed 
that two business days would be a 
reasonable amount of time to allow the 
utility owners/operator to respond and 
be sufficiently short to be useful to the 
employer requesting the information.27 

As discussed above with respect to 
proposed § 1926.1407(e), the Agency 
would interpret ‘‘working days’’ to 
mean Monday through Friday, 
excluding federal holidays, unless this 
rule contains a different definition, and 
is asking for comment on whether a 
different definition should be included 
in the rule. 
Paragraph 1408(d) Operations Below 
Power Lines 

The Committee believed that there is 
a substantially enhanced likelihood of 
breaching the applicable minimum 
clearance distance when a crane 
operates below a power line. This is due 
to several factors, including the greater 
difficulty of judging the distance to the 
line when the line is above the 
equipment and the fact that in most 
such situations the operator has to 
purposely look up to see the line (and 
therefore is more likely to forget its 
location or that it is there). 

This proposed section addresses this 

problem by prohibiting any part of a 
crane, load or load line (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) from 
being below a power line unless the 
employer has confirmed with the utility 
owner/operator that the power line is 
deenergized and visibly grounded at the 
worksite or unless the employer can 
demonstrate that it meets one of the four 
exceptions in proposed 
§ 1926.1408(d)(2). 

The first exception, 

§ 1926.1408(d)(2)(i), is that the work the 
employer is doing is covered by 29 CFR 
part 1926 subpart V. Subpart V work 
involves work on the power line itself 
and commonly requires equipment to 
operate below a power line. As 
explained above with respect to 
proposed paragraph § 1926.1408(b)(5), 
Subpart V work does not require all of 
the precautions required of other work 
because the full attention of the workers 
is directed at the power line. The 
Committee believed that the other 
precautions required during Subpart V 
work would provide adequate 
protection when equipment operates 
below power lines during Subpart V 
work. 

The second exception, 

§ 1926.1408(d)(2)(ii), would be for 

27 As noted in the introduction, C–DAC included 

a member from the electric utility industry. 

equipment with non-extensible booms 
and the third exception, 
§ 1926.1408(d)(2)(iii), would be for 
equipment with articulating or 
extensible booms. These exceptions 
would apply when the boom, either at 
its most vertical point (for non- 
extensible booms) or at its fullest 
extension (for extensible booms), will be 
more than 20 feet below the plane of the 
power line or more than the Table A (of 
proposed § 1926.1408) minimum 
clearance distance below the plane of 
the power line. Where this criterion is 
met, it is not possible for the minimum 
clearance distance to be breached. 

The last exception, 

§ 1926.1408(d)(2)(iv), is where the 
employer can demonstrate that it is 
infeasible to comply with proposed 
§ 1926.1408(d)(1), which prohibits any 
part of a crane, load or load line from 
being below a power line unless the line 
is deenergized and visibly grounded. 
Under this proposed exception, the 
employer must not only show that 
compliance with § 1926.1408(d)(1) is 
infeasible, it must also comply with the 
requirements in proposed § 1926.1410. 
Proposed § 1926.1410 governs 
equipment operations closer than the 
Table A (of proposed § 1926.1408) 
minimum approach distances. The 
Committee believed that in such 
instances those additional protective 
measures are needed to prevent the 
minimum clearance distance 
established under proposed 
§ 1926.1410(c) from being breached and 
to protect the employees in the event of 
electrical contact with the power line. 
Paragraph 1408(e) Power Lines 
Presumed Energized 

This proposed paragraph would 

require employers to assume that all 
power lines are energized unless the 
utility owner/operator confirms that the 
power line has been and continues to be 
deenergized and visibly grounded at the 
worksite. This fundamental precaution 
is essentially the same as currently in 
Subpart N at § 1926.550(a)(15)(vi). 
Paragraph 1408(f) 

Proposed paragraph (f) addresses the 

danger that employees could receive 
electrical shock from equipment that is 
operating near a transmission or 
communication tower. During such 
operation, the equipment could act as 
an antenna and become energized by the 
electromagnetic signal emitted by the 
tower. When the equipment is close 
enough for an electrical charge to be 
induced in the equipment or load, 
proposed § 1926.1408(f) would require 
the transmitter to be deenergized or the 
following precautions taken: the

equipment must be grounded, and non- 
conductive rigging or an insulating link/ 
device must be used. 

Currently, Subpart N, at 

§ 1926.550(a)(15)(vii), requires that 
when equipment is close enough to a 
transmission tower for an electrical 
charge to be induced, the equipment 
must be grounded and a ground jumper 
cable must connect the load to the 
equipment. In addition, nonconductive 
poles having large alligator clips or 
other similar protection must be used to 
connect the ground jumper cable to the 
load. By connecting the load to the 
grounded equipment, any electrical 
charge induced in the load will be 
dissipated. In the Committee’s 
experience, this precaution is neither 
necessary nor commonly taken. The 
Committee believed that the proposal’s 
requirement for nonconductive rigging 
or an insulating link reflects current safe 
industry practice. 

OSHA notes that the requirement for 
nonconductive rigging or an insulating 
link in proposed § 1926.1408(f) is a 
fundamentally different approach than 
requiring a ground jumper cable to be 
used as specified in current 
§ 1926.550(a)(15)(vii). The latter 
connects the load to the equipment and 
grounds the load, while proposed 
paragraph (f) would insulate the load 
from the equipment. It appears that only 
an employee who is contacting the load 
would be affected by this provision. The 
Agency requests public comment on the 
following questions: (1) Is it necessary 
to take special precautions to ground the 
equipment to protect an employee who 
contacts the equipment? (2) Are 
employees best protected by proposed 
paragraph (f), by current Subpart N, or 
by some other means, such as requiring 
that they only handle the load with an 
insulated tag line or other means of 
insulation? 
Paragraph 1408(g) Training 

During C–DAC discussions, members 

stressed the importance of providing 
appropriate training to operators and 
their crew regarding power line safety. 
The Committee believed that training is 
a necessary component in reducing 
crane related fatalities. 

The training topics listed are designed 
to ensure that both the operator and the 
other crew members have the 
information they need to protect 
themselves from power line hazards. 

The Committee believed that training 

for power line safety should not be 
limited to operators because any crew 
member who is near the equipment is 
potentially at risk of electrocution. 
The Agency notes that proposed 
§ 1926.1408(g) does not address the

timing and frequency of this training. 
OSHA requests public comment on 
whether and, if so, how the standard 
should address training timing and 
frequency. 

In addition, proposed 

§ 1926.1408(g)(1)(i)(E) would requiring 
training in the need to avoid 
approaching or touching ‘‘the 
equipment.’’ OSHA believes that C– 
DAC inadvertently failed to add the 
phrase ‘‘and the load’’ to this provision, 
since whenever the equipment is in 
electrical contact with a power line, the 
load may also be energized. OSHA 
requests public comment on whether 
this provision should be modified to 
correct this omission. 
Paragraph 1408(h) 

This proposed provision would 

require that where devices originally 
designed by the manufacturer for use as 
safety devices, operational aids, or a 
means to prevent power line contact or 
electrocution are used to comply with 
proposed § 1926.1408, they must meet 
the manufacturer’s procedures for use 
and conditions of use. The Committee 
believed that this provision is necessary 
to ensure that the devices will work as 
intended. 

OSHA notes that § 1926.1408 uses the 

term ‘‘range limit device’’ in 
§ 1926.1408(a)(1)(i) but that no 
definition of this term is provided in 
§ 1926.1401. OSHA believes that C–DAC 
understood a range limit device to be a 
device that physically limits how far a 
crane can boom out and the angle 
within which the boom can swing. 
OSHA requests public comment on 
whether a definition of ‘‘range limit 
device’’ should be added to § 1926.1401 
and, if so, whether the definition in this 
paragraph is appropriate. 
Section 1409 Power Line Safety (Over 
350 kV) 

Under this proposed section, the 

requirements in proposed §§ 1926.1407 
and 1926.1408 would apply to power 
lines rated over 350 kV in all respects 
except one: wherever the regulatory text 
states ‘‘20 feet,’’ ‘‘50 feet’’ is substituted. 
Therefore, the ‘‘trigger’’ distance that 
would be used when assessing the work 
zone would be 50 feet. In addition, an 
employer engaged in assembly/ 
disassembly that is using Option 2 of 
proposed § 1926.1407 (a)(2), or an 
employer engaged in crane operations 
that is using Option 2 of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii), would be required 
to maintain a minimum clearance 
distance of 50 feet. This would apply to 
all power lines rated over 350 kV, 
including power lines over 1,000 kV. 

For power lines over 1,000 kilovolts, 

employers electing to use Table A (of 
proposed § 1926.1408 in either 
assembly/disassembly (Option 3 in 
proposed § 1926.1407(a)(3)) or crane 
operations (Option 3 in proposed 
§ 1926.1408 (a)(2)(iii) would be 
required, pursuant to instructions in the 
Table, to maintain a minimum clearance 
distance determined by the utility 
owner/operator or a registered 
professional engineer who is a qualified 
person with respect to electrical power 
transmission and distribution. 

In reviewing this regulatory language, 

OSHA recognized that a minimum 
clearance distance of 50 feet may be 
inadequate for the open-ended category 
of ‘‘over 1,000 kV.’’ In fact, at some 
point in that range, a utility owner/ 
operator or a registered professional 
engineer may well specify a minimum 
clearance distance of more than 50 feet. 
However, as currently drafted, 
employers using Option 2 (in both 
proposed § 1926.1407(a)(2) and 
§ 1926.1408(a)(2)(ii)) would only have to 
maintain a minimum clearance distance 
of 50 feet. OSHA requests public 
comment on whether Option 2 is 
insufficiently protective for power lines 
rated over 1,000 kV. 
Section 1410 Power Line Safety (All 
Voltages)—Crane Operations Closer 
Than the Table A Zone 

The existing Subpart N requirements 

do not permit work closer than the 10 
foot rule.28 The only exceptions to the 
10 foot rule are where the lines are 
deenergized and visibly grounded or 
where insulating barriers, separate from 
the equipment, have been erected. 
However, the Committee recognized 
that many employers, without meeting 
the exceptions, nonetheless work closer 
than the 10 foot rule. 

Specifically, the Committee believed 

that most employers do not use the 
option to deenergize and ground 
because of the time, expense and 
difficulty in making those arrangements. 
In addition, the Committee concluded 
that an ‘‘insulating barrier’’ of the type 
that is currently available does not, by 
itself, adequately protect employees 
because these barriers are only effective 
for ‘‘brush’’ contact. If there is more 
than brush contact, they will not protect 
employees from electrocution because 
the equipment will pierce the device. 

28 As described earlier, the ‘‘10 foot rule’’ is 

shorthand for the formula in existing 29 CFR 1926, 
Subpart N for minimum clearance distances. Under 
the 10 foot rule, for lines rated 50 kV or less, work 
is not permitted closer than 10 feet to an energized 
power line. For lines rated more than 50 kV, a 
clearance of 10 feet plus .4 inch for each 1 kV over 
50 kV is required.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

In order to address the insufficient 

protections provided to employees who 
work closer than the 10 foot rule, the 
Committee developed a new approach, 
which is contained in proposed 
§ 1926.1410. It consists of prerequisites 
and criteria that would apply when 
work must be conducted closer than the 
minimum clearance distance specified 
in Table A (of proposed § 1926.1408). 
The Committee believed that these 
provisions would be both realistic and 
effective for safely working in these 
circumstances. 

This proposed section starts out by 
explicitly prohibiting equipment from 
operating closer than the distances 
specified in Table A (of proposed 
§ 1926.1408) of an energized power line 
except where the employer 
demonstrates compliance with the 
requirements in proposed § 1926.1410. 
Note that, in the discussion below of 

proposed § 1926.1410, references to a 
‘‘registered professional engineer’’ are, 
in accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1410(c)(1), references to a 
registered professional engineer who is 
a qualified person with respect to 
electrical power transmission and 
distribution. 
Paragraphs 1410(a) and (b) 

These proposed paragraphs set forth 
prerequisites that must be met for the 
employer to be permitted to operate 
equipment closer to a power line than 
the applicable Table A (of proposed 
§ 1926.1408) distance. Proposed 
§ 1926.1410(a) would require the 
employer to determine that it is 
infeasible to do the work without 
breaching the minimum approach 
distance under Table A. If the employer 
determines it is infeasible to maintain 
the Table A distance, under proposed 
§ 1926.1410(b) it would also have to 
determine, after consulting with the 
utility owner/operator, that 
deenergizing and grounding the power 
line, as well as relocating the line, are 
infeasible. 
Paragraph 1410(c) Minimum Clearance 
Distance 

After the employer makes the 

infeasibility determinations required by 
proposed § 1926.1410(a) and (b), a 
minimum clearance distance would 
have to be established. Under proposed 
§ 1926.1410(c)(1), the employer can 
establish this distance by either having 
the utility owner/operator determine the 
minimum clearance distance that must 
be maintained or by having a registered 
professional engineer who is a qualified 
person with respect to electrical 
transmission and distribution determine 
the minimum clearance distance that

must be maintained. The Committee 
believed that either of these sources of 
this information has sufficient expertise 
to accurately apply the factors discussed 
below in setting an appropriate 
minimum clearance distance. 

Under proposed § 1926.1410(c)(1), 
regardless of whether it is the utility 
owner/operator or a registered 
professional engineer that makes this 
determination, several factors must be 
considered when establishing the 
minimum clearance distance. These 
factors include, but are not limited to: 
Conditions affecting atmospheric 
conductivity; time necessary to bring 
the equipment, load and load line 
(including rigging and lifting 
accessories) to a complete stop; wind 
conditions; degree of sway in the power 
line; lighting conditions, and other 
conditions affecting the ability to 
prevent electrical contact. 

Under proposed § 1926.1410(c)(2), the 

proposed requirement in 
§ 1926.1410(c)(1) described above 
would not apply to work covered by 
part 1926 subpart V. Instead, the 
minimum clearance distance specified 
in § 1926.950 Table V–1 would apply. 
This proposed paragraph, along with the 
other proposed provisions affecting 
work covered by Subpart V, are 
discussed below at the end of the 
portion of this preamble addressing 
proposed § 1926.1410. 
Paragraph 1410(d) 

Once a minimum clearance distance 
has been established, under proposed 
§ 1926.1410(b) the employer would be 
required to have a planning meeting 
with either the owner/operator of the 
power line or the registered professional 
engineer to determine what procedures 
will be implemented to prevent 
electrical contact and electrocution. In 
accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1410(e), these procedures would 
have to be documented and 
immediately available on-site. In 
addition, in accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1410(f) and (g), these procedures 
would have to be reviewed with the 
operator and other workers who will be 
in the area of the equipment and the 
procedures must be implemented 
(proposed § 1926.1410(e)–(g) are 
discussed below). 

Proposed § 1926.1410(d) sets out the 

minimum protective measures which 
would have to be included in the 
procedures set by the employer and 
utility owner/operator (or registered 
professional engineer). The committee 
believed that these procedures need to 
include more stringent protective 
measures than those set out in proposed 
§ 1926.1408, because equipment will be 

in closer proximity to power lines and 
there would otherwise be a greater risk 
of contacting a power line and causing 
electrocution. Therefore, these 
procedures would have to include, at 
the minimum, the following: 
Paragraph 1410(d)(1) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(1), for 

power lines that are equipped with a 
device that automatically reenergizes 
the circuit in the event of a power line 
contact, the automatic reclosing feature 
of the circuit interrupting device must 
be made inoperative prior to beginning 
work. This would help ensure that, in 
the event of a power line contact and 
activation of the automatic reclosing 
feature, the line would not be 
automatically re-energized. 
Paragraph 1410(d)(2) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(2), a 

dedicated spotter who is in continuous 
contact with the operator would have to 
be used. In addition, the dedicated 
spotter must be equipped with a visual 
aid to assist in identifying the minimum 
clearance distance, must be positioned 
to effectively gauge the clearance 
distance, where necessary must use 
equipment that enables him or her to 
communicate directly with the operator, 
and the spotter must give timely 
information to the operator so the 
required clearance distance can be 
maintained. The need for a spotter 
meeting this criteria is explained above 
in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b)(4)(ii). 
Paragraph 1410(d)(3) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(3), an 
elevated warning line, or barricade that 
is not attached to the equipment, 
positioned to prevent electrical contact, 
would have to be used. This warning 
line or barricade must be in view of the 
operator either directly or by use of 
video equipment and must be equipped 
with flags or similar high-visibility 
markings. The need for an elevated 
warning line or barricade is explained 
above in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b)(3). 

As discussed above in relation to 

proposed § 1926.1408(b)(3), there may 
be situations where the operator is not 
able to see an elevated warning line or 
barricade. To address such situations, 
under proposed § 1926.1408 or 
§ 1926.1409, OSHA is planning to 
change the regulatory text so that the 
employer would be required to use both 
a dedicated spotter and one of the other 
(non-spotter) measures listed in 
proposed § 1926.1408(b)(4). Here, when 
working closer than the Table A (of 
proposed § 1926.1408) clearance

distance, C–DAC believed it is necessary 
to provide an additional layer of 
protection by requiring the use of video 
equipment to enable the operator to see 
the warning line or barricade. Therefore, 
in all cases when working closer than 
the Table A clearance distance, the 
operator will have ‘‘two sets of eyes’’ (in 
addition to other protection required 
under this proposed section) to ensure 
that the equipment maintains the 
minimum clearance distance 
established under proposed 
§ 1926.1410(c). 

As explained in, Subpart V-working 

closer than Table A, that follows the 
discussion of § 1926.1410(k), this 
provision would not apply to subpart V 
work. 
Paragraph 1410(d)(4)
Device 

Insulating Link/ 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(4), an 
insulating link/device would have to be 
installed at a point between the end of 
the load line (or below) and the load. An 
insulating link is a barrier to the passage 
of electrical current. When used on a 
crane, it prevents the load from 
becoming energized if the boom or the 
load line makes electrical contact with 
a power line. In such situations it 
protects employees who make contact 
with the load or are holding a tag line. 
As explained in, Subpart V-working 

closer than Table A, that follows the 
discussion of § 1926.1410(k), this 
requirement to install an insulating 
link/device would only apply when 
working closer than the § 1926.950 
Table V–1 clearance distances. 
Paragraph 1410(d)(5) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(5), if 

the rigging may be closer than the Table 
A (of proposed § 1926.1408) distance 
during the operation, it would be 
required to be non-conductive rigging. 
This would provide protection to those 
employees who would be exposed to 
electrical hazards in the event that the 
rigging contacts a power line, which 
otherwise could energize the rigging and 
the load. 
Paragraph 1410(d)(6) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(6), if 

the crane is equipped with a device that 
automatically limits range of movement, 
it would have to be used and set to 
prevent any part of the crane, load or 
load line (including rigging and lifting 
accessories) from breaching the 
minimum approach distance established 
under proposed paragraph (c) of 
§ 1926.1410.

Paragraph 1410(d)(7) 

Paragraph 1410(d)(11) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(7), if a 
tag line is used it would have to be non- 
conductive. This requirement would 
provide additional protection to those 
employees who would be exposed to 
electrical hazards in the event that the 
equipment contacts a power line and 
the tag line they are holding becomes 
energized, or in the event that the tag 
line makes contact with the power line. 
Paragraph 1410(d)(8) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(8), 
barricades would have to be used to 
form a perimeter at least 10 feet away 
from the equipment to prevent 
unauthorized personnel from entering 
the work area. In areas where obstacles 
prevent the barricade from being at least 
10 feet away, the barricade would be 
required to be as far from the equipment 
as feasible. This provision, along with 
proposed § 1926.1410(d)(9) and (d)(10), 
would minimize the likelihood that any 
more employees than are absolutely 
necessary to the operation would be 
near the equipment in the event the 
equipment, load or load line makes 
electrical contact with the power line. 
Paragraph 1410(d)(9) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(9), 

employees other than the operator 
would be prohibited from touching the 
load line above the insulating link/ 
device and equipment. It is the Agency’s 
understanding that the Committee’s 
rationale for not extending this 
prohibition to the operator is that the 
operator, by being in the cab, is going 
to be in electrical contact with both the 
equipment and load line. However, this 
assumes that the operator is in fact 
standing or sitting on the equipment. 
There may be some situations where 
this is not the case. For example, some 
equipment may be operated by pendant 
control or wireless control; in such 
cases the operator need not be on the 
equipment to control it. OSHA requests 
public comment on this issue. 
Paragraph 1410(d)(10) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(10), 

only personnel essential to the 
operation would be permitted to be in 
the area of the equipment and the load. 
In conjunction with proposed 
§ 1926.1410(d)(8) and (d)(9), this would 
minimize the likelihood that any more 
employees than are absolutely necessary 
to the operation would be near the 
equipment in the event the equipment, 
load or load line makes electrical 
contact with the power line. 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(11), the 

equipment would be required to be 
properly grounded. In the event the 
equipment inadvertently makes 
electrical contact with the power line, 
proper grounding would protect 
employees in two ways. First, if the line 
is equipped with a circuit interrupting 
device, the grounding will result in a 
current surge that will trip the device 
and deenergize the line. Second, in the 
event an employee on the ground is 
touching the equipment when it 
contacts the power line, proper 
grounding will reduce the danger to the 
employee by providing an alternative, 
low resistance path to ground for the 
electric current. 

In reviewing this proposed paragraph, 
OSHA has identified what appears to be 
a conflict between this proposed 
provision and a provision in Subpart V’s 
§ 1926.952(c)(2)(iii) regarding grounding 
of equipment. This issue is explained 
under the heading, Subpart V work— 
working closer than Table V–1, that 
follows the discussion of § 1926.1410(k). 
Paragraph 1410(d)(12) 

Under proposed paragraph (d)(12), 

insulating line hoses or cover-ups 
would be required to be installed by the 
utility owner/operator except where 
such devices are unavailable for the line 
voltages involved. The Committee noted 
that Subpart N, at § 1926.550(a)(15), 
currently allows such insulating barriers 
to be used as a complete alternative to 
deenergizing and grounding or to 
maintaining the applicable minimum 
clearance distance from the power line. 
However, the Committee believed that 
such insulating devices do not provide 
complete protection because they can be 
pierced if the equipment makes more 
than brushing contact with the device. 
However, the Committee believed that 
these insulating devices do provide 
protection if there is brushing contact 
and that such devices are useful to 
supplement the other protective 
measures provided by the requirements 
of this proposed § 1926.1410(d). 
Paragraph 1410(e) 

Under proposed paragraph (e), the 

procedures that are developed to 
comply with proposed § 1926.1410(d) 
would have to be documented and 
immediately available on-site. This 
would ensure that these procedures are 
available to be used as a reference while 
the work is in progress. 
Paragraph 1410(f) 

Under proposed paragraph (f), the 

equipment user and utility owner/ 
operator would be required to meet with

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

the equipment operator and the other 
employees who will be in the area of the 
equipment or load to review the 
procedures that are developed under 
proposed § 1926.1410(d) to prevent a 
breach of the minimum clearance 
distance established under proposed 
§ 1926.1410(c). The Committee believed 
that it is important that this review take 
place so that the operator and other 
employees understand this critical 
information and have the opportunity to 
discuss the procedures with the utility 
owner/operator, who has a high level of 
expertise regarding the power lines. 
Paragraphs 1410(g) and (h) 

Under proposed paragraphs (g) and 
(h), the employer would be required to 
implement the procedures developed in 
accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1410(d). The utility owner/ 
operator and all employers of the 
employees involved in the work would 
have to identify one person who will 
direct the implementation of the 
procedures. This person would have to 
direct the implementation of the 
procedures and have the authority to 
stop work at any time to ensure safety. 

The Committee believed that, in view 
of the fact that more than one employer 
is typically involved in these situations, 
coordination among the employers of 
these employees is needed for the 
protective measures to be effectively 
implemented. Once the operation is 
underway, safety-related orders 
typically need to be given and followed 
without delay. Since an employee of 
one employer typically would not 
immediately follow an instruction from 
another employer, it is necessary that, 
before these operations begin, all 
employees understand that the one 
designated person will have this 
authority. For these reasons, the 
Committee believed that there needs to 
be one person who all involved in the 
operation recognize as having this role 
and authority. 

Paragraph 1410(i). [Reserved.] This 

paragraph would be reserved because it 
is inconvenient for readers to determine 
whether ‘‘(i)’’ is being used as a letter or 
a roman numeral. 
Paragraph 1410(j) 

This proposed provision would 
require the employer to safely stop 
operations if a problem occurs with 
implementing the procedures in 
paragraph (d) or if there is an indication 
that those procedures are inadequate to 
prevent electrocution. In addition, this 
proposed provision would require that 
the employer either develop new 
procedures which comply with 
paragraph (d) or contact the utility

owner/operator and have them 
deenergize and visibly ground or 
relocate the power line(s) before 
resuming operations. 
Paragraph 1410(k) 

This proposed provision would 

require that where a device originally 
designed by the manufacturer for use as 
a safety device, operational aid, or a 
means to prevent power line contact or 
electrocution is used to comply with 
proposed § 1926.1410 it must meet the 
manufacturer’s procedures for use and 
conditions of use. The Committee 
believed that this provision is necessary 
to ensure that the devices will work as 
intended. 
Subpart V Work—Working Closer Than 
Table A 

In considering the circumstances 

under which work closer than the Table 
A (of proposed § 1926.1408) distances 
would be permitted, C–DAC recognized 
that it was necessary to address the 
special circumstances of power line 
work covered by 29 CFR 1926 subpart 
V. That subpart applies to the erection 
of new electric transmission and 
distribution lines and equipment, and 
the alteration, conversion, and 
improvement of existing transmission 
and distribution lines and equipment. 

Currently, under subparts V and N of 
part 1926, employers engaged in subpart 
V work are not required to comply with 
the ‘‘10 foot rule.’’ Instead, with some 
exceptions, they are required to 
maintain the minimum clearance 
distances specified in subpart V’s Table 
V–1.29 Table V–1 has minimum 
clearance distances that are less than the 
‘‘10 foot rule’’ (and, therefore, less than 
the proposed rule’s Table A distances). 
As discussed below, under this 
proposed standard, employers engaged 
in subpart V work would continue to be 
permitted to use the Table V–1 
minimum clearance distances. However, 
C–DAC believed that additional 
protection is needed for these workers. 
Therefore, this proposed rule includes 
new prerequisites and criteria that must 
be met before the Table V–1 minimum 
clearance distances could be used.30 

29 Since C–DAC developed its consensus 

document, OSHA has proposed t amend part 1926 
subpart V by, among other things, replacing Table 
V–1. 70 FR 34821 (June 15, 2005). If OSHA issues 
a final rule modifying Subpart V before issuing a 
final rule based on this proposal, OSHA will take 
into account any modifications to Subpart V, 
including Table V–1, in drafting this final rule. 

30 The only exceptions to the application of this 
proposed rule to subpart V of part 1926 V of part 
1926 work are those contained in §§ 1926.1407– 
1411; all other aspects of the proposed rule would 
apply. This is consistent with the current Subpart 
V, for § 1926.952(c) of Subpart V requires 

The Committee believed that it is 
appropriate for employers using 
equipment for subpart V of part 1926 
activities to work closer than the Table 
A (of proposed § 1926.1408) distances 
only where the prerequisites and criteria 
for doing so set out in proposed 
§ 1926.1410, which are applicable to all 
employers, are met. Therefore, for 
subpart V work, the employer would be 
required to maintain the clearance 
distances in Table A except where the 
employer demonstrates infeasibility. 
In addition, it would be required to 

implement most of the protective 
measures required by this proposed 
standard. As discussed above, Subpart V 
work would not be subject to the 
requirement for an additional protective 
measure from the list in proposed 
§ 1926.1408(b)(4). The Committee 
believed that, with certain exceptions 
explained below, such additional 
measure would not be necessary for 
such work. Also, subpart V work would 
not be subject to the prohibition in 
proposed § 1926.1408(d)(1) against 
equipment operating under power lines 
(see discussion above of proposed 
paragraph 1408(d)(2)(i)). 

However, when, as will often be the 
case, it is not feasible to maintain the 
Table A (of proposed § 1926.1408) 
distances for subpart V work, under 
proposed § 1926.1410(c)(2), the 
clearance distances in Table V–1 would 
normally apply. The Committee 
concluded that it was not necessary to 
require employers engaged in subpart V 
work to undertake the process in 
proposed § 1926.1410(c)(1) for 
establishing a minimum clearance 
distance when it is infeasible to comply 
with the Table A (of proposed 
§ 1926.1408) clearances. The existing 
clearance distances for subpart V work 
found in Table V–1 recognize that such 
work often requires that equipment get 
closer to the lines than the clearance 
distances specified in Table A and were 
specifically drafted to address subpart V 
work. Therefore, proposed § 1926.1410 
(c)(2) would exempt subpart V work 
from proposed § 1926.1410(c)(1) and 
would state instead that the minimum 
clearance distances specified in 
§ 1926.950 Table V–1 would apply. 

Furthermore, under proposed 

§ 1926.1410(d)(3), an employer engaged 
in subpart V work closer than the Table 
A distance would not be required to use 
an elevated warning line or barricade. It 
is the Agency’s understanding that the 

equipment operating near power lines to comply 
with the current cranes and derricks standard in 
Subpart N. Therefore, the portion of the current 
§ 1926.952(c) that requires equipment operating 
near power lines to comply with the cranes and 
derricks standard would be retained.

Committee’s rationale for this exclusion 
was that when subpart V work takes 
place closer than the Table A distances, 
a warning line would interfere with the 
tools, cables, and other material used in 
subpart V work. However, it is unclear 
to the Agency why this would also be 
the case if a barricade were used. The 
Agency requests public comment on 
this issue. 

The provisions of this proposed 
standard would necessitate certain 
conforming amendments to the subpart 
V provisions dealing with lifting 
equipment to eliminate obsolete 
requirements and promote clarity. 
Currently, § 1926.952(c)(1) reads as 
follows 

(c) Derrick trucks, cranes and other lifting 

equipment. (1) All derrick trucks, cranes, and 
other lifting equipment shall comply with 
subpart N and O of this part except: 

(i) As stated in § 1926.550(a)(15)(i) and (ii) 

relating to clearance (for clearances in this 
subpart see Table V–1) and 

(ii) Derrick truck (electric line trucks) shall 

not be required to comply with 
§ 1926.550(a)(7)(vi), (a)(17), (b)(2), and (e). 
These subpart V provisions would 

need to be modified in several respects. 
First, service trucks with mobile lifting 
devices designed specifically for use in 
the power line and electric service 
industries, such as digger derricks 
(radial boom derricks), when used in 
these industries for auguring holes to set 
power and utility poles, or handling 
associated materials to be installed or 
removed from utility poles, are 
excluded from the scope of this 
proposed standard. They would, 
however, continue to be covered by 
subpart V when used in this manner. 
Specifically, subpart V’s current 
requirement that the minimum 
clearance distances of Table V–1 be met 
when using such equipment would be 
retained when such equipment is used 
outside the coverage of the new cranes 
and derricks standard. 

Since these trucks, when used in the 

manner described, would be outside the 
scope of the new cranes and derricks 
standard, subpart V’s provision in 
§ 1926.952(c)(1)(ii) stating that derrick 
trucks need not comply with 
§§ 1926.550(a)(7)(vi), (a)(17), (b)(2), and 
(e), which incorporate the requirements 
of certain industry consensus standards, 
would no longer be necessary. 

Second, the subpart V provisions 

would be changed to reflect the 
terminology used in the scope section of 
this proposed standard and its new 
subpart designation (Subpart CC). With 
respect to ‘‘cranes and other lifting 
equipment,’’ § 1926.952(c)(1)(i) would 
be unnecessary since proposed 
§§ 1926.1407 through 1926.1411 of this

proposed standard address the 
applicable minimum clearance 
distances, including the circumstances 
under which the clearance distances in 
Table V–1 would apply. 

Accordingly, § 1926.952(c)(1) would 

be amended to read: 

(c) Cranes and other lifting equipment. (1) 
All equipment covered by Subpart CC that is 
used for work covered by this standard 
[Subpart V], including cranes and other 
lifting equipment, shall comply with 
subparts CC and O of this part. 

(2) Service trucks with mobile lifting 

devices designed specifically for use in the 
power line and electric service industries, 
such as digger derricks (radial boom 
derricks), when used in these industries for 
auguring holes to set power and utility poles, 
or handling associated materials to be 
installed or removed from utility poles, must 
meet the applicable minimum clearance 
distance in Table V–1. 

Subpart V Work—Working Closer Than 
Table V–1 

Currently, § 1926.952(c)(2) recognizes 

that there are circumstances when the 
Table V–1 clearance distances cannot be 
maintained during Subpart V work and 
lists requirements that must be met 
when this is the case. OSHA believes 
that C–DAC intended to permit Subpart 
V work closer than the Table V–1 
clearances when the precautions in 
§ 1926.952(c)(2), as well as additional 
precautions contained in proposed 
§ 1926.1410(d), are followed. 

To make this clear, OSHA is 

proposing to add the following language 
to proposed § 1926.1410(c)(2): 
‘‘Employers engaged in Subpart V work 
are permitted to work closer than the 
distances in § 1926.950 Table V–1 
where both the requirements of this 
section and § 1926.950(c)(2)(i) and (ii) 
are met.’’ [Note that subsections (i) and 
(ii) are currently subsections (iii) and 
(iv) but would be renumbered under the 
proposed amended language of 
§ 1926.950(c)(2) discussed below]. 
OSHA requests public comment on this 
proposed addition. 

This proposed change would require 

conforming amendments to 
§ 1926.952(c)(2), which currently reads 
as follows: 

(2) With the exception of equipment 

certified for work on the proper voltage, 
mechanical equipment shall not be operated 
closer to any energized line or equipment 
than the clearances set forth in § 1926.950(c) 
unless: 

(i) An insulated barrier is installed between 

the energized part and the mechanical 
equipment, or 

(ii) The mechanical equipment is 

grounded, or 

insulated, or 

(iii) The mechanical equipment is 

(iv) The mechanical equipment is 

considered as energized. 

Under this proposed section, the 
precautions specified in paragraphs 
§ 1926.952(c)(2)(i) and (ii) would be 
required under proposed § 1926.1410(d) 
when equipment used in Subpart V 
work is operated closer than the Table 
V–1 clearances. Since these precautions 
would now be required by proposed 
§ 1926.1410(d), OSHA is proposing to 
delete them from Subpart V as 
redundant. OSHA is therefore proposing 
to amend § 1926.952(c)(2) to read as 
follows: 

(2) With the exception of equipment 

certified for work on the proper voltage, 
mechanical equipment shall not be operated 
closer to any energized line or equipment 
than the clearances set forth in § 1926.950(c) 
unless, in addition to the requirements in 
§ 1926.1410: 

(i) The mechanical equipment is insulated, 

or 

(ii) The mechanical equipment is 

considered as energized. 

OSHA requests public comment on 

the proposed amendments to 
§ 1926.950(c)(1) and (2) of Subpart V 
described above. 

In addition, OSHA notes that, under 
the current 29 CFR Part 1926 Subpart V 
requirement in § 1926.952(c)(2), when 
doing Subpart V work closer than the 
Table V–1 distances, the equipment 
must be insulated or considered 
energized.31 However, proposed 
§ 1926.1410 does not have a similar 
requirement. Therefore, an employer 
engaged in Subpart V work that was 
closer than the Table V–1 distances 
would continue to be required (under 
§ 1926.952(c)(2)) to insulate or consider 
the equipment energized, but an 
employer engaged in non-Subpart V 
work at the same distance would not. 
The Agency requests public comment 
on whether such requirements should 
also apply to non-Subpart V work when 
working closer than the Table V–1 
distances. 

Finally, OSHA notes that in this zone, 

one of the options that an employer 
engaged in Subpart V currently has 
under § 1926.952(c)(2)(iii) is to insulate 
the equipment. Under proposed 
§ 1926.1410(d)(11), that employer would 
also have to ground the equipment. The 
Agency’s understanding of how 
equipment can be simultaneously 

31 In Subpart V, when equipment is considered 

energized, a number of Subpart V requirements are 
triggered. See, for example, § 1926.951(c)(1) 
(restricting use of metal or conductive ladders near 
energized equipment); § 1926.951(f)(3) (hydraulic 
tools used on or around energized equipment shall 
use nonconducting hoses); § 1926.953(c) (materials 
or equipment shall not be stored near energized 
equipment if it is practical to store them elsewhere).

insulated and grounded is illustrated by 
the following example: Equipment that 
has a boom constructed of an insulating 
material (such as fiberglass) is typically 
mounted on a carrier (the ‘‘truck’’ 
portion of the equipment), which is 
constructed mostly of conductive 
material (i.e., steel). Because the boom 
(and the linkages, pneumatic and 
hydraulic lines, and other associated 
parts on the boom) is insulated, the 
equipment is considered insulated 

under (§ 1926.952(c)(2)(iii)). If the 
employer were to ground the carrier, the 
parts of the equipment that could form 
an electrical path to ground (the carrier 
and the conducting parts of the 
equipment forming an electrical path to 
the carrier, such as the load line and 
hoist) would be grounded. Therefore, 
the equipment would meet both the 
insulating option in § 1926.952(c)(2)(iii) 
and the proposed grounding 

requirement in proposed 
§ 1926.1410(d)(11). 
Subpart V Work—Summary 

The differences between how the 

proposed requirements for power line 
safety would apply generally to crane 
operations and how they would apply to 
an employer engaged in work covered 
by Subpart V are summarized in the

Section 1411 Power Line Safety -While 
Traveling 

This proposed section is designed to 
protect against electrical hazards while 
equipment is traveling with no load 
under power lines on construction sites. 
These proposed requirements would 
apply only to cranes/derricks while 
traveling on a construction site under 
power lines; they would not apply to 
equipment while traveling on roads (or 
in areas) that are not part of a 
construction site. 

The following scenario is an example 

of the parameters of the scope of this 
provision: A crane travels on a public 
road to the entrance of a new residential 
tract development. While traveling on 
the public road it passes under 
powerlines. No construction is taking 
place on the public road. The tract, 
including a road that runs through the 
development, is open to construction 
traffic but is otherwise closed to the 
public. In the development, homes are 
in various stages of construction. The

crane enters the development and 
travels along the development road to 
the area where the crane is going to be 
operated. The crane will pass under 
power lines as it travels along this 
development road. 

In this scenario, proposed § 1926.1411 

would not apply with respect to the 
crane traveling along the public road to 
the entrance of the development, since 
that road is not part of a construction 
site. However, it would apply with 
respect to traveling under power lines 
on the development road since the 
development road is part of a 
construction site. 

It was the intention of the Committee 

that the requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1411 apply only with respect to 
such equipment when traveling with no 
load. Power line hazards regarding 
equipment traveling on a construction 
site with a load would be governed by 
the proposed provisions in 
§§ 1926.1408, 1926.1409 and 1926.1410. 

The C–DAC draft of § 1926.1411(a) 

stated: 

(a) This section applies to equipment while 

traveling under a power line on the 
construction site with no load and the boom/ 
mast and boom/mast support system lowered 
sufficiently to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (b). 

In reviewing that draft, the Agency 

realized that it could be misconstrued to 
mean that the requirements of 
§ 1926.1411 would only apply once the 
crane was traveling under a power line; 
in other words, that no action would be 
required of an employer prior to the 
equipment being under the power line. 
To make it clear that there are certain 
proposed provisions in this section that 
would require the employer to make 
determinations and take action before 
the equipment is actually under the 
power line, the Agency has revised the 
Committee’s original language in 
§ 1926.1411(a) to read: 

(a) This section establishes procedures and 

criteria that must be met for equipment 
traveling under a power line on the 
construction site with no load.

59765 

This change clarifies that the 

employer would be required to make 
determinations and take certain actions 
prior to the equipment traveling under 
the power line. For example, under 
proposed § 1926.1411(b)(4), if any part 
of the equipment while traveling would 
get closer than 20 feet to the power line, 
the employer would be required to have 
a dedicated spotter who is in 
continuous contact with the operator. If 
this requirement were to only apply at 
the moment the equipment was under 
the power line, it would not serve the 
purpose of providing the operator with 
someone to assist in gauging the 
clearance distance while the equipment 
is traveling under the power line. 
In addition, the C–DAC draft of 

§ 1926.1411(a) included a reference to 
the boom/mast and boom/mast support 
system being lowered to meet the 
criteria specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1411(b). The Agency was 
concerned that inclusion of that 
reference could be misconstrued as 
meaning that the section is inapplicable 
where the boom/mast and boom/mast 
support system had not been 
sufficiently lowered. Therefore, the 
Agency has modified the paragraph by 
moving that reference to proposed 
1926.1411(b) to explicitly make it part 
of the required criteria for traveling 
under powerlines without a load. The 
C–DAC’s draft of 1926.1411(b)(1) stated: 

(b) The employer shall ensure that: 
(1) The clearances specified in paragraph 

(c), Table T, are maintained. 

This has been changed so that the 

proposed § 1926.1411(b)(1) and (b)(2) 
now state: 

(b) The employer shall ensure that: 
(1) The boom/mast and boom/mast support 

system are lowered sufficiently to meet the 
requirements of this paragraph. 

(2) The clearances specified in Table T of 

this section are maintained. 

Therefore, under these proposed 
provisions, the employer would be 
required to ensure that equipment 
traveling with no load on a construction 
site under a power line has the boom/ 
mast and boom/mast support system 
lowered sufficiently so that the 
clearances specified in Table T are 
maintained. 

In addition to maintaining the Table 

T minimum clearance distances, 
proposed § 1926. § 1926.1411(b)(3) 
would require the employer to ensure 
that the effects of speed and terrain are 
considered so that those effects do not 
cause the minimum clearance distances 
specified in Table T to be breached. 
OSHA is modifying the C–DAC 
language as follows to clarify this 
requirement.

(b)(3) The effects of speed and terrain on 

equipment movement (including movement 
of the boom/mast) are considered so that 
those effects do not cause the minimum 
clearance distances specified in Table T of 
this section to be breached. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(4) would 

require the employer to use a dedicated 
spotter if any part of the equipment 
while traveling will get closer than 20 
feet to a power line. This provision 
would also require that the dedicated 
spotter be in continuous contact with 
the crane operator; be positioned to 
effectively gauge the clearance distance; 
where necessary, use equipment that 
enables the spotter to communicate 
directly with the crane operator; and 
give timely information to the crane 
operator so that the required clearance 
distance can be maintained. The 
Committee believed that each of these 
measures is necessary for the spotter to 
be effective. 

In reviewing proposed 

§ 1926.1411(b)(4), OSHA noted that the 
language ‘‘crane operator’’ was used 
rather than ‘‘driver.’’ For example, 
proposed § 1926.1411(b)(4) reads: 

(4) Dedicated spotter. If any part of the 

equipment while traveling will get within 20 
feet of the power line, the employer shall 
ensure that a dedicated spotter who is in 
continuous contact with the crane operator is 
used * * * 

Because proposed § 1926.1411 deals 

with power line safety while equipment 
is traveling without a load, OSHA 
recognizes that the language ‘‘crane 
operator’’ may not be appropriate in all 
situations. In some cases a crane 
operator may not be the driver of such 
equipment on the construction site. 
Therefore, OSHA is soliciting comments 
on whether the language ‘‘crane 
operator’’ used in proposed 
§ 1926.1411(b)(4) should be changed to 
‘‘driver’’ or ‘‘driver/operator.’’ 

The Committee members were also 
concerned about equipment traveling 
underneath power lines in low visibility 
situations, such as at night, in the rain 
or fog. The electrical hazards posed by 
power lines are exacerbated when the 
driver’s ability to see the power line is 
reduced. The Committee believed that 
additional precautions are necessary in 
light of this heightened danger. 
Therefore, proposed § 1926.1411(b)(5) 
would require the employer to ensure 
the power lines are either illuminated or 
another means of identifying them is 
used and a safe path of travel is 
identified. 

In reviewing the C–DAC draft of this 

provision, OSHA recognized that 
§ 1926.1411(b)(5)(ii) did not clearly state 
the Committee’s intentions. The 
committee intended for employers to 

both identify a safe path of travel and 
also use the identified safe path of 
travel. However, the C–DAC draft stated 
only that a safe path be ‘‘identified,’’ 
which only implicitly means that it be 
used. Therefore OSHA has revised the 
language in § 1926.1411(b)(5)(ii) from: 

(ii) A safe path of travel is identified. 
to read: 
(ii) A safe path of travel is identified and 

used. 

The proposed requirements of this 

section are similar to section 5–3.4.5.5 
of ASME B30.5–2004. The values in 
proposed Table T of proposed 
§ 1926.1411, which provides the 
minimum clearance distances while 
traveling with no load and a lowered 
boom, are substantially similar to the 
values used by ASME. The distinction 
between these proposed requirements 
and those requirements in ASME are 
that the proposed requirements govern 
equipment while traveling under a 
power line and the ASME provisions 
govern mobile cranes while in transit. 
ASME defined ‘‘transit’’ as the moving 
or transporting of a crane from one 
jobsite to another. 

The Agency notes that ASME B30.5– 

2004 calls for equipment in transit to 
maintain a specific clearance distance to 
power lines in accordance with Table 1 
of ASME B30.5. While proposed 
§ 1926.1411 governs equipment 
traveling without a load directly under 
power lines, it does not otherwise 
address the potential hazards associated 
with equipment traveling without a load 
near power lines. Further, as stated 
earlier, equipment traveling with a load, 
whether or not under a power line, 
would be considered ‘‘operations’’ and 
employers would have to comply with 
the proposed requirements in 
§ 1926.1408, 1926.1409, or 1926.1410 in 
such instances. 

However, equipment traveling 

without a load is not covered by either 
proposed § 1926.1410 (operations) or 
§ 1926.1411 (traveling under power 
lines). Therefore, OSHA requests public 
comment on whether it is necessary to 
establish requirements for equipment 
traveling on a construction site without 
a load near power lines. 
Additional Changes to the Regulatory 
Text In Proposed §§ 1926.1407–1411 

In the C–DAC draft of provisions 

dealing with the ‘‘trigger’’ distance for 
further action, the draft referred to 
situations in which the crane, load or 
load line could get ‘‘within’’ the trigger 
distance. Because of the potential for 
confusion as to whether ‘‘within’’ means 
breaching or not breaching that

distance, the Agency has changed 
‘‘within’’ to ‘‘closer than.’’ For example, 
the C–DAC draft of 1926.1407(a) read: 

Before assembling or disassembling a 

crane, the employer must determine if any 
part of the crane, load line or load (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) could get, in 
the direction or area of assembly, within 20 
feet of a power line during the assembly/ 
disassembly process. If so, the employer must 
meet the requirements in Option (1), Option 
(2), or Option (3) of, as follows: * * * 

This provision now reads: 
Before assembling or disassembling a 

crane, the employer must determine if any 
part of the crane, load line or load (including 
rigging and lifting accessories) could get, in 
the direction or area of assembly, closer than 
20 feet to a power line during the assembly/ 
disassembly process. If so, the employer must 
meet the requirements in Option (1), Option 
(2), or Option (3) of § 1926.1407(a), as 
follows: 
Section 1412 Inspections 

The purpose of this proposed section 

is to prevent injuries and fatalities 
caused by equipment failures. A key 
method of accomplishing this goal is 
through the use of an inspection process 
that identifies and addresses safety 
concerns. 

Currently, Subpart N requires the 
employer to designate a competent 
person to inspect all machinery and 
equipment prior to each use, and during 
use, to make sure it is in safe operating 
condition. Any deficiencies shall be 
repaired, or defective parts replaced, 
before continued use. 29 CFR 
1926.550(a)(5). In addition, Subpart N 
requires a thorough annual inspection of 
the hoisting machinery by a competent 
person or by a government or private 
agency recognized by the U.S. 
Department of Labor. 29 CFR 
1926.550(a)(6). 

Subpart N also contains inspection 

requirements for specific types of 
equipment that incorporate national 
consensus standards or manufacturer 
recommendations by reference. Section 
1926.550(b)(2) requires crawler, 
locomotive, and truck cranes to meet the 
inspection requirements of ANSI B30.5– 
1968, ‘‘Crawler, Locomotive and Truck 
Cranes’’ (with a modified version of the 
ANSI standard’s monthly inspection 
documentation requirement). Overhead 
and gantry cranes, under 
§ 1926.550(d)(4), must be inspected 
pursuant to ANSI B30.2.0–1967, 
‘‘Overhead and Gantry Cranes.’’ For 
derricks, § 1926.550(e) requires 
compliance with the inspection 
requirements of ANSI B30.6–1969, 
‘‘Derricks.’’ Hammerhead tower cranes 
must be inspected (§ 1926.550(c)(5)) and 
floating cranes and derricks must be

tested (§ 1926.550(f)(2)(iii)) in 
accordance with manufacturer 
specifications. 

The Committee believed it would 

avoid confusion and promote 
compliance to establish, as far as 
possible, uniform inspection schedules 
and requirements applicable to all types 
of equipment. At the same time, it 
recognized that the wide variety of 
equipment covered by this proposed 
standard necessitated some equipment- 
specific inspection provisions. Thus, 
proposed paragraphs (a) through (j) of 
this section would set inspection 
requirements for all covered equipment 
that would be supplemented by other 
sections of this proposed standard 
relative to specific equipment. The 
proposed section is structured so that 
the inspection requirements would be 
triggered by activity (e.g., equipment 
modification, repair/adjustment, 
assembly, severe service or equipment 
not in regular use) and the passage of 
time (e.g., shift, monthly and annual/ 
comprehensive). 

Note that for each of these 

inspections, as discussed in detail 
below, this proposed standard specifies 
a requisite level of qualification of the 
person conducting the inspection (for 
certain inspections, a competent person; 
for others a qualified person). However, 
like Subpart N, the proposed rule does 
not include a testing/evaluation 
requirement for such employees for 
assessing their ability to conduct the 
inspections. 

Since the C–DAC document was 

completed, crane accidents have 
occurred that have raised concerns 
regarding the level of expertise needed 
by those who inspect the equipment 
covered by this proposed standard. In 
§ 1926.1428, this proposed rule specifies 
a protocol for ensuring that signal 
persons have adequate expertise to 
perform their duties. The Agency 
requests public comment on whether a 
similar approach is needed for those 
who inspect equipment as required by 
this proposed standard. 
Paragraph 1412(a) Modified 
Equipment 

Proposed paragraph (a) would require 
an inspection (that includes functional 
testing) to be performed by a qualified 
person for equipment that has been 
modified or has additions that affect the 
safe operation of the equipment prior to 
initial use after that modification/ 
addition. In essence, the proposed 
provision would require assurance that 
such modifications or additions are 
performed in accordance with the 
approval obtained in proposed 
§ 1926.1434, Equipment modifications. 

Proposed § 1926.1412(a)(2) would 
prohibit the use of the equipment until 
that requirement was met. The purpose 
is to prevent modification-related 
equipment failure. 

This proposed paragraph is generally 

similar to consensus and government 
standards, including ANSI B30.5–1968, 
ASME B30.5–2004, COE (Corps of 
Engineers)—EM 385–1–1 (3–Nov–03), 
and DOE (Department of Energy)—STD– 
1090–2004 in that each require an 
inspection and some degree of 
functional testing prior to using 
equipment that has been modified/ 
altered. However, the inspection in the 
proposed paragraph differs from these 
in that it is limited to equipment that 
has modifications/additions that affect 
the safe operation of the equipment and 
is limited to confirming compliance 
with modifications or additions that are 
approved by the manufacturer or a 
registered professional engineer 
pursuant to § 1434. Further, this 
proposed paragraph does not contain a 
documentation requirement. 

The Committee was of the view that 
many changes made to equipment do 
not implicate safe operation, and 
application of an inspection 
requirement to such changes would be 
unnecessary and unduly burdensome. 
The proposed paragraph reflects this 
concern and is tailored to require this 
inspection only when the modification 
is of the type that could affect safety. As 
such, the inspection would only be 
required for modifications that affect 
‘‘safe operation’’ as illustrated by a non- 
exclusive list of examples 
(‘‘modifications or additions involving a 
safety device or operator aid, critical 
part of a control system, power plant, 
braking system, load sustaining 
structural components, load hook, or in- 
use operating mechanisms’’). 

The first criterion to be used in 

conducting the inspection (proposed 
§ 1926.1412(a)(1)(i)) is the modification 
approval obtained under proposed 
§ 1926.1434. This would ensure that the 
modification was accomplished as 
intended under that approval. 

The second criterion (proposed 
§ 1926.1412(a)(1)(ii)) is functional 
testing. This reflects the Committee’s 
view that functional testing is essential 
to ensuring that the modification was 
completed correctly. Such testing can 
reveal faults that often would not 
otherwise be apparent. 

As drafted, § 1926.1412(a)(1)(ii) 

would not limit the functional testing 
requirement to only those components 
that are or may be affected by the 
modification or addition but would 
require testing of the entire equipment.

whether the provision should be 
modified to limit the functional testing 
requirement to those components that 
are or may be affected by the 
modification or addition. 

During the SBREFA process, a Small 
Entity Representative suggested adding 
an exception to proposed § 1926.1412(a) 
for ‘‘transportation systems,’’ by which 
the SER meant any system dispersing 
the weight of the crane for movement on 
the highways. The Panel recommended 
that OSHA solicit public comment on 
whether to include such an exception 
and, if so, what the appropriate 
terminology for such an exception 
would be. OSHA welcomes public 
comment on whether an explicit 
exception for such transportation 
systems should be included in 
§ 1926.1412(a). 
Paragraph 1412(b) Repaired/Adjusted 
Equipment 

Proposed paragraph (b) provides that 

equipment that has had a repair or 
adjustment that affects the safe 
operation of the equipment must be 
inspected (including functional testing) 
by a qualified person prior to initial use 
after the repair/adjustment. In summary, 
the qualified person would be required 
to determine if such repairs and 
adjustments have been performed in 
accordance with manufacturer 
equipment criteria. 

As defined in § 1926.1401, 
‘‘equipment criteria’’ include 
‘‘instructions, recommendations, 
limitations and specifications.’’ This 
definition is included to make clear that 
‘‘equipment criteria’’ is to be broadly 
construed to include the full range of 
information regarding the equipment’s 
functions and operation provided by the 
manufacturer. If those criteria were 
unavailable or inapplicable, the 
qualified person would be required to 
determine whether a registered 
professional engineer (RPE) is needed to 
develop criteria. If an RPE were not 
needed, a qualified person would be 
required to develop them. Use of the 
equipment would be prohibited until 
the inspection demonstrates that the 
repairs and adjustments met the criteria. 
The purpose of this provision is to avoid 
the failure of equipment due to 
improper repairs and adjustments. 

The Committee was of the view that 
many repairs and adjustments made to 
equipment do not implicate safe 
operation, and application of an 
inspection requirement to all repairs 
and adjustments would be unnecessary 
and unduly burdensome. The proposed 
paragraph reflects this concern by 
limiting this proposed inspection 
requirement to those repairs and

adjustments that are of the type that 
could affect safety. A non-exclusive list 
of examples of repairs and adjustments 
that would trigger the inspection is 
included in the provision. 

The Committee believed that 
functional testing is essential to 
ensuring that a repair or adjustment has 
been completed correctly. Such testing 
can reveal faults that may not otherwise 
be apparent. 

As discussed above in relation to 
proposed § 1926.1412(a)(1)(ii), the 
functional testing requirement is not 
limited to those components that are or 
may be affected by the repair or 
adjustment. OSHA requests public 
comment on whether the provision 
should be modified to add such a 
limitation. 

The Agency believes that this 

inspection provision is needed to 
prevent injuries and fatalities from 
accidents caused by faulty repairs and 
adjustments. As evidenced by similar 
provisions in other standards (see 
COE—EM 385–1–1 (3–Nov–03), and 
DOE—STD–1090–2004; see also the 
consensus standard ASME B30.5–2004), 
the industry has recognized the hazards 
associated with improperly repaired and 
adjusted equipment and the importance 
of this type of inspection. 
Paragraph 1412(c) Post-Assembly 

Proposed paragraph (c) would require 

a post-assembly inspection of 
equipment by a qualified person prior to 
its use. In sum, the provision would 
require the qualified person to assure 
that the equipment is configured in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s 
equipment criteria. Where those criteria 
are unavailable, the equipment would 
have to meet criteria developed by 
either the qualified person or an RPE 
familiar with the equipment (if the 
qualified person decides that an RPE is 
needed). Equipment use would be 
prohibited until the inspection 
demonstrates that the criteria have been 
met. 

ANSI B30.5–1968, and ASME B30.5– 

2004 do not call for this type of 
inspection. COE in EM 385–1–1 (3 Nov 
03), Appendix H, does include a post- 
assembly inspection. 

The Committee was of the view that 
a post-assembly inspection is needed 
because of the dangers associated with 
incorrectly assembled equipment. For 
example, the equipment’s load chart 
may overstate the equipment’s capacity 
if the equipment has been incorrectly 
assembled. Also, a component may be 
stressed beyond its design capacity if 
incorrectly assembled. 

The Committee considered whether to 

recommend requiring that this 

inspection be conducted by a person 
who is not only qualified but is also a 
‘‘competent person,’’ i.e., a person with 
the authority to take corrective action. 
The Committee ultimately decided that 
this would not be necessary because 
proposed § 1926.1412(c)(3) would 
prohibit the use of equipment until the 
post-assembly inspection demonstrates 
that the equipment is configured in 
accordance with the applicable criteria. 
Therefore, if the qualified person were 
to find that the equipment was 
incorrectly assembled, it could not be 
used until the error was corrected. 

Also discussed was whether a 

registered professional engineer (RPE), 
as opposed to a qualified person, is 
needed to develop the criteria for the 
equipment configuration where the 
manufacturer criteria are unavailable. 
The Committee agreed that an RPE 
would typically not be needed for, as 
one member stated, ‘‘a basic machine 
that goes together in a basic manner,’’ 
but that an RPE would be needed for 
some of the more complex types of 
equipment. As a result, the Committee 
found that it would be appropriate to 
have the qualified person determine if 
an RPE were needed to develop the 
criteria. 
Paragraph 1412(d) Each Shift 

Proposed paragraph (d) would require 

a shift inspection, the first of three 
regularly scheduled equipment 
inspections that would be required. 
Specifically, 1926.1412(d)(1) sets forth 
the frequency of this inspection, the 
degree of scrutiny required and the level 
of expertise required of the person 
performing this inspection. The 
proposed paragraph lists the items that 
would be required to be included in this 
inspection and specifies the corrective 
action that would be required. The 
purpose of this provision is to identify 
and address safety hazards before they 
cause accidents. 

This inspection (which would begin 

prior to each shift and be completed 
before or during that shift) is broadly 
similar to the current requirement in 29 
CFR 1926.550(a)(5) of Subpart N to 
conduct an inspection ‘‘prior to each 
use, and during use * * *’’ Similarly, 
several other current standards, 
including 29 CFR part 1926 subpart R 
(Steel Erection) and COE—EM 385–1–1 
(3–Nov–03) require some type of shift 
inspection for cranes. In contrast, ANSI 
B30.5–1968 as well as the more current 
ASME B30.5–2004, call for a ‘‘Frequent 
Inspection’’ at ‘‘daily to monthly’’ 
intervals. The ‘‘Frequent Inspection’’ in 
the ANSI/ASME standards, though, 
includes a reference to ‘‘observation 
during operation.’’

59768 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

The ‘‘each shift’’ inspection in the 

proposed rule is designed to ensure that 
the equipment will be removed from 
service if there is a visually apparent 
deficiency that constitutes a safety 
hazard. The Committee considered 
adopting the ‘‘daily to monthly’’ 
inspection interval that is in the ANSI/ 
ASME B30.5 consensus standard, but 
determined that that approach was too 
vague for use as a mandatory OSHA 
requirement. Instead, the Committee 
found that, in accordance with long- 
standing, common industry practice, an 
inspection of the items listed in the 
proposed paragraph each shift is an 
appropriate means of ensuring that the 
equipment’s condition will be sufficient 
for safe operation. 

The Committee also discussed 

whether the shift inspection should be 
required to be completed before a shift’s 
crane operations begin. It determined 
that it is not necessary to complete the 
inspection in that short of a time frame. 
The Agency believes that this 
determination is reasonable for several 
reasons. First, this would be an 
inspection that would be done for every 
shift, and therefore would be done quite 
frequently. This would substantially 
diminish the likelihood that a critical 
problem would suddenly occur, since 
symptoms of such a problem developing 
would likely have been detected in prior 
shift inspections. 

Second, as discussed below, one of 

the purposes of the annual/ 
comprehensive inspection is to detect 
developing deficiencies that, while not 
yet safety hazards, need to be 
monitored. In such cases the employer 
under the annual/comprehensive 
requirements in proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(4) would be required to 
monitor them in the monthly 
inspections. Finally, the competent 
person that conducts the shift 
inspection would be required to reassess 
his or her determinations in light of 
observations made during the 
equipment’s operation. The Committee 
designed these proposed requirements 
to work together, and in light of that 
combined approach, the Agency 
believes that it would be sufficient for 
the shift inspection to be completed 
during the shift. 

The Committee also discussed the 

degree of scrutiny that would be 
required during the shift inspection. 
Specifically, it considered whether the 
shift inspection should involve any 
disassembly of the equipment. It 
determined that disassembly should not 
normally be needed for this type of 
inspection since its purpose is not to 
duplicate the annual/comprehensive 
inspection (which is where the

equipment would be subjected to a level 
of scrutiny that would necessarily 
involve disassembly). Instead, 
disassembly would only be required 
where ‘‘the results of the visual 
inspection or trial operation indicate 
that further inspection necessitating 
disassembly is needed.’’ 

Finally, a competent person would be 
required to perform the shift inspection. 
The Committee believed that a person 
that meets the definition of a competent 
person (see the definition discussion 
above) is needed to perform the shift 
inspection for two reasons. First, such a 
person would have the capability to 
identify apparent deficiencies, 
determine if any disassembly was 
needed, and determine if the deficiency 
constitutes a safety hazard. Second, a 
competent person would have the 
authority necessary to take corrective 
action in the event a deficiency was 
such a hazard. 

OSHA anticipates that the equipment 

operator will often be used by the 
employer as the competent person who 
conducts the shift inspection. The 
operator will be at the site and, in most 
cases, by virtue of his or her 
qualification or certification under 
proposed §§ 1926.1427 and 1926.1430 
and experience and familiarity with the 
equipment, would meet the 
requirements for a competent person. 
However, the employer would have the 
flexibility to use someone else to 
conduct the shift inspection as long as 
that person met the definition of 
competent person. 

Proposed paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through 

(xiv) sets forth the list of items that, at 
a minimum, would be required to be 
inspected each shift. The Committee 
believes that this is an appropriate list 
for ensuring safety and builds on well 
established industry practice in terms of 
what needs to be inspected in this type 
of inspection. For example, the list is 
similar to the one for pre-shift 
inspections in 29 CFR Part 1926 subpart 
R, the list in ASME B30.5–2004 for its 
Frequent Inspection, and with the 
exception of a few additional items, to 
the list for Frequent Inspections in ANSI 
B30.5–1968. 

Overall, except as noted below in the 

discussion of the particular items on 
this list, the concerns of C–DAC 
members relative to this list focused on 
whether items not listed as ‘‘daily’’ 
inspection items but included instead in 
the ‘‘Frequent Inspection’’ list in ASME 
B30.5a–2002 (which are identical to 
those in the more recent ASME B30.5– 
2004 standard) should be inspected 
each shift. A concern was raised in the 
Committee meetings about the nature of 
the visual inspection and whether 

including all of the listed items in 
ANSI/ASME would be too burdensome. 
To address this concern, the Committee 
decided to include these items (and a 
few others) but to also include the 
language discussed above limiting the 
circumstances in which disassembly 
would be required. 

The following discussion addresses 

only those items for which the 
Committee recommended inspection 
descriptions that vary in some 
significant way from past or current 
consensus standards (apart from their 
being designated for inspection each 
shift). 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(ii) lists 
‘‘[c]ontrol and drive mechanisms for 
apparent excessive wear of components 
and contamination by lubricants, water 
or other foreign matter.’’ Though similar 
to the requirement in ANSI B30.5–1968 
and ASME B30.5–2004 (on the 
‘‘Frequent’’ list), and in 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart R, this provision reflects 
some differences. For example, unlike 
the ANSI/ASME standards (but similar 
to Subpart R), it adds ‘‘drive’’ 
mechanisms, which the Committee 
believed more accurately reflects the 
type of mechanisms that need to be 
inspected. In addition, ‘‘excessive’’ was 
added to account for the fact that some 
wear in these mechanisms is normal 
and not unsafe. The extent of wear 
needed to trigger further evaluation of 
the item is that which is apparently 
excessive. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(iii) 

addresses ‘‘[a]ir, hydraulic, and other 
pressurized lines for deterioration or 
leakage, particularly those which flex in 
normal operation.’’ This paragraph is 
similar to an item listed in ANSI 
B30.5—1968 and in ASME B30.5–2004, 
with the difference being the reference 
to ‘‘air’’ and ‘‘other pressurized lines.’’ 
These additions reflect the Committee’s 
belief that it is necessary to check all 
types of pressurized lines. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(v) lists 

‘‘[h]ooks and latches for deformation, 
cracks, excessive wear, or damage such 
as from chemicals or heat.’’ This 
substantially mirrors Subpart R, and is 
similar to ANSI B30.5–1968 and ASME 
B30.5–2004, but also differs in certain 
ways. First, the Committee believed that 
latches can be damaged by causes other 
than the examples listed. The proposed 
paragraph therefore adds the words 
‘‘such as’’ so that the examples listed 
would be a non-exclusive list. Second, 
the Committee believed that ‘‘heat’’ 
should be added as another example of 
a cause of damage to highlight this as an

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59769 

provision would require the competent 
person to inspect for ‘‘excessive wear,’’ 
as opposed to ‘‘wear.’’ This change was 
made because the Committee believed 
that hooks and latches are designed to 
withstand a degree of wear, and it is 
only when the wear is excessive that it 
is of concern. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(vii) lists 

‘‘[w]ire rope, in accordance with 
§ 1926.1413(a).’’ This item references 
the Shift Inspection provision of 
§ 1926.1413, Wire rope—inspection, 
which specifies how the wire rope 
would be required to be inspected in the 
shift inspection. As discussed below in 
the section of this Preamble on that 
proposed provision, the timing, degree 
of scrutiny, and level of expertise 
required of the person conducting the 
wire rope inspection essentially mirror 
those for proposed § 1926.1412(d)(1). 
This was done to ensure consistency 
with the wire rope inspections and the 
other general items inspected each shift. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(viii) lists 

‘‘[e]lectrical apparatus for 
malfunctioning signs of apparent 
excessive deterioration, dirt or moisture 
accumulation.’’ This essentially mirrors 
provisions in ANSI B30.5–1968 and 
ASME B30.5–2004 (for Frequent 
Inspection) and Subpart R except for the 
insertion of the word ‘‘apparent.’’ That 
word was added to be consistent with 
proposed § 1926.1412(d)(1)’s reference 
to ‘‘apparent deficiencies.’’ 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(ix) lists 

‘‘[t]ires (when in use) for proper 
inflation and condition.’’ ASME B30.5– 
2004 calls for tires be checked for 
‘‘inflation pressure’’ and Subpart R 
contains a similar provision, although it 
does not contain the ‘‘when in use’’ 
limitation. The Committee believed that 
it is unnecessary to check tires for 
proper inflation on equipment that is 
not in use. In addition, it decided to not 
include the word ‘‘pressure’’ because it 
believed that checking pressure each 
shift with a gauge is unnecessary and 
inconsistent with the visual nature of 
the shift inspection. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(x) lists 

‘‘[g]round conditions around the 
equipment for proper support, including 
ground settling under and around 
outriggers and supporting foundations, 
ground water accumulation, or similar 
conditions.’’ This item is new, in that it 
is not included in 29 CFR part 1926 
subpart N or the ANSI/ASME standards. 
The Committee believed that ground 
conditions can change from shift to 
shift, and in light of the critical 
importance of sufficient ground support, 
included this item in the C–DAC 
document. 

A nearly identical provision is 

included in 29 CFR part 1926 subpart R. 
However, the C–DAC provision differs 
from the Subpart R provision in that the 
language ‘‘and supporting foundations’’ 
was added by C–DAC to reflect that 
some cranes (particularly towers cranes) 
are set on surfaces other than ‘‘ground’’ 
(e.g., concrete) and that ground settling 
could occur ‘‘under and around’’ those 
foundations. As such, the Agency 
believes that the C–DAC language is 
appropriate in the proposed rule. It 
should also be noted that a separate 
provision, § 1926.1402, Ground 
conditions, is included in this proposed 
rule, which more specifically addresses 
responsibility for and adequacy of 
ground conditions. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(xi) lists 

‘‘[t]he equipment for level position, both 
shift and after each move and setup.’’ 
This item is not included in the ANSI/ 
ASME standards; however, it mirrors 
the language of the similar pre-shift 
inspection in Subpart R. The Committee 
found that, as with ground conditions, 
maintaining the equipment’s level 
position is essential for its safe 
operation. Since factors affecting the 
equipment’s angle of inclination can 
change from shift to shift (such as 
compression of dunnage, ground 
settling from freeze/thaw conditions and 
ground compression), the Committee 
believed that it is necessary to include 
this in the shift inspection. 

The SBREFA Panel recommended 

that OSHA solicit public comment 
about whether it is necessary to clarify 
the requirement of proposed 
§ 1926.1412(d)(1)(xi) that the equipment 
be inspected for ‘‘level position’’ by 
clarifying the amount of tolerance that 
would be allowed for the equipment to 
be considered ‘‘level.’’ The Agency 
requests public comment on this issue. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(xii) lists 

‘‘[o]perator cab windows for significant 
cracks, breaks, or other deficiencies that 
would hamper the operator’s view.’’ 32 
The purpose of this proposed provision 
is to ensure adequate visibility. The 
Committee believed that it is important 
to ensure that the windows’ condition 
does not hamper the operator’s view. 
Since a significant crack, break or other 
defect hampering the operator’s view 
may occur during a shift, it believed that 
this item needs to be included in the 
shift inspection. The inclusion of the 
words ‘‘significant’’ and ‘‘hamper the 
operator’s view’’ were to clarify that 
minor deficiencies that do not 

32 Currently, 29 CFR Part 1926 Subpart N contains 

a requirement specifying that the type of glazing in 
cabs must not cause ‘‘a visible distortion.’’ 

materially impair the operator’s view 
are not considered safety hazards. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(xiii) lists 

‘‘[r]ails, rail stops, rail clamps and 
supporting surfaces when the 
equipment has rail traveling.’’ This item 
is not specifically listed as an inspection 
item in the pre-shift inspections of 
Subpart R or in the Frequent Inspections 
of the 1968 or 2004 ANSI/ASME B30.5 
standards. However, they are included 
because of the essential role they play 
in the holding and emergency stopping 
of rail mounted equipment. Their 
importance to safe operation is similarly 
recognized by their inclusion in 
proposed § 1926.1415, Safety Devices, 
as safety devices that must be working 
properly for crane operations to 
continue. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(xiv) lists 
‘‘[s]afety devices and operational aids 
for proper operation.’’ Subpart N, 
through its incorporation by reference of 
ANSI B30.5–1968, includes a daily 
inspection of safety devices for 
malfunction for the equipment it covers, 
while ASME B30.5–2004 requires a 
daily inspection of operational aids for 
malfunction. Finally, Subpart R 
includes a nonexclusive list of safety 
devices in its pre-shift inspection. The 
equipment’s safety devices and 
operational aids would be included 
because of their important role in 
assisting the operator in the safe 
operation of equipment. 

Concern was raised in Committee 

about including this item because the 
industry did not have clear, consistent 
definitions for terms ‘‘safety devices’’ 
and ‘‘operational aids.’’ This concern 
was addressed by referencing the lists of 
devices for each of these terms in 
proposed § 1926.1415, Safety devices 
and § 1926.1416, Operational aids. 

The language also reflects the 

Committee’s view that the inspection of 
these devices and aids is more 
accurately described as an inspection 
for ‘‘proper operation’’ rather than for 
‘‘malfunction.’’ The Committee 
considered this a more accurate 
description because the person 
conducting the inspection does so by 
checking the safety device or 
operational aid for proper operation. If 
it is found to be working properly, the 
inspection is finished. 

Another concern was including both 
safety devices and operational aids in 
this provision, since many members 
were of the view that these two 
categories of devices necessitate 
different levels and types of action 
when a deficiency is found. That 
concern was addressed by specifying in 
proposed § 1926.1412(d)(3) that if a 
deficiency is found, the action that

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

would be required in response would be 
the actions delineated in proposed 
§ 1926.1415, Safety devices and 
§ 1926.1416, Operational aids, which 
address these two categories differently. 
See additional discussions of these 
procedures in §§ 1926.1415 and 
1926.1416 of this explanation of the 
rule. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2) would 

establish the follow-up actions to the 
identification of apparent deficiencies 
during the shift inspection that would 
be required. Specifically, under 
proposed 1926.1412(d)(2), immediately 
following the discovery of any 
deficiency identified pursuant to 
proposed § 1926.1412(d)(1)(i) through 
(xiii), or pursuant to other equipment- 
specific inspections (e.g., see proposed 
§ 1926.1436(p) (inspection of derricks), 
the competent person must determine 
whether the deficiency is a safety 
hazard. If so, equipment operations 
must cease until it has been corrected. 
The correction procedure described in 
proposed § 1926.1412(d)(2) is similar to 
that in ANSI B30.5–1968 and ASME 
B30.5–2004 for their Frequent 
Inspections. 

This approach reflects the 

Committee’s determination that not all 
deficiencies constitute safety hazards. 
The proposed language in 
§ 1926.1412(d)(2) reflects that approach 
by linking the requirement for removing 
the equipment from service to 
deficiencies that constitute safety 
hazards. The provision is designed to 
ensure that this determination is made 
appropriately by requiring that it be 
made by a competent person. The 
competent person would have the 
capability necessary to make an accurate 
determination. In addition, requiring a 
competent person to make the 
determination would ensure that his or 
her findings were implemented; i.e., the 
competent person would have the 
authority to order the equipment out of 
service if the deficiency constituted a 
hazard. The Agency believes that this 
would be an appropriate means of 
protecting employees from equipment 
with deficiencies that constitute safety 
hazards. 

The SBREFA Panel recommended 

that OSHA solicit public comment on 
whether, and under what 
circumstances, booming down should 
be specifically excluded as a part of the 
shift inspection, and whether the 
removal of non-hinged inspection plates 
should be required during the shift 
inspection. Proposed § 1926.1413(a)(1), 
discussed below, explicitly states that 
booming down is not required as part of 
the shift inspection for wire rope. It is 
the Agency’s understanding that C–DAC 

did not include a similar provision in 
the general shift inspection provision in 
proposed § 1926.1412(d) because 
booming down would not be required to 
observe a deficiency in any of the items 
requiring inspection under that 
paragraph. Similarly, OSHA does not 
believe that inspection for a deficiency 
in any of those items would require 
removal of non-hinged inspection 
plates. However, OSHA welcomes 
public comment on these points. 
Paragraph 1412(e) Monthly 

Proposed paragraph (e) would require 
a monthly inspection of the equipment, 
the second of the three regularly 
scheduled general inspections that 
would be required by this proposed 
standard. The monthly inspection is 
identical in coverage and manner to the 
shift inspection required by proposed 
§ 1926.1412(d), with one addition 
discussed below. Thus, the monthly 
inspection would be a visual inspection 
of the items listed in the shift inspection 
for apparent deficiencies, conducted by 
a competent person. However, unlike a 
shift inspection, a written record of the 
monthly inspection is proposed to be 
kept and retained for at least 3 months. 

In addition, under the annual/ 

comprehensive inspection in proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(4), the employer would 
be required to identify developing 
deficiencies that, while not yet safety 
hazards, need to be monitored. In such 
cases the employer under proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(4) and (f)(6) would be 
required to monitor them in the 
monthly inspections. 

This provision differs in some ways 

from the current requirement in 29 CFR 
part 1926 Subpart N that incorporates 
by reference ANSI B30.5–1968 and from 
ASME B30.5–2004. For example, rather 
than a monthly inspection, these 
industry standards call for a ‘‘Frequent’’ 
inspection to be done at ‘‘daily to 
monthly’’ intervals. The Committee 
believed that the proposed approach is 
an improvement over the ANSI/ASME 
approach by eliminating ambiguity over 
the frequency of inspections. Also, the 
consensus standards do not call for the 
monitoring of developing deficiencies, a 
change the Committee believed would 
lead to the elimination of hazards before 
they develop. However, many of the 
items listed in those consensus 
standards for frequent inspections are 
similar to those listed in the shift and 
monthly inspections of the proposed 
rule (See discussion of items inspected 
under proposed paragraphs (d)(1)(i) 
through (xiv) for comparison). 

Proposed paragraph (e)(3) would 

establish a documentation requirement 
for this monthly inspection. 

Specifically, proposed 
§ 1926.1412(e)(3)(i) would require that 
the inspection ‘‘be documented by the 
employer that conducts the inspection’’ 
and indicate the items checked with 
results, the name and signature of the 
person of the inspector, and the date. In 
these respects this proposed 
requirement is similar to that currently 
in effect under § 1926.550(b)(2) of 29 
CFR part 1926 Subpart N for crawler, 
locomotive, and truck cranes. Proposed 
§ 1926.1412(e)(3)(ii) would establish a 
minimum three-month retention period 
for the monthly inspection 
documentation. 

These two proposed provisions have 

several purposes. The Committee 
believed that, on a monthly basis, it is 
necessary to record the items checked 
and the results of an inspection that for 
the most part parallels a shift 
inspection. It believed that the 
documentation of this inspection, 
signed by the person who conducted the 
inspection and retained for three 
months, would have several effects. 
First, it would increase the likelihood 
that more employers would implement 
systems for conducting and responding 
to inspections. The failure to do so 
would be more readily apparent if a 
record were not made, and the signature 
of the person who conducted the 
inspection would be an inducement to 
that person to ensure that the inspection 
was done correctly. Second, it would 
create a record that the employer could 
use to help track developing problems 
so that they could be corrected in time 
to assure continued safe operation of the 
equipment. 

The Agency notes that the proposed 

three month retention period also 
reflects a desire of the Committee to 
have a retention period that is 
consistent with Department of 
Transportation (‘‘DOT’’) truck 
inspection documentation requirements. 
Also, proposed § 1926.1412(e)(3) 
parallels the monthly inspection for 
wire rope in proposed paragraph 
1413(b) in terms of timing, level of 
scrutiny, expertise of the inspector, and 
documentation. 

The SBREFA Panel recommended 

that OSHA solicit public comment on 
whether the provision for monthly 
inspections should, like the provision 
for annual inspections, specify who 
must keep the documentation associated 
with monthly inspections. (The 
provision for annual inspections states 
that the documentation must be 
‘‘maintained by the employer who 
conducts the inspection.’’) OSHA 
requests public comment on the issue 
raised by the Panel’s recommendation.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59771 

The SBREFA Panel also 

recommended that OSHA restate the 
corrective action provisions from the 
shift inspection (proposed 
§ 1926.1412(d)(2) and (3)) in proposed 
§ 1926.1412(e). Under proposed 
§ 1926.1412(e)(1), the monthly 
inspection must be conducted in 
accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1412(d) on shift inspections, and 
this means that the corrective action 
provisions in proposed 
§ 1926.1412(d)(2) and (3) must also be 
followed in the monthly inspections. 
OSHA requests comment on whether 
the language in proposed 
§ 1926.1412(d)(2) and (3) should be 
repeated under proposed § 1926.1412(e). 
Paragraph (f) Annual/Comprehensive 
Proposed paragraph (f) would require 

an annual (i.e., once every twelve 
months), general inspection of the 
equipment, the third of the three 
regularly scheduled general inspections 
that would be required by this proposed 
standard. It would promote safety by 
ensuring that a thorough, 
comprehensive inspection of the 
equipment is performed to detect and 
address deficiencies that might not be 
detected in the proposed shift and 
monthly inspections. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(1) would 

require that a qualified person inspect 
the equipment, at least every 12 months, 
in accordance with § 1926.1412(d) (shift 
inspections). The Committee’s intent 
was to have the items specified in the 
shift inspection examined more 
thoroughly, by a qualified person, on an 
annual basis. This would ensure that 
deficiencies necessitating a greater 
degree of scrutiny than what would be 
required in the shift inspection (such as 
a deficiency that is not apparent in a 
visual inspection but is detectable 
through disassembly), and a greater 
degree of expertise to detect, would be 
discovered. 

The Committee believed that, in light 
of this need for greater scrutiny, a higher 
level of expertise is needed of the 
person conducting the inspection than 
is currently required for the annual 
inspection in 29 CFR part 1926 Subpart 
N (Subpart N, at § 1926.550(a)(6), 
requires that it be conducted by a 
competent person). The Committee’s 
view is similar to that reflected in COE– 
EM 385–1–1 (3 Nov 03) and ASME 
B30.5–2004, both of which call for a 
qualified person to perform those 
standards’ ‘‘periodic’’ inspections. The 
Agency believes that, to effectuate the 
purpose of the proposed annual/ 
comprehensive inspection, a qualified 
person would be needed to conduct this 
inspection.

The Agency notes that neither this 

paragraph nor the subsequent 
paragraphs under proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f) specify the level of 
scrutiny that would be required for the 
annual/comprehensive inspection. As it 
is the Agency’s understanding that it 
was the Committee’s belief that this 
inspection needs to be more thorough 
than a visual inspection for apparent 
deficiencies, OSHA solicits comments 
from the public as to whether language 
specifying a higher level of scrutiny (for 
example, ‘‘thorough, including 
disassembly when necessary’’) should 
be added. 

In terms of timing, this proposed 

annual/comprehensive inspection is 
essentially the same as currently 
specified in Subpart N, which requires 
an ‘‘annual’’ inspection. 

The requirement that the inspection 
be conducted at least every 12 months 
means that an inspection must be 
conducted on or before the anniversary 
date of the last annual inspection. A 
situation that may arise is where the 
equipment is not in service on the 
anniversary date. In that situation, since 
the equipment is not in service, the 
annual inspection would not have to be 
done at that point. However, the 
equipment could not be put back into 
service until the annual inspection had 
been done.33 

As discussed below, proposed 

§ 1926.1412(f)(4)–(f)(6) contain specific 
proposed responsive actions in the 
event a deficiency is discovered in the 
annual/comprehensive inspection. C– 
DAC recommended that proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(1) state that ‘‘ * * * the 
equipment shall be inspected * * * in 
accordance with paragraph (d) (shift 
inspections).’’ Read literally, the C–DAC 
language would have required the 
employer to comply with the responsive 
actions specified for the shift 
inspections in proposed § 1926.1412(d). 
However, the specified responsive 
actions for the proposed shift inspection 
differ from those proposed for the 
annual/comprehensive inspection. 
Therefore, the Agency modified the C– 
DAC language for proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(1) to make it clear that 
the responsive actions that would be 
required if a deficiency were found 
under § 1926.1412(f)(1) are those 
specified in proposed § 1926.1412(f)(4)– 

33 Note that, under proposed § 1926.1412(h), 

discussed below, equipment that has been out of 
regular service for three months or more must 
receive a monthly inspection before being returned 
to service. However, if the equipment had been out 
of regular service for more than three months but 
it was due for its annual inspection, the annual 
inspection would have to be done and there would 
therefore be no need to also do the § 1926.1412(h) 
(out of regular service) inspection. 

(f)(6). This has been done by adding the 
following language to the C–DAC (f)(1) 
provision: 

At least every 12 months the equipment 
shall be inspected by a qualified person in 
accordance with paragraph (d) (shift 
inspections) of this section, except that the 
corrective action set forth in Paragraph (f) 
Annual/comprehensive, of this section shall 
apply. 

The difference is that while both 

require that the equipment be removed 
from service if safety hazards are 
identified, paragraphs (f)(4) through 
(f)(6) also provide that a deficiency that 
might, but has not yet, reached the 
safety hazard stage must be monitored 
on a monthly basis. (Also, the 
determinations in § 1926.1412(f)(4) 
through (f)(6) are made by a qualified 
person, whereas the determinations in 
the shift inspection are made by a 
competent person.) 

Proposed paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through 
(xxi) supplement the list of inspection 
items in proposed § 1926.1412(f)(1) that 
would be required to be inspected in the 
annual/comprehensive inspection. The 
Committee developed this list based on 
the members’ experience and current 
industry practice as reflected in current 
consensus standards for annual/periodic 
inspections. The Committee believed 
that each item plays an important role 
in the safe operation of equipment. 
The list in proposed paragraphs 

(f)(2)(i) through (xxi) differs somewhat 
from those in consensus standards. 
Among other differences, the list in 
these proposed paragraphs is more user- 
friendly to the employer and qualified 
person because the item inspected is at 
the beginning of each sentence. Also, 
some items not in consensus standards 
are included because, as discussed 
below, in the view of the Committee, 
they also have a significant effect on the 
safe operation of equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(i) lists 

‘‘[e]quipment structure (including the 
boom and, if equipped, the jib),’’ 
including ‘‘(A) Structural members: 
deformed, cracked, or significantly 
corroded. (B) Bolts, rivets and other 
fasteners: loose, failed or significantly 
corroded. (C) Welds for cracks.’’ 
Differences with similar items listed in 
ANSI B30.5–1968, ASME B30.5–2004 
and COE–EM 385–1–1 (3 Nov 03) are as 
follows: ‘‘Welds for cracks’’ was added 
to better ensure that the equipment is 
structurally sound; ‘‘Other fasteners’’ 
was added to ‘‘bolts and rivets’’ 
(referenced in the ANSI/ASME 
standards) because there are now other 
types of fasteners which also need to be 
inspected to ensure they are not loose, 
failed or significantly corroded; and 
‘‘significantly’’ was added to describe

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

the degree of corrosion on a structural 
member or fastener needed to trigger 
further examination because some 
corrosion on those items is normal and 
has no effect on safety. 

Proposed paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) through 
(iv) list: ‘‘[s]heaves and drums for cracks 
or significant wear;’’ ‘‘[p]arts such as 
pins, bearings, shafts, gears, rollers and 
locking devices for distortion, cracks or 
significant wear;’’ and ‘‘[b]rake and 
clutch system parts, linings, pawls and 
ratchets for excessive wear.’’ These 
items are similar to the items currently 
listed in the Periodic Inspection 
(monthly to twelve month intervals) in 
ANSI B30.5–1968 and ASME B30.5– 
2004. The Committee believed that 
these items, as reflected in their 
inclusion in current consensus 
standards, need to be checked in an 
annual inspection to ensure the safe 
operation of the equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(v) lists 

‘‘[s]afety devices and operational aids 
for proper operation (including 
significant inaccuracies).’’ The 
Committee included the term 
‘‘significant inaccuracies’’ in recognition 
of the fact that such devices normally 
operate within a tolerance range. 
Corrective action would not be required 
if the inaccuracy is so small as to be 
irrelevant with regards to the safe 
operation of the equipment. In contrast, 
significant inaccuracies in these devices 
could mislead the operator and 
contribute to actions that could result in 
the equipment being inadvertently used 
in an unsafe manner. Consequently, the 
Committee believed that these devices 
and aids need to be inspected for both 
proper operation and significant 
inaccuracies. 

This provision is broader than similar 
provisions in the ANSI and ANSI/ASME 
standards. Specifically, ANSI B30.5– 
1968 only addresses ‘‘safety devices for 
malfunction’’ (the Periodic Inspection 
includes the items listed in the Frequent 
Inspection) while the Periodic 
Inspection for ASME B30.5–2004 only 
includes operational aids. 

Another significant difference 

between this paragraph and the ASME 
standard is the follow-up action 
required subsequent to the discovery of 
a deficiency involving operational aids. 
Under this paragraph, the discovery of 
such a deficiency that is determined to 
be a safety hazard would require the 
equipment to be removed from service 
until the safety hazard is corrected. In 
contrast, under the 2004 ASME 
standard, alternatives to the removal of 
equipment from service are available.34 

34 Section 5–3.2.1.2 of the ASME standard allows 
the employer to follow the recommendations of the

Proposed § 1926.1416 would permit 
equipment with operational aids that 
are not functioning properly to continue 
to be used with specified alternative 
measures in place. Proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d) and (e) would set time 
limits for such use. It is the Agency’s 
understanding that the Committee 
intended that this same approach 
should apply with respect to the follow- 
up action required when an operational 
aid is found in the annual inspection to 
be not working properly. In other words, 
the equipment could be returned to 
service but the time limits in proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d) and (e) would apply, as 
would the alternative measures 
requirements. 

Proposed § 1926.1412(f) does not 

explicitly describe how the follow-up 
measures in proposed § 1926.1412(f)(4)– 
(f)(6) would apply to operational aids. 
As explained below in the discussion of 
proposed § 1926.1412(f)(4)–(f)(6), the 
Agency believes that it would be 
appropriate to add language to clarify 
that the follow-up action required when 
an operational aid is found in the 
annual inspection to be not working 
properly is the action specified in 
proposed § 1926.1416(d) and (e). 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(vi) lists 
‘‘[g]asoline, diesel, electric, or other 
power plants for safety-related problems 
(such as leaking exhaust and emergency 
shut-down feature), conditions and 
proper operation.’’ This proposed 
provision was derived from ANSI 
B30.5–1968 and ASME B30.5–2004 and 
reworded to emphasize and limit its 
application to safety related issues, and 
to include examples to better 
communicate those concepts. Leaking 
exhaust was included as an example 
because it could asphyxiate an 
employee. The emergency shut-down 
feature was added as an example 
because a failure of this feature could 
result in an employee being struck by a 
suspended load. 

Proposed paragraphs (f)(2)(vii), (viii) 
and (ix) list ‘‘[c]hains and chain drive 
sprockets for excessive wear of 
sprockets and excessive chain stretch,’’ 
‘‘[t]ravel steering, brakes, and locking 
devices, for proper operation,’’ and 
‘‘[t]ires for damage or excessive wear.’’ 
These proposed provisions were derived 
from ANSI B30.5–1968 and ASME 
B30.5–2004. The Committee believed 
that these items, as their presence in 
these industry standards reflects, play a 

manufacturer of the equipment or device for 
continued operation or shutdown of the equipment. 
The same section of the ASME standard also sets 
forth alternative precautions, which may be taken 
unless the manufacturer specifies otherwise, when 
specific operational aids malfunction. 

significant role in the safe operation of 
equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(x) lists 
‘‘[h]ydraulic, pneumatic and other 
pressurized hoses, fittings and tubing, as 
follows: (A) Flexible hose or its junction 
with the fittings for indications of leaks. 
(B) Threaded or clamped joints for 
leaks. (C) Outer covering of the hose for 
blistering, abnormal deformation or 
other signs of failure/impending failure. 
(D) Outer surface of a hose, rigid tube, 
or fitting for indications of excessive 
abrasion or scrubbing.’’ The purpose of 
this proposed paragraph, as noted 
during C–DAC meetings, is to ‘‘call 
attention to specific parts of these 
hoses’’ and thus prevent the failure of 
mechanisms, such as the brakes, hoist 
mechanisms and limit switches, that are 
powered or affected by the movement of 
fluids or air through the equipment’s 
system of hoses. 

Neither the general provisions in 29 

CFR part 1926 Subpart N nor the 
provisions in ANSI B30.5–1968 that are 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N 
contain a specific requirement for an 
inspection of these hoses, fittings and 
tubing. However, several more recent 
consensus and government standards do 
contain similar items in their annual/ 
Periodic inspections. ASME B30.5– 
2004, COE–EM 385–1–1 (3 Nov 03) and 
DOE STD 1090–2004 all contain some 
form of this item in their Periodic 
inspection provisions. 

The Committee’s discussion of this 

item focused on whether language used 
in ASME B30.5–2004 should be 
adopted. For example, the meaning of 
the reference in the ASME standard to 
‘‘metal and couplings’’ as one of the 
points of concern on a hose for leakage 
was questioned. The Committee sought 
to be clearer by referencing ‘‘fittings’’ 
instead in proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(2)(x)(A). 

Also, members questioned the 

appropriateness of the ASME language 
on inspecting for hose leakage that 
specifies leakage from threaded or 
clamped joints that is not eliminated by 
‘‘recommended procedures.’’ Since the 
use of such procedures to correct a leak 
is in the nature of a repair, the concept 
of limiting the inspection item in this 
manner was rejected. 

Proposed paragraphs (f)(2)(xi)–(xiii) 
list a series of items that, like (f)(2)(x), 
focus on specific parts of hydraulic and 
pneumatic power systems. They would 
be included for the same reason—to 
better ensure that those parts of the 
equipment driven by hydraulic and 
pneumatic power do not fail. These 
provisions address: ‘‘(xi) [h]ydraulic and 
pneumatic pumps and motors, as 
follows: (A) Performance indicators:

the fluid, low pressure. (B) Loose bolts 
or fasteners. (C) Shaft seals and joints

‘‘[h]ydraulic and pneumatic valves, as 
follows: (A) Spools: sticking, improper 
return to neutral, and leaks. (B) Leaks. 
(C) Valve housing cracks. (D) Relief 
valves: failure to reach correct pressure 
(if there is a manufacturer procedure for 
checking pressure, it must be

Drifting caused by fluid leaking across 
the piston. (B) Rod seals and welded 
joints for leaks. (C) Cylinder rods for 
scores, nicks or dents. (D) Case (barrel) 
for significant dents. (E) Rod eyes and 
connecting joints: loose or deformed.’’ 
As with proposed paragraph (f)(2)(x), 
these items are not explicitly mentioned 
in Subpart N. Neither the Subpart itself 
nor the incorporated ‘‘Periodic’’ 
inspection in ANSI B30.5–1968 
specifically references these items. 
However, ASME B30.5–2004, COE–EM 
385–1–1 (3 Nov 03) and DOE STD 1090– 
2004 each require inspection of these 
items by language with varying degrees 
of specificity. 

While discussing these items, C–DAC 

members decided not to include the 
inspection of hydraulic filters that are 
included in ASME B30.5–2004 because, 
as a Committee member who works for 
a manufacturer noted, the condition of 
these filters is a maintenance rather than 
a safety issue. Other discussion related 
to several of the items in this list. In 
proposed § 1926.1412(f)(2)(xi)(C), 
‘‘pump’’ was inserted to clarify which 
joints must be inspected for leaks. 
Further, ‘‘significant’’ was added to 
describe the dents subject to inspection 
under proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(2)(xiii)(D) because some 
dents on cases do not affect operation. 

The Committee believed that these 

items, as their presence in these 
government and consensus standards 
reflects, play a significant role in the 
safe operation of equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(xiv) lists 
‘‘[o]utrigger pads/floats’’ for excessive 
wear or cracks.’’ The purpose of the 
inspection of outrigger pads/floats is to 
make certain that these pads (which are 
attached to the outrigger and used to 
distribute the weight of the load to the 
ground) will not fail and leave the 
outrigger without proper support. 
This item is not included in the 
annual inspection of Subpart N for 
cranes and derricks, the periodic 
inspections of ANSI B30.5–1968 or 
ASME B30.5–2004. However, the 
Periodic (yearly) inspection in COE–EM 
385–1–1 (3 Nov 03) may cover

‘‘outrigger pads/floats’’ with its general 
provision regarding ‘‘foundation or 
supports.’’ The Committee similarly 
included this item because it believed 
that it plays a significant role in the safe 
operation of equipment. 

Paragraph (f)(2)(xv) lists ‘‘slider pads 

for excessive wear or cracks.’’ Slider 
pads (which are used to guide sections 
of equipment such as the boom 
extension on a hydraulic crane) are 
included because excessive wear may 
cause the equipment to fail. The 
Committee was aware that some 
disassembly may be required to inspect 
slider pads. 

This item is not included in the 
annual inspection of Subpart N for 
cranes and derricks or the periodic 
inspections of ANSI B30.5–1968 or 
ASME B30.5–2004. However, the 
Committee included this item because 
of its role in the safe operation of the 
equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(xvi) lists 

‘‘[e]lectrical components and wiring for 
cracked or split insulation and loose or 
corroded terminations.’’ Wires are not 
listed in the annual/Periodic inspection 
in Subpart N, ANSI B30.5–1968, ASME 
B30.5—2004 or COE–EM 385–1–1 (3 
Nov 03). The purpose of this proposed 
provision is to prevent hazards related 
to deficiencies in electrical components 
and wiring. Since such deficiencies may 
cause a fire or the malfunction of safety 
related systems, the Agency believes 
that the inclusion of electrical 
components as well as wiring in the 
inspection list is necessary. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(xvii) lists 
‘‘[w]arning labels and decals originally 
supplied with the equipment by the 
manufacturer or otherwise required 
under this standard: missing or 
unreadable.’’ The annual/Periodic 
inspection in COE–EM 385–1–1 (3– 
NovJan 03) contains a similar 
requirement relative to ‘‘safety and 
function labels for legibility and 
replacement.’’ However, this item is not 
included in the annual/Periodic 
inspections included in Subpart N, 
ANSI B30.5–1968 or ASME B30.5–2004. 
The Committee believed that warning 
decals that would be required under this 
proposed standard (either by virtue of a 
specific provision in this proposed 
standard, e.g., paragraph 1407(g), or 
because they were originally supplied 
by the manufacturer with the 
equipment, see § 1926.1433(e)(5), Posted 
warnings) provide important safety 
reminders and information. As such, it 
was of the view that they need to be 
maintained in order for them to 
continue to alert users to those safety 
concerns. The Agency modified the C– 
DAC language for proposed paragraph 

(f)(2)(xvii) so that it would cover 
warning labels and decals originally 
supplied by the manufacturer and thus 
better reflect the Committee’s intent as 
indicated by proposed § 1926.1433(e)(5). 

Proposed paragraphs (f)(2)(xviii–xxi) 
list: ‘‘Originally equipped operator seat: 
missing;’’ ‘‘Operator seat: unusable;’’ 35 
‘‘Originally equipped steps, ladders, 
handrails, guards: missing;’’ and ‘‘Steps, 
ladders, handrails, guards: in unusable/ 
unsafe condition.’’ These are not 
included in the annual/periodic 
inspections of ANSI B30.5–1968, ASME 
B30.5–2004, or COE–EM 385–1–1 (3 
Nov 03). 

The Committee believed that these are 

safety related items that need to be 
inspected. For example, if the operator 
seat is unusable, the likelihood of the 
operator manipulating a control in an 
inadvertent manner or being unable to 
reach a control is increased. The other 
items relate to preventing falls and 
contact with exposed parts that are 
moving or otherwise dangerous. It 
should be noted that, among others, 
proposed § 1926.1433, Design, 
construction and testing, and 
§ 1926.1426, Fall protection, would 
include requirements related to several 
of these items. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(3) would 

require functional testing as part of the 
annual/comprehensive inspection. A 
general functional testing requirement is 
not included in the annual/periodic 
inspection in COE–EM 385–1–1 (3 Nov 
03), although it does require functional 
testing for certain items, such as ‘‘crane 
function operating mechanisms,’’ and 
‘‘operator aids (safety devices) and 
indicating devices.’’ Similarly, the 
annual/periodic inspection provisions 
of ANSI B30.5–1968 (incorporated by 
reference into Subpart N) and ASME 
B30.5–2004, imply a functional testing 
requirement with regard to several 
specific items (e.g., in B30.5–1968 and 
in B30.5–2004), ‘‘[t]ravel steering, 
braking, and locking devices, for 
malfunction’’). 

The purpose of this testing is to 

ensure that the equipment as configured 
in the inspection is functioning 
properly. It was the Committee’s belief 
that, without functional testing, the 
inspection may not reveal some safety 
problems. 

The proposed provision reflects the 

Committee’s belief that functional 
testing should be limited to the 
equipment ‘‘as configured in the 

35 The original C–DAC language provided: 
‘‘Operator seat: missing or unusable.’’ OSHA 
modified this language to avoid the implication that 
equipment that did not include an operator seat as 
original equipment would, contrary to C–DAC’s 
intent, nevertheless need to have a seat installed.

inspection.’’ In its view, functional 
testing in all possible configurations, 
with all possible attachments, is 
unnecessary and would be unduly 
burdensome. In light of the 
comprehensive nature of the inspection 
that would result from compliance with 
the proposed annual/comprehensive 
inspection provision, the Agency 
believes that this limitation would not 
adversely affect safety. 

Proposed paragraphs (f)(4) through (6) 
delineate the follow-up procedures that 
would apply when a deficiency is 
identified during the annual/ 
comprehensive inspection. The purpose 
of these provisions is to ensure that a 
deficiency that is not yet a safety hazard 
but may develop into one is monitored 
on a monthly basis, and that a 
deficiency that is a safety hazard is 
corrected before the equipment is 
returned to service. 

Specifically, proposed paragraph (f)(4) 
provides that immediately following the 
identification of a deficiency, the 
qualified person must determine 
‘‘whether the deficiency constitutes a 
safety hazard, or though not yet a safety 
hazard, needs to be monitored in the 
monthly inspections.’’ Proposed 
paragraph (f)(5) would require that 
equipment with a deficiency identified 
as a safety hazard by the qualified 
person be removed from service until 
the deficiency is corrected. Proposed 
paragraph (f)(6) would require the 
employer to check in the monthly 
inspections the deficiencies that the 
qualified person had identified as 
needing monitoring. 

The corrective procedures in 

proposed paragraphs (f)(4) through (f)(6) 
are similar to those in ANSI B30.5–1968 
and ASME B30.5–2004 in that the 
ANSI/ASME provisions also call for 
equipment operation to cease upon 
discovery of a safety hazard. They differ 
in that the ANSI/ASME provisions have 
no procedures for monitoring 
deficiencies that are not yet safety 
hazards. 

The Committee believed that this 

would be an effective means of ensuring 
that employers respond appropriately to 
deficiencies identified in the annual/ 
comprehensive inspection. In addition, 
the Committee’s addition of a 
mechanism for monthly monitoring, 
where needed, of deficiencies that have 
not yet developed into safety hazards 
would ensure that developing hazards 
are caught before they endanger 
employees. 

Upon reviewing these proposed 

provisions, OSHA believes that C–DAC 
inadvertently omitted a reference in the 
proposed provisions for annual/ 
comprehensive inspections to special

corrective action procedures for 
operational aids. This issue is explained 
below. 

Proposed § 1926.1416, Operational 
aids, sets out requirements that would 
apply where an operational aid is not 
working properly. Specifically, it would 
allow equipment with an operational 
aid that is not working to continue to be 
operated for a limited time as long as 
certain temporary protective measures 
are used. 

In a shift or monthly inspection, as 

reflected in proposed § 1926.1412(d)(3), 
if a deficiency in an operational aid is 
identified, the corrective action 
described in proposed § 1926.1416 
would apply. In contrast, in the 
proposed paragraph on annual/ 
comprehensive inspections 
(§ 1926.1412(f)), C–DAC did not include 
a similar reference. 

If the corrective actions described in 

proposed § 1926.1416 did not apply and 
an operational aid were found to be not 
working properly in an annual/ 
comprehensive inspection, the qualified 
person would have to determine if that 
constituted a safety hazard. If he or she 
concluded that it was a safety hazard, 
the equipment would have to be 
removed from service immediately until 
the aid was repaired. OSHA believes 
that such a result would be contrary to 
C–DAC’s intent, since the issue of the 
extent to which an operational aid 
needed to be repaired was 
comprehensively dealt with in proposed 
§ 1926.1416. 

In sum, the Agency believes that 
proposed § 1926.1412(f) should be 
modified to specifically make the 
corrective actions in proposed 
§ 1926.1416 applicable. OSHA requests 
public comment on this issue. 

The Committee considered whether 
the monitoring aspect of this proposed 
requirement would unduly add to the 
employer’s paperwork burden. The 
Committee determined that it would 
not, since all that would be involved 
would be a notation on the employer’s 
monthly inspection form to pay special 
attention to the item and then note its 
condition. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(7), 

Documentation of annual/ 
comprehensive inspection, would 
require the employer that conducts the 
inspection to complete and maintain, 
for a minimum of twelve months, 
documentation that contains ‘‘[t]he 
items checked and the results of the 
inspection,’’ and ‘‘[t]he name and 
signature of the person who conducted 
the inspection and the date.’’ Note that 
proposed § 1926.1413(c)(4), which 
pertains to the annual/comprehensive 

wire rope inspection, contains a similar 
documentation requirement. 

This proposed documentation 

requirement differs in several respects 
from Subpart N and other current 
consensus standards. For example, 
Subpart N at 29 CFR 1926.550(a)(6), has 
an open-ended retention period and 
does not include a signature 
requirement or a requirement that the 
inspector be named. It also differs from 
the periodic inspection in ASME B30.5– 
2004 that only calls for ‘‘dated records’’ 
for specific, critical items, does not 
specify that the inspector’s name be 
listed, and does not specify a retention 
period. 

The Committee believed that the 
proposed provision would promote 
safety by ensuring that the items 
checked and the inspection results are 
documented and maintained for at least 
12 months. This would ensure that past 
deficiencies and potential hazards 
associated with the equipment can be 
tracked. In the Committee’s view this 
information would help the qualified 
person assess the equipment in the 
subsequent annual/ comprehensive 
inspection. 

The Committee believed that the 
documentation of this inspection, 
signed by the person who conducted the 
inspection and retained for 12 months, 
would have several effects. First, it 
would increase the likelihood that more 
employers would implement systems 
for conducting and responding to 
inspections. The failure to do so would 
be more readily apparent if a record was 
not made, and the signature of the 
person who conducted the inspection 
would be an inducement to that person 
to ensure that the inspection was done 
correctly. 

The Committee determined that it 

would not be necessary for this 
documentation to be available on site. 
The information in the document is not 
routinely needed at the site to ensure 
safe operation. Rather, it would be 
sufficient to maintain it in a centralized 
location (such as a corporate office) and 
made available as necessary. 

During the SBREFA process, several 

Small Entity Representatives objected to 
the requirement for documentation of 
monthly and annual inspections, stating 
that such documentation would be 
unduly burdensome and would not, in 
their opinions, add to worker safety. 
The Panel recommended that OSHA 
solicit public comment on the extent of 
inspection documentation the rule 
should require. OSHA requests 
comment on this issue.

59775 

Paragraph 1412(g) Severe Service 

Proposed paragraph (g) would require 

the employer to inspect the equipment 
when the severity of use/conditions— 
‘‘such as loading that may have 
exceeded rated capacity, shock loading 
that may have exceeded rated capacity, 
[or] prolonged exposure to a corrosive 
atmosphere’’—creates a ‘‘reasonable 
probability of damage or excessive 
wear.’’ In such instances, the employer 
would be required to stop using the 
equipment and have a qualified person 
‘‘inspect the equipment for structural 
damage’’; determine whether, in light of 
the use/conditions of the severe service, 
any items listed in the Annual/ 
comprehensive inspection need to be 
inspected and if so, inspect them; and 
if a deficiency is found, follow the 
correction/monitoring procedures set 
forth in proposed § 1926.1412(f)(4)– 
(f)(6). 

Neither ANSI B30.5–1968 nor ASME 

B30.5–2004 has a specific inspection 
provision for severe service. Rather, 
those standards reference ‘‘severity of 
service’’ as a factor to be considered 
when determining how frequently to 
conduct a Periodic Inspection. COE–EM 
385–1–1 (1 Jan 03) references severe 
service under its periodic inspection as 
a basis for requiring that inspection to 
be performed quarterly as opposed to 
‘‘Yearly.’’ 

The Committee believed that there are 

certain events and circumstances that, 
because they may cause damage (i.e., 
structural damage or significant wear), 
should trigger a close inspection to 
check for such damage, rather than 
waiting for the next annual inspection. 

The Committee considered using 

‘‘heavy service’’ as a trigger for such an 
inspection. In the course of that 
discussion, the Committee considered 
triggering the inspection based on 
specific rated load capacities (such as 85 
to 100% of the rated load capacity) or 
on a particular number of cycles (such 
as in excess of 10 lift cycles per hour). 
These were rejected because members 
believed that, as long as the use is 
within the equipment’s rated capacity, 
such use would not be expected to 
necessitate a special inspection. 

Instead, the Committee agreed that a 

trigger based on use or conditions in 
which there is a reasonable probability 
of damage or excessive wear would be 
an effective means of ensuring that 
equipment was not operated with such 
damage/wear. Examples were provided 
in the proposed provision to add clarity 
to the concept.

Paragraph 1412(h) Equipment Not in 
Regular Use 

Proposed paragraph (h) would require 

that equipment that sits idle for three 
months or more be inspected by a 
qualified person in accordance with the 
monthly inspection provisions of 
proposed § 1926.1412(e) before being 
used. 

This would ensure that deficiencies 

that may arise as a result of the 
equipment standing idle are checked 
before its subsequent use. The 
Committee believed that this inspection 
would need to be done by a qualified 
person because some of the deficiencies 
that may arise from sitting idle require 
the qualified person’s higher level of 
ability to detect and assess. For 
example, equipment that is idle for a 
period of time is often subject to 
variations in weather (e.g., temperature 
and humidity) that cause contraction 
and expansion of parts and fluids, 
which can cause damage. In addition, 
idle equipment is also more likely to 
have corroded pins and corrosion on the 
boom. Such conditions need to be 
assessed by a qualified person to 
determine if there is a deficiency that 
constitutes a hazard. 

This proposed requirement differs 

from the ANSI/ASME standards in 
several respects, most significantly in 
terms of the time frame that triggers the 
inspection and the type of inspection 
required. Both ANSI B30.5–1968 and 
ASME B30.5–2004 subject cranes that 
are idle for one or more months, but less 
than six months, to a frequent 
inspection, and cranes that are idle for 
six or more months to a periodic 
inspection. It should be noted that 
under the proposed provision and the 
ANSI/ASME standards, an inspection of 
wire rope is included. A qualified 
person would conduct this inspection of 
wire rope (as well as the rest of the 
items included in this inspection of 
equipment not in regular use). 

The Committee considered the ANSI/ 

ASME approach to inspecting idle 
equipment. It determined that a one 
month trigger was too short, because 
problems that may arise from the 
equipment sitting idle, such as drying/ 
hardening seals, take longer than that to 
occur. It believed that a three month 
trigger was more appropriate to use for 
this purpose. 

Paragraph 1412(i). [Reserved.] This 

paragraph is reserved because it is 
inconvenient for readers to determine 
whether ‘‘(i)’’ is being used as a letter or 
a roman numeral. 
Paragraph 1412(j) 

Proposed paragraph (j) would require 

that any part of a manufacturer’s 

inspection procedures relating to safe 
operation that is more comprehensive or 
has a more frequent schedule than that 
required by this proposed section must 
be followed. However, the proposed 
paragraph notes that additional 
manufacturer documentation 
requirements need not be followed. 
Examples are provided in the proposed 
provision of the types of items that 
would be considered to relate to safe 
operation (‘‘a safety device or operator 
aid, critical part of a control system, 
power plant, braking system, load- 
sustaining structural components, load 
hook, or in-use operating mechanism’’). 

Neither the general provisions of 29 

CFR part 1926 Subpart N nor ANSI 
B30.5–1968 contains a similar 
provision. However, § 1926.550(c)(5) of 
Subpart N relative to hammerhead 
tower cranes and § 1926.550(f)(2)(iii) 
relative to floating cranes and floating 
derricks require that inspections meet 
the manufacturer’s requirements. COE– 
EM 385–1–1–1 (3 Nov 03) states that 
‘‘[c]ranes and derricks shall be * * * 
inspected * * * in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s operating manual for the 
crane and the applicable ANSI/ASME 
codes or OSHA requirements, 
whichever is more stringent.’’ 

The Committee believed that, to the 

extent a more comprehensive or 
frequent inspection is specified by the 
manufacturer, it is necessary for that to 
be done to ensure the safe operation of 
the equipment. In the Committee’s view, 
the expertise of the manufacturer with 
respect to the equipment in this regard 
needs to be recognized and acted upon. 
Summary of Significant Differences 
From the Current 29 CFR Part 1926 
Subpart N 

This proposed section differs in 

several respects from Subpart N. Unlike 
Subpart N, the proposed standard does 
not include an initial inspection for new 
equipment or inspections for standby 
cranes, nor does it include a 
requirement for preventive 
maintenance. 

The Committee concluded that 

manufacturers’ quality control and 
inspection practices are generally 
effective in ensuring that new 
equipment does not have deficiencies 
that constitute safety hazards. The 
Committee believed that, to the extent 
those practices do not identify and 
correct all such hazards, the shift 
inspection would be adequate to 
identify and address them. 

The Committee concluded that a 

special inspection for ‘‘standby’’ cranes 
is not needed since the proposed section 
includes proposed requirements for 
equipment ‘‘not in regular use’’ (see the

discussion of proposed § 1926.1412(h), 
above). 

The Committee also concluded that a 

general requirement for preventive 
maintenance is not needed because the 
proposed inspection requirements are 
designed to ensure that deficiencies 
constituting safety hazards will be 
identified quickly and equipment with 
such a safety hazard would be 
prohibited from being returned to 
service until the hazard is corrected. 
As discussed above, the proposed 

section would add requirements for a 
post-assembly inspection and a severe 
service inspection, and varies from 
Subpart N to some extent with respect 
to some of the items to be inspected. In 
addition, the specific proposed 
requirements for inspecting operational 
aids and for a qualified person to 
perform the modified equipment and 
annual inspections would be new 
requirements. Finally, rather than 
providing for ‘‘daily to monthly’’ 
inspections, the proposed standard 
would require shift inspections and 
monthly inspections. 
Section 1413 Wire Rope—Inspection 
Cranes/derricks use wire rope to lift 

and support their loads and parts of the 
equipment. If the rope is worn or 
damaged, it can break, causing a failure 
of the equipment and/or a falling load, 
which can kill or injure workers below. 
Approximately 3% of crane fatalities in 
construction work result from wire 
ropes snapping. J.E. Beavers et al., 
‘‘Crane-Related Fatalities in the 
Construction Industry,’’ 132 Journal of 
Construction Engineering and 
Management 901, 903 (Sept. 2006). 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0011). 

Subpart N, in § 1926.550(a), contains 

several inspection requirements 
applicable to wire ropes. Other 
requirements are found in ANSI B30.5– 
1968, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N through 
§ 1926.550(b)(2). In addition, the 
employer currently must look to both 
§ 1926.550 and to the ANSI standard to 
learn the content of the required 
inspections, the qualifications of the 
inspector, and the requirements for 
addressing deficiencies found in ropes. 
The Committee believed that placing all 
of the required inspections and 
remedies in this subpart without 
reference to outside resources would 
make it easier for employers to find and 
become familiar with the steps they are 
required to take and so facilitate 
compliance. This is particularly true for 
small businesses, which bear a 
disproportionate cost when they must 
access outside resources.

The proposal would require wire rope 

inspections at the same frequency— 
shift, monthly, and annually—that 
would apply for other crane 
components. Also, like inspections of 
other components, the shift and 
monthly inspections must be conducted 
by a ‘‘competent person,’’ and the 
annual inspection by a ‘‘qualified 
person.’’ 
Paragraph 1413(a) Shift Inspection 

Proposed paragraph (a) would require 

a shift inspection, the first of the three 
types of wire rope inspections that 
would be required under this subpart. 
The timing, degree of scrutiny, and the 
level of expertise required of the person 
conducting this inspection and the other 
two inspections (monthly and annual) 
essentially mirror those in proposed 
§ 1926.1412, Inspections, for general 
equipment inspections. 
Paragraph 1413(a)(1) 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1) describes 
who conducts the shift inspection, the 
timing of the inspection, and the degree 
of scrutiny required. 

The shift inspection would be 

conducted by a ‘‘competent person,’’ a 
defined term in this subpart.36 C–DAC 
believed that a ‘‘competent person’’ 
would be the appropriate person to 
perform the shift inspection. OSHA 
standards typically assign comparable 
inspection duties to ‘‘competent 
persons.’’ See, for example, 
§ 1926.753(c) (competent person must 
conduct pre-shift visual inspection of 
cranes used in steel erection) and 
§ 1926.451(d)(3)(i) (competent person 
must inspect suspension scaffold before 
use to ensure it is able to support 
intended load). Moreover, a ‘‘competent 
person’’ would conduct other aspects of 
the shift inspections under this 
proposed standard. Some C–DAC 
members questioned using a 
‘‘competent person’’ for shift and 
monthly inspections on the basis that 
the individual most likely to perform 
such an inspection, the operator, may 
not have the authority to take corrective 
action, as is required of a ‘‘competent 
person’’ by definition. In response, 
OSHA notes that the employer would be 
required to ensure that the person 
assigned to perform the shift inspections 
has the requisite authority. 

This proposed paragraph also would 

require that this inspection be started 
before each shift and be completed 
before or during that shift. As with the 

36 As discussed below under paragraph 

1926.1413(a)(4), Removal from service, in certain 
instances tasks relative to alternative measures for 
certain (Category II) deficiencies would be done by 
a ‘‘qualified person,’’ also a defined term. 

general shift inspection, the Committee 
concluded that it was appropriate to 
allow the wire rope inspection to be 
completed during the shift instead of 
requiring it to be completed before the 
shift begins (see the discussion above of 
proposed § 1926.1412(d)(1), which 
explains the Committee’s reasons for 
allowing the general shift inspection to 
be completed during the shift). 

Accordingly, the competent person 
would be required to inspect all wire 
rope that is reasonably likely to be used 
during the shift. In cases where some of 
the rope that is likely to be used is not 
readily visible before the shift begins, as 
discussed above, that portion may be 
inspected during the shift. 

Proposed § 1926.1413(a)(1) would 

require the competent person to conduct 
a ‘‘visual inspection * * * for apparent 
deficiencies.’’ As discussed below, the 
purpose of this inspection is to ensure 
that deficiencies are identified and that, 
depending on the competent person’s 
evaluation of those deficiencies, 
appropriate action is taken. The 
Committee wanted to make clear, 
however, that the inspection was not to 
be so comprehensive and time- 
consuming that it would be unrealistic 
to conduct it for each shift. To clarify 
that the inspection was one that was 
reasonable for a shift inspection, the 
provision states that neither ‘‘untwisting 
(opening of wire rope)’’ nor ‘‘booming 
down’’ would be required during this 
inspection. It believed that keeping the 
level of inspection realistic will 
encourage compliance that ultimately 
will serve to reduce accidents. 
Paragraph 1413(a)(2) Apparent 
Deficiencies 

Proposed § 1926.1413(a)(1) (discussed 

above) would require the competent 
person to look for ‘‘apparent 
deficiencies, including those listed in 
paragraph (a)(2).’’ Proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(2) would establish three 
categories (I, II, and III) of apparent wire 
rope deficiencies. The likelihood that a 
deficiency is hazardous increases as the 
number of the category increases from I 
to III. As discussed further below, the 
category determines the options or 
‘‘next steps’’ available to or required of 
the employer under § 1926.1413(a)(4), 
Removal from service. 

C–DAC’s goal in this paragraph is to 

establish clear and appropriate 
requirements setting out the steps 
employers must take when inspections 
reveal deficiencies. 

Category I: Proposed 

§ 1926.1413(a)(2)(i) lists ‘‘Category I’’ 
apparent deficiencies. These are similar 
to the types of wire rope deterioration 
noted in the inspection provisions of

59777 

section 5–2.4.1 of ANSI B30.5–1968 and 
section 5–2.4.2 of ASME B30.5–2004. 
As further indicated below in the 
discussion of § 1926.1413(a)(4)(i) under 
Removal from service, these items are 
grouped together because they reflect 
damage that may or may not be severe 
enough to constitute a hazard. Proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(i) sets forth the steps 
the employer would be required to take 
once a Category I apparent deficiency 
has been identified. 

Proposed § 1926.1413(a)(2)(i)(A) 
begins the list with the ‘‘significant 
distortion’’ of wire rope, such as 
‘‘kinking, crushing, unstranding, 
birdcaging, signs of core failure or steel 
core protrusion between the strands.’’ 
These apparent deficiencies were 
selected because, as indicated by their 
inclusion in consensus standards, such 
as section 5–2.4.2 of ASME B30.5–2004, 
they may constitute or indicate the 
presence of a hazard. The Committee 
considered whether the reference in this 
paragraph to core failure should be 
limited to rotation resistant rope. 
However, the Committee decided not to 
limit ‘‘signs of core failure’’ to rotation 
resistant rope. 

The word ‘‘significant’’ was included 

in this and other provisions in 
§ 1926.1413(a)(2)(i) to make clear that 
minimal defects of these types do not 
rise to the level of Category I 
deficiencies. Only those that may pose 
genuine safety concerns are included. 

Proposed § 1926.1413 (a)(2)(i)(B) lists 

‘‘significant corrosion’’ as a Category I 
apparent deficiency. This type of 
damage was included because severe 
corrosion can weaken wire rope and 
cause it to break. The Committee used 
the descriptive term ‘‘significant’’ to 
limit further action to situations in 
which the degree of corrosion could 
realistically suggest a hazard. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) lists 
‘‘electric arc (from a source other than 
power lines) or heat damage’’ as a 
Category I apparent deficiency. These 
deficiencies were derived from SAE 
(Society of Automotive Engineers) and 
COE (Army Corps of Engineers) 
standards and are included because 
such damage can weaken the wire rope. 
In discussing these types of damage, 
some Committee members expressed 
concern that ‘‘heat damage’’ would 
include instances where the rope had 
been cut to size by flame cutting. 
However, flame cutting would occur at 
the end of the newly cut rope, not at a 
load-bearing part of the rope. Heat 
damage is only a concern if it weakens 
a load-bearing part of the rope. Flame 
cutting done at the end of the rope, not 
in a load-bearing part, would not cause 
a hazard. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) lists 
‘‘improperly applied end connections’’ 
as another apparent deficiency. In the 
Committee’s experience, one type of 
error that occurs is when somebody 
between shifts cuts the cable and puts 
the end connection back the wrong 
way.37 An improper connection is 
weaker than a proper one and can result 
in the connection failing. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(i)(E) lists 

‘‘[s]ignificantly corroded, cracked, bent, 
or worn end connections (such as from 
severe service)’’ as the last type of 
Category I apparent deficiency. Each of 
these may constitute a hazard. 

Category II: Proposed paragraph 

(a)(2)(ii) contains two types of Category 
II apparent deficiencies—visible broken 
wires (§ 1926.1413(a)(2)(ii)(A)) and wire 
rope diameter reduction 
(§ 1926.1413(a)(2)(ii)(B)). In the 
experience of the Committee, these 
more typically signal the presence of a 
safety hazard than Category I apparent 
deficiencies. Proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(ii), under Removal 
from service, sets forth the steps the 
employer would be required to take 
once a Category II apparent deficiency 
has been identified. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) lists 

separate criteria for visible broken wires 
for running wire ropes (six randomly 
distributed broken wires in one rope lay 
or three broken wires in one strand in 
one rope lay), rotation resistant ropes 
(two randomly distributed broken wires 
in six rope diameters or four randomly 
distributed broken wires in 30 rope 
diameters), and pendant or standing 
wire ropes (more than two broken wires 
in one rope lay located in rope beyond 
end connections and/or more than one 
broken wire in a rope lay located at an 
end connection). 

A ‘‘running wire rope’’ is a wire rope 
that moves over sheaves or drums. This 
definition is included in § 1926.1401 of 
this proposed standard to make clear the 
nature of the wire rope that is subject to 
this inspection provision. These criteria 
are the same as those contained in 
section 5–2.4.3 of ASME B30.5–2004, 
and those for running wire ropes and 
pendant or standing wire ropes are also 
contained in section 5–2.4.2 of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, which is incorporated by 
reference in 29 CFR Part 1926 subpart 
N. One issue that was left unanswered 
during the Committee discussions is 
whether these broken wire criteria are 
equally applicable when using plastic 
sheaves. The Agency requests public 
comment on this issue. 

37 An example would be when the person installs 

a U-bolt clip with the ‘‘U’’ on the live end of the 
wire rope. 

The reference in proposed paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(B) to ‘‘a diameter reduction of 
more than 5% from nominal diameter’’ 
reflects a change in the manner of 
expressing essentially the same criteria 
currently set forth in fractions in 
Subpart N (§ 1926.550(a)(7)(iv)) and 
section 5–2.4.3(b)(6) of ASME B30.5– 
2004. OSHA notes that the ‘‘reduction 
in diameter’’ fractions set forth currently 
in § 1926.550(a)(7)(iv) are in each case 
equal to or greater than 5%, so the 
proposed across the board 5% criterion 
is equally or more protective than the 
current standard for each rope diameter. 
C–DAC used the percentage reduction 
criterion because it is consistent with 
the criterion now being set by rope 
manufacturers and used in the industry. 
The industry uses the percentage 
reduction criterion because it is easier to 
remember than the fractional reductions 
in Subpart N. 

Category III: Proposed paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) lists apparent Category III 
deficiencies. The Committee believed 
that these are of such significance that 
they require the rope’s immediate 
removal from service. For some 
Category III deficiencies, the undamaged 
part of the rope may be returned to 
service if the damaged part is severed 
(the actions required in response to 
identifying these deficiencies are 
discussed below with respect to 
proposed § 1926.1413(a)(4)(iv)). 

Under proposed paragraph 

(a)(2)(iii)(A), ‘‘core protrusion or other 
distortion indicating core failure’’ in 
rotation resistant rope would be a 
Category III apparent deficiency. As 
described by a C–DAC member, this 
visible indicator is present when there 
is core protrusion between the outer 
strands or, in other words, ‘‘the metal 
core is coming out.’’ Core protrusion is 
a late-stage indicator that the rope has 
already suffered significant damage and, 
in the Committee’s judgment, 
necessitates the rope’s immediate 
removal from service. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(a)(2)(iii)(B), ‘‘[e]lectrical contact with a 
power line’’ would be a Category III 
apparent deficiency. Contact with a 
power line could cause the rope to carry 
a high electrical current that could 
result in internal damage that 
significantly reduces the rope’s strength. 
The Committee believed that, in view of 
the difficulty in confirming such 
internal damage and the likelihood that 
significant damage has occurred in such 
instances, it is imperative that the entire 
rope be replaced. 

The rope would have to be removed 
from service under this provision if the 
load, rigging, or the rope itself makes 
electrical contact with a power line. In

addition, electrical contact under this 
provision would occur if the boom or 
other part of the crane contacts a power 
line and the wire rope is in contact with 
the ground through the hook or some 
other means. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) also 
lists ‘‘a broken strand’’ as a Category III 
apparent deficiency. A strand is a 
‘‘group’’ of wires. In the Committee’s 
view, that degree of damage clearly 
compromises the rope’s capacity and 
continued use would be dangerous. 
Paragraph 1413(a)(3) Critical Review 
Items 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(3), the 
competent person must give particular 
attention to certain ‘‘Critical Review 
Items’’ during the shift inspection (as 
well as, as discussed below, in the 
monthly and annual inspections). 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(3)(i), 

rotation resistant wire rope that is in use 
would be a critical review item. As 
indicated earlier, the construction of 
rotation resistant rope makes it more 
susceptible to damage and more 
difficult to detect damage to the inner 
wires and/or strands. 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(3)(ii), 
‘‘wire rope being used for boom hoists 
and luffing hoists, particularly at reverse 
bends’’ would be included in the list 
because of the critical nature of these 
ropes and, with respect to reverse 
bends, because these areas are subjected 
to more stress and are more prone to 
damage. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(3)(iii) lists 
‘‘wire rope at flange points, crossover 
points and repetitive pickup points on 
drums’’ because these points of the rope 
are subject to additional wear. These 
terms are defined in § 1926.1401, 
Definitions, as follows: 

Flange point: A point of contact between 

rope and drum flange where the rope changes 
layers. 

Crossover points: Locations on a wire rope 
which is spooled on a drum where one layer 
of rope climbs up and crosses over the 
previous layer. This takes place at each 
flange of the drum as the rope is spooled onto 
the drum, reaches the flange, and begins to 
wrap back in the opposite direction. 

Repetitive pickup points: When operating 

on a short cycle operation, the rope being 
used on a single layer and being spooled 
repetitively over a short portion of the drum. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(3)(iv) lists 

‘‘wire rope adjacent to end connections’’ 
because such rope is prone to corrosion 
and/or breakage due to the localized 
stresses placed on these areas. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(3)(v) lists 

‘‘wire rope at and on equalizer sheaves’’ 
because the limited travel of such rope 
and added stress make it more prone to 
wear.

Paragraph 1413(a)(4) Removal From 
Service 

Remedial steps upon identification of 

apparent deficiency: Proposed 
paragraph (a)(4) would set out the 
required next steps to be taken once the 
competent person performing the 
inspection has identified an apparent 
deficiency. Those steps depend upon 
whether, under § 1926.1413(a)(2), the 
apparent deficiency falls under Category 
I, II or III. Under this approach, 
immediate removal from service would 
be required for certain deficiencies, 
while continued use under prescribed 
circumstances would be allowed for 
others. This approach was adopted by 
C–DAC because, in the Committee’s 
collective experience, different types of 
deficiencies warrant different responses. 

As described below, this approach 

differs somewhat from Subpart N, with 
its incorporation by reference of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, as well as ASME B30.5– 
2004. In addition, certain apparent 
deficiencies addressed in this proposed 
rule are not addressed by those 
consensus standards. 

Category I remedial steps: Proposed 

paragraph (a)(4)(i) sets forth the follow- 
up to the discovery of a Category I 
apparent deficiency that would be 
required. Immediately upon the 
discovery of such a deficiency, the 
competent person must determine 
whether the deficiency is a safety 
hazard. If it is determined to be a 
hazard, operations involving the use of 
the wire rope would be prohibited until 
one of two responses is taken—the rope 
is replaced or the deficiency, if localized 
(and not due to power line contact), is 
removed by severing the rope in two so 
that the undamaged portion can be 
used. The provision also would prohibit 
joining lengths of rope by splicing. 

The Committee found that the 

likelihood of significant damage from 
power line contact is so great that, after 
such contact, it is imperative that the 
rope be removed from service. Also, it 
determined that splicing is not a safe 
practice and should therefore be 
prohibited. 

The Category I deficiencies, except for 
damage from significant corrosion or an 
electric arc, are currently addressed by 
Subpart N through incorporation by 
reference of section 5–2.4 of ASME 
B30.5–1968. That ANSI standard 
requires the deficiencies to be evaluated 
(by an ‘‘appointed or authorized 
person’’) and a determination made as 
to whether continued use of the rope 
would constitute a safety hazard. A 
similar provision is contained in ASME 
B30.5–2004. These provisions imply, 
but do not explicitly state, that a rope 

constituting a safety hazard must not be 
used. The proposed standard would 
explicitly state this prohibition. 

Category II remedial steps: Proposed 
paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (iii) establish 
the procedures to be followed once 
Category II apparent deficiencies have 
been identified. This category of 
deficiencies includes wire rope that has 
diameter reduction and/or visible 
broken wires as described in proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(2)(ii). Proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(ii) sets forth two 
alternative options for the employer— 
Option A or B—when such a deficiency 
is identified. 

Under Option A, an employer must 

consider the wire rope to be a safety 
hazard where the deficiency meets the 
wire rope manufacturer’s established 
criterion for removal or ‘‘meets a 
different criterion that the wire rope 
manufacturer has approved in writing 
for that specific wire rope.’’ In such 
instances, operations involving the use 
of the wire rope in question are 
prohibited until it is replaced or severed 
as provided in § 1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B). 

Option B would allow limited 

continued use of the wire rope with an 
identified Category II apparent 
deficiency provided the employer 
ensures the procedures specified in 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(iii) are met. Under 
1926.1413(a)(4)(iii), a qualified person 
first assesses the deficiencies in light of 
the load and other conditions of use and 
determines that continued use is safe as 
long as the conditions established in 
this paragraph are met. 

These conditions include (as 

established by the qualified person) the 
parameters for use of the rope, including 
a reduced maximum rated load, the 
number of broken wires and/or the 
diameter reduction that will require the 
rope to be taken out of service (or 
repaired in accordance with proposed 
1926.1413(4)(i)(A) or (B)), and a specific 
time limit, not to exceed 30 days from 
the date the deficiency was first 
identified, to replace the rope or sever 
the damaged portion in accordance with 
1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B). 

The C–DAC draft, at paragraph 

(a)(4)(iii)(C), would also have allowed 
the qualified person to specify the 
number of broken strands that would 
require the equipment to be taken out of 
service. However, as discussed above, 
under 1926.1413(a)(2)(iii)(C), a single 
broken strand is a Category III apparent 
deficiency that requires the equipment 
to be immediately removed from service 
until the rope is replaced or the 
deficiency severed, in which case the 
undamaged part of the rope may 
continue to be used. Because the 
proposed rule prohibits any use of a

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules

wire rope with a broken strand, OSHA 
has deleted the words ‘‘broken strands’’ 
from 1926.1413(a)(4)(iii)(C). 

Once the qualified person has 

established the conditions for continued 
use of the rope, the workers who are to 
conduct the shift inspections must be 
notified of the qualified person’s 
determinations. In addition, the 
qualified person’s procedures and 
findings must be documented. The 
Committee included this documentation 
provision because the person 
conducting the shift inspections would 
need to be able to refer to the parameters 
set by the qualified person. 

29 CFR Part 1926 subpart N, in 

§ 1926.550(a)(7), currently requires that 
ropes with the same deficiencies that 
would fall under the proposed rule’s 
Category II (as well as heat damage, 
which would be a Category I deficiency) 
be removed from service. Section 
2.4.3(a) of ASME B30.5–2004 allows the 
rope to be used to the end of the work 
shift based on the judgment of a 
qualified person. 

The Committee determined that the 

alternative measures specified in Option 
B are sufficiently comprehensive and 
specific to ensure that the rope’s 
continued use for up to 30 days would 
be safe. 

OSHA notes that the remedial steps 

for Category II apparent deficiencies do 
not, unlike those for Category I and III 
apparent deficiencies, state explicitly 
that splicing of wire rope is prohibited. 
Instead, § 1926.1413(a)(4)(ii)(A) states 
that, if a Category II apparent deficiency 
is a safety hazard, continued use of the 
rope is prohibited unless ‘‘the damage is 
removed in accordance with 
§ 1926.1413(4)(i)(B),’’ which applies to 
Category I deficiencies. Proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B) includes a 
prohibition against splicing that C–DAC 
intended to apply to Category II 
deficiencies, but the language ‘‘damage 
is removed’’ in proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(ii)(A) could, in the 
absence of an explicit prohibition 
against splicing in that paragraph, 
arguably be read to mean that the rope 
could be severed and the undamaged 
portions spliced. To make clear C– 
DAC’s intent that the anti-splicing 
provision of § 1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B) 
applies to Category II, OSHA has 
modified the C–DAC language for 
proposed § 1926.1413(a)(4)(ii)(B) as 
follows: 

(ii) If a deficiency in Category II is 

identified, the employer shall comply with 
Option A of this section or Option B of this 
section, as follows: 

(A) Option A. Consider the deficiency to 

constitute a safety hazard where it meets the 
wire rope manufacturer’s established 

criterion for removal from service or meets a 
different criterion that the wire rope 
manufacturer has approved in writing for 
that specific wire rope. If the deficiency is 
considered a safety hazard, operations 
involving use of the wire rope in question 
shall be prohibited until the wire rope is 
replaced, or the damage is removed in 
accordance with all of the requirements and 
restrictions in paragraph (4)(i)(B) of this 
section. 

OSHA has made similar changes to 

proposed § 1926.1413(a)(4)(iii)(C) & (D). 
Category III remedial steps: Proposed 
paragraph (a)(4)(iv) would establish the 
procedure for dealing with identified 
apparent deficiencies that fall within 
Category III. These deficiencies include 
a broken strand, electrical contact with 
a power line, and core protrusion or 
other distortion in rotation resistant 
rope indicating core failure. This 
proposed paragraph would prohibit 
operations involving the use of the wire 
rope until either the wire rope is 
replaced or (except where there has 
been power line contact) severed in two, 
so that the undamaged portion can be 
used. Joining lengths of wire rope by 
splicing would be prohibited (see 
discussion above of proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B)). 

Neither Subpart N nor ANSI B30.5– 

1968 addresses these apparent 
deficiencies. However, the Committee 
noted that section 5–2.4.2(a) of ASME 
B30.5–2000 lists ‘‘broken or cut strands’’ 
and ‘‘core failure in rotation resistant 
ropes’’ as deficiencies that may be an 
immediate hazard. (ASME B30.5–2004 
contains the same characterization of 
these deficiencies as the 2000 version). 
The Committee believed that ropes with 
Category III deficiencies must not be 
used because of the high potential for 
rope failure. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(4)(v) would 

require that where a wire rope is 
required to be removed from service 
under this proposed section, the 
equipment (as a whole) or the hoist with 
that wire rope shall be tagged-out as 
provided in proposed § 1926.1417(f)(1) 
until the wire rope is replaced or 
repaired. Neither Subpart N, with its 
incorporated reference to ASME B30.5– 
1968, nor ASME B30.5–2004 contains a 
similar tag-out provision specific to wire 
rope. The Committee believed that this 
would be an efficient and effective way 
of preventing employees from activating 
equipment (or the affected hoist) that 
has a wire rope with an identified 
hazard. 
Paragraph 1413(b) Monthly Inspection 
Proposed paragraph (b) would require 
a monthly inspection of wire rope. The 
monthly inspection would be, as

explained below, a documented shift 
inspection. C–DAC decided to keep the 
timing of this inspection (as well as the 
level of scrutiny required and the 
expertise required of the inspector) 
parallel with the general inspection 
requirements in § 1926.1412 to provide 
for an efficient inspection process and 
thus enhance compliance. A monthly 
wire rope inspection is currently 
required by Subpart N’s incorporation 
by reference of ASME B30.5–1968. 

Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 

would require the monthly inspection to 
be conducted in the same manner as the 
shift inspection under § 1926.1413(a). 
Thus, the monthly inspection would be 
a visual inspection conducted by a 
competent person for the same types of 
apparent deficiencies noted in the wire 
rope shift inspection. 

It should be noted that the reference 
in proposed § 1926.1413(b)(2) of the C– 
DAC Consensus Document to 
‘‘paragraph 1413(a)(3)’’ has been 
corrected in the proposed rule to refer 
to § 1926.1413(a)(4), which contains the 
relevant provisions governing corrective 
actions. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(3) would 

require the monthly inspection to be 
documented in the same manner as 
required by paragraph § 1926.1412(e)(3) 
for the monthly general inspection. C– 
DAC wanted to keep this requirement 
parallel with the monthly general 
inspection provision in order to reduce 
paperwork and confusion, and facilitate 
compliance. 

Specifically, for the general monthly 
inspection, § 1926.1412(e)(3) provides 
that the ‘‘employer that conducts the 
inspection’’ must provide 
documentation that reflects the items 
checked with results, the name and 
signature of the inspector, and the date. 
Similar requirements are set forth in 
ASME B30.5–1968. 

Proposed paragraph 1412(e)(3) also 

specifies that the documentation be 
retained for not less than three-months. 
The Committee believed that the 
proposed three-month retention period 
would provide sufficient overlap to 
avoid gaps in information and thus 
provide a tracking mechanism for 
developing problem areas. 
Paragraph 1413(c) Annual/ 
Comprehensive 

Proposed paragraph 1413(c) would 
require an annual inspection (at least 
every 12 months) for wire rope, 
conducted by a qualified person. The 
annual inspection would be 
considerably more thorough and 
comprehensive than the shift and 
monthly inspections required by 
proposed § 1926.1413(a) and (b). In

addition, it would be conducted by a 
‘‘qualified person,’’ who would have 
greater expertise than the ‘‘competent 
person’’ who must conduct the shift and 
monthly inspections. 

The timing and inspector 

qualifications for the annual wire rope 
inspection coincide with those for the 
general equipment annual/ 
comprehensive inspection. C–DAC 
believed that the use of corresponding 
timeframes and personnel will allow 
inspections to be conducted efficiently 
and thereby promote effectiveness and 
compliance. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(1), all 

apparent deficiencies and critical 
review items required to be checked in 
a shift inspection would have to be 
checked in the annual/comprehensive 
inspection (see § 1926.1413(a)(2) and 
(a)(3)). In addition, under proposed 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2), a complete and 
thorough inspection, covering the 
surface of the entire length of the wire 
ropes, would be required. In addition to 
inspecting in this manner for the types 
of deficiencies listed in 
§ 1926.1413(a)(2), under proposed 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(A), the qualified 
person would be required to give 
particular attention to the critical review 
items listed in § 1926.1413(a)(3). Note 
that the C–DAC document’s 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(A) referred to the 
‘‘critical review items listed in 
paragraph (a)(2)’’ instead of 
§ 1926.1413(a)(3). That reference to 
§ 1926.1413(a)(2) was a typographical 
error, which has been corrected in the 
proposed rule. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(c)(2)(ii)(B), particular attention must be 
given to those sections of wire rope that 
are normally hidden during shift and 
monthly inspections. For example, such 
sections would include parts of the rope 
that form the lower wraps on the boom 
hoist drum and which would not be 
visible unless the drum is in a very low 
angle position. The parts of the rope that 
are normally inside a cowling or 
covered area would be another example 
of such sections. 

Similarly, proposed paragraphs 

(c)(2)(ii)(C) through (F) require 
particular attention to wire rope in 
contact with saddles, equalizer sheaves 
or other sheaves where rope travel is 
limited, wire rope subject to reverse 
bends, wire rope passing over sheaves 
and wire rope at or near terminal ends, 
since these areas are more prone to 
wear. 

Unlike the shift and monthly 

inspections, in which booming down 
would not be required, booming down 
would be necessary in order for the 
inspection to be ‘‘complete and

thorough, covering the surface of the 
entire length of the wire rope.’’ 

OSHA notes that the items listed in 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (F) (‘‘Wire 
rope in contact with saddles, equalizer 
sheaves or other sheaves where rope 
travel is limited’’ and ‘‘Wire rope at or 
near terminal ends’’) are similar to the 
critical review items listed for shift 
inspections in proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(3)(iv) and (a)(3)(v)(‘‘Wire 
rope adjacent to end connections’’ and 
‘‘Wire rope at and on equalizer 
sheaves’’). Consequently, the Agency is 
planning to revise the language in 
proposed § 1926.1413(a)(3)(iv) and 
(a)(3)(v) to match the language in 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (c)(2)(ii)(F). 
OSHA then could delete proposed 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (c)(2)(ii)(F) 
because proposed 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(A) incorporates by 
reference the critical review items listed 
in § 1926.1413(a)(3)(iv) and (a)(3)(v), 
thereby making the items listed in 
proposed paragraphs 
§ 1926.1413(c)(2)(ii)(C) and (c)(2)(ii)(F) 
redundant and unnecessary. The 
Agency asks the public for comments on 
this proposed action. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(iii) would 
establish an exception to the timing of 
the annual/ comprehensive inspection 
where that inspection is infeasible due 
to ‘‘existing set-up and configuration of 
the equipment (such as where an assist 
crane is needed) or due to site 
conditions (such as a dense urban 
setting).’’ The provision sets a timetable 
for annual/comprehensive inspections 
in such cases that requires the 
inspection to be performed ‘‘as soon as 
it becomes feasible, but no longer than 
an additional 6 months for running 
ropes and, for standing ropes, at the 
time of disassembly.’’ 

This provision reflects the 

Committee’s concern that, particularly 
in densely developed urban settings, the 
inability to boom down would prevent 
the employer from completing a 
comprehensive wire rope inspection. 
The Committee considered requiring 
employers anticipating such situations 
to provide rope that is new or ‘‘like 
new’’ when the crane is set-up at the 
site. Also considered was requiring that 
an annual inspection be required in 
such instances before the start of the job. 
The Committee found these proposals to 
be impractical because it is difficult for 
employers to forecast completion 
timeframes with sufficient accuracy. 

The proposed provision is intended to 

ensure that, under the circumstances 
where the exception would apply, the 
required inspection would occur within 
an appropriate period. The Committee 
considered a maximum of an additional 

6 months appropriate for running ropes 
in these circumstances. A longer period, 
up to the time of disassembly, was 
considered appropriate for standing 
ropes because these ropes, in the 
Committee’s experience, are less subject 
to deterioration and wear. 

These provisions of the annual/ 
comprehensive inspection differ in 
various ways from Subpart N annual 
inspection provisions at 
§ 1926.550(a)(6). The current annual 
inspection in Subpart N is a ‘‘thorough’’ 
inspection conducted by a ‘‘competent 
person or by a government or private 
agency recognized by the U.S. 
Department of Labor.’’ Under this 
proposal, the annual/comprehensive 
inspection would be conducted by a 
qualified person and includes a number 
of specific items the inspection must 
encompass. The Committee believed 
that these changes are needed to reduce 
the likelihood of injuries and fatalities 
from wire rope failure. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3) identifies 

the next steps that would have to be 
taken once the qualified person 
performing the annual/comprehensive 
inspection discovers a deficiency. The 
qualified person must immediately 
determine whether the deficiency 
constitutes a safety hazard. If it does, 
under proposed § 1926.1413(c)(3)(i), the 
rope would either have to be replaced 
or, if the deficiency is localized, the 
damaged part may be severed and the 
undamaged portion may continue to be 
used. As discussed with respect to 
proposed § 1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B), joining 
lengths of wire rope by splicing would 
be prohibited. 

The proposed standard does not 

include a prohibition in 
§ 1926.1413(c)(3)(i)(B) against repair of 
wire rope that contacted an energized 
power line, although such a prohibition 
is included in the context of a shift 
inspection in proposed 
§ 1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B). The Agency’s 
understanding is that the Committee 
decided to not include that prohibition 
in the annual/comprehensive inspection 
provision because, if an energized 
power line contact had occurred, the 
rope would have been removed from 
service immediately in accordance with 
proposed § 1926.1413(a)(4)(i)(B). 

If the qualified person determines that 

the deficiency is not currently a safety 
hazard but needs to be monitored, under 
proposed § 1926.1413(c)(3)(ii) the 
employer would be required to ensure 
that the deficiency is checked in the 
monthly inspections. This would ensure 
that, as the deficiency continues to 
develop, the competent person would 
pay particular attention to it in the 
monthly inspections. Once it became a

safety hazard, it would be identified 
promptly and the appropriate corrective 
action would be taken. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(4), the 

annual/comprehensive inspection 
would be required to be documented 
according to proposed § 1926.1412(f)(7), 
which is the documentation provision 
for the annual general inspection. As 
with other parallel requirements in this 
section, the C–DAC intended to ensure 
consistency with other recordkeeping 
requirements and thus facilitate 
compliance. 

Proposed paragraph 1412(f)(7), which 
is incorporated by reference here, would 
require the employer that is conducting 
the inspection to document and retain 
for 12 months, ‘‘the items checked and 
the results of that inspection’’ and ‘‘the 
name and signature of the person who 
conducted the inspection and the date.’’ 
This documentation requirement differs 
from 29 CFR Part 1926 subpart N’s 
annual inspection in that Subpart N 
does not specify the period of time the 
documentation must be kept and has 
neither a signature requirement nor a 
requirement that the inspector be 
named. The Committee believed that a 
12 month retention period would ensure 
that the employer would be able to refer 
to the last annual/comprehensive 
inspection to help track the rate of 
progression of a deficiency that has not 
yet developed into a safety hazard. The 
Committee also believed that it would 
increase the likelihood of compliance 
with the annual/comprehensive 
inspection requirements. 

Finally, proposed paragraph 1413(d) 

would prohibit the use of the type of 
rope lubricants that hinder inspection. 
For example, rope lubricants that are 
opaque or so dark that they mask the 
wire rope inside them would be of this 
type. This prohibition is necessary to 
ensure that the rope lubricant does not 
hide potential deficiencies. 
Section 1414 Wire Rope—Selection 
and Installation Criteria 

This proposed section sets forth 

requirements for selecting and installing 
wire rope. It addresses safety concerns 
related to wire rope selection and 
installation. In addition, it would 
provide greater flexibility in the 
selection process than current 
requirements under Subpart N. This 
flexibility reflects and takes advantage 
of new developments in wire rope 
technology. 

Currently, paragraph 

1926.550(a)(7)(vi) of Subpart N 
prescribes that wire rope safety factors 
accord with ANSI B30.5–1968 or SAE 
J959–1966. By contrast, this proposed 
section would not refer to external 

standards for wire rope safety factors or 
other requirements (with a single 
exception discussed below) and would 
give greater flexibility in selecting wire 
rope, particularly rotation resistant wire 
rope. Specific differences between this 
proposal and Subpart N are examined in 
the discussion of the paragraph where 
the difference arises. 

The Agency notes that, in developing 

the C–DAC consensus document, the 
Committee appears to have made an 
inadvertent omission. The wire rope 
safety factors in section 5–1.7.1 of ANSI 
B30.5–1968 (which, as noted above, are 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N) 
apply irrespective of whether the rope is 
of the standard type (i.e., rope that is not 
rotation-resistant) or rotation resistant. 
However, the C–DAC document 
contains safety factor (now ‘‘design’’ 
factor) requirements only for rotation 
resistant rope 38; it has no provisions on 
design factors for standard rope. 
Currently, under Subpart N’s 

incorporation of section 5–1.7.1 of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, the factors for standard 
rope vary from a minimum of 2.5 to 3.5 
depending on how the rope is used. The 
2004 version of section 5–1.7.1 of ASME 
B30.5 contains similar provisions and 
the same range of design factors.39 
Given the importance of design factors 
in the selection of wire rope, OSHA 
believes that the omission of design 
factors for standard rope from the 
C–DAC document was an oversight. 
OSHA is unaware of any reason to omit 
design factors for standard rope and 
plans to include factors for standard 
rope similar to those in section 5–1.7.1 
of ASME B30.5–2004. OSHA requests 
public comment on this issue. 
Paragraph 1414(a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) would require 

the selection of replacement wire rope 
to be in accordance with the 
requirements of this section and the 

38 As discussed below under proposed paragraph 

(c), C–DAC drew from the current 2004 ASME 
document in proposing design factors for rotation 
resistant rope. 

39 The provisions for standard rope in section 

5–1.7.1 of B30.5–2004 read as follows: 

5–1.7.1 Rope Design Factors 
(a) For supporting rated loads and for supporting 

the boom and working attachments at 
recommended travel or transit positions and boom 
lengths, 

(1) the design factor for live or running ropes that 

wind on drums or travel over sheaves shall not be 
less than 3.5. 

(2) the design factor for boom pendants or 

standing ropes shall not be less than 3.0. 

(b) For supporting the boom under recommended 

boom erection conditions, 

(1) the design factor for live or running ropes 

shall not be less than 3.0. 

(2) the design factor for boom pendants or 

standing ropes shall not be less than 2.5. 

recommendations of the wire rope 
manufacturer, the equipment 
manufacturer, or a qualified person. 
Currently, Subpart N (through section 
5–1.7.2e of ANSI B30.5–1968) limits the 
employer to using replacement rope of 
the same size, grade and construction as 
the rope originally furnished by the 
crane manufacturer unless otherwise 
approved by the rope manufacturer. The 
2004 version of ASME B30.5, in section 
5–2.4.3(d), specifies that replacement 
rope shall have a strength rating at least 
as great as the original rope unless a 
deviation is approved by the equipment 
manufacturer, the rope manufacturer, or 
a qualified person. 

A number of concerns about the 

current 29 CFR part 1926 subpart N 
provision were raised during the C–DAC 
negotiations. Some members were 
concerned about delays in obtaining 
approval from the equipment 
manufacturer. With respect to older 
equipment, the manufacturer may no 
longer be in business. In such cases the 
employer is unable to get original 
equipment wire rope information or 
obtain approval for use of a different 
specification of rope. Even where the 
original manufacturer was purchased by 
another company, the current company 
may no longer have the original 
equipment information. Another 
concern was that the wire rope 
manufacturer may be unduly 
conservative in recommending a 
replacement rope. 

The Committee concluded that it 

would be appropriate to allow a 
qualified person to determine the 
replacement rope specifications. The 
Committee believed that the criteria for 
being a qualified person are sufficiently 
rigorous to ensure that such a person’s 
recommendation in this regard would 
be authoritative with respect to safety. 

OSHA notes that proposed paragraph 

(a)’s mention of only ‘‘replacement 
rope’’ could mislead some readers to 
conclude that all of § 1926.1414 applies 
only to replacement rope. The 
Committee clearly intended that the 
remainder of § 1926.1414 apply to both 
original equipment rope and 
replacement rope. Rewording 
§ 1926.1414(a) to read as follows would, 
OSHA believes, make clear the 
Committee’s intent: ‘‘Original 
equipment wire rope and replacement 
wire rope shall be selected and installed 
in accordance with the requirements of 
this section. Selection of replacement 
wire rope shall be in accordance with 
the recommendations of the wire rope 
manufacturer, the equipment 
manufacturer, or a qualified person.’’ 
OSHA requests public comment on such 
a revision.

prohibit using fiber core ropes for boom 
hoist reeving, except for derricks. In the 
Committee’s view, the composition of 
such ropes makes them prone to 
degradation that is not completely 
detectable by normal inspection 
techniques. The Committee believed 
that fiber core ropes can be used safely 
for boom hoist reeving on derricks 
because the sheaves on derricks are 
smaller than on cranes, and because 
they are more pliable, fiber core ropes 
can accommodate reverse bending. In 
addition, but less significant, derrick 
booms are typically shorter in length 
and have less capacity. 

Currently, Subpart N does not contain 
an express prohibition against the use of 
fiber core wire ropes for boom hoist 
reeving. ANSI B30.5–1968, incorporated 
by reference into Subpart N, only 
references the effect of temperature on 
fiber core wire rope. 

The 2004 version of ASME B30.5, in 
section 5.1.7.2(b), prohibits the use of 
fiber core wire ropes for boom hoist 
reeving for mobile and locomotive 
cranes. By contrast, the standard in the 
ASME B30 series that applies to 
derricks, ASME B30.6–2003, does not 
prohibit the use of fiber core wire rope 
for boom hoist reeving. Thus, the 
distinction in proposed § 1926.1414(b) 
between cranes and derricks in this 
regard is consistent with current 
national consensus standards. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would 
prohibit rotation resistant rope from 
being used for boom hoist reeving 
except where the requirements of 
§ 1926.1414(c) are met. The Committee 
believed that only where these 
provisions are met would the use of 
rotation resistant rope for this purpose 
be safe. The particulars of paragraph (c) 
are discussed next. 
Paragraph 1414(c) Rotation Resistant 
Ropes 
Paragraph (c)(1) 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1) would 
classify rotation resistant ropes into 
three ‘‘Types’’ (‘‘Type I,’’ ‘‘Type II,’’ and 
‘‘Type III’’).40 Proposed 
§ 1926.1414(c)(2) specifies use 
limitations and requirements for each 
‘‘Type’’ of wire rope. This approach 
differs from Subpart N, ANSI B30.5– 
1968 and ASME B30.5–2004, which do 

40 ASTM A 1023/A 1023M–02 has a similar 

classification system, although it divides rotation 
resistant ropes into ‘‘categories.’’

not distinguish between types of 
rotation resistant rope. 

Technological advances have resulted 

in different types of what in the past 
had been referred to as ‘‘rotation 
resistant rope.’’ The different kinds, 
which are distinguished in this 
proposed section as Types I, II and III, 
have different capabilities, which are 
described in the definitions in proposed 
§ 1926.1414(c)(1). This proposed section 
tailors the requirements and limitations 
to each Type. The Committee believed 
that this approach would enable the 
industry to take advantage of 
technological advances and improve 
safety. 
Paragraph (c)(2) Requirements 

Proposed paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through 

(iv) set forth use requirements of the 
three ‘‘Types’’ of rotation resistant rope 
in terms of operating design factors (and 
in some instances activity). The purpose 
of these provisions is to ensure that the 
selection of the Type of rotation 
resistant rope is suitable, in terms of 
safety, to its use. 

The specifics of each paragraph are 

discussed below. This approach 
generally differs from Subpart N. The 
safety factors in ANSI B30.5–1968 and 
SAE J959–1966 that are incorporated by 
reference in 29 CFR part 1926 subpart 
N are applicable to wire rope generally; 
those industry consensus standards do 
not separately address rotation resistant 
rope with respect to design factors. 

However, sections 5–5–1.7.1(c) and 

5–3.2.1.1(d) of ASME B30.5–2004 
generally designate a design factor of 5 
for the use of rotation resistant rope, 
reflecting the advances in technology 
that led the Committee to adopt a 
similar approach. Further, the 2004 
ASME standard allows for deviation 
from the design factor of 5, but in no 
case lower than 3.5, when certain 
specified procedures that are similar to 
procedures in proposed 
§ 1926.1414(c)(2)(iv) and further 
described in § 1926.1414(c)(3) are 
followed. 

Proposed paragraphs (c)(2)(i)–(iv) use 

the phrase ‘‘operating design factor.’’ 
‘‘Operating’’ has been included in this 
phrase to show that the factors specified 
in these proposed paragraphs are to 
reflect how the rope is installed on the 
specific piece of equipment in which it 
is used. In other words, the operating 
design factor is calculated based on 
numerous considerations associated 
with both the rope’s design and how it 
is installed on the equipment in which 
it will be used. 

The Committee recognized that 

limiting the use of a particular Type of 
rotation resistant rope by operating 

design factors (and, in some instances, 
by activity) is a new approach. 
However, the technological 
developments that have occurred since 
Subpart N was promulgated have led to 
a need to tailor use requirements and 
parameters to the different Types of 
rotation resistant rope. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(i) would 

prohibit Types II and III rotation 
resistant rope with an operating design 
factor of less than 5 from being used for 
duty cycle or repetitive lifts. The 
Committee believed that such ropes are 
inappropriate for this type of use, which 
subjects the rope to high levels of stress 
generally and/or concentrates wear in 
particular sections of the rope.41 

While not addressed in the current 

Subpart N, a similar limitation applies 
to rotation resistant rope (though not 
limited by Type) in section 5– 
3.2.1.1(d)(3) of ASME B30.5–2004. 

This prohibition would not apply to 
Type I rotation resistant rope because 
the Committee believed that it is 
significantly more resistant to rotation 
or torque compared with Types II and 
III. This reduces Type I’s potential for 
internal wear during use and moves 
degradation from the inner wires to the 
outer wires, where damage is more 
easily detected during wire rope 
inspections. Accordingly, the 
Committee concluded that Type I rope 
can safely be used for duty cycle and 
repetitive lifts at an operating design 
factor below 5 (but no less than 3.5), as 
specified in proposed 
1926.1414(c)(2)(ii). 

The Committee’s understanding of 

‘‘duty cycle’’ in this context is a 
continuous operation in which 
approximately the same type and weight 
of load is handled. For example, 
dredging with a clamshell is duty cycle 
work. ‘‘Repetitive lifts’’ refers to a 
continuous operation with loads that 
may vary in size and weight. For 
example, steel erection work typically 
involves repetitive lifts of various size 
and configurations of structural steel 
members. It is the Agency’s 
understanding that these definitions are 
widely understood in the industry. 
However, OSHA believes it is 
appropriate to include them in 
§ 1926.1401, Definitions, to avoid any 
misunderstanding as to their meaning in 
this standard. OSHA requests public 
comment on this issue. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(ii) would 
require that all rotation resistant ropes 

41 In contrast, where the operating design factor 

is 5 or greater, the Committee believed that core 
damage (which is difficult to detect) would not 
occur prior to the development of outer core 
damage. Consequently, its use for duty cycle or 
repetitive lifts would be safe.

have an operating design factor of no 
less than 3.5. As discussed above, some 
rotation resistant ropes—Types II and 
III—would have to have an operating 
design factor of no less than 5 when 
used for duty cycle or repetitive lifts. 
Apart from those uses, under proposed 
§ 1926.1414(c)(2)(ii), the lowest 
operating design factor that would be 
allowed for both Types II and III, as well 
as Type I, would be 3.5. 

This provision recognizes that the use 

of rotation resistant rope at operating 
design factors below 5 (but in no case 
below 3.5) is permissible, although 
proposed paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (discussed 
above), (iii) and (iv) would set 
limitations and conditions. The 
Committee was cognizant of the fact that 
section 5–3.2.1.1(d) of ASME B30.5– 
2004 also allows rotation resistant rope 
to be used at a design factor as low as 
3.5 under similarly restricted 
circumstances. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(iii) would 
require the operating design factor for 
Type I rotation resistant rope to be no 
less than 5 except where the wire rope 
manufacturer and the equipment 
manufacturer approve a different design 
factor in writing. (Note that, under 
proposed paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the 
operating design factor would be 
prohibited from being less than 3.5.) 
The Committee believed that, in light of 
the design of Type I rope, where there 
is approval for the operating design 
factor by both the wire rope 
manufacturer and equipment 
manufacturer, the use of the rope would 
be safe. 

The Committee considered concerns 
about the fact that, in the future, there 
may be many new Type I ropes on the 
market, and the manufacturer may not 
have tested them; this could lead to 
difficulty in obtaining manufacturer 
approval for an operating design factor 
less than 5. However, in the 
Committee’s judgment, the 
manufacturer’s expertise regarding the 
particular equipment is essential in this 
instance to ensure that use of such rope 
would be safe. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(2)(iv), 
Types II and III rotation resistant rope 
would be required to have an operating 
design factor of no less than 5 except 
when used for non-duty cycle and non- 
repetitive lifts, and where the 
requirements of § 1926.1414(c)(3)(i)— 
(iii) are met. When these exceptions 
apply, proposed § 1926.1414(c)(2)(ii) 
would prohibit the operating design 
factor from being less than 3.5. 

This proposed paragraph reflects the 

Committee’s belief that there is a greater 
likelihood of internal damage in Type II 
and Type III rotation resistant rope 

when used with an operating design 
factor lower than 5. However, the 
Committee’s view is that where the 
additional precautions in proposed 
§ 1926.1414(c)(3) are met, its use would 
be safe. 

As stated above, 29 CFR part 1926 

subpart N is dissimilar from this 
paragraph in that it does not contain a 
specific operating design factor for 
rotation resistant rope and does not 
otherwise differentiate between rotation 
resistant wire ropes. This provision is, 
however, similar to section 5–3.2.1.1(d) 
in ASME B30.5–2004 which, while not 
differentiating by ‘‘Type,’’ does allow 
the use of rotation resistant rope with an 
operating design factor of less than 5 
where conditions similar to those 
included in proposed § 1926.1414(c)(3) 
are instituted. 
Paragraph (c)(3) 

This proposed paragraph specifies 
additional requirements that must be 
met when Types II and III are used with 
an operating design factor of between 
3.5 and 5 (for non-duty cycle, non- 
repetitive lifts). The Committee believed 
that these additional requirements are 
needed to ensure that use of such ropes 
would be safe. 

Specifically, under proposed 

§ 1926.1414(c)(3)(i), an inspection of the 
rope by a qualified person in accordance 
with § 1926.1413(a) would be required, 
with its use allowed only if that person 
determines there are no deficiencies 
constituting a hazard (with the presence 
of more than one broken wire in any one 
rope lay considered a hazard). Because 
of the lower operating design factor of 
these ropes, the Committee believed that 
the expertise of a qualified person is 
needed to ensure that there are no 
deficiencies that constitute a hazard. 
Similarly, even one broken wire in any 
one rope lay would be considered a 
hazard. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(3)(ii), 
operations would have to be conducted 
in a manner and at speeds that 
minimize dynamic effects. Dynamic 
effects are the additional forces exerted 
on the rope due to dynamics like 
acceleration and deceleration. Such 
effects need to be minimized because 
they increase the stress on the rope. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(3)(iii), 
each lift would have to be documented 
in the monthly and annual inspection 
records, with such use to be considered 
by the qualified person in allowing 
subsequent use of the rope. The 
Committee considered this an important 
step because the more times the rope is 
used, the greater the likelihood that 
degradation would have occurred. 
Requiring each such lift to be

documented in the monthly and annual 
inspection records would ensure that 
this information is available to the 
qualified person when that person 
makes his or her inspections and 
assessments under proposed 
§ 1926.1414(c)(3)(i) and (ii). 
Paragraph (c)(4) Additional 
Requirements for Rotation Resistant 
Rope for Boom Hoist Reeving 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(i) would 
prohibit rotation resistant rope from 
being used for boom hoist reeving 
except where the requirements of 
proposed § 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii) are met. 
Currently, Subpart N, through its 
incorporation by reference of section 5– 
1.7.2 of ANSI B30.5–1968, prohibits the 
use of rotation resistant rope for boom 
hoist reeving under all circumstances. 
This prohibition reflects the fact that 
rotation resistant rope used for boom 
hoist reeving tends to twist and thereby 
suffer internal damage when it passes 
over sheaves that are close together. 
In reviewing this prohibition, the 

Committee noted that this problem is 
reduced when load hoists using rotation 
resistant rope are used as boom hoists 
for attachments such as luffing 
attachments or boom and mast 
attachment systems because the sheaves 
are not as close together in these 
applications and the twisting forces are 
therefore lower. 

The Committee concluded that safety 

would not be compromised in such 
circumstances as long as the conditions 
in proposed § 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii) were 
met. The Committee also believed that 
the exception would serve a practical 
purpose, especially when using 
attachments such as luffing jibs. The 
auxiliary hoist is typically used as a 
boom hoist for such attachments, and is 
normally rigged with rotation resistant 
rope. The exception enables the 
employer to avoid the need to change 
the rope when using such attachments 
when safety could be assured by 
meeting the specified conditions for its 
use. Note that section 5–1.7.2 of ASME 
B30.5–2004 also allows rotation 
resistant rope to be used for boom hoist 
reeving when conditions similar to 
those in proposed § 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii) 
are met. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(c)(4)(ii)(A), the drum must have a first 
layer rope pitch diameter of not less 
than 18 times the nominal diameter of 
the rope used. A first layer rope pitch 
diameter less than that could damage 
the rope. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(c)(4)(ii)(B), the requirements of 
§ 1926.1426(a) and (b) would have to be

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

met.42 Section 1926.1426(a) prohibits 
boom free fall for equipment 
manufactured prior to October 31, 1984 
and restricts the circumstances under 
which a free falling boom may be used 
for equipment manufactured before that 
date. By saying that paragraph 1426(a) 
applies ‘‘irrespective of the date of 
manufacture,’’ proposed 
§ 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii)(B) makes clear that, 
when rotation resistant rope is used for 
boom hoist reeving, boom free fall is 
prohibited for all equipment under all 
circumstances. The reference to 
§ 1926.1426(b) requires the boom hoist 
to have a secondary mechanism to 
prevent free fall in the event the primary 
system fails. These provisions would 
prevent the rope from being subjected to 
the shock load forces that would occur 
in a boom free fall when the rope arrests 
the fall. 

The C–DAC draft of proposed 

paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) incorporated by 
reference the provisions in ASME 
B30.5–2004 at sections 5–1.3.2(a), (a)(2) 
through (a)(4), and (b) through (d).43 
(Note that, at the time the C–DAC 
document was completed, the most 
current version of ANSI/ASME B30.5 
was the 2000 version. Since that time 
the 2004 version has been issued. The 
referenced provisions are identical in 
both versions). 

These provisions of section 5–1.3.2 
(load hoist mechanisms) of the ASME 
standard provide: 
* 
* 

* 

* 

* 

(a) Load Hoist Drums. The load hoist drum 
assemblies shall have power and operational 
characteristics sufficient to perform all load 
lifting and lowering functions required in 
crane service when operated under 
recommended conditions. 
* 
* 

* 

* 

* 

(2) Load hoist drums shall have rope 

capacity with the recommended rope size 
and reeving to perform crane service within 
the range of boom lengths, operating radii, 
and vertical lifts specified by the 
manufacturer. 

(a) No less than two full wraps of rope 

shall remain on the drum when the hook is 
in the extreme low position. 

(b) The drum end of the rope shall be 

anchored to the drum by an arrangement 
specified by the crane or rope manufacturer. 

(c) The drum flange shall extend a 

minimum of 1/2 inch (13 mm) over the top 
layer of rope at all times. 

(3) The load hoist drums shall provide a 

first layer rope pitch diameter of not less than 
18 times the nominal diameter of the rope 
used. 

42 The C–DAC Document referred to 

§ 1926.1426(b) and (c). C–DAC’s intent clearly was 
to refer to § 1926.1426(a) and (b), and OSHA has 
corrected the text accordingly. 

43 The Committee determined that the 

incorporated provisions were sufficiently clear and 
enforceable for use as OSHA requirements.

(4) A means controllable from the 

operator’s station shall be provided to hold 
the drum from rotating in the lowering 
direction and be capable of holding the rated 
load without further action by the operator. 
Foot-operated brakes having a continuous 
mechanical linkage between the actuating 
and braking means, capable of transmitting 
full braking force and equipped with a 
positive mechanical means to hold the 
linkage in the applied position, meet this 
requirement. 
* 
* 

* 

* 

* 

(b) Load Hoist Brakes. 
(1) When power-operated brakes having no 

continuous mechanical linkage between the 
actuating and braking means are used for 
controlling loads, an automatic means shall 
be provided to set the brake, to prevent the 
load from falling in the event of loss of brake 
control power. 

(2) Foot-operated brake pedals shall be 

constructed so that the operator’s feet, when 
in proper position, will not slip off, and a 
means shall be provided for holding the 
brakes in the applied position without 
further action by the operator. 

(c) Power Controlled Lowering. When 
provided, a power-controlled lowering 
system shall be capable of handling rated 
loads and speeds as specified by the 
manufacturer. Such a system is 
recommended to assist in precision lowering 
and to reduce demand on the load brake. 

(d) Cylinders with Rope Reeving. Cranes 

using a load hoist mechanism with hydraulic 
cylinder(s) and rope reeving shall have 
power and operational characteristics 
sufficient to perform all load lifting and 
lowering functions required in crane service 
when operated under recommended 
conditions. Sheaves used in multiple rope 
reeving shall have a pitch diameter not less 
than 16 times the nominal diameter of the 
rope and shall comply with para. 5–1.7.4. 
Upon reviewing these provisions, 

OSHA believes that two changes need to 
be made to the incorporation 
recommended by C–DAC. First, the 
second sentence of section 5–1.3.2(c) is 
stated as a recommendation rather than 
a mandatory requirement. OSHA 
believes it would be confusing to 
incorporate a non-mandatory 
recommendation into this standard. 
Therefore, rather than incorporating that 
provision by reference, OSHA is adding 
a new paragraph (G) to 
§ 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii) that incorporates 
only the mandatory first sentence of 
section 5–1.3.2(c) of ASME B30.5: 
‘‘When provided, a power-controlled 
lowering system shall be capable of 
handling rated loads and speeds as 
specified by the manufacturer.’’ 

The second change pertains to the 
final sentence of section 5–1.3.2(d) of 
ASME B30.5. That sentence’s 
requirement of a minimum pitch 
diameter of 16 times the nominal 
diameter of the rope varies from the 
requirement of proposed 

§ 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii)(D), discussed next, 
that the minimum pitch diameter be 18 
times the rope’s nominal diameter. The 
variation is due to the fact that section 
1.3.2(d) of ASME B30.5 does not apply 
solely to rotation resistant rope, as does 
this paragraph. Although it is possible 
to comply with a minimum pitch 
diameter of both 16 and 18 times the 
nominal diameter of the rope by 
adhering to the value of 18, OSHA 
believes it would be confusing to 
include requirements giving both 
values. Accordingly, OSHA is 
modifying the incorporation by 
reference recommended by C–DAC so 
that, in this proposed rule, 
§ 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii)(C) reads as follows: 

The requirements in ASME B30.5–2004 

Section 5–1.3.2 (a), (a)(2)–(a)(4), (b), and (d), 
except that the minimum pitch diameter for 
sheaves used in multiple rope reeving is 18 
times the nominal diameter of the rope used 
instead of the value of 16 specified in section 
5–1.3.2(d). 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) 

provides that all sheaves used in the 
boom hoist reeving system shall have a 
rope pitch diameter of not less than 18 
times the nominal diameter of the rope 
used. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(E) 

provides that the operating design factor 
of the boom hoist reeving system shall 
be not less than five. In this paragraph 
and the next one as well, OSHA has 
changed the C–DAC term ‘‘design 
factor’’ to ‘‘operating design factor.’’ 
OSHA made this change so that the 
terminology in these two paragraphs 
would be consistent with that in 
proposed paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of 
this section. OSHA requests public 
comment on whether there is any reason 
for using different terminology in 
proposed § 1926.1414(c)(4)(ii)(E) and (F) 
than in proposed § 1926.1414(c)(2) and 
(3). 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(F) 

provides that the operating design factor 
for these ropes shall be the total 
minimum breaking force of all parts of 
rope in the system divided by the load 
imposed on the rope system when 
supporting the static weights of the 
structure and the crane rated load. The 
purpose of this provision is to ensure 
that the methodology for computing the 
operating design factors is clear and the 
operating design factor requirements 
specified in the proposed standard 
achieve their intended effect. 
Paragraph 1414(d) 

Proposed paragraph (d) would require 

that wire rope clips used with wedge 
sockets be attached to the unloaded 
dead end of the rope; however, the 
provision also permits the use of

devices specifically designed for dead- 
ending rope in a wedge socket. The 
Committee believed that this provision 
is necessary to ensure attachment 
strength, reliability and prevention of 
cable damage. 
Paragraph 1414(e) 

Proposed paragraph (e) states that 

socketing shall be done in the manner 
specified by the manufacturer of the 
wire rope or fitting. This is a clearer 
version of the provision in section 5– 
1.7.2b of ANSI B30.5–1968, which refers 
to the manner specified by the 
manufacturer of the assembly. 
Paragraph 1414(f) 

Proposed paragraph (f) specifies that 

prior to cutting wire rope, seizings must 
be placed on each side of the point to 
be cut, with the length and number of 
seizings determined in accordance with 
the wire rope manufacturer’s 
instructions. Seizings are needed to 
hold the wire in the strands and the 
strands in place during handling while 
cutting. This keeps the rope beyond the 
area of the cut intact. This provision 
differs from both section 5.2.4.3(c) of 
ANSI B30.5–1968 (incorporated by 
reference into 29 CFR part 1926 Subpart 
N) and from section 5–2.4.4(c) of ASME 
B30.5–2004, which set forth specific 
seizing requirements based upon 
whether the rope is preformed and the 
rope’s diameter. 

In Committee’s experience, the 

instructions and procedures for seizing 
differ among various wire rope 
manufacturers. It concluded that the 
most appropriate approach would be to 
require that, beyond specifying that 
seizings be placed on each side of the 
point to be cut, which is always 
necessary, the length and number of 
seizings be in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The 
Committee decided to require 
employers to follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions because it believed that 
wire rope manufacturers have the 
knowledge and expertise to best 
determine the length and number of 
seizings that are needed to maintain the 
integrity of their wire ropes during 
cutting. 
Section 1415 Safety Devices 

This section sets forth the proposed 
requirements for equipping cranes and 
derricks with certain safety devices. 

The safety devices addressed by this 

section are devices that C–DAC believed 
are essential for the safe operation of 
cranes and derricks and therefore, 
required to be present and in proper 
working order during all equipment 
operations with no alternative measures

permitted. Those devices considered 
less critical to equipment safety are 
designated as operational aids and are 
governed by proposed § 1926.1416. That 
section allows for equipment to 
continue operating if the operational aid 
fails or malfunctions but requires 
certain temporary alternative protective 
measures in such cases. Those devices 
designated as safety devices in this 
section are so essential and integral to 
safe equipment operation that C–DAC 
determined that there is no acceptable 
alternative to having them in proper 
working order. 
Paragraph 1415(a) Safety Devices 

Proposed paragraph (a) lists the safety 

devices that would be required on all 
equipment covered by this Subpart and 
any specifications and conditions 
applicable to those devices (including 
the exemption of certain equipment 
from the requirements of the listed 
devices). 

Crane Level Indicator: Proposed 

paragraph (a)(1) would require that a 
crane level indicator be on all 
equipment covered under this subpart. 
The Agency is proposing this 
requirement based upon the 
Committee’s belief that level equipment 
is a key factor in ensuring crane and 
derrick safety. Using a crane level 
indicator is necessary because it has the 
requisite accuracy for leveling the 
equipment. C–DAC members stressed 
the need to use a crane level indicator 
because, if the equipment is not 
properly leveled, it will not have all the 
capacities indicated in the load charts. 
Reliance on the charts in such situations 
could cause the equipment to overturn 
or otherwise fail. 

C–DAC discussions also raised two 

significant issues in applying the (a)(1) 
requirement. First, as stated in 
§ 1926.1415(a)(1)(i), the proposal 
specifies that a crane level indicator 
must either be built into the equipment 
or available on it. The Committee 
believed that either option accomplishes 
the purpose of enabling the employer to 
determine if the equipment is level. 
Second, as covered in 
§ 1926.1415(a)(1)(ii), the Committee 
believed that tagging out or removing 
deficient built-in crane level indicators 
is necessary. This provision addresses 
the hazard posed by false readings. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) would 

exempt portal cranes,44 derricks, 

floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons, 
vessels, or other means of flotation from 
the requirements of § 1926.1415(a)(1). 
C–DAC members indicated that these 
types of equipment are leveled upon 
installation and then fixed in place, 
precluding the need for a crane level 
indicator.45 

Boom Stops: Proposed paragraph 

(a)(2) requires boom stops on all 
equipment except for derricks and 
hydraulic booms. ‘‘Boom stop’’ is 
defined in proposed § 1926.1401 as a 
device that restricts the boom from 
moving above a certain maximum angle 
and toppling over backwards. This 
definition is derived from the SC&RF 
Handbook. The term includes all 
devices that meet the definition, 
including boom stops, (belly straps with 
struts/standoff), telescoping boom stops, 
attachment boom stops, and backstops. 
As the definition indicates, a boom stop 
is needed to prevent a boom from 
tipping backwards past its designed 
range during equipment operations. 
Several Committee members suggested 
exempting certain older equipment from 
being retrofitted with boom stops. 
However, C–DAC concluded that the 
significant safety issue at stake and the 
fact that installing boom stops is not 
technically difficult justify requiring 
them on older equipment. 

As noted above, the Agency proposes 
to exempt derricks and hydraulic cranes 
from the requirements of 
1926.1415(a)(2). The derrick boom 
overturn issue is covered in proposed 
1926.1436(f)(2). Hydraulic cranes are 
exempted because these cranes contain 
the equivalent function of boom stops in 
that the hydraulic cylinder physically 
prevents the boom from moving 
backward past its designed range. 

Jib Stops: ‘‘Jib stop’’ is defined in 

§ 1926.1401 as the same type of device 
as a boom stop but used for a fixed or 
luffing jib. The definition notes that the 
device is also referred to as a ‘‘jib 
backstop.’’ Proposed § 1926.1415(a)(3) 
would require jib stops on all 
equipment where a jib is attached, 
except for derricks. Jib stops perform the 
same function for jibs as boom stops 
perform for booms, and are similarly 
necessary. The proposal exempts 
derricks from this requirement because 
jibs are not installed on derricks. 

Foot Pedal Brake Locks: Proposed 
paragraph (a)(4) would require that 
equipment with foot pedal brakes have 

44 Proposed § 1926.1401 defines ‘‘portal cranes’’ 

as a type of crane consisting of a rotating 
upperstructure, hoist machinery, and boom 
mounted on top of a structural gantry which may 
be fixed in one location or have travel capability. 
The gantry legs or columns usually have portal 

openings in between to allow passage of traffic 
beneath the gantry. 

45 Note that, under proposed § 1926.1437(e), a 

pontoon or barge/vessel list and trim device would 
be required for floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes/derricks.

locks, except for portal cranes and 
floating cranes. Such locks are needed 
to prevent the unintentional 
disengagement of a foot pedal brake, 
which could lead to unintended 
equipment movement and consequent 
injuries and fatalities. Due to the 
physical effort needed to keep the pedal 
engaged, this is particularly important 
where the brake is applied for long 
periods of time. 

The rationale for exempting portal 
cranes and floating cranes from this 
requirement discussed by the 
Committee was that there are instances 
in which, due to the pitching of a 
floating crane and the pitching of the 
vessel or object in the water with which 
a portal crane works, the operator may 
have to immediately release the brake. 
The concern is that, if the foot pedal 
brake lock had been activated, the 
operator may not be able to release the 
brake quickly enough in such a situation 
to prevent the equipment from being 
overloaded or to prevent unintended 
movement of the load. 

Upon review of the exemption in the 
provision, the Agency has realized that 
C–DAC assumed that the locking device 
would in all cases be of the type that is 
located on the brake pedal. That type of 
device can be difficult to disengage, 
thereby delaying the operator’s ability to 
release the brake. However, it is OSHA’s 
understanding that there are other types 
of brake locking mechanisms that do not 
present this problem (for example, a 
brake lock that is hand-actuated). It 
therefore appears that the exemption 
may not be needed.46 The Agency 
requests public comment on changing 
proposed paragraph § 1926.1415(a)(4) by 
deleting the exemption and requiring a 
hoist brake locking mechanism for all 
cranes. 

Integral Holding Device/Check Valve: 
Proposed paragraph (a)(5) would require 
that hydraulic outrigger jacks have an 
integral holding device/check valve. 
Such a device is necessary to prevent 
the outrigger jack from collapsing in the 
event of a hydraulic failure. 

Rail Clamps and Rail Stops: Proposed 

paragraph (a)(6) specifies that 
equipment on rails have rail clamps and 
rail stops, except for portal cranes. A 
rail clamp restricts the equipment from 
lifting off the rails. The rail stop 
prevents the equipment from moving 
further than a specific point on the rails. 
Portal cranes are exempt from the 
requirements of § 1926.1415(a)(6) 
because these cranes typically are 

46 OSHA notes that ASME B30.8–2004, ‘‘Floating 

Cranes and Floating Derricks,’’ section 8–1.6.2(l), 
applies to load hoists and reads as follows: ‘‘Foot- 
operated brake pedals * * * shall be equipped with 
a means for latching in the applied position.’’

equipped with a parking brake that 
provides the equivalent function of 
preventing the crane from 
unintentionally moving along the rails. 
Paragraph 1415(b) Proper Operation 
Required 

Proposed paragraph (b) would 

prohibit the operation of the equipment 
if any of the safety devices listed in this 
section are not in proper working order. 
This paragraph reflects the Committee’s 
belief, discussed above, that proper 
operation of these devices is critical to 
safe use of the equipment. 
Section 1416 Operational Aids 

This section sets forth the proposed 
requirements for equipping cranes and 
derricks with certain operational aids. 
‘‘Operational aids’’ are defined in 
§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘devices that assist the 
operator in the safe operation of the 
crane by providing information or 
automatically taking control of a crane 
function. These include, but are not 
limited to, the devices listed in 
§ 1926.1416 (‘listed operational aids’).’’ 
This definition is similar to that in 
section 5–0.2.2 of ASME B30.5–2004. 

As discussed above in regard to 

proposed § 1926.1415, the Committee 
believed that the devices addressed in 
§ 1926.1416 enhance safety. However, 
they are less essential to the safe 
operation of equipment than the safety 
devices addressed by § 1926.1415 
because of the availability of 
alternatives that are sufficient on a 
temporary basis. The temporary 
alternative measures are precautions 
that were historically used prior to the 
widespread availability and use of these 
operational aids. 
Paragraphs 1416(a) and (b) 

Under proposed paragraphs (a) and 

(b), operational aids would be required 
on all equipment unless otherwise 
specified, and would have to be in 
proper working order unless the 
employer uses specified temporary 
alternative protection. Section 
1926.1416(b) provides that if the 
crane/derrick manufacturer specifies 
more protective alternative measures 
than those listed in the standard, the 
employer would be required to follow 
them. 

Committee discussions of these 

provisions primarily focused on the use 
of manufacturer procedures as 
temporary alternative measures. The 
Committee considered recommending 
that the Agency require employers to 
follow any temporary alternative 
measures specified by the equipment 
manufacturer in addition to those 
required by this proposal. However, 

instead of requiring additional 
measures, the Committee decided that 
employers should be required to rely 
solely on measures specified by the 
manufacturer but only if those measures 
are more protective than those specified 
in the standard. 
Paragraph 1416(c) 

Proposed paragraph (c) states that if a 

listed operational aid stops working 
properly during operations, the operator 
shall safely stop operations until the 
temporary alternative measures are 
implemented or the device is again 
working properly. It further provides 
that, if a replacement part is no longer 
available, a substitute device that 
performs the same type of function may 
be used, and the use of such a device 
is not considered a modification under 
proposed § 1926.1434, Equipment 
modifications. Section 1926.1434 
applies to modifications or additions 
which affect the capacity or safe 
operation of the equipment unless 
certain steps are taken to have the 
modifications or additions approved. 

The Committee believed that it is 

unnecessary to apply § 1926.1434 to the 
use of a substitute operational aid 
because, as long as the substitute device 
works properly, its use will not affect 
the capacity or safe operation of the 
equipment. 
Paragraph 1416(d) Category I 
Operational Aids and Alternative 
Measures 

The proposal splits operational aids 

into two categories, with different 
amounts of time permitted for 
temporary alternative measures to be 
used in place of the listed operational 
aids. Category I operational aids, which 
are addressed by proposed paragraph 
(d), would set a 7-day time limit for 
repairing the deficient aid, and Category 
II, addressed below under proposed 
paragraph (e), has a 30-day time limit. 
The allowance of a 30-day time period 
for Category II operational aids reflects 
the Committee’s belief that these aids 
are less critical to equipment safety than 
those in Category I. 

Both Category I and II would have an 
exception to the repair time limits. For 
Category I, if the employer documents 
that it has ordered the necessary part 
within 7 days of the occurrence of the 
deficiency, the repair would have to be 
completed within 7 days of receipt of 
the part. For Category II, if the employer 
documents that it has ordered the 
necessary part within 7 days of the 
occurrence of the deficiency and the 
part is not received in time to complete 
the repair in 30 days, the repair shall be 
completed within 7 days of receipt of

the part. The Committee believed that 
these time frames set limitations that are 
both feasible and reflective of the 
amount of time that it is appropriate to 
rely on the alternative measures in each 
category. 

During the SBREFA Panel process, 

one Small Entity Representative stated 
that an extended period of time might 
be required to determine the appropriate 
part number for older equipment and 
that it might therefore not be possible to 
order a replacement within 7 days. 
OSHA solicits public comment on the 
extent to which this is a problem. OSHA 
further seeks comment on how to 
accommodate a situation in which 
ordering a replacement part is hindered 
because the part number is not readily 
available. For example, would a parts 
supplier be able to furnish the correct 
part if the type of device (e.g., boom 
hoist limiting device) and the model of 
the crane are provided? 

The SBREFA Panel also questioned 

whether the number of ‘‘days’’ for 
ordering parts and completing repairs 
for operational aids refers to calendar 
days or business days. Absent a 
different definition in the standard, 
OSHA interprets the word ‘‘days’’ to 
mean ‘‘working days’’ which, as 
discussed above in relation to proposed 
§ 1926.1407(e), would mean Mondays 
through Fridays, excluding federal 
holidays. OSHA solicits public 
comment on whether a different 
definition of ‘‘days’’ should apply under 
this section. 

Proposed paragraph (d) lists the 

required Category I operational aids and 
the acceptable temporary alternative 
measures for these aids. 

Boom Hoist Limiting Device: 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1) would 
require that all equipment manufactured 
after December 16, 1969 have a boom 
hoist limiting device. As defined in 
§ 1926.1401, a boom hoist limiting 
device disengages boom hoist power 
when the boom reaches a predetermined 
operating angle and also sets brakes or 
closes valves to prevent the boom from 
lowering after power is disengaged. This 
definition is taken from the SC&RF 
Handbook. Section 1926.1401 also 
explains that the term ‘‘boom hoist 
limiting device’’ includes boom hoist 
disengaging device, boom hoist shutoff, 
boom hoist disconnect, boom hoist 
hydraulic relief, boom hoist kick-outs, 
automatic boom stop device, or 
derricking limiter. A boom hoist 
limiting device automatically prevents 
the boom hoist from pulling the boom 
past the minimum allowable radius 
(maximum boom angle). If the boom 
were to be pulled past that point, a 
failure is likely (for example, the boom

could buckle from being forced against 
the boom stop). 

The December 16, 1969 date reflects 
the effective date of ANSI B30.5–1968. 
This was the first national consensus 
standard to require a boom hoist 
limiting device, and the Committee 
regarded that date as a reasonable 
indicator of when the industry began 
widely manufacturing or equipping 
cranes and derricks with such devices. 
Although the ANSI standard was only 
applicable to crawler, locomotive, and 
truck cranes, the Committee 
recommended extending this provision 
to all equipment based on prevailing 
industry practice. 

The Agency is also proposing three 

temporary alternative measures 
[§ 1926.1416(d)(1)(A)–(C)], of which the 
employer must use at least one upon 
malfunction of the boom hoist limiting 
device. These are: Use of a boom angle 
indicator; clearly marking the boom 
hoist cable at a point that will give the 
operator sufficient time to stop the hoist 
to keep the boom within the minimum 
allowable radius; and, if a spotter is 
used, clearly marking the boom hoist 
cable at a point that will give the spotter 
sufficient time to signal the operator and 
have the operator stop the hoist to keep 
the boom within the minimum 
allowable radius. C–DAC recommended 
these measures because historically they 
were used by employers prior to the 
development of the boom hoist limiting 
device. This paragraph further proposes 
requiring these measures on a 
permanent basis for those employers 
operating equipment manufactured on 
or before December 16, 1969 and not 
originally equipped with a boom hoist 
limiting device. 

Luffing Jib Limiting Device: Proposed 

paragraph (d)(2) would require that 
equipment with a luffing jib have a 
luffing jib limiting device. As defined in 
§ 1926.1401, a luffing jib limiting device 
is similar to a boom hoist limiting 
device, except that it limits the 
movement of the luffing jib. C–DAC 
indicated that these two devices 
function similarly and are distinguished 
only as to the type of crane extension 
each is automatically designed to limit: 
The jib versus the boom. The temporary 
alternative measures for a luffing jib 
limiting device are the same as those 
proposed for a boom hoist limiting 
device in § 1926.1416(d)(1)(i)(A)–(C). 

Anti Two-Blocking Device: Proposed 

paragraph (d)(3) sets forth the 
requirements for anti two-blocking 
devices. ‘‘Two blocking’’ is defined in 
§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘a condition in which a 
component that is uppermost on the 
hoist line such as the load block, hook 
block, overhaul ball, or similar 

component, comes in contact with the 
boom tip, fixed upper block or similar 
component. This binds the system and 
continued application of power can 
cause failure of the hoist rope or other 
component.’’ This definition is derived 
from the SC&RF Handbook. As the 
definition indicates, two-blocking can 
result in the crane dropping the load, 
the headache ball, or another 
component, creating an extreme hazard 
to employees below. An anti two- 
blocking device has been required by 
§ 1926.550(g)(3)(ii)(C) when hoisting 
personnel since October 3, 1988 but is 
not otherwise required under 29 CFR 
part 1926 subpart N. The Committee 
believed that expanding the use of anti 
two-blocking devices beyond hoisting 
personnel is needed to help reduce the 
number of crane-related injuries and 
fatalities. 

Anti two-block devices are 

manufactured in two forms: As an 
automatic prevention device or as a 
warning device. The automatic 
prevention device automatically stops 
two blocking from occurring. The 
warning device warns the operator 
when two blocking is about to occur. 
C–DAC members agreed that the 
automatic prevention anti two-block 
device provides better protection for 
employees, since it automatically stops 
two-blocking. As discussed below, the 
proposed standard would ultimately 
require automatic prevention devices on 
all equipment under a phase-in 
schedule. In drafting the schedule, 
C–DAC took account of the date the 
national consensus standard, ANSI 
B30.5, began to require such devices for 
telescopic boom cranes and the fact that 
B30.5 has continued to allow lattice 
boom cranes to be equipped with either 
prevention devices or warning devices. 

Effective February 28, 1992, ASME 
B30.5 required automatic prevention 
devices on telescopic boom cranes. At 
the same time, for lattice boom cranes, 
ASME B30.5 required two-block 
protection but allowed greater 
flexibility, requiring them to be 
equipped with either automatic 
prevention devices or warning devices. 
The additional protection required for 
telescopic boom cranes in the ASME 
standard reflects the fact that such 
cranes are more likely to two-block 
because telescoping the boom out (an 
action that does not occur with lattice 
boom cranes) moves the boom’s block 
closer to the load end of the hoist cable, 
which can cause two-blocking. 

Because February 28, 1992, is the date 
that ASME B30.5 first required anti two- 
block devices on telescopic boom cranes 
and the industry first began widely 
manufacturing or equipping such cranes

59788 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

with such devices, proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d)(3)(i) would require 
automatic prevention devices on all 
telescopic boom cranes manufactured 
after February 28, 1992. However, 
because ASME B30.5 has allowed lattice 
boom cranes to have either a warning 
device or an automatic prevention 
device since February 28, 1992, 
proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3)(ii)(A) 
similarly would give employers the 
option of using either device on lattice 
boom cranes manufactured between 
February 28, 1992 and one year after the 
effective date of this standard. 

As noted above, C–DAC believed that 
the automatic prevention device offers 
better protection than the warning 
device. Therefore, to ensure that future 
cranes are equipped with the preferable 
automatic prevention device, the 
proposal would require lattice boom 
cranes manufactured more than one 
year after the effective date of this 
standard to be equipped with an 
automatic prevention device. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C) 

excludes lattice boom equipment used 
during certain activities from the anti 
two-block requirements of 
§ 1926.1416(d)(3)(A) and (B). The 
provision would exempt lattice boom 
equipment when used for dragline, 
clamshell (grapple), magnet, drop ball, 
concrete bucket, and pile driving work 
because these operations involve heavy 
repetitive motion, and currently 
manufactured anti-two block devices 
used during these activities consistently 
malfunction (that is, the device ‘‘trips’’ 
even though a two-block has not 
occurred) and are frequently damaged. 
Lattice boom equipment used during 
marine operations generally would be 
exempt because the constant movement 
of the barge tends to damage the device. 
Similarly, lattice boom equipment used 
during container handling work in 
construction would be exempted 
because this activity typically involves 
hoisting containers to and from ships.47 

However, note that proposed 

paragraph 1437(f)(1) would require anti 
two-block devices on floating cranes/ 
derricks and land cranes/derricks on 
barges when hoisting personnel or 
hoisting over an occupied coffer dam or 
shaft. In those situations the exemption 
would not apply. The Agency believes 
that the need for anti two-block devices

47 In most situations hoisting containers would be 

regulated under 29 CFR part 1918; the proposed 
standard would apply to hoisting containers only 
where that activity is considered construction work. 
For example, hoisting a container of construction 
material from a ship onto a concrete pier that is part 
of a bridge construction project would be a 
construction activity and covered by this proposed 
standard. 

in such situations to prevent employees 
from being dropped, and to prevent a 
load from striking employees in the 
confined work environment of a coffer 
dam or shaft, outweighs any propensity 
for damage to the device or unnecessary 
‘‘tripping’’ during marine operations. 

For lattice boom cranes and derricks, 

the temporary alternative measure 
required when an anti two-block device 
malfunctions is to clearly mark the cable 
so that it can easily be seen by the 
operator at a point that will give the 
operator sufficient time to stop the hoist 
to prevent two-blocking, or use a spotter 
to warn the operator to stop the hoist. 

For telescopic boom cranes, the 

temporary alternative measure required 
would be to clearly mark the cable so 
that it can easily be seen by the operator 
at a point that will give the operator 
sufficient time to stop the hoist to 
prevent two-blocking and use a spotter 
when extending the boom. The 
Committee believed that the alternative 
measure for telescopic boom cranes 
needs to have the additional precaution 
of a spotter when extending the boom 
because in those cranes two-blocking 
can occur even when the cable hoist is 
not being operated. As noted above, 
telescoping the boom out moves the 
boom’s block closer to the load end of 
the hoist cable, which can cause two- 
blocking. A mark on the hoist cable in 
such instances would not warn the 
operator that two-blocking is about to 
occur. Therefore, when extending the 
boom, a spotter would also have to be 
used. 
Paragraph 1416(e) Category II 
Operational Aids and Alternative 
Measures 

Proposed paragraph (e) lists the 

required Category II operational aids 
and the acceptable temporary 
alternative measures for these aids. If 
these aids were to malfunction there 
would be a 30-day time limit for repair. 
If the employer documents it has 
ordered the necessary parts within 7 
days of the occurrence of the deficiency 
and the part is not received in time to 
complete the repair within 30 days, the 
repair would be required to be 
completed within 7 days of receipt of 
the part. 

Boom Angle or Radius Indicator: 

Proposed paragraph (e)(1) would require 
a boom angle or radius indicator 
readable from the operator’s station on 
all equipment. ‘‘Boom angle indicator’’ 
is defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a device 
which measures the angle of the boom 
relative to the horizontal.’’ This 
definition is taken from the SC&RF 
Handbook. Knowing the boom angle is 
necessary to accurately determine the 

crane’s capacity from its load chart. The 
temporary alternative would be to 
measure the radii or boom angle with a 
measuring device. 

Jib Angle Indicator: Proposed 

paragraph (e)(2) would require a jib 
angle indicator on all equipment with a 
luffing jib. The temporary alternative 
would be to measure the radii or jib 
angle with a measuring device. 

Boom Length Indicator: Proposed 

paragraph (e)(3) would require a boom 
length indicator on all equipment 
equipped with a telescopic boom. As 
defined in § 1926.1401, a boom length 
indicator ‘‘indicates the length of the 
permanent part of the boom (such as 
ruled markings on the boom) or, as in 
some computerized systems, the length 
of the boom with extensions/ 
attachments.’’ The length of the boom 
must be known because it affects the 
crane’s capacity as shown on the load 
chart. The temporary alternative would 
be one of the following: mark the boom 
with measured marks to calculate boom 
length; calculate boom length from 
boom angle and radius measurements; 
or measure the boom with a measuring 
device. 

Load Weighing and Similar Devices: 

Proposed paragraph (e)(4) would require 
load weighing and similar devices on all 
equipment with a rated capacity over 
6,000 pounds and manufactured after 
March 29, 2003, except derricks. (A 
comparable provision for derricks is in 
proposed § 1926.1436(f)(3), discussed 
below.) The framework of this proposed 
paragraph is similar to the approach 
taken in section 5–1.9.9.2 of ASME 
B30.5–2004 with respect to these aids. 
The framework permits employers to 
choose to outfit its equipment with 
either a load weighing device; load 
moment or rated capacity indicator; or 
a load moment or rated capacity limiter. 

Load moment (or rated capacity) 

indicator is defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a 
system which aids the equipment 
operator by sensing the overturning 
moment on the equipment, i.e., load 
multiplied by radius. It compares this 
lifting condition to the equipment’s 
rated capacity, and indicates to the 
operator the percentage of capacity at 
which the equipment is working. Lights, 
bells, or buzzers may be incorporated as 
a warning of an approaching overload 
condition.’’ This definition is derived 
from the SC&RF Handbook. 

Load moment (or rated capacity) 

limiter is defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a 
system which aids the equipment 
operator by sensing the overturning 
moment on the equipment, i.e., load 
multiplied by radius. It compares this 
lifting condition to the equipment’s 
rated capacity, and when the rated

capacity is reached, it shuts off power 
to those equipment functions which can 
increase the severity of loading on the 
equipment, e.g., hoisting, telescoping 
out, or luffing out. Typically, those 
functions which decrease the severity of 
loading on the equipment remain 
operational, e.g., lowering, telescoping 
in, or luffing in.’’ The proposal permits 
employers flexibility in choosing which 
device to employ because the 
Committee believed that all three 
devices will help ensure that the 
equipment does not exceed its capacity 
and tip over. 

This provision would be limited to 

equipment (other than derricks) 
manufactured after March 29, 2003. 
That was the date when ASME B30.5 
first called for all mobile cranes with a 
rated capacity over 6,000 pounds to be 
equipped with load weighing devices. It 
therefore reflects when the industry first 
began widely manufacturing or 
equipping cranes with load weighing or 
load moment devices. 

Each of these indicators makes it 

easier for the operator to ensure that the 
equipment is operated within its 
capacity. The proposed provision would 
therefore reduce the likelihood of 
injuries and fatalities from tip-over and 
other incidents resulting from operating 
equipment beyond its capacity. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5) would 

require two future operational aids—an 
outrigger position sensor/monitor and a 
hoist drum rotation indicator—on all 
equipment manufactured after January 
1, 2008. ‘‘Drum rotation indicator’’ is 
defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a device on 
a crane or hoist which indicates in 
which direction and at what relative 
speed a particular hoist drum is 
turning.’’ This definition is taken from 
the SC&RF Handbook. C–DAC believed 
that these aids will help ensure the safe 
operation of cranes but found that 
additional time is needed for the 
industry to develop them. 

The Committee also considered 

whether a third future operational aid— 
counterweight sensors—should be 
required on all equipment manufactured 
after January 1, 2008. Several Committee 
members representing crane 
manufacturers expressed concern as to 
the difficulty in developing a reliable 
counterweight sensor presently or in the 
near future. In light of these 
technological problems, the Committee 
did not include these. 
Section 1417 Operation 

Proposed § 1926.1417 addresses 

hazards associated with general 
operation of equipment covered by this 
standard. Currently, 29 CFR part 1926 
subpart N primarily addresses safe 

operation by incorporating national 
consensus standards and manufacturer 
recommendations. For example, 
§ 1926.550(b)(2) requires crawler, truck, 
and locomotive cranes to comply with 
the operation requirements of ANSI 
B30.5–1968. The provisions in this 
proposed section are designed to update 
such requirements, make them more 
comprehensive, and state them in a way 
that is clear and enforceable. 
Paragraph 1417(a) 

Currently, Subpart N requires 

employers to comply with 
manufacturers’ operational 
requirements for hammerhead tower 
cranes (§ 1926.550(c)(5)) and for floating 
cranes/derricks (§ 1926.550(f)(2)(iii)) but 
not for other types of equipment. 
Proposed § 1926.1417(a) would require 
employers to comply with the 
manufacturer procedures applicable to 
the operational functions of all 
equipment covered by this proposed 
standard, including the use of 
equipment with attachments. 

The Committee believed that the 
manufacturer has a high degree of 
expertise with respect to the capabilities 
and limitations of the equipment it has 
designed and built. Accidents can 
therefore be prevented by ensuring that 
the equipment is operated in a manner 
that is consistent with the 
manufacturer’s procedures. As noted in 
the discussion of the proposed 
definition of ‘‘procedures’’ in 
§ 1926.1401, the phrase ‘‘manufacturer 
procedures’’ is to be interpreted broadly 
to include all recommendations by the 
manufacturer regardless of the format of 
those recommendations. 
Paragraph 1417(b) Unavailable 
Operation Procedures 

Paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3). 

Currently, Subpart N has no provision 
for developing operational procedures 
where manufacturer procedures are not 
available. C–DAC believed that setting 
requirements to address these situations 
would help improve safety with respect 
to the operation of such equipment. 

‘‘Unavailable procedures’’ is defined 

in proposed § 1926.1401 as meaning 
procedures that are no longer available 
from the manufacturer, or have never 
been available from the manufacturer. 
C–DAC provided this definition so that 
employers would understand what 
constitutes unavailable procedures. For 
instance, procedures that are in the 
employer’s possession but are not on the 
job site, would not be considered 
unavailable under proposed 
§§ 1926.1417(b) and 1926.1441(c)(2), 
where the term is used. 

Under proposed paragraph (b)(1), in 

the event that the manufacturer 
procedures for operation are not 
available, the employer would be 
required to develop procedures 
necessary for the safe operation of the 
equipment and its attachments. The 
employer would also be required to 
ensure compliance with such 
procedures. 

For example, the manufacturers of 
some old equipment are no longer in 
business; procedures for that equipment 
are typically unavailable. Even where 
the original manufacturer became a part 
of another company that is still in 
business, in some cases the successor 
company no longer has the original 
manufacturers’ procedures for that 
equipment. In such instances the 
employer would be required to develop 
and follow substitute procedures. 

Proposed paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) 
would specify qualifications criteria for 
those who develop two aspects of the 
substitute procedures. Specifically, 
under proposed § 1926.1417(b)(2), 
procedures for the operational controls 
would have to be developed by a 
qualified person. As defined in 
§ 1926.1401 of this proposed standard, 
‘‘operational controls’’ are levers, 
switches, pedals and other devices for 
controlling equipment operation. The 
Committee believed that a high level of 
expertise is needed to develop such 
procedures in light of both the 
complexity of the factors that must be 
considered in developing such 
procedures and the critical nature of the 
operational controls. 

Under proposed paragraph (b)(3), 

operational procedures related to 
equipment capacity would have to be 
developed and signed by a registered 
professional engineer familiar with the 
equipment. The Committee believed 
that the type and complexity of 
engineering analysis that is needed to 
develop safe procedures related to 
capacity necessitates that this work be 
done by a registered professional 
engineer (RPE). In addition, because 
capacity is so critical to safe operation, 
the Committee believed that a signature 
by the RPE is needed to ensure that this 
work is done with the requisite care. 
Paragraph 1417(c) Accessibility of 
Procedures 

Paragraph (c)(1). This proposed 

paragraph would require employers to 
provide the operator with ready access 
in the cab to the procedures applicable 
to the operation of the equipment, 
including the following: Rated 
capacities (load charts), recommended 
operating speeds, special hazard

warnings, and the instructions and 
operator’s manual. 

For the purposes of this proposed 

standard, ‘‘special hazard warnings’’ are 
warnings of site-specific hazards (for 
example, proximity of power lines). C– 
DAC defines this term in proposed 
§ 1926.1401 to differentiate these site- 
specific warnings from all other general 
hazard warnings which are common to 
typical construction worksites. 

Currently, § 1926.550(a)(2) of Subpart 

N requires rated capacities, 
recommended operating speeds, and 
special hazard warnings to be posted on 
the equipment, and instructions and 
warnings to be visible at the operator’s 
station. Unlike § 1926.1417(c)(1) of this 
proposed standard, it does not require 
the operator’s manual to be accessible to 
the operator. 

The Committee believed that the 

information in these materials, 
including the operator’s manual, is 
essential for safe crane operation. It is 
needed to help the operator avoid 
performing operations beyond a crane’s 
capacity and recommended operating 
speed, and by increasing operator 
awareness of special hazards related to 
a specific piece of equipment. 

In addition, the Committee believed 

that this information needs to be 
available to the equipment operator in 
the cab so that the operator can obtain 
the information as the need arises. If the 
information were not available in the 
cab, operations would have to be 
delayed in order for the operator to 
leave the cab and obtain the information 
elsewhere (or for someone else to obtain 
them and bring them to the operator). 
The prospect of such a delay would 
serve as a disincentive to obtaining the 
information and increase the chance 
that operations would proceed without 
it, which could result in injuries or 
fatalities. 

Paragraph (c)(2). Subpart N does not 
address the issue of load capacities that 
are available only in electronic form. 
With the advancement of technology 
since 29 CFR part 1926 subpart N was 
promulgated, it has become increasingly 
common for equipment to be supplied 
by manufacturers with load capacities 
in electronic form. Because of the 
potential for an electronic or other 
failure to occur that would make that 
information inaccessible, C–DAC 
determined that it is necessary to 
establish requirements to address that 
problem. Proposed § 1926.1417(c)(2) 
establishes requirements to address a 
situation in which electronic or other 
failure makes such information 
unavailable. 

The Committee agreed that having the 

load capacities accessible to the 

operator in the cab is so important, due 
to this information’s direct relationship 
to preventing overloading, that 
operations need to shut down without 
them. Therefore, where load capacities 
are available in the cab only in 
electronic form and a failure makes the 
load capacities inaccessible, this 
proposed paragraph would require that 
the operator immediately cease 
operations or follow safe shut-down 
procedures until the load capacities 
become available again (in electronic or 
other form). 
Paragraph 1417(d) 

This proposed paragraph would 
require that operators refrain from 
engaging in any practice that would 
divert his or her attention while 
operating the crane. This would include 
the use of cell phones except when cell 
phones are used for signal 
communications. Operating a crane is a 
complex task that requires an operator’s 
full attention to be performed safely. 
This proposed paragraph addresses the 
risk that an accident can occur if the 
operator’s full attention is not directed 
toward that task. A similar provision is 
found in section 5–3.1.2 of ANSI B30.5– 
1968, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N, although it does 
not specifically reference the use of cell 
phones. 
Paragraph 1417(e) Leaving Equipment 
Unattended 

Paragraph (e)(1). Currently, under 29 
CFR part 1926 subpart N, the operator 
of a crawler, locomotive, or truck crane 
is prohibited from leaving the controls 
while a load is suspended.48 It is 
important for the operator to be at the 
controls for a variety of safety-related 
reasons. These include making 
necessary adjustments to keep the load 
in a safe position, moving the load 
where necessary for reasons of safety 
(such as for the safety of employees 
working with or near the load), and 
responding to emergencies that may 
arise during lifting operations. 

In the Committee’s experience, this 

requirement is routinely breached when 
the load is ‘‘held suspended,’’ that is, 
without need for adjustment of the 
load’s or the equipment’s position—for 
an extended period. In such 
circumstances, the operator does not 
manipulate the controls. 

In this type of circumstance, the 

Committee believed that greater safety 
could be achieved by developing criteria 

48 Section 5–3.2.4a. of ANSI B 30.5–1968, 

incorporated by reference in 29 CFR part 1926 
Subpart N at § 1926.550(b)(2), states, ‘‘The operator 
shall not leave his position at the controls while the 
load is suspended.’’ 

that allow the operator to leave the 
controls when it is safe to do so rather 
than to simply continue the existing 
rule unchanged. (Note that the 
suspension of working gear, such as 
slings, spreader bars, ladders, and 
welding machines, is addressed 
separately in proposed 
§ 1926.1417(e)(2)). 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that the operator not leave the 
controls while the load is suspended 
except when four conditions, outlined 
in proposed § 1926.1417(e)(1)(i) through 
(e)(1)(iv), are met. The conditions are as 
follows: 

Paragraph (e)(1)(i). The operator 

would be required to remain adjacent to 
the equipment and not engage in any 
other duties. This paragraph will not 
only prevent unauthorized use of the 
crane by persons who are not competent 
crane operators but also allow the 
operator to quickly access the controls 
in case the equipment or load 
inadvertently moves. 

Paragraph (e)(1)(ii). The load is to be 

held suspended for a period of time 
exceeding normal lifting operations. As 
explained above, these are instances 
when the load is ‘‘held suspended,’’ that 
is, without need for adjustment of the 
load’s or the equipment’s position—for 
an extended period. These are 
circumstances in which the operator 
will not need to manipulate the 
controls. Such circumstances must be 
for a period of time in excess of the 
periods that occur during normal lifting 
operations. 

For example, during the construction 

of a structure, a large subassembly is 
being attached to another part of the 
structure. After the subassembly has 
been initially connected, it is held 
suspended (that is, without need for 
adjustment of position) for support for 
a protracted period while the final 
connections are made. This period 
exceeds normal lifting operations. In 
this example, the criterion of proposed 
§ 1926.1417(e)(1)(ii) would be met. 

Another, contrasting example is the 

following: A steel structure is being 
erected. When installing the steel 
beams, the operator holds the beam 
suspended (typically for several 
minutes) while it is initially connected. 
Holding the beam suspended in such 
instances is a normal part of the steel 
erection process. In this example the 
criterion in proposed 
§ 1926.1417(e)(1)(ii) would not be met 
and the operator can not leave the 
controls. 

Paragraph (e)(1)(iii). The competent 
person would have to determine that it 
is safe for the operator to leave the 
controls and implement measures

necessary to restrain the boom hoist and 
telescoping, load, swing, and outrigger 
functions. This proposed provision 
addresses the hazard of inadvertent 
movement while the controls are 
unattended. 

Paragraph (e)(1)(iv). Barricades or 

caution lines, and notices would have to 
be erected to prevent all employees from 
entering the fall zone. Furthermore, 
under this proposed paragraph no 
employees would be permitted in the 
fall zone, including those listed in 
proposed § 1926.1425(b)(1) through (3), 
(d), or (e). The Committee concluded 
that this is necessary because the added 
margin of safety that results from the 
operator being at the controls would not 
be present in these circumstances. 

Paragraph (e)(2). As drafted, proposed 

§ 1926.1417(e)(2) reads: 

The provisions in paragraph (e) of this 

section do not apply to working gear (such 
as slings, spreader bars, ladders, and welding 
machines) where the load is not suspended 
over an entrance or exit. 

The Agency notes that the reference to 

‘‘§ 1926.1417(e)’’ is a drafting error and 
that the appropriate reference is to 
paragraph ‘‘§ 1926.1417(e)(1).’’ In 
addition, the provision currently 
contains two incidences of the word 
‘‘not’’ which could lead to confusion. 
Therefore, the Agency is considering 
changing the language to read as follows 
and requests comment on such a 
change: 

The provisions in § 1926.1417(e)(1) do not 

apply to working gear (such as slings, 
spreader bars, ladders, and welding 
machines) where the working gear is 
suspended over an area other than an 
entrance or exit. 

The Committee agreed on this 

paragraph with the understanding that 
employers frequently leave lightweight 
items such as slings, ladders, spreader 
bars, and welding machines suspended 
in the air overnight in order to prevent 
theft. These are items whose weight is 
negligible relative to the capacity of the 
equipment and whose size is small (the 
small size means that there will not be 
a significant sail effect and the rigging 
needed to attach the item to the hook is 
not complex). 

The Committee recognized that this 
practice is a safe practice as long as the 
working gear items are not suspended 
over an entrance or exit where 
employees could be exposed to falling 
object hazards. Thus, this paragraph 
would allow such items to be held 
suspended, without the operator at the 
controls, and without establishing the 
four conditions set forth in 
§ 1926.1417(e)(1)(i) through (iv), so long

as the gear is not suspended over an 
entrance or exit. 
Paragraph 1417(f) Tag-Out 

Paragraph 1417(f)(1). Tagging out of 

service equipment/functions. Where the 
employer has taken the equipment out 
of service, this proposed paragraph 
would require that the employer place 
a tag in the cab stating that the 
equipment is out of service and not to 
be used. Where the equipment remains 
in service but the employer has taken a 
function out of service, this proposed 
paragraph would require that the 
employer place a tag in a conspicuous 
position stating that that function is out 
of service and not to be used. This 
proposed paragraph is designed to 
prevent hazards associated with workers 
inadvertently attempting to use out-of- 
service equipment or a function that is 
out of service. 

Currently, section 5–2.3.2 of ANSI 

B30.5–1968, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N, requires ‘‘out of 
order’’ signs on crawler, locomotive and 
truck cranes undergoing maintenance. 
Unlike proposed 1926.1417(f)(1), 29 
CFR part 1926 subpart N does not 
address the situation where the 
equipment itself is in service but a 
function is out of service. 
Paragraph 1417(f)(2) Response to ‘‘Do 
Not Operate’’/Tag-Out Signs 

Paragraph 1417(f)(2)(i). If there is a 

warning sign on the equipment or 
starting control, proposed paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) would prohibit the operator 
from activating the switch or starting the 
equipment until the sign is removed by 
someone authorized to remove it or 
until the operator can verify that (A) no 
one is servicing, working on, or 
otherwise in a dangerous position on 
the machine, and (B) the equipment has 
been repaired and is working properly. 
Similarly, under proposed 
§ 1926.1417(f)(2)(ii), when there is a 
warning sign on any other switch or 
control, the operator would be 
prohibited from activating that switch or 
control until the sign has been removed 
by an individual authorized to remove 
it, or until the operator meets the two 
requirements of paragraph 
§ 1926.1417(f)(2)(i), described above. 

These provisions would prevent two 

types of hazards. First, since the 
machine is out of service, there is a risk 
that an employee servicing, working on, 
or otherwise in a dangerous position on 
it is not expecting it to be activated and 
would be injured if it were activated. 
Second, if an employee does not know 
that the equipment is malfunctioning or 
has a function that is not working 
properly, an employee could 

inadvertently try to operate it with the 
result that the equipment will not work 
as intended, causing unintended 
movement or a collapse. 

Subpart N addresses this issue 

through section 5–3.1.3g of ANSI B30.5– 
1968, which states: ‘‘If there is a 
warning sign on the switch or engine 
starting controls, the operator shall not 
close the switch or start the engine until 
the warning sign has been removed by 
the person placing it there.’’ Instead of 
requiring that the sign be removed by 
the person who placed it, proposed 
§ 1926.1417(f)(2) would permit it to be 
removed by an authorized person and, 
as an alternative, permit the operator to 
start the equipment after verifying that 
no worker is in a dangerous area and 
that the equipment has been repaired 
and is working properly. C–DAC 
believed that either alternative would 
achieve the safety purpose of the tag-out 
because it would ensure that a 
knowledgeable and responsible person, 
either the operator or another 
authorized person, verifies that repairs 
are complete and all workers are in a 
safe position before the equipment can 
be started. 

As discussed above, the operator 

would be permitted to start equipment 
that is tagged out or activate a tagged- 
out switch if the procedures specified in 
proposed § 1926.1417(f)(2)(i) are met. In 
reviewing this provision, the Agency 
noted that these procedures are not as 
comprehensive as those in the general 
industry standard for the control of 
hazardous energy (lockout/tagout), 
which are listed in § 1910.147(e)(3)(i) 
through (iii).49 The Agency requests 
public comment on whether procedures 
similar to those in paragraphs 
1910.147(e)(3)(i) through (iii) 50 would 
be feasible and appropriate for cranes/ 
derricks used in construction. 

Paragraph 1417(g). Before starting the 
engine, this proposed paragraph would 
require the operator to verify that all 
controls are in the proper starting 
position and that all personnel are in 
the clear. The Committee agreed that 
requiring operators to check that all 
controls are in their proper starting 
positions would prevent unintended 
movement of the equipment when the 

49 Section 1910.147 is not applicable to 

construction (see § 1910.147(a)(ii)(A)). 

50 These general industry provisions state: 
(i) Verification by the employer that the 

authorized employee who applied the device is not 
at the factory; 

(ii) Making all reasonable efforts to contact the 

authorized employee to inform him/her that his/her 
lockout or tagout device has been removed; and 

(iii) Ensuring that the authorized employee has 

this knowledge before he/she resumes work at that 
facility.

engine is initially started. Similarly, 
requiring operators to ensure that all 
personnel are in the clear is designed to 
prevent personnel from being injured in 
the event that some aspect of the 
equipment moves upon start-up. 
Currently, section 5–3.1.3h of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, incorporated by reference 
in 29 CFR part 1926 subpart N, contains 
a comparable requirement. 

Paragraph 1417(h). Storm warning. 
When a local storm warning has been 
issued, this proposed paragraph would 
require the competent person to 
determine whether it is necessary to 
implement manufacturer 
recommendations for securing the 
equipment. This provision was designed 
to prevent hazards that could arise from 
severe weather including inadvertent 
movement and crane collapse. High- 
speed winds in particular can affect 
both the crane and the load, reducing 
the rated capacity of the crane and 
affecting boom strength. Subpart N does 
not contain a corresponding 
requirement. 

Paragraph 1417(i). [Reserved.] This 

proposed paragraph is reserved because 
it is inconvenient for readers to 
determine whether ‘‘(i)’’ is being used as 
a letter or a roman numeral. 
Paragraph 1417(j) 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that operators be familiar with 
the equipment and its proper operation. 
Furthermore, if adjustments/repairs are 
necessary, then the operator would have 
to promptly inform the individual 
designated by the employer to receive 
such information as well as inform the 
next operator in cases where there are 
successive shifts. 

This paragraph addresses the need to 

identify problems that may develop 
with the equipment during operations. 
Early recognition of such problems by 
the operator would help prevent 
accidents that could result from 
continued operation of equipment that 
needs adjustment and/or repair. 
Operators who are familiar with the 
equipment and its proper operation can 
recognize such equipment anomalies 
and problems. By requiring that 
information about needed adjustments 
and/or repairs be provided to the 
individual designated by the employer 
to receive it, this proposed paragraph 
will facilitate the correction of those 
problems. 

C–DAC did not specify any particular 

job title for the person to whom the 
operator would be required to provide 
this information because different 
employers may assign the responsibility 
of receiving such information to 
different job classifications. 

Providing this information to the next 

operator in cases where there are 
successive shifts (that is, shifts that have 
no break between them) would ensure 
that the next operator is aware of this 
information and will be able to take 
appropriate action. 

This provision is comparable to 

section 5–3.1.3j of ANSI B30.5–1968, 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N, 
which requires operators of crawler, 
locomotive and truck cranes to 
familiarize themselves with the 
equipment and its proper care, to report 
any needed adjustments/repairs or 
defects to a responsible person, and to 
notify the next operator of any such 
problems when changing shifts. 
Paragraph 1417(k) 

This proposed paragraph would 

prohibit safety devices and operational 
aids from being used as a substitute for 
the exercise of professional judgment by 
the operator. The Committee agreed that 
such devices and aids do not displace 
the need for operators to apply their 
professional judgment because the 
devices and aids can malfunction and 
lead to the types of safety hazards they 
are designed to prevent. Subpart N 
contains no corresponding provision. 

Paragraph (l). [Reserved.] This 

proposed paragraph is reserved because 
it is inconvenient for readers to 
distinguish the letter ‘‘l’’ from the 
number ‘‘1.’’ 
Paragraph 1417(m) 

If the competent person determines 

that there is a slack rope condition 
requiring re-spooling of the rope, this 
proposed paragraph would require that 
before starting the lift, it shall be 
verified that the rope is seated on the 
drum and in the sheaves as the slack is 
removed. This would prevent a loose 
coil of rope from becoming cross-coiled 
on the drum, a portion of the rope 
coming off the drum altogether, or the 
rope being pulled alongside (instead of 
seating in) a sheave. Each of these 
conditions can lead to sudden failure of 
the rope. 

Section 5–3.2.3a.4 of ANSI B30.5– 

1968, incorporated by reference in 
Subpart N, has a provision stating: ‘‘If 
there is a slack rope condition, it should 
be determined that the rope is properly 
seated on the drum and in the sheaves.’’ 
The term ‘‘should’’ has been interpreted 
by the courts of appeals as meaning that 
the provision is non-mandatory. The 
provision in paragraph (m) of this 
section uses language making clear that 
the provision is mandatory. 

Paragraph 1417(n) 

This proposed paragraph addresses 

the hazards posed by wind, ice and 
snow on equipment capacity and 
stability. Wind can reduce capacity by 
imposing loads on the equipment, 
which can also reduce stability. Ice and 
snow can also reduce capacity and 
stability when it accumulates on the 
equipment. There are numerous 
variables involved in determining the 
effects of wind, ice and snow in any 
particular circumstance, (for example, 
the extent to which the crane is 
operating below its rated capacity, the 
sail effect presented by the load, the rate 
at which ice or snow is accumulating, 
and whether the snow is wet or light). 
C–DAC concluded that the most 
effective approach would be to require 
the competent person to consider their 
effect on equipment stability and rated 
capacity. 29 CFR part 1926 subpart N 
currently has no similar provision. 
Paragraph 1417(o) Compliance With 
Rated Capacity 

Paragraph 1417(o)(1). This proposed 
paragraph would require employers to 
ensure that equipment is not operated 
beyond its rated capacity. Overloading a 
crane or derrick can cause it to collapse, 
with potentially catastrophic 
consequences. This basic safeguard has 
long been recognized in the industry as 
crucial and is designed to prevent such 
accidents. A comparable requirement is 
contained in 29 CFR part 1926 subpart 
N through incorporation by reference of 
section 5–3.2.1a of ANSI B30.5–1968. 
Paragraph 1417(o)(2). This proposed 
paragraph would require employers to 
ensure that operators are not required to 
operate the equipment in a manner that 
would exceed its rated capacity, in 
violation of proposed § 1926.1417(o)(1) 
above. This proposed provision 
reinforces the general prohibition of 
proposed § 1926.1417(o)(1) by making it 
a separate violation for an employer to 
expressly require an operator to exceed 
the equipment’s rated capacity. 29 CFR 
part 1926 subpart N currently has no 
provision comparable to proposed 
paragraph (o)(2) of this section. 

In the Committee’s experience, a 

significant problem in the construction 
industry is that some employers 
pressure operators to conduct lifts that 
exceed the equipment’s rated capacity. 
Such employers seek to avoid the time 
and expense associated with bringing in 
larger capacity equipment.51 

51 In some instances the overcapacity problem can 
be avoided by repositioning the crane (for example, 
by moving the crane so that the lift can be 
performed at a higher boom angle). However, even 
in those instances some time (and associated 
expense) is involved.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59793 

The Committee believed that in many 

of these instances the employer knows 
that the load exceeds the crane’s rated 
capacity but acts on the belief that the 
rated capacity is sufficiently 
conservative to perform the lift. In some 
such cases the exact weight of the load 
is unknown, and the employer pressures 
the crane operator in the belief that even 
if the operator is right about the weight 
exceeding the capacity rating, the safety 
factor that the employer assumes is built 
into the capacity rating will enable the 
crane to perform the lift anyway. 

In the C–DAC discussions of this 

issue, members explained that while 
equipment capacity ratings are 
developed with consideration of a safety 
factor, that safety factor is not intended 
by the manufacturer to be treated as 
excess capacity. There are numerous, 
complex considerations used by 
manufacturers in setting the capacity 
rating. Employers cannot safely assume 
that, in any particular situation, they 
will not need the benefits conferred by 
the safety factor. 

There continue to be a significant 

number of injuries and fatalities 
resulting from equipment overturning. 
Although it has long been a requirement 
not to exceed the equipment’s rated 
capacity, in the Committee’s experience, 
a significant number of overturning 
incidents are caused by exceeding rated 
capacity. A study of fatal accidents 
involving cranes in the U.S. 
construction industry for 1984–1994, 
based on investigations of reported 
accidents conducted by OSHA and 
states with OSHA-approved safety and 
health programs, showed that 22 deaths 
resulted from overloaded cranes. A. 
Suruda, M. Egger, & D. Liu, ‘‘Crane- 
Related Deaths in the U.S. Construction 
Industry, 1984–94,’’ p. 12, Table 9, The 
Center to Protect Workers’ Rights (Oct. 
1997). (OSHA–2007–0066–0013). 

The Committee believed that there are 

several root causes of this problem, 
including lack of operator qualification/ 
certification requirements, insufficient 
ground conditions, reliance on 
unreliable information regarding load 
weight, and operators being pressured 
into exceeding rated capacity. The 
Committee concluded that this 
additional measure is needed to help 
counteract the persistent problem of 
operators being pressured into 
exceeding rated capacity. 

Paragraph 1417(o)(3). Load weight. As 

discussed above, another cause of 
injuries and fatalities from overturning 
equipment is the use of unreliable 
information on load weight. The 
Committee concluded that one of the 
ways these incidents can be reduced is

to require that load weight be verified 
by a reliable means. 

Under this proposed paragraph, the 

operator would be required to verify 
that the load is within the rated capacity 
of the equipment by using the 
procedures in either proposed 
§ 1926.1417(o)(3)(i) or (ii). Under 
§ 1926.1417(o)(3)(i), the weight of the 
load would have to be determined in 
one of three ways: From a reliable 
source, from a reliable calculation 
method, or by other equally reliable 
means. An example of verifying the load 
weight from a reliable source would be 
where the load is mechanical equipment 
and the weight is obtained from its 
manufacturer. 

An example of a reliable calculation 

method would be the following: The 
load is a steel I–beam. After measuring 
the thickness of the steel and the I– 
beam’s other dimensions, the operator 
uses an industry table that shows weight 
per linear foot for a beam of these 
dimensions. The operator then 
calculates the beam’s weight using that 
information. If the weight of the load is 
determined under proposed 
§ 1926.1417(o)(3)(i), the information 
about how the load weight was 
determined must be provided to the 
operator, prior to the lift, upon the 
operator’s request. This provision is 
included to help ensure that the 
operator has the information necessary 
to verify that the load is within the rated 
capacity of the equipment. 

Under proposed paragraph (o)(3)(ii), 

the operator would have to begin 
hoisting the load to determine if it 
exceeds 75 percent of the maximum 
rated capacity at the longest radius that 
will be used during the lift operation, 
using a load weighing device, load 
moment indicator, rated capacity 
indicator, or rated capacity limiter. If 
the load does exceed 75 percent of the 
maximum rated capacity, then the 
operator would be prohibited from 
proceeding with the lift until he/she 
verifies the weight of the load in 
accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1417(o)(3)(i). 

The Committee concluded that as 

long as one of these devices shows that 
the load does not exceed 75% of the 
rated capacity (at the longest radius that 
will be used), it is not necessary to 
determine the actual weight of the load. 
Its conclusion is based on the belief that 
this verification procedure 52 

52 The operator would still be required to use his 

or her professional judgment in determining 
whether the load exceeds the capacity of the 
equipment. As discussed above, proposed 
§ 1926.1417(k) would prohibit sole reliance by the 
operator on an operational aid, such as a load 
weight device, for ensuring that the equipment’s 

incorporates a sufficient margin of error 
and would be adequate to ensure that 
the crane’s rated capacity would not be 
exceeded. 

In contrast, the Committee believed 
that if the device shows that the load 
exceeds 75%, there is an insufficient 
margin of error to proceed without a 
more accurate determination. In such 
instances a verified determination of the 
actual weight, in accordance with 
proposed § 1926.1417(o)(3)(i), is needed 
to ensure safety. 

Currently, the only Subpart N 

requirement for determining or verifying 
the weight of the load is found in 
section 5–3.2.1b of ANSI B30.5–1968, 
which states: ‘‘When loads which are 
limited by structural competence rather 
than by stability are to be handled, the 
person responsible for the job shall 
ascertain that the weight of the load has 
been determined within plus or minus 
10 percent before it is lifted.’’ The 
Committee believed that the more 
detailed procedures in proposed 
§ 1926.1417(o)(3) and the greater margin 
of safety provided by the 75% limit are 
needed to prevent the crane’s capacity 
from being exceeded. 
Paragraph 1417(p) 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that the boom or other parts of 
the equipment not contact any 
obstruction. The Committee agreed on 
this provision because of its 
understanding that boom contact with 
an obstruction can deform, misalign or 
otherwise damage the equipment. Such 
damage can cause unintended 
movement, prevent intended movement, 
or a collapse. 29 CFR part 1926 subpart 
N currently has no similar provision. 
Paragraph 1417(q) 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that the equipment not be used 
to drag or pull loads sideways. The 
Committee intended this provision to 
prevent the sideloading that occurs 
when a load is dragged or pulled 
sideways. Sideloading can buckle the 
boom, damage the swing mechanism, or 
overturn the crane (such as when the 
boom is at a high angle). Currently, 
section 5–3.2.3c.2 of ANSI B30.5–1968 
contains a similar requirement, 
providing: ‘‘Side loading of booms shall 

capacity will not be exceeded. The procedure in 
proposed § 1926.1417(o)(3)(ii) is a verification 
procedure—it would verify that the operator’s 
estimate is at least correct in terms of not exceeding 
75% of the equipment’s rated capacity (at the 
longest radius that will be used). If, for example, the 
load weight device yields a figure that is 
significantly below what the operator estimates to 
be the true weight, the operator would need to 
reliably determine the weight of the load before 
proceeding with the lift.

be limited to freely suspended loads. 
Cranes shall not be used for dragging 
loads sideways.’’ (As discussed below, 
proposed paragraph (v) addresses 
sideloading of freely suspended loads 
by restricting the speed of rotation). 
Paragraph 1417(r) 

On wheel-mounted equipment, this 
proposed provision would require that 
no loads be lifted over the front area, 
except as permitted by the 
manufacturer. The Committee agreed on 
this provision because wheel-mounted 
equipment typically is not designed to 
lift loads over the front area without 
tipping over unless it is specifically 
designed to do so (such as where 
equipped with a front outrigger for 
support and stabilization for this 
purpose). Equipment that is not so 
designed will likely tip over or 
otherwise fail when lifting loads over 
the front area. This proposed paragraph 
continues the requirement of section 5– 
3.2.3g of ANSI B30.5–1968, which is 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N. 
Paragraph 1417(s) 

In many circumstances an operator 

may use equipment that has not recently 
been used to handle a load that is 90% 
or more of the maximum line pull. The 
condition and adjustment of the brakes 
may be sufficient to handle lesser loads, 
but insufficient to handle loads closer to 
their design capacity. Consequently, the 
operator may not know that the brakes 
are insufficient until after the load is 
hoisted. In such a case the load could 
be dropped, posing a struck-by hazard. 

This proposed paragraph would 

address that hazard by requiring that the 
operator test the brakes each time a load 
that is 90% or more of the maximum 
line pull is handled by lifting the load 
a few inches and applying the brakes. In 
duty cycle and repetitive lifts where 
each lift is 90% or more of the 
maximum line pull, this requirement 
would apply to the first but not to 
successive lifts, since the operator 
would have already determined from 
the initial test that the brakes are 
sufficient. 

Currently, 29 CFR part 1926 subpart 

N contains a similar requirement 
through section 5–3.2.3h of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, which states: ‘‘The operator 
shall test the brakes each time a load 
approaching the rated load is handled 
by raising it a few inches and applying 
the brakes.’’ C–DAC believed that 
additional clarity than that found in the 
ANSI provision is needed to give 
employers notice of when a brake test 
was required and therefore proposed in 
§ 1926.1417(s) to require testing when

the load is 90% or more of the 
maximum line pull. 
Paragraph 1417(t) 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that neither the load nor the 
boom be lowered below the point where 
less than two full wraps of rope remain 
on their respective drums. This 
provision is designed to ensure that the 
rope is not unspooled to the point 
where the rope would become 
disconnected from the drum. It 
continues the current Subpart N 
requirement found in section 5–3.2.3j of 
ANSI B30.5–1968. 
Paragraph 1417(u) Traveling With a 
Load 

Paragraph 1417(u)(1). This proposed 

paragraph would prohibit traveling with 
a load if the practice is prohibited by the 
manufacturer. If the manufacturer does 
not prohibit this practice, the equipment 
may travel with a load, but only if the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1417(u)(2) are met. 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart N does not prohibit 
traveling with a load if the practice is 
prohibited by the manufacturer but, 
through incorporation of section 5– 
3.2.3n of ANSI B30.5–1968, permits 
traveling with a load whenever 
conditions similar to those in proposed 
§ 1926.1417(u)(2)(i) are satisfied. 

The dynamic effects of traveling with 

a load impose additional and/or 
increased forces on crane components. 
Unless the crane has been designed to 
handle these types of forces and force 
levels, they can cause component 
failure, collapse, instability or 
overturning. The Committee believed 
that the manufacturer has the expertise 
to ascertain its equipment’s capabilities. 
Therefore, the Committee believed that 
where the manufacturer has prohibited 
traveling with the load, such a 
determination needs to be complied 
with to ensure safety. 

Paragraph 1417(u)(2). If the 

manufacturer does not prohibit traveling 
with a load, the equipment may travel 
with a load if the requirements of 
proposed § 1926.1417(u)(2) are met. 
This proposed paragraph sets forth three 
procedures that employers would have 
to follow when traveling with a load. 
Paragraph 1417(u)(2)(i). Pursuant to 
this proposed paragraph, a competent 
person would have to supervise the 
operation, determine if it is necessary to 
reduce crane ratings, and make 
determinations regarding load position, 
boom location, ground support, travel 
route, overhead obstructions, and speed 
of movement necessary to ensure safety. 
Under proposed § 1926.1417(u)(2)(ii), 
the determinations of the competent 

person must be implemented. These 
provisions are similar to section 5– 
3.2.3n of ANSI B30.5–1968, which is 
incorporated in 29 CFR part 1926 
subpart N. 

As discussed above, traveling with a 
load imposes types and levels of forces 
on the equipment that are not present 
when the equipment is stationary, and 
conditions such as load position and 
boom location can affect the magnitude 
of those forces. Some of the criteria in 
proposed § 1926.1417(u)(2)(i) address 
this type of effect. Other criteria in this 
paragraph are intended to ensure that 
other hazards—those posed by the crane 
being in changing locations (such as 
ground support, travel route and 
overhead obstructions)—are addressed 
by the competent person. When 
traveling with a load, a crane may 
encounter hazards such as power lines, 
insufficient ground support, uneven or 
slippery ground conditions, and 
obstructions that the equipment could 
strike. 

A competent person must address 

these issues before the equipment 
begins to travel with a load. The 
competent person must also supervise 
the operation as it proceeds so that 
problems that arise that were not 
foreseen at the outset can be properly 
addressed. In sum, the Committee 
designed these provisions to ensure that 
the employer plans and implements a 
travel operation so that the various 
effects and changeable conditions 
associated with travel are properly 
identified, assessed and addressed. 

Paragraph 1417(u)(2)(iii). For 

equipment with pressurized tires, this 
proposed paragraph would require that 
tire pressure specified by the 
manufacturer be maintained. Subpart N 
currently has no corresponding 
provision. 

The Committee agreed on this 

provision to address the hazards posed 
by improper tire pressure when 
traveling with a load. Where pressure 
varies among the tires, the equipment 
may be out of level, reducing capacity 
and causing instability. Uniform but 
improper pressure can reduce capacity 
or lead to tire failure. Each of these 
circumstances can lead to unintended 
movement, loss of the load, overturning 
and/or collapse. 
Paragraph 1417(v) 

This proposed paragraph would 
require that rotational speed of the 
equipment be such that the load does 
not swing out beyond the radius at 
which it can be controlled. As noted 
above in relation to proposed 
§ 1926.1417(q), 29 CFR part 1926 
subpart N currently permits sideloading

of freely suspended loads with no 
restriction comparable to that in 
proposed § 1926.1417(v). 

The Committee intended this 

provision to prevent the hazard of 
sideloading, which occurs when the 
load swings to either side of the boom 
tip, rather than its appropriate position 
directly beneath the boom tip. When the 
load is not directly under the boom tip, 
sideloading occurs and decreases 
capacity. This hazard can lead to tip- 
over or boom failure. 
Paragraph 1417(w) 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that a tag or restraint line be 
used if necessary to prevent rotation of 
the load that would be hazardous. The 
Committee agreed on this provision in 
order to prevent the hazard of an 
unstable or uncontrolled load which 
could in turn destabilize other parts of 
the crane or the crane itself. This 
condition can also result in the load 
posing a struck-by hazard. Section 5– 
3.2.3p of ANSI B30.5–1968 contains a 
comparable requirement. 
Paragraph 1417(x) 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that the brakes be adjusted in 
accordance with manufacturer 
procedures to prevent unintended 
movement. This requirement would 
apply to all brakes on equipment 
covered by this standard, including 
brakes used to control the lowering of 
the load and those used to stop the 
equipment while it is traveling. 
Improper adjustment can cause a delay 
in the onset of braking after the operator 
attempts to activate the brake and can 
also diminish the brake’s capacity. 
Brakes are critical to the safe operation 
of the equipment and must be properly 
adjusted to serve their safety function. 
Currently, 29 CFR part 1926 subpart 
N does not specifically address brake 
adjustment. However, section 5–2.3.1a 
of ANSI B30.5–1968 requires a 
preventive maintenance program based 
on the manufacturer’s 
recommendations, and section 5–2.3.3b 
requires that all components and 
operating mechanisms be adjusted to 
ensure their correct functioning. In light 
of the critical role that brakes play in 
ensuring equipment safety, these 
provisions of ANSI B30.5–1968 can be 
read to include brake adjustments. The 
Committee concluded that the more 
explicit approach to this issue taken in 
proposed § 1926.1417(x) requirement 
would help enhance employee safety. 
Paragraph 1417(y) 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that the operator obey a stop or

emergency stop signal, regardless of 
who gives the signal. Any person on a 
worksite may observe a hazardous 
condition that is not visible to or 
recognized by the crane operator and 
that can only be avoided if the 
equipment stops immediately. 
Therefore, the operator must obey a stop 
signal given by anybody on the 
worksite. Section 5–3.1.3c of ANSI 
B30.5–1968 contains a comparable 
requirement. 
Paragraph 1417(z) Swinging 
Locomotive Cranes 

Pursuant to this proposed paragraph, 
a locomotive crane shall not be swung 
into a position where it is reasonably 
foreseeable that railway cars on an 
adjacent track could strike it, until it is 
determined that cars are not being 
moved on the adjacent track and that 
proper flag protection has been 
established. A comparable requirement 
is contained in section 5–3.4.4 of ANSI 
B30.5–1968. 
Paragraph 1417(aa) Counterweight/ 
Ballast 

Paragraph 1417(aa)(1). This proposed 

paragraph contains counterweight/ 
ballast requirements that would apply to 
equipment other than tower cranes. 
Pursuant to proposed 
§ 1926.1417(aa)(2), requirements 
regarding counterweight/ballast for 
tower cranes are found in proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(7). 

Paragraph 1417(aa)(1)(i). This 

proposed paragraph would require that 
equipment not be operated without the 
counterweight or ballast in place as 
specified by the manufacturer. Failure 
to follow the manufacturer’s 
specifications for use of counterweights 
and ballast could result in a tipover or 
collapse. 

Paragraph 1417(aa)(1)(ii). Under this 

proposed provision, the employer 
would be prohibited from exceeding the 
maximum counterweight or ballast 
specified by the manufacturer for the 
equipment. Exceeding that maximum 
could result in component failure, 
which could cause unintended 
movement, tipover or collapse. 

Requirements similar to those in 

§ 1926.1417(aa)(1)(i) and (ii) are 
currently contained in Subpart N 
through incorporation by reference of 
section 5–3.4.2 of ANSI B30.5–1968. 
The C–DAC draft of this provision 

stated that the maximum counterweight 
or ballast ‘‘approved’’ by the 
manufacturer shall not be exceeded. 
Upon reviewing the draft, OSHA 
determined that a term that more 
accurately reflects the Committee’s 
intent in this regard is ‘‘specified.’’ 

Therefore, the Agency has modified the 
C–DAC language so that proposed 
§ 1926.1417(aa)(1)(ii) reads: 

The maximum counterweight or ballast 

specified by the manufacturer for the 
equipment shall not be exceeded. 

Paragraph 1417(aa)(2). This proposed 

paragraph complements proposed 
§ 1926.1417(aa)(1) by noting that the 
counterweight and ballast requirements 
for tower cranes are found in proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(8). 
Section 1418 Authority To Stop 
Operation 

This proposed section provides: 
‘‘Whenever there is a concern as to 
safety, the operator shall have the 
authority to stop and refuse to handle 
loads until a qualified person has 
determined that safety has been 
assured.’’ Subpart N incorporates pre- 
1971 industry consensus standards that 
require operators to have comparable 
authority, and current industry 
consensus standards contain similar 
provisions. An appropriately capable 
equipment operator is highly 
knowledgeable in matters affecting 
equipment safety and is well qualified 
to determine whether an operation 
presents a safety concern. C–DAC 
believed that it continues to be 
necessary for the employer to provide 
this authority to the operator. 

Current consensus standards specify 
that an operator with a safety concern 
must raise that concern with a 
supervisor before proceeding with a lift. 
For example, section 5–3.1.3(d) of ANSI 
B30.5–2004, ‘‘Mobile and Locomotive 
Cranes,’’ provides: ‘‘Whenever there is 
any doubt as to safety, the operator shall 
consult with the supervisor before 
handling the loads.’’ Similar provisions 
are included in section 2–3.1.7 of ASME 
B30.2–2001, ‘‘Overhead and Gantry 
Cranes,’’ section 3–3.1.3(d) of ASME 
B30.3–1996, ‘‘Construction Tower 
Cranes,’’ section 6–3.2.3 of ASME 
B30.6–2003, ‘‘Derricks,’’ and other 
standards in the ASME B30 series. 
The proposed section reflects C– 
DAC’s belief that it is necessary to 
clearly delineate the circumstances 
under which it would be permissible to 
resume operations after the operator has 
exercised this authority. Under the 
proposed provision, operations would 
be prohibited from resuming ‘‘until a 
qualified person had determined that 
safety has been assured.’’ 

In accordance with the proposed 

definition of a qualified person (see the 
discussion above of this term in 
proposed § 1926.1401), that person 
would, ‘‘by possession of a recognized 
degree, certificate, or professional

standing, or who by extensive 
knowledge, training and experience, 
successfully demonstrated the ability to 
solve/resolve problems relating to the 
subject matter, the work or the project.’’ 
For example, operations could resume 
only after the qualified person either: (1) 
Assesses the factors that led the operator 
to stop and refuse to handle the load 
and determines that there is not, in fact, 
a safety hazard, or (2) after corrective 
action has been taken, determines that 
there is no longer a safety hazard. 

An illustrative example of this is the 
following: A large steel cylinder, which 
is lying lengthwise on the ground, is to 
be lifted into the vertical position and 
then up to the top of a structure. As the 
crane operator prepares to lift the 
cylinder into the vertical position, the 
operator sees that the rigging is attached 
at a point that is more than halfway 
down from the top of the cylinder. This 
indicates to the operator that the rigging 
has been attached below the cylinder’s 
center of gravity. Rigging such a load 
below the center of gravity could cause 
it to flip over when it is lifted. As a 
result of this concern, the operator 
exercises his/her authority to stop and 
refuse to handle the load. 

After the operator explains his/her 

concern to the employer, the employer 
consults with an individual who is a 
qualified person with respect to the 
rigging of the load. The qualified person 
finds that the wall of the steel cylinder 
is much thicker near its base than at the 
top. After calculating the cylinder’s 
center of gravity, the qualified person 
determines that it is well below the 
midpoint of the cylinder. The qualified 
person then determines that the rigging 
is, in fact, attached above the cylinder’s 
center of gravity, and that safety is 
assured. The lifting operation is then 
resumed. 

In this example the operator 
appropriately exercised his/her 
authority to stop and refuse to handle 
the load, since there were indications of 
an unsafe condition. A qualified person 
then appropriately found that safety was 
assured after examining those 
indications, assessing the relevant 
factors, and determining that the load 
was in fact rigged in a safe manner. 
Signals 

Proposed §§ 1926.1419 through 

1926.1422 address the circumstances 
under which a signal person must be 
provided, the type of signals that may be 
used, criteria for how signals are 
transmitted, and other criteria 
associated with the use of signals.

Section 1419 Signals—General 
Requirements 

This proposed section would set 

requirements regarding signals when 
using equipment covered by this 
proposed standard. 

Currently, § 1926.550(a)(4) provides: 

‘‘Hand signals to crane and derrick 
operators shall be those prescribed by 
the applicable ANSI standard for the 
type of crane in use. An illustration of 
the signals shall be posted at the job 
site.’’ C–DAC believed that the current 
rule is insufficient in several respects. 
First, the current rule does not establish 
the circumstances in which there is a 
need to have a signal person. Second, 
the current standard refers only to hand 
signals. C–DAC believed that other 
means of signaling need to be addressed 
as well to provide necessary flexibility 
and reduce the potential for 
miscommunication (requirements 
regarding other signaling methods are 
addressed in proposed §§ 1926.1420 and 
1926.1421). 

Finally, C–DAC found that hazardous 

situations arise as a result of signal 
persons not understanding safety- 
related aspects of crane operations and 
dynamics and not knowing how to give 
appropriate signals. Consequently, it 
determined that there is a need to 
establish requirements regarding the 
qualifications of the signal person; these 
are addressed in proposed § 1926.1428. 
In short, C–DAC believed that 
addressing these issues is one of the 
means by which the number of injuries 
and fatalities caused by ‘‘struck-by’’ 
incidents, in which the equipment or 
load strikes an employee, can be 
reduced. 
Paragraph 1419(a) 

Proposed paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) address the circumstances that 
would require the provision of a signal 
person: When the point of operation, 
meaning the load travel or the area near 
or at load placement, is not in full view 
of the operator (§ 1926.1419(a)(1)); when 
the equipment is traveling and the 
operator’s view in the direction of travel 
is obstructed (§ 1926.1419(a)(2)); and 
when, due to site specific safety 
concerns, either the operator or the 
person handling the load determines it 
is necessary (§ 1926.1419(a)(3)). The 
first two of these circumstances involve 
an obvious hazard—limited operator 
visibility. 

With respect to the third 

circumstance, C–DAC believed that 
other situations arise that, from a safety 
standpoint, necessitate the use of a 
signal person. For example, the operator 
may recognize that the load at one point 

will move alongside and very close to a 
structure. Even though the load in this 
example will remain in view of the 
operator as it travels, because of the 
tight tolerances involved, the operator 
determines that a signal person is 
needed to help ensure that the load does 
not come in contact with the structure 
(which could cause the load to fall). 
Another example is where a heavy 

load, such as a large HVAC unit, has to 
be placed very precisely on a concrete 
pad. In this example, as in the previous 
one, the load remains within the view 
of the operator at all times. However, 
the employee handling the load 
determines that signals need to be given 
to the operator so that the load handler’s 
work and the operator’s movement of 
the load are properly coordinated. 
Because of the weight of the load, the 
employee handling it will have to use 
both hands to help position it as it is 
placed on the pad and will not be able 
to give signals. In such an instance the 
person handling the load could 
determine that a signal person is 
necessary. 
Paragraph 1419(b) Types of Signals 

Under proposed paragraph (b), signals 

to crane operators would have to be by 
hand, voice, audible, or ‘‘new’’ signals. 
As used in this proposed standard, these 
terms refer to the type of signal, not the 
means by which the signal is 
transmitted. For example, signaling by 
voice refers to oral communication, not 
whether the oral communication is done 
with or without amplification or with or 
without electronic transmission. The 
manner of transmission of the signal is 
addressed separately. 

‘‘Audible signal’’ is defined in 

§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘a signal made by a 
distinct sound or series of sounds. 
Examples include, but are not limited 
to, sounds made by a bell, horn, or 
whistle.’’ Under some circumstances, 
audible signals are effective means of 
communicating with an operator, and 
C–DAC defined the term to make clear 
the types of sounds that would be 
permissible. 

The criteria for the use of these signal 

types are set out in proposed 
§ 1926.1419(c)–(m) (additional voice 
signal requirements are in proposed 
§ 1926.1421, Signals—voice signals— 
additional requirements). The 
Committee’s intent was to reduce the 
potential for miscommunication, which 
can lead to injuries and fatalities, 
particularly from ‘‘struck-by’’ and 
‘‘crushed-by’’ incidents. In setting 
parameters for the use of the various 
types of existing signal methods, and for 
signal methods that may be developed 
in the future, the Committee sought to

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59797 

promote a degree of standardization 
while still allowing appropriate 
flexibility. In addition, the proposed 
provisions are designed to ensure that 
the selection of signal type and means 
of sending the signals are appropriate 
under the circumstances and reliable. 
Paragraph 1419(c) Hand Signals 

Proposed paragraph (c) addresses the 

use of hand signals. The industry has 
long recognized the need for consistent, 
universal hand signals to minimize the 
potential for miscommunication 
between signal persons and operators. 
ANSI B30.5–1968, ‘‘Crawler, 
Locomotive and Truck Cranes,’’ 
contains illustrations of hand signals 
that are the same as the current 2004 
edition of ASME B30.5 and that are 
consistent with hand signals for other 
types of cranes in ASME B30 standards. 
Subpart N currently requires that hand 
signals to crane and derrick operators 
‘‘be those prescribed by the applicable 
ANSI standard for the type of crane in 
use’’ and that ‘‘an illustration of the 
signals shall be posted at the job site’’ 
(§ 1926.550(a)(4)). 

Because of the industry’s long 

familiarity with these standard hand 
signals, C–DAC determined that, when 
using hand signals, the standardized 
version of the signals should continue to 
be required. These signals are referred to 
as the ‘‘Standard Method,’’ which is 
defined in proposed § 1926.1401 as ‘‘the 
protocol in Appendix A for hand 
signals.’’ The ‘‘Standard Method’’ 
signals are located in Appendix A. 
However, the Committee recognized 
that there are instances when use of the 
Standard Method is either infeasible or 
where there is no Standard Method 
signal applicable to the work being 
done. 

For example, the Standard Method 

signal for raising the boom is: arm 
extended, thumb pointing upward and 
other fingers closed. The signal for 
lowering the boom is the same except 
the thumb points down. There are 
circumstances where back-lighting 
conditions make it difficult for the 
operator to see the signal person’s 
thumb and therefore cannot discern 
whether it is pointing up or down. In 
such circumstances use of the standard 
signal would be infeasible. 

In such instances, under this 

proposed paragraph, non-standard 
signals (examples of which are provided 
in Appendix B of this proposed rule) 
may be used. To avoid confusion when 
non-standard signals are used, proposed 
§ 1926.1419(c)(2) would require that the 
signal person, crane operator, and lift 
supervisor (where there is one) meet 

prior to the operation to agree upon the 
signals that will be used. 
Paragraph 1419(d) New Signals 

Proposed paragraph (d) would allow 

signals other than hand, voice, or 
audible signals to be used if certain 
criteria are met. As discussed above 
under proposed § 1926.1419(b), C–DAC 
include § 1926.1419(d) to allow for the 
development of new signals in the 
future. To ensure that any new signals 
are as effective as hand, voice, or 
audible signals, proposed 
1926.1419(d)(1) and (d)(2) would 
require the employer to demonstrate 
either that the new signals are as 
effective as existing signals for 
communicating, or that there is a 
national consensus standard for the new 
signals.53 C–DAC believed it was 
appropriate to allow reliance on signals 
in a national consensus standard 
because their inclusion in such a 
standard shows a high degree of 
standardization and widespread 
acceptance by persons who are affected 
by the signals, thereby ensuring that the 
signals can be used safely to control 
equipment operations. 
Paragraph 1419(e) Suitability 

Under proposed paragraph (e), the 

type of signal (hand, voice, audible, or 
new) and the transmission method used 
would have to be suitable for the site 
conditions. For example, hand signals 
would not be suitable if site conditions 
do not allow for the signal person to be 
within the operator’s line of sight. Radio 
signals would not be suitable if 
electronic interference on the site 
prohibits the signals from being readily 
understood. 
Paragraph 1419(f) 

Proposed paragraph (f) would require 

the ability to transmit signals between 
the operator and signal person to be 
maintained. If that ability is interrupted, 
the operator would be required to safely 
stop operations until signal 
transmission is reestablished and a 
proper signal is given and understood. 
Paragraph 1419(g) 

Proposed paragraph (g) would require 

the operator to stop operations if the 
operator becomes aware of a safety 
problem and needs to communicate 
with the signal person. Operations may 
only be resumed after the operator and 
signal person agree that the problem has 
been resolved. 

53 The C–DAC draft refers to an ‘‘industry 

consensus standard.’’ OSHA hasd changed this to 
‘‘national consensus standard’’ to conform to the 
terminology used in the OSH Act. 

Most signal systems permit only one- 

way communication, from the signal 
person to the operator. In addition, most 
two-way systems, such as a typical two- 
way radio system, only permit one 
person to speak at a time. When using 
such systems, circumstances may arise 
in which the operator, while receiving 
signals, becomes aware of a safety 
problem that is of a nature that 
necessitates that the operator 
communicate with the signal person. 
For example, the signal person signals 
to the operator to lower the load. 
However, the operator sees that an 
employee has moved under the load in 
an area that is out of the view of the 
signal person. Under this proposed 
provision the operator would have to 
safely stop lowering the load and 
communicate the problem to the signal 
person. 

Another example is where the signal 

person gives a hand signal but it appears 
to the operator that the signal person is 
using the wrong signal. The operator 
would be required to safely stop 
operations and communicate with the 
signal person to resolve the problem. 
Paragraph 1419(h) and (j) 

Proposed paragraph (h) would require 
that only one person at a time signal the 
operator. C–DAC believed this provision 
was needed to prevent confusion with 
respect to which signals the operator is 
supposed to follow. An exception is 
provided when, as provided in 
proposed § 1926.1419(j), somebody 
becomes aware of a safety problem and 
gives an emergency stop signal. Under 
proposed § 1926.1417(y), the operator 
would be required to obey such a signal. 

Paragraph 1419(i) [Reserved.] 

Paragraph (i) is reserved because it is 
inconvenient for readers to determine 
whether ‘‘(i)’’ is being used as a letter or 
a roman numeral. 
Paragraph 1419(k) 

Proposed paragraph (k) would require 
that all directions given to the operator 
by the signal person be given from the 
operator’s direction perspective. In the 
Committee’s experience, the operator 
will tend to react to a directional signal, 
such as ‘‘forward,’’ by acting on the 
signal from the operator’s perspective. 
This provision would ensure that the 
signal that is given will be consistent 
with that natural tendency. 

Paragraph 1419(l) [Reserved.] 

Paragraph (l) is reserved because it is 
inconvenient for readers to whether ‘‘l’’ 
is being used as a letter or a number.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Paragraph 1419(m) Communication 
With Multiple Cranes/Derricks 

Proposed paragraph (m) addresses a 
situation where the signal person is in 
communication with more than one 
crane or derrick. It would require the 
signal person to use an effective means 
of identifying the crane or derrick the 
signal is for before giving the signal. 
Proposed § 1926.1419(m)(i) and (ii) set 
out alternate means of complying with 
this requirement. Under proposed 
§ 1926.1419(m)(i), for each signal, prior 
to giving the function/direction, the 
signal person must identify the crane/ 
derrick for which the signal is intended. 
Alternatively, under proposed 
§ 1926.1419(m)(ii), the employer could 
implement a method of identifying 
which crane/derrick for which the 
signal is intended that is as effective as 
the system in proposed 
§ 1926.1419(m)(i). Because of the 
potential for confusion, it is essential 
that an alternative system under 
proposed § 1926.1419(m)(ii) be equally 
effective as § 1926.1419(m)(i) in clearly 
conveying, on a consistent basis, the 
crane/derrick to which each signal is 
directed. 
Section 1420 Signals—Radio, 
Telephone, or Other Electronic 
Transmission of Signals 

C–DAC concluded that certain criteria 
are needed to ensure the reliability and 
clarity of electronically transmitted 
signals; these criteria are listed in 
proposed paragraphs § 1926.1420(a) 
through (c). Proposed paragraph (a) 
would require the testing of the 
transmission devices prior to the start of 
operations to ensure that the signals are 
clear and that the devices are reliable. 
This will help ensure that the operator 
receives and can understand the signals 
that are given and will prevent 
accidents caused by miscommunication. 
Proposed paragraph (b) would require 
that such signals be transmitted through 
a dedicated channel. As defined in 
§ 1926.1401, a ‘‘dedicated channel’’ is 
‘‘a line of communication assigned by 
the employer who controls the 
communication system to only one 
signal person and crane/derrick or to a 
coordinated group of cranes/derricks/ 
signal person(s).’’ Use of a dedicated 
channel would ensure that the operator 
and signal person are not interrupted by 
users performing other tasks or confused 
by instructions not intended for them. 

An exception to § 1926.1419(b) would 

allow more than one signal person and 
more than one crane/derrick operator to 
share a dedicated channel in multiple 
crane/derrick situations for coordinating 
operations. The Committee believed that 

this exception is needed because, in 
those situations, it may be advantageous 
to share a single dedicated channel. For 
example, in some situations several 
cranes may be operating in an area in 
which their booms, loads or load lines 
could come in contact with each other. 
In such cases it is crucial that the 
movements of each crane be properly 
coordinated. By sharing a single 
channel, each operator can hear what 
each crane is being asked to do, which 
can facilitate that coordination. 

Proposed paragraph (c) would require 

that the operator’s reception be by a 
hands-free system. In other words, the 
operator must not have to depress a 
button, manipulate a switch, or take any 
action in order for the incoming signal 
to be received. C–DAC believed that this 
provision is needed because the 
operator must have both hands free to 
manipulate the equipment’s controls. 
Paragraph 1421 Signals—Voice 
Signals—Additional Requirements 
C–DAC considered whether the 

proposed rule should include a 
standardized set of voice signals. Unlike 
hand signals, which have become 
standardized to a large extent within the 
industry, in the Committee members’ 
experience there is significant variation 
in the phrases used to convey the same 
instructions. Consequently, words or 
phrases that the Committee might 
choose to propose to be required as 
voice signals could be unfamiliar to 
many employees in the industry or 
contrary to common usage in some parts 
of the country. In light of this, the 
Committee determined that it would be 
better to use a different approach to 
address the problem of 
miscommunication when using voice 
signals. This approach, which 
establishes criteria for whatever voice 
signals are used, is set out in proposed 
§ 1926.1421(a)–(c). 

Under proposed paragraph (a), prior 
to beginning operations, the personnel 
involved with signals—the crane 
operator, signal person and lift 
supervisor (if there is one)—would be 
required to meet and agree on the voice 
signals that will be used. Because of the 
lack of standardization and the variety 
of languages that are in use in the 
construction industry, the Committee 
concluded that it is essential that the 
persons who give and/or receive voice 
signals agree in advance on the signals 
that will be used in order to avoid 
miscommunication. Once the parties 
have met and agreed on the voice 
signals, another meeting is not required 
to discuss them unless another worker 
is substituted, there is some confusion

about the signals, or a signal needs to be 
changed. 

In reviewing the C–DAC draft of this 
provision, the Agency realized that the 
adjective ‘‘voice’’ was inadvertently left 
out when referring to signals. To avoid 
ambiguity, the Agency has added the 
term ‘‘voice’’ to clarify that this 
proposed provision applies to the use of 
voice signals. 

Proposed paragraph (b) would require 

that each voice signal contain the 
following three elements, given in the 
following order: function (such as hoist, 
boom, etc.), direction; distance and/or 
speed; Function, stop command. For 
example: hoist up; 10 feet; hoist stop. As 
discussed above, the Committee 
considered it impractical to attempt to 
standardize the voice signals themselves 
(that is, to require the use of particular 
words to represent particular functions, 
directions or other instructions). 
However, the Committee concluded that 
the chance of miscommunication could 
nonetheless be reduced if certain 
parameters were established for the type 
of information and order of information 
that would be given. 

Proposed paragraph (c) would require 

the crane operator, signal person, and 
lift supervisor (if there is one) to be able 
to effectively communicate in the 
language used. Voice signals will not 
serve their intended purpose if they 
cannot be understood, or can be 
misinterpreted. The inability of these 
workers to understand each other could 
lead to accidents caused, for example, 
by the crane operator moving a load in 
a different direction than the signal 
person intends. 
Section 1422 Signals—Hand Signal 
Chart 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that hand signal charts be either 
posted on the equipment or be readily 
available at the site. The purpose of this 
proposed provision is to serve as a 
reference for operators and signal 
persons of the mandatory hand signals 
and thereby help avoid 
miscommunication. 
Section 1423 Fall Protection 

This proposed section contains 

provisions designed to protect workers 
on equipment covered by this Subpart 
from fall hazards. (See proposed 
§ 1926.1431, Hoisting Personnel, for fall 
protection provisions that would apply 
when equipment is used to hoist 
personnel). Currently, 29 CFR part 1926 
subpart N contains certain fall 
protection requirements but does not 
address fall protection for cranes and 
derricks comprehensively. Where 
Subpart N does not specifically address

a fall protection issue, the general fall 
protection provisions of 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart M apply. As OSHA 
explained when it issued subpart M, 
‘‘while Subpart N contains requirements 
for fall protection when certain cranes 
are used, it does not address other 
equipment or working conditions 
otherwise covered by subpart N which 
may also expose employees to a fall 
hazard.’’59 FR 40672, 40675 (Aug. 9, 
1994).54 

The fall protection requirements in 

Subpart M apply where an employee is 
on a ‘‘walking/working surface.’’ 29 CFR 
1926.501. In § 1926.500(b), the 
definition of walking/working surface 
excludes ‘‘vehicles.’’ That definition 
effectively excludes many cranes (for 
example, mobile cranes would be 
considered ‘‘vehicles’’). 

The Committee believed that safety 
would be enhanced by addressing the 
problem of fall hazards associated with 
cranes and derricks comprehensively. In 
addition, it believed that putting all 
such requirements under the cranes and 
derricks standard would make it easier 
for employers to readily determine the 
applicable fall protection requirements. 
Accordingly, under this proposed 
standard, Subpart M would not apply to 
equipment covered by this proposed 
subpart except where it incorporates 
requirements of Subpart M by reference. 
In this regard, note that the Agency is 
proposing to amend Subpart M at 
§ 1926.500(a)(2)(ii) to remove the word 
‘‘certain.’’ 
Definition of Fall Protection Equipment 

‘‘Fall protection equipment’’ is 

defined in proposed § 1926.1401 as 
‘‘guardrail systems, safety net systems, 
personal fall arrest systems, positioning 
device systems, or fall restraint 
systems.’’ The first four listed systems 
are described, and their specifications 
listed, in 29 CFR Part 1926. Subpart M 
of this part, OSHA’s general fall 
protection standard for construction 
work. See § 1926.502(b) (guardrail 
systems); § 1926.502(c) (safety net 
systems); § 1926.502(d) (personal fall 
arrest systems); and § 1926.502(e) 
(positioning device systems). 

The fifth category of fall protection 
equipment, ‘‘fall restraint system,’’ is 
defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a fall 
protection system that prevents the user 
from falling any distance. The system is 
comprised of either a body belt or body 

54 In Subpart M, § 1926.500(a)(2) states: ‘‘Section 

1926.501 sets forth those workplaces, conditions, 
operations, and circumstances for which fall 
protection shall be provided except as follows: 
* * * (ii) Requirements relating to fall protection 
for employees working on certain cranes and 
derricks are provided in Subpart N of this part.’’

harness, along with an anchorage, 
connectors and other necessary 
equipment. The other components 
typically include a lanyard, and may 
also include a lifeline and other 
devices.’’ This definition is found in 29 
CFR part 1926. Subpart R of this part, 
OSHA’s steel erection standard. 

By defining ‘‘fall protection 

equipment’’ to include the same types of 
fall protection equipment required 
under other OSHA standards, C–DAC 
sought to ensure that employers would 
be familiar with the types of fall 
protection required under this standard 
and thereby promote compliance. 
Paragraph 1423(a) Application 

Falls have traditionally been the 

leading cause of deaths among 
construction workers. BLS data for 2004 
and 2005, the latest years for which 
complete figures are available, shows 
445 fatalities from falls in 2004 (OSHA– 
2007–0066–0023), and 394 in 2005 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0024). In 2004, 20 
fatalities resulted from falls from 
nonmoving vehicles and in 2005, such 
falls caused 18 deaths. A recent study of 
crane-related fatalities in the U.S. 
construction industry found that 2% 
resulted from falls. J.E. Beavers, J.R. 
Moore, R. Rinehart, and W.R. Schriver, 
‘‘Crane-Related Fatalities in the 
Construction Industry,’’ 132 Journal of 
Construction Engineering and 
Management 901 (Sept. 2006) (OSHA– 
2007–0066–0012). Falls from cranes, 
particularly when the operator is 
entering or leaving the crane, also cause 
numerous non-fatal injuries to 
construction workers. (OSHA–S030– 
2006–0663–0422). 

Under proposed paragraph (a), certain 

proposed provisions in this section 
(proposed § 1926.1423(c)(1), (f) and (h)) 
would apply to all equipment, including 
tower cranes; certain provisions 
(proposed § 1926.1423(b), (c)(2), (d) and 
(e)) would apply to all equipment 
except tower cranes; and certain 
provisions (proposed paragraph (g) 
would apply only to tower cranes). 
Paragraph 1423(b) Boom Walkways 

Proposed paragraph (b) would 

establish when walkways must be 
incorporated into lattice booms and the 
criteria for such walkways. Boom 
walkways are not currently required by 
subpart N of this part. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would 

require that equipment manufactured 
more than one year after the effective 
date of this standard with a lattice boom 
be equipped with walkways on the 
boom if the vertical profile of the boom 
(from cord centerline to cord centerline) 
is 6 or more feet. C–DAC believed that 

the installation of walkways on booms 
would decrease the number of falls 
which occur during assembly/ 
disassembly, inspection, and 
maintenance of booms and attached 
devices. Without a walkway, employees 
walking the boom must step from lattice 
to lattice. C–DAC believed it is safer to 
walk the boom if the boom is equipped 
with a walkway. 

C–DAC considered the technical 

difficulty of equipping a boom with a 
vertical profile of less than 6 feet. Such 
booms would not accommodate the 
addition of a walkway into their design 
because the added weight of the 
walkway would significantly 
compromise their hoisting capacity. For 
that reason, C–DAC limited the 
requirement for boom walkways to 
equipment with lattice booms where the 
vertical profile of the boom is 6 feet or 
more. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2), Boom 
walkway criteria, would establish a 
minimum width for boom walkways 
and address safety issues associated 
with guardrails, railings and other 
attachments.55 Proposed 
§ 1926.1423(b)(2)(i) would require that 
walkways on booms be at least 12 
inches wide. C–DAC considered 
requiring boom walkways to be at least 
18 inches wide to remain consistent 
with § 1926.451(b)(2) of the scaffold 
standard (Subpart L). However, C–DAC 
determined that there are engineering 
limitations applicable to booms that are 
not applicable to scaffolds. Specifically, 
the Committee found that an 18 inch 
requirement would present feasibility 
problems, especially on smaller booms. 
In such cases an 18 inch walkway’s 
added weight would unduly impinge 
upon the equipment’s capacity. 

C–DAC believed that a walkway with 
a 12 inch width, while not as easy to use 
as an 18 inch walkway, would provide 
enough space for an employee to 
maintain his/her balance while walking 
from point to point on the boom when 
the boom is positioned horizontally. 
This would be a significant 
improvement over having to step across 
the open space between the boom’s 
lattice-work and onto the lattice. In sum, 
the Committee concluded that the 
benefits obtained by providing a 
walkway on booms outweigh any 
drawbacks associated with a minimum 
width of 12 inches. Note that, in many 
circumstances, the safety benefits 
afforded by this walkway would be 
supplemented by fall protection 
equipment (see the discussion below of 
proposed paragraphs (d) and (e)). 

55 These criteria would apply to all boom 
walkways, not just those on lattice booms.

59800 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii) would 
address the use of guardrails, railings 
and other permanent fall protection 
attachments along walkways. The 
general fall protection standard for 
construction work at § 1926.501(b)(6) 
requires that walkways be equipped 
with guardrail systems to protect 
workers against falling 6 feet or more. 
This proposed section would retain the 
general requirement for fall protection at 
or above 6 feet for certain work (see 
discussion below of § 1926.1423(d)), but 
C–DAC believed that guardrails should 
not be a required form of fall protection 
on boom walkways because of the 
feasibility constraints discussed below. 
Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) states 

that guardrails, railings and other 
permanent fall protection attachments 
along boom walkways would not be 
required. For some equipment, the 
added weight of fixed railings, 
combined with the walkway’s weight, 
would unduly impinge upon the lift 
capacity of the boom. In addition, as 
discussed in relation to 
§ 1926.1423(b)(2)(ii)(B) below, in some 
boom designs pendant ropes and bars 
(where present) could become snagged 
on such railings. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) 

would prohibit guardrails, railings and 
other permanent fall protection 
attachments along walkways on booms 
supported by pendant ropes or bars if 
the guardrails, railings or attachments 
could be snagged by the ropes or bars. 
Such snagging could cause instability or 
a collapse. Whether the potential for 
snagging is present on a boom 
supported by pendant ropes or bars 
would depend on the design of the 
equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) 

would prohibit removable-type 
guardrails, railings, and other 
permanent fall protection along 
walkways. For purposes of this 
paragraph, ‘‘removable-type’’ means 
designed to be installed and removed 
each time the boom is assembled/ 
disassembled. One of the Committee’s 
concerns was that such devices may be 
left installed by mistake, which could 
damage the equipment and cause 
unexpected movement or a failure 
during its operation. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(b)(2)(ii)(D), where guardrails or railings 
are not prohibited, they would be 
permitted to be of any height up to, but 
not more than, 45 inches. C–DAC 
believed that requiring all guardrails 
and handrails to comply with the height 
criteria in Subpart M of this part, which 
generally requires them to be 39 to 45 
inches high, could deter manufacturers 
from equipping their products with 

guardrails and handrails. That is 
because meeting Subpart M’s height 
criteria could make the device 
incompatible with the design and 
operation of the boom. For boom 
walkway applications, C–DAC 
concluded that using guardrails lower 
than 39 inches when higher guardrails 
are infeasible was preferable to not 
having any guardrails at all. 
Paragraph 1423(c) Steps, Handholds, 
Grabrails, Guardrails and Railings 

Proposed paragraph (c) would specify 

criteria for the use and maintenance of 
steps, handholds, grabrails, guardrails 
and railings. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1) would 
require that the employer maintain 
originally-equipped steps, handholds, 
ladders and guardrails/railings/grabrails 
in good condition. The failure to 
properly maintain such devices could 
pose dangers to the employees who use 
them. For example, a grabrail that has 
become weakened from rust could fail 
when an employee uses it, which could 
cause the employee to fall. Another 
example is a missing railing. A 
manufacturer that integrated a railing 
into its design may have provided a 
walking surface that would otherwise be 
too narrow to be safe. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2) would 

require that equipment manufactured 
more than one year after the effective 
date of this standard be equipped to 
provide safe access and egress between 
the ground and the operator work 
station(s), including the forward and 
rear operator positions, by the provision 
of devices such as steps, handholds, 
ladders, and guardrails/railings/ 
grabrails. As discussed below, proposed 
§ 1926.1423(c)(2)(i) would require these 
devices to meet updated design criteria. 

Currently, § 1926.550(a)(13)(i) in 
Subpart N requires that guardrails, 
handholds, and steps be provided on 
cranes for easy access to the car and cab 
and specifies that these devices conform 
to ANSI B30.5. The 1968 version of 
ANSI B30.5, which was in effect at the 
time Subpart N was issued, specifies 
that the construction of these devices 
must conform to the 1946 U.S. Safety 
Appliance Standard. C–DAC recognized 
that many pieces of equipment now in 
use would have been manufactured 
with handholds and steps but was 
concerned that the handholds and steps 
may have been designed to meet 
outdated criteria. 

The Committee believed that it would 

be unduly burdensome to require all 
equipment to be retrofitted with new 
steps, handholds, and railings simply 
because the existing design may vary 
from what would be required under this 

proposal. Accordingly, the proposal 
would allow one year from the date of 
the published final rule for equipment 
to be manufactured with devices that 
conform to proposed 1926.1423(c)(2)(i), 
discussed next. This would give 
equipment manufacturers adequate time 
to incorporate the requirements of 
§ 1926.1423(c)(2)(i) into their products. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(i) would 

require that steps, ladders and 
guardrails/railings/ grabrails meet the 
requirements of SAE J185 (May 2003) or 
ISO 11660–2 (1994). OSHA’s 
construction standards contain 
specifications for stairways and ladders 
in 29 CFR Part 1926 subpart X, but C– 
DAC believed that the Subpart X 
requirements do not take into account 
the characteristics of the equipment 
covered by this proposed standard. The 
specifications in SAE J185 are 
referenced in industry consensus 
standards, such as ASME B30.5–2004, 
‘‘Mobile and Locomotive Cranes,’’ and 
crane manufacturers are familiar with 
those requirements. C–DAC 
recommended alternatively allowing 
compliance with ISO 11660–2 since 
employers also use equipment built by 
foreign manufacturers who have been 
following that standard. 

Under proposed paragraph (a) of this 
section, the requirements in proposed 
paragraph § 1926.1423(c)(2) do not 
apply to tower cranes. It is the Agency’s 
understanding that C–DAC excluded 
tower cranes from these requirements 
because the SAE and ISO standards 
referenced in § 1926.1423(c)(2)(i) are 
designed for, and only address, mobile 
cranes. The Agency also believes that 
the lack of a similar provision in the 
C–DAC document designed for tower 
cranes was an oversight; tower cranes 
also need to be equipped with safe 
stairways and ladders to enable the 
operator to ascend to the cab and 
descend safely.56 Accordingly, OSHA 
plans to include a requirement similar 
to § 1926.1423(c)(2) that would be 
applicable to, and designed for, tower 
cranes, and requests public comment on 
this issue. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(ii) would 
require that walking/stepping surfaces, 
except for crawler treads, have slip- 
resistant features/properties (such as 
diamond plate metal, strategically 
placed grip tape, expanded metal, or 
slip-resistant paint). Section 
1926.550(a)(13)(iii) of Subpart N of this 
part requires platforms and walkways to 
have anti-skid surfaces. C–DAC 

56 Note that section 3–1.17.2 of both the 1996 and 
2004 versions of ASME B30.3, ‘‘Construction Tower 
Cranes,’’ calls for access ladders to the cab, 
machinery platform, and tower to conform to ANSI 
A14.3 or to SAE J185.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59801 

recommended that OSHA retain this 
requirement as a complement to the use 
of guardrails, handholds, grabrails, 
ladders and other engineered safety 
features that would be required by this 
proposed section. OSHA continues to 
believe that compliance with this 
provision would minimize the number 
of slips and falls for employees who 
must travel point to point to access the 
operator workstations on equipment 
covered by this proposed section. 
Paragraph 1423(d) Fall Protection 
Requirements for Non-Assembly/ 
Disassembly Work 

Proposed paragraph (d) addresses fall 
protection requirements for employees 
engaged in work other than assembly/ 
disassembly work (‘‘non-A/D’’ work). 
For such work, in certain circumstances, 
employers would be required to provide 
and ensure the use of fall protection 
equipment for employees who are on a 
walking/working surface with an 
unprotected side or edge more than 6 
feet above a lower level. 

C–DAC discussed different trigger 

heights for fall protection requirements 
for particular types of cranes and 
derricks. Ultimately, C–DAC concluded 
that the requirements for fall protection 
should remain consistent with 29 CFR 
Part subpart M, which generally 
requires fall protection at heights at and 
above 6 feet, as much as possible. (As 
discussed below, for A/D work, the 
Committee recommended fall protection 
beginning at 15 feet). C–DAC also 
believed that, in its view, operators do 
not need to be tied off while moving to 
and from their cabs, and the proposal 
would make this clear by requiring fall 
protection equipment only when 
employees are moving point-to-point on 
booms or while at a work station (with 
certain exceptions). The Committee 
believed that the steps, handholds, and 
railings required under proposed 
§ 1926.1423(c) would protect operators 
moving to and from their workstations 
and eliminate the need for additional 
fall protection equipment. 
Paragraph 1423(d)(1) Non-Assembly/ 
Disassembly: Moving Point to Point 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(i) would 

require employers to provide and ensure 
the use of fall protection equipment at 
6 feet and above when an employee is 
moving point to point on non-lattice 
booms (whether horizontal or not 
horizontal). As defined in § 1926.1401, 
‘‘moving point to point’’ means ‘‘the 
times during which an employee is in 
the process of going to or from a work 
station.’’ 

C–DAC believed that non-lattice 

booms generally present more hazards 

to workers who must walk them to 
reach other work areas, devices, and 
equipment attached to it than lattice 
booms. Non-lattice booms are typically 
of the extensible type. As a result, as 
members noted, the walking/working 
surfaces on these types of booms are 
often oily (from the hydraulic 
mechanisms). Also, since the boom 
sections extend and retract, it is 
typically infeasible to provide boom 
walkways and other safety features. 
Because they tend to be slippery from 
oil, the Committee concluded that they 
are especially hazardous to move across 
even when horizontal. Therefore, where 
an employee is required to move point 
to point on a non-lattice boom, the 
proposal would require fall protection 
above 6 feet in height. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(ii) would 

require employers to provide and ensure 
the use of fall protection, beginning at 
6 feet, when employees must move 
point to point on lattice booms that are 
not in a horizontal position. In non-A/ 
D work, an employee may, for example, 
need to move point-to-point on a lattice 
boom to inspect a part that is suspected 
to need repair, or to make a repair (such 
as replacing a broken or missing cotter 
pin). In many of these situations, the 
boom will not be horizontal, since space 
limitations often make it difficult to 
lower the boom to do this work. 

The Committee believed that it is both 
necessary and feasible for fall protection 
to be used in such instances. Typically, 
the fall protection that would be used 
would consist of a double-lanyard or 
similar personal fall arrest system. Since 
the boom in these instances would be 
elevated, there would usually be a point 
on the boom above the level of the 
employee’s feet to which the lanyard 
could be attached. 

It is the Agency’s understanding that, 

in contrast, it is uncommon for an 
employee to need to move point-to- 
point on a horizontal lattice boom for 
non-A/D work. If work does need to be 
done, such as making an inspection or 
repair as discussed above, the employee 
would usually get access to their work 
station with a ladder. In those instances 
when the employee must traverse the 
boom itself, the Committee concluded 
that it would be inappropriate to require 
fall protection for the reasons discussed 
below. 

The key difficulty in providing fall 

protection in such instances stems from 
the lack of a tie-off point above the level 
of the employee’s feet. Most lattice 
booms when horizontal would be less 
than 15 feet above the next lower level. 
At heights below 15 feet, a personal fall 
arrest system tied off at the level of the 
employee’s feet, with a lanyard long

enough to afford the employee the range 
of movement necessary for this work, 
might not prevent the employee from 
falling to the next lower level. In 
construction work the problem of 
providing personal fall protection in 
this height range, when there is no 
higher tie-off point, is usually solved in 
one of three ways (apart from the use of 
ladders, scaffolds, aerial lifts, and 
similar devices). One way is to use a 
restraint system, which is anchored at a 
point that prevents the employee from 
moving past an edge. This type of 
system could not be used while on a 
boom because the boom is too narrow. 

Another method is to set up a 

personal fall arrest system that would 
arrest the employee’s fall before hitting 
the next lower level by using stanchions 
to support an elevated, horizontal life- 
line. However, such stanchions must be 
securely fastened and whatever they are 
fastened to must be able to withstand 
considerable forces in an arrested fall. 
On a crane’s lattice boom, the 
stanchions would have to be attached 
either to the chords or the lacings. 

The chords and lacings are engineered 

to be as light as possible, and an 
engineering analysis would be needed 
in each case to determine if the 
attachment point was sufficiently strong 
to withstand those forces. Also, the 
Agency believes that manufacturers 
would be unlikely to approve clamp-on 
type systems because of the likelihood 
of the clamping forces damaging these 
critical structural components. 
Similarly, the Agency believes that 
manufacturers would not approve the 
repeated weld/removal/re-weld cycles 
that would be involved in attaching and 
removing stanchions because this could 
adversely affect the boom’s structural 
components. 

The third method commonly used in 

construction work is a temporary 
guardrail system, but that also would 
require attaching stanchions to the 
boom, which would be infeasible for 
these same reasons. 

The Committee concluded that, in 
light of such factors, it would not be 
appropriate to require fall protection 
when an employee moves point-to-point 
on horizontal lattice booms. However, 
the Agency notes that, although it may 
rarely be necessary for an employee 
moving point-to-point on a horizontal 
lattice boom to be 15 feet or more above 
the next lower level, there is the 
possibility of such an occurrence, such 
as where a horizontal boom spans a 
large gap in the ground surface. At such 
heights a personal fall arrest system tied 
off at the level of the employee’s feet 
would allow sufficient room for the 
arrest system to operate without

allowing the employee to strike the next 
lower level. Therefore, the Agency 
requests public comment on whether 
proposed § 1926.1423(d)(1)(ii) should be 
expanded to require fall protection 
when an employee, engaged in 
non-A/D work, is moving point-to-point 
on a boom that is horizontal and the fall 
distance is 15 feet or more. 
Paragraph 1423(d)(2) Non-Assembly/ 
Disassembly: While at a Work Station 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2) would 

require employers to provide and ensure 
the use of fall protection while an 
employee is at a work station on any 
part of the equipment (including the 
boom, of any type), except when the 
employee is at or near draw-works 
(when the equipment is running), in the 
cab, or on the deck. An example of 
being at a work station is the following: 
An employee is assigned to replace a 
cotter pin for a sheave at the end of a 
boom. The employee’s ‘‘work station’’ 
on the boom for this task will be the 
point where, after the employee has 
traversed the boom or climbed on from 
a ladder, the employee performs that 
task. Because the employee is using one 
or both hands to perform the task, there 
is a heightened risk of falling. 

Since the work is typically done 

while the employee is sitting or lying on 
or inside the boom and is stationary 
while doing the task, there is normally 
no difficulty in setting up the personal 
fall protection system so that it would 
prevent the worker from contacting the 
next lower level. Therefore, this 
proposed provision does not distinguish 
between work stations based on boom 
type or whether the boom is horizontal 
or elevated. For work stations on other 
parts of the equipment, the Committee 
concluded that there is normally some 
suitable point available to which a 
personal fall arrest system can be 
anchored. 

Fall protection would not be required 
near draw-works when the equipment is 
running because of the danger that 
moving parts could catch a safety 
lanyard and pull the worker into 
moving machinery. This danger is 
present when parts in the draw works 
are moving. It is also present when the 
equipment is running and the draw 
works parts are not moving because of 
the potential that someone will activate 
those parts. 

Fall protection would not be required 
when the employee is in a cab because 
the employee is not exposed to a fall 
hazard in that instance. Fall protection 
would also not be required for 
employees on decks, since the 
Committee believed that equipment is 
typically designed so that employees on

the deck are not exposed to a fall 
hazard. 

As discussed earlier, C–DAC was 

convinced that the steps and railings 
required by this proposed standard 
would provide adequate fall protection 
to operators going to and from their 
workstations. Therefore, fall protection 
(apart from those devices) would not be 
required for operators while moving 
point-to-point between the ground and 
the operator work station(s). 
Paragraph 1423(e) Assembly/ 
Disassembly 

Proposed paragraph (e) would require 
the employer to provide and ensure the 
use of fall protection equipment during 
A/D work for employees who are on a 
walking/working surface with an 
unprotected side or edge more than 15 
feet above a lower level, except when 
the employee is at or near draw-works 
(when the equipment is running), in the 
cab, or on the deck. 

The principal problem with the use of 

fall protection during assembly/ 
disassembly below 15 feet is the 
difficulty in setting up a personal fall 
protection system that allows a 
significant degree of movement on a 
boom in this height range (which is 
usually of the lattice type) and also 
prevents the employee from contacting 
the next lower level. Unlike employees 
who work at a stationary work station, 
employees engaged in assembly/ 
disassembly work typically have to 
move a significant amount to 
accomplish the work. 

Consequently, the degree of 

movement that the protection system 
needs to provide to the employee is 
more similar to what is needed when 
moving point-to-point on a boom than 
working at a work station. As discussed 
above, the characteristics of lattice 
booms make it more difficult to set up 
such systems than in other situations. 
The exception to the requirement for 
fall protection when the employee is at 
or near draw-works (when the 
equipment is running), in the cab, or on 
the deck is based on the same 
considerations discussed above with 
respect to proposed § 1926.1423(d)(2). 
Paragraph 1423(f) Anchorage Criteria 
Proposed paragraph (f) would specify 

criteria for anchorage points used in 
personal fall protection systems.57 

57 ‘‘Personal fall arrest system’’ is defined in 

§ 1926.1401 of this proposed standard as ‘‘a system 
used to arrest an employee in a fall from a working 
level. It consists of an anchorage, connectors, a 
body harness and may include a lanyard, 
deceleration device, lifeline, or suitable 
combination of these.’’ This definition is taken from 
§ 1926.500(b) of Subpart M. As with other 

Proposed paragraph (f)(1), Anchorages 

for fall arrest and positioning device 
systems, contains requirements for 
anchorage points used in fall arrest and 
positioning device systems. Proposed 
§ 1926.1423(f)(1)(i) would permit 
personal fall arrest systems and 
positioning systems to be anchored to 
any apparently substantial part of the 
equipment unless a competent person, 
from a visual inspection, without an 
engineering analysis, would conclude 
that the applicable criteria in § 1926.502 
of Subpart M of this part would not be 
met. The Subpart M criteria include, for 
personal fall arrest systems, 5,000 
pounds per employee or twice the 
potential impact load of an employee’s 
fall (in addition to other requirements) 
(§ 1926.502(d)(15)); for a positioning 
device, 3,000 pounds or twice the 
potential impact load of an employee’s 
fall, whichever is greater (in addition to 
other requirements) (§ 1926.502(e)(2)). 

Most of the equipment covered by the 

proposed standard are designed to lift 
and support weights much heavier than 
these. Apparently substantial parts of 
the equipment are, therefore, typically 
capable of meeting the Subpart M 
capacities. Consequently, C–DAC 
believed that the proposed 
§ 1926.1423(f)(1)(i) criteria was 
appropriate and would avoid burdening 
employers with what it considered to be 
the unnecessary expense of obtaining 
engineering analyses for each part that 
would serve as an anchor. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(1)(ii) would 
require that attachable anchor devices 
(portable anchor devices that are 
attached to the equipment) meet the 
applicable anchorage criteria in 
§ 1926.502. These criteria are the same 
as those discussed in the previous 
paragraph for fall arrest and fall 
positioning systems. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2), Anchorages 

for restraint systems, would require 
restraint systems to be anchored to any 
part of the equipment that is capable of 
withstanding twice the maximum load 
that a worker may impose on it during 
reasonably anticipated conditions of 
use. Since restraint systems do not 
arrest a worker’s fall (instead they 
prevent a fall from occurring), the 
anchorage does not need to be able to 
support the significantly greater force 
generated during an arrested fall. C– 
DAC believed that having the anchorage 
support twice the maximum anticipated 
load will provide an adequate margin of 
safety when a restraint system is used. 

definitions applicable to this section, C–DAC used 
terminology that is familiar to the industry to 
provide clear notice of the standard’s requirements 
and promote compliance.

59803 

Paragraph 1423(g) Tower Cranes 

Proposed paragraph (g) would specify 
fall protection requirements specific to 
tower cranes. Note that the terminology 
‘‘erecting’’ and ‘‘dismantling’’ is used 
with regard to tower cranes rather than 
‘‘assembly’’ and ‘‘disassembly’’; this 
terminology reflects the industry’s use 
of these terms. 
Paragraph 1423(g)(1) Non-Erecting/ 
Dismantling 

Proposed paragraph (g)(1) addresses 

fall protection requirements for non- 
erecting/dismantling work. The 
employer would be required to provide 
and ensure the use of fall protection 
equipment for employees who are on a 
walking/working surface with an 
unprotected side or edge more than 6 
feet above a lower level. The exceptions 
to this requirement would be when the 
employee is at or near draw-works 
(when the equipment is running), in the 
cab, or on the deck. 

As discussed above, for equipment 

other than tower cranes, there were 
various factors that prompted C–DAC to 
agree on different requirements for 
moving point-to-point than when 
working at a work station. Those factors, 
however, are not present in tower 
cranes. 

For example, when moving point-to- 

point on the jib (or boom) or on the 
tower, there are no feasibility 
constraints to being protected. There are 
numerous areas on the jib to which an 
employee can anchor personal fall arrest 
equipment as the employee walks out 
and back on the jib (or boom) on a tower 
crane. Also, by standard industry 
practice, the counter-jib 58 is usually 
equipped with a walkway and railings. 
If the employee needs to traverse in an 
area that is off the walkway, other fall 
protection can be used, such as a 
personal fall arrest system. Since the jib 
(or boom) once erected is much higher 
than 6 feet from the next lower level, 
there is plenty of room for the arrest 
system to operate without allowing the 
employee to strike the next lower level. 
Moving point-to-point on the tower is 
typically done either using the ladder or 
stair system provided within the tower, 
or (in some situations) moving on a 
tower section. When moving on a tower 
section, because the sections are 
vertical, there is always a point above 
the employee’s feet to which the arrest 
system can be anchored. There is 

58 At the top of the tower, there is a long 

horizontal structure that supports the load (the 
‘‘jib’’ or, if the luffing type, the ‘‘boom’’), and a 
shorter horizontal structure that supports the 
counterweights, which is referred to as the 
‘‘counter-jib.’’

therefore no need for stanchions or 
other equipment to set up the system to 
prevent the employee from striking the 
next lower level. 

The exception to the proposed 

provision for fall protection when the 
employee is at or near draw-works 
(when the equipment is running), in the 
cab, or on the deck is based on the same 
considerations discussed above with 
respect to proposed § 1926.1423(d)(2). 
The Agency notes that its understanding 
of the location of ‘‘the deck’’ on a tower 
crane is the walking/working area on 
the counter-jib. 
Paragraph 1423(g)(2) Erecting/ 
Dismantling 

This proposed paragraph specifies 
that, for erecting/dismantling work, 
employers must provide, and ensure use 
of, fall protection equipment for 
employees who are on a walking/ 
working surface with an unprotected 
side or edge more than 15 feet above a 
lower level. 

On tower cranes, almost all of the 
erecting/dismantling work that takes 
place below 15 feet occurs in 
connection with erecting or dismantling 
the sections of the jib (or boom), which 
is usually done on the ground. In this 
respect the erecting/dismantling process 
is similar to the assembly/disassembly 
of other types of cranes. Therefore, the 
same reasons for setting a 15–foot 
threshold for requiring fall protection 
for assembling/disassembling non-tower 
cranes (see discussion of proposed 
paragraph (e) above) are also the basis 
for proposing to require fall protection 
beginning at 15 feet for erecting and 
dismantling tower cranes. 

The Agency notes that C–DAC did not 

include the exceptions that were 
included in proposed § 1926.1423(g)(1) 
for when the employee is at or near 
draw-works (when the equipment is 
running), in the cab, or on the deck. 
OSHA is unaware of any reason why 
these exceptions would not be equally 
applicable here, and asks for public 
comment on whether they should be 
added to proposed § 1926.1423(g)(2). 
Paragraph 1423(h) Anchoring to the 
Load Line 

Proposed paragraph (h) would permit 

an employer, under prescribed 
conditions, to anchor a fall arrest system 
to the hook or other part of a load line 
of a crane or derrick. Currently, in 
Subpart M of this part, § 1926.502(d)(23) 
prohibits personal fall arrest systems to 
be attached to ‘‘hoists except as 
specified in other subparts of this part.’’ 
Subpart N does not contain any 
provisions specifically addressing this 
issue. Therefore, since the hook or other 

part of a load line is connected to a hoist 
in the crane or for the derrick, attaching 
a personal fall arrest system in this 
manner is currently prohibited by 
Subpart M. 

OSHA has received a number of 

inquiries asking whether a crane’s hook 
or load line may be used as an 
anchorage point for fall protection. 
Using a crane for such purpose would 
be particularly useful in many 
situations, especially where establishing 
a suitable anchor point would be 
otherwise very difficult. OSHA asked C– 
DAC to consider whether there is any 
reason to prohibit using a crane or 
derrick for such purpose. C–DAC 
believed that the hook or load line of a 
crane could be used safely as an anchor 
point under the conditions proposed in 
the rest of this paragraph. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(1) would 

allow the hook or load line to be used 
as an anchorage point when a qualified 
person has determined that the set-up 
and rated capacity of the crane/derrick 
(including the hook, load line and 
rigging) meets or exceeds the 
requirements in § 1926.502(d)(15). C– 
DAC concluded that, as long as the 
crane or derrick had sufficient capacity 
to meet those criteria, there is no reason 
to prohibit its use for this purpose. 

The criteria in § 1926.502(d)(15) were 
developed to ensure that fall protection 
anchorages provide adequate employee 
protection. A number of factors related 
to the crane’s capacity in the particular 
configuration and set-up involved 
would need to be considered, including, 
in some cases, the angle of the fall arrest 
lanyard to the boom if a fall were to 
occur. In C–DAC’s view, determining 
whether those criteria are met when 
anchoring to the hook or load line 
requires the expertise of a qualified 
person. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(2) would 

require that the equipment operator be 
at the work site and informed that the 
equipment is being used to anchor a fall 
arrest system. This would ensure that 
the operator is available to make any 
necessary adjustments, such as moving 
the boom or load lines. Further, in the 
event of an emergency that results in a 
tied-off employee being suspended from 
the hook or load line, the operator 
would be available to bring the worker 
to the ground safely. 
Section 1424 Work Area Control 

Proposed paragraph (a) addresses the 

hazard of employees being struck, 
pinched-between or crushed when 
within the swing radius of the 
equipment’s rotating superstructure. 
Proposed 1926.1424(a)(1) states that the 
precautions in § 1926.1424(a)(2) must be

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

taken when there are accessible areas in 
which the equipment’s rotating 
superstructure (whether permanently or 
temporarily mounted) poses a 
reasonably foreseeable risk of either: (i) 
Striking and injuring an employee; or 
(ii) pinching/crushing an employee 
against another part of the equipment or 
another object. 

Currently, § 1926.550(a)(9) provides: 

‘‘Accessible areas within the swing 
radius of the rear of the rotating 
superstructure of the crane, either 
permanently or temporarily mounted, 
shall be barricaded in such a manner as 
to prevent an employee from being 
struck or crushed by the crane.’’ In 
proposed § 1926.1401, ‘‘superstructure’’ 
is defined as a synonym for 
‘‘upperworks’’ and ‘‘upperstructure.’’ 
Under this definition, all three terms 
mean the following: ‘‘the revolving 
frame of equipment on which the engine 
and operating machinery are mounted 
along with the operator’s cab. The 
counterweight is typically supported on 
the rear of the upperstructure and the 
boom or other front end attachment is 
mounted on the front.’’ 

The Committee agreed that barriers 
around danger areas are a viable, safe 
option, but they also agreed that such 
barriers are not always feasible and that, 
in such cases, there needs to be 
alternative means of protecting the 
employees. In addition, C–DAC was 
concerned that the language ‘‘accessible 
areas within the swing radius . * * *’’ 
would require that all areas accessible to 
an employee within the swing radius 
would have to be protected, irrespective 
of whether an employee could be 
injured while in such an area. C–DAC 
viewed such a requirement as overly 
broad and unnecessary. 

The Committee drafted the proposed 
requirement so that protective measures 
would be required for accessible areas 
that pose a ‘‘reasonably foreseeable risk’’ 
that an employee would be struck or 
pinched/crushed. The principle of 
reasonably foreseeable risk is one that is 
well established in Occupational Safety 
and Health Review Commission caselaw 
and in the courts of appeals. For 
example, in Pete Miller Inc., 19 O.S.H.C. 
(BNA) 1257, 1258 (Rev. Comm’n 2000), 
the Review Commission stated that a 
violation occurs when ‘‘it is reasonably 
predictable either by operational 
necessity or otherwise (including 
inadvertence), that employees have 
been, are, or will be in the zone of 
danger.’’ 59 The following are two

illustrative examples of the application 
of this principle to the swing radius 
provision: 

Illustrative example #1: The bottom of the 
rear of the rotating superstructure of crane A 
is 12 feet above the ground. An employee 
standing on the ground within that swing 
radius could not be struck by the rotating 
superstructure since the rotating 
superstructure would swing well above him/ 
her. There is nothing within that area on 
which the employee could stand. In this 
example the area does not pose a reasonably 
foreseeable risk of the employee being struck 
or pinched/crushed. 

Illustrative example #2: Same scenario as 
example #1 above, except that a truck with 
material that is to be unloaded from its bed 
is within the swing radius. If an employee 
were to stand on the truck bed the employee 
would be within the swing radius. In this 
example there is a reasonably foreseeable risk 
of an employee being struck or pinched/ 
crushed. 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(2), the 
employer would be required to institute 
two types of measures to prevent 
employees from entering these hazard 
areas. Specifically, under proposed 
§ 1926.1424(a)(2)(i), the employer would 
have to train employees assigned to 
work on or near the equipment in how 
to recognize these areas. The Committee 
believed that employees need to 
understand and appreciate the risk 
posed by the rotating superstructure for 
the other precautions required by 
§ 1926.1424(a)(2)(ii) to be effective. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(ii) would 

require the employer to erect and 
maintain control lines, warning lines, 
railings, or similar barriers to mark the 
boundaries of the hazard areas, but 
contains an exception when such a 
precaution is infeasible. If it is neither 
feasible to erect such barriers on the 
ground nor on the equipment, the 
employer would be required to mark the 
danger zone with a combination of 
warning signs and high visibility 
markings on the equipment that identify 
the hazard areas. In addition, the 
employer would have to train 
employees to understand what those 
markings signify. 

To help prevent struck-by and 

crushed-by injuries and fatalities, C– 
DAC concluded that it is necessary to 
address the protection of employees 
who must sometimes enter the hazard 
area to perform work. Proposed 
§ 1926.1424(a)(3) is designed to help 
protect such employees by ensuring that 
there is adequate communication and 
coordination between the operator and 
the employee in the danger area. 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(3)(i), if 
an employee is going to go to a location 
in a hazard area that is out of view of 
the operator, before that employee goes 

in that area the employee (or someone 
instructed by the employee) would have 
to ensure that the operator is informed 
that the employee is going to that 
location. Since the operator will 
typically be under the assumption that 
no one is in that area, informing the 
operator that an employee is going to 
enter the hazard area is an essential first 
step in preventing the operator from 
moving the superstructure and causing 
injury to that employee. 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(3)(ii), 

once informed that an employee is going 
to enter a hazard area out of the 
operator’s view, the operator would be 
prohibited from rotating the 
superstructure unless and until he/she 
gives a warning that the employee 
understands is a signal that the 
superstructure is about to be rotated and 
gives the employee time to get clear. 

Alternatively, the operator may rotate 

the superstructure if informed in 
accordance with a pre-arranged system 
of communication that the employee is 
in a safe position. An example of such 
a system would be the use of a signal 
person who gives an all-clear signal to 
the operator once the signal person sees 
that the employee has exited the hazard 
area. Another example would be where 
the employee in the hazard area is 
equipped with a portable air horn and, 
in accordance with a pre-arranged horn 
signal system, sounds an appropriate 
signal to the operator that the employee 
has exited the hazard area. To be 
effective, the pre-arranged signal system 
would need to be designed so that this 
all-clear signal could not be confused 
with a horn signal from some other 
employee for another purpose. 

Proposed paragraph (b) addresses 
situations where multiple pieces of 
equipment are located in such 
proximity that their working radii 
overlap. Such situations pose the danger 
of employees being pinched/crushed 
between the equipment and being 
injured as a result of unintended 
movement or collapse when pieces of 
equipment collide. To prevent such 
accidents, the controlling entity would 
be required to coordinate the operations 
of these pieces of equipment. In the 
event that there is no controlling entity, 
the employer or employers operating the 
equipment would be required to 
institute a coordination system. 

C–DAC’s language for proposed 
paragraph (b) refers to ‘‘employers 
operating the equipment’’ but does not 
address a situation in which only one 
employer is operating the multiple 
pieces of equipment. It appears to the 
Agency that a coordination system is 
also needed in that situation. OSHA is 
considering revising the C–DAC

language to make clear that such an 
employer would be required to institute 
a coordination system. Proposed 
§ 1926.1424(b) could be revised in this 
regard as follows: 

(b) Multiple equipment coordination. 

Where any part of a crane/derrick is within 
the working radius of another crane/derrick, 
the controlling entity shall institute a system 
to coordinate operations. If there is no 
controlling entity, the employer (if there is 
only one employer operating the multiple 
pieces of equipment), or employers, shall 
institute such a system. 

OSHA requests public comment on 

whether such a revision should be 
made. 
Section 1425 Keeping Clear of the 
Load 

Currently, 29 CFR part 1926 subpart 

N at § 1926.550(a)(19) states: ‘‘All 
employees shall be kept clear of loads 
about to be lifted and of suspended 
loads.’’ C–DAC believed that 
compliance with this provision is 
infeasible in certain circumstances. For 
example, many urban construction sites 
have a relatively small footprint with 
numerous construction employees 
throughout the site. These sites are 
typically bounded on all sides by roads 
and sidewalks with high concentrations 
of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. In 
such circumstances it is not always 
possible to route a suspended load in 
such a way that all employees will be 
clear of the load at all times. In addition, 
meeting that objective may sometimes 
conflict with meeting local requirements 
regarding public safety. 

C–DAC also believed that employers 

have a greater ability to avoid having 
static suspended loads over employees 
than moving loads, since a static 
suspended load usually affects a much 
smaller area. Furthermore, in a static 
situation, it is possible to limit the 
number of employees in the fall zone to 
only those whose jobs involve the 
handling of the load and therefore 
require them to be in that area at that 
time. Accordingly, this proposed section 
is designed to account for these 
considerations and protect employees to 
the extent feasible. 
Paragraph 1425(a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) would require 
the employer to use hoisting routes that 
minimize employee exposure to hoisted 
loads to the extent consistent with 
public safety. This provision addresses 
the fact that in many situations, 
especially urban construction sites with 
high concentrations of employees 
throughout the site, it is not feasible to 
prevent all employees from being 
exposed to hoisted loads that are 

moving at all times (see discussion 
above). 

Also, C–DAC recognized that there 
could be situations where minimizing 
employee exposure to hoisted loads 
would be in conflict with local 
requirements regarding public safety, as 
when an alternative route would take 
the load over a street with public traffic. 
The Committee wanted to make clear 
that choosing a route that would 
endanger the public was not required. 
Paragraph 1425(b) 

Proposed paragraph (b) addresses 

those situations where the equipment 
operator is not actually engaging the 
controls to move the load. In such 
situations, the load affects a more 
limited area then when it is moved up 
or horizontally. Consequently, C–DAC 
determined that, in these static 
situations, it is feasible to preclude most 
employee exposure to the load’s fall 
zone. The only exceptions are 
employees engaged in the types of 
activities specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1425(b)(1) through (3). 

‘‘Fall zone’’ is defined in § 1926.1401 
as ‘‘the area (including but not limited 
to the area directly beneath the load) in 
which it is reasonably foreseeable that 
partially or completely suspended 
materials could fall in the event of an 
accident.’’ The ‘‘fall zone’’ thus includes 
both the area directly under the load as 
well as other areas into which it is 
‘‘reasonably foreseeable’’ that 
suspended materials could fall. For 
example, if wind is causing the load to 
swing, the employer would need to 
consider the extent to which the load is 
or may swing in determining the extent 
of the fall zone. Another example is 
where a bundle of materials is 
suspended, and some loose materials at 
the top of the bundle may slide off 
sideways. In such a case those materials 
would foreseeably fall outside the area 
directly beneath the load. As discussed 
above in relation to § 1926.1424, Work 
area control, the concept of ‘‘reasonably 
foreseeable’’ risk is well established in 
OSHA law. 

Proposed paragraph 1425(b)(1) would 

permit employees engaged in hooking, 
unhooking or guiding a load to be 
within the fall zone while engaged in 
these activities. Hooking or unhooking a 
load sometimes requires an employee to 
be within the fall zone of a load. For 
example, where a lifting accessory is 
used, the employee will typically be 
under the fall zone of the lifting 
accessory when attaching or unhooking 
the load. Also, guiding a load, even with 
a tag line, sometimes necessitates that 
the employee be positioned within the

fall zone, especially when the work area 
below is restricted in size. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would 

permit employees engaged in the initial 
attachment of the load to a component 
or structure to be within the fall zone. 
One example is the following scenario: 
A subassembly of steel members is 
hoisted for attachment to a structure. 
When initially attaching the lower 
portion of that subassembly, an 
employee is within the fall zone of the 
load. In this example, the employee 
engaged in the initial attachment of the 
subassembly to the structure would be 
permitted to be within the fall zone; that 
work cannot be done otherwise. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(3) would 

allow workers to be present in the fall 
zone when operating a concrete hopper 
or concrete bucket. The employee 
operating the hopper or bucket is 
necessarily in the fall zone since the 
hopper or bucket is suspended while 
the employee operates the releasing 
mechanism. 
Paragraph 1425(c) 

Proposed paragraph (c) deals with the 

situations addressed in paragraphs 
1425(b)(1) and (b)(2). The Committee 
felt that additional requirements were 
necessary to ensure employee safety in 
these situations, given the additional 
risks posed while loads are being 
connected to equipment or structures. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1) would 

require that the load be rigged to 
prevent unintentional displacement, so 
that workers in the fall zone are less 
likely to be struck by shifting materials. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2) would 
require the use of hooks with self- 
closing latches or their equivalent be 
used, to prevent accidental failure of the 
hooks. However, ‘‘J’’ type hooks would 
be permitted for setting wooden trusses. 
This exception is designed to enable the 
truss to be unhooked without the need 
for an employee to go out on the truss. 
This avoids the additional exposure to 
fall hazards that would otherwise occur 
from going out on the truss to release a 
latched hook. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3) would 

require the use of a qualified rigger in 
the rigging of materials in the situations 
addressed by proposed § 1926.1425(c). 
By ensuring that the load is rigged in as 
safe a manner as possible, this 
requirement serves to reduce the risk of 
injury to workers who cannot perform 
their duties outside of the fall zone, and 
reduces the potential size of the fall 
zone. 

Section 1401 of this proposed 

standard defines a ‘‘qualified rigger’’ as 
a rigger who meets the criteria for a 
qualified person. The same definition is

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

found in subpart R of 29 CFR Part 1926, 
Steel Erection at § 1926.753(c)(2). 
Paragraph 1425(d) Receiving a Load 

Proposed paragraph (d) would 

prohibit all employees except those 
needed to receive a load from being in 
the fall zone when it is being landed. An 
employee receiving a load will typically 
need to be within the fall zone when it 
is being landed because that is the time 
when the load needs to be guided to a 
specific landing point. 
Paragraph 1425(e) 

Proposed paragraph (e) concerns tilt- 

up and tilt-down operations. In these 
operations, one end of a component, 
such as a precast panel, is either raised, 
tilting the component up, usually from 
a horizontal position (often on the 
ground) to a vertical position; or 
lowered, tilting the component down, 
usually from a vertical position to a 
horizontal position on the ground or 
other surface.60 Note that the 
requirements in this proposed 
paragraph would not apply when 
receiving a load. 

As with any other suspended load, it 
is dangerous to be directly beneath the 
load because of the possibility of a 
failure or error that would cause the 
load to fall or be accidentally lowered 
onto an employee. To minimize the risk 
of such accidents, proposed 
§ 1926.1425(e)(1) provides that no 
employee shall be directly under the 
load during a tilt-up or tilt-down 
operation. Section 1926.1401 defines 
‘‘directly under the load’’ to mean ‘‘a 
part or all of an employee is directly 
beneath the load.’’ This provision will 
avoid having employees in the area that 
presents the greatest danger in the event 
of a loss of control of the load. 

While C–DAC determined that tilt-up 

and tilt-down operations can be 
accomplished without anyone being 
directly under the load, it also found 
that the operation is at times infeasible 
unless one or more employees 
‘‘essential to the operation’’ needs to be 
elsewhere within the fall zone. 
Proposed § 1926.1425(e)(2) therefore 
provides that employees ‘‘essential to 
the operation’’ may be in the fall zone 
(but not directly under the load) during 
a tilt up or tilt down operation. 

The C–DAC document does not 

contain a definition of ‘‘essential to the 
operation.’’ Consequently, the proposed 
provision does not specify what job 
functions would be permitted to be 

performed from within the fall zone. 
OSHA believes that examples of an 
employee ‘‘essential to the operation’’ is 
an employee who must be within the 
fall zone because it is infeasible to 
conduct the following operations from 
outside the fall zone: (1) Physically 
guide the load; (2) closely monitor and 
give instructions regarding the load’s 
movement; and/or (3) either detach it 
from or initially attach it to another 
component or structure. OSHA requests 
public comment on whether there are 
other activities that are essential to this 
operation and are infeasible to be done 
from outside the fall zone, and whether 
it would be appropriate to add a 
definition of ‘‘essential to the operation’’ 
to the standard. 

A note to paragraph (e) refers to 

§ 1926.1426, which addresses free fall of 
the boom and the load. As discussed 
below, it specifies that employees may 
not be anywhere in the fall zone of a 
boom that is designed to free fall, and 
that employees are never to be directly 
under the load during free fall of the 
load line hoist. 
Section 1426 Free Fall and Controlled 
Load Lowering 

This proposed section addresses the 
hazards that can arise from free fall of 
the boom (live boom) during lifts. Live 
booms are those in which the rate of 
lowering can be controlled only by a 
brake; a failure of the brake will result 
in a free fall (i.e., unrestricted lowering) 
of the boom. In contrast, in equipment 
that has a boom that is not ‘‘live,’’ there 
is a mechanism or device other than the 
brake which slows the boom’s lowering 
speed. 

The uncontrolled lowering of a boom 
could result in an accident which could 
injure or kill workers in proximity of the 
load or hoisting equipment. This 
proposed section would prohibit use of 
live booms in most circumstances. An 
exception is provided for older 
equipment manufactured before the 
ANSI B30.5 series prohibited free fall of 
the boom for all hoisting operations, but 
only under limited conditions that do 
not create hazards to employees. A 
limited exception is also provided for 
floating cranes/derricks. This proposed 
section includes many of the modern 
protective methods and mechanisms 
included in ASME B30.5–2004. 

This section also, in § 1926.1426(d), 
would specify the circumstances under 
which free fall of the load line would be 
prohibited. 

Paragraph 1426(a) Boom Free Fall 
Prohibitions 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(1), the 
use of equipment in which the boom is 
designed to free fall would be 
prohibited under six specified 
conditions. C–DAC concluded that, in 
these six circumstances, free fall of the 
boom needs to be prohibited regardless 
of what type of equipment is used and 
when that equipment was 
manufactured. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(i) would 

prohibit the use of a live boom when an 
employee is in the fall zone of the boom 
or load (see the explanation of ‘‘fall 
zone’’ in the discussion above of 
proposed § 1926.1425(b). Section 
1926.1425, Keeping clear of the load, of 
this proposed standard recognizes that 
there are some situations in which 
certain employees need to be positioned 
in the fall zone in order to perform their 
assigned duties. However, the 
likelihood that an employee would 
sustain a serious injury or be killed in 
the event of a falling boom is very high 
when an employee is in the fall zone of 
the boom or load. 

Because the likelihood of a falling 

boom is higher when a live boom is in 
use, C–DAC believed it was necessary to 
prohibit employees from being in the 
fall zone whenever a live boom is being 
used, without exception. Therefore, the 
exceptions listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1425 that would permit 
employees to be in the fall zone in 
certain circumstances apply only where 
a non-live boom is being used. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii) would 

prohibit use of a live boom when an 
employee is being hoisted. This 
continues the current prohibition in 
§ 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(F) of subpart N of this 
part, which is designed to prevent 
hoisted employees from being seriously 
injured or killed if the boom were to 
fall. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) would 
prohibit the use of a live boom where 
the load or boom is directly over a 
power line, or over any part of the area 
extending the Table A ( of proposed 
§ 1926.1408) clearance distance to each 
side of the power line. The diagram 
below illustrates a situation in which a 
load on a live boom is over the area 
extending the Table A clearance 
distance to each side of the power line: 

60 Proposed § 1926.1401 defines ‘‘tilt up or tilt 

down operation’’ as ‘‘raising/lowering a load from 
the horizontal to vertical or vertical to horizontal.’’

59807 

As discussed above in relation to 

proposed §§ 1926.1407 through 
1926.1411, equipment making electrical 
contact with power lines is one of the 
primary causes of equipment-related 
deaths on construction sites and, to 
prevent such contact, those sections 
would require equipment to maintain 
minimum distances from power lines. 
C–DAC recognized that a live boom 

that is over a power line, or that is 
suspending a load that is over any part 
of the area extending the Table A 
clearance distance to each side of the 
power line, could fall or cause the load 

to fall into electrical contact with a 
power line. 

The C–DAC draft of this provision 
stated: ‘‘The load or boom is directly 
over a power line, or over the area 
extending the Table A clearance 
distance to each side of the power line.’’ 
Since C–DAC’s intent was to prohibit 
the boom or load from being over any 
part of the area extending the Table A 
clearance distance to each side of the 
line, OSHA has changed this language 
to make clear that the prohibition 
applies with respect to the boom or load 
being above ‘‘any part of’’ that area. 

In reviewing this provision, OSHA 

realized that there appears to be another 
circumstance when a fall of the boom 
could cause the load or boom to breach 
the Table A clearance distance. This 
would occur as follows: Neither the 
boom nor load is over the power line or 
over the Table A clearance area. 
However, the Table A clearance 
distance is within the radius of vertical 
travel of the boom or load. This 
circumstance is depicted in the 
following illustrations:

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

In Illustration A, neither the boom nor 

the load is above the power line or any 
part of the Table A zone. However, if the 
boom were to fall, the boom would cross 
into the Table A zone. In Illustration B, 
neither the boom nor load is above the 
power line or any part of the Table A 
zone. However, if the boom were to fall, 
the load would cross into the Table A 
zone. 

The Agency therefore requests public 

comment on whether proposed 
§ 1926.1426(a)(1)(iii) should be 
modified to also prohibit the equipment 
from being positioned such that the fall 
path of the boom or load would breach 
the Table A clearance distance. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iv) would 
prohibit use of a live boom where the 
load is over a shaft. As discussed in 
relation to § 1926.1426(a)(1)(i) of this 
proposed section, C–DAC recognized 
that there are situations where 
employees must be in the fall zone of a 
suspended load. One particular scenario 
is when employees must receive a load 
that is lowered into a shaft. Such 
employees would be at a particularly 
high risk of being killed or injured by 
a free falling boom because the shaft 
severely limits or eliminates any ability 
to get out of the way. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(v) would 
prohibit free fall of a boom when the 
load is over a cofferdam, except where 
there are no employees 61 in the fall 
zone. Much like employees who must 
receive a suspended load in a shaft, 
employees have limited ability to escape 

61 The C–DAC draft of this provision used the 

term ‘‘workers;’’ this has been changed to 
‘‘employees,’’ which is the more appropriate term 
in light of the language in the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act.

a free falling boom or load in a 
cofferdam. However, because 
cofferdams are typically much larger 
work spaces than shafts, the fall zone of 
a falling boom or load may only affect 
one part of the cofferdam. Therefore, 
this provision contains an exception for 
situations where there are no employees 
in the fall zone. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(vi) would 

prohibit use of a live boom for lifting 
operations in a refinery or tank farm. 
C–DAC was concerned that a free falling 
boom could strike pipes or a tank in a 
refinery or tank farm. Such accidental 
impact could cause a release of toxic 
materials or conflagration. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2) is an 

exclusive list of conditions under which 
the use of cranes with live booms would 
be permitted. C–DAC believed that 
cranes with live booms could be used 
safely under some circumstances and 
did not believe that the cost of replacing 
or retrofitting all existing such 
equipment was justified as long as the 
use of live boom equipment was limited 
to those circumstances. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(i) would 

allow the use of equipment with a live 
boom if that equipment was 
manufactured prior to October 31, 1984 
and none of the circumstances listed in 
proposed § 1926.1426(a)(1) are present. 
C–DAC noted that ANSI B30.5 first 
prohibited live booms in its 1972 
version and reiterated the prohibition in 
the 1982 edition, which was published 
on October 31, 1983 and became 
effective on October 31, 1984. 

C–DAC concluded that manufacturers 

would have begun to phase out live- 
boom equipment when ANSI first 
prohibited its use in 1972 and that little, 

if any, live boom equipment would have 
been manufactured after October 31, 
1984. Moreover, during this period, 
hydraulic hoisting equipment, the 
design of which typically precluded 
boom free fall even in its early designs, 
became more prevalent. 

In light of these factors, C–DAC 

concluded that most equipment 
manufactured after October 31, 1984 
would not have live booms. Proposed 
§ 1926.1426(a)(2) thus allows the older 
live boom equipment to be phased out 
safely by restricting its use to situations 
in which none of the circumstances 
listed in § 1926.1426(a)(1) are present. 
Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(ii) would 

allow use of a live boom if the 
equipment is a floating crane/derrick or 
is a land crane/derrick on a vessel/ 
flotation device and none of the 
circumstances listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1426(a)(1) are present.62 C–DAC 
noted that equipment used on the water 
commonly has a live boom. This is 
because the dynamics of load transfer 
while on water (from side to side), as 
well as unexpected wave action, which 
can cause rapid changes in list and trim, 
sometimes necessitates that the operator 
have a free fall boom system to 
compensate for these effects. Non-live 
systems are not fast enough for this 
purpose. As a result, C–DAC concluded 
that there is no need to alter current 
industry practice in this regard as long 
as none of the circumstances listed in 
§ 1926.1426(a)(1) are present. 

62 OSHA has modified the language used in the 
C–DAC version of this provision to conform to the 
terminology used in proposed § 1926.1437, Floating 
cranes and land cranes on barges.

59809 

Paragraph (b) Preventing Boom Free 
Fall 

Proposed paragraph (b) sets criteria 
for preventing boom free fall. A boom 
that meets this criteria is considered to 
be designed to not free fall. The criteria 
consist of requirements for a secondary 
system for controlling the boom’s 
descent in addition to the equipment’s 
primary system. The Committee 
believed that the hazard posed by a 
failure of the primary system for holding 
or regulating the boom is so significant 
that the availability of a secondary 
mechanism needs to be required. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(1)(i) specifies 

that a friction drum must have both a 
friction clutch and a braking device, to 
allow for controlled boom lowering. 
These provisions are similar to those in 
section 5–1.3.2(a)(1) and (a)(4) of ANSI 
B30.5–1968 and ASME B30.5–2004. 
Proposed § 1926.1426(b)(1)(ii) would 
require friction drums to also have a 
secondary braking or locking device, 
which is manually or automatically 
engaged, to back-up the primary brake 
while the boom is held (such as a 
secondary friction brake or a ratchet and 
pawl device). In the view of the 
Committee these have been well 
established as effective for this purpose. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would 
require hydraulic drums to have an 
integrally mounted holding device or 
internal static brake to prevent boom 
hoist movement in the event of 
hydraulic failure. The requirements of 
this proposed paragraph are similar to 
those in section 5–1.3.1(d) of ASME 
B30.5–2004. The hazard presented by 
this type of hoisting system is that once 
the hydraulic system fails, the boom 
hoist drum could free spin and allow 
the boom to free fall. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(3) states that 

clutches or hydraulic motors do not 
qualify as brakes or locking devices for 
purposes of this subpart. C–DAC 
believed the use of clutches or hydraulic 
motors for such purposes would 
accelerate the wear of these systems and 
increase the risk they will fail when 
they are needed to control the lowering 
of the boom. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(4) would 
require hydraulic boom cylinders to 
have an integrally mounted holding 
device. An integrally mounted holding 
device would secure the boom from 
pivoting down in the event that 
hydraulic pressure is lost. This 
requirement is similar to section 
5–1.3.1(d) of ASME B30.5–2004. 
Paragraph 1426(c) Preventing 
Uncontrolled Retraction 

Proposed paragraph (c) would require 
hydraulic telescoping booms (which are 

also referred to as hydraulic extensible 
booms) to have an integrally mounted 
holding device to prevent the boom 
from retracting in the event of hydraulic 
failure. This proposed provision is 
similar to section 5–1.3.3(c) of ASME 
B30.5–2004. 

The C–DAC draft of this provision 
stated that the purpose of this device 
was ‘‘to prevent boom movement in the 
event of hydraulic failure.’’ OSHA 
believes that this language was 
unintentionally broad in that it refers to 
any ‘‘boom movement.’’ The purpose of 
proposed § 1926.1426(b)(4) is, as 
discussed above, to prevent the boom 
from pivoting down in the event of 
hydraulic failure. Therefore, there is no 
need for proposed § 1926.1426(c) to also 
require a device to prevent that type of 
boom movement. 

The Agency’s understanding is that 

the purpose of proposed § 1926.1426(c) 
is, as reflected in C–DAC’s heading 
(‘‘Preventing uncontrolled retraction’’), 
to prevent a telescoping hydraulic boom 
from retracting in the event of hydraulic 
failure. Therefore, OSHA has modified 
the language to state that the purpose of 
the integrally mounted holding device is 
‘‘to prevent the boom from retracting’’ in 
the event of hydraulic failure. OSHA 
requests public comment on the 
appropriateness of this change. 
Paragraph1426(d) Load Line Free Fall 

Proposed paragraph (d) lists 

circumstances under which free fall of 
the load line hoist is prohibited and 
controlled load lowering is required. 
‘‘Free fall (of the load line)’’ is defined 
in § 1926.1401 to mean ‘‘where only the 
brake is used to regulate the descent of 
the load line (the drive mechanism is 
not used to drive the load down faster 
or retard its lowering).’’ ‘‘Free fall’’ is 
contrasted with ‘‘controlled load 
lowering,’’ which § 1926.1401 defines as 
‘‘lowering a load by means of a 
mechanical hoist drum device that 
allows a hoisted load to be lowered with 
maximum control using the gear train or 
hydraulic components of the hoist 
mechanism. Controlled load lowering 
requires the use of the hoist drive motor, 
rather than the load hoist brake, to 
lower the load.’’ 

As with free fall of the boom, free fall 
of the load line hoist presents a struck- 
by hazard to employees. One difference 
with boom free fall, however, is that free 
fall of the load line endangers a smaller 
area. When a boom free falls, its tip (and 
any attached load) moves both 
downward and outward. Because the 
load will moving in at least two 
directions simultaneously, the area that 
will be affected by the fall is 
comparatively large. 

In contrast, if a load line free falls, the 

load will tend to fall in a relatively 
straight path downward (as long as the 
boom is not being moved and the load 
is not significantly affected by winds). 
Thus the area affected will typically be 
smaller. C–DAC therefore concluded 
that it would be appropriate to have a 
more limited prohibition compared with 
use of a live boom. This is reflected in 
the prohibition in proposed 
§ 1926.1426(d)(1) against an employee 
being directly under the load. That 
provision is more limited than proposed 
§ 1926.1426(a)(1)(i), which would 
prohibit an employee from being in the 
fall zone of the boom or load. 

Similarly, unlike the live boom 

provisions, proposed § 1926.1426(d) 
does not include a prohibition against 
use of load line hoist free fall in a 
refinery or tank farm. Because of the 
more limited affected area, the operator 
can more readily set up the equipment 
so that, in the event of a load line free 
fall, the affected area will not include 
safety critical refinery or tank 
equipment. 

However, paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and 

(4) are similar to the boom free fall 
prohibitions in that they prohibit free 
fall of the load line when (1) an 
employee is being hoisted; (2) the load 
is directly over a power line or over any 
part of the area extending the Table A 
(of proposed § 1926.1408) clearance 
distance to each side of the power line; 
and (3) the load is over a shaft or 
cofferdam. 

The C–DAC draft of proposed 

paragraph (d)(3) stated: ‘‘The load is 
directly over a power line, or over the 
area extending the Table A clearance 
distance to each side of the power line.’’ 
As discussed above, C–DAC’s intent was 
to prohibit the load from being over any 
part of the area extending the Table A 
clearance distance to each side of the 
line, and OSHA has therefore changed 
this language to make clear that the 
prohibition applies with respect to the 
load being above ‘‘any part of’’ that area. 

In reviewing proposed paragraph 

(d)(4), OSHA noted that it would 
prohibit load line free fall over a shaft 
or cofferdam, but contains no exception 
regarding cofferdams in which there is 
no employee in the fall zone. In this 
respect this provision is broader than 
the live boom provision in proposed 
§ 1926.1426(a)(1)(v), which does contain 
such an exception. OSHA requests 
public comment on whether proposed 
§ 1926.1426(d)(4) should be modified to 
include such an exception.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Section 1427 Operator Qualification 
and Certification 

Proposed § 1926.1427 addresses the 

safety concerns created by under- 
qualified crane operators. In the 
Committee’s experience, human error 
resulting from insufficient operator 
knowledge and capability is a 
significant cause of fatal crane/derrick 
accidents. It concluded that a verified 
testing process is essential for ensuring 
sufficient knowledge and capability of 
crane/derrick operators and would be an 
effective and efficient way to reduce 
these accidents. 

The Committee’s view was based on 
the extensive collective experience of 
the Committee members. Members 
expressed the belief that crane/derrick 
safety depends heavily on the operator 
having the knowledge and ability to 
implement safe operation practices. For 
example, an operator who does not 
know how to properly use load charts 
could miscalculate the capacity of the 
crane and inadvertently overload the 
equipment. An operator who lacks the 
knowledge and skill to control and 
manipulate a load could lose control of 
it, causing other employees to be struck 
by the load or the equipment. 

In addition, knowledge and skill are 

needed to prevent electrical contact 
with power lines (see the discussion 
above regarding proposed §§ 1926.1407– 
1926.1411). For example, an operator 
who does not understand an 
operational/performance characteristic 
such as dynamic loading may 
inadvertently allow the boom to get too 
close to a power line. This could occur 
where the operator failed to account for 
the fact that, under certain conditions, 
the boom would flex and so continue to 
move towards the line after the operator 
had stopped the superstructure’s 
rotation. 

Similarly, understanding and being 

able to minimize such effects is 
important in situations such as blind 
picks, where the operator will be relying 
on information relayed to him/her by a 
signal person. 

The Committee considered whether it 
would be sufficient to set testing criteria 
without a third-party (that is, 
independent) verification mechanism, 
and determined that such an approach 
was not likely to be effective in ensuring 
sufficient operator qualifications. 
During the Committee’s deliberations, 
members expressed a concern that 
testing conducted without a check on 
the quality of the test, with respect to 
both its content and administration, has 
been ineffective in ensuring that crane 
operators are qualified to operate the 
equipment safely. Members noted that 

operator ‘‘certification’’ cards are easily 
obtained from various Internet sites 
without having to pass a credible test. 
They also noted that the current OSHA 
standards, which require employers to 
instruct employees on the hazards 
involved with crane operation, and 
require the employer to permit only 
those employees qualified by training or 
experience to operate equipment,63 but 
do not require testing verified by a third 
party, have been generally ineffective in 
ensuring an adequate degree of 
consistency with respect to crane 
operator knowledge and ability. The 
Committee concluded that significant 
advances in crane/derrick safety would 
not be achieved unless such testing was 
required. 

The Committee was aware that testing 
of equipment operators by an impartial 
party has been used in the past to 
prevent fatal and other serious accidents 
that result when operators lack the 
knowledge and skills needed to operate 
safely. An example is the Department of 
Transportation’s requirements for over- 
the-road commercial drivers’ licenses 
(‘‘CDL’’). These are designed to reduce 
the incidence of serious accidents 
caused by unqualified drivers of 
vehicles such as trucks and buses. These 
requirements, codified at 40 CFR part 
383, require drivers of commercial 
motor vehicles to have state licenses 
that are issued in accordance with 
federal standards for qualification, 
training, and testing. To receive a 
license, the driver must pass knowledge 
and skills tests administered either by 
the state or by a third party whose 
examiners meet the same qualification 
and training standards as state 
examiners. 40 CFR 383.75(a). 

The Committee’s view of the 

importance of independent testing is 
further buttressed by a study conducted 
over a 34-year period (1969–2002), by 
the Construction Safety Association of 
Ontario. (OSHA–2007–0066–0009). The 
study showed a substantial decrease in 
crane and rigging fatalities in Ontario 
beginning in 1979, when mandatory 
training and certification requirements 
for Ontario crane operators went into 
effect. 

The Ontario system requires 

prospective or current crane operators 
(referred to in Ontario as ‘‘hoisting 
engineers’’) to either successfully 
complete an apprenticeship program or 
demonstrate sufficient previous 

63 Section 1926.20(b)(4) states that ‘‘the employer 

shall permit only those employees qualified by 
training or experience to operate equipment and 
machinery’’; § 1926.21(b)(2) states that ‘‘the 
employer shall instruct each employee in the 
recognition and avoidance of unsafe 
conditions.* * *’’

experience before seeking certification 
as a hoisting engineer. The 
apprenticeship program includes in- 
school training in a number of topics 
determined by the Ministry of 
Education, a practical examination 
administered at Ministry-designated 
sites, and a written examination 
administered by the Ministry. Upon 
passing this examination and proving 
completion of the requisite work hours, 
an apprentice receives a certificate of 
qualification as one of three types of 
hoisting engineer from the Ministry. 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0010). 

Hoisting engineers already qualified 

elsewhere must also obtain a 
certification from the Ministry to 
operate cranes in the province. These 
candidates must sit for the written 
examination and complete the practical 
skills assessment required for 
qualification of apprentices, but may 
demonstrate sufficient previous 
experience instead of completing the 
number of work/training hours required 
by the apprenticeship program, to 
receive a certificate of qualification from 
the Ministry in one of the three hoisting 
engineer categories. (OSHA–2007– 
0066–0011). 

In the ten year period from 1969 

through 1978, before Ontario’s 
requirements went into effect, 85 
Ontario construction workers suffered 
crane and rigging fatalities, amounting 
to 8.5 per year, or 19.8% of all 
construction fatalities in Ontario. In the 
24 year period from 1979 through 2002, 
there were 51 crane and rigging 
fatalities, or slightly more than two per 
year. For this period, crane and rigging 
fatalities equaled 9.6% of all Ontario 
construction fatalities. In the 12-year 
period from 1991 through 2002, the total 
number of crane and rigging fatalities 
was 9, or fewer than one per year. 
During this period, crane and rigging 
fatalities amounted to 4.1% of total 
construction fatalities. (OSHA–2007– 
0066–0009). 

Proposed § 1926.1427 would afford 

employers several options for ensuring 
that operators have obtained sufficient 
knowledge and ability. These options 
are designed to provide employers 
flexibility for meeting the proposed 
requirement and to accommodate the 
needs of the U.S. military. 
Paragraph 1427(a) 

As drafted by C–DAC, proposed 

paragraph (a) would have required the 
employer to ensure that the operator of 
any equipment covered under 
§ 1926.1400 is either qualified or 
certified to operate the equipment in 
accordance with the provisions of this 
section or is operating the equipment

during a training period. OSHA notes, 
however, that C–DAC provided for 
exceptions to the general rule for 
operator qualification/certification in 
proposed §§ 1436, Derricks; 1926.1440, 
Sideboom cranes; and 1926.1441, 
Equipment with a rated hoisting/lifting 
capacity of 2,000 pounds or less. To 
make proposed § 1926.1427(a) reflect 
the exceptions provided in these 
sections, OSHA has added the following 
language to proposed § 1926.1427(a): 

Exceptions: Operator qualification or 

certification under this section is not 
required for operators of derricks (see 
§ 1926.1436), sideboom cranes (see 
§ 1926.1440), and equipment with a rated 
hoisting/lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds or 
less (see § 1926.1441). 
Paragraph 1427(b) Option 1: 
Certification by an Accredited Crane/ 
Derrick Operator Testing Organization 

Proposed paragraph (b) sets out 
Option 1, in which the employee 
becomes certified to operate equipment 
of a certain type and capacity by passing 
an examination administered by an 
accredited testing organization. 
Certification under this option would be 
‘‘portable,’’ which means that any 
employer covered by the proposed 
standard could meet the requirements of 
proposed § 1926.1427 by using an 
operator who had this certification. 
These certifications would be valid for 
five years. 

Proposed section § 1926.1427(b) 

incorporates a number of safeguards to 
ensure that the Option 1 certification 
could be relied upon by any employer 
to meet the requirements of § 1926.1427, 
and adequately establishes the 
employee’s ability to operate the types 
and capacities of crane for which he/she 
is certified. The first of these safeguards 
is proposed § 1926.1427(b)(1)(i), which 
would require that the testing 
organization be accredited by a 
nationally recognized accrediting 
agency. 

As defined in § 1926.1401, a 

‘‘nationally recognized accrediting 
agency’’ is ‘‘an organization that, due to 
its independence and expertise, is 
widely recognized as competent to 
accredit testing organizations.’’ The 
Agency notes that, under this definition, 
new accrediting organizations would 
meet this definition upon establishing a 
national reputation based on 
independence, use of widely recognized 
criteria, and demonstrated competence 
in applying those criteria. 

For a testing organization to be 
accredited, the accrediting agency 
would have to determine that the testing 
organization meets industry recognized 
criteria for written testing materials, 

practical examinations, test 
administration, grading, facilities/ 
equipment and personnel. 

In its deliberations, the Committee 
expressed concern about the need for 
independent evaluation of certification 
programs. It believed such evaluation is 
necessary to ensure that the certification 
programs are adequately and 
consistently applying the requisite 
criteria for safe crane operation when 
testing operators. This accreditation 
would ensure that the testing 
procedures would accurately measure 
whether the operator has met the 
knowledge and skill criteria specified in 
proposed § 1926.1427(j) (discussed 
below). 

Under proposed § 1926.1427(b)(1)(v), 
the accreditation would be required to 
be reviewed every three years, to ensure 
continuing quality of testing materials 
and administration. The Committee 
believed that an entity that meets the 
proposed definition for a nationally 
recognized accrediting agency (‘‘an 
organization that, due to its 
independence and expertise, is widely 
recognized as competent to accredit 
testing organizations’’), would have both 
the expertise and independence needed 
to provide reliable assurance that a 
testing organization meets the proposed 
standard’s criteria. 

The use of a nationally recognized 

accrediting agency to provide an 
independent, authoritative assurance of 
a testing organization’s competence is a 
well-established practice. For example, 
for a number of years, the National 
Commission for Certifying Agencies 
(NCCA), the accreditation body of the 
National Organization for Competency 
Assurance (NOCA), has accredited 
testing organizations in a wide variety of 
fields, including those that provide 
crane operator certification. (OSHA– 
2007–0066–0021). Also, in 2003, the 
American National Standards Institute 
began accrediting personnel 
certification entities. (OSHA–2007– 
0066–0022). 

Another safeguard is in proposed 

§ 1926.1427(b)(1)(ii)(A), under which a 
testing organization would be required 
to administer both written and practical 
tests addressing the criteria set forth in 
proposed § 1926.1427(j). The Committee 
believed that operator ability cannot be 
assessed reliably unless both written 
and practical tests are used. In its view, 
operator ability depends both on 
knowledge of a variety of subjects, 
which the written test would address, 
and the ability to apply that knowledge, 
which would be addressed by the 
practical test. 

Proposed paragraph 1427(b)(1)(ii)(B) 

would require that different levels of 

certification be provided, based on 
varying equipment capacities and types. 
This proposed requirement is designed 
to ensure that the extent of knowledge 
and skill required is commensurate with 
the type and capacity of equipment the 
employee operates. For example, an 
employee who only operates a hydraulic 
truck crane would not need to also have 
the additional knowledge and skills 
necessary to operate a lattice boom 
crawler crane. Similarly, an employee 
who operates only a 22 ton capacity 
hydraulic truck crane would not need to 
also have the additional knowledge and 
skills necessary to operate a 300 ton 
hydraulic truck crane.64 

In its deliberations, the Committee 

determined that requiring the 
certification to be model-specific would 
be unnecessarily restrictive, and instead 
agreed on the term ‘‘type.’’ In the 
SBREFA Panel Report, the Panel 
recommended that OSHA solicit public 
comment on whether the term ‘‘type’’ is 
sufficiently clear for this purpose. 
OSHA requests public comment on 
whether this term is appropriate, 
whether it needs to be defined (and if 
so, what that definition should be),65 
and suggestions as to what other terms 
may be better. 

During the SBREFA process, several 
SERs described situations in which an 
operator is very knowledgeable and 
skillful with respect to one particular 
model of crane, but has very limited 
knowledge and ability regarding other 
models and types of cranes. These SERs 
were concerned that such operators 
would be unable to obtain a certification 
based on equipment capacity and type. 
They believe that, since these operators 
are well qualified to operate a particular 
crane model, there should be a 
mechanism for them to become certified 
to operate that model. The Panel 
recommended that OSHA consider and 
solicit public comment on expanding 
the levels of certification so as to allow 
an operator to be certified on a specific 
brand’s model of crane. Consistent with 
the Panel’s recommendation, OSHA 
seeks public comment on this issue. 
The SBREFA Panel also received 

comments from some SERs suggesting 
that the standard should accommodate 
crane operators who were fully capable 

64 Note that certification on a more complex and/ 

or higher capacity piece of equipment would 
typically qualify an operator to operate less 
complex/lower capacity equipment of the same 
type. For example, an operator certified for a 300 
ton hydraulic truck crane would not need a separate 
certification to operate a 22 ton hydraulic truck 
crane. 

65 One possible approach, referred to by the 

SBREFA Panel, would define ‘‘type’’ by using the 
categories of equipment represented in Figures 1– 
10 of the ASME B30.5–2004 standard.

of operating particular equipment in a 
limited set of circumstances but who 
would be unable to pass certification 
tests that required knowledge and 
abilities beyond those circumstances. 
The Panel recommended that OSHA 
consider and solicit public comment on 
expanding the levels of operator 
qualification/certification to allow such 
operators to be certified for a specific, 
limited type of circumstance defined by 
a set of parameters that, taken together, 
would describe an operation 
characterized by simplicity and 
relatively low risk. In response to the 
Panel’s recommendation, OSHA 
requests public comment on whether 
such parameters could be identified in 
a way that would result in a clear, easily 
understood provision that could be 
effectively enforced. 

Proposed paragraph 1427(b)(1)(iii) 

would require that the testing 
organization have procedures for 
operators to re-apply and be re-tested in 
the event an applicant fails a test. This 
would help ensure that if the employee 
initially failed to pass the test, the 
employee would be able to retake the 
test and still have the opportunity to 
obtain the certification. 

Proposed paragraph 1427(b)(1)(iii) 

would also require that the testing 
organization have procedures for 
operators to re-apply and be re-tested in 
the event an operator was decertified. 
This would similarly help protect an 
employer’s expenditures for training 
and certification testing. 

Proposed paragraph 1427(b)(1)(iv) 

would require that the testing 
organization have procedures for re- 
certifying operators designed to ensure 
that the operator continues to meet the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1427(j). The Committee believed 
that testing for recertification would not 
need to be as rigorous as for initial 
certification. This proposed provision 
was therefore included so that 
recertification procedures appropriate 
for those who have already been 
certified would be available. 

Under proposed paragraph (b)(2), the 

certification would be ‘‘portable,’’ 
which means that any employer of an 
operator certified under Option 1 would 
meet the requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1427 with respect to that 
operator.66 The Committee believed that 
accredited testing organizations could 
be relied upon to consistently adhere to 
the criteria in § 1926.1427, since they 
would be fully independent and their 
business interest would depend on their 

66 See the explanation of the proposed definition 
of ‘‘portable’’ below in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1427(m). 

continued accreditation. Therefore, it 
would be appropriate for all employers 
to be able to rely on their certifications. 
Under proposed § 1926.1427(b)(3), the 

certification would be valid for five 
years. The Committee believed that this 
is an appropriate length of time to 
assume that, absent a specific indication 
to the contrary, an employee would 
retain the knowledge and proficiency 
demonstrated through the testing 
process. 

In the SBREFA Panel Report, the 

Panel indicated that some Small Entity 
Representatives were concerned that 
there would be an insufficient number 
of accredited crane operator testing 
organizations and that many employers 
would not be able to set up and 
maintain an audited employer program 
under Option 2 (see discussion of 
Option 2 below). At present, there are 
two testing organizations that have been 
accredited by a nationally recognized 
accrediting organization to certify crane 
operators.67 

C–DAC considered this issue and was 
of the view that, with a four-year phase- 
in period, there would be sufficient time 
for the market to respond to an 
increased demand for certification 
services. Some SERs expressed a similar 
expectation. Nonetheless, the Panel 
recommended that OSHA solicit public 
comment on whether it would be 
appropriate to expand Option 1 so that 
an accredited educational institution 
could be used to ‘‘administer’’ tests. In 
other words, under this concept, Option 
1 would be expanded so that an 
accredited educational institution could 
administer written and practical tests 
that were developed or approved by an 
accredited crane/derrick testing 
organization. Many educational 
institutions currently have an 
accreditation through a national or 
regional accrediting agency that is listed 
by the U.S. Secretary of Education (SOE) 
or have an accreditation by a State 
agency that has been recognized by the 
SOE for approval of public post- 
secondary vocational education. Such 
an expansion could broaden the 
availability of certification services. 

C–DAC considered a related concept 
in which an educational institution or 
program accredited in this manner 
could both develop and administer 
tests. However, it rejected that concept 
because the SOE-related type of 

67 These organizations are the National 

Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators 
(NCCCO), which is accredited by the National 
Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0021) and by ANSI (OSHA– 
2007–0066–0025), and the Southern California 
Crane & Hoisting Certification Program (SCCHCP), 
which is accredited by NCCA. 

accreditation would be more broadly 
based on the institution as a whole, 
rather than on its operator certification 
program in particular. 

It is the Agency’s understanding that 

much of the Committee’s concern in this 
regard was related to the development 
of the tests rather than their 
administration. In other words, while 
considerable subject-specific expertise 
is needed to develop accurate and 
reliable crane operator tests, the 
expertise needed to administer such 
tests may be similar to the expertise 
needed to administer tests in general. 
However, there is a question as to 
whether this is equally true for written 
and practical tests. 

Therefore, OSHA solicits public 

comment on these issues. Specifically, 
the Agency seeks comment on whether 
Option 1 should be expanded so that an 
accredited educational institution could 
administer written and practical tests 
that were developed or approved by an 
accredited crane/derrick testing 
organization. 
Paragraph 1427(c) Option 2: 
Qualification by an Audited Employer 
Program 

Proposed paragraph (c) sets out 

Option 2, in which the employer would 
determine, through its own audited 
testing program, that its employee is 
qualified to operate the equipment. The 
Committee recognized that some 
employers, including those that have 
already established in-house testing 
programs, may want to do their own 
testing to meet the proposed 
§ 1926.1427 requirements. The 
Committee also recognized that, for 
there to be a significant improvement in 
the industry with respect to operator 
qualifications, it is essential that there 
be a mechanism to ensure that such 
testing is accurate and reliable. 
Therefore, under Option 2, the tests 
would be required to be either 
developed by an accredited crane 
operator testing organization, or 
approved by an auditor who is certified 
by an accredited crane operator testing 
organization. In addition, the 
administration of the tests would be 
audited. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1) sets forth 
the requirements that would apply to 
the contents and design of the tests 
(requirements for the administration of 
the tests is dealt with separately in 
proposed § 1926.1427(c)(2), discussed 
below) used in an audited employer 
program. To ensure that the tests meet 
the industry standards for written and 
practical examinations, they would have 
to be developed by an accredited testing 
organization (as described in proposed

§ 1926.1427(b)), or approved by an 
auditor in accordance with the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1427(c)(1)(ii). 

An employer choosing to use tests 

other than those developed by an 
accredited testing organization under 
proposed § 1926.1427(c)(1)(i) would be 
required to have the tests approved by 
an auditor in accordance with the 
criteria in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(c)(1)(ii). The auditor would 
have to be certified as a test evaluator 
by an accredited testing organization. To 
ensure that the auditor’s evaluation is 
independent and impartial, the auditor 
would be prohibited from being 
employed by the employer seeking 
evaluation of its qualification program. 
Also, the audit would need to determine 
that the program meets nationally 
recognized test development criteria 
and adequately assesses the criteria in 
proposed § 1926.1427(j). 

The Committee believed that these 
requirements are necessary to ensure 
that the contents and design of the tests 
meet the criteria in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(j) and generate valid and 
reliable results. 

The requirements for test 

administration that would apply under 
Option 2 of this section are set forth in 
proposed § 1926.1427(c)(2). Proposed 
§ 1926.1427(c)(2)(i) would require that 
the auditor find that the administration 
procedures meet nationally recognized 
test administration standards. The 
Committee believed that this proposed 
provision is needed to ensure that the 
test results would be valid and reliable. 
Under proposed paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) 

and (c)(2)(iii), the auditor would have to 
be certified by an accredited certifying 
organization as described in 
§ 1926.1427(b), and would be prohibited 
from being employed by the employer 
seeking the auditor’s approval for its 
operator qualification program. Finally, 
proposed paragraph 
§ 1926.1427(c)(2)(iv) would require that 
the audit be conducted in accordance 
with nationally recognized auditing 
standards. The Committee believed that, 
to avoid a conflict of interest and assure 
the integrity of the audit, it is necessary 
to have the auditor be independent of 
the employer and apply well recognized 
procedures for conducting the audit. 

The Agency notes that the proposed 

requirement that the audit be conducted 
in accordance with nationally 
recognized auditing standards would 
apply only to the audit of the 
administration of the tests, and not to 
the audit of the contents of the written 
and practical tests. It appears to the 
Agency that this was a drafting error, 
and that the Committee intended that

the entire audit be conducted in 
accordance with nationally recognized 
auditing standards. Therefore, the 
Agency solicits public comment on 
whether a new § 1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(D), 
reading as follows, should be added: 

(D) The audit shall be conducted in 
accordance with nationally recognized 
auditing standards. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3) addresses 
the need for an audit of an employer’s 
operator qualification program shortly 
after its inception, as well as 
periodically thereafter. This would 
ensure regular and independent 
oversight of employer-run qualification 
programs to verify that operators are 
being tested according to nationally 
recognized standards, on at least those 
qualifications set forth in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(j). 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4) would 

require an employer’s program to 
include re-qualification procedures, 
which would have to be audited as 
described in proposed § 1926.1427(c)(1) 
and (c)(2). The Committee believed that 
this is necessary to ensure the operators’ 
continued proficiency with, at a 
minimum, the criteria set forth in 
proposed § 1926.1427(j). 

In the event an auditor discovers a 
deficiency in an employer’s operator 
qualification program, the employer 
would have to meet the requirements set 
forth in proposed § 1926.1427(c)(5). 
Proposed § 1926.1427(c)(5)(i) requires 
that no additional operators be qualified 
until the auditor determines that the 
deficiency has been corrected. Under 
§ 1926.1427(c)(5)(ii), the program would 
also have to be re-audited within 180 
days of the deficiency’s correction to 
ensure that the minimum qualifications 
in proposed § 1926.1427(j) were being 
adequately and consistently tested. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(5)(iii) would 

require the auditor to file a report of any 
such deficiency with the appropriate 
OSHA Regional Office within 15 days of 
discovery. In addition, records of the 
employer’s qualification program audits 
would be required to be maintained by 
the auditor for three years and, under 
§ 1926.1427(c)(5)(iv), would have to be 
made available at the request of the 
Secretary of Labor or a designated 
representative. The Committee believed 
that these provisions are necessary to 
facilitate enforcement of the Option 2 
requirements. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(6)(i), a 
qualification by an employer’s operator 
qualification program (Option 2) of this 
section would not be portable. It was the 
Committee’s view that the degree of 
consistency in adhering to the proposed 
requirements of § 1926.1427 is likely to 

be highest among accredited crane 
operator testing organizations, since 
they would be fully independent and 
their business interest would depend on 
their continued accreditation. That view 
is reflected in full portability being 
restricted to certification under Option 
1 of this section. 

Under proposed paragraph (c)(6)(ii), a 
qualification by an employer’s operator 
qualification program would be valid for 
five years. The Committee believed that 
this is an appropriate length of time to 
assume that, absent a specific indication 
to the contrary, an employee would 
retain the knowledge and proficiency 
demonstrated through the testing 
process. 
Paragraph 1926.1427(d) Option 3: 
Qualification by the U.S. Military 

Proposed paragraph (d) provides that 
an operator would be deemed qualified 
if he/she had a current qualification 
issued by the United States military. 
Under proposed § 1926.1427(d)(2), such 
a qualification would be considered 
valid for the length of time stipulated by 
the United States military, and would 
not be portable. 

At the C–DAC meetings a 

representative of the United States Navy 
explained that, because of a variety of 
potential exigencies associated with the 
mission of the United States military, 
i.e., national defense, the military needs 
to be able to use its own qualification 
program, the criteria for which may 
have to vary based on the 
circumstances. Consequently, the 
criteria for qualification under Option 3 
would be left to the military to 
determine, including the length of time 
for which such a qualification would be 
valid. 

Proposed § 1926.1427(d) must be read 
in light of Executive Order (E.O.) 12196 
(Feb. 26, 1980) and 29 CFR Part 1960, 
which exclude military personnel 
(uniformed members of the Armed 
Forces) and uniquely military 
equipment, systems, and operations 
from OSHA coverage. Consequently, 
uniformed military personnel would not 
be covered by any of this proposed 
standard and there would be no 
obligation under this standard or E.O. 
12196 for uniformed military personnel 
operating cranes to be certified. Civilian 
employees of the Defense Department 
and Armed Forces engaged in work 
encompassed by ‘‘uniquely military 
equipment, systems and operations’’ 
similarly would not be covered by any 
of the provisions of this proposed 
standard, including the certification 
provisions. Therefore, even in the 
absence of Option 3, the Department of 
Defense is free to impose whatever

59814 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

qualifications it requires for crane 
operators who are military personnel or 
civilian employees engaged in such 
work. 

Under E.O. 12196, OSHA standards 

apply with respect to a civilian 
employee of the Department of Defense 
and Armed Forces who is engaged in 
work that falls beyond ‘‘uniquely 
military equipment, systems and 
operations.’’ Under that executive order, 
proposed § 1926.1427 would be 
applicable to those employees. 
Therefore, the U.S. military could use 
Option 3 by qualifying its own civilian 
employee operators engaged in work 
that falls beyond ‘‘uniquely military 
equipment, systems and operations.’’ 
In reviewing this part of the C–DAC 
consensus document, the Agency has 
determined that there is an ambiguity in 
the text of Option 3 in that it does not 
clearly indicate whether it would also 
cover employees of private contractors 
of the Armed Forces or Defense 
Department. With respect to such 
private contractor employees, E.O. 
12196 is inapplicable and OSHA has the 
authority to promulgate qualification/ 
certification requirements regarding 
them. 

The Agency believes that C–DAC’s 

intent was to have Option 3 be 
applicable only with respect to civilian 
employees of the U.S. military; it was 
not intended to include private 
contractor employees. This intent is 
reflected in C–DAC’s use of the term 
‘‘Not portable’’ in Option 3 and that 
term’s definition. Proposed 
§ 1926.1427(d)(2)(i) specifies that an 
operator’s U.S. military-issued 
qualification is not portable. Under the 
definition of that term in 
§ 1926.1427(m)(2), such a qualification 
is valid ‘‘only where the operator is 
employed by (and operating the 
equipment for) the employer that issued 
the qualification.’’ Since private 
contractor employees are not ‘‘employed 
by’’ the U.S. military, this indicates that 
Option 3 was not intended to apply to 
them. Instead, Option 3 was intended to 
apply only with respect to the U.S. 
military’s own employees. 

Accordingly, OSHA is planning on 

changing the regulatory language in 
proposed § 1926.1427(d) to more clearly 
reflect this intent. Specifically, the 
Agency is considering making the 
following changes to proposed 
§ 1926.1427(d)(1): 

(1) For purposes of this section, an operator 

who is an employee of the U.S. military is 
considered qualified if he/she has a current 
operator qualification issued by the U.S. 
military for operation of the equipment.

In addition, in proposed 

§ 1926.1427(m)(Definitions), the 
following definition would be added: 
(3) An ‘‘employee of the U.S. military’’ is 

a federal employee of the Department of 
Defense or Armed Forces and does not 
include employees of private contractors. 
OSHA requests public comment on 

this issue. 
Paragraph 1427(e) Option 4: Licensing 
by a Government Entity 

This option would allow a 

government licensing department/office 
to qualify crane operators. The 
Committee included this option because 
it believed that some States have 
effective, reliable licensing procedures, 
and that making use of them for 
purposes of proposed § 1926.1427 
would provide additional flexibility to 
employers. However, in the experience 
of Committee members, there is 
significant variability in criteria and 
administrative practices among 
government licensing entities. 
Therefore, under this option, the license 
could be used to meet the requirements 
of proposed § 1926.1427 only if the 
government entity meets the licensing 
criteria in proposed 1926.1427(e)(2). 
Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i) would 

require that the criteria used by the 
licensing department/office address the 
knowledge and skill requirements listed 
in proposed § 1926.1427(j). Proposed 
§ 1926.1427(e)(2)(ii) would require that 
the government entity follow the same 
test content, test administration and 
related criteria as required under Option 
1. Proposed § 1926.1427(e)(2)(iii) would 
require that the office with authority 
over the licensing department/office 
assess the tests and procedures used by 
the licensing office/department and 
determine that the requirements of 
proposed § 1926.1427(e)(2)(ii) and 
(e)(2)(iii) have been met. Also, the 
government licensing office would have 
to have re-certification procedures in 
place as discussed in proposed 
§§ 1926.1427(b)(1)(iv) and 
1926.1427(c)(4). The Committee 
believed that these provisions are 
necessary to ensure that the government 
licensing criteria and procedures yield 
valid and reliable results. 

Under proposed paragraph (e)(3)(i), 
this qualification would be valid only 
within the geographic jurisdiction of the 
licensing entity. For reasons of federal- 
local government comity, the Committee 
decided not to include a provision 
requiring the government entity to be 
accredited by a nationally recognized 
accrediting agency for purposes of 
Option 4. In the absence of such 
accreditation, there is an increased 

potential for variability in the degree to 
which the criteria in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(e)(2) will be met. 
Consequently, the Committee believed 
that, for purposes of meeting the 
requirements in proposed § 1926.1427, 
the validity of the qualification under 
Option 4 should not extend beyond the 
geographical jurisdiction of the 
government entity. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(3)(ii) provides 
that the licensing entity may determine 
the time period for which the 
qualification is valid, but cannot issue a 
qualification intended to be valid for 
more than five years. The five year 
maximum was included in the 
provision because the Committee 
believed that this is an appropriate 
length of time to assume that, absent a 
specific indication to the contrary, an 
employee would retain the knowledge 
and proficiency demonstrated through 
the testing process. 
Paragraph 1427(f) Pre-Qualification/ 
Certification Training Period 

This proposed paragraph addresses 

the requirements that would have to be 
met for a trainee to operate a crane on 
the job while preparing for 
qualification/certification assessment. 
Proposed § 1926.1427(f)(1) would allow 
for the operation of cranes by employees 
who are not qualified or certified, 
provided that they meet the 
requirements in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2). Proposed 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2) would allow those 
undergoing training in preparation for 
qualification/certification tests to 
operate equipment under the conditions 
outlined in § 1926.1427(f)(2)(i) through 
(f)(2)(v). The Committee believed that it 
is necessary for there to be a process by 
which operators who are not certified or 
qualified can get experience working 
with the equipment to help prepare for 
obtaining a certification/qualification. 
This proposed paragraph would require 
appropriate oversight of such trainees to 
ensure worksite safety. 

In the C–DAC consensus document, 

§ 1926.1427(f)(2) states that, 

An employee who has passed neither the 

written nor practical tests required under this 
section is permitted to operate equipment as 
part of his/her training where the following 
requirements are met. * * * 

It is the Agency’s understanding that 

the intent of the Committee was to allow 
trainees who had not yet obtained a 
certification or qualification to operate 
equipment on the job as part of the 
training process as long as the criteria in 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2) were met. However, 
the C–DAC language would allow such 
an operator to do this only if the

operator had passed not yet passed both 
the written and practical tests. 

The anomalous result of that language 

would have been that an operator who 
had passed one of those tests but not 
both would have been prohibited from 
operating the crane as a trainee under 
this provision. Since that would have 
been contrary to the Committee’s intent, 
the Agency has modified that language 
for the proposed rule, which now reads: 
An employee who has not passed both the 

written and practical tests required under 
this section is permitted to operate 
equipment as part of his/her training where 
the following requirements are met. * * * 
Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(i) would 
require that the trainee/apprentice be 
provided with sufficient training prior 
to operating the equipment to enable 
him/her to operate it safely under the 
limitations listed in this proposed 
section and any additional limitations 
established by the employer. This 
would ensure that, before beginning to 
operate the equipment at the site, the 
trainee/apprentice would have attained 
sufficient knowledge and skills to 
operate the equipment safely as a 
trainee/apprentice. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(ii) would 

restrict the trainee/apprentice’s 
operation of the equipment to those 
tasks currently within his/her ability. 
The Committee believed that this is 
necessary to ensure that, throughout the 
training period, the tasks the trainee/ 
apprentice performs are always 
commensurate with his/her ability. This 
provision would also allow the trainee/ 
apprentice to perform progressively 
more complex tasks as the trainee/ 
apprentice develops the necessary 
ability. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(iii) sets 

forth the requirements that an employee 
would have to meet to be permitted to 
supervise the trainee/apprentice’s 
operation of the crane. The Committee 
believed that setting the criteria for such 
supervision is necessary to ensure that 
the equipment is operated safely during 
the training/apprenticeship period. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(f)(2)(iii)(A), the trainee/apprentice’s 
supervisor would have to be an 
employee or agent of the trainee’s/ 
apprentice’s employer. The Committee 
believed that this is necessary to ensure 
that the supervisor would have the 
authority to direct the actions of the 
trainee/apprentice. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B) 

would require that the trainee/ 
apprentice’s supervisor be either a 
certified operator (in accordance with 
proposed § 1926.1427), or have passed 
the written portion of a certification test 

under one of the Options in proposed 
§ 1926.1427. In addition, whether the 
supervisor is a certified operator or has 
passed the written test, the supervisor 
would have to be familiar with the 
proper use of the equipment’s controls. 

The SBREFA panel recommended 

that OSHA consider whether the 
trainee/apprentice’s supervisor should 
have additional training beyond the 
qualifications required under proposed 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2)(iii)(B). This 
recommendation is addressed below in 
the discussion of § 1926.1430, Training. 

The Committee believed that this 

provision is necessary to ensure that the 
supervisor has sufficient knowledge 
about the equipment to enable him/her 
to effectively oversee the safe operation 
of the crane. The Committee determined 
that a supervisor who had passed the 
written portion of a certification test 
would not need to be sufficiently 
proficient to pass the practical portion 
in order to effectively supervise a 
trainee/apprentice. However, both in the 
instance where the supervisor is 
certified and in the instance where he/ 
she is not certified but has passed the 
written portion of the certification test, 
the Committee believed that it is 
necessary that he/she be familiar with 
the proper use of the equipment’s 
controls, since such knowledge is 
essential to being able to effectively 
supervise a trainee/apprentice. 

The C–DAC consensus document 

language refers to ‘‘certified operator’’ 
and the written portion of a 
‘‘certification’’ test. However, under 
proposed § 1926.1427, an operator may 
be either ‘‘certified,’’ which would be 
obtained under Option 1, or ‘‘qualified,’’ 
which would be obtained under any one 
of the other options. The Agency 
believes that the Committee intended 
that as long as the supervisor meets the 
qualification/certification criteria under 
any of these options, or has passed the 
written portion of a test used to obtain 
a qualification/certification under any of 
these options, and all other aspects of 
proposed § 1926.1427(f)(2)(iii) have 
been met, the employer should be 
permitted to use that supervisor to 
supervise the trainee/apprentice. 

In addition, the C–DAC consensus 

document language regarding this 
provision states that a supervisor who is 
a ‘‘certified operator’’ may, if the other 
criteria listed in the provision are met, 
supervise the trainee/apprentice. 
Alternatively, the supervisor must have 
‘‘passed the written portion of a 
certification test * * *.’’ The Agency 
believes that it was the Committee’s 
intent that the certification or written 
test that was passed be valid for the 
equipment that the trainee/apprentice is 

operating. However, the C–DAC 
language, read literally, would permit a 
supervisor with a certification or 
passing score on a written test that was 
valid only for equipment other than 
what the trainee/apprentice was 
operating to supervise that trainee/ 
apprentice. 

To conform proposed paragraph 

(f)(2)(iii)(B) to C–DAC’s intent, OSHA is 
planning to modify that provision as 
follows and requests public comment on 
this change. 

(B) The operator’s supervisor is either a 

qualified/certified operator under this section 
for the equipment the trainee/apprentice is 
operating, or has passed the written portion 
of a qualification/certification test for such 
equipment under one of the Options in 
paragraphs (b) through (e), and is familiar 
with the proper use of the equipment’s 
controls. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(C) 
would require that the operator’s 
supervisor perform no tasks that would 
detract from his/her ability to supervise 
the trainee/apprentice. The Committee 
believed that permitting the operator’s 
supervisor to engage in tasks that would 
impinge on his/her ability to supervise 
the trainee/apprentice would endanger 
the trainee/apprentice and other 
employees in the vicinity of the crane. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(f)(2)(iii)(D), for equipment other than 
tower cranes, the operator’s supervisor 
and the trainee/apprentice would be 
required to be in direct line of sight of 
each other, and would be required to 
communicate either verbally or by hand 
signals. The Committee believed that 
this would ensure that the operator’s 
supervisor could rapidly and effectively 
give instructions to the trainee/ 
apprentice, especially for purposes of 
correcting the trainee/apprentice. 

With respect to tower cranes, it was 

the Committee’s view that the height of 
the operator’s station would typically 
make it infeasible to maintain direct line 
of sight between the operator’s 
supervisor and the trainee/apprentice. 
For the same reason, use of hand signals 
is also often not feasible. Therefore, the 
proposed provision would instead 
require that they be in direct 
communication with each other. For 
example, direct communication could 
be achieved by radio or other instant 
electronic voice communication system. 
The Committee believed that it would 

be infeasible for the operator’s 
supervisor to supervise the trainee/ 
apprentice 100 percent of the time. 
Proposed § 1926.1427(f)(2)(iv) is 
designed to set criteria that would 
permit the trainee/apprentice to 
continue operating the crane in the 
absence of the operator’s supervisor for

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

short breaks under circumstances that 
would result in safe operation. Those 
criteria would be as follows: 
Under proposed paragraph 

(f)(2)(iv)(A), the break would be 
restricted to no more than 15 minutes, 
and no more than one break per hour. 
The Committee believed that this 
restriction is needed because otherwise 
there would be a significant likelihood 
that the other criteria (discussed below) 
would not be followed, and that the 
trainee/apprentice would not receive 
the amount of supervision that is 
needed to ensure safe operation. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(f)(2)(iv)(B), immediately prior to the 
break, the operator’s supervisor would 
have to inform the trainee/apprentice of 
the specific tasks that the trainee/ 
apprentice would be authorized to 
perform and the limitations that he/she 
must adhere to during the break. Under 
proposed § 1926.1427(f)(2)(iv)(C), the 
specific tasks that the trainee/apprentice 
would perform during the break would 
have to be within the trainee/ 
apprentice’s ability. The Committee 
believed that these provisions are 
necessary to prevent injuries and 
fatalities that could be caused by a 
trainee/apprentice operating a crane 
under circumstances that are beyond 
his/her ability. 

The Committee believed that there are 

certain circumstances in which it is 
inappropriate for a trainee/apprentice to 
operate a crane because of the 
complexity and/or heightened risks 
involved. Therefore, for the 
circumstances listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2)(v)(A)–(D), the trainee/ 
apprentice would be prohibited from 
operating the equipment in all cases, 
even if the operator’s supervisor 
believed the trainee/apprentice had 
attained the necessary knowledge and 
skill. 

With respect to operations involving 

multiple-lift rigging, the Committee 
believed that the difficulty and/or risk 
involved is not at the same level as 
those listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2)(v)(A)–(D). 
Consequently, as reflected in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2)(v)(E), while there 
would be a general prohibition against 
a trainee/apprentice operating the 
equipment when multiple-lift rigging is 
involved, an exception would apply 
where the operator’s supervisor 
determined that the trainee/apprentice’s 
skills are sufficient for this high-skill 
work. 
Paragraph 1427(g) 

Proposed paragraph (g) would permit 

a testing entity to provide training as 
well as testing services as long as the 

criteria of the applicable accrediting 
agency (in the Option selected) for an 
organization providing both services are 
met. The Committee was aware of an 
impression among some people in the 
industry that a testing entity could not 
get accredited if it also provided 
training. However, after some research, 
the Committee determined that this was 
not a bar to accreditation if certain 
procedures were instituted. Specifically, 
an industry consensus standard, the 
International Organization for 
Standardization (‘‘ISO’’) 17024, 
addresses entities that offer 
certifications to individuals. It requires 
that no such entity offer training unless 
the entity can demonstrate that the 
training is independent of both 
evaluation and certification. This is 
intended to preserve both 
confidentiality and impartiality in the 
testing/certification process. 

Therefore, at least with respect to 

those accrediting agencies that apply the 
ISO standard, a testing entity may also 
conduct training as long as an adequate 
‘‘firewall’’ exists between the two 
functions. Proposed § 1926.1427(g) 
reflects the Committee’s intent to make 
clear that a testing entity is not be 
prohibited from providing training, as 
long as the applicable criteria have been 
met. 
Paragraph 1427(h) 

The Committee deliberated about the 
need for operators to be able to read to 
operate a crane safely and how some 
operators, even though they can read, 
nonetheless have difficulty taking 
written tests. The Committee believed 
that it is crucial for operators to be able 
to read the load chart and other 
manufacturer procedures for the 
equipment they operate. In its view, the 
failure to be able to read that 
information could result in injuries and 
fatalities through a wide variety of 
errors (for example, by overloading the 
crane as a result of exceeding the crane’s 
working radius, failing to deploy 
outriggers in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions, or failing to 
apply a footnote in a load chart that 
explains that the capacity is lower when 
a particular configuration of the crane is 
used). 

However, the Committee recognized 
that some employees, while they have 
sufficient literacy to be able to read this 
type of material, for other reasons are 
unable to take written tests effectively. 
Therefore, under proposed 
§ 1926.1427(h), the written 
qualification/certification test could be 
administered verbally, with the answers 
given verbally, if two prerequisites are 
met.

The first is that the qualification/ 

certification candidate pass a written 
demonstration of literacy relevant to the 
work (proposed § 1926.1427(h)(1)). The 
second is that the candidate 
demonstrate the ability to use the type 
of written manufacturer procedures 
applicable to the class/type of 
equipment for which the candidate is 
seeking qualification/certification 
(proposed § 1926.1427(h)(2)). These 
would typically include, for example, 
the load chart and operator’s manual for 
the crane the candidate would be 
operating. 

As reflected in the SBREFA Panel 

Report, some SERs expressed a concern 
that operators who are not proficient in 
English would not be able to meet either 
requirement. The Panel recommended 
that OSHA solicit comment on whether 
employers should be permitted to use 
manuals that have been re-written to 
accommodate the level of English 
proficiency (that is, lower level or lack 
of proficiency) of the operator. 

C–DAC considered this same concern 
in designing § 1926.1427(h). Neither the 
demonstration in § 1926.1427(h)(1) nor 
(h)(2) would necessarily have to be 
made in English as those provisions are 
currently drafted. As an example, under 
these proposed provisions, an employer 
could obtain a Spanish-language version 
of the load charts and operator’s manual 
from the manufacturer, and arrange to 
have the literacy test administered in 
Spanish. An operator able to meet the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1427(h) using these Spanish 
language materials would have 
demonstrated adequate literacy under 
the proposed rule. 

However, it may be necessary to 

modify proposed § 1926.1427(b)(1), (c) 
and (e) so that, in such instances, the 
qualification/certification is limited to 
the use of equipment that is equipped 
with such translated materials. In 
addition, there is an issue with respect 
to whether the rule needs to incorporate 
safeguards to ensure that a translation of 
manufacturer-supplied materials 
conveys the same information as in the 
original. OSHA requests comment on 
these issues. 

Some SERs also expressed a concern 
that many operators are not sufficiently 
literate in any language to meet the 
proposed requirements in 
§ 1926.1427(h)(1) and (h)(2). As 
discussed above, C–DAC determined 
that it is essential for ensuring safe 
crane operation that operators have 
sufficient literacy to read and 
comprehend written materials that 
relate to critical aspects of operation, 
such as load charts and manufacturer’s 
manuals. However, the Panel

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59817 

recommended that OSHA solicit 
comment on whether employers should 
be permitted to use manuals that have 
been re-written to accommodate the 
literacy level of operators. 

The concept underlying this 

recommendation is that a lower level of 
literacy may be sufficient as long as that 
level still enables the operator to read 
and understand the simplified language 
(and perhaps greater use of illustrations) 
in the re-written manual. If this were to 
be allowed, it would be necessary to 
modify proposed § 1926.1427(b)(1), (c) 
and (e) so that the certification is 
limited to the use of equipment that is 
equipped with a suitably re-written 
manual. Another issue that such a 
change would raise is whether the rule 
would need to incorporate safeguards to 
ensure that the modified materials 
conveyed the same information as in the 
original, manufacturer-supplied 
materials. OSHA requests comment on 
the Panel’s recommendation and these 
related issues. 
Paragraph 1427(i)

[Reserved.] 

Proposed paragraph (i) would be 

reserved because it is inconvenient for 
readers to determine whether ‘‘i’’ is 
being used as a letter or a roman 
numeral. 
Paragraph 1427(j) Certification Criteria 

Proposed paragraph (j) sets out the 
qualification and certification criteria 
applicable to the options described in 
proposed §§ 1926.1427(b)(1)(ii)(A), 
1926.1427(c)(1)(ii)(C), and 
1926.1427(e)(2)(iv). The Committee 
determined that these are the criteria 
needed to address the knowledge and 
skills that are fundamental to safe crane 
operation. As stated in the introductory 
language in proposed § 1926.1427(j), 
these would constitute ‘‘minimum’’ 
criteria; the accredited certifying 
entities, employers, or local or state 
licensing offices would not be 
precluded from adding additional 
requirements to their certification or 
qualification programs. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1) describes 

the criteria that would have to be 
covered by the written examination 
portion of a qualification/certification 
program. As stated above in the 
discussion of examination 
administration, the written portion of 
the examination may be administered 
orally, so long as the candidate has 
demonstrated sufficient literacy relevant 
to the work (e.g., load charts and 
equipment manual). 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i) states that 

the individual seeking qualification or 
certification must know ‘‘the 
information necessary for safe operation

of the specific type of equipment the 
individual will operate * * *’’ As 
discussed above with respect to 
proposed § 1926.1427(b)(1)(ii)(B) 
(requirement that different levels of 
certification be provided, based on 
varying equipment capacities and 
types), during the SBREFA process, 
several SERs described situations in 
which an operator is very 
knowledgeable and skillful with respect 
to one particular model of crane, but has 
very limited knowledge and ability 
regarding other models and types of 
cranes. These SERs were concerned that 
such operators would be unable to 
obtain a certification based on 
equipment capacity and type. They 
believe that, since these operators are 
well qualified to operate a particular 
crane model, there should be a 
mechanism for them to become certified 
to operate that model. The Panel 
recommended that OSHA consider and 
solicit public comment on expanding 
the levels of certification so as to allow 
an operator to be certified on a specific 
brand’s model of crane. Consistent with 
the Panel’s recommendation, OSHA 
seeks public comment on this issue. 

Also, as discussed above with respect 
to proposed § 1926.1427(b)(1)(ii)(B), the 
SBREFA Panel received comments from 
some SERs suggesting that the standard 
should accommodate crane operators 
who were fully capable of operating 
particular equipment in a limited set of 
circumstances but who would be unable 
to pass certification tests that required 
knowledge and abilities beyond those 
circumstances. The Panel recommended 
that OSHA consider and solicit public 
comment on expanding the levels of 
operator qualification/certification to 
allow such operators to be certified for 
a specific, limited type of circumstance 
defined by a set of parameters that, 
taken together, would describe an 
operation characterized by simplicity 
and relatively low risk. In response to 
the Panel’s recommendation, OSHA 
requests public comment on whether 
such parameters could be identified in 
a way that would result in a clear, easily 
understood provision that could be 
effectively enforced.68 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(A) would 

require that the written examination 
address the candidate’s knowledge of 
the equipment controls and operational/ 
performance characteristics of the 
specific type of equipment. Operational/ 

68 The SBREFA Panel also recommended that 
OSHA ask for public comment on whether the 
standard should state more clearly that more 
limited training is required for operators of smaller 
capacity equipment than for more complex 
equipment. This recommendation is addressed 
below in the discussion of § 1926.1430, Training. 

performance characteristics would 
include, for example, the deflection 
characteristics of the boom, including 
how deflection affects the positioning of 
the load and the extent to which 
deflection varies with boom angle and 
length as well as load weight. Also, 
equipment with lattice/cable supported 
booms has different deflection 
characteristics than equipment with 
non-lattice booms (that is, hydraulic 
ram supported booms). Meeting these 
criteria would ensure that the person 
controlling the equipment would be 
able to make necessary judgments and 
adjustments for safe crane operation. 
Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(B) was 

included to ensure that operators would 
be able to use load capacity information 
on a variety of configurations of the 
capacity and type of equipment. Such 
information is typically contained in 
load charts and manuals. This would 
ensure that the operator would be able 
to accurately determine, independently, 
the capacity of the equipment in each 
situation that he/she might encounter. 
The Committee believed that this ability 
is critical to helping prevent injuries 
and fatalities caused by overloading the 
equipment. 

The Committee considered whether it 

is also necessary for the operator to be 
able to use the load information without 
the aid of a calculator. It determined 
that calculators are now so commonly 
available and used that it is not 
necessary for the operator to be able to 
use the load information without one. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(C) 

addresses the need for crane operators 
to know how to prevent power line 
contact. In the Committee’s experience, 
electrocutions and electrical injuries are 
typically caused when the operator 
unintentionally brings the boom, load 
line or load in electrical contact with a 
power line. Operator knowledge of the 
procedures that are necessary for 
preventing such contact (see the 
discussions of proposed §§ 1926.1407 
through 1926.1411 above) is essential 
for preventing these injuries and 
fatalities. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(C) also 
addresses the need for crane operators 
to know how to respond to a power line 
contact if one occurs. For example, the 
Committee determined that some 
electrocutions of operators occur while 
an operator attempts to exit the 
equipment. After realizing that the 
equipment is in electrical contact with 
a power line, the operator is 
electrocuted when he/she creates a 
grounding path by touching the

equipment while stepping on the 
ground.69 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(D) 

addresses the need for crane operators 
to have technical knowledge on a range 
of subjects that, if not sufficiently 
understood, could cause injuries and 
fatalities. The list of subjects in 
proposed Non-Mandatory Appendix E 
of this subpart serves as an example of 
that set of knowledge. The Committee 
believed that a degree of flexibility 
should be accorded in terms of what 
specific subjects need to be included. 
For example, a subject relevant only to 
an extensible boom crane would not 
need to be covered for a certification for 
a traditional lattice boom crane. 
Therefore, the proposed provision states 
that the testing criteria must include 
technical knowledge ‘‘similar’’ to the 
subject matter criteria listed in 
Appendix E of this subpart. To 
accommodate those who have less of a 
need for such flexibility and more of a 
need for specificity in this regard, the 
proposed provision also makes clear 
that, when the subjects listed in 
Appendix E are used, the requirements 
of the provision would be met. 

In addition to the technical 

knowledge that would be required 
under proposed § 1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(D), 
technical knowledge applicable to three 
specific subjects would also be required 
under proposed § 1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(E). 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(E)(1) 

would require that an operator be able 
to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of 
how to assess ground conditions to 
identify potential hazards. The operator 
would therefore be able to assess ground 
conditions through inspection, and 
would also be aware of the potential for 
unseen hazards such as sewers, water 
mains, and other underground 
installations or conditions that might 
affect the ability of the ground to 
support the equipment and expected 
load. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(E)(2) 

would require operators to demonstrate 
sufficient knowledge of site hazards so 
that the operator would be able to 
identify them and understand their 
significance to safe operation of the 
equipment. Examples of typical site 
hazards include electrical hazards posed 

69 Note that, as provided in proposed 

§ 1926.1408(g)(1)(i)(A) on power line safety, 
operators must be aware of the danger of 
electrocution if they simultaneously touch 
energized equipment and the ground. They must 
also, pursuant to proposed § 1926.1408(g)(1)(i)(B), 
be trained to understand that when the equipment 
makes electrical contact with a power line, the 
operator’s safety requires him or her to remain 
inside the cab except where there is an imminent 
danger of fire, explosion, or other emergency that 
necessitates their leaving the cab.

by underground electrical or cable lines 
and aboveground telephone poles and 
power lines, and ground-support 
hazards posed by manholes, drains and 
trenches, which can lead to tip-overs. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(E)(3) 

would require operators to demonstrate 
sufficient technical knowledge to ensure 
that conditions at the entrance to the 
site are sufficient to enable the 
equipment to travel safely onto the site. 
For example, where equipment must 
descend or ascend a dirt ramp, the 
operator needs to be able to assess the 
effect of the ramp’s steepness and to 
detect signs of instability. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(i)(F) would 

require operators to demonstrate a 
thorough knowledge of this subpart, 
including incorporated materials. The 
Committee believed that operators play 
a key role in the application of these 
requirements and it is therefore 
essential that they understand them. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(1)(ii) is 

intended to ensure that operators have 
the ability, at a minimum, to 
demonstrate sufficient literacy to locate 
and understand information both in the 
equipment manual as well as in other 
sources which address the information 
discussed in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(j)(1)(i)(A) through 
(j)(1)(i)(F). Since the Committee 
determined that safe crane operation 
depends on applying that information, 
the operator needs to be able to locate 
and understand it. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(2) would 

require a practical test and sets criteria 
for such a test. Safe crane operation 
depends on an operator having 
sufficient skill to operate the equipment 
safely. The Committee felt that a 
successful demonstration of ability to 
perform the operations discussed below 
is essential to ensuring that the operator 
will be able to apply the requisite 
knowledge in the field. The practical 
test under this proposed paragraph 
would be conducted using equipment of 
the capacity and type for which the 
candidate seeks certification. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(2)(i) would 

require an operator to demonstrate the 
ability to recognize, from visual and 
audible observation, the items listed in 
proposed paragraph § 1926.1412(d)(shift 
inspection). Irrespective of whether the 
operator or someone else conducts the 
shift inspection, the operator needs to 
be able to recognize apparent 
deficiencies associated with these parts 
and mechanisms. First, the operator 
needs to be able to identify indications 
of safety problems that may arise after 
the shift inspection has been completed. 
In addition, this ability is important 
since the operator needs to be able to 

effectively exercise his/her authority 
under proposed § 1926.1418, Authority 
to stop operation to stop lifting 
operations (see discussion of that 
proposed section above). 

Proposed paragraph (j)(2)(ii) addresses 

the need for operators to have 
demonstrated proficiency with 
operational and maneuvering skills. 
Lack of such proficiency could result in 
a wide range of accidents that could 
cause injuries or fatalities. For example, 
without this level of skill, the operator 
could unintentionally exceed the 
crane’s capacity (such as by booming 
out too far) and overturn the equipment, 
make electrical contact with power 
lines, or cause struck-by injuries and 
fatalities (such as by losing a load or 
losing control of the load). 

Proposed paragraph (j)(2)(iii) requires 
that the operator demonstrate the ability 
to apply load chart information. The 
Committee believed that if an operator 
is unable to apply load chart 
information, there is a significantly 
heightened risk of the crane 
overturning. This is because an operator 
without this ability may fail to keep the 
crane within the required operational 
parameters called for by the load chart 
(for example, by failing to recognize that 
proceeding with the lift will result in 
exceeding the maximum allowable 
boom radius as specified in the load 
chart). 

As with proposed paragraph (j)(2)(i) 
(ability to recognize inspection items), 
this ability is also important since the 
operator needs to be able to effectively 
exercise his/her authority under 
proposed § 1926.1418 (Authority to stop 
operation) to stop lifting operations (see 
discussion of that proposed section 
above). For example, if the only way to 
land the load with the crane in its 
current position would be to exceed the 
allowable radius specified in the chart, 
the operator would need to be able to 
recognize that this would happen and 
stop the lift. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(2)(iv) would 
require that an operator be able to shut 
down and secure equipment safely. This 
ability is necessary to ensure that the 
shut down procedure is done safely and 
the equipment is properly secured to 
prevent unintended movement of the 
equipment after shut down. 
Paragraph 1427(k) Phase-In 

Under proposed paragraph (k), the 

qualification/certification requirements 
in proposed § 1926.1427 would not 
become effective until four years after 
the effective date of the final rule. The 
Committee believed that this four year 
period would provide time for operators 
to get additional training (where

needed) to prepare them for the testing, 
for additional testing organizations to 
become accredited for purposes of 
Option 1 (proposed § 1926.1427(b)), for 
additional organizations to become 
nationally recognized accrediting 
agencies, for employers (who so choose) 
to develop audited programs for use 
under Option 2 (proposed 
§ 1926.1427(c)), for accredited testing 
organizations to develop programs to 
certify auditors as described under 
Option 2, and for state and local 
government entities (who so choose) to 
make preparations to meet the criteria 
under Option 4 (proposed 
§ 1926.1427(e)). It would also give 
employers time to plan which of the 
qualification/certification options 
would be most suitable for them. 

Under proposed paragraph (k)(1), 

during this four year period, proposed 
paragraphs § 1926.1427(k)(1)(i) and (ii) 
would address operator qualifications 
and training. Specifically, proposed 
§ 1926.1427(k)(1)(i) would require that 
operators be competent for the purposes 
of operating the equipment safely. This 
would require that the operator have the 
requisite knowledge and skill to 
identify, anticipate, and avoid actions 
which could result in hazardous 
conditions related to the equipment and 
job site. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(1)(ii) would 

require employers to ensure that 
operators who do not already have 
sufficient knowledge or skill to operate 
the equipment safely undergo training 
prior to engaging in operations. In 
addition, the employer would be 
required to ensure that the operator is 
evaluated to confirm that he/she 
understands the information provided 
in the training. These interim measures 
are not significantly different from 
current requirements under Subpart N 
of this part, § 1926.20(b)(4) (‘‘the 
employer shall permit only those 
employees qualified by training or 
experience to operate equipment and 
machinery’’) and § 1926.21(b)(2) (‘‘the 
employer shall instruct each employee 
in the recognition and avoidance of 
unsafe conditions * * * ’’). However, 
they would ensure that there would not 
be a gap with respect to this issue 
between the termination of the 
requirements under Subpart N of this 
part and the effective date of proposed 
§ 1926.1427(a) through (j) and (m). The 
four-year phase-in period discussed 
above is set out in proposed 
§ 1926.1427(k)(2).

both as a small Arabic numeral and as

Paragraph 1427(m) Definitions 

Proposed paragraph (m) defines two 

terms used in the qualification/ 
certification provisions in 
§ 1926.1427(b) through (e) (addressed 
above). Proposed § 1926.1427(m)(1) 
explains that, if an operator has a 
‘‘portable’’ certification, any employer 
may rely on that certification. The 
employer of an operator who carries a 
portable certification (which can be 
obtained only through the method 
described in proposed § 1926.1427(b)) 
has ensured that the operator has been 
qualified or certified, and has met the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1427(a). 

Proposed paragraph (m)(2) explains 
that, if an operator has a qualification 
that is ‘‘not portable,’’ only the 
employer who issued that qualification 
may rely on it for purposes of meeting 
the requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1427(a). As discussed above, 
OSHA is considering adding a third 
definition for the term ‘‘employee of the 
U.S. military’’ (see the discussion above 
of proposed § 1926.1427(d)). 
Dissenting View of C–DAC Member 
Brian H. Murphy 

Under the C–DAC ground rules 

(OSHA–S030–2006–0663, Ex. 36–1–8), 
the Committee reaches consensus if no 
more than two non-federal members 
dissent on a particular issue. The 
ground rules also provide that, upon the 
request of a dissenting member, OSHA 
will include the member’s reasons for 
dissenting in the preamble to the 
proposed rule. Two members of C–DAC, 
Mr. Brian H. Murphy and Mr. Craig 
Steel, dissented from the Committee’s 
draft of proposed § 1427. Mr. Murphy 
asked that his reasons for dissenting be 
included in the preamble, and provided 
them in the letter reprinted below 
(OSHA–2007–0066–0007). Note that, 
pursuant to the ground rules, OSHA has 
not reprinted comments in the letter 
regarding issues upon which the 
member did not dissent. 

Dear Deputy Assistant Secretary Snare: 
Thank you for providing an opportunity for 

the Associated General Contractors of 
America (AGC) to serve on the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) 
Crane and Derrick Advisory Committee (C– 
DAC). AGC welcomed and appreciated the 
chance to explore OSHA’s several options for 
a new standard on cranes and derricks with 
the other knowledgeable members of that 
committee. In addition, it was a personal 
privilege for me to represent AGC’s 33,000 
members. 

AGC is a nationwide trade association of 

general contractors, specialty contractors, 

material suppliers, equipment dealers and 
other firms that collectively form the core of 
the construction industry. The association 
was formed in 1918 at the express request of 
President Woodrow Wilson, and today, AGC 
maintains a network of 98 state and local 
chapters throughout the United States. Its 
members engage in the construction of 
commercial buildings, factories, warehouses, 
highways, bridges, airports, waterworks 
facilities, waste treatment facilities, dams, 
water conservation projects, defense facilities 
and multi-family housing projects, and on 
site preparation and utilities installation for 
housing development. 

AGC shares and strongly supports OSHA’s 

mission. While AGC occasionally disagrees 
with OSHA’s views on the best and most 
effective means and methods of improving 
construction safety and health, AGC is and 
will remain equally committed to that goal. 
Indeed, from its very inception, AGC has 
taken a great interest in the safety and health 
of construction workers. Its bylaws expressly 
provide that ‘‘[t]he members of [AGC] shall 
work to develop good relations with 
employees * * * and shall make every effort 
to provide safe working conditions on 
construction projects and to promote safe 
working habits by their employees. 

AGC has long taken a very proactive 

approach to construction safety and health. 
Over the last 15 years, AGC has produced 
over 100 videos and publications on the 
various practices and procedures that may be 
necessary, on any given jobsite, to protect 
construction workers from occupational 
injury or illness. Each year, AGC sponsors 
two nationwide safety award programs. 
Regularly, AGC also offers safety 
management training courses and other 
safety training programs. In 2003, AGC used 
a Susan Harwood Training Grant to train 
1,800 construction workers on OSHA’s new 
steel erection standard. In 2004, AGC will 
use a third grant to train another 600 
construction workers on fall protection. AGC 
was proud to receive these grants, and today, 
AGC is even prouder that an overwhelming 
number of its trainees gave these programs 
excellent reviews. These efforts demonstrate 
AGC’s commitment to partnering with OSHA 
to make construction work-sites safer. 

AGC also supports OSHA’s very specific 
effort to set new standards for the men and 
women operating cranes and derricks. AGC 
agrees that systematically increasing the 
knowledge and improving the skill of these 
construction workers will reduce the number 
of accidents involving cranes and derricks 
and limit the closely related risks of injury. 
Long before serving on C–DAC, AGC 
collaborated with the St. Paul Companies on 
an exemplary training program on the 
essentials of crane safety. AGC also signed a 
cooperative agreement with the National 
Commission for the Certification of Crane 
Operators (NCCCO), recognizing the 
‘‘importance of safe crane operations on our 
nation’s construction sites’’ and ‘‘the CCO 
written and practical examination is a 
method of documenting the qualifications 
criteria outlined in ASME B30.5–3.1–1995, 
‘‘Qualifications for and Conduct of Operators 
and Operating Practices.’’ 

As a member of C–DAC, fully committed 

to its goals and objectives, AGC worked long

and hard to find common ground with the 
other members of that group. At the end of 
the day, both AGC and the others did reach 
agreement on a vast majority of the issues 
that the group had to confront. The group 
wrote forty-two sections and two appendices 
into the new standard that it proposed to 
OSHA, developing a document that totaled 
one-hundred-nineteen pages in length. 
During its deliberations, the group reached 
agreement on forty-one of those sections and 
both appendices, which collectively 
accounted for one-hundred-twelve of the 
pages of text. On only one of the sections, 
and only seven pages of the text, did 
everyone fail to agree. On only that one 
section, and those few pages of text, did AGC 
find it necessary to part company with the 
others. (Endnote 1). 

AGC would not, however, suggest that the 
disagreement was a trivial one. Quite to the 
contrary, AGC believes that the disagreement 
was a serious one that OSHA needs to 
address. C–DAC accomplished most but not 
all of its mission. It is now incumbent upon 
OSHA to correct the one significant error that 
C–DAC made. 

The disagreement between AGC and the 
other members of the committee was over 
section 1427 of the committee’s proposal. 
That section is entitled ‘‘Operator 
qualification and certification.’’ In paragraph 
(a), it requires an employer to ‘‘ensure’’ that 
its crane and derrick operators are either: 

• ‘‘Qualified or certified * * * in 

accordance with’’ one of four procedures, 
found in the following paragraphs (b), (c), (d) 
and (e); or 

• ‘‘Operating the equipment during a 

training period in accordance with paragraph 
(f) 

Paragraph (b) of section 1427 provides for 

‘‘[c]ertification by an accredited crane/ 
derrick operator testing organization.’’ 
Paragraph (c) provides for ‘‘[q]ualification by 
an audited employer program.’’ Paragraph (d) 
provides for ‘‘[q]ualification by the U.S. 
military.’’ And paragraph (e) provides for 
‘‘[l]icensing by a government entity.’’ 
(Endnote 2) 

AGC opposes section 1427 primarily 

because its requirements for the qualification 
and certification of crane and derrick 
operators are too restrictive. For many and 
perhaps the vast majority of construction 
contractors, none of the four options for 
operator qualification or certification are 
practical to pursue. At the same time, section 
1427 omits several requirements that would 
far more directly affect crane and derrick 
safety. If adopted as currently written, 
section 1427 would disrupt the construction 
industry and might actually hinder the broad 
effort necessary to ensure that crane and 
derrick operators are knowledgeable, 
competent and well prepared, every day, to 
perform their work. 

Following are AGC’s more specific 

comments on each of the four options that 
Section 1427 provides, on the risks that this 
provision would create for any employer that 
chose to implement an operator training 
program, and on several significant 
omissions from the proposed standard.

Certification by an Accredited Crane/Derrick 
Operator Testing Organization 

While less restrictive than paragraph (d), 
paragraph (b) fails to provide an option for 
many and perhaps most of the small to 
medium-sized firms that dominate the 
construction industry. Paragraph (b) would 
permit employers to engage third parties to 
test and certify their crane and derrick 
operators, but in the process, paragraph (b) 
would severely restrict the number of 
organizations qualified to perform those 
tasks. The proposed standard would permit 
employers to rely on only those organizations 
‘‘accredited by a nationally recognized 
accrediting agency.’’ 

To the best of AGC’s knowledge, 

information and belief, only two 
organizations are ‘‘accrediting’’ agencies 
within the meaning and for the purposes of 
Section 1427, and only one of the two 
agencies has actually accredited any other 
organization to test and certify crane and 
derrick operators. During the lengthy 
deliberations among the members of C–DAC, 
the National Commission for Certifying 
Agencies (NCCA) and the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) were the only two 
organizations said to be such ‘‘accrediting’’ 
agencies. The NCCA was the only one of the 
two said to have actually accredited any 
other organization to test and certify 
operators. 

To make matters worse, it was 

acknowledged and agreed that the NCCCO is 
the only testing organization that the NCCA 
has accredited. If other organizations are also 
accredited to test and certify crane and 
derrick operators, within the meaning and for 
the purposes of Section 1427, then neither 
the other members of C–DAC nor OSHA 
identified them, and AGC is unaware of 
them. 

AGC would emphasize that it holds the 

NCCCO in high regard. As already 
mentioned, AGC has gone so far as to sign 
a cooperative agreement with the NCCCO. 
Nevertheless, AGC doubts that the NCCCO 
could meet the enormous demand that 
section 1427 would generate for crane and 
derrick operator testing and certification. If 
adopted, Section 1427 would take that 
demand to an entirely new level. It should 
be noted that NCCCO has largely succeeded 
in meeting the much more limited demand 
for voluntary certification. 

In fairness, AGC believes that other 

members of C–DAC harbor the same doubt. 
Something had to motivate the authors of 
section 1427 to include paragraph (k), 
delaying the mandate for operator testing and 
certification for four years. It is certainly 
possible that the other members of C–DAC 
supported section 1427 in the belief that 
other testing organizations would use this 
time to seek accreditation—in the hope of 
profiting on a dramatic increase in the 
demand for operator testing and certification. 
The problem is that neither the other 
members of C–DAC nor OSHA undertook any 
study of the costs that such organizations 
would have to incur to qualify for 
accreditation, or to provide testing or 
certification services on the massive scale 
that section 1427 contemplates. Nor did the 
other members identify the sources of capital 

that these other testing organizations would 
require, or the prices they would have to 
charge for their services, or how they could 
even begin to sustain themselves until testing 
and certification became mandatory. There 
were no business plans or business models 
for either the committee or OSHA to review. 
It might be appealing to suppose that future 
demand for testing and certification would 
call forth the necessary supply, but it would 
remain little more than speculation. There is 
no factual record to support any such 
conclusions. 

However logical it may be, AGC maintains 

that OSHA cannot simply suppose that the 
supply of the necessary services would 
materialize. The stakes are much too great. If 
other testing organizations did not enter the 
market, or they subsequently failed for 
financial or other reasons, or they simply 
found it necessary to charge more than most 
contractors could bear, the construction 
industry could quickly find itself in gridlock. 
AGC also doubts the wisdom of giving any 

private organization—whether the NCCA, 
ANSI, the NCCCO or any other accrediting 
agencies or testing organization—such a 
dominant role in the implementation of a 
federal regulation. Section 1427 would set 
minimal standards for accreditation, leaving 
most of that process in private hands. OSHA 
would not have any direct oversight over (or 
other relationship with) any testing 
organization. The agency would be two steps 
removed from that process. 
Qualification by an Audited Employer 
Program 

Paragraph (c) also fails to provide an 

option for many and perhaps most 
construction companies. That provision 
would permit an employer to test and qualify 
its own employees to operate cranes and 
derricks, but only if inter alia (1) the 
employer’s written and practical tests were 
‘‘developed by an accredited crane/derrick 
operator testing organization,’’ (2) the 
employer’s ‘‘program’’ were approved by an 
auditor ‘‘certified,’’ in turn, by such an 
organization, and (3) the ‘‘circumstances’’ 
under which the employer administered the 
tests were also approved by such an auditor. 

As noted, the NCCCO appears to be the 

only ‘‘accredited crane/derrick operator 
testing organization’’ at this time. AGC 
doubts that small or medium-sized 
construction contractors would have the 
resources necessary to self-administer the 
NCCCO’s written and practical tests, 
particularly ‘‘under circumstances * * * 
meeting nationally recognized test 
administration standards.’’ In addition, it 
appears that neither the NCCCO nor any 
other testing organizations would have any 
business incentive to develop a large pool of 
certified auditors. To the contrary, they 
would have an obvious interest in 
maintaining the demand for their own testing 
services, and their own certifications. 
Nothing in the proposed standard would 
compel or even encourage the NCCCO or any 
other testing organization to help 
construction employers develop practical 
alternatives. 

Further eroding paragraph (c) are 

provisions that would require the employer 
to have its ‘‘program’’ re-audited every three

years, and suspend the employer’s 
‘‘program’’ for any ‘‘significant deficiency.’’ 
Though it would expressly forbid the auditor 
of the employer’s program to be the 
employer’s employee—and therefore subject 
to the employer’s control—paragraph (c) 
would also render the employer liable for the 
auditor’s failure to file a ‘‘documented 
report’’ of any ‘‘significant deficiency’’ to 
OSHA within 15 days, to maintain records of 
his or her audits for three years, or to make 
such records available to the U.S. Department 
of Labor. 

For all of these reasons, AGC believes that 

paragraph (c) would not be a practical and 
dependable option for any significant 
number of construction employers. 
Qualification by the U.S. Military 

As a threshold matter, paragraph (d) is 

limited to the men and women in uniform. 
By its terms, it is ‘‘[n]ot portable,’’ meaning 
that it ‘‘meets the requirements of paragraph 
(a) only where the operator is employed by 
(and operating the equipment for) the 
employer that issued the qualification.’’ See 
Section 1427(m). To any operator to which 
paragraph (d) might apply, the military 
would be ‘‘the employer that issued the 
qualification.’’ It follows that any operator 
qualified by the military would be qualified 
to operate a crane or derrick only for the 
military. (Endnote 3). 
Licensing by a Government Entity 

Whether paragraph (e) provided any 

practical option for construction contractors 
would depend entirely on how state and 
local governments responded to it. This 
provision would permit employers to use 
state or local government agencies to test and 
license their crane and derrick operators. 
Employers, however, could use only the 
government agencies that had volunteered to 
perform those tasks. 

In some ways, paragraph (e) is superior to 

paragraphs (b) and (c). The state or local 
agency would have to be the one that 
‘‘issue[d] operator licenses for operating 
[relevant] equipment,’’ and it would have to 
qualify for accreditation as a ‘‘government 
accredited crane/derrick operator testing 
organization.’’ But the ‘‘government authority 
that overs[aw]’’ the agency, and not any 
private entity, would determine whether the 
agency met the substantive criteria for 
accreditation. Unlike paragraphs (b) and (c), 
paragraph (e) makes no direct or indirect 
reference to a ‘‘nationally recognized 
accrediting agency.’’ 

Paragraph (e) does not, however, go far 

enough to save Section 1427. It would not— 
and probably could not—require any state or 
local agency to test or license operators. It 
would not—and probably could not—provide 
any positive incentives for any such agency 
to perform those tasks. It would not—and 
probably could not—even reimburse any 
government agency that volunteered to 
perform those tasks. 

Many state and local budgets are already 
tight, and neither OSHA nor other members 
of C–DAC have given AGC any reason to 
expect that any significant number of state or 
local agencies would be likely to step 
forward. AGC believes that some would do 
so but doubts that the number would be high

enough, or their distribution broad enough, 
to meet what would be a truly nationwide 
demand for the testing and certification of 
crane and derrick operators. A government 
license issued under paragraph (e) would 
satisfy section 1427 ‘‘only within the 
jurisdiction’’ of the agency that issued it, and 
at best, AGC would expect an irrational 
patchwork of options for crane and derrick 
operators and their employers across the 
country. 
Operator Training 

AGC also believes that Section 1427 would 

put employers that provided hands-on 
training for crane or derrick operators at great 
and ultimately uncontrollable risk of liability 
for any accidents that their trainees or 
apprentices might cause, and could become 
a legal deterrent to such training. The 
relevant paragraph of the proposed standard 
is paragraph (f), entitled ‘‘Pre-qualification/ 
certification training period.’’ In 
subparagraph (f)(2)(i), that provision states 
that a trainee or apprentice ‘‘shall be 
provided with sufficient training prior to 
operating the equipment to enable the trainee 
to operate the equipment safely* * *’’ In 
subparagraph (f)(2)(ii), that provision adds 
that ‘‘[t]he tasks performed by the trainee/ 
apprentice while operating the equipment 
shall be within the trainee’s ability.’’ In 
subparagraph (f)(2)(iv)(C), that provision 
further provides that ‘‘[t]he specific tasks that 
the trainee/apprentice will perform during 
[any fifteen minute] break’’ that his or her 
supervisor may take ‘‘are within the trainee/ 
apprentice’s abilities.’’ 

If these were merely statements of 

principle, AGC would wholeheartedly 
support them. AGC completely agrees that 
trainees and apprentices should have any 
prior training that they require to operate the 
equipment safely. AGC completely agrees 
that all tasks that a trainee or apprentice 
actually performs—at any time—should be 
within his or her ability. 

The problem is that these would be legal 

requirements, and not merely goals to which 
contractors should aspire. As written, they 
would render contractors legally liable not 
for failing to make every reasonable effort— 
or even every conceivable effort—to provide 
such prior training, or to limit the tasks that 
a trainee or apprentice actually performed. In 
substance and effect, paragraph (f) would 
render contractors strictly liable for outcomes 
that contractors could not guarantee. If a 
trainee or apprentice caused an accident, it 
would necessarily follow that the individual 
did not have prior training ‘‘sufficient’’ to 
operate the equipment safely. It would also 
follow that the trainee or apprentice had 
actually performed a task not ‘‘within’’ his or 
her ‘‘ability.’’ 

Neither construction workers nor their 

supervisors are any less human than anyone 
else. No one can guarantee that others will 
not make mistakes, or that they will always 
follow instructions. Nor is an individual’s 
prior training, or his or her current abilities, 
something that one can measure with great 
precision. Of course, all construction 
contractors should make a very strong effort 
to prevent accidents. The human toll of any 
accident involving a crane or derrick can 
easily exceed anything that anyone would 

ever want to bear. Holding employers strictly 
liable for any accident that a trainee or 
apprentice may cause would, however, 
punish the good as well as the bad actors, 
and in the end, AGC fears that it would 
discourage useful training and hinder the 
effort to protect construction workers. One 
could well expect employers to provide no 
more than the minimum training necessary to 
satisfy the proposed standard, and whenever 
feasible, to engage third parties to perform 
that function. 
Significant Omissions From the Proposed 
Standard 

AGC also encourages OSHA to reconsider 

the broader question that Section 1427 raises. 
At the heart of that provision lies the 
assumption that elaborate procedures for 
testing and certifying crane and derrick 
operators would have benefits commensurate 
with their cost. The proposed requirements 
for such testing and certification are above 
and beyond the broader training 
requirements that C–DAC embedded—with 
AGC’s concurrence—in Section 1430. In 
many other instances, OSHA requires 
employers to train their employees, and even 
to ensure that the individuals employed to 
perform certain functions are ‘‘competent 
persons.’’ In these other instances, OSHA has 
not, however, found it necessary to go so far 
as to require sophisticated testing and formal 
certification. 

Paragraph (k) of Section 1427 contemplates 

a four-year ‘‘phase-in’’ for the testing and 
certification procedures, and indeed, for that 
substantial phase-in period, even the authors 
of Section 1427 considered it sufficient to 
require operators ‘‘to be competent,’’ to ‘‘be 
provided the necessary training,’’ and to be 
‘‘evaluated to confirm that he/she 
understands the information provided in the 
training.’’ Under these circumstances, AGC 
would consider it more than fair to request 
that OSHA take a hard look at the actual 
costs and benefits of ever going beyond 
paragraph (k)—to the point of requiring 
testing and certification by third parties 
beyond the federal government’s supervision 
or direct control. (Endnote 4). 

AGC would simply add that the costs of 

the proposed testing and certification could 
be social as well as financial. The 
construction workforce is not entire English- 
speaking. AGC is also concerned that Section 
1427 could have the unintended but clearly 
detrimental effect of limiting employment 
opportunities for competent crane operators 
who do not speak English. AGC is unaware 
of any organization that currently provides 
nationally recognized testing for crane or 
derrick operators in any language other than 
English.

In closing, AGC would like to thank you 

for the opportunity to serve on C–DAC. Crane 
and derrick safety is extremely important to 
AGC’s members, and the association greatly 
appreciated the chance to participate in the 
committee’s deliberations. 

In the end, C–DAC succeeded in reaching 

agreement on all but one of the provisions 
included in the standard that the committee 
proposed to OSHA. AGC could not support

that one provision because it is too 
restrictive. AGC supported the proposed 
requirements for the training of crane and 
derrick operators, and AGC could even 
support a carefully tailored and clear 
requirement that construction contractors 
employ ‘‘competent’’ operators for their 
cranes and derricks. AGC is far less certain 
that the benefits of mandating elaborate 
procedures for the sophisticated testing and 
formal certification of crane and derrick 
operators would ever outweigh the great cost 
of doing so.

AGC supports OSHA’s effort to improve 

crane and derrick safety, and believes that C– 
DAC has greatly contributed to that effort, but 
maintains that Section 1427 of the proposed 
standard requires serious reconsideration. 
Sincerely, 
/S/ 
Brian H. Murphy, P.E., C.S.P. AGC C–DAC 
Representative. 

Endnote 1: On that one section, the 

National Association of Home Builders also 
parted company with the other members of 
the committee. 

Endnote 2: Presumably, the authors of this 

provision intended to equate ‘‘licensing’’ 
with ‘‘qualification’’ or ‘‘certification.’’ 

Endnote 3: AGC has received reports that 

some members of C–DAC were led to believe 
that a military certification would be valid 
for a construction contractor working for the 
military on a military installation. The 
wording of paragraph (d) is, however, clear 
and makes no reference to military projects 
or installations, or to the contractors 
construction such projects at such locations. 
By the express and unambiguous terms of 
paragraph (d), a military certification is 
‘‘[n]ot portable’’ and in paragraph (m) by 
definition applies ‘‘only where the operator 
is employed by (and operating the equipment 
for) the employer that issued the 
certification.’’ 

Nor is it clear that OSHA could justify such 

awkwardly limited portability for military 
certifications. If OSHA rewrote paragraph (d) 
to provide for portability then whether a 
construction contractor could use a military 
certification to satisfy section 1427 would 
depend entirely on (1) whether the project 
owner is a branch of the military and (2) 
whether the project is located on a military 
installation. Those two factors would not, 
however, have any obvious bearing on the 
merits of the process that the military used 
to certify crane or derrick operators, or the 
knowledge or skills that such operators 
actually possessed. AGC cannot readily 
identify any rational basis for rendering a 
military certification portable to a contractor 
working for the military project on one of its 
installations but not portable to even the 
same contractor when working for a different 
owner, or simply across the street. 

In any event, paragraph (d) could not begin 

to solve the larger problem. Even if it 
provided for portability to construction 
contractors working for the military on 
military installations, paragraph (d) would 
remain far too limited to provide an option 
for the overwhelming majority of 
construction contractors. The military and its

installations account for only a small fraction 
of the contractors and projects that the new 
standard would cover. 

Endnote 4: AGC would also encourage 

OSHA to compare paragraph (k) with other 
standards that require construction 
contractors to employ ‘‘competent persons’’ 
to perform certain functions. AGC believes 
that many if not most of those other 
provisions define the required competence 
far more precisely. AGC presumes that 
paragraph (k) refers to competence in dealing 
with the various subjects listed in paragraph 
(j) of section 1427, or perhaps paragraph (c) 
of Section 1430, but paragraph (k) of section 
1427 does not cross-reference either of those 
other provisions or otherwise define the 
required competence. Nor does it define the 
‘‘required training.’’ 
[End of Murphy comments.] 

OSHA notes that Mr. Murphy 

indicated in his letter that proposed 
§ 1926.1427 would apply to derricks. 
However, under paragraph (q) of 
proposed §§ 1926.1436 Derricks, 
§ 1926.1427 would not apply to 
derricks. This is explained in more 
detail below in the discussion on 
proposed § 1926.1436. 

Operator qualification/certification 

was the only section of the C–DAC 
document for which there were 
dissenting committee members (as 
noted above, two members dissented: 
Mr. Murphy and Mr. Steele). In his 
letter, Mr. Murphy addressed a number 
of issues associated with this subject, 
such as questioning the need for, and 
practicality of, limiting an employer’s 
operator qualification/certification 
options to those that require the 
involvement of independent third 
parties. There was considerable 
discussion by C–DAC on this subject 
and its many associated issues, 
including the degree of portability of a 
qualification/certification. The Agency 
requests public comment on these 
issues. 
Physical Qualifications and Substance 
Abuse Testing 
Physical Qualifications 

Section 5–3.1 of ANSI B30.5–1968 

contains criteria for operator vision and 
hearing, disqualification for a ‘‘history 
of epilepsy’’ or a ‘‘disabling heart 
condition,’’ and a general statement that 
‘‘when he is physically or mentally 
unfit, an operator shall not engage in the 
operation of his equipment.’’ Subpart N 
at § 1926.550(b)(2) states that ‘‘all 
crawler, truck, or locomotive cranes in 
use shall meet the applicable 
requirements for design, inspection, 
construction, testing, maintenance and 
operation as prescribed in the ANSI 
B30.5–1968 * * *.’’ 

In a May 8, 1981 letter of 

interpretation to Mr. A. Bennett Hill Jr. 

(OSHA–2007–0066–0016), OSHA stated 
that: 

It is the interpretation of OSHA that the 

physical qualifications requirements 
incorporated by reference in 29 CFR 
1926.550 do not apply to operators of 
equipment covered by those standards. 

In other words, OSHA interpreted the 

incorporation by reference in 
§ 1926.550(b)(2) for ‘‘operation’’ as 
referring to how the crane was to be 
operated, not to who was operating it. 
The Agency therefore has taken the 
position that the incorporation by 
reference excludes the physical criteria 
listed above. 

C–DAC considered whether to 

include in this proposed standard 
provisions that would require 
equipment operators to meet particular 
physical qualifications. After 
considering various possible 
approaches, including those in current 
industry consensus standards, the 
Committee decided that it would be 
very difficult, and likely unnecessary, to 
identify minimum physical 
requirements that would be appropriate. 

First, the physical demands of 

equipment vary significantly depending 
on the type and, in some cases, age of 
the equipment. For example, some 
equipment is operated largely by 
electronic controls. In contrast, older 
‘‘friction cranes’’ have pedal controls 
that can require significant strength and 
stamina to operate. Some equipment is 
air conditioned whereas other 
equipment is not. A requirement 
regarding physical qualifications would 
have to account for these types of 
differences. 

Second, establishing physical 

qualifications that would appropriately 
account for the effect of medical 
conditions would be a complex 
undertaking. The Committee ultimately 
determined that, in light of its members’ 
experience that accidents caused by 
problems associated with the operator’s 
physical/medical condition are rare, the 
issue of physical qualifications did not 
need to be addressed by this standard. 
Substance Abuse Testing 

The Committee also considered 

whether to include mandatory 
substance abuse testing for equipment 
operators and others, such as signal 
persons, whose jobs affect safety. OSHA 
informed the Committee that the case 
law requires that any substance abuse 
testing requirements included in the 
proposal would have to meet 
constitutional safeguards.70 Because the

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59823 

U.S. Department of Transportation 
(DOT) already has substance abuse 
requirements and designed them to 
meet these safeguards, C–DAC 
considered whether to incorporate DOT 
regulations on controlled substance 
testing, Title 49 CFR part 382 and Title 
49 CFR part 40, into the proposed rule. 

The DOT regulations govern 

commercial drivers and are designed to 
protect public highway safety. Under 
these requirements an employer is 
required to establish a program for 
substance abuse testing. This program 
must include an employer’s policy 
statement, supervisory education and 
training, controlled substances and 
(optional) alcohol testing program, 
evaluation of driver, and recording 
keeping. Under the DOT requirements 
the controlled substances and alcohol 
testing program must include six 
different types of testing, which include: 
Pre-employment, reasonable suspicion, 
post-accident, random, return to duty 
and follow up testing. 

After researching the DOT regulations 

and several discussions with DOT 
representatives, OSHA presented 
information to C–DAC on the 
procedural and substantive aspects of 
the DOT regulations, including the 
administrative requirements, the types 
of testing by employers, and optional 
alcohol testing. Committee members 
discussed implementation and 
enforcement concerns such as an 
employer’s inability to ‘‘stand down’’ a 
crane operator based on an unconfirmed 
test result, until a positive result is 
verified by a medical review officer. The 
parallel DOT requirement prohibits an 
employer from: 
temporarily removing an employee from the 
performance of a safety-sensitive function 
based only on a report from a laboratory to 
the MRO (medical review officer) of a 
confirmed positive test for a drug or drug 
metabolite, an adulterated test, or a 
substituted test, before the MRO has 
completed verification of the test result. 

Committee members were concerned 

that including a substance testing 
provision in this standard would restrict 
an employer’s ability to suspend an 
operator who tested positive pending 
confirmation of the result. Committee 
members believed that many employers 
already have voluntarily instituted 
substance abuse testing programs. They 
believed that employers are able to 
judge whether an operator who tested 
positive presents a risk to workers on 
the site and should be able to remove an 
operator immediately if, in the 

Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Department of 
Transportation, 932 F.2d 1292 (9th Cir. 1991).

employer’s judgment, the operator 
presents such a risk. 

In short, the Committee balanced the 

potential benefits from a requirement for 
substance abuse testing that would have 
more restrictive procedures against the 
fact that many employers already have 
their own programs in place that, in C– 
DAC’s view, may be more protective 
than what could be enacted as an OSHA 
requirement. C–DAC concluded that it 
would be better not to include a 
substance abuse requirement. 
Section 1428 Signal Person 
Qualifications 

As discussed under § 1926.1419, 
Signals—general requirements, the 
safety of equipment operations depends 
in many situations on signals given to 
the operator. It is critical that the 
operator understand the signals given, 
and the signal person must therefore be 
able to give clear, accurate and 
appropriate signals that unambiguously 
convey the needed information to the 
operator. The Committee was concerned 
that some signal persons are not able to 
recognize the hazards involved with 
certain crane operations, do not, in 
some cases, understand what it is that 
the crane needs to do to accomplish the 
task, and do not know how to give the 
appropriate signals. This poses hazards, 
such as struck-by and crushed-by 
hazards, due to either 
miscommunication or the 
communication of instructions that are 
inappropriate. 

An example of the type of accident 

that can be caused by 
miscommunication from not knowing 
the appropriate signals is as follows: 
The signal person intends to indicate to 
the operator to hoist up, since the load 
needs to be raised straight up. However, 
the signal person uses the standard 
signal for booming up in the mistaken 
belief that this signal is for hoisting up. 
A struck-by or crushed-by incident 
could result because, when booming up, 
the load will move laterally as well as 
vertically. 

A failure to understand what it is that 

the crane needs to do to accomplish a 
task can also lead to struck-by or 
crushed-by incidents. For example, as a 
crane booms down, boom deflection 
tends to increase, which has the effect 
of lowering the load more than if there 
were no boom deflection. If the signal 
person is unfamiliar with this boom 
characteristic, he or she may fail to 
signal in time for the load to stop at the 
correct point or may cause the load to 
descend too quickly. 

The Committee concluded that to 

prevent such accidents it is necessary to 
establish qualification criteria that 

would have to be met in order for an 
individual to serve as a signal person 
(that criteria is set out in proposed 
§ 1926.1428(c), discussed below). The 
employer would have the option of 
using one of two methods for ensuring 
that these criteria were met. Under 
Option (1) (proposed § 1926.1428(a)(1)), 
the signal person would have 
documentation from a third party 
qualified evaluator showing that the 
evaluator had determined that the signal 
person meets the requirements of 
§ 1926.1428(c). 

This qualification would be portable, 
that is, any employer could rely on such 
documentation to show that a signal 
person meets the criteria. C–DAC 
believed that such portability would be 
appropriate because of the 
independence and expertise of the third 
party evaluator. 

Under Option (2) (proposed 

§ 1926.1428(a)(2)), an employer’s own 
qualified evaluator would have 
determined that a signal person meets 
the qualification requirements. Since 
such a determination would not be done 
by an independent entity, other 
employers would not have a basis to 
assume that the assessment had been 
done correctly. Therefore, a 
qualification under this option would 
not be portable; other employers would 
not be permitted to rely upon it to show 
that the signal person meets these 
requirements. 

The term ‘‘qualified evaluator’’ used 

in proposed § 1926.1428(a)(2) is defined 
in proposed § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a person 
employed by the signal person’s 
employer who has demonstrated that 
he/she is competent in accurately 
assessing whether individuals meet the 
Qualification Requirements in this 
Subpart for a signal person.’’ In 
reviewing the C–DAC document, the 
Agency realized that the Committee had 
not provided a definition for the term 
‘‘third party qualified evaluator,’’ which 
is used in proposed § 1926.1428(a)(1). 
OSHA has therefore added the following 
definition for this term: 
An entity that, due to its independence and 
expertise, has demonstrated that it is 
competent in accurately assessing whether 
individuals meet the Qualification 
Requirements in this Subpart for a signal 
person. 

The Agency requests public comment 

on whether this is an appropriate 
definition for this term. 

Under proposed paragraph (a)(3), the 
documentation for whichever Option is 
used (that is, Option (1) or (2)) of this 
section, would have to be available 
while the signal person is employed by 
the employer. With respect to an

59824 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

employer using Option (1) of this 
section, the signal person’s 
documentation from the third party 
qualified evaluator would have to be 
available. The Committee believed that 
this documentation is essential for this 
to be a viable and effective Option. 
Under this option the employer would 
be permitted to rely on someone else’s 
assessment of the signal person rather 
than its own. In such a circumstance 
such documentation is essential for this 
to be a reliable means of assuring the 
signal person has the requisite ability. 

In reviewing these provisions, the 

Agency noted that C–DAC used the term 
‘‘available,’’ rather than ‘‘available at the 
site.’’ It is OSHA’s understanding that 
C–DAC’s intent was that the 
documentation be available at the site 
by, for example, the documentation 
being physically present at the site or 
through use of an on-site computer. For 
clarity, OSHA is planning on changing 
the term ‘‘available’’ to ‘‘available at the 
site.’’ OSHA requests public comment 
on this issue. 

In addition, in reviewing the C–DAC 

draft of Option (2) of this section, the 
Agency noted that it does not explicitly 
state that documentation of the signal 
person’s qualification by this method is 
required. However, proposed 
§ 1926.1428(a)(3) states that ‘‘the 
documentation for whichever Option is 
used shall be available * * *.’’ It is not 
clear to the Agency if C–DAC intended 
to require documentation under Option 
(2) as it did for Option (1), or if it only 
intended that any documentation the 
employer chose to create under Option 
(2) would have to be made available. 

One reason to require documentation 

under Option (2) is the Committee’s 
concern that, at present, the operator’s 
employer has no ready means of 
determining if the signal person (who is 
typically a different employer’s 
employee) has the necessary knowledge 
and skill for signaling until after 
hoisting operations have begun. In other 
words, a problem with the signal 
person’s ability may not become evident 
to the operator until a hazardous 
situation has already arisen. Requiring 
documentation, which would have to be 
available at the site, would enable that 
determination be made before hoisting 
operations begin. 

Requiring documentation under 

Option (2) of this section would address 
C–DAC’s concern. Therefore, the 
Agency has expanded the first sentence 
of the C–DAC version of proposed 
§ 1926.1428(a)(2) to clarify that 
documentation would be required under 
Option (2). The proposed paragraph 
now reads, with the added language 
highlighted:

(2) Option (2)—Employer’s qualified 

evaluator. The employer has its qualified 
evaluator assess the individual and 
determine that the individual meets the 
Qualification requirements (see 
§ 1926.1428(c)) and provides documentation 
of that determination. An assessment by an 
employer’s qualified evaluator under this 
Option is not portable—other employers are 
not permitted to use it to meet the 
requirements of this section. 

The Agency requests public comment 
on whether this revision is appropriate. 

Proposed paragraph (b) addresses 

circumstances in which a signal person 
who had been qualified under 
§ 1926.1428(a) subsequently acts in a 
manner that indicates that he or she 
may not meet the qualification 
requirements. Such an indication would 
result, for example, where the use of 
Standard Method signals have been 
agreed to but the signal person does not 
give a Standard Method signal. Another 
example would be where the signal 
person gives inappropriate signals (such 
as indicating to the operator to boom up 
when the action that is needed is to 
hoist up). 

In such circumstances the employer 
would be prohibited from allowing the 
individual to continue working as a 
signal person until he or she is re- 
trained and has been requalified in 
accordance with proposed 
§ 1926.1428(a). 

Proposed paragraph (c) sets forth the 

qualification requirements for signal 
persons. Proposed paragraph (c)(1) 
would require that the signal person 
know and understand whatever signal 
method will be used for that particular 
job site. 

In addition, if hand signals are used, 

the signal person must know and 
understand the Standard Method for 
hand signals. Hand signals are widely 
used in this industry. As discussed 
above with respect to proposed 
§ 1926.1419(c), C–DAC believed that 
accidents due to miscommunication 
could be reduced if there were more 
widespread use of standardized hand 
signals. C–DAC concluded that this 
provision would promote greater use of 
standardized hand signals through the 
use of the Standard Method.71 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2) would help 
prevent miscommunication between the 
signal person and the crane operator by 
requiring the signal person to be 
competent in the application of 
whatever signals are used. 

71 As discussed above with respect to proposed 

1926.1419(c), there are circumstances when it 
would be permissible to use hand signals other than 
the Standard Method signals. Also, under proposed 
§ 1926.1419, signals other than hand signals could 
be used. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3) would 

require the signal person to have a basic 
understanding of crane operation and 
limitations, including crane dynamics 
involved in swinging and stopping 
loads and boom deflection from hoisting 
loads. As explained above in the 
beginning of this discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1428, it is critical that a signal 
person understand how the crane and 
load will move in response to the 
various signals he or she gives so that 
the signal person will give the most 
appropriate signals and reduce the 
occurrence of struck-by, crushed-by and 
other hazards. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4) specifies 

that signal persons must know and 
understand the relevant requirements in 
proposed §§ 1926.1419–1926.1422, 
which address the types of signals that 
may be used and the circumstances 
surrounding their use, and the 
requirements of proposed § 1926.1428. 
C–DAC included the phrase ‘‘relevant 
requirements’’ to make clear that a 
signal person’s qualification could be 
limited with regards to the use of a 
particular type of signal and associated 
information. 

For example: A crane operation is going to 

use Standard Method hand signals. The 
signal person knows and understands all 
aspects of proposed § 1926.1419 that are 
relevant when using hand signals, as well as 
§ 1926.1422, Signals—hand signal chart. In 
addition, the signal person meets the 
proposed requirements in proposed 
§ 1926.1428(c)(1) and (2) with respect to the 
use of Standard Method hand signals. The 
signal person also has the knowledge 
necessary to meet the provision in proposed 
§ 1926.1428(c)(3), and demonstrates through 
a verbal or written test, and through a 
practical test, that he/she has this knowledge 
and capabilities. However, the signal person 
is unfamiliar with the contents of proposed 
§ 1926.1420, Signals—radio, telephone or 
other electronic transmission of signals, or of 
proposed § 1926.1421, Signals—voice 
signals—additional requirements. 

In this example, it would be appropriate 
for the signal person to be qualified under 
either Option (1) or Option (2) (see proposed 
1926.1428(a)) so long as that qualification 
was limited to signaling with Standard 
Method hand signals. Since the signal person 
would be qualified only for Standard Method 
signaling, there would be no need for that 
person to have the knowledge or capabilities 
associated with other types of signaling. In 
such a situation employers, though, would be 
precluded from using such a person if other 
types of signals were to be used. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(5) would 
require that the signal person pass 
knowledge and practical tests to 
demonstrate that he or she meets the 
qualification requirements. It would 
allow the knowledge test to be either 
verbal or written. Reading or writing is

not normally necessary when working 
as a signal person. Therefore, C–DAC 
believed that administering the 
knowledge test verbally, without a 
separate demonstration of literacy, 
should be permitted. 
Section 1429 Qualifications of 
Maintenance and Repair Workers 

This proposed section addresses the 

qualifications that the workers who 
maintain and repair cranes/derricks 
must possess. Subpart N of this part 
currently contains no provisions 
concerning the qualifications of 
maintenance and repair workers. 
The Committee had two basic 

concerns regarding maintenance and 
repair work. First, it was aware of 
accidents that had occurred when the 
equipment that was being maintained or 
repaired was operated improperly. For 
example, a maintenance worker who 
booms down a mobile hydraulic crane 
to one side without following the 
manufacturer’s instructions for 
deploying outriggers may overturn the 
equipment. C–DAC believed that 
placing restrictions on equipment 
operations during such work would 
help prevent such accidents. 

Second, the Committee sought to 
avoid hazards that can result from 
maintenance and repair work that is 
done improperly by ensuring that 
maintenance and repair workers are 
sufficiently qualified to perform their 
work. For example, if a load-bearing 
component is removed for maintenance 
or repair and re-installed incorrectly, 
unintended movement of the load or 
even a collapse could occur during 
operations. 
Paragraph 1429(a) 

The Committee was aware that 
maintenance and repair workers 
sometimes need to operate equipment in 
order to perform maintenance, inspect 
or verify the performance of the 
equipment. This work typically involves 

operating the equipment to get access to 
components, diagnose problems and 
check repairs. 

C–DAC did not believe it necessary 

for maintenance, inspection and repair 
personnel to meet the requirements in 
proposed § 1926.1427, Operator 
qualification and certification, when 
operating equipment for such purposes. 
The operations involved for these 
purposes are almost always done 
without a load on the hook. The only 
instance when there is a load on the 
hook is if the equipment is load tested. 
However, even when load testing, the 
operation is very limited, since the load 
is not moved about as it would be 
during crane operations. 

While such limited operation does 
not, in C–DAC’s view, necessitate the 
maintenance, inspection or repair 
personnel to meet the proposed 
§ 1926.1427 requirements, a failure to 
operate the equipment properly even in 
these limited circumstances can result 
in accidents from, for example, 
unintended movement or tip-over. 
Therefore, this proposed paragraph 
would permit maintenance and repair 
workers to operate equipment during 
their work only under specific 
restrictions designed to ensure safety. 

Specifically, under proposed 

paragraph (a)(1), maintenance and 
repair workers would be permitted to 
operate the equipment only to the extent 
necessary to perform maintenance, 
inspect or verify the performance of the 
equipment. Under this provision, 
maintenance and repair workers would 
not be permitted to operate the 
equipment during regular operations. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2) would 
require the maintenance and repair 
worker who operates equipment to 
either (i) do so under the direct 
supervision of an operator who meets 
the requirements of § 1926.1427, 
Operator qualification and certification, 
or (ii) be familiar with the operation, 
safe limitations, characteristics and 

hazards associated with the type of 
equipment involved. 
Paragraph 1429(b) 

Proposed paragraph (b) provides that 
maintenance and repair personnel must 
meet the definition of a qualified person 
with respect to the equipment and 
maintenance/repair tasks they perform. 
Proposed § 1926.1401 defines ‘‘qualified 
person’’ as ‘‘a person who, by 
possession of a recognized degree, 
certificate, or professional standing, or 
who by extensive knowledge, training, 
and experience, successfully 
demonstrated the ability to solve/ 
resolve problems relating to the work, 
the subject matter, or the project.’’ In 
light of the safety hazards that could 
result from maintenance and repairs 
that are performed improperly, C–DAC 
believed that it was necessary for 
maintenance and repair workers to meet 
the ‘‘qualified person’’ criteria. 

The Committee believed that many 

current maintenance and repair workers 
have received comprehensive, in-depth, 
on-the-job training from highly 
experienced supervisors and/or co- 
workers and have become highly 
experienced themselves. Because of 
such extensive training, long experience 
and high level of knowledge, the term 
‘‘qualified persons’’ under this 
provision would include such workers 
under the prong for ‘‘extensive 
knowledge, training, and experience.’’ 
1430 Training 

This proposed section both references 
training criteria that would be required 
by other sections of this subpart and sets 
forth training criteria and requirements 
not otherwise included in the proposed 
standard. Additionally, paragraph 
§ 1926.1430(g) of this section would 
require employers to evaluate 
employees’ understanding of the 
training. The following chart 
summarizes the location of the training 
requirements in this proposed rule: 

Paragraph 

Training requirement 

§ 1926.1408(g) .................... Power line safety: The operator and crew assigned to work with the equipment, including spotters, must be trained 

in specified topics relevant to power line safety. 

§ 1926.1424(a)(2) ............... Swing radius hazards: Employees assigned to work on or near the equipment must be trained to recognize struck- 
by  and  pinch/crush  hazard  areas  of  rotating  superstructures.  Also,  where  the  employer  protects  against  swing 
radius hazards by using warning signs and high visibility markings, the employer must train employees to under-
stand what the markings signify. 

§ 1926.1437(c)(2)(ii) ........... Swing  radius  hazards  (floating  cranes):  Where  the  employer  protects  against  swing  radius  hazards  on  floating 
cranes  by  using  warning  signs  and  high  visibility  markings,  the  employer  must  train  employees  to  understand 
what the markings signify. 

§ 1926.1430(e) .................... Crush/pinch  points:  Employees  who  work  with  equipment  must  be  instructed  to  keep  clear  of  holes,  crush/pinch 

points, and the hazards addressed in § 1926.1424. 

§ 1926.1430(f) ..................... Tag-out:  Operators  and  other  employees  authorized  to  start/energize  equipment  or  operate  equipment  controls 

(such as maintenance and repair workers), shall be trained in the tag-out procedures in § 1926.1417(f). 

§ 1926.1430(d) .................... Competent and Qualified Persons: Competent persons and qualified persons must be trained in the requirements 

of this subpart applicable to their respective roles.

ments of § 1926.1428(c) shall be trained in the areas addressed in that paragraph. 

§ 1926.1428(b) .................... Signal person re-training: A signal person whose actions indicate that he or she does not meet the qualification re-

quirements of § 1926.1428 must be retrained before being allowed to continue to work as a signal person. 

§ 1926.1427(f)(2)(i) ............. Operator trainee/apprentice: Before a trainee/apprentice is assigned to operate equipment, the employee must be 
provided  with  sufficient  training  for  operating  the  equipment  safely  under  the  limitations  established  under

vided with necessary training prior to operating the equipment. 

§ 1926.1430(c)(1) ............... Operator  training  for  qualification  or  certification:  Operators  who  have  not  yet  been  qualified  or  certified  under 
§ 1926.1427 must be trained in the areas addressed in § 1926.1427(j). An operator who does not pass a quali-
fication or certification test must be retrained as necessary. 

§ 1926.1430(c)(2)(i) ............ Operator training—boom hoist brake test: Operators must be trained to determine if the boom hoist brake needs to 

be adjusted or repaired by first raising the boom a short distance and testing the brake. 

§ 1926.1430(c)(2)(ii) ........... Operator  training—emergency  procedures  (halting  unintended  movement):  Where  a  manufacturer’s  emergency 
procedures for halting unintended equipment movement are available, operators must be trained in those proce-
dures. 

§ 1926.1441(e) .................... Operator  training  (2,000  pound  maximum  rated  capacity):  Operators  of  equipment  with  a  rated  hoisting-lifting  ca-

pacity of 2,000 pounds or less must be trained in the safe operation of the equipment the operator is using. 

The Committee believed that both 

training and testing of certain 
employees are critical to the safety of 
equipment use on construction sites.72 
With respect to training, the Committee 
concluded that there is a need to 
improve upon the current general 
requirement for construction industry 
training established by § 1926.21, Safety 
training and education, which requires 
the employer to (1) ‘‘establish and 
supervise programs for the education 
and training of employers and 
employees in the recognition, avoidance 
and prevention of unsafe conditions in 
employments covered by the [OSH] 
Act,’’ § 1926.21(a), and (2) ‘‘instruct 
each employee in the recognition and 
avoidance of unsafe conditions and the 
regulations applicable to his work 
environment to control or eliminate any 
hazards or other exposure to illness or 
injury,’’ § 1926.21(b). 

C–DAC found that more specific 

provisions were needed to ensure that 
employees are able to work safely with 
and around cranes. First, greater 
specificity would highlight the 
particular tasks (and the hazards 
associated with them) for which certain 
types of training are necessary. Second, 
training tailored to the specific hazards 
faced by particular employees would be 
an efficient and effective means of 
preventing injury. 

72 With respect to operator testing, as discussed 

in connection with § 1926.1427, Operator 
qualification and certification, this proposed 
standard places special emphasis on ensuring that 
equipment operators have acquired the knowledge 
and skills necessary to operate their equipment 
safely. This proposed standard also includes 
specific assessment requirements for signal persons 
(see proposed § 1926.1428(a)).

Proposed paragraph (a), Overhead 

powerlines, states that employees must 
be trained as outlined at proposed 
§ 1926.1408(g) (see the explanation of 
hazards and training requirements in 
the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1408(g)). 

Under proposed paragraph (b), Signal 

persons, employees who will be 
assigned to work as signal persons who 
need training in order to meet the 
requirements of § 1926.1428(c) must be 
trained in the areas addressed in that 
paragraph. As discussed in relation to 
proposed § 1926.1428(c), each employee 
who will serve as a signal person must 
pass a verbal or written test and a 
practical test demonstrating the required 
knowledge and skills. Any such 
employee who does not pass those tests 
must receive additional training in the 
areas of deficiency. 

Proposed paragraph (c), Operators, 

provides, at proposed paragraph (c)(1), 
that an equipment operator who is 
neither qualified nor certified under 
§ 1926.1427, Operator qualification and 
certification, would be required to be 
trained in the areas addressed in 
§ 1926.1427(j). 

This proposed paragraph applies to 

operators who will need to be qualified 
or certified under § 1926.1427 but who 
are not yet qualified or certified or who 
have lost their qualification or 
certification. Operators in this category 
would include those who, during the 
four-year phase-in period of 
§ 1926.1427, would not yet be required 
to be qualified or certified. Also in this 
category would be employees who the 
employer has decided will be assigned 
to work as operators and will need to be 
qualified or certified under § 1926.1427, 

as well as operators who need such 
training in order to become re-qualified 
or re-certified, or who failed to pass a 
qualification or certification test. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2) would 

require operators to be trained in two 
practices. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) would 
require training in the testing of the 
boom hoist brake on friction equipment 
prior to moving a boom off a support to 
determine whether the brake requires 
adjustment or repair. The purpose of 
this procedure is to ensure that the 
brake is sufficient before the boom is at 
too great an angle or height. Using this 
procedure, if the brake is deficient, the 
boom will fall only a very short 
distance. This provides an additional 
safety practice related to the hazards 
resulting from an uncontrolled boom. 
Moving the boom when the brake is not 
working properly can result in 
uncontrolled lowering of the boom, 
which can endanger workers in the 
proximity of the hoisting equipment. 
Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(ii) would 

require the operator to be trained in the 
manufacturer’s emergency procedures, 
when available, for stopping unintended 
equipment movement. This provides 
another level of protection to minimize 
employee injury resulting from 
unintended equipment movement. The 
Committee recognized that 
manufacturer’s emergency procedures 
for halting unintended equipment 
movement may not always be available 
and therefore this training would be 
required only when the procedures are 
available. 

The C–DAC version of 

§ 1926.1430(c)(2) began: ‘‘In addition to 
training in the areas addressed in 
§ 1926.1427(j), operators shall be trained

in the following practices.’’ This 
wording implied that all operators must 
be trained in the topics listed in 
§ 1926.1427(j). However, § 1926.1427(j) 
is not a training requirement but sets 
forth criteria that must be addressed in 
a qualification or certification test. 
Operators who are sufficiently 
knowledgeable in these topics through 
prior training and/or experience need 
not receive additional training under 
this proposed standard. To avoid any 
confusion in this regard, OSHA has 
changed C–DAC’s wording to read, in 
proposed § 1926.1430(c)(2): ‘‘Operators 
shall be trained in the following 
practices.’’ 

The SBREFA Panel recommended 
that OSHA seek public comment on 
several issues related to operator 
training. Several Small Entity 
Representatives (SERs) believed that the 
training requirements in the proposed 
standard are too broad and should 
instead be keyed to the particular 
operations the operator performs and 
the particular equipment he/she 
operates. The SBREFA Panel also 
recommended that OSHA consider and 
ask for public comment on whether a 
more limited operator training program 
would be appropriate for operations 
based on the capacity and type of 
equipment and nature of operations. 

The Panel noted that proposed 

§ 1926.1427(j)(1)(i) requires operator 
training in ‘‘the information necessary 
for safe operation of the specific type of 
equipment the individual will operate’’ 
and understood this to address the 
SERs’ concern that operators of smaller 
capacity equipment used in less 
complex operations should require less 
training than those operators of higher 
capacity, complex equipment used in 
more complex situations. The Panel 
recommended that OSHA seek public 
comment on whether this point should 
be made more clearly, and OSHA 
welcomes such comment. 

The Panel further recommended that 

OSHA consider and ask for public 
comment as to whether the supervisor 
responsible for oversight for an operator 
in the pre-qualification period described 
at § 1926.1427(f) should have additional 
training beyond that required at 
§ 1926.1427(f)(2)(iii)(B). The discussion 
was focused on the issue of whether the 
supervisor should be trained to be able 
to take over the controls, if necessary, 
while supervising the operator in the 
pre-qualification period. 

As the proposed rule is written, when 
the supervisor is not a certified operator, 
he/she must be certified on the written 
portion of the test and be familiar with 
the proper use of the equipment’s 
controls; the supervisor is not required 

to have passed a practical operating test. 
In accordance with the Panel’s 
recommendation, OSHA requests 
comment on whether the supervisor 
needs additional training in this regard 
than the proposal would require. 

Paragraph (d), Competent persons and 

qualified persons, would require that 
competent persons and qualified 
persons be trained regarding the 
requirements of this Subpart applicable 
to their respective roles. See 
§ 1926.1401, Definitions, for a 
description of what is necessary to be a 
competent person or a qualified person. 
A person assigned by an employer to 
be a ‘‘competent person’’ or ‘‘qualified 
person’’ under this proposed rule must 
already have had a certain level of 
training (or, in the case of a competent 
person, training or experience) in order 
to meet the criteria applicable to such a 
designation. This paragraph does not 
address such training—it would not 
require the employer to provide the 
training needed for an employee to meet 
those criteria in order to become a 
competent or qualified person. The sole 
purpose of this paragraph is to require 
the employer to ensure that both 
competent persons and qualified 
persons are trained on the requirements 
of this Subpart that are applicable to the 
person’s role and responsibility. For 
example, a ‘‘competent person’’ 
assigned to conduct shift inspections 
under § 1926.1412(d) must be trained 
under proposed § 1926.1430(d) in the 
required elements of a shift inspection. 
This training is necessary to ensure the 
competent person or qualified person is 
aware of his/her responsibility under 
this subpart for finding/correcting 
hazardous conditions. 

Proposed paragraph (e), Crush/pinch 

points, provides that employees who 
work with equipment covered by this 
Subpart must be instructed to stay clear 
of holes, crush/pinch points and the 
hazards that are addressed in 
§ 1926.1424, Work area control. See the 
discussion of hazards and requirements 
in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1424. 

Proposed paragraph (f), Tag-out, states 

that operators and other employees 
authorized to start or energize 
equipment or operate equipment 
controls (such as maintenance and 
repair workers) must be trained 
according to the tag-out procedures in 
§ 1926.1417(f). See the discussion of tag- 
out procedures discussed in proposed 
§ 1926.1417(f). 

Proposed paragraph (g), Training 
administration, would require that 
employers ensure employees 
understand required training and 
provide refresher training when 

necessary. Specifically, proposed 
§ 1926.1430(g)(1) would require that the 
employee be evaluated to verify that he/ 
she understands the information 
provided in training required by this 
Subpart. The Committee determined 
that training without any follow-up 
measure to determine understanding or 
effectiveness would not achieve the goal 
of a safe work environment. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(2) would 

require the employer to provide 
refresher training of an employee when, 
based on evaluation or employee 
conduct, it is indicated that retraining is 
needed. 
Section 1431 Hoisting Personnel 

Cranes and derricks are designed to 

move materials, not personnel. 
However, situations arise when a crane 
or derrick can be the safest means to 
move employees to their work area and/ 
or to hold them in position while they 
do their work. 

Although there are situations when 

using a crane or derrick to lift personnel 
to work areas is the safest means of 
accomplishing the task, there are 
inherent dangers in such an operation 
because of the heights, equipment and 
environment involved. A number of 
workers have been killed and seriously 
injured while being lifted by a crane or 
derrick when the equipment’s lifting 
mechanism malfunctioned and they did 
not have adequate fall protection. The 
height to which the workers are lifted 
means that any instability in their 
supporting platform creates a serious 
fall hazard. See 53 FR 29116, 29117–18 
(Aug. 2, 1988) (discussing accidents that 
occurred when cranes were used to lift 
personnel). Because of that risk, in 1988 
OSHA added regulations to subpart N of 
this part to both limit the use of cranes 
for lifting personnel and increase 
employee protection when it is 
necessary to use cranes for this purpose. 
See 29 CFR 1926.550(g), Crane or 
derrick suspended personnel platforms. 
Because of the inherent hazards such 

operations present, OSHA currently 
permits cranes and derricks to be used 
to lift personnel only ‘‘when the 
erection, use, and dismantling of 
conventional means of reaching the 
worksite, such as a personnel hoist, 
ladder, stairway, aerial lift, elevating 
work platform or scaffold, would be 
more hazardous, or is not possible 
because of structural design or worksite 
conditions.’’ 29 CFR 1926.550(g)(2). 
When a crane or derrick is used to lift 
personnel, a personnel platform that 
complies with requirements in 
§ 1926.550(g) must be used. 

The Committee concluded that the 

current subpart N standards governing

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

personnel hoisting by equipment have 
resulted in a reduction of accidents and 
determined that their fundamental 
substance should be maintained in the 
proposed standard. Accordingly, the 
Committee proposal largely continues 
the current requirements of subpart N, 
§ 1926.550(g). Some changes have been 
made to provide additional safety and to 
eliminate ambiguity. Requirements 
specific to certain activities, such as 
personnel hoisting in pile-driving 
operations, drill shafts, storage tanks 
and marine transfer have been added. 
The discussion below focuses on these 
changes and additions. 

One of the resources the Committee 
consulted in developing this proposed 
paragraph was ASME B30.23–1998, 
‘‘Personnel Lifting Systems.’’ Since the 
Committee finished its work, that 
industry consensus standard was 
superseded by ASME B30.23–2005. 
OSHA has compared the two versions 
and found no substantive differences in 
the provisions that correspond to 
paragraphs in this proposal. Where the 
ASME standard is cited in this section, 
the citations will refer to the 2005 
version. 

OSHA stresses that the proposed 
provisions in this section would be 
additional requirements that must be 
met when equipment is used to lift 
personnel. During such use, all other 
applicable requirements of this 
proposed standard would also be 
required to be met. 
Paragraph 1431(a) 

This proposed paragraph states that 

equipment may be used to hoist 
personnel only when all other means of 
reaching the work area would present a 
greater hazard or would not be possible 
because of the project’s structural design 
or worksite conditions. The same 
limitation is currently found in Subpart 
N’s § 1926.550(g)(2). It reflects OSHA’s 
longstanding recognition that using 
cranes and derricks to lift personnel is 
inherently hazardous and should only 
be done when it is either the least 
hazardous means or when, in light of 
the configuration of the worksite, it is 
the only means of performing required 
work. 

This proposed paragraph differs from 

the current § 1926.550(g)(2) by 
substituting the word ‘‘equipment’’ for 
‘‘crane or derrick.’’ The terms ‘‘crane’’ 
and ‘‘derrick’’ do not represent the full 
spectrum of equipment that would be 
covered by this standard. See 
§ 1926.1400, Scope for a description of 
the equipment covered by this Subpart. 
Additionally, this proposed paragraph 
would not apply to work covered by 29 
CFR part 1926 subpart R, Steel Erection.

Subpart R, at § 1926.753(c)(4), allows 
the use of equipment to hoist personnel 
in a platform that complies with 
§ 1926.550 without the need for a 
showing that other means of reaching 
the work area would create a greater 
hazard or are impossible. This provision 
was included in Subpart R because steel 
connectors must often work at high 
locations before there is a solid structure 
to stand on and where a personnel 
platform suspended from a crane is the 
safest place for them to work. OSHA’s 
reasons for including this exception in 
Subpart R are discussed in detail in the 
preamble to the steel erection standard, 
66 FR 5196, 5209 (Jan. 18, 2001). 
Paragraph 1431(b) Use of Personnel 
Platform 

This proposed paragraph would 

generally require the use of a personnel 
platform when hoisting employees and 
require that criteria specified in 
proposed § 1926.1431(e) be met for such 
platforms. It also provides for 
exceptions to the use of personnel 
platforms that are not currently allowed 
by § 1926.550(g)(2). 

For reasons discussed above, 

proposed § 1926.1431(b)(1) would 
generally require that a personnel 
platform be used when hoisting 
employees and that the platform meet 
the requirements of § 1926.1431(e) of 
this proposed section. As discussed 
below, the requirements of 
§ 1926.1431(e) are comparable to 
requirements currently found in 
§ 1926.550(g). 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2), 

Exceptions, sets forth the construction 
activities in which hoisting personnel 
without using a personnel platform 
would be allowed because, in the 
Committee’s view, use of a personnel 
platform might be infeasible or more 
hazardous than an alternative means of 
hoisting personnel. These activities are: 
Hoisting employees into and out of drill 
shafts 8 feet and smaller in diameter, 
pile driving operations, marine 
worksites, storage tanks (steel or 
concrete), and shaft operations and 
chimney operations. This proposed 
section contains specific requirements 
for hoisting personnel during these 
operations at § 1926.1431(o), (p), (r), and 
(s) that provide for alternatives to the 
use of a personnel platform. For drill 
shafts, pile driving operations, storage 
tanks, and shaft and chimney 
operations, which present access 
restrictions, the alternative to a 
personnel platform would be a 
boatswain’s chair. For marine worksites, 
it would be a marine hoisted personnel 
transfer device, which is designed to 

facilitate exit in the event it enters the 
water. 

For the purposes of this proposed 

standard, a ‘‘marine worksite’’ is a 
construction worksite that is located in, 
on or above the water (see proposed 
§ 1926.1401, Definitions). The 
Committee determined it was necessary 
to clearly define this term since marine 
worksite conditions and hazards differ 
significantly from non-marine 
worksites. In particular, with respect to 
equipment covered by this section, the 
marine worksite presents unique 
hazards for equipment stability and 
environmental conditions affecting 
operations. 

Section 1926.1401 defines a ‘‘marine 
hoisted personnel transfer device’’ as a 
device, such as a ‘‘transfer net’’ used to 
hoist an employee to or from a marine 
worksite that is designed to protect the 
employee during a marine transfer and 
that allows for rapid entry/exit from the 
device. Such devices do not include a 
boatswain’s chair when hoisted by 
equipment covered by this standard. 
The Committee determined it was 
necessary to clearly specify the type of 
device that will or will not be 
considered a marine hoisted personnel 
transfer device for this standard, as 
marine worksites involve unique 
conditions and hazards with respect to 
hoisting employees. The Committee 
determined that it was necessary to 
require a device designed for such 
conditions while allowing flexibility so 
the employer may select the most 
appropriate device based on the site and 
working conditions. 

Each of the exceptions is discussed 
below under the particular paragraph 
that addresses it. Subpart N of this part 
does not currently address these 
worksite activities (nor does ASME 
B30.23–2005 address these particular 
topics). 
Paragraph 1431(c) Equipment Set-Up 

This paragraph sets forth the basic 

criteria for equipment set-up for 
personnel hoisting. The requirements 
continue and refine those currently in 
Subpart N’s § 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(D). 
Proposed paragraph (c)(1) would 

require the equipment to be on level, 
firm and stable footing. It differs from 
the current standard at 
§ 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(D) in that a qualified 
person must determine if the footing is 
‘‘sufficiently firm and stable.’’ Stable 
footing is essential to minimize the 
hazard of the equipment tipping while 
hoisting personnel. ASME B30.23– 
3.2.2(a)(4)–2005 has a similar 
requirement, with the operator of the 
equipment determining equipment to be 
level within one percent during set-up

and hoisting operations. The Committee 
believed that the danger of equipment 
potentially tipping when hoisting 
personnel justifies the need for a 
qualified person to examine and 
approve the equipment’s stability. See 
§ 1926.1401, Definitions for the criteria 
for a qualified person. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2) specifies 
that each outrigger be both extended 
and locked. The amount of extension 
must be the same and also be in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s 
specifications. This is similar to the 
current requirement of 
§ 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(D); however, the 
current requirement that outriggers be 
‘‘fully deployed’’ has been changed to 
require that outriggers be equally 
extended and in accordance with 
manufacturer’s procedures and load 
charts. Equal extension eliminates the 
hazard of the operator forgetting that 
one or more outriggers has a shorter 
extension and swinging into that area 
with a load that exceeds the crane’s 
capacity in that area. The Committee 
determined that a requirement of full 
extension of all outriggers would not be 
appropriate for all worksite conditions. 
Nor is it necessary, as long as partial 
extension is within the manufacturer’s 
procedures; the critical factor is to have 
each outrigger extended equally, 
whether it is a full or shorter extension. 
Proper placement and deployment of 

outriggers is essential to prevent the 
hazard of equipment tipping while 
hoisting personnel. 
Paragraph 1431(d) Equipment Criteria 

This paragraph sets forth 

requirements for the equipment used to 
hoist personnel. These requirements 
refine and expand the equipment 
requirements currently in Subpart N. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1): Capacity: 
use of suspended personnel platform, 
would continue the requirement at 
§ 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(E) to limit the total 
load to 50 per cent of the equipment’s 
rated capacity. It would clarify the 
current standard by specifying that the 
total load includes the hook, load line, 
and rigging. The 50 percent capacity 
limit would not apply during equipment 
proof testing. 

The 50 percent limit reflects that 

using this equipment to hoist personnel 
requires additional safety precautions 
than when lifting materials. The limit 
provides for an extra margin of safety to 
prevent overloading the equipment, 
which could cause tip-over or structural 
collapse. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2), Capacity: 

use of boom-attached personnel 
platforms, establishes the load limit at 
50 percent of rated capacity for

platforms that are attached to the boom. 
It also provides an exception to the 50 
percent capacity limit during equipment 
proof testing. The same reasons for the 
50 percent limit in § 1926.1431(d)(1) 
also apply here. 

The Committee considered 

prohibiting the use of boom attached 
personnel platforms for hoisting 
personnel. However, the Committee 
concluded that it was unaware of any 
reason to prohibit their use. As 
discussed above under § 1926.1400, 
Scope, Committee members were 
concerned that boom-attached platforms 
may present additional hazards not 
addressed in this proposed standard, 
and OSHA is requesting comment on 
whether additional requirements should 
apply when using them. 

In reviewing the C–DAC consensus 

document, the Agency determined that 
the Committee did not address the issue 
of capacity when no personnel platform 
is used. Since there are several 
situations where no platform will be 
used at all (these are listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1431(b)(2) of this section), the 
Agency believes that a capacity limit 
similar to those set by the Committee 
when using a personnel platform is 
needed. Therefore, OSHA has added 
proposed § 1926.1431(d)(3), Capacity: 
hoisting personnel without a personnel 
platform, which establishes the load 
limit at 50 percent of rated capacity. In 
calculating the load, the weight of the 
personnel, including the hook, load 
line, rigging and any other equipment 
that imposes a load must be included. 
The addition of this proposed paragraph 
has resulted in the renumbering of the 
remaining paragraphs in proposed 
§ 1926.1431(d) (as compared to the 
numbering in the C–DAC document). 

Proposed paragraph (d)(4) would 
require engaging all the equipment’s 
locking or braking devices when the 
platform has reached its stationary work 
position. The purpose is to minimize 
sudden and unintended movement or 
tipping of the platform when employees 
have reached the work area. 

This differs from current provision 
§ 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(C) in Subpart N in 
that the proposed provision adds a 
requirement to use operator actuated 
secondary braking/locking features, 
when available, in addition to other 
braking systems. This is similar to 
sections 1.2.2(f) and 3.2.2(a)(19) of 
ASME B30.23–2005 for automatic brake 
systems and setting of brakes before 
work begins from the platform. 
The subsections of proposed 

paragraph (d)(5), Devices, would require 
certain safety devices for equipment 
addressed by this proposed section. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(5)(i) would 

address the requirements for equipment 
with a variable angle boom. Such 
equipment would be required to be 
equipped with both a boom angle 
indicator and boom hoist limiting 
device (except for derricks). Use of these 
devices minimizes the potential for 
hoisting personnel at an unsafe angle, 
which could result in the platform or 
equipment tipping. 

A boom angle indicator is currently 

required in § 1926.550(g)(3)(ii)(A). 
Proposed § 1926.1431(d)(4)(i) would 
add a requirement for a boom hoist 
limiting device. The Committee 
believed that both a boom angle 
indicator and a boom hoist limiting 
device are necessary to prevent the 
boom from being moved to unsafe 
angles. A boom hoist limiting device 
would be required when hoisting 
personnel, even though it would not 
otherwise be required for equipment 
manufactured before December 17, 1969 
under proposed § 1926.1416(d)(1) (see 
discussion of proposed § 1926.1416(d)— 
Operational aids). This reflects the need 
for equipment used to hoist personnel to 
have additional safety features. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(5)(i) would 

not apply to derricks. This is consistent 
with C–DAC’s recommendation that 
boom hoist limiting devices and boom 
angle indicators not be required on 
derricks. See proposed § 1926.1436(f), 
which addresses operational aids for 
derricks. As discussed below, the 
Committee believed that these devices 
were not needed on derricks because the 
current practice in the industry of 
marking the boom hoist cable of 
derricks with visible caution and stop 
marks corresponding to maximum and 
minimum allowable boom angles is a 
safe work practice. Accordingly, 
paragraph § 1926.1436(f) permits 
employers to use this practice. 
Alternatively, it permits employers to 
use an electronic or other device that 
either signals the operator in time to 
prevent the boom from moving past its 
minimum and maximum angles or 
automatically prevents such movement. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(5)(ii) would 

address the requirements for equipment, 
including derricks, when a luffing jib is 
used for personnel hoisting. This 
paragraph would require all equipment 
to have both a jib angle indicator and jib 
hoist limiting device. Use of these 
devices minimizes the likelihood of 
platform tipping and equipment failure. 

Neither the current Subpart N nor 

ASME B30.23–2005 addresses the use of 
luffing jibs for personnel hoisting. The 
Committee believed that this proposed 
requirement is needed to help improve

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

the safety of crane and derrick 
operations. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(5)(iii) would 

require a telescoping boom to either 
have a device indicating the boom’s 
extended length or measuring marks 
that are clear and visible to the 
equipment operator. This would allow 
the operator to easily ascertain the 
extension length in order to stay within 
safe operating parameters. This 
requirement would address the hazard 
of equipment or platform tipping or 
equipment failure that can result when 
a telescoping boom is extended beyond 
appropriate operating parameters. 
Currently, § 1926.550(g)(3)(ii)(B) 
permits, as an alternative to equipping 
the boom with a device to indicate the 
boom’s extended length, an ‘‘accurate 
determination’’ to be made of the load 
radius to be used prior to hoisting 
personnel. Proposed 
§ 1926.1431(d)(5)(iii)’s provision for 
measuring marks on the boom would 
enable this determination to be made 
accurately if the boom is not equipped 
with a device indicating its extended 
length. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(5)(iv), Anti- 
two-block, would require a device that 
automatically prevents contact between 
a component on the hoist line (load 
block, overhaul block, etc.) with the 
boom tip, which can damage or sever 
the load line or cause other forms of 
equipment failure. This contact between 
the hoist line component and the boom 
tip is referred to as two-blocking. The 
purpose of the anti-two-blocking device 
is to prevent this condition, which can 
result in a sudden drop of the personnel 
platform. See the discussion of two- 
blocking in proposed § 1926.1416, 
Operational aids. 

Paragraph (d)(5)(iv) is similar to 

current § 1926.550(g)(3)(ii)(C) and adds 
an exception for pile driving operations. 
The proposed requirement would not 
apply when hoisting personnel in pile 
driving operations due to the fact the 
vibration of the pile driving activity 
makes use of an anti-two-block device 
ineffective. 

In reviewing this portion of the C– 

DAC document, the Agency has noted 
that the use of alternative measures for 
preventing two-blocking during pile 
driving operations would be required 
under proposed § 1926.1431(p)(2). 
However, the C–DAC language for 
proposed provision 
§ 1926.1431(d)(5)(iv) did not refer to the 
requirement for alternative measures. 
Therefore, OSHA has added a reference 
to the exception in § 1926.1431(d)(5)(iv) 
advising the reader that alternative 
measures are required under 
§ 1926.1431(p)(2). 

Proposed paragraph (d)(5)(v), 

Controlled load lowering, would require 
a system or device on the load line hoist 
drum that positively regulates the 
lowering speed. It would require this 
system to be used when hoisting 
personnel, in addition to a load line 
hoist brake. The purpose is to minimize 
the likelihood of free fall of the 
personnel that could lead to hitting the 
ground from a sudden fast descent. 
Additionally, the proposed paragraph 
would note that free fall of the load line 
hoist is prohibited and use of equipment 
in which the boom hoist mechanism can 
free fall is prohibited. Refer to proposed 
§ 1926.1426, Free fall/controlled load 
lowering, for additional information. 

Currently, 1926.550(g)(3)(ii)(D) 

similarly requires a system or device 
that positively regulates the lowering 
speed. Proposed § 1926.1431(d)(5)(v) 
would explicitly specify that the system 
must be used when hoisting personnel. 
Proposed paragraph (d)(5)(vi), Proper 

operation required, specifies that 
personnel hoisting would only occur 
when and if all the devices required in 
§ 1926.1431(d)(5)(i) through (v) are in 
proper working order. It would also 
mandate that if a required device stops 
working while personnel are being 
hoisted, all personnel hoisting 
operations must be stopped and not 
resumed until all devices are working 
properly. Alternative measures would 
not be allowed. 

The purpose of this paragraph is to 

clearly establish that personnel hoisting 
may only be done when all necessary 
safety devices are working properly. The 
hazards addressed by this requirement 
include: structural failure, equipment 
tipping, dropping personnel, and 
platform tipping. These are severe 
hazards, so safeguards to prevent them 
are clearly needed. 

This paragraph does not have a 

specific corollary in the current Subpart 
N, although the Subpart N provisions 
that require safety devices implies that 
they be working properly. Sections 
3.2.2(a)(23) and 1.2.2 of ASME B30.23– 
2005 are comparable to this 
requirement. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(6) would 

prohibit the use of a personnel platform 
directly attached to a luffing jib. Thus, 
only a suspended type of personnel 
platform may be used on a luffing jib. 
The Committee determined that it 
would be dangerous to use a boom- 
attached personnel platform if attached 
to a luffing jib and that a complete 
prohibition of use of a boom-attached 
personnel platform to a luffing jib is 
appropriate. 

Paragraph 1431(e) Personnel Platform 
Criteria 

This proposed paragraph would 

establish the minimum criteria for a 
personnel platform. The criteria are 
similar to those currently in 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart N’s § 1926.550(g)(4)(i) and 
(ii). However, § 1926.1431(e)(2) would 
add the requirement that the connection 
system keep the platform within 10 
degrees of level and § 1926.1431(e)(10) 
would add a visibility requirement for 
the overhead protective cover to the 
personnel platform. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(1) would 

require that both the platform and its 
attachment/suspension system be 
designed by a qualified person who 
understands structural design and be 
designed for the particular function of 
personnel hoisting. The purpose of this 
paragraph is to clearly stipulate that the 
platform must be designed for employee 
safety. This would address the hazards 
of structural failure of the platform, 
failure of the attachment/suspension 
system, and preclude the use of designs 
that would be inappropriate for hoisting 
people. This is similar to the current 29 
CFR part 1926 subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(i)(A), which states that 
either a ‘‘qualified engineer or a 
qualified person competent in structural 
design’’ shall design the platform, but 
clarifies that even if the platform is 
designed by a qualified engineer, that 
engineer must understand structural 
design. See § 1926.1401, Definitions, for 
the definition of ‘‘qualified person.’’ 
Proposed paragraph (e)(2) would 

require the system used to connect the 
personnel platform to the equipment to 
be within 10 degrees of level. This 
would address the hazard of platform 
tipping by maintaining the platform 
close to level. This requirement is not 
currently in subpart N. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(3) would 

require the platform designer to 
consider the movement of employees on 
the platform and design the suspension 
system to minimize platform tipping 
from such movement. The purpose is to 
design the platform in such a way as to 
limit the likelihood of platform tipping 
while employees are working from the 
platform. This continues the 
requirement of subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(i)(B). 

Proposed paragraph (e)(4) would 

require the platform to support its own 
weight plus a minimum of five times the 
maximum intended load without 
failure. This limit would provide an 
adequate margin of safety for employee 
protection from structural failure of the 
platform. The guardrail system and 
personal fall arrest system anchorages

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59831 

would not be subject to this requirement 
but instead would be subject to 
proposed § 1926.1431(e)(6). This 
continues a requirement in proposed 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(i)(C). 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5) would 

require that welding of any part of the 
platform or its component parts be 
performed by a welder who is certified 
and familiar with the weld grades, types 
and material specified in the particular 
platform’s design. This requirement is 
designed to prevent structural failure of 
the platform due to improper welding. 

‘‘Certified welder’’ is defined in 

§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘a welder that meets the 
nationally recognized certification 
requirements that are applicable to the 
task being performed.’’ The requirement 
for a ‘‘certified’’ welder modifies the 
current requirement of Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(H), which requires a 
‘‘qualified’’ welder. It is similar to 
section 1.2.1(b)(2) of ASME B30.23– 
2005 welding standards for personnel 
platforms. The Committee believed that 
because proper platform welding is so 
critical to employee safety, it is 
necessary for the welding to be done by 
a certified welder. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(6) would 

detail the requirements of the platform 
for guardrails, fall arrest anchorage 
points and enclosure of the platform 
between the toeboard and mid-rail. 
Proper guardrails and fall arrest 
anchorage points are critical fall 
protection devices, and the required 
platform enclosure is needed to protect 
employees below from falling objects. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(6) adds to the 

current requirements of 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart N’s § 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(A) 
in specifying that ‘‘points to which 
personal fall arrest systems are attached 
must meet the anchorage requirements 
in 29 CFR part 1926 subpart M.’’ This 
is similar to the guardrail and anchorage 
specifications in sections 1.1.1(b)(2) and 
(3) of ASME B30.23–2005. This would 
update the requirements for the 
anchorage so that the same degree of 
protection currently required under 
Subpart M would be required under this 
standard. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(7) would 
require the placement of a grab rail 
within the entire perimeter of the 
personnel platform except for access 
gates/doors, where a grab rail would be 
impractical. The grab rail provides a 
place for the employee to hold onto 
while in the platform instead of using a 
guardrail as a hand hold. Use of the 
guardrail for this purpose exposes the 
employee’s hand to being smashed by 
external objects. This would modify the 
current requirement of Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(B) by clarifying that 

grab rails are not required on the access 
gates/door. It is similar to ASME 
B30.23–1.1.1(b)(4)–2005. 

Proposed paragraphs (e)(8)(i) and (ii), 
Access gates/doors, would specify that 
access gates/doors be designed to not 
swing outward and must also have a 
mechanism that will keep the gate/door 
from being opened unintentionally. A 
door that swings outward or opens 
unexpectedly puts the employee at risk 
of fall from the platform. This modifies 
the current requirements of Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(C) and (D) by 
requiring that access doors not swing 
outward at any time and expands the 
list of types of gates/doors to include 
‘‘swinging, sliding, folding, or other 
types.’’ Section 1.1.1(b)(8) of ASME 
B30.23–2005 has similar requirements 
for access gates. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(9) would 
require adequate headroom to allow 
employees to stand upright in the 
personnel platform. This would provide 
adequate space for the employee to 
work from the platform while keeping 
his/her entire body within the platform, 
and would also contribute to greater 
stability during platform movement. 
This continues the current requirement 
at § 1925.550(g)(4)(ii)(E). 

Proposed paragraph (e)(10) would 
require an overhead protective cover 
attached to the platform when an 
employee is exposed to falling objects. 
It would mandate that the overhead 
cover of the platform be of such material 
and design to provide visibility for both 
the operator and the employees on the 
platform, while maintaining adequate 
protection from falling objects. The 
reference to a wire mesh with 1⁄2 inch 
openings is an example of a type of 
material and design that could be used 
for the platform cover. The nature of the 
worksite conditions and foreseeable 
falling objects would determine the type 
of material and design to provide the 
necessary protection for the platform 
occupants. Full overhead protection 
(i.e., no visibility through the protective 
cover) would be allowed when 
conditions are such that a full protective 
cover is necessary to protect employees 
from falling objects. The visibility 
requirement is similar to section 
1.1.1(b)(11) of ASME B30.23–2005. This 
proposed paragraph would change 
current § 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(F) by 
clarifying the type of overhead 
protection that is required. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(10) explicitly 

states that the protection provided by 
the cover would be supplemental to the 
protection provided by hard hats—the 
use of hard hats would not obviate the 
requirement for the cover. While a hard 
hat provides some protection to an

employee’s head from overhead 
hazards, it does not protect the rest of 
an employee’s body from such hazards. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(11) would 

require that all edges of the platform be 
smooth enough to prevent injury. The 
purpose is to protect the employee from 
injuries such as lacerations and 
puncture wounds. A similar 
requirement is found in Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(G). 

Proposed paragraph (e)(12) would 

require conspicuously posting a plate or 
other permanent written notice on the 
personnel platform listing the weight of 
the platform itself and the platform’s 
rated load capacity. The purpose is to 
make employees aware of the platform’s 
limits to prevent overloading, which 
could result in structural failure of the 
platform or equipment, and to facilitate 
compliance with § 1926.1431(f)(1), 
which prohibits loading the platform in 
excess of its rated capacity. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(12) would 

modify the current requirement of 
Subpart N’s § 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(I) by 
deleting the phrase ‘‘or maximum 
intended load.’’ That phrase was 
included in Subpart N because 
platforms made on the worksite did not 
have a manufacturer’s rated capacity. 
However, under proposed 
§ 1926.1431(e)(1), all personnel 
platforms would be required to be 
designed by a qualified person familiar 
with structural design, and such a 
person will be able to determine the 
rated capacity for the platform. 
Paragraph 1431(f) Personnel Platform 
Loading 

Proposed paragraph (f)(1) would 

prohibit loading the platform in excess 
of its rated load capacity. Proposed 
§ 1926.1431(f)(1) differs from current 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(ii)(A) by deleting a 
provision stating that if a personnel 
platform does not have a rated load 
capacity it shall not be loaded in excess 
of its maximum intended load. The 
‘‘maximum intended load’’ provision 
was deleted for the same reason 
previously discussed under 
§ 1926.4131(e)(12). 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(i) would 

require that the platform be used 
exclusively for personnel hoisting and 
not for hoisting materials. However, it 
would allow the necessary materials 
and tools for the work activity to be 
hoisted along with the employees. Using 
a personnel platform to hoist materials 
can lead to damage of the platform due 
to materials shifting or excessive 
loading. This can subject the platform to 
structural stresses that may not be 
visible and contribute to platform 
structural failure. This would continue

the current requirement of 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(iii)(C). 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2)(ii) would 

provide an exception to (f)(2)(i) to allow 
materials and tools on the personnel 
platform during the trial lift as long as 
the materials/tools are properly secured 
and distributed as specified in 
§ 1926.1431(f)(3). Since the materials 
and tools would be secured, they would 
not damage the platform. Subpart N, at 
§ 1926.550(g)(5)(i), currently allows 
materials/tools to be on the platform 
during the trial lift but does not specify 
that they need to be properly secured 
and distributed. 

Proposed paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) 

would require that any materials and 
tools that are on the platform during the 
hoist be secured, and evenly distributed 
within the platform itself while the 
platform is suspended. These 
precautions are designed to prevent 
platform tipping and injury to 
employees due to movement of 
materials or tools during the hoist. 
These requirements would continue 
those in Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(iii)(D) & (E). 

Proposed paragraph (f)(4) would limit 
the number of employees on a personnel 
platform to the lesser of either the 
number needed to perform the work or 
the maximum number for which the 
platform was designed. The purpose is 
to expose the fewest possible number of 
employees to the hazards presented 
when hoisting personnel and to 
minimize the load on the platform to the 
extent possible. This would provide 
greater clarity than the current 
requirement of Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(iii)(B) by noting that the 
number of platform occupants is limited 
not only by work requirements but also 
the platform’s design. 
Paragraph 1431(g) Attachment and 
Rigging 

Proposed paragraph (g)(1) would 

establish the requirements for the device 
used to connect the personnel platform 
to the hoist line. It would expand and 
clarify the requirements of Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(B). 

The nature and type of connector 

used is critical to the overall safety of 
the suspended personnel platform. 
Under the proposed paragraph, a hook 
used to connect the hoist line and 
personnel platform must be the type 
that can be closed/locked and must be 
closed/locked when attached to the 
platform. When a shackle is used in lieu 
of a hook, it must be of the alloy anchor 
type with either: a bolt, nut and 
retaining pin in place; or: the screw type 
with the screw pin secured against 
accidental removal. Any detachable

device other than a shackle or hook that 
is used must be closable and lockable to 
the same extent a hook or shackle would 
be when in compliance with this 
proposed section. When used to connect 
the personnel platform, such a device 
must be closed and locked to ensure 
that the platform is secured to the hoist 
line. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(2) would 

require that each bridle leg in a rope 
bridle be connected to the master link/ 
shackle in a manner that would allow 
the platform’s load to be equally 
distributed among each bridle leg. The 
purpose of this type of attachment is to 
avoid platform tipping. The proposed 
requirement differs from current 
Subpart N at § 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(A) by 
changing the phrase ‘‘wire rope’’ to 
‘‘rope.’’ Currently, the only type of rope 
that Subpart N permits to be used for 
bridles is wire rope, and it is C–DAC’s 
and OSHA’s understanding that no 
other type of rope suitable for this 
purpose is currently available. However, 
the Committee believed that synthetic 
ropes now under development could 
someday meet the safety factor 
requirement in § 1926.1431(g)(3) and it 
did not want to preclude the potential 
use of sufficiently strong synthetic rope. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(3) would 

continue the current requirement of the 
first sentence of § 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(C) 
that all hardware used for rigging must 
be able to support five times the 
maximum intended load applied to or 
transmitted to that component. 
However, the C–DAC consensus 
document omitted the second sentence 
in current § 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(C), which 
requires slings using rotation resistant 
rope to be able to support at least ten 
times the maximum intended load. In 
promulgating § 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(C), 
OSHA arrived at the safety factor of ten 
for rotation resistant rope by doubling 
the normal design factor of five for such 
rope (see discussion of the design factor 
for rotation resistant rope above under 
§ 1926.1414, Wire rope—selection and 
installation criteria) to add an extra 
margin of safety when hoisting 
personnel. 53 FR 29116, 29122, 29132 
(Aug. 2, 1988). OSHA believes that C– 
DAC did not intend to lower the safety 
factor for rotation resistant rope used for 
personnel hoisting and inadvertently 
omitted the requirement that slings 
using rotation resistant rope to have a 
safety factor of ten. OSHA has therefore 
restored that requirement to proposed 
1926.1431(g)(3). As modified, 
1926.1431(g)(3) reads: 

(3) Rigging hardware (including wire rope, 

shackles, rings, master links, and other 
rigging hardware) and hooks must be capable 
of supporting, without failure, at least five 

times the maximum intended load applied or 
transmitted to that component. Where 
rotation resistant rope is used, the slings 
shall be capable of supporting without failure 
at least ten times the maximum intended 
load. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(4) would 

require the eyes in wire rope slings to 
be fabricated with thimbles, continuing 
the current Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(D) requirement. The 
purpose of this requirement is to 
prevent excessive wear to the eyes and 
possible failure of the platform’s rigging. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(5) would 

require that bridles and rigging used to 
suspend the personnel platform be used 
exclusively for hoisting personnel 
operations, continuing the current 
requirement of § 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(E). 
Rigging components must be dedicated 
for the sole use of personnel hoisting to 
provide maximum safety. Materials 
hoisting can lead to damage of the 
rigging components due to material 
shifting or excessive loading. This can 
make the rigging components 
susceptible to structural stress that may 
not be visible, yet contribute to 
structural failure. 
Paragraph 1431(h) Trial Lift and 
Inspection 

The proposed requirements of 

paragraphs (h)(1) through (5) generally 
continue the current requirements of 
Subpart N’s § 1926.550(g)(5)(i) through 
(v). The proposed requirements have 
been reorganized and reworded for 
clarity. Requirements for removal of the 
test weight, checking for wire rope 
deficiencies, and use of a competent 
person for trial lifts are not currently in 
29 CFR part 1926 subpart N. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(1) continues 

the requirement of § 1926.550(g)(5)(i) for 
a trial lift without occupants with the 
platform loaded to at least the 
anticipated liftweight. The purpose of 
the trial lift is to confirm that: the lift 
set-up works properly; the lift route is 
free of obstacles; the accessibility of the 
work location; no work locations will 
place the crane or derrick in such a 
configuration where the intended load 
would exceed 50 percent of the 
equipment’s rated capacity; the soil or 
other supporting surface is stable; and 
that the lift route is suitable for the 
intended lift. 

The path of the trial lift would be 

required to begin at the point the 
employees enter the platform and end at 
the ultimate location the platform is 
being hoisted to and positioned (end 
point). When there are multiple 
destination locations from a single set- 
up point, the trial lift would be required 
to be conducted in one of two ways.

59833 

First, individual lifts may be 

conducted in which the platform is 
moved to one of the end points from the 
starting point, returned to the starting 
point, moved to a second end point, 
again returned to the starting point, and 
the process repeated until each end 
point has been reached. Second, a single 
lift may be conducted from the starting 
point to all of the end points in 
sequence, without returning to the 
starting point until after the last end 
point has been reached. 

Upon reviewing § 1926.1431(h)(1) in 
the C–DAC document, OSHA believes 
that the phrase ‘‘a single trial lift for all 
locations,’’ which was taken from 
current § 1926.550(g)(5)(i), may not be 
sufficiently clear to describe the 
intended meaning. In addition, OSHA is 
concerned that allowing the trial lift to 
be conducted in either of these two 
ways, irrespective of how the personnel 
will actually be hoisted, may result in 
the trial lift failing to reveal problems 
that would be encountered in the actual 
lift. OSHA believes that the following 
language would more clearly reflect the 
intent of the provision and requests 
public comment on whether the 
language should be clarified in this 
manner: 

(h) Trial lift and inspection. 
(1) A trial lift with the unoccupied 

personnel platform loaded at least to the 
anticipated liftweight shall be made from 
ground level, or any other location where 
employees will enter the platform, to each 
location at which the platform is to be 
hoisted and positioned. Where there is more 
than one location to be reached from a single 
set-up position, either individual trial lifts for 
each location, or a single trial lift, in which 
the platform is moved sequentially to each 
location, shall be performed; the method 
selected must be the same as the method that 
will be used to hoist the personnel. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(2) would 
require that the trial lift take place 
immediately prior to each shift when 
hoisting personnel, and each time the 
equipment is moved and set up in a new 
location or a previously used location. 
Additionally, a trial lift must be done 
when the lift route is changed, unless a 
competent person determines the new 
lift route does not present new factors 
affecting safety. Similar requirements 
are found in Subpart N’s 
§ 926.550(g)(5)(i) and (ii). 

Proposed paragraph (h)(3) would 

require a competent person to ensure 
that all required safety devices and 
operational aids required by this 
proposed section are activated and 
properly functioning, that nothing 
interferes with the equipment or 
personnel platform during the trial lift, 
that the lift load does not exceed 50 
percent of the equipment’s rated

capacity, and that the load radius used 
is accurately determined. These 
requirements would ensure that 
necessary safety measures are in place 
and validated by a competent person for 
the trial lift. The proposed paragraph 
differs from the current requirements at 
§ 1926.550(g)(5)(i) as it would require a 
competent person to make the 
determination rather than the operator. 
Under sections 3.2.2(a)(9) and (a)(10) of 
ASME B30.23–2005, the operator is also 
required to determine that the trial lift 
has been conducted properly. It is 
important for this to be the 
responsibility of a competent person 
because such a person not only has the 
knowledge necessary to make the 
determinations, but also has the 
authority to take any necessary 
corrective action. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(4) would 

establish the duties of the competent 
person immediately after the trial lift. It 
would require the competent person to 
conduct a visual inspection of the 
personnel platform and equipment to 
determine if there is any problem or 
defect resulting from the trial lift or if 
it produced any adverse effect. In 
addition, the competent person must 
ensure that the test weight used during 
the trial lift has been removed prior to 
personnel loading. 

The purpose of these requirements is 

to ensure that any defects in the 
equipment, base support or ground and 
personnel platform revealed by the trial 
lift are seen by a competent person prior 
to hoisting personnel (note that, under 
proposed § 1926.1431(h)(6), any 
condition found during the trial lift that 
fails to meet a requirement of this 
proposed standard or otherwise 
constitutes a safety hazard must be 
corrected before hoisting personnel). 
Proposed paragraph (h)(4) would 
continue the current requirements of 
§ 1926.550(g)(5)(iv) while adding the 
requirement that the competent person 
ensure that the test weight is removed. 
This has been added because the 
Committee was aware of incidents in 
which overloading of the personnel 
platform occurred due to use of the 
platform to hoist personnel with the test 
weights still on board. 

Under proposed paragraph (h)(5)(i), 

immediately prior to each personnel lift, 
the competent person must inspect the 
platform while it is lifted a few inches 
to ensure that the platform is secure and 
properly balanced. 

It is the understanding of the Agency 
that the purpose of this procedure is to 
ensure that, with the occupants and 
materials/tools to be hoisted on the 
platform immediately before the hoist is 
to take place, the platform is secure and 

properly balanced. The purpose of 
having the occupants and materials/ 
tools on board during this check is 
twofold. First, it ensures that the check 
takes place just before the personnel lift, 
which minimizes the chance that 
damage or other problems affecting the 
platform’s security will occur after the 
check. In addition, it would be difficult 
to ensure that the platform will be 
properly balanced when in actual use 
without having the employees and 
materials/tools on board. 

However, while the text of this 

proposed provision implies that the 
check is to be done with the personnel 
and materials/tools on board, it does not 
specifically so state. The Agency plans 
to add language to that effect so that 
proposed § 1926.1431(h)(5)(i) would 
read as follows: 

(i) The platform shall be hoisted a few 
inches with the personnel and materials/ 
tools on board and inspected by a competent 
person to ensure that it is secure and 
properly balanced. 

The Agency requests public comment 

on such a change. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(5)(ii) would 

require a competent person to determine 
that hoist ropes are free of defects, that 
multiple part lines are not twisted 
around each other, and that the primary 
attachment is centered over the 
platform. If the load rope is slack, the 
competent person must inspect the 
hoisting system to ensure the rope lines 
are properly seated on drums and in 
sheaves. Proposed paragraphs (i) and (ii) 
continue the current requirements of 
§ 1926.550(g)(5)(iii), with the additional 
clarification that hoist ropes must be 
free of deficiencies (that is, not just free 
of ‘‘kinks,’’ as required by existing 
§ 1926.550(g)(5)(iii)(A)). The purpose of 
these requirements is to mandate an 
additional final review by a competent 
person to evaluate the personnel 
platform, the balance of the load, and 
the lifting devices to ensure that 
necessary safety requirements are met. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(6) would 

establish that any condition that fails to 
meet any requirements of this standard 
or otherwise creates a safety hazard 
must be corrected before personnel are 
hoisted. This includes such conditions 
found during the trial lift or in any 
inspection or subsequent review of the 
equipment, platform or rigging. This is 
similar to the requirement of Subpart 
N’s § 1926.550(g)(5)(v). 
Paragraph 1431(i)

[Reserved.] 

This proposed paragraph is reserved 
because it is inconvenient for readers to 
determine whether ‘‘(i)’’ is being used as 
a letter or a roman numeral.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Paragraph 1431(j) Proof Testing 

This proposed paragraph would 

delineate the requirement of and 
method for proof testing the personnel 
platform and rigging. It would require 
the proof test to be done at each jobsite 
prior to hoisting personnel and after any 
repair or modification of the platform. 
The proof test would be at 125 percent 
of the platform’s rated capacity, with an 
evenly distributed test load. The 
platform must be lowered by controlled 
load lowering, braked, and held in a 
suspended position for at least five 
minutes. After this proof test, the 
competent person must inspect the 
platform and rigging to determine if it 
has passed the proof test. If not, all 
deficiencies that pose a safety hazard 
must be corrected and another proof test 
performed. The competent person must 
determine that the platform and rigging 
have successfully passed the proof test 
before any personnel hoisting begins. 

The purpose of this proposed 
paragraph is to determine if the 
structural integrity of the personnel 
platform is intact or if it has been 
affected by any condition, damage, 
repair or modification which could 
result in structural failure or other safety 
hazards of the platform or rigging. 
Proposed paragraph § 1926.1431(j) 
contains requirements similar to those 
in Subpart N’s § 1926.550(g)(5)(vi). It 
adds the requirement in proposed 
§ 1926.1431(j)(2) that the platform be 
lowered by controlled load lowering 
and braked before being held in position 
for five minutes. This provision was 
added to ensure that the load lowering 
and braking mechanisms are 
functioning properly before personnel 
are lifted. In addition, proposed 
§ 1926.1431(j)(3) clarifies that only 
deficiencies that present a safety hazard 
need be corrected to avoid any 
implication that minor deficiencies 
bearing no relation to safety need to be 
corrected. 

The Committee discussed requiring 

the employer to document the proof test 
but determined that documentation of 
the proof test would not add to 
employee safety. 
Paragraph 1431(k) Work Practices 

Proposed paragraph (k)(1) would 

require hoisting of the personnel 
platform in a slow, controlled, cautious 
manner, with no sudden movements of 
the equipment or platform. This 
precaution would minimize the 
likelihood of platform tipping, loss of 
footing, and loss of control of the 
platform by the operator during 
hoisting. A comparable requirement is

now contained in Subpart N at 
§ 1926.550(g)(3)(i)(A). 

Proposed paragraph (k)(2)(i) would 

require that all occupants of the 
personnel platform keep all parts of the 
body inside the platform while it is 
being raised, lowered or moved 
horizontally. This would not apply 
when a platform occupant must position 
the platform. Additionally, this does not 
apply while performing the duties of a 
signal person. The purpose of this 
requirement is to prevent an employee 
from having a body part struck or caught 
in between the personnel platform and 
another object. This differs from the 
current requirement of Subpart N at 
§ 1926.550(g)(6)(i) by providing an 
exception for a platform occupant 
positioning the platform. The 
Committee believed that such 
positioning can be important to safety, 
and therefore an exception in this regard 
would be appropriate. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(2)(ii) would 

add a new provision by prohibiting 
platform occupants from standing on, 
sitting on, or working from any surface 
other than the floor of the personnel 
platform during hoisting or when 
working from the platform. It would 
prohibit working from a railing or 
toeboard or the use of any means or 
device to raise the employee’s working 
height. The purpose is to ensure that the 
occupants receive the protections of the 
guardrail system and do not destabilize 
the platform. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(2)(iii) would 

add a new provision by prohibiting 
platform occupants from pulling the 
platform out of plumb in relation to the 
hoisting equipment. The purpose is to 
prevent tipping of the platform with 
employees on board, which could 
exacerbate the fall hazard. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(3) would 

require a personnel platform that is not 
landed to be secured to the structure 
before employees enter or exit the 
platform. It would allow an exception 
when a greater hazard would be created 
by securing the platform to the 
structure. The purpose is to provide a 
stable surface to prevent loss of footing 
when entering or exiting the platform. 
This provision is similar to Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(6)(ii) but replaces the 
words ‘‘unsafe condition’’ with ‘‘greater 
hazard’’ to clarify that the exception 
only comes into play when the hazard 
that would be created by securing the 
platform to the structure is greater than 
would exist if it were not secured. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(4) would add 

a new requirement that the operator 
receive confirmation that the platform is 
no longer tied to the structure and is 
freely suspended before the operator 

moves the platform. This requirement 
would prevent structural damage to the 
platform and/or rigging and prevent the 
fall hazard that could result from 
pulling the platform out of plumb if 
there is an attempt to move it while it 
is still attached. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(5) would 

require the use of tag lines when 
necessary to control the personnel 
platform. The purpose is to provide an 
additional way to control platform 
stability to decrease the risk of injury 
from loss of footing or from the platform 
striking an object. This would modify 
the current requirement of Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(6)(iii), which requires the 
use of tag lines unless their use would 
create an unsafe condition. The 
Committee believed it is not always 
necessary to use tag lines even when 
their use would not create an unsafe 
condition and was of the view that this 
change would not decrease safety. 

Under proposed paragraph (k)(6), 

where the platform is not equipped with 
controls, the equipment operator would 
be required to remain at the equipment 
controls at all times while the personnel 
platform is occupied. Since there are no 
controls in the personnel platform, the 
equipment operator must be available to 
make any necessary adjustments to 
protect the employees from injury from 
any condition arising after the platform 
is placed at the working location. 
Subpart N at § 1926.550(g)(6)(iv) 
currently contains a similar requirement 
but requires the operator to remain at 
the controls ‘‘when the crane engine is 
running and the platform is occupied.’’ 
Proposed § 1926.1431(k)(6) specifies 
that the operator must stay at the 
controls at all times the platform is 
occupied, whether or not the crane 
engine is running. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(7), Platforms 
with controls, and its subsections apply 
when a personnel platform has controls. 
At present, platforms being 
manufactured with controls are boom- 
tip mounted platforms. Controls on 
certain personnel platforms enable a 
platform occupant to articulate both the 
platform and the boom. Other platform 
designs enable an occupant to control 
only the platform/basket itself, for 
example to level the basket as it is 
boomed up or down. Currently, Subpart 
N of this part does not distinguish 
between platforms with controls and 
platforms without controls, so the 
requirement of § 1926.550(g)(6)(iv) that 
the operator remain at the equipment 
controls when the engine is running and 
the platform is occupied applies to both 
types of platform. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(7)(i) would 

require the platform occupant using the

platform’s controls to be a qualified 
person with respect to their use, 
including the safe limitations of the 
equipment and hazards associated with 
its operation. Such knowledge and skill 
is essential for the safety of the platform 
occupants and employees in the 
surrounding area. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(7)(ii) would 

require the equipment operator to be 
either at the equipment controls, in the 
personnel platform, or onsite in view of 
the equipment. It is OSHA’s 
understanding that the purpose of this 
proposed provision is to require the 
equipment operator to be available to 
take action if necessary, such as where 
there is unexpected or inadvertent 
platform or equipment movement, a 
sudden change in wind conditions, or 
an injury to a platform occupant. 

It is also OSHA’s understanding that 
C–DAC intended this provision to give 
employers the flexibility to position the 
operator where he or she is needed in 
certain common situations. For 
example, if the controls on the platform 
are designed to control both the 
platform and the boom, the operator 
could be the qualified person on the 
platform who operates the controls. If 
the controls allow only limited control 
of the platform itself, the operator will 
be needed at the equipment controls, as 
under proposed § 1926.1431(k)(6). The 
Agency also believes that C–DAC 
intended the option of having the 
operator onsite and in view of the 
equipment to accommodate radio- 
controlled operations, in which the 
operator controls the equipment from a 
position off the equipment but within 
its line of sight. 

Upon reviewing proposed paragraph 

(k)(7)(ii), OSHA is concerned that the 
proposed provision would not operate 
in this manner. Specifically, it would 
not limit the employer’s choices to 
situations where they are suitable. For 
example, under the provision as written, 
the operator could be on the platform 
even if the controls on the platform 
allow only limited control of the 
platform, and the operator would 
therefore not be available at the 
equipment controls to move the boom 
when it is necessary to do so. OSHA 
requests public comment on whether it 
is necessary to reword proposed 
§ 1926.1431(k)(7)(ii) to clarify the 
circumstances under which employers 
can use the three options for positioning 
the equipment operator and, if so, how 
the provision should be worded to 
achieve that goal. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(7)(iii) would 
require the platform operating manual 
to be on the platform or on the 
equipment while the platform is

occupied. The purpose is to have ready 
access to manufacturer’s operating 
information when employees are on the 
platform. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(8)(i), 

Environmental conditions—Wind, 
would require a qualified person to 
determine if it is unsafe to hoist 
personnel when the wind speed (gust or 
sustained) exceeds 20 mph. High winds 
increase the likelihood of platform 
tipping, sudden unexpected movement 
of the platform, or structural failure of 
the equipment. If the qualified person 
determines that hoisting personnel is 
unsafe, hoisting operations must not 
begin or, if already in progress, must be 
terminated. 

Subpart N at § 1926.550(g)(6)(v) 

currently requires personnel hoisting 
operations to stop when there is 
indication of any dangerous weather 
conditions or other impending danger. 
The Committee believed that it was 
necessary to establish a clearer 
guideline with respect to hoisting 
personnel under windy conditions. C– 
DAC discussed setting a particular wind 
speed at which hoisting personnel 
would be prohibited (it considered, for 
example, that section 3.2.1(e) of ASME 
B30.23–2005 prohibits personnel 
hoisting operations when wind speed 
exceeds 20 mph). It determined that the 
number of variables involved at each 
site precludes establishing a single wind 
speed threshold at which, in each 
instance, it could be said that hoisting 
personnel is not safe. It did, however, 
determine that 20 mph is an appropriate 
point at which a determination, in all 
cases, needs to be made. Therefore, it 
found that it was appropriate to have 
the qualified person evaluate all 
relevant factors in order to determine if 
conditions are such that hoisting 
personnel with wind speed over 20 mph 
is unsafe. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(8)(ii), 

Environmental conditions—Other 
weather and environmental conditions, 
would require a qualified person to 
determine if it is not safe to hoist 
personnel when there are indications of 
dangerous weather or any other 
impending/existing dangerous 
environmental condition. Upon 
determination that it is unsafe, 
personnel hoisting operations must not 
be started or must be terminated if 
already in progress. 

The purpose of this paragraph is to 

require evaluation of all environmental 
conditions, including weather, by a 
qualified person, to determine if the 
conditions make it unsafe to hoist 
personnel. Dangerous conditions, such 
as those presented by severe weather, 
may contribute to the hazards of 

platform tipping, unexpected platform 
movement, dropping the platform, or 
structural failure of the platform or 
equipment. Examples of non-weather 
environmental dangers would be a 
neighboring fire that threatens the area 
of the crane operations or a chemical 
release from a neighboring 
manufacturing facility that threatens to 
drift into the area. Section 3.2.1(c) of 
ASME B30.23–2005 lists electric storms, 
snow, ice, sleet, or other adverse 
weather conditions that could affect the 
safety of personnel as reasons for 
suspending operations. Rather than 
listing specific dangers or events, C– 
DAC believed that the determination of 
whether conditions were dangerous was 
best left to the assessment of the 
qualified person. 

As noted above, § 1926.550(g)(6)(v) 
requires personnel hoisting operations 
to stop when there is indication of any 
dangerous weather conditions or other 
impending danger. The proposed 
paragraph continues that requirement; 
however, it adds the requirement that a 
qualified person must make the 
determination. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(9) would 
require employees being hoisted to 
remain in direct communication with 
either the signal person (where used) or 
equipment operator at all times. In some 
instances the platform occupants are in 
a better position to see potential 
problems developing than the operator, 
or to recognize that there is some other 
safety-related need for the operator to 
take action. In addition, there are 
instances when the operator becomes 
aware of a developing problem and 
needs to communicate that to the 
employees being hoisted. This provision 
would ensure that such information can 
be communicated quickly between the 
hoisted employees and operator. 

Currently, Subpart N’s 

§ 1926.550(g)(6)(vi) requires hoisted 
employees to remain in continuous 
sight of and in direct communication 
with the operator or signal person. 
Reliance on direct communication alone 
(such as by radio) is only permitted 
when visual contact with the operator is 
not possible and the use of a signal 
person (to relay information by hand 
signals) would create a greater hazard. 
The Committee believed that direct 
communication, either with a signal 
person (when used) or with the 
operator, is an effective way for the 
hoisted employees to communicate with 
the operator and that 
§ 1926.550(g)(6)(vi)’s preference for 
visual contact does not add to safety. 
Accordingly, proposed § 1926.1431(k)(9) 
would allow direct communication with

a signal person or the operator in all 
instances. 

Proposed paragraphs (k)(10)(i) and 

(ii), Fall protection, would require 
employees on the personnel platform to 
be provided with and use a personal fall 
arrest system attached to a structural 
member within the personnel platform. 
The fall arrest system (including the 
attachment point) must comply with 
§ 1926.502, Fall protection systems 
criteria and practices. When hoisting 
personnel over water, a personal fall 
arrest system would not be required 
since, in the event that an error or 
failure occurred that resulted in the 
employees being in the water, being 
tied-off would exacerbate the drowning 
hazard. However, the requirements of 
§ 1926.106, Working over or near water, 
would apply. 

The purpose of this requirement is to 

protect employees from a fall hazard 
while in the personnel platform in the 
event of sudden movement, tipping, or 
other circumstance in which a fall 
would not be prevented by the 
platform’s guardrail system. This is 
similar to the requirements of Subpart 
N’s § 1926.550(g)(6)(vii). However, it 
replaces use of a ‘‘body belt/harness 
system with lanyard’’ with ‘‘personal 
fall arrest system’’ to reflect current 
technology, terminology and practice for 
personal fall protection and to be 
consistent with 29 CFR part 1926 
subpart M’s personal fall arrest system 
requirements. Additionally, the 
Committee determined that the 
requirement in the current standard to 
attach a personal fall arrest system to 
the ‘‘lower load block or overhaul ball’’ 
was no longer considered good industry 
practice and, instead, an employee 
needs to be tied off to ‘‘a structural 
member within the personnel platform.’’ 
Tying off to the lower load block or 
overhaul ball places the employee at 
risk of being pulled through the top of 
the personnel platform and into the 
rigging attached to the personnel 
platform. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(11)(i), Other 
load lines, would mandate that while 
hoisting personnel no other lifts may be 
made with any of the equipment’s other 
load lines. This proposed provision has 
several purposes. First, it would prevent 
platform tipping due to entanglement 
with other load lines or loads. Second, 
it would reduce the chance that the 
equipment would be overloaded. Third, 
when hoisting personnel, it is essential 
that the operator’s full attention be 
devoted to the personnel; use of another 
load line would necessarily divert his/ 
her attention. This is comparable to the 
requirement of Subpart N’s 
§ 1926.550(g)(6)(viii), with the addition

of an exception for pile driving 
equipment. In pile driving operations, 
personnel have to be hoisted at times as 
part of the pile driving operation while 
the pile driving apparatus is being 
suspended on another load line. 

In reviewing this aspect of the C–DAC 
document, the Agency noted that under 
the C–DAC language, the provision 
would have applied only when 
personnel were ‘‘suspended on a 
platform.’’ Since there are specified 
exceptions to the proposed requirement 
to use a personnel platform, there will 
be specific instances where personnel 
will be hoisted without a platform. The 
Agency believes that it is equally 
important to safety that the prohibition 
against using any other load lines apply 
in these instances (with the exception of 
pile driving operations, in which it is 
not feasible to use only one load line), 
and that this was a textual oversight by 
the Committee. Therefore, OSHA has 
modified the C–DAC language of this 
provision so that the prohibition would 
apply ‘‘while personnel are being 
hoisted. * * *’’ OSHA requests 
comment on this change. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(11)(ii), Other 

load lines, would allow the use of a 
winch line while hoisting personnel 
when all of the following factors are 
present: the personnel platform is a 
factory-produced boom-mounted 
personnel platform incorporating a 
winch as original equipment, the load 
on the winch line does not exceed 500 
pounds, and the load on the winch line 
itself does not exceed the rated capacity 
of the winch and platform. The 
Committee believed that, when all of 
these factors are present, there is little 
chance that the use of the winch line 
would compromise safety. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(12)(i), 

Traveling—equipment other than 
derricks, would prohibit any traveling 
by equipment with hoisted employees 
except in two circumstances. The first is 
where the equipment is traveling on 
fixed rails. The second is where the 
employer demonstrates that there is no 
less hazardous way to perform the work 
than by traveling. However, this second 
exception does not apply to rubber-tired 
equipment, for which traveling is 
always prohibited. Traveling with 
hoisted employees is also always 
prohibited for derricks, as set forth 
under proposed § 1926.1431(k)(13), 
discussed below. 

Traveling while hoisting personnel is 

generally prohibited due to several 
additional risks that it presents. The 
platform will tend to swing when the 
equipment is traveling, which presents 
an increased likelihood of employee 
injury from platform tipping or loss of 

footing. If the swing is pronounced, the 
equipment could become unbalanced 
and its capacity exceeded. Also, the 
chance of an unplanned circumstance or 
event increases when the equipment 
travels, which heightens the risk to the 
employees being hoisted. Therefore, the 
exception to this prohibition is narrowly 
drawn. 

Traveling would be permitted with 

equipment that travels on fixed rails, as 
travel on fixed rails is relatively stable 
and predictable, which reduces the 
chance of significant uncontrolled 
movement. Traveling may be done with 
equipment that is not on fixed rails and 
not rubber-tired, but only where the 
employer can demonstrate that there is 
no less hazardous way to perform the 
work. 

However, traveling would be 

prohibited with rubber-tired equipment. 
The Committee was of the view that 
traveling with such equipment while 
hoisting personnel is inherently 
dangerous due to the bouncing and 
swaying of the equipment that is 
inherent in this type of equipment 
because of the tires and suspension. 

The current requirements of Subpart 

N at § 1926.550(g)(7)(i), prohibit 
hoisting employees while a crane is 
traveling ‘‘except for portal, tower or 
locomotive cranes, or where the 
employer demonstrates that there is no 
less hazardous way to perform the 
work.’’ The proposed paragraph would 
have a clearer restriction on equipment 
traveling by establishing a complete 
prohibition on traveling while hoisting 
employees for any rubber-tired 
equipment. Instead of referring to 
particular types of cranes, the proposed 
paragraph allows for hoisting personnel 
by equipment that travels on fixed rails, 
which more directly relates to what 
makes the use of such equipment 
acceptable for this purpose. The 
proposed paragraph still allows for 
hoisting personnel if there is no less 
hazardous means to do the work, but 
this exception does not apply to rubber- 
tired equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(12)(ii), 
Traveling—equipment other than 
derricks, would establish certain criteria 
that would have to be met when 
traveling with employees is allowed. 
The purpose of this proposed paragraph 
is to establish the conditions necessary 
to minimize the effect of traveling on 
the stability of the equipment and 
personnel. In order to hoist employees 
while traveling, the following would be 
required: travel restricted to a fixed 
track or runway; distance of travel 
limited to the length of the boom, 
including any attached jib; the boom 
parallel to the direction of travel (unless

it is safer otherwise); and a complete 
trial run performed to test the travel 
route before employees occupy the 
platform. 

In proposed § 1926.1401, a ‘‘runway’’ 

is defined as a firm level surface 
designed, prepared and designated as a 
path of travel for the weight and 
configuration of the equipment being 
used to lift and travel with the 
personnel platform, including an 
existing surface. For the purposes of this 
proposed paragraph, OSHA believes it is 
necessary to clearly define what 
constitutes a runway since its purpose 
differs, for example, from a runway on 
a gantry crane. The function of the 
runway required by this proposed 
paragraph would be to provide a stable 
surface for equipment during travel to 
minimize unexpected movement. This 
definition is included to remain 
consistent with the term, without 
change, as it is used in Subpart N of 29 
CFR part 1926. The required trial run 
may be done at the same time as the trial 
lift testing the lift route (see proposed 
paragraph (h)). 

This continues the requirements of 
Subpart N’s § 1926.550(g)(7)(ii) with 
three exceptions. Currently, ‘‘the boom 
must be parallel to the direction of 
travel’’; the proposed paragraph allows 
an exception when it is safer to travel 
with the boom not parallel to the 
direction of travel. For example, if the 
work was being done to the side of the 
crane, and booming to parallel would 
take the personnel platform closer to a 
power line, and the manufacturer 
permits the crane to travel with the 
boom to the side, it would be safer to 
travel with the boom to the side in this 
instance. Next, the Committee 
determined that the current travel limit 
of ‘‘the load radius of the boom’’ was 
confusing terminology and found that a 
clearer and equally safe restriction 
would be to limit the distance of travel 
to the ‘‘boom length.’’ Finally, as 
discussed above, the proposed 
paragraph would prohibit all traveling 
while hoisting personnel with rubber- 
tired equipment. The current standard 
(§ 1926.550(g)(7)(ii)(E)) in effect allows 
use of rubber-tired equipment in limited 
conditions. 

Proposed paragraph (k)(13), 

Traveling—derricks, would prohibit a 
derrick from traveling while it is 
hoisting personnel. The current 
requirements of Subpart N that address 
traveling refer only to cranes. C–DAC 
believed that the intent of Subpart N 
was to prohibit derricks from traveling 
with hoisted employees and decided it 
was necessary to note this exclusion to 
eliminate any ambiguity. Hoisting 
employees on a traveling derrick is 

dangerous because derricks are not 
sufficiently stable when traveling. This 
proposed paragraph reflects the current 
industry practice as reflected in section 
3.3.4(a)(14) of ASME B30.6–2003, 
‘‘Derricks.’’ 
Paragraph 1431(l)

[Reserved.] 

This proposed paragraph is reserved 
because it is inconvenient for readers to 
distinguish the letter ‘‘l’’ from the 
number ‘‘1.’’ 
Paragraph 1431(m) Pre-Lift Meeting 

This proposed paragraph would 

require a meeting prior to the trial lift 
at each new work location to review the 
requirements of this section and the 
procedures to be followed when 
hoisting personnel. The pre-lift meeting 
would be attended by the equipment 
operator, signal person (when one is 
used for the lift), employees to be 
hoisted, and the person responsible for 
the task to be performed. 

Also, this paragraph would require 
this meeting to be repeated when an 
employee is newly assigned to the 
operation. The purpose of this 
requirement is to make all employees 
involved in the personnel hoisting 
operation aware of the requirements of 
this section and the plan for the 
personnel lift. This would provide an 
opportunity for all employees involved 
to have a common and complete 
understanding of the hoisting operation 
and to give uniform information and 
instructions immediately prior to the 
lift. This would address hazards which 
could result from misunderstanding of 
the requirements, particular lift 
conditions or procedures. 

The provisions of proposed paragraph 
(m) are comparable to the requirements 
of § 1926.550(g)(8). 
Paragraph 1431(n) Hoisting Personnel 
Near Power Lines 

This proposed paragraph would 

prohibit hoisting personnel within 20 
feet of a power line 350 kV and below 
or within 50 feet of a power line over 
350 kV, except for work that is covered 
by 29 CFR part 1926 Subpart V, Power 
Transmission and Distribution.  

The purpose of this requirement is to 
establish a safe clearance distance from 
power lines to protect employees from 
an electrocution hazard that would 
result if the personnel, a personnel 
platform, or equipment made electrical 
contact with a power line. The clearance 
distances are similar to those in 
proposed § 1926.1407 and § 1926.1408 
for equipment operating near power 
lines. However, under § 1926.1407 and 
§ 1926.1408, clearances less than 20 and 
50 feet are permitted for certain voltage 

ranges. Here, the Committee believed 
that the extra risk that arises when 
personnel are hoisted near a power line 
justifies the requirement to maintain the 
minimum distances of 20 feet for lines 
350 kV or less and 50 feet for lines over 
350 kV regardless of whether operations 
at closer distances without hoisting 
personnel would be permitted. 

Currently, Subpart N at § 1926.550 

has no specific requirement for hoisting 
personnel near power lines, and the 
normal minimum distances established 
by that standard apply. 
Paragraph 1431(o) Hoisting Personnel 
in Drill Shafts 

This proposed paragraph would 

provide requirements when hoisting 
personnel in drill shafts that are 8 feet 
and smaller in diameter. C–DAC noted 
that drill shafts of this size may be 
either too small to use a personnel 
platform, or that use of a personnel 
platform might not allow the room 
needed to perform the necessary work. 
As a result, the Committee determined 
that, due to the limitations of a drill 
shaft of this size, use of a personnel 
platform would typically be infeasible 
and a boatswain’s chair may be the only 
practical means of hoisting personnel 
and performing the necessary work. 
‘‘Boatswain’s chair’’ is defined in 

§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘a single-point 
adjustable suspension scaffold 
consisting of a seat or sling (which may 
be incorporated into a full body harness) 
designed to support one employee in a 
sitting position.’’ Except for the 
parenthetical, this definition is identical 
to that in OSHA’s construction 
scaffolding standard, § 1926.450(b). The 
parenthetical has been added to clarify 
that a boatswain’s chair in which the 
seat or sling is incorporated into a full 
body harness complies with the 
standard. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(1) would 

allow the employer to use either a 
personnel platform or a boatswain’s 
chair; the employer would have the 
option of choosing which one to use.73 
When the employer elects to use a 
boatswain’s chair in lieu of a personnel 
platform, particular supplementary 

73 Note that, under proposed § 1926.1431(a), an 

employer may only use equipment to hoist 
personnel when other means of reaching the work 
area would present a greater hazard or would not 
be possible because of the project’s structural 
design or worksite conditions. C–DAC provided, in 
paragraphs (o)(2) and (o)(3)(i), that paragraph (a) 
applies to the use of either a personnel platform or 
a boatswain’s chair. Therefore, before using either 
means to hoist personnel in drill shafts, the 
employer would need to determine that hoisting 
personnel in lieu of using other means of access to 
the work area is the least hazardous, or the only, 
means to gain access to the work area.

requirements in proposed paragraph 
(o)(3) would have to be met. These 
particular requirements address the 
heightened danger that the employee 
may fall from the chair or contact the 
wall of the drill shaft. Subpart N does 
not have requirements that specifically 
address hoisting personnel in drill 
shafts. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(1) would 
require that the employer use either a 
personnel platform or boatswain’s chair. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(2) would 

require the employer to follow 
requirements (a) through (n) of 
§ 1926.1431 when using a personnel 
platform to hoist employees. This would 
make clear that the provisions in 
proposed paragraph (o) are 
supplementary requirements. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3) would 
establish the requirements when the 
employer elects to use a boatswain’s 
chair in lieu of a personnel platform for 
hoisting personnel. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(i) would 

establish which of the previous 
proposed paragraphs in § 1926.1431 
would continue to apply when using a 
boatswain’s chair. For these applicable 
paragraphs, the reader would substitute 
the phrase ‘‘boatswain’s chair’’ for either 
‘‘personnel platform’’ or ‘‘platform,’’ 
and the employer must comply with 
these requirements. 

The proposed paragraphs omitted 

from proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(i) 
would not apply when a boatswain’s 
chair is used. This is because the 
requirement is either specifically 
applicable to personnel platform design 
and use, or generally not applicable 
when hoisting personnel in a drill shaft. 
Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(ii) would 
require a signal person to be stationed 
at the opening of the shaft during 
personnel hoisting. The purpose is to 
have the signal person at the best 
position to watch the employee being 
hoisted and signal the equipment 
operator, since the employee would be 
out of visual range of the operator. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(iii) would 
require the employee to be hoisted in a 
slow, controlled descent and ascent. 
This is to limit swinging or sudden 
movement of the boatswain’s chair to 
prevent fall from the chair or impact 
with the walls of the drill shaft. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(iv) would 
require the employee in the boatswain’s 
chair to use personal fall arrest 
equipment, including a full body 
harness, that is attached independent of 
the crane/derrick. The purpose of 
requiring a tie off point independent of 
the equipment is to protect the 
employee from a sudden drop or fall 
due to equipment failure or other 

problem associated with the operation 
of the crane/derrick and to protect the 
employee from falls when accessing and 
egressing the boatswain’s chair. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(v) would 

require fall protection equipment to 
comply with § 1926.502, Fall Protection 
Systems Criteria and Practices.  

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(vi) would 
require the boatswain’s chair (excluding 
the personal fall arrest anchorages) to be 
capable of supporting, without failure, 
its own weight plus a minimum of five 
times the maximum intended load. This 
is similar to the requirement for 
personnel platforms at proposed 
§ 1926.1431(e)(4). The strength 
requirement that would be applicable to 
personal fall arrest anchorages is in 
§ 1926.502(d)(15). 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(vii) would 
mandate that only one person be hoisted 
at a time when using a boatswain’s 
chair. The Committee believed that 
hoisting more than one person using a 
boatswain’s chair in a drill shaft would 
present unacceptable additional hazards 
for the employees being hoisted. 
Paragraph 1431(p) Hoisting Personnel 
for Pile Driving Operations 

This proposed paragraph would 
provide requirements for hoisting 
personnel in pile driving operations. 
Subpart N does not have provisions that 
specifically address hoisting personnel 
in pile driving operations. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(1) would 
require that the employer use either a 
personnel platform or boatswain’s chair 
when hoisting personnel in pile driving 
operations. As with drill shafts, C–DAC 
believed that use of a personnel 
platform would often be infeasible in 
this type of operation, and 
§ 1926.1431(p)(1) therefore gives the 
employer the option of choosing which 
one to use. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(2) would 
require the cable being used to hoist 
personnel to be clearly marked at the 
point on the cable that would allow the 
equipment operator the opportunity to 
stop the hoist to prevent two-blocking. 
In the C–DAC document an alternative 
to marking the cable would have been 
permitted: use of a spotter to observe the 
lift and alert the equipment operator in 
time to prevent two-blocking. An anti- 
two-blocking device would not be 
required for equipment during pile 
driving operations since the vibration of 
the pile driver would destroy this 
device. (See § 1926.1431(d)(4)(iv), Anti- 
two-block). 

In reviewing this portion of the C– 

DAC document, the Agency has noted 
that the means of preventing two- 
blocking in the C–DAC language, that is,

to mark the cable or use a spotter, is 
consistent with the temporary 
alternative measure for an anti two- 
block device specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d)(3)(ii)(D) for lattice boom 
cranes. However, as indicated in 
proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3)(i), marking 
the cable is not sufficient for telescopic 
boom cranes when extending the boom. 
As discussed above in the context of 
that proposed provision, when 
extending a telescopic boom, a spotter is 
needed to warn against two-blocking. 

The Agency believes that the 

Committee developed its language for 
preventing two-blocking when pile 
driving with only lattice boom cranes in 
mind, since that is the type of 
equipment that is commonly used for 
this work. However, as technology and 
construction practices evolve, telescopic 
boom cranes may be used for this work 
as well. Therefore, the Agency has 
modified the C–DAC language so that 
proposed § 1926.1431(p)(2) would 
require that, when using a telescopic 
boom crane for pile driving operations, 
a spotter must be used in addition to 
marking the cable. The Agency requests 
public comment on this issue. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(3) would 

require the employer to follow 
requirements (b) through (n) of 
§ 1926.1431 when using a personnel 
platform to hoist employees. Section 
1926.1431(a) would not apply because 
the Committee determined that the 
employer should not be required to 
demonstrate that the other means of 
access listed in § 1926.1431(a) are 
infeasible before being able to use a 
personnel platform to hoist personnel 
during pile driving operations. C–DAC 
believed that demonstrating infeasibility 
prior to using a personnel platform 
should not be required because, in most 
instances, it is not feasible to use other 
means of access. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(4) would 
establish the requirements when the 
employer elects to use a boatswain’s 
chair in lieu of a personnel platform for 
hoisting personnel. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(4)(i) would 

establish which of the previous 
paragraphs in § 1926.1431 continue to 
apply when using a boatswain’s chair in 
a pile driving operation. For these 
applicable paragraphs, the reader would 
substitute the phrase ‘‘boatswain’s 
chair’’ for either ‘‘personnel platform’’ 
or ‘‘platform’’ and the employer must 
comply with these requirements. 

The proposed paragraphs omitted 

from proposed § 1926.1431(p)(3)(i) do 
not apply when a boatswain’s chair is 
used because the requirement is either

platform design and use or generally not 
applicable for pile driving operations. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(4)(ii) would 
require the employee to be hoisted in a 
slow, controlled descent and ascent. 
This is to limit swinging or sudden 
movement of the boatswain’s chair to 
prevent a fall from the chair or impact 
with equipment or other structures. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(4)(iii) would 

require that the employee in the 
boatswain’s chair use personal fall arrest 
equipment, including a full body 
harness. The fall arrest system must be 
attached to either the lower load block 
or the overhaul ball. The purpose of 
having the fall protection equipment 
and tie off point independent of the 
boatswain’s chair and rigging used to 
hoist the employee is twofold. It would 
both protect the employee from a 
sudden drop or fall due to failure of that 
equipment and protect the employee 
when accessing and egressing the 
boatswain’s chair. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(p)(4)(iv) would 

require fall protection equipment to 
comply with § 1926.502, Fall protection 
systems criteria and practices. This 
would ensure that the fall equipment is 
sufficient to safely arrest the employee’s 
fall. 

In reviewing this portion of the C– 

DAC document, the Agency has noted 
that the Committee did not include a 
provision similar to proposed 
§ 1926.1431(o)(3)(vi)(drill shafts) and 
§ 1926.1431(s)(3)(v)(storage tanks) to 
require a minimum strength for the 
boatswain’s chair. In addition, it did not 
include a provision similar to proposed 
§ 1926.1431(o)(3)(vii)(drill shafts) and 
§ 1926.1431(s)(3)(vi)(storage tanks) to 
restrict hoisting to one person at a time. 
Accordingly, the Agency is planning to 
add the following provisions to 
proposed § 1926.1431(p)(4) and requests 
public comment on these additions. 

(v) The boatswain’s chair itself (excluding 
the personal fall arrest system anchorages), 
shall be capable of supporting, without 
failure, its own weight and at least five times 
the maximum intended load. 

(vi) No more than one person shall be 

hoisted at a time.

the particular hazards and requirements 
of marine personnel transfer. This 
proposed paragraph would apply only 
when hoisting employees solely for 
such transfer. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(r)(1) would 
require the employer to use either a 
traditional personnel platform or a 
marine hoisted personnel transfer 
device. This proposed paragraph would 
allow an employer to use a marine 
hoisted personnel transfer device 
instead of a personnel platform for 
several reasons. Transferring personnel 
to or from a marine construction site 
poses special problems due to the 
effects of waves and gusting wind. 
These effects, which can be 
unpredictable, can result in a situation 
where the equipment operator will not 
be able to adequately control the 
equipment. In such a situation, the 
device used to transfer the employees 
may suddenly wind up in the water. 
Another possibility is that the 
employees may need to jump off into 
the water to avoid a collision with the 
ship or an object on the construction 
site. A third possibility is that the 
operator will be unable to control the 
equipment while the employees are 
attempting to board or disembark. The 
longer it takes to get on or off, the 
greater this risk becomes. In all of these 
scenarios the employees need to be able 
to either enter or exit the device being 
used to transfer them quickly and easily. 

A personnel platform, which is 

designed, in part, to keep the employees 
inside, would, in most marine 
situations, compound the hazard faced 
by the employees, since they can be 
difficult to enter and exit quickly. For 
example, there is usually a gate that 
latches shut. Also, the gate may prevent 
more than one employee from entering 
or exiting at a time. In contrast, a marine 
hoisted personnel transfer device is 
designed specifically to facilitate the 
employees’ rapid entry and exit. The 
Committee believed that the employer 
should have the option of using such a 
device so that it may be used where, in 
the judgment of the employer, the 
conditions are such that the risk of 
being prevented from entering or exiting 
quickly is greater than the risk of 
unintentionally falling off. 

OSHA notes that proposed 

§ 1926.1431(r)(1) would give employers 
an unrestricted choice of whether to use 
a personnel platform or a marine 
hoisted personnel transfer device 
despite the fact that the personnel 
platform would often be a less safe 
choice. OSHA requests public comment 
on whether the employer should be 
required to select the device used for 
marine transfer on the basis of which is 

safer under the circumstances or should 
otherwise restrict the use of personnel 
platforms for marine transfer. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(r)(2) would 

require the employer to follow 
requirements (a) through (n) of 
§ 1926.1431 when using a personnel 
platform to hoist employees. As 
discussed previously, these provisions 
are designed to ensure that hoisting 
personnel is the safest means of moving 
the employees and that the personnel 
platform’s design and use are adequate 
from a safety standpoint. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(r)(3) would 
establish the requirements when the 
employer elects to use a marine hoisted 
personnel transfer device in lieu of a 
personnel platform for hoisting 
personnel. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(r)(3)(i) would 

establish which of the previous 
paragraphs in § 1926.1431 continue to 
apply when using a marine hoisted 
personnel transfer device. For these 
applicable paragraphs, the reader would 
substitute the phrase ‘‘marine hoisted 
personnel transfer device’’ for either 
‘‘personnel platform’’ or ‘‘platform’’ and 
the employer must comply with these 
requirements. 

The paragraphs omitted from 

proposed § 1926.1431(r)(3)(i) do not 
apply when a marine hoisted personnel 
transfer device is used. This is because 
the requirement is either specifically 
applicable to personnel platform design 
and use or generally not applicable 
when hoisting personnel at a marine 
worksite. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(r)(3)(ii) would 

require the marine hoisted personnel 
transfer device to be used exclusively 
for transferring employees. One purpose 
of this proposed provision is to not 
allow the device to be used as a work 
platform. The device’s design, which 
specifically facilitates easy and rapid 
entry and exit, is ill-suited to providing 
a safe work platform. In particular, it is 
not designed to prevent falling while an 
employee uses his or her hands for 
working rather than holding on to the 
device. Also, it is ill-suited as a material 
transfer device because it is not 
designed to prevent materials from 
falling from it and could be damaged by 
such use. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(r)(3)(iii) would 

limit the number of employees on the 
marine hoisted personnel transfer 
device to the maximum number the 
device was designed to hold. This 
would prevent overloading, which 
could result in structural failure of the 
device. It would also prevent 
overcrowding, which could cause an 
unintended fall or preclude a worker

from entering or exiting as rapidly as 
when used properly. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(o)(3)(iv) would 
require each employee being transferred 
on a marine hoisted personnel transfer 
device to wear a U.S. Coast Guard 
personal flotation device that is 
approved for industrial use. The 
purpose is to protect the employee from 
drowning if the device enters the water, 
or if the employee falls or needs to jump 
into the water. 
Paragraph 1431(s) Hoisting Personnel 
for Storage Tank (Steel or Concrete), 
Shaft and Chimney Operations 

This proposed paragraph would 

establish requirements when hoisting 
personnel in storage tank (steel or 
concrete), shaft operations and chimney 
operations. C–DAC determined that use 
of a personnel platform, while usually 
feasible, is infeasible in some 
circumstances involving these 
operations due to the nature of the work 
activity. Consequently, the Committee 
determined that boatswain’s chairs 
should be allowed instead of a 
personnel platform in such instances, 
but only when the employer can 
demonstrate that use of a personnel 
platform is infeasible.74 For these 
reasons, proposed § 1926.1431(s)(1) 
would allow the employer to use a 
boatswain’s chair only when the 
employer has determined that use of a 
personnel platform is infeasible. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(2) would 

require the employer to follow 
requirements (a) through (n) of 
§ 1926.1431 when using a personnel 
platform to hoist employees. Under 
proposed § 1926.1431(a), an employer 
may only use equipment to hoist 
personnel when other means of reaching 
the work area would present a greater 
hazard or would not be possible because 
of the project’s structural design or 
worksite conditions. Therefore, before 
using a personnel platform to hoist 
personnel in storage tank (steel or 
concrete), shaft operations and chimney 
operations, the employer would need to 
determine that hoisting personnel in 
lieu of using other means of access to 
the work area is the least hazardous, or 
the only, means to gain access to the 
work area. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3) would 
establish the requirements when the 
employer uses a boatswain’s chair in 
lieu of a personnel platform for hoisting 
personnel. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3)(i) would 

establish which of the previous 

paragraphs in § 1926.1431 continue to 
apply when using a boatswain’s chair. 
For these applicable paragraphs, the 
reader would substitute the phrase 
‘‘boatswain’s chair’’ for either 
‘‘personnel platform’’ or ‘‘platform’’ and 
the employer must comply with these 
requirements. 

The paragraphs omitted from 

proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3)(i) do not 
apply when a boatswain’s chair is used. 
This is because the requirement is either 
specifically applicable to personnel 
platform use and design or generally not 
applicable when hoisting personnel in 
storage tanks (steel or concrete), shaft 
operations and chimney operations. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3)(ii) would 
require the employee to be hoisted in a 
slow, controlled descent and ascent. 
This is to limit swinging or sudden 
movement of the boatswain’s chair to 
prevent fall from the chair or impact 
with the walls or other areas or 
structures involved in these operations. 
Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3)(iii) would 
require the employee in the boatswain’s 
chair to use personal fall arrest 
equipment, including a full body 
harness, that is attached independent of 
the crane/derrick. Having the tie off 
point independent of the equipment 
protects the employee from a sudden 
drop or fall due to equipment failure or 
other problem associated with the 
operation of the crane/derrick and to 
protect the employee from falls when 
accessing and egressing the boatswain’s 
chair. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3)(iv) would 

require fall protection equipment to 
comply with § 1926.502, Fall protection 
systems criteria and practices. This 
would ensure that the fall equipment is 
sufficient to safely arrest the employee’s 
fall. 

Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3)(v) would 

require the boatswain’s chair to be 
capable of supporting, without failure, 
its own weight plus a minimum of five 
times the maximum intended load. This 
is consistent with the requirement for 
personnel platforms at 
§ 1926.1431(e)(4). 

Proposed § 1926.1431(s)(3)(vi) would 
mandate that only one person be hoisted 
at a time when using a boatswain’s 
chair. The Committee believed that 
hoisting more than one person using a 
boatswain’s chair in these operations 
would present unacceptable additional 
hazards for the employees being 
hoisted. 
Section 1432 Multiple Crane/Derrick 
Lifts 

74 There is no current requirement in Subpart N 

that specifically addresses hoisting personnel in 
storage tanks (steel or concrete), shaft operations, or 
chimney operations. 

This proposed section lists additional 

requirements for operations involving 
multiple cranes and derricks. It 

addresses hazards arising from 
operations that use more than one 
crane/derrick to lift a single load. This 
section evolved from the Committee’s 
concern that such operations involve an 
additional level of risk due to their 
higher degree of complexity. 
Specifically, the number and type of 
factors that must be accounted for, the 
difficulties associated with closely 
coordinating the movement of the 
multiple cranes/derricks, and the 
likelihood that such lifts are typically 
outside the normal routine for most 
employers, combine to create this higher 
level of risk. Consequently, the 
Committee agreed that such lifts need 
an additional level of planning and 
expertise over that required in routine 
operations. This section would require 
development and implementation of a 
plan by qualified persons, which would 
result in proactive decision-making and 
greater awareness and caution during 
multiple-crane/derrick operations. 

Currently, Subpart N, through 

incorporation of section 5–3.2.31 of 
ANSI B30.5–1968, addresses multiple 
lifts as follows: ‘‘When two or more 
cranes are used to lift one load, one 
designated person shall be responsible 
for the operation. He shall analyze the 
operation and instruct all personnel 
involved in the proper positioning, 
rigging of the load, and the movements 
to be made.’’ As discussed below, this 
proposed rule also requires supervision 
of the operation and instruction of 
personnel but, in addition, specifies 
qualifications that the person who 
supervises the lift must have and 
contains additional provisions to ensure 
safety. 
Paragraph 1432(a) Plan Development 

The purpose of the proposed 

requirement for a plan is to help ensure 
that the hazards involved with a 
multiple lift are identified and 
eliminated. These hazards include, but 
are not limited to, load slipping and 
unintended load shifting. Such hazards 
can be minimized by a plan that 
addresses elements such as the capacity 
of the cranes/derricks relative to load 
distribution (throughout the lift), load 
rigging, load travel (from start to finish), 
and communication. The Committee 
discussed several specific methods of 
addressing these hazards, but in view of 
the wide variety and circumstances of 
such lifts, determined that a plan-based 
requirement would be most appropriate 
and would be effective in reducing the 
risks associated with these operations. 

Proposed § 1926.1432(a)(1) would 

require that a qualified person develop 
the plan. Because of the inherent 
complexity of these operations,

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59841 

Committee members believed that it is 
necessary for a person with a high 
degree of knowledge and experience to 
develop the plan; otherwise, there is a 
significant likelihood that the plan 
would be ineffective in addressing the 
hazards. Therefore, the Committee 
determined that the plan developer 
would need to be a qualified person. 
Proposed § 1926.1432(a)(2) would 
require that the plan be designed to 
ensure that the requirements of this 
Subpart are met. This provision 
emphasizes that all applicable 
requirements in the proposed standard 
must be met when performing multiple 
crane/derrick lifts, in addition to the 
specific requirements set forth in this 
section. The Committee believed that it 
was important to emphasize this in the 
plan to help ensure safe multiple-crane/ 
derrick lift operations. 
Paragraph 1432(a)(3) 

Proposed § 1926.1432(a)(3) would 

require engineering expertise to be 
provided by the employer whenever the 
qualified person determines that it is 
necessary. In the view of the Committee, 
some, but not all multiple-crane/derrick 
lifts need to be planned with 
engineering expertise so that the lift can 
be performed safely. The Committee 
believed that it is not practical to set 
criteria in this proposed rule for 
identifying which lifts need such 
expertise. 
Paragraph 1432(b) Plan 
Implementation 

Under this proposed paragraph, the 

employer would be required to take 
specific steps designed to ensure that 
the decisions and precautions built into 
the plan are effectively implemented. 
Proposed § 1926.1432(b)(1) would 

require supervision of plan 
implementation by competent and 
qualified persons, or by one person who 
meets the definitions of both. The 
Committee believed that, especially in 
light of the inherent complexity of these 
operations, it is essential that a person 
(or team) with sufficient expertise and 
authority oversee the implementation of 
the plan. Supervision by a person or 
team with the attributes of both a 
competent and qualified person would 
ensure not only that potential problems 
are identified, but also that the person 
in charge of oversight will have the 
authority to correct anything that is 
amiss. For a detailed explanation of 
competent and qualified persons, refer 
to the preamble discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1404(a), Supervision— 
competent-qualified person. 

Proposed § 1926.1432(b)(2) would 

mandate that the supervisor review the 

plan with all employees who will be 
involved with the operation before lift 
operations begin. This would typically 
involve the signal person, rigging crew, 
crane operator, and sometimes laborers, 
who would all meet to make certain that 
everyone understands the plan and how 
the operation will be conducted. The 
Committee believed that it is important 
for employees to know how the plan 
will work, including their 
responsibilities and the responsibilities 
of others, to help ensure that the diverse 
aspects of the operation will be 
coordinated. 
Section 1433 Design, Construction and 
Testing 

Currently, Subpart N includes design, 

construction, and testing requirements 
for specific types of equipment that 
either incorporate pre-1970 consensus 
standards or that require equipment to 
conform to manufacturer’s 
specifications. The former category 
includes: Crawler, locomotive, and 
truck cranes (ANSI B30.5–1968, 
incorporated by 29 CFR 1926.550(b)(2)); 
overhead and gantry cranes (ANSI 
B30.2.0–1967, incorporated by 
1926.550(d)(4)); and derricks (ANSI 
B30.6–1969, incorporated by 
§ 1926.550(e)). The latter includes 
hammerhead tower cranes 
(§ 1926.550(c)(5)) and floating cranes 
and derricks (§ 1926.550(f)(2)(iii)). 
Except for crawler, locomotive, and 
truck cranes, design, construction and/ 
or testing requirements for each of these 
categories of equipment is addressed in 
a section of this proposed standard that 
is dedicated to that type of equipment. 
This proposed section contains certain 
requirements applicable only to crawler, 
locomotive, and truck cranes and, in 
addition, contains requirements that 
apply to all of the equipment subject to 
this standard. 

The C–DAC draft provides that the 
requirements of this section ‘‘apply to 
equipment that has a manufacturer- 
rated hoisting/lifting capacity of 2,000 
pounds or more.’’ However, proposed 
§ 1926.1441 sets forth requirements for 
equipment with a rated capacity of 
2,000 pounds or less and excludes 
§ 1926.1433 from the requirements for 
such equipment. The two sections 
conflict with respect to equipment rated 
at 2,000 pounds, which is a common 
rating. It is OSHA’s understanding that 
C–DAC included the 2,000-pound cutoff 
to parallel ANSI B30.5 in this regard. 
The 1968 and 2004 versions of ANSI 
B30.5, as well as intermediate versions, 
exclude equipment with a capacity of 
one ton or less. To conform to that 
intent in the proposed rule, OSHA has 
changed the introductory sentence so 

that it reads: ‘‘The following 
requirements apply to equipment that 
has a manufacturer-rated hoisting/lifting 
capacity of more than 2,000 pounds.’’ 
Paragraph 1433(a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) would require 

that crawler, truck and locomotive 
cranes manufactured prior to the 
effective date of this standard meet the 
applicable requirements for design, 
construction, and testing prescribed in 
ANSI B30.5–1968, safety code for 
‘‘Crawler, Locomotive, and Truck 
Cranes,’’ ‘‘PCSA Standard No. 2,’’ the 
requirements in paragraph (b), or the 
applicable DIN (Deutsches Institut fu¨ r 
Normung e.V., or German Institute for 
Standardization) standards that were in 
effect at the time of manufacture. 

This proposed provision would allow 
employers to continue to use equipment 
that complies with § 1926.550(b)(2) of 
Subpart N and also gives them the 
flexibility to use equipment that was 
built to conform to applicable DIN 
standards. The Committee concluded 
that the equipment manufactured 
during this period that was built to 
conform to the applicable DIN standards 
has not shown signs of being less safe 
from the standpoint of its design and 
construction than equipment built 
during this period to meet the 
applicable ANSI or PCSA standards. 
The C–DAC draft of this paragraph, 
and of § 1926.1433(c) (see discussion 
below), referred to ‘‘the effective date of 
1926.1400’’ instead of the ‘‘effective 
date of the standard.’’ For consistency 
throughout this proposal, OSHA has 
changed the references to ‘‘the effective 
date of 1926.1400’’ to ‘‘the effective date 
of the standard.’’ 
Paragraph 1433(b) 

Proposed (b) uses the phrase ‘‘mobile 

and locomotive cranes’’ to reflect the 
current terminology used in ASME 
B30.5–2004. As drafted by C–DAC, it 
would require that mobile (including 
crawler and truck) and locomotive 
cranes manufactured on or after the 
effective date of this standard meet 
certain provisions of ASME B30.5–2000 
with addenda ASME B30.5a–2002, 
‘‘Safety Code for Mobile and 
Locomotive Cranes.’’ Here, as elsewhere 
in this proposal, OSHA has updated the 
provision to refer to the 2004 version of 
ASME B30.5. OSHA has compared the 
2004 and earlier version and, as 
discussed below, requests public 
comment on whether certain changes in 
the 2004 version should be adopted. 
The provisions of ASME B30.5–2004 
incorporated in the C–DAC document 
are as follows:

(15) Section 5–1.9.7 (‘‘Clutch and 

Brake Protection’’); and 

(16) In section 5–1.9.12 

(‘‘Miscellaneous equipment’’), 
paragraphs (a), (c), (e), and (f). 

C–DAC’s intent in this paragraph was 
to incorporate design and construction 
provisions of ASME B30.5–2004 that 
would only be applicable to mobile and 
locomotive cranes. Some other 
provisions of ASME B30.5–2004 are not 
incorporated here because they deal 
with issues addressed elsewhere in this 
proposal. For example, two-block 
protection, which is required by section 
5–1.9.9.1 of the ASME standard, is 
addressed in § 1926.1416 of this 
proposed standard. In addition, the 
issues addressed in proposed paragraph 
(e) below are addressed in ASME B30.5– 
2004 but, instead of making those 
provisions applicable solely to mobile 
and locomotive cranes, C–DAC drafted 
corresponding provisions that would be 
applied to all of the equipment subject 
to this proposed standard. 

The sections of ASME B30.5 

referenced in proposed 
§ 1926.1433(b)(1) and (b)(13) contain 
substantive differences between the 
2004 and earlier versions. For 
§ 1926.1433(b)(1), Table 1 of section 5– 
1.1.1 includes new requirements for 
equipment with outriggers partially 
extended that are not found in the 

earlier version. For paragraph 
§ 1926.1433(b)(13), the 2004 version of 
section 5–1.9.3 contains a new 
paragraph (d) dealing with deploying 
partially extended outriggers. Inasmuch 
as § 1926.1404(q)(1) of this proposal 
permits partial deployment of outriggers 
when manufacturer procedures permit, 
OSHA believes it would serve C–DAC’s 
intent to incorporate the provisions on 
partially deployed outriggers in the 
2004 version of ASME B30.5. OSHA 
requests public comment on this issue. 
Upon reviewing the C–DAC draft of 

§ 1926.1433(b)(5), OSHA notes that two 
corrections are necessary. First, there is 
an internal inconsistency between the 
incorporation of paragraph (a) of the 
ASME section and the more limited 
incorporation of paragraphs (a)(2) 
through (a)(4). To correct this 
inconsistency, OSHA is deleting the 
reference to paragraph (a). Second, as 
noted earlier in the discussion of 
§ 1926.1414, the second sentence of 
section 5–1.3.2(c) of ASME B30.5–2004 
is stated as a recommendation rather 
than a mandatory requirement. OSHA 
believes it would be confusing to 
incorporate a non-mandatory 
recommendation into this standard. 
Therefore, rather than incorporating all 
of section 5–1.3.2(c) by reference, OSHA 
is proposing to incorporate only the first 
sentence, which reads: ‘‘When 
provided, a power-controlled lowering 
system shall be capable of handling 
rated loads and speeds as specified by 
the manufacturer.’’ With these changes, 
proposed § 1926.1433(b)(5) reads as 
follows: 

(5) In section 5–1.3.2 (‘‘Load Hoist 

Mechanism’’), paragraphs (a)(2)–(a)(4) 
(including subparagraphs), (b) (including 
subparagraphs), (c) (first sentence only), and 
(d). 

Finally, due to renumbering, section 
5–1.9.12 of the older ASME standard is 
section 5–1.9.11 in the 2004 version. 
The proposed rule reflects this change. 
Paragraph 1433(c) 

Proposed (c), Prototype testing, would 
require that prototype mobile (including 
crawler and truck) and locomotive 
cranes manufactured on or after the 
effective date of this standard meet the 
prototype testing requirements in 
§ 1926.1433(c)(1), Test Option A or 
§ 1926.1433(c)(2), Test Option B of this 
proposed section. As discussed in 
greater detail below, Test Option A 
continues the prototype testing 
methodology that has been required 
under Subpart N for crawler, 
locomotive, and truck cranes through 
the incorporation of ANSI B30.5–1968. 
Test Option B would permit, as an 

alternative, the use of computer 
modeling technology for prototype 
evaluation. 
Test Option A—Physical Testing 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1)(i), Test 

Option A, would state that the following 
applies to equipment with cantilevered 
booms (such as hydraulic boom cranes): 
all the tests listed in SAE J1063, Table 
1, shall be performed to load all critical 
structural elements to their respective 
limits; and all the strength margins 
listed in SAE J1063, Table 2 shall be 
met. As mentioned in previous 
paragraphs of this proposed standard, 
C–DAC recognized the abundance of 
hydraulic cranes now in production and 
believed OSHA needs to ensure that 
prototypes are tested to the most 
applicable standards. C–DAC identified 
current SAE standards as being most 
protective and applicable to the majority 
of cantilevered-boom cranes that are 
manufactured in the United States. In 
addition, they believed that most U.S. 
manufacturers already adhere to the 
SAE standards. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(c)(1)(ii) states 

that the following applies to equipment 
with pendant supported lattice booms: 
all the tests listed in SAE J987, Table 1, 
shall be performed to load all critical 
structural elements to their respective 
limits; and all the strength margins 
listed in SAE J987 Table 2 shall be met. 
C–DAC recommended that OSHA 
include the minimum testing criteria 
specified in the referenced SAE 
standard to ensure that prototype cranes 
with pendant supported booms were 
safe to operate on construction sites. 

The testing involved in the SAE tables 

under Option A uses empirical 
measurements of the prototype; in other 
words, ‘‘physical testing,’’ using 
equipment such as strain gauges, is 
done to determine if the prototype is 
within the requisite limits. 
Test Option B—Computer Modeling 
With Methodology Verification 

In contrast to the physical testing 

required under Test Option A, under 
proposed § 1926.1433(c)(2), Test Option 
B, the testing and verification 
requirements of CEN’s EN 13000 (2004), 
which permits tests to be conducted 
using computer modeling, would apply. 
In using the CEN (Comite Europe en de 
Normalisation, or European Committee 
for Standardization) standard, the 
additional requirements specified in 
proposed § 1926.1433(c)(2)(i) through 
(iii), which impose conditions that must 
be met if computer modeling is used, 
would also have to be met. 

During the C–DAC meetings, there 

was considerable discussion about

whether computer modeling is a 
sufficient substitute for physical testing. 
A German crane manufacturer gave a 
presentation to C–DAC in which they 
described successful experience with 
the use of computer modeling, which 
convinced some members of C–DAC 
that computer modeling should be 
allowed to be used to comply with this 
proposed section. Other C–DAC 
members were not convinced that 
computer modeling was sufficient to 
ensure that prototype cranes were safe 
for operation because the tested areas of 
those cranes were not strain gauged. 
Others believed that data was available 
which indicated that, when CEN testing 
standards were met, imported cranes 
were as safe as those tested using the 
strain gauging methods specified in 
§ 1926.1433(c)(1). Ultimately, C–DAC 
agreed to allow testing under the CEN 
standard but to mandate that the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1433(c)(2), discussed below, are 
met to ensure the reliability of the 
computer modeling. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(c)(2)(i) would 
require that the analysis methodology 
(computer modeling) demonstrate that 
all load cases listed in SAE J1063 meet 
the strength margins listed in SAE J1063 
Table 2 for equipment with cantilevered 
booms (such as hydraulic boom cranes). 
C–DAC determined that it is necessary 
that the computer modeling 
demonstrate that the prototype meets 
the same minimum strength criteria 
used in Test Option A (see proposed 
§ 1926.1433(c)(1)(i), Test Option A, 
above). 

Proposed § 1926.1433(c)(2)(ii) would 

require that the analysis methodology 
(computer modeling) demonstrate that 
all load cases listed in SAE J987 meet 
the strength margins listed in SAE J987 
Table 2 for equipment with pendant 
supported lattice booms. This proposed 
provision was included for the same 
reason as explained in the discussion of 
proposed § 1926.1433(c)(2)(i) above. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(c)(2)(iii), 

Analysis verification, is designed to 
ensure that computer modeling would 
not be used as a substitute for physical 
testing unless its accuracy and 
reliability is verified. Some C–DAC 
members raised objections to reliance 
on computer modeling because it may 
not accurately account for some aspects 
of a design, or may not be reliable for 
other reasons. Their concern was that if 
the analysis methodology did not 
accurately or reliably account for some 
aspect of the design, such error might 
not be known until there had been a 
failure of the crane when in use. 

To address this concern, under this 

proposed provision, computer modeling

may only be used as a substitute for 
strain gauge testing if the reliability of 
the computer modeling is verified by a 
history of strain gauge testing, or strain 
gauge testing combined with other 
physical testing. This does not mean 
that each computer modeling 
assessment of a particular prototype 
must be verified with strain gauge 
testing of that prototype. Rather, it 
means that strain gauge testing, or strain 
gauge testing combined with other 
physical testing, has been used to 
confirm the results of the computer 
modeling in enough relevant instances, 
which are documented, to demonstrate 
that the modeling is accurate and 
reliable. 

Some members of C–DAC were 

concerned that small employers would 
not have the resources to determine if 
the computer modeling used to test its 
crane met the specified SAE standards. 
This concern is addressed by proposed 
paragraph (e), which allows employers 
to rely on manufacturer documentation 
to show that the testing requirements of 
this proposed standard have been met. 

The C–DAC draft included a 

§ 1926.1433(c) that would have required 
that prototype testing of crawler, 
locomotive, and truck cranes meet the 
applicable requirements for prototype 
testing prescribed in ANSI B30.5–1968. 
Upon reviewing that provision, OSHA 
notes that it is included in the 
requirement of proposed § 1926.1433(a) 
that such cranes meet the applicable 
testing requirements of ANSI B30.5– 
1968. To avoid any confusion that such 
duplication may cause, OSHA is 
deleting C–DAC’s proposed 
§ 1926.1433(c) and has redesignated the 
paragraphs that followed it. However, to 
make clear that this deletion does not 
alter the substantive requirement for 
prototype testing in the C–DAC 
document, OSHA is adding a note at the 
end of paragraph (c) that states that 
prototype testing of crawler, locomotive 
and truck cranes manufactured prior to 
the effective date of the standard must 
conform to paragraph (a). 

OSHA notes that neither proposed 

§ 1926.1433(c) nor any other proposed 
provisions would apply prototype 
testing requirements to tower cranes. It 
appears to the Agency that this was an 
oversight on the part of C–DAC. OSHA 
requests public comment on whether 
there should be prototype testing 
requirements for tower cranes, and, if 
so, what requirements should apply. 
Paragraph 1433(d) 

Proposed paragraph (d) would 

mandate that all equipment covered by 
this Subpart meet the requirements 
listed in § 1926.1433(d)(1) through 

(d)(13) of this proposed section. As 
noted above, the issues addressed by 
paragraph (d) are addressed by ASME 
B30.5–2004. However, instead of 
making those requirements apply solely 
to mobile and locomotive cranes, C– 
DAC believed that all equipment 
covered by this proposal presents 
similar issues and drafted this 
paragraph to apply to all covered 
equipment. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(1), Load 

capacity/ratings and related 
information, would require the 
employer to ensure that the information 
available in the cab (see § 1926.1417(c)) 
regarding load capacity/ratings and 
related information include the data 
listed in § 1926.1433(d)(1)(i) through 
(d)(1)(xvi). This proposed paragraph 
essentially tracks section 5–1.1.3 of 
ASME B30.5–2004 but uses wording 
that makes the provisions of the ASME 
standard applicable to all equipment 
subject to this standard. Some of this 
information is already required for 
mobile and locomotive cranes by 
Subpart N’s incorporation of ANSI 
B30.5–1968. C–DAC believed that these 
equipment specifications need to be 
made available for the operator to 
reference in the cab so that the operator 
has immediate access to information 
needed to ensure safe operation. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(2), (3), and 
(4) are comparable to requirements in 
section 5–1.7.6 of ASME B30.5–2004. 
Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(2) would 
require that load hooks (including 
latched and unlatched types), ball 
assemblies and load blocks be of 
sufficient weight to overhaul the line 
from the highest hook position for boom 
or boom and jib lengths and the number 
of parts of the line in use. C–DAC 
explained that due to the various 
lengths of booms possible and the 
weight of varying lengths of cable along 
the entire lengths of those booms, 
selection of sufficiently weighted ball 
assemblies and load blocks is crucial to 
safe hoisting operations. C–DAC 
believed that this proposed requirement 
is necessary to prevent any incidents 
that would occur when ball assemblies, 
load blocks, and load hooks are of 
insufficient weight to keep the load line 
from being unintentionally pulled up 
the boom due to the weight of the load 
line itself. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(3) would 
require that hook and ball assemblies 
and load blocks be marked with their 
rated capacity and weight. C–DAC 
believed that marking this equipment 
with their rated capacities is needed to 
help ensure that they are not 
overloaded, which could lead to loss of 
the load. Marking them with their

weight is necessary to help enable 
employers to comply with proposed 
§ 1926.1433(d)(2) (discussed above). 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(4), Latching 

hooks, would require that hooks meet 
the requirements in 
§ 1926.1433(d)(4)(i)–(iii) of this 
proposed section. C–DAC believed that 
these proposed requirements would 
help employers reduce or eliminate the 
number of incidents related to the 
unintentional disengaging of loads from 
their load line hooks. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(4)(i) would 

require that hooks be equipped with 
latches, except where the requirements 
of § 1926.1433(d)(4)(ii) are met. C–DAC 
believed that the use of hooks with 
latches is an industry recognized 
practice but also recognized that there 
are some circumstances where the use 
of a hook with a latch presents a greater 
hazard. For example, if an employee 
would have to climb up or out onto an 
unsecured, elevated member to unhook 
the load after its placement, the 
employee would be exposed to a fall 
hazard. 

To accommodate such greater hazard 

scenarios, proposed § 1926.1433(d)(4)(ii) 
would require that hooks without 
latches, or with latches removed or 
disabled, not be used unless two criteria 
are met. First, a qualified person must 
determine that it is safer to hoist and 
place the load without latches (or with 
the latches removed/tied-back). Second, 
routes for the loads must be pre-planned 
to ensure that no employee is required 
to work in the fall zone except for 
employees necessary for the hooking or 
unhooking of the load. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(4)(iii) would 

require that the latch close the throat 
opening and be designed to retain slings 
or other lifting devices/accessories in 
the hook when the rigging apparatus is 
slack. This requirement was included to 
ensure that the rigging will not be 
unintentionally dislodged from the hook 
when the rigging apparatus is slack. C– 
DAC members described scenarios 
where loads had become caught on 
structures or objects and created a slack 
condition. This caused the rigging to 
become dislodged and resulted in the 
load falling. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(5), Posted 
warnings, states that posted warnings 
required by this subpart as well as those 
originally supplied with the equipment 
by the manufacturer shall be maintained 
in legible condition. Compliance with 
this proposed requirement would 
increase the likelihood that employees 
will recognize the hazard identified on 
the posted warning and avoid or protect 
themselves from that hazard. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(6) would 

require that an accessible fire 
extinguisher be on the equipment. This 
requirement, which is similar to one 
currently at § 1926.550(a)(14)(i), would 
enable a small fire to be extinguished 
before it can spread. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7), Cabs, 
states that equipment with cabs shall 
meet the requirements listed in 
§ 1926.1433(d)(7)(i) through (v) of this 
proposed section. The majority of 
§ 1926.1433(d)(7) is currently required 
for crawler, locomotive, and truck 
cranes by Subpart N, which 
incorporates the construction 
requirements of ANSI B30.5–1968. 
These proposed provisions would 
ensure that the crane operator is 
provided with a safe work station that 
has adequate ventilation, safe means of 
access and egress, good visibility, 
protection against window breakage, 
and sufficient roof strength. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(i) would 

require that cabs be designed with a 
form of adjustable ventilation and 
method for clearing the windshield for 
maintaining visibility and air 
circulation. Examples of means for 
adjustable ventilation include an air 
conditioner or window that can be 
opened (for ventilation and air 
circulation); examples of means for 
maintaining visibility include heater 
(for preventing windshield icing), 
defroster, fan, and windshield wiper. 
This provision would ensure adequate 
air circulation both for the operator’s 
health and for good visibility. 

Under proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(ii), 
cab doors (whether swinging or sliding) 
would have to be designed to prevent 
inadvertent opening or closing while 
traveling or operating the machine. 
Swinging doors adjacent to the operator 
must open outward. Sliding operator 
doors must open rearward. This 
proposed provision is currently required 
for crawler, locomotive, and truck 
cranes by section 5–1.8.1c of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N. Standardization 
of the direction for opening doors helps 
ensure that an operator will be able to 
exit the cab quickly in an emergency. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii), 

Windows, would require that cabs meet 
the requirements listed in 
§ 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(A) through (C). 
Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(A) 

would require that the cab have 
windows in front and on both sides of 
the operator. Forward vertical visibility 
would have to be sufficient to give the 
operator a view of the boom point at all 
times. This proposed provision is 
currently required for crawler, 
locomotive, and truck cranes by section 

5–1.8.1b of ANSI B30.5–1968, which is 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(B) 

would allow windows to have sections 
designed to be opened or readily 
removed. Windows with sections 
designed to be opened would have to be 
designed so that they can be secured to 
prevent inadvertent closure. This 
proposed provision is currently required 
for crawler, locomotive, and truck 
cranes by section 5–1.8.1b of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N. Compliance 
with this provision would ensure that 
the operator can adequately ventilate 
the cab should conditions within the 
cab affect the safe operation of the 
crane. Under such conditions, 
inadvertent closure of the windows 
during the operation of the crane could 
distract an operator or facilitate 
reoccurrence of conditions within the 
cab which adversely affect the safe 
operation of the crane. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(iii)(C) 

would specify that windows be of safety 
glass or material with similar optical 
and safety properties, that introduce no 
visible distortion or otherwise obscure 
visibility that interferes with the safe 
operation of the crane. This provision 
maintains the protections currently 
required by § 1926.550(a)(12). 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(iv) would 

require that a clear passageway be 
provided from the operator’s station to 
an exit door on the operator’s side. This 
proposed provision is currently required 
for crawler, locomotive, and truck 
cranes by section 5–1.8.1d of ANSI 
B30.5–1968, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N. This provision 
will enable the operator to enter and 
exit the equipment safely and will 
enable the operator to escape from the 
cab quickly in the event of an 
emergency. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(7)(v) would 
state that areas of the cab roof that serve 
as a workstation for rigging, 
maintenance or other crane-related tasks 
shall be capable of supporting 250 
pounds without permanent distortion. 
This proposed provision maintains the 
protection provided by Subpart N for 
crawler, locomotive, and truck cranes 
through its incorporation by reference of 
ANSI B30.5–1968 (section 5–1.8.4), 
except that the cab roof strength 
requirement was increased to 250 
pounds from 200 pounds. This increase 
was recommended by C–DAC to 
increase the safety factor of the roof in 
light of heavier employees and 
equipment that must be supported by 
the cab roof. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(8) would 

require that belts, gears, shafts, pulleys,

sprockets, spindles, drums, fly wheels, 
chains, and other parts or components 
that reciprocate, rotate or otherwise 
move be guarded where contact by 
employees (except for maintenance and 
repair workers) is possible in the 
performance of normal duties. This 
proposed provision continues the basic 
requirement of § 1926.550(a)(8) of 
Subpart N but revises the Subpart N 
provision to include an exception for 
maintenance and repair employees. The 
exception would permit maintenance 
and repair workers to remove the guards 
when their work requires access to the 
parts being guarded. C–DAC believed 
this exception was necessary because 
these employees often cannot perform 
their work with the guards installed. 
Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(9) would 

require that all exhaust pipes, 
turbochargers, and charge air coolers be 
insulated or guarded where contact by 
employees is possible in the 
performance of normal duties. As with 
proposed § 1926.1433(d)(8), an 
exception is provided when 
maintenance and repair workers need to 
remove the guards to perform their 
work. This proposed provision was 
included to retain the employee 
protection against burn injuries 
currently provided by § 1926.550(a)(10), 
which requires guarding or insulation of 
exhaust pipes, and to extend it to other 
components that can get hot enough to 
cause burns if contacted. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(10) would 
require that hydraulic and pneumatic 
lines be protected from damage to the 
extent feasible. Denting, crushing, 
puncturing, or nicking a hydraulic or 
pneumatic line could adversely affect 
the structural integrity of the line and 
compromise the safe operation of the 
affected systems and the crane as a 
whole. A similar provision is in section 
5–1.9.8 of ASME B30.5–2004. C–DAC 
believed that most manufacturers in the 
industry are already providing 
protection for these lines but believed it 
was advisable to include this proposed 
provision in light of the increasing 
numbers of pneumatically and 
hydraulically controlled cranes now 
being operated in the industry. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(11) would 
require that equipment be designed so 
that exhaust fumes are not discharged in 
the cab and are discharged in a direction 
away from the operator. This proposed 
provision was included to retain the 
employee protection provided for 
crawler, locomotive, and truck cranes by 
section 5–1.9.2 of ANSI B30.5–1968, 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N, 
and to extend it to other types of 
equipment. This proposed requirement 
ensures that exhaust gases which are

likely to adversely affect or incapacitate 
the operator will not accumulate in the 
cab because of the design of the 
equipment. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(12), Friction 
mechanisms, states that where friction 
mechanisms (such as brakes and 
clutches) are used to control the boom 
hoist or load line hoist, they shall be: Of 
a size and thermal capacity sufficient to 
control all rated loads with the 
minimum recommended reeving; and 
adjustable to permit compensation for 
lining wear to maintain proper 
operation. Comparable requirements 
now apply to crawler, locomotive, and 
truck cranes through incorporation by 
reference in Subpart N of ANSI B30.5– 
1968 (sections 5–1.3.2a.1 and 5–1.3.3). 
C–DAC believed that a similar 
requirement should apply to all 
equipment using friction mechanisms to 
control the boom hoist or load line. The 
Committee believed that this 
engineering technology is typical in 
most modern friction mechanisms. 

Proposed § 1926.1433(d)(13), 

Hydraulic load hoists, would specify 
that hydraulic drums have an integrally 
mounted holding device or internal 
static brake to prevent load hoist 
movement in the event of hydraulic 
failure. A comparable requirement is in 
section 5–1.3.1(d) of ASME B30.5–2004. 
This requirement will protect 
employees against serious injuries and 
deaths that could result from an 
unintended movement of the load hoist 
caused by a hydraulic failure. 
Paragraph 1433(e) 

As noted above, proposed paragraph 
(e) would permit employers to rely on 
documentation from manufacturers to 
show that they are in compliance with 
§ 1926.1433(a)–(c) and 
§ 1926.1433(d)(7)–(d)(13) where the 
equipment has not changed since it was 
manufactured, except in accordance 
with § 1926.1434, Equipment 
modifications. Section 1926.1433(d)(1)– 
(d)(6) are excluded from this provision 
because the employer can easily verify 
compliance with them without recourse 
to documentation provided by the 
manufacturer. 

A failure to have such documentation 

would not, in itself, constitute a 
violation of these provisions. Rather, 
proposed § 1926.1433(e) is intended to 
make it easier for employers to 
determine if their equipment meets 
these criteria. 
Section 1434 Equipment Modifications 

This proposed section addresses the 
procedures an employer must follow if 
it wants to modify equipment in a way 
that would affect its capacity or safe 

operation. Its purpose is to safeguard 
against unsafe modifications and to 
ensure that the equipment’s instructions 
and specifications are updated to reflect 
the modifications so that the equipment 
may be used safely. 

Currently, § 1926.550(a)(16) provides: 
No modifications or additions which affect 

the capacity or safe operation of the 
equipment shall be made by the employer 
without the manufacturer’s written approval. 
If such modifications or changes are made, 
the capacity, operation, and maintenance 
instruction plates, tags, or decals, shall be 
changed accordingly. In no case shall the 
original safety factor of the equipment be 
reduced. 

By requiring the manufacturer’s 
written approval, § 1926.550(a)(16) 
seeks to ensure that the proposed 
modifications or additions will be 
consistent with the design and 
structural integrity of the equipment 
and will not reduce the original safety 
factor of the equipment. The Committee 
believed that manufacturer approval 
was an important safeguard and should 
be retained but was concerned that it 
does not address situations in which the 
manufacturer does not respond to a 
request to approve a modification or 
when the manufacturer is no longer 
available to evaluate a proposed 
modification. Therefore, the Committee 
recommended a new provision that 
addresses these types of scenarios with 
procedures that it believed would allow 
for modifications to be made safely. 
Paragraph 1434(a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) would 

prohibit modifications or additions 
which affect the capacity or safe 
operation of the equipment except 
where any of three approval options set 
out in proposed § 1926.1434(a)(1), (2), 
and (3) are met. In the first option, 
proposed § 1926.1434(a)(1)(i), 
Manufacturer review and approval, the 
employer would be required to obtain 
written manufacturer approval for the 
modifications/additions. 

OSHA has corrected an inadvertent 

omission from proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(1) by adding proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(1)(ii), which requires the 
employer to modify the load charts, 
procedures, instruction manuals and 
instruction plates/tags/decals as 
necessary to accord with the 
modification/addition. Currently, 
§ 1926.550(a)(16) contains such a 
requirement and proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2), which requires the 
modifications or additions to be 
approved by a registered professional 
engineer if the manufacturer declines to 
review the proposal, does as well (see 
below). It was clearly C–DAC’s intent to

employer to modify the load charts,

§ 1926.1434(a)(1)(ii) requires, will help 
ensure that the equipment is operated 
safely. 

The second option, proposed 

§ 1926.1434(a)(2), Manufacturer refusal 
to review request, would establish a 
procedure where the manufacturer 
either declines to review a request for a 
modification approval or fails to 
respond to the request. Under this 
procedure, the employer would be 
required to provide a detailed 
description of the proposed 
modification to the manufacturer and 
ask it to approve the modification/ 
addition. If the manufacturer declines to 
review the technical merits of the 
proposal or fails, within 30 days, to 
acknowledge the request or initiate the 
review, the employer would be 
permitted to proceed with the 
modification if the requirements 
specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2)(i) and (ii) are met. 

Proposed § 1926.1434(a)(2)(i) would 

require that a registered professional 
engineer who is a qualified person with 
respect to the equipment involved take 
two actions. First, under proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2)(i)(A), the engineer 
would have to approve the 
modification/addition and specify the 
equipment configurations to which that 
approval applies. The second action that 
the approving engineer would have to 
take, which is described under proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2)(i)(B), would be to 
modify load charts, procedures, 
instruction manuals and instruction 
plates/tags/decals as necessary to accord 
with the modification/addition. 

This is essential for safe equipment 
operation because these are the charts, 
signs and materials that inform the user 
and operator of the capacities, 
procedures and limitations that apply to 
the equipment. Proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2)(ii) would specify that 
the modification/addition not reduce 
the original safety factor of the 
equipment, retaining the comparable 
requirement now found in 
§ 1926.550(a)(16). 

The Committee recommended 

§ 1926.1434(a)(2) because it believed 
that the refusal of a manufacturer to 
review a request, or a manufacturer’s 
failure to act on the request within a

reasonable time, should not preclude an 
employer from making a modification if 
adequate precautions are followed. The 
Committee concluded that 30 days 
would give the manufacturer a 
reasonable amount of time to decide 
whether to simply decline to review the 
request or to proceed with evaluating it. 
Also, the Committee concluded that a 
failure to respond at all in this period 
would fairly reflect an intention not to 
act on the request in a timely manner. 

C–DAC believed that the actions 

specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2)(i) would need to be 
done by a registered professional 
engineer who is a qualified person with 
respect to the equipment involved. The 
term ‘‘qualified person’’ is defined in 
proposed § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a person who, 
by possession of a recognized degree, 
certificate, or professional standing, or 
who by extensive knowledge, training 
and experience, successfully 
demonstrated the ability to solve/ 
resolve problems related to the subject 
matter, the work, or the project.’’ The 
Committee thought it important to make 
clear that this individual needs to be a 
qualified person ‘‘with respect to the 
equipment involved,’’ since specialized 
engineering knowledge is needed to 
make the required assessments 
regarding the particular equipment that 
is being modified. 

The approval of the modification/ 

addition under proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2)(i) would have to 
specify the equipment configurations to 
which that approval applies. Cranes 
typically can be configured in a variety 
of ways. Modifications may have 
different effects depending on the 
configuration. It is therefore essential for 
purposes of ensuring safe operation that 
the approval specify the configurations 
to which the approval applies. An 
example of an approval that met this 
aspect of the proposed provision would 
be the following: ‘‘This is an approval 
to add an additional boom section of the 
above-described design for a brand K 
lattice boom crane, model 1. This 
approval applies only when the crane is 
configured without a jib.’’ 

This proposed section uses the term 

‘‘modification/addition’’ to refer to 
‘‘modification or addition.’’ The 
Committee wanted to make clear that an 
addition to the equipment is a type of 
modification and needs to be subject to 
the same approval procedures as other 
types of modifications. For example, the 
addition of a generator to the back of the 
cab of a crane needs to be subject to the 
approval procedures because it will 
alter the crane’s backward stability. 

Proposed § 1926.1434(a)(3), 

Unavailable manufacturer, would 

address a scenario where an employer 
wishes to make an equipment 
modification and the manufacturer of 
the equipment is unavailable to review 
the proposed modifications because, for 
example, it has gone out of business 
(and has not been taken over by a 
successor company). Under these 
circumstances, if the employer wishes 
to modify its equipment in such a way 
that affects its capacity and safe 
operation, it must meet the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) above. 
Paragraph 1434(b) 

Proposed paragraph (b) would 

prohibit modifications or additions 
which affect the capacity or safe 
operation of the equipment where the 
manufacturer, after a review of the 
technical safety merits of the proposed 
modification/addition, rejects the 
proposal and explains the reasons for 
the rejection in a written response. This 
requirement is the same as in 
§ 1926.550(a)(16), except C–DAC 
believed that it was important to 
expressly state the need for the 
manufacturer to explain why it rejected 
the employer’s proposed modification. 
Such an explanation would both 
demonstrate that the manufacturer 
reviewed the technical safety merits of 
the request and give the employer the 
opportunity to modify the proposal to 
address the manufacturer’s objections. 

The C–DAC version of proposed 

§ 1926.1434(b) did not explicitly state 
the effect of a manufacturer rejecting the 
proposal but failing to provide written 
reasons for the rejection. OSHA believes 
that C–DAC intended that such a 
situation be treated as a manufacturer 
refusal to review the request under 
§ 1926.1434(a)(2). To effectuate this 
intent, OSHA has added the following 
sentence to proposed § 1926.1434(b): 

If the manufacturer rejects the proposal but 
does not explain the reasons for the rejection 
in writing, the employer may treat this as a 
manufacturer refusal to review the request 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
Paragraph 1434(c) 

Proposed paragraph (c) would state 
that the provisions in § 1926.1434(a) 
and (b) of this proposed section do not 
apply to modifications made or 
approved by the U.S. military. A 
representative of the U.S. Navy 
indicated to C–DAC that such an 
exception is needed in the event of 
military exigencies. 
Section 1435 Tower Cranes 

‘‘Tower crane’’ is defined in 

§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘a type of lifting 
structure which utilizes a vertical mast

or tower to support a working boom (jib) 
in an elevated position. Loads are 
suspended from the working boom. 
While the working boom may be of the 
fixed type (horizontal or angled) or have 
luffing capability, it can always rotate to 
swing loads, either by rotating on the 
top of the tower (top slewing) or by the 
rotation of the tower (bottom slewing). 
The tower base may be fixed in one 
location or ballasted and moveable 
between locations.’’ This definition is 
based in part on the SC&RF Handbook’s 
definition.75 

Subpart N, at § 1926.550(c), addresses 

only one type of tower crane: those in 
which the working boom is fixed 
horizontally (hammerhead cranes). 
Furthermore, § 1926.550(c) addresses 
such tower cranes only to a limited 
extent. Specifically, it addresses 
adequate clearance for employee 
passage near moving and rotating parts, 
fall protection, trolley buffers, and limit 
switches for cranes that travel on rails. 
In addition, § 1926.550(c)(5) requires 
that hammerhead tower cranes meet the 
applicable requirements for design, 
construction, installation, testing, 
maintenance, inspection, and operation 
as prescribed by the manufacturer. 

The Committee believed that most of 

the provisions in the other sections of 
this proposed standard are necessary 
and appropriate for tower cranes but 
that, in addition, certain unique 
characteristics of tower cranes 
necessitate certain additional 
requirements. 
Paragraph 1435(a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) states that 

unless provided otherwise in this 
section, all other sections of this 
proposed standard apply to tower 
cranes. As discussed below, sections 
§ 1926.1415 (safety devices) and 
§ 1926.1416 (operational aids) would 
not apply to tower cranes. Instead, this 
proposed section lists the safety devices 
and operational aids that would be 
required for tower cranes. In addition, 
this proposed section contains 
additional requirements for erecting, 
climbing, dismantling, and inspections. 
Paragraph 1435(b) Erecting, Climbing 
and Dismantling 

Proposed paragraph 1435(b) addresses 

erecting, climbing, and dismantling 
tower cranes. Under proposed 
paragraph 1435(b)(1), the employer 
would be required to comply with the 
assembly and disassembly requirements 
set out in proposed §§ 1926.1403, 
1926.1404 and 1926.1405 except as 

75 This definition is explained in the discussion 

above of proposed § 1926.1401 (Definitions).

otherwise specified in this section. 
Because the industry generally refers to 
the assembly and disassembly of tower 
cranes as erecting, climbing and 
dismantling, the term ‘‘assembly,’’ as 
used in §§ 1926.1403 through 
1926.1405, is replaced with ‘‘erecting 
and climbing,’’ and the term 
‘‘disassembly’’ is replaced with 
‘‘dismantling.’’ 

OSHA notes that proposed 

§ 1926.1403(b) specifies that employer 
procedures for assembly and 
disassembly may be used only where 
the employer can demonstrate that the 
procedures used meet the requirements 
in § 1926.1406. The C–DAC draft of 
§ 1926.1435(b) inadvertently omitted a 
reference to § 1926.1406. OSHA has 
corrected that omission; proposed 
paragraph (b)(1) now reads as follows: 

(1) Sections 1926.1403 (Assembly/ 

disassembly—selection of manufacturer or 
employer procedures), 1926.1404 (Assembly/ 
disassembly—general requirements), 
1926.1405 (Disassembly—additional 
requirements for disassembly of booms and 
jibs), and 1926.1406 (Assembly/ 
disassembly—employer procedures—general 
requirements), apply to tower cranes (except 
as otherwise specified), except that the term 
‘‘assembly/disassembly’’ is replaced by 
‘‘erecting, climbing and dismantling,’’ and 
the term ‘‘disassembly’’ is replaced by 
‘‘dismantling.’’ 

Proposed paragraph 1435(b)(2), 

Dangerous areas (self-erecting tower 
cranes), addresses the hazards 
associated with crew members located 
in certain areas. Employees would be 
prohibited from being in or under the 
tower, jib, or rotating portion of the 
crane during erecting, climbing and 
dismantling operations until the crane is 
secured in a locked position and the 
competent person indicates it is safe to 
enter these areas. The only exception to 
this would be where the manufacturer’s 
instructions direct otherwise and the 
employer limits access to necessary 
employees only. 

These areas are hazardous because, in 

the event of unintended movement of 
components, there is a heightened 
chance than an employee could be 
struck or crushed. The exception 
accounts for those situations in which, 
due to the design of the equipment, it 
is infeasible for all employees to be out 
of these areas during erecting, climbing 
and dismantling operations. 

Under proposed paragraph (b)(3), 

Foundations and structural supports, 
tower crane foundations and structural 
supports would be required to be 
designed by the manufacturer or a 
registered professional engineer. The 
Committee noted that structural 
supports can include portions of a 

structure, such as the floors or columns 
of a building, when the tower crane is 
mounted to them and they are used to 
help support the crane. 

When a tower crane is mounted to 

portions of a structure, it is vital for safe 
operation that the structure be able to 
withstand both the crane and the loads 
the crane will handle throughout the 
job. Accordingly, when portions of a 
structure are used to support a tower 
crane, the manufacturer or registered 
professional engineer who designs the 
crane’s structural supports must ensure 
not only that the structure is adequate 
to support the crane when it is mounted 
but that it will continue to support the 
crane under all anticipated conditions 
of use. 

Moreover, that entity must ensure 

both that the structure is strong enough 
to support the crane under all 
anticipated conditions of use and that 
the means of attaching the crane to the 
structure are strong enough to maintain 
the crane’s support throughout the job. 
Therefore, OSHA interprets ‘‘structural 
supports’’ in this provision to include 
both the portions of the structure used 
for support and the means of 
attachment. OSHA requests public 
comment on whether proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(3) states this intent with 
sufficient clarity. 

As drafted by C–DAC, this provision 
was listed as one of the hazards the A/ 
D supervisor must address. However, 
the provision imposes a specific duty on 
the employer to have the foundations 
and structural supports designed by the 
manufacturer or a registered 
professional engineer, and this will be 
more clearly stated if the provision is 
contained in a stand-alone requirement 
rather than as one of several 
requirements that the A/D supervisor 
must address. Accordingly, OSHA has 
moved the provision into a separate 
§ 1926.1435(b)(3).76 In addition, as 
discussed below, the original 
§ 1926.1435(b)(3)(i) (now 
§ 1926.1435(b)(4)(i)) has been modified 
to state that the A/D supervisor must 
verify that the foundation and structural 
supports have been installed in 
accordance with their design in order to 
ensure that the design of the 
manufacturer or registered professional 
engineer has actually been 
implemented. 

Proposed paragraph 1435(b)(4), 

Addressing specific hazards, would 
require the employer to comply with 
proposed § 1926.1404(h)(1) through (9). 

76 The list of hazards the A/D supervisor must 
address was in § 1926.1435(b)(3) of the C–DAC 
draft; that list (as modified in accordance with the 
discussion above) is now located in proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(4).

59848 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

During erecting, climbing and 
dismantling, proposed § 1926.1404(h) 
would require that the A/D supervisor 
address certain hazards (these are 
discussed above in the discussion of 
proposed § 1926.1404). Proposed 
1926.1435(b)(4) lists additional hazards, 
specific to tower cranes, that the A/D 
supervisor would also have to address. 
These additional hazards are those 
associated with (i) the foundations and 
structural supports for tower cranes, (ii) 
the loss of backward stability, and (iii) 
wind speed. 

Proposed paragraph 1435(b)(4)(i) 
would require the A/D supervisor to 
verify that the foundation and structural 
supports are installed in accordance 
with their design. This paragraph is 
designed to ensure that the design of 
these components by the manufacturer 
or registered professional engineer is 
followed when they are installed. 

Proposed (b)(4)(ii) would require that 

the A/D supervisor address the 
backward stability of the crane before 
self erecting tower cranes or cranes on 
traveling or stationary undercarriages 
are swung. This provision is similar to 
the assembly/disassembly requirement 
in § 1926.1404(h)(11)(discussed above) 
except that it applies only to self 
erecting tower cranes and cranes that 
are on traveling or static (stationary) 
undercarriages. It applies to these types 
of tower cranes to highlight the fact that, 
because they do not have a base that is 
fixed to the ground, the backwards 
stability safety issue needs to be 
addressed. 

Tower cranes have a relatively small 

footprint relative to their height. The 
horizontal force caused by wind during 
erecting and dismantling can therefore 
have a substantial effect on the stability 
of a tower crane. Proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(4)(iii) would require that 
erecting, climbing, and dismantling not 
take place when the wind speed 
recommended by the manufacturer is 
exceeded. Where the manufacturer does 
not specify the proper wind speed, a 
qualified person would be required to 
determine the wind speed not to be 
exceeded. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(4), Plumb 

tolerance, addresses the extent to which 
tower cranes need to be plumb. This 
proposed provision would require that 
the crane’s tower be plumb to the 
manufacturer’s tolerance and verified by 
a qualified person. The Committee 
noted that if a vertical tower is out of 
plumb the stability of the crane is 
greatly reduced. In addition, an out of 
plumb condition can reduce the crane’s 
capacity and could cause a collapse. 
Where the manufacturer does not 

specify the plumb tolerance, this 

provision would require that the tower 
be plumbed to a tolerance of at least 
1:500. The Committee noted that a 
tolerance of at least 1:500 is generally 
what manufacturers specify and that for 
any type of vertical structure this 
generally is the accepted plumb 
tolerance in the engineering and 
construction industries. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(6), Multiple 

tower crane jobsites, would require 
construction jobsites with more than 
one fixed jib (hammerhead) tower crane 
installed to be located so that no crane 
could contact the structure of another 
crane. However, the jibs of multiple 
hammerhead tower cranes would be 
permitted to pass over/under one 
another. 

This would help to ensure that 

multiple tower cranes on a construction 
site do not collide with each other. Such 
a collision could cause employee 
injuries or fatalities in various ways. For 
example, employees could be struck by 
a load that was caused to swing by the 
collision; a tower crane operator could 
be struck; employees could be struck by 
a falling load, or there could be a 
collapse of one or more cranes. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(7), Climbing 

procedures, contains special 
requirements that would have to be 
followed during the climbing process. 
‘‘Climbing’’ is defined in § 1926.1401, 
Definitions, as: ‘‘The process in which a 
tower crane is raised to a new working 
height, either by adding additional 
tower sections to the top of the crane 
(top climbing), or by a system in which 
the entire crane is raised inside the 
structure (inside climbing).’’ 

Currently, the process of climbing is 
unique to tower cranes. The Committee 
indicated that, if done improperly, a 
collapse can occur during the climbing 
process. This proposed paragraph 
would require that prior to, and during 
all, climbing procedures the employer 
(i) comply with all manufacturer 
prohibitions; (ii) have a registered 
professional engineer verify that the 
host structure is strong enough to 
sustain the forces imposed through the 
braces, brace anchorages and supporting 
floors; and (iii) ensure that no part of the 
climbing procedure takes place when 
wind exceeds the speed recommended 
by the manufacturer or, where the 
manufacture does not specify the wind 
speed, a qualified person must 
determine the appropriate wind speed. 
Proposed (b)(7)(ii) would require the 

employer to have a registered 
professional engineer verify that the 
host structure is strong enough to 
sustain the forces imposed through the 
braces, brace anchorages and supporting 
floors. Examples of typical host

structures include a building, parking 
garage, bridge or pier. If the host 
structure is not strong enough, the host 
structure could collapse and cause the 
tower crane to collapse as well. 

Proposed (b)(7)(iii) would require the 

employer to ensure that no part of the 
climbing procedure takes place when 
wind exceeds the speed recommended 
by the manufacturer or by a qualified 
person if the manufacturer does not 
specify this information. This provision 
is included because, during the 
climbing process, a tower crane is not 
yet fully stabilized and excessively high 
winds can lead to a collapse. 

The Agency notes that proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(4)(iii) would require 
wind speed to be addressed during 
erecting, climbing and dismantling in 
the same manner as 
§ 1926.1435(b)(7)(iii). OSHA requests 
public comment on whether 
§ 1926.1435(b)(7)(iii) should be omitted 
as redundant. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(8), 

Counterweight/ballast, addresses the 
hazard of instability that can result from 
improper installation or removal of 
counterweight/ballast, which can cause 
a collapse. Proposed § 1926.1435(b)(8)(i) 
and (ii) would require that tower cranes 
not be erected, dismantled or operated 
without the amount and position of 
counterweight or ballast in place as 
specified by the manufacturer or a 
registered professional engineer and that 
the maximum amount of counterweight 
or ballast not be exceeded. The 
registered professional engineer must be 
one who is familiar with the equipment. 

OSHA has made several wording 

changes to proposed § 1926.1435(b)(8)(i) 
and (ii) as compared with the C–DAC 
draft of these provisions. First, the C– 
DAC draft of proposed § 1926.1435(b)(8) 
used the term ‘‘professional engineer,’’ 
rather than, as used in proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(7)(i) and other provisions 
in this proposed standard, ‘‘registered 
professional engineer.’’ OSHA believes 
that this was an inadvertent omission 
and has added the word ‘‘registered’’ in 
proposed § 1926.1435(b)(8)(i) and (ii). 

Second, the C–DAC draft of proposed 

§ 1926.1435(b)(8)(ii) used the word 
‘‘approved’’ in the phrase ‘‘approved by 
the manufacturer or professional 
engineer.’’ In contrast, in the draft of 
proposed § 1926.1435(b)(8)(i), C–DAC 
used the phrase ‘‘as specified by’’ rather 
than ‘‘approved.’’ To ensure consistency 
and avoid confusion, the Agency has 
substituted the phrase ‘‘as specified by’’ 
for the word ‘‘approved’’ in proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(8)(ii). 

Third, the C–DAC draft of proposed 

§ 1926.1435(b)(8)(i) referred to the 
amount and position of the

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59849 

‘‘counterweight or ballast.’’ However, 
some tower cranes, such as traveling 
tower cranes, have both counterweight 
and ballast. Therefore, the Agency has 
changed the language so that proposed 
§ 1926.1435(b)(8)(i) refers to 
‘‘counterweight and/or ballast.’’ 
Paragraph 1435(c) Signs 

This proposed requirement addresses 
the hazards that can result from adding 
signs to tower cranes. Many employers 
will attach/hang/install signs (or 
advertisements) to the jib, boom or 
tower, such as signs with the company 
name. The force of the wind bearing 
against a large sign can significantly 
increase the horizontal force the wind 
exerts on the crane. According to the 
Committee, most manufacturers specify 
the maximum size and permissible 
location of signs so that the stability of 
the tower crane is not compromised. 
Proposed 1926.1435(c) would require 
employers to comply with the 
manufacturer’s specifications 77 
regarding the size and location of signs. 
Where the manufacturer does not 
specify this information or where such 
information is unavailable, this 
provision would require a registered 
professional engineer who is familiar 
with the specific type of tower crane 
involved to give written approval of the 
size and location of any signs. 

Note that the C–DAC draft included 

this provision as § 1926.1435(b)(4). 
However, upon review, OSHA became 
aware that signs are sometimes placed 
on tower cranes after the erecting/ 
climbing process has been completed. 
Therefore, to make clear that the 
provision would apply irrespective of 
whether the sign was installed during or 
after erecting/climbing, the Agency has 
changed this provision’s designation so 
that it is no longer under the paragraph 
on erecting, climbing and dismantling. 
Paragraphs 1435(d), Safety Devices, and 
1435(e), Operational Aids 

These proposed paragraphs set out the 
safety devices and operational aids that 
would be required on tower cranes. 
Proposed §§ 1926.1415 and 1926.1416, 
which would require safety devices and 
operational aids on other types of 
cranes, would not be applicable to tower 
cranes. Instead, proposed § 1926.1435(d) 
and (e) would apply. Although some of 
the safety devices and operational aids 
for tower cranes are the same as 
§§ 1926.1415 and 1926.1416 require for 
other equipment, others are unique to 
tower cranes. C–DAC believed it would 

77 OSHA has changed the C–DAC word 

‘‘procedures’’ to ‘‘specifications’’ for greater 
accuracy and clarity.

promote clarity to list all the devices 
and aids for tower cranes in this section. 

Safety devices would be required to 

be in proper working order. Where a 
safety device is not in proper working 
order, the crane would have to be taken 
out of service until it is again 
functioning properly. The Committee 
believed that the protection offered by 
safety devices is critical to safe 
operation and that there is no 
alternative way to achieve the same 
level of safety that the safety devices 
provide. By contrast, if an operational 
aid is malfunctioning, operations may 
continue where the employer 
implements specified temporary 
alternative measures. Where the tower 
crane manufacturer specifies more 
protective alternative measures than 
those specified in this proposed section, 
the employer would be required to 
follow those more protective alternative 
measures. 

Safety Devices: Proposed paragraph 
(d)(2) would require the safety devices 
on tower cranes discussed below. 

Boom stops on luffing boom type 

tower cranes (proposed 
§ 1926.1435(d)(2)(i)) and jib stops on 
luffing boom type tower cranes if 
equipped with a jib attachment 
(proposed § 1926.1435(d)(2)(ii)) would 
be required. These are comparable to the 
boom and jib stops required for other 
cranes under proposed § 1926.1415 
(discussed above) and are intended to 
prevent the boom and jib from being 
raised to too high an angle and toppling 
over backwards. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2)(iii) would 

require travel end rail stops at both ends 
of the travel rail. These are comparable 
to the rail stops required for equipment 
on rails under proposed § 1926.1415 
and are designed to keep the crane from 
overshooting the boundaries on the rail 
within which it is supposed to operate. 
Overshooting the boundaries could 
result in a collapse. Subpart N currently 
contains a similar requirement at 
§ 1926.550(c)(4). 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2)(iv) would 
require travel rail clamps on all travel 
bogies. A ‘‘travel bogie (tower cranes)’’ 
is defined at § 1401 as ‘‘an assembly of 
two or more axles arranged to permit 
vertical wheel displacement and 
equalize the loading on the wheels.’’ 
This definition is comparable to the 
definition of ‘‘bogie’’ in the SC&RF 
Handbook. When tower cranes travel on 
rails, they are mounted on travel bogies. 
The rail clamps that would be required 
by this proposed paragraph enable the 
bogies to be clamped to the rail to 
prevent the crane from lifting off the 
rail. They secure the crane in place 
when out of operation to prevent the 

crane from drifting unintentionally, 
which could cause struck-by accidents. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2)(v) would 

require integrally mounted check valves 
on all load supporting hydraulic 
cylinders. A check valve permits fluid 
to flow in one direction only. When 
installed on load supporting hydraulic 
cylinders, such as the cylinders used to 
climb the crane, they protect against the 
loss of load support in the event of a 
hydraulic pressure failure by preventing 
the reverse flow of the hydraulic fluid 
supporting the cylinder. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2)(vi) would 

require a hydraulic system pressure 
limiting device. A pressure limiting 
device, such as a relief valve, would 
prevent the pressure in a hydraulic 
system from exceeding its design limit, 
which can cause the system to fail. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2)(vii) would 

require the following brakes, which 
must automatically set in the event of 
pressure loss or power failure: A hoist 
brake on all hoists; a swing brake; a 
trolley brake; and a rail travel brake. 
These types of brakes are needed to 
enable the motion of the crane and load 
to be controlled safely. Under this 
proposed paragraph, they must set 
automatically to avoid uncontrolled 
movement of the crane or load in the 
event of pressure loss or power failure 
that prevents their operation. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2)(viii) would 

require deadman control or forced 
neutral return control (hand) levers. 
These devices ensure that the crane 
does not move unless the movement is 
being controlled by the operator. In the 
case of a deadman control, the motion 
being controlled, such as hoisting or 
trolleying, ceases when the operator 
releases the control. Forced neutral 
return control levers automatically 
return to the neutral position when they 
are released. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2)(ix) would 
require an emergency stop switch at the 
operator’s station. This safety device is 
needed to enable the operator to 
immediately stop all crane functions in 
the event of an emergency. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(3) would 

require that the safety devices listed in 
§ 1926.1435(d)(2) be in proper working 
order for the crane to be operated. 
Where a device stops working properly 
during operations, the operator would 
have to safely stop operations, and 
operations would be prohibited from 
resuming until the device is once again 
in proper working order. 

Operational aids: Like proposed 
§ 1926.1416 for other equipment, 
proposed paragraph § 1926.1435(e) 
divides operational aids for tower 
cranes into Category I aids and Category

II aids, with the two categories differing 
in the amount of time that temporary 
alternative measures can be used until 
the aids are repaired. For Category I aids 
that period is seven days, and for 
Category II it is 30 days. Also like 
§ 1926.1416, if a required part is ordered 
within seven days and not received in 
time to complete the repair in seven and 
30 days, respectively, the employer 
would have seven days from receiving 
the part to complete the repair. 

Proposed paragraph 1435(e)(4) 

specifies that operational aids must 
work properly during operations and, if 
an aid stops working, the operator 
would be required to safely stop 
operations until the aid is working 
properly again or until the temporary 
alternative measures are implemented. 
Where a replacement part for an 
operational aid is not available, the 
substitution of a device that performs 
the same function would not be 
considered a modification subject to 
proposed § 1926.1434, i.e., it would not 
need to be approved by the 
manufacturer or a registered 
professional engineer. See the 
discussion above regarding proposed 
§ 1926.1416 for an explanation of the 
committee’s rationale for this approach 
to operational aids. 

Three of the operational aids 

discussed below would be required on 
tower cranes manufactured more than 
one year after the effective date of the 
standard. The remainder would be 
required on all cranes. It was C–DAC’s 
understanding that the three aids that 
would not be required on existing 
cranes represent technology that has not 
been commonly available until recently, 
while the aids that would be required 
on all cranes have routinely been used 
in the industry for some time. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5) would 

require the Category I operational aids 
discussed below and specifies the 
alternative measures that would have to 
be followed if they are not working 
properly. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(i) would 
require trolley travel limiting devices. 
These devices would be required at both 
ends of the jib to prevent the trolley 
from running into the end stops. If the 
trolley were to run into an end stop, 
injuries or fatalities could result in a 
variety of ways. For example, the 
sudden stopping of the trolley at the 
outward end stop could cause the load 
to swing significantly past the crane’s 
maximum working radius, causing a 
collapse. Another example is where the 
load swing from the sudden stopping of 
the trolley could cause the load to fall 
and strike employees. 

If this operational aid was not 

working properly, the employer would 
have to use one of two temporary 
alternative measures: (A) Mark the 
trolley rope so it can be seen by the 
operator at a point that will give the 
operator sufficient time to stop the 
trolley prior to the end stops, or (B) use 
a spotter when operations are conducted 
within 10 feet of a trolley end stop. The 
Committee believed that both options 
would constitute safe alternatives until 
the trolley travel limit device is back in 
working order within the required time 
frame. 

In order for the proposed option for a 

spotter in proposed 
§ 1926.1435(e)(5)(i)(B) to work 
effectively and as the Committee 
intended, the spotter would need to 
communicate with the operator. 
Although such a communication 
requirement is implicit, the Agency 
believes that, to avoid ambiguity, the 
provision needs to explicitly require 
that the spotter be in communication 
with the operator. Therefore, OSHA 
believes that the C–DAC language in 
proposed § 1926.1435(e)(5)(i)(B), as well 
as the additional provisions in proposed 
§ 1926.1435 which reference spotters, 
should be changed to include such a 
requirement. The provision, if changed 
in this manner, would read: 

(B) Option B. A spotter who is in direct 
communication with the operator shall be 
used when operations are conducted within 
10 feet of the outer or inner trolley end stops. 

OSHA requests public comment on 

the advisability of such a change. 
In Subpart N, § 1926.550(c)(3) 

currently requires trolley end stops (it 
refers to them as ‘‘buffers’’). In 
reviewing the C–DAC draft of the trolley 
travel limiting devices provision 
discussed above, OSHA realized that the 
C–DAC draft did not carry forward the 
requirement in § 1926.550(c)(3) for 
trolley end stops. The Agency believes 
that this was an inadvertent omission, 
since the C–DAC draft included a 
requirement for trolley travel limiting 
devices, and those devices would not 
work without trolley end stops. 
Therefore, OSHA has added proposed 
§ 1926.1435(d)(2)(x), which would 
require trolley end stops as safety 
devices. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(ii) would 

require a boom hoist limiting device. As 
defined in proposed § 1926.1401, the 
word ‘‘boom’’ used in reference to tower 
cranes refers to a luffing boom. 
Therefore, under this proposed 
paragraph, a boom hoist limiting device 
would only be required on cranes with 
luffing booms. A boom hoist limiting 
device automatically prevents the boom 

hoist from pulling the boom past the 
minimum allowable radius (maximum 
boom angle), which can result in boom 
failure (see the discussion above of 
boom hoist limiting device with respect 
to proposed § 1926.1416(d)(1)). The 
temporary alternative measures for this 
operational aid are similar to the ones 
for the trolley travel limiting device and 
the boom hoist limiting device in 
proposed § 1926.1416(d)(1): The 
employer would have the option of 
clearly marking the cable at a point that 
would give the operator sufficient time 
to stop the boom hoist within the 
minimum and maximum boom radius 
or use a spotter. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(iii) would 

require an anti two-blocking device. 
This is comparable to the requirement 
for anti-two blocking devices for other 
cranes required by § 1926.1416. This 
operational aid would be required on 
tower cranes to prevent damage from 
contact between the load block, 
overhaul ball, or similar component, 
and the boom tip (or fixed upper block 
or similar component). Where the 
operational aid is not working properly, 
the employer would have the option of 
clearly marking the cable at a point that 
would give the operator sufficient time 
to stop the hoist to prevent two- 
blocking, or use a spotter. (See the 
discussion of the need for this type of 
device and rationale for including it as 
an operational aid above with respect to 
proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3)). 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(iv) would 

require a hoist drum lower limiting 
device. This proposed paragraph would 
require that tower cranes manufactured 
more than one year after the effective 
date of this standard be equipped with 
a device that prevents the last two 
wraps of hoist cable from being spooled 
off the drum. Such a device would 
prevent the entire rope from being 
spooled off the drum, which can cause 
the rope to separate (and the load to fall) 
from the drum due to the shock from the 
load suddenly stopping. 

OSHA notes that the C–DAC draft of 
this provision was mistakenly entitled, 
‘‘Hoist drum lowering device.’’ Since 
this device is a limiting device, the title 
has been changed in the proposed rule 
to, ‘‘Hoist drum lower limiting device.’’ 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(v) would 

require a load moment limiting device. 
‘‘Load moment (or rated capacity) 
limiter’’ is defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a 
system which aids the equipment 
operator by sensing the overturning 
moment on the equipment, i.e., load 
multiplied by radius. It compares this 
lifting condition to the equipment’s 
rated capacity, and when the rated 
capacity is reached, it shuts off power

to those equipment functions which can 
increase the severity of loading on the 
equipment, e.g., hoisting, telescoping 
out, or luffing out. Typically, those 
functions which decrease the severity of 
loading on the equipment remain 
operational, e.g., lowering, telescoping 
in, or luffing in.’’ As the definition 
indicates, this type of device detects and 
prevents a potential overload condition 
which could cause the load to fall, the 
crane to collapse or other failure of the 
crane. 

Where the load moment limiting 

device is not in proper working 
condition, two types of measures would 
be required. The first type of measure is 
designed to ensure that the operator 
determines the radius. If the crane is 
equipped with a radius indicating 
device, it would be required to be used. 
If the crane is not so equipped, the 
radius would be required to be 
measured (such as with a tape measure) 
to ensure that the load is within the 
rated capacity of the crane. 

The second type of measure is 

designed to ensure that the operator 
accurately determines the weight of the 
load. The load weight would be 
required to be determined from a 
reliable source (such as the load’s 
manufacturer), by a reliable calculation 
method (such as calculating a steel 
beam from measured dimensions and a 
known per foot weight), or by other 
equally reliable means. This information 
would be required to be provided to the 
operator prior to the lift. 

The C–DAC document refers to this 

device as a ‘‘load moment limit device.’’ 
OSHA has corrected this to ‘‘load 
moment limiting device.’’ 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(vi) would 
require a hoist line pull limiting device 
so that the load applied to the hoist 
drum will not exceed the hoist’s 
capacity. If the hoist is equipped with 
a multiple speed hoist transmission, the 
device would have to limit the hoist’s 
lifting capacity in each individual gear 
ratio. If the hoist line pull were to 
exceed the hoist’s capacity, the hoist 
could fail and unspool the line, causing 
the load to drop suddenly. Such a drop 
could cause a worker to be struck by the 
load. 

The temporary alternative measure for 

this operational aid would be that the 
operator would ensure that the weight 
of the load does not exceed the capacity 
of the hoist, taking into account each 
individual gear ratio if the crane is 
equipped with a multiple speed hoist 
transmission. For example, this could be 
done by the operator checking the hoist 
capacity in the equipment manual and 
verifying that the load will not exceed 
that capacity. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(vii) would 

require a rail travel limiting device in 
each direction to prevent the travel 
bogies from running into the end stops 
or buffers. As noted above, rail stops 
that keep the crane from overshooting 
the section of rail within which it is 
supposed to operate is one of the safety 
devices required for tower cranes that 
travel on rails. A rail travel limiting 
device is a device that limits the crane’s 
travel to keep a travel bogie from 
running into a rail stop. C–DAC 
believed that rail stops should not be 
the exclusive means of ensuring that the 
crane stays within its intended limits 
because the crane could jump the tracks 
if it were to strike the rail stops at a high 
enough speed. The temporary 
alternative to a rail travel limiting 
device that is not in proper working 
order would be to use a spotter when 
the crane is operated within 10 feet of 
a rail stop. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(5)(viii) would 

require the boom hoist drum to be 
equipped with a positive locking device. 
One example of such a device is a 
ratchet and pawl mechanism. The 
purpose of the device is to prevent the 
boom (and therefore the load as well) 
from inadvertently lowering. 

C–DAC intended that the device be 

able to be set from the operator’s station 
because it provided that the temporary 
alternative to a device that can be set 
from the operator’s station is to set the 
device manually when its use is 
required. However, neither the 
requirement for a device that can be set 
from the operator’s station nor the 
alternative of setting the device 
manually will help the operator lock the 
boom hoist drum if the device itself 
malfunctions. Accordingly, the Agency 
requests public comment on whether 
this provision should include a 
temporary measure that would be 
required if the positive locking device is 
not working properly (regardless of 
whether it is attempted to be set 
automatically or manually) and, if so, 
what temporary measure is available in 
such a situation. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(6) would 

require the category II operational aids 
discussed below and specifies the 
alternative measures that would have to 
be followed if they are not working 
properly. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(6)(i) would 
require a boom angle or hook radius 
indicator as specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1435(e)(6)(i)(A) and (B). Under 
these provisions, luffing boom tower 
cranes would be required to have a 
boom angle indicator readable from the 
operator’s station. Hammerhead tower 
cranes manufactured more than one

year after the effective date of this 
standard would be required to have a 
hook radius indicator readable from the 
operator’s station. These devices are 
needed because the information they 
provide is necessary for the operator to 
determine the crane’s capacity under its 
load chart. As with the similar devices 
required under § 1926.1416, the 
temporary alternative would be to 
measure the boom angle or hook radius 
with a measuring device (proposed 
§ 1926.1435(e)(6)(i)(C)). 

Proposed paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) through 

(iv) would require a trolley travel 
deceleration device, boom hoist 
deceleration device, and load hoist 
deceleration device. These devices 
reduce the speed of the trolley, boom 
and load as they approach certain 
limits. They prevent crane components 
from being subjected to the excessive 
stress that would result if the trolley, 
boom, or load were to run into a 
limiting device without slowing down. 
Such high stresses could cause a crane 
component to fail, which could cause 
unintended movement of the load, loss 
of the load, or damage/collapse of a 
component (and therefore struck-by 
injuries or fatalities). 

Proposed (e)(6)(ii) would require 
tower cranes to have a trolley travel 
deceleration device which would 
automatically reduce the trolley speed 
before the trolley reached the end limit 
in both directions. Proposed 
§ 1926.1435(e)(6)(iii) would require 
tower cranes to have a boom hoist 
deceleration device, which would 
automatically reduce the boom speed 
before a luffing boom reaches the 
minimum or maximum radius limit. 
Proposed § 1926.1435(e)(6)(iv) would 
require tower cranes to have a load hoist 
deceleration device, which would 
automatically limit the load speed 
before the load hoist reaches the upper 
limit. The temporary alternative 
measure for each of these operational 
aids would be for the operator to reduce 
the speed when approaching the limits. 

In specifying temporary alternative 

measures generally for operational aids, 
C–DAC sought to identify some measure 
in each instance that would assist the 
operator in performing the necessary 
task (in this case, slowing the action of 
a crane component before it reaches a 
limiting point). However, in the case of 
these deceleration devices, the 
Committee was unable to identify or 
develop that type of alternative 
measure. The Agency requests public 
comment on whether there are any such 
alternative measures that could be used 
in these instances. 

Proposed (e)(6)(v) would require 
tower cranes to have a device that

displays the wind speed, mounted 
above the upper rotating structure. On 
self-erecting cranes, which typically 
rotate at the tower base and do not have 
an ‘‘upper rotating superstructure,’’ it 
would have to be mounted at or above 
the jib level to be in a position to give 
a useful reading. 

As discussed under proposed 

§ 1926.1417 (Operation), paragraph 
§ 1926.1417(n) would require a 
competent person to consider the effect 
of wind (and other weather conditions) 
on equipment stability and rated 
capacity. Tower cranes are particularly 
susceptible to the effects of high wind, 
and knowledge of wind speed is needed 
so that the competent person can 
consider its effect on equipment 
stability and rated capacity. The 
temporary alternative measure would be 
for the wind speed to be obtained from 
a properly functioning device on 
another tower crane on the same site or 
to be estimated by a qualified person. 
Proposed paragraph 1435(e)(6)(vi) 

would require tower cranes 
manufactured more than one year after 
the effective date of this standard to 
have a device that displays the 
magnitude of the load that is on the 
hook. This could be either a separate 
device or one that is part of the load 
moment limiting device (discussed 
above) that displays the load that is on 
the hook. By informing the operator of 
the weight of the load, this device will 
help the operator ensure that the crane 
is operated within its rated capacity. 
The temporary alternative would be for 
the weight of the load to be determined 
from a reliable source (such as the load’s 
manufacturer), by a reliable calculation 
method (such as calculating a steel 
beam from measured dimensions and a 
known per foot weight), or by other 
equally reliable means. This information 
would be required to be provided to the 
operator prior to the lift. 
Paragraph 1435(f)

Inspections 

Under proposed paragraph (f)(1), 

§ 1926.1412 (Inspections) would apply 
to tower cranes except that the term 
‘‘assembly’’ would be replaced by 
‘‘erection’’ (the appropriate term for 
tower cranes). 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2) would 

supplement the requirement in 
proposed § 1926.1412(c). It would 
require that a load test be conducted as 
part of the post-erection inspection 
required by proposed § 1926.1412(c). 
The load test would have to be 
conducted using certified weights or 
weights that have been weighed on a 
calibrated scale (with a current 
certificate of calibration) (proposed 
§ 1926.1412(f)(2)(i)). The test would

have to be conducted in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s instructions or, 
if those are unavailable, in accordance 
with written procedures developed by a 
registered professional engineer familiar 
with the type of equipment involved 
(proposed § 1926.1412(f)(2)(ii)). This 
would help ensure that any significant 
problems or errors made during the 
erection process would be revealed 
prior to placing the crane in operation. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(3) would 

require that additional items be 
included in the monthly inspections of 
tower cranes. These include tower 
(mast) bolts and other structural bolts 
(for loose or dislodged condition) from 
the base of the tower up or, if the crane 
is tied to or braced by the structure, 
those above the upper-mast brace 
support (proposed § 1926.1435(f)(3(i)). 
The monthly inspection would also 
include the uppermost tie-in, braces, 
floor supports, and floor wedges where 
the tower crane is supported by the 
structure (proposed § 1926.1435(f)(3(i)), 
for loose or dislodged components. 
These items are critical to the stability 
of the crane, and C–DAC believed that 
a monthly inspection would uncover 
any deficiencies that would endanger 
the crane’s stability. 
Section 1436 Derricks 

This proposed section contains 

requirements for derricks that would 
supplement the other requirements of 
this standard. Currently, 29 CFR part 
1926 subpart N, at § 1926.550(e), 
requires derricks to meet the applicable 
requirements for design, construction, 
installation, inspection, testing, 
maintenance, and operation as 
prescribed in ANSI B30.6–1969, safety 
code for ‘‘Derricks,’’ as well as the 
general requirements of Subpart N 
applicable to all equipment. 

C–DAC’s review of injury and fatality 

statistics did not indicate a need to 
deviate significantly from the 
requirements of Subpart N. For the most 
part, the most recent version of the 
ANSI standard, ASME B30.6–2003, does 
not differ substantively from the 1969 
version insofar as the provisions 
discussed below are concerned, so the 
requirements of this section differ 
substantively from those of Subpart N in 
only limited respects. Where 
substantive differences exist, they are 
discussed in the context of that 
requirement. 
Paragraph 1436(a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) explains that 

this section contains supplemental 
requirements for derricks, whether 
temporarily or permanently mounted; 
all sections of this Subpart would apply 

to derricks unless specified otherwise. 
Proposed § 1926.1436(a) defines a 
derrick as powered equipment 
consisting of a mast or equivalent 
member that is held at or near the end 
by guys or braces, with or without a 
boom, and its hoisting mechanism. The 
mast/equivalent member and/or the 
load is moved by the hoisting 
mechanism (typically base-mounted) 
and operating ropes. Derricks include: 
A-frame, basket, breast, Chicago boom, 
gin pole (except gin poles used for 
erection of communication towers), guy, 
shearleg, stiffleg, and variations of such 
equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (a)’s exclusion of 

gin poles used for erection of 
communication towers mirrors the 
exclusion of such equipment from the 
scope of the standard under proposed 
§ 1926.1400(c)(12). As explained above 
in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1400(c)(12), gin poles used for 
erecting communication towers are 
excluded because the erection of 
communication towers is a highly 
specialized subset of the construction 
industry and involves interests and 
issues that go beyond the interests and 
issues C–DAC was designed to address. 
Paragraph 1436(b) Operation— 
Procedures 

Proposed paragraph (b)(1) states that 

§ 1926.1417 (Operation) of this 
proposed standard applies except for 
proposed § 1926.1417(c) (Accessibility 
of procedures). C–DAC believed that it 
was appropriate to keep the operation 
requirements for derricks consistent 
with those of cranes as much as possible 
because they both present many of the 
same hazards and operational issues. 
However, proposed § 1926.1417(c) 
would require the operating procedures, 
including load charts, to be located in 
‘‘the cab’’ of the equipment and derricks 
often do not have a cab. Therefore, that 
proposed requirement would not apply 
to derricks. Proposed § 1926.1436(b)(3), 
discussed below, sets forth requirements 
for accessibility of the load chart for 
derricks. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2), Load chart 

contents, would list what information 
must be included on load charts. 
Subpart N incorporated similar load 
chart requirements of section 6–1.1.2 in 
ANSI B30.6–1969, which remains the 
same in the ASME B30.6–2003 version 
of the consensus standard. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(i) would 

require the load chart to contain the 
rated capacity at corresponding ranges 
of boom angle or operating radii. This 
information is necessary to prevent 
overloading of the derrick.

Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) requires the load 

chart to list the specific lengths of 
components to which the rated 
capacities apply. This information is 
needed because the derrick’s load 
capacity varies with different 
component lengths. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii) would 

require the load chart to list parts for 
hoist reeving. By listing the reeving 
parts considered during the tabulation 
of available load charts, the employer 
can determine if available load charts 
are applicable to the configuration of the 
derrick at its work site. As with 
proposed § 1926.1436(b)(2)(i) and (ii), 
meeting this requirement would help 
prevent accidents that could occur 
resulting from errors in determining the 
equipment’s rated capacity. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(iv) would 

require the size and construction of rope 
to be included on the load chart or in 
the operating manual. This proposed 
requirement would prevent hoisting 
accidents that might occur if a rope fails 
because it was the wrong size or 
construction for the load being lifted. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(3), Load chart 
location, states where the required load 
charts must be kept. Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(b)(3)(i), Permanent 
installations, would require 
permanently installed derricks with 
fixed lengths of boom, guy, and mast, to 
have a load chart posted where it is 
visible to personnel responsible for the 
operation of the equipment. Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(b)(3)(ii), Non-permanent 
installations, requires derricks that are 
not permanently installed, to have the 
load chart readily available at the job 
site to personnel responsible for the 
operation of the equipment. These 
requirements would ensure that the 
critical information contained on these 
charts is available on the worksite to 
enable the employer to calculate the 
parameters of a safe lift. 
Paragraph 1436(c) Construction 
Proposed paragraph (c) contains 

supplemental engineering and 
fabrication requirements that address 
hazards specific to derricks. Proposed 
paragraph (c)(1), General requirements, 
would list general construction 
requirements that apply to the use of all 
types of derricks. The requirements that 
follow are similar to section 6–1.2.1 of 
ANSI B30.6–1969 and ASME B30.6– 
2003 and would help the employer 
prevent accidents caused by inadequate 
structural design and fabrication. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1)(i) states 
that derricks shall be constructed to 
meet all stresses imposed on members 
and components when installed and 
operated in accordance with the 

manufacturer’s/ builder’s procedures 
and within its rated capacity. ‘‘Builder’’ 
is defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘an 
employer builder/constructor of 
equipment.’’ This definition 
distinguishes a ‘‘builder’’ of equipment 
(an employer at the worksite where the 
derrick is erected) from a manufacturer, 
who sells products that may be used at 
any worksite. Section 
§ 1926.1436(c)(1)(i) uses the word 
‘‘builder’’ in addition to ‘‘manufacturer’’ 
because it will often be the builder’s 
procedures, rather than the 
manufacturer’s, that must be followed to 
ensure that derricks are constructed 
properly. This requirement is similar to 
section 6–1.2.1(a) of ANSI B30.6–1969 
and ASME B30.6–2003. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii) specifies 

that the welding of load sustaining 
members shall conform to 
recommended practices in ANSI/AWS 
D14.3–94 or D1.1–02. This latter 
provision is similar to section 6–1.2.1(b) 
of ASME B30.6–2003 and relies on 
newer welding standards than the 
corresponding requirement of ANSI 
B30.6–1969, which requires welding of 
critically stressed members to conform 
to AWS D2.0–66.78 These provisions 
would prevent structural failures when 
using the derrick within its rated 
capacity. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2), Guy 

derricks, lists additional requirements 
applicable to the construction of guy 
derricks. In addition, proposed 
§ 1926.1436(d), Anchoring and guying, 
contains requirements for anchoring and 
guying guy derricks. Both of these 
sections contain provisions that address 
the specifications for guys, and OSHA is 
concerned about whether placing 
related requirements in two different 
paragraphs could lead to confusion and 
impede compliance.79 Moreover, OSHA 
is concerned about whether proposed 
§ 1926.1436(c)(2) is worded in a way 
that clearly states its intent. OSHA 
requests public comment on whether 
these provisions need to be modified to 
provide clearer guidance and, if so, how 
they should be modified. A discussion 
of the issues these proposed paragraphs 
present follows. 

A guy derrick consists of a vertical, 

rotating mast anchored at its base and a 
boom connected to the bottom of the 
mast in such a way that the boom can 
pivot in a vertical plane, i.e., the angle 

78 The text of section 6–1.2.1(b) of ASME B30.6— 

2003 does not state the dates of the welding 
standards it incorporates. However, those dates are 
specified in section 6–0.3 of the ASME standard, 
and OSHA has added them to the text of 
§ 1926.1436(c)(1)(ii). 

79 A similar problem with the provisions on 

stiffleg derricks is discussed below.

between the boom and the mast can 
vary. The mast is supported at its top by 
guys that run from the mast to the 
surface on which the derrick is 
mounted. Factors such as the number, 
spacing, and angle of the guys, the 
material of which they are made, and 
the tension in the guys, affect whether 
the derrick is able to handle loads 
within its rated capacity. 

The following proposed provisions 

apply to guy derricks. 

(c) Construction 

* 

* 

* 

* 
(2) Guy derricks. 
(i) The minimum number of guys shall be 

* 

6, with equal spacing, except where a 
qualified person or derrick manufacturer 
approves variations from these requirements 
and revises the rated capacity to compensate 
for such variations. 

(ii) Guy derricks shall not be used unless 

the employer has the following guy 
information: 

(A) The number of guys. 
(B) The spacing around the mast. 
(C) The size, grade, and construction of 

rope to be used for each guy. 

(iii) For guy derricks manufactured after 

December 18, 1970, in addition to the 
information required in paragraph (ii), the 
employer shall have the following guy 
information: 

(A) The amount of initial sag or tension. 
(B) The amount of tension in guy line rope 

at anchor. 

(d) Anchoring and guying. 
(1) Load anchoring data developed by the 
manufacturer or a qualified person shall be 
used. 

(2) Guy derricks. 
(i) The mast base shall be anchored. 
(ii) The guys shall be secured to the ground 

or other firm anchorage. 

(iii) The anchorage and guying shall be 

designed to withstand maximum horizontal 
and vertical forces encountered when 
operating within rated capacity with the 
particular guy slope and spacing specified for 
the application. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(i) specifies 
that the minimum number of guys shall 
be 6, with equal spacing, except where 
a qualified person or derrick 
manufacturer approves variations from 
these requirements and revises the rated 
capacity to compensate for such 
variations. This requirement is 
comparable to section 6–1.2.2 of ANSI 
B30.6–1969 and ASME B30.6–2003. 
Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(ii) states 

that guy derricks shall not be used 
unless the employer has the following 
guy information: (A) The number of 
guys; (B) The spacing around the mast; 
and (C) The size, grade, and 
construction of rope to be used for each 
guy.

that for guy derricks manufactured after

information required in 
§ 1926.1436(c)(2)(ii), the employer shall 
have the following guy information: (A) 
The amount of initial sag or tension; and 
(B) The amount of tension in guy line 
rope at anchor. 

OSHA notes that proposed 

§ 1926.1436(c)(2)(ii) does not establish 
specifications an employer must follow 
when installing a guy derrick. They 
require only that the employer have the 
specified information on the guying 
used to install the derrick. 

The requirement of proposed 

§ 1926.1436(c)(2) that the derrick user 
possess certain guy information differs 
substantially from that found in the 
ANSI/ASME standards on which 
proposed § 1926.1436(c) is based. The 
corresponding ANSI/ASME provisions 
are section 6–1.2.2 of ANSI B 30.6–1969 
and ASME B30.6–2003, which require 
the derrick manufacturer to furnish 
complete information recommending 
the guy specifications listed in 
§ 1926.1436(c)(2)(ii).80 Thus, the ANSI/ 
ASME provisions impose a duty on 
derrick manufacturers to provide certain 
information and recommendations to 
their customers. The C–DAC provisions, 
by contrast, impose an obligation on 
derrick users to possess the information 
provided by the manufacturer. However, 
as drafted, proposed § 1926.1436(c)(2) 
does not require derrick users to follow 
the manufacturer’s recommendations on 
the listed guy specifications, only to 
have that information. 

In sum, proposed § 1926.1436(c) tells 

guy derrick users (1) that they must 
install a minimum of six guys with 
equal spacing, unless the derrick 
manufacturer or a qualified person 
approves variations from these 
requirements and revises the rated 
capacity accordingly, and (2) that they 
must have information on the number of 
guys and spacing, as well as the type of 
guy material used and, for newer 
derricks, the tension in the guys. 

The subject of guy installation is also 
addressed by proposed § 1926.1436(d). 
Proposed § 1926.1436(d)(1) requires the 
derrick user to use load anchoring data 
developed by the manufacturer (or a 
qualified person) to anchor the mast and 
install the guys. Under proposed 
§ 1926.1436(d)(2), the employer must 
use this data to (i) anchor the mast base; 
(ii) secure the guys to the ground or 
other firm anchorage; and (iii) install 
guying that will withstand the 
maximum horizontal and vertical forces 
encountered when operating within 

80 The 1969 version of the ANSI standard does 

not include the items in proposed 
§ 1926.1436(c)(2)(iii), but later versions of the B30.6 
standard, including the 2003 version, list those 
items. 

rated capacity with the particular guy 
slope and spacing specified for the 
application. Although this provision 
requires the employer to install guying 
that will enable the derrick to handle 
loads within its rated capacity and to 
use manufacturer’s (or a qualified 
person’s) data for this purpose, it does 
not explicitly require the employer to 
follow manufacturer recommendations 
on guying. Nor does it explicitly say that 
an employer who follows the 
manufacturer’s guying 
recommendations is in compliance. 

OSHA believes that, in many if not 
most cases in which guy derricks are 
used, the employer who uses the derrick 
will want to be able to rely on the 
manufacturer’s recommendations for 
number, spacing, angle, material, and 
tension of guys and that permitting 
employers to do so will promote safe 
use of such derricks. OSHA is 
concerned about whether the proposed 
C–DAC provisions clearly permit an 
employer to rely on such manufacturer 
recommendations.81 

OSHA requests public comment on 

whether and, if so how, any of these 
proposed provisions should be modified 
to make clear what information the 
derrick user must use when installing 
guys. For example, should the derrick 
user be required to use specifications 
provided by the manufacturer of the 
derrick (assuming such specifications 
are available from the manufacturer) on 
all of the topics listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1436(c)(2)(ii) and (iii)? 

OSHA further notes that the need for 

the ‘‘grandfathering’’ provision in 
proposed § 1926.1436(c)(2)(iii) is 
problematic. Although the 1969 ANSI 
B30.6 standard did not require 
manufacturers to provide information 
on sag and tension of guy line rope, 
proposed § 1926.1436(d)(1) 
contemplates that such information 
could be developed by a qualified 
person. OSHA therefore additionally 
requests public comment on whether 
the standard should require guy tension 
(as well as other guy specifications) to 
be developed by a qualified person if 
not available from the manufacturer. 
Proposed paragraph (c)(2)(iv) states 

that the mast base shall permit the mast 
to rotate freely with allowance for slight 
tilting of the mast caused by guy slack. 
Proposed § 1926.1436(c)(2)(v) requires 

81 The provisions do not explicitly permit the 

employer to rely on manufacturer recommendations 
and could be read not to permit reliance on such 
recommendations because the provisions on guy 
information, which would typically be provided by 
the manufacturer (proposed § 1926.1436(c)(2)(ii) 
and (iii)), and those on installing anchoring and 
guying (propose § 1926.1436(d)(1) and (2)), are 
found in different paragraphs and may therefore be 
read to be mutually exclusive. 

that the mast cap shall: (A) Permit the 
mast to rotate freely; (B) Withstand 
tilting and cramping caused by the guy 
loads; (C) Be secured to the mast to 
prevent disengagement during erection; 
and (D) Be provided with means for 
attaching guy ropes. These requirements 
track similar ones in sections 6–1.2.2(c) 
and (d) of ANSI B30.6–1969 and ASME 
B30.6–2003. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3), Stiffleg 

derricks, provides additional 
requirements specific to stiffleg derricks 
to help ensure their safe use. These 
requirements are comparable to those in 
section 6–1.2.3 of ANSI B30.6–1969 and 
ASME B30.6–2003. 

As with guy derricks, specifications 
for stiffleg derricks are found in both 
proposed § 1926.1436(c) and (d). Both 
paragraphs contain provisions dealing 
with the ability of stifflegs to withstand 
loads, and OSHA is concerned about the 
possibility for confusion if two different 
provisions address the same issue. The 
two provisions are: 

Proposed § 1926.1436(c)(3)(ii): The stifflegs 

shall be capable of withstanding the loads 
imposed at any point of operation within the 
load chart range. 

Proposed § 1926.1436(d)(3)(ii): The mast 

base and stifflegs shall be designed to 
withstand maximum horizontal and vertical 
forces encountered when operating within 
rated capacity with the particular stiffleg 
spacing and slope specified for the 
application. 

Even though these two provisions 

appear to be consistent with each other, 
there is always the possibility for 
confusion if two differently worded 
provisions address the same topic, and 
OSHA requests public comment on 
whether either or both of these 
provisions should be changed or deleted 
to avoid any such potential confusion. 
Proposed paragraph (c)(3)(i) would 
require that the mast be supported in 
the vertical position by at least two 
stifflegs; one end of each would have to 
be connected to the top of the mast and 
the other end securely anchored. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3)(ii) states 

that the stifflegs shall be capable of 
withstanding the loads imposed at any 
point of operation within the rated load 
chart range. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3)(iii) 

specifies that the mast base shall: (A) 
Permit the mast to rotate freely (when 
necessary); and (B) Permit deflection of 
the mast without binding. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3)(iv) states 
that the mast shall be prevented from 
lifting out of its socket when the mast 
is in tension. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(3)(v) requires 

the stiffleg connecting member at the 
top of the mast to: (A) Permit the mast

to rotate freely (when necessary); (B) 
Withstand the loads imposed by the 
action of the stifflegs; and (C) Be 
secured so as to oppose separating 
forces. 

Paragraph (c)(4), Gin pole derricks, 

contains additional requirements 
specific to gin pole derricks to help 
ensure their safe use. Similar 
requirements are found in section 6– 
1.2.4 of ASME B30.6–2003. ANSI B 
30.6–1969, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N, does not contain 
provisions specific to gin pole derricks. 
Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(i) provides 
that guy lines be sized and spaced so as 
to make the gin pole stable in both 
boomed and vertical positions. 
Exception: Where the size and/or 
spacing of guy lines do not result in the 
gin pole being stable in both boomed 
and vertical positions, the employer 
shall ensure that the derrick is not used 
in an unstable position. 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(ii) requires 

that the base of the gin pole permit 
movement of the pole (when necessary). 

Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(iii) would 
require the gin pole to be anchored at 
the base against horizontal forces (when 
such forces are present). 

Proposed paragraph (c)(5), Chicago 

boom derricks, states that the fittings for 
stepping the boom and for attaching the 
topping lift shall be arranged to: (i) 
Permit the derrick to swing at all 
permitted operating radii and mounting 
heights between fittings; (ii) 
Accommodate attachment to the upright 
member of the host structure; (iii) 
Withstand the forces applied when 
configured and operated in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s/builder’s 
procedures and within its rated 
capacity; and (iv) Prevent the boom or 
topping lift from lifting out under 
tensile forces. Similar requirements, 
which will help ensure that such 
derricks are used safely, are found in 
section 6–1.2.5 of ASME B30.6–2003. 
ANSI B 30.6–1969, which is 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N, 
does not contain specific requirements 
for Chicago boom derricks. 
Paragraph 1436(d) Anchoring and 
Guying 

Proposed paragraph (d) lists 

requirements for anchoring and guying 
derricks to the surfaces that support 
them. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(1) would 
require use of load anchoring data 
developed by the manufacturer or a 
qualified person. Currently, Subpart N, 
through incorporation of section 6–1.4.3 
of ANSI B30.6–1969, requires load 
anchoring data for non-permanent 
installations, which would include most

derricks used for construction work, to 
be determined by the user. The 2003 
version of ASME B30.6 requires the data 
to be determined by a qualified person. 
C–DAC believed that, to better ensure 
safety, a qualified person (as defined in 
proposed § 1926.1401) is needed to 
develop such data. The proposal affords 
the employer the additional flexibility 
of relying on data provided by the 
derrick manufacturer rather than relying 
exclusively on a qualified person to 
develop such data. 

For permanent fixed installations, the 

1969 ANSI standard requires load 
anchoring data to be provided by the 
derrick manufacturer, while the 2003 
version requires it to be provided by the 
owner. C–DAC believed that derrick 
users should be able to rely on data 
developed by the manufacturer or a 
qualified person for any type of 
installation and therefore did not 
distinguish between fixed and 
temporary installations for this purpose. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(2), Guy 

derricks, lists additional requirements, 
for anchoring and guying, that are 
specific to the use of guy derricks. These 
provisions are similar to section 6– 
1.4.1of ANSI B30.6–1969 and ASME 
B30.6–2003. These provisions are 
discussed above in connection with 
proposed § 1926.1436(c)(2). 

Proposed paragraph (d)(3), Stiffleg 
derricks, lists anchoring and guying 
requirements that are specific to the use 
of stiffleg derricks. The provisions in 
this paragraph are similar to section 6– 
1.4.2 in ANSI B30.6–1969 and ASME 
B30.6–2003. 

Proposed paragraph (d)(3)(i) would 

require the mast base and stifflegs to be 
anchored. Proposed paragraph (d)(3)(ii) 
would require the mast base and 
stifflegs to be designed to withstand 
maximum horizontal and vertical forces 
encountered when operating within 
rated capacity with the particular 
stiffleg spacing and slope specified for 
the application. This provision is 
discussed above in connection with 
proposed § 1926.1436(c)(3). 
Paragraph 1436(e) Swingers and Hoists 

Proposed paragraph (e) lists 

requirements for swinger mechanisms 
and hoists that are used as part of a 
derrick. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(1) would 

require that the boom, swinger 
mechanisms and hoists be suitable for 
the derrick work intended and be 
anchored to prevent displacement from 
the imposed loads. This provision is 
similar to section 6–1.5.1 of ANSI 
B30.6–1969 and section 6–1.5 of ASME 
B30.6–2003. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(2), Base- 

mounted drum hoists, would specify 
minimum requirements for hoists used 
for derricks. Currently, Subpart N has 
requirements for base-mounted drum 
hoists in 29 CFR 1926.553. These 
requirements apply to all base-mounted 
drum hoists used in construction, 
including those used for derricks. 

It should be noted that this 

rulemaking is limited to setting 
requirements for cranes and derricks, 
and therefore does not address the 
requirements in § 1926.553 for base- 
mounted drum hoists to the extent they 
apply beyond their use for derricks. 
Consequently, proposed 
§ 1926.1436(e)(2) would set 
requirements for base-mounted drum 
hoists only to the extent such hoists are 
used for derricks. Also note that the 
requirements in § 1926.553 for base- 
mounted drum hoists would no longer 
apply to such hoists used for derricks. 
To make this clear, this proposed rule 
would amend § 1926.553 by adding the 
following § 1926.1436(c) to that section 
and requests public comment on this 
proposed change: 

(c) This section does not apply to base- 
mounted drum hoists used in conjunction 
with derricks. Base-mounted drum hoists 
used in conjunction with derricks must 
conform to § 1926.1436(e). 

Section 1926.553 requires base- 
mounted drum hoists to meet the 
applicable requirements for design, 
construction, installation, testing, 
inspection, maintenance, and operations 
prescribed by the manufacturer. In 
addition, it imposes requirements to 
guard exposed moving parts, locate 
controls within easy reach of the 
operator’s station, and equip electric 
motor operated hoists with certain 
safety features. 

For such hoists used for derricks, 

instead of relying on a manufacturer’s 
recommendation for most requirements, 
proposed § 1926.1436(e)(2) incorporates 
by reference certain sections of ASME 
B30.7–2001, ‘‘Base Mounted Drum 
Hoists,’’ and sets forth specific 
requirements for load tests. 

Proposed paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) 

through (D) would require that base 
mounted drum hoists meet the 
requirements in the following sections 
of ASME B30.7–2001: 

(A) Sections 7–1.1 (Load ratings and 

markings). 

(B) Section 7–1.2 (Construction), except: 7– 

1.2.13 (Operator’s cab); 7–2.15 (Fire 
extinguishers) (Note: The requirements 
excluded by this proposed paragraph would 
be covered by the general fire extinguisher 
and operator’s cab requirements in 
§ 1926.1433(e)(6) and (7) of this proposed 
standard. Therefore, the incorporation by

reference of those requirements from ASME 
B30.7–2001 would be redundant.) 
(C) Section 7–1.3 (Installation). 
(D) Applicable terms in Section 7–0.2 

(Definitions). 

The requirements incorporated from 

section 7–1.2 include those for guarding 
exposed moving parts, locating controls 
within easy reach of the operator’s 
station, and equipping electric motor 
operated hoists with certain safety 
features. Comparable requirements are 
now found in § 1926.553. Section 7–1.2 
also contains a number of additional 
requirements from ASME B30.7, 
including requirements for hoist and 
swinger mechanisms, brakes, clutches, 
adjustments for brakes and clutches, 
ropes, prime mover controls, electric 
resistors and switches, and lubrication. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(ii), Load 

tests for new hoists, would require that 
the employer ensure that new hoists are 
load tested to a minimum of 110% of 
rated capacity, but not more than 125% 
of rated capacity, unless otherwise 
recommended by the manufacturer. 
This requirement is met where the 
manufacturer has conducted this 
testing. ASME B30.7–2001, in section 7– 
2.2.2(a), requires similar load testing but 
requires the test to be conducted by the 
manufacturer. OSHA recognizes that the 
manufacturer will usually be the party 
who conducts the test and allows the 
manufacturer to do so, but this proposal 
permits the test to be conducted by any 
party as long as it is performed 
correctly. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(iii), 

Repaired or modified hoists, would 
require that hoists which have had 
repairs, modifications or additions 
affecting their capacity or safe operation 
be evaluated by a qualified person to 
determine if a load test is necessary. If 
it is, load testing shall be conducted in 
accordance with § 1926.1436(e)(2)(ii) 
and (iv). This requirement parallels 
section 7–2.2.2(b)(1) of ASME B30.7– 
2001. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(iv), Load 
test procedure, would state that load 
tests required by § 1926.1436(e)(2)(ii) or 
(e)(2)(iii) shall be conducted in 
accordance with the requirements listed 
in § 1926.1436(e)(2)(iv)(A) to (C). 
Proposed § 1926.1436(e)(2)(iv)(A) would 
require that the test load be hoisted a 
vertical distance to assure that the load 
is supported by the hoist and held by 
the hoist brake(s). Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(e)(2)(iv)(B) provides that 
the test load shall be lowered, stopped 
and held with the brake(s). These 
specifications are comparable to those 
in section 7–2.2.2(b)(2) of ASME B30.7– 
2001.

Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C) states 

that the hoist shall not be used unless 
a competent person determines that the 
test has been passed.82 The requirement 
that a competent person determine 
whether a base-mounted drum hoist has 
passed a load test is consistent with the 
requirement, discussed below under 
proposed § 1926.1436(g), that a 
competent person determine whether a 
derrick has passed a load test. C–DAC 
believed that, to ensure that the load test 
is properly assessed, this determination 
needs to be made by a competent 
person. 
Paragraph 1436(f) Operational Aids 

Proposed paragraph (f) would specify 

the types of operational aids that must 
be used on derricks during construction 
activities. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(1) states that 

proposed § 1926.1416 (Operational aids) 
applies, except for § 1926.1416(d)(1) 
(Boom hoist limiting device), (e)(1) 
(Boom angle or radius indicator) and 
(e)(4) (Load weighing and similar 
devices). Under proposed 
§ 1926.1436(f)(1), two operational aids— 
an anti two-block device and a hoist 
drum rotation indicator (if the drum is 
not visible from the operator’s station)— 
would be required on a derrick 
manufactured more than one year after 
the effective date of this subpart. 
Neither is currently required under 29 
CFR part 1026 subpart N.83 The safety 
functions served by these operational 
aids are described above in the 
discussion of proposed § 1926.1416. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2), Boom angle 

aid, would require the employer to 
ensure that either: (i) The boom hoist 
cable is marked with caution and stop 
marks, corresponding to maximum and 
minimum allowable boom angles, that 
are within view of the operator or a 
spotter who is in direct communication 
with the operator, or (ii) an electronic or 
other device that signals the operator in 
time to prevent the boom from moving 
past its maximum and minimum angles, 
or automatically prevents such 
movement, is used. 

C–DAC discussed whether to require 

derricks to be equipped with boom 
angle indicators. Section 6–1.6.4 of 
ASME B30.6–2003 advises that derricks 
have such devices, stating that ‘‘Boom 
angle indicators should be provided and 

82 ASME B30.7–2001 does not specify who must 

determine if a hoist passes its load test. 

83 Other operational aids listed in § 1926.1416— 

a luffing jib limiting device, a jib angle indicator, 
a boom length indicator on equipment with a 
telescoping boom, and an outrigger position sensor/ 
monitor on equipment with outriggers—are 
required on equipment with components not 
possessed by derricks. 

be readable by the operator or the signal 
person, unless the derrick has one rating 
for all boom angles.’’ C–DAC believed 
that, instead of requiring such a device, 
marking the boom hoist cables to 
indicate maximum and minimum boom 
positions is a safe work practice that is 
routinely implemented by many derrick 
operators in the industry. 

The Committee also believed that the 

most recent accident data it reviewed 
did not indicate that this work practice 
was ineffective and concluded that 
requiring boom angle indicators would 
be an added cost to the industry with no 
significant impact on safety. The 
proposed standard therefore would 
require the employer either to mark the 
boom hoist lines or to use an electronic 
signaling device in lieu of using a boom 
angle indicator. 

OSHA notes that, as drafted by C– 

DAC, proposed § 1926.1436(f)(2) would 
require derrick users to take one of the 
two specified precautions even if the 
derrick is equipped with a boom angle 
indicator as suggested by ASME B30.6. 
It is the Agency’s understanding that C– 
DAC intended those precautions to be 
taken in lieu of requiring boom angle 
indicators and that they are not needed 
if the derrick has such a device. OSHA 
therefore requests public comment on 
whether it should modify 
§ 1926.1436(f)(2) by adding the words 
‘‘If the derrick is not equipped with a 
functioning boom angle indicator’’ so 
that it would read as follows: 

(2) Boom angle aid. If the derrick is not 
equipped with a functioning boom angle 
indicator, the employer shall ensure that 
either: 

(i) The boom hoist cable shall be marked 

with caution and stop marks. The stop marks 
shall correspond to maximum and minimum 
allowable boom angles. The caution and stop 
marks shall be in view of the operator, or a 
spotter who is in direct communication with 
the operator, or 

(ii) An electronic or other device that 

signals the operator in time to prevent the 
boom from moving past its maximum and 
minimum angles, or automatically prevents 
such movement, is used. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(3), Load 

weight/capacity devices, would require 
that derricks manufactured more than 
one year after the effective date of this 
Subpart with a maximum rated capacity 
over 6,000 pounds have at least one of 
the following: load weighing device, 
load moment indicator, rated capacity 
indicator, or rated capacity limiter. This 
paragraph would adopt for derricks a 
comparable requirement to that for 
cranes required by proposed 
§ 1926.1416(e)(4). However, the 
requirement for cranes applies to cranes 
manufactured after March 29, 2003.

That date was chosen for cranes because 
it was when ANSI B30.5 first required 
load weighing devices on all mobile 
cranes with a rated capacity over 6,000 
pounds. There is no comparable 
requirement for derricks in the ASME 
B30.6 standard. Since this proposed 
paragraph, if adopted, would impose a 
requirement not previously applied to 
derricks by an industry standard, C– 
DAC believed it is appropriate to allow 
one year after this standard becomes 
effective for new derricks to be 
equipped with such devices. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(3) sets 

temporary alternative measures that 
must be used when the load weight/ 
capacity device is not working properly. 
These temporary alternatives are the 
same as those required by proposed 
§ 1926.1416(e)(5) for equipment 
generally and under proposed 
§ 1926.1435(e)(6)(vi) for tower cranes 
specifically. Under § 1926.1416(e) and 
§ 1926.1435(e)(6), such a device is a 
category II operational aid and, as such, 
it must be repaired within 30 days if it 
is not working properly. OSHA requests 
comment on whether to apply that same 
30-day requirement, along with the 
exception if a part is ordered within 7 
days of the malfunction and not 
received in time to complete the repair 
within 30 days, to proposed 
§ 1926.1436(f)(3). 
Paragraph 1436(g) Post-Assembly 
Approval and Testing—New or 
Reinstalled Derricks 

Proposed paragraph (g) would list the 

minimum testing and approval 
requirements that an employer must 
meet to assure that its derrick will be 
structurally and functionally able to 
perform within the manufacturer’s 
specifications and recommendations. 
C–DAC believed that by meeting these 
minimum requirements, the employer 
would provide its workers with a safe 
derrick that will not endanger its 
workers during hoisting operations. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(1), 

Anchorages, would list minimum 
requirements for an anchor used to 
support a derrick. Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(g)(1)(i), would require that 
the anchorages, including the structure 
to which the derrick is attached (if 
applicable), be approved by a qualified 
person. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(1)(ii) would 

require the qualified person to 
determine if any special testing of the 
anchorage is needed when rock or 
hairpin anchorage are used. If so, it shall 
be tested accordingly. The provisions in 
proposed § 1926.1436(g)(1) are similar 
to what is required by Subpart N 
through its incorporation of section 6– 

2.2.1b in ANSI B30.6–1969 and also 
what is currently in section 6–2.2.1(b) in 
its newest revision, ASME B30.6– 
2003.84 These requirements would help 
the employer ensure that the derrick 
would not collapse due to insufficient 
anchoring and injure or kill workers 
who must use or be in the vicinity of the 
derrick. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(2), Functional 

test, would require that, prior to initial 
use, new or reinstalled derricks shall be 
tested by a competent person with no 
hook load to verify proper operation. 
Section 2.2.1a of ANSI B30.6–1969, 
incorporated in Subpart N, requires the 
employer to test the derrick to ensure 
that it can safely hoist and lower the 
load, boom up and down, swing left and 
right, and brake/control the speed of its 
hoist lines. The five provisions of this 
proposed paragraph are similar to 
section 6–2.2.1 of ASME B30.6–2003 
and would require, respectively, the 
following tests: (i) Lifting and lowering 
the hook(s) through the full range of 
hook travel; (ii) raising and lowering the 
boom through the full range of boom 
travel; (iii) swinging in each direction 
through the full range of swing; (iv) 
actuating the anti two-block and boom 
hoist limit devices (if provided); and (v) 
actuating locking, limiting and 
indicating devices (if provided). 

Proposed paragraph (g)(3), Load test, 
would require that, prior to initial use, 
new or reinstalled derricks shall be load 
tested by a competent person. Subpart N 
requires operational tests prior to initial 
use of all new and altered derricks 
through the incorporation of section 6– 
2.2.1 of ANSI B30.6–1969, but a load 
test is not explicitly required. C–DAC 
recommended that OSHA adopt the 
revised guidance provided in section 6– 
2.2.2 of ASME B30.6–2003, which 
includes a requirement to load test all 
new and reinstalled derricks prior to 
initial use and specifies the elements 
such a test should include. OSHA 
believes that compliance with the load 
test requirements listed below would 
help the employer identify defects in 
the derrick prior to its actual use. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(3)(i) would 
require that test loads shall be at least 
100% and no more than 110% of the 
rated capacity, unless otherwise 
recommended by the manufacturer or 
qualified person, but in no event shall 
the test load be less than the maximum 
anticipated load. 

84 This proposed paragraph differs from section 
6–2.2.1(b) of ASME B30.6–2003 in the following 
respect: The ASME section states that rock or 
hairpin anchorages ‘‘may require’’ special testing. 
C–DAC believed that it is necessary to explicitly 
require that a qualified person determine whether 
such testing is needed. 

Proposed paragraph (g)(3)(ii) would 
list minimum procedures that must be 
accomplished during the load testing. 
These are: (A) The test load be hoisted 
a few inches and held to verify that the 
load is supported by the derrick and 
held by the hoist brake(s); (B) the 
derrick must be swung, if applicable, 
the full range of its swing, at the 
maximum allowable working radius for 
the test load; (C) the derrick must be 
boomed up and down within the 
allowable working radius for the test 
load; and (D) the load must be lowered, 
stopped and held with the brake(s). 

Proposed paragraph (g)(3)(iii) would 

require that the derrick not be used 
unless the competent person determines 
that the test has been passed. 
Proposed paragraph (g)(4), 

Documentation, would require that tests 
conducted under this paragraph be 
documented. The document must 
contain the date, test results, and the 
name of the tester. The document shall 
be retained until the derrick is re-tested 
or dismantled, whichever occurs first. 
Because a load test meeting the criteria 
listed in the proposed standard is so 
important to the safe use of the derrick, 
C–DAC believed that documentation of 
the test was needed to show that the test 
had been conducted properly. Section 
6–2.2.2(a)(1) of ASME B30.6–2003 
similarly requires that a written report 
of the load test be prepared and 
maintained. 
Paragraph 1436(h) Load Testing 
Repaired or Modified Derricks 

Proposed paragraph (h) would require 

that derricks that have had repairs, 
modifications or additions affecting the 
derrick’s capacity or safe operation be 
evaluated by a qualified person to 
determine if a load test is necessary. If 
it is, load testing shall be conducted and 
documented in accordance with 
§ 1926.1436(g). Subpart N, through 
incorporation by reference of section 6– 
2.3.3 of ANSI B30.6–1969, Adjustments 
and Repairs, requires all replaced and 
repaired parts to have at least the 
original safety factor. However, there is 
no explicit requirement to load test the 
derricks after parts are repaired or 
replaced. ASME B30.6–2003 does 
address load testing of repaired, altered 
or modified derricks in its section 6– 
2.2.2(b), specifying that the need for 
such a test be determined by a qualified 
person. C–DAC recommended that load 
testing should be mandatory after a 
derrick has been repaired or modified. 
Such testing will help the employer 
identify safety defects in a repaired or 
modified derrick prior to its actual use. 

Paragraph 1436(i) [Reserved.] This 

proposed paragraph is reserved because

it is inconvenient for readers to 
determine whether ‘‘(i)’’ is being used as 
a letter or a roman numeral. 
Paragraph 1436(j) Power Failure 
Procedures 

Proposed paragraph (j) would require 

the derrick operator to safely stop 
operation if the power fails during 
operations and would list additional 
steps that must be taken. Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(j)(1) would require setting 
all brakes or locking devices. Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(j)(2) would require moving 
all clutch and other power controls to 
the off position. These steps would 
prevent inadvertent movement of the 
load during the power outage or upon 
restoration of power. These precautions 
are found in section 6–3.2.3(h) of ANSI 
B30.6–1969, which is incorporated by 
reference in Subpart N of this part, and 
are reiterated in ASME B30.6–2003. 
Paragraph 1436(k) Use of Winch Heads 
Proposed paragraph (k) would specify 
minimum requirements for the safe use 
of a winch during hoisting operations. 
Proposed paragraph (k)(1) would require 
that ropes not be handled on a winch 
head without the knowledge of the 
operator. Proposed § 1926.1436(k)(2) 
would require the operator to be within 
reach of the power unit control while a 
winch head is being used. These 
proposed requirements are in section 6– 
3.3.5 of ANSI B30.6–1969, which is 
incorporated by reference in Subpart N, 
and are continued in section 6–3.3.6 of 
ASME B30.6–2003. 

Paragraph 1436(l): [Reserved.] This 

proposed paragraph is reserved because 
it is inconvenient for readers to 
distinguish the letter ‘‘l’’ from the 
number ‘‘1.’’ 
Paragraph 1436(m) Securing the Boom 

Proposed paragraph (m) would list 

minimum requirements for ensuring the 
stability of a derrick’s boom at rest to 
prevent injuries and deaths that could 
occur if it inadvertently shifted or fell. 
Subpart N incorporates section 6–3.3.6 
of ANSI B30.6–1969, which contains 
similar requirements. ASME B30.6– 
2003 revised those provisions in its 
section 6–3.3.7, and C–DAC 
recommended that OSHA list elements 
of the updated consensus standard’s 
provisions in proposed 
§ 1926.1436(m)(1) and (2) below. 

Proposed paragraph (m)(1) would 
require that when the boom is being 
held in a fixed position, dogs, pawls, or 
other positive holding mechanisms on 
the boom hoist be engaged. Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(m)(2) would require that 
when taken out of service for 30 days or 
more, the boom be secured by one of the

following methods: (i) By laying down 
the boom; (ii) by securing the boom to 
a stationary member, as nearly under 
the head as possible, by attachment of 
a sling to the load block; (iii) for guy 
derricks, by lifting the boom to a vertical 
position and securing it to the mast; or 
(iv) for stiffleg derricks, by securing the 
boom against the stiffleg. 

The comparable ASME B30.6–2003 

provision (section 6–3.3.7) would 
require the boom to be secured when 
the derrick is ‘‘not in use.’’ C–DAC 
believed the intent of the ANSI 
provision was to require the boom to be 
secured when the derrick was not in 
service but thought the ASME wording 
could be misconstrued to mean that the 
boom had to be secured whenever the 
derrick was not in the process of lifting 
a load. To avoid misunderstanding and 
establish an objective requirement for 
when the boom had to be secured, C– 
DAC proposed that the boom be secured 
whenever the derrick was taken out of 
service for 30 days or more. 
Paragraph 1436(n) 

‘‘Jumping the derrick’’ is the practice 
of moving structural components of the 
derrick to different locations, such as to 
the upper floors as a building is 
constructed, and is essential to some 
construction activities. Proposed 
§ 1926.1436(n) would require that the 
process of jumping the derrick be 
supervised by the A/D (assembly/ 
disassembly) supervisor. As provided in 
§ 1926.1401, the A/D supervisor must 
either be a person who meets the criteria 
for both a competent person and a 
qualified person, or a competent person 
who is assisted by one or more qualified 
persons. 

As discussed above, proposed 

§ 1926.1436(g) would require a derrick 
to be load tested to confirm that the 
derrick and its support can withstand 
rated loads. C–DAC discussed whether 
load testing should be required when a 
derrick is jumped. Some members stated 
that load testing a derrick after it has 
been jumped would be unduly 
burdensome since it is often already 
difficult to locate loads heavy enough to 
meet the 100–110% of rated capacity 
requirement of the initial load test. C– 
DAC agreed that a jumped derrick need 
not be load tested and believed that the 
A/D supervisor could be relied upon to 
see that the jumped derrick is properly 
erected and anchored and complies 
with the applicable requirements of this 
proposed standard. OSHA is satisfied 
with C–DAC’s rationale and believes 
that giving the A/D supervisor the 
responsibility for supervising the 
jumping of a derrick will ensure that the 
jumped derrick is safe to use. 

Paragraph 1436(o) 

Proposed paragraph (o) would require 
that derrick operations be supervised by 
a competent person. Subpart N 
incorporates by reference section 6.3.1.1 
of ANSI B30.6–1969, which requires 
derrick operations to be directed by a 
designated individual. ASME B30.6– 
2003 contains a similar requirement, 
and both consensus standards specify 
the requirements and practices of that 
designated individual. OSHA believes 
its definition of competent person meets 
the objectives of the ANSI/ASME 
designated individual requirements to 
competently perform the specific duties 
involved in supervising derrick 
operations. The experience and 
knowledge possessed by the competent 
person and his/her ability to recognize 
and correct potential hazardous 
conditions will help ensure safety of 
derrick operations. 
Paragraph 1436(p)

Inspections 

Under proposed paragraph (p), the 
inspection requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1412 apply to derricks. In 
addition to the items that must be 
inspected under § 1926.1412, proposed 
§ 1926.1436(p) requires certain 
additional items to be inspected. These 
additional items, when combined with 
the items that must be inspected under 
§ 1926.1412, are consistent with ANSI 
B30.6–1969 and ASME B30.6–2003. 
Proposed paragraph (p)(1), Daily, 

would require the inspection of guys for 
proper tension. Guy wires are critical 
elements of the support system for 
derricks, and ANSI B30.6–1969 and 
ASME B30.6–2003 both require their 
daily inspection in section 6–2.1.2. 

Proposed paragraph (p)(2), Annual, 

contains two requirements. 

Proposed paragraph (p)(2)(i) would 
require the inspection of the gudgeon 
pin for cracks, wear, and distortion. 
This requirement is found in section 6– 
2.1.3 of ANSI B30.6–1969 and ASME 
B30.6–2003, which establish 
requirements for periodic inspections. 
Proposed paragraph (p)(2)(ii) would 

require foundation supports for 
continued ability to sustain the imposed 
loads. Since a derrick is more likely to 
remain stationary and supported by the 
same foundation throughout the 
duration of its use than the majority of 
the equipment covered by this standard, 
C–DAC believed it was necessary to 
require the foundation to be inspected 
annually in addition to the items 
specified in § 1926.1412 of this 
proposed standard. This requirement is 
similar to section 6–2.1.3(b) of ANSI 
B30.6–1969 and ASME B30.6–2003.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59859 

Paragraph 1436(q) 

Proposed paragraph (q) would state 

that § 1926.1427 (Operator qualification 
and certification) does not apply. As 
discussed in regard to § 1926.1427 
above, C–DAC paid considerable 
attention to the need for equipment 
operators to be well qualified to operate 
the equipment to which they are 
assigned, and the Committee concluded 
that crane operators need to be certified 
through an accredited testing process to 
ensure that they are sufficiently 
qualified. After discussing whether 
there should be a similar certification 
requirement for derrick operators, the 
Committee decided against 
recommending such a requirement. 

The Committee noted that there are 
no accredited testing criteria to use for 
testing of derrick operators nor are there 
nationally recognized accredited testing 
facilities readily available. C–DAC 
questioned whether testing providers 
would find it cost-effective to establish 
accredited testing programs for derrick 
operator certification in light of the 
relatively small number of derrick 
operators in the construction industry. 
C–DAC also believed it would be 
difficult to establish accredited testing 
programs for derrick operators, noting 
that most training for derricks must be 
site specific because the types of 
derricks used, their support structures, 
and the hazards associated with specific 
projects vary from company to 
company. Moreover, the accident 
investigation data reviewed by C–DAC 
did not indicate that there was a need 
to require derrick operators to meet 
certification requirements similar to 
those proposed for crane operators. 
Training 

testing, maintenance, and operation 
(proposed § 1926.550(f)(2)(iii)). The 
Committee believed that greater clarity 
and specificity, along with some 
additional safety requirements, would 
improve safety by more effectively 
addressing the unique hazards in the 
marine construction environment. Of 
special concern to the Committee were 
drowning incidents from cranes 
overturning from or sliding off vessels 
and the hazardous effects of wind, water 
and the marine environment on 
equipment and operations. 

Section 1926.1437 covers two types of 

equipment in a marine environment: 
Those manufactured as a combination 
crane/derrick and vessel, and 
equipment designed to operate on land 
but used on a means of flotation, such 
as a vessel. The first type is referred to 
as ‘‘floating cranes/derricks,’’ which are 
defined in § 1926.1401, Definitions, as 
‘‘equipment designed by the 
manufacturer (or employer) for marine 
use by permanent attachment to a barge, 
pontoons, vessel, or other means of 
flotation.’’ ‘‘Land cranes/derricks’’ are 
defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘equipment 
not originally designed by the 
manufacturer for marine use by 
permanent attachment to barges, 
pontoons, vessels, or other means of 
flotation.’’ 

Most provisions of this section apply 

to both floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes/derricks used on barges, 
pontoons, vessels or other means of 
flotation. Proposed § 1926.1437(m) 
applies only to floating cranes/derricks, 
and proposed § 1926.1437(n) only to 
land cranes/derricks used on barges, 
pontoons, vessels or other means of 
flotation. 
Paragraph 1437(a) 

In reviewing the C–DAC language of 

proposed § 1926.1430, Training and 
§ 1926.1436, Derricks, the Agency 
realized that C–DAC did not specify any 
training requirements for derrick 
operators, which OSHA believes was an 
inadvertent omission. The Agency is 
planning to add such a requirement, 
such as a provision that would require 
that derrick operators be trained ‘‘on the 
safe operation of the equipment the 
operator will be using.’’ OSHA requests 
public comment on this issue. 
Section 1437 Floating Cranes/Derricks 
and Land Cranes/Derricks on Barges 

Currently, § 1926.550(f) of Subpart N 
includes limited requirements specific 
to floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes attached to a vessel. The current 
requirements are broadly written and 
incorporate manufacturer’s guidelines 
for design, construction, installation,

Proposed paragraph (a) specifies that 

the requirements of § 1926.1437 are 
supplemental requirements and, 
therefore, all other requirements of this 
proposed subpart would continue to 
apply unless specifically noted 
otherwise. Proposed § 1926.1437(a) 
would specifically exempt equipment 
operating on jacked barges in certain 
circumstances from the requirements of 
§ 1926.1437. The barges would be 
exempted when the jacks are deployed 
to the river/lake/sea bed and the barge 
is fully supported by the jacks. 

The Committee explained that a 

jacked barge deployed in this manner 
has four ‘‘spuds’’ on its corners that are 
grounded into the sea-bottom, providing 
a level and stable platform on which 
employees work. This results in work 
conditions similar to a crane working on 
land and unlike the work conditions 
pertinent to equipment covered by this 

section. Therefore, equipment used on a 
jacked barge deployed in this manner 
would be subject to all other applicable 
requirements of this proposed Subpart 
and not the requirements of this section. 

The C–DAC consensus document, at 

§ 1926.1437(a), states that, ‘‘The 
requirements of this section do not 
apply to jacked barges. * * *’’ To 
clarify that this sentence pertains to 
situations when equipment is used on a 
jacked barge, the Agency has modified 
the language for the proposed rule to 
now read: ‘‘The requirements of this 
section do not apply when using jacked 
barges when the jacks are deployed to 
the river/lake/sea bed and the barge is 
fully supported by the jacks.’’ 

Proposed § 1926.1437(a) of the C– 
DAC draft states that, ‘‘This section 
contains supplemental requirements for 
floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons, 
vessels or other means of flotation; all 
sections of this Subpart apply to floating 
cranes/derricks and land cranes/ 
derricks on barges, pontoons, vessels or 
other means of flotation, unless 
specified otherwise.’’ At various points 
in proposed § 1926.1437, the phrase 
‘‘vessels/flotation devices’’ is used 
synonymously with ‘‘barges, pontoons, 
vessels or other means of flotation.’’ To 
make it clear that these two phrases 
mean the same thing, the Agency has 
modified the first sentence of proposed 
§ 1926.1437(a) to read as follows: ‘‘This 
section contains supplemental 
requirements for floating cranes/ 
derricks and land cranes/derricks on 
barges, pontoons, vessels or other means 
of flotation (vessels/flotation devices); 
all sections of this Subpart apply to 
floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes/derricks on barges, pontoons, 
vessels or other means of flotation, 
unless specified otherwise.’’ 

Some paragraphs of proposed 

§ 1926.1437 in the C–DAC draft employ 
other phrases to mean the same thing as 
‘‘barges, pontoons, vessels or other 
means of flotation (vessels/flotation 
devices).’’ For example, proposed 
§ 1926.1437(h)(2) uses the phrase 
‘‘vessel/means of flotation.’’ The Agency 
has identified a number of such 
paragraphs and, to avoid ambiguity, has 
modified the language of proposed 
§ 1926.1437 to use either the phrase 
‘‘barges, pontoons, vessels or other 
means of flotation’’ or ‘‘vessel/flotation 
device’’ in the following proposed 
paragraphs: §§ 1926.1437(e)(1), 
1926.1437(h)(2), 1926.1437(j)(4), 
1926.1437(n)(3)(i), 1926.1437(n)(5)(i), 
1926.1437(n)(5)(iv)(B), and 
1926.1437(n)(5)(iv)(C).

59860 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Paragraph 1437(b) General 
Requirements 

Proposed paragraph (b) specifies that 

proposed § 1926.1437(c)–(k) apply to 
both floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes/derricks mounted on barges, 
pontoons, vessels, or other means of 
flotation. As noted above and discussed 
below, proposed § 1926.1437(m) would 
apply only to floating cranes/derricks, 
and proposed § 1926.1437(n) only to 
land cranes/derricks mounted on 
vessels/flotation devices. 
Paragraph 1437(c) Work Area Control 
Proposed paragraph (c) provides that 
the requirements of § 1926.1424, Work 
area control, applies to equipment 
covered by this section, except for the 
requirements of § 1926.1424(a)(2)(ii). 
Section 1926.1437(c)(2) of this section 
closely parallels § 1926.1424(a)(2)(ii) but 
dispenses with the requirement that the 
employer demonstrate infeasibility in 
order to use a combination of warning 
signs and high visibility markings in 
place of erecting and maintaining 
control lines, warning lines, railings, or 
similar boundaries of hazard areas. 
Because equipment covered by this 
section operates within limited physical 
work space, the Committee believed that 
employers need increased flexibility in 
determining which work area control 
method is most appropriate in light of 
special site-specific circumstances. To 
ensure that employees are adequately 
protected if the employer uses high 
visibility markings to supplement 
warning signs, this paragraph would 
require that the employer train 
employees to understand the meaning of 
the markings. 
Paragraph 1437(d) Keeping Clear of 
the Load 

Proposed paragraph (d) states that the 
requirements of proposed § 1926.1425, 
Keeping Clear of the Load, do not apply 
to the equipment covered by 
§ 1926.1437. Due to the limited space 
available for equipment on worksites 
covered by this section (i.e., the decks 
of barges and other vessels), the 
Committee determined that the 
requirements of § 1926.1425 are 
infeasible in these worksite 
environments. 
Paragraph 1437(e) Additional Safety 
Devices 

Proposed paragraph (e) lists 

additional safety devices required for 
equipment covered by this section. 
Equipment covered by § 1926.1437 
would also be required to have the 
safety devices listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1415, Safety Devices, unless 
otherwise noted in § 1926.1415. The

additional safety devices required by 
proposed § 1926.1437(e) reflect the 
special conditions of a marine worksite, 
especially with respect to vessel 
stability, inadvertent movement due to 
water conditions, and the greater effect 
of wind and other environmental 
conditions on equipment operating at 
these sites. However, note that 
§ 1926.1415 would exempt floating 
cranes/derricks and land cranes/ 
derricks on barges, pontoons, vessels, or 
other means of flotation from having 
crane level indicators and floating 
cranes from having foot pedal brake 
locks. See the discussion above of 
§ 1926.1415(a)(1)(iii) and (a)(4). 

Proposed paragraph (e)(1) would 

require that equipment covered by this 
section have a barge, pontoon, vessel or 
other means of flotation, list and trim 
device. The Committee believed that it 
is necessary to have this device since it 
allows an operator to have a reading of 
the current list and trim of the vessel. 
Since the degrees of list and trim are 
directly related to the stability of the 
vessel/flotation device and therefore to 
the stability of the equipment and its 
operation, the Committee believed it 
necessary to define these two terms for 
clarity. Proposed § 1926.1401 defines 
‘‘list’’ as ‘‘the angle of inclination about 
the longitudinal axis of a barge, 
pontoon, vessel, or other means of 
flotation.’’ ‘‘Trim’’ is defined in 
proposed § 1926.1401 as ‘‘the angle of 
inclination about the transverse axis of 
a barge, pontoon, vessel, or other means 
of flotation.’’ (Note that proposed 
§ 1926.1437 includes requirements 
related to the maximum degrees of list 
and trim that can exist when equipment 
is used on marine worksites.) The list 
and trim device required by this 
proposed paragraph is needed to inform 
the operator during an operation 
whether environmental conditions have 
changed to affect list or trim and how 
the movement of the load is affecting or 
may affect the stability of the vessel. 
Based on this information, the 
equipment operator can make any 
necessary adjustments to keep the 
equipment within required parameters. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(2) would 

require that equipment covered in this 
section have a horn. The sounding of a 
crane’s horn is commonly understood in 
the marine segment of the industry as a 
warning to employees. 

Proposed paragraph (e)(3) would 

require that all equipment with a 
rotating superstructure have a positive 
crane house lock. The Committee 
indicated that this device is necessary 
for equipment covered within this 
section because it positively locks the 
rotating superstructure. The lock 

provides additional protection from the 
superstructure’s unintended movement 
that can result due to the action of wind, 
waves, or current. 

Because the speed and direction of 

the wind can directly affect equipment 
operations, such as by diminishing 
equipment capacity and inducing 
unintended movement of the load, 
proposed § 1926.1437(e)(4) would 
require that equipment covered by this 
section have and use a wind speed and 
direction indicator when a competent 
person determines that wind is a factor 
that needs to be considered during 
operations. 
Paragraph 1437(f) Operational Aids 
Proposed paragraph (f) modifies the 

application of some of the proposed 
requirements in proposed § 1926.1416, 
Operational Aids, for equipment 
covered by this section. Apart from 
these specific differences, in all other 
respects proposed § 1926.1416 would 
apply to equipment covered by this 
section. 

Paragraph (f)(1) would require that 
equipment covered by this section be 
equipped with an anti two-block device 
only when hoisting personnel or when 
hoisting over an occupied cofferdam or 
shaft. As discussed above with respect 
to proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3), two- 
blocking can result in a sudden drop of 
the load on the line. Anti two-block 
devices protect against this danger. 
However, the Committee determined 
that anti two-blocking devices have a 
high rate of failure in a marine 
environment due to wind and other 
environmental factors. Also, the 
equipment covered by this section is 
often performing live boom/fast-moving 
functions, causing an anti-two-block 
device to consistently malfunction. 
Therefore, C–DAC proposed to only 
require the use of the anti two-block 
devices when hoisting personnel or 
hoisting over an occupied cofferdam or 
shaft due to the additional risk to 
employees during these operations. 

Proposed paragraph (f)(2) specifies 

that employers using equipment to 
perform dragline, clamshell (grapple), 
magnet, drop ball, container handling, 
concrete bucket, and pile driving work 
covered by this section, would be 
exempt from the requirements of 
proposed § 1926.1416(e)(4), Load 
weighing and similar devices. These 
operations add heavy loads and 
repetitive motion to the marine 
characteristics described above. As a 
result, load weighing devices used 
during these operations consistently 
malfunction. Additionally, the listing 
and tilting that is typical in marine

worksites often prevents these devices 
from providing accurate load readings. 
Paragraph 1437(g) Accessibility of 
Procedures Applicable to Equipment 
Operation 

Proposed paragraph (g) sets forth a set 

of requirements regarding accessibility 
of equipment operation procedures. The 
provision is split into different 
requirements based on whether the 
equipment has a cab. If the equipment 
covered by this section has a cab, the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1417(c), Operation—accessibility 
of procedures, would apply. If the 
equipment covered by this section does 
not have a cab, proposed 
§ 1926.1437(g)(1) and (g)(2) of this 
section would apply. 

During the C–DAC negotiations, 

individuals from the marine 
construction industry addressed the 
Committee and emphasized the 
importance of load charts being located 
where the operator is stationed. Under 
proposed § 1926.1437(g)(1), if the 
operator’s station is movable, such as 
with pendant-controlled equipment, the 
load chart must be posted on the 
equipment. Under proposed 
§ 1926.1437(g)(2), the remaining 
procedures (other than load charts) 
would be required to be readily 
available on board. Where there is no 
cab for the equipment, it is impractical 
to require these other procedures to be 
next to the operator; however, it is still 
necessary for the operator to have easy 
access to these procedures for reference, 
if necessary, during operations. 
Paragraph 1437(h)
Inspections 

Proposed paragraph (h) sets forth 
additional inspection requirements 
applicable to equipment covered by this 
section. It states that § 1926.1412, 
Inspections, applies to the inspection of 
the crane/derrick. The additional 
inspection requirements in this 
paragraph apply to the vessel/flotation 
device that supports the crane/derrick. 

The Agency notes that there is a 
discrepancy between two proposed 
paragraphs of § 1926.1437. Paragraph (b) 
of the C–DAC Consensus Document 
specifies that the requirements of 
proposed § 1926.1437(c)—(k), which 
include proposed § 1926.1437(h), apply 
to both floating cranes/derricks and land 
cranes/derricks mounted on barges, 
pontoons, vessels, or other means of 
flotation. Proposed § 1926.1437(h), as 
drafted by C–DAC, contains provisions 
for inspecting vessel-related items only 
for land cranes/derricks mounted on 
barges, pontoons, vessels, or other 
means of flotation, but not for floating 
cranes/derricks.

OSHA believes that C–DAC intended 
the vessel-related inspections to apply 
to all the equipment covered by this 
section and is changing the introductory 
sentence of this paragraph to read: ‘‘In 
addition to meeting the requirements of 
§ 1926.1412 for inspecting the crane/ 
derrick, the employer shall ensure that 
the vessel/means of flotation used to 
support a floating crane/derrick or land 
crane/derrick is inspected as follows.’’ 
The Agency requests public comment 
on this change. 

The Committee’s discussions 

regarding § 1926.1437(h) were extensive 
and focused on three aspects of 
inspection of vessels/means of flotation: 
(1) Who would conduct the inspection 
of the equipment; (2) what would the 
equipment be inspected for; and (3) how 
often. 

The Committee believed that 

inspections need to be required at four 
distinct times: Each shift, each month, 
annually, and quadrennially. The 
Committee determined that a competent 
person (see proposed § 1926.1401, 
Definitions) needs to conduct the shift 
and monthly inspections. If the 
competent person identifies one or more 
deficiencies, an immediate 
determination by a qualified person (see 
proposed § 1926.1401, Definitions) 
would be required to determine if the 
deficiency constitutes a hazard. If the 
deficiency constitutes a hazard, the 
vessel would have to be removed from 
service until the deficiency is corrected. 

The Agency notes that the C–DAC 

draft of § 1926.1437(h)(3) refers to ‘‘The 
daily and monthly inspections * * *’’ 
To be consistent with the usage 
throughout this proposed rule, the 
reference to ‘‘daily’’ inspections has 
been changed to ‘‘shift’’ inspections. 
Therefore, the proposed rule reads: 
‘‘The shift and monthly inspections 
* * *’’ 

The Committee indicated that the 

conditions listed under the 
requirements of shift and monthly 
inspections are easily identifiable to a 
competent person with respect to a 
vessel or other means of flotation and 
did not necessitate a more extensive 
professional knowledge of vessel 
deficiencies. Therefore, a competent 
person would be required to conduct 
shift and monthly inspections. 

Under this proposed paragraph, a 

qualified person would have to 
determine if the identified deficiency 
constitutes a hazard. This differs from 
the shift and monthly general inspection 
provisions of proposed § 1926.1412, in 
which the competent person who 
identified a deficiency would then 
determine whether the deficiency was a 
safety hazard requiring immediate 

correction. The reason for this 
difference is that that this is a highly 
specialized area and the judgments 
involved require a very high level of 
knowledge and ability. 

With respect to the annual 

inspections, proposed § 1926.1437(h)(4) 
would require the equipment and 
vessel/flotation device to be inspected 
by a qualified person with expertise 
with respect to vessels/flotation devices. 
The Committee believed it is important 
to explicitly state that the qualified 
person conducting these inspections 
must have the necessary expertise with 
respect to barges, pontoons, vessels or 
other means of flotation for the items 
listed for the annual inspection. 

The qualified person required in the 

shift and monthly inspections must 
have expertise with respect to the nature 
of the work conditions, the crane/ 
derrick and the vessel/flotation device. 
(See § 1926.1401, Definitions—Qualified 
person.) However, the annual inspection 
is more extensive than the shift or 
monthly inspections. As a result, the 
Committee chose to clearly specify that 
the qualified person for the annual 
inspection must have a greater level of 
expertise than that of the qualified 
person required for determining 
whether deficiencies identified in shift 
and monthly inspections constitute 
hazards. The qualified person for the 
annual inspection must have the level of 
expertise for all the areas covered by the 
annual inspection in addition to general 
expertise regarding the equipment and 
vessel/flotation device. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(5) would 

require quadrennial inspections of the 
internal portion of the barge, pontoons, 
vessel, or other means of flotation by a 
marine engineer, marine architect, 
licensed surveyor, or other qualified 
person who has expertise with respect 
to vessels/flotation devices. As with the 
qualified person performing an annual 
inspection, C–DAC chose to emphasize 
the higher level of expertise necessary 
for performing the quadrennial 
inspection. By listing ‘‘other qualified 
person’’ together with ‘‘marine 
engineer,’’ ‘‘marine architect,’’ and 
‘‘licensed surveyor,’’ C–DAC intended 
to make clear that the expertise of the 
‘‘other qualified person’’ would need to 
be equivalent to that of a marine 
engineer, marine architect, or licensed 
surveyor. 

Proposed § 1926.1437(h) specifies the 

items that would have to be inspected 
under the shift, monthly, and annual 
inspections. C–DAC used ASME B30.8– 
1999, ‘‘Floating Cranes and Floating 
Derricks,’’ specifically section 2.1 of 
B30.8, as a basis for developing the

inspection list.85 However, the 
Committee did not set forth a specified 
list of inspection items to be checked in 
the quadrennial survey of the internal 
portion of the vessel/flotation device, 
instead deferring to the expert 
knowledge of the marine engineer, 
marine architect, licensed surveyor, or 
other qualified person who has 
expertise with respect to vessels/ 
flotation devices. The Committee chose 
a once-every-four-year time period for 
surveying the internal portion of a 
vessel/flotation device based on the 
comments of individuals from the 
marine construction industry that this 
frequency reflects the prevailing 
industry practice and provides adequate 
safety. 

Proposed paragraph (h)(6) sets forth 

the documentation requirements for the 
monthly, annual, and quadrennial 
inspections, which follow those in 
proposed § 1926.1412, Inspections, at 
§ 1926.1412(e)(3) and (f)(7). However, 
with respect to the quadrennial 
inspections the written documentation 
of the inspection would have to be 
maintained for four years. This would 
enable the employer to track changes in 
the condition of the vessel from the 
previous inspection. 
Paragraph 1437(i)

[Reserved.] 

Paragraph (i) is reserved because it is 

inconvenient for readers to determine 
whether ‘‘i’’ is being used as a letter or 
a roman numeral. 
Paragraph 1437(j) Working With a 
Diver 

Proposed paragraph (j) sets forth 

supplemental requirements designed to 
ensure that a diver is hoisted safely from 
the vessel and back when equipment 
covered by this section is used to move 
a diver to and from the water. Extra 
precautions and measures are needed 
when engaged in this activity due to the 
drowning, struck-by, crushed-by, and 
other hazards involved in this activity. 

Marine environments and the 

condition of a diver can change quickly 
and unexpectedly; the operator must be 
constantly aware of the diving operation 
and in position to take immediate action 
when necessary. Therefore, under 
proposed § 1926.1437(j)(1), when one or 
more divers are being hoisted into and 
out of the water, the employer would be 
prohibited from using the equipment for 
any other purpose until all divers have 
returned back on board. This would 
ensure that the operator’s attention is 
not diverted from the welfare of the 

85 The 1999 version of ASME B30.8 has since 

been superseded by a 2004 version. The list of items 
to be inspected in section 2.1 is the same in both 
versions.

divers. Proposed § 1926.1437(j)(2) 
would require the equipment operator 
to remain at the equipment controls the 
entire time. This would ensure that the 
operator can respond as necessary. 
Proposed paragraph (j)(3) would 

require that, in addition to the signal 
requirements in proposed §§ 1926.1419– 
1422, the diver tender must be in direct 
communication with the equipment 
operator. This communication may be 
done either through maintaining a clear 
line of sight between the operator and 
tender or by electronic transmission 
between the operator and tender. As 
defined in proposed § 1926.1401, a 
‘‘tender’’ is the individual responsible 
for monitoring and communicating with 
the diver. The Committee determined it 
was necessary to define tender since 
that person is critical to effective 
communication with the equipment 
operator during an operation with a 
diver. In this section, the diver tender is 
required to maintain effective 
communication with the equipment 
operator when the equipment is used to 
get the diver in and out of the water. 
The tender is the member of the dive 
team who closely monitors the diver’s 
condition during the dive and checks 
the equipment prior to the dive. 
Therefore, the tender is able to let the 
operator know when a diver needs to be 
lifted out of the water or when other 
action by the crane is needed. 

Proposed paragraph (j)(4) specifies 

that when using a crane/derrick to hoist 
a diver, the crane/derrick must be 
secured in such a way that there is no 
amount of shifting in any direction. The 
Committee determined that even a small 
shift of a crane/derrick on a barge can 
result in unintended movement that can 
injure the diver. 

OSHA notes that proposed 

§ 1926.1431, Hoisting Personnel, applies 
when a crane/derrick is used to hoist 
personnel. In most instances when 
personnel are hoisted, they must be 
located in a personnel platform that 
meets criteria specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1431. However, proposed 
§ 1926.1431(b)(2) contains exceptions to 
the need to use a personnel platform 
and one such exception, in 
§ 1926.1431(b)(2)(iii), applies when an 
employer transfers an employee to or 
from a marine worksite in a marine 
hoisted personnel transfer device. 
Under the definition in proposed 
§ 1926.1401, ‘‘marine worksite’’ 
includes a worksite in the water, so the 
exception to the requirement to use a 
personnel platform in proposed 
§ 1926.1431(b)(2)(iii) would apply when 
a diver is hoisted into or out of the 
water in a marine hoisted personnel 
transfer device. 

Paragraph 1437(k) 

Proposed paragraph (k) would require 

the employer to adhere to the 
specifications and limitations 
established by the manufacturer of the 
barge, pontoon, vessel, or other means 
of flotation with respect to imposed 
environmental, operational, and in- 
transit loads. The purpose of this 
provision is to ensure that the 
equipment can operate safely under the 
forces imposed on it. The Committee 
believed that the manufacturer is in the 
best position to determine the maximum 
external loads the vessel/flotation 
device can withstand while maintaining 
the necessary stability and buoyancy 
and that the necessary protection would 
be provided by requiring employers to 
adhere to the manufacturer’s 
specifications and limitations. 

The text developed by C–DAC reads: 
(k) The barge, pontoons, vessel or other 

means of flotation shall be capable of 
withstanding imposed environmental, 
operational and in-transit loads under 
conditions specified by its manufacturer. 

Upon reviewing this language, OSHA 

believes it does not clearly convey 
C–DAC’s intent to place a duty on the 
employer who uses the equipment to 
comply with the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. The Agency has 
therefore modified this proposed 
paragraph to read: 

(k) The employer shall ensure that the 

manufacturer’s specifications and limitations 
with respect to environmental, operational, 
and in-transit loads for a barge, pontoon, 
vessel, or other means of flotation are not 
exceeded or violated. 

OSHA requests public comment on 

this change. 
Paragraph 1437(l)

[Reserved.] 

Paragraph (l) is reserved because it is 
inconvenient for readers to distinguish 
the letter ‘‘l’’ from the number ‘‘1.’’ 
Paragraph 1437(m) Floating Cranes/ 
Derricks 

Proposed paragraph (m) sets forth 

requirements with respect to load 
charts, rated capacity, allowable list, 
allowable trim, wind speed and related 
measures for floating cranes/derricks. 

The requirements set forth in 

§ 1926.1437(m)(1) through (5) address 
the various hazards which can 
contribute to instability of the vessel/ 
flotation device and the effect of marine 
conditions that can lead to boom/ 
equipment failure. 

As defined in proposed § 1926.1401, a 

floating crane/derrick may be built 
either by a manufacturer or by the 
employer who uses the equipment. Both 
types would have to meet the criteria in

proposed § 1926.1437(m)(1) through (3). 
These provisions are designed to 
prevent the crane/derrick portion of the 
equipment from failures due to 
overloading and to prevent capsizing. 

Proposed paragraph (m)(1) would 
require that load charts applicable to 
operations on water not be exceeded. 
The employer would be required to 
comply with all the parameters and 
limitations that apply to proper 
application of the load charts. 
Additionally, § 1926.1437(m)(1)(ii) 
would require the load charts to account 
for a minimum wind speed of 40 mph.86 

Proposed paragraph (m)(2) sets forth 

criteria (in Table M1 proposed 
§ 1926.1437) for maximum allowed list 
and trim relative to rated capacity of the 
equipment.87 Section 1926.1437(m)(3) 
sets forth two charts that would set 
stability criteria regarding certain 
specified conditions. The first chart 
(Table M2 of proposed § 1926.1437) 
contains the minimum requirements 
relative to stability with respect to wind 
speed and freeboard distance of the 
vessel/flotation device. The second 
chart (Table M3 of proposed 
§ 1926.1437) addresses the backward 
stability of the boom.88 In reviewing 
Table M2, the Agency realized that the 
term ‘‘freeboard,’’ which is used in the 
table, was not defined in the C–DAC 
document. OSHA requests public 
comment on an appropriate definition 
for this term. 

Employer-made equipment is defined 
in proposed § 1926.1401 as ‘‘equipment 
designed and built by an employer for 
its own use.’’ In some cases, for 
example, an employer designs and 
custom-builds the equipment for a 
particular operation or worksite. The 
Committee therefore determined it was 
necessary to include criteria for 
employer-made equipment. 

Under proposed paragraph (m)(4), 

employer-made equipment would have 
to meet the same criteria as those in 
proposed § 1926.1437(m)(1)–(3) for 
manufacturer-made equipment. In 
addition, an employer using equipment 
it builds would be required to have 
documents demonstrating that those 
criteria have been met. Such documents 
would have to be signed by a registered 
professional engineer who is a qualified 
person with respect to a design of the 
type involved. 

86 This is the same wind speed that section 8– 

1.2.2(c) of AMSE B30.8–2004, ‘‘Floating Cranes and 
Floating Derricks,’’ requires to be considered in 
establishing operating criteria for floating cranes. 
87 These criteria are the same as those in section 

8–1.2.2(a) of ASME B30.8–2004. 

88 The criteria in Tables M2 and M3 are the same 
as those in section 8–1.2.2(b) of ASME B30.8–2004.

C–DAC concluded that manufacturers 
have sufficient expertise with respect to 
the development of load charts, rated 
capacities and related operational 
limitations that there is no need for a 
documentation requirement for 
manufacturer-built floating cranes/ 
derricks. However, the expertise in this 
regard of non-manufacturers can vary 
greatly. Because of the specialized 
knowledge and skill needed for this 
work, and the potentially catastrophic 
consequences if this work was not done 
correctly, C–DAC believed that this 
documentation requirement is needed to 
provide the same level of safety for 
employer-made equipment as 
manufactured equipment. 

Proposed paragraph (m)(5) addresses 
structural and access requirements for 
the barge, pontoon, vessel or other 
means of flotation. These requirements 
are related to the stability of the vessel, 
including minimizing unintended 
movement while operating equipment 
and minimizing the likelihood of 
capsizing. 

Proposed paragraph (m)(5)(i) would 
require that the vessel be structurally 
sufficient to withstand the stress of both 
static and dynamic loads of the crane/ 
derrick when operating at the crane/ 
derrick’s maximum rated capacity with 
all anticipated deck loads and ballasted 
compartments. This is necessary to 
minimize the likelihood of the vessel’s 
structure failing, which could result in 
unintended movement during 
equipment operations or drowning. 

Proposed paragraph (m)(5)(ii) would 
require a subdivided hull with at least 
one longitudinal watertight bulkhead to 
reduce the free surface effect on the 
vessel. ‘‘Free surface effect’’ is defined 
in § 1926.1401 as the ‘‘uncontrolled 
transverse movement of liquids in 
compartments which reduce a vessel’s 
transverse stability.’’ By reducing the 
free surface effect, subdividing the hull 
limits the influence of liquid movement 
on vessel stability and reduces the risk 
of the vessel capsizing. 

Proposed paragraph (m)(5)(iii) would 

require void compartments to be 
accessible for inspection and pumping. 
This is needed to evaluate the amount 
of water in them so that the employer 
can determine the potential free surface 
effect on vessel stability and initiate 
pumping when necessary. As defined in 
§ 1926.1401 of this proposed standard, 
‘‘stability (flotation device)’’ means the 
tendency of a barge pontoon, vessel or 
other means of flotation to return to an 
upright position after having been 
inclined by an external force. Since the 
stability of the vessel is critical to the 
safe operation of equipment at a marine 
worksite, the Committee determined it 

necessary to clarify this term. The 
Agency determined it was appropriate 
to add the parenthetical ‘‘(flotation 
device)’’ to the term as the word 
stability in its more common usage 
occurs frequently throughout this 
proposed standard. 
Paragraph 1437(n) Land Cranes/ 
Derricks 

Proposed paragraph (n) sets forth the 

requirements for land cranes/derricks 
when used on a barge, pontoons, vessel 
or other means of flotation. As noted 
above, ‘‘land cranes/derricks’’ are not 
originally designed for marine use but 
are addressed by this paragraph when 
they are mounted on a vessel/flotation 
device and used on water. The 
Committee determined that special 
requirements were needed to address 
the distinctive safety issues presented 
by the use of such equipment. 

The stability of the vessel/flotation 
device is affected by the use of a land 
crane/derrick on board. The Committee 
determined that one of the primary 
causes of accidents for a land crane/ 
derrick on a vessel is related to the 
crane/derrick not being properly 
secured to the vessel. This can result in 
the equipment sliding off the vessel or 
the vessel capsizing. Implementing a 
system that keeps the equipment 
properly located on the vessel is 
essential for maintaining stability. 

In addition, land cranes/derricks have 
less capacity when on a vessel/flotation 
device than when on land. 
Consequently, the rated capacity must 
be adjusted for use on the vessel/ 
flotation device. If not properly 
determined, the land crane/derrick may 
be overloaded, which can cause loss of 
stability (including tip-over) and boom/ 
equipment failure. 

Proposed paragraph (n)(1) sets forth 
the requirements for determining the 
rated capacity for land cranes/derricks 
used on a vessel/flotation device. Load 
charts for this equipment developed for 
use on land do not reflect the use of the 
equipment on a flotation device or the 
environmental conditions of a marine 
worksite. Therefore, under proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(1)(i), the rated capacity 
(load charts) must be reduced for list, 
trim, wave action and wind. 

In establishing the rated capacity for 
use on the vessel/flotation device, the 
capacity of the vessel/flotation device 
must also be considered. Since some 
locations on the vessel/flotation device 
will have less ability to support the 
crane/derrick than others, under 
proposed § 1926.1437(n)(1)(ii), the rated 
capacity would have to be applicable to 
a specified location (or specific 
locations) on the particular vessel/

flotation device. This assessment would 
have to be made considering the 
expected environmental conditions. 

Furthermore, the rated capacity 

would have to be designed to ensure 
that the maximum allowable list and 
trim for the vessel/flotation device, as 
required in proposed § 1926.1437(n)(3), 
would not be exceeded. Also, the rated 
capacity would have to be designed so 
that the conditions listed in proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(4) would be maintained. 
If the rated capacity was not so 
designed, the operator could 
inadvertently cause these criteria to be 
violated. 

Proposed paragraph (n)(2) would 

require that the modification to rated 
capacity required by proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(1) of this section be 
prepared either by the manufacturer of 
the equipment or by a qualified person 
with expertise in both land crane/ 
derrick capacity and stability of vessels/ 
flotation devices. The Committee 
determined this was necessary to 
achieve equivalent operational safety 
conditions as for floating cranes/ 
derricks. 

In the SBREFA Panel Report, the 

Panel recommended that OSHA solicit 
comment on whether there are qualified 
persons in the field with expertise in 
both land crane/derrick capacity and 
stability of vessels/flotation devices 
with respect to this equipment 
performing duty cycle work. 
Additionally, the Panel recommended 
that OSHA solicit comment on the 
following: When cranes are solely used 
for duty cycle work: (1) Whether the 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(2) are necessary for 
safety for equipment performing duty 
cycle work, (2) the safety justification 
for the requirement for equipment 
performing duty cycle work, and (3) a 
definition of ‘‘duty cycle work.’’ As 
recommended by the Panel, OSHA 
solicits public comment on these issues. 

Proposed paragraph (n)(3) would set 
parameters for the maximum allowable 
list and trim for the vessel/flotation 
device and the land crane/derrick to 
help ensure the necessary vessel and 
crane/derrick stability and to help 
prevent the crane/derrick from 
exceeding its rated capacity. 

The maximum list and trim for the 

vessel/flotation device may not exceed 
the least of the following: 5 degrees, the 
amount specified by the crane/derrick 
manufacturer, or the amount specified 
by a qualified person in the event an 
amount is not specified by the 
manufacturer.89 

89 This is similar to section 8–1.2.2(a)(3) of ASME 

B30.8–2004, which specifies that the list and trim

Under proposed paragraph (n)(4), 

when a land crane/derrick is used on a 
flotation device, all deck surfaces would 
have to be above water and the entire 
bottom area must be submerged. This is 
necessary to ensure a stable platform 
when operating the land crane/derrick, 
to protect against loads that would 
cause the system used to secure the land 
crane/derrick (see proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)) to fail, and to protect 
against overloading the vessel/flotation 
device land/crane derrick. 

Proposed paragraph (n)(5) sets forth 

four options for securing 90 the land 
crane/derrick on the vessel/flotation 
device. The Committee determined that 
providing several options would 
address the variety of work scenarios 
that are found in the industry. It also 
determined that each option would be 
effective in preventing the land crane/ 
derrick from rolling, sliding or 
otherwise shifting away from its proper 
location. It is these horizontal 
movements that can cause the vessel/ 
flotation device to be destabilized or 
cause the land crane/derrick to slide or 
fall into the water. Additionally, the 
Committee determined that an 
exception is appropriate for use of 
mobile auxiliary cranes on a vessel. The 
proposed requirements for this type of 
equipment are outlined in proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)(vi). 

Proposed paragraphs (n)(5)(i) through 

(iv) set forth the four options from 
which the employer must choose to 
secure the land crane/derrick to the 
vessel/flotation device. The options to 
prevent shifting of the equipment 
include direct physical attachment, 
corralling, a rail system or a centerline 
cable system. All of these options serve 
the purpose of preventing inadvertent 
movement of the equipment away from 
its proper location on the vessel/ 
flotation device, which can result in 
harm to employees working nearby, the 
equipment sliding off the vessel, or 
capsizing the vessel. 

Note that it is not the purpose of these 

options to prevent any portion of the 
land crane/derrick from pulling 

shall be the lesser of 5 degrees or the maximum 
recommended by the manufacturer. 

90 In this preamble the Agency uses the term 

‘‘securing’’ and ‘‘secured’’ to refer collectively to the 
systems described in Options (1)–(4) in proposed 
paragraphs § 1926.1437(n)(5)(i) through (iv). The 
Agency notes that this differs from the term 
‘‘positively secured’’ in the current Subpart N in 29 
CFR 1926.550(f)(1)(iv), which requires that ‘‘mobile 
cranes on barges shall be positively secured.’’ As 
OSHA has stated in letters of interpretation, the 
term ‘‘positively secured’’ in that Subpart N 
provision means ‘‘physically attached’’—similar to 
the type of system described in Option 1 of 
proposed paragraphs (n)(5)(i). (See OSHA’s 
interpretation letter to Mr. Gary C. Hay, October 12, 
2004. (OSHA–2007–0066–0014). 

vertically up from the deck when 
handling loads beyond the land crane/ 
derrick’s rated capacity. Rather, their 
purpose is, as discussed above, to 
prevent horizontal rolling or shifting 
away from the land crane/derrick’s 
proper location. 

Proposed paragraph (n)(5)(v) would 

require that the option selected for 
securing the equipment on the vessel be 
designed by a marine engineer, a 
registered professional engineer familiar 
with floating crane/derrick design, or a 
qualified person familiar with floating 
crane/derrick design. The Committee 
determined that expertise in floating 
crane/derrick design was essential to 
design a securing system that would 
meet the selected option’s requirements 
and prevent unintended movement of 
the equipment on the vessel. 

Proposed paragraph (n)(5)(vi) would 

provide an exception under which, 
where the employer demonstrates that 
certain conditions have been met, 
mobile auxiliary cranes would not be 
required to be secured to a floating 
crane/derrick as outlined in proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)(i) through (v) above. 
The Committee determined that an 
exception to the application of these 
options would be appropriate in certain 
circumstances where a mobile crane 
travels on the deck of a floating crane/ 
derrick. Typically the movement of the 
mobile crane on these vessels does not 
adversely affect the stability of the 
floating crane/derrick because of the 
large size, displacement and design of 
the floating crane/derrick. Also, because 
of the size and design of the floating 
crane/derrick, it is less susceptible to 
the effects of wind, waves, and other 
environmental forces than other vessels. 
The Committee concluded that where 
the employer can demonstrate that the 
criteria in proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)(vi)(A) through (F) 
have been met, there would be adequate 
protection against unintended 
horizontal movement of the mobile 
crane while on the deck of a floating 
crane/derrick. 

As indicated by the language of this 

proposed provision, the Committee 
concluded that it would not be 
appropriate to expand this exception 
beyond its application to mobile 
auxiliary cranes used on the deck of a 
floating crane/derrick. Therefore, in 
such other circumstances, even if the 
criteria in proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)(vi)(A) through (F) 
were met, the employer would still have 
to use one of the four options in 
proposed § 1926.1437(n)(5)(i) through 
(iv).

designed and signed by a marine 
engineer or a registered professional 
engineer familiar with floating crane/ 
derrick design would be required. 
Because of the specialized knowledge 
and skill needed for this work, and the 
potentially catastrophic consequences if 
this work was not done correctly, C– 
DAC believed that this documentation 
requirement is needed to ensure safety. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(n)(5)(vi)(B), this plan would have to be 
designed so that the applicable 
requirements of proposed § 1926.1437 
will be met despite the position, travel, 
operation, and lack of physical 
attachment, corralling, use of rails or 
use of cable system of the mobile 
auxiliary crane. An example of one 
aspect of such a plan would be that it 
would have to be designed so that the 
vessel’s stability was such that, while 
operating within specified dynamic/ 
environmental conditions (see proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)(vi)(E) and (F)), the 
movement of the vessel will not cause 
the mobile crane to shift horizontally or 
for the vessel’s or mobile crane’s 
maximum list and trim to be exceeded. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(n)(5)(vi)(C), the plan would have to 
specify the areas of the deck where the 
mobile auxiliary crane is permitted to be 
positioned, travel, and operate. It would 
also have to specify the parameters (that 
is, limitations) of such movements and 
operation. For example, one aspect of 
the plan may be to specify that the 
mobile crane is permitted to move 
within one particular area without a 
load, and is permitted to handle a load 
only when in another particular area. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(n)(5)(vi)(D), the employer would be 
required to mark the deck to identify the 
permitted areas for positioning, travel 
and operation of the mobile crane. This 
is necessary for the operator to be able 
to maneuver and operate the crane 
within the limitations identified in the 
plan. 

Under proposed paragraph 

(n)(5)(vi)(E), the plan would have to 
specify the particular dynamic/ 
environmental conditions that must be 
present for movement and operation of 
the mobile auxiliary crane on the vessel. 
Under proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)(vi)(F), if the necessary 
dynamic/environmental conditions are 
not present, then the mobile auxiliary 
crane would be required to be secured 
according to one of the four options 
outlined in proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(5)(i) through (iv). For 
example, the plan would have to 
address environmental conditions such 
as maximum amount of wind and wave 
action; if those were exceeded, the 

mobile crane would have to be secured 
using one of the four options. 

In reviewing the C–DAC draft of 
proposed § 1926.1437(n)(5)(vi), the 
Agency realized that there is no explicit 
requirement that the employer 
implement the written plan. Therefore, 
OSHA has modified the introductory 
language of the proposed paragraph as 
follows: 

(vi) Exception. For mobile auxiliary cranes 
used on the deck of a floating crane/derrick, 
the requirement to use Option (1), Option (2), 
Option (3), or Option (4) of this section does 
not apply where the employer demonstrates 
implementation of a plan and procedures 
that meet the following requirements: * * * 

Proposed paragraph (n)(6) contains 

requirements regarding the barge, 
pontoon, vessel or other means of 
flotation on which the land crane/ 
derrick will be located. The 
requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1437(n)(6) are identical to those 
listed at proposed paragraph (m)(5) of 
this section. These requirements are 
related to the stability of the vessel and 
its structural ability to support the land 
crane/derrick. These proposed 
provisions are designed to help prevent 
unintended movement while operating 
equipment and to prevent capsizing. 
The Committee determined it is 
necessary to include these requirements 
to provide a safe, stable work 
environment. 
Section 1438 Overhead and Gantry 
Cranes 

Currently, specific requirements for 

overhead and gantry cranes are found in 
section 1926.550(d) of Subpart N. 
Section 1926.550(d)(4) incorporates by 
reference ANSI B30.2.0–1967, safety 
code for ‘‘Overhead and Gantry Cranes.’’ 
The general industry standard for 
overhead and gantry cranes, § 1910.179, 
is also derived from ANSI B30.2.0–1967. 
Therefore, the current requirements for 
overhead and gantry cranes are 
generally the same regardless of whether 
the equipment is used in general 
industry or construction. 

As defined in proposed § 1926.1401, 

overhead and gantry cranes include 
overhead/bridge cranes, semigantry, 
cantilever gantry, wall cranes, storage 
bridge cranes, launching gantry cranes, 
and similar equipment, irrespective of 
whether it travels on tracks, wheels, or 
other means. The Committee developed 
this definition to reflect the wide range 
of this type of equipment that has been 
developed. 

Overhead and gantry cranes are 

commonly found on general industry as 
well as construction worksites. 
Sometimes overhead and gantry cranes 
installed in general industry facilities 

are used for construction purposes (for 
example, the overhead/gantry crane in a 
factory is sometimes used when a part 
of the factory is being renovated). The 
Committee believed that applying the 
general industry standard for overhead 
and gantry cranes, § 1910.179, to the use 
of those cranes for construction work 
would reduce compliance burdens 
without jeopardizing employee 
protection. 

The Committee proposal therefore 
distinguishes between permanently 
installed overhead and gantry cranes, 
which are primarily used in general 
industry, and those that are not 
permanently installed, which are 
primarily used in construction work. 
For the former, this proposed rule 
would apply the requirements of 
§ 1910.179, the general industry 
standard. For the latter, the C–DAC 
proposal would apply specific 
provisions of both this standard and 
§ 1910.179. 
Paragraph 1438(a) Permanently 
Installed Overhead and Gantry Cranes 

Proposed § 1926.1438(a)(1) establishes 
the scope of § 1926.1438(a). By its terms, 
§ 1926.1438(a) would pertain to 
overhead and gantry cranes, including 
semigantry, cantilever gantry, wall 
cranes, storage bridge cranes, and others 
with fundamentally similar 
characteristics, when they are used in 
construction and are permanently 
installed in a facility. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2) would 

apply the requirements of § 1910.179 to 
the equipment listed in 
§ 1926.1438(a)(1), with the exception of 
§ 1910.179(b)(1). Section 1910.179(b)(1) 
sets forth the scope of the general 
industry standard as defined under 29 
CFR Part 1910. It is excluded to avoid 
any confusion that might arise from 
having two separate scope provisions 
applicable to § 1926.1438(a). 

Paragraph (a)(1) only applies to these 
cranes if they are used in construction 
and are permanently installed in a 
facility. This will typically be 
equipment that is used in general 
industry but may also be used for 
construction purposes. For example, a 
manufacturing plant that uses an 
overhead crane for lifting large 
components may use that same crane 
when adding a new room to the facility 
or changing its floorplan. Under the 
proposed provision, the requirements of 
§ 1910.179 would apply to both uses. 
Paragraph 1438(b) Overhead and 
Gantry Cranes That Are Not 
Permanently Installed in a Facility 

Paragraph (b)(1) would provide the 
scope of § 1926.1438(b). By its terms,

59866 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

§ 1926.1438(b) would pertain to 
overhead and gantry cranes, overhead/ 
bridge cranes, semigantry, cantilever 
gantry, wall cranes, storage bridge 
cranes, launching gantry cranes, and 
similar equipment, when they are used 
in construction and are not permanently 
installed in a facility. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2) specifies 

which requirements would apply to the 
equipment identified in 
§ 1926.1438(b)(1). 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(i) would 

require overhead and gantry cranes not 
permanently installed in a facility to 
comply with §§ 1926.1400 through 
1926.1414; 1926.1417 through 
1926.1425; 1926.1426(d); 1926.1427 
through 1926.1434; 1926.1437, 
1926.1439, and 1926.1441 of this 
standard. Sections 1926.1435, 
1926.1436 and 1926.1440, entitled 
Tower cranes, Derricks, and Sideboom 
cranes, respectively, would not be 
applicable because they pertain to 
different kinds of equipment. Sections 
1926.1415, 1926.1416 and 1926.1426(a) 
through (c) would not apply because 
they refer to devices not used on 
overhead and gantry cranes. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii) would 

incorporate by reference several 
requirements from § 1910.179. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) 

specifies the portions of § 1910.179 that 
would be applicable to the equipment 
identified in § 1926.1438(b)(1). The 
Committee selected these requirements 
because each is a safety requirement 
that applies to this type of crane 
regardless of whether it is used in 
construction or general industry. Other 
than certain definitions (described 
below), these are the only provisions of 
§ 1910.179 that would apply to the 
equipment identified in 
§ 1926.1438(b)(1). These requirements 
are: 
1910.179 (b)(5)—Rated load marking 
1910.179 (b)(6)—Clearance from 

1910.179 (b)(7)—Clearance between 

obstruction 

parallel cranes 

1910.179(e)(1)—Trolley stops 
1910.179(e)(3)—Trolley bumpers 
1910.179(e)(5)—Guards for hoisting 

1910.179(e)(6)—Guards for moving parts 
1910.179(f)(1)—Brakes for hoists 
1910.179(f)(4)—Brakes for trolleys and 

ropes 

bridges 

1910.179(g)—Electric equipment 
1910.179(h)(1)—Sheaves 
1910.179(h)(3)—Equalizers 
1910.179(k)—Testing 
1910.179(n)—Handling the load 

The C–DAC version of paragraph 

1438(b)(2)(ii)(B) would have 

incorporated the definitions in 
§ 1910.179(a) that do not differ from 
those in § 1926.1401 of this Subpart. 
Upon examining this provision, OSHA 
believes that it can be stated more 
clearly without changing its substance. 
Only three terms are defined in both 

§ 1926.1401 and § 1910.179: ‘‘hoist,’’ 
‘‘load,’’ and ‘‘runway.’’ With respect to 
‘‘hoist’’ and ‘‘load,’’ the definitions in 
§ 1926.1401 and § 1910.179(a) are 
similar but worded differently. ‘‘Hoist’’ 
is defined in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘a 
mechanical device for lifting and 
lowering loads by winding rope onto or 
off a drum.’’ In § 1910.179, ‘‘hoist’’ is 
defined as ‘‘an apparatus which may be 
part of a crane, exerting a force for 
lifting and lowering.’’ ‘‘Load’’ is defined 
in § 1926.1401 as ‘‘the object to be 
hoisted and the weight of the object 
being lifted or lowered, including the 
weight of the load-attaching equipment 
such as the load block, ropes, slings, 
shackles, and any other ancillary 
equipment.’’ Section 1910.179 defines 
‘‘load’’ as ‘‘the total superimposed 
weight on the load block or hook.’’ In 
both cases, the § 1926.1401 definition is 
clearer and more precise. 

With respect to ‘‘runway,’’ the 

§ 1926.1401 and § 1910.179 definitions 
address different subject matter. The 
definition in § 1926.1401 addresses the 
criteria for a ground surface used as a 
path of travel for a mobile crane 
traveling with a suspended personnel 
platform. The definition in § 1910.179 
refers to the rails, beams, and other 
structural components along which an 
overhead or gantry crane travels. 
Because the § 1926.1401 definition of 
‘‘runway’’ does not pertain to overhead 
and gantry cranes, the § 1910.179 
definition should apply under this 
section. 

The Agency believes it will be 

consistent with C–DAC’s intent and 
promote clarity to modify proposed 
§ 1926.1438(b)(2)(ii)(B) to list the 
definitions in § 1910.179(a) that do not 
apply to overhead and gantry cranes 
under proposed § 1926.1438(b). 
Accordingly, OSHA has changed that 
paragraph to read as follows: 

(B) The definitions in § 1910.179(a) except 
for ‘‘hoist’’ and ‘‘load.’’ For those words, the 
definitions in § 1926.1401 apply. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) 

would limit the application of 
§ 1910.179(b)(2) to equipment identified 
in proposed § 1926.1438(b)(1) that was 
manufactured before September 19, 
2001. Section 1910.179(b)(2) requires 
cranes manufactured after August 31, 
1971 to comply with the design 
specifications in American National 
Standard Safety Code for Overhead and 

Gantry Cranes, ANSI B30.2.0–1967. As 
discussed below, equipment 
manufactured after September 19, 2001 
would have to comply with the updated 
provisions of ASME B30.2–2001. 
Proposed § 1926.1438(b)(2)(ii)(C) is a 
transitional provision covering 
equipment manufactured between 
August 31, 1971 and September 19, 
2001. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii) would 

have incorporated several sections of 
the 2001 version of ASME B.30.2 into 
this section to update the Subpart N of 
29 CFR part 1926 provision, 
§ 1926.550(d), which incorporates ANSI 
B.30.2.0–1967. The Committee agreed 
that the 2001 version should be used 
because it is more comprehensive than 
the 1967 version and thus more 
conducive to safety. The sections 
referenced are: 
ASME B30.2–2001 
2–1.3.1—Foundations and Anchorages 
2–1.3.2—Crane Runways 
2–1.4.1—Welded Construction 
2–1.6—Lubrication 
2–1.7.2—Ladders and Stairways 
2–1.8.2—Bridge Bumpers 
2–1.9.1—Bridge Rail Sweeps 
2–1.9.2—Trolley Rail Sweeps 
2–1.11—Truck Frame Drop 
2–1.12.2—Hoist Control Braking Means 
2–1.13.7—Lifting Magnets 
2–1.14.2—Drums 
2–1.14.3—Ropes 
2–1.14.5—Hooks 
2–1.15—Warning Devices or Means for 

a Crane with a Power-Traveling 
Mechanism 

2–2.2.2—Load Test 
2–3.2.1.1—Planned Engineered Lifts 
2–3.5—Crane Lockout/Tagout, except 

that in 2–3.5.1(b), ‘‘29 CFR 
1910.147,’’ the OSHA general 
industry Lockout/Tagout standard, 
is substituted for ‘‘ANSI Z244.1.’’ 

When C–DAC drafted proposed 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C), the current 
version of ASME B30.2 was the 2001 
edition. That has since been superseded 
by a 2005 edition. OSHA notes that, in 
all material respects, the 2001 and 2005 
versions of the provisions listed in 
proposed § 1926.1438(b)(2)(iii) are the 
same. Except for section 2–1.8.2, the 
2001 and 2005 provisions are identical. 

Section 2–1.8.2 contains a wording 

change that does not substantively alter 
that provision. The 2001 version of 
section 2–1.8.2 contains the following 
requirement, among others, for bridge 
bumpers: ‘‘energy-absorbing (or 
-dissipating) capacity to stop the bridge 
when traveling with power off in either 
direction at a speed of at least 40% of 
rated load speed.’’ In the 2005 version 
‘‘(or -dissipating)’’ is changed to ‘‘(or

energy-dissipating).’’ This is clearly a 
clarification rather than a substantive 
change. Accordingly, OSHA has 
changed the reference in proposed 
§ 1926.1438(b)(2)(iii) to refer to the 2005 
version of ASME B30.2. 

When employers engaged in 

construction work must lock or tag 
components of overhead and gantry 
cranes during maintenance and repair 
work, proposed § 1926.1438(b)(2)(iii) 
would require them to comply with 
OSHA’s general industry lockout/tagout 
standard at § 1910.147 instead of the 
ANSI lockout/tagout standard (ANSI 
Z244.1) referenced in paragraph 2– 
3.5.1(b) of ASME B30.2–2005. The 
Committee believed that the OSHA 
general industry lockout/tagout 
standard would be more accessible and 
familiar to employers in the 
construction industry than the ANSI 
standard. Therefore, requiring 
compliance with the OSHA standard 
will promote compliance and, as a 
result, improve worker protection. 
Section 1439 Dedicated Pile Drivers 
The term ‘‘dedicated pile driver’’ is 

defined in § 1926.1401 as follows: 

[A] machine that is designed to function 

exclusively as a pile-driver. These machines 
typically have the ability to both hoist the 
material that will be pile-driven and to pile- 
drive that material. 

As the definition above indicates, this 

section covers equipment that is 
designed to function exclusively as a 
pile driver. Unlike the other equipment 
covered by Subpart N, dedicated pile 
drivers are not designed primarily to 
hoist, lower, and horizontally move 
suspended loads. However, the 
Committee decided to include dedicated 
pile drivers in this standard because of 
similarities to cranes with respect to 
hazards and functions. For a complete 
discussion of the Committee’s rationale 
for the inclusion of dedicated pile 
drivers within this standard, see the 
discussion above of proposed 
§ 1926.1400, Scope. 

As discussed below, most of the 

provisions of this standard apply to 
dedicated pile drivers, but this section 
includes certain provisions that 
accommodate unique characteristics of 
such equipment. In addition to the 
requirements established by this 
standard, pile driving equipment will 
continue to be covered by § 1926.603, 
Pile driving equipment. 
Paragraph 1439(a) 

This proposed paragraph would apply 

most of the provisions of this proposed 
standard to dedicated pile drivers. The 
provisions that would not apply, or 
would apply with some modification,

are specified in proposed § 1926.1439(b) 
through (e) (discussed below). 
Paragraph 1439(b) 

Under this proposed provision, 
proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3), which 
requires that cranes manufactured after 
February 28, 1992, be equipped with 
anti-two-blocking devices, would not 
apply to dedicated pile drivers. A note 
to this paragraph in the C–DAC draft 
states that anti two-block devices are 
required under proposed 
§ 1926.1431(d)(5)(iv) when hoisting 
personnel. This note misstates the 
requirement of proposed 
§ 1926.1431(d)(5)(iv), which provides 
that an anti two-block device is not 
required when hoisting personnel in 
pile driving operations. OSHA is 
therefore deleting the note to avoid 
inconsistency and conform to C–DAC’s 
intent. 

As discussed above in relation to 

proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3), anti two- 
block devices are not required during 
pile driving operations because the 
heavy repetitive forces imposed on such 
devices during pile driving cause them 
to malfunction. However, because anti 
two-block protection is needed when 
hoisting personnel to prevent a sudden 
drop of a personnel platform should a 
two-block condition occur, the proposed 
rule specifies, in proposed 
§ 1926.1431(p)(2), that when hoisting an 
employee in pile driving operations 
using a lattice boom crane, the employer 
clearly mark the cable (so that it can be 
easily seen by the operator) at a point 
that will give the operator sufficient 
time to stop the hoist to prevent two- 
blocking, or use a spotter. 

When using a telescopic boom crane, 

the employer must similarly clearly 
mark the cable (so that it can be easily 
seen by the operator) at a point that will 
give the operator sufficient time to stop 
the hoist to prevent two-blocking, and 
use a spotter. As discussed above in 
relation to proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d)(3)(i), marking the cable 
is not sufficient to prevent two-blocking 
when extending the boom of a 
telescopic boom crane. Other 
requirements that apply when hoisting 
personnel for pile driving operations are 
also listed in proposed § 1926.1431(p) 
and are discussed under that paragraph. 
Paragraph 1439(c) 

This provision would apply the 

requirements of proposed 
§ 1926.1416(e)(4) (load weighing and 
similar devices) to dedicated pile 
drivers, except that only dedicated pile 
drivers manufactured more than one 
year after the effective date of this 
standard would be required to be 

equipped with load weighing or rated 
capacity devices. The purpose of 
requiring load-weighing and rated 
capacity devices would be to provide 
dedicated pile driver operators with a 
reliable load weight prior to each lift to 
prevent the equipment from being 
overloaded. The Committee believed 
that this phase-in period would be 
appropriate because there are some 
technical challenges with designing this 
type of equipment to work consistently 
and reliably on dedicated pile drivers. 

The C–DAC draft would have 
required dedicated pile drivers 
manufactured after January 1, 2008 to be 
equipped with load weighing or rated 
capacity devices. As explained in the 
Introduction, OSHA has changed the 
January 1, 2008 date to ‘‘more than one 
year after the effective date of this 
standard’’ wherever that date appears in 
the C–DAC document. OSHA seeks 
public comment on the current 
availability of load-weighing or rated 
capacity devices for dedicated pile 
drivers and the related issue of whether 
a date other than one year after the 
effective date of this standard would be 
the appropriate date for requiring future 
dedicated pile drivers to be equipped 
with such devices. 
Paragraph 1439(d) 

Under this provision, the only aspects 

of proposed § 1926.1433 (Design, 
construction and testing) that would 
apply to dedicated pile drivers would be 
proposed § 1926.1433(e) and (f). In 
§ 1926.1433, proposed § 1926.1433(a) 
through (d) apply to specific types of 
equipment other than dedicated pile 
drivers. By contrast, proposed 
§ 1926.1433(e) and (f) would apply to 
equipment in general (see the 
explanation of proposed § 1926.1433 
above). 
Paragraph 1439(e) 

This proposed paragraph would 
require pile driver operators to be 
qualified or certified pursuant to 
§ 1926.1427. The Committee concluded 
that there was no reason to exclude 
dedicated pile drivers from the 
requirements of that section; in its view, 
the concerns underlying the need for 
§ 1926.1427 (see the discussion of that 
proposed section above) are equally 
applicable to the operation of dedicated 
pile drivers. 

Proposed ‘‘ 1926.1439(e) would 

modify the application of § 1926.1427 in 
one respect. Dedicated pile driver 
operators would have to have a 
qualification or certification applicable 
either to dedicated pile drivers or 
equipment that is most similar to 
dedicated pile drivers. This addresses a

59868 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

concern of the Committee that there are 
relatively few dedicated pile drivers in 
use. As a result, even with the four year 
phase-in period provided under 
§ 1926.1427, certification testing 
specific to dedicated pile drivers may be 
unavailable due to lack of market 
demand. Similarly, there may be a lack 
of auditors for auditing employer 
qualification programs for dedicated 
pile driver operators under proposed 
§ 1926.1427(c). 

However, most of the aspects 

involved in the safe operation of a 
dedicated pile driver are similar to those 
involved with operating equipment that 
performs the same function as a 
dedicated pile driver. For example, 
there is substantial similarity in the 
operation of a crane with a pile driving 
attachment and the operation of a 
dedicated pile driver. C–DAC believed 
that an operator who is qualified or 
certified to operate a crane with a pile 
driving attachment would have the 
knowledge and skill to operate a 
dedicated pile driver safely. C–DAC 
concluded that any lack of qualification 
or certification services specific to 
dedicated pile drivers would be 
alleviated by allowing qualification or 
certification on similar equipment. 
Section 1440 Requirements for 
Sideboom Cranes 

‘‘Sideboom crane’’ is defined in 

§ 1926.1401 as ‘‘a track-type or wheel- 
type tractor having a boom mounted on 
the side of the tractor, used for lifting, 
lowering, or transporting a load 
suspended on the load hook. The boom 
or hook can be lifted or lowered in a 
vertical direction only.’’ 

This is the definition of ‘‘side boom 
tractor’’ in ASME B30.14–2004, ‘‘Side 
Boom Tractors,’’ which serves as the 
basis for most of the requirements of 
this proposed section. C–DAC included 
a definition of ‘‘side boom tractor’’ in its 
original draft that stated only that the 
term was synonymous with ‘‘sideboom 
crane.’’ However, this proposed section 
uses ‘‘sideboom crane’’ exclusively. To 
avoid any confusion that could be 
caused by the use of two different terms 
and to provide a meaningful definition 
of ‘‘sideboom crane,’’ OSHA has deleted 
the definition of ‘‘side boom tractor’’ 
from § 1926.1401 and substituted the 
above definition of ‘‘sideboom crane.’’ 
OSHA has also substituted ‘‘sideboom 
crane’’ for ‘‘side boom tractor’’ in 
§ 1926.1400, Scope. 

This proposed section identifies 
which of the other sections of the 
proposed standard would apply to this 
equipment and sets additional 
requirements. These more limited 
requirements for this equipment reflect

the particular construction and more 
limited functions of sideboom cranes. 
For a discussion of the Committee’s 
rationale for the inclusion of sideboom 
cranes within this standard, see the 
preamble of § 1400, Scope. 
Paragraph 1440(a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) states that the 

provisions of this standard apply with 
the exception of § 1926.1402 (Ground 
conditions), § 1926.1415 (Safety 
devices), § 1926.1416 (Operational aids), 
and § 1926.1427 (Operator qualification 
and certification). The Committee 
exempted sideboom cranes from the 
requirements of these four sections 
because the Committee believed that, in 
light of the limited capacity and relative 
simplicity of operation of sideboom 
cranes, these requirements would be 
unnecessary. 

During the SBREFA process, one 

Small Entity Representative (SER) raised 
a question as to whether small sideboom 
cranes incapable of lifting above the 
height of a truck bed and with a 
capacity of not more than 6,000 pounds 
should be covered by the proposed rule. 
This SER felt that these small sideboom 
cranes should be exempted from the 
scope of this Subpart. In light of this 
suggestion, the SBREFA panel 
recommended that OSHA ask for public 
comment about the appropriateness of 
such an exemption for these small 
sideboom cranes. OSHA requests 
comments on this issue. 
Paragraph 1440(b) 

This proposed paragraph addresses 

the hazards posed by boom free fall (that 
is, ‘‘live’’ booms). For equipment other 
than sideboom cranes, as explained 
above in the discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1426 (Free fall and controlled 
load lowering), C–DAC determined that, 
in general, the use of such equipment 
with live booms needs to be prohibited. 
However, it also found that it would be 
appropriate to allow equipment 
manufactured before consensus 
standards had prohibited live booms to 
be used as long as certain limitations 
were applied. The prohibition in 
§ 1926.1426 therefore applies to 
equipment manufactured from October 
31, 1984 onwards. Equipment 
manufactured before that date with live 
booms may only be used where the 
specified limitations are met.91 

91 Under proposed § 1926.1426(a)(2)(i), the use of 

cranes in which the boom is designed to free fall 
(live boom) is limited to situations where both of 
the following criteria are met: (1) none of the free 
fall prohibitions outlined in proposed 
§ 1926.1426(a)(1) are present and § 1926.1426(a)(2) 
the equipment was manufactured prior to October 
31, 1984. 

C–DAC applied a similar approach to 

sideboom cranes in proposed 
§ 1926.1440(b), which applies most of 
§ 1926.1426 to sideboom cranes. The 
only difference is the cut-off date for the 
use of sideboom cranes with live booms. 
As explained above in the discussion of 
proposed § 1926.1426(a)(2), C–DAC 
concluded that, in light of the history of 
the ANSI B30.5 prohibition against live 
booms, most equipment covered by this 
proposed standard manufactured after 
October 31, 1984 does not have live 
booms. In contrast, the ANSI/ASME 
standards applicable to sideboom cranes 
(ANSI/ASME B30.14) have never 
prohibited live booms. As a result, C– 
DAC recognized that sideboom cranes 
with live booms continued to be 
manufactured after 1984. 

Consequently, under proposed 

§ 1926.1440(b), the cut-off date for using 
sideboom cranes with live booms is the 
effective date of this standard. 
Sideboom cranes in which the boom is 
designed to free fall that were 
manufactured prior to that date could 
continue to be used except under the 
circumstances specified in proposed 
§ 1926.1426(a)(1). 
Paragraph 1440(c) 

As drafted by C–DAC, this proposed 

paragraph would have required that 
sideboom cranes meet certain 
requirements of ASME B30.14–1996 
with addenda ASME B30.14a–1997, 
B30.14b–1999, and B30.14c –2001, 
‘‘Side Boom Tractors.’’ Since the 
Committee completed its work, ASME 
has consolidated the requirements of the 
1996 version with those in the 
supplements, and these are now found 
in ASME B30.14–2004. In that 
consolidation, ASME did not 
substantively change any of the 
provisions of those prior consensus 
standards. Accordingly, OSHA has 
modified the C–DAC paragraph to refer 
to the 2004 version of the ASME 
standard. 

In deciding which sections of ASME 

B30.14 to incorporate in this section, the 
Committee was mindful that, as noted 
in the discussion of § 1926.1440(a), most 
provisions of this proposed standard 
apply to sideboom cranes. To avoid any 
duplication, conflicts or possible 
confusion, the Committee wanted to 
avoid incorporating provisions of the 
ASME standard that dealt with issues 
addressed by other provisions of this 
standard. The provisions of ASME 
B30.14 incorporated by the Committee 
through this section consist of 
requirements that are specific to 
sideboom cranes. The Committee 
believed that these ASME requirements

are necessary and appropriate with 
respect to this equipment. 

Paragraph 1440 (c)(i) through 

Paragraph (c)(viii). These proposed 
paragraphs set forth sections of ASME 
B30.14–2004 which would be 
incorporated by reference to apply to 
sideboom cranes. Those sections are 
section 14–1.1 (‘‘Load Ratings’’), section 
14–1.3 (‘‘Side Boom Tractor Travel’’), 
section 14–1.5 (‘‘Ropes and Reeving 
Accessories’’), section 14–1.7.1 
(‘‘Booms’’), section 14–1.7.2 (‘‘General 
Requirements-Exhaust Gases’’), section 
14–1.7.3 (‘‘General Requirements- 
Stabilizers [Wheel-Type Side Boom 
Tractors]’’), section 14–1.7.4 (‘‘General 
Requirements-Welded Construction’’), 
and section 14–1.7.6 (‘‘General 
requirements-Clutch and Brake 
Protection’’). The Committee found that 
each of these would provide appropriate 
employee protection. 

Paragraph 1440 (c)(9) through 

Paragraph (c)(12). These proposed 
paragraphs set forth sections of ASME 
B30.14–2004 which would be 
incorporated by reference to apply to 
sideboom cranes, but with some 
exceptions or with only certain 
paragraphs selected from a section. 
Those sections are section 14–2.2.2 
(‘‘Testing-Rated Load Test’’), except that 
it applies only to equipment that has 
been modified or repaired; paragraph (a) 
of section 14–3.1.2 (‘‘Operator 
Qualifications’’) except that the phrase 
‘‘when required by law’’ would be 
omitted; Paragraphs (e), (f)(1) through 
(4), (6), and (7), (h), and (i) of section 
14–3.1.3 (Operating Practices), and 
paragraphs (j), (l),and (m) of section 14– 
3.2.3 (Moving the Load). 
Section 1441 Requirements for 
Equipment with a Rated Hoisting/Lifting 
Capacity of 2,000 Pounds or Less 

Proposed § 1926.1441 would establish 

requirements for equipment with a 
maximum-rated hoisting/lifting capacity 
of 2,000 pounds. Equipment in this 
category is inherently less hazardous 
than higher-capacity equipment for 
several reasons. First, the reduced mass 
of these loads makes them easier to 
manipulate. Second, the working radius 
of such equipment is very limited, 
which reduces the zone of danger 
involved. Third, the equipment itself is 
less complex to operate, which places 
fewer demands on the operator’s ability 
to maneuver the equipment and the load 
safely. 

Consequently, the Committee 

believed that not all of the requirements 
proposed for higher-capacity equipment 
should apply to this relatively light-duty 
equipment. For example, the Committee 
believed that the operator certification 

requirement of proposed § 1926.1427, 
which was developed with the 
complexities and hazards of heavy 
equipment in mind, should not apply to 
the low-capacity equipment addressed 
in this section. This proposed section 
identifies the sections of this proposal 
that the Committee believed need to 
apply to equipment with a capacity of 
2,000 pounds or less and contains 
provisions that would apply specifically 
to this category of equipment. 

Under the C–DAC document, this 

section would have applied to 
equipment with a ‘‘manufacturer-rated’’ 
hoisting/lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds 
or less. However, as discussed below, 
§ 1926.1441(j) was intended to address 
equipment designed and built at the 
jobsite, rather than manufactured 
equipment. Changing the term 
‘‘manufacturer-rated’’ in the title and 
regulatory text to ‘‘rated’’ will clarify 
that this section applies to both jobsite- 
built equipment and manufactured 
equipment. OSHA requests public 
comment on this change. 

The 2,000 pound cutoff for this 

section corresponds to that found in a 
number of consensus standards. For 
example, the ANSI standards that are 
currently incorporated by reference into 
Subpart N (B30.2–1967 for overhead 
and gantry cranes; B30.5—1968 for 
crawler, locomotive and truck cranes; 
and B30.6–1969 for derricks) do not 
apply to equipment with a hoisting/ 
lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds or less. 
ASME B30.5–2004 continues to exclude 
equipment whose capacity is 2,000 
pounds or less.92 

The requirements of 29 CFR part 1926 

subpart N that do not incorporate 
consensus standards by reference apply 
regardless of the equipment’s capacity, 
so equipment with a capacity of 2,000 
pounds or less is currently subject to 
those requirements. The Committee 
believed that the requirements in 
proposed § 1926.1441 would be more 
appropriate for this category of 
equipment and would be adequate to 
protect employees. 

In 2004, as discussed above, C–DAC 

found the 2,000 pound threshold for the 
application of this section, which is 
consistent with the 2004 ASME 
standard and prior ANSI standards, to 
be appropriate. The Agency is interested 
in information on whether there have 

92 There are some consensus standards that do not 
have a capacity threshold. For example, the current 
ASME B30.6—2003 on overhead and gantry cranes 
no longer limit their application by hoisting/lifting 
capacity. Further, the current ASME standard for 
floating cranes and derricks (ASME B30.8—204) 
and for construction tower cranes (ASME B30.3— 
2004) similarly do not limit their application by 
hoisting/lifting capacity.

been changes in technology or other 
considerations that would suggest a 
different threshold capacity for 
equipment covered by this proposed 
section. OSHA solicits public comment 
on this issue. 
Paragraph (a) 

Proposed paragraph (a) sets forth 

sections of the proposed standard that 
would apply, in their entirety, to 
equipment with a rated capacity of 
2,000 pounds or less to the same extent 
that those sections would apply to that 
type of equipment with a rated load 
capacity in excess of 2,000 pounds. 
Tower cranes (§ 1926.1435), Derricks 
(§ 1926.1436), Floating cranes & land 
cranes/derricks on barges (§ 1926.1437), 
and Overhead and gantry cranes 
(§ 1926.1438) are included in the list 
and thus would be subject to uniform 
requirements regardless of rated 
capacity. The Committee determined 
that the hazards addressed by these 
sections apply irrespective of the 
equipment’s rated capacity. 

For example, the dangers associated 
with making electrical contact with a 
power line do not depend on the lifting 
capacity of the equipment, so C–DAC 
believed that proposed §§ 1926.1407 
through 1926.1411 on power line safety 
should apply to all equipment 
regardless of rated capacity. Similarly, 
the proposed sections on Scope 
(§ 1926.1400), Definitions (§ 1926.1401), 
Ground conditions (§ 1926.1402), Wire 
rope (§§ 1926.1413 through 1926.1414), 
Authority to stop operation 
(§ 1926.1418), Signals (§§ 1926.1419 
through 1926.1422), Fall protection 
(§ 1926.1423), Free fall/controlled load 
lowering (§ 1926.1426), Multiple crane 
lifts (§ 1926.1432), and Equipment 
modifications (§ 1926.1434) are listed 
and would apply to equipment with a 
rated capacity of 2,000 pounds or less to 
the same extent that those sections 
would apply to that type of equipment 
with a rated capacity in excess of 2,000 
pounds. 

The hazards addressed by the sections 

not listed in § 1926.1441(a) are dealt 
with in the remainder of this proposed 
section in a manner that takes into 
account the lower capacity of the 
equipment. The discussion below 
explains how the Committee believed 
those hazards should be addressed for 
the equipment covered by this section. 

Note that proposed § 1926.1441(b) 

(discussed below) addresses assembly/ 
disassembly, and identifies some 
sections and paragraphs elsewhere in 
the standard that are applicable to this 
category of equipment (it also provides 
other assembly/disassembly 
requirements tailored to this category).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

A note to this effect has been added to 
the regulatory text of proposed 
§ 1926.1441(a), as follows: 

Note: Under paragraph (b)(1) of this 

section, § 1926.1403 (Assembly/ 
Disassembly—selection of manufacturer or 
employer procedures) and § 1926.1406 
(Assembly/Disassembly—employer 
procedures) also apply. 

Paragraph (b) Assembly/Disassembly 

Paragraph (b)(1). This proposed 
paragraph identifies the provisions 
related to assembly and disassembly 
that would apply to equipment with 
rated capacities of 2,000 pounds or less. 
The Committee identified two 
applicable Sections: § 1926.1403 
(Assembly/Disassembly—selection of 
manufacturer or employer procedures) 
and § 1926.1406 (Assembly/ 
Disassembly—employer procedures). 
Sections 1926.1404 (Assembly/ 
Disassembly—general requirements) 
and § 1926.1405 (Disassembly— 
additional requirements for disassembly 
of booms and jibs) were not included. 
The Committee believed that those 
comprehensive assembly/disassembly 
procedures are unnecessary for this 
category of equipment, which typically 
involves substantially less complexity. 
Paragraph (b)(2) Components and 
Configuration 

Paragraph (b)(2)(i). This proposed 
paragraph sets forth two options for 
selecting components and configuration 
of the equipment that affect capacity or 
safe operation. This paragraph, as well 
as the four paragraphs below, mirror 
§ 1926.1404(m)(1), (m)(1)(i), (m)(1)(ii), 
(m)(2), and (n) of this subpart. See 
§ 1926.1404(m) for further explanation 
of these provisions. 

Paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A). This first 

option would allow employers to select 
and configure components of the 
equipment in accordance with the 
manufacturer instructions, 
recommendations, limitations, and 
specifications. Furthermore, when the 
manufacturer instructions are not 
available, this provision would require 
a registered professional engineer, 
familiar with the type of equipment 
involved, to approve, in writing, the 
selection and configuration of 
components. 

Paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B). In this second 

option, employers would be able to 
select and configure components of the 
equipment in accordance with 
equipment modifications that meet the 
requirements of § 1926.1434 (Equipment 
modifications). 

Paragraph (b)(2)(ii). Post-assembly 
inspection. This proposed paragraph 
would require employers to conduct an

equipment inspection when assembly is 
complete in order to ensure compliance 
with § 1926.1441(b)(2)(i) above. The 
employer would be required to conduct 
such post-assembly inspections in a 
manner that complied with proposed 
§ 1926.1412(c). The same requirement 
applies to higher-capacity equipment 
under proposed § 1926.1404(m)(2). 
Ensuring that the assembled equipment 
aligns with the manufacturer 
instructions, recommendations, 
limitations, and specifications, would 
prevent hazards from arising and ensure 
the safe operation of the equipment. 

Paragraph (b)(3). Manufacturer 

prohibitions. This proposed paragraph 
would require employers to comply 
with applicable manufacturer 
prohibitions when using equipment 
with manufacturer-rated hoisting/lifting 
capacities of 2,000 pounds or less. The 
same requirement applies to higher- 
capacity equipment under proposed 
§ 1926.1404(n). The Committee agreed 
on this provision because 
manufacturers’ prohibitions are 
designed to prevent hazards that can 
arise with the use of their products. 
Paragraph 1441(c) Operation— 
Procedures 

Paragraph (c)(1). This proposed 

paragraph would require the employer 
to comply with all manufacturer 
procedures applicable to equipment 
operation, including equipment 
operation with attachments. The same 
requirement applies to higher-capacity 
equipment under proposed 
§ 1926.1417(a). The Committee agreed 
on this provision because manufacturer 
procedures are designed to prevent 
hazards that can arise with the use of 
their products. 
Paragraph (c)(2) Unavailable Operation 
Procedures93 

Paragraph (c)(2)(i). In the event that 

manufacturer procedures are not 
available, this paragraph would require 
the employer to develop, and ensure 
compliance with, its own procedures 
necessary for the safe operation of the 
equipment and its attachments. This 
paragraph is designed so that safe 
operation procedures, whether they 
come from the manufacturer or an 
employer, are utilized. 

Paragraph (c)(2)(ii). This proposed 
paragraph would require that when 
employers develop procedures as 
outlined in the previous paragraph, the 
procedures for the operational controls 
must be developed by a qualified 

93The requirement in this paragraph are the same 

as those that apply to higher-capacity equipment 
under proprosed § 1926.1417(b). 

person. The Committee concluded that, 
in light of the critical nature of the 
operational controls and the degree of 
expertise needed to develop safe 
procedures for their use, it is necessary 
that they be developed by a qualified 
person. 

Paragraph (c)(2)(iii). When 
manufacturer procedures are 
unavailable, this proposed paragraph 
would require that operational 
procedures related to equipment 
capacity be developed and signed by a 
professional engineer familiar with the 
equipment. The Committee concluded 
that, in light of the critical nature of 
such procedures and the high degree of 
complexity needed to develop them, a 
registered professional engineer who is 
familiar with the equipment is needed 
for this task. In addition, for the same 
reasons as discussed with respect to 
proposed § 1926.1417(b)(3), the 
Committee concluded that it is 
necessary that they be signed by the 
engineer. 
Paragraph (c)(3) Accessibility 

Paragraph (c)(3)(i). This proposed 

paragraph would require employers to 
make the load chart available to the 
operator at the control station. The 
Committee intended this provision to 
help prevent cranes from being used to 
perform operations beyond their 
capacities. The Committee believed that 
the load chart must be readily available 
to crane operators since capacity varies 
according to a variety of factors 
addressed in such charts, including, for 
example, boom length, radius, boom 
angle, and equipment configuration. 

A similar requirement applies to 

higher-capacity equipment under 
proposed § 1926.1417(c)(1). However, 
§ 1926.1417(c)(1) requires that the load 
chart be available in the cab. Because 
the equipment covered by this section 
may not have a cab, this proposed 
paragraph requires the chart to be 
available at the control station. 

Paragraph (c)(3)(ii). This proposed 

paragraph would require that 
procedures applicable to equipment 
operation, including recommended 
operating speeds, special hazard 
warnings, instructions, and the 
operator’s manual, be readily available 
for use by the operator. The Committee 
intended operators to have easy access 
to these materials because that 
information is needed to operate the 
equipment safely. A similar requirement 
applies to higher-capacity equipment 
under proposed § 1926.1417(c)(1), but 
this provision omits the reference to 
‘‘the cab’’ for reasons explained above 
with respect to proposed 
§ 1926.1441(c)(3)(i).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59871 

Paragraph (c)(3)(iii). Where rated 

capacities are available at the control 
station only in electronic form, and in 
the event that a failure makes the rated 
capacities inaccessible, this proposed 
paragraph would require that the 
operator immediately cease operations 
or follow safe shut-down procedures 
until the rated capacities become 
available again. The same requirement 
applies to higher capacity equipment 
under proposed § 1926.1417(c)(2). The 
Committee agreed that it is unsafe to 
continue to operate the equipment if the 
rated capacities are inaccessible to the 
operator. 
Paragraph (d) Safety Devices and 
Operational Aids 

Paragraph (d)(1). This proposed 

paragraph would require employers to 
maintain originally-equipped safety 
devices and operational aids in 
accordance with manufacturer 
procedures. The Committee believed 
that the full range of safety devices and 
operational aids required by proposed 
§§ 1926.1415 and § 1926.1416 were 
generally not needed for this relatively 
low-capacity equipment to operate 
safely. 

However, C–DAC also concluded that 

if the manufacturer included such 
devices or aids, it is probable that the 
manufacturer’s design relies on them 
working properly for the equipment to 
operate safely. Therefore, it is 
appropriate for the standard to require 
them to be maintained in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s procedures. 

Paragraph (d)(2). Anti two-blocking 
By its terms, this proposed paragraph 
would require that equipment covered 
by this section that is manufactured 
more than one year after the effective 
date of this standard be either equipped 
with an anti-two block device that 
would meet the requirements of 
proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3) or be 
designed so that no damage or load 
failure would occur in the event of a 
two-block situation. 

The provision identifies an example 

of equipment designed to prevent 
equipment damage load failure—where 
the power unit of the machine stalls in 
the event of a two-block situation. In 
such a case, the power unit does not 
have sufficient power to cause the load 
to fail or to damage the equipment. 
Instead, when the two-block occurs, the 
power unit simply stalls out. 

The purpose of this paragraph is to 

prevent equipment damage and/or 
failure stemming from contact between 
a component on the hoist line and the 
boom tip, which occurs during a two- 
block. Such contact can lead to a

damaged or severed load line, as well as 
other types of equipment failure. 

The Committee agreed to provide 
employers with discretion to choose 
between two options for eliminating 
two-block hazards. The first option is 
designed to prevent a two-block from 
occurring. The second option is 
designed to prevent equipment damage 
and load failure in the event of a two- 
block. The Committee believed that 
each option would, for this category of 
equipment, be equally protective of 
employee safety. 

As discussed under proposed 

§ 1926.1416, Operational aids, the 
Committee believed that anti two-block 
devices should be required on higher- 
capacity cranes manufactured after the 
date that ANSI/ASME B30.5 began to 
require them. Consequently, proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d)(3) states that telescopic 
boom cranes and lattice boom cranes 
manufactured after February 28, 1992 
are required to have an anti two-block 
device. However, none of the various 
versions of ANSI/ASME B30.5 has 
applied to equipment with a capacity 
under 2,000 pounds. C–DAC believed 
that it would be inappropriate to apply 
this requirement to equipment 
manufactured before either a voluntary 
consensus standard or federal 
requirement has been in place. 
Therefore, proposed § 1926.1441(d)(2) 
would only apply to equipment 
manufactured more than one year after 
the effective date of this standard. 

As discussed above, an anti two-block 

device used to comply with proposed 
1926.1441(d)(2) must meet the 
requirements for such devices in 
proposed § 1926.1416(d)(3). Proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d)(3) addresses two types of 
anti two-block devices: The warning 
type and the automatic prevention type 
(these are explained above in the 
discussion of proposed 
§ 1926.1416(d)(3)). The type required 
depends on the type of crane and the 
date of manufacture. However, the 
automatic prevention type is required 
on all equipment manufactured more 
than one year after the effective date of 
this standard. Since proposed 
§ 1926.1441(d)(2) only applies to 
equipment with a capacity of 2,000 
pounds or less manufactured more than 
one year after the effective date of the 
standard, an anti two-block device on 
such equipment would need to be the 
automatic prevention type. 

Note that, under proposed 

§ 1926.1441(d)(1) (discussed above), 
equipment of 2,000 pounds or less 
capacity manufactured prior to the 
standard’s effective date, if 
manufactured with an anti-two-block 
device, would be required to have that 

device properly maintained. For further 
discussion of anti-two-blocking devices, 
see the explanation in proposed 
§ 1926.1416, Operational aids. 
Paragraph (e) Operator Qualifications 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that, before operating 
equipment, the operator is trained on 
the safe operation of the type of 
equipment the operator will be using. 
The Committee believed that 
familiarizing operators with safe 
operation techniques would help 
minimize operator error and thereby 
reduce the likelihood of accidents and 
injuries. However, the Committee 
concluded that the operator 
certification/qualification procedures 
that would be required for higher 
capacity equipment under proposed 
§ 1926.1427 was not needed for this 
lighter and less complicated equipment. 
Paragraph 1441(f) Signal Person 
Qualifications 

This proposed paragraph would 

require employers to ensure that signal 
persons are trained in the proper use of 
signals applicable to the use of 
equipment with a rated capacity of 
2,000 pounds or less. Though the 
equipment covered by this section has 
limited capacity, in some circumstances 
its safe operation depends on signals 
given by a signal person. In that event, 
this paragraph would ensure that 
communication between the crane 
operator and the signal person is clear 
and effective. 

However, the Committee concluded 
that the comprehensive signal person 
qualification procedures that would be 
required for higher capacity equipment 
under proposed § 1428 were not needed 
for this equipment. 
Paragraph 1441(g) Keeping Clear of the 
Load 

This proposed paragraph states that 
proposed § 1926.1425 is applicable to 
equipment with a rated capacity of 
2,000 pounds or less, with the exception 
of proposed § 1926.1425(c)(3). Proposed 
§ 1926.1425(c)(3) would require 
materials to be rigged by a qualified 
rigger. The Committee believed that, in 
light of the limited capacity of this 
equipment, it was unnecessary to 
require a qualified rigger. 
Paragraph 1441(h)

Inspections 

The general provision on inspections, 

§ 1926.1412, would not apply to this 
equipment. Instead, this proposed 
paragraph would require that the 
equipment be inspected pursuant to the 
manufacturer’s procedures. The 
Committee believed that inspections

pursuant to manufacturers’ procedures 
would be sufficient to detect conditions 
that could lead to equipment failure 
because manufacturers typically 
recommend procedures that are 
designed to prevent hazards that can 
arise with the use of their products. The 
Committee concluded that the 
comprehensive inspection procedures 
that would be required for higher 
capacity equipment under proposed 
§ 1926.1412 were not needed for this 
lighter and less complicated equipment. 
Paragraph 1441(i)

[Reserved.] 

This paragraph is reserved because it 

is inconvenient for the reader to 
determine whether (i) is used as a letter 
or a Roman numeral. 
Paragraph 1441(j) Hoisting Personnel 

This proposed paragraph would 

prohibit the practice of using equipment 
with manufacturer-rated load capacities 
of 2,000 pounds or less to hoist 
personnel. The Committee believed that 
this equipment is inherently unsuited to 
lifting personnel safely due to its low 
capacity and typically light 
construction. 
Paragraph 1441(k) Design 

This proposed paragraph would 

require that the equipment be designed 
by a qualified engineer. The Committee 
was concerned that some employers 
may design and construct equipment in 
this category themselves, rather than 
using equipment built by a 
manufacturer. This provision is 
intended to ensure that the design of 
such equipment would be sufficient 
from a safety standpoint. 
V. Procedural Determinations 
A. Legal Authority 

The purpose of the Occupational 

Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. 651 et 
seq. (‘‘the Act’’), is ‘‘to assure so far as 
possible every working man and woman 
in the Nation safe and healthful working 
conditions and to preserve our human 
resources.’’ 29 U.S.C. 651(b). To achieve 
this goal, Congress authorized the 
Secretary of Labor to promulgate and 
enforce occupational safety and health 
standards, 655(b) (authorizing 
promulgation of standards pursuant to 
notice and comment), 654(b) (requiring 
employers to comply with OSHA 
standards)). 

A safety or health standard is a 

standard ‘‘which requires conditions, or 
the adoption or use of one or more 
practices, means, methods, operations, 
or processes, reasonably necessary or 
appropriate to provide safe or healthful 
employment’’ (29 U.S.C. 652(8)). 
A safety standard is reasonably 

necessary or appropriate within the 
meaning of Section 652(8) if it 
substantially reduces or eliminates 
significant risk, is economically and 
technologically feasible, is cost 
effective, is consistent with or is a 
justified departure from prior Agency 
action, is supported by substantial 
evidence, and is better able to effectuate 
the Act’s purposes than a relevant 
national consensus standard. 

A standard is technologically feasible 

if the protective measures it requires 
already exist, can be brought into 
existence with available technology, or 
can be created with technology that can 
reasonably be expected to be developed. 
American Textile Mfrs. Institute v. 
OSHA, 452 U.S. 490, 513 (1981) 
(‘‘ATMI’’); AISI v. OSHA, 939 F.2d 975, 
980 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (‘‘AISI’’). 

A standard is economically feasible if 
industry can absorb or pass on the costs 
of compliance without threatening its 
long-term profitability or competitive 
structure. See ATMI, 452 U.S. at 530 n. 
55; AISI, 939 F.2d at 980. A standard is 
cost effective if the protective measures 
it requires are the least costly of the 
available alternatives that achieve the 
same level of protection. ATMI, 453 U.S. 
at 514 n. 32; International Union, UAW 
v. OSHA, 37 F.3d 665, 668 (D.C. Cir. 
1994) (‘‘LOTO III’’). 

Section 6(b)(7) authorizes OSHA to 

include among a standard’s 
requirements labeling, monitoring, 
medical testing and other information 
gathering and transmittal provisions. 29 
U.S.C. 655(b)(7). 

Safety standards must be highly 

protective. See 58 FR at 16614–16615; 
LOTO III, 37 F.3d at 669. Finally, 
whenever practical, standards shall ‘‘be 
expressed in terms of objective criteria 
and of the performance desired.’’ Id. 
B. Preliminary Economic Analysis and 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
Summary 

Affected Industries 

The proposal would affect employers 
and employees in a variety of different 
construction industries in which cranes 
and derricks are used as part of the 
performance of work duties. These 
industries include firms involved in 
renting cranes for use in construction 
projects such as: Multi-family housing; 
industrial buildings and warehouses; 
other nonresidential buildings; highway 
and street construction; and water, 
sewer, power, and communication line 
construction. For purposes of this 
preliminary economic analysis (PEA), 
the Agency has grouped affected 
establishments, by industry, into the 
following categories: 

• Crane Rental with Operators, 
• Crane Rental without Operators, 
• Own and Rent Cranes with 

Operators, 

• Own but Do Not Rent, and 
• Crane Lessees in the Construction 
Industry (or referred to simply as just 
‘‘Crane Lessees’’ throughout this 
preliminary economic analysis). 

The full industrial profile of affected 

firms and establishments, including 
information on number of employees, 
revenues, and profits, is presented 
below in section 3 with data on affected 
employers presented in Table B–2. 
Benefits 

The proposed standard addressing 

construction work involving cranes and 
derricks is expected to reduce accidents, 
fatalities, and injuries in the 
construction industry. The Agency 
estimates that 53 fatalities and 155 
injuries would be avoided annually 
from compliance with the provisions of 
the proposed standard. Applying an 
average monetary value of $50,000 per 
prevented injury and a value of $7.5 
million per prevented fatality, the 
Agency estimates the monetized benefit 
at about $406 million annually. The 
Agency believes that affected employers 
and employees will also benefit from 
the additional clarity of the revised 
standards as well as their 
comprehensiveness. Table B–1 provides 
a summary of the benefits, costs, and net 
benefits of the proposed standard. Net 
benefits are estimated to be $283 million 
annually.

Compliance Costs 

The estimated compliance costs for 
this proposed standard represent the 
additional resources necessary for 
employers to achieve full compliance. 
The Agency believes provisions in four 
areas of the proposed standard will 
generate the largest costs for employers: 
Crane assembly/disassembly; power- 
line safety; inspections; and operator 
qualification and certification. 
Estimated costs do not include costs 
when employers are already complying 
with the new requirements of the 
proposed standard. The total annualized 
costs of compliance with the proposed 
standard are estimated to be about $123 
million. 

OSHA solicits comments from the 

public regarding the ranges of cost and 
benefits calculated in the economic 
analysis. 
Economic Impacts 

To assess the economic impacts 
associated with the proposed rule, 
OSHA compared the estimated 
employer costs with employer revenues 
and profits. The costs of compliance 
with the proposed rule are not large in 
relation to the corresponding annual 
financial flows. The economic impacts 
are presented in Table B–13. At most, 
the estimated costs of compliance 
represent about 0.3 percent (less than 1 
percent) of revenues for each affected 
industry. Alternatively, the estimated 
compliance costs also represent less 
than 1 percent of profits, for the average 
establishment among the affected 
industries. 

The impact of the proposal measured 

by the ratio of costs to profits varies 
across the affected sectors. Among the 
industries in the Crane Lessees (in the 
construction industry) sector, which 
includes about 142,500 of the 164,500 
affected establishments, average 
employers are expected to have costs 
that represent much less than 1 percent 
of profits. Within the sector of 
employers which Own but Do Not Rent, 
affected establishments in 11 of the 30

industry sectors have average costs as 
high as a few percent of profits (from 2 
to 6 percent). 

The economic impact of the proposed 

rulemaking is most likely to consist of 
a small increase in prices for affected 
construction projects—less than 0.3 
percent, on average. (Note that costs/ 
impacts will be far less for the 
construction industry in its entirety, 
which consists of over 700,000 
establishments and over $1 trillion in 
revenue.) It is unlikely that a price 
increase of this magnitude will 
significantly alter the amount of 
construction goods demanded. If the 
compliance costs of the proposed rule 
can be substantially recouped with a 
minimal increase in prices, there will be 
little effect on profits. 

OSHA concludes preliminarily that 

compliance with the requirements of the 
proposed rulemaking is economically 
feasible in every affected industry 
sector. In addition, based on an analysis 
of the costs and economic impacts 
associated with this rulemaking, OSHA 
preliminarily concludes that the effects 
of the proposed standard on 
international trade, employment, wages, 
and economic growth for the United 
States would be negligible. 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 

OSHA has analyzed the impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities and has 
prepared an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) (in section 8, 
below), describing the potential effects 
on small entities. The IRFA includes a 
discussion of the Small Business 
Advocacy Review Panel (SBARP) 
process that has been completed for this 
proposed standard. The SBARP process 
provided small businesses the 
opportunity to comment on a draft of 
the proposed standard and on the 
corresponding economic analysis. The 
SBARP subsequently submitted a report 
to OSHA which summarized these 
comments and made specific findings 
and recommendations regarding the 
draft proposed standard. The Panel’s 

recommendations are presented in 
section 8 of this PEA. Table B–15 
presents the impacts on small entities. 
Costs as a percent of revenues range 
from 0.01 to 0.26 percent (less than 1 
percent); costs as a percent of profit 
range from 0.03 to 6.6 percent. 
1. Introduction 

The Occupational Safety and Health 
Act of 1970 (OSH Act) requires OSHA 
to demonstrate the technological and 
economic feasibility of its rules. 
Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), as 
amended in 1996, require federal 
agencies to analyze the costs, benefits, 
and other consequences and impacts, 
including small business impacts, of 
their rules. Consistent with these 
requirements, OSHA has prepared a 
Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) 
and an Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis to accompany this proposal. 
The proposal on cranes and derricks in 
construction will increase the protection 
of construction workers from hazardous 
working conditions in and around 
cranes. 

It has been determined that this is an 

economically significant action under 
E.O. 12866 and a major rule under the 
Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act (SBREFA). In addition, as 
required by the RFA, the Agency has 
assessed the potential impacts of this 
proposal on small entities and has 
prepared an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis. This rule is not a 
significant federal intergovernmental 
mandate, and the Agency has no 
obligations to conduct analyses of this 
rule under the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995. Because this 
proposed rule would have costs of over 
$100 million in any given year, this 
proposed rule would establish a federal 
mandate for the private sector. The 
analysis presented for compliance under 
E. O. 12866 also serves as the UMRA 
analysis. 

The purpose of this analysis is to 

identify the establishments and

industries affected by the rule; evaluate 
its costs, benefits, and economic 
impacts; assess the technological and 
economic feasibility of the proposal for 
affected industries; and evaluate the 
appropriateness of regulatory non- 
regulatory alternatives to the rule. 

This PEA has been developed 

according to the requirements of the 
E.O. 12866 and the OSH Act. In 
addition, in accordance with the RFA as 
amended by the SBREFA, this analysis 
identifies and estimates the impacts of 
the proposal on small businesses, using 
the Small Business Administration’s 
(SBA’s) industry-specific definitions of 
small businesses. In addition, OSHA 
assessed the impacts of the rule on very 
small businesses, i.e., those with fewer 
than 20 employees. 
Methodology 

The Agency’s occupational safety and 

health standards are required to be 
‘‘reasonably necessary or appropriate’’: 

(8) The term ‘‘occupational safety and 

health standard’’ means a standard which 
requires conditions, or the adoption or use of 
one or more practices, means, methods, 
operations, or processes, reasonably 
necessary or appropriate to provide safe or 
healthful employment and places of 
employment. 

E.O. 12866 further defines appropriate 

regulatory goals and how regulations 
should be analyzed, and pursuant to the 
E.O. OSHA develops an economic 
analysis to estimate benefits and costs. 
A comparison of estimated benefits and 
costs from the economic analysis further 
addresses whether an occupational 
standard is reasonably necessary. Since 
2002, under the direction of the Office 
and Management and Budget, the 
Agency has also provided a 
‘‘monetized’’ value of benefits for 
avoided injuries, illnesses, and fatalities 
from its standards, which permits 
comparison of benefits and costs where 
required. 

For all significant occupational safety 

and health standards, OSHA derives 
estimates of benefits and costs as 
annualized values, as the Agency 
believes these are the simplest and most 
understandable ways to weigh and 
assess the impact of its standards. 
Computing annualized estimates 
focuses Agency analysis on information 
from current conditions and recent 
years which the Agency deems the best 
information—most accurate and 
reliable—to analyze a standard’s impact 
on employers and employees. OSHA 
typically uses a time period of ten years 
for its analysis, unless there are 
significant long-term effects not 
captured within a ten-year time frame. 
In this case, adding additional years to

the time frame of the analysis would not 
change any major conclusions. 

To isolate and describe only the 

effects of a new standard, the Agency 
carefully distinguishes, for both benefits 
and costs, the change induced by the 
new standard without regard to 
compliance with existing standards. So, 
when injuries or fatalities have occurred 
because existing standards were not 
adhered to, the Agency neither counts 
such avoidable accidents as a benefit of 
the proposed new standard nor includes 
as an additional cost meeting existing 
occupational standards. This analysis 
assumes that all costs are incurred in 
the first year following the promulgation 
of the final standard and that benefits 
result immediately, although some costs 
will actually likely be incurred over a 
longer horizon since the standard has 
phase-in periods for some provisions. 
The Agency employs a ‘‘willingness 
to pay’’ (WTP) approach in estimating 
benefits. This is a two-step process in 
which, for the cranes and derricks’ 
proposal, the past 10 years of accident 
reports were studied to estimate the 
number of fatalities and injuries, and 
also the number that would be avoided 
by full compliance with the proposed 
standard. Secondly, the Agency uses 
values from the WTP approach to 
produce a monetary value of benefits. 
The WTP approach applied by many 
economic studies estimates the ‘‘value 
of a statistical life’’ (VSL) based on data 
collected about job risks and the ‘‘risk 
premium’’ in wages that is paid to 
employees in riskier jobs. The VSL is 
used as a metric by many government 
regulatory authorities, such as National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
and the Environmental Protection 
Agency, but is particularly appropriate 
for occupational standards since it is 
derived from occupational risks and 
wages. 

The Agency’s calculation of estimates 
for benefits and costs, summarized and 
compared in the tables on net benefits, 
is implicitly one that looks at society as 
a whole. Estimated costs are borne by all 
affected employers while benefits from 
the WTP approach are market-derived 
estimates of employees’ valuation of job 
risk and reward (economic feasibility, 
discussed in section 7 below focuses on 
employer and industry economic 
impacts without regard to benefits). The 
VSL represents to some extent the 
employees’ value of taking on additional 
job risks and describes the value to 
employees of avoiding fatality and 
injury. The monetary value of an 
(avoided) injury from the WTP approach 
is based on survey results. Summing 
together estimates of costs and benefits 
that impact different parts of society is 

an approach that is considered (by 
economists) to represent the welfare of 
society as a whole. 

The primary alternative to a WTP 

approach is a cost of injury (COI) 
approach. A COI approach estimates 
such factors as medical costs for 
injuries, the costs of work disruption 
from accidents and accident 
investigations, indirect costs to 
employers (absenteeism and hiring 
costs, for example), lost wages or job 
opportunities to employees, 
rehabilitation, and many other potential 
sources of costs to all parties. The COI 
approach results in ascribing costs and 
benefits to many involved entities: The 
employer, the employee, workers’ 
compensation programs, medical 
insurance, federal disability programs, 
and government/taxpayers, for example. 
A COI approach does not capture a 
value for loss of life, pain and suffering, 
impacts on families, and similar 
parameters, and for that reason the 
Agency believes that the VSL better 
represents a monetary value that is 
consistent with the purposes of the OSH 
Act, placing great value on workers’ 
health and lives.

2. Identification of Market Failure and 
Need for Regulation 

The justification for imposing 

appropriate occupational safety and 
health standards generally, and for 
adopting this change to the cranes and 
derricks standard in particular, is that 
without these requirements, fatality and 
injury risks to employees would remain 
unacceptably high. Workplace risks and 
resulting injuries and costs would be too 
high from a moral- and social-preference 
perspective, as determined by Congress 
through the passage of the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act. In addition, risks 
would be too high in terms of imposing 
large net costs (both pecuniary and non- 
pecuniary) on society, producing an 
inefficient allocation of resources, and 
reducing overall social welfare. 

‘‘Market failure’’ is a term used by 

economists to describe when the 
allocation of goods and services by a 
market is not efficient, in the sense that 
it is possible for at least one person to 
be made better off without making 
anyone else worse off (termed ‘‘Pareto

efficiency’’). One common cause of 
market failure is that the person 
responsible for a decision does not bear 
the full costs or consequences of that 
decision. When this occurs, the person 
responsible for the decision will not 
fully consider all of the costs involved, 
and, as a result, may arrive at an 
inappropriate decision. In the case of 
occupational injuries, the employer has 
the primary decision-making 
responsibility, and does not, in fact, 
bear the full costs of occupational 
injuries. As a result, employers will 
tend to allocate less to occupational 
safety than would be efficient if all costs 
of occupational injuries were 
considered. 

Who bears the costs of an employee 
injury, which include loss of income, 
medical care costs, the non-monetary 
burdens the injury imposes, and other 
outcomes? Some of these costs, 
particularly medical costs and a portion 
of income loss, are paid for through 
workers’ compensation. While some 
employers self insure, and pay the 
workers’ compensation costs directly, 
the overwhelming majority of employers 
purchase (and are required to purchase) 
workers’ compensation insurance. Thus, 
in most cases, employers do not directly 
pay for workers’ compensation to the 
injured worker. The remainder of the 
costs of the injury is normally borne by 
the employee, though some of the costs 
may be borne by the government in the 
form of welfare. (In almost all states, 
workers’ compensation is an exclusive 
remedy, meaning that an employee may 
not sue his employer for a work-related 
injury.) 

In principle, both employees and 

insurers could contract with employers 
for payment in advance for the risks 
incurred. Insurers charge premiums for 
their insurance. Workers could, in 
theory, demand increased pay for 
increased risk, and there is evidence 
that workers do demand increased pay 
for more dangerous occupations, work 
in more dangerous industries, and 
exposure to well known hazardous 
substances. In this situation, there is not 
an externality, where an externality is 
defined as damage to an outside party 
who is not party to a market agreement. 
There are, however, several 
informational and institutional 
problems that prevent an ideal set of 
payments for risks incurred. 

The first requirement for reasonable 

valuation of risk in transfers of risk

between parties is that the risk be 
known. Further, for the estimate of risk 
to affect the behavior of employers, it is 
necessary that employees and insurers 
be able to differentiate the risk among 
different employers, not just be able to 
assess the risk across all employers in 
an industry. In the case of relatively rare 
accidents such as serious crane 
accidents, this is quite difficult to do. As 
a result, simply looking at the past 
record will not provide much useful 
information concerning relative risk 
among employers. The employers 
themselves may be equally uncertain 
about the risks associated with their 
practices. 

Even if such information on past 

performance were available, there is no 
guarantee that future performance will 
be identical to past performance. 
Different management or even the same 
management (with different objectives, 
financial performance or schedule) may 
do things differently than they have in 
past. Further, once the risk has been 
transferred by contract to employees 
and insurers, the employer has reduced 
incentives to maintain a low level of 
risk. This phenomenon is a constant 
problem in insurance, where it is known 
as a moral hazard—the tendency of the 
insured to act with less care as a result 
of having insurance. As a result, the 
only way for an insurance company to 
estimate the risk of crane accidents for 
a specific employer is through 
monitoring actual employer practices 
that affect crane safety—an expensive 
method of obtaining information and 
one that insurance companies do not 
perform, the Agency concludes. In 
addition, workers’ compensation 
insurance uses, and, in most states is 
required by law to use, an experience 
rating system. Experience rating ties the 
quoted premium closely to a 
combination of all similar occupations 
in all firms and the individual firm’s 
actual record over the previous three 
years. For very small firms, this means 
that, in practice, the individual firm’s 
record has no impact on their insurance 
premium. Even quite large firms pay, 
through insurance premium increases, 
less than the full costs of accidents. 
Further, the use of experience rating 
makes it difficult for insurers to make 
use of information from monitoring and 
inspection of safety practices, even if 
they had such information. 

Employees also have problems 

obtaining and using this information. 

First, employees may simply be 
unacquainted with safe practices—as 
these are commonly taught by 
employers. (One effect of the proposed 
standard’s requirement for crane 
operator certification is to assure that 
crane operators will be acquainted with 
rules for crane safety, and have the 
appropriate skills to apply them.) 
Second, information on safety is 
commonly not available before taking a 
job. Third, wages are sometimes 
determined by industry contracts, with 
no room for added risk premiums for 
individual employers. Finally, there are 
significant costs in many cases to 
leaving a job, which means that even if 
the employee realizes a job is less safe 
than some other available jobs, the 
employee may be reluctant to leave the 
job. 

In summary, the market failure in job 

safety is that employers commonly 
transfer the costs of job safety to other 
parties, and a combination of 
informational and institutional 
constraints prevents the costs of the 
transfer from actually reflecting the risk 
to the individual employer—instead 
employers pay to transfer the risk at a 
cost closer to the average costs for the 
occupation rather than their own costs 
reflecting their own risks. As result, 
employers do not pay the full costs if 
they have above average risks or poor 
safety practices. Under these 
circumstances, the need for regulation is 
established by the significant risk 
presented by crane and derrick 
operations (see section 4). 
3. Industrial Profile 

The proposed standard would affect 

establishments across a variety of 
different construction industries with 
work involving cranes and derricks. 
Table B–2 presents data on the numbers 
of affected firms, establishments, 
employees, and average establishment 
revenues and profits. The Agency sorted 
establishments, by industry, into five 
sectors according to their crane or 
equipment activities, as follows: 
• Crane Rental with Operators, 
• Crane Rental without Operators, 
• Own and Rent Cranes with 

Operators, 

• Own but Do Not Rent, and 
• Crane Lessees in the Construction 

Industry (or just ‘‘Crane Lessees’’).

Source:  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Economic  Census,  2002  for  establishments,  employees,  revenues,  except  Crane  Rental  w/o  Operators  group; 
Dunn and Bradstreet, Market Profiles, 2002 for data for Crane Rental w/o Operators group; Profit rates from Internal Revenue Service, Statistics 
of Income 2002 Corporation Source Book, 2002; Affected establish estimates from OSHA/Office of Regulatory Analysis (ORA). 

These sectors have an estimated total 

of about 164,500 affected 
establishments. Crane Lessees in the 
Construction Industry (just ‘‘Crane 
Lessees’’ hereafter) have almost 90 
percent of the firms and employees 
affected by the proposed standard. The 
profile was constructed by combining 
two kinds of sources: (1) General data 
on numbers of establishments, firms, 
revenues, employees, and profits for 
affected individual industries, and (2) 
data on the number or percentage of 
establishments in the industries that use 
cranes. 
General Data Sources 

Data from the U.S. Bureau of the 

Census (CB) was used to develop the 
industry profile estimates (which 
include establishments, employees, and 
revenues) for the five sectors, except the 
Crane Rental without Operators sector, 
which was developed using 2002 Dunn 
and Bradstreet (D&B) data, except for 
estimates of the number of firms which 
was based on CB data. The Agency used 
2002 D&B data for the Crane Rental 
without Operators sector because these 
data matched best with SBA data for

estimating the characteristics of small 
firms in that sector. 

Profit rates were taken from the § 2002 

Source Book Statistics of Income’’ 
published by the Internal Revenue 
Service. The profit rates were calculated 
by dividing the reported net income by 
total receipts for each 3-digit NAIC, and 
were applied to each industry falling 
within that 3-digit NAIC. For example, 
for NAIC 236 Building Construction, 
OSHA used the calculated profit rate of 
4.41 percent for all industries 
performing building construction 
(residential and non-residential). 
Adjustments for Use of Cranes 

OSHA used the ‘‘2002 Economic 

Census’’ of the Census Bureau (CB) for 
data on numbers of firms, 
establishments, and employees, by size, 
for establishments that rent cranes 
(Crane Rental with Operators, Crane 
Rental without Operators). To estimate 
the number of establishments that Own 
but Do Not Rent Cranes and those that 
only lease cranes (see Table B–3), the 
Agency applied several adjustments to 
the CB ‘‘2002 Economic Census’’ data. 
First, adjustments were made so that 

estimates of establishments would be 
consistent with the data from CB which 
identified establishments that report 
crane rental revenue. OSHA reviewed 
the construction industry sub-sectors in 
the ‘‘NAICS Manual 2007’’ to determine 
the type of work activities that would 
require the use of a crane. Some of the 
industries affected by the proposal 
consist entirely of contractors and 
general contractors—either of whom 
might be the lessee of a crane. In some 
cases, OSHA determined that general 
contractors in residential construction 
would lease cranes instead of the trade 
contractor. Secondly, during the SBAR 
panel process some small entity 
representatives stated that some 
establishments that were categorized as 
Crain Lessees (in the construction 
industry) do in fact own their own 
cranes, and that some who were 
categorized as owning cranes typically 
lease them, or do both. Table B–3 shows 
the adjustments the Agency made to 
estimate the number of establishments 
renting cranes in each industry (which 
are reflected in Table B–2) and the 
Agency’s rationale.

Affected Establishments and Employees 

This section describes OSHA’s 

method for estimating the number of 
affected establishments and employees 
in construction for each of the five 
affected construction industry sectors. 

The Agency derived estimates of the 
number of affected employees and 
establishments primarily from CB data 
on establishments, employees, annual 
payroll, and revenues (see Table B–2). 

The CB also collects data on 

establishments that have reported 
revenue from renting cranes with 
operators (‘‘cranes,’’ which are more 
numerous than derricks, will be used 
throughout this section as shorthand for

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

59879 

‘‘cranes and derricks’’). This data was 
acquired via special data runs by CB for 
OSHA. This data includes crane-rental 
revenue percentages which OSHA used 
to determine separate estimates for 
those establishments that (1) rent cranes 
with operators as their main revenue 
source, and (2) rent their cranes to other 
firms when they are not using them. 
Thus, the Agency was able to compile 
profile estimates for employers who (1) 
provide crane rental with operators 
(which are only found in NAIC 238990), 
and (2) own and rent cranes with 
operators (which are found across 
several NAICS codes). The Crane Rental 
without Operators category consists of 
establishments in NAICS 532412 that 
rent cranes without operators (also 
known as bare rentals) that fall within 
the scope of this proposal. Estimates for 
the Own but Do Not Rent category are 
based on the assumption that ten 
percent of all establishments in the 
construction industry own their own 
cranes, but do not rent them when they 
are not using them. The last category, 
Crane Lessees, consists of all of the 
other construction establishments that 
do not own their own cranes, but only 
lease cranes from crane-rental 
companies or other companies that own 
cranes. In preparing this profile of 
industries affected by the proposal, 
OSHA assumed that the proposed rule 
would affect all establishments that 
either rent or use cranes in construction 
activities. 

Among the affected crane-rental 
industries, the largest is the Crane 
Rental without Operators (bare rentals) 
(NAICS 532412 Construction/Mining/ 
Forestry Machine and Equipment 
Rental), with an estimated 4,631 
affected establishments and 50,409 
employees. The largest crane-use 
industry is Commercial and 
Institutional Building Construction 
(NAICS 236220), with an estimated 
37,208 affected establishments and 
715,896 employees. 
Crane Rental with Operators 

This sector consists of 1,240 affected 
establishments (part of NAICS 238990 
All Other Specialty Trade Contractors) 
that rent cranes with operators. These 
establishments employ 16,244 
employees and have total revenues of 
$1.9 billion. The profit rate for this 
NAIC is 4.1 percent. The CB data did 
not report estimates of the number of 
firms. The Agency estimated the 
number of firms by assuming a 1:1 ratio 
of establishments to firms in the less- 
than-20-employee size class. For all 
other size classes, the Agency 
multiplied the number of 
establishments by 75 percent to estimate 

the number of firms. These ratios of 
establishments to firms are typical for 
the size classes in the construction 
industry. Based on revenues for this 
sector and an estimate of the total 
number of cranes in use, the Agency 
estimated that each crane generates 
about $400,000 in average annual 
revenue, and so estimated the average 
number of cranes per establishment, by 
size class, by dividing the average 
revenues per establishment by $400,000. 
The Agency estimated that there is, on 
average, one crane operator for each 
crane in this sector since this category 
rents cranes with operators. 
Crane Rental without Operators (bare 
rentals) 

Establishments that rent cranes 

without operators (bare rentals) are 
incorporated into NAICS 532412 
Construction, Mining, and Forestry 
Machinery and Equipment Rental and 
Leasing. The Agency estimated that 
there are 4,631 affected establishments 
in this NAIC engaged in construction 
activity, with over 50,000 employees 
and revenues of $3.2 billion. The profit 
rate for this industry is 4.0 percent. 
Since the D&B data did not report 
estimates of the number of firms, OSHA 
used 2002 Small Business 
Administration (SBA) data for firms in 
the less-than-20-employee size class (the 
only size class in this category 
considered to be small by SBA). An 
estimate of the number of cranes was 
derived by dividing the revenues per 
establishment by the estimated $250,000 
that each crane generates in average 
annual revenue (less than the average 
revenue per crane rented with 
operators). The Agency estimated that 
the ratio of cranes-to-operators is 4:1 for 
this category since establishments in 
this category rent cranes without 
operators. 
Own and Rent Cranes with Operators 

The CB identified establishments that 

own cranes and rent them when they 
are not being used. These 1,803 
establishments employ 40,639 
employees with total annual revenues of 
$6 billion. The profit rate for the firms 
in these sectors ranged from 3.9 to 4.7 
percent. The Agency assumed a 1:1 ratio 
of establishments to firms, in most 
cases, for those establishments with less 
than 20 employees. For all others, the 
Agency multiplied the number of 
establishments by 75 percent to estimate 
the number of firms. To derive an 
estimate of the number of cranes, OSHA 
divided the per establishment revenues 
by the $400,000 which each crane 
generates in average annual revenue. 
The Agency used a 1:1 ratio of cranes- 

to-operators to estimate the number of 
crane Operators. 
Own but Do Not Rent 

To estimate the number of 

establishments that Own but Do Not 
Rent, the Agency subtracted those 
establishments that own and rent cranes 
from the total number of construction 
firms per NAICS sector. This difference 
was then multiplied by 10 percent to 
estimate the number of establishments 
that own cranes but do not rent them. 
Since most cranes in construction are 
leased, 10 percent seemed a reasonable 
estimate of establishments that own 
cranes but do not rent them. The CB 
provided estimates of establishments, 
employees, and revenues per NAICS 
sector. To estimate the number of firms, 
the Agency used employment data from 
the CB to estimate the average number 
of employees per establishment. The 
Agency assumed a 1:1 ratio of 
establishments to firms for those 
establishments that averaged less than 
20 employees. For all others, the Agency 
multiplied the number of 
establishments by 75 percent to estimate 
the number of firms. The profit rate for 
these firms is the same as for firms in 
the Own and Rent Cranes with 
Operators category. An estimate of the 
number of cranes was derived by 
assuming that each establishment would 
own, on average, one crane. The Agency 
assumed a 1:1 ratio of cranes-to- 
operators for this sector. (Data on the 
number of cranes and crane jobs is also 
presented in section 6 Costs of 
Compliance.) 
Crane Lessees (in the construction 
industry) 

The Agency assumed that any NAICS 

identified from the CB data that could 
rent a crane would likely do so, and 
included all establishments in those 
NAICS industries as possible leasees of 
cranes. The corresponding estimate of 
the number of firms was derived using 
the same procedure described above for 
the Own but Do Not Rent category. 
Using the estimates from three sectors 
(Crane Rental with Operators, Crane 
Rental without Operators, and Own and 
Rent Cranes with Operators), OSHA 
concluded that, among the cranes that 
are rented, 74 percent are rented 
without operators and 26 percent with 
operators. 
Estimates of Number of Cranes and 
Crane Jobs 

The Agency estimates that there are 

96,206 cranes that would fall under the 
scope of the proposal. The Preliminary 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(PIRFA) estimated the number of cranes

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

at 91,997. Based on comments from 
small entity representatives (SERs) 
during the SBREFA panel meetings, 
OSHA increased its estimate of the 
number of cranes in the Own but Do Not 
Rent category by increasing to 10 
percent the fraction of all construction 
establishments that may own cranes but 
not rent them. OSHA also expanded the 
Crane Lessees category to include light 
and heavy construction entities. This 
expansion accounts for the difference in 
estimates of establishments, firms, and 
employees between the PIRFA and in 
this PEA. 

In the PIRFA, the Agency estimated 

the number of crane jobs at 368,000 
annually, or four jobs per crane. For the 
purposes of this analysis, a crane job is 
defined as beginning when the crane is 
put into use and ending when the crane 
is either moved (which triggers an 
assessment of ground conditions and 
power lines) or when an increasingly 
hazardous situation occurs (e.g., excess 

rain which affects ground conditions) 
which triggers other requirements of the 
standard. While no SER provided an 
alternative estimate, some stated that 
the Agency’s estimate of crane jobs was 
extremely low. As a result of these 
comments, the Agency increased its 
estimate of the number of crane jobs to 
almost 860,000 for all establishments 
and increased the average number of 
annual jobs per crane to 9. OSHA 
requests comment on these estimates. 
(Estimates of the number of cranes and 
crane jobs can be found in section 5 
Costs of Compliance.) 
Estimates of Small Entities 

The Small Business Administration 
(SBA) publishes industry-specific size 
criteria that classify businesses as small 
entities. The SBA criteria for small 
entities in the construction industry are 
based on revenue, rather than the 
number of employees. OSHA used 2002 
CB ‘‘Economic Census’’ data to associate 
these revenue criteria with employment 

size classes. For each industry sector, 
the Agency used CB data to calculate 
average revenues for entities of each 
employment size class and then 
matched the SBA revenue criterion for 
that industry with the size class that had 
the largest average revenues not 
exceeding the SBA criterion. 

Table B–4 shows the estimated 

number of construction small entities 
that meet the SBA criteria for each 
sector. As shown, the SBA revenue 
criteria are so large, given the size of 
typical construction entities, that 
virtually all entities in the industries fall 
within the SBA definition of small 
entities. Almost 99 percent of all 
construction establishments are small 
entities, following the SBA criteria. In 
addition to the SBA-defined small 
entities, the Agency estimated the 
number of establishments that are very 
small (having less than 20 employees). 
Table B–5 shows the industrial profile 
for this size class.

Wages 

Taking the ratio of total payroll (from 
CB’s ‘‘2002 Economic Census’’) to total 
employment, OSHA calculated an 
average annual salary of $35,352 per 
employee. This estimate includes both 
production and non-production 
employees. OSHA compared this CB 
annual salary estimate with a salary 
estimate that is based on weekly 
earnings of $724.66 for a production or 
non-supervisory employee in 2002, as 
reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
(BLS) ‘‘Employment and Earnings, 
January 2003.’’ On an annual basis, the 
BLS salary is calculated as $37,682 
(fringe benefits not included), which 
differs only slightly with the CB salary 
estimate. The Agency chose to rely on 
the BLS wage data for this analysis due 
to their breakdown into different 
employment categories using its 
National Industry-Specific Occupational 
Employment and Wage Estimates 
Survey. Estimated wages include: Base 
gross pay rate, cost-of-living allowances, 
guaranteed pay, hazardous pay, 
incentive pay including commissions 
and production bonuses, on-call pay, 
and tips. The estimates exclude: Back 
pay, jury duty pay, overtime pay, 
severance pay, shift differentials, non- 
production bonuses, and tuition 
reimbursement (BLS, 2000). To produce 
a total wage that reflects total 
compensation for employees in affected 
industries, OSHA adjusted the average 
base annual wage ($37,682) to include 
fringe benefits. BLS estimates the 

percentage of fringe benefits based on 
survey data for aggregate worker 
categories. In this analysis, OSHA used 
an average fringe-benefit rate of 40 
percent. 
4. Benefits and Net Benefits 

This section reviews the population at 

risk of occupational injury or death in 
construction and estimates the benefits 
from the proposal. OSHA believes that 
compliance with the proposal will yield 
substantial benefits in terms of lives 
saved, injuries avoided, and accident- 
related cost savings. The proposal 
addresses several areas that will impose 
compliance costs: Crane assembly/ 
disassembly; power-line safety; 
inspections; and operation qualification 
and certification. Although the proposal 
also includes other new provisions, they 
primarily update, consolidate, and 
clarify existing requirements. The 
Agency is only providing quantitative 
estimates of benefits for the new 
provisions listed above, although OSHA 
believes that all of the provisions are 
reasonably related to preventing injuries 
and fatalities which, in turn, will reduce 
expenditures for medical care, 
rehabilitation, death benefits, and lost 
work time (but note that these are not 
part of the calculated benefits, or cost 
savings, since the Agency is relying on 
a willingness to pay approach). 

To assess the benefits, a historical 
analysis of the frequency of fatalities 
and injuries among employees in 

construction was conducted using 
OSHA and BLS data. 
Data Sources 

The data sources that the Agency 
determined are the most reliable to 
estimate benefits are OSHA’s Integrated 
Management Information System (IMIS), 
the BLS Census of Fatal Occupational 
Injuries (CFOI), and the BLS survey of 
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. 
Because not all accidents are included 
in the relevant data bases, the actual 
number of preventable fatalities and 
injuries addressed by this rulemaking 
may be somewhat higher. However, 
OSHA does not currently have a basis 
for estimating how many pertinent 
fatalities or injuries may have occurred 
that would not be represented by the 
relevant data sources. OSHA requests 
information and comments from the 
public regarding this issue. 
Fatality Benefits 

OSHA’s analysis of the number of 

fatalities estimated to be averted by the 
proposal proceeds in two steps: (1) 
Determine the number of fatalities 
currently occurring, and the types and 
causes of these fatalities; and (2) 
determine the proposal’s ability to avert 
various types of fatalities (assuming full 
compliance). As discussed above, only 
those fatalities that would have been 
prevented through compliance with the 
four new provisions noted above were 
estimated in the benefits analysis. To 
estimate the number of fatalities

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Injury Benefits 

To estimate the avoidable injuries, the 
Agency relied on the number of injuries 
involving cranes in the construction 
industry from 1995 to 2004 using the 
BLS Survey of Occupational Injuries 
and Illnesses. The assessment of 
avoidable injuries is presented in Table 
B–7. The Agency obtained from BLS 
special data runs with estimates of the 
number of cases involving days away 
from work associated with cranes in 
construction for the 10 years (1995– 
2004). In using those data to assess 
potential benefits, OSHA is assuming 
that the reported injuries encompass 
most of the attributes related to 
accidents where cranes are the true 
source. These BLS data do not 
differentiate between crane-related cases 
that are ‘‘struck by’’ or ‘‘contact with 
electric current,’’ but the Agency 
assumes that the majority of crane- 
reported cases are from these two 
causes. 

As shown in Table B–7, over a ten- 

year period, 263 injuries per year 
occurred involving cranes in 
construction. To estimate the number of 
potentially avoidable struck-by cases, 
the Agency multiplied the 263 injuries 
each year by its ratio of avoidable cases 
(59 percent) derived from the fatality 
data. Thus, the Agency preliminarily 
estimates that the proposal will avoid 
155 injuries annually.

Monetized Benefits 

For informational purposes, the 

Agency monetized both the avoidable 
fatalities and injuries based on 
willingness-to-pay values of $7.5 
million per death and $50,000 per 
injury. OSHA has followed EPA’s 

approach to monetizing the reduction in 
the risk of premature mortality, as 
presented in ‘‘The Benefits and Costs of 
the Clean Air Act of 1990 to 2010’’ 
(EPA, 1999) and applied in the Radon 
in Drinking Water regulation. EPA’s 
approach is presented in Chapter 7 of 
EPA’s ‘‘Guidelines for Preparing 
Economic Analyses,’’ which provides a 
detailed review of the methods for 
estimating mortality risk values and 
summarizes the values obtained in the 
literature (EPA, 2000). EPA identified 26 
studies that it considered relevant. 
Synthesizing the results of these studies, 
EPA arrived at a mean value for a 
statistical life (VSL) of $4.8 million in 
1990 dollars. EPA employs this central 
estimate, updated for inflation, in its 
regulatory analyses. OSHA has updated 
EPA’s mean VSL for 1990 using the 
consumer price index (CPI calculator, 
CPI home page), adjusted for income 
elasticity (GDP data, Bureau of 
Economic Analysis, Dept. of 
Commerce), and applied a value of $7.5 
million to each premature fatality 
avoided (2006 base year). In applying 
these values, OSHA estimates that the 
annual monetized value of the 53 
potentially avoidable fatalities is $397.5 
million. The estimated monetized value 
of avoiding the 155 injuries is $8.5 
million. Thus, total monetized benefits 
are $406 million. 

Non-Quantified Benefits 

OSHA believes that there are non- 

quantified injury benefits that are likely 
to result from other provisions of the 
proposal, and the 155 injuries should be 
considered a minimum estimate. The 
proposed provisions for signal persons, 
fall protection, work-area control, 
multiple lifts, hoisting personnel, and 
training, among others, are expected to 
result in safer working conditions that 
will reduce injuries to construction 
workers. Also, OSHA believes that 
employers and employees will benefit 
from the reorganization and plain 
language used in the proposal, which 
will make it easier for employers to 
comply with the requirements and, 
thus, improve construction safety 
conditions. 

associated with cranes and derricks, the 
Agency first averaged 10 years of 
construction fatality data (1994–2003) 
from the CFOI database. Based on the 
CFOI data, an average of 1,123 fatalities 
occurred each year during that time 
period in the construction industry. 

According to a study from the 

Construction Industry Research and 
Policy Center (CIRPC), at least 8 percent 
of the total construction fatalities are 
crane related (CIRPC, Beavers, Moore, 
Rinehart, and Schriver, Report 35, 
March, 2005 and Journal of 
Construction and Engineering 
Management, 2006). This percentage 
when applied to the yearly average 
fatalities, results in an estimated average 
of 89.8 crane-related fatalities in the 
construction industry annually. 

To determine avoidable deaths under 
the proposal, OSHA reviewed accident 
abstracts from the IMIS database from 
1995 to 2005. These abstracts consist of 
general-duty clause citations under the 
OSH Act and existing 29 CFR 1926.550 
citations. In reviewing these data, OSHA 
determined that 29 fatalities were 
similar to the types of accidents 
addressed by the existing rule or 
proposal. Of these 29 fatalities, OSHA 
determined that 17 (or 59 percent) 
would have been averted by compliance 
with the proposal. This ratio was 
applied to the estimated annual average 
of crane-related fatalities (89.8) to 
preliminarily estimate the fatality 
benefits of the proposal—i.e., 53 
avoided fatalities annually. These are 
potentially avoided fatalities because 
the estimate assumes perfect 
compliance with the proposed standard. 
Table B–6 outlines the avoided fatalities 
under the proposed standard.

Net Monetized Benefits (Benefits Minus Costs): ...................................................................................................... $283 million annually. 

Sensitivity of Estimates 

The estimate of benefits is most 

sensitive to the estimated percentage of 
current annual fatalities that can be 
avoided by full compliance with the 
proposed standard. The percentage of 
fatalities that will be avoided is also 
applied to the estimate of avoided 
injuries involving cranes and derricks in 
construction. OSHA closely examined 
available reports of 29 fatalities that 
were related to the provisions in the 
existing and proposed standards and 
found that 17 would be prevented if 
measures in the proposal standard had 
been followed, or about 59 percent. 
Since the 29 detailed reports are a 
sample of all crane-related fatalities, the 
true benefits depend on how well the 29 
cases reviewed represent the actual 
accidents involving cranes. So, if the 
true percentage of avoided fatalities 
varied from the estimate by 10 percent 
(49 or 69 percent instead of 59 percent) 
there would be a 10 percent change in 
the number fatalities and injuries 
prevented. The Agency believes that its 
estimate of annual fatalities involving 
cranes (about 90) in the construction 
industry is much less sensitive than the 
estimate of the percentage of fatalities 
avoided, because both the estimate of 
the annual number of all construction 
fatalities (1,123) and percentage related 
to cranes and derricks were based on 10 
years of data. 

According to the Agency’s models for 

estimating costs and (monetized) 
benefits, the proposed standard 
generates considerable positive net 
benefits; that is, the benefits are much 
greater than costs. For net benefits to fall 
to zero, the Agency would have had to 
overestimate the number of fatalities 
prevented by the standard by several 
fold, from the estimated 55 fatalities 
prevented to about 16. Alternatively (for 
zero net benefits), the Agency would 
have had to underestimate the number 
of cranes and derricks in use—and the 
annual number of construction projects 
where cranes are used—by threefold, 

from about 96,000 cranes and derricks 
to 300,000. In that case estimated 
compliance costs would rise to over 
$400 million annually, or about equal to 
the value of estimated monetary 
benefits. 
5. Technological Feasibility 

In accordance with the OSH Act, 

OSHA is required to demonstrate that 
occupational safety and health 
standards promulgated by the Agency 
are technologically feasible. 
Accordingly, OSHA reviewed the 
requirements that would be imposed by 
the proposal, and assessed their 
technological feasibility. As a result of 
this review, OSHA has determined that 
compliance with the requirements of the 
proposal is technologically feasible for 
all affected industries. The proposal 
would require employers to perform 
crane inspections, utilize qualified or 
certified crane operators, address 
ground conditions, maintain safe 
distances from power lines using the 
encroachment prevention precautions, 
and to fulfill other obligations under the 
standard. Compliance with all of the 
proposed requirements can be achieved 
with readily and widely available 
technologies. Some businesses in the 
affected industries already implement 
the requirements of the proposed 
standard to varying degrees (some states 
have requirements), as noted during the 
SBREFA Panel. OSHA believes that 
there are no technological constraints in 
complying with any of the proposed 
requirements, and welcomes comments 
regarding this conclusion. 
6. Costs of Compliance 

This section presents the estimated 
costs of compliance for the proposed 
standard for cranes and derricks in 
construction. The estimated costs 
represent the additional costs necessary 
for employers to achieve full 
compliance, and these estimates do not 
include costs associated with current 
practices, or ‘‘baseline’’ activities, that

affected employers already perform. If a 
national consensus standard exists, 
OSHA takes that standard as the 
‘‘baseline’’ reflecting current practices— 
costs are attributed for provisions in the 
proposal that are over and above current 
practices. If, however, the standard is 
more stringent than the consensus 
standard, all employers incur 
compliance costs solely attributable to 
the OSHA regulation. 

Table B–8 presents the total 

annualized estimated costs by provision 
across industry sectors. Information 
about how costs were calculated for 
each of the four major provisions is 
presented below. Table B–9 presents the 
average cost per affected establishment 
across industries. The total annualized 
cost of compliance with the proposed 
rule is estimated to be about $123 
million. The major provisions 
generating employer compliance costs 
are: assembly/disassembly, power-line 
safety, inspections, and operator 
qualification and certification. There are 
provisions in the standard that may 
generate minor, but new, costs for 
affected employers. These provisions 
are noted in detailed estimates of 
paperwork costs in that section of the 
preamble below. The Agency seeks 
comment on whether these costs are 
covered under current practices, or are 
of sufficient magnitude to affect the 
overall total of costs of the proposal. 
Estimation of Compliance Costs 

The costs of compliance presented in 
this analysis are based on data from the 
CB ‘‘2002 Economic Census,’’ IRS 
Statistics of Income ‘‘2002 Corporate 
Source Book,’’ and D&B ‘‘2002 Market 
Profiles.’’ OSHA’s cost model was 
originally developed as part of the 
Preliminary Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (PIRFA), prepared 
for the Small Business Advocacy 
Review Panel (the Panel). The Panel 
process solicited comment from small 
businesses which would be impacted by 
the new standard, and the Panel

Estimates of Cranes and Crane Jobs 

The Agency estimates that there are 

about 164,500 establishments using 
about 96,000 cranes that would fall 
under the scope of the proposal. In the 

PIRFA, the Agency had estimated the 
number of cranes at about 92,000, with 
fewer establishments using them. Based 
on comments from the Panel’s SERs, 
OSHA increased the estimated number 

of cranes in the Own but Do Not Rent 
category. OSHA also broadened and 
increased the industries and 
establishments in the Crane Lessees’ 
category—which has almost 90 percent

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

of all affected establishments—to 
include light and heavy construction 
entities. These revisions account for the 
difference in estimated establishments, 
firms, and employees between the 
PIRFA and this PEA. 

In the PIRFA, the Agency estimated 

the total annual number of crane jobs at 
368,000, or about 4 jobs per crane. For 
the purposes of this analysis, a crane job 
is defined as beginning when the crane 
is put into use at a site and ending when 
the crane is either moved (which 
triggers an assessment of ground 
conditions and power lines) or when an 
increasingly hazardous situation occurs 
(e.g., excess rain which affects ground 
conditions) which triggers other 
requirements of the standard (e.g., post- 
assembly inspection, re-assembly, 

ground conditions assessment, power 
lines assessment). While no SER 
provided an alternative estimate of the 
number of crane jobs performed, some 
stated that OSHA’s estimate was 
extremely low—and that rented cranes 
are used much more frequently. Also, a 
few SERs stated that some 
establishments that were categorized as 
Crane Lessees own their own cranes, 
and some employers categorized as 
owning cranes typically lease them, or 
both own and lease their own cranes. As 
a result of these comments, the Agency 
increased its estimate of the number of 
cranes in use, as noted above, and 
increased the annual average number of 
crane jobs per establishment to five. 
With the increase in the number of 

establishments in the Crane Lessee 
sector and the number of cranes in use, 
the total number of annual crane jobs is 
estimated to be about 860,000 per year. 
(Also as a result of these changes, the 
intensity of use of rental cranes is 
estimated to be much higher—on 
average over ten jobs per year, per rental 
crane.) These revisions in the cost 
model resulted in a higher estimated 
total cost for the proposed standard 
compared to the PIRFA, as more 
establishments and cranes are affected; 
however, these revisions increase the 
average estimated per establishment 
cost only slightly. Table B–10 presents 
information on numbers of cranes and 
crane jobs across affected industry 
sectors.

tion averages about $250 per person.

Ground Conditions and Assembly/ 
Disassembly 

The proposal requires employers to 
ensure that site and ground conditions 
are adequate for safe assembly/ 
disassembly (A/D) operations, including 
meeting ground condition criteria. 
Initially, an A/D supervisor must assess 
the ground conditions for conformance 
with those criteria and assess the site for 
suitability for assembly and 
disassembly. Accordingly, before 
beginning assembly/disassembly, the A/ 
D supervisor would have to make the 
determination that ground-bearing 
conditions are adequate to support the 
equipment during assembly/ 
disassembly. In addition, the A/D 
supervisor would have to consider the 

adequacy of site conditions that might 
affect the safety of assembly or 
disassembly. For example, at a 
construction site in an industrial facility 
with overhead piping carrying 
hazardous materials, the A/D supervisor 
would have to consider the potential for 
the equipment contacting the piping in 
determining where and how to conduct 
the assembly/disassembly operations. 
The following is an example of how 

OSHA determined the cost for A/D 
operations. The cost for these operations 
for the Own-and-Rent-Cranes-with- 
Operators sector in NAIC 236115 was 
estimated to be $19,067 annually (Table 
B–8). OSHA calculated this cost as 
follows: 

• Determining power-line and ground 

conditions for all jobs = $8,873 (490

($36.22/hour) and laborer wage ($16.04/ 
hour))). 

Some subtotals above may not exactly 
match the figures in parenthesis due to 
rounding factors. 

C–DAC believed that crane tip-over 

incidents caused by inadequate ground 
conditions are a significant cause of 
injuries and fatalities. Conditions that 
increase the risk of such accidents 
include ground that is wet or muddy, 
poorly graded, or that consists of loose 
fill (or otherwise disturbed soil) that has 
not been sufficiently compacted. The 
Committee believed that requiring 
adequate ground conditions will 
prevent many of these accidents. 

To perform these assessments, OSHA 
estimates that 30 minutes, on average, of 
assembly/disassembly (AD) supervisor 
time would be needed for each crane job 
(Table B–11). While there are 
requirements for disassembly, the 
Agency estimates that all of the costs 
will be incurred during the assembly 
process. Most of the problems dealing 
with disassembly are prohibited 
practices, which do not involve new 
costs to employers. 

Many SERs offered input on the time 

needed to make the ground-condition 
assessment. While some time estimates 
were given, one SER stated that the time 
to assure adequate site assessment was 
not the issue; rather, the whole team 
needed to have input to assess the 
operations, including the crane 
operator. Another SER stated ‘‘this cost 
is part of normal operations.’’ Due to the 
range of estimates, OSHA believes that 
the 30-minute estimate is reasonable. 

The Agency did not assume any 

current baseline for the costs of this 
provision, and seeks comment about 
current practices. 
Power-Line Safety 

Under the proposed standard, before 
beginning crane operations, employers 
must either: (1) Define a work zone with 
demarcated boundaries by using flags or 
a device such as a range-limiting device 
or range-control warning device that 
prohibits the operator from operating 
the crane past those boundaries, or (2) 
define the work zone as the area 360 
degrees around the crane based on the 
crane’s maximum working radius (see 
proposed 1408(a)(1)). The Agency 
estimates that, in most cases, the least- 
cost option would be to mark the zone 
with flags. Based on the defined work 
zone, the employer must determine 
whether the crane, load, or load line, if 
operated to its maximum working 
radius, could get closer than 20 feet to 
a power line. The Agency estimates that 
it will take a qualified person about 15 
minutes to mark the work zone with

flags and then determine whether the 
crane could come closer than 20 feet to 
a power line. 

If the 20-foot determination is 

positive, then the employer would be 
required to take additional steps. 
Specifically, the employer would be 
required to meet the proposed 
requirements under one of three 
options. If any part of the crane, load, 
or load line could not come within more 
than 20 feet of a power line, the 
employer would not be required to take 
any further action. 

The Agency estimates that 25 percent 
of all crane jobs would require that the 
crane be assembled or disassembled 
near a power line, which will take an 
estimated average of 15 additional 
minutes of a qualified person’s time. If 
the crane operations take the crane 
closer than 20 feet, the employer must 
either: (1) De-Energize and visibly 
ground the power line, (2) maintain the 
20-foot clearance, or (3) contact the 
utility owner/operator to get the line 
voltage and maintain the appropriate 
distance (listed in Table A of the 
proposal). If the employer chooses 
Option 2 or 3, the employer must then 
maintain the appropriate distance by 
implementing several encroachment- 
prevention procedures to ensure that the 
crane does not contact the energized 
power lines. The employer in either 
case is required to implement additional 
preventive encroachment measures, 
including having a planning meeting 
with the operator and other workers 
who will be in the area of the crane, 
erecting an elevated warning line, and 
using either a proximity alarm, 
operational aids/limiting devices, a 
dedicated spotter, or an insulating link. 
The Agency estimated that a designated 
spotter would be used in 75 percent of 
the cases and a proximity alarm would 
be used in the remaining 25 percent of 
cases. The Agency estimated that: the 
spotter would be on duty an average of 
2 hours per incident; 25 percent of 
cranes are already equipped with 
proximity alarms (at no new cost to 
employers); and operators would use 
the proximity alarm instead of a 
dedicated spotter. Therefore, Agency 
did not estimate compliance costs for 
retrofitting cranes with proximity 
alarms. 

Many SERs commented on this 

provision. The majority of them 
believed that, most of the time, a 
dedicated spotter would be used; 
accordingly, OSHA made no changes to 
the assumptions used to develop the 
costs for this provision. The Agency did 
not assume any baseline current 
practices for this provision, and seeks 
comment on this assumption. 

For cranes that are not assembled near 

power lines (75 percent of all crane 
jobs), there are times when those cranes 
will operate closer than 20 feet to a 
power line, thus triggering the 
encroachment precautions in the 
proposed standard. The Agency 
estimates that this situation will occur 
30 percent of the time, thereby affecting 
22.5 percent of all these crane jobs (i.e., 
30 percent × 75 percent = 22.5 percent 
of all crane-assembly jobs not near 
power lines). 

The responses from the SERs as to the 

number of jobs that required cranes to 
work closer than 20 feet to a power line 
varied. One SER stated that as much as 
50 percent of his jobs could be within 
20 feet of power lines. Another SER 
stated that 7.3 percent of their jobs are 
within 20 feet of power lines, and .04 
percent of jobs are within 10 feet of 
power lines. One SER stated that great 
variation exists in power-line situations; 
this SER had no power-line conflicts 
during the previous year, but in other 
years, the SER reported having three or 
four such conflicts. This SER stated 
further that after 20 years of crane- 
operation experience, his company had 
only been within two feet of a power 
line once, and then the power company 
was able to cut the power temporarily 
until the crane operations were finished. 

The proposed standard allows 

employers to operate cranes closer than 
the minimum approach distances 
outlined in Table A. The Agency 
estimates that the remaining 5 percent 
of crane jobs (of the 75 percent that will 
operate close to a power line, but not be 
assembled near one) are required to do 
all of the following: 

(1) Determine minimum clearance (1 

hour of professional engineer time); 
(2) Conduct a planning meeting (2 

hours each of line owner time and 
professional engineer time); 

(3) Provide a dedicated spotter (4 

laborer time); 

(9) Limit access to employees (by 

informing employees of the limits 
during training, and by using 
barricades); 

(10) Provide non-conductive rigging 
(already being done under consensus 
standards and current industry 
practice); and 

hours per job); 

(4) Erect an elevated warning line (15 

minutes of laborer time); 

(5) Use an insulating link ($427 

annualized cost); 

(6) Ground equipment (30 minutes of 

professional engineer time); 

(7) Develop written procedures 

(during the meeting between the line 
owner and professional engineer); 

(8) Erect barricades (15 minutes of

(11) Deactivate automatic re- 

energizers (30 minutes for the line 
owner or professional engineer). 

Due to the closeness of the power line 

to the crane operations in these 
situations, many SERs stated that they 
perform duties similar to those required 
by the proposed standard. Some even 
stated that they go beyond what is 
required in the proposal by establishing 
‘‘no swing’’ zones, marking boundaries 
of these zones with safety fencing and 
signs, and assigning a spotter to stay in 
communication with the operator to 
keep the crane boom out of the swing 
zone. Another SER stated that the power 
line could either be de-energized or 
relocated until the project is completed. 
This opinion was not shared by many 
other SERs, who believed that getting 
the power line de-energized is not an 
option. One SER stated that OSHA has 
failed to recognize the logistics of a 
power-line situation, which involve 
meetings, planning, and making 
preparations. This SER continued by 
stating that the utility company often 
adds costs through delays, and that 
costs of preparation are substantial and 
not accounted for by OSHA. Also, each 
job is specific, and it would be 
irresponsible to generalize the costs to 
do this work. Another SER stated that 
OSHA’s estimates of costs were too low 
because OSHA omitted necessary travel 
time and support equipment, and 
underestimated wages. OSHA believes 
its estimates accurately reflect the 
(average) costs attributable to the 
proposed provisions on power-line 
safety, but requests comment from the 
public on the estimates. 

The following is an example of how 

OSHA determined the cost of the 
proposed power-line safety 
requirements. The total cost of these 
requirements for the Own-and-Rent- 
Cranes-with-Operators sector in NAIC 
236115 was estimated to be $17,752 
(Table B–8), which is the sum of annual 
costs for operations near power lines 
($3,714) and operations closer to power 
lines than the distances specified in 
Table A ($13,858). These cost estimates 
are based on this sector’s use of 98 
cranes on 490 jobs (Table B–10), as well 
as the unit costs described in Table B– 
11. 

The cost of operations near power 
• Hold planning meetings = $3,269

(490 crane jobs/year × 75 percent of 
crane-assembly jobs not near power

lines × 0.25 hour × (wages for 2 laborers 
(2 × $16.04/hour) + crane-operator wage 
($31.36/hour) + rigger wage ($18.59/ 
hour) + qualified-person wage ($36.33/

lines × 0.25 hour of employee wages 
($16.04/hour). 

• Determine minimum clearance 

For operations near power lines closer 
than the distances specified in Table A, 
the Agency estimated annual cost 
($13,858) as follows: 
distance = $1,168 (490 crane jobs/year × 
75 percent crane-assembly jobs not near 
power lines × 5 percent affected × 1.00 
hour × professional-engineer (or 
equivalent) wage ($63.59/hour)); 
• Hold a planning meeting = $3,516 
(490 crane jobs/year × 75 percent crane-

• Insulation for power line = $7,846 
(490 crane jobs/year × 75 percent crane- 
assembly jobs not near power lines × 5 
percent affected jobs × $427/insulation 
unit ($15,000/unit annualized over 10 
years at 7 percent with 5 crane jobs/ 
unit/year)); 
• Determine location for elevated 
warning lines = $74 (490 crane jobs/year 
× 75 percent crane-assembly jobs not 
near power lines × 5 percent affected 
jobs × 0.25 hour × laborer wage ($16.04/

• Ground equipment = $584 (490

assembly jobs not near power lines × 5 
percent affected jobs × 0.50 hour × 
professional engineer (or equivalent) 
wage ($63.59/hour)); 
• Erect and remove barricades = $74 
(490 crane jobs/year × 75 percent crane- 
assembly jobs not near power lines × 5 
percent affected jobs × 0.25 hour × 
laborer wage ($16.04/hour)); and 
• Deactivate automatic re-energizer = 
$584 (490 crane jobs/year × 75 percent 
crane-assembly jobs not near power 
lines × 5 percent affected jobs × 0.50 
hour × power-line owner wage ($63.59/ 
hour)). 
Inspections 

The proposed standard requires 

several crane inspections. The Agency 
did not attribute any costs to daily 
visual inspections because these are 
already required in some instances and 
are a common industry practice. 
However, monthly, annual, and repair 
inspections will result in some 
incremental compliance costs 
attributable to the proposed standard. 

Depending upon the type of crane, the 

current standard already requires 
monthly inspections and documentation 

for some equipment. Further, the 
current standard requires annual 
inspections (and documentation) of 
hoisting machinery. The Agency 
estimates that additional measures 
outlined in the proposed standard 
would result in some incremental cost 
increase. Thus, the Agency estimates an 
additional 15 minutes per crane for each 
type of inspection (including time spent 
for recordkeeping) is needed to comply 
with the additional measures in the 
proposed standard—the time necessary 
for a competent person to conduct a 
monthly inspection and for a qualified 
person to conduct an annual inspection. 

OSHA also estimates that employers 
would incur a cost to re-inspect cranes 
that have been repaired. The Agency 
estimates that 10 percent of all cranes 
will be repaired annually. The Agency 
further estimates that an additional 15 
minutes of a qualified person’s time 
would be needed to re-inspect the crane. 
The 15 minutes is an additional, 
incremental amount as employers are 
already performing some kind of 
equipment re-inspection to ensure that 
the equipment is safe to operate. 

The following is an example of how 

OSHA determined the cost of the 
proposed inspection requirements. The 
total annual cost of these requirements 
for the Own-and-Rent-Cranes-with- 
Operators sector in NAIC 236115 was 
estimated to be $22,341 (Table B–8). 
This cost estimate is based on this sector 
operating 98 cranes (Table B–10). The 
total cost consists of the sum of costs for 
annual and monthly inspections, as well 
as inspections following crane repairs, 
determined as follows: 
• Monthly inspections = $21,362 (98 
cranes × 12 months × 0.5 hours (Table 
B–11) × competent-person wage 
($36.33/hour)); 
cranes × 0.25 hours (from Table B–11) 
× qualified-person wage ($36.22/hour)); 
• Re-inspections following repairs = 
$89 (98 cranes × 0.1 repaired cranes × 
0.25 hours (Table B–11) × qualified 
person wage ($36.33)). 

• Annual inspections = $890 (98 

The annual and monthly inspections 

were non-controversial among the SERs, 
but the shift inspections sparked 
considerable response. One SER did not 
believe that the proposed standard 
should dictate that inspections must be 
performed prior to each shift. Also, the 
SER stated that some deficiencies only 
become apparent after operations begin. 
Implementing remedies then impacts 
the work, putting the operator in a 
difficult situation. This SER requested 
that OSHA align the proposal with the 
provisions in ANSI B30.5–2.1.2, which 
calls for ‘‘frequent inspections’’ at 
‘‘daily to monthly intervals.’’ Another

SER believed that the required 
inspections would make operations 
safer, and his company would not have 
difficulty accepting them. Likewise, 
another SER stated that his company 
currently performs many of the 
inspections that are included in the 
proposed standard, but does not 
document the inspections as the 
proposal requires. 

OSHA concludes that its time 

estimates (Table B–11) for inspections 
presented in the PIRFA are reasonable. 
The Agency seeks comment on these 
estimates, including the cost and extent 
of inspection documentation. 
Operator Certification 

The proposed standard requires 

operators to be certified or qualified. 
The Agency assumes only one operator 
for each crane, on average, in all crane- 
using sectors, and one operator for every 
four cranes in firms that rent cranes 
without operators. In addition, OSHA 
estimated a 23 percent annual turnover 
among crane operators, and that about 
one-third of the replacement operators 
(i.e., 8 percent of all operators) would 
require certification/qualification; 
accordingly, OSHA assumes that the 
remaining replacements are properly 
certified/qualified crane operators. 

Compared to the current standards, 
the proposed standard requires more 
information that operators must know 
and understand, necessitating more 
training resources. Of the total number 
of existing operators, the Agency 
estimates that 70 percent would need to 
be certified or qualified. The remainder 
would already be certified as a result of 
existing state and local requirements. 

To estimate the cost for crane 

operators’ certification/qualification, the 
Agency used the least-cost option: 
employees attending a two-day test 
preparation course and taking the 
necessary examinations to be certified to 
operate a crane. This method would cost 
about $1,314 per operator (not 
annualized, see Table B–11 for details of 
this estimated cost). This figure reflects 
the total cost of the course, test, 
recordkeeping, and wages for operator 
course time. The Agency also estimates 
that 15 percent of the total number of 
operators needing certification/ 
qualification would fail the first test and 
need to retake the test-preparation 
course. Eight percent would need to be 
certified/qualified each year due to 
employee turnover; that is, training of 
new entrants rather than certified/ 
qualified operators moving within the 
industry. OSHA’s estimates also include 
the time needed to develop and retain 
certification/qualification records. The 
Agency has assumed that employers 

will pay for both the course and 
employee wages during training, and 
seeks comment on this assumption. In 
this regard, some industries such as 
commercial trucking and aviation 
require employees to pay wholly or 
partially for their training or 
certification. 

The annualized cost of training/ 
certification is $750 per operator in 
course expenses and 18 hours for wages 
at $31.36/hour to attend a course, which 
is about $1,314, or $187 when 
annualized over 10 years at 7 percent. 
In addition, there are annual costs for 
training new entrants (8 percent of all 
operators) and for operators to retake the 
course and tests (15 percent of all 
operators). For example, from Table B– 
8, the total cost of this provision for the 
Own-and-Rent-Cranes-with-Operators 
sector in NAIC 236115 is $42,467, 
assuming the industry has an estimated 
98 operators (Table B–10). The total cost 
of this provision was determined as 
follows: 
• Initial training (annualized) = 
$12,828 (98 operators × 70 percent 
(baseline training/certification) × $187 
(annualized training cost)); 
• Training for new entrants = $10,302 
(98 operators × 8 percent (new entrants) 
× $1,314 (non-annualized training cost); 
and 
• Retaking training = $19,316 (98 
operators × 15 percent (operators 
needing to retake training) × $1,314 
(non-annualized training cost)). 

Many SERs objected to provisions in 

the proposed standard for operator 
certification/qualification, though some 
SERs found that the proposed standard 
adequately addresses a long-neglected 
problem for the construction industry. 
One SER expressed concern that his 
operator, due to his difficulty in taking 
written tests, would not be able to pass 
a written exam. The proposed standard 
allows for written tests to be 
administered orally as long as the 
employee can demonstrate the level of 
literacy needed to use the 
manufacturer’s written procedures for 
the class/type of equipment that he/she 
would be operating. Also, the Panel 
recommended that OSHA consider and 
solicit public comment on allowing an 
operator to be certified for a specific, 
limited type of operation. In such a case, 
a defined set of parameters would limit 
the operator to simple, relatively low- 
risk operations. OSHA seeks comment 
on whether such parameters could be 
identified in a way that would result in 
a clear, easily understood provision that 
could be effectively enforced. 

Some SERs were concerned that, to 
become certified/qualified, employees 
would have to be proficient in English. 

These SERs were concerned that, as a 
result, the certification/qualification 
requirement would be burdensome for 
employers who have operators who are 
unable to speak English. The Panel 
stated that the proposed standard does 
not require that the certification/ 
qualification process be administered in 
English. First, the proposed rule allows 
employees to take the written portion of 
the certification/qualification test orally; 
there is no requirement that testing be 
done in English. In such a case, the 
operator candidate would have to 
demonstrate the ability to read and 
locate relevant information in the 
equipment manual and other related 
materials. However, the proposed 
standard does not specify that such 
materials be in English. In short, the 
candidates must have a level of literacy 
commensurate with the materials. If 
materials are in the candidate’s 
language, the terms of the provision 
would be met. 
Provisions in the Proposed Standard 
without Major Cost 

The provisions described above 

contain the requirements OSHA 
believes will result in major costs for 
affected employers. There are, of course, 
numerous other requirements in the 
proposal that the Agency assumes will 
not impose any compliance costs. 
OSHA notes, however, that even if some 
of these provisions resulted in costs to 
employers, they would not, in total, be 
of a magnitude to affect the economic 
feasibility findings of this PEA. The 
compliance costs of the proposed rule 
are small with respect to the average 
revenues and profits of affected 
establishments. Even if there were 
additional costs placed on employers by 
the proposed rule, it would not 
‘‘ ‘threaten massive dislocation’ to or 
imperil the existence of the industry’’ 
(United Steelworkers v. Marshall, 647 
F.2d 1189, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (cert. 
denied) (cites omitted)). (Section 7 of 
this PEA also discusses economic 
feasibility.) The Agency seeks comments 
on this and all assumptions used in this 
analysis. 

Many of the provisions in the 

proposed rule are similar to existing 
national consensus standards. In some 
instances, the C–DAC incorporated 
national consensus standards by 
reference. (See, e.g., proposed 
1926.1414(c)(4)(ii)(C); 
1926.1423(c)(2)(i); 1926.1433(b); 
1926.1436(c)(1)(ii); 1926.1438(b)(2)(iii); 
1926.1440(c). In other instances, the C– 
DAC adopted the substantive 
requirements of a national consensus 
standard, but clarified the text and made 
it enforceable. For example, most of the

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

requirements in proposed 1926.1436, 
Derricks are similar to those in ANSI/ 
ASME B30.6–2003, while proposed 
1926.1426, Free Fall and Controlled 
Load Lowering includes the protective 
methods and mechanisms found in 
ASME B30.5–2004. These national 
consensus standards reflect industry 
current practices and are the baseline 
against which the new, incremental 
costs and benefits of the proposed rule 
are measured. Therefore, if the proposed 
rule requires a level of safety equivalent 
to that in an existing national consensus 
standard, then no difference exists 
between the proposed regulatory 
language and the baseline, and the 
proposed rule imposes no additional 
cost on employers. If, however, the 
proposed standard is more stringent 
than the consensus standard, the 
Agency concludes that all employers 
would incur new, incremental 
compliance costs solely attributable to 
the OSHA rule. 

In addition, some of the provisions in 
the proposal are already required by, or 
based on provisions in, existing Subpart 
N. Section 1926.1425, Keeping Clear of 
the Load, for example, sets forth 
requirements to ensure that employees 
are protected from struck-by hazards 
associated with lifted and suspended 
loads. A similar requirement to keep 
employees clear of ‘‘loads about to be 
lifted and suspended’’ is in existing 
Subpart N at 1926.550(a)(19). Also, as 
explained in the Summary and 
Explanation section of the preamble 
above, proposed 1926.1431, Hoisting 
Personnel essentially duplicates existing 
requirements of Subpart N, as does 
proposed 1926.1418, Authority to Stop 
Operation. (See, also, proposed 1424, 
Work Area Control and proposed 1434, 
Equipment Modifications.) Because 
OSHA assumes employers are already 
complying with the requirements in 
existing Subpart N, provisions in the 
proposal that essentially duplicate these 

requirements would result in no 
incremental compliance costs to 
employers. 

Finally, as described above, the 

members of the C–DAC had vast 
experience with cranes/derricks and, 
when appropriate, developed 
requirements that reflect current 
industry practices. For some provisions, 
the Committee determined that a 
different approach was warranted (e.g., 
power-line safety and operator 
qualification/certification). As described 
above, OSHA provided estimated costs 
for these provisions. 

In the table below, OSHA identifies 

provisions in the proposed rule that do 
not result in new, incremental 
compliance costs and provides its 
rationale for this determination. During 
the SBAR Panel process, SERs did not 
identify any of the provisions in the 
table below as imposing significant new 
costs. 

TABLE B–12—PROVISIONS FOR WHICH OSHA DID NOT ESTIMATE NEW, INCREMENTAL COSTS 

Proposed requirement 

Consensus standard/comment 

1413 Wire Rope—inspections .................................................................. Reflects similar concepts found in ASME B30.5 (2004). 
(b)  Monthly  inspections—(1)  Each  month  an  inspection  shall  be  con-
ducted in accordance with paragraph 1413(a) (wire rope shift inspec-
tion). 

(c) Annual/comprehensive—(1) At least every 12 months, wire ropes in 
use on equipment shall be inspected by a qualified person in accord-
ance with paragraph 1413 (a) (shift inspection). 

1415 Safety devices ................................................................................. Similar devices are found in ASME B30.5 (2004). 
(a)  Safety  devices.  The  following  safety  devices  are  required  on  all 
equipment  covered  by  this  Subpart,  unless  otherwise  specified:  (1) 
Crane  level  indicator;  (2)  Boom  stops,  except  for  derricks  and  hy-
draulic booms; (3) Jib stops (if a jib is attached), except for derricks; 
(4)  Equipment  with  foot  pedal  brakes  shall  have  locks,  except  for 
portal  cranes  and  floating  cranes;  (5)  Hydraulic  outrigger  jacks  shall 
have  an  integral  holding  device/check  valve;  and  (6)  Equipment  on 
rails shall have rail clamps and rail stops, except for portal cranes.

While ASME does not require work to be delayed if the devices are not 
in  proper  working  order-which  the  proposal  does  require.  Current 
crane inspection requirements provide that any deficiencies be iden-
tified. 

(b)  Proper  operation  required.  Operations  shall  not  begin  unless  the 
devices listed in this section are in proper working order. If a device 
stops  working  properly  during  operations,  the  operator  shall  safely 
stop operations. Operations shall not resume until the device is again 
working properly. Alternative measures are not permitted to be used.

1416 Operational aids .............................................................................. Similar to requirements in ASME B30.5–2004. 
(a)  The  devices  listed  in  this  section  (‘‘listed  operational  aids’’)  are  re-
quired  on  all  equipment  covered  by  this  Subpart,  unless  otherwise 
specified. 

(d)  Category  1  operational  aids  and  alternative  measures:  (1)  Boom 
hoist limiting device; (2) Luffing jib limiting device; (3) Anti two-block-
ing device. 

(e) Category 2 operational aids: (1) Boom angle or radius indicator; (2) 
Jib angle indicator if the equipment has a luffing jib; (3) Boom length 
indicator  if  the  equipment  has  a  telescopic  boom,  except  where  the 
load rating is independent of the boom length; (4) Load weighing and 
similar  devices;  (5)  Outrigger  position  (horizontal  beam  extension) 
sensor/monitor if the equipment has outriggers; and (5)(ii) Hoist drum 
rotation indicator if the drum is not visible from the operator’s station. 

(u)(2) Where traveling with a load, the employer shall ensure that: (i) A 
competent  person  supervises  the  operation,  determines  if  it  is  nec-
essary to reduce rated capacity, and makes determinations regarding 
load  position,  boom  location,  ground  support,  travel  route,  overhead 
obstructions, and speed of movement necessary to ensure safety.

1417 Operation ......................................................................................... OSHA  believes  this  duty  is  currently  performed  by  a  supervisor  or 
other  personnel  in  accord  with  similar  provisions  in  ASME  B30.5

TABLE B–12—PROVISIONS FOR WHICH OSHA DID NOT ESTIMATE NEW, INCREMENTAL COSTS—Continued 

Proposed requirement 

Consensus standard/comment 

1423 Fall protection .................................................................................. The  proposal  requires  all  new  equipment  built  with  lattice  booms  to 
have  walkways.  The  Agency  estimates  this  will  add  $4,000  to  the 
crane’s  price,  a  small  percentage  of  a  crane’s  cost.  There  is  no  re-
quirement  to  retrofit  existing  cranes,  and,  therefore,  no  estimated 
costs imposed on employers. 

1428 Signal Person Qualifications ........................................................... The  Agency  believes  this  is  a  very  minor  cost  and  seeks  comment  on 

current practices from the public. 

1430 Training ............................................................................................ The  proposal  includes  an  employer  evaluation.  OSHA  believes  this 
evaluation  is  currently  being  made  by  employers;  thus  the  Agency 
did not estimate additional compliance costs. 

(b)(1)  Boom  Walkways.  Equipment  manufactured  more  than  one  year 
after  effective  date  of  standard  with  lattice  booms  shall  be  equipped 
with walkways on the boom(s) if the vertical profile of the boom (from 
cord centerline to cord centerline) is 6 or more feet. 

Paragraph  (a)(3)  requires  that  the  signal  personal  evaluation  be  docu-

mented 

(g)(1) The employer shall ensure that employees required to be trained 
under this Subpart are evaluated to confirm that they understand the 
information provided in the training. 

1432 Multiple-crane/derrick lifts Plan development [paragraph (a)] is re-

quired before lifts with more than one piece of equipment.

2004 ANSI B30.5—3.2.1.5(k) A designated person (DP) is responsible 
for  multi-crane  lifts.  The  DP  must  analyze  the  operation,  direct  all 
personnel,  and  address  changes  in  crane  ratings,  load  position, 
boom  location,  ground  support,  and  speed,  which  the  Agency  be-
lieves is equivalent to the proposal. 

(b)(2) Supervisors must review the plan with workers ............................. The  Agency  seeks  comment  on  whether  1432(b)(2)  is  current  industry 
practice.  The  Agency’s  paperwork  package  has  estimated  that  this 
function may entail some costs; however, if it is current practice this 
provision would not add a new cost of compliance. 

1433 Design, construction, and testing .................................................... 2004 ANSI 30.5 Chapters 5.1 and 5.2 
These provisions explicitly reference ANSI B30.5, SAE J 987 and 1063 

The  Agency  believes  that  the  consensus  standards  are  equivalent  to 

for criteria.

1437  Floating  cranes/derricks  Paragraph  (n)(2)  refers  to  reducing  the 

rating of land cranes used on vessels.

provisions in the proposal. 

2004 ANSI B30.5–1.1.1(e) specifies that this determination be made by 
the  manufacturer  or  a  qualified  person.  The  Agency  believes  this  is 
equivalent to the proposal. 

Sensitivity of Estimates 

The primary variable affecting the 

estimate of the total cost of the standard 
is the Agency’s estimate of the number 
of cranes, and, secondarily, the average 
annual number of jobs performed per 
crane. All four of the major provisions 
that generate costs (operator 
certification, assembly/disassembly, 
inspections, and power-line safety) 
depend on the number of cranes. Costs 
for operators’ certification and 
inspections are almost wholly a 
function of the number of cranes. The 
total estimated cost of the proposal 
varies directly and in rough proportion 
to the estimate of the number of cranes, 
with some minor dependence on the 
industries in which cranes are found. 
(The Agency has also estimated costs for 
operator certification as if all operators 
will be certified in the first year of the 
proposed four-year phase-in period. If 
included in the analysis, this factor (the 
4-year phase-in) could introduce 
sources of variation in employers’ costs 
as well.) The Agency’s estimate of the 
average annual number of jobs per crane 
drives costs for jobsite assembly/ 
disassembly and power-line safety 
provisions and is a secondary source of

variability of cost estimates. However, 
this statistic introduces possible 
variability on the economic impact on 
employers, since it affects individual 
employer costs. In comparison, the 
estimate of the total number of cranes 
affects overall cost estimates without 
affecting individual employer costs in 
the cost model. 

When the initial one-time cost of 

operator qualification/certification is 
annualized with a 3 percent rather than 
a 7 percent discount rate, the annual 
total costs are little affected. The cost for 
that provision alone falls to about $35.3 
million annually from about $37.3 
million, similarly reducing total annual 
costs from about $123 million to $121 
million, or less than two percent. The 
overall costs are therefore not sensitive 
to the discount rate used in cost 
modeling. 
7. Economic Feasibility and Impacts 

This section presents OSHA’s analysis 
of the potential economic impacts of the 
proposal and an assessment of economic 
feasibility. A separate analysis of the 
potential economic impacts on small 
entities (as defined by the criteria 
established by the Small Business 
Administration) and on very small 

entities (employers with fewer than 20 
employees) is presented in the following 
section as part of the Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis, conducted in 
accordance with the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 

A standard is economically feasible if 
it does not threaten massive dislocation 
to an industry or imperil its existence. 
(See United Steelworkers v. Marshall, 
647 F.2d 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). The 
court also found that a standard that is 
financially burdensome or threatens the 
survival of some companies in an 
industry is also not sufficient to render 
it infeasible. Further, the cost of 
compliance with an OSHA standard 
must be analyzed ‘‘in relation to the 
financial health and profitability of the 
industry and the likely effect of such 
costs on unit consumer prices.’’ Id. The 
court also found that ‘‘the practical 
question is whether the standard 
threatens the competitive stability of an 
industry, or whether any intra-industry 
or inter-industry discrimination in the 
standard might wreck such stability or 
lead to undue concentration.’’ Id. 

To assess the potential economic 
impacts of the proposed rule, OSHA 
compared the anticipated costs of

achieving compliance against revenues 
and profits of establishments affected by 
the rule. This screening analysis is 
presented in Table B–13. This table is 
considered a screening analysis because 
it measures costs as a percentage of pre- 
tax profits and revenues, but does not 
predict impacts on pre-tax profits and 
sales. This screening analysis is used to 
determine whether the compliance costs 
potentially associated with the standard 
would lead to significant impacts on 
establishments in the affected 
industries. The actual impact of the 
standard on the profits and revenues of 
establishments in a given industry will 
depend on the price elasticity of 
demand for the services sold by 
establishments in that industry. 

Price elasticity refers to the 

relationship between the price charged 
for a service and the demand for that 
service; that is, the more elastic the 
relationship, the less able an 
establishment is to pass the costs of 
compliance through to its customers in 
the form of a price increase and the 

more it will have to absorb the costs of 
compliance from its profits. 
When demand is inelastic, 

establishments can recover all the costs 
of compliance simply by raising the 
prices they charge for that service; 
under this scenario, profits are 
untouched. On the other hand, when 
demand is elastic, establishments 
cannot recover all the costs simply by 
passing the cost increase through in the 
form of a price increase; instead, they 
must absorb some of the increase from 
their profits. In general, ‘‘when an 
industry is subject to a higher cost, it 
does not simply swallow it, it raises its 
price and reduces its output, and in this 
way shifts a part of the cost to its 
consumers and a part to its suppliers,’’ 
American Dental Association v. 
Secretary of Labor, (984 F.2d 823, 829 
(7th Cir. 1993). Specifically, if demand 
is completely inelastic (i.e., price 
elasticity is 0), then the impact of 
compliance costs that amount to 1 
percent of revenues would be a 1 
percent increase in the price of the 

product or service, with no decline in 
demand or profits. Such a situation 
would be most likely when there are 
few, if any, substitutes for the product 
or service offered by the affected sector 
or if the products or services of the 
affected sector account only for a small 
portion of the income of its consumers. 
If the demand is perfectly elastic (i.e., 
the price elasticity is infinitely large), 
then no increase in price is possible, 
and before-tax profits would be reduced 
by an amount equal to the costs of 
compliance (minus any savings 
resulting from improved worker health 
and reduced insurance costs). Under 
this scenario, if the costs of compliance 
represent a large percentage of the 
sector’s profits, some establishments 
might be forced to close. This scenario 
is highly unlikely to occur, however, 
because it can only arise when there are 
other goods and services that are, in the 
eye of the consumer, perfect substitutes 
for the goods and services the affected 
establishments produce or provide.

A common intermediate case would 

be a price elasticity of one. In this 
situation, if the costs of compliance 
amount to 1 percent of revenues, then 

production would decline by 1 percent 
and prices would rise by 1 percent. The 
sector would remain in business and 
maintain approximately the same profit 

rate as before implementation of the 
standard, but would produce 1 percent 
less of its services. Consumers would 
effectively absorb the costs through a

combination of increased prices and 
reduced consumption; this, as the court 
described in ADA v. Secretary of Labor, 
is the more typical case. 

Table B–13 presents estimates for the 

number of affected establishments, 
average establishment revenues and 
profits, and average establishment costs 
for each affected industry sector. 
Economic impacts in the table (the two 
right-most columns) are represented by 
two ratios: of average establishment 
costs to revenues, and of costs to profits. 
In the Own and Rent Cranes with 
Operators sector, the impacts for a 
number of sectors are identical. This 
effect is an artifact of the cost model, 
which estimates the number of cranes, 
and hence costs, based on revenues. 
Since profits are also derived from 
revenues, the impacts parallel one 
another in several industry sectors. 

As is evident from the data and 
estimates in Table B–13, average 
establishment costs of compliance for 
the proposal are not large in relation to 
the corresponding average 
establishment revenues and profits in 
each of the industry sectors. The 
estimated per establishment cost of 
compliance represents at most, less than 
0.26 percent (or 0.0026) of average 
establishment revenues. In most sectors 
it is lower. 

The impact of the proposal measured 

by the ratio of costs to profits varies 
across the affected sectors. Among the 
sectors in the Crane Lessees sector, 
which includes about 142,500 of the 
164,500 affected establishments, average 
employers are expected to have costs 
that represent much less than 1 percent 
of profits. Within the sector of 
employers Own but Do Not Rent, 
affected establishments in 11 of the 30 
sectors have average costs as high as a 
few percent of profits (from 2 to 6 
percent). This estimate of impact on 
costs as a percentage of profits is low, 
but OSHA notes that, for a few 
individual industries, the costs as a 
percentage of profits may be 
‘‘significant’’ (over 5 percent). The 
Agency believes that in part the impact 
measure is high because the cost of 
compliance is compared with average 
revenues and profits for the industry as 
a whole. There are many very small 
employers across these industries, while 
it is likely that only larger employers 
own cranes. In that case, the average 
establishment’s estimated revenue and 
profit are lower than that of affected 
establishments that own cranes, 
resulting in a too-high ratio (or 
percentage) of costs to profits for the 
affected employers. The Agency seeks 
comment on this.

In the two sectors that are most 

intensively involved in crane use, Crane 
Rental with Operators (employers 
primarily in the crane rental business) 
and Crane Rental without Operators 
(bare rentals), estimated costs are about 
3 to 4 percent of profits. In the Own and 
Rent Cranes with Operators sectors, 
costs as a percentage of profits are 
estimated at 5 to 6 percent. Because 
these employers both own and use 
cranes as well as rent them, the cost 
model estimates significantly higher 
average establishment costs for them— 
even in relation to the sectors involved 
primarily in crane rentals. In addition, 
as noted above for the Own but Do Not 
Rent sector, most employers in these 
sectors are quite small, with only a few 
employees, and a relatively small 
fraction of employers in the sectors 
actually own cranes. Consequently, the 
average establishment revenues and 
profits may be considerably lower for 
the average establishment than for 
establishments that own cranes. If so, 
the cost as a percentage of profits 
overestimates that impact for affected 
establishments. The Agency seeks 
comment and additional data on this 
issue. 

The Agency preliminarily concludes 

that the proposal is economically 
feasible for the affected industries. As 
described above, a standard is 
economically feasible if there is a 
reasonable likelihood that the estimated 
costs of compliance ‘‘will not threaten 
the existence or competitive structure of 
an industry, even if it does portend 
disaster for some marginal firms’’ 
(United Steelworkers of America v. 
Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1272 (D.C. Cir. 
1980). The potential impacts on 
employer costs associated with 
achieving compliance with the proposal 
fall well within the bounds of economic 
feasibility in each industry sector. Costs 
of 0.25 percent of revenues and 5 
percent of profits will not threaten the 
existence of the construction industry or 
the potential use of cranes in 
construction. OSHA does not expect 
compliance with the requirements of the 
proposal to threaten the viability of 
employers or the competitive structure 
of any of the affected industry sectors. 

For several reasons, the Agency 

believes that the impact of compliance 
costs will be less than estimates in Table 
B–13. The economic impact of the 
proposal is most likely to consist of a 
very small increase in prices for 
construction projects involving work 
with cranes (0.26 percent or less, 
depending on the sector). Crane rental 
companies, all of which must incur the 
costs of compliance unless they are 
already in compliance, should be able to 

pass through costs to lessees. The 
additional costs of crane safety 
measures are extremely small in relation 
to value of construction, and there are 
no economic substitutes, or alternatives, 
to the use of cranes in construction. It 
is unlikely that a price increase of this 
magnitude would significantly alter the 
services demanded by the public or any 
other affected customers or 
intermediaries. If the compliance costs 
of the proposal are substantially 
recouped with an increase in rental 
prices, there would be little effect on 
profits. 

Given the small incremental increases 

in prices potentially resulting from 
compliance with the proposed standard 
and the lack of readily available 
substitutes for the products and services 
provided by the covered industry 
sectors, demand is expected to be 
sufficiently inelastic in each affected 
industry to enable entities to 
substantially offset compliance costs 
through minor price increases without 
experiencing any significant reduction 
in revenues or profits. 
8. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act, as 

amended in 1996, requires the 
preparation of an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) for certain 
proposed rules (5 U.S.C. 601–612). 
Under the provisions of the law, each 
such analysis must contain: 

1. A description of the impact of the 

proposed rule on small entities; 

2. a description of the reasons why 

action by the agency is being 
considered; 

3. a succinct statement of the 

objectives of, and legal basis for, the 
proposed rule; 

4. a description of and, where 

feasible, an estimate of the number of 
small entities to which the proposed 
rule will apply; 

5. a description of the projected 
reporting, recordkeeping and other 
compliance requirements of the 
proposed rule, including an estimate of 
the classes of small entities that will be 
subject to the requirements and the type 
of professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record; 
6. an identification, to the extent 

practicable, of all relevant Federal rules 
that may duplicate, overlap or conflict 
with the proposed rule; and 

7. a description and discussion of any 
significant alternatives to the proposed 
rule that accomplish the stated 
objectives of applicable statutes and that 
minimize any significant economic 
impact of the proposed rule on small 
entities, including:

59901 

(a) The establishment of differing 

compliance or reporting requirements or 
timetables that take into account the 
resources available to small entities; 

(b) the clarification, consolidation, or 

simplification of compliance and 
reporting requirements under the rule 
for such small entities; 

(c) the use of performance rather than 

design standards; and 

(d) an exemption from coverage of the 
rule, or any part thereof, for such small 
entities. 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act further 

states that the required elements of the 
IRFA may be performed in conjunction 
with or as part of any other agenda or 
analysis required by any other law if 
such other analysis satisfies the relevant 
provisions. 

1. Impact of the proposed rule on 

small entities. 

OSHA has analyzed the potential 
impact of the proposed standards on 
small entities. The total annual cost of 
compliance with the proposal for small 
entities is estimated to be $105 million, 
as shown by industry in Table B–14. 
The costs per establishment in the table 
are identical in several sectors because 
the cost model assumed that, on 
average, the number of cranes, 
operators, and crane jobs were the same 
for each affected establishment. In the 

crane-rental sectors, the Agency had 
rental income data for each sector and 
estimated the number of cranes owned 
per establishment for each sector. 
Different sizes of firms with different 
numbers of cranes in the rental sectors 
resulted in per establishment (average) 
costs varying by industry NAICS 
identifier. 

To assess the potential economic 

impact of the proposal on small entities, 
OSHA calculated the ratios of 
compliance costs to profits and to 
revenues. These impacts are presented 
for each affected industry in Table B–15. 
OSHA expects that among small entities 
potentially affected by the proposal, the 
average increase in prices necessary to 
completely offset the compliance costs 
would be 0.08 percent. The average 
price increase necessary to completely 
offset compliance costs would not 
exceed 0.26 percent among small 
entities in any industry. 

Only to the extent that such price 

increases are not possible would there 
be any effect on the average profits of 
small entities. Even in the unlikely 
event that no costs could be passed 
through, the compliance costs could be 
completely absorbed through an average 
reduction in profits of 1.8 percent. In 
most affected industries the compliance 
costs, without any pass-through, could 

be completely absorbed through an 
average reduction in profits of less than 
1 percent; the reduction would be no 
more than 6.64 percent in any of the 
affected industries. 

In order to further ensure that 

potential impacts on small entities were 
fully analyzed and considered, OSHA 
also separately examined the potential 
impacts of the proposed standards on 
very small entities, defined as 
employers with fewer than 20 
employees. To assess the potential 
economic impact of the proposed 
standards on very small entities, OSHA 
calculated the ratios of compliance costs 
to profits and to revenues. These ratios 
are presented for each affected industry 
in Table B–16. OSHA expects that 
among very small entities potentially 
affected by the proposed standards, the 
average increase in prices necessary to 
completely offset the compliance costs 
would be 0.11 percent (less than 1 
percent). 

Only to the extent that such price 

increases are not possible would there 
be any effect on the average profits of 
very small entities. Even in the unlikely 
event that no costs could be passed 
through, the compliance costs could be 
completely absorbed through an average 
reduction in profits of 2.60 percent 
among affected very small entities.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Although some of these incidents may 

have been prevented with better 
compliance with existing safety 
standards, research and analyses 
conducted by OSHA have found that 
most injuries and fatalities would be 
prevented through compliance with the 
proposed standard. In this regard, the 
existing OSHA standards for the 
construction industry do not directly 
address all of the hazards associated 
with work involving cranes/derricks in 
a comprehensive manner. An estimated 
53 fatalities and 155 injuries would be 
prevented annually through full 
compliance with the proposed standard. 
An additional and more complete 
discussion of the reasons why this 
standard is being proposed by the 
Agency is provided above in the 
Summary and Explanation section of 
the Preamble. 

3. Statement of the objectives of, and 

legal basis for, the proposed rule.  

The primary objective of the proposed 

standard is to provide an increased 
degree of occupational safety for 
employees performing construction 
work involving cranes/derricks. As 
stated above, an estimated 155 injuries 
and 53 fatalities would be prevented 
annually through compliance with the 
proposed standard. Another objective of 
the proposed rulemaking is to provide 
employers and employees updated and 
more complete safety standards for 
construction work involving cranes/ 
derricks. 

The legal basis for the rule is the 

Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) 
Act of 1970. The OSH Act authorizes 
and obligates the Secretary of Labor to 
promulgate mandatory occupational 
safety and health standards as necessary 
‘‘to assure so far as possible every 
working man and woman in the Nation 
safe and healthful working conditions 
and to preserve our human resources.’’ 
29 U.S.C. 651(b). 

4. Description of and estimate of the 
number of small entities to which the 
proposed rule will apply. 

OSHA has completed a preliminary 

analysis of the economic impacts 
associated with this proposal, including 
an analysis of the type and number of 
small entities to which the proposed 
rule would apply, as described above. In 
order to determine the number of small 
entities potentially affected by this 
rulemaking, OSHA used the definitions 
of small entities developed by the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) for each 
industry. 

For the construction industry 

generally, SBA defines small businesses 
using revenue-based criteria. For most 
of the affected construction industries, 
including those industries that are

mostly comprised of general contractors, 
firms with annual revenues of less than 
$31 million are classified as small 
businesses. For specialty contractors, 
such as structural-steel erection 
contractors, firms with annual revenues 
of less than $13 million are considered 
to be small businesses. Based on the 
definitions of small entities developed 
by SBA for each industry, the proposal 
is estimated to potentially affect a total 
of 160,905 small entities, as shown in 
Tables B–14 and 15. Included in this 
number are an estimated 141,709 
entities with fewer than 20 employees 
(Table B–16). 

5. Description of the projected 

reporting, recordkeeping and other 
compliance requirements of the 
proposed rule.  

OSHA is proposing a standard which 
would address the work practices to be 
used, and other requirements to be 
followed, for performing construction 
work involving cranes/derricks. 
Employers would be required to keep 
certain records associated with 
inspections and operator certification/ 
qualification as specified by the 
proposed standard. Regular reporting 
would not be required by the proposed 
standard; however, employers would be 
required to demonstrate compliance 
with the recordkeeping requirements as 
part of OSHA compliance inspections. 

Other compliance requirements of the 
proposed standard include, as required, 
the assembly and disassembly 
requirements, encroachment prevention 
precautions when working near power 
lines, and ground condition and power 
line assessments. 

The preamble to the proposed 

standard provides a comprehensive 
description of, and further detail 
regarding, the provisions of the 
proposed rulemaking. A description of 
the types of business entities which 
would be subject to the new and revised 
requirements, and the types of 
professional skills necessary for 
compliance with the requirements, is 
presented in the preceding chapters of 
this economic analysis. 

6. Federal rules which may duplicate, 

overlap or conflict with the proposed 
rule.  

OSHA recognizes that this standard 
may overlap with provisions in other 
construction standards, such as those 
standards addressing general training 
requirements. OSHA has clarified the 
relationship between the proposed 
standard and other pre-existing 
construction standards which may be 
applicable to cranes/derricks in the 
summary and explanation section of 
this preamble. Finally, OSHA has not 
identified any other Federal rules which 

may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with 
the proposal, and requests comments 
from the public regarding this 
determination. 

7. Alternatives to the proposed rule 

which accomplish the stated objectives 
of applicable statutes and which 
minimize any significant economic 
impact of the proposed rule on small 
entities. 

OSHA and C–DAC evaluated many 

alternatives to the proposed standards to 
ensure that the proposed requirements 
would accomplish the stated objectives 
of applicable statutes and would 
minimize any significant economic 
impact of the proposal on small entities. 
In developing the proposal, OSHA took 
into account the resources available to 
small entities. An exemption from 
coverage of the rule for small entities 
was not considered to be a viable option 
because the safety and health of the 
affected employees would be unduly 
jeopardized. Other regulatory 
alternatives were recommended by the 
Small Business Advocacy Review Panel, 
which was convened for purposes of 
soliciting comments on the proposal 
from affected small entities. A 
discussion of these alternatives is 
provided below. 

Nonregulatory alternatives were also 

considered for occupational hazards 
associated with construction work 
involving cranes/derricks. These 
alternatives were discussed above in 
section 2 Identification of Market 
Failure and Need for Regulation. 

Alternatives considered and changes 

made in response to comments from 
small entities and recommendations 
from the Small Business Advocacy 
Review Panel. 

On August 18, 2006, OSHA convened 

a Small Business Advocacy Review 
Panel (the Panel) for this rulemaking in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
as codified at 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. 

The Panel consisted of representatives 
of OSHA, the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs in the Office of 
Management and Budget, and of the 
Office of Advocacy within the U.S. 
Small Business Administration. The 
Panel received oral and written 
comments on a draft proposal and a 
draft economic analysis from small 
entities (businesses) that would 
potentially be affected by the rule. The 
Panel, in turn, prepared a written report 
which was delivered to the Assistant 
Secretary for Occupational Safety and 
Health (which can be found in the 
docket for this rulemaking). The report 
summarized the comments received 
from the small entities, and included

recommendations from the Panel to 
OSHA regarding the proposal and the 
associated analysis of compliance costs. 
In response to the Panel’s 
recommendations, OSHA revised many 
of its assumptions, estimates of unit 
costs, and aspects of its economic model 
from the PIRFA for this PEA. These 
revisions are noted throughout the PEA, 
but principally in the sections for the 
industrial profile and estimates of costs 
of compliance. 

Panel Report Recommendations and 

Alternatives 

Small entity representatives (SERs) 
had an opportunity to meet with the 
Panel and comment on the draft 
proposal, as well as submit written 
comments to the Panel afterward. Some 
SERs who are in the business of 
supplying construction materials, and 
who deliver those materials to 
construction sites, believed that the 
proposed standard should not apply to 
their work. While there are many 
circumstances in which such businesses 
are not in the scope of the standard, 
there may be some circumstances in 
which they would be within the scope 
of the standard. The Panel 
recommended that OSHA consider 
excluding them from the scope of the 
standard, and solicit comment on 
whether equipment used solely to 
deliver materials to a construction site 
by placing/stacking the materials on the 
ground should be explicitly excluded 
from the proposed standard’s scope. 
OSHA has addressed this issue in the 
scope section of the preamble. 

Some SERs favored the operator 

certification/qualification section, and 
some SERs were opposed to various 
aspects of it. The Panel anticipated that 
there would be considerable public 
comment on the proposed rule 
regarding this issue. The Panel 
recommended that OSHA consider the 
information and range of opinions that 
were presented by the SERs on this 

issue when analyzing their comments. 
As noted above, the Panel 
recommended that OSHA include, as 
part of its preliminary economic 
analysis, an analysis of the costs, 
economic impacts, and benefits of 
operator certification/qualification. 
Also, based on the SERs’ comments, the 
Panel recommended that OSHA 
consider, and solicit public comment 
on, expanding the levels of certification 
so as to allow an operator to be certified 
on a specific brand and model of crane. 
OSHA has addressed this issue in the 
operator qualification and certification 
section of the preamble and in this PEA. 
Some SERs described crane operators 

whose abilities were limited to 
operating particular equipment in a very 
limited set of circumstances. They 
believed that these operators are fully 
capable of doing the work, but would be 
unable to pass certification tests that 
require knowledge and abilities beyond 
these limited circumstances. In response 
to these comments, the Panel 
recommended that OSHA consider, and 
solicit public comment on, expanding 
these provisions to allow an operator to 
be certified for specific, limited 
circumstances. Such circumstances 
would be defined by a set of parameters 
that, taken together, would limit an 
operation to simple, low-risk operations. 
Also, the Panel recommended that 
OSHA consider and solicit public 
comment on whether such parameters 
could be identified in a way that would 
result in a clear, easily understood 
provision that could be effectively 
enforced. OSHA requests comment on 
these issue. 

A SER commented that it would be 

burdensome for small employers in 
remote areas to send their operators long 
distances to have them tested, and that 
it may be difficult or costly to arrange 
to have an accredited testing 
organization come to their area to 
administer the tests. The Panel 

recommended that OSHA consider and 
solicit public comment on allowing the 
written and practical tests described in 
Option (1) of proposed § 1926.1427(b) to 
be administered by an accredited 
educational institution. Also, this issue 
has been addressed in the preamble. 
Lastly, some SERs were concerned 

that in order to become certified or 
qualified under proposed § 1926.1427, 
employees would have to be proficient 
in English. These SERs were concerned 
that, as a result, the certification/ 
qualification requirement would be 
burdensome for employers who have 
operators who are unable to speak in 
English. The Panel noted that the C– 
DAC document does not state that the 
certification/qualification process be 
administered in English. The proposed 
rule also allows employees to take the 
written portion of the certification/ 
qualification test orally. In such a case, 
the operator candidate (under 
§ 1926.1427(h) and (j)) would have to 
demonstrate the ability to read and 
locate relevant information in the 
equipment manual and other related 
materials. However, the proposed rule 
does not specify that such written 
materials would have to be in English. 
The candidate must have a level of 
literacy commensurate with these 
materials; as long as the materials are in 
the candidate’s language, the terms of 
this provision would be met. The Panel 
recommended that OSHA provide this 
interpretation in a Small Business 
Compliance Guide. OSHA has more 
fully discussed this in the preamble and 
intends to provide this interpretation in 
compliance guidance. 

Table B–17 below lists the 

recommendations made by the Panel 
and presents the Agency’s answers or 
responses. In the right-hand column of

issue is referred to in the preamble, it

OSHA response 

The Panel recommends that OSHA provide full documentation for how 
it  estimated  the  number  of  affected  small  entities  and  all  other  cal-
culations and estimates provided in the PIRFA.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  reexamine  its  estimate  of  crane 
use  in  home  building,  the  coverage  of  crane  trucks  used  for  loading 
and  unloading,  and  the  estimates  of  the  number  of  jobs  per  crane. 
Changes  in  these  estimates  should  be  incorporated  into  the  esti-
mates of costs and economic impacts.

OSHA  has  developed  a  full  preliminary  economic  analysis  (PEA)  for 
the  proposal  which  explains  all  assumptions  used  in  estimating  the 
costs and benefits of the proposed standard. 

OSHA  has  included  homebuilding  industries  in  the  ‘‘Own  but  Do  Not 

Rent’’ and ‘‘Crane Lessees’’ industrial profile categories. 

OSHA  has  presented  a  discussion  in  the  preamble  of  this  rule  of  spe-

cific equipment that meets that functional definition of a crane 

The  estimate  of  crane  jobs  per  year  has  increased  from  368,000  total 
annually  (or  4  jobs  per  crane  on  average)  to  860,000  (or  9  jobs  per 
crane on average).

TABLE B–17—RESPONSES TO SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS (ALSO FOUND IN TABLE 4 OF THE PREAMBLE)— 

Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  review  its  estimates  for  the  direct 
costs  of  operator  certification  and  seek  comment  on  these  cost  esti-
mates.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  carefully  examine  certain  types  of 
impact that could result from an operator certification requirement, in-
cluding  reports  of  substantial  increases  in  the  wages  of  operators; 
the possibility of increased market power for firms renting out cranes; 
and  loss  of  jobs  for  existing  operators  due  to  language,  literacy,  or 
knowledge problems; and seek comment on these types of impacts. 
The  Panel  also  recommends  studying  the  impacts  of  the  implemen-
tation of operator certification in CA.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  reexamine  its  estimates  for  the 
amount of time required to assess ground conditions, the number of 
persons involved in the assessment, and the amount of coordination 
involved;  clarify  the  extent  to  which  such  assessments  are  currently 
being  conducted  and  what  OSHA  estimates  as  new  costs  for  this 
rule represent; and seek comments on OSHA’s cost estimates.

The Panel recommends that OSHA carefully review the documentation 
requirements  of  the  standard,  including  documentation  that  employ-
ers  may  consider  it  prudent  to  maintain;  estimate  the  costs  of  such 
requirements;  seek  ways  of  minimizing  these  costs  consistent  with 
the  goals  of  the  OSH  Act;  and  solicit  comment  on  these  costs  and 
ways of minimizing these costs.

The Panel recommends that OSHA examine whether the inspection re-
quirements  of  the  proposed  rule  require  procedures  not  normally 
conducted  currently,  such  as  lowering  and  fully  extending  the  boom 
before  the  crane  can  be  used,  and  removing  non-hinged  inspection 
plates  during  the  shift  inspection,  estimate  the  costs  of  any  such  re-
quirements, and seek comment on these issues.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  the  costs  of  meeting  the 
requirements  for  original  load  charts  and  full  manuals,  and  solicit 
comments on such costs.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  provide  full  documentation  for  its 
analysis  of  the  benefits  the  proposed  rule  are  expected  to  produce 
and assure that the benefits analysis is reproducible by others.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment on whether the scope language should be clarified to explicitly 
state  whether  forklifts  that  are  modified  to  perform  tasks  similar  to 
equipment  (cranes  and  derricks)  modified  in  that  manner  would  be 
covered.

OSHA  has  reviewed  its  cost  estimates  in  the  PEA  for  operator  certifi-

cation and seeks comment on the estimates and methodology. 

OSHA  seeks  public  comment  on  all  aspects  (including  economic  im-
pacts,  wages,  number  of  operators,  demand,  etc.)  of  the  operator 
certification  requirements,  specifically  as  it  pertains  to  the  State  of 
California. 

OSHA  has  included  2  hours  of  travel  time  per  operator  into  the  unit 

costs for operator certification. 

The  Agency  reviewed  data  on  wage  rates  for  operators  in  California 
immediately before and after operator certification was required (Em-
ployment  Development  Department,  Labor  Market  Information  Divi-
sion, State of California, 2007). The data did not show much change 
in  operators’  wages.  The  Agency  seeks  further  comment  from  the 
public. 

OSHA seeks comment on the methodology used to calculate all of the 
costs in the PEA, which includes the costs for assessing ground con-
ditions. 

OSHA  assumed  that  inspection  of  ground  conditions  is  normal  busi-
ness  practice,  and  that,  as  a  result,  provisions  in  the  proposal  only 
add  minor  costs  to  this  practice.  The  method  of  estimating  costs  is 
explained in detail in section 6, Costs of Compliance. 

The  Agency  describes  the  documentation  requirements,  along  with 
cost estimates, in the section of this Preamble entitled ‘‘OMB Review 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.’’ 

As  explained  in  the  discussion  of  section  1412,  Inspections,  OSHA’s 
current standard at 29 CFR 1926.550 requires inspections each time 
the equipment is used as well as thorough annual inspections. In ad-
dition,  national  consensus  standards  that  are  incorporated  by  ref-
erence  include  additional  inspection  requirements.  This  proposal 
would  list  the  inspection  requirements  in  one  place  rather  than  rely 
on  incorporated  consensus  standards.  OSHA  does  not  believe  this 
proposed  standard  imposes  significant  new  requirements  for  inspec-
tions. Paragraph 1413(a) explicitly says that booming down is not re-
quired for shift (and therefore monthly) inspections. 

Similarly, OSHA does not believe that inspection of any of those items 
would require removal of non-hinged inspection plates. In the discus-
sion  of  proposed  § 1412,  OSHA  requests  public  comment  on  these 
points. 

Existing  Subpart  N,  at  29  CFR  1926.550(a)(2),  requires  load  charts; 
this  is  not  a  new  cost.  Subpart  N  does  not  require  manuals.  OSHA 
believes  that  most  crane  owners  and  operators  have  and  maintain 
crane manuals, which contain the load charts and other critical tech-
nical  information  about  crane  operations  and  maintenance.  The 
Agency believes that the cost of obtaining a copy of a manual should 
be  modest  and  solicits  comment  on  how  many  owners  or  operators 
do not have full manuals for their cranes or derricks. 

The  Agency  has  already  placed  additional  materials  into  the  rule-
making docket to aid in the reproduction of the benefits analysis. The 
Agency has also developed a full benefits analysis (section 4 of this 
PEA)  which  includes  the  methodology  and  data  sources  for  the  cal-
culations. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1400(c)(8) and solicits public comment on the issue.

TABLE B–17—RESPONSES TO SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS (ALSO FOUND IN TABLE 4 OF THE PREAMBLE)— 

Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The Panel recommends that there be a full explanation in the preamble 
of  how  responsibility  for  ensuring  adequate  ground  conditions  is 
shared  between  the  controlling  entity,  and  the  employer  of  the  indi-
vidual supervising assembly/disassembly and/or the operator.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  restate  the  applicable  corrective 
action  provisions  (which  are  set  forth  in  the  shift  inspection)  in  the 
monthly inspection section.

The Panel recommends that OSHA solicit public comment on whether, 
and under what circumstances, booming down should be specifically 
excluded  as  a  part  of  the  shift  inspection,  and  whether  the  removal 
of  non-hinged  inspection  plates  should  be  required  during  the  shift 
inspection.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  whether 
to include an exception for transportation systems in proposed para-
graph  1412(a),  which  requires  an  inspection  of  equipment  that  has 
had  modifications  or  additions  that  affect  its  safe  operation,  and,  if 
so, what the appropriate terminology for such an exception would be.
The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  explain  in  the  preamble  that  the 
shift inspection does not need to be completed prior to each shift but 
may be completed during the shift.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  about 
whether  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  the  requirement  of  proposed  para-
graph 1412(d)(1)(xi) that the equipment be inspected for ‘‘level posi-
tion.’’ 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  comment  on  whether  para-
graph  1412(f)(2)(xii)(D)  should  be  changed  to  require  that  pressure 
be inspected ‘‘at the end of the line,’’ as distinguished from ‘‘at each 
and  every  line,’’  and  if  so,  what  the  best  terminology  would  be  to 
meet this purpose. (An SER indicated that paragraph (f)(2)(xiv)(D) of 
§ 1412  should  be  modified  to  ‘‘checking  pressure  setting,’’  in  part  to 
avoid  having  to  check  the  pressure  at  ‘‘each  and  every  line’’  as  op-
posed to ‘‘at the end of the line.’’) 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  whether 
paragraph  (f)(2)(xx)  of  § 1412  should  be  deleted  because  an  SER 
believes that it is not always appropriate to retain originally-equipped 
steps and ladders, such as in instances where they are replaced with 
‘‘attaching dollies.’’ 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  the  ex-
tent of documentation of monthly and annual/comprehensive inspec-
tions the rule should require.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  whether 
the provision for monthly inspections should, like the provision for an-
nual  inspections,  specify  who  must  keep  the  documentation  associ-
ated with monthly inspections.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  ways  to  account  for  the 
possibility that there may sometimes be an extended delay in obtain-
ing  the  part  number  for  an  operational  aid  for  older  equipment  and 
solicit public comment on the extent to which this is a problem.

The  Panel  recommends  that  the  provision  on  fall  protection  (proposed 
§ 1423)  be  proposed  as  written  and  that  OSHA  explain  in  the  pre-
amble how and why the Committee arrived at this provision.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  the  potential  advantages 
of  and  solicit  public  comment  on  adding  provisions  to  proposed 
§ 1427  that  would  allow  an  operator  to  be  certified  on  a  particular 
model of crane; allow tests to be administered by an accredited edu-
cational  institution;  and  allow  employers  to  use  manuals  that  have 
been  re-written  to  accommodate  the  literacy  level  and  English  pro-
ficiency of operators.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  clarify  in  the  preamble  how  the 
proposed  rule  addresses  an  SER’s  concern  that  his  crane  operator 
would  not  be  able  to  pass  a  written  qualification/certification  exam 
because the operator has difficulty in taking written exams.

OSHA  explains  in  the  discussion  of  proposed  paragraph  1402(e)  how 
the  various  employers,  including  the  controlling  entity,  the  employer 
whose  employees  operate  the  equipment,  and  the  employer  of  the 
A/D  supervisor  share  responsibility  for  ensuring  adequate  ground 
conditions. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1412(e) and solicits public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 
paragraph  1412(d)  and  solicits  public  comment  on  the  issues  raised 
in the recommendation. 

OSHA  addresses  the  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 
paragraph  1412(a)  and  solicits  comment  on  the  issues  raised  in  the 
recommendation. 

In the explanation of paragraph 1412(d)(1) of the proposed rule, OSHA 

explains that the shift inspection may be completed during the shift. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 
paragraph 1412(d)(1)(xi) and requests public comment on the issues 
raised in the recommendation. 

There is no proposed requirement to check the pressure ‘‘at each and 
every  line.’’  The  provision  simply  states  that  relief  valves  should  be 
checked  for  failure  to  reach  correct  pressure.  If  this  can  be  done  at 
one  point  for  the  entire  system,  then  that  would  satisfy  the  require-
ment. 

Proposed  paragraph  1412(f)(2)(xx)  does  not  require  the  corrective  ac-
tion  to  which  the  SER  refers.  If  an  inspection  under  proposed  para-
graph  1412(f)  reveals  a  deficiency,  a  qualified  person  must  deter-
mine  whether  that  deficiency  is  a  safety  hazard  requiring  immediate 
correction.  If  the  inspection  reveals  that  original  equipment,  such  as 
stairs and ladders, have been replaced with something equally safe, 
there  would  be  no  safety  hazard  and  no  requirement  for  corrective 
action. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1412(f) and requests public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1412(e) and requests public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1416(d) and solicits public comment on the issue. 

In the discussion of proposed § 1423, OSHA explains the Committee’s 

rationale underlying the proposed section. 

OSHA  addresses  these  recommendations  in  the  discussion  of  pro-
posed  § 1427  and  requests  public  comment  on  the  issues  raised  by 
the Panel. 

The  issue  is  discussed  in  the  explanation  of  the  proposed  rule  for 

§ 1926.1427(h).

TABLE B–17—RESPONSES TO SBREFA PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS (ALSO FOUND IN TABLE 4 OF THE PREAMBLE)— 

Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The  Panel  recommends  soliciting  public  comment  on  whether  the 
phrase  ‘‘equipment  capacity  and  type’’  in  proposed  paragraph 
1427(b)(1)(ii)(B)  needs  clarification,  suggestions  on  how  to  accom-
plish  this,  and  whether  the  categories  represented  in  Figures  1 
through  10  contained  in  ANSI  B30.5–2000)  (i.e.,  commercial  truck- 
mounted  crane—telescoping  boom;  commercial 
truck-mounted 
crane—non-telescoping  boom;  crawler  crane;  crawler  crane—tele-
scoping  boom;  locomotive  crane;  wheel  mounted  crane  (multiple 
control  station);  wheel  mounted  crane—telescoping  boom  (multiple 
control  station);  wheel  mounted  crane  (single  control  station);  wheel 
mounted crane—telescoping boom (single control station)) should be 
used.

The Panel recommends that OSHA ask for public comment on whether 
the  rule  needs  to  state  more  clearly  that  paragraph  1427(j)(1)(i)  re-
quires  more  limited  training  for  operators  of  smaller  capacity  equip-
ment used in less complex operations as compared with operators of 
higher capacity, more complex equipment used in more complex sit-
uations.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  ask  for  public  com-
ment  on  whether  a  more  limited  training  program  would  be  appro-
priate  for  operations  based  on  the  capacity  and  type  of  equipment 
and nature of operations.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  ask  for  public  com-
ment  as  to  whether  the  supervisor  responsible  for  oversight  for  an 
operator  in  the  pre-qualification  period  (1427(f))  should  have  addi-
tional training beyond that required in the C–DAC document at para-
graph 1427(f)(2)(iii)(B).

The  Panel  recommends  OSHA  solicit  comment  on  whether  there  are 
qualified  persons  in  the  field  with  the  necessary  expertise  to  assess 
how  the  rated  capacity  for  land  cranes  and  derricks  used  on  barges 
and other flotation devices needs to be modified as required by pro-
posed paragraph 1437(n)(2).

The Panel also recommends that OSHA solicit comment on whether it 
is  necessary,  from  a  safety  standpoint,  to  apply  this  provision  to 
cranes used only for duty cycle work, and if so, why that is the case, 
and how ‘‘duty cycle work’’ should be defined.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  ask  for  comment  on 
whether  it  would  be  appropriate  to  exempt  from  the  rule  small  side 
boom cranes incapable of lifting above the height of a truck bed and 
with a capacity of not more than 6,000 pounds.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  solicit  public  comment  on  how  the 
proposed  rule  could  be  simplified  (without  creating  ambiguities)  and 
made easier to understand. (Several SERs believed that the C–DAC 
document  was  so  long  and  complex  that  small  businesses  would 
have difficulty understanding it and complying with it.) 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  outlining  the  inspection 
requirements  in  spreadsheet  form  in  an  Appendix  or  developing 
some  other  means  to  help  employers  understand  what  inspections 
are needed and when they must be done.

The Panel recommends that OSHA consider whether use of the words 
‘‘determine’’  and  ‘‘demonstrate’’  would  mandate  that  the  employer 
keep  records  of  such  determinations  and  if  records  would  be  re-
quired to make such demonstrations.

The Panel recommends soliciting public comment on whether the word 
‘‘days’’  as  used  in  sections  1416(d)  and  1416(e)  should  be  clarified 
to mean calendar days or business days.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  carefully  discuss  what  is  included 

and excluded from the scope of this standard.

The Panel recommends that OSHA gather data and analyze the effects 

of already existing certification requirements.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  excluding  and  soliciting 
comment on whether equipment used solely to deliver materials to a 
construction  site  by  placing/stacking  the  materials  on  the  ground 
should be explicitly excluded from the proposed standard’s scope.

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 
paragraph  1427(b)(1)(ii)(B)  and  requests  public  comment  on  the 
issue. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1430(c) and requests public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1430(c) and requests public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1430(c) and requests public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  addresses  these  recommendations  in  the  discussion  of  pro-
posed  paragraph  1437(n)(2)  and  requests  public  comment  on  the 
issues. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1440(a) and requests public comment on the issue. 

The length and comprehensiveness of the standard is an issue for this 
rulemaking.  OSHA  requests  comment  on  how  and  whether  the  pro-
posal  can  be  shortened  or  simplified—made  easier  to  understand— 
and the effect of that on addressing construction hazards. 

OSHA  will  consider  developing  such  an  aid  as  a  separate  guidance 

document. 

Some  SERs  requested  clarification  as  to  when  documentation  was  re-
quired, believing that the document implicitly requires documentation 
when it states that the employer must ‘‘determine’’ or ‘‘demonstrate’’ 
certain things. OSHA notes that it cannot cite an employer for failing 
to  have  documentation  not  explicitly  called  for  in  a  standard.  See 
also the discussion under proposed paragraph 1402(e). 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1416(d) and requests public comment on the issue. 

OSHA  discusses  in  detail  the  types  of  machinery  that  are  included 
under this proposed standard and those that are excluded in the ex-
planation of § 1400. 

OSHA has obtained and evaluated a study by the Construction Safety 
Association  of  Ontario  showing  that  Ontario’s  certification  require-
ment  has  led  to  a  substantial  decrease  in  crane-related  fatalities 
there. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1400(c) and requests public comment on the issue.

Continued 

SBREFA panel recommendation 

OSHA response 

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  should  consider  the  information 
and range of opinions that were presented by the SERs on the issue 
of  operator  qualification/certification  when  analyzing  the  public  com-
ments on this issue.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment on expanding the levels of certification so as to allow an oper-
ator to be certified on a specific brand’s model of crane.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment  on  expanding  the  levels  of  operator  qualification/certification  to 
allow  an  operator  to  be  certified  for  a  specific,  limited  type  of  cir-
cumstance.  Such  a  circumstance  would  be  defined  by  a  set  of  pa-
rameters that, taken together, would describe an operation character-
ized by simplicity and relatively low risk. The Agency should consider 
and solicit comment on whether such parameters could be identified 
in a way that would result in a clear, easily understood provision that 
could be effectively enforced.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  consider  and  solicit  public  com-
ment  on  allowing  the  written  and  practical  tests  described  in  Option 
(1) to be administered by an accredited educational institution.

The Panel recommends that OSHA solicit public comment on making it 
clear  that:  (1)  An  employer  is  permitted  to  equip  its  cranes  with 
manuals  re-written  in  a  way  that  would  allow  an  operator  with  a  low 
literacy  level  to  understand  the  material  (such  as  substituting  some 
text with pictures and illustrations), and (2) making it clear that, when 
the cranes are equipped with such re-written manuals and materials, 
the ‘‘manuals’’ and ‘‘materials’’ referred to in these literacy provisions 
would be the re-written manuals.

The  Panel  recommends  that  OSHA  explain  in  a  Small  Business  Com-
pliance Guide that the certification/qualification test does not need to 
be  administered  in  English  but  can  be  administered  in  a  language 
that the candidate can read; and that while the employee would also 
need to have a sufficient level of literacy to read and understand the 
relevant  information  in  the  equipment  manual,  that  requirement 
would be satisfied if the material is written in a language that the em-
ployee can read and understand.

The  information  and  opinions  submitted  by  the  SERs  are  part  of  the 
record  for  this  rulemaking,  and  OSHA  will  consider  them  along  with 
the other public comments on the proposed rule. 

OSHA  addresses  this  recommendation  in  the  discussion  of  proposed 

paragraph 1427(j)(1) and requests public comment on the issue.

is issued and will explain these points in the Guide.

C. OMB Review Under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 

The proposed Cranes and Derricks in 

Construction Standard contains 
collection-of-information (paperwork) 

requirements that are subject to review 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget (‘‘OMB’’) under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (‘‘PRA–95’’), 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and OMB’s 
regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. The 
Paperwork Reduction Act defines 
‘‘collection of information’’ as ‘‘the 
obtaining, causing to be obtained, 
soliciting, or requiring the disclosure to 
third parties or the public of facts or 
opinions by or for an agency regardless 
of form or format. * * * ’’ (44 U.S.C. 
3502(3)(A).) OSHA submitted the 
collection-of-information requirements 
identified in this NPRM to OMB for 
review (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). OSHA 
solicits comments on the collection-of- 
information requirements and the 
estimated burden hours associated with 
these collections, including comments 
on the following: 

• Whether the proposed collection-of- 
information requirements are necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
Agency’s functions, including whether 
the information is useful; 

• The accuracy of OSHA’s estimate of 

the burden (time and cost) of the 

information-collection requirements, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; 
• The quality, utility, and clarity of 
• Ways to minimize the burden on 

the information collected; and 

employers who must comply, for 
example, by using automated or other 
technological techniques for collecting 
and transmitting information. 

The title, description of the need for 

and proposed use of the information, 
description of the respondents, and 
frequency of response of the information 
collections are described below, along 
with an estimate of the annual reporting 
burden and cost as required by 5 CFR 
1320.5(a)(1)(iv) and 1320.8(d)(2). 

Title: Cranes and Derricks in 

Construction (29 CFR part 1926 subpart 
CC). 

Description and Proposed Use of the 

Collections of Information: The 
proposed standard would impose new 
information-collection requirements for 
purposes of PRA–95. The collection-of- 
information requirements in the 
proposed standard have not been 
approved by OMB. These provisions are 
needed to protect the health and safety

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

of employees who work with equipment 
at construction worksites. 

The paperwork requirements would 
impose a duty to produce and maintain 
records on employers who implement 
controls and take other measures to 
protect employees from hazards related 
to cranes and derricks used in 
construction. Accordingly, each 
construction business that has 
employees who operate or are in the 

vicinity of cranes and derricks would be 
required to have, as applicable, the 
following documents on file and 
available at the job site: Equipment 
ratings, employee training records, 
written authorizations from qualified 
individuals, and qualification program 
audits. During an inspection, OSHA 
would have access to the records to 
determine compliance under conditions 
specified by the proposed standard. An 

employer’s failure to generate and 
disclose the information required in this 
standard will affect significantly the 
Agency’s effort to control and reduce 
injuries and fatalities related to the use 
of cranes and derricks in construction. 

Table C–1 below identifies and 

describes the new collections of 
information contained in the proposed 
standard.

59913 

of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, 
NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone 
(202) 693–2222. 
D. Federalism 

The Agency reviewed the proposed 

rule according to the most recent 
Executive Order (‘‘E.O.’’) on Federalism 
(E.O. 13132, 64 FR 43225). This E.O. 
requires that Federal agencies, to the 
extent possible, refrain from limiting 
State policy options, consult with States 
before taking actions that restrict their 
policy options, and take such actions 
only when clear constitutional authority 
exists and the problem is national in 
scope. The E.O. allows Federal agencies 
to preempt State law only with the 
expressed consent of Congress. In such 
cases, Federal agencies must limit 
preemption of State law to the extent 
possible. 

Section 18 of the Occupational Safety 

and Health Act of 1970 (‘‘the Act’’; 29 
U.S.C. 667) expressly provides OSHA 
with authority to preempt State 
occupational safety and health 
standards to the extent that the Agency 
promulgates a Federal standard under 
Section 6 of the Act. Accordingly, 
Section 18 of the Act authorizes the 
Agency to preempt State promulgation 
and enforcement of requirements 
dealing with occupational safety and 
health issues covered by OSHA 
standards unless the State has an 
OSHA-approved occupational safety 
and health plan (namely, is a State-Plan 
State). (See Gade v. National Solid 
Wastes Management Association, 112 S. 
Ct. 2374 (1992).) 

With respect to States that do not 

have OSHA-approved plans, the Agency 
concludes that this proposed rule would 
conform to the preemption provisions of 
the Act. Additionally, Section 18 of the 
Act prohibits States without approved 
plans from issuing citations for 
violations of OSHA standards; the 
Agency finds that the proposed 
rulemaking would not expand this 
limitation. Therefore, for States that do 
not have approved occupational safety 
and health plans, this proposed rule 
would not affect the preemption 
provisions of Section 18 of the Act. 

OSHA has authority under E.O. 13132 

to promulgate the proposed rule in 29 
CFR part 1926 because the employee 
exposures related to cranes and derricks 
used in construction addressed by the 
proposed requirements are national in 
scope. The Agency concludes that the 
requirements in this proposed rule 
would provide employers in every State 
with critical information to use when 
protecting their employees from the 
hazards presented when working with 
cranes and derricks. However, while

OSHA drafted the proposed 
requirements to protect employees in 
every State, Section 18(c)(2) of the Act 
permits State-Plan States and Territories 
to develop and enforce their own 
standards for cranes and derricks used 
in construction provided these 
requirements are at least as effective in 
providing safe and healthful 
employment and places of employment 
as the final requirements that result 
from this proposal. 

In summary, this proposed rule 

complies with E.O. 13132. In States 
without OSHA-approved State Plans, 
Congress expressly provides for OSHA 
standards to preempt State job safety 
and health rules in areas addressed by 
the Federal standards; in these States, 
this rule limits State policy options in 
the same manner as every standard 
promulgated by the Agency. In States 
with OSHA-approved State Plans, this 
rulemaking does not significantly limit 
State policy options. 
E. State-Plan States 

Section 18(c)(2) of the Occupational 

Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 
667(c)(2)) requires State-Plan States to 
adopt mandatory standards promulgated 
by OSHA. Accordingly, the 24 States 
and two Territories with their own 
OSHA-approved occupational safety 
and health plans would have to adopt 
provisions comparable to the provisions 
in this proposed rule within six months 
after the Agency publishes the final rule 
that it develops from this proposal. The 
Agency believes that the proposed rule 
would provide employers in State-Plan 
States and Territories with critical 
information and methods necessary to 
protect their employees when working 
with cranes and derricks in 
construction. The 24 States and two 
Territories with State Plans are: Alaska, 
Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, 
Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. 
Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and 
the Virgin Islands have OSHA-approved 
State Plans that apply to State and local 
government employees only. Until a 
State-Plan State/Territory promulgates 
its own comparable provisions based on 
the final rule developed from this 
proposal, Federal OSHA will provide 
the State/Territory with interim 
enforcement assistance, as appropriate. 
F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 

OSHA reviewed this proposed rule 
according to the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (‘‘UMRA’’; 2 U.S.C. 
1501 et seq.) and Executive Order 12875 

(58 FR 58093). As discussed above in 
section V.B. of this preamble 
(‘‘Preliminary Economic Analysis and 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis’’), 
the Agency estimates that compliance 
with this proposed rule would require 
private-sector employers to expend 
about $123 million each year. However, 
while this proposed rule establishes a 
federal mandate in the private sector, it 
is not a significant regulatory action 
within the meaning of Section 202 of 
the UMRA (2 U.S.C. 1532). 

Under voluntary agreement with 

OSHA, some States enforce compliance 
with their State standards on public 
sector entities, and these agreements 
specify that these State standards must 
be equivalent to OSHA standards. Thus, 
although OSHA has included 
compliance costs for the affected public 
sector entities in its analysis of the 
expected impacts associated with the 
proposal, the proposal would not 
involve any unfunded mandates being 
imposed on any State or local 
government entity. Consequently, this 
proposed rule does not meet the 
definition of a ‘‘Federal 
intergovernmental mandate’’ (see Sec. 
421(5) of the UMRA (2 U.S.C. 658(5))). 
Therefore, for the purposes of the 
UMRA, the Agency preliminarily 
certifies that this proposed rule does not 
mandate that State, local, and tribal 
governments adopt new, unfunded 
regulatory obligations, nor does the 
proposed rule increase the expenditures 
by the private sector of more than $100 
million a year. 
G. Applicability of Existing Consensus 
Standards 

Some of the types of equipment 

subject to this proposed standard are 
addressed by current national consensus 
standards in the ASME B30 series, 
including: ASME B30.5–2004, ‘‘Mobile 
and Locomotive Cranes’’; ASME B30.6– 
2003, ‘‘Derricks’’; ASME B30.8–2004, 
‘‘Floating Cranes and Floating 
Derricks’’; ASME B30.3–2004, 
‘‘Construction Tower Cranes’’; ASME 
B30.14–2004, ‘‘Side Boom Tractors’’; 
and ASME B30.2–2001, ‘‘Overhead and 
Gantry Cranes.’’ In addition, ASME 
B30.7–2005, ‘‘Base-Mounted Drum 
Hoists,’’ addresses a type of equipment 
that is often a component of derricks, 
and ASME B30.23–2005, ‘‘Personnel 
Lifting Systems,’’ addresses issues that 
are covered by proposed § 1926.1431, 
Hoisting personnel. 

The Committee consulted these 

ASME standards (or the most current 
versions available at the time) and other 
resources in developing its proposal. In 
most instances, the ASME standards 
that the Committee consulted were

entered into the docket, including: 
ASME B30.5–2000 (OSHA–S030–2006– 
0663–0334); ASME B30.5a–2002 
Addenda (OSHA–S030–2006–0663–

versions of the ASME standards were 
issued after the Committee finished its 
work, OSHA has examined the updated 
standards to determine if their 
provisions deviate in a significant way 
from provisions on which C–DAC 
relied. Those updated standards have 
been entered into the record of this 
rulemaking. For the most part, OSHA 
did not find significant deviations 
between the updated versions and the 
versions before the Committee. In the 
few instances where deviations 
occurred, OSHA has identified those 
deviations and asked for public 
comment on any issues they raise. 

As discussed in detail in the 

Summary and Explanation of the 
proposed standard, a number of 
provisions in this proposal contain 
concepts that are similar to those in 
provisions in the various ASME 
standards. However, the Committee 
determined in most instances that, for 
reasons of enforceability, clarity or ease 
of use, the wording of those concepts 
needed to be modified. 

For some issues, the ASME standards 

do not address issues covered by this 
proposal, or the Committee determined 
that a different approach is needed. For 
example, in the provisions on 
inspections (§§ 1926.1412 and 
1926.1413), C–DAC concluded that 
shift, monthly and annual inspection 
intervals are most appropriate, in 
contrast to the ASME approach, which 
uses ‘‘frequent’’ and ‘‘periodic’’ 
intervals. In the provisions addressing 
assembly/disassembly (§§ 1926.1403 
through 1926.1406) and the 
encroachment prevention provisions for 
power lines (§ 1926.1407 through 
1926.1411), C–DAC adopted approaches 
with no comparable counterparts in the 
ASME standards. 

In some instances, C–DAC determined 

that it was appropriate to incorporate 
ASME standards by reference, in whole 
or in part. For example, in proposed 
§ 1926.1433, Design, construction and 
testing, the proposed rule incorporates 
by reference ANSI B30.5–1968, safety 
code for ‘‘Crawler, Locomotive, and 
Truck Cranes,’’ ‘‘PCSA Standard No. 2,’’ 
for crawler, truck and locomotive cranes 
manufactured prior to [EFFECTIVE 
DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], and 
incorporates portions of ASME B30.5a- 

2004, ‘‘Mobile and Locomotive Cranes,’’ 
for mobile (including crawler and truck) 
and locomotive cranes manufactured on 
or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 
FINAL RULE]. 
H. Review of the Proposed Standard by 
the Advisory Committee for 
Construction Safety and Health 

The proposed subpart would add 

requirements to the existing standards 
in 29 CFR part 1926 that protect 
employees from hazards associated with 
the use of cranes and derricks in 
construction. OSHA’s regulation 
governing the Advisory Committee on 
Construction Safety and Health 
(ACCSH) at 29 CFR 1912.3 requires 
OSHA to consult with ACCSH 
whenever the Agency proposes a rule 
that involves the occupational safety 
and health of construction employees. 
OSHA distributed the C–DAC 
Consensus Document to the ACCSH 
members one month prior to their 
scheduled October 11, 2006 meeting. At 
the meeting, OSHA took questions from 
the ACCSH members regarding the 
C–DAC Consensus Document. On 
October 12, 2006, the OSHA staff 
provided answers to these questions to 
the ACCSH members. ACCSH discussed 
the issues related to the C–DAC 
Consensus Document and then adopted 
a resolution supporting it and 
recommending that OSHA use it as the 
basis for a proposed standard. (ACCSH 
2006–1, Ex. 101x, pp. 248–49). 
I. Public Participation—Comments and 
Hearings 

OSHA encourages members of the 

public to participate in this rulemaking 
by submitting comments on the 
proposal and documentary evidence. In 
this regard, the Agency invites

§ 1926.1401 Definitions. 

A/D supervisor (Assembly/ 

Disassembly supervisor) means an 
individual who meets this standard’s 
requirements for an A/D supervisor, 
irrespective of the person’s formal job 
title or whether the person is non- 
management or management personnel. 

Articulating crane means a crane 
whose boom consists of a series of 
folding, pin connected structural 
members, typically manipulated to 
extend or retract by power from 
hydraulic cylinders. 

Assembly/Disassembly means the 

assembly and/or disassembly of 
equipment covered under this standard. 
With regard to tower cranes, ‘‘erecting 
and climbing’’ replaces the term 

‘‘assembly,’’ and ‘‘dismantling’’ replaces 
the term ‘‘disassembly.’’ 

Assist crane means a crane used to 

assist in assembling or disassembling a 
crane. Attachments means any device 
that expands the range of tasks that can 
be done by the equipment. Examples 
include, but are not limited to: An 
auger, drill, magnet, pile-driver, and 
boom-attached personnel platform. 

Audible signal means a signal made 
by a distinct sound or series of sounds. 
Examples include, but are not limited 
to, sounds made by a bell, horn, or 
whistle. 

Blocking (also referred to as 

‘‘cribbing’’) is wood or other material 
used to support equipment or a 
component and distribute loads to the 
ground. It is typically used to support 
latticed boom sections during assembly/ 
disassembly and under outrigger floats. 

Boatswain’s chair means a single- 
point adjustable suspension scaffold 
consisting of a seat or sling (which may 
be incorporated into a full body harness) 
designed to support one employee in a 
sitting position. 

Bogie means ‘‘travel bogie,’’ which is 

defined below. 

Boom (equipment other than tower 

crane) means an inclined spar, strut, or 
other long structural member which 
supports the upper hoisting tackle on a 
crane or derrick. Typically, the length 
and vertical angle of the boom can be 
varied to achieve increased height or 
height and reach when lifting loads. 
Booms can usually be grouped into 
general categories of hydraulically 
extendible, cantilevered type, latticed 
section, cable supported type or 
articulating type. 

Boom (tower cranes): On tower 

cranes, if the ‘‘boom’’ (i.e., principal 
horizontal structure) is fixed, it is 
referred to as a jib; if it is moveable up 
and down, it is referred to as a boom. 

Boom angle indicator means a device 
which measures the angle of the boom 
relative to horizontal. 

Boom hoist limiting device includes 
boom hoist disengaging device, boom 
hoist shut-off, boom hoist disconnect, 
boom hoist hydraulic relief, boom hoist 
kick-outs, automatic boom stop device, 
or derricking limiter. This type of device 
disengages boom hoist power when the 
boom reaches a predetermined 
operating angle. It also sets brakes or 
closes valves to prevent the boom from 
lowering after power is disengaged. 

Boom length indicator indicates the 

length of the permanent part of the 
boom (such as ruled markings on the 
boom) or, as in some computerized 
systems, the length of the boom with 
extensions/attachments.

Boom stop includes boom stops, 
(belly straps with struts/standoff), 
telescoping boom stops, attachment 
boom stops, and backstops. These 
devices restrict the boom from moving 
above a certain maximum angle and 
toppling over backward. 

Boom suspension system means a 
system of pendants, running ropes, 
sheaves, and other hardware which 
supports the boom tip and controls the 
boom angle. 

Builder means an employer builder/ 

constructor of equipment. 

Calculate includes use of a calculator. 
Center of gravity: The center of gravity 

of any object is the point in the object 
around which its weight is evenly 
distributed. If you could put a support 
under that point, you could balance the 
object on the support. 

Certified welder means a welder who 

meets nationally recognized 
certification requirements applicable to 
the task being performed. 

Climbing means the process in which 
a tower crane is raised to a new working

Come-a-long means a mechanical 

device typically consisting of a chain or 
cable attached at each end that is used 
to facilitate movement of materials 
through leverage. 

Competent person means one who is 

capable of identifying existing and 
predictable hazards in the surroundings 
or working conditions which are 
unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to 
employees, and who has authorization 
to take prompt corrective measures to

Controlled load lowering means 

lowering a load by means of a 
mechanical hoist drum device that 
allows a hoisted load to be lowered with

Free surface effect is the uncontrolled 

transverse movement of liquids in 
compartments which reduce a vessel’s 
transverse stability. 

Hoist means a mechanical device for 
lifting and lowering loads by winding 
rope onto or off a drum.

pontoons, vessel or other means of 
floatation. 

Load refers to the object(s) being 

hoisted and/or the weight of the 
object(s); both uses refer to the object(s) 
and the load-attaching equipment, such 
as, the load block, ropes, slings, 
shackles, and any other ancillary 
attachment. 

Load moment (or rated capacity) 

indicator means a system which aids the 
equipment operator by sensing the 
overturning moment on the equipment, 
i.e., load multiplied by radius. It 
compares this lifting condition to the

of capacity at which the equipment is 
working. Lights, bells, or buzzers may 
be incorporated as a warning of an 
approaching overload condition. 

Load moment (or rated capacity) 

limiter means a system which aids the 
equipment operator by sensing the 
overturning moment on the equipment, 
i.e., load multiplied by radius. It 
compares this lifting condition to the 
equipment’s rated capacity, and when 
the rated capacity is reached, it shuts off 
power to those equipment functions 
which can increase the severity of 
loading on the equipment, e.g., hoisting, 
telescoping out, or luffing out. 
Typically, those functions which 
decrease the severity of loading on the 
equipment remain operational, e.g., 
lowering, telescoping in, or luffing in. 

Locomotive crane means a crane 

mounted on a base or car equipped for 
travel on a railroad track.

the process of going to or from a work 
station. 

Multi-purpose machine means a 

machine that is designed to be 
configured in various ways, at least one 

of which allows it to hoist (by means of 
a winch or hook) and horizontally move 
a suspended load. For example, a 
machine that can rotate and can be 
configured with removable tongs (for 
use as a forklift) or with a winch pack, 
jib (with a hook at the end) or jib used 
in conjunction with a winch. When 
configured with the tongs, it is not 
covered by this subpart. When 
configured with a winch pack, jib (with 
a hook at the end) or jib used in 
conjunction with a winch, it is covered 
by this subpart. 

Nationally recognized accrediting 

agency is an organization that, due to its 
independence and expertise, is widely 
recognized as competent to accredit 
testing organizations. 

Non-conductive means that, because 

of the nature and condition of the 
materials used, and the conditions of 
use (including environmental 
conditions and condition of the 
material), the object in question has the 
property of not becoming energized 
(that is, it has high dielectric properties 
offering a high resistance to the passage 
of current under the conditions of use). 

Operational aids are devices that 

assist the operator in the safe operation 
of the crane by providing information or 
automatically taking control of a crane 
function. These include, but are not 
limited to, the devices listed in 
§ 1926.1416 (‘‘listed operational aids’’).

bridge cranes, launching gantry cranes, 
and similar equipment, irrespective of 
whether it travels on tracks, wheels, or 
other means. 

Paragraph refers to a paragraph in the 

same section of this subpart that the 
word ‘‘paragraph’’ is used, unless 
otherwise specified. 

Pendants includes both wire and bar 
types. Wire type: A fixed length of wire 
rope with mechanical fittings at both 
ends for pinning segments of wire rope 
together. Bar type: Instead of wire rope, 
a bar is used. Pendants are typically 
used in a latticed boom crane system to 
easily change the length of the boom 
suspension system without completely 
changing the rope on the drum when 
the boom length is increased or 
decreased. 

Personal fall arrest system means a 

system used to arrest an employee in a 
fall from a working level. It consists of 
an anchorage, connectors, a body 
harness and may include a lanyard,

responsible for monitoring and 
communicating with a diver. 

Tilt up or tilt down operation means 

raising/lowering a load from the 
horizontal to vertical or vertical to 
horizontal. 

Tower crane is a type of lifting 

structure which utilizes a vertical mast 
or tower to support a working boom (jib) 
in an elevated position. Loads are 
suspended from the working boom. 
While the working boom may be of the 
fixed type (horizontal or angled) or have 
luffing capability, it can always rotate to 
swing loads, either by rotating on the 
top of the tower (top slewing) or by the 
rotation of the tower (bottom slewing). 
The tower base may be fixed in one 
location or ballasted and moveable 
between locations. 

Travel bogie (tower cranes) is an

§ 1926.1403 Assembly/Disassembly— 
selection of manufacturer or employer 
procedures. 

When assembling and disassembling 

equipment (or attachments), the 
employer shall comply with either: 

(a) Manufacturer procedures 

applicable to assembly and disassembly, 
or 

(b) Employer procedures for assembly 
and disassembly. Employer procedures 
may be used only where the employer 
can demonstrate that the procedures 
used meet the requirements in 
§ 1926.1406. 

§ 1926.1404 Assembly/Disassembly— 
general requirements (applies to all 
assembly and disassembly operations). 

(a) Supervision—competent-qualified 

person. 

(1) Assembly/disassembly must be 

supervised by a person who meets the 
criteria for both a competent person and 
a qualified person, or by a competent 
person who is assisted by one or more 
qualified persons (‘‘A/D supervisor’’). 
(2) Where the assembly/disassembly 
is being performed by only one person, 
that person must meet the criteria for 
both a competent person and a qualified 
person. For purposes of this subpart, 
that person is considered the A/D 
supervisor. 

(b) Knowledge of procedures. The 
A/D supervisor must understand the 
applicable assembly/disassembly 
procedures. 

(c) Review of procedures. The A/D 

supervisor must review the applicable 
assembly/disassembly procedures

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  197 / Thursday,  October  9,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

on a different task, or when adding new 
personnel during the operations, the 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) 
through (d)(1)(iii) of this section must be 
met with respect to the crew member’s 
understanding regarding that task. 

(e) Protecting assembly/disassembly 

crew members out of operator view. 
(1) Before a crew member goes to a 

location that is out of view of the 
operator and is either: in, on, or under 
the equipment, or near the equipment 
(or load) where the crew member could 
be injured by movement of the 
equipment (or load), the crew member 
shall inform the operator that he/she is 
going to that location. 

(2) Where the operator knows that a 

crew member went to a location covered 
by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the 
operator shall not move any part of the 
equipment (or load) until the operator: 
(i) Gives a warning that is understood 
by the crew member as a signal that the 
equipment (or load) is about to be 
moved and allows time for the crew 
member to get to a safe position, or 

(ii) Is informed in accordance with a 
pre-arranged system of communication 
that the crew member is in a safe 
position. 

(f) Working under the boom, jib or 

other components. 

(1) When pins (or similar devices) are 
being removed, employees must not be 
under the boom, jib, or other 
components, except where the 
requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section are met. 

(2) Exception. Where the employer 

demonstrates that site constraints 
require one or more employees to be 
under the boom, jib, or other 
components when pins (or similar 
devices) are being removed, the A/D 
supervisor must implement procedures 
that minimize the risk of unintended 
dangerous movement and minimize the 
duration and extent of exposure under 
the boom. (See Non-mandatory 

Appendix D of this subpart for an 
example.) 

(g) Capacity limits. During all phases 
of assembly/disassembly, rated capacity 
limits for loads imposed on the 
equipment, equipment components 
(including rigging), lifting lugs and 
equipment accessories shall not be 
exceeded for the equipment being 
assembled/disassembled. 

(h) Addressing specific hazards. The 

A/D supervisor supervising the 
assembly/disassembly operation must 
address the hazards associated with the 
operation with methods to protect the 
employees from them, as follows: 

(1) Site and ground bearing 

conditions. Site and ground conditions 
must be adequate for safe assembly/ 
disassembly operations and to support 
the equipment during assembly/ 
disassembly (see § 1926.1402 for ground 
condition requirements). 

(2) Blocking material. The size, 
amount, condition and method of 
stacking blocking must be sufficient to 
sustain the loads and maintain stability. 
(3) Proper location of blocking. When 

used to support lattice booms or 
components, blocking must be 
appropriately placed to: 

(i) Protect the structural integrity of 

the equipment, and 

(ii) Prevent dangerous movement and 

collapse. 

(4) Verifying assist crane loads. When 
using an assist crane, the loads that will 
be imposed on the assist crane at each 
phase of assembly/disassembly must be 
verified in accordance with 
§ 1926.1417(o)(3) before assembly/ 
disassembly begins in order to prevent 
exceeding rated capacity limits for the 
assist crane. 

(5) Boom and jib pick points. The 
point(s) of attachment of rigging to a 
boom (or boom sections or jib or jib 
sections) must be suitable for preventing 
structural damage and facilitating safe 
handling of these components. 

(6) Center of gravity. 
(i) The center of gravity of the load 
must be identified if that is necessary 
for the method used for maintaining 
stability. 

(ii) Where there is insufficient 

information to accurately identify the 
center of gravity, measures designed to 
prevent unintended dangerous 
movement resulting from an inaccurate 
identification of the center of gravity 
must be used. (See Non-mandatory 
Appendix D of this subpart for an 
example.) 

(7) Stability upon pin removal. The 

boom sections, boom suspension 
systems (such as gantry A-frames and jib 
struts), or components must be rigged or 
supported to maintain stability upon the 
removal of the pins. 

(8) Snagging. Suspension ropes and 
pendants must not be allowed to catch 
on the boom or jib connection pins or 
cotter pins (including keepers and 
locking pins). 

(9) Struck by counterweights. The 
potential for unexpected movement 
from inadequately supported 
counterweights and from hoisting 
counterweights. 

(10) Boom hoist brake failure. Where 

reliance is placed on the boom hoist 
brake to prevent boom movement 
during assembly/disassembly, the brake 
shall be tested to determine if it is 
sufficient to prevent boom movement. If 
it is not sufficient, a boom hoist pawl, 
other locking device/back-up braking 
device, or another method of preventing 
dangerous movement of the boom (such 
as blocking or using an assist crane) 
from a boom hoist brake failure shall be 
used. 

(11) Loss of backward stability. 

Backward stability must be considered 
before swinging the upperworks, travel, 
and when attaching or removing 
equipment components. See, for 
example, Figure 1.

(iii) Alternative measures for a 

Category II deficiency. The wire rope 
may continue to be used if the employer 
ensures that the following measures are 
implemented: 

(A) A qualified person assesses the 

deficiency in light of the load and other 
conditions of use and determines it is 
safe to continue to use the wire rope as 
long as the conditions established under 
this paragraph are met. 

(B) A qualified person establishes the 
parameters for the use of the equipment 
with the deficiency, including a reduced 
maximum rated capacity. 

(C) A qualified person establishes a 

specific number of broken wires, or 
diameter reduction that, when reached, 
will require the equipment to be taken 
out of service until the wire rope is 
replaced, or the damage is removed in 
accordance with all of the requirements 
and restrictions in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) 
of this section. 

(D) A qualified person sets a time 
limit, not to exceed 30 days from the 
date the deficiency is first identified, by 
which the wire rope must be replaced, 
or the damage removed in accordance 
with all of the requirements and 
restrictions in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of 
this section. 

(E) The workers who will conduct the 

shift inspections are informed of this 
deficiency and the measures taken 
under this paragraph. 

(F) The qualified person’s findings 

and procedures in paragraphs 
(a)(4)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section 
are documented. 

(iv) If a deficiency in Category III is 
identified, operations involving use of 
the wire rope in question shall be 
prohibited until: 

(A) The wire rope is replaced, or 
(B) If the deficiency (other than power 
line contact) is localized, the problem is 
corrected by severing the wire rope in 
two; the undamaged portion may 
continue to be used. Joining lengths of 
wire rope by splicing is prohibited. 
Repair of wire rope that contacted an 
energized power line is also prohibited. 

(v) Where a wire rope is required to 

be removed from service under this

shall be tagged-out, in accordance with 
§ 1926.1417(f)(1), until the wire rope is 
repaired or replaced. 

(b) Monthly inspection. 
(1) Each month an inspection shall be 

conducted in accordance with 
paragraph (a) (shift inspection) of this 
section. 

(2) Wire ropes on equipment shall not 

be used until an inspection under this 
paragraph demonstrates that no 
corrective action under paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section is required. 

(3) The inspection shall be 

documented according to 
§ 1926.1412(e)(3) (monthly inspection 
documentation). 

(c) Annual/comprehensive. 
(1) At least every 12 months, wire 
ropes in use on equipment shall be 
inspected by a qualified person in 
accordance with paragraph (a) (shift 
inspection) of this section.

working properly shall be repaired no 
later than 7 days after the deficiency 
occurs. Exception: If the employer 
documents that it has ordered the 
necessary parts within 7 days of the 
occurrence of the deficiency, the repair 
shall be completed within 7 days of 
receipt of the parts. 

(1) Boom hoist limiting device. 
(i) For equipment manufactured after 

December 16, 1969, a boom hoist 
limiting device is required. Temporary 
alternative measures (use at least one): 

(A) Use a boom angle indicator. 
(B) Clearly mark the boom hoist cable 

(so that it can easily be seen by the 
operator) at a point that will give the 
operator sufficient time to stop the hoist 
to keep the boom within the minimum 
allowable radius. In addition, install 
mirrors or remote video cameras and 
displays if necessary for the operator to 
see the mark. 

(C) Clearly mark the boom hoist cable 

(so that it can easily be seen by a 
spotter) at a point that will give the 
spotter sufficient time to signal the 
operator and have the operator stop the 
hoist to keep the boom within the 
minimum allowable radius. 
(ii) If the equipment was 

manufactured on or before December 16, 
1969, and was not originally equipped 
with a boom hoist limiting device, at 
least one of the measures in paragraphs 
(d)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section 
shall be used, on a permanent basis. 

(2) Luffing jib limiting device. 

Equipment with a luffing jib shall have 
a luffing jib limiting device. Temporary 
alternative measures are the same as in 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, except 
to limit the movement of the luffing jib. 

(3) Anti two-blocking device. 
(i) Telescopic boom cranes 

manufactured after February 28, 1992, 
shall be equipped with a device which 
automatically prevents damage from 
contact between the load block, 
overhaul ball, or similar component, 
and the boom tip (or fixed upper block 
or similar component). The device(s) 
must prevent such damage at all points 
where two-blocking could occur. 

Temporary alternative measures: 
Clearly mark the cable (so that it can 
easily be seen by the operator) at a point 
that will give the operator sufficient 
time to stop the hoist to prevent two- 
blocking, and use a spotter when 
extending the boom. 

(ii) Lattice boom cranes. 
(A) Lattice boom cranes manufactured 

after Feb 28, 1992, shall be equipped 
with a device that either automatically 
prevents damage and load failure from 
contact between the load block, 
overhaul ball, or similar component, 
and the boom tip (or fixed upper block 

or similar component), or warns the 
operator in time for the operator to 
prevent two-blocking. The device(s) 
must prevent such damage/failure or 
provide adequate warning for all points 
where two-blocking could occur. 

(B) Lattice boom cranes, and derricks, 

manufactured one year after the 
effective date of this standard shall be 
equipped with a device which 
automatically prevents damage and load 
failure from contact between the load 
block, overhaul ball, or similar 
component, and the boom tip (or fixed 
upper block or similar component). The 
device(s) must prevent such damage/ 
failure at all points where two-blocking 
could occur. 

(C) Exception. The requirements in 
paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this 
section do not apply to such lattice 
boom equipment when used for 
dragline, clamshell (grapple), magnet, 
drop ball, container handling, concrete 
bucket, marine operations that do not 
involve hoisting personnel, and pile 
driving work. 

(D) Temporary alternative measures. 

Clearly mark the cable (so that it can 
easily be seen by the operator) at a point 
that will give the operator sufficient 
time to stop the hoist to prevent two- 
blocking, or use a spotter. 

(e) Category II operational aids and 
alternative measures. Operational aids 
listed in this paragraph that are not 
working properly shall be repaired no 
later than 30 days after the deficiency 
occurs. Exception: If the employer 
documents that it has ordered the 
necessary parts within 7 days of the 
occurrence of the deficiency, and the 
part is not received in time to complete 
the repair in 30 days, the repair shall be 
completed within 7 days of receipt of 
the parts. 

(1) Boom angle or radius indicator. 

The equipment shall have a boom angle 
or radius indicator readable from the 
operator’s station. Temporary 
alternative measures: Radii or boom 
angle shall be determined by measuring 
the radii or boom angle with a 
measuring device. 

(2) Jib angle indicator if the 

equipment has a luffing jib. Temporary 
alternative measures: Radii or jib angle 
shall be determined by ascertaining the 
main boom angle and then measuring 
the radii or jib angle with a measuring 
device. 

(3) Boom length indicator if the 
equipment has a telescopic boom, 
except where the rated capacity is 
independent of the boom length. 
Temporary alternative measures: One of 
the following methods shall be used:

provided to the operator prior to the lift; 
or 

(ii) The operator shall begin hoisting 

the load to determine, using a load 
weighing device, load moment 
indicator, rated capacity indicator, or 
rated capacity limiter, if it exceeds 75 
percent of the maximum rated capacity 
at the longest radius that will be used 
during the lift operation. If it does, the 
operator shall not proceed with the lift

safety, the operator shall have the 
authority to stop and refuse to handle 
loads until a qualified person has 
determined that safety has been assured. 

§ 1926.1419 Signals—general 
requirements. 

(a) A signal person must be provided 

in each of the following situations: 

(1) The point of operation, meaning 

the load travel or the area near or at load 
placement, is not in full view of the 
operator. 

(2) When the equipment is traveling, 

the view in the direction of travel is 
obstructed. 

(3) Due to site specific safety 

concerns, either the operator or the 
person handling the load determines 
that it is necessary. 

(b) Types of signals. Signals to 
operators must be by hand, voice, 
audible, or new signals. 

(c) Hand signals. 
(1) When using hand signals, the 
Standard Method must be used (see 
Appendix A of this subpart). Exception: 
where use of the Standard Method for 
hand signals is infeasible, or where an 
operation or use of an attachment is not 
covered in the Standard Method, non- 
standard hand signals may be used in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section (see Appendix B of this subpart 
for an example). The following 
requirements apply to the use of non- 
standard hand signals: 

(2) Non-standard hand signals. When 

using non-standard hand signals, the 
signal person, operator, and lift 
supervisor (where there is one) shall 
contact each other prior to the operation 
and agree on the non-standard hand 
signals that will be used. 

(d) New signals. Signals other than 
hand, voice or audible signals may be 

used where the employer demonstrates 
that: 

(1) The new signals provide at least 

equally effective communication as 
voice, audible, or Standard Method 
hand signals, or 

(2) There is a national consensus 

standard for the new signals. 

(e) Suitability. The signals used (hand, 

voice, audible, or new), and means of 
transmitting the signals to the operator 
(such as direct line of sight, video, 
radio, etc.), must be appropriate for the 
site conditions. 

(f) During operations requiring 

signals, the ability to transmit signals 
between the operator and signal person 
shall be maintained. If that ability is 
interrupted at any time, the operator 
shall safely stop operations requiring 
signals until it is reestablished and a 
proper signal is given and understood. 
(g) If the operator becomes aware of a 

safety problem and needs to 
communicate with the signal person, 
the operator must safely stop operations. 
Operations shall not resume until the 
operator and signal person agree that the 
problem has been resolved. 

(h) Only one person gives signals to 

a crane/derrick at a time, except in 
circumstances covered by paragraph (j) 
of this section. 

(i) [Reserved.] 
(j) Anyone who becomes aware of a 
safety problem must alert the operator 
or signal person by giving the stop or 
emergency stop signal. (Note: 
§ 1926.1417(y) requires the operator to 
obey a stop or emergency stop signal). 

(k) All directions given to the operator 
by the signal person shall be given from 
the operator’s direction perspective. 

(l) [Reserved.] 
(m) Communication with multiple 

cranes/derricks. Where a signal 
person(s) is in communication with 
more than one crane/derrick, a system 
for identifying the crane/derrick each 
signal is for must be used, as follows: 

(1) For each signal, prior to giving the 

function/direction, the signal person 
shall identify the crane/derrick the 
signal is for, or 

(2) An equally effective method of 
identifying which crane/derrick the 
signal is for must be used. 

§ 1926.1420 Signals—radio, telephone or 
other electronic transmission of signals. 

(a) The device(s) used to transmit 
signals shall be tested on site before 
beginning operations to ensure that the 
signal transmission is clear and reliable. 

(b) Signal transmission must be 

through a dedicated channel. Exception: 
Multiple cranes/derricks and one or 
more signal persons may share a 
dedicated channel for the purpose of 
coordinating operations.

where employees will enter the 
platform, to each location at which the 
platform is to be hoisted and positioned. 
Where there is more than one location 
to be reached from a single set-up 
position, either individual trial lifts for 
each location, or a single trial lift for all 
locations, shall be performed. 

(2) The trial lift shall be performed 

immediately prior to each shift in which 
personnel will be hoisted. In addition, 
the trial lift shall be repeated prior to 
hoisting employees in each of the 
following circumstances: 

(i) The equipment is moved and set 
up in a new location or returned to a 
previously used location. 

(ii) The lift route is changed, unless 
the competent person determines that 
the new route presents no new factors 
affecting safety. 

(3) The competent person shall 

determine that:

documents that it has ordered the 
necessary parts within 7 days of the 
occurrence of the deficiency, the repair 
shall be completed within 7 days of 
receipt of the parts. 

(i) Trolley travel limiting device. The 
travel of the trolley shall be restricted at 
both ends of the jib by a trolley travel 
limiting device to prevent the trolley 
from running into the trolley end stops. 
Temporary alternative measures: 

(A) Option A. The trolley rope shall 

be marked (so it can be seen by the 
operator) at a point that will give the 
operator sufficient time to stop the 
trolley prior to the end stops. 

(B) Option B. A spotter shall be used 
when operations are conducted within 
10 feet of the outer or inner trolley end 
stops. 

(ii) Boom hoist limiting device. The 

range of the boom shall be limited at the 
minimum and maximum radius. 
Temporary alternative measures: 
Clearly mark the cable (so it can be seen 
by the operator) at a point that will give 
the operator sufficient time to stop the 
boom hoist within the minimum and 
maximum boom radius, or use a spotter. 

(iii) Anti two-blocking device. The 
tower crane shall be equipped with a 
device which automatically prevents 
damage from contact between the load 
block, overhaul ball, or similar 
component, and the boom tip (or fixed 
upper block or similar component). The 
device(s) must prevent such damage at 
all points where two-blocking could 
occur. Temporary alternative measures: 
Clearly mark the cable (so it can be seen 
by the operator) at a point that will give 
the operator sufficient time to stop the 
hoist to prevent two-blocking, or use a 
spotter. 

(iv) Hoist drum lower limiting device. 
Tower cranes manufactured more than 
one year after the effective date of this 
standard shall be equipped with a 
device that prevents the last 2 wraps of 
hoist cable from being spooled off the 
drum. Temporary alternative measures: 
Mark the cable (so it can be seen by the 
operator) at a point that will give the 
operator sufficient time to stop the hoist 
prior to last 2 wraps of hoist cable being 
spooled off the drum, or use a spotter. 

(v) Load moment limiting device. The 

tower crane shall have a device that 
prevents moment overloading. 
Temporary alternative measures: A 
radius indicating device shall be used (if 
the tower crane is not equipped with a 
radius indicating device, the radius 
shall be measured to ensure the load is 
within the rated capacity of the crane). 
In addition, the weight of the load shall 
be determined from a reliable source 
(such as the load’s manufacturer), by a 
reliable calculation method (such as

calculating a steel beam from measured 
dimensions and a known per foot 
weight), or by other equally reliable 
means. This information shall be 
provided to the operator prior to the lift. 

(vi) Hoist line pull limiting device. 

The capacity of the hoist shall be 
limited to prevent overloading, 
including each individual gear ratio if 
equipped with a multiple speed hoist 
transmission. Temporary alternative 
measures: The operator shall ensure that 
the weight of the load does not exceed 
the capacity of the hoist (including for 
each individual gear ratio if equipped 
with a multiple speed hoist 
transmission). 

(vii) Rail travel limiting device. The 

travel distance in each direction shall be 
limited to prevent the travel bogies from 
running into the end stops or buffers. 
Temporary alternative measures: A 
spotter shall be used when operations 
are conducted within 10 feet of either 
end of the travel rail end stops. 

(viii) Boom hoist drum positive 

locking device. The boom hoist drum 
shall be equipped with a device to 
positively lock the boom hoist drum. 
Temporary alternative measures: The 
device shall be manually set when 
required if an electric, hydraulic or 
automatic type is not functioning. 

(6) Category II operational aids and 
alternative measures. Operational aids 
listed in this paragraph that are not 
working properly shall be repaired no 
later than 30 days after the deficiency 
occurs. Exception: If the employer 
documents that it has ordered the 
necessary parts within 7 days of the 
occurrence of the deficiency, and the 
part is not received in time to complete 
the repair in 30 days, the repair shall be 
completed within 7 days of receipt of 
the parts. 

(i) Boom angle or hook radius 

indicator.  

(A) Luffing boom tower cranes shall 
have a boom angle indicator readable 
from the operator’s station. 

(B) Hammerhead tower cranes 

manufactured more than one year after 
the effective date of this subpart shall 
have a hook radius indicator readable 
from the operator’s station. 

(C) Temporary alternative measures: 

Hook radii or boom angle shall be 
determined by measuring the hook radii 
or boom angle with a measuring device. 
(ii) Trolley travel deceleration device. 
The trolley speed shall be automatically 
reduced prior to the trolley reaching the 
end limit in both directions. Temporary 
alternative measure: The operator shall 
reduce the trolley speed when 
approaching the trolley end limits. 

(iii) Boom hoist deceleration device. 
The boom speed shall be automatically 

reduced prior to the boom reaching the 
minimum or maximum radius limit. 
Temporary alternative measure: The 
operator shall reduce the boom speed 
when approaching the boom maximum 
or minimum end limits. 

(iv) Load hoist deceleration device. 
The load speed shall be automatically 
reduced prior to the hoist reaching the 
upper limit. Temporary alternative 
measure: The operator shall reduce the 
hoist speed when approaching the 
upper limit. 

(v) Wind speed indicator. A device 
shall be provided to display the wind 
speed and shall be mounted above the 
upper rotating structure on tower 
cranes. On self erecting cranes, it shall 
be mounted at or above the jib level. 
Temporary alternative measures: Use of 
wind speed information from a properly 
functioning indicating device on 
another tower crane on the same site, or 
a qualified person estimates the wind 
speed. 

(vi) Load indicating device. Cranes 

manufactured more than one year after 
the effective date of this standard, shall 
have a device that displays the 
magnitude of the load on the hook. 
Displays that are part of load moment 
limiting devices that display the load on 
the hook meet this requirement. 
Temporary alternative measures: The 
weight of the load shall be determined 
from a reliable source (such as the load’s 
manufacturer), by a reliable calculation 
method (such as calculating a steel 
beam from measured dimensions and a 
known per foot weight), or by other 
equally reliable means. This information 
shall be provided to the operator prior 
to the lift. 

(f) Inspections.  
(1) Section 1926.1412 (Inspections) 

applies to tower cranes, except that the 
term ‘‘assembly’’ is replaced by 
‘‘erection.’’ 

(2) Post-erection inspection. In 

addition to the requirements in 
§ 1926.1412(c), the following 
requirements shall be met: 

(i) A load test using certified weights, 
or scaled weights using a certified scale 
with a current certificate of calibration, 
shall be conducted after each erection. 
(ii) The load test shall be conducted 
in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Where these instructions 
are unavailable, a registered 
professional engineer familiar with the 
type of equipment involved shall 
develop written load test procedures. 

(3) Monthly. The following additional 

items shall be included:

(i) All deck surfaces of the barge, 
pontoons, vessel or other means of 
flotation used shall be above water. 
(ii) The entire bottom area of the 

barge, pontoons, vessel or other means 
of flotation used shall be submerged. 
(5) Physical attachment, corralling, 

rails system and centerline cable 
system. The employer shall meet the 
requirements in Option (1), Option (2), 
Option (3), or Option (4) (see paragraphs 
(n)(4)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section). Whichever option is used, the 
requirements of paragraph (v) must also 
be met. 

(i) Option (1)—Physical attachment. 
The crane/derrick shall be physically 
attached to the barge, pontoons, vessel 
or other means of flotation. Methods of 
physical attachment include crossed- 
cable systems attached to the crane/ 
derrick and vessel/flotation device (this 
type of system allows the crane/derrick 
to lift up slightly from the surface of the 
vessel/means of flotation), bolting or 
welding the crane/derrick to the vessel/ 
flotation device, strapping the crane/ 
derrick to the vessel/flotation device 
with chains, or other methods of 
physical attachment. 

(ii) Option (2)—Corralling. The crane/ 
derrick shall be prevented from shifting 
by installing barricade restraints (a 
corralling system). Corralling systems 
shall not allow any amount of shifting 
in any direction by the equipment. 
(iii) Option (3)—Rails. The crane/ 

derrick shall be prevented from shifting 
by being mounted on a rail system. Rail 
clamps and rail stops are required 
unless the system is designed to prevent 
movement during operation by other 
means. 

(iv) Option (4)—Centerline cable 
system. The crane/derrick shall be 
prevented from shifting by being 
mounted to a wire rope system. The 
wire rope system shall meet the 
following requirements: 

(A) The wire rope and attachments 
shall be of sufficient size/strength to 
support the side load of crane/derrick. 
(B) The wire rope shall be physically 
attached to the vessel/flotation device. 
(C) The wire rope shall be attached to 

the crane/derrick by appropriate 

attachment methods (such as shackles 
or sheaves) on the undercarriage which 
will allow the crew to secure the crane/ 
derrick from movement during 
operation and to move the crane/derrick 
longitudinally along the vessel/flotation 
device for repositioning. 

(D) Means shall be installed to 

prevent the crane/derrick from passing 
the forward or aft end of the wire rope 
attachments. 

(E) The crane/derrick shall be secured 

from movement during operation. 
(v) The systems/means used to 

comply with Option (1), Option (2), 
Option (3), or Option (4) (see paragraphs 
(n)(4)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section) shall be designed by a marine 
engineer, registered professional 
engineer familiar with floating crane/ 
derrick design, or qualified person 
familiar with floating crane/derrick 
design. 

(vi) Exception. For mobile auxiliary 

cranes used on the deck of a floating 
crane/derrick, the requirement to use 
Option (1), Option (2), Option (3), or 
Option (4) of this section does not apply 
where the employer demonstrates 
implementation of a plan and 
procedures that meet the following 
requirements: 

(A) A marine engineer or registered 

professional engineer familiar with 
floating crane/derrick design develops 
and signs a written plan for the use of 
the mobile auxiliary crane. 

(B) The plan shall be designed so that 

the applicable requirements of this 
section will be met despite the position, 
travel, operation, and lack of physical 
attachment (or corralling, use of rails or 
cable system) of the mobile auxiliary 
crane. 

(C) The plan shall specify the areas of 

the deck where the mobile auxiliary 
crane is permitted to be positioned, 
travel, and operate and the parameters/ 
limitations of such movements and 
operation. 

(D) The deck shall be marked to 

identify the permitted areas for 
positioning, travel, and operation. 

(E) The plan shall specify the 

dynamic/environmental conditions that 
must be present for use of the plan. 
(F) If the dynamic/environmental 

conditions in paragraph (n)(5)(vi)(E) of 
this section are exceeded, the mobile 
auxiliary crane shall be physically 
attached or corralled in accordance with 
Option (1), Option (2) or Option (4) (see 
paragraphs (n)(4)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this 
section). 

(6) The barge, pontoons, vessel or 
other means of flotation used shall: 

(i) Be structurally sufficient to 

withstand the static and dynamic loads 
of the crane/derrick when operating at 

the crane/derrick’s maximum rated 
capacity with all anticipated deck loads 
and ballasted compartments. 

(ii) Have a subdivided hull with one 

or more longitudinal watertight 
bulkheads for reducing the free surface 
effect. 

(iii) Have access to void 

compartments to allow for inspection 
and pumping.

Appendix B to Subpart CC of Part 
1926—Use of Non-Standard Signals 
The follow is an example of a situation 
where the use of the Standard Method for 
hand signals is infeasible: Due to background 
lighting conditions behind the signal person, 
there is insufficient contrast between the 
person’s hand and the sky color. This 
prevents the operator from being able to 
clearly see the signal person’s hand and 
fingers when extended out to either side. 
Appendix C to Subpart CC of Part 
1926—Checklist for Determining if 
Hoisting Personnel is Permissible 

A. HOISTING PERSONNEL IS 

PERMITTED: When the employer can show 
that the erection, use, and dismantling of 
conventional means of reaching the worksite, 
such as a personnel hoist, ladder, stairway, 
aerial lift, elevating work platform, or 
scaffold, would be more hazardous, or is not 
possible because of the project’s structural 
design or worksite conditions. See 
§ 1926.1431(a). However, the employer may 
hoist personnel without showing that the 
erection, use, and dismantling of 
conventional means of reaching the worksite 
would be more hazardous, or is not possible 
because of the project’s structural design or 
worksite conditions: 

(1) When engaged in work covered by 

subpart R (Steel Erection) of this part. See 
§ 1926.1431(a); 

(2) When using a personnel platform to 

hoist personnel for pile driving operations. 
See § 1926.1431(p)(3). 

B. HOISTING PERSONNEL IS ALWAYS 
PROHIBITED: Even if hoisting personnel is 
otherwise permitted, it is prohibited: 

(1) When any part of the equipment would 

get closer than 20 feet to a power line that 
is 350 kV or less or 50 feet to a power line 
over 350 kV, unless the employer is engaged 
in Subpart V work. See § 1926.1431(n); 

(2) When equipment is traveling unless the 

equipment travels on fixed rails or the 
employer can demonstrate that there is no 
less hazardous way to perform the work. See 
§ 1926.1431(k)(12). However, when the 
equipment is a derrick, it may not be used 
to hoist personnel while traveling under any 
circumstances. See § 1926.1431(k)(13); 
(3) When the equipment has a rated 

hoisting/lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds or 
less. See § 1926.1441(j). 

C. WHEN HOISTING PERSONNEL IS 

PERMITTED, A PERSONNEL PLATFORM 
MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF § 1431 
MUST BE USED, EXCEPT: 

(1) When hoisting personnel in drill shafts 
8 feet or less in diameter, the employer may 
instead use either a personnel platform or a 
boatswain’s chair. See § 1926.1431(o); 

(2) When hoisting personnel for pile 

driving operations the employer may instead 
use a boatswain’s chair. See § 1926.1431(p); 

(3) When hoisting personnel for marine 
transfer, the employer may instead use a 
marine hoisted personnel transfer device. See 
§ 1926.1431(r); 

(4) When hoisting personnel for storage 

tank, shaft, and chimney operations, the 
employer may instead use a boatswain’s 
chair, but only if use of a personnel platform 
is infeasible. See § 1926.1431(s). 
Appendix D to Subpart CC of Part 
1926—Assembly/Disassembly: Sample 
Procedures for Minimizing the Risk of 
Unintended Dangerous Boom 
Movement 

1. a. Section 1926.1404(f)(1) provides that 

when pins (or similar devices) are being 
removed, employees must not be under the 
boom, jib, or other components, except where 
the requirements of § 1926.1404(f)(2) are met. 
The exception in § 1926.1404(f)(2) applies 
when the employer demonstrates that site 
constraints require one or more employees to 
be under the boom, jib, or other components 
when pins (or similar devices) are being 
removed. In such a situation, the A/D 
supervisor must implement procedures that 
minimize the risk of unintended dangerous 
movement and minimize the duration and 
extent of exposure under the boom. 

b. The following scenario is an example of 
how the exception applies: A boom cannot be 
disassembled on the ground because of 
aboveground piping (as might be found, for 
example, in an oil refinery) that precludes 
lowering the boom to the ground. The boom 
must therefore be disassembled in the air, 
and the employees who remove the pins 
must perform that work from an aerial lift 
whose base is positioned on one side (the 
near side) of the boom. To gain access to the 
pins on the far side, the aerial lift basket must 
move under the boom, since, due to lack of 
room, the aerial lift cannot be repositioned 
on the far side. 

c. To minimize the risk of unintended 
dangerous movement while the pins are 
removed, the A/D supervisor uses an assist 
crane that is rigged to support the boom 
section that is being detached, using 
particular care to ensure that the section end 
that is near the employee(s) removing the 
pins is well supported. The duration and 
extent of exposure is minimized by removing 
the far side pins first, moving the aerial lift 
basket as soon as possible to the near side so 
that the employees are no longer under the 
boom, and then removing the near side pins. 

2. a. Section 1926.1404(h)(6)(i) provides 

that, during assembly/disassembly, the center 
of gravity of the load must be identified if 
that is necessary for the method used for 
maintaining stability. Section 
1926.1404(h)(6)(ii) states that, where there is 
insufficient information to accurately 
identify the center of gravity, measures 
designed to prevent unintended dangerous 
movement resulting from an inaccurate 
identification of the center of gravity must be 
used. 

b. An example of the application of 

§ 1926.1404(h)(6)(ii) is as follows. The boom 
is assembled by lowering boom sections

sequentially into place using an assist crane. 
The A/D supervisor’s plan is to keep the 
boom sections stable while they are lowered 
into place by attaching the assist crane hoist 
line above the center of gravity of each 
section. However, in assembling the non- 
symmetrical top section of the boom, the A/ 
D supervisor is not able to determine where 
to attach the assist crane hoist line so that it 
is above the center of gravity. In this 
situation, before raising the section, all 
personnel are kept clear of the section and 
the section is first raised a few inches to 
determine whether it tips when raised (if it 
did tip, it would indicate it is not rigged over 
the center of gravity). If this occurs, the hoist 
line is repositioned and the procedure 
repeated (with employees kept clear of the 
section while it is raised) until the A/D 
supervisor determines that it is rigged over 
the center of gravity and can be moved into 
place without dangerous movement.
