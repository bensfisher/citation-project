Investment Advice—Participants and 
Beneficiaries 
AGENCY: Employee Benefits Security 
Administration, DOL. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 

SUMMARY: This document contains 
proposed regulations implementing the 
provisions of the statutory exemption 
set forth in sections 408(b)(14) and 
408(g) of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act, as amended 
(ERISA or the Act), and parallel 
provisions in the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended (Code), relating to 
the provision of investment advice 
described in the Act by a fiduciary 
adviser to participants and beneficiaries 
in participant-directed individual 
account plans, such as 401(k) plans, and 
beneficiaries of individual retirement 
accounts (and certain similar plans). 
Section 408(b)(14) provides an 
exemption from certain prohibited 
transaction provisions in ERISA with 
respect to the provision of investment 
advice, the investment transaction 
entered into pursuant to the advice, and 
the direct or indirect receipt of fees or 
other compensation by the fiduciary 
adviser or an affiliate in connection 
with the provision of advice or the 
transaction pursuant to the advice. 
Section 408(g) describes the conditions 
under which the investment advice- 
related transactions are exempt. Upon 
adoption, the regulations will affect 
sponsors, fiduciaries, participants and 
beneficiaries of participant-directed 
individual account plans, as well as 
providers of investment and investment 
advice-related services to such plans. 
DATES: Written comments on the 
proposed regulations should be 
submitted to the Department of Labor on 
or before October 6, 2008. 
ADDRESSES: To facilitate the receipt and 
processing of comment letters, the 
Employee Benefits Security 
Administration (EBSA) encourages 
interested persons to submit their 
comments electronically by e-mail to e- 
ORI@dol.gov (Subject: Investment 
Advice Regulations), or by using the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Background 

Section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA includes 

within the definition of ‘‘fiduciary’’ a 
person that renders investment advice 
for a fee or other compensation, direct 
or indirect, with respect to any moneys 
or other property of a plan, or has any 
authority or responsibility to do so.1 
The prohibited transaction provisions of 
ERISA and the Code prohibit an 
investment advice fiduciary from using 
the authority, control or responsibility 
that makes it a fiduciary to cause itself, 
or a party in which it has an interest that 
may affect its best judgment as a 
fiduciary, to receive additional fees. As 
a result, in the absence of a statutory or 
administrative exemption, fiduciaries 
are prohibited from rendering 
investment advice to plan participants 
regarding investments that result in the 
payment of additional advisory and 
other fees to the fiduciaries or their 
affiliates. 

With the growth of participant- 

directed individual account plans, there 
has been an increasing recognition of 
the importance of investment advice to 
participants and beneficiaries in such 
plans. Over the past several years, the 
Department of Labor (Department) has 
issued various forms of guidance 
concerning when a person would be a 
fiduciary by reason of rendering 
investment advice and when the 
provision of investment advice might 
result in prohibited transactions.2 Most 

1 See also Code section 4975(e)(3)(B); 29 CFR 

2510.3–21(c). 

2 See Interpretative Bulletin relating to participant 

investment education, 29 CFR § 2509.96–1 
(Interpretive Bulletin 96–1); Advisory Opinion (AO) 
2005–10A (May 11, 2005); AO 2001–09A (December 
14, 2001); and AO 97–15A (May 22, 1997). 

recently, Congress and the 
Administration, responding to the need 
to afford participants and beneficiaries 
greater access to professional 
investment advice, amended the 
prohibited transaction provisions of 
ERISA and the Code, as part of the 
Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA),3 
to permit a broader array of investment 
advice providers to offer their services 
to participants and beneficiaries 
responsible for investment of assets in 
their individual accounts and, 
accordingly, for the adequacy of their 
retirement savings. 

Specifically, section 601 of the PPA 

added a statutory exemption under 
sections 408(b)(14) and 408(g) of ERISA. 
Parallel provisions were added to the 
Code at section 4975(d)(17) and 
4975(f)(8).4 Section 408(b)(14) sets forth 
the investment advice-related 
transactions that will be exempt from 
the prohibitions of section 406 if the 
requirements of section 408(g) are met. 
The transactions described in section 
408(b)(14) are: The provision of 
investment advice to the participant or 
beneficiary with respect to a security or 
other property available as an 
investment under the plan; the 
acquisition, holding or sale of a security 
or other property available as an 
investment under the plan pursuant to 
the investment advice; and the direct or 
indirect receipt of compensation by a 
fiduciary adviser or affiliate in 
connection with the provision of 
investment advice or the acquisition, 
holding or sale of a security or other 
property available as an investment 
under the plan pursuant to the 
investment advice. 

On December 4, 2006, the Department 

published a Request for Information 
(RFI) in the Federal Register soliciting 
information to assist the Department in 
the development of regulations under 
sections 408(b)(14) and 408(g).5 
Specifically, the Department invited 
interested persons to address the 
qualifications for the ‘‘eligible

2006). 

4 Under Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 

47713, October 17, 1978), 5 U.S.C. App.1, 92 Stat. 
3790, the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury 
to issue rulings under section 4975 of the Code has 
been transferred, with certain exceptions not here 
relevant, to the Secretary of Labor. Therefore, the 
references in this notice to specific sections of 
ERISA should be taken as referring also to the 
corresponding sections of the Code. 

5 71 FR 70429, Dec. 4, 2006. The Department, on 

the same date, also published a Request for 
Information in the Federal Register soliciting 
information to assist the Department in determining 
the feasibility of using computer models in 
connection with individual retirement accounts, as 
required by PPA section 601(b)(3). 72 FR 70427,

investment expert’’ that is required to 
certify that computer models used in 
connection with the statutory 
exemption meet the requirements of the 
statutory exemption. The Department 
also invited interested persons to 
provide information to assist the 
Department in developing procedures to 
be followed in certifying that a 
computer model meets the requirements 
of the statutory exemption. The 
Department also invited suggestions for 
a model disclosure form for purposes of 
the statutory exemption. In response to 
the RFI, the Department received 24 
letters addressing a variety of issues 
presented by the statutory exemption. 
These comments have been taken into 
account in developing the proposed 
regulations. 

On February 2, 2007, the Department 
issued Field Assistance Bulletin 2007– 
01 addressing certain issues presented 
by the new statutory exemption. This 
Bulletin affirmed that the enactment of 
sections 408(b)(14) and (g) did not 
invalidate or otherwise affect prior 
guidance of the Department relating to 
investment advice and that such 
guidance continues to represent the 
views of the Department.6 The Bulletin 
also confirmed the applicability of the 
principles set forth in section 408(g)(10) 
[Exemption for plan sponsor and certain 
other fiduciaries] to plan sponsors and 
fiduciaries who offered investment 
advice arrangements with respect to 
which relief under the statutory 
exemption is not required. Finally, the 
Bulletin addressed the scope of the fee- 
leveling requirement for purposes of an 
eligible investment advice arrangement 
described in section 408(g)(2)(A)(i). The 
Department’s views on that issue are set 
forth in the discussion of the proposed 
regulations that follows. 

The proposed regulations contained 

in this notice would, upon adoption, 
implement the provisions of the 
statutory exemption for the provision of 
investment advice to participants and 
beneficiaries under sections 408(b)(14) 

and 408(g). In this regard, the 
Department notes that, in an effort to 
ensure broad availability of investment 
advice to both participants and 
beneficiaries in individual account 
plans and beneficiaries with individual 
retirement accounts, the Department 
also is publishing a proposed class 
exemption for the provision of 
investment advice to such individuals. 
The proposed class exemption appears 
in the Notice section of today’s Federal 
Register. 
B. Overview of Proposed § 2550.408g–1 
1. General 

In general, proposed § 2550.408g–1 
tracks the requirements under section 
408(g) that must be satisfied in order for 
the investment advice-related 
transactions described in section 
408(b)(14) to be exempt from the 
prohibitions of section 406. 

Paragraph (a) of the proposal sets 

forth the general scope of the statutory 
exemption and regulation as providing 
relief from the prohibitions of section 
406 of ERISA for transactions described 
in section 408(b)(14) of ERISA in 
connection with the provision of 
investment advice to a participant or a 
beneficiary if the investment advice is 
provided by a fiduciary adviser under 
an ‘‘eligible investment advice 
arrangement.’’ Paragraph (a) also notes 
that the Code contains parallel 
provisions at section 4975(d)(17) and 
(f)(8). 

Paragraph (b) of the proposal provides 

that, for purposes of sections 408(g)(1) 
of ERISA and section 4975(f)(8) of the 
Code, an ‘‘eligible investment advice 
arrangement’’ shall mean an 
arrangement that meets either the 
requirements of paragraph (c) 
[describing investment advice 
arrangements that use fee-leveling] or 
paragraph (d) [describing investment 
advice arrangements that use computer 
modeling] of the proposal or both. 
2. Fee-Leveling 

6 In this regard, the Department cited the 

following: August 3, 2006 Floor Statement of Senate 
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee 
Chairman Enzi (who chaired the Conference 
Committee drafting legislation forming the basis of 
H.R. 4), regarding investment advice to participants 
in which he states, ‘‘It was the goal and objective 
of the Members of the Conference to keep this 
advisory opinion [AO 2001–09A, SunAmerica 
Advisory Opinion] intact as well as other pre- 
existing advisory opinions granted by the 
Department. This legislation does not alter the 
current or future status of the plans and their many 
participants operating under these advisory 
opinions. Rather, the legislation builds upon these 
advisory opinions and provides alternative means 
for providing investment advice which is protective 
of the interests of plan participants and IRA 
owners.’’ 152 Cong. Rec. S8,752 (daily ed. Aug. 3, 
2006) (statement of Sen. Enzi). 

With respect to arrangements that use 

fee-leveling, paragraph (c) of the 
proposal requires that any investment 
advice be based on generally accepted 
investment theories that take into 
account the historic returns of different 
asset classes over defined periods of 
time, although nothing in the proposal 
is intended to preclude investment 
advice from being based on generally 
accepted investment theories that take 
into account additional considerations. 
Paragraph (c) also requires that any 
investment advice take into account 
information furnished by a participant 
or beneficiary relating to age, life

expectancy, retirement age, risk 
tolerance, other assets or sources of 
income, and investment preferences, 
although nothing in the proposal is 
intended to preclude a fiduciary adviser 
from taking into account additional 
information that a participant or 
beneficiary may provide. While section 
408(g)(2)(A)(i) does not specifically 
reference such conditions, the 
principles are so fundamental to the 
provision of informed, individualized 
investment advice that a failure on the 
part of a plan fiduciary to insist on such 
conditions in the selection of an 
investment adviser for plan participants 
would, in the Department’s view, raise 
serious questions as to the fiduciary’s 
exercise of prudence. For this reason, 
the Department determined that such 
conditions are sufficiently significant 
that they should be included in the 
regulation implementing the statutory 
exemption for investment advice. 

With regard to compensation and fees 

for the provision of investment advice, 
paragraph (c)(1)(iii) provides that any 
fees or other compensation (including 
salary, bonuses, awards, promotions, 
commissions or other things of value) 
received, directly or indirectly, by any 
employee, agent or registered 
representative that provides investment 
advice on behalf of a fiduciary adviser 
does not vary depending on the basis of 
any investment option selected by a 
participant or beneficiary. Paragraph 
(c)(1)(iv) provides that any fees 
(including any commission or other 
compensation) received by the fiduciary 
adviser for investment advice or with 
respect to the sale, holding, or 
acquisition of any security or other 
property for purposes of investment of 
plan assets do not vary depending on 
the basis of any investment option 
selected by a participant or beneficiary. 

The individual compensation 

requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) is 
designed to safeguard against a firm’s 
creation of incentives for individuals to 
recommend certain investment 
products. It appears that, while an 
individual may have a general interest 
in the overall success of his or her 
employing firm, this interest, by itself, 
would not be inconsistent with the 
individual compensation requirement. 
This would not be the case, however, if 
the individual’s direct or indirect 
compensation or benefits vary based on 
the selection of particular investment 
options. In order to determine whether 
more precise guidance can be 
developed, we request public comment 
on the types and formulations of direct 
and indirect compensation 
arrangements being utilized, and how 
they may operate under this provision.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  164 / Friday,  August  22,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

With regard to the foregoing, the 

Department, in interpreting the scope of 
the fee-leveling requirement for 
purposes of section 408(g)(2)(A)(i), 
expressed its view, in Field Assistance 
Bulletin 2007–01 (February 2, 2007), 
that only the fees or other compensation 
of the fiduciary adviser may not vary. In 
contrast to other provisions of section 
408(b)(14) and section 408(g), the 
Department explained, section 
408(g)(2)(A)(i) references only the 
fiduciary adviser, not the fiduciary 
adviser or an affiliate. Inasmuch as a 
person, pursuant to section 
408(g)(11)(A), can be a fiduciary adviser 
only if that person is a fiduciary of the 
plan by virtue of providing investment 
advice, an affiliate of a registered 
investment adviser, a bank or similar 
financial institution, an insurance 
company, or a registered broker dealer 
will be subject to the varying fee 
limitation only if that affiliate is 
providing investment advice to plan 
participants and beneficiaries. The 
Department further noted that, 
consistent with past guidance, if the fees 
and compensation received by an 
affiliate of a fiduciary that provides 
investment advice do not vary or are 
offset against those received by the 
fiduciary for the provision of investment 
advice, no prohibited transaction would 
result solely by reason of providing 
investment advice and thus there would 
be no need for a prohibited transaction 
exemption.7 The Department, therefore, 
concluded that Congress did not intend 
for the requirement that fees not vary 
depending on the basis of any 
investment options selected to extend to 
affiliates of the fiduciary adviser, unless, 
of course, the affiliate is also a provider 
of investment advice to a plan. This 
continues to be the view of the 
Department. 

The Department also noted in the 

Bulletin that, although section 
408(g)(11)(A) generally limits ‘‘fiduciary 
advisers’’ to certain types of entities, it 
also permits employees, agents, or 
registered representatives of those 
entities to also qualify as fiduciary 
advisers if they satisfy the requirements 
of applicable insurance, banking, and 
securities laws relating to the provision 
of the advice. See section 
408(g)(11)(A)(vi). As with affiliates, 
such an individual must, for purposes of 
section 408(g)(11)(A), not only be an 
employee, agent, or registered 
representative of one of those entities, 
but also must provide investment advice 
in his or her capacity as employee, 
agent, or registered representative. The 
Department, therefore, concluded that

the language of section 408(g)(11)(A) 
required a finding that, for purposes of 
the statutory exemption, when an 
individual acts as an employee, agent or 
registered representative on behalf of an 
entity engaged to provide investment 
advice to a plan, that individual, as well 
as the entity, must be treated as the 
fiduciary adviser for purposes of section 
408(g)(11)(A) and, accordingly subject to 
the limitations of section 408(g)(2)(A)(i). 
In an effort to accommodate a wider 
variety of business structures and 
practices, making investment advice 
more available while protecting 
participants and beneficiaries, the 
Department is proposing a class 
exemption addressing fee leveling 
requirements for employees, agents and 
registered representatives, also 
appearing in today’s Federal Register. 

In addition to the foregoing, fiduciary 

advisers utilizing investment advice 
arrangements that employ fee-leveling 
must comply with the requirements of 
paragraphs (e) [authorization by plan 
fiduciary], (f) [audits], (g) [disclosure], 
(h) [miscellaneous], and (i) 
[maintenance of records] of the 
proposal, each of which is discussed in 
more detail below. 
3. Computer Models 

Paragraph (d) of the proposal 

addresses the requirements applicable 
to investment advice arrangements that 
rely on computer models. In this regard, 
paragraph (d) provides, consistent with 
the provisions of section 408(g)(3)(B), 
(C) and (D), that an arrangement shall be 
an eligible investment advice 
arrangement if the only investment 
advice provided under the arrangement 
is advice that is generated by a 
computer model described in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section 
under an investment advice program, 
and with respect to which the 
requirements of paragraphs (e) 
[authorization by plan fiduciary], (f) 
[audits], (g) [disclosure], (h) 
[miscellaneous], and (i) [maintenance of 
records] of the proposal are met and any 
acquisition, holding or sale of a security 
or other property pursuant to such 
advice occurs solely at the direction of 
the participant or beneficiary. 

Paragraph (d)(1), consistent with 

section 408(g)(3)(B)(i)–(v), sets forth the 
standards applicable to computer 
models. Specifically, paragraph (d)(1) 
requires that a computer model be 
designed and operated to: apply 
generally accepted investment theories 
that take into account the historic 
returns of different asset classes over 
defined periods of time, although 
nothing in the proposal is intended to 
preclude a computer model from 

applying generally accepted investment 
theories that take into account 
additional considerations; utilize 
information furnished by a participant 
or beneficiary relating to age, life 
expectancy, retirement age, risk 
tolerance, other assets or sources of 
income, and investment preferences, 
although nothing in the proposal 
precludes a computer model from taking 
into account additional information that 
a plan or a participant or beneficiary 
may provide; and utilize appropriate 
objective criteria to provide asset 
allocation portfolios comprised of 
investment options available under the 
plan. See paragraph (d)(1)(i)–(iii) of the 
proposal. 

In addition to the foregoing, a 
computer model, consistent with 
section 408(g)(3)(B)(iv),8 must be 
designed and operated to avoid 
investment recommendations that: 
inappropriately favor investment 
options offered by the fiduciary adviser 
or a person with a material affiliation or 
material contractual relationship with 
the fiduciary adviser over other 
investment options, if any, available 
under the plan; or inappropriately favor 
investment options that may generate 
greater income for the fiduciary adviser 
or a person with a material affiliation or 
material contractual relationship with 
the fiduciary adviser. In order to 
determine if further guidance can be 
developed with respect to this 
provision, the Department seeks public 
comment on circumstances under 
which it would be appropriate or 
inappropriate to favor particular 
investment options. For example, the 
Department believes that favoring a 
higher-cost investment alternative over 
an otherwise identical investment 
alternative with lower cost would be 
inappropriate. 

As reflected in the language, a 

computer model would not fail to meet 
this requirement merely because the 
only investment options offered under 
the plan are options offered by the 
fiduciary adviser or a person with a 
material affiliation or material 
contractual relationship with the 
fiduciary adviser. The language also 
makes clear that models cannot be 
designed and operated to 
inappropriately favor those investment 
options that generate the most income 
for the fiduciary adviser or a person 
with a material affiliation or material 
contractual relationship with the 
fiduciary adviser. The proposal defines 

8 Pursuant to section 408(g)(3)(B)(iv), a computer 
model must operate ‘‘in a manner that is not biased 
in favor of investments offered by the fiduciary 
adviser or a person with a material affiliation or 
contractual relationship with the fiduciary adviser.’’

a ‘‘material affiliation’’ and ‘‘material 
contractual relationship’’ at paragraphs 
(j)(6) and (j)(7), respectively. 

Paragraph (d)(1) further requires, 

consistent with section 408(g)(3)(B)(v),9 
that computer models take into account 
all ‘‘designated investment options’’ 
available under the plan without giving 
inappropriate weight to any investment 
option. See paragraph (d)(1)(v) of the 
proposal. The term ‘‘designated 
investment option’’ is defined in 
paragraph (j)(1) of the proposal, to mean 
any investment option designated by the 
plan into which participants and 
beneficiaries may direct the investment 
of assets held in, or contributed to, their 
individual accounts. The term 
‘‘designated investment option’’ does 
not include ‘‘brokerage windows,’’ ‘‘self- 
directed brokerage accounts,’’ or similar 
plan arrangements that enable 
participants and beneficiaries to select 
investments beyond those designated by 
the plan. 

Paragraph (d)(1)(v) also provides that 

a computer model shall not be treated 
as failing to take all designated 
investment options into account merely 
because it does not take into account an 
investment option that constitutes an 
investment primarily in qualifying 
employer securities. Any such 
limitation on the investment advice to 
be generated by the computer model, 
however, must be disclosed to 
participants and beneficiaries under 
paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of the proposal, 
discussed below. Information received 
by the Department in response to both 
of its RFIs indicated that there are 
challenges attendant to developing 
computer models, which generally are 
based on underlying theories that rely 
on diversified asset classes, that address 
a single undiversified security, such as 
qualifying employer securities, in 
connection with generating investment 
recommendations that would enable a 
participant to construct a well- 
diversified investment portfolio. The 
Department is concerned that extending 
this requirement to qualifying employer 
securities might discourage 
arrangements based on utilization of a 
computer model, or otherwise limit 
their availability.10 Accordingly, the 

9 Section 408(g)(3)(B)(v) provides that computer 

models must take ‘‘into account all investment 
options under the plan in specifying how a 
participant’s account balance should be invested 
and is not inappropriately weighted with respect to 
any investment option.’’ 

10 It should be noted that, even in the absence of 

individualized advice, participants are reminded on 
a quarterly basis, via their pension benefit 
statements, of the importance of maintaining a 
diversified portfolio. Model language for purposes 
of this disclosure was set forth in Field Assistance 
Bulletin 2006–03 (Dec. 20, 2006). Among other

Department has excluded investments 
primarily in qualifying employer 
securities from the requirement of 
paragraph (d)(1)(v) of the proposal. 
Paragraph (d)(2) of the proposal 

requires that, prior to utilization of the 
computer model, the fiduciary adviser 
obtain a written certification that the 
computer model meets the requirements 
of paragraph (d)(1), discussed above. If 
the model is modified in a manner that 
may affect its ability to meet the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1), the 
fiduciary adviser, prior to utilization of 
the modified model, must obtain a new 
certification. With regard to the 
certification, paragraph (d)(2) requires 
that the fiduciary adviser obtain a 
certification that meets the requirements 
of paragraph (d)(4) from an ‘‘eligible 
investment expert,’’ within the meaning 
of paragraph (d)(3). 

Paragraph (d)(3) of the proposal 

defines an ‘‘eligible investment expert’’ 
to mean a person that, through 
employees or otherwise, has the 
appropriate technical training or 
experience and proficiency to analyze, 
determine and certify, in a manner 
consistent with paragraph (d)(4), 
whether a computer model meets the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section; except that the term eligible 
investment expert does not include any 
person that has any material affiliation 
or material contractual relationship with 
the fiduciary adviser, with a person 
with a material affiliation or material 
contractual relationship with the 
fiduciary adviser, or with any employee, 
agent, or registered representative of the 
foregoing. After consideration of the 
public comments, the Department has 
concluded that it would be very difficult 
to define a specific set of academic or 
other credentials that would serve to 
define the appropriate expertise and 
experience for an eligible investment 
expert. 

Accordingly, under the proposal, it is 
the fiduciary adviser who is responsible 
for determining whether an eligible 
investment expert, itself or its 
employees, possesses the requisite 
training and experience to certify 
whether a given computer model meets 
the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) in 
a manner consistent with paragraph 
(d)(4) of the proposal. Paragraph (d)(5) 
of the proposal provides that, for 
purposes of the statutory exemption, the 
selection of the eligible investment 
expert by the fiduciary adviser is a 

things the model language provides that ‘‘[I]f you 
invest more than 20% of your retirement savings in 
any one company or industry, your savings may not 
be properly diversified. Although diversification is 
not a guarantee against loss, it is an effective 
strategy to help you manage investment risk.’’ 

fiduciary act governed by section 
404(a)(1) of ERISA. 

The Department notes that, although 

the proposal gives latitude to a fiduciary 
adviser in selecting an eligible 
investment expert to certify a computer 
model, as the party seeking prohibited 
transaction relief under the exemption, 
the fiduciary adviser has the burden of 
demonstrating that all applicable 
requirements of exemption are satisfied 
with respect to its arrangement. We also 
note that section 404 of ERISA requires 
the fiduciary adviser to act reasonably 
and prudently in its selection. 

Paragraph (d)(4) of the proposal 
provides that a certification by an 
eligible investment expert shall be in 
writing and contain the following: an 
identification of the methodology or 
methodologies applied in determining 
whether the computer model meets the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section; an explanation of how the 
applied methodology or methodologies 
demonstrated that the computer model 
met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section; and a description of any 
limitations that were imposed by any 
person on the eligible investment 
expert’s selection or application of 
methodologies for determining whether 
the computer model meets the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1). In 
addition the certification is required to 
contain a representation that the 
methodology or methodologies were 
applied by a person or persons with the 
educational background, technical 
training or experience necessary to 
analyze and determine whether the 
computer model meets the requirements 
of paragraph (d)(1); and a statement 
certifying that the eligible investment 
expert has determined that the 
computer model meets the requirements 
of paragraph (d)(1). Finally the 
certification must be signed by the 
eligible investment expert. 

With regard to the certification 

described in paragraph (d)(4) of the 
proposal, public comments suggested a 
number of different approaches that 
could be followed in determining 
computer model consistency with the 
statutory criteria. The comments did 
not, however, suggest a single suitable 
approach. The Department, therefore, is 
wary of mandating a methodology under 
the proposal. The Department also 
believes that as computer models and 
their use under investment advice 
arrangements continue to develop, 
experts may need the flexibility to 
develop new methodologies for 
examining those models. Accordingly, 
paragraph (d)(4) does not require a 
particular methodology to be applied for 
purposes of certification.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  164 / Friday,  August  22,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

4. Authorized by a Plan Fiduciary 

Consistent with the section 408(g)(4) 

of ERISA, the proposal provides, at 
paragraph (e), that the arrangement 
pursuant to which investment advice is 
provided to participants and 
beneficiaries must be expressly 
authorized by a plan fiduciary (or, in the 
case of an IRA, the IRA beneficiary) 
other than: the person offering the 
arrangement; any person providing 
designated investment options under 
the plan; or any affiliate of either. The 
proposal further provides that for 
purposes of such authorization, an IRA 
beneficiary will not be treated as an 
affiliate of a person solely by reason of 
being an employee of such person, 
thereby enabling employees of a 
fiduciary adviser to take advantage of 
investment advice arrangements offered 
by their employer under the exemption. 
5. Annual Audit 

Paragraph (f) addresses the audit 
requirements of section 408(g)(6) of 
ERISA. Specifically, paragraph (f)(1) 
provides that the fiduciary adviser shall, 
at least annually, engage an 
independent auditor, who has 
appropriate technical training or 
experience and proficiency, and so 
represents in writing to the fiduciary 
adviser, to conduct an audit of the 
investment advice arrangements for 
compliance with the requirements of the 
proposal and within 60 days following 
completion of the audit, issue a written 
report to the fiduciary adviser and, 
except with respect to an arrangement 
with an IRA, to each fiduciary who 
authorized the use of the investment 
advice arrangement, consistent with 
paragraph (e) of the proposal, setting 
forth the specific findings of the auditor 
regarding compliance of the 
arrangement with the requirements of 
the proposal. 

Given the significant number of 

reports that an auditor would be 
required to send if the written report 
was required to be furnished to all IRA 
beneficiaries, the Department framed an 
alternative requirement for investment 
advice arrangements for IRAs. This 
alternative is set forth in paragraph (f)(2) 
of the proposal. The alternative provides 
that, with respect to an arrangements 
with an IRA, the fiduciary adviser shall, 
within 30 days following receipt of the 
report from the auditor, furnish a copy 
of the report to the IRA beneficiary or 
make such report available on its 
website, provided that such 
beneficiaries are provided information, 
along with other required disclosures 
(see paragraph (g) of the proposal), 
concerning the purpose of the report,

and how and where to locate the report 
applicable to their account. With respect 
to making the report available on a 
website, the Department believes that 
this alternative to furnishing reports to 
IRA beneficiaries satisfies the 
requirement of section 104(d)(1) of the 
Electronic Signatures in Global and 
National Commerce Act (E–SIGN) 11 that 
any exemption from the consumer 
consent requirements of section 101(c) 
of E–SIGN must be necessary to 
eliminate a substantial burden on 
electronic commerce and will not 
increase the material risk of harm to 
consumers. The Department solicits 
comments on this finding. Paragraph 
(f)(2) also provides that, when the report 
of the auditor identifies noncompliance 
with the requirements of the regulation, 
the fiduciary adviser must send a copy 
of the report to the Department. As 
proposed, the fiduciary adviser must 
submit the report to the Department 
within 30 days following receipt of the 
report from the auditor. The submission 
of this report will enable the 
Department to monitor compliance with 
the statutory exemption in those 
instances where there is no authorizing 
ERISA plan fiduciary to carry out that 
function. 

For purposes of paragraph (f) of the 

proposal, an auditor is considered 
independent if it does not have a 
material affiliation or material 
contractual relationship with the person 
offering the investment advice 
arrangement to the plan or any 
designated investment options under 
the plan. The terms ‘‘material 
affiliation’’ and ‘‘material contractual 
relationship’’ are defined in paragraphs 
(j)(6) and (7) of the proposal. 

With regard to the scope of the audit, 

paragraph (f)(4) provides that the 
auditor shall review sufficient relevant 
information to formulate an opinion as 
to whether the investment advice 
arrangements, and the advice provided 
pursuant thereto, offered by the 
fiduciary adviser during the audit 
period were in compliance with the 
regulation. Paragraph (f)(4) further 
provides that it is not intended to 
preclude an auditor from using 
information obtained by sampling, as 
reasonably determined appropriate by 
the auditor, investment advice 
arrangements, and the advice pursuant 
thereto, during the audit period. The 
proposal, therefore, does not require an 
audit of every investment advice 
arrangement at the plan or fiduciary 
adviser-level or of all the advice that is 
provided under the exemption. In 
general, the proposal leaves to the 

11 15 U.S.C. 7004(d)(1) (2000). 

auditor the determination as to the 
appropriate scope of their review and 
the extent to which they can rely on 
representative samples for determining 
compliance with the exemption. 
6. Disclosure 

The disclosure provisions are set forth 

in paragraph (g) of the proposal and 
generally track the disclosure provisions 
of the statutory exemption at section 
408(g)(6) of ERISA. In this regard, the 
proposal, at paragraph (g)(1), requires 
that the fiduciary adviser provide to 
participants and beneficiaries, prior to 
the initial provision of investment 
advice with regard to any security or 
other property offered as an investment 
option, a written notification describing: 
the role of any party that has a material 
affiliation or material contractual 
relationship with the fiduciary adviser 
in the development of the investment 
advice program, and in the selection of 
investment options available under the 
plan; the past performance and 
historical rates of return of the 
designated investment options available 
under the plan, to the extent that such 
information is not otherwise provided; 
all fees or other compensation relating 
to the advice that the fiduciary adviser 
or any affiliate thereof is to receive 
(including compensation provided by 
any third party) in connection with the 
provision of the advice or in connection 
with the sale, acquisition, or holding of 
the security or other property; and any 
material affiliation or material 
contractual relationship of the fiduciary 
adviser or affiliates thereof in the 
security or other property. 

The notification to participants and 

beneficiaries also is required to explain: 
the manner, and under what 
circumstances, any participant or 
beneficiary information provided under 
the arrangement will be used or 
disclosed; the types of services provided 
by the fiduciary adviser in connection 
with the provision of investment advice 
by the fiduciary adviser, including, with 
respect to an arrangement described in 
paragraph (d) utilizing a computer 
model, any limitations on the ability of 
the model to take into account an 
investment primarily in qualifying 
employer securities, as provided for in 
paragraph (d)(1)(v) of the proposal; that 
the adviser is acting as a fiduciary of the 
plan in connection with the provision of 
the advice; and that a recipient of the 
advice may separately arrange for the 
provision of advice by another adviser 
that could have no material affiliation 
with and receive no fees or other 
compensation in connection with the 
security or other property.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  164 / Friday,  August  22,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

49901 

Paragraph (g)(2) of the proposal 

requires that the notification furnished 
to participants and beneficiaries be 
written in a clear and conspicuous 
manner and in a manner calculated to 
be understood by the average plan 
participant and must be sufficiently 
accurate and comprehensive to 
reasonably apprise such participants 
and beneficiaries of the information 
required to be provided in the 
notification. 

The appendix to the proposal 

contains a model disclosure form that 
may be used for purposes of satisfying 
the fee and compensation disclosure 
requirement of paragraph (g)(1)(iii), as 
well as the requirements of paragraph 
(g)(2), of the proposal. The proposal 
makes clear, however, that the use of the 
model disclosure form is not mandatory. 

Paragraph (g)(3) makes clear that the 

required disclosures may be provided in 
written or electronic form. 

Paragraph (g)(4) of the proposal, like 
section 408(g)(6)(B) of ERISA, sets forth 
miscellaneous recordkeeping and 
furnishing responsibilities of the 
fiduciary adviser. Specifically, 
paragraph (g)(4) provides that, at all 
times during the provision of advisory 
services to the participant or beneficiary 
pursuant to the arrangement, the 
fiduciary adviser must: Maintain the 
information described in paragraph 
(g)(1) in accurate form; provide, without 
charge, accurate information to the 
recipient of the advice no less 
frequently than annually; provide, 
without charge, accurate information to 
the recipient of the advice upon request 
of the recipient; and provide, without 
charge, accurate information to the 
recipient of the advice concerning any 
material change to the information 
required to be provided to the recipient 
of the advice at a time reasonably 
contemporaneous to the change in 
information. 
7. Other Conditions 

Paragraph (h) of the proposal, like 
section 408(g)(7) of ERISA, sets forth 
additional conditions applicable to the 
provision of advice under the statutory 
exemption. These requirements are as 
follows: The fiduciary adviser must 
provide appropriate disclosure, in 
connection with the sale, acquisition, or 
holding of the security or other 
property, in accordance with all 
applicable securities laws; the sale, 
acquisition, or holding occurs solely at 
the direction of the recipient of the 
advice; the compensation received by 
the fiduciary adviser and affiliates 
thereof in connection with the sale, 
acquisition, or holding of the security or 
other property is reasonable; and the

terms of the sale, acquisition, or holding 
of the security or other property are at 
least as favorable to the plan as an arm’s 
length transaction would be. 
8. Maintenance of Records 

Paragraph (i) of the proposal sets forth 

the record maintenance requirements. 
Consistent with section 408(g)(9) of 
ERISA, paragraph (i) of the proposal 
provides that the fiduciary adviser must 
maintain, for a period of not less than 
6 years after the provision of investment 
advice pursuant to the arrangement, any 
records necessary for determining 
whether the applicable requirements of 
the proposal have been met. Also, 
paragraph (i), as with section 408(g)(9), 
makes clear that a prohibited 
transaction shall not be considered to 
have occurred solely because the 
records are lost or destroyed prior to the 
end of the 6-year period due to 
circumstances beyond the control of the 
fiduciary adviser. 
9. Definitions 

Paragraph (j) of the proposal sets forth 

a number of definitions relevant to the 
statutory exemption and this proposed 
regulation. 

Paragraph (j)(1), as discussed earlier, 

defines the term ‘‘designated investment 
option.’’ Paragraph (j)(2) sets forth the 
definition of ‘‘fiduciary adviser,’’ as it 
appears in section 408(g)(11)(A) of 
ERISA. With regard to that part of the 
fiduciary adviser definition that treats 
persons who develop computer models 
or market investment advice programs 
or computer models as a fiduciary of the 
plan by reason of providing investment 
advice and as a fiduciary adviser for 
purposes of section 408(b)(14), the 
Department is proposing a separate 
regulation (§ 2550.408g–2), discussed 
below, pursuant to which a single 
fiduciary adviser may elect to be treated 
as a fiduciary with the respect to the 
plan. 

Paragraph (j)(3) of the proposal adopts 

the statutory definition of ‘‘registered 
representative’’ set forth in ERISA 
section 408(g)(11)(C), which states that 
a registered representative of another 
entity means a person described in 
section 3(a)(18) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78c(a)(18)) (substituting the entity for 
the broker or dealer referred to in such 
section) or a person described in section 
202(a)(17) of the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b–2(a)(17)) 
(substituting the entity for the 
investment adviser referred to in such 
section). 

Paragraph (j)(4), consistent with 

section 601(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Pension 
Protection Act of 2006, defines the term 

‘‘Individual Retirement Account’’ to 
mean plans described in paragraphs (B) 
through (F) of section 4975(e)(1) of the 
Code, as well as a trust, plan, account, 
or annuity which, at any time, has been 
determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury to be described in such 
paragraphs. 

Paragraph (j)(5) of the proposed rule 

defines the term ‘‘affiliate.’’ For 
purposes of the proposal, an ‘‘affiliate’’ 
of another person means: Any person 
directly or indirectly owning, 
controlling, or holding with power to 
vote, 5 percent or more of the 
outstanding voting securities of such 
other person; any person 5 percent or 
more of whose outstanding voting 
securities are directly or indirectly 
owned, controlled, or held with power 
to vote, by such other person; any 
person directly or indirectly controlling, 
controlled by, or under common control 
with, such other person; and any officer, 
director, partner, copartner, or employee 
of such other person. Consistent with 
ERISA section 408(g)(11)(B), this 
definition is based on the definition of 
an ‘‘affiliated person’’ of an entity as 
contained in section 2(a)(3) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (ICA), 
except that it does not reflect clauses (E) 
and (F) thereof. The Department has 
initially determined that including 
provisions similar to clauses (E) and (F) 
is unnecessary, because these clauses 
appear to focus on persons who exercise 
control over the management of an 
investment company.12 Also, such 
parties will nonetheless be treated as an 
affiliate because they would be a person 
directly or indirectly controlling, 
controlled by, or under common control 
with, such other person. See paragraph 
(j)(5)(iii) of the proposal. Additionally, 
the Department is concerned that 
including provisions similar to clauses 
(E) and (F), which focus on functions 
involving investment companies, but 
not other types of vehicles in which 
plans may invest, could have the 
unintended consequence of possibly 
subjecting persons associated with 
investment companies to different 
requirements under these proposed 
regulations. Therefore, the Department 
is proposing to define affiliate without 
regard to clauses (E) and (F) of section 
2(a)(3) of the ICA. 

In a variety of places in the regulation 

reference is made to persons with 

12 ICA section 2(a)(3)(E) and (F) include in the 
definition of affiliated person: If the other person 
is an investment company, any investment adviser 
thereof or any member of an advisory board thereof; 
and if such other person is an unincorporated 
investment company not having a board of 
directors, the depositor thereof. 15 U.S.C. 80a– 
2(a)(3)(E)–(F).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  164 / Friday,  August  22,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

‘‘material affiliations’’ and ‘‘material 
contractual relationships.’’ See 
paragraphs (d)(1)(iv), (d)(3), (f)(3), 
(g)(1)(i), (g)(1)(iv) and (g)(1)(viii) of the 
proposal. For purposes of this 
regulation, those terms are defined in 
paragraphs (j)(6) and (j)(7), respectively. 

Paragraph (j)(6) of the proposal 

describes a person with a ‘‘material 
affiliation’’ with another person as: Any 
affiliate of such other person; any 
person directly or indirectly owning, 
controlling, or holding, 5 percent or 
more of the interests of such other 
person; or any person 5 percent or more 
of whose interests are directly or 
indirectly owned, controlled, or held, by 
such other person. In determining 
‘‘interest,’’ paragraph (j)(6)(ii) provides 
that an ‘‘interest’’ means with respect to 
an entity: The combined voting power 
of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 
the total value of the shares of all classes 
of stock of the entity if the entity is a 
corporation; the capital interest or the 
profits interest of the entity if the entity 
is a partnership; or the beneficial 
interest of the entity if the entity is a 
trust or unincorporated enterprise. 

Paragraph (j)(7) of the proposal 

provides that persons shall be treated as 
having a ‘‘material contractual 
relationship’’ if payments made by one 
person to the other person pursuant to 
written contracts or agreements between 
the persons exceed 10 percent of the 
gross revenue, on an annual basis, of 
such other person. The Department 
believes that one person’s receipt of 
more than 10 percent of gross revenue 
from another person is sufficiently 
significant to be considered material. 
However, the Department specifically 
invites comments on whether the 
percentage test should be higher or 
lower and, if so, why. 

The proposal, at paragraph (j)(8), 

defines ‘‘control’’ to mean the power to 
exercise a controlling influence over the 
management or policies of a person 
other than an individual. 
C. Overview of Proposed § 2550.408g–2 
Proposed § 2550.408g–2, as indicated 

above, addresses the requirements for 
electing to be treated as a fiduciary and 
fiduciary adviser by reason of 
developing or marketing a computer 
model or an investment advice program 
used in an eligible investment advice 
arrangement. See section 408(g)(11)(A). 

Section 408(g)(11)(A) provides that, 

with respect to an arrangement that 
relies on use of a computer model to 
qualify as an ‘‘eligible investment 
advice arrangement,’’ a person who 
develops the computer model, or 
markets the investment advice program 
or computer model, shall be treated as 

a fiduciary of a plan by reason of the 
provision of investment advice referred 
to in ERISA section 3(21)(A)(ii) to the 
plan participant or beneficiary, and 
shall be treated as a ‘‘fiduciary adviser’’ 
for purposes of ERISA section 408(b)(14) 
and (g). Section 4975(f)(8) of the Code 
contains a parallel provision to ERISA 
section 408(g)(11)(A). Proposed 
§ 2550.408g–2 sets forth requirements 
that must be satisfied in order for one 
such fiduciary adviser to elect to be 
treated as a fiduciary under such an 
eligible investment advice arrangement. 
See paragraph (a) of § 2550.408g–2. 
Paragraph (b)(1) of § 2550.408g–2 

provides that if an election meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of the 
proposal, then the person identified in 
the election shall be the sole fiduciary 
adviser treated as a fiduciary by reason 
of developing or marketing a computer 
model, or marketing an investment 
advice program, used in an eligible 
investment advice arrangement. 
Paragraph (b)(2) requires that the 
election be in writing and that the 
writing: Identify the arrangement, and 
person offering the arrangement, with 
respect to which the election is to be 
effective; and identify the person who is 
the fiduciary adviser, the person who 
develops the computer model or 
markets the computer model or 
investment advice program with respect 
to the arrangement, and the person who 
elects to be treated as the only fiduciary, 
and fiduciary adviser, by reason of 
developing such computer model or 
marketing such computer model or 
investment advice program. Paragraph 
(b)(2) of § 2550.408g–2 also requires that 
the election be signed by the person 
acknowledging that it elects to be 
treated as the only fiduciary and 
fiduciary adviser; that a copy of the 
election be furnished to the plan 
fiduciary who authorized use of the 
arrangement; and that the writing be 
retained in accordance with the record 
retention requirements of § 2550.408g– 
1(i). 
D. Effective Date 

The Department proposes that the 

regulations contained in this notice will 
be effective 60 days after publication of 
the final regulations in the Federal 
Register. The Department invites 
comments on whether the final 
regulations should be made effective on 
a different date. 
E. Request for Comments 

The Department invites comments 

from interested persons on the proposed 
regulations. To facilitate the receipt and 
processing of comment letters, the 
Employee Benefits Security 

Administration (EBSA) encourages 
interested persons to submit their 
comments electronically by e-mail to 
e-ORI@dol.gov (Subject: Investment 
Advice Regulations), or by using the 
Federal eRulemaking portal at http:// 
www.regulations.gov (follow 
instructions for submission of 
comments). Persons submitting 
comments electronically are encouraged 
not to submit paper copies. Persons 
interested in submitting paper copies 
should send or deliver their comments 
to the Office of Regulations and 
Interpretations, Employee Benefits 
Security Administration, Attn: 
Investment Advice Regulations, Room 
N–5655, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 
Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, 
DC 20210. All comments will be

The comment period for the proposed 

regulations will end 45 days after 
publication of the proposed rule in the 
Federal Register. The Department 
believes that this period of time will 
afford interested persons an adequate 
amount of time to analyze the proposals 
and submit comments. Written 
comments on the proposed regulations 
should be submitted to the Department 
of Labor on or before October 6, 2008. 
F. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
Summary 

The Department anticipates that this 
proposed regulation and proposed class 
exemption, by extending quality, expert 
investment advice to more retirement 
plan participants, together will improve 
their investment results by 
approximately $14 billion or more 
annually, at a cost of $4 billion, thereby 
producing a net financial benefit of $10 
billion or more. The improved 
investment results will reflect 
reductions in investment errors such as 
payment of higher than necessary fees 
and expenses, poor trading strategies, 
and inadequate diversification. The 
provisions of this proposed regulation 
and the conditions attached to this 
proposed class exemption reflect the 
Department’s efforts to ensure that the 
advice provided pursuant to them will 
be affordable and of high quality.

there is evidence that many participants 
and beneficiaries in participant-directed 
defined contribution (DC) plans and 
beneficiaries of individual retirement 
accounts (IRAs) (collectively hereafter, 
‘‘participants’’), beset by flawed 
information or reasoning, make poor 
investment decisions. These 
participants may pay higher fees and 
expenses than necessary for investment 
products and services, engage in 
excessive or poorly timed trading or fail 
to rebalance their portfolios, 
inadequately diversify their portfolios 
and thereby assume uncompensated 
risk, take more or less than optimal 
levels of compensated risk, and/or pay 
unnecessarily high taxes. Financial 
losses (including foregone earnings) 
from such mistakes likely amount to 
more than $100 billion per year. These 
losses compound and grow larger as 
workers progress toward and into 
retirement. 

Such mistakes and consequent losses 
historically can be attributed at least in 
part to provisions of federal law that 
effectively preclude a variety of 
arrangements whereby financial 
professionals might otherwise provide 
retirement plan participants with expert 
investment advice. These ‘‘prohibited 
transaction’’ provisions of ERISA and 
the Internal Revenue Code prohibit 
fiduciaries from dealing with DC plan or 
IRA assets in ways that advance their 
own interests. These provisions prohibit 
plan fiduciaries from exercising the 
authority, control, or responsibility that 
makes such persons fiduciaries when 
they have an interest which may 
conflict with the interests of the plan for 
which they act. Under these provisions 
financial advisers who have a direct or 
indirect stake in participants’ 
investment decisions generally may not 
provide them with investment advice. 
In recognition that certain transactions 
could nonetheless be beneficial to plans 
and their participants and beneficiaries, 
subject to safeguards appropriate to 
protect against potential abuses, 
Congress enacted a number of statutory 
prohibited transaction exemptions, and 
also gave the Department conditional 
authority to grant prohibited transaction 
exemptions. In this regard, the 
prohibited transaction exemption for the 
provision of investment advice added 
by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 
(PPA) opened the door to more types of 
investment advice arrangements by 
conditionally permitting arrangements 
where the fiduciary adviser or an 
affiliate thereof has a financial stake in 
the advised participants’ investment 
decisions. The Department is proposing 
a regulation to further specify the PPA’s

applicable conditions, together with a 
class exemption to establish alternative 
conditions under which such 
arrangements may operate. Together 
these actions are intended to increase 
the availability of investment advice. 

The results of this proposed 
regulation and proposed class 
exemption will depend on their impacts 
on the availability, cost, use, and quality 
of participant investment advice. The 
Department expects that, as a result of 
these actions, quality, affordable advice 
will proliferate, producing significant 
net gains for participants. 
Investment Mistakes 

The Department believes that many 

participants make costly investment 
mistakes and therefore could benefit 
from receiving and following good 
advice. In theory, investors can optimize 
their investment mix over time to match 
their investment horizon and personal 
taste for risk and return. But in practice 
many investors do not optimize their 
investments, at least not in accordance 
with generally accepted financial 
theories. 

Some investors fail to exhibit clear, 
fixed and rational preferences for risk 
and return. Some base their decisions 
on flawed information or reasoning. For 
example some appear to anchor 
decisions inappropriately to plan 
features or to mental accounts or frames, 
or to rely excessively on past 
performance measures or peer 
examples. Some suffer from 
overconfidence, myopia, or simple 
inertia.13 

Such informational and behavioral 

problems translate into at least five 
distinct types of investment mistakes,14 
which together generate financial losses 
(including foregone earnings) of $109 
billion or more annually 15 for DC plan 
and IRA participants, the Department 
estimates. 
Fees and Expenses 

Investors sometimes pay higher fees 

and expenses than necessary for 

13 See, e.g., Richard H. Thaler & Shlomo Benartzi,

Weisbenner, Individual Account Investment 
Options and Portfolio Choice: Behavioral Lessons 
from 401(k) Plans, Social Science Research Network 
Abstract 631886 (Dec. 2004). 

14 It should be noted that much of the research 

documenting investment mistakes does not account 
for whether advice was present or not. At least 
some of the mistakes may have been made despite 
good advice to the contrary; some may have been 
made pursuant to bad advice. There is evidence 
both that advice sometimes is not followed, and 
that it sometimes is bad. This is explored more 
below.

wide uncertainty. 

investment products and services. There 
is evidence that mutual funds with 
poorer gross performance (that is 
performance before deducting fees) also 
have higher fees. This suggests that 
higher fees sometimes do not reflect 
value added by managers. Investors 
often pay inadequate attention to fee 
differences, even in connection with 
highly comparable products like 
competing S&P 500 index funds.16 

16 A number of studies conclude that investors 

often pay higher fees than necessary. 

Javier Gil-Bazo & Pablo Ruiz-Verdu´ , Yet Another 
Puzzle? Relation Between Price and Performance in 
the Mutual Fund Industry, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 947448 (March 2007) find that 
funds with worse before-fee performance charge 
higher fees. They suggest that funds faced with 
insensitive investors charge higher fees, finding that 
even after controlling for performance sensitivity, 
funds with lower expected performance set higher 
fees. They hypothesize that lower performing funds 
lose sophisticated investors to higher performing 
funds, then are left with relatively unsophisticated 
investors who are not as responsive to price. 

According to Ali Hortacsu & Chad Syverson, 

Product Differentiation, Search Costs, and 
Competition in the Mutual Fund Industry: A Case 
Study of S&P 500 Index Funds, Social Science 
Research Network Abstract 405642 (April 2003), 75 
percent of S&P 500 Index Funds have expense 
ratios in excess of 47 basis points, 50 percent in 
excess of 72 basis points and 25 percent in excess 
of 149 basis points. The highest cost fund charged 
annualized investor fees that were nearly 30 times 
greater than the lowest-cost fund (268 vs. 9.5 basis 
points). Low-cost funds have a dominant market 
share, but the asset share of the low-cost funds has 
fallen consistently since 1995.

of investors, the experienced that buy low-cost no-

to load fees. They argue that front-end load fees are 
generally observable as a dollar amount on the first 
statement while the effects of administrative fees on 
the account balance are hidden by the volatility of 
fund returns. They find evidence of learning; repeat 
mutual fund purchasers pay on average about half 
the load fees of first time mutual fund purchasers.

more knowledgable investors holding similar funds. 
Less sophisticated investors are more likely to 
invest in funds with loads. Load funds on average

higher than no-load funds. While a large part of the 
higher expense ratio is composed of 12b–1 fees,

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  164 / Friday,  August  22,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

The Department estimates that DC 

plan participants 17 and IRA 
beneficiaries together recently paid fees 
and expenses that were higher than 
necessary by $8 billion or more 
annually on aggregate.18 Good advice 

fund’s advisor is the most likely beneficiary of this 
growth.’’ 

Edwin J. Elton et al., Are Investors Rational? 

Choices Among Index Funds, Social Science 
Research Network Abstract 340482 (June 2002) find 
that buying S&P 500 index mutual funds using 
expenses as the predictor of future success leads to 
picking funds with better returns. They find that the 
ten percent of funds with the lowest expenses out 
performs the ten percent of funds with the highest 
expenses by 0.92 percent a year. They find that for 
S&P 500 index mutual funds, the incentive for 
brokers and financial planners to push the fund (as 
represented by loads) is more important for new 
flows than is avoiding high cost and poorly 
performing funds. They are unable to find any effect 
of the quality of services on flows. 

James J. Choi et al., Why Does the Law of One 

Price Fail? An Experiment on Index Mutual Funds, 
National Bureau of Economic Research Working 
Paper W12261 (May 2006) offer experimental 
evidence that index fund investors are largely 
insensitive to fees. 

Some other studies suggest, however, that fee 
levels may in fact be competitive and efficient. 
Many studies fail to measure potential non- 
financial benefits investors might derive from 
professional investment advice. Victoria Leonard- 
Chambers & Michael Bogdan, Why Do Mutual Fund 
Investors Use Professional Financial Advisers?, 
Investment Company Institute Research 
Fundamentals, Volume 16, Number 1 (April 2007) 
present results of a survey ‘‘that identifies the 
benefits investors say they receive from using 
professional financial advisers,’’ and contrast this 
perspective with that of studies that rely on 
‘‘performance and other publicly available 
measures to examine the value’’ of such advice. 
Other studies find that investors with more 
intelligence or financial literacy often pay similar 
fees as those with less, and suggest this is consistent 
with the hypothesis that fees are competitive and 
efficient (see, e.g., Sebastian Miller & Martin Weber, 
Financial Literacy and Mutual Fund Investments: 
Who Buys Actively Managed Funds?, Social Science 
Research Network Abstract 1093305 (Feb. 2008); 
and Mark Grinblatt et al., Are Mutual Fund Fees 
Competitive? What IQ-Related Behavior Tells Us, 
Social Science Research Network Abstract 1087120 
(Nov. 2007)). 

The Department understands that some of what 

might otherwise appear to be higher than necessary 
fees paid by investors pursuant to advice may in 
fact reflect indirect payment of the reasonable cost 
of the advice itself. 

17 DC plan participants’ investment choices 

typically are limited to a menu selected by a plan 
fiduciary who is responsible for ensuring that the 
associated fees and expenses are reasonable. 
However, such participants may pay more overall 
than would be optimal if they do not appropriately 
consider fees and expenses when allocating their 
assets across available investments. 

18 ‘‘Higher than necessary’’ here means that the 

participant could have obtained equal value 
without incurring the expense. This calculation 
assumes that participants on average pay 11 or more 
basis points in unnecessary fees and expenses, in 
the form of expense ratios or loads. This 
assumption is likely to be conservative in light of 
evidence on the distribution of investor expense 
levels presented in Deloitte Financial Advisory 
Services LLP, Fees and Revenue Sharing in Defined 
Contribution Retirement Plans (Dec. 6, 2007) 
(unpublished, on file with the Department of 
Labor); Brad M. Barber et al., Out of Sight, Out of 

could eliminate some of this 
unnecessary expense.19 
Poor Trading Strategies 

There is evidence that some 

participants trade excessively, while 
many more trade too little, failing even 
to rebalance. In DC plans, participant 
trading often worsens performance, and 
those with automatic rebalancing 
generally fare best.20 Relative to 
automatic rebalancing, inferior trading 
strategies recently cost participants 
perhaps $56 billion or more annually, 
the Department estimates.21 Among 
inferior strategies, it is likely that active 
trading aimed at timing the market 
generates more adverse results than 
failing to rebalance. Many mutual funds 
investors’ experience badly lags the 
performance of the funds they hold 
because they buy and sell shares too 
frequently and/or at the wrong times.22 
Investors often buy and sell in response 
to short-term past returns, and suffer as 
a result.23 Good advice is likely to

Holden & Michael Hadley, The Economics of 
Providing 401(k) Plans: Services, Fees and Expenses 
2006, Investment Company Institute Research 
Fundamentals, Volume 16, Number 4 (Sept. 2007). 
This estimate of excess expense does not take into 
account less visible expenses such as mutual funds’ 
internal transaction costs (including explicit 
brokerage commissions and implicit trading costs), 
which are sometimes larger than funds’ expense 
ratios (Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP, 
Fees and Revenue Sharing in Defined Contribution 
Retirement Plans (Dec. 6, 2007) (unpublished, on 
file with the Department of Labor); Jason Karceski

Mutual Funds, University of Florida Working Paper 
(2004), at http://thefloat.typepad.com/the_float/
files/2004_zag_study_on_mutual_fund_trading_
costs.pdf). 

19 Conversely, there is evidence that some higher 
than necessary expense currently is a direct result 
of what might be called bad advice, meaning certain 
marketing activities carried out by intermediaries 
such as brokers as well as direct consumer 
advertising by vendors of funds and competing 
financial products.

Investor Behavior in the Mutual Fund Industry: 

discourage market timing efforts and 
encourage rebalancing, thereby 
ameliorating adverse impacts from poor 
trading strategies. 
Inadequate Diversification 

Investors sometimes fail to diversify 

adequately and thereby assume 
uncompensated risk and suffer 
associated losses. For example, DC plan 
participants sometimes concentrate 
their assets excessively in stock of their 
employer.24 Relative to full 
diversification,25 employer stock 
investments recently cost DC plan 
participants perhaps $3 billion 26 
annually, the Department estimates.27 
Other lapses in diversification may 
involve omission from portfolios of 

Evidence from Gross Flows, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 966360 (Feb. 2007). 

24 See, e.g., Olivia S. Mitchell & Stephen P. Utkus, 
The Role of Company Stock in Defined Contribution 
Plans, National Bureau of Economic Research 
Working Paper W9250 (Oct. 2002); and Jeffrey R. 
Brown & Scott Weisbenner, Individual Account 
Investment Options and Portfolio Choice: 
Behavioral Lessons from 401(k) Plans, Social 
Science Research Network Abstract 631886 (Dec. 
2004). 

25 This comparison should be viewed as an outer 
bound. Full diversification of the same assets might 
not be feasible if companies are unwilling to alter 
the compensation mix in this way (see, e.g., Olivia 
S. Mitchell & Stephen P. Utkus, The Role of 
Company Stock in Defined Contribution Plans, 
National Bureau of Economic Research Working 
Paper W9250 (Oct. 2002)). It also neglects some 
potential tax benefits of employer stock investments 
that might offset losses from reduced diversification 
(see, e.g., Mukesh Bajaj et al., The NUA Benefit and 
Optimal Investment in Company Stock in 401(k) 
Accounts, Social Science Research Network 
Abstract 965808 (Feb. 2007)). 

26 Following findings reported in Lisa K. 

Meulbroek, Company Stock in Pension Plans: How 
Costly Is It?, Social Science Research Network 
Abstract 303782 (Mar. 2002), this estimate reflects 
losses amounting to 14 percent of the employer 
stock’s value, assuming 10 percent of DC plan assets 
are held in employer stock, the DC plan is one-half 
of total wealth, and the holding period is 10 years. 
For comparison, following findings reported in 
Krishna Ramaswamy, Company Stock and Pension 
Plan Diversification, in The Pension Challenge: Risk 
Transfers and Retirement Income Security 71, 71– 
88 (Olivia S. Mitchell & Kent Smetters eds., 2003), 
the annualized cost of an option to receive the 
higher of the return on a typical company stock or 
the return on a fully diversified equity portfolio 
over a three-year horizon would amount to 
approximately $24 billion, the Department 
estimates. This measure probably exaggerates the 
loss to participants, however, insofar as it would 
preserve for the participant the potential upside of 
a company stock that outperforms the market. 

27 These estimates neglect any behavioral impact 
full diversification might have on asset allocation. 
There is some evidence that investing in employer 
stock increases participants’ exposure to equity 
overall, which might increase average wealth (see, 
e.g., Jack L. Vanderhei, The Role of Company Stock 
in 401(k) Plans, Employee Benefit Research 
Institute T–133 Written Statement for the House 
Education and Workforce Committee,

Retirement Security (Feb. 2002), at http://

asset classes such as overseas equity or 
debt, small cap stocks, or real estate. 
Such lapses may sometimes reflect 
limited investment menus supplied by 
DC plans.28 Yet even where adequate 
choices are available and company stock 
is not a factor, investors sometimes fail 
to diversify adequately.29 Inadequate 
diversification other than excessive 
concentration in company stock 
recently cost participants perhaps $42 
billion annually, the Department 
estimates.30 Good advice should address 
over concentration in employer stock 
and other failures to properly diversify. 
Inappropriate Risk 

Investors who avoid the foregoing 

three mistakes might be said to invest 
efficiently, in the sense that they 
generally can expect the maximum 
possible return given their level risk. 
However, they may still be making a 
costly mistake: they may fail to calibrate 
the risk and return of their portfolio to 
match their own risk and return 
preferences. As a result, their 
investments may be too risky or too safe 
for their own tastes. The Department 
lacks a basis on which to estimate the 
magnitude of such mistakes, but 
believes they may be common and large. 
A diversified portfolio’s risk and return 
characteristics generally is determined 
by its allocation across asset classes. As 
noted above, there is ample evidence 
that participants’ asset allocation 
choices often are inconsistent with fixed 
or well behaved risk and return 
preferences. If participants’ true 
preferences are in fact fixed or well 
behaved, then observed asset 
allocations, which often appear to shift 
in response to seemingly irrelevant 
factors (or fail to shift in response to 
relevant ones), certainly entail large 
welfare losses.31 Good advice might 

28 See, e.g., Edwin J. Elton et al., The Adequacy 

of Investment Choices Offered By 401(k) Plans, 
Social Science Research Network Abstract 567122 
(Mar. 2004), which finds that menus are frequently 
inadequate, and Ning Tang and Olivia S. Mitchell,

Investment Choices in Defined Contribution 
Pension Plans, University of Michigan Retirement 
Research Center Working Paper WP 2008–176 (June 
2008), at http://www.mrrc.isr.umich.edu/ 
publications/papers/pdf/wp176.pdf, which finds 
that most menus are efficient. 

29 See, e.g., Laurent E. Calvet et al., Down or Out: 

Assessing the Welfare Costs of Household 
Investment Mistakes, Harvard Institute of Economic 
Research Discussion Paper No. 2107 (Feb. 2006). 
30 See id. This estimate assumes annual return 
decrements from inadequate diversification of 0.3 
percent of invested assets for investors that are 
already investing in risky assets (like stocks and 
mutual funds) and 3.3% for investors that are not 
yet investing in risky assets. The Department 
estimates that in the U.S. about 85% of investors 
include risky assets in their portfolios. 

31 The potential financial effects of changes in 

asset allocation hint at the likely magnitude of these 

help participants calibrate their asset 
allocations to match their true 
preferences. 
Excess Taxes 

It is likely that many households pay 

excess taxes as a result of disconnects 
between their investment and tax 
strategies. Households saving for 
retirement must decide not only what 
assets to hold, but also whether to locate 
these assets in taxable or tax-deferred 
accounts. For example, households may 
be able to maximize their expected after- 
tax wealth by first placing heavily taxed 
bonds in their tax-deferred account and 
then placing lightly taxed equities in 
their taxable account. A significant 
number of households do not follow 
this practice, however. By one estimate, 
to fully implement this practice in 1998, 
U.S. households would have had to 
relocate some $251 billion in assets.32 It 
is not clear, however, whether such 
households are in fact making 
investment mistakes. In practice, this 
simple asset location rule may fail to 
minimize taxes.33 As a result the 

welfare effects. The Department previously has 
estimated that movement of DC plan default 
investments from stand-alone, low-risk capital 
preservation instruments to diversified portfolios 
that include equities will improve investment 
results for a large majority of affected individuals, 
increasing aggregate account balances by an 
estimated $5 billion to $7 billion in 2034 (See 72 
FR 60,452, 60,466 (Oct. 24, 2007)). 

32 See, e.g., Daniel B. Bergstresser & James M. 

Poterba, Asset Allocation and Asset Location: 
Household Evidence from the Survey of Consumer 
Finances, Journal of Public Economics, Volume 88 
1893, 1893–1915 (2004). 

33 For example, tax-exempt municipal bonds are 

available, and actively managed equity mutual 
funds are not always tax-efficient (see, e.g., James 
M. Poterba et al., Asset Location for Retirement 
Savers, in Public Policies and Private Pensions 290, 
290–331 (John B. Shoven et al. eds., 2004); and John 
B. Shoven & Clemens Sialm, Asset Location in Tax- 
Deferred and Conventional Savings Accounts, 
Journal of Public Economics, Volume 88 (2003)). 
Using historical returns data and tax rate data for 
the period 1962–98, James M. Poterba et al., Asset 
Location for Retirement Savers, in Public Policies 
and Private Pensions 290, 290–331 (John B. Shoven 
et al. eds., 2004) find that when investing in 
actively managed mutual funds, and with the 
availability of tax-exempt bonds, households would 
have more after-tax wealth in most cases if they had 
first placed equities in the tax-deferred account.

Analysis of Tax-Efficiency, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 302824 (May 2002) describes how 
accessibility restrictions on assets in tax-deferred 
retirement accounts create a tension between 
making tax-efficient placements and the risk of 
having to make costly withdrawals in the event of 
a bad labor income shock. He presents empirical 
evidence that holding apparently tax-inefficient 
portfolios is related to accessibility restrictions and 
to precautionary motives. Lorenzo Garlappi & 
Jennifer C. Huang, Are Stocks Desirable in Tax- 
Deferred Accounts?, Journal of Public Economics, 
Volume 90 2257, 2257–2283 (July 2006) explain 
how a tax-deferred account essentially confers a tax 
subsidy onto its holdings. While the level of the tax

Department has no basis to estimate the 
magnitude of excess taxes that might 
derive from DC plan and IRA 
participants’ investment mistakes. In 
any event it is unclear whether or to 
what extent investment advisers would 
be positioned to provide advice on tax 
efficiency. 
Promoting Investment Advice 
Permissible Arrangements 

Federal law limits the variety of 

arrangements whereby participants may 
obtain investment advice. Specifically, 
ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code 
generally prohibit fiduciaries from 
dealing with DC plan or IRA assets in 
ways that advance their own interests. 
These provisions effectively preclude 
participants from obtaining advice 
under arrangements that are widely 
used by other investors. For example, 
under many common arrangements, the 
adviser may receive a commission or 
other consideration when the investor 
enters into a transaction pursuant to the 
advice. The adviser’s employer or an 
affiliate thereof may receive a sales load 
or other consideration in connection 
with the transaction. Stated generally, 
many common investment advice 
arrangements present financial advisers 
with opportunities to self deal. 
While generally prohibiting 

arrangements that present such 
opportunities, federal law also provides 
for conditional exemptions whereby 
otherwise prohibited transactions are 
permitted. Some exemptions are 
contained in the statute. The 
Department has authority to grant 
others. The conditions attached to such 
exemptions serve to mitigate the adverse 
effects of the conflicts of interest that are 
present and thereby protect participants’ 
interests. However, the Department 
invites suggestions for other safeguards 
against conflicts of interest that would 
be consistent with the goal of making 
quality advice more widely available. 
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 

opened the door to more types of 
investment advice arrangements by 
conditionally permitting arrangements 
where the fiduciary adviser or an 
affiliate thereof has a financial stake in 

subsidy may be maximized by first placing bonds 
in the tax-deferred account, this strategy may lead 
to a more volatile tax benefit. Risk-averse 
households may wish to smooth this volatility by 
holding a mix of equities and bonds in both tax- 
deferred and taxable accounts, as some are observed 
to do in practice. Robert M. Dammon et al., Optimal 
Asset Location and Allocation with Taxable and 
Tax-Deferred Investing, The Journal of Finance, 
Volume LIX, Number 3 999, 999–1037 (2004) find 
that even when tax-exempt bonds are available and 
even when there are liquidity shocks, for most 
investors it is best to put taxable bonds in the tax- 
deferred account and equity in the taxable account.

the advised participants’ investment 
decisions. The Department is proposing 
a regulation to further specify the PPA’s 
applicable conditions, together with a 
class exemption to establish alternative 
conditions under which such 
arrangements may operate. Table 1 
summarizes the effect of the PPA and 
this proposed class exemption on 
permissible investment advice 
arrangements. 

The Department calibrated this 

proposed regulation to in an effort to 
protect participants while promoting the 
affordability of investment advice 
arrangements operating pursuant to the 
PPA’s statutory exemptive relief, in 
order that such arrangements will 
proliferate and thrive, to the benefit of 
participants. 

The PPA’s relief (listed at B. in table 
1) is conditioned in part on audits. In 

order to promote the affordability of 
advice, this proposed regulation 
provides that audits may rely on a 
representative sample of similar 
arrangements. In order to protect 
participants, this proposed regulation 
requires that audit reports identifying 
noncompliance in connection with 
advice provided to IRA beneficiaries be 
furnished to the Department.

tity and over which the fiduciary adviser has no control.

B. Under PPA statutory exemption:

2. Subject to conditions listed above at 1., and advice is provided by a computer model that 
is certified by an independent expert and satisfies conditions including conformance to in-
vestment theories and objectivity.

C. Under proposed class exemption: 

1.  Subject  to  conditions  including  conformance  to  investment  theories,  authorization  by  a 

separate fiduciary, independent audits, disclosure, and recordkeeping.

2. Subject to conditions listed above at 1. and additional conditions including prudence and

No ................ No ................ Yes. 

N/a * ............. Yes ............... Yes.

Yes ............... Yes ............... Yes. 

* Under these arrangements, the investment advice is formulated exclusively by use of the computer model. 

The PPA’s statutory exemptive relief 

for investment advice arrangements that 
use computer models (listed at B.2. in 
table 1) is conditioned in part on 
independent expert certification of such 
models. The expert must meet 
requirements specified by the Secretary 
and certifications and renewals thereof 
must be completed in accordance with 
rules established by the Secretary. This 
proposed regulation establishes such 
requirements and rules. 

In advance of formulating these 

requirements and rules the Department 
invited and considered extensive public 
input on the nature, functions, and 
performance of existing models. The 
Department also closely examined and 
road tested some popular models with 
particular attention to the criteria set 
forth in section 408(g)(3)(B) of ERISA. 
The Department came to the conclusion 
that existing computer models can take 
into account various information about 
individuals, their preferences and 
available investment options and, in its 
limited attempt to examine whether 
recommendations provided were 
optimal, the Department did not find 
evidence of computer models 
recommending investment portfolios 
that have risk return profiles inferior to

any individual investment alternative 
available. 

On these bases the Department 

understands that models capable of 
satisfying the exemption’s conditions 
are various and evolving. The variety 
and evolution reflect healthy 
competition to develop superior 
products that deliver more value to 
participants. 

The Department sought to calibrate 

this proposed regulation to nurture such 
competition while keeping advice 
affordable and protecting participants’ 
interests. This proposed regulation 
consequently provides for transparency 
and procedural rigor but generally does 
not attempt to specify precise and fixed 
substantive standards. For example, 
pursuant to the proposed regulation the 
experts’ qualifications will be reviewed 
by a fiduciary, and each certification 
will be documented in detail. The 
proposed regulation also provides that 
models may be certified once for similar 
applications across multiple DC plans or 
IRAs, rather than separately for each 
individual application, thereby 
promoting affordability of arrangements 
using models. 

The Department likewise sought to 

calibrate this proposed class exemption 
to protect participants while promoting 
the affordability of investment advice 

arrangements operating pursuant to it, 
in order that such arrangements 
likewise will proliferate and thrive, to 
the benefit of participants. As detailed 
below, the proposed class exemption, by 
relaxing bars against arrangements that 
place fiduciary advisers in positions 
where they have potential conflicts of 
interest, will increase the variety of 
investment advice arrangements that are 
available and potentially lower the cost 
and promote the marketing of such 
arrangements, to the benefit of 
participants. Conditions attached to the 
proposed class exemption will mitigate 
the adverse impact of the conflicts and 
thereby ensure the quality of advice 
provided pursuant to it. 
Availability and Use 

Participants have always had the 

option of obtaining permissible 
investment advice services directly in 
the retail market. DC plan sponsors 
likewise have had the option of 
obtaining such services in the 
commercial market and making them 
available to plan participants and 
beneficiaries in connection with the 
plan. 

Prior to the 2006 enactment of the 

PPA, a substantial fraction of DC plan 
sponsors already made investment 
advice available to plan participants and

beneficiaries. Today, as the PPA’s 
implementation progresses, many more 
have begun providing or are gearing up 
to provide such advice. It is likely that 
40 percent or more of DC plan sponsors 
currently provide access to investment 
advice either on line, by phone, or in- 
person. Where offered, approximately 
25 percent of participants use advice. 
In-person advice seems to be offered by 
the most plan sponsors. On-line advice 
and to a lesser degree telephone advice 
are favored more by large sponsors. 
Smaller plan sponsors appear to offer 
advice generally and in-person advice in 
particular more frequently than larger 
plan sponsors.34 

Investment advice is also already used 

by a substantial fraction of IRA 
participants, the Department believes. A 
majority of IRA participants that invest 
in mutual funds purchase some or all of 
their funds via a professional financial 
adviser.35 Overall 60 percent of U.S. 
workers and retirees say they use the 
advice of a financial professional when 
making retirement savings and 
investment decisions; 40 percent say 
this advice was more helpful to them 
than alternatives.36 It is not clear how 
recently this advice was obtained, 

34 This assessment is based on the Department’s 
reading of Hewitt Associates LLC, Survey Findings: 
Hot Topics in Retirement, 2007 (2007); Profit 
Sharing/401(k) Council of America, 50th Annual 
Survey of Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plans (2007); 
and Deloitte Development LLC, Annual 401(k) 
Benchmarking Survey, 2005/2006 Edition (2006). In 
addition to investment advice, a majority of 
sponsors also provide one or more other types of 
support to participants’ investment decisions. Other 
types of support include providing general 
investment education via seminars or written 
materials, offering one-stop, pre-mixed investment 
alternatives such as lifestyle funds, and offering 
managed accounts. 

35 Eighty-two percent of mutual fund 

shareholders who hold funds outside of DC plans 
purchase some or all of their funds from a 
professional financial adviser such as a full-service 
broker, independent financial planner, bank or 
savings institution representative, insurance agent, 
or accountant (see, e.g., Victoria Leonard-Chambers 
& Michael Bogdan, Why Do Mutual Fund Investors 
Use Professional Financial Advisers?, Investment 
Company Institute Research Fundamentals, Volume 
16, Number 1 (April 2007)). Because families 
owning IRAs outnumber those owning pooled 
investment vehicles outside of retirement accounts 
(see, e.g., Brian K. Bucks et al., Recent Changes in 
U.S. Family Finances: Evidence from the 2001 and 
2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, Federal Reserve 
Bulletin 92 A1, A1–A38 (2006)), it is reasonable to 
conclude that a large majority of IRA beneficiaries 
who invest in mutual funds purchase them via such 
professionals. The Department has no basis to 
estimate the fraction of these beneficiaries that 
receive true investment advice from such 
professionals, however. It is possible that some 
make their purchase decisions without receiving 
any recommendation or material guidance from the 
professional making the sale. 

36 Alternatives including advice of peers, written 

plan materials, print media, television and radio, 
seminars, software, on-line information or advice, 
and retirement benefit statements were all less 
likely to be characterized as ‘‘most helpful.’’ 

however: In the same survey just 28 
percent say that in the past year they 
obtained investment advice from a 
professional financial adviser who was 
paid through fees or commissions.37 
The new statutory exemptive relief 

provided by the PPA is expected to 
increase the availability of advice, but it 
is too early to observe by how much.38 
The Department believes that absent 
this proposed class exemption some 
segments of the plan and participant 
market will lack adequate access to 
quality, affordable investment advice. 
Some potential fiduciary advisers will 
be deterred from entering the market by 
the complexity of advice arrangements 
that conform to the conditions of the 
PPA’s statutory exemptive relief.39 
Some plan sponsors and participants 
will be deterred by the cost of such 
arrangements,40 or by dissatisfaction 
with the types of advice arrangements 
that are available at lower costs, such as 
automated computer investment advice 
programs.41 As a result some DC plan 

37 See, e.g., Employee Benefit Research Institute, 

2007 Retirement Confidence Survey, Wave XVII, 
Posted Questionnaire (Jan. 2007). 

38 The statutory exemptive relief for investment 

advice provided by the PPA generally became 
effective for advice provided after December 31, 
2006. In February 2007 EBSA issued guidance on 
the new statutory exemptive relief for arrangements 
using fiduciary advisers whose affiliates’ revenue 
might vary depending on the fiduciary advisers’ 
fiduciary acts. It is likely that some such 
arrangements exist today, and that more will in the 
future. The PPA also provided relief for 
arrangements that provide advice via independently 
certified computer models. The PPA withheld this 
exemptive relief in connection with IRAs, however, 
unless and until the Department found and reported 
to Congress that a model satisfying certain criteria 
exists. Concurrent with issuance of this proposed 
class exemption, the Department has reached this 
finding and reported it to Congress. Therefore 
statutory relief for this latter type arrangement is 
just now being extended to IRAs. In addition, the 
PPA provides that the Department will by 
regulation specify the process by which computer 
models will be certified. Concurrent with issuance 
of this proposed class exemption, the Department 
is proposing such a regulation. Given this timing it 
is unlikely that many such latter type arrangements 
yet exist. 

39 Such complexity can include the need to enlist 

an adviser who is independent of or merely 
affiliated with the plan’s or IRA’s investment 
manager, in order to avoid direct exposure of the 
adviser to potential conflicts. 

40 As discussed below, arrangements that avoid 

potential conflicts may entail higher or more visible 
costs. 

41 In one survey of DC plan sponsors, among 

those offering investment advice, ‘‘access to 
financial counselors in person’’ was rated most 
effective, followed by ‘‘access to financial 
counselors via telephone.’’ ‘‘Web-based’’ advice 
received the lowest effectiveness ratings (see, e.g., 
Deloitte Development LLC, Annual 401(k) 
Benchmarking Survey, 2005/2006 Edition (2006)). 
This finding is corroborated by another survey, in 
which in-person advice appears to be used by 
participants more often than advice delivered via 
the Internet (see, e.g., Profit Sharing/401(k) Council 
of America, Investment Advice Survey 2001 (2001)).

sponsors will not offer advice, and 
where it is offered some participants 
will not use it.42 IRA beneficiaries may 
face similar obstacles to obtaining 
affordable, quality investment advice. 

From the point of view of DC plan 
sponsors, the PPA and this proposed 
class exemption could help relieve 
certain concerns that have impeded 
some from providing investment advice 
in the past. A few years prior to the 
enactment of the PPA less than one in 
four surveyed DC plan sponsors 
provided advice, according to one 
survey.43 Those not providing advice 
were asked to cite reasons and rate the 
reasons’ importance on a 0-to-5 scale. 
Two reasons cited by large majorities 
and rated moderately important might 
be ameliorated by this proposed class 
exemption: ‘‘Fiduciary concern about 
ensuring that the advice provider has no 
conflict of interest’’ 44 (cited by 84 
percent and rated 3.1) and ‘‘cost of 
providing advice’’ 45 (cited by 69 
percent and rated 2.0).46 In another pre- 
PPA survey 35 percent of DC plan 
sponsors not offering advice cited cost 
as a reason.47 

From the point of view of prospective 

fiduciary advisers whose business 
models involve conflicts—e.g., who are 
compensated by the companies that 
manufacture, manage, and/or trade the 
investment products that they 
recommend—the PPA and this 
proposed class exemption grant 
conditional access to a very large and 

42 Where investment advice is available to DC 

plan participants, only one in four uses it, 
according to one plan sponsor survey (see, e.g., 
Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, 50th 
Annual Survey of Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plans 
(2007)). On-line advice appeals more to higher- 
salaried, full-time workers (see, e.g., Julie Agnew, 
Personalized Retirement Advice and Managed 
Accounts: Who Uses Them and How Does Advice 
Affect Behavior in 401(k) Plans?, Center for 
Retirement Research Working Paper 2006–9 (2006)). 
In one survey, two-thirds of workers and 85 percent 
of retirees expressed discomfort with ‘‘obtaining 
advice from financial professionals on-line. This 
raises the possibility that many participants, 
perhaps especially lower-paid, part-time 
participants, may be underserved if the regulatory 
environment excessively favors on-line advice. 
43 See, e.g., Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of 

America, Investment Advice Survey 2001 (2001). 

44 Both the PPA and this proposed class 

exemption extend conditional relief from ERISA’s 
prohibited transaction provisions, but neither 
relieves plan fiduciaries of their general obligations 
under ERISA. 

45 The cost of advice is discussed further 

immediately below. 

46 Other fiduciary concerns, cited more frequently 
and rated more important, are not addressed by this 
proposed class exemption. 

47 See, e.g., Deloitte Development LLC, Annual 
401(k) Benchmarking Survey, 2005/2006 Edition 
(2006).

fast growing new market segment.48 
These advisers might be in a position to 
offer their services at low or no direct 
cost to the companies’ DC plan and IRA 
clients (relying instead on compensation 
from the companies). They might 
market their services to the companies’ 
clients more actively than have 
independent advisers historically. 

For purposes of this impact 

assessment, the Department anticipates 
that owing to the statutory exemptive 
relief provided by the PPA, advice of 
some type (on-line, telephone and/or in 
person) will soon be available to 
perhaps one-half of DC plan 
participants, with in-person advice 
available to perhaps one in four. This 
proposed class exemption will boost 
these fractions to perhaps 60 percent 
and 35 percent, respectively. The 
Department’s assumptions are 
summarized in Table 2.49

The effect of investment advice 

depends not merely on its availability 
but on its use by DC plan and IRA 
participants. Do the participants seek 
advice, and if so do they follow it? 
According to one survey, among DC 
plan participants offered investment 
advice, approximately one in four uses 
it. There is some evidence that 
historically in-person advice has 
achieved higher use rates than on-line 
advice, with on-line advice appealing 
more to higher-income participants.50 In 
another survey large fractions of 
workers say they would be very likely 
(19 percent) or somewhat likely (35 
percent) to take advantage of advice 
provided by the company that manages 
their employer’s DC plan. Of these, two- 
thirds said they would implement only 

48 Combined participant directed DC plan and 

IRA assets exceed $7 trillion. 

49 The Department based its assumptions on its 

reading of Hewitt Associates LLC, Survey Findings: 
Hot Topics in Retirement, 2007 (2007); Profit 
Sharing/401(k) Council of America, 50th Annual 
Survey of Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plans (2007); 
and Deloitte Development LLC, Annual 401(k)

Uses Them and How Does Advice Affect Behavior

those recommendations that were in 
line with their own ideas; 21 percent 
said they would implement all of the 
recommendations as long as they 
trusted the source.51 In a subsequent 
survey, among those obtaining 
investment advice, 36 percent say they 
implemented ‘‘all’’ of the advice, 58 
percent ‘‘some,’’ and just 5 percent 
‘‘none.’’ 52 

The PPA and this proposed class 

exemption together could boost DC plan 
participants’ use of advice where 
offered, in at least two ways. First, 
because it appears that in-person advice 
arrangements are more heavily used 
than automated computer advice 
programs, wider availability of in- 
person advice programs wherein 
advisers can exercise discretion in 
formulating personalized advice (rather 
than merely communicate the 
recommendations of a computer 
model)—a likely consequence of this 
proposed class exemption—might be 
expected to boost use rates. The shift 
anticipated by the Department 
(discussed immediately above) would 
increase the use rate slightly from 25 
percent to 26 percent.53 Second, if the 
cost of advice falls, participants who 
must pay for advice will become more 
inclined to use it. However, historically 
employers have usually paid directly for 
advice, or passed the cost to all 
participants whether they use advice or 
not,54 and as explained below it is 
unclear by how much the cost of advice 
will fall. Therefore for purposes of this 
impact assessment the Department did 
not take into account any cost-driven 
increase in use of advice by DC plan 
participants, but assumed that this 
proposed class exemption will increase 
the fraction of DC plan participants 
using advice where available from 25 
percent to 26 percent.55 Given the 

51 See, e.g., Employee Benefit Research Institute, 

2007 Retirement Confidence Survey, Wave XVII, 
Posted Questionnaire (Jan. 2007). In practice this 
might translate into a high rate of compliance with 
recommendations, if recommendations turn out not 
to diverge too much from participants’ own ideas. 
52 See, e.g., Employee Benefit Research Institute, 
2008 Retirement Confidence Survey, Wave XVIII, 
Posted Questionnaire (Jan. 2008). 

53 This assumes that the use rate for where in 
person advice is available is approximately 50 
percent higher (30 percent) as where only on-line 
or telephone advice is available (20 percent) (see, 
e.g., Employee Benefit Research Institute, 2007 
Retirement Confidence Survey, Wave XVII, Posted 
Questionnaire (Jan. 2007)). 

54 See, e.g., Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of 

America, Investment Advice Survey 2001 (2001). 
55 One survey found that 64 percent of workers 

already use professional financial advice when 
making retirement savings and investment 
decisions, and that 54 percent are very or somewhat 
likely to use advice if offered by their employer in 
connection with a DC plan (see, e.g., Employee 
Benefit Research Institute, 2007 Retirement 

Department’s assumptions regarding 
availability of advice to DC plan 
participants, this translates into an 
increase in the incidence of advice due 
to this proposed class exemption from 
10 percent to 16 percent. 

The PPA and this proposed class 

exemption could also boost IRA 
participants’ use of advice. As noted 
above, advisers doing business pursuant 
to this class exemption are likely to 
actively market advice services to IRA 
participants and to offer them reduced 
prices for such services. The reduced 
prices will reflect both the availability 
to advisers of other compensation and 
possible cost saving in the production 
and delivery of advice. Advisers doing 
business pursuant to this proposed class 
exemption may thereby attract business 
both from IRA participants who 
otherwise would be without advice and 
from IRA participants who otherwise 
would obtain advice through an 
arrangement that does not require the 
relief provided by this proposed class 
exemption. IRA participants who would 
otherwise be without advice may obtain 
advice in response to such marketing 
and pricing activity because the activity 
reduces their search cost to find and 
select an adviser, and/or because the 
reduced price falls below their 
reservation price. Likewise, IRA 
participants who would otherwise have 
obtained advice via some other 
arrangement may switch to an 
arrangement pursuant to the PPA or this 
proposed class exemption (and may 
increase the amount of advice services 
they use) because the advisers’ 
marketing activity broadens their search 
and/or in pursuit of lower prices. 

In proposing this class exemption the 

Department considered carefully the 
importance of transparency in pricing. 
Participants’ decisions whether and 
where to obtain advice should be well 
informed with respect to the cost 
associated with alternative 
arrangements. As a condition of this 
proposed class exemption an adviser 
must disclose to the participant certain 
information regarding other revenue 
sources. This condition is intended to 
enable participants to decide whether, 
where, and how much advice to obtain, 
in light of the associated direct and 
indirect costs to them.56 Therefore the 

Confidence Survey, Wave XVII, Posted 
Questionnaire (Jan. 2007)). This seems to suggest a 
higher baseline rate of advice use than assumed 
here. However, because the latter fraction is smaller 
than the former, it is unclear whether this suggests 
that this proposed class exemption would increase 
DC plan participants’ use of advice by more or less 
than assumed here.

adequately compare the prices offered by advisers

Department intends that any cost-driven 
increase in use of advice by IRA 
participants will be driven by overall 
cost decreases and not solely by direct 
price reductions. 

As noted above there is evidence that 

a large fraction of IRA participants 
already use advice. For purposes of this 
assessment the Department assumes that 
as a result of the PPA and this proposed 

class exemption the proportion of IRA 
beneficiaries using advice will increase 
from one-third to two-thirds. The 
Department’s assumptions regarding use 
of advice are summarized in table 3.57

It seems likely that in practice a large 
proportion of participants who receive 
advice will follow that advice either in 
whole or in part. This is especially 
likely if the advice turns out to be 
broadly in line with the participants’ 
own thinking. Nonetheless, some advice 
will not be followed, and as a result 
some investment errors will not be 
corrected. For purposes of this analysis, 
the Department has assumed that 
advised participants make investment 
errors at one-half the rate of unadvised 
participants. The remaining errors 
reflect participant failures to follow 
advice (together with possible flaws in 
some advice, as discussed immediately 
below). 
Cost 

As noted above the PPA and this 

proposed class exemption are expected 
to make advice available to participants 

doing business pursuant to this exemption with 
those offered by other advisers such as those 
offering their services for a flat fee. 

57 These assumptions are based on the 

Department’s reading of Employee Benefit Research 
Institute, 2007 Retirement Confidence Survey, Wave 
XVII, Posted Questionnaire (Jan. 2007); Hewitt 
Associates LLC, Survey Findings: Hot Topics in 
Retirement, 2007 (2007); Profit Sharing/401(k) 
Council of America, 50th Annual Survey of Profit 
Sharing and 401(k) Plans (2007); and Deloitte 
Development LLC, Annual 401(k) Benchmarking 
Survey, 2005/2006 Edition (2006). There are a 
number of reasons to believe that use of advice will 
be higher among IRA beneficiaries than DC plan 
participants. The aforementioned survey reports, 
read together, generally support this conclusion. In 
addition, relative to IRA beneficiaries, DC 
participants may have less need for advice and/or 
easier access to alternative forms of support for 
their investment decisions. DC plan participants’ 
choice is usually confined to a limited menu 
selected by a plan fiduciary, and the menu may 
include one-stop alternatives such as target date 
funds that may mitigate the need for advice. Their 
plan or employer may provide general financial and 
investment education in the form of printed 
material or seminars. They often make initial 
investment decisions (sometimes by default) before 
contributing to the plan so the decisions’ impact 
may seem small. Finally, the availability of advice 
in connection with the plan is intermediated by the 
plan sponsor and fiduciary. In contrast, IRA 
beneficiaries generally have wider choice and are 

at a lower direct price, because advisers 
will be able to rely on alternative 
revenue sources to compensate their 
efforts. More importantly, however, the 
Department believes that the total cost 
of the advice to participants will be 
reduced. Bars against transactions 
wherein fiduciary advisers’ and 
participants’ interests may conflict carry 
costs. Faced with such bars advisers 
may forgo certain potential economies 
of scale in production and distribution 
of financial services that would derive 
from more vertical and horizontal 
integration.58 And to avoid such 
conflicts they must carefully monitor 
and calibrate their relationships and 
compensation arrangements, or incur 
the opportunity cost associated with 
exclusive reliance on level fees. The 
Department therefore expects the PPA 
and this proposed class exemption to 
produce cost savings by harnessing 

economies of scale and by reducing 
compliance burdens. The Department is 
unaware of any available empirical basis 
on which to determine whether or by 
how much costs might be reduced, 
however. 
Quality 

The effect of investment advice also 

depends on its quality. Good advice can 
reduce investment errors, steering 
investors away from higher than 
necessary expenses and toward optimal 
trading strategies, broad diversification, 
and asset allocations consistent with the 
investors’ tastes for risk and return. The 
Department believes that, although there 
is no universally accepted single and 
complete theory of optimal investing, 
and although there is some evidence of 
lapses in the quality investment 
advice,59 professional advisers’ 

more likely to be without employer-provided 
support for their decisions. Decision points may 
more often occur when account balances are large, 
such as when rolling a large DC plan balance into 
an IRA or when retiring. Finally, the availability of 
advice to IRA beneficiaries is not intermediated by 
an employer—rather IRA beneficiaries interface 
directly with the retail market and will thereby be 
more directly affected by the exemptive relief 
provided by the PPA and by this proposed class 
exemption. For all of these reasons IRA 
beneficiaries may use advice more frequently than 
DC plan participants. 

58 For example, an adviser employed by an asset 
manager can share the manager’s research instead 
of buying or producing such research 
independently. 

59 There is no single, complete, universally 

accepted theory of optimal investment. Instead 
there are competing and evolving theories which 
have much in common (what might be called 
‘‘generally accepted’’ theories) but also important 
differences (see, e.g., Martin Wallmeier & Florian 
Zainhofer, How to Invest Over the Life Cycle: a 
Review, Social Science Research Network Abstract 
951167 (Dec. 2006); and Deloitte Financial 
Advisory Services LLP, Generally Accepted 
Investment Theories (July 11, 2007) (unpublished 
memorandum, on file with the Department of 
Labor)). In practice this means that different experts 
may give different advice; often the differences will 
be small but occasionally they might be large. 

There is some evidence of lapses in the quality 
of investment advice. Investment advisers’ advice 

does not always conform to generally accepted 
investment theories. For example, they sometimes 
neglect investors’ debt, or exhibit ‘‘home bias’’ 
toward domestic investment. Home bias may be 
larger in advice given to more risk averse investors; 
this conflicts with theory insofar as home bias 
reduces diversification and therefore increases risk. 
Investment advisers in some sense have two 
functions: to provide investment advice and to 
provide investor advice. The former ought to 
conform to financial theories, while the latter 
involves helping investors overcome behavioral 
biases and errors. Together these functions may 
result in a nuanced balance between what the 
investor theoretically ‘‘should’’ choose and what 
the investor is comfortable choosing (see, e.g., Elisa 
Cavezzali & Ugo Rigoni, Investor Profile and Asset 
Allocation Advice, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 966178 (Feb. 2007)). Some advice 
computer models and educational material may 
furnish misleading information regarding risk and 
consequently may do harm (see, e.g., Zvi Bodie, An 
Analysis of Investment Advice to Retirement Plan 
Participants, in The Pension Challenge: Risk 
Transfers and Retirement Income Security 19, 19– 
32 (Olivia S. Mitchell & Kent Smetters eds., 2003)). 
Advice computer models generally fail to 
coordinate financial investments with financial 
risks associated with individuals’ jobs, homes, and 
health (see, e.g., John Ameriks & Douglas Fore, 
Financial Planning: On the Issue of Advice, Benefits 
Quarterly, Fourth Quarter 6, 6–14 (2002)). While it 
is widely agreed that such coordination is 
important, theories about how this should be done

recommendations are likely to be 
superior to unadvised participants’ 
investment practices.60 It is therefore 
likely that participants who obtain and 
follow advice, including advice 
provided pursuant to the PPA or this 
proposed class exemption and advice 
provided under alternative permissible 
arrangements, will substantially reduce 
their investment mistakes and thereby 
derive substantial financial benefits and 
improve their welfare. 

In its effort to ensure the quality of 

advice, the Department carefully 
considered the substantial risks 
attendant to opportunities for self- 
dealing that may exist among fiduciary 
advisers doing business pursuant to the 
PPA or this proposed class exemption. 
There is evidence that advisers 
sometimes seize such opportunities and 
thereby reap profit at investors’ 
expense.61 The provisions of this 

continue to evolve (see, e.g., Gu¨ nter Franke et al., 
Non-Market Wealth, Background Risk and Portfolio 
Choice, Social Science Research Network Abstract 
968096 (Mar. 2007)). Typical advice as reflected in 
target-date funds conforms to some financial 
theories but conflicts with others (see, e.g., Luis M. 
Viceira, Life-Cycle Funds, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 988362 (May 2007)). 

60 Rene Fischer & Ralf Gerhardt, Investment 

Mistakes of Individual Investors and the Impact of 
Financial Advice, Science Research Network 
Abstract 1009196 (Aug. 2007) ‘‘present financial 
advice as (potentially) correcting’’ a variety of 
investment mistakes that left uncorrected ‘‘lead to 
considerable welfare losses.’’ 

61 These risks consist of the possibility that some 

advisers will pursue profit by dispensing advice 
that increases their own revenue at the expense of 
participants’ interests. 

Consideration of these risks is especially 

important because advice pursuant to this proposed 
class exemption, while extending to many 
participants who otherwise would invest without 
guidance or support, may also extend to many 
others who absent this class exemption would have 
benefited from alternative forms of support for their 
investment decisions, such as alternative 
permissible advice arrangements, target-date funds, 
managed accounts, or automatic rebalancing. 
In considering these risks the Department 

devoted separate attention to the application of this 
proposed class exemption to IRAs. In contrast to DC 
plan participants, IRA participants may be more 
vulnerable to risks attendant to conflicts of interest 
insofar as they: (1) May include more retirees, who 
may be in greater need of advice, but who also may 
be more vulnerable to abusive practices (see, e.g., 
Phyllis C. Borzi & Martha Priddy Patterson, 
Regulating Markets for Retirement Payouts: 
Solvency, Supervision and Credibility, Pension 
Research Council Working Paper PRC WP2007–21 
(Sept. 2007)); (2) are not represented by a plan 
fiduciary, independent of the adviser and 
connected to their interests via an employment 
relationship, who selects and monitors the advice 
arrangement and pre-screens the menu of 
investment options for quality; and (3) may not, 
under the conditions of this proposed class 
exemption, have the benefit of specific advice 
provided by an independent or independently- 
certified computer model to compare with (and 
possibly follow in lieu of) advice delivered 
pursuant to the proposed class exemption. In 
addition, while advisers to DC plan participants are 
subject to standards of fiduciary conduct and

attendant liability under Title I of ERISA, advisers 
to IRA beneficiaries are not. Finally, the 
Department’s authority to enforce the conditions of 
this proposed exemption generally extends only to 
DC plans and not to IRAs. On the other hand, IRA 
beneficiaries’ vulnerability to risks attendant to 
conflicts of interest may be mitigated by their 
ability to make rational and well informed 
purchases in a vibrant, competitive market for 
investment advice and other financial products and 
services in which some vendors will offer 
unconflicted advice. 

The Department believes that absent effective 

controls conflicts can sometimes bias advice, 
although it is unclear how much or in exactly what 
ways. Biased advice may be less beneficial to 
investors than unbiased advice, or possibly even 
harmful in some cases. 

There is a theoretical basis to believe that 

investors may be harmed (or may benefit less) 
where managers pay intermediary advisers for 
inflows, and that such payments may increase the 
role of intermediaries (fewer investors may invest 
directly) (see, e.g., Neal M. Stoughton et al., 
Intermediated Investment Management, Social 
Science Research Network Abstract 966255 (Mar. 
2007)). This suggests that advisers whose fees are 
not level relative to their clients’ investment 
elections may give biased advice that enriches 
managers at investors’ expense (the motivation for 
and potential to profit from conflicts and bias may 
attach more to the manager who compensates the 
adviser than to the adviser). It also suggests that 
advisers doing business pursuant to this proposed 
class exemption might displace alternative forms of 
investment decision support. 

According to one empirical study, ‘‘there exists 

conflict of interests between load fund investors 
and brokers and financial advisers: brokers and 
financial advisers apparently serve their own 
interests by guiding investors into funds with 
higher loads, which generate higher income to the 
brokers and financial advisers but increase the 
expenses of investors.’’ High load funds have larger 
inflows than low load funds with otherwise similar 
performance. Recent increases in fund loads suggest 
that funds are seeking favor from brokers and 
advisers (see, e.g., Xinge Zhao, The Role of Brokers 
and Financial Advisors Behind Investment Into 
Load Funds, China Europe International Business 
School Working Paper (Dec. 2005), at http:// 
www.ceibs.edu/faculty/zxinge/brokerrole-zhao.pdf). 
Another study reaches similar conclusions. 
‘‘Relative to direct-sold funds, broker-sold funds 
deliver lower risk-adjusted returns, even before 
subtracting distribution costs. * * * Further, 
broker-sold funds exhibit no more skill at aggregate- 
level asset allocation than do funds sold through 
the direct channel.’’ Even before accounting for the 
higher distribution expenses, the underperformance 
cost investors $4.6 billion in 2004. Brokers devote 
more effort to selling funds that generate more 
revenue for them (see Daniel B. Bergstresser et al., 
Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Brokers in the 
Mutual Fund Industry, forthcoming in The Review 
of Financial Studies). 

Yet another study finds that ‘‘investors who 

transact through investment professionals that are 
compensated through conventional distribution 
channels incur substantially poorer timing 
performance than investors who purchase pure no 
load funds.’’ The underperformance amounts to 
approximately 100 or 150 basis points (see, e.g., 
Mercer Bullard et al., Investor Timing and Fund 
Distribution Channels, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 1070545 (Dec. 2007)). 

Some other studies are less conclusive. For 

example, one finds that captive brokers add more 
value for investors in purchasing funds, while 
unaffiliated brokers add the most value in 
redeeming them. Direct, no-load investors’ 
redemptions are the least sensitive to performance. 
This study also finds that higher payments from 
fund companies to unaffiliated brokers buys some 

proposed regulation and conditions 
attached to this proposed class 
exemption are intended to guard against 
these risks while keeping advice 
affordable.62 

For purposes of this analysis, the 

Department has assumed that advised 
participants make investment errors at 
one-half the rate of unadvised 
participants. The remaining errors 
reflect possible flaws in some advice 
(together with participant failures to 
follow advice, discussed immediately 
above).63 Additionally for purposes of 
this analysis the Department assumes 
that all permissible advice arrangements 
(including those operating pursuant to 
exemptive relief provided by the PPA 
and those operating pursuant to this 
proposed class exemption) deliver 

inflows for funds (see, e.g., Susan Christoffersen et 
al., The Economics of Mutual-Fund Brokerage: 
Evidence from the Cross Section of Investment 
Channels, Social Science Research Network 
Abstract 687522 (Dec. 2005)). 

62 The Department has no basis to estimate how 
much risk might remain. However the Department 
notes that the safeguards associated with the PPA 
and this class exemption are likely to be stronger 
than those associated with available research 
studies, cited above, that quantify substantial losses 
to investors. First, advisers to DC plan participants 
are subject to ERISA’s fiduciary standards. Second, 
the PPA and this class exemption provide 
substantive conditions including unbiasedness, 
together with procedural protections such as 
provision of advice generated by computer models 
that are certified by independent experts, 
documentation of bases for advice, and audits of 
investment advice programs’ conformance to 
applicable substantive conditions. Such protections 
generally are not provided in other U.S. contexts. 
For a discussion of protections applicable where 
advice is delivered by investment advisers or 
brokers to investors outside of IRAs and ERISA- 
covered retirement plans, see Angela A. Hung et al., 
Investor and Industry Perspectives on Investment 
Advisers and Broker-Dealers, RAND Corporation 
Technical Report (2008), at http://www.sec.gov/ 
news/press/2008/2008–1_randiabdreport.pdf. 
63 Whether advice corrects errors depends on 
whether the advice is followed and whether it is 
good. There is reason to believe that many people 
receiving advice will follow it. In a 2008 survey, 
among those obtaining investment advice, 36 
percent say they implemented ‘‘all’’ of the advice, 
58 percent ‘‘some,’’ and just 5 percent ‘‘none’’ 
(Employee Benefit Research Institute, 2008 
Retirement Confidence Survey, Wave XVII, Posted 
Questionnaire (Jan. 2008)). There is also reason to 
believe that good advice will be available. 
According to Bluethgen, et al., High-Quality 
Financial Advice Wanted!, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 1102445 (Feb. 2008), ‘‘There is a 
high degree of heterogeneity in quality among 
financial advisors * * * the extent to which 
advisors receive compensation in the form of fixed 
fees instead of sales commissions as well as the 
extent to which advisors exhibit a high degree of 
rationality in decision making are predictive of 
high-quality financial advice.’’ According to 
Bluethgen, et al., Financial Advice and Individual 
Investors’ Portfolios, Social Science Research 
Network Abstract 968197 (Mar. 2008), ‘‘advice 
enhances portfolio diversification, makes investor 
portfolios more congruent with predefined model 
portfolios, and increases investors’ fees and 
expenses. Our empirical evidence is broadly in line 
with honest financial advice.’’

advice of similar quality and 
effectiveness. 
Benefits 

The Department expects the PPA and 
this proposed class exemption to reduce 
investment errors to the benefit of 
participants. As noted above, prior to 

implementation of the PPA, investment 
mistakes cost participants $109 billion 
or more annually. Increased use of 
investment advice under the PPA will 
reduce such mistakes by $7 billion, and 
this proposed class exemption will 
reduce them by another $7 billion, the 
Department estimates. Altogether after 

implementation of this proposed class 
exemption, use of investment advice by 
DC plan and IRA participants will 
eliminate $29 billion worth of 
investment errors annually. The 
Department’s estimates of investment 
errors and reductions from investment 
advice are summarized in table 4.

Costs 

Participant gains from investment 

advice must be weighed against the cost 
of that advice. Different types of advice 
may come with different costs. For 
example, advice generated by an 
automated computer program may be 

less costly than advice provided by a 
personal adviser. For purposes of this 
analysis the Department assumed that in 
the context of a DC plan, computer 
generated advice costs 10 basis points 
annually, while adviser provided advice 
costs 20 basis points. In connection with 
an IRA the corresponding assumptions 

are 15 and 30 basis points. These 
assumptions are reasonable in light of 
information available to the Department 
about the cost of various existing advice 
arrangements. On this basis the 
Department estimates the cost of advice 
as summarized in table 5.64

Alternatives 

In formulating this proposed 
regulation and proposed class 
exemption, the Department considered 
several alternative approaches. 
Specific Substantive Standards for 
Model Certification 

This proposed regulation provides 
mostly procedural standards for the 
certification of computer models 
pursuant to PPA’s statutory exemptive 
relief. In crafting these provisions the 
Department carefully considered 
whether to establish specific substantive 
standards as well. 

Computer models are evolving, driven 

by advances in information technology 
and financial theories, and by market 
competition. A recipe for testing the 

robustness of one current technology 
might not be effective when applied to 
a future technology. Ongoing 
refinements and revisions to financial 
theories, the product of healthy 
competition among ideas, would soon 
belie any specification of generally 
accepted theory that might be enshrined 
in regulation. The Department therefore 
believes that a substantive standard 
generally would not serve to protect 
participants but instead might diminish 
the benefits of the PPA’s relief for 
arrangements using models. However, 
the Department invites comments on the 
advantages and disadvantages of a more 
substantive standard than what is 
proposed, and asks for suggestions for 
what a more substantive standard might 
include. 

Deferring Action on Class Exemption 

The Department considered deferring 

proposing a class exemption for a year 
or more in order to observe the market 
impact of the exemptive relief provided 
by the PPA. This might have provided 
fuller information on the degree to 
which some market segments would 
remain underserved by advice and on 
the barriers responsible for such 
ongoing under service, and thereby 
assisted the Department’s effort to 
determine whether and how to provide 
additional exemptive relief. 

However, the Department is 

concerned that deferring action might 
delay the proliferation of advice and 
prolong correctable investment errors 
and believes that the need for additional 
exemptive relief is already adequately 

64 The Department notes that costs probably often 

will not be distributed across advised participants 
in proportion to the size of their accounts. Rather, 
it is likely that some costs of providing advice are 
fixed relative to account size, so the cost borne by 

small account holders probably will be larger in 
relation to account size than that borne by large 
account holders. The average estimates reported in 
table 4 are dollar weighted. For the average 
participant, the basis point cost will be higher than 

this dollar weighted average, and the amount by 
which investment errors are reduced per dollar of 
advice will be lower.

clear. The exemptive relief provided by 
the PPA does not embrace business 
models that occupy large parts of the 
non-IRA retail market,65 and therefore 
may leave major segments of the DC 
plan and IRA markets underserved. In 
addition, by excluding popular business 
models, the PPA’s exemptive relief by 
itself would tilt the playing field in 
favor of other business models, which 
may sometimes be more expensive or 
less beneficial. This raises the 
possibility that some segments of the 
market would be inefficiently served. 
This proposed class exemption will 
level the playing field for competing 
business models and thereby promote 
efficiency in the market for investment 
advice. 
Level Fee Condition 

The PPA provides conditional 

exemptive relief for advice 
arrangements wherein the revenue of a 
fiduciary adviser’s affiliates varies on 
the basis of advised participants’ 
investment decisions, but not to 
arrangements wherein the revenue of 
the fiduciary adviser itself so varies. 
This proposed class exemption extends 
conditional relief to the latter. 

The Department considered including 

as a mandatory condition of this 
proposed class exemption a requirement 
that the compensation received by the 
person providing the advice on behalf of 
the fiduciary adviser does not vary on 
the basis of participants’ investment 
decisions. Such a condition might ease 
enforcement of the exemption’s 
conditions, and might reduce the risks 
attendant to conflicts of interest that 

may exist among advisers doing 
business pursuant to the proposed class 
exemption. But it also would exclude 
from exemptive relief popular business 
models that are well established in the 
non-IRA retail market and that operate 
without similar compensation 
requirements, and therefore might 
unduly impair the availability of advice. 
Therefore Department elected to make 
this ‘‘level fee’’ condition 66 one of two 
alternative conditions,67 thereby 
allowing the person’s compensation to 
vary as long as the other condition is 
met. The other condition provides 
alternative protections against the risks 
attendant to conflicts of interest. 
Model Generated Advice for IRA 
Beneficiaries 

The Department considered including 

as part of the immediately 
aforementioned alternative condition a 
requirement that IRA beneficiaries 
always be provided with specific, model 
generated investment recommendations, 
similar to those which under the 
condition must be provided to DC plan 
participants.68 However the Department 
believes that such a requirement 
sometimes might be neither practical 
nor effective as applied to IRAs. It might 
not be practical because, while such 
models exist, their availability, 
affordability and effectiveness are not 
yet proven in all segments of the IRA 
market. It might not be effective because 
the wide range of investment options 
open to most IRA beneficiaries could 
make comparisons of model generated 
advice with the advisers’ 
recommendations difficult for 

beneficiaries. Therefore the conditions 
of this proposed class exemption allow 
that IRA beneficiaries may under certain 
circumstances be provided with 
educational material or 
recommendations on asset allocation 
across asset classes rather than with 
specific, model generated investment 
recommendations.69 
Uncertainty 

The Department is highly confident in 
its conclusion that investment errors are 
common and often large, producing 
large avoidable losses (including 
foregone earnings) for participants. It is 
also confident that participants can 
reduce errors substantially by obtaining 
and following good advice. While the 
precise magnitude of the errors and 
potential reductions therein are 
uncertain,70 there is ample evidence 
that that magnitude is large. 

The Department is also confident that 

this proposed class exemption, by 
relaxing rules governing arrangements 
under which advice can be delivered, 
will promote wider use of advice. 
However, the Department is uncertain to 
what extent advice will reach 
participants and to what extent advice 
that does reach them will reduce errors. 
To illustrate that uncertainty, the 
Department conducted sensitivity tests 
of how its estimates of the reduction in 
investment errors attributable to the 
PPA and this proposed class exemption 
would change in response to alternative 
assumptions regarding the availability, 
use, and quality of advice. Table 6 
summarizes the results of these tests.

69 See paragraph (e)(2). 
70 The incidence and magnitude of investment 
errors is uncertain. Because errors are generally 
measured with reference to some optimal 
benchmark, the evolving character of investment 
theory contributes to this uncertainty. For a given 
level of incidence and effectiveness of advice, the 
reduction in errors will be proportionate to the 
errors reduced. The Department did not attempt to 
estimate the magnitude of losses from inappropriate 
risk or excess taxes, so its estimate of this proposed 
class exemption’s impact omit potential reductions 
in such errors. As noted above, the Department’s 

estimate of higher than necessary expenses is 
conservative in light of referenced literature and 
omits certain less visible expenses such as mutual 
funds’ internal transaction costs. Its estimates of 
losses from poor trading strategies and inadequate 
diversification are moderate, if not conservative, 
taking account of the losses that were measured in 
the referenced studies. The Department believes 
that the combined magnitude of investment errors, 
and therefore of the reduction in such errors that 
can be expected from wider use of advice, is at least 
as large as reported here, and possibly much larger.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  164 / Friday,  August  22,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

49913 

The Department is uncertain whether 

the magnitude and incidence of 
investment errors and the potential for 
correction of such errors in the context 
of IRAs might differ from that in the 
context of ERISA-covered DC plans. If a 
DC plan’s menu of investment options 
is efficient then the incidence and/or 
magnitude of errors might be smaller 
than in the IRA context. If it is 
inefficient then errors might be more 
numerous and/or larger, but the 
potential for correcting them might be 
constrained. As noted earlier, evidence 
on the efficiency of existing menus is 
mixed. 

The Department is uncertain about 
the mix of advice and other support 
arrangements that will compose the 
market, and about the relative 
effectiveness of alternative investment 
advice arrangements or other means of 
supporting participants’ investment 
decisions. For example, to what extent 
will arrangements pursuant to this 
proposed class exemption displace 
alternative arrangements? Will advice 
arrangements operating pursuant to this 
proposed class exemption be more, less, 
or equally effective as alternative 
arrangements? 

This analysis has assumed that all 

types of advice arrangements are equally 
effective at reducing investment errors, 
and that none will increase errors (there 
will be no very bad advice). This 
assumption may not hold, however, for 
a number of reasons. For example, as 
illustrated above in table 1, advisers 
operating pursuant to different 
exemptive relief may be subject to 
different levels of conflicts of interest. 
Individuals providing advice pursuant 
to this proposed class exemption may 
face particularly direct conflicts, in the 
form of opportunities to tailor advice to 
directly profit themselves at 
participants’ expense. The Department’s 
consideration of this risk was detailed 
above. 

The conditions attached to exemptive 
relief under the PPA and this proposed 
class exemption are intended to control 
this risk while keeping advice 
affordable. The Department notes that if 
users of advice are fully informed and 
rational then more cost effective 
arrangements will dominate the market. 
This proposed class exemption 
establishes conditions to ensure that 
prospective users of advice available 
pursuant to it will have the opportunity 
to become fully informed. 

The Department is uncertain about 

the potential magnitude of any 
transitional costs associated with this 
proposed regulation and proposed class 
exemption. These might include costs 
associated with efforts of prospective 

fiduciary advisers to adapt their 
business practices to the applicable 
conditions. They might also include 
transaction costs associated with initial 
implementation of investment 
recommendations by newly advised 
participants. 

Another source of uncertainty 

involves potential indirect downstream 
effects of this proposed regulation and 
proposed class exemption. Investment 
advice may sometimes come packaged 
with broader financial advice, which 
may include advice on how much to 
contribute to a DC plan. The Department 
has no basis to estimate the incidence of 
such broad advice or its effects, but 
notes that those effects could be large. 
The opening of large new markets to a 
variety of investment advice 
arrangements to which they were 
heretofore closed may affect the 
evolution of investment advice products 
and services and related technologies 
and their distribution channels and 
respective market shares. Other possible 
indirect effects that the Department 
lacks bases to estimate include financial 
market impacts of changes in investor 
behavior and related macroeconomic 
effects. 

The Department invites comments on 

how to improve this analysis, with 
particular attention to the assessment 
and explanation of attendant 
uncertainty, and how such analysis 
could be carried out. Comments that 
include specific suggestions or data to 
help support our analysis of impacts 
and the characterization of uncertainty 
would be especially useful. 
Executive Order 12866 

Under Executive Order 12866, the 

Department must determine whether a 
regulatory action is significant and 
therefore subject to the requirements of 
the Executive Order and review by the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB). This action, comprising this 
proposed regulation and proposed class 
exemption, is economically significant 
under section 3(f)(1) of the Executive 
Order because it is likely to have an 
effect on the economy of $100 million 
or more in any one year. Accordingly, 
the Department undertook the foregoing 
analysis of the actions’ impact. On that 
basis the Department believes that the 
actions’ benefits justify their costs. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 

U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes 
certain requirements with respect to 
Federal rules that are subject to the 
notice and comment requirements of 
section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and 

are likely to have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. For purposes of analysis under 
the RFA, the Department proposes to 
continue its usual practice of 
considering a small entity to be an 
employee benefit plan with fewer than 
100 participants.71 The Department 
estimates that approximately 100,000 
small plans, a significant number, will 
voluntarily begin offering investment 
advice to participants as a result of this 
proposed regulation and proposed class 
exemption. 

The primary effect of this proposed 

regulation and proposed class 
exemption will be to reduce 
participants’ investment errors. This is 
an effect on participants rather than on 
plans. The impact on plans generally 
will be limited to increasing the means 
by which they may make advice 
available to participants, and this 
impact will be similar and proportionate 
for small and large plans. Therefore the 
Department certifies that the impact on 
small entities will not be significant. 
Pursuant to this certification the 
Department has refrained from 
preparing an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis of this proposed 
regulation and proposed class 
exemption. The Department invites the 
public to comment on its definition of 
small entities and its certification. 

Notwithstanding this certification, the 
Department did separately consider the 
impact of this proposed regulation and 
proposed class exemption on 
participants in small plans. 
As noted earlier, prior to 

implementation of the PPA smaller plan 
sponsors offered advice generally, and 
in-person advice in particular, more 
frequently than larger plan sponsors. 
The Department believes that exemptive 
relief provided by both the PPA and this 
proposed class exemption will promote 
wider offering of advice by small and 
large plans sponsors alike. Accordingly 
the Department estimated the impacts 
on small plans assuming that they 
generally will be proportionate to those 
on large plans. However, because 
smaller plan sponsors are more likely to 
offer in-person advice, their average cost 
for advice and the proportion of 
participants using advice may both be 
higher. The Department estimates that 
the PPA and this proposed class 
exemption will reduce small DC plan 
participant investment errors 

71 EBSA requests comments on the 

appropriateness of the size standard used in 
evaluating the impact of these proposed rules on 
small entities. EBSA has consulted with the SBA 
Office of Advocacy concerning use of this 
participant count standard for RFA purposes. See 
13 CFR 121.903(c).

Congressional Review Act 

This notice of proposed rulemaking is 
subject to the Congressional Review Act 
provisions of the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996 (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) and, if 
finalized, will be transmitted to the 
Congress and the Comptroller General 
for review. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
For purposes of the Unfunded 

Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4), as well as Executive Order 
12875, the notice of proposed 
rulemaking does not include any federal 
mandate that will result in expenditures 
by state, local, or tribal governments in 
the aggregate of more than $100 million, 
adjusted for inflation, or increase 
expenditures by the private sector of 
more than $100 million, adjusted for 
inflation. 
Federalism Statement 

Executive Order 13132 (August 4, 

1999) outlines fundamental principles 
of federalism and requires the 
adherence to specific criteria by federal 
agencies in the process of their 
formulation and implementation of 
policies that have substantial direct 
effects on the States, the relationship 
between the national government and 
the States, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. This 
proposed rule does not have federalism 
implications because it has no 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Section 514 of 
ERISA provides, with certain exceptions 
specifically enumerated, that the 
provisions of Titles I and IV of ERISA

supersede any and all laws of the States 
as they relate to any employee benefit 
plan covered under ERISA. The 
requirements implemented in this 
proposed rule do not alter the 
fundamental provisions of the statute 
with respect to employee benefit plans, 
and as such would have no implications 
for the States or the relationship or 
distribution of power between the 
national government and the States. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 

As part of its continuing effort to 
reduce paperwork and respondent 
burden, the Department of Labor 
conducts a preclearance consultation 
program to provide the general public 
and Federal agencies with an 
opportunity to comment on proposed 
and continuing collections of 
information in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). This helps to 
ensure that the public understands the 
Department’s collection instructions; 
respondents can provide the requested 
data in the desired format, reporting 
burden (time and financial resources) is 
minimized, collection instruments are 
clearly understood, and the Department 
can properly assess the impact of 
collection requirements on respondents. 

Currently, EBSA is soliciting 

comments concerning the proposed 
information collection request (ICR) 
included in the Proposed Class 
Exemption for the Provision of 
Investment Advice to Participants and 
Beneficiaries of Self-Directed Individual 
Account Plans and IRAs and in the 
Proposed Investment Advice Regulation 
(Proposed Investment Advice Initiative). 
A copy of the ICR may be obtained by 
contacting the PRA addressee shown 
below or at http://www.RegInfo.gov. 
PRA Addressee: Gerald B. Lindrew, 
Office of Policy and Research, U.S. 

Department of Labor, Employee Benefits 
Security Administration, 200 
Constitution Avenue, NW., Room N– 
5718, Washington, DC 20210. 
Telephone: (202) 693–8410; Fax: (202) 
219–5333. These are not toll-free 
numbers. 

The Department has submitted a copy 

of the Proposed Investment Advice 
Initiative to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) in accordance with 
44 U.S.C. 3507(d) for review of its 
information collections. The 
Department and OMB are particularly 
interested in comments that: 
• Evaluate whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 

• Evaluate the accuracy of the 

agency’s estimate of the burden of the 
collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; 

• Enhance the quality, utility, and 

clarity of the information to be 
collected; and 
• Minimize the burden of the 

collection of information on those who 
are to respond, including through the 
use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other 
technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, 
e.g., permitting electronic submission of 
responses. 

Comments should be sent to the 

Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs, Office of Management and 
Budget, Room 10235, New Executive 
Office Building, Washington, DC 20503;

consideration. Please note that 
comments submitted to OMB are a 
matter of public record. 

The Department notes that a federal 

agency cannot conduct or sponsor a 
collection of information unless it is 
approved by OMB under the PRA, and 
displays a currently valid OMB control 
number, and the public is not required 
to respond to a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. Also, notwithstanding 
any other provisions of law, no person 
shall be subject to penalty for failing to 
comply with a collection of information 
if the collection of information does not 
display a currently valid OMB control 
number. EBSA will publish a notice of 
OMB’s action at the final rule stage. 

In order to use the statutory 

exemption and/or the class exemption 72 
to provide investment advice to 
participants and beneficiaries in 
participant-directed defined 
contribution (DC) plans and 
beneficiaries of individual retirement 
accounts (IRAs) (collectively hereafter, 
‘‘participants’’), investment advisory 
firms would be required to make 
disclosures to participants and hire an 
independent auditor every year. 
Investment advice firms following the 
conditions of the exemption based on 
disclosure of computer model-generated 
investments would be required to obtain 
certification of the model from an 
eligible investment expert.73 The class 
exemption conditions relief on 
establishing written policies and 
procedures and both exemptions impose 
recordkeeping requirements.74 These 
paperwork requirements are designed to 
safeguard the interests of participants in 
connection with investment advice 
covered by the exemptions. 

The Department has made several 

specific basic assumptions in order to 
establish a reasonable estimate of the 
paperwork burden of this information 
collection: 
• The Department assumes that 80% 

of disclosures 75 will be distributed 

72 The Department assumes that all advisory firms 

use both the statutory exemption and the class 
exemption. 

73 All costs associated with model certification 

are assigned to the statutory exemption. 

74 All costs associated with composing written 
policies and procedures are assigned to the class 
exemption. 

75 This estimate is derived from Current 

Population Survey October 2003 School 
Supplement probit equations applied to the 
February 2005 Contingent Worker Supplement. 
These equations show that approximately 81 
percent of workers aged 19 to 65 had internet access 
either at home or at work in 2005. The Department 
further assumes that one percent of these 
participants will elect to receive paper documents 
instead of electronic, thus 20 percent of participants 
receive disclosures through paper media.

electronically via means already in 
existence as a usual and customary 
business practice and the costs arising 
from electronic distribution will be 
negligible.76 
• The Department assumes that 
investment advisory firms will use 
existing in-house resources to prepare 
the policies and procedures and most 
disclosures and to maintain the 
recordkeeping systems. This assumption 
does not apply to the computer model 
certification, the audit or the computer 
program used to generate disclosures for 
IRA participants. 

• The Department assumes a 

combination of personnel will perform 
the information collections with an 
hourly wage rate for 2008 of $79 for a 
financial manager, $21 for clerical 
personnel, $109 for a legal professional, 
and $67 for a computer programmer.77 
The Statutory Exemption 

The Department assumes that 

approximately 16,000 investment 
advisory firms 78 (including broker- 
dealers) will take advantage of this 
statutory exemption to provide advice to 
participants.79 The number of 
investment advisory firms using this 
statutory exemptive relief is assumed to 
be constant over time. The Department 
estimates that under the statutory 
exemption approximately 52,000 DC 
plans will seek to provide advice to 
their participants and beneficiaries. 
These DC plans represent approximately 
6,611,000 participants and beneficiaries, 
of which approximately 1,487,000 will 
seek advice from the investment 
advisory firm servicing their employer- 

76 The Department assumes that plans will deliver 

disclosures electronically in compliance with the 
Department’s rules relating to the use of electronic 
media (29 CFR 2520.104b–1(c)). The Department 
has not estimated any additional burden for plans 
to receive affirmative consents from participants to 
receive required disclosures electronically. The 
Department welcomes comments on this 
assumption. 

77 Hourly wage estimates are based on data from 

the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational 
Employment Survey (May 2005) and the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (Sept. 
2006). All hourly wage rates include wages and 
benefits. Clerical wage and benefits estimates are 
based on metropolitan wage rates for executive 
secretaries and administrative assistants. Financial 
manager wage and benefits estimates are based on 
metropolitan wage estimates for financial managers. 
Legal professional wage and benefits estimates are 
based on metropolitan wage rates for lawyers. 
Computer programmer wage and benefits estimates 
are based on metropolitan wage rates for 
professional computer programmers. 

78 Unless otherwise noted, numbers are rounded 

to the nearest 1,000. 

79 This estimate is derived from Angela A. Hung 

et al., Investor and Industry Perspectives on 
Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers, RAND 
Corporation Technical Report (2008), at http:// 
www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008- 
1_randiabdreport.pdf. 

sponsored retirement investment plan. 
IRAs can also make use of this statutory 
exemption, and the Department 
estimates that approximately 8.7 million 
IRA beneficiaries will seek advice under 
this statutory exemption.80 
Disclosures to Participants 

In general, under section 2550.408(g)– 
1(g) of the proposal, a fiduciary adviser 
is required to furnish detailed 
information to a participant about an 
advice arrangement before initially 
providing investment advice, annually, 
upon participant request and if there is 
any material change to the information. 
The information includes the following: 
The relationship between the adviser 
and the parties that developed the 
investment advice program or selected 
the investment options available under 
the DC plan or IRA; to the extent such 
information is not otherwise provided, 
the past performance and historical 
rates of return of investments available 
under the DC plan or IRA; all fees and 
other compensation the fiduciary 
adviser or any affiliate is to receive in 
connection with the provision of 
investment advice or in connection with 
the investment; the fiduciary adviser’s 
material relationship, if any, to any 
investment under the arrangement; the 
types of services the fiduciary adviser 
provides in connection with the 
provision of investment advice; the 
manner in which participant 
information may be used or disclosed; 
an acknowledgement that the fiduciary 
adviser is acting as a fiduciary of the DC 
Plan or IRA in connection with 
providing the investment advice; and 
notice that the recipient of the advice 
may separately arrange for advice from 

80 To be conservative, the Department assumes 

that all 16,000 advisory firms give advice pursuant 
to both the statutory and class exemptions as they 
all will have some clients who request only level 
fee or computer model advice under the statutory 
exemption and other clients who request off-model 
advice under the class exemption. The Department 
estimates that there are approximately 209,000 DC 
plans that are currently offering advice (pre- 
statutory exemption advice), that after the statutory 
exemption is published approximately 261,000 DC 
plans will offer advice and that after the class 
exemption is published approximately 314,000 DC 
plans will offer advice. The Department cannot 
determine which of these plans will be offering 
advice under pre-statutory exemption, statutory 
exemption or class exemption conditions; thus the 
Department decided to apply costs to the statutory 
and class exemptions based on the incremental 
change in the number of DC plans offering advice. 
This method is also applied to the number of IRA 
beneficiaries receiving advice; the Department 
estimates that approximately 16.8 million IRA 
beneficiaries received advice under pre-statutory 
exemption conditions, approximately 25.5 million 
will receive advice under statutory exemption 
conditions and approximately 34.0 will receive 
advice under class exemption conditions. The 
Department welcomes comments on this 
assumption.

another adviser that could have no 
relationship to, and receive no fees in 
connection with, the investments. If 
applicable, the fiduciary adviser also 
furnishes in writing to the DC plan 
fiduciary an election, as permitted 
under the regulation, to be treated as the 
sole fiduciary providing investment 
advice through a computer model to an 
ERISA-covered DC plan participant. The 
Department assumes that investment 
advisory firms will compile all of these 
notices into a single four-page 
disclosure package for each participant 
given advice. As these disclosures are to 
be given to the participants and are 
based upon the investments that are 
recommended, the Department further 
assumes that these disclosures will be 
generated at three levels: The 
investment advisory firm level, the DC 
plan level and the IRA beneficiary level. 
The firms will generate a template for 
each of these disclosures levels.81 
Preparation of Statutory Exemption 
Disclosure Package 

For the first year (initial) disclosures, 
the Department assumes that it takes a 
legal professional approximately six 
hours per investment advisory firm to 
prepare disclosures that are common to 
all of their participants, about 100 hours 
per investment advisory firm to assist an 
out-sourced computer programmer in 
creating computer software that will 
generate disclosure notices for IRA 
beneficiaries, and approximately two 
and one-half hours per DC plan to 
prepare disclosures that are common to 
all DC plan participants and 
beneficiaries in the same DC plan. These 
hours add up to an hour burden of 
approximately 1,779,000 hours; at a 
wage rate of $109 for a legal professional 
the equivalent cost is approximately 
$194,792,000. 

For the annual updating of 

disclosures required by Section 
2550.408g–1(g)(4)(ii), the Department 

81 The following disclosures are assumed to be 
constant for all participants advised: The material 
affiliation or material contractual relationships, use 
of participant information, type of services 
provided by the fiduciary adviser, acknowledgment 
that the adviser is acting as a fiduciary of the DC 
plan or IRA, and a statement that the participant 
can arrange for advice from an adviser who does not 
receive fees in connection with the investment or 
has no material affiliation with the investments 
recommended. The following disclosures are 
assumed to be constant for each participant of an 
individual DC plan: The fees and compensation the 
adviser receives in connection with the suggested 
investments and the material affiliation to the 
suggested investments. As discussed below these 
last two disclosures are also the only disclosures 
that are specific to the IRA beneficiary, and as such 
will require the adviser to generate individual 
disclosures for each IRA beneficiary advised using 
the computer model generated by the service 
providers.

assumes that the preparation time 
needed for updating the notices that are 
the same for all participants will be 
about three hours for each of the 16,000 
investment advisory firms.82 The 
Department assumes that updating 
notices that are the same for all DC plan 
participants and beneficiaries is 
estimated to take on average one hour 
and a half for each of over 52,000 DC 
plans. The preparation time needed for 
individualized notices for IRAs is 
estimated to average 50 hours for each 
of 16,000 investment advisory firms. 
Thus the annual hour burden for 
preparation is estimated to be 
approximately 903,000 hours with an 
equivalent cost of approximately 
$98,829,000. 

The Department assumes that all 

firms will outsource the creation of a 
computer program to enable them to 
prepare disclosures for IRA participants. 
This computer model will be used to 
generate disclosures to participants 
under both the statutory exemption and 
the class exemption. The Department 
estimates that a computer programmer 
will charge on average $1,200 per firm 
in the first year and $600 each 
subsequent year.83 Thus the cost 
burden, given there are almost 16,000 
investment advisory firms, will be 
approximately $18,662,000 in the first 
year and approximately $9,331,000 in 
all subsequent years. 
Distribution of Statutory Exemption 
Disclosure Package 

The Department assumes that a 

clerical professional will be required to 
spend one minute per page (four 
minutes per disclosure package) to 
photocopy the 20 percent of disclosure 
packages that are delivered in paper and 
one minute per disclosure package to 
prepare the ten percent of disclosures 
that are mailed each year.84 These hours 
add up to an hour burden of 
approximately 864,000 hours; at a wage 
rate of approximately $21 for a clerical 
professional the equivalent cost is 
approximately $3,225,000. 

82 The Department assumes that investment 

advisory firms will distribute the same disclosures 
throughout the year and that they only update their 
disclosure content for the annual disclosures. The 
Department further assumes that few disclosures 
are requested each year (one per firm on average) 
and most requested disclosures are distributed 
either electronically at a negligible cost or in person 
at small costs. The Department welcomes comments 
on these assumptions. 

83 The Department has based this cost estimate on 

limited industry data. 

84 Eighty percent of disclosures are assumed to be 

distributed electronically. In addition, the 
Department assumes that one half of all paper 
disclosures are delivered in person and one half are 
delivered through the mail. 

The Department assumes that the 

paper and photocopy costs are five cents 
per page; thus, given that there are 
approximately 2,030,000 participants 
receiving paper disclosures, the 
associated cost burden for paper and 
photocopying under the statutory 
exemption is estimated to be $406,000 
annually. Under the basic United States 
Postal Service postage at a cost of 
$0.42 85 per disclosure package for 
approximately 1,015,000 participants 
receiving mailed disclosures, the 
postage costs are estimated at about 
$426,000 annually. Thus the cost 
burden associated with distributing 
disclosures to participants is $832,000 
per year. 
Independent Certification 

If the fiduciary adviser provides the 

investment advice through use of a 
computer model, then before providing 
the advice, Section 2550.408g–1(d)(2) of 
the proposed regulation would require 
the fiduciary adviser to obtain the 
certification of an eligible investment 
expert as to the computer model’s 
compliance with certain standards (e.g., 
applies generally accepted investment 
theories, unbiased operation, objective 
criteria) set forth in the regulation. The 
Department assumes that there are six 
companies that will provide the 
investment advice computer model 86 
and that legal professionals working at 
these six companies supply in-house 
support by providing documentation 
and other information to the eligible 
investment expert who certifies the 
company’s investment advice computer 
model. These legal professionals are 
assumed to spend about 40 hours for 
each of the six investment advice 
computer model providers and on 
average 40 hours for each of the almost 
16,000 investment advisory firms to 
whom the computer model providers 
supply their models. Thus, the 
investment advice computer model 
providers have an hour burden of 
approximately 622,000 hours for an 
equivalent cost of about $68,125,000. 

The Department assumes that the 

investment advisory firm will need in- 
house legal professionals to provide 
documentation and other information to 
the eligible investment expert who 
certifies the investment advisory firm’s 
investment advice computer model. 
These legal professionals will spend on 
average ten hours for each of over 
52,000 DC plans and on average 50 

85 The USPS increased the cost of First Class 

Postage to $0.42 as of May 2008. 

86 Based on limited information with respect to 

the investment computer model industry, the 
Department estimates that there are six companies 
that produce investment advice computer models.

hours for each of the almost 16,000 
investment advisory firms. Thus the 
hour burden in the first year for the 
certification of the investment advice 
computer model is approximately 
1,924,000 hours with an equivalent cost 
of about $210,571,000. 

The Department assumes that in 

subsequent years the hours required for 
any investment advice computer model 
recertification will be approximately 
half of the first certification and that 
investment advisory firms will have 
their investment advice computer model 
recertified on average once a year. Thus 
in the subsequent years the hour burden 
is approximately 962,000 hours with an 
equivalent cost of approximately 
$105,286,000. 
Recordkeeping Requirements 
Consistent with the statutory 

exemption, section 2550.408g–1(i) of the 
proposed regulation would require 
fiduciary advisers to maintain records 
with respect to the investment advice 
provided in reliance on the regulation 
necessary to determine whether the 
applicable requirements of the 
regulation have been satisfied. The 
Department assumes that all investment 
advisory firms maintain recordkeeping 
systems as part of their normal business 
practices. The Department assumes that 
all records that are required to be 
maintained will be kept electronically 
under normal business practices; 
therefore, no printing and negligible 
holding costs are anticipated to be 
associated with records maintenance. 
Audit Requirement 

Any fiduciary adviser relying on the 

exemption would be required to engage, 
at least annually, an independent 
auditor to conduct an audit of the 
investment advice arrangement for 
compliance with the conditions of the 
exemption pursuant to section 
2550.408g–1(f)(1) of the proposed 
regulation. All firms are assumed to 
outsource this service but use some 
internal clerical and legal professional 
time to assist the auditor. 87 The clerical 

87 Audit firms are expected to transmit the final 

audit report to the advisory firm through electronic 
means at no additional costs. The advisory firms 
must either furnish a copy of the audit report to IRA 
beneficiaries or make the audit report available on 
their Web site and inform IRA beneficiaries of the 
purpose of the report and how and where to locate 
the report applicable to their account with the other 
disclosures discussed above. The Department 
assumes that all advisory firms will make the audit 
report available on their Web site and add a few 
sentences to the single disclosure package at 
negligible costs. Any advisory firm whose audit 
report identifies noncompliance with the 
requirements of the statutory or class exemption 
must send a copy of the report to the Department 
within 30 days following receipt of the report. The

staff is expected to spend about three 
hours per advisory firm and on average 
ten minutes per participant to gather 
documentation and other information. 
The in-house legal professional is 
expected to need approximately four 
hours per advisory firm to assist the 
auditor with the statutory exemption 
audit. The Department estimates that 
about one percent of participants will be 
audited per year, resulting in 
approximately 101,000 audits. Overall, 
the annual in-house hour burden for the 
annual audit requirement is estimated at 
126,000 hours, with equivalent costs of 
approximately $8,157,000. 

The Department assumes that the 
statutory exemption audits will be 
outsourced to an independent legal 
professional for each of the almost 
16,000 investment advisory firms and 
will cost on average $18,000.88 Thus the 
annual cost burden will be 
approximately $279,936,000. 
Summary of Statutory Exemption Hour 
and Cost Burden 

In summary, the third-party 
disclosures, computer model 
certification, and audit requirements for 
the statutory exemption require 
approximately 3,981,000 burden hours 
with an equivalent cost of 
approximately $416,745,000 and a cost 
burden of approximately $579,367,000 
in the first year. In each subsequent year 
the total labor burden hours are 
estimated to be approximately 2,143,000 
hours with an equivalent cost of 
approximately $215,497,000 and the 
cost burden is estimated at 
approximately $430,067,000 per year. 
The Class Exemption 

The Department assumes that all of 
the 16,000 investment advisory firms 
that take advantage of the statutory 
exemption will also provide advice that 
relies on the class exemption. As 
mentioned above, all investment 
advisory firms provide advice under 
both DC plans and IRAs, and the 
number of investment advisory firms 
using this class exemptive relief is 
assumed to be constant over time. The 
Department estimates that under the 
class exemption approximately 52,000 
DC retirement plans will seek to provide 
advice to their participants and 
beneficiaries. These plans represent 
approximately 6,611,000 participants 

Department assumes that the majority of advisory 
firms will comply with the exemption; therefore, 
the costs associated with sending the audit reports 
to the Department are expected to be negligible. The 
Department welcomes comments on this 
assumption. 

88 The Department has based this cost estimate on 

limited industry data. 

and beneficiaries, of which 
approximately 2,016,000 will seek 
advice from the investment advisory 
firm employed on behalf of their 
employer sponsored retirement 
investment plan. IRAs can also make 
use of this class exemption, and the 
Department estimates that 
approximately 8.5 million IRA 
beneficiaries will seek advice under this 
class exemption.89 
Disclosures to Participants 

In general, section III(g)(1) of the Class 

Exemption requires a fiduciary adviser 
to furnish detailed information to a 
participant about an advice arrangement 
before initially providing investment 
advice, annually, upon participant 
request, and if there is any material 
change to the information. The 
information to be provided is the same 
under the class exemption as the 
statutory exemption (see Section I(a) 
above for a listing of all required 
disclosures). Additional disclosures 
required before providing investment 
advice would depend on which 
alternative conditions the arrangement 
is designed to satisfy. If the investment 
advice arrangement is based on the 
disclosure of computer-generated 
investment selections, the fiduciary 
adviser is required to furnish those 
selections to the participant. If the 
fiduciary adviser determines computer 
modeling of the number and types of 
investment choices available to an IRA 
is reasonably precluded, the fiduciary 
adviser may instead furnish asset class 
allocation models to the participant. 
Alternatively, such disclosures may not 
be required if a fiduciary adviser 
satisfies the condition that would 
require that the compensation of the 
person providing advice on behalf of the 
fiduciary adviser may not vary based on 
the particular investments selected. The 
Department assumes that investment 
advisory firms will compile all notices 
into a single five-page disclosure 
package for each participant given 
advice under the class exemption and 
that these disclosures will be prepared 
at the investment advisory firm, DC 
plan, and IRA beneficiary levels. 
Preparation of Class Exemption 
Disclosure Package 

The Department assumes that 

disclosures that are common to all of the 
advisory firm’s client participants as 
well as the computer program used to 

89 See footnote 51 above for an explanation of the 

number of entities affected by the regulation. The 
Department assumes that these DC plans are 
offering, and DC participants and beneficiaries, and 
IRA beneficiaries are receiving advice under the 
class exemption but not the statutory exemption.

generate disclosures to IRA beneficiaries 
will have been prepared to conform to 
the requirements of the statutory 
exemption and will not impose any 
additional burden on respondents. 
For the first year disclosures, the 
Department assumes that the 16,000 
investment advisory firms might require 
a legal professional to work on average 
80 hours each to assist an out-sourced 
computer programmer in creating 
computer software that will generate 
individualized disclosure notices for 
IRA participants, and approximately 
two hours per DC plan to prepare 
disclosures that are common to all 
participants in the same DC plan. These 
hours add up to an hour burden of 
approximately 1,349,000 hours; at a 
wage rate of $109 for a legal professional 
the equivalent cost is approximately 
$147,662,000. 

For the annual updating of 

disclosures the Department assumes 
that the preparation time needed for 
updating the notices will be on average 
one hour per DC plan (for DC plan 
individualized disclosures) and on 
average 40 hours for each investment 
advisory firms (for IRA beneficiary 
individualized disclosures). Thus, the 
annual hour burden is estimated to be 
approximately 674,000 with an 
equivalent cost of approximately 
$73,831,000. 
Distribution of Class Exemption 
Disclosure Package 

The Department assumes that a 

clerical professional will spend five 
minutes 90 to photocopy each of the 
approximately 2,102,000 disclosure 
packages that are delivered in paper and 
one minute to prepare each of the 
1,051,000 disclosures that are mailed 
each year. These hours add up to an 
hour burden of approximately 193,000 
hours; at a wage rate of $21 for a clerical 
professional the equivalent cost is 
approximately $4,082,000. 

Using a paper and photocopy cost of 
five cents per page, the associated cost 
burden for paper and photocopying 
under the class exemption is estimated 
to be $525,000 annually. Under the 
basic USPS postage at a cost of $0.42 per 
disclosure package, the cost burden of 
the mailing disclosures under the class 
exemption will be approximately 
$441,000 annually. Thus the overall cost 

90 The Department estimates that most of the 

investment advisory firms that take advantage of the 
class exemption will determine that computer 
modeling of the number and types of investment 
choices available to an IRA is not possible, and will 
instead furnish asset class allocation models to the 
beneficiaries. As such, the disclosure package for 
participants who receive advice pursuant to the 
class exemption is estimated as being five pages in 
length, instead of four.

burden associated with distributing 
disclosures to participants is estimated 
at about $967,000 per year. 
Independent Certification 

The entire costs of the certification 
requirements are accounted for under 
the statutory exemption. 
Policies and Procedures 

Section III(i) of the Class Exemption 
requires investment advisory firms that 
wish to provide investment advice 
pursuant to the class exemption to 
develop written policies and procedures 
that insure the firm follows all of the 
class exemption requirements. The 
Department estimates that updating the 
written policies and procedures will 
generally require no additional costs. It 
is assumed that the preparation of these 
policies and procedures will require on 
average seven hours of legal 
professional time for each of the almost 
16,000 investment advisory firms. This 
leads to an hour burden in the first year 
of about 109,000 hours with an 
equivalent cost of approximately 
$11,917,000. 
Recordkeeping Requirements 

Section III(n) of the proposed class 

exemption requires fiduciary advisers to 
maintain records with respect to the 
investment advice provided in reliance 
on the exemption necessary to 
determine, explain or verify compliance 
with the conditions of the exemption, 
including those records necessary to 
determine that the disclosures described 
above have been made. In this 
connection, the fiduciary adviser would 
be required to maintain records 
necessary to determine, among other 
things, that an independent fiduciary 
has provided express authorization of 
the arrangement under which the 
investment advice is provided, that, if 
applicable, an eligible investment expert 
has provided the requisite certification, 
that the compensation to the fiduciary 
adviser and its affiliates in connection 
with the investments is reasonable, that 
the terms of the purchase sale or 
holding of the investment are at least as 
favorable to the plan or IRA as those in 
an arm’s length transactions would be, 
and in cases where the advice is not 
provided after disclosure of computer 
generated investments or an asset class 
allocation model, the fees or other 
compensation received by an employee, 
agent or registered representative 
providing investment advice on behalf 
of the fiduciary adviser does not vary 
depending on the option. The 
Department assumes that all investment 
advisory firms maintain recordkeeping 

systems to satisfy these information 
collections requirements. 

A fiduciary adviser may provide 

individualized investment advice to 
participants or beneficiaries (‘‘off-model 
advice’’) following the furnishing of 
investment advice generated by a 
computer model as described in section 
III(e)(1) of the Class Exemption, or in the 
case of beneficiaries of IRAs described 
in section III(e)(2), following the 
furnishing of investment education-type 
materials (graphs, pie charts, etc) that 
produce or reflect asset allocation 
models. However, section III(e)(4) of the 
Class Exemption requires that, with 
respect to any off-model advice that 
recommends investment options that 
may generate for the adviser or certain 
other parties greater income than other 
investments in the same asset class, the 
individual who provides investment 
advice on behalf of the fiduciary 
adviser, not later than 30 days after 
providing the advice, must document 
the basis for concluding that the 
recommendation is in the best interest 
of the participant or beneficiary. The 
Department assumes that such off 
-model advice will be provided in ten 
percent of the possible DC plan cases, 
and 30 percent of the possible IRA 
beneficiary cases. Thus, of the 
approximately 2,016,000 DC 
participants and approximately 8.5 
million IRA beneficiaries receiving 
advice under the class exemption, 
almost 202,000 DC plan participants 
and 2.5 million IRA beneficiaries will 
receive off-model advice.91 

The Department further assumes that 

each participant receiving advice will 
receive this advice an average of four 
times per year (once a quarter), resulting 
in almost 10,996,000 reports. The 
Department assumes that each 
investment advisor who provides off- 
model advice will need approximately 
15 minutes to write this report. 
Generating these reports is estimated to 
result in approximately 2,749,000 
annual burden hours for the financial 
manager with an associated equivalent 
cost of $217,125,000. 
Audit 

Any fiduciary adviser relying on the 
class exemption also would be required 
to engage, at least annually, an 
independent auditor to conduct an audit 
of the investment advice arrangement 
for compliance with the class exemption 
and written policies and procedures (as 
described below) designed to assure 

91 Based on limited information on the type of 

advice given to participants, the Department 
estimates that ten percent of DC plan participants 
and 30 percent of IRA beneficiaries will receive off- 
Model Advice.

compliance with the conditions of the 
exemption. The fiduciary adviser would 
be required to issue a written report to 
each plan fiduciary who authorized the 
use of the investment advice 
arrangement, and to IRA beneficiaries, 
setting forth the auditor’s findings. With 
respect to IRA’s, the fiduciary adviser 
may instead make the report available 
on its Web site. Also with respect to an 
arrangement with an IRA, if the auditor 
finds noncompliance with the 
exemption, the fiduciary adviser must 
file the report with the Department of 
Labor. 

All firms are assumed to outsource 

this service but use some internal 
clerical and legal professional time to 
assist the auditor. As an audit is 
required under the statutory exemption, 
the fixed in-house hours are attributed 
to the statutory exemption and only the 
variable clerical hours are divided 
between the statutory and class 
exemption. Under the class exemption 
clerical staff is expected to spend on 
average ten minutes per audited 
participant to pull each audited 
participant’s files or to provide other 
documentation or information. The 
Department estimates that about 
105,000 participants will be audited 
annually. Overall, the annual in-house 
hour burden for the audit requirement is 
estimated at 18,000 hours with 
equivalent costs of approximately 
$371,000. 

The Department assumes that the 

class exemption audits will be 
outsourced to an independent legal 
professional for each of the almost 
16,000 investment advisory firms and 
will cost on average $4,000 per year for 
each investment advisory firm.92 Thus 
the annual cost burden will be 
approximately $62,208,000. 
Summary of Class Exemption Hour and 
Cost Burden 

In summary, the third-party 

disclosures, written policies and 
procedures, recordkeeping and audit 
requirements for the class exemption are 
estimated to require a total of 
approximately 4,417,000 burden hours 
with an equivalent cost of 
approximately $381,157,000 and a total 
cost burden of approximately 
$63,175,000 in the first year. In each 
subsequent year the total burden hours 
are estimated at approximately 
3,634,000 hours with an equivalent cost 
of approximately $295,409,000 and a 
total cost burden of approximately 
$63,175,000 per year. 

92 The Department has based this cost estimate on 

limited industry data. 

Overall Exemption Hour and Cost 
Burden Summary 

In summary, the third-party 
disclosures, computer model 
certification, written policies and 
procedures, recordkeeping and audit 
requirements for the statutory and class 
exemptions require approximately 
8,398,000 burden hours with an 
equivalent cost of approximately 
$797,903,000 and a cost burden of 
approximately $642,541,000 in the first 
year. The labor burden hours in each 
subsequent year are approximately 
5,776,000 hours with an equivalent cost 
of approximately $510,906,000 and the 
cost burden in each subsequent year is 
approximately $493,242,000 per year. 
These paperwork burden estimates 

are summarized as follows:

2. Add § 2550.408g–1 to read as

§ 2550.408g–1 Investment Advice— 
Participants and Beneficiaries. 

(a) General. Section 408(g)(1) of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act, as amended (ERISA), provides an 
exemption from the prohibitions of 
section 406 of ERISA for transactions 
described in section 408(b)(14) of ERISA 
in connection with the provision of 
investment advice to a participant or a 
beneficiary if the investment advice is 
provided by a fiduciary adviser under 
an ‘‘eligible investment advice 
arrangement.’’ Section 4975(d)(17) and 
(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, as 
amended (the Code), contain parallel 
provisions to ERISA section 408(b)(14) 
and (g)(1). 

(b) Eligible investment advice 

arrangement. For purposes of section 
408(g)(1) of ERISA and section 
4975(f)(8) of the Code, an ‘‘eligible 
investment advice arrangement’’ means 
an arrangement that meets either the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section or paragraph (d) of this section, 
or both. 

(c) Arrangements that use fee-leveling. 

For purposes of this section, an 
arrangement is an eligible investment 
advice arrangement if— 

(1)(i) Any investment advice is based 

on generally accepted investment 
theories that take into account the 
historic returns of different asset classes 
over defined periods of time, although 
nothing herein shall preclude any 
investment advice from being based on 
generally accepted investment theories

that take into account additional 
considerations; 

(ii) Any investment advice takes into 

account information furnished by a 
participant or beneficiary relating to age, 
life expectancy, retirement age, risk 
tolerance, other assets or sources of 
income, and investment preferences, 
although nothing herein shall preclude 
any investment advice from taking into 
account additional information that a 
participant or beneficiary may provide; 
(iii) Any fees or other compensation 

(including salary, bonuses, awards, 
promotions, commissions or other 
things of value) received, directly or 
indirectly, by any employee, agent or 
registered representative that provides 
investment advice on behalf of a 
fiduciary adviser does not vary 
depending on the basis of any 
investment option selected by a 
participant or beneficiary; 

(iv) Any fees (including any 

commission or other compensation) 
received by the fiduciary adviser for 
investment advice or with respect to the 
sale, holding, or acquisition of any 
security or other property for purposes 
of investment of plan assets do not vary 
depending on the basis of any 
investment option selected by a 
participant or beneficiary; and 

(2) The requirements of paragraphs 

(e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) of this section are 
met. 

(d) Arrangements that use computer 

models. For purposes of this section, an 
arrangement is an eligible investment 
advice arrangement if the only 
investment advice provided under the 
arrangement is advice that is generated 
by a computer model described in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section 
under an investment advice program 
and with respect to which the 
requirements of paragraphs (e), (f), (g), 
(h), and (i) are met, and any acquisition, 
holding or sale of a security or other 
property pursuant to such advice occurs 
solely at the direction of the participant 
or beneficiary. 

(1) A computer model shall be 

designed and operated to— 

(i) Apply generally accepted 

investment theories that take into 
account the historic returns of different 
asset classes over defined periods of 
time, although nothing herein shall 
preclude a computer model from 
applying generally accepted investment 
theories that take into account 
additional considerations; 

(ii) Utilize information furnished by a 
participant or beneficiary relating to age, 
life expectancy, retirement age, risk 
tolerance, other assets or sources of 
income, and investment preferences, 
although nothing herein shall preclude

a computer model from taking into 
account additional information that a 
plan or a participant or beneficiary may 
provide; 

(iii) Utilize appropriate objective 
criteria to provide asset allocation 
portfolios comprised of investment 
options available under the plan; 

(iv) Avoid investment 
recommendations that: 

(A) Inappropriately favor investment 
options offered by the fiduciary adviser 
or a person with a material affiliation or 
material contractual relationship with 
the fiduciary adviser over other 
investment options, if any, available 
under the plan; or 

(B) Inappropriately favor investment 

options that may generate greater 
income for the fiduciary adviser or a 
person with a material affiliation or 
material contractual relationship with 
the fiduciary adviser; 

(v) Take into account all designated 

investment options, within the meaning 
of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, 
available under the plan without giving 
inappropriate weight to any investment 
option; except that a computer model 
shall not be treated as failing to meet 
this requirement merely because it does 
not take into account an investment 
option that constitutes an investment 
primarily in qualifying employer 
securities. 

(2) Prior to utilization of the computer 
model, the fiduciary adviser shall obtain 
a written certification, meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section from an eligible investment 
expert, within the meaning of paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section, that the computer 
model meets the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If, 
following a certification, a computer 
model is modified in a manner that may 
affect its ability to meet the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1), the 
fiduciary adviser shall, prior to 
utilization of the modified model, 
obtain a new certification from an 
eligible investment expert that the 
computer model, as modified, meets the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1). 

(3) The term ‘‘eligible investment 

expert’’ means a person that, through 
employees or otherwise, has the 
appropriate technical training or 
experience and proficiency to analyze, 
determine and certify, in a manner 
consistent with paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section, whether a computer model 
meets the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section; except that the 
term ‘‘eligible investment expert’’ does 
not include any person that has any 
material affiliation or material 
contractual relationship with the 
fiduciary adviser, with a person with a 

material affiliation or material 
contractual relationship with the 
fiduciary adviser, or with any employee, 
agent, or registered representative of the 
foregoing. 

(4) A certification by an eligible 

investment expert shall— 

(i) Be in writing; 
(ii) Contain— 
(A) An identification of the 

methodology or methodologies applied 
in determining whether the computer 
model meets the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section; 

(B) An explanation of how the applied 

methodology or methodologies 
demonstrated that the computer model 
met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section; 

(C) A description of any limitations 

that were imposed by any person on the 
eligible investment expert’s selection or 
application of methodologies for 
determining whether the computer 
model meets the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section; 
(D) A representation that the 

methodology or methodologies were 
applied by a person or persons with the 
educational background, technical 
training or experience necessary to 
analyze and determine whether the 
computer model meets the requirements 
of paragraph (d)(1); 

(E) A statement certifying that the 

eligible investment expert has 
determined that the computer model 
meets the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section; and 

(iii) Be signed by the eligible 

investment expert. 

(5) The selection of an eligible 

investment expert as required by this 
section is a fiduciary act governed by 
section 404(a)(1) of ERISA. 

(e) Arrangement must be authorized 

by a plan fiduciary. The arrangement 
pursuant to which investment advice is 
provided to participants and 
beneficiaries pursuant to this section 
must be expressly authorized by a plan 
fiduciary (or, in the case of an 
Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 
the IRA beneficiary) other than: the 
person offering the arrangement; any 
person providing designated investment 
options under the plan; or any affiliate 
of either. Provided, however, that for 
purposes of the preceding, in the case of 
an IRA, an IRA beneficiary will not be 
treated as an affiliate of a person solely 
by reason of being an employee of such 
person. 

(f) Annual audit. (1) The fiduciary 

adviser shall, at least annually, engage 
an independent auditor, who has 
appropriate technical training or 
experience and proficiency, and so

regarding compliance of the 
arrangement with the requirements of 
this section.

(i) Within 30 days following receipt of 
the report from the auditor, as described 
in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, 
shall furnish a copy of the report to the

material contractual relationship with 
the person offering the investment 
advice arrangement to the plan or any 
designated investment options under

(4) For purposes of this paragraph (f), 

the auditor shall review sufficient 
relevant information to formulate an

preclude an auditor from using 
information obtained by sampling, as

adviser or any affiliate thereof is to 
receive (including compensation 
provided by any third party) in 
connection with the provision of the

acquisition, or holding of the security or 
other property; 

(iv) Of any material affiliation or 

material contractual relationship of the

the security or other property; 

(v) Of the manner, and under what 

circumstances, any participant or

the arrangement will be used or 
disclosed; 

(vi) Of the types of services provided

account an investment option that 
constitutes an investment primarily in 
qualifying employer securities, as 
provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of 
this section; 

(vii) That the adviser is acting as a 

fiduciary of the plan in connection with 
the provision of the advice; and

written in a clear and conspicuous 
manner and in a manner calculated to 
be understood by the average plan 
participant and must be sufficiently

required to be provided in the 
notification. 

(ii) The appendix to this section 

contains a model disclosure form that 
may be used to provide notification of 
the information described in paragraph 
(g)(1)(iii) of this section. Use of the 
model form is not mandatory. However, 
use of an appropriately completed 
model disclosure form will be deemed 
to satisfy the requirement of paragraphs 
(g)(1) and (2)(i) of this section with 
respect to such information. 

(3) The notification required under 

paragraph (g)(1) of this section may, in 
accordance with 29 CFR 2520.104b–1,

recipient of the advice, 

(3) The compensation received by the 

fiduciary adviser and affiliates thereof 
in connection with the sale, acquisition, 
or holding of the security or other 
property is reasonable, and 

(4) The terms of the sale, acquisition, 

or holding of the security or other 
property are at least as favorable to the 
plan as an arm’s length transaction 
would be. 

(i) Maintenance of Records.—The 

fiduciary adviser must maintain, for a 
period of not less than 6 years after the 
provision of investment advice pursuant 
to the arrangement, any records
