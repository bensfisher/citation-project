Executive Summary 

 

 

 

 

 

Hazardous materials are essential to the health of the economy of the United States and the well-
being of its people.  These materials are transported via different means, but rail transportation of 
hazardous materials is recognized to be a safe method for moving large quantities of hazardous 
materials over long distances.  In particular, the vast majority of hazardous materials shipped by 
railroad tank cars each year arrive safely and without incident.  
 
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible for the 
safe and secure movement of hazardous materials (hazmat) by all transportation modes, 
including the Nation’s railroads.  PHMSA, in consultation with the Federal Railroad 
Administration (FRA), is proposing revisions to the Federal hazmat regulations1 that would 
improve the crashworthiness protection of railroad tank cars that are designed to transport poison 
inhalation hazard (PIH) materials. 2 
 
There are more than 20 hazardous materials that are considered to be PIH that are shipped by rail 
in tank car quantities.  Chlorine and anhydrous ammonia represent over 78 percent of the total 
PIH shipments.  
 
Over the past several years, several very serious accidents involving catastrophic releases of PIH 
materials have focused the attention of the public, press, National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) and the Congress on the serious consequences of these events.  Since 2002, the NTSB 
investigated three accidents involving tank cars transporting PIH materials.  In response to all 
three accidents, the NTSB recommended that FRA study improving the safety and structural 
integrity of tank cars and develop necessary operational measures to minimize the vulnerability 
of tank cars involved in accidents.  In particular, in response to a January 18, 2002, freight train 
derailment in Minot, North Dakota, which resulted in one death and 11 serious injuries due to the 
release of anhydrous ammonia when five tank cars carrying the product catastrophically 
ruptured, and a vapor plume covered the derailment site and surrounding area, the NTSB made 
four safety recommendations to FRA specific to the structural integrity of hazardous material 
tank cars.  Subsequently, in 2005, section 20155 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, 
Transportation Equity Act:  A Legacy for Users, Pub. L. 109-59 (SAFETEA-LU) reiterated 
NTSB’s recommendations in part by directing the Secretary of Transportation to “validate a 
predictive model to quantify the relevant dynamic forces acting on railroad tank cars under 
accident conditions.”  Section 20155 also directed the Secretary of Transportation to “initiate a 
rulemaking to develop and implement appropriate design standards for pressurized tank cars.”  
During the same period, major railroads and shippers expressed growing concern over the actual 
and potential liability associated with rail transportation of these commodities and they also 
expressed their desire to reduce the risk of catastrophic releases. 
 
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes enhanced tank car performance 
standards for head and shell impacts; operational speed restrictions for trains hauling PIH tank 
cars; interim operational restrictions for trains hauling tank cars not meeting the enhanced

2 PIH materials are gases or liquids that are known or presumed on the basis of tests to be so toxic to humans as to 
pose a hazard to health during transportation.  See 49 CFR §§ 171.8, 173.15, and 173.312.  See also 69 FR 50988 
(Aug. 16, 2004).

performance standards proposed, but used to transport PIH materials and operating in non-
signaled territory; and an allowance to increase the gross weight of tank cars that meet the 
enhanced tank-head and shell standards.  The NPRM is designed to very substantially reduce the 
risk of catastrophic releases of PIH materials.   
 
The proposed performance standards for tank-head and shell puncture resistance systems provide 
industry with flexibility to take advantage of innovative materials and technologies.  The related 
proposed operational limitations would restrict the operating speed of all tank cars transporting 
PIH materials to a maximum speed of 50 mph. 
  
The costs anticipated to accrue from adopting this proposed rule would include:  (1) the labor 
and material costs for incorporating enhanced crashworthiness features into tank cars that 
transport PIH materials, (2) the design and re-engineering costs required to implement the 
proposed enhanced tank-head and shell puncture-resistance systems, (3) the costs for transferring 
existing PIH tank cars to other commodity services, and (4) the maintenance and inspection costs 
for the new more crashworthy tank cars.  Additionally, there would be costs incurred as a result 
of the operational restrictions for tank cars that transport PIH materials, including:  (1) the cost of 
restricting railroad tank cars used to transport PIH materials to 50 mph, and (2) the cost of 
temporarily restricting existing railroad tank cars used to transport PIH materials in non-signaled 
territory to 30 mph.  Finally, there would be a cost for the increased traffic or volume of tank 
cars that transport PIH materials due to the increased weight, and thus lower commodity 
capacity, of those cars.   
 
The primary potential benefits or savings expected to accrue from the implementation of this 
proposed rule would be the reduction in the number and severity of casualties arising from train 
accidents and derailments involving tank cars that transport PIH materials.  In addition, benefits 
would accrue from a decrease in property damages, including damages to locomotives, railroad 
cars, and track; environmental damage; track closures; road closures; and evacuations.  
Moreover, there would also be a benefit in fuel savings (which may offset some of the 
operational costs) due to limiting train operating speeds.  
 
This document presents a 30-year analysis of the costs and benefits associated with DOT’s 
proposed rule, using both 7 percent and 3 percent discount rates.  It also presents an analysis of a 
regulatory alternative considered, and sensitivity analyses associated with varying assumptions 
used for estimating PIH release-related benefits.     
 
A baseline cost estimate is particularly important for the conduct of these analyses.  The railroad 
industry has expressed its intention to proceed with a standard of its own absent issuance of a 
DOT rule requiring enhanced crashworthiness of PIH tank cars.  In general, industry participants 
appear to recognize the need to improve the design of tank cars transporting PIH materials.  In 
fact, the AAR has mandated (but temporarily suspended to permit issuance of this notice of 
proposed rulemaking) use of heavier cars with top fittings that meet specified requirements such 
as the new tank cars built by Trinity Industries, Inc. (Trinity) for the transportation of PIH 
materials in interchange.  (These proposed interchange standards are referred to as the “AAR 
Interchange Standard”).  Accordingly, the baseline for the analyses conducted reflects 
compliance with the AAR standard by replacing the existing fleet of PIH tank cars with AAR 

2 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

compliant Trinity-like tank cars.  This baseline includes incremental costs associated with the 
design, construction, and operation of new Trinity-like tank cars to replace existing cars and the 
transfer of existing PIH tank cars to other commodity services.  The 30-year cost estimates 
associated with this baseline are $476.6 million (PV, 7%) and $718.7 million (PV, 3%).  
Annualized costs are $38.4 million (PV, 7%) and $36.7 million (PV, 3%).  
 
The analysis of the proposed rule takes into account the incremental impacts that would be 
incurred with meeting the proposed requirements (i.e., the design, construction, and operation 
costs for the new DOT-compliant cars in excess of the baseline impacts that would be incurred 
absent this rulemaking with the introduction of the AAR-mandated cars).  In addition, the 
proposed rule analyzes full impacts related to the proposed operating speed restrictions).  Thus, 
this analysis takes into account the fact that the AAR and shippers have active plans to make 
major changes in the tank car fleet that moves PIH commodities.  The 30-year cost estimates 
associated with implementation of the proposed rule are $350.6 million (PV, 7%) and $431.6 
million (PV, 3%).  Annualized costs are $28.3 million (PV, 7%) and $22.0 million (PV, 3%).  
 
The benefits of the proposed rule fall into two sub-groups.  The first group consists of benefits 
that would accrue from avoidance of collision- and derailment-related PIH releases resulting 
from a combination of the enhanced tank car crashworthiness standards and operating speed 
restrictions.  This group of benefits includes reductions in casualties; property damage, including 
damage to locomotives, rail cars and track; environmental damage; evacuation and shelter-in-
place costs; track closures; road closures; and electric power disruptions.  Casualty mitigation 
estimates are based on a value of statistical life of $5.8 million.  This group of benefits also 
includes more difficult to monetize benefits such as the avoidance of hazmat accident related 
costs incurred by Federal, state, and local governments and impacts to local businesses.  As with 
costs, the benefits associated with introducing DOT-compliant tank cars are reduced by the level 
of benefits that FRA estimates would accrue from replacing existing cars with AAR-mandated 
cars absent this rulemaking.  This analysis includes a scenario which DOT believes is the most 
realistic projection of benefits that would be realized, including the possibility of an event with 
moderately more severe consequences than has occurred in the past 10 years.  This approach 
recognizes the significant probability that, given the quantity of product released and the 
proximity of potentially affected populations to accident sites, in one or more events the 
consequences known to be possible will be realized, with loss of life on a scale not previously 
encountered.   
 
The second group of benefits consists of business benefits that would accrue in response to the 
operating speed restrictions (which may partially offset the operating costs imposed by these 
restrictions) and the enhanced tank car design.  This group includes fuel savings from economic 
efficiencies resulting from operating speed restrictions and repair savings from more salvageable 
tank cars.  DOT believes that the useful life of compliant tank cars introduced during the 30-year 
analysis period will extend well beyond that period as further explained in section 12.14.  
Moreover, the residual value at year 30 of tank cars constructed to meet the enhanced standards 
proposed will be greater than the residual value of conventional tank cars and Trinity-like tank 
cars contemplated by AAR’s new standard.  Thus, the analysis includes a benefit reflecting the 
residual value for the new tank cars at year 30.   
 

3 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

FRA then added up both of these groups of benefits over the next 30 years.  Taking both of these 
groups of benefits, relative to the state of the world where the AAR would enforce it’s 
interchange standard, the 30-year benefit estimates associated with implementation of the 
proposed rule are $666 million (PV, 7%) and $1.089 billion (PV, 3%).  Annualized benefits are 
$53.7 million (PV, 7%) and $55.6 million (PV, 3%).  
 
An evaluation of a “status quo” alternative is also included.  In general, industry parties appear to 
recognize the need to improve the design of tank cars transporting PIH materials.  In fact, as 
previously noted, the AAR Interchange Standard would require use of Trinity-like cars for the 
transportation of PIH materials in interchange.  Accordingly, the “status quo” alternative would 
be to allow the AAR to enforce its interchange standard.  The costs associated with such an 
alternative would still be represented by the baseline cost scenario; however, they would be 
equivalent to the costs the railroad industry is willing to incur voluntarily, and thus would not be 
considered true regulatory costs.  In addition, this alternative would not include costs from any 
operating speed restrictions.  The benefits from this alternative are estimated as approximately 
15% of the benefits that would be expected to result from implementation of the crashworthiness 
requirements of the proposed rule.  As with the costs, this alternative would not offer any of the 
business benefits associated with the DOT proposal due to the operating speed restrictions.  The 
30-year cost estimates associated with this alternative are $476.6 million (PV, 7%) and $718.7 
million (PV, 3%).   
 
Finally, three sensitivity analyses varying assumptions used to estimate the benefits of the 
proposed rule are included.  The first addresses the uncertainty regarding the consequences from 
release of PIH materials resulting from train accidents.  This analysis is based on the assumption 
that the consequences of projected incidents will be of the same average severity as those in the 
past ten years.  It does not recognize how fortunate the circumstances surrounding recent past 
incidents have been.  Given the rarity of the occurrence of rail accidents resulting in the release 
of PIH materials from tank cars, and the high variability in the circumstances and consequences 
of such events, this sensitivity analysis is useful.  The 30-year benefit estimates associated with 
this scenario are $786,073,251 (PV, 7%) and $866,616,695 (PV, 3%).  The second and third 
sensitivity analyses address the imprecision of assumptions regarding the value of a life, which 
affect the level of safety benefits (i.e., casualty mitigation) that would result from promulgation 
of the proposed rule.  This analysis presents benefit levels associated with values of a statistical 
life of $3.2 million and $8.4 million.  The 30-year benefit estimates associated with these 
scenario are $562,100,371(PV, 7%, VSL: $3.2M) and $857,952,000 PV, 7%, VSL: $8.4M).   
 
This rulemaking would fulfill the mandate of SAFETEA-LU and respond to NTSB’s 
recommendations pertaining to tank car structural integrity and operational measures, by 
specifying performance standards and operational restrictions sufficient to reduce the likely 
frequency of catastrophic releases to a level as low as reasonably possible, given the need to 
transport the products in question, and based on analysis of the forces that result from serious 
train accidents.  PHMSA and FRA note that, while the proposed actions are based exclusively on 
railroad safety considerations, strengthening the protective systems on PIH tank cars may also 
reduce the likelihood of a catastrophic release caused by criminal acts, such as deliberately 
throwing a switch in the face of an oncoming train or taking other action that could result in a 
derailment or collision.  

4 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 
The proposed actions would not reduce to zero the probability of a catastrophic release.  
However, achieving that goal is likely inconsistent with the purpose of the transportation service 
provided and beyond design practice that presently can be conceived.  The proposed actions 
would substantially reduce the risk presently attending transportation of the subject products, and 
these reductions can be achieved within a time certain.  Providing reassurance to the 
communities through which these trains travel, that every feasible action has been taken to 
safeguard those potentially affected, itself provides societal benefits.  Included among these 
benefits are peace of mind of residents and others within the potential zones of danger, and likely 
avoidance of more costly and less effective public responses (such as prohibiting transportation 
of the products outright or establishing burdensome conditions of transportation that are 
perceived to benefit individual communities while driving up total public exposure).

Introduction 

1.0 
 
PHMSA, in consultation with FRA, is proposing revisions to the Federal hazardous materials 
regulations that would improve the crashworthiness protection to railroad tank cars that transport 
PIH materials. 
 
Hazardous materials shipments represented 5 percent of the total U.S. rail carloads, and 5.4 
percent of the total tonnage in 2004.  PIH3 carloads for 2004 consisted of 105,000 carloads 
throughout the country.4 
 
Hazardous materials are vital to maintaining the health of the economy of the United States and 
are essential to the well-being of its people.  These materials are used in water purification, 
farming, manufacturing, and other industrial applications.  The need for hazardous materials to 
support essential services means that transportation of hazardous materials is unavoidable.  
Generally, rail transportation in the United States is recognized as being a safe method of moving 
large quantities of hazardous materials over long distances.  The vast majority of hazardous 
materials shipped by railroad tank car each year arrive safely and without incident.  
 
2.0  Statement of the Problem and Need for Proposed Action 
 
The Federal hazardous materials transportation law (Federal hazmat law, 49 U.S.C. §§ 5101 et 
seq., as amended by section 1711 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296 
and Title VII of the 2005 Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act:  A 
Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU)) authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) to “prescribe regulations for the safe transportation, including security, of 
hazardous material in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce.”  The Secretary has delegated 
this authority to PHMSA.  The Secretary also has authority over all areas of railroad 
transportation safety (Federal Railroad Safety laws, 49 U.S.C.  20101 et seq) and has delegated 
this authority to FRA.  See Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1.49. 
 
A primary safety and security concern in the rail transportation of hazardous materials is the 
prevention of a catastrophic release in proximity to such places as populated urban areas, events 
or venues with large numbers of people in attendance, iconic buildings, landmarks, or 
environmentally-sensitive areas.  Such a catastrophic event could be the result of an accident—
such as the January 6, 2005, derailment and release of chlorine in Graniteville, South Carolina; 
the accident and release of chlorine in Macdona, Texas, in June 2004; the derailment and release 
of anhydrous ammonia in Minot, North Dakota, in January 2002; or the derailment and release of 
chlorine in Alberton, Montana, in April of 1996.  It should be noted that not only large urban 
areas are potentially at risk.  In fact, in part as a result of the modestly higher train speeds that 
can be achieved through rural areas and smaller communities, compared to congested terminal 
areas in large cities, most of the fatal train accidents involving catastrophic release of these 
commodities have occurred in smaller towns and in the outskirts of larger population centers.

of Representatives Subcommittee on Railroads, June 13, 2006, p. 3.

Railroads carry over 1.7 million shipments of hazardous materials annually.  PIH materials are in 
the category of hazardous materials with the highest consequences (casualties and physical 
damage) when they are released because of loss of car integrity caused by a derailment or 
collision.  Consequences of such a scenario could include:  numerous casualties and injuries, 
particularly if it involves a highly hazardous chemical and occurs in a populated area; a high cost 
for decontamination; evacuation of nearby residences and business establishments; property and 
business damage; and a negative impact on other modes of transportation. 
 
It is also important to note that transportation of such hazardous materials is particularly 
vulnerable to sabotage or misuse.  In the wrong hands, hazardous materials can pose a significant 
threat.  
 
Market Failure 
 
Market failure exists when the allocation of goods and services by a market is not efficient.  
Currently, there are inefficiencies in the market relating to the rail transportation of PIH 
materials, such as chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, and these inefficiencies have led to a 
situation where the private markets are not adequately protecting the health and safety of the 
public.   
 
Railroads transport a little over 100,000 carloads of PIH materials annually.  According to the 
railroads, this traffic accounts for only 0.3 percent of all rail freight traffic.  As the railroads have 
a common carrier obligation to carry all freight offered for transport, including PIH materials, 
they cannot refuse to transport shipments of PIH materials even if the perceived risk observed by 
the railroad is thought to be too high.  PIH shipments frequently move through populated or 
environmentally-sensitive areas where the consequences of an accident could be the loss of life, 
serious injury, property damage, and significant environmental damage.  The railroads have had 
three serious accidents involving PIH releases since 2002, resulting in 13 deaths and numerous 
injuries and significant property damage.  The costs of the 2005 Graniteville, South Carolina 
accident alone totaled well over $100 million, and the railroad involved in that wreck is currently 
defending a suit in which a textile company that closed after the accident is seeking $420 million 
dollars in damages and an insurance company is seeking an additional $215 million for money it 
paid to the textile company.  Despite their tort liability, many of the costs associated with PIH 
accidents (especially environmental damage, first responder costs, and disruptions to the 
economy) are external to the railroads and therefore may not be properly taken into account 
when the railroads are making private safety decisions.  
 
There are a variety of steps railroads can take to reduce risks and increase revenues associated 
with the PIH traffic they carry.  However, given the uncertainty of whether a particular railroad 
will have an accident involving the release of PIH materials and the severity of such an accident, 
let alone the possibility of a PIH release caused by criminal or terrorist activity, it is difficult for 
railroads to ensure that they are covering their costs associated with PIH traffic.   
 
1) Railroads have attempted to cover their risk exposure by a combination of self-insurance and 
private insurance, but it is difficult for the railroads and their insurance underwriters to 
accurately predict what insurance level is adequate for a particular railroad. 

7 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 
2) Railroads can and have increased their shipping rates for PIH materials based on differential 
pricing and costs associated with the traffic (including insurance costs), and can continue to raise 
rates so long as the rates are reasonable.  (Rate reasonableness is determined by the Surface 
Transportation Board in a formal proceeding that is initiated following a complaint from a 
shipper.)  Given the uncertainties previously noted, it is difficult for the railroads to know 
whether the rates they are charging are adequate. 
 
3) Railroads can also implement safety measures designed to avoid derailments and train 
collisions that might result in the release of PIH materials, although they are unlikely to be able 
to eliminate all such incidents.   
 
4) Furthermore railroads can request PHMSA and FRA to impose new regulatory requirements 
(such as those proposed in this rulemaking) that would minimize the likelihood of a release of 
PIH materials in the event of a train collision or derailment, but have chosen not to seek such 
regulatory relief.  Instead the railroads have decided to force anhydrous ammonia and chlorine 
shippers to purchase new and slightly upgrade tank cars by issuing an interchange rule through 
the Association of American Railroads (AAR).  (Interchange rules establish standards that 
railroads must meet when they exchange rail cars with other railroads.)  AAR Casualty 
Prevention Circular 1178 (Circular 1178) requires that newly built chlorine and anhydrous 
ammonia tank cars meet specified tank car standards that exceed current PHMSA standards, and 
precludes the use of nonconforming cars in interchange after December 31, 2018.  The tank car 
standards are based on a tank car produced by Trinity Industries, Inc.  Shippers, rather than 
railroads, will bear the cost of Circular 1178 since PIH tank cars are owned by shippers and fleet 
management companies that lease the cars to the shippers.  Railroads are considering issuing 
similar restrictions for the rail movement of other PIH materials.  The railroads have temporarily 
suspended Circular 1178 until March 31, 2008, to permit PHMSA and FRA to issue a notice of 
proposed rulemaking that would impose new and enhanced PIH tank car standards. 
  
The Circular 1178 approach chosen by the railroads has two basic problems.  First, the AAR 
proposed tank car standards will not likely prevent PIH tank car releases in even moderate speed 
train accidents.  (As discussed latter, DOT has estimated that the Trinity car would only be about 
15 percent as effective as cars built to the standards in this rulemaking in eliminating or 
mitigating the release of a PIH material during a train collision or derailment.)  Second, chlorine 
and anhydrous ammonia shippers may be required to replace cars required by Circular 1178 
before the end of their useful life as new PHMSA tank car standards become effective.  Circular 
1178 will, therefore, require huge expenditures by the PIH shippers for only modest actual 
benefits to the railroads or the public at large.  Given the failure of the private markets to 
adequately reduce the risk of loss of lading in future derailments of tank cars transporting PIH 
materials, PHMSA and FRA have tentatively concluded that it is appropriate for PHMSA to 
issue regulations to reduce this risk.  The PHMSA regulatory process can achieve a solution that 
is best suited to maximizing public safety with economically balanced requirements for PIH 
shippers and railroads that carry these commodities.

Federal Solution 
 
When promulgating new or revised regulations, it is necessary to consider whether the regulation 
should be issued at the Federal level or at the state and/or local level.  PIH materials are 
manufactured and used at numerous locations in the United States, and are routinely imported for 
use in the United States directly by rail from Canada and by ship to U.S. ports and then by rail to 
their final destination.  This proposal would apply to all transportation of PIH materials by rail.  
Many railroads operate over extended areas that cross many local, and some state, boundaries.  
Local regulation of this issue would be extremely difficult and cumbersome.  State regulation of 
this issue for the shippers of PIH materials would also be complicated and likely more 
burdensome.  DOT believes that most large railroads and shippers would prefer a uniform 
Federal regulation to simplify the compliance and administrative costs.  Shippers of PIH are 
relying on a Federal solution to ensure seamless transportation across multiple state and local 
jurisdictions.  
 
3.0  Findings  
 
This analysis includes qualitative discussions and quantitative measurements of costs and 
benefits of the proposed rule.  The costs that would be imposed are primarily labor and material 
costs associated with incorporating the new crashworthiness features found in the proposed rule, 
and costs related to the designing and re-engineering required to implement the proposed safety 
enhancements.  In addition, there would be costs associated with transferring current PIH tank 
cars to other commodity services, and costs associated with the proposed operating restrictions.  
Finally, there would be costs for the increased traffic or volume of tank cars on rail due to the 
increased weight, and thus reduced capacity, of the cars.  A majority of the savings will accrue 
from implementation of the requirements that decrease the probability of death, and mitigation of 
potential injuries from accidents and derailments of trains that involve tank cars loaded with PIH 
materials.  In addition, savings would accrue from a decrease in railroad and other property 
damages, environmental remediation, track closures, road closures, and evacuations. 
 
For the 30-year period analyzed, the DOT PIH tank car proposal is estimated to have quantified 
costs totaling $1.566 billion with a PV (7%) of $827.2 million.  For a 3 percent discount rate the 
PV is $1.150 billion.  The benefits for this base case are estimated to total $1.6 billion.  Over the 
30-year period, the PV (7 %) of the estimated benefit is $744 million.  For a 3 percent discount 
rate the PV is $1.242 billion.   
 
The AAR Interchange Standard reflects the Trinity-like tank car.  This is the baseline alternative 
in the analysis.  It reflects the costs and benefits that the industry has and would spend to replace 
the PIH tank car fleet with aTrinity-like tank car.  For this alternative, the total costs would be 
$1.05 billion, with a PV (7%) of $476.6 million.  For a 3 percent discount rate the PV is $719 
million.  The total potential benefits for this case would be $276 million, with a PV of $79 
million.  For a 3 percent discount rate the PV is $153.7 million. 
 
The true regulatory impact from this rulemaking would be the DOT proposal minus the AAR 
proposal.  The the true regulatory cost for the DOT proposed alternative is $350.6 million (PV 

9

7%) and with a PV(3%) $432 million.  The true benefits for the DOT proposal would be $666 
million (PV 7%) and a PV (3%) of $1.089 billion.   
 
The results of this analysis are sensitive to the various inputs and assumptions used to estimate 
costs and benefits.  For instance, the results could change if the total incremental costs for 
incorporating the new crashworthiness features were significantly different.  Given that this 
proposed rule contains performance standards and not prescriptive design standards, it is possible 
that tank car manufacturers may be able to develop compliant designs that are less expensive.  
Another potential source of uncertainty affecting the level of compliance costs is future demand 
level for PIH materials.  The degree and direction of any such fluctuation(s) over the 30-year 
period of this analysis is not predictable with any reasonable degree of confidence.   
 
In addition, the value of a statistical life that is used for estimating safety benefits can also affect 
the overall cost benefit comparison and thus the outcome of this analysis.  This analysis shows 
the differences from using different values for a Value of a Statistical Life (VSL).  Specifically, 
the analysis uses a value of $5.8 million.  It also shows what the benefit totals would be if the 
value was $2.6 million less, i.e., $3.2 million; and $2.6 million more, i.e., $8.4 million.   
 
Other sources of uncertainty can be more readily analyzed.  DOT conducted sensitivity analyses 
varying assumptions related to the value of a statistical life as well as accident severity 
projections used to estimate the benefits of the proposed rule.  The first addresses the uncertainty 
regarding the consequences from release of PIH materials resulting from train accidents.  This 
analysis is based on the assumption that the consequences of projected incidents will be of the 
same average severity as those in the past ten years.  It does not recognize how fortunate the 
circumstances surrounding recent past incidents have been.  Given the rarity of the occurrence of 
rail accidents resulting in the release of PIH materials from tank cars, and the high variability in 
the circumstances and consequences of such events, this sensitivity analysis is useful.  The 30-
year benefit estimates associated with this scenario are $586,624,122 (PV, 7%) 
and $926,731,141 (PV, 3%).  The second and third sensitivity analyses address the imprecision 
of assumptions regarding the value of a life, which affect the level of safety benefits (i.e., 
casualty mitigation) that would result from promulgation of the proposed rule.  Casualty 
mitigation benefits associated with this rulemaking were estimated using a value of statistical life 
of $5.8 million.  Thirty-year benefit estimates associated with values of a statistical life of $3.2 
million and $8.4 million would be $562,100,371 (PV, 7%, VSL: $3.2M), $587,952,000 (PV, 7%, 
VSL: $8.4M).   
 
 
This analysis provides estimates of what the potential savings could be from accidents or 
derailments in which PIH tank cars do not lose their integrity as a result of implementing the 
proposed provisions.  Such benefits include lives saved, injuries averted, evacuations avoided, 
environmental cleanup averted, track and road closures avoided, and property and business 
damages avoided.  Other significant societal benefits are discussed, but their value is translated 
into monetary terms only to the extent it was possible to do so with the information available.  
This analysis also includes benefits associated with the fact that the proposed operating 
restrictions would produce absolute economic (non-accident related) benefits in terms of fuel 
savings.  Finally, this analysis estimates that tank cars built to the proposed standards will have a 

 

 

10 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

significantly higher residual value at the end of the period analyzed (more crashworthy cars will 
likely not be scrapped at the same rate as current cars).   
 
It is important to note, as several commenters at the public meetings relating to this rule have 
stated, that the tank car is only one component of the rail transportation system, and no single 
component of the system can provide the entire means to improving tank car safety.  
 
4.0  Background 
 
The most recent statistics available indicate that there are approximately 1.7 million tank car 
shipments of hazardous materials in the United States and Canada annually.  “Class 2 liquefied 
compressed gasses (LPG, anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, propane, and vinyl chloride) were 
among the top 10 shipments of hazardous materials commodities transported by tank car.”5   
 
During an NTSB hearing in July of 2002, an AAR official stated that the North American in-
service tank car fleet totaled about 280,000 cars.  At the same time, AAR provided data 
indicating that there were approximately 59,344 pressurized tank cars in service.  According to 
AAR, of that number, 23,919 were built after January 1, 1989, and were manufactured from 
normalized steel.6 

 

There are over 20 hazardous materials considered to be PIH that are shipped by rail in tank car 
quantities.  However, chlorine and anhydrous ammonia represent over 78 percent of the total PIH 
shipments.  In 2003, over 77,000 tank car loads of PIH materials were shipped by rail, and 
ammonia and chlorine represented 39.6 percent and 39.05 percent, respectively.  Ethylene oxide 
represented 9.4 percent of the shipped loads in 2003.   
 
The vast majority of hazardous materials shipped every year by rail tank car arrive safely and 
without incident.  For example, in the year 2004, when there were approximately 1.7 million 
shipments of hazardous materials by rail, there were only 29 train accidents in which a hazardous 
material was released.  As a result of these accidents, a total of 47 hazardous material cars 
released some amount of product.  The likelihood of a release for 2004 was a small fraction of a 
percent (47/1,700,000, or 0.0028 percent).  This suggests that there is a low probability of these 
types of accidents/incidents occurring.  Nevertheless, the severity of the accidents that do occur 
can be very high. 
 
4.1  Major PIH Accidents 1996 - 2005 
 
As noted in section 2 above, in the last several years, there have been a number of rail tank car 
accidents in which tank cars transporting PIH materials were breached resulting in catastrophic 
releases of PIH materials.  Athough none of these accidents was caused by the hazardous 
materials tank cars, the failure of the tank cars involved led to fatalities, injuries, evacuations, 
property and environmental damage.

Graniteville, SC, January 6, 2005  
The Graniteville crash killed 9 people and injured more than 550 people.  It was the deadliest 
train wreck involving hazardous material in nearly three decades.  At 2:39 a.m., a train traveling 
at approximately 47 mph, crashed into a locomotive and two cars on a siding in Graniteville, 
South Carolina.  The shell of a railroad tank car containing chlorine was punctured by the 
coupler of another car and instantaneously released approximately 9,220 gallons of chlorine, 
creating a toxic vapor plume that engulfed the surrounding area.  The release occurred in 
commercial and residential areas of the city.  Approximately 5,400 residents were evacuated 
from a 1-mile radius around the accident site.  About 554 people complaining of respiratory 
difficulties were taken to local hospitals.  Of those, 75 were admitted for treatment.  Nine people 
died from exposure to chlorine gas.7  Fifteen people were placed on ventilators in intensive care 
units.  Twenty-five people were hospitalized for more than 3 days.  Twenty-six people were 
hospitalized for 1 to 2 days.  There were 68 repeat visits to the emergency department, 58 people 
with significant symptoms, and 98 with moderate symptoms.  Forty-one people who visited the 
emergency department were released and 13 people were treated at a physician’s office.8   
 
Macdona, Texas, June 28, 2004 
At approximately 5:03 am on June 28, 2004, a Union Pacific (UP) freight train collided with a 
BNSF train on the Del Rio subdivision near Macdona, Texas.  It was dawn on a cloudy day with 
a light wind and 77 degrees Farenheit.  The accident derailed 4 locomotives and 19 cars on the 
UP train and 17 cars on the BNSF train.   
 
As a result of the derailment and pileup of railcars, a pressurized tank car containing chlorine 
was punctured in the lower quadrant of the tank car head.  Chlorine escaping from the punctured 
car immediately vaporized into a cloud of chlorine gas that engulfed the accident area to a radius 
of at least 700 feet before drifting away from the site.  Approximately 9,400 gallons of chlorine 
was released from the tank car.  Three persons, including the conductor of the UP train and two 
local residents, died as a result of exposure to chlorine gas.  The UP train engineer, 23 civilians, 
and 6 emergency responders were treated for respiratory distress or other injuries related to the 
incident.   
 
An evacuation zone was established around the accident site with a radius of about 2 miles.  
Over 60 people were evacuated from their homes and a camping area near the accident site.  
 
Minot, North Dakota, January 18, 2002 
At approximately 1:37 am on January 18, 2002, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailed 
31 of its 112 cars about a half-mile west of the city limits of Minot, North Dakota.  Eleven of the 
31 derailed cars were pressurized tank cars transporting anhydrous ammonia.  Five of those tank 
cars received sidewall impacts to their shells, causing the cars to catastrophically rupture.  
Approximately 146,700 gallons of anhydrous ammonia were released from those cars and a 
cloud of hydrolyzed ammonia formed almost immediately.  This plume rose an estimated 300

feet and gradually expanded 5 miles downwind of the accident site and over a population of 
about 11,600 people.   
 
One resident was fatally injured; 11 people sustained serious injuries; and 322 people, including 
2 train crewmembers, sustained minor injuries.  Railroad property damages exceeded $2 million, 
and more than $8 million has been spent for environmental remediation.  In addition, other costs 
were incurred that are not quantified here such as liability payments and disruption to non-
railroad businesses and community activities.  Fatal and serious injuries were comparatively low, 
given the potential presented by the plume, as a result of a prompt decision by the incident 
commander to order shelter in place and by the fact that the incident occurred at approximately 
1:37 am, a time when most residents were in their homes and activity on public streets was 
minimal.  Over the next 5 days, another 74,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia were released 
from the six other anhydrous ammonia tank cars. 
 
The NTSB reported that approximately 20 homes in a half-mile radius immediately east of the 
derailment site were evacuated.  The FRA investigation notes that approximately 100 people 
were evacuated.  This evacuation went on for over 41 days (January 18, 2002 to February 27, 
2002).  Approximately 10,000 people were required to shelter in place.9 
 
Alberton, Montana, April 11, 1996  
At 4:10 a.m., 19 cars from a Montana Rail Link (MRL) freight train derailed.  Six of the derailed 
cars contained hazardous materials.  One of the derailed tank cars containing chlorine ruptured, 
releasing 130,000 pounds of chlorine into the atmosphere.  About 1,000 people from the 
surrounding area were evacuated.  The Alberton derailment killed 1 person and injured 350 
others.   
 
In addition to the chlorine that was released during this accident, other hazardous materials were 
also released.  This included 17,000 gallons of potassium cresylate solution and 85 dry gallons of 
sodium chlorate. 
 
4.2 
 
The Secretary of Transportation has authority over all areas of railroad transportation safety (49 
U.S.C. §§ 20101 et seq.), and has delegated this authority to FRA (49 CFR § 1.49).  Pursuant to 
its statutory authority, the FRA promulgates and enforces a comprehensive regulatory program 
(49 CFR parts 200-244) covering all aspects of railroad operations.  FRA inspects railroads and 
shippers of hazardous materials for compliance with both FRA and PHMSA regulations.  FRA 
also conducts research and development to enhance railroad safety. 
 
Since the 1970s, DOT has issued a number of regulations to improve the survivability of tank 
cars in accidents.  In these rulemakings, DOT required the installation of a tank-head puncture 
resistance system (head protection), a coupler vertical restraint system (shelf couplers), 
insulation, and a thermal protection system for certain high-risk hazardous materials.  The safety

approximately one day for this analysis. DOT is assuming a value of $50 per person per day for a value of sheltering

record indicates that these systems, working in combination, have greatly reduced the potential 
harm to human health and the environment when railroad accidents and derailments involving 
tank cars occur.  
 
On August 10, 2005, Congress passed Public Law 109-59 (SAFETEA-LU), which added section 
20155 to the Federal hazmat law.  See 49 U.S.C. § 20155.  Reiterating in part NTSB’s 
recommendations from the 2002, Minot, North Dakota accident, § 20155 required FRA to (1) 
validate a predictive model quantifying the relevant dynamic forces acting on railroad tank cars 
under accident conditions, and (2) initiate a rulemaking to develop and implement appropriate 
design standards for pressurized tank cars.   
 
On May 24, 2006, PHMSA and FRA announced that they were initiating a comprehensive 
review of design and operational factors that affect the safety of railroad tank car transportation 
of hazardous materials.10  In order to facilitate public involvement in this review, FRA 
established a public docket (docket no. FRA-2006-25169) to provide interested parties with a 
central location to both send and review relevant information concerning the safety of railroad 
tank car transportation of hazardous materials.11   In addition, PHMSA and FRA held public 
meetings from May 31 to June 1, 2006, on December 14, 2006, and on March 30, 2007.12  The 
primary purpose of the first meeting was to surface and prioritize issues relating to the safe and 
secure transportation of PIH hazardous materials by railroad tank car.  The primary purpose of 
the second meeting was to solicit input and comments in response to specific questions posed by 
the DOT agencies.  The primary purpose of the third public meeting was for FRA to share its 
preliminary research results regarding tank car survivability and to provide an update on the 
agency’s progress towards developing an enhanced tank car standard.  Transcripts of these public 
meetings are available in the docket of this proceeding. 
 
4.3 
 
The shell of a tank car is made from rolled plates of steel that are welded to form a cylinder.  
Pressed or spun steel tank heads are welded to the ends of the cylinder to form the completed 
tank.  A stub sill and body bolster arrangement -the structural member for the couplers and draft 
gear and the attachment point for the wheel sets for the tank car—is attached to the underside of 
the tank at both ends of the tank.  Other appurtenances such as brake system components are 
welded to pads that are, in turn, welded to the tank shell to improve stress distribution.  A jacket 
consisting of 12 gauge steel, is often installed on the outside of the tank.  Typically a layer of 
insulation, fire retardant material, or both are placed between the jacket and the tank car shell. 
  
It is important to note that all pressure tank cars, including the class 105 and 112 tank cars built 
since January 1, 1989, have been required to have tank shell and heads constructed of normalized 
steel.  The five tank cars that had catastrophic shell failures in the Minot accident in January, 
2002 were built before 1989 and had tank shells fabricated from non-normalized steel.13  
“Normalized” steel is steel that has been subjected to a specific heat treatment procedure that

improves the steel’s ability to resist fracture.  Current standards allow for the use of non-
normalized steel tank cars until 2029.14  The tank car punctured in the Graniteville accident, 
however, was manufactured after 1989 and built of out of newer, more ductile, normalized steel, 
leading NTSB to conclude that “even the strongest tank cars in service can be punctured in 
accidents involving trains operating at moderate speeds.”15  At the same time, a tank car 
manufactured in 1979 and built out of the same type of steel used in the failed Minot cars 
survived the Graniteville derailment with no loss of product. 
 
4.4 
 
Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) is transported as a liquefied compressed gas in pressurized rail tank 
cars.  It is a compound formed by the combination of two gaseous elements, nitrogen and 
hydrogen.  If it is released, it vaporizes and expands rapidly to return to a gaseous state.  The 
boiling point of anhydrous ammonia is -28 degrees F.  Anhydrous means “without water.”  
Because NH3 contains little or no water, it is attracted to any form of moisture.16 
 
 
Ammonia was first produced from the nitrogen in the air in 1909 through the Haber Process, 
which was developed by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch.  This process was patented in 1910.  The 
main uses of ammonia are in the production of fertilizers, explosives, and the synthesis of 
organonitrogen compounds.  The most familiar use of ammonia to the general public is as an 
active ingredient in household glass cleaners.  The first industrial use of ammonia was by the 
Germans during World War I.  A blockade cut off the supply of nitrates from Chile.  The 
Germans then used it to produce explosives to sustain their war effort.17 
  
Under DOT regulations, (49 CFR Parts 171 - 180), anhydrous ammonia is classified and 
regulated for domestic shipments as a nonflammable gas, but is designated as an “inhalation 
hazard.”   
 
Ammonia is highly irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract.  Exposure to ammonia can cause 
swelling and narrowing of the throat and bronchi, coughing, and an accumulation of fluid in the 
lungs can occur.  Ammonia causes rapid onset of a burning sensation in the eyes, nose, and 
throat accompanied by lacrimation [discharge of tears], rhinorrhea [runny nose] and coughing.  
Upper airway swelling and pulmonary edema may lead to airway obstruction.  Prolonged skin 
contact can cause pain and corrosive injury. 
 
Anhydrous ammonia is an important source of nitrogen fertilizer for crops.  If it is handled 
improperly, it can have catastrophic results on plants and farm workers.18  It is used in farming 
because it is one of the most efficient and widely used sources of nitrogen for plant growth.  It is 
relatively easy to apply and readily available, and thus, the use of it has increased.  It also carries 
disadvantages to the farming environment because it must be stored and handled under high

pressure.  Workers must be trained to handle it and to follow strict work procedures to ensure 
operator safety.  It is the most dangerous chemical on the farm.19 Anhydrous ammonia is also 
used for other uses beyond agriculture and fertilization.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the 
production of explosives.  In fact, it is so important that it is basic to the process of 
manufacturing approximately 95 percent of all commercial explosives.  There is no substitute for 
it in the production of these products.20 
 
Anhydrous ammonia is one of the gases used in the continuous cycle cooling units found in 
domestic refrigerators, recreational vehicles, and the year-round air conditioning of homes and 
large commercial buildings.  Since the early 1900s, ammonia has been a primary transfer 
medium to refrigerate large, cold storage facilities.  This accounts for less than 2 percent of the 
ammonia produced in the United States today.     
 
Anhydrous ammonia is used in the manufacturing of nitric acid; certain alkalies such as soda 
ash; dyes; pharmaceuticals such as sulfa drugs, vitamins and cosmetics; synthetic textile fibers 
such as nylon, rayon and acrylics; and for the manufacturing of certain plastics such as phenolics 
and polyurethanes.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the rubber industry for the stabilization 
of natural and synthetic latex to prevent premature coagulation.  These industrial uses for 
anhydrous ammonia account for less than 18 percent of its total annual consumption. 
 
Most anhydrous ammonia plants are dependent on natural gas for production.  Therefore, the 
North America anhydrous ammonia production plants are typically built near a dedicated supply 
of natural gas.  The price and demand for the product are also dependent on and responsive to the 
price of natural gas; thus, the production at some plants is currently down due to the price of 
natural gas.  On the demand side of the economic equation, there is an increase in the demand 
and use of anhydrous ammonia due to the recent increase in the demand for ethanol.  Ethanol is 
typically produced in the United States from corn, and the production of corn needs a lot of 
nitrogen, which typically comes from anhydrous ammonia. 
 
Chlorine (Cl) was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1774.  It was given its name by 
Humphry Davy in 1810.  The physical form of the pure chemical element is a diatomic green 
gas.  In its liquid form it is a powerful oxidizing, bleaching, and disinfecting agent.  The boiling 
point for chlorine is -34.6 °C (238.55 K, -30.279997 °F).  The element is a member of the 
halogen family which commonly form salts.  In its gas form, chlorine readily combines with 
other elements.21 
 

Chlorine is used as an elemental disinfectant for over 84 percent of large drinking water systems 
(those serving more than 10,000 people), according to the American Water Works Association.  
For pharmaceuticals, chlorine chemistry is essential to manufacturing 85 percent of their 
products.  Chlorine chemistry is also used in 25 percent of all medical plastics, and 70 percent of 
all disposable medical applications.  The single largest use of chlorine is for the production of

polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is used for building and construction materials such as siding, 
windows, pipes, decks and fences.22  
 
Chlorine is a respiratory irritant.  The gas irritates the mucous membranes and the liquid burns 
the skin.  As little as 3.5 parts per million (ppm) can be detected as an odor, and 1,000 ppm is 
likely to be fatal after a few deep breaths.  It is not found in a free state in nature, but is found 
commonly as NaCl (solid or seawater). 
 
It is rarely necessary to make chlorine in the laboratory since it is readily available commercially 
in cylinders.  Chlorine is found largely in seawater where it exists as sodium chloride.  It is 
recovered as a reactive, corrosive, pale green chlorine gas from brine (a solution of sodium 
chloride in water) by electrolysis.23 
 
Chlorine gas or liquid is not explosive or flammable, but it will support combustion.  Chlorine is 
only slightly soluble in water.  The gas has a characteristic, penetrating odor, a greenish yellow 
color and is about two and one-half times as heavy as air.  Thus, if chlorine escapes from a 
container or system, it will tend to seek the lowest level in the building or area in which the leak 
occurs.24 
 
The vaporization of liquefied chlorine at 32 degrees Fahrenheit at atmospheric pressure can 
generate a gaseous cloud with a volume 450 times greater than the volume of the liquid released. 
 
In the United States, there are 35 chlorine production plants.  The largest number of these plants 
is in the State of Louisiana.  In the United States, there are 63 chlorine packing plants. 
 
Ethylene Oxide(EtO) is a colorless, flammable gas or refrigerated liquid with a faintly sweet 
odor and dissolves easily in water.  It is a manmade chemical and it is an important industrial 
chemical used as an intermediate in the production of ethylene glycol (a chemical used to make 
antifreeze and polyester) pasticisers, humectants, cosmetics, ointments, pharmaceutical 
preparations and brake fluids.  Ethylene oxide gas kills bacteria, mold, and fungi and is widely 
used to sterilize medical supplies such as bandages, sutures, and surgical implements.  Ethylene 
oxide is usually stored as a pressurized or refrigerated liquid.  At room temperature and pressure, 
it rapidly evaporates, potentially causing frostbite in cases of skin exposure. 
 
Ethylene oxide was first prepared in 1859 by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz, who 
prepared it by treating 2-chloroethanol with a base.  It achieved industrial importance during 
World War I as a precursor to both the coolant ethylene glycol and the chemical weapon mustard 
gas.  In 1931, Theodore Lefort, another French chemist, discovered a means to prepare ethylene 
oxide directly from ethylene and oxygen, using silver as a catalyst. 
 
Ethylene oxide is also an irritant to skin and the respiratory tract, and inhaling the vapors may 
cause the lungs to fill with fluid several hours after exposure.

NTSB Recommendations 

 
Other PIH materials transported by railroad tank car include:  anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, 
sulfur dioxide, fuming sulfuric acid, methyl mercaptan, hydrogen chloride (refrigerated liquid), 
stabilized sulfur trioxide, stabilized acetone cyanohydrin, stabilized hydrogen cyanide, 
phosphorus trichloride, chlorosulforic acid, methyl bromide, dimethyl sulfate, allyl alcohol, 
bromine, and titanium tetrachloride.  Among these PIH materials, in 2005 anhydrous hydrogen 
fluoride accounted for almost 4% of PIH shipments by railroad tank car, sulfur dioxide 
accounted for slightly over 2%, fuming sulfuric acid and methyl mercaptan accounted for a little 
over 1% each, and the remaining materials each accounted for only a tiny fraction of PIH 
shipments by railroad tank car (i.e., less than 1% each).  
 
Although these PIH materials each constitute only a small percentage of the total PIH materials 
shipped by rail, each presents its own unique hazards.  For example, hydrogen fluoride, which is 
used as a catalyst for petroleum processing and in the manufacture of aluminum and various 
refrigerants and propellants, constitutes under 4% of PIH shipments by railroad tank car, 
however, it is substantially more toxic than ethylene oxide (which constitutes approximately 
10% of PIH rail tank car shipments).   
 
 
4.5 
 
The NTSB investigated three recent accidents involving tank cars transporting PIH materials 
which occurred between 2002 and 2005 in Minot, North Dakota; Macdona, Texas; and 
Graniteville, South Carolina.  In its reports for the Minot and Graniteville accidents/incidents, the 
NTSB recommended that FRA study improving the safety and structural integrity of tank cars 
and develop necessary operational measures to minimize the vulnerability of tank cars involved 
in an accident. 
 
On March 15, 2004, the NTSB released seven Safety Recommendations to FRA as a result of the 
Minot accident.  Four of these recommendations (R-04-04, R-04-05, R-04-06, and R 04-07) 
concern tank car structural integrity and as discussed in the preamble to the NPRM served as the 
basis for the reformulation of FRA’s tank car research program. 
 
On December 12, 2005, the NTSB released Safety Recommendations R-05-14 through R-05-17 
as a result of the Graniteville accident.  Three of these recommendations (R-05-15, R-05-16, and 
R-05-17) related to operating speeds in non-signaled territory, as well as the transportation of 
PIH materials and other hazardous materials that may pose inhalation hazards in the event of 
unintentional release.  In addition, the NTSB repeated its concern for crashworthiness integrity 
of railroad tank cars by restating what they said, in part, in response to the Minot accident: 

 

 
Improvements  in  the  crashworthiness  of  pressure  tank  cars  can  be  realized 
through  the  evaluation  of  alternative  steels  and  tank  car  performance  standards.  
The  ultimate  goal  of  this  effort  should  be  the  construction  of  railroad  tank  cars 
that  have  sufficient  impact  resistance  and  that  eliminate  the  risk  of  catastrophic 
brittle failures under all operating conditions and in all environments.  Achieving 
such  a  goal  does  not  necessarily  require  the  construction  of  a  tank  car  that  is 

18 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

puncture-proof;  it  may  only  require  construction  of  a  car  that  will  remain  intact 
and slowly leak its contents if it is punctured. 

Industry Efforts and Initiatives 

 
On July 20, 2006, the NTSB released Safety Recommendations R-06-14 and R-06-15 as a result 
of the Macdona accident.  Although neither recommendation specifically addressed the 
vulnerability of tank cars involved in an accident, the NTSB stated that the successful and timely 
implementation of its Safety Recommendations from the Minot accident and Graniteville 
accident may have prevented/mitigated the Macdona accident and any future catastrophic 
releases of hazardous materials from pressurized tank cars involved in accidents/incidents and 
derailments.   
 
4.6 
 
AAR 
In early 2006, the Safety and Operations Management Committee (SOMC) of the AAR directed 
the AAR’s Tank Car Committee (TCC) to consider improved packaging for the shipment of 
chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  Specifically, the SOMC directed the TCC to “present a plan 
for developing performance standards for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia tank cars that would 
reduce the probability of a release, given an accident, by a target of 65 percent from the current 
values and a plan to phase in the new improved cars within a target time frame of 5-7 years.”25   
 
The goal of a 65 percent reduction was based on research performed by the University of Illinois, 
which concluded that utilizing existing technology, the probability of a release of anhydrous 
ammonia and/or chlorine from a tank car involved in an accident could be reduced by 65 percent 
or more by substituting enhanced tank cars for the cars currently used to transport these 
materials.  The enhanced tank cars contemplated in the University of Illinois research are the 
thicker, heavier, chlorine tank car design proposed by Trinity.  The University of Illinois findings 
are premised on replacing the current 263,000 pound cars for anhydrous ammonia and chlorine 
with 286,000-pound cars equipped with additional head protection, thicker shells, and modified 
top fittings protection. 
 
As a result of discussions with industry, on July 28, 2006, the TCC issued Casualty Prevention 
Circular 1175 (CPC-1175), which recommended that the proposal set forth by AAR member 
railroads and Trinity be implemented.26  Significantly, this proposal contemplated that 50 percent 
of a car owner’s fleet of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine cars would be replaced with the 
“enhanced cars” within approximately 6 years, with their entire fleets being replaced within 
approximately 11 years.  In response to CPC-1175, several members of the hazardous materials 
shipping industry submitted comments to the AAR expressing concern with certain aspects of 
the proposal.  
 

                                                 
25 TCC Docket T 87.2 (April 2006). 
26 The proposal suggested that anhydrous ammonia be transported in DOT 112J500W tank cars, equipped with full-
height ½-inch thick or equivalent head shields and top fittings protection designed to withstand a rollover with a 
minimum linear velocity of 9 miles per hour.  Similarly, the proposal suggested that chlorine be transported in tank 
cars built to the 105J600W specification, equipped with full-height ½-inch thick or equivalent head shields and top 
fittings protection designed to withstand a rollover with a minimum linear velocity of 9 mph.   

19 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

In response to comments received, on October 18, 2006, the TCC issued Casualty Prevention 
Circular 1176 (CPC-1176), which adopted as a final TCC action the proposals set forth in CPC-
1175 with minor modifications to the implementation period initially proposed.  Specifically, the 
intermediate implementation goal of CPC-1175 (50 percent of the fleet by December 31, 2012) 
was eliminated and replaced by a requirement that the tank car owners’ plans for implementation 
be submitted to AAR by December 31, 2007.  Subsequently, on December 18, 2006, AAR issued 
Casualty Prevention Circular 1178 (CPC-1178) in response to appeals to CPC-1176.  Although 
various aspects of CPC-1176 were appealed (e.g., the proposed implementation schedule, top 
fittings arrangement, and the scientific basis of the proposed design), CPC-1178 is substantially 
the same as CPC-1176, except the target implementation dates were delayed by 1 year (i.e., tank 
car owners’ plans for implementation were required to be submitted by December 31, 2008, and 
tank cars were required to be 100 percent fleet compliant by December 31, 2018). 
 
While the shipping community does not fully support the AAR’s proposed interchange standard, 
there is a commitment by a coalition of chemical manufacturers to replace the entire American 
chlorine fleet by 2017 with tank cars that are more secure and safe. 
 
The AAR has also developed a detailed protocol on recommended railroad operating practices 
for the transportation of hazardous materials.  The AAR issued the most recent version of this 
document, known as Circular OT-55-I, on July 17, 2006.  The Circular details railroad operating 
practices for, among other things, designating certain trains as “key trains,” including trains 
containing five tank car loads or more of PIH materials.  The Circular further designates 
operating speed and equipment restrictions for key trains; “key routes” for key trains; standards 
for track inspection and wayside detectors on these “key routes”; yard operating practices for 
handling placarded tank cars; storage, loading, unloading and handling of loaded tank cars; 
assisting communities with emergency response training and information; shipper notification 
procedures; and the handling of time-sensitive materials.  These recommended practices were 
originally implemented by all of the Class I rail carriers operating in the United States; the most 
recent version of the Circular also includes shortline railroads as signatories. 
 
Dow/UP 
In October 2005, Dow and UP, Dow’s largest rail service provider, formed a partnership to 
address rail safety and security improvements.  Some of the specific goals of the agreement 
between UP and Dow include:  (1) reducing idle times for hazmat shipments by 50 percent in 
high-threat urban areas, (2) redesigning Dow’s customer supply chains to cut in half the amount 
of certain hazardous materials shipped by 2015, (3) eliminating all non-accidental leaks of 
certain hazardous materials in three years, and (4) monitoring shipments by satellite tracking tags 
and other sensors.27  As Dow noted at the May 31-June 1, 2006, PHMSA/FRA public meeting, 
the companies’ joint effort is focusing on six areas for improvement:  (1) supply chain redesign, 
(2) next generation rail tank car design, (3) improved shipment visibility, (4) a strengthened 
commitment to TRANSCAER®, (5) improved rail operations safety, and (6) hazardous material 
shipment routing.   
 
With regard to supply chain redesign, Dow is evaluating potential ways to reduce the number 
and distance of shipments involving high-hazard materials.  Dow is evaluating the potential for

co-location of production and consumption facilities; the use of pipelines instead of rail in some 
instances; and the conversion of highly hazardous products to less hazardous derivatives before 
shipping.28  At the same public meeting, Dow also noted that since 1999, the company has 
reduced the amount of chlorine it ships in the United States by 80 percent; noting the company’s 
current commitment that by 2015, Dow will have further reduced by 50 percent the number of 
shipments and container miles traveled by its shipments of highly hazardous materials (i.e., PIH 
materials and flammable gases).   
 
With regard to improving rail tank car design, Dow, UP, and the Union Tank Car Company, 
which had joined the Dow/UP Partnership specifically to participate on the Next Generation Rail 
Tank Car program (NGRTC), initiated the program for the stated purpose of collaborating on the 
design of a next generation railcar for the transportation of certain hazardous materials.  FRA has 
entered into a memorandum of cooperation with the NGRTC program under which the agency 
and the other parties share engineering, testing and other resources to develop and demonstrate a 
next-generation tank.  The project is a multi-generational project, with the first generation 
focusing on designing a breakthrough next generation tank car for the transport of PIH materials 
that will meet or exceed AAR TCC performance requirements and provide a five- to tenfold 
improvement in the safety and security performance of existing rail tank cars in PIH service.  
Subsequent generations of the project would build on the first generation to leverage the process, 
methodology, and criteria used in designing the next generation PIH tank car to design a tank car 
appropriate for other hazardous materials, such as flammable gases and environmentally- 
sensitive chemicals.  Dow’s stated goal is full implementation within Dow of a next generation 
PIH car by the end of 2014, and full implementation of further generations of tank cars for 
flammable gases and environmentally-sensitive chemicals by the end of 2029.  
 
This regulatory proposal seeks to carry forward these private initiatives within a framework that 
is consistent with the mandate of SAFETEA-LU, ensuring that all parties contribute to the 
reduction of risk, while addressing additional areas of need, such as existing risks in non-
signaled territory. 
 
5.0  Summary of Regulatory Change 
 
Approximately 1.7 million carloads of hazardous materials are transported by rail throughout the 
United States each year; equivalently thousands of carloads of hazardous materials are in transit 
every day.  About 139 rail carriers offer for transportation or transport hazardous (PIH) materials 
to which these regulatory clarifications and enhancements apply.  Of these, about 39 are large 
businesses, using definitions established for Class I and Class II (regional) rail carriers.29   
 
Through this NPRM, DOT is proposing revisions to the hazardous materials regulations that 
would improve the crashworthiness protection of railroad tank cars designed to transport PIH 
materials.  Specifically, the NPRM proposes enhanced tank car performance standards for head 
and shell impacts; operational speed restrictions for trains hauling PIH tank cars; interim 

                                                 
28 See Transcript of May 31-June 1, 2006, public meeting in docket no. FRA 25169. 
29 Class I railroads, as designated by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), are those railroads with operating 
revenues of $272 million or more.  Regional railroads, referred to as Class II, are those with at least 350 route miles 
and/or revenue of between $40 million and the Class I threshold. 

21 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

operational restrictions for tank cars with more stringent restrictions for those not meeting the 
enhanced performance standards proposed and operating in non-signaled territory; and an 
allowance to increase the gross weight of tank cars that meet the enhanced tank-head and shell 
standards.  
 
Specifically, the proposed performance standards for tank-head and shell puncture resistance 
systems provide industry with flexibility to take advantage of innovative materials and 
technologies.  The related proposed operational limitations would restrict the operating speed of 
all tank cars transporting PIH materials to a maximum speed of 50 mph.30  
 
As an interim measure, the proposed rule would also require tank cars that transport PIH 
materials, and do not meet the enhanced tank-head and shell puncture-resistance standards, to 
travel at speeds no higher than 30 mph in non-signaled “dark” territory.31  The 30 mph speed 
restriction is based on FRA’s finding that a disproportionate number of incidents resulting in loss 
of PIH material from head and shell punctures, cracks, and tears occurred at speeds greater than 
30 mph in non-signaled territory.  In lieu of complying with the 30 mph speed restriction, 
railroads would be allowed to implement alternative safety measures, such as switch position 
monitoring systems, track integrity circuits, enhanced operational safeguards, or positive train 
control, if those alternative measures provide an equivalent level of safety to a traffic control 
system and are authorized by FRA.  As tank cars meeting the enhanced performance standard 
enter use, this 30 mph restriction would be phased out.    
 
The rule would require tank cars that transport PIH materials to be designed and manufactured 
with tank-head and shell puncture-resistance systems capable of withstanding the proposed 
performance tests without loss of lading at a minimum 30 mph and 25 mph, respectively.  The 
relevant research undertaken for this rule indicates that in general, the secondary car-to-car 
impact speed is approximately one-half of initial train speed.  Therefore, requiring tank cars to 
withstand head and shell impacts of at least 25 mph and limiting the speed of those tank cars to 
50 mph ensures that, in most instances, a tank car would not be breached if involved in a 
derailment or other similar type of accident.  The higher impact speed proposed for the tank-head 
protection system is to take into account instances where the end of the tank car is involved in a 
primary collision as can occur in yards or in sidings.  Compliance with the enhanced tank-head 
and shell puncture resistance systems can be shown by computer simulation modeling, by 
computer simulation in conjunction with sub-component testing, by full-scale impact testing, 
with appropriate FRA review of the modeling and testing plan, or a combination thereof. 
 
The proposed rule would also authorize, without the need for special permit, an increase in the 
gross weight of tank cars from 263,000 pounds to 286,000 pounds to offset the potentially 
increased weight of an enhanced tank car.  This measure should enable shippers to continue 
meeting customer demands without significantly increasing the total number of PIH shipments.  
Tank cars that exceed the 263,000 pound weight limitation must comply with the AAR standard 

                                                 
30   This operating restriction is different from industry standards.  AAR interchange rules only require that Key 
trains with 5 or more PIH tank cars in them be restricted 50 mph.  Since it is an industry standard for AAR members 
this recommendation would not cover small and medium sized railroads. 
31   No industry standard or requirments restrict trains carrying PIH materials to 30 mph in non-signaled (dark) 
territory.

relating to the design, construction, and operation of rail cars with gross weights between 
263,000 pounds and 286,000 pounds.  This AAR industry standard would be incorporated by 
reference into the proposed rule through the Federal hazardous material regulations (49 CFR 
Parts 171- 185).

6.0  Purpose and Methodology of this Economic Analysis 
 
The purpose of this economic analysis is to analyze the costs and benefits of the proposed rule 
and discuss feasible alternatives to the Federal hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR Parts 
171 - 185).  For a 30-year period, this analysis assesses the proposed rule’s known and 
foreseeable costs and benefits, which would likely impact society as a result of this proposed 
regulation.  The exact 30-year period which this analysis covers is not specifically set forth 
because of uncontrollable factors in the rulemaking process. 33  The costs are assessed in terms of 

                                                 
32 In lieu of complying with the 30 mph speed restriction, railroads may implement alternative safety measures, if 
those alternative measures provide an equivalent level of safety to a traffic control system and are authorized by 
FRA. 
33  The precise 30 year period is not noted in this RIA because the exact publication date of the final rule is not

“changes in” the current regulatory burden being added or removed by these proposed rule 
changes.  In economics, this type of analysis is referred to as a marginal analysis.     
 
This economic analysis adheres to methodologies historically followed and accepted at the DOT.  
It is in consistent with the guidelines in DOT’s “Regulatory Policies and Procedures”34; 
Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review” and amendments35; and the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB) Circular A-4 on “Regulatory Analysis.”36   
 
The results of this analysis are a product of the assumptions, estimates, theories, methodologies 
and procedures utilized in it.  This information is provided either in the text, footnotes, or in an 
appendix for transparency reasons.  This transparency should assist interested parties by 
providing greater access to the information used to determine, assess, and estimate impacts.  In 
general, this type of information should assist in improving the transparency of the regulatory 
process. 
 
Data and calculations used in this analysis are provided so that the reader may replicate the 
analysis and quantify the assessments using information and data discussed and noted 
assumptions. 
 
All of the spreadsheets for this analysis have been developed using an off-the-shelf software 
package.  Some rounding of numbers has been performed for the sake of presentation clarity. 
 
Quantitative methodologies such as this benefit-cost analysis are a useful way of organizing and 
comparing the favorable and unfavorable effects of proposed regulations such as this one.  A 
benefit-cost analysis does not provide the policy answer, but rather defines and displays a useful 
framework for debate and review.37  A benefit-cost analysis such as this analysis is intended to 
be a pragmatic instrument that is designed to ensure that the government and its relevant 
officials, and the public as a whole, view the consequences of the regulation.  In addition, it 
assists the process by focusing on neglected problems and it also ensures that limited resources 
will be focused in areas where they will do the most good.38

7.0  Assumptions and Inputs Used in this Analysis 
 
This economic analysis is based on certain assumptions, and unless otherwise noted the 
following assumptions apply to this analysis, its exhibits, and appendices.   
 
Sunk costs are not factored into this analysis, unless necessary for comparison purposes.  This 
analysis is based on changes in both the costs and benefits related to the rulemaking, over a 30-
year period of time for the railroad industry, hazardous material shippers, tank car manufacturers, 
the DOT, and those who are impacted by the release of PIH materials from rail tank cars 
involved in derailments and collisions.  Several key assumptions in the analysis are presented 
here: 

 

  The PV of cost and benefit flows are calculated in this analysis.  PV provides a way of 

converting future benefits and costs into equivalent dollars today.  Consequently, it 
permits comparisons of benefit and cost streams that involve different time paths.  The 
formula used to calculate these flows is:  1/(1+I)t where “I” is the discount rate, and “t” is 
the year.  Discount rate of 7% and 3% are used.39   

 
  Cost estimates for the manufacturers’ redesign and engineering for the proposed features, 

and the labor and supplies for the marginal changes necessary to build the proposed 
features are based on input from the DOT’s Volpe Center, FRA, and PHMSA.  These 
estimates are not a straight average of the cost estimates that might have been provided, 
but rather DOT’s best approximation given the available information, its knowledge of 
the situation, and its experience with the redesign of other railroad equipment imposed by 
prior rulemakings.   The cost estimates also include impacts for the DOT proposed 
operating restrictions. 

 
  An important assumption in this analysis is that PIH tank cars with the same set of 

characteristics have the same accident performance. 

 
  PHMSA and FRA will be assuming that the proposed PIH tank cars can be built to the 

286,000-pound standard and that market standard trucks are on the cars. 

 
  The average hourly rate for railroad workers for this proposed rule is $30.05.  This rate 

includes benefits and overhead.  FRA uses this rate of pay as being the value of the 
services rendered by an employee to a railroad employer.40

Scenarios 

 
8.0  Research and Analysis of Tank Car Crashworthiness 
      
When a tank car is damaged in an accident or derailment, it can lose lading in one of several 
different ways.  These include:  (1) through a rupture or breach in the tank shell, (2) through a 
rupture or breach in the tank head, and (3) through damaged bottom fittings or top fittings (if 
present).  Review of accident data from 1965 forward shows that the predominant cause of loss 
of life from release of these products is from compromise of the tank head or shell.43  
 
8.1 
 
There are two train operation disruption scenarios that are being targeted for tank car 
crashworthiness performance improvement over the current-conventional tank cars.  The 
proposed performance standards target these scenarios for a decrease in the likelihood that tank 
cars would lose their integrity or rupture during the events.  The type of events are derailments 
and train-to-train collisions. 
 
Derailment  
 
The secondary car-to-car interactions that occur in derailments are head and shell impacts.  
These car interaction modes were determined through the conduct of numerical simulations in 
response to NTSB recommendations from the 2002 Minot, North Dakota derailment as well as 
through a review of historical accident consequences.  The loss of some lading through fittings, 
although more common than the catastrophic breaches in the head or side of the tank car, usually 
results in much smaller quantities of lost material.  FRA continues research into the development 
of improved fitting protection, but this aspect will not be part of this rulemaking. 
 
As discussed in the preamble of the NPRM, a key result from Volpe’s collision dynamic 
modeling of derailments is that the secondary car-to-car impact speeds are one-half the initial 
train speed.  This is important because, if as proposed, all tank cars that transport PIH materials 
are restricted to a maximum speed of 50 mph and the protection afforded by a performance 
standard of at least 25 mph protects to train speeds of 50 mph, then together these requirements 
should prevent the significant loss of PIH material in future train incidents involving newly 
designed tank cars.  
 
 
Train-to-Train Collision  
                                                 
42 The DOT estimates the willingness to pay to avoid a fatality to be $5.8 million per life.  This value was most 
recently increased in February 2008. 
43  This is an important difference with the approach of the University of Illinois utilized by the AAR to structure its 
own tank car initiative.  Although PHMSA and FRA agree that reduction of losses through valves and fittings is an 
important safety objective, as discussed in the Preamble to the NPRM, historical accident data demonstrates that top 
fittings are not a significant factor in attempting to reduce the risk associated with large product losses.  
Accordingly, depending on the outcome of DOT’s ongoing research and industry efforts, DOT will address this 
issue in a future rulemaking as appropriate.  

27 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 
The secondary car-to-car interactions of concern from train-to-train collisions include those 
discussed from derailments for tank cars situated some distance from the initial point of the train 
collision.  The collision modes are impacts to the head and shell. Again, the loss of lading 
through fittings can occur, but is of secondary concern for this rulemaking process and will be 
addressed, as appropriate, in the future by the ongoing research program.  An example of an 
accident that fits this scenario is the 2005 accident in Graniteville, South Carolina. 
 
As discussed above, the key result from the collision dynamic modeling of train-to-train 
collisions where the tank cars are situated some distance from the initial point of impact is that 
the secondary car-to-car impact speeds are one-half the initial train speed.  This is important 
because if, as proposed, all tank cars that transport PIH materials are restricted to a maximum 
speed of 50 mph, and the protection afforded by a performance standard of at least 25 mph 
protects against collisions resulting from train speeds up to 50 mph, then together these 
requirements protect against release resulting from most train-to-train collisions.  However, FRA 
realizes that there are other situations that may occur involving head impacts that will result in 
some instances where the head is contacted at speeds somewhat higher than 25 mph; for 
instance, impacts that occur in yards or sidings.  To help protect against such instances and 
because of greater space available for applying a head protection system, the performance 
standard requires that newly designed tank cars survive an impact at 30 mph.  This should 
prevent the significant loss of lading in future incidents for trains that have the newly designed 
equipment.  
 
Head Impact 
 
Research has been conducted by FRA, with support from the Volpe Center and in conjunction 
with the NGRTCP, to develop a number of candidate designs for head protection systems.  FRA 
is leveraging the knowledge gained through interactions with the NGRTCP to help develop costs 
and benefits associated with designing a tank-head protection system that is compliant with the 
proposed performance standards.   
 
The key strategy chosen by FRA and the Volpe Center for the new design is to increase the 
energy absorption capacity of the tank-head protection system so as to maintain commodity tank 
integrity under the prescribed impact condition.  By allowing for tank integrity to be maintained, 
FRA is helping designers from the perspective that they can now apply commonly used elastic-
plastic large deformation modeling techniques while developing a new design.  By excluding 
material failure on the commodity tank, FRA and the tank car designers have significantly 
increased confidence in the results from the required numerical simulations. 
 
Technologies that can be applied to improve the tank-head puncture resistance performance 
include stiffened jackets with an underlying energy absorbing layer in the interstitial space where 
insulation typically is placed, as well as stiffening the commodity tank with external stiffeners.  
The goal of the system is to blunt the initial impact at the jacket layer and spread the load over as 
large an area as possible to engage as much energy absorbing material that lies between the outer 
jacket and the inner commodity tank.  The goal is to have the load “footprint” bearing directly 

28 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

into the commodity tank be significantly larger than the initial impact “imprint.”  The larger this 
difference is, the better it is in terms of the commodity tank’s ability to resist the load. 
 
In order to develop a compliant design, FRA research suggests that commonly used materials 
and fabrication techniques already used in the tank car industry as well as other transportation 
modes can be used.  
 
Shell Impact 
 
Again, FRA is leveraging the knowledge gained through interactions with the NGRTCP to help 
develop costs and benefits associated with designing a side or shell protection system that is 
compliant with the proposed performance standard. 
 
The key strategy as discussed above for tank-head protection systems is to increase the energy 
absorption capacity of the side or shell protection system so as to maintain commodity tank 
integrity under the prescribed impact condition.  Designers can apply commonly used elastic-
plastic large deformation modeling techniques while developing a new design.  The exclusion of 
material failure on the commodity tank significantly increases the confidence in the results from 
the required numerical simulations.

difference the better in terms of the commodity tanks ability to resist the load.

8.2 
 
Historically, DOT’s research on tank cars was obtained through studying the structural response 
of the “tank car head from a coupler impact.”  Such impacts were examined using dynamic, 
elastic-plastic finite element analysis.  Results from this method were validated using data from 
tank car head impact tests, which were conducted in the 1970s by the Railway Progress Institute 
and the AAR Tank Car Safety Research and Test Project.  FRA felt comfortable using the 
information gained from the historical tank head research to move forward with the current 
rulemaking without further baseline car testing of head impacts similar to what is prescribed in 
the performance standard.  Sufficient work/information is available. 
 
However, the same is not true for impacts to the side of a tank car.  There was no historical data 
available from testing or previous modeling results that could be used to assess the current 

Research, Analysis and Testing 

29 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

pressurized tank car designs baseline strength.  Therefore, FRA initiated research to study side 
impacts in conjunction with their research partners under the auspices of the NGRTCP.  
  
Nevertheless, general results can provide some useful insights.  For instance, the closing 
velocities between cars engaging in secondary contact appear to average about half the initial 
speed of the train.  Another noteworthy result is that train speed appears to be the most important 
variable.  With an increase in train speed, the number of derailed cars and the peak collision 
force also increase.   
 
Ultimately, the predictions from DOT’s analysis of tank shell accident survivability are intended 
to provide estimates of critical closing velocity, i.e., the lowest speed at which a car with lading 
would be penetrated.  From that point, the work will be directed toward assessment of risk that 
penetration might cause an unstable fracture.  The boundary between arrest and an unstable 
fracture is a function of penetration size and the car’s internal pressure. 
 
In conjunction with the NGRTCP, a series of side impact tests have been conducted to develop 
the level of performance of conventional tank cars under a prescribed impact condition that 
results in representative damage to the tank car compared with observations from historical 
accidents. Under this very stringent impact condition, the conventional car tested is able to 
withstand an impact at 10 mph. 
 
FRA has extensive data available from previous tests for head impacts and is using this as the 
basis for establishing the baseline level performance under the proposed performance standard 
impact condition.  Applying modeling methodologies developed in the side impact testing 
program, the predicted head performance under the proposed stringent impact condition for a 
conventional car is also 10 mph. 
 
FRA investigated the influence of tank thickness on the performance of a tank car and predicts 
that increasing the thickness to an equivalent 600 psi car only increases the safe impact speed by 
2 mph.  Therefore for head and side impact conditions a 600 psi car is predicted to withstand 
impacts at 12 mph. 
 
Full-Scale Testing 
 
Three full-scale tests have been conducted to date:  the first on April 11, 2007, the second on 
April 26, 2007, and the third on July 11, 2007.  These tests were for a side impact between a 
rigid ram car with a stylized punch striking a standing pressurized 105 tank car broadside at the 
centerline of the tank, both horizontally and vertically.  The ram car was ballasted to a weight of 
286,000 pounds.  The standing tank car was pressurized to 100 pounds per square inch gauge 
(psig) and was loaded with clay slurry with a density equal to liquid chlorine with an outage of 
10.6 percent.  The ram car was pulled back to a predetermined position on the slightly graded 
tangent track and released to achieve the desired impact speed.  Just prior to impact with the 
standing tank car, the air brakes on the ram car were activated such that upon rebound a second 
impact would not occur.  In the first two tests, the punch face size was approximately 23 inches 
by 17 inches; in the third test, the punch face size was approximately 6 inches by 6 inches. 
 

30 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

The first test was a limited-instrument assurance test designed to develop information about how 
the colliding equipment interact and better understand the gross motions of the two cars.  
Because the test was designed to develop more detailed information about the interacting cars’ 
behavior and puncturing the standing car would have unnecessarily complicated the analysis and 
test set-up, the test speed was defined such that no puncture would occur.  Specifically, the first 
test was conducted at 9.6 mph and, as predicted, no puncture occurred.  The limited 
instrumentation on both the ram car and the standing tank car were analyzed and the force-time 
histories measured and predicted were within the repeatability of the testing. 
 
The second test conducted had a fully-instrumented standing tank car.  The additional 
instrumentation helped to define load path into the tank car, the evolution of the plastic dent 
growth and recovery, and refined the measurements of the gross motions of the colliding cars’ 
interaction.  The test was conducted at 14.0 mph.  As in the first test, this test speed was chosen 
so that puncture would not occur.  The ram car was again released from a pre-defined location 
and allowed to roll freely under gravity and the grade to impact the standing tank car.  The 
analysis of the test data suggests that again the force-time histories of the ram car and the struck 
tank car are within the repeatability of the testing.  After the second test, a careful inspection of 
the ram car showed that a modest amount of damage was inflicted on the lead truck and its 
carbody attachment.  This damage was attributed to the off-axis vertical motions resulting from 
the difference in the centerline of the impactor and the height of the ram car’s center of gravity. 
 
In order to safely run a test to puncture the baseline car, either a smaller punch would be needed 
along with maintaining test speed at 14 mph, or the ram car’s center of gravity would have to be 
raised to be more in line with the centerline of the punch to minimize ram car vertical motions 
for impact speeds greater than 14 mph.  The option selected was to reduce the punch size to 6 
inches by 6 inches.  There was equal confidence in simulating the influence of punch size and 
impact speed on tank rupture.  DOT is seeking to significantly increase the impact speed for 
which tank cars carrying PIH materials can protect their lading.  For a wide range of sizes, this 
goal is independent of punch size.  In order to allow for safer test procedures and lower test 
speeds, it was decided to use the smaller punch size in the regulation. 
 
Because of the results of the second test, in the third test, the punch face size was approximately 
6 inches by 6 inches.  The standing tank car that was used during the third test was fully 
instrumented.  The test was conducted at 15.1 mph.  This test speed was chosen so that puncture 
would occur.  The third test was designed to confirm that material failure of the tank car and 
puncture would occur at 15 mph with a smaller impactor.  The test also provides a comparative 
baseline reference for the enhanced tank car designs.  As with the second test, the ram car was 
again released from a predefined location and allowed to roll freely under gravity and the grade 
to impact the standing tank car.  The analysis of the test data suggests that again the force-time 
histories of the ram car and the struck tank car are within the standard deviation of the predicted 
test results. 
 
9.0  Risk 
 
Not all lading losses resulting from train collisions or derailments are alike.  Nor are the 
consequences that result from such losses.  Obviously DOT believes that the consequences from 

31 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

a PIH lading loss can be more severe than from a non-PIH lading loss.  The quantity of lading 
that is released when a tank car loses its integrity during a collision/derailment can vary greatly.  
It is determined various factors including the car’s capacity, the type of car, and the nature of the 
accident. 
 
The proposed tank car crashworthiness standards are designed to significantly reduce or 
eliminate the hazards associated with release of PIH materials from tank cars involved in train 
accidents.  They are not being promulgated in this rulemaking for the purpose of reducing or 
eliminating the hazards which cause these types of accidents/derailments.44  Thus, the 
rulemaking’s purpose is to decrease or eliminate the likelihood that loaded PIH tank cars become 
hazardous to the train crew and the general public immediately following an accident/derailment 
that results in a secondary collision involving loaded tank cars . 
 
The risk involved in an activity is not just determined by the probability that a hazard will occur, 
it also takes into account the severity of the negative consequence.  Exposure to the hazards, and 
the severity of the adverse incident, if it occurs, are constituent components of the risk function 
for a given activity, event or situation.  In other words, the risk is governed by the incident 
frequency and severity.  Thus, risk could be represented by the following general functional 
equation: 
 
 

 

R = f (E, S) 
 

 

 

whereas:  

 

 

 

 

R represents the risk 
E represents the level of exposure to the hazards 
S represents the severity of the potential adverse event. 

 

Exposure 

 
Finally, it is important to note, as several commenters at the public meetings have noted, that the 
tank car is only one component of the rail transportation system and no single component of the 
system can be used to address tank car safety in its entirety.  
 
9.1 
 
The incident frequency or exposure/probability relevant for this rulemaking are the 
accident/incident and derailment rates, the amount of PIH commodities moved by rail and the 
distance moved, and how robust the tank car is.  The primary crashworthiness requirements in 
this proposed rulemaking would not have an effect on the accident/incident or derailment rates.  
However, it would directly affect the robustness of the tank cars and could indirectly affect the 
amount of PIH material that is shipped by rail. 
 
In July of 2002, the North American in-service tank car fleet totaled about 280,000 cars.  Data 
from the AAR indicated that of these cars, the number of pressurized tank cars in service was 
59,344.  Only 15,300 of these pressurized tank cars are PIH tank cars.  There are over 20 

                                                 
44   The operating restrictions that are proposed in the rulemaking do potentially serve to decrease the likelihood that 
some accidents may happen.  However, these restrictions most are intended to reduce the severity of any potential 
accident/incident that involves PIH tank cars. 

32 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

hazardous materials that are considered PIH materials that are shipped by rail.   However, 
chlorine and anhydrous ammonia represent over 78 percent of the shipments.  
 
In 2004, there were over 54,000 tank car loads of anhydrous ammonia shipped by rail.  For that 
same year, there were over 38,000 tank car loads of chlorine shipped by rail.  In 2003, there were 
over 51,000 and 35,000 loads, respectively, and a total of 106,000 PIH shipments.45 
 
Barkan & Saat use a risk equation where R = P1 * P2 * P3 * Q * C, where P1 = the probability 
of a derailment occurring, and P2 = the probability that a hazmat car is involved.  P3 represents 
the probability that the hazmat car releases product, and Q = the probability of the distribution of 
the quantity lost.  In their equation, C represents the consequences to people, property or the 
environment.  This last variable is identical to the severity (S) variable noted above.  This risk 
equation and its use of multiple variables to represent exposure is a specific form of the risk 
equation noted above.  It represents a different way of looking at the same problem/issue.46 
 
As stated above, of approximately 1.7 million shipments of hazardous materials by rail in 2004, a 
total of 47 hazardous material cars released some amount of product and the likelihood of a 
release was a tiny fraction of a percent (47/1,700,000, or 0.0028 percent).  In addition, as noted 
above, in the 10-year period between 1996 and 2005, four major accidents/incidents or 
derailments resulting in PIH material release occurred.  These incidents are discussed in more 
detail in Section 10 of this analysis. 
 
The population densities for three of the four fatal release sites are as follows: 
  
Aiken County, South Carolina – 144 persons/square mile 
Minot, North Dakota (Ward County) – 29 persons/square mile 
Alberton, Montana (Mineral County) – 3 persons/square mile 
 
The fourth fatal accident occurred in Macdona, Texas.  The NTSB report of its investigation of 
this accident describes Macdona as a “mixed rural & suburban area of Bexar County” and notes 
that the accident occurred “in an unincorporated rural area 1 miles east of the village of Macdona 
& about 17 miles southwest of downtown San Antonio.”  DOT is aware that there are PIH rail 
movements along corridors with population densities several times higher than these. This 
coupled with the relatively favorable circumstances surrounding the four incidents leads DOT to 
believe that the mean of the casualties resulting from the releases analyzed is likely not the true 
mean of the distribution of the population of preventable releases, but rather lies in the lower end 
of the distribution.47  DOT believes that absent issuance of the proposed standards a future 
incident could potentially result in a larger number of casualties than experienced in recent years. 
 
It should be noted that railroads and shippers have been willing to take additional steps to 
decrease the exposure of these potential hazards.  This has been accomplished in Canada by 
market swaps.  This helps decrease the distance that the PIH materials have to travel.  In the 
United States, railroads and shippers have been discussing similar shipping changes to ensure

Severity 

that the shortest route is used to get PIH materials from production to the end user.  This is 
accomplished through meetings with the Federal Government, pursuant to FRA’s authority under 
49 U.S.C. Section 333.   
 
9.2 
 
The severity of the incidents that this rulemaking is attempting to mitigate is governed by several 
factors.  The factors that affect the severity include:  chemical volatility of the PIH materials, 
shipment size, toxicity of the PIH materials, the weather or meteorological conditions, time of 
day, and the population density where the incident occurs.  This proposed rulemaking is not 
attempting to affect or impact the chemical volatility or toxicity of the PIH materials being 
shipped.  The population density, time of day, and weather are also not in the purview of this 
rulemaking.  The shipment size is, however, potentially affected indirectly by this rulemaking.  
 
Factors such as the closing speed of a collision or derailment also affect the severity of the 
overall accident and the likelihood that a tank car would lose its integrity during an event.  Any 
factor that increases the kinetic energy that will be transferred in a collision could potentially 
affect the severity of an accident and the likelihood of the loss of tank car integrity, i.e. the 
rupture of the tank car.  In other words, the number of cars in a train, the total tonnage of a train, 
the mass of a potential striking object, the mass of an object being struck, and the speed of the 
train at impact (or during derailment) potentially affect its severity.48  It is important to note that 
the increased robustness of PIH tank cars that this rulemaking is proposing would decrease the 
severity of the “overall” accident.  But the direct purpose of the robustness is to decrease or 
eliminate the exposure due to the release of PIH materials that might occur during an 
accident/incident or derailment. 
 
The most frequently reported symptoms among railroad employees (train crews) from the release 
of hazardous materials during accidents were respiratory irritation, nausea, vomiting, trauma, and 
headache.  Injuries suffered by railroad employees seemed more severe than those of non-
railroad employees.  .  
 
Chlorine is a respiratory irritant.  The gas irritates the mucous membranes and the liquid burns 
the skin.  As little as 3.5 ppm can be detected as an odor, and 1,000 ppm is likely to be fatal after 
a few deep breaths.  The chlorine releases in the Graniteville, Macdona, and Alberton 
accidents/derailments totaled 13 fatalities and 931 injuries.   
 
Ammonia is highly irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract.  Swelling and narrowing of the 
throat and bronchi, coughing, and an accumulation of fluid in the lungs can occur.  Ammonia 
causes rapid onset of a burning sensation in the eyes, nose, and throat accompanied by 
lacrimation [discharge of tears], rhinorrhea [runny nose] and coughing.  Upper airway swelling 
and pulmonary edema may lead to airway obstruction.  Prolonged skin contact can cause pain 
and corrosive injury.  The release of more than 120,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia in the 
Minot derailment in 2002 produced 1 fatality and 333 injuries. 

                                                 
48 NOTE: The purpose of this rulemaking, in part, is to regulate the construction of tank cars that transport PIH 
materials so that they will absorb more of this kinetic energy during an accident/incident or derailment, and thus be 
less likely to rupture or lose its integrity. 

34

Risk Characterization 

 
9.3 
 
The purpose of this rulemaking is not to eliminate or decrease the probability of any 
accidents/incidents or decrease derailments, although other FRA regulations and pending 
rulemakings have those goals.  This rulemaking is intended to decrease the conditional 
probability that a PIH tank car that is involved in any future accidents/incidents or derailments 
will lose its integrity and release its lading.  The discussion and assessments above note that the 
current probability of a PIH tank car losing its integrity when it is involved in such a situation is 
low.  However, the severity of such an incident is usually very high.  Thus, this proposed rule is 
focused on decreasing the exposure by decreasing the likelihood that a PIH tank car would lose 
its integrity when it is involved in an accident/incident or derailment by making these tank cars 
more robust. 
 
As noted above, PHMSA and FRA have evaluated accident data using a representative time 
period, and focusing on the types of releases that cause fatal consequences and that may threaten 
larger population segments.  FRA’s research and analysis indicate that substantially greater 
improvements in effectiveness can be gained from also enhancing the car design.  This is based 
on information gained from FRA’s tank car research program, which includes computer 
modeling and the conduct of full scale crash testing, in concert with the Next Generation Tank 
Car Project.  Recognizing the apparent logic of the SAFETEA-LU tank car mandates, and 
seizing upon advances in management of crash energy in other domains, the agencies propose 
performance standards for tank-head and shell protections, as well as operational speed 
restrictions that would achieve risk reductions (including the severity component) well in excess 
of the AAR targets.   
 
10.0  Historical Accident Data and Information 
 
Graniteville, SC, January 6, 2005  
 
As noted above, the Graniteville crash killed 9 people and injured more than 550 people.  It was 
the deadliest train wreck involving hazardous material in nearly three decades.  At 2:39 a.m., a 
train crashed into a locomotive and two cars on a siding in Graniteville, South Carolina.  A 
tanker containing chlorine was punctured in the shell by the coupler of another car and released 
chlorine.  The release occurred in commercial and residential areas of the city.  Approximately 
5,400 residents were evacuated from a 1-mile radius around the accident site.  About 554 people 
complaining of respiratory difficulties were taken to local hospitals.  Of those, 75 were admitted 
for treatment.  Nine people died from exposure to chlorine gas.49  Fifteen people were placed on 
ventilators in intensive care units.  Twenty-five people were hospitalized for more than 3 days.  
Twenty-six people were hospitalized for 1 to 2 days.  There were 68 repeat visits to the 
emergency department, 58 people with significant symptoms, and 98 with moderate symptoms.

Forty-one people who visited the emergency department were released and 13 people were 
treated at a physician’s office.50   
 
To assist in determining the appropriate Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)51 level to use, the 
injuries sustained in the accident defined previously will be used.  One criterion for a reportable 
injury is that the injury requires medical treatment.  Because one criterion of an AIS 2 injury is 
that it almost always requires treatment, it can be assumed that all injuries reported are at least 
AIS 2.  Of the 554 people taken to the hospital, it was reported that 75 were admitted for 
treatment.  It was further reported that 9 died, 15 people were placed on ventilators, 25 people 
were hospitalized for more than 3 days, and 26 people were hospitalized for 1 or 3 days.  In the 
interest of being conservative, and without more specific information, an AIS 2 - moderate will 
be assessed for 479 persons and the remaining 75 persons admitted will be assessed as AIS 3 - 
severe.   
 
Authorities evacuated homes and businesses within a mile of the crash, affecting about 5,400 
people.  Some were away from their homes for more than a week.  On January 14, 2005, 
approximately 1,500 Graniteville residents were allowed to return to their homes.  By January 
17, 2005, an estimated 4,500 people had returned home, including the 1,500 individuals who had 
previously returned home on January 14.  On January 19, 2005, residents remained displaced 
from an estimated 75 homes in the immediate area of the derailment.    
 
The Graniteville incident caused some local businesses to have a dramatic drop in business 
immediately after the accident.  Part of the reason for this drop was because parts U.S. Highway 
1 were closed due to the deadly chlorine cloud.  After four days the highway was opened but it 
had signs that noted that it was open only to local traffic.52   
 
Macdona, Texas, June 28, 2004 
 
At approximately 5:03 am on June 28, 2004, a UP freight train collided with a Burlington 
Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) train on the Del Rio subdivision near Macdona, Texas.  It was dawn 
on a cloudy day with a light wind and 77 degrees F.  The accident derailed 4 locomotives and 19 
cars on the UP train and 17 cars on the BNSF train.   
 
As a result of the derailment and pileup of railcars, a pressurized tank car loaded with liquefied 
chlorine was punctured.  Chlorine escaping from the punctured car immediately vaporized into a 
cloud of chlorine gas that engulfed the accident area to a radius of at least 700 feet before drifting 
away from the site.  Approximately 9,400 gallons of chlorine was released from the tank car.  
Three persons, including the conductor of the UP train and two local residents, died as a result of 
chlorine gas inhalation.  The UP train engineer, 23 civilians, and 6 emergency responders were 
treated for respiratory distress or other injuries related to the incident.   

 

                                                 
50 Data are from Earl Hunter, Commissioner, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. 
51 The AIS utilizes a system that assesses injuries with a numerical percentage of a statistical life.  This provides a 
means of aggregating all casualties as statistical lives.  The equivalent percentage of a life that an injury is assessed 
varies with the severity and location of the injury.  More detail on the AIS can be found in Appendix B of this 
analysis.

An evacuation zone was established around the accident site with a radius of about 2 miles.  
Over 60 people were evacuated from their homes and a camping area near the accident site.  
 
The railroad property damages reported to the FRA totaled over $6.3 million.  There was also a 
report of $150,000 for environmental cleanup consequences.  The NTSB reported that 2,820 
homes and businesses had their electricity disrupted.  The NTSB report does not note how long 
that disruption lasted.  A UP mainline track was out of service for 2 days.  This mainline 
provides service to New Orleans and Houston, and is the main connection into Mexico, via 
Laredo.  Finally, the FRA accident report notes that the UP locomotives lost their diesel fuel as a 
result of the accident.  In addition to the punctured chlorine tank car, other tank cars, loaded with 
ammonium nitrate solution, lost all or part of their contents.  
 
For purposes of this analysis, the casualties were recorded as three fatalities, and one AIS 5 
injury.  In addition, there were 6 AIS 4 injuries, 22 AIS 3 injuries, and 12 AIS 2 injuries. 
 
The NTSB determined that the probable cause of this collision was the UP railroad train crew 
fatigue that resulted in the failure of the engineer and conductor to appropriately respond to 
wayside signals governing the movement of their train.  Contributing to the severity of the 
accident was the puncture of a chlorine tank car and the subsequent release of poisonous 
liquefied gas.   
 
This incident also forced some temporary road closures.  Further it hampered the operations at a 
nearby state jail and at the Seaworld amusement park, which is located 10 miles from the 
accident location. 
 
Minot, North Dakota, January 18, 2002 
 
At approximately 1:37 am on January 18, 2002, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train 292-16 
derailed 31 of its 112 cars about a half-mile west of the city limits of Minot, North Dakota.  Five 
tank cars carrying anhydrous ammonia catastrophically ruptured, and a vapor plume covered the 
derailment site and surrounding area.  One resident was fatally injured; 11 people sustained 
serious injuries; and 322 people, including 2 train crewmembers, sustained minor injuries.  
Railroad property damages exceeded $2 million, and more than $8 million has been spent for 
environmental remediation.  In addition, other costs were incurred that are not quantified here 
such as liability payments and disruption to non-railroad businesses and community activities. 
 
During the derailment, five anhydrous ammonia tank cars sustained catastrophic shell fractures 
that resulted in rupture and the complete and instantaneous loss of the cars’ contents.  About 
146,700 gallons of anhydrous ammonia were released from the cars and a cloud of hydrolyzed 
ammonia formed almost immediately.  This plume rose an estimated 300 feet and gradually 
expanded 5 miles downwind of the accident site and over a population of about 11,600 people.  
Fatal and serious injuries were comparatively low, given the potential presented by the plume, as 
a result of a prompt decision by the incident commander to order shelter in place and by the fact 
that the incident occurred at approximately 1:37 am, a time when most residents were in their 

37 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

homes and activity on public streets was minimal.  Over the next 5 days, another 74,000 gallons 
of anhydrous ammonia were released from six other anhydrous ammonia tank cars. 
 
The NTSB reported that approximately 20 homes in a half-mile radius immediately east of the 
derailment site were evacuated.  The FRA investigation notes that approximately 100 people 
were evacuated.  This evacuation went on for over 41 days (January 18, 2002 to February 27, 
2002).  Approximately 10,000 people were required to shelter in place.53 
 
The derailment took a single main track (Class 3) out of service for 5 days.  In addition, all 
streets and highways leading into the city, including U.S. Highways 2, 52, and 83 and Ward 
County 15 were closed.  DOT does not know how long these roads were out of service, and it is 
difficult to put a value on their closure.  Thus, DOT estimates $500,000 for the lost value of all 
of these roads being closed. 
 
For purposes of this analysis, the casualties were recorded as 1 fatality, and 11 AIS 4 injuries.  In 
addition, there were 322 AIS 2 injuries. 
 
The NTSB concluded that the low fracture toughness of the non-normalized steels used for the 
tank shell of the five tank cars that catastrophically failed in this accident contributed to the cars’ 
complete fracture and separation. 
 
Alberton, Montana, April 11, 1996  
 
At 4:10 a.m., 19 cars from a MRL freight train derailed.  Six of the derailed cars contained 
hazardous materials.  One of the derailed tank cars containing chlorine ruptured, releasing 
130,000 pounds of chlorine into the atmosphere.  About 1,000 people from the surrounding area 
were evacuated.  The Alberton derailment killed 1 person and injured 350 others.   
 
The appropriate AIS level was utilized to assess values of the casualties sustained in this 
accident.  This accident included one fatality.  Approximately 227 injuries were assessed at AIS 
2.  Approximately 114 injuries were assessed at AIS 3, and 9 injuries were assessed at AIS 4.   
 
The authorities evacuated homes and business near the crash.  This affected approximately 1,000 
people.  It is not readily known how long these evacuations lasted.  This analysis assumes that it 
lasted 3.5 days.   
 
U.S. Interstate Highway 90 (I-90) is parallel to and approximately 450 feet north of the MRL 
tracks at the derailment site.  I-90 was closed after the derailment, requiring an 81-mile detour.54  
This road was out of service for approximately 17 days.  The track at the derailment site was a 
Class 3 track with a speed limit of 38 mph.   It is not known how long the track was out of 
service.  This analysis assumes that it was out of service for at least 1 day and is valued at $1 
million of lost value for that day. 

                                                 
53 The reports do not note how long these people were required to be sheltered in place.  DOT will assume 
approximately one day for this analysis. DOT is assuming a value of $50 per person per day for a value of sheltering 
in place.

In addition to the chlorine that was released during this accident, other hazardous materials were 
also released.  This included 17,000 gallons of potassium cresylate solution and 85 dry gallons of 
sodium chlorate. 
 
PIH Incidents Over Time 
The FRA analyzed data from chlorine incidents between 1965 and 2005, and for anhydrous 
ammonia incidents between 1981 and 2005, with regard to loss of product from tank-head and 
shell punctures, cracks, and tears.  This analysis identified that a disproportionate number of 
these incidents occurred in non-signaled “dark” territory, as compared to the percentage of total 
train-miles in dark territory.55  The review also noted that the vast majority of fatal injuries 
resulted from catastrophic losses of product due to head or shell damage as opposed to losses 
through valves and fittings. 
 
11.0  Burdens on Society 
 
A majority of the tank cars that would be replaced through implementation of the proposed rule 
transport chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  Most of the chlorine fleet is currently nearing 
replacement or retirement.  Most of the anhydrous ammonia tank cars were involved in a 
replacement program several years ago, so it is a younger fleet.  Almost every pre-1989 
anhydrous ammonia tank car has been removed from service.  For chlorine, the pre-1989 tank 
cars will be the first ones replaced.   
 
This analysis assumes that existing chlorine cars can be put into ethanol or other non-TIH 
service.  It also assumes that the current anhydrous fleet can be put into liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) service.  FRA does not have sufficient detailed information to know whether the 
remainder of the PIH fleet has alternate uses and, if so, what modifications might be required.  
Comment is requested on this issue. 
 
This analysis assumes that the railroads would gladly give up PIH shipments to another means of 
distribution—an assumption supported by public statements made on behalf of the major 
railroads.  However, the risk and the liability make it an unlikely prospect that another 
transportation mode would be willing to assume such a service or that it would find the endeavor 
profitable.  So, where it would be pertinent for this analysis to take into consideration the lost 
revenue from PIH shipments being shifted to another distribution means, there is no loss taken.56 
 
This analysis presents the costs for the baseline, which is the AAR Interchange Standard 
(Trinity-like tank car).  It also presents the costs for the DOT PIH proposed tank car.  Both sets 
of costs represent incremental costs (e.g., the additional amount that it would cost to replace 
existing PIH tank cars with cars meeting the new AAR or DOT proposed standards).   At the end 
of this section and in the analysis section the difference of these two alternatives will be shown.  
In reality the AAR Standard represents the “status quo” that would restul in absence of this 
rulemaking.  Therefore the “true” regulatory burden from the DOT PIH proposed tank car is the 
difference between the two alternatives.  However so as to show what the total cost (and 
                                                 
55 See Appendix C. 
56 NOTE:   Exhibit 2 of this analysis contains a table/spreadsheet with all of the costs by item and by year.

projected benefits) of the two alternatives, all of the burdens and benefits are displayed in this 
analysis.  Utlimately this also permits evaluation of regulatory alternatives as well as conduct of 
sensitivity analyses. 
 
11.1  Engineering and Design 
 
This proposed rule would require tank car manufacturers to redesign PIH tank car models to 
meet the proposed tank-head and shell requirements.  In order to meet the standards, 
manufacturers are expected to dedicate resources to the engineering and redesign of a new PIH 
tank car model.  DOT expects that, generally, subsequent redesign of tank car models will be less 
costly in terms of the amount of time and expense necessary for the redesign of the first model 
from each manufacturer. 
 

11.1.1  AAR Interhange Standard – Trinity-Like Car 
 
DOT estimates retooling costs for the production of the Trinity-like tank car would total 
$400,000.   
 
DOT estimates that approximately 8,000 hours of design and engineering planning for 
the Trinity-like tank car.  This estimate covers the design time to prepare to make the 
different models fo the car.  This cost is estimated to total $1,200,000.57 
 
All costs for the designing of the Trinity-like car are in the first year of the analysis. 
 
 
11.1.2  DOT proposed PIH Tank Car 

In addition to the engineering and redesign, if pertinent, of tank car models, it is 
anticipated that there would also be a one-time cost related to retooling.  There would 
also be one-time fixed costs for plant and equipment modifications which would be 
necessary to build the redesigned tank cars.  These costs are partially factored into the 
engineering costs quantified below.  To cover minimal retooling and manufacturing 
equipment costs, there is a cost assessed for $200,000 per builder.  The analysis assesses 
this cost in the first year of the analysis. 
 
DOT estimates that the redesign of tank car models will require 4,540 hours, which it 
believes is reasonable and appropriate for purposes of compliance with the proposed 
requirements.  This analysis uses $150 per hour as the cost of the engineering design and 
development time.  The engineer time is necessary to incorporate tank car features that 
would be required to meet the proposed energy absorption requirements.  Thus, this is 
estimated to cost $681,600.58  Note that this would be the estimated cost for the first 
design model created per company or builder.  It is estimated that the second model by 
each company or builder would be half of that cost. 

 

 

 

                                                 
57  CALCULATION:  (8,000 hours) * ($150/hour) = $1,200,000. 
58 CALCULATION: (4,540 hours) * ($150.00/hour wage rate) = $681,600. 

40 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

DOT is estimating that on average, there will be five manufacturers that will build the 
new PIH tank cars.  DOT is also estimating that each builder will design two models.  
DOT estimates that the total design and engineering cost will be $6,107,500.59  It is also 
estimated that this cost will be spread over the first 2 years of the analysis.  The PV or 
discounted value of this cost over 30 years is approximately $5.6 million.  

 

Finally, if it is necessary for new PIH tank cars to be designed for both 263,000- and 
286,000-pound models, then there will be little or no additional costs.  The basic 
difference between the two cars would be in length and would not really require any 
additional design time or costs. 

 
11.2  Marginal Production Costs:  Labor and Supplies 
 
This analysis assesses the additional labor and material/supply costs for all new tank cars. The 
labor and material/supply costs are not for the redesigned crashworthy tank cars, but only for the 
crashworthy improvements.   
 

11.2.1  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Car 
 
DOT’s research and development program has estimated that the AAR standard or 
Trinity-like tank car will cost approximately $22,000 per car more than the typical PIH 
tank that exist today.  DOT estimates 15,300 tank cars will be produced for operation in 
the United States, and this is estimated at a total cost of about $336,600,000.  The 
discounted value of this cost over the 30-year analysis is $230 million.60 

 

 

 

 

11.2.2  DOT proposed PIH Tank Car 

DOT believes that the marginal costs for the materials and labor which are needed by the 
manufacturers to produce the crashworthy improvements would range between $30,000 
and $50,000 per tank car, depending on the design of the car.  This estimate is the 
estimated increase in cost of a PIH tank car when compared to the current fleet, and not 
the Trinity tank car. 

As noted above in the assumptions section, this estimate is DOT’s best approximation, 
given the information and input provided.  Therefore, a reasonable central estimate to 
minimally meet the requirements of the proposed rule would be $40,000 per car.61  DOT 
estimates 15,300 tank cars will be produced for operation in the United States, and this is 
estimated at a total cost of about $612,000,000 for the additional crashworthiness 
features.  The discounted value of this cost over the 30-year analysis is  
$424.6 million. 

                                                 
59 CALCULATION: ($681,600 cost for first model) * (5 builders) + ($681,600) * (.5 for second model) * (5 
builders) + ($200,000) * (5 builders) = $6,107,500. 
60  Note the total costs include a small attrition replacement rate of about 15 cars per year for years 11 – 30 of this 
analysis. 
61 Most of this cost is for steel fabrication costs plus a small amount for foam costs. 

41 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

This cost is expected to start in the third year of the analysis and will be accomplished in 
6 years (years 3 - 8 of this analysis).  Thus, the costs are $102,000,000 per year for those 
years.  After that time, FRA estimates that the fleet will grow at 0.1 percent per year.  
Thus, for years 9 through 30, this is an additional cost of $612,000 per year.  The total 
costs for the marginal crashworthy improvements would be $625,464,000.  The PV for 
this cost stream is $428,586,000. 

 
This analysis only considers the marginal cost or the additional cost for incorporating the more 
crashworthy features into the new fleet.  It does not consider the full cost for replacing tank cars 
that have not reached the end of their life cycles, and are being replaced prior to their expected 
retirements.  Tank cars built after July 1, 1974, can be operated for 50 years.  Prior to that date, 
they could be operated for 40 years.  In reality, most cars are only operated for about 35 years.  
DOT is assuming that current chlorine tank cars will be transferred to sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 
potentially ethanol service, and the anhydrous ammonia cars to LPG service.  DOT is taking a 
cost for the transferring the tank cars to another service (see section 11.3). 
 
11.3  Transferring PIH Tank Cars to Other Service 
 
DOT is assuming that the current PIH tank car fleet will be either excessed to scrap or 
transferred to another service.  DOT is estimating that approximately 13,000 cars from the 
current PIH tank car fleet will be transferred to other services.  DOT does not precisely know 
what it would cost to transfer a tank car from one service to another.  The tank cars will need to 
be cleaned and have other modifications made to prepare them for transporting the new product.  
It is estimated that it will cost approximately $2,500 per car to transfer a PIH tank car to another 
service.62 
 

11.3.1  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Car 

 

 

For the AAR Interhange Standard/Trinity-like car this cost will be spread over 9 years – 
years 3 through 11 of this analysis.  For each of these years the cost would be $ 3.61 
million.  The total cost would be $32.5 million with a PV of $20.6 million. 

11.3.2  DOT proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this cost will be spread over 6 years -- years 4 
through 9 of this analysis.  For each of these years, the cost would be $5.42 million.  The 
total cost would be $32.5 million with a PV of $21.1 million. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
11.4  Compliant Repairs 
 
DOT anticipates that the more crashworthy PIH tank car design standards will result in more 
expensive repairs after damage to a tank car has occurred in an accident/incident or derailment.  
When an enhanced part or feature of a new crashworthy PIH tank car has to be repaired after a 
collision or derailment, the repair process and methods would have to meet the quality and 
                                                 
62 DOT requests comment to this estimate.  Please submit such comments to the docket. 

42 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards of the original design and construction of the tank car.  This is necessary to ensure the 
integrity of the enhanced tank-head and shell features.   
 
It is difficult to anticipate how many repairs would be required and how much more the repairs 
would cost.  DOT assumes that half of 1 percent (0.005), or approximately 77 tank cars, will 
need repairs that impact the new crashworthiness features of the cars annually.63  DOT also 
assumes that the marginal difference for such repairs would be $200 for supplies, and 3 hours of 
labor ($126.00).  Once all of the new PIH tank cars are phased-into the fleet, this would total 
$24,940 per year.  The total cost over the 30-year analysis is approximately $611,600, with a 
discounted value of approximately $200,000. 
 
For the AAR Interchange Standard the compliant repairs are expected to be less expensive than 
for the proposed DOT standard.  It is estimated that the cost would be about one-third the cost of 
the DOT proposed PIH tank cars.  Thus the 30 year total cost is $ $64,000 with a discounted 
value of approximately $20,000. 
 
11.5  Maintenance and Inspection Costs 
 
DOT anticipates that general maintenance for the new tank cars will be more burdensome than 
for the current fleet.  Initially, the new PIH tank cars would be new and unproven items, and 
therefore more frequent checks and inspections would be necessary for data and assurance 
purposes.  The tank car facility employees that are responsible for maintaining and inspecting 
these tank cars would also require additional training on the new cars. 
 
Note that unless otherwise noted in this section that the maintenance and inspection costs do not 
differ between the AAR Interhange Standard (baseline) and the DOT proposed PIH tank car. 
 
Training Costs 
 
DOT anticipates that the people who inspect and maintain the new PIH tank cars would require 
additional training.  This training would provide them with the necessary information on how the 
new PIH tank cars are different from the current fleet and how this would impact the inspection 
of the cars.   
 
As this proposed regulation would require the new PIH tank cars to be built according to a 
performance standard, it is difficult to determine how much more training would be required.  If 
it is assumed that the new PIH tank cars are an enhanced version of the 105J tank car, then it 
would be more feasible to make reasonably reliable cost estimates.  DOT has not assessed much 
of a cost here because introduction of any new tank car would require some training.  DOT 
estimates that there would be a one-time cost for supplies and materials related to this training 
for a new tank car in the industry.  This cost is estimated to be $10,000.   
 

                                                 
63 This number is DOT’s best approximation.  Any information that a commenter might provide to give greater 
clarity to this number should be submitted to the docket. 

43 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

Maintenance Costs 
 
DOT anticipates that the maintenance for the new PIH tanks cars would cost slightly more than 
for the existing PIH tank cars.  This could be due to the use of new materials or the new designs 
that improve crashworthiness of the current design of tank cars that transport PIH materials.  For 
instance, additional puncture resistance can be gained by moving the tank-head puncture 
resistance system away from the tank shell and filling the annular space with energy absorbing 
material.  New designs or materials necessitate new and unproven qualification techniques.  If it 
is assumed that the new PIH tank cars are basically an enhanced version of current 105J tank 
cars, then the maintenance costs are known. 
 
Barkan and Saat estimated that the maintenance cost for a tank car over 10 years was $7,371.64   
The chemical shippers responded that this estimate is very high.  Thus this analysis assumes that 
approximately $3,800 is the maintenance cost for a tank car over 10 years.  It is also assumed 
that the maintenance cost for the new PIH tank cars would be approximately 15 percent more 
than for the current ones.  That works out to be a one percent cost per year, or $55 per PIH tank 
car per year.  For a typical year, after all of the cars have been replaced, this is an annual cost of 
$841,500.  For the first year in which maintenance could be required, which is the fourth year of 
the analysis, the incremental cost is $140,000.  In the second year in which maintenance could be 
required, which is the fifth year of the analysis, it would be $280,000.  In the third year in which 
maintenance could be required, which is the sixth year of the analysis, it would cost $421,000.  
In the fourth and fifth years in which maintenance could be required, which are the seventh and 
eighth years of the analysis, it would cost $561,000, and $701,000, respectively.   The total cost 
for this maintenance cost is $12.2 million over the 30-year analysis.  The PV of this cost stream 
over the 30-year analysis is approximately $5.1 million. 
 
The current tank car typically has little maintenance performed during its first 10 years.  The first 
requalification occurs at the 10-year time frame so the only costs are valve requalification and 
any maintenance due to damage by the railroads during transportation.  The primary maintenance 
cost that would be added to the new PIH tank cars would result from the use of unproven 
material or new designs.  Costs could be lowered by additional testing of material prior to use on 
the PIH tank car.  
 
In addition to the supplemental marginal costs for the maintenance of the new PIH tanks cars, 
there may also be some changes needed in the facilities in which the cars are maintained.  New 
tools or supplies may be required for a testing process.  DOT does not know how much this will 
cost.  Therefore a best approximation of $1,000,000 for the entire industry has been added to this 
analysis.  This cost has been split, with half of it taken in the second year and half in the third 
year of this analysis.  DOT requests comments on this estimate. 
 
Inspection Costs 
 
DOT expects that the new PIH tank cars would require additional qualification (inspection) 
events during the first 10 years of their life cycles.  For at least the first few years until there is

enough data collected to enable adequate design or material performance evaluation, car owners 
would need to conduct additional inspections that ensure integrity of the materials and their 
applications.  This could be supplemented with additional material testing and modeling prior to 
installation to reduce the cyclical inspection frequency.  DOT assumes that 50 percent of the 
builders will conduct sufficient material testing and modeling to negate the need for data 
collection through inspection.  Costs associated with material testing and modeling are already 
assumed in the design development costs.  In addition, many of the tank car builders will opt to 
use already proven designs that will have been shown to meet the proposed enhanced standards.  
The use of proven designs is considered in taking the 50 percent reduction noted above.  
 
DOT estimates that the annual inspection would take approximately 24 hours of additional labor 
time (beyond the time necessary for the current PIH tank cars) per tank car.  DOT expects that 
the enhanced tank car will be based upon current DOT Class 105J tank cars and no additional 
revisions to the existing qualification requirements are proposed.  Beyond the already required 
inspections, the tank car will have an overall qualification event for a new car construction.  
However, specific application of materials and design variances may occasion additional 
inspections to ensure appropriate life cycle planning.65  It is assumed that portions of these new 
PIH tank cars, i.e., new energy absorbing materials or bracing, will be inspected every other year 
until there is sufficient data and confidence that they can go for a longer inspection period.  DOT 
has assessed additional costs for these tank cars to be inspected every other year for the first 6 
years they are in production.  By that time, the cars should be moving towards their normal 10-
year qualification program.  All of the new tank cars built during the six years of production will 
go through at least one additional inspection when they are 2 years old, i.e., the cars built in the 
fifth and sixth year (eighth year of the analysis) will still undergo one additional inspection prior 
to their 10-year certification first scheduled (due to maximum regulatory time frames) 
requalification event.  
 
While inspection ports are not mandated, DOT is considering whether regulatory action is 
needed to facilitate their use throughout the industry.  DOT assumes that inspection ports will be 
installed in the new PIH tank car designs to facilitate more efficient inspections.  Many builders 
currently use inspection ports to reduce costs and time during qualification events.  These ports 
enable easier access to specific areas of the tank car (therefore enabling focused removal and 
reinstallation activities) and can be removed quickly without damaging the underlying materials 
and allowing a more thorough inspection.  The use of inspection ports would enable inspections 
to be accomplished by tank car facility mobile crews at the shipper’s facilities rather than at a 
tank car facility.  This would reduce the cost to the owner from transit time, lost cycles, and fleet 
sizing.  It would also reduce the time required to inspect a tank car to one day (8 hours).   
 
During the first biannual inspections, 2,550 PIH tank cars will be inspected.  This is estimated to 
cost approximately $841,500.  FRA anticipates hiring an engineer and utilizing reliability 
software that should eliminate this need for at least half of the pertinent tank cars.  The annual 
cost will be approximately $420,750. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
65   This rule would not mandate the inspections or the inspection time-periods.  Those are stipulated elsewhere in 
the hazardous materials regatulions and we are not proposing any changes at this time.

The total additional cost for the biannual inspections for the new PIH tank cars is approximately 
$10.3 million.  The discounted value of this cost over the 30-year analysis is approximately 
$3.46 million. 
 
It is important to note that tank cars currently have to be inspected every 10 years for 
certification.  With the inspection ports, the time needed for the 10 year certification should 
actually decrease by approximately 12 hours.  This reduction is primarily in the welding process 
for removal and replacement of the jacket of the tank car. 
 
11.6  Fuel Costs:  Impact of Additional Weight of PIH Cars 
 
It is extremely difficult to predict the full and entire impact of the proposed requirements on fuel 
costs.  On one side of the equation, the fuel costs should increase due to the extra weight per PIH 
tank car (approximately 23,000 lbs per car).  On the other side of the equation, the temporary 
speed restrictions for dark territory and the 50 mph limit on signaled track would create fuel 
savings for the railroads.  This is because trains are more efficient at lower speeds and the lower 
operating speeds will encourage the railroads to operate the trains in more of a pacing manner. 
 
Thus, the question arises as to whether the additional fuel costs from the extra weight would be 
greater than the fuel savings from the proposed operating restrictions.   
 
Based on the assumption that there will be approximately 15,300 new PIH tank cars, and that 
they will on average weigh 23,000 lbs more than the conventional ones, and the fact that the 
variable cost per ton-mile (based on STB data) is $0.01993 per ton mile, a calculation of this 
impact can be performed.  DOT is assessing a cost for extra PIH shipments separately, (see 
Section 11.8).  DOT expects that only 15,000 of the new cars will actually weigh more, given 
that the weight of newly introduced AAR Interchange Standard compliant Trinity-like cars is 
comparable to the weight of the new PIH cars.  DOT believes that this produces a very 
conservative estimate.   Both the AAR Interchange Standard (Trinity-like tank car) and the DOT 
proposed PIH tank car are expected to weigh 23,000 lbs more than conventional tank cars. 
 
It is also known that the average PIH tank car makes six trips per year, and that the average 
distance a train travels is 723 miles.  Thus, the total cost for a year after the entire fleet has been 
replaced is $14,913,719.66   
 

11.6.1  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Car 

Since the AAR Trinity-like car will be implemented sooner and over a longer period of 
time, the extra cost for this burden will initiate in the second year of the analysis.  It will 
reach its maximum of $14.9 million in the 11th year of the analysis.  This is estimated to 
total $365.4 million for the thirty-year period.  The discounted value of this is $121.2 
million.

66 CALCULATION: [(23,000 lbs/car) * (15,000 PIH Cars) * (6 trips/year) * (723 miles/trip)]/(2,000 lbs/ton) = 
748,305,000;   (748,305,000) * (0.01993) = $14,913,719. 

46 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this cost will be phased in over 6 years and start in 
the third year of the analysis.  This is estimated to total $372.9 million for the thirty-year 
period.  The discounted value of this is $125.1 million. 

 
It is true that locomotives use more fuel at higher speeds.  The Davis Formula shows that this 
phenomenon is caused by wind resistance.67  The rolling dynamics of the train make it more 
efficient up to 10 mph, but the aerodynamics and wind resistance cause the fuel efficiency to go 
down from there.  For example, the resistance for a locomotive at 50 mph is almost three times 
the resistance for the same locomotive at 12 mph.   
 
It is also true that having a lower operating speed will encourage railroads to utilize pacing, 
which would further contribute to the fuel savings.  In general, when utilized judiciously, pacing 
will save fuel.  Essentially, it allows a locomotive to use the minimal amount of fuel to get from 
one point to another. 
 
The fuel savings for the operating restrictions from this proposed rule are discussed further and 
assessed in the Benefit Section of this analysis (Section 12). 
 
11.7  Cost for Restricting Traffic Speed to 50 mph 
 
This rulemaking proposes that PIH tank cars be limited to speeds of 50 mph on signaled territory 
or track.  Dow noted in its comments at the July 2006 public meeting that the probability of a 
release of PIH materials depends on rail car design and operating conditions (e.g., speed 
restrictions, train configuration, tank car placement within train, and double shelf couplers on 
freight cars).68 
 
 
It is difficult to fully know how this operational restriction will impact the railroad industry, its 
chemical shippers and their customers.  The AAR has developed a detailed protocol on 
recommended railroad operating practices for the transportation of hazardous materials, which is 
known as Circular OT-55-I.  Circular OT-55-I is described above in Section 4, above.  
 
Additionally under FRA’s Track Safety Standards,69 there are minimum safety requirements the 
track must meet, and the condition of the track is directly tied to the maximum allowable 
operating speed for the track.  Only the two highest categories of freight track, Class 4 and Class 
5 have a maximum allowable operating speed above 50 mph.  DOT believes that extending OT-
55-I’s 50 mph speed restriction to all tank cars transporting PIH material is a reasonable way to 
control the forces experienced by the tank car during most derailment or accident conditions and 
will not present an undue burden to industry.

It is not known how many trains operate with fewer than five PIH tank cars.  It is known that 
since small railroads do not operate at speeds of 50 mph, it should not impact them.  They 
primarily switch PIH tank cars to the large railroads to transport to the end destination.  Almost 
all shortline railroads do not operate trains that travel at speeds above 30 mph.  There are 
regional railroads and a few of the largest Class III railroads that might have some track with a 
49 mph maximum authorized speed. 
 
Potentially, the only trains that could be impacted by the 50 mph restriction are trains that 
currently operate in signaled territory with fewer than five PIH tank cars in the train makeup.  
DOT estimates that this could be about 10 percent of the estimated 78,000 tank car loads of PIH 
shipments per year.70  In order to decrease the impact DOT assumes that the railroad industry 
will work to combine the shipments of PIH materials so that no train leaves with fewer than five 
tank car loads on it.  Given the large volumes and varieties of commodities transported by large 
railroads, they are able to assemble “key trains” without unreasonably delaying delivery of PIH 
commodities.  DOT therefore estimates that this will accommodate 100 percent of the impacted 
traffic.  In order to accomplish this consolidation of shipments, it is estimated that a railroad 
would need 2 labor hours per tank car load for rearranging its shipment path and schedule.  This 
is estimated to cost $468,780 per year.  This cost would start in the first year of the analysis. 
 
Many of the affected PIH shipments will most likely be delayed in their delivery.  It is difficult 
to predict with certainty the average time or actual impact that would result.  DOT is estimating 
that the lost value of the delay is $100 per car, per day.  Therefore, assuming that each one of the 
7,800 shipments was delayed one day, the lost value would be $780,000 per year.   
 
It is also possible that the movement of “key trains” that would not be voluntarily formed in 
absence of the proposed speed restriction would impose a cost on those taking delivery of other 
commodities transported on the train.  In addition, it is possible that restricting speed on one train 
may cause residual delays to other trains transporting commodities with sensitive delivery 
schedules.  However, these impacts would be on a limited category of high density main lines 
where premium traffic is a factor (e.g., intermodal, finished auto) and siding capacity is an issue.   
 
Assuming that 7,800 shipments are combined into at most 1,560 trains (5 shipments per “key 
train”) and that on average for 25 percent of the “key trains” formed due to the proposed DOT 
requirement a car transporting a time sensitive commodity is delayed at an average cost of 
$4,000; this analysis assumes that the cost of such delays could total $1,560,000 per year.71  The 
true cost of the delay would depend on the extent of the actual delay, which would vary by route.  
DOT appreciates that this is a potential cost driven by the economics of discrete, capacity-
constrained line segments about which only the owning carriers would have sufficient detailed 
information to generate reliable estimates.  Accordingly, comment is specifically solicited on this 
issue. 
 
The total cost for both of these impacts over the 30-year analysis would be $89.9 million.  The 
present value of this cost is $33.5 million. 

 

                                                 
70 In 2003, the estimated number of PIH tank car loads was 77,000.  Thus 78,000 tank car loads was utilized as a 
current estimate. 
71   Calculation:  (1,560 trains) * ( 25 percent) * $4,000 = $1,560,000.

Increased Traffic/Volume of PIH Tank Cars 

 
Although this analysis has assessed a value for the potential delay in some of these PIH tank car 
deliveries, it is just a value for that impact.  Most of the customers that receive these shipments 
will not be negatively impacted by any delay.  What is more important for them is that they have 
an accurate estimate of when the tank cars will arrive.  Anhydrous ammonia shipments during 
the spring agriculture season would be an exception.  
 
Finally, it is important to note that to accommodate this requirement and the other operating 
restriction requirement, there might be an increase in yard switching of PIH tank cars.  This 
could increase the risk or hazard exposure of employees that perform this function. 
 
11.8 
 
Due to several requirements in this proposed regulation, it is anticipated that the actual PIH tank 
car traffic volume would increase.  This is because the new enhanced PIH tank cars will weigh 
more and those not in chlorine service will have less space available to carry products.  Some of 
the facilities and shortlines will not be able to accommodate the additional weight of the 
286,000-pound tank cars, some because of the additional weight, and some because of the 
additional length of the new 286,000-pound cars.  For some, it would be because they could not 
make it to the destination without going over a bridge that is not capable of handling the 
additional weight.  However, FRA believes that railroads which handle PIH cars have, in 
general, already made the transition to track structure capable of handling 286,000-pound cars. 
 Accordingly, the actual impact of the general increase in gross weight on rail of products in this 
commodity group in relation to the overall transition now being completed within the industry 
(which has been eased by tax incentives and, in some cases, government-guaranteed loan 
arrangements) should not be substantial.  (Nevertheless, as further discussed below, FRA has 
conservatively assumed that some new 263,000-pound cars will be built for anhydrous ammonia 
service to address rail line and facility compatibility concerns.)  FRA specifically requests 
comment on which rail lines and loading/unloading facilities may be impacted and for what 
periods, should only 286,000-pound cars be available as the implementation period for the 
proposed rule progresses. 
 
DOT has estimated that both the AAR Interchange Standard “Trinity-like tank car” and the 
proposed DOT PIH tank car both have an increased weight of approximately 23,000 lbs.  Thus 
the cost or impact of that is calculated in this section are identical. 
 
DOT estimates that the traffic/volume of the PIH cars will increase by 2 percent.  An assumption 
is made that a fleet of 15,300 PIH tank cars has enough down time that the actual number of cars 
will not increase, but rather just the volume of traffic. 
 
The average length of a trip for a PIH tank car is 723 miles.  The average number of tons of 
product transported for a PIH tank car is 79 tons.  The average number of trips a PIH tank car 
took prior to this rulemaking was six per year.  The variable freight cost per ton-mile received 
from STB via the waybill is $0.01993.72  

                                                 
72 FRA receives waybill data from the STB.  The Class I railroads report the data to the STB.  FRA’s Office of 
Policy calculated this rate. 

49

An increase of 2 percent in PIH car loads would be adding approximately 1,720 trips annually.  
The estimated cost of this increase in traffic is $11,747,700 per year.  However, since it would be 
incurred due to the introduction of the new fleet of PIH tank cars, then the cost would also be 
phased-in after each year of increase.   
 

11.8.1  AAR Interhange Standard – Trinity-Like Car 

 

 

 

For the AAR Interchange Standard (Trinity-like tank car) the cost is phased-in starting in 
the second year of the aanalysis.  It takes 9 years for it to be completely phased-in.  The 
total cost for this additional volume is $282.6 million for this 30-year analysis.  The 
discounted or present value of this cost is $92.1 million. 

11.8.2  DOT proposed PIH Tank Car 

For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this cost is phased-in starting in the third year of the 
analysis.  It takes 6 years for it to be phased-in.  The total cost for this additional volume 
is $288.8 million for this 30-year analysis.  The discounted or present value of this cost is 
$95.2 million. 

 

 
11.9  Agricultural Impacts Associated with NH3 
 
Several shippers and chemical manufacturers noted concern regarding reduced capacity, stating 
that infrastructure restrictions of many facilities and some shortline railroads would prohibit 
utilizing a car weighing 286,000 pounds.  These commenters also noted that this reduced per car 
capacity could lead to an increased number of railroad tank car shipments, and in the case of 
anhydrous ammonia, a shift from the rail transportation to highway transportation. 
 
DOT anticipates that there might be impacts, beyond those assessed in this analysis, on the 
agriculture industry from the proposed crashworthy improvements to PIH tank cars—specifically 
ones that carry anhydrous ammonia.  Some facilities might not be able to handle a heavier or 
longer tank car.  Thus, a smaller model of the crashworthy car is anticipated to be designed and 
built.  It would probably be a 263,000-pound car but it would not carry as much product as the 
current PIH cars.  This would cause there to be increased shipments.  This burden is assessed 
above.   
 
Additional impacts are difficult to determine.  Many of the impacts noted in this analysis overlap 
with the impacts that the agriculture industry will incur.  Commenters at the public meetings did 
provide input and remarks that can assist here.  One noted that the survival of family farms in the 
Northwest is tied to cheap sources of nitrogen via NH3, which, for them, comes via rail.73  Other 
commenters noted that NH3 costs 40-50 percent less per pound of nitrogen than less concentrated

forms of nitrogen.74  For example another commenter noted that anhydrous ammonia costs $0.24 
per pound of nitrogen, compared with $0.34 per pound for ammonium nitrate.75   
 
Anhydrous ammonia is dependent on natural gas for its production.  The North American 
anhydrous ammonia production plants are typically built near a dedicated supply of natural gas, 
and the price and demand for the product are also dependent and responsive to the price of 
natural gas.  Thus, the production at some plants is currently down due to the price of natural 
gas.  On the demand side of the economic equation there is an increase in the demand and use of 
anhydrous ammonia due to the recent increase in ethanol.  Ethanol is typically produced in the 
United States from corn and the production of corn needs lots of nitrogen, which typically comes 
from anhydrous ammonia. 
 
DOT encourages potentially affected entities to submit comments to the docket that would 
explain what additional impacts there are and how they were calculated. 
 
11.10  Cost for Restricted Speed of 30 mph in Dark Territory    
 
This proposed regulation imposes enhanced crashworthiness performance standards for PIH tank 
cars, including some operating restrictions.  Limiting the operating speed of tank cars 
transporting PIH materials is one method to impose a control on the forces experienced by these 
tank cars.  The combination of the two proposals, decreased speed and enhanced tank car 
performance standards, are intended to significantly decrease the risk of a PIH tank car losing its 
integrity in an accident/incident or derailment.   
 
One of the operating restrictions that DOT has proposed in this rulemaking is a decreased 
maximum allowable operating speed for PIH tank cars that do not meet the head and shell 
puncture-resistance systems requirements when transported across non-signaled territory.  
Proposed Section 174.86(c) provides that PIH tank cars that do not meet the new performance 
requirements may not exceed 30 mph when that tank car travels in non-signaled territory.  
Railroads may exceed the 30 mph limit, however, provided that equivalent safety criteria are 
met.  Examples of these safety criteria include a provision to effectively monitor switch positions 
and a means for detecting broken rails.  The railroad would be required to complete a risk 
assessment that demonstrates an equivalent level of safety to a signalized system and submit it to 
FRA for approval.  If FRA determines that an equivalent level of safety has been met through the 
alternative measures, it would notify the railroad that it has met the safety requirements.    
 
FRA analyzed data from chlorine incidents between 1965 and 2005, and for anhydrous ammonia 
incidents between 1981 and 2005, with regard to those incidents resulting in loss of product from 
tank-head and shell punctures, cracks and tears.76  This analysis identified a disproportionate 
number of these incidents had occurred in non-signaled (dark) territory, as compared to the 
percentage of total train-miles in dark territory.  Additionally, this analysis showed that at the 
time of these accidents, the median train speed was 40 mph and the average speed was 38 mph.  
This analysis also demonstrates that approximately 80 percent of the losses occurred at speeds

greater than 30 mph.  Notably, no catastrophic losses of chlorine occurred at speeds below 30 
mph.  
 
The railroad industry is making some efforts itself to decrease the number of collisions and/or 
derailments in dark territory.  One railroad’s efforts include implementing advanced train control 
technology, utilizing various freight car condition monitoring technologies, installing and 
maintaining switch point position indicators and broken rail protection in dark territory, as well 
as modifying the carrier’s operating practices when transporting a significant amount of PIH 
materials over non-signalized territory.  Specifically, noting that nearly 50 percent of its PIH 
movement is over non-signaled territory, the railroad explained changes in its operating practices 
aimed at ensuring the safe transport of PIH materials over this type of territory.  The railroad 
noted the following changes in operating practices when transporting PIH materials over dark 
territory:  (1) inspection of the route prior to operating trains carrying PIH materials, (2) 
restriction of speed for trains carrying PIH materials to 35 mph, (3) requiring trains hauling PIH 
to hold the main line during meets, and (4) requiring trains on sidings to stop before a PIH train 
passes.  
 
Under FRA’s Track Safety Standards,77 there are minimum safety requirements which track 
must meet and the condition of the track is directly tied to the maximum allowable operating 
speed for the track.  Only the two highest categories of track typically employed for freight 
service, Class 4 and 5, have a maximum allowable operating speed above 50 mph. Class 3 track 
has a maximum allowable speed of 40 mph.  Class 2 track would not be pertinent (as far as 
impacts) since its maximum allowable speed is 25 mph.  Additionally, for non-signaled track, 
speed is limited to a maximum of 49 mph in accordance with the limitation specified in 49 CFR 
Part 236.  The burden of reduced operating speeds will impact primarily Class I railroads.  
Shortlines do not generally have track that would have a speed above 30 mph.   
 
Some of the operations in dark territory are very short segments.  They could just be a short 
movement from a manufacturer or facility to where it connects with a Class I railroad with 
signalized territory.  Therefore, the portion of the operation in dark territory could be just under a 
mile on a shortline that interchanges with the appropriate large railroad.  It is important to note 
that these shortlines almost definitely are operating at a speed under 30 mph.  
 
In its public comments, AAR noted that 40 percent of track is in dark territory, and that it 
believes the system is close to capacity.78  Utilizing data available from the analysis of Class I 
railroads, the FRA network, and railroads that transport PIH materials as well as STB variable 
and cost information, DOT estimated the impact to the railroads from the proposed 30 mph speed 
restriction in dark territory.  
 
DOT estimates that dark territory totals approximately 89,000 miles of track.  DOT’s analysis 
focused on train movements in dark territory with traffic levels of 10 or more daily trains and 
where PIH carrying trains comprised 0.5 percent of all trains on those lines.

It is important to note that the impact of this requirement is a microanalysis and not a 
macroanalysis.  The requirement will impact only the percentage of dark territory where PIH 
tank cars are shipped.  In addition, if the current track speed is 30 mph or less, there will be no 
impact.  If it is a lightly used line, then the speed decrease for PIH shipments will probably not 
negatively impact a significant number of other deliveries on that line or cause freight to be 
diverted to highway.79  FRA’s review of the data identified that only on the very lowest density 
lines does the PIH traffic make up any significant portion of the total traffic. These low density 
lines appear to consist primarily of track into the facilities where the PIH materials are 
manufactured or used.  DOT does not have direct data, but it anticipates that these low density 
lines are primarily the lines which connect the facilities that manufacture and use PIH materials 
with the main line track.  The PIH traffic is more likely to impact other freight, possibly resulting 
in delivery delays or possible diversion to the highway for rail lines where the density of train 
movements is moderate or high.  Where this proposed requirement could cause a negative impact 
is if the particular dark territory line has intermodal trains or auto-rack shipments on it.  These 
deliveries are much more time sensitive for delivery than unit trains carrying coal, or general 
products like lumber.  However, for these medium and higher density lines, the PIH traffic 
makes up less than 4 percent of all traffic on the lines, which indicates that the potential impacts 
of the requirement would be low. 
 
DOT estimates that this proposed requirement would increase the variable cost per ton-mile. The 
variable cost per ton-mile used in this analysis is $0.01993.  DOT estimates that for the miles of 
dark territory track impacted, this cost will increase by 25 percent.  Based on FRA’s limited 
review of potential PIH routes, DOT believes that most of the impact (25 percent) is credited to 
reductions from 35 mph to 30 mph.  Thirty percent of the impact is credited to reductions from 
40 mph to 35 mph, and 20 percent is credited to reductions from 49 mph to 40 mph. As stated 
above, 49 mph is the maximum speed in dark territory, but due to a variety of factors, regulatory 
and operational, much of the dark territory operations actually occur at speeds lower than 49 
mph.  This is the basis for assigning the majority of the impact to reduction at the lower speed 
levels.  The proposal also provides a mechanism for the railroad to gain approval from the FRA 
to operate without the 30 mph speed restriction, when the proposed criteria are met.  Though not 
specifically included in the cost estimate, this flexibility will help the railroads to minimize the 
impact of the proposal on those segments of track that do currently operate at the higher speeds. 
 
To assess an impact or value for the impact from this proposed requirement, DOT has taken the 
dark territory lines with the most PIH materials traveling on them (most dense traffic) and 
aggregated the impacted million of gross ton-miles, approximately 13.4 million ton-miles.   DOT 
estimates that this impact will total approximately $24.3 million in the first, second, and third 
years.  After that, it would start to decrease as the new PIH tank cars come into service.  The 
total cost over the 30-year analysis for this proposal is $133.8 million. The discounted value of it 
over the same period is $106.4 million.  FRA has placed in the docket for this rulemaking a 
separate document containing a more detailed discussion of this analysis. 
 

                                                 
79   Obviously the potential benefits to be gained from a lightly used line would be less too.   However, note that the 
volume of traffic only decreases the exposure to the risk of the PIH materials.  It does not decrease the severity of 
any unfortunate event that may occur there. 

53 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

Finally, DOT requests comments on this impact.  The AAR has indicated that there is a high 
degree of capacity constraint on these dark territory lines. In practice, that could drive this cost 
higher. However, other, significant reviews by the FRA have not indicated a generalized capacity 
constraint on non-signalized line.  As a result, more detailed information about the level of 
capacity constraint on the impacted track would improve our analysis. However, DOT believes 
that the current cost estimate is also very close to the cost for the installation of a signal system 
on the impacted dark territory track, and this might provide an upper bound for the costs that the 
railroads would bear.  DOT invites comments on this analysis as well as the impact that would 
result were DOT to adopt a requirement of 35 mph instead of 30 mph. 
 
Note that this cost is an impact of the operating restriction that DOT is proposing in conjunction 
with its DOT PIH tank car.  There is not a similar requirement for the AAR Interchange 
Standard.   Thus this cost is only imposed on the proposed DOT PIH Tank Car. 
 
11.11  Regulatory Compliance 
 
This proposed rulemaking includes several compliance and paperwork burdens.  Note that any 
government related burdens for the regulatory compliance will not require additional federal 
resources.  The necessary services and time will be re-directed from other areas. 
 
Use of Tank Cars - Section 173.31 
 
In Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Section 173.31, DOT is proposing two new delimiters - “M” and “N.”   
Since there is already a list of delimiters for tank cars, this proposal only adds to the current list.  
The burden should be minimal or none.  
 
Reporting:  Section 173.31 (b)(8)(iii) 
 
Section 172.31(b)(8)(iii) proposes to require that the owners of PIH tank cars submit to the FRA 
a progress report that shows the total number of in-service tank cars that are subject to the 
pertinent paragraphs of this section after the initial 5-year implementation period has passed.  
These owners would need to provide the number of cars in compliance with the enhanced head 
and shell protection requirements of proposed §§ 179.16(b) and 179.24.  In this report, the tank 
car owner would also certify that its fleet does not contain any tank car subject to paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii).80   
 
DOT estimates that the burden for this reporting requirement would be 5 minutes per pertinent 
tank car.  This requirement is estimated to cost $19,200 in the beginning of the sixth year of this 
analysis.81  In addition, DOT has provided a postage, envelope and handling charges of $1 per 
tank car reported.  This cost would total $7,650 which would also be in the beginning of the sixth 
year of the analysis. 

 

 

                                                 
80 This proposed requirement restricts the use of PIH tank cars that were manufactured using non-normalized steel 
for head or shell construction.  Under it, tank cars manufactured using non-normalized steel head or shell 
construction will no longer be authorized for the transportation of PIH materials five years after the effective date of 
the final rule. 
81 CALCULATION:   [($30.05 wage rate)* (5 minutes/60 minutes)*(15,300 * .5) = $19,157. 

54 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The total cost for this requirement is $26,800.  The discounted value of this over the 30-year 
analysis is $17,900. 
 
Marking:  Section 179.22 
 
The proposed rule requires that the new PIH tank cars have either an “N” or “M” as the specific 
marking instead of  an “A”, “J”, “S”, or “T.”  These requirements can be found in proposed 
paragraphs (e) and (f).  Since all tank cars currently are required to have markings on them, these 
markings are only for new tank cars.  Thus, these additional choices would not impose any 
additional burden. 
 
Demonstration of Compliance  
 
Compliance with the proposed enhanced tank-head and shell puncture resistance standards can 
be shown by computer simulation, by simulation in conjunction with substructure testing, by 
full-scale impact testing, or a combination thereof.  The lowest cost and lowest level of 
confidence is provided by simulation alone.  Substructure testing increases the confidence in 
simulation modeling, potentially with relatively modest costs, depending on the details of the 
substructure test.  The highest level of confidence is provided by full-scale impact testing, which 
also carries the greatest cost.   
 
It is difficult to estimate the cost or impact of this compliance item.  A manufacturer could 
demonstrate compliance by computer simulation.  DOT estimates that this would require each 
manufacturer to incur 250 hours of engineering time to demonstrate compliance of the first 
design and half of that time for the second design.  Assuming that five manufacturers would 
create two designs each, this would total $281,250 in the second year of the analysis.82  The 
discounted value of this cost over the 30-year analysis is approximately $246,000. 
 
It is potentially possible that one or a group of entities could provide the research for developing 
a computer tool for the modeling potential designs.  FRA has been conducting some of this 
research through its Office of Research and Development and the Volpe Center.  This could help 
reduce the cost of demonstrating the compliance of future designs. 
 
Risk Assessments:  Section 174.86(c)(2)  
 
In Section 174.86(c)(2), DOT proposes to limit the speed of trains carrying loaded PIH tank cars 
to 30 mph, unless they comply with the enhanced tank-head and shell requirements.  
Alternatively, railroads could provide risk mitigation by implementing some of the items noted 
in the proposed rule and completing a risk assessment that includes data and analysis showing 
how certain operating conditions provide an equivalent level of safety as under Part 236.  Section 
174.869(c)(2)(i) proposes that this risk assessment must be submitted to FRA’s Associate 
Administrator for Safety for review and approval. 
 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
82 CALCULATION: (5 builders) * (250 hours for compliance) * ($150/hour wage rate) = $187,500.   ($187,500) + 
1/2($187,500) = $281,250. 

55 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 

DOT does not expect a great number of these applications.  A typical submission might consist 
of a promise to install a switch position monitoring system, track integrity circuits except in areas 
where new rail is prevalent, and a temporary speed reduction to 40 mph during the period a 
positive train control system is installed on the wayside, together with relatively simple 
calculations.  DOT expects that the average submission would be between 20 and 30 pages.   
 
DOT estimates that the average risk assessment will require 20 hours of engineering resources 
and 5 hours of other resources.  DOT estimates that there will be a total of 10 of these 
submissions and they will be evenly spread across the second and third year of this analysis.  
This is estimated to cost a total of approximately $31,500.83  The discounted value of this is 
$26,615. 
 
11.12  Non-Normalized Steel 
 
Most steel alloys have the ability to resist fracturing changes with the temperature of the steel.  
With a decrease in temperature, ductile steel becomes brittle and is more easily fractured.  The 
change from ductile to brittle does not occur at a specific temperature.  Instead, the steel changes 
from ductile to brittle steel over a temperature range and the ductile characteristic gradually 
becomes brittle.  Ductile steel will deform before it fractures.  In contrast, brittle steel shows no 
evidence of deformation and upon breaking will exhibit a fracture.  Less impact energy is 
required to break brittle steel than to break the same steel when it is ductile.  The chemistry, heat 
treatment, and rolling process determine the temperature at which the steel will change from 
ductile to brittle and the amount of energy required to cause fracture.  A normalizing heat 
treatment is one method of lowering the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature.  This heat 
treatment also increases the energy absorbed as the steel fractures. 
 
In proposed Section 173.31(b)(8)(ii), tank cars manufactured using non-normalized steel for 
tank-head or shell construction are not authorized for transporting PIH materials 5 years after the 
effective date of the final rule.   
 
It is estimated that there are approximately 700 anhydrous ammonia tanks cars, and almost 3,600 
chlorine tank cars built prior to 1989 and manufactured using non-normalized steel.  
 
DOT does not expect this proposed requirement to have an additional cost impact.  First, this 
analysis already takes a burden for transferring the current chlorine and anhydrous ammonia cars 
to other service, which allows the use of such tank cars.  Second, the pre-1989 tank cars that 
were manufactured without normalized steel on the head and/or shell will be the first ones that 
are replaced by the new PIH tank cars.   
 
11.13  Diversion and Substitution 
 
The transportation of PIH materials represents 0.3 percent of the freight traffic carried by Class I 
railroads.  However, the three most recent incidents resulting in full release of PIH materials 
(Graniteville, Macdona, and Minot) have caused the cost of insurance to double for the railroads.  

                                                 
83 CALCULATION: [10 Risk Assessments * (20 engineering hours * $150 labor rate + 5 other hours * $30.05 labor 
rate) = $31,503].   

56 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

To the extent that this rulemaking raise shipping costs, customers and shippers may decide to try 
and substitute alternative chemicals.  Although DOT believes that unlikely, switching to 
adequate substitutes may actually lower the costs of the rulemaking.   
 
There is very little use of chlorine in the United States that could be replaced by another product.  
In most applications, the “substitution” of another product for chlorine is really not a feasible 
option.  Where product substitution is feasible, manufacturers are already marketing other 
products.  As noted above, the largest use of chlorine is in PVC home building supplies.  For this 
use, there is no substitute.  For water purification, bleach could be used, which is a much watered 
down version of chlorine, but it would require much larger quantities.  One of the limitations of 
using chlorine bleach instead of chlorine is that the bleach has a short shelf life and becomes less 
effective with time.  Chlorine, however, if stored properly has a very long shelf life.  In Europe, 
ozone is used to purify water, but that would not work in the United States due to environmental 
requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  In essence, the EPA 
requirement would still require that residual amounts of chlorine be used in the process. 
 
One example of a product substitution for chlorine was at the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment 
Facility in Washington, DC.  Like most wastewater treatment facilities, it used chlorine to 
disinfect water.  Because of its proximity to the Nation’s capitol and terrorism concerns, the 
facility switched to sodium hypochlorite, which is a safer alternative.84  However, utilizing 
sodium hypochlorite instead of chlorine at existing water treatment plants requires modifications 
to plant equipment and presents additional issues related to the physical quantity of the product 
required and storage of that product (in hot environments sodium hypochlorite must be stored in 
climate controlled areas).  Accordingly, these requirements limit the practicality of converting 
existing chlorine water treatment facilities to sodium hypochlorite facilities.   
 
Diversion to highways, as opposed to substitution, may actually have a net negative impact on 
safety.  FRA and PHMSA believe, however, that the diversion of chlorine from railroads, 
although feasible, is unlikely.  Chlorine could be diverted to being transported by highway tank 
cars, or by pipeline in some cases.  In addition, one feasible means of averting all risk associated 
with the transportation of chlorine is to build a small plant everywhere it is needed, although this 
would be extremely costly and may not be acceptable to the local communities.  The main 
material needed to produce chlorine is saltwater.  An inexpensive supply of electricity is also 
needed.   
 
Currently, there are approximately 85 highway chlorine tank trucks.  Most of them operate in the 
western part of the United States.  In general the trucks hold about 20 percent of the product that 
a rail tank car holds.  Moving more chlorine to highway tank cars would transfer the risk to the 
highways from the rails and probably increase the risk in the process.  Since a highway truck 
only carries 20 percent of the product that a rail car carries, there would be an increase in 
exposure.  It is difficult to know exactly how much the immediate cost would be for diverting 
chlorine to the highways.  One company paid $85,000 for a new highway tank car for the 
transportation of chlorine that was to be used in another country.  It is difficult to translate that 
figure into what a new highway tank car that would operate in the United States would cost.

Additionally, finding sufficient truck drivers to handle the additional chlorine traffic may be a 
problem. 
 
About 4 percent of the bulk chlorine is shipped via waterways on barges.  Two companies 
operate 17 barges on several waterways.  While this is feasible for delivery to some locations, it 
is not feasible as a means of transport to replace all, or a large portion, of the chlorine that is 
shipped via rail today. 
 
Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is used both in agriculture and industry.  For agricultural purposes, 
urea, urea ammonium nitrate, or ammonium nitrate could be used as substitutes.  Anhydrous 
ammonia has a free ammonia percentage of 86 percent.  The substitutes have a free ammonia 
percentage of 46 percent, 28-32 percent, and 34 percent, respectively.  These substitutes could be 
used for agricultural purposes.  For industrial purposes, however, there are no alternative 
chemicals that could replace anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia nitrate (NH4NO3) is the only one of 
these chemicals that is regulated besides anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia nitrate however has 
also been used in the creation of bombs and in terrorist actions.  Most importantly, all of these 
substitutes are produced from NH3 and the chemical industry’s ability to create these other 
materials is close to being maxed out.  Finally, it is important to note that the lower amount of 
ammonia in the substitutes would indicate that more of the product would be needed, which 
would increase the shipments of those substitutes.    
 
To replace 100 rail cars of anhydrous ammonia, 390 highway trucks would be needed.85

12.0  Benefits 
 
The benefits of the proposed rule fall into two sub-groups.  The first group consists of benefits 
that would accrue from avoidance of collision- and derailment-related PIH releases resulting 
from a combination of the enhanced tank car crashworthiness standards and operating speed 
restrictions.  This group of benefits includes reductions in casualties; property damage, including 
damage to locomotives, rail cars and track; environmental damage; evacuation and shelter-in-
place costs; track closures; road closures; and electric power disruptions.  Casualty mitigation 
estimates are based on a value of statistical life of $5.8 million.  This group of benefits also 
includes more difficult to monetize benefits such as the avoidance of hazmat accident related 
costs incurred by Federal, state, and local governments and impacts to local businesses.  As with 
costs, benefits associated with introducing DOT-compliant tank cars are reduced by the level of 
benefits that would accrue from replacing existing cars with AAR-mandated cars absent this 
rulemaking.  This analysis includes a scenario which DOT believes is the most realistic 
projection of benefits that would be realized, including the possibility of an event with 
moderately more severe consequences than has occurred in the past 10 years.  This approach 
recognizes the significant probability that, given the quantity of product released and the 
proximity of potentially affected populations to accident sites, in one or more events the 
consequences known to be possible will be realized, with loss of life on a scale not previously 
encountered.   
 
The second group of benefits consists of business benefits that would accrue in response to the 
operating speed restrictions and the enhanced tank car design.  This group includes fuel savings 
from economic efficiencies resulting from operating speed restrictions and repair savings from 
more salvageable tank cars.  Moreover, the residual value at year 30 of tank cars constructed to 
meet the enhanced standards proposed will be greater than the residual value of conventional 
tank cars and Trinity-like tank cars contemplated by AAR’s Interhange Standard.  Thus, the 
analysis includes a benefit reflecting the higher residual value for the new tank cars at year 30. 
   
Car-to-car impact speeds are expected to be approximately one-half of primary train collision or 
derailment speeds.  The rule would require that newly built tanks maintain integrity during 
secondary car-to-car impacts of up to 30 mph and shell side impacts of up to 25 mph.  This is a 
significant improvement over the performance of existing cars.  Design engineers may build a 
more extensive margin of safety into the car designs. 
 
Beneficiaries of reduced risk will be many different parts of society.  Beneficiaries include 
railroads and their employees, shippers, and members of the general public that are in areas that 
PIH tank cars are transported.  If one PIH release is avoided, that will result in reduction to the 
drain on local resources that an accident causes.  Emergency response personnel and equipment 
will not bear the additional expense associated with a release from the accident.  This benefit 
may be high in the case of a large release or quite modest if there is no or a smaller release. 
 
The primary benefits expected to accrue from this proposed regulation are reductions in the 
number of casualties.   
 

61 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

Benefits of avoiding some PIH material release from accidents also accrue to railroads.  These 
benefits include the reduction in railroad property damages (locomotives, cars, and track).  
Additional benefits to railroads include the elimination of track out-of-service expenses.  These 
out-of-service expenses include train delays and rerouting costs associated with the track being 
out-of-service.  If the accident occurs on a single main track, it is more costly than if the area is 
double tracked.  Where the area has more than one track, traffic can be more easily diverted 
around the affected track.   
 
Accident data from the past is utilized to predict future potential benefit assessments from the 
proposed requirements to build enhanced PIH tank cars and to follow pertinent operating 
restrictions.

Note that the DOT PIH tank car proposal is proposing making use of the operational restrictions 
outlined by the industry and restrict the speed of trains moving TIH materials to 50 mph.  This 
means that if a derailment or collision were to occur the secondary car to car impact speeds will 
be roughly 25 mph.  DOT is proposing a performance standard for shell and head impacts where 
under a prescribed impact condition the commodity tank must maintain integrity for impacts at 
25 mph and 30 mph respectively.  Imposing such standards should significantly reduce the 
potential for complete failure/rupture of a PIH carrying tank car.   
 
Train collisions and derailments are very unique in nature.  Many of the circumstances that 
determine severity of an incident can also be rather unique.  Therefore, DOT is conservatively 
applying an effectiveness rate for car designs developed in compliance with the proposed 
performance standard of 85% for derailments or train collisions that occur at speeds at or below 

62 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

50 mph.86  DOT research has indicated that the estimated effectiveness for the AAR Interchange 
Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess for derailments or train 
collisions at speed at or below 50 mph.87 
 
12.1  Casualty Mitigation 
 
The risk of exposure to PIH material releases varies with the number of individuals exposed.  
Without knowing where a release may occur, a reliable estimate of individuals who may be 
exposed to PIH materials cannot be made.  Even when the location and census population is 
known, many factors affect the number of persons subjected to the toxic effects of the release, 
and the degree of that exposure, including presence of transient and special needs populations 
(on roadways, at playgrounds, nursing homes, hospitals, schools, etc.), product characteristics, 
rate of release, time of day, weather conditions, topography, and quality of the emergency 
response.  Benefits of risk reductions depend on the number and severity of exposures. 
 
The methodology utilized to estimate casualty mitigation in this analysis is based on the past 
accident data pool and the research that shows that a more crashworthy PIH tank car along with 
operating speed restrictions will be less likely to lose its integrity in an accident/incident or 
derailment.  Thus, implementation of the proposed standards would result in a decrease in the 
likelihood and severity of casualties.  DOT expresses this analysis as a probability that the 
severity of a casualty is mitigated.  Thus, when accidents/incidents or derailments occur 
involving these more crashworthy PIH tank cars, DOT anticipates fewer fatalities and injuries.  
The rupture of a PIH tank car or the loss of its integrity in an accident or derailment either occurs 
or does not occur.  It is more of a “yes/no” or “on/off” situation.  The most likely and desired 
outcome, if the proposed requirements are implemented successfully, is that no fatalities or 
injuries will occur.  
 
Relevant injuries from the past accidents were assessed for estimated injury severity levels 
utilizing the AIS.88  The AIS utilizes a system that assesses injuries with a numerical percentage 
of a statistical life.  This provides a means of aggregating all casualties as statistical lives.  The 
equivalent percentage of a life that an injury is assessed varies with the severity and location of 
the injury. 
 

12.1.1  DOT PIH Tank Car Proposal 

 

Once the DOT PIH tank car is fully implemented the severity mitigation would reach 100 
percent of its potential (85 percent effectiveness) or a total $23.6 million per year. 89  
Since the new DOT PIH tanks cars will be phased-in over a period of time, DOT expects 
that this benefit will be 100-percent phased-in by the ninth year of this analysis.   This 
benefit is calculated utilizing $5.8 million for the value of a statistical life saved (VSL).  

                                                 
86   Based on research that the Volpe Center has performed, DOT has confidence that the proposed standard would 
have minimally 85 percent effectiveness once it is fully implemented. 
87   Note that would equal 15 percent of 85 percent. 
88 Appendix B provides greater detail on the use of the AIS, and it also provides an explanation on the “willingness 
to pay” method of assessing casualties as benefits. 
89   The potential benefits here are based on one tenth of the value of avoiding the 4 major PIH rail incidents that 
occurred between 1996 and 2005. 

63 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 

For sensitivity purposes the benefit would total $13 million per year if the VSL was $3.2 
million, and $34.2 million if the VSL was $8.4 million.  Note the benefits for this 
alternative start accruing in the third year of the analysis. 

Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to this rulemaking 
is 85 percent, then the potential savings over 30 years is $590 million.  The discounted 
value of such benefit would be $198 million.   
 
 
12.1.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Once the AAR/Trinity-like tank car is fully implemented the severity mitigation would 
reach 100 percent of its potential or a total $4.2 million per year. 90  Since the AAR 
standard calls for the new tanks cars to be introduced between now and 2018 the benefits 
will be phased-in over a period of time, the potential benefits are estimated to be 100-
percent phased-in by the tenth year of this analysis.   This benefit is calculated utilizing 
$5.8 million for the value of a statistical life saved (VSL). For sensitivity purposes the 
benefit would total $1.9 million per year if the VSL was $3.2 million, and $5.1 million if 
the VSL was $8.4 million.  Note the benefits for this alternative start accruing in the third 
year of the analysis.  Note the benefits for this alternative start accruing in the second 
year of the analysis. 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings over 30 years is $86.8 million.  The discounted value of such benefit 
would be $28.8 million.   

 
12.2  Environmental Remediation and Damage 
 
The environmental remediation portion of the benefit assessment covers the determination of 
environmental remediation costs.  Some of the environmental remediation costs are associated 
with damage to bodies of water affected by the incidents.  The cost of chlorine or anhydrous 
ammonia cleanup are likely often not recorded or reported and, therefore, potentially not 
captured in this analysis.  However, two of the accidents in the data set did have some reported 
environmental cleanup costs related to water.  The Macdona accident reported $150,000 for 
environmental cleanup and the Minot accident reported $8,000,000.   
 

12.2.1  DOT PIH Tank Car Proposal 
 
It is estimated that the DOT proposed PIH tank car could produce benefits of $692,750 
per year from this benefit.  This is assuming the 85 percent effectiveness that the DOT 
research and development has predicted for the DOT proposed PIH tank car.  This benefit 
is phased-in over years 3 through 8 of this analysis.  For the thirty-year period of this 
analysis it totals $17.4 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $5.9 million.

12.2.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings over 30 years totals $2.6 million.  The discounted value of this 
benefit is $844,000.  Annually this is a potential savings of $122,250.   

 
Separately, the EPA assesses civil monetary penalties against railroads for violations of 
environmental regulations.  Assessments against railroads may also require the railroad to take 
remedial action or preventive measures, such as cleaning up the affected site, purchasing new 
equipment, and forming environmental response plans.  The civil penalties represent a transfer 
payment, a monetary payment from the railroad to the Federal Government, and not a real 
resource cost.  Such monetary payments are used for general public welfare.  The remedial and 
preventive measures do represent real expenditures.  In addition, the administrative costs 
associated with the transfer payment, such as the time and materials needed for assessing, 
collecting, and accounting for the civil penalty, are real resource costs.  The proposed rule 
potentially will reduce the number of EPA assessments against railroads.  The resulting reduction 
in civil monetary penalties, while an actual private benefit to the railroad, are a transfer payment 
and not included in the regulatory analysis.  The reduced administrative costs are likely to be 
relatively minor.  The primary social benefit of less environmental damage is accounted for 
above, using data from actual accidents. 
 
12.3  Track Delay, Rerouting, and Associated Out-of-Service Expenses 
 
The Graniteville accident occurred on January 6, 2005 at approximately 2:40 a.m. and train 
service resumed on January 29, 2005, at approximately 4:00 p.m.  The single main track was out 
of service for more than 23 days.  The costs associated with a single main track outage are 
extremely high for the owner of the track.  All traffic must be rerouted over other track.  If the 
company does not have trackage rights over alternate track, the distances could be large.  Larger 
distances have higher associated costs.  If trackage rights do exist the company has to pay the 
equivalent of a toll to use track it does not own.  Alternate track may also not be available at any 
price.  Track utilization in the United States is extremely high; it is estimated at over 90 percent. 
When traffic is rerouted, it slows down other traffic and has far reaching effects on the system.  It 
is frequently estimated that blocking a single main line for 1 hour costs approximately $1 
million.  Obviously, this amount depends on numerous factors.  Some single main line track 
outages cost less than $1 million per hour and some cost more than that amount.  In Graniteville, 
the track was out of service for more than 23 days, or 565 hours.  At approximately $1 million 
per hour, 565 hours equates to $565 million.  Because all associated costs and rerouting 
decisions and effects are not known, a conservative estimate of $2 million per day will be used to 
estimate the value of out-of-service time for the track.  Therefore, the total estimate value for 
track out-of-service time is $46 million.   
 
For the Minot derailment in 2002, track was out of service for 5 days.  The information on this 
track out of service is not as clear as with Graniteville, so using the same type of logic and a  
$1 million a day value (versus $2 million a day), the total lost value was estimated to be $5 
million.  For the Macdona accident in 2004, the mainline track and siding involved were out of 

65 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

service for at least 2 days.  This mainline track was the UP’s main artery into and out of the Gulf 
Coast, i.e., Houston and New Orleans.  This mainline also provided service into the United States 
largest point of rail interchange with Mexico (Laredo).  It was also a route on which Amtrak 
operated.  Thus, the value used here is the same as Graniteville, $2 million per day for lost use.  
The total loss for 2 days out of service was estimated to be $4 million.  It is also known that the 
Class 3 track involved in the Alberton derailment was out of service.  It is not known how long 
this track was out of service, and therefore this analysis assumes that the track was out of service 
for at least one day at the value of $1 million. 

 

 
12.3.1  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 

 

 

For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this benefit could total $5.6 million per year from 
decreasing track outages, however, given that the estimate of the success that might be 
accredited to this rulemaking is 85 percent this translates to a benefit of $4.76 million per 
year.  This benefit is phased-in over years 3 through 8 of this analysis.  For the thirty-year 
period of ths analsyis it totals $119 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $39.9 
million. 

12.3.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $17.5 million for the thirty year period.  The discounted value 
of this benefit is $5.8 million.  This produces a yearly benefit potential of $714,000 per 
year, which is phased-in over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.   

 
12.4  Disruption of Electrical Power 
 
At least one of the accidents noted above resulted in the disruption of electrical power to 
residences and business located near the accident site.  It is difficult to know the full value of 
having electricity supplied to a home or business.  DOT assumes that the value was at least $100 
per residence or business.  When the data concerning the length (in days) of the disruption was 
not available DOT assumed that the outage lasted for 3 days.91  Thus the lost value from this 
disruption was estimated to be $1,692,000. 
 

12.4.1  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this benefit could total $3.6 million per year from 
reducing the disruption of electrical power.  The discounted value of this benefit is $1.2 
million.  This benefit is phased-in over years 3 through 8 of this analysis.  For the thirty-
year period of ths analsyis it totals $3.6 million.  This produces an annual benefit of 
$143,820. 

 

12.4.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 

                                                 
91 This is an estimate on which DOT would encourage and request additional data.  Please submit comments related 
to this issue to the docket for this rulemaking. 

66 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $529,000.  The discounted value of this benefit is $175,000.  
This produces a yearly benefit potential of $22,000 per year.  This benefit is phased-in 
over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.   

 
12.5  Evacuations  
 
In the four fatal accidents included in the data analysis there were evacuations.  Information for 
some accidents was more robust than for others.    
 
As a result of the 2005 Graniteville accident, approximately 5,400 people were evacuated for 
varying periods of time.  The evacuation periods varied between 9 and 13 days.  FRA used a 
value for the lost time away from a home or business for an individual of $200 per person, per 
day.92  For Graniteville this is a lost value of $10,470,000. 
 
The 2004 Macdona accident (collision) resulted in approximately 65 people being evacuated for 
51 days. Using the same value for evacuation described above results in a lost value of $663,000.  
As a result of the 2002 Minot derailment, approximately 100 people were evacuated for 41 days.  
The estimate for the lost value is $820,000.  In response to the 1996 Alberton derailment, 
approximately 1,000 people were evacuated for 14 days.  The estimated value for the lost value 
is $2,800,000. 
 
The potential savings over 30 years from avoiding evacuations is more than $44 million. 
 

12.5.1  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this benefit could total $3.6 million per year from 
mitigation of the need to evacuate communities.  This benefit is phased-in over years 3 
through 8 of this analysis.  For the thirty-year period of ths analsyis it totals $31.4 
million.  This produces an annual benefit of.$1.254 million. 

 

12.5.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $4.6 million  The discounted value of this benefit is $1.53 
million.  This produces a yearly benefit potential of $188,000 per year.  This benefit is 
phased-in over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.   

 
Shelter in Place 
One of the four fatal incidents discussed above resulted in local residents having to “shelter-in-
place.”  It is difficult to assess a value for this situation (which in the case of Minot, included loss

of power during very cold temperatures).  DOT assumed $100 per day, per person for lost value.  
The value of this loss totals $100,000 per year. 
 

12.5.3  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this benefit could total $85,000 per year from 
mitigation of the need to evacuate communities.  This benefit is phased-in over years 3 
through 8 of this analysis.  For the thirty-year period of ths analsyis it totals $2.125 
million.  This produces an annual benefit of $713,000. 

 

12.5.4  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $312,000.  The discounted value of this benefit is $104,000.  
This produces a yearly benefit potential of $12,750 per year.  This benefit is phased-in 
over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.   

 
12.6  Property Damage 
 
In all four of the fatal incidents noted, there was property damage, some of which was rather 
significant.  It is important to note that the property damage used in this analysis, for the most 
part, includes only the damage figures that railroad are required to report to the FRA according 
to 49 CFR Part 225.  Thus, there probably is damage that is not taken into account because it was 
not reported.  For example, in the Graniteville accident, the damage that was reported does not 
include any environmental damage off of the railroad property, such as the damage incurred by 
the local community (homes and businesses).  The damage included primarily is for damage to 
railroad rolling stock and equipment, as well as to track and signal systems.  Damage to the 
railroad-related lading would also be included. 
 
For the 2005 Graniteville derailment, railroad damages were reported as $6,900,000.  For the 
2004 Macdona accident, the two railroads involved reported damages of $6,323,068.  For the 
2002 Minot derailment, the railroad damages were reported as $2,666,000; and for the 1996 
Alberton derailment, the railroad reported damages of $3,900,000.93 
 
DOT believes that these damages are only a fraction of the total damages that the railroads 
assumed from the incidents.  This is discussed in greater detail in Section 12.12 of this analysis. 
 

12.6.1  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
This benefit is phased-in over years 3 through 8 of this analysis.  For the thirty-year 
period of ths analysis it totals $48 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $16.1 
million.  This produces an annual benefit of $1.9 million. 

 

                                                 
93 The dollar value of these damages has been adjusted to 2007 values.  For Graniteville that is $7.360 million; for 
Macdona it is $6.974 million; for Minot it is $3.088 million, and for Alberton it is $5.179 million. 

68 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

12.6.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $7.1 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $2.3 
million.  This produces a yearly benefit potential of $288,163 per year.  This benefit is 
phased-in over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.   

 
12.7  Other Transportation Disruption 
 
Road Closures 
All of the fatal accidents in the data set included the closure of major roads for a period of time.  
For example, the Minot derailment caused all streets and highways leading into the city, 
including US Highways 2, 52, and 83 and Ward County 15 to be closed for a period of time.  
The Alberton derailment closed Interstate 90 for 17 days and caused an 81-mile detour.  This 
Interstate highway was closed for 17 days.  The loss value for it was estimated to be at least 
$750,000 per day. 
 
 

12.7.1  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
This benefit is phased-in over years 3 through 8 of this analysis.  For the thirty-year 
period of ths analysis it totals $31.6 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $10.6 
million.  This produces an annual benefit of $1.3 million. 

 

12.7.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $4.6 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $1.5 
million.  This produces a yearly benefit potential of $189,340 per year.  This benefit is 
phased-in over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.   

 
12.8  Benefits from Non-Fatal Accidents During the 10-year Period from 1996-2005 
 
Appendix C of this analysis (“List of Accident-Caused Releases of TIH Materials from Tank 
Cars 1965-2005 Report”) lists the 18 accidents that resulted in releases from 1996-2005.  
However, two of those accidents occurred in Canada and are therefore not included in this 
analysis of benefits.  Four of those accidents involved fatalities and are discussed in the previous 
section.  Of the remaining 12 accidents, two did not have reports available in the FRA 
accident/incident database.  The reports not in the FRA database are for the 1997 Elkhart, 
Indiana, release and the 2003 Camden, New Jersey, release.  Therefore, the data used for the 
1997 Elkhart release impacts is from the NTSB Report.  In the 2003 Camden, New Jersey, 
release the cause of the lading loss in this accident is listed as “pressure plate missing,” and 
therefore does not qualify for this analysis.  Three other reports have causes for lading loss that 
do not qualify them for this analysis (gauging device loose, gauging device broken, and safety

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

valve broken).  The damage estimates for equipment and track are given for the year the accident 
occurred and in 2005 dollars.  The BLS inflation calculator was used to adjust these estimates for 
2005 dollars.94   
  
The eight remaining PIH tank car releases that occurred from 1996-2005, other than the Minot, 
Macdona, Graniteville, and Alberton accidents, did not have any fatalities.  The total damage 
estimates from these accidents is $9,600,595.22.  These damage estimates do not include the 
costs of disruption to the transportation process that are incurred for these accidents.  At a 
minimum, any hazardous release extends the dwell time of all cars that are located in a yard 
where the accident occurs, or trains that are not allowed to enter an area due to a hazardous 
material release.  Extending the dwell time extends the shipping time and can impose costs on 
shippers.  Railroads need additional personnel to reduce shipping backlogs that these accidents 
cause.  The disruption to the transportation process may affect as few as 20 to over 2,500 cars per 
accident.  The table below summarizes the eight accidents at issue.

This Table and the potential benefits reflect the 2008 update for the DOT Value of a Statistical 
Life (VSL).   The annual potential (at 100 percent effectiveness) for this benefit is $1.17 million.  
This is based on the the data being from a 10 year period and taking the average of those totals. 
 

12.8.1  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this benefit could total $994,000 per year from 
decreasing track outages, given that the estimate of the success that might be accredited 
to this rulemaking is 85 percent. This benefit is phased-in over years 3 through 8 of this 
analysis.  For the thirty-year period of ths analysis it totals $24.9 million.  The discounted 
value of this benefit is $8.3 million.   

                                                 
95 Oleum refers to a solution of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid or sometimes more specifically to pyrosulfuric acid, 
disulfuric acid. An advantage of oleum is that it can be shipped in bulk liquid railcars, because it is solid at room 
temperature and thus enhances the safety of the shipment. It can be converted into a liquid at the destination by 
steam heating. 
96 Because the accident evacuation lasted less than 12 hours, a cost of $100 per evacuee was used. Other accidents 
are assigned $200 per day per evacuee.

12.8.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $3.65 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $1.2 
million.  This produces a yearly benefit potential of $149,075 per year.  This benefit is 
phased-in over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.   

Incidental Safety Benefits 

 
 
12.9 
 
The proposed rule may also create some incidental safety benefits  when other hazardous 
materials  are  carried  in  trains  with  reduced  operating  speed  as  a  result  of  the  rule’s 
operational  restrictions.    For  a  variety  of  reasons,  railroads  typically  transport  hazardous 
materials in “key trains.”  If a key train consist includes cars carrying PIH materials, and 
must slow to a speed of 30 mph or less in dark territory, then the risk of loss of lading of 
other hazardous materials due to breaches in the tank cars that transport them is likely to 
decrease.  Some of the most expensive railroad accidents in history have involved releases 
of hazardous liquids which must be removed from the ground in order to avoid polluting 
groundwater used for drinking water.   
 
For example, on September 28, 1982, several cars of an Illinois Central Gulf freight train 
derailed  at  Livingston,  Louisiana.    As  a  result  of  the  derailment,  one  tank  car  spilled 
approximately  14,000  gallons  of  perchloroethylene  (an  HOC).    Two  weeks  after  the 
incident, 
(DNR)  detected 
perchloroethylene in  concentrations of up to 25 parts per million (ppm) in the soil at the 
derailment  site.    It  was  also  discovered  that  the  chemical  migrated  well  beyond  the 
derailment location.   
 
At  the  time,  the  town  of  Livingston  obtained  its  drinking  water  from  wells  by  tapping  a 
deep aquifer and, to prevent human health risks from the chemical, the DNR established a 
0.3 ppm concentration of perchloroethylene as the criteria for the maximum safe level of 
groundwater contamination.  Since the accident, the railroad has incurred over $20 million 
dollars in liabilities for environmental clean-up. 
 
In  addition,  in  a  1990  report,97  the  AAR  estimates  that  the  release  of  HOCs  in  railroad 
accidents  has  resulted  in  environmental  clean-up  costs  exceeding  $50  million  over  the 
previous  10  year  period  of  the  report.    They  also  estimated  that,  even  though  these 
materials  accounted  for  less  than  one  percent  of  the  total  car  volume  of  hazardous 
materials  movements,  their  releases  amount  to  60  percent  of  all  railroad  environmental 
clean-up costs during the time period studied

Although PHMSA and FRA have since taken many steps to reduce the likelihood and severity of 
liquid spills since the time of this accident and follow-up report, DOT believes the reduced speed 
required by the proposed rule may reduce this risk even further. 
 
12.10  Fuel Savings from Operating Restrictions 
 
This proposed rule has two operating requirements that restrict the speed of trains carrying PIH 
materials.  DOT anticipates that these requirements will produce cost savings in the area of fuel 
consumption. 
   
It is true that locomotives use more fuel at higher speeds.  The Davis Formula shows that the 
wind resistance would be the cause of this phenomenon.98  The rolling dynamics of the train 
make it more efficient up to 10 mph but the aerodynamics and wind resistance cause the fuel 
efficiency to go down from there.  For example, the resistance for a locomotive traveling at 50 
mph is almost three times the resistance for the same locomotive traveling at 12 mph.   
 
It is also true that having a lower operating speed will encourage railroads to utilize pacing, 
which would further contribute to the fuel savings.  In general, pacing, when utilized judiciously, 
will save fuel.  Essentially, it allows a locomotive to use the minimal amount of fuel to get from 
one point to another. 
 
It is difficult to estimate fuel savings.  It is also difficult to assess how much of the savings would 
be due to this proposed rule.  DOT estimates that the savings from the operating restrictions are 
easily twice the amount of the annual fuel costs that this rule imposes due to increased weight, 
which can be found in Section 11.6.  (In addition, there should be additional fuel savings due to 
the pacing.  However, this rule does not calculate any benefit for that operation.  It is up to the 
individual railroads to actually implement such savings.)  However, this rule will not take credit 
for all of the savings.  DOT estimates that only 85 percent of this would be credited to this 
rulemaking. The first year of this savings is estimated to total $24.3 million.  This benefit should 
decrease as more of the new strengthened tank cars are added to the PIH tank car fleet.  Although 
the 50 mph limit will not disappear as new PIH tanks cars are added to the fleet, the impact and 
the need to restrict trains to 30 mph in dark territory will decrease as new cars are added.  Thus, 
it will decrease every year.  By the ninth year of the analysis it is estimated to total $4.87 million.  
The total savings is estimated to total $243.4 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is 
$138.8 million. 
 
12.11  Fewer Destroyed PIH Tank Cars 
 
The main purpose of this proposed rulemaking is to have PIH tank cars designed and built that 
are capable of sustaining derailments or collisions.  Therefore, more PIH tank cars will survive 
crashes, accidents, derailments, etc. without the loss of the tank car’s integrity.  Thus, more of 
these cars will not be scrapped or destroyed.   
 
If a heavier car of the existing design (i.e., a Trinity-like tank car) is involved in an accident that 
results in structural deformation, but no puncture damage, the car is more likely to be scrapped 
                                                 
98 See http://www.uwm.edu/~horowitz/PropulsionResistance.html 

 

73 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

and replaced than it is to be repaired due to the cost of structural deformation damage repair and 
residual liability.  On the other hand, the DOT-compliant PIH tank car would have an energy 
absorbing layer that would significantly reduce the probability of non-puncture structural 
deformation resulting from certain accidents, making repairs more feasible.  Basically this means 
that DOT proposed PIH tank car’s “tank” is less likely to be impacted.  This is because the 
intermediate layers of protection will absorb the impact therby preventing contact with the tank 
shell.  This is especially true at lower speeds where the current (and Trinity-like) tank car shells 
will sustain damage from the impacting item, e.g., coupler, end of car, rail or other equipment.  
Given that railroads currently scrap tank cars that have relatively minor damage, this translates to 
improved tank car salvagability.  Note that this benefit would exist for the DOT proposed PIH 
tank car but not the AAR Interchange Standard (Trinity-like tank car). 
 
This analysis is taking a benefit for this improvement.  DOT estimates that once the entire fleet is 
replaced, approximately five PIH tank cars will be saved per year that would not have been 
saved based on the previous build standards.  This benefit will be phased-in starting in the fourth 
year of the analysis.  DOT uses an average value of $100,000 per PIH tank car saved.  In the 
ninth year, this benefit totals $500,000 per year.  The total savings for this benefit is $12.2 
million.  The discounted or PV of this savings is $4 million. 
 
12.12  Operating Restrictions Safety Benefit 
 
Safety benefits are also expected to accrue from the 30-mph speed restriction that would be 
imposed in years one through eight.  Although the purpose of imposing this restriction is to 
provide an increased level of safety for movements with higher risk levels (i.e., those along dark 
territory) until the more crashworthy PIH tank cars (proposed in this rulemaking) are introduced, 
the speed restriction will not reduce the risk of release from train collision occurring at speeds 
between 20 and 30 mph.  Thus, the safety benefits resulting from the speed restriction would not 
be as high as the benefits that would accrue for using the more crashworthy PIH tank cars.  
Conventional tank cars protect well for train collision levels up to 20 mph.  Historically, 
conventional equipment has performed better at speeds between 20 and 30 mph than at higher 
speeds.  Between 1980 and 2005), only six percent of train accidents that resulted in relevant full 
releases (involving head or shell rupture) occurred at train speeds between 20 and 30 mph – with 
no resulting fatalities.  Therefore, the effectiveness of a 30 mph speed restriction at large can 
reasonably be expected to be at least 90%.99  However, since speeds would be restricted only for 
movements in dark territory this estimate is adjusted.  Sixty percent of the chlorine and 
anhydrous ammonia releases in the US analyzed since 1965 and 1980, respectively, occurred in 
dark territory.  Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to assume that restricting the speed of 
existing tank cars transporting PIH materials in dark territory  would provide slightly more than 
half (0.90 x .60, or roughly 55%) of the total potential safety benefits. These benefits would be 
phased-out as new tank cars are introduced.  
 

                                                 
99   FRA research into the collision dynamics of train collisions and derailments has provided information that the 
secondary car to car impact speeds are roughly one-half the initial train speed.  Collisions where the tank cars are 
situated away from the primary collision degenerate into a derailment situation. 

74 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

There is also a residual benefit from the 50-mph operating restriction that continues to accrue in 
years 9 through 30.  DOT conservatively estimates that this would annually be approximately 2 
percent of the primary safety benefits total or $464,000 per year. 
 
The total potential value of these benefits over a 30-year period is $74.1 million.  The discounted 
value of this total is approximately $54.4 million. 
 
12.13  DOT Estimate of Difficult to Quantify “Miscellaneous” Societal Benefits100 
 
There are numerous damages and expenses that are incurred directly and indirectly from a spill 
or release of a PIH material.  The magnitude of the impact of these will vary depending on 
factors such as the location of the incident and the number of cars that release material.  
Unfortunately, such impacts are difficult to express in quantitative or monetary terms, thus they 
are often described only qualitatively. 
 
These benefits include non-railroad property damages (which have not been accounted for above 
in this analysis); impacts on local businesses; Federal, state and local response efforts; and 
unaccounted for impacts on the environment. 
 
Impacts to Businesses and Commerce 
After spending over $140 million on cleaning, repairs, and damage mitigation as a result of the 
derailment, in July 2006, Avondale Mills, a textile manufacturer, closed its 10 mills in South 
Carolina and Georgia.  At the time of its closure, the company employed approximately 4,000 
people and found itself unable to recover financially from the derailment.  For example, 
Avondale Mills was unable to identify cleaning and restoration protocols that would successfully 
or economically halt the chlorine’s corrosive effects, repair the damage caused by the chlorine 
exposure, and return the affected facilities and equipment to their pre-derailment condition.  As a 
result, Avondale Mills was faced with an expensive replacement of damaged assets in addition to 
the lost business, higher manufacturing costs, and lower profits related to the reduction in 
productive capacities resulting from the derailment.  Ultimately, the company concluded that it 
was not prudent to continue to invest in the repair or remediation of the damage caused by the 
derailment and that profitable ongoing operation of the company’s business, or any portion of the 
Company’s business, was not feasible based on the damage caused by the derailment. 
 
In May 2006, Avondale Mills reached a $215 million settlement with its primary property and 
casualty insurer for claims relating to the derailment.  Avondale Mills has a pending lawsuit 
against Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) seeking $420 million in damages. 
 
This incident impacted all Avondale Mills employees, not just those who were at the facility at 
the time of the incident.  The employees who survived the incident were eventually left jobless.  
Many who had highly specialized skills acquired through many years of work at the 
manufacturing facility had to be retrained so they could acquire skills that would make them 
marketable.  Their former productivity levels were replaced with lower productivity levels in 
new jobs.  The months that former Avondale Mills employees were away from productive jobs, 

                                                 
100   Note:  This benefit is only included in the benefit totals for Case 2, and Case 3 of this analysis.  A discussion of 
this can be found in Section 14 of the RIA. 

75 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

while they received unemployment compensation and were retrained, translated into lost 
productivity that will not be recovered.  For many, the product of their hard work during this 
time resulted in productivity levels that may never rival the levels they had reached at Avondale 
Mills. 
 
The NS had commercial insurance to cover incidents such as this, beyond the retention amount.  
Up to the retention amount railroads are basically self-insuring the costs/damages and burdens.  
NS notes that its commercial insurance policies were expected to cover “substantially all 
expenses related to this derailment” beyond the retention amount.  These costs included NS’ 
response cost and legal fees.101  In 2005, NS recorded expenses of $ 41 million related to this 
incident.  This burden includes property damage and other economic losses, personal injury and 
individual property damage claims as well as third-party response costs.102   
 
It should be noted that railroads can be liable or have claims filed from many different entities 
and individuals related to incidents like this.  For example, the Minot incident in 2002 resulted in 
over 20,000 claims filed against the railroad.  Three years after that incident the number of 
claims for that anhydrous ammonia release was about 25,000.103 
 
Federal, State, and Local Government Response Efforts 
For a railroad incident with a PIH material release there are many government entities that 
respond and provide valuable services during the period following such a disaster.  For example, 
operating under a unified command structure, 111 agencies participated in the Graniteville, 
South Carolina response. The responsibility for enforcing the evacuation fell to the South 
Carolina Highway Patrol, the South Carolina Transport Police, the Aiken County Sheriff’s 
Office, and other law enforcement from around the State. The U.S. Coast Guard assigned a Gulf 
Coast strike team to the emergency. 
 
According to the South Carolina State Emergency Operations Center, in response to the 
Graniteville incident, between 200 and 300 law enforcement officers from various agencies 
assisted the Aiken County Sheriff’s Office in patrolling the overall incident and enforced the 
curfew.  In addition, officers from Aiken County, Greenwood, City of Columbia, Lexington 
County, Orangeburg, Beaufort, South Carolina Highway Patrol, and State Law Enforcement 
Division conducted security operations throughout the night. 
 
The Graniteville-Vaucluse-Warrenville Fire Department operates five engines, one ladder, one 
service truck, and two first responder/rescue vehicles from three stations. The headquarters 
station of this department was located about 100 yards from the Graniteville train derailment site. 
Despite the equipment losses and injuries due to the chlorine exposure the fire department 
maintained control of the response and continued to provide public protection during the 
incident.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted air quality monitoring and 
assessed the level of fish kill in Langley Pond, the largest pond in the world, which is 
downstream from the derailment site. State environmental and natural resource agencies also 
evaluated nearby bodies of water.  Ten days after the incident they completed an evaluation of 
the fish kill along Horse Creek and Langley Pond. 
 
Schools within a 1-mile radius were closed.  Although, this cost was included in the evacuation 
costs quantified in the analysis, the related cost of air sampling conducted, wiping down 
surfaces, and discarding many opened and unopened food supplies before allowing schools to 
reopen was not. 
 
The South Carolina Emergency Management Division coordinated the deployment of the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security Pre-Positioned Equipment Pod (PEP) that provided 
“truckloads” of protective equipment to incident first responders. The Graniteville emergency 
marked the first time that the PEP “pod” system has been used. PEP is comprised of highly 
specialized equipment, as well as off-the-shelf items, stored in 11 pods dispersed nationwide and 
transportable by land or air within one to 12 hours. Through formal request, the Federal 
government transfers custody of these assets to local officials.  
 
In most major disaster situations, the local communities set up shelters for the residents that are 
dispersed from their homes and for responders.  In addition, communities help feed displaced 
residents and emergency responders.   
 
Unaccounted for Impacts on the Environment 
According to the EPA, the chlorine released in the Graniteville incident required twelve days to 
be completely purged from the rail tank car and the area immediately around it.  During that time 
the EPA was monitoring the transfer of chlorine vapor from the damaged rail tank car and 
worked with local school officials to conduct air monitoring and sampling at two schools.   
 
A separate concern in the aftermath of the Graniteville incident was the degree to which homes 
in the evacuation area were contaminated or damaged by the chlorine.  The EPA and NS 
contracted with the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health to do home inspections.  At 
least 550 homes were inspected. 
 
Chlorine gas is more than twice as heavy as air.  Therefore, it can settle in low lying areas in the 
absence of wind.  Humans detect the presence of chlorine at as low concentrations of 1 to 3 ppm.  
At 30 ppm, coughing and pain result; at 430 ppm death results in as little as 30 minutes.  Higher 
concentrations can cause rapid fatality.  Chlorine gas reacts with water in the air to form vapors 
of hydrochloric acid and liberate nascent oxygen, both of which cause massive tissue damage. 
 
In an aquatic environment, chlorine gas reacts with water to form hypochlorous acid and 
hydrochloric acid. The breakdown of hydrochloric acid causes a decrease in the pH of the water, 
making it more acidic.  These changes in water chemistry can cause wide spread damage to 
aquatic environments, including fish kills.  In the Graniteville incident, fish kills occurred in two 
bodies of water (a creek and a large pond) in the vicinity of the release site. 
 

77 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 

If chlorine gas is released into soil, chlorine will react with moisture forming hypochlorous acid 
and hydrochloric acid. These compounds can react with other substances found in soil.  
Contamination of the soil would require removal to avoid contamination of ground water. 
 
Impact of PIH Accidents on Shipping Rates 
Although insurance premiums themselves would be considered “transfer” payments, and 
therefore are not included in this analysis, they represent actual consequences to railroads and 
shippers of PIH materials.  This analysis attempts to capture as much of the increased risk-of-loss 
to society that the increased premiums represent. 
 
It is also important to note that these types of incidents have caused the costs that railroads pay 
for insurance to escalate.  AAR President Edward Hamberger noted “The Federal Government 
today, through railroads’ common carrier obligation, requires railroads to transport these 
shipments [PIH], whether they want to carry them or not.  Every time a railroad moves one of 
these shipments, though, it faces potentially ruinous liability.  The insurance industry is 
unwilling to insure the railroads against the multi-billion-dollar risks associated with highly-
hazardous shipments.”104  The railroads have also noted that the transport of PIH materials 
represents 0.3 percent of their business, but the exposure to the liability of the PIH materials has 
more than doubled their insurance costs. 
 
This increase in risk, and/or the rail insurance rates is reflected in rail shipping rates for PIH 
materials.  Minimally, the rates for the transport of PIH materials have doubled.  It is noted that 
some of the rates of carriers have increased by four times.105  It is also apparent that the rates do 
not appear to be stabilizing, and railroads claim that with their rate increases, they are still not 
fully-compensated for the substantial risks they undertake in the transportation of PIH materials.  
It is actually anticipated that these rates are on an upward increase for the foreseeable future.  To 
the extent that this rulemaking has greater benefits than costs, in other words, if the mitigation 
measures required in this rulemaking are less costly than the expected damages due to 
derailments, this proposed rulemaking may cause the rates to stop increasing and possibly start 
going down or at least stay flat.  This is because this proposed rulemaking will significantly 
reduce the risks of a PIH tank car losing its integrity in an accident/incident or derailment.   
 
Miscellaneous Items Related to the Graniteville Incident 
There are also additional miscellaneous impacts or burdens that were associated with the 
Graniteville accident.  For instance, the Federal Aviation Administration instituted a Temporary 
Flight Restriction at 11:10 AM on January 6, with a 5-mile radius from the surface to 3,000 feet.  
(This was reduced to a 3-mile radius on January 9, and was decreased to 2,000 feet on January 
13).   
 
South Carolina Electric & Gas (SCE&G) needed to conduct an analysis of components in its 
heavily damaged power stations that served the Graniteville area and at Avondale Mills.  
Because of size of the disaster at Graniteville, the cleanup of the substation at the textile mill was 

                                                 
104 Statement of Edward Hamberger, President & CEO, AAR, before U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee 
on Railroads, June 13, 2006. 
105 It is noted that one shipper had its rates increased over 4.8 times in a 2-year period.   This is a 240 percent 
increase per year.

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

delayed 17 days.  Avondale Mills had contracted Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) to do 
materials testing and assessment of all parts of the mill’s property. 
 
Lisa Detter-Hoskin, Senior Research Scientist at GTRI, noted that for locations such as 
Avondale Mills’ textile mill and the SCE&G substation that “[b]asically you had items sitting in 
an acid bottle for days.”106  Essentially the chlorine gas had plenty of moisture to react with, both 
on the surfaces and in the air, and it reacted with almost anything to transform it into reactive 
chorine derivatives.    
 
It is difficult to total or aggregate these miscellaneous societal burdens because they are so hard 
to quantify.  As noted above, Avondale Mills spent over $140 million on cleaning, repairs, and 
damage mitigation as a result of the derailment and was still unable to financially recover from 
the incident.  In addition, although Avondale Mills also reached a $215 million settlement with 
its primary insurer for claims related to the derailment, the company asserted that the amount 
was substantially less than the full value of the losses incurred as a result of the derailment and 
the company has a pending lawsuit against NS seeking $420 million in damages.  These could or 
could not be costs passed on to NS and its insurer.  DOT estimates that any of these figures, 
combined with the unaccounted for damages and expenses described in this section (e.g., impacts 
to businesses and commerce; Federal, State, and local government response efforts; unaccounted 
for impacts on the environment) would total over $350 million.  If half of the amount is 
discounted to ensure that there is no double counting of other damages quantified in this analysis, 
then this would produce a potential benefit pool of $175 million.  After dividing this number by 
ten the annual potential benefit would be $17.5 million.107

DOT has assessed an 85 percent effectiveness rate on this benefit, similar to the primary 
safety benefits.  The total potential value of this benefit over a 30-year period is $371.9

AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like tank car 

 

 

Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR

the potential savings totals $2,230,000.  The total potential value of this benefit over a 30-
year period is $53.7 million.  The PV of this total is approximately $17.5 million.

12.14  Residual Value of Tank Cars at the End of this Analysis 
 
The DOT proposed PIH tank cars have a higher residual value than existing cars, since the inner 
commodity tank, which is not subject to the in-train forces, can be placed in a new carbody.  
Existing cars are not handled in the same process because bolster frames are welded to the tank 
and removal is not a viable option.  With the proposed DOT tank car, once the outer tank reaches 
the mandated freight car life (40 years) the tank retains its usability and replacing the carbody is 
a more economic approach. Since this analysis is only run for 30 years, we are assuming this 
residual value can be recovered in the last year of this analysis. 
 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this value, which is entered as a benefit, is calculated by 
multiplying the number of PIH tank cars by the marginal cost of the improvements by 18 
percent.  This methodology only takes credit for the residual value of the improvements of the 
tank cars.  This is entered in the 30th year of the analysis.  The value is $110.2 million, and the 
discounted value of this is $14.5 million. 
 
For the AAR Interchange standard, i.e., Trinity-like tank car the benefit is calculated the same 
way.  However the marginal cost of the improvements were less so the total residual value 
calculated for the 30th year is less.  The value is $60.6 million, and the discounted value of this is 
$8 million. 
 
12.15  Moderate Case Scenario Benefit:  Graniteville Revisited108 
 
The accidents in Minot, Macdona, and Graniteville resulted in a relatively small number of 
fatalities compared to the potential that existed in each event.  This is primarily because of a 
number of factors that worked in the favor of the public.  These included time of day, ability of 
emergency responders to recover from exposure and formulate a plan, weather conditions, 
release quantity, and location of populations to the releasing material.  A change in any one of 
these conditions would most certainly have resulted in an increased number of fatalities and 
injuries. 
 
Modern risk assessment tools allow an analysis that combines an engineering analysis with 
historical data in a comprehensive and integrated way.  A December 2000 report issued under a 
Department of Energy contract109 suggests that the potential risk to large populations of people 
continues to exist despite the relatively sparse historical data available and low probability of an 
accidental release of PIH material from a railroad tank car.  This analysis, accomplished prior to 
the three aforementioned accidents, predicted 16 fatalities from railroad transportation every 10 
years.  In addition, the report highlighted the potential for a serious incident involving a high 
number of fatalities.  This potential has not presently been reduced.   
 
The potential for a rail transportation event is demonstrated by the 2007 calendar year data 
collected by FRA. In 2007 train accident rates declined by almost 14% yet accidents where 
hazardous materials were released rose by 42%.  One difficulty in understanding the numbers

relates to the fact that the results are developed from an extremely small dataset.  For example, 
train accidents involving hazardous materials rose from 28 in 2006 to 43 in 2007, even though 
both the total number of train accidents and the train accident rate declined over the period. 
 
The area affected from a release is directly related to the amount of energy imparted into the 
product upon release.  Generally this energy is imparted through heat from the surrounding air 
and ground.  Chlorine gas expands 450 times its liquefied amount at atmospheric conditions.  
Therefore the amounts released in Alberton, Macdona, and Graniteville had the potential of 
impacting areas 547,000; 565,000; and 554,000 cubic feet respectively.  The amount of ammonia 
released in Minot would have covered an area 16,700,000 cubic feet110.  These areas would be at 
near 100% concentrations. Given that the expanding vapors would disperse with atmospheric gas 
(air) the area impacted within the toxic limits would be significantly larger. 
 
Chlorine gas is heavier than air, and therefore, a chlorine gas cloud will remain low to the 
ground111.  How this cloud of chlorine gas dissipates or moves is determined by variables such as 
terrain, temperature, humidity, wind speed and its direction, and volume of the release.  Most 
importantly, a chlorine gas cloud can travel several miles within in a few hours and still maintain 
concentrations at or above toxic concentrations.  
 
Given the demographics and topography surrounding the previous accident sites, had these 
accidents occurred at a different time of day, or had any of the atmospheric variables been 
different (e.g., wind speed or direction, temperature, barometric pressure, or humidity), it is 
likely that many more people would have been exposed to the chlorine plume.  For instance, if 
the Graniteville accident had occurred while the Avondale Mills plant was fully staffed, or 
during an afternoon shift change, it is likely that hundreds of individuals would have been 
exposed.  Similarly, a middle school is located approximately 1,000 feet north of the accident 
site (well within the area of the plume that did occur).  Had the accident happened while school 
was in session, it is likely that approximately 500 students, along with scores of school staff, 
would have been exposed to the toxic plume. 
 
Significant gathering places (i.e. hospitals, schools, and places of worship) are often in proximity 
to railroads.  This proximity increases the likelihood that a significant number of people would 
be affected if a similar accident occurs during a time when the public is congregated in these 
areas.  
 
Similarly, if any atmospheric variable changes (e.g., wind speed or direction, temperature, 
barometric pressure, or humidity) it is likely that the chlorine plume will expand more rapidly 
and affect a greater area.  For instance, in Graniteville, at the time of the accident, a light wind 
was blowing in a south-southwest direction.  The accident site was located in a north-south 
valley where light winds caused air swirling and pocketing of gas.  If the wind had been blowing 
at the same intensity, but in a south-southeast direction, the chlorine plume could have hovered 
over the southeasterly side of the accident site, rather than the northwesterly side.  Southeast of 
the accident site is primarily a residential area and given the size of the plume that did result, the 
plume could have endangered approximately 185 homes.  Given the average household size of 

 

                                                 
110 Ammonia expands 850 times its liquid volume when converting to gas. 
111 Ammonia is lighter than air so the cloud would be higher than a chlorine release. 

81 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

2.68 in Aiken County,112 almost 500 people to the southeast of the accident site could have been 
exposed to vapors above the ERPG-3 level causing significantly more casualties and fatalities.113  
Had it been warmer, the additional atmospheric temperature would have provided additional 
energy for the chlorine to expand and it is likely that the chlorine plume would have expanded 
faster, thereby engulfing the area at a higher rate than experienced. 
 
The risk from a release is spread across the country, albeit at different rates depending on 
variables such as temporal, infrastructure, and atmospheric conditions (to name a few), and has 
the potential to impact any city or town in the United States.  Census data shows that cities 
containing 46 of the continental U.S. State capitals have railroads operating within their 
boundaries and all but 2 of the urbanized areas with populations greater than 50,000 are 
intersected by rail lines.114  
 
Another factor that impacts potential severity of an accident is the ability of emergency 
responders to identify and respond to a release.  In Macdona and Graniteville responding fire 
department personnel were overcome after driving into the chlorine plume.  These exposures 
adversely impacted the ability of the department personnel to address the problem.  Had these 
personnel been overcome to the point of incapacitation, the resulting fatalities would have 
greatly exceeded the actual outcome. 
 
Within the United States emergency response to accidents is provided through a network of more 
than 1.2 million fire department personnel.  However, the preponderance of these organizations 
are staffed by voluntary and unpaid workers; 93% of the 26,354 fire departments in the United 
States are represented by volunteer firefighters with 19,224 departments fully volunteer; 3,845 
mostly volunteer; and 1,407 mostly career.  The ability to train these personnel has continued to 
be a difficult task and the risk to the public is commensurate with their response.  The vast 
differences in capabilities to respond to an incident can either mitigate or exacerbate a release of 
PIH material from an accident.  
 
Location of emergency response equipment also plays a key role in determining potential risk.  
For example, the Graniteville-Vaucluse-Warrenville Fire Department operates five engines, one 
ladder, one service truck, and two first responder/rescue vehicles from three stations.  The 
headquarters station of this department was located about 100 yards from the Graniteville train 
derailment site.  The injuries sustained by firefighters during the initial response to the incident 
were the result of these personnel reporting in the early morning hours to the headquarters station 
where a primary response would have been launched from.  In addition, the switch for activating 
the community notification system was located in the headquarters station.  With the toxic cloud 
overcoming the station, this system was unavailable and caused significant delays in evacuation.

effects.”  See AIHA, Emergency Response Planning Committee, Procedures and Responsibilities, at 1 (Nov. 1,

With the proximity of the station to the incident, it is foreseeable that, if the incident had 
occurred during a time when the emergency response personnel were at the station, the ensuing 
vapor cloud might have resulted in the inability of these responders to effectively escape the 
concentrations at or above the level of "immediately dangerous to life and health" (IDLH); 
potential fatalities to the responders; and the potential for an ineffective emergency response, and 
therefore, additional fatalities. 
 
Hence is not hard to imagine an incident such as those previously experienced with a level of 
casualties moderately higher than what occurred.  DOT hypothetically predicted such a scenario 
with the casualty consequences for that accident if there had been a change in one of the 
variables.   
 

12.15.1  DOT Proposed PIH Tank Car 
 
For the DOT proposed PIH tank car this benefit could total $11.1 million per year from 
decreasing track outages, given that the estimate of the success that might be accredited 
to this rulemaking is 85 percent. This benefit is phased-in over years 3 through 8 of this 
analysis.  For the thirty-year period of ths analysis it totals $162 million.  The discounted 
value of this benefit is $68.9 million.   

12.15.2  AAR Interchange Standard – Trinity-Like  Tank Car 
 
Given that the estimate of the success for this that might be accredited to the AAR 
Interchange Standard/Trinity-like tank car is 15 % of the DOT tank car effectivess, then 
the potential savings totals $34.1 million.  The discounted value of this benefit is $11.2 
million.  This produces a yearly benefit potential of $1.42 million per year.  This benefit 
is phased-in over years 2 through 10 of this analysis.

13.0  Results 
 
For the DOT PIH tank car proposal 30-year period analyzed, the estimated quantified costs total 
$1.566 billion with a PV, (7%) of approximately $827 million.   The benefits for this car would 
potentially total $1.605 billion with a PV,(7%) of $744 million.

For the AAR Interchange Standard (Trinity-like tank car) alternative the 30-year period 
analyzed, the estimated quantified costs total $1.049 billion with a PV (7%) of approximately 
$477 million.  The benefits for the base case would potentially total $276 million with a PV (7 
%) of $79 million. 
 
14.0  Analysis 
 
The results of this analysis indicate that for the 30-year period analyzed a combination of 
accident related and business benefits resulting from implementation of DOT’s proposed rule 
would exceed and therefore justify the costs associated with such implementation.  This is true 
based on calculations performed using discount rates of 7% and a 3%.   
 
DOT also analyzed the costs and benefits associated with a “status quo” regulatory alternative in 
which the AAR Interchange Standard mandating Trinity-like tank cars would be enforced.  This 
analysis indicates that implementation of this alternative would also result in higher benefits than 
costs.  However, given that implementation of this alternative standard would not result in 
avoidance of any of the ruptures that resulted in fatal PIH releases experienced in the past ten 
years, DOT believes that this alternative would not sufficiently address the market failure leading 
to this rulemaking.  Note that the AAR standard does not contain any operating restrictions. 
 
15.0  Uncertainty, Variability & Sensitivity Assessment 
 
The findings, results, and conclusions of this analysis could change if the assumptions or inputs 
were to change.  Therefore, the findings of this analysis are sensitive to its assumptions.  The 
cost estimates are largely driven by the number of new PIH tank cars produced and the estimated 
marginal cost increase for including the proposed features.  The potential benefit calculations are 
largely driven by the estimated savings from casualty severity mitigation.  Thus, the savings 
could vary based on the estimated value of a life saved.  Economic analyses such as this one are 
also sensitive to variables such as the interest rate that is used for the discount rate.  The 
sensitivity to these key variables was demonstrated by Hahn (2004).[1]   
 
In accordance with guidance from DOT, this analysis is based on a value of a statistical life 
(VSL) of $5.8 million.117  OMB Circular A-4 states that the majority of studies of VSL range 
from roughly $1 million to $10 million.  Use of a higher or lower VSL could significantly affect 
potential safety benefits and could ultimately the relative standing of costs to benefits for this 
rulemaking.  In recognition of this potential impact and the imprecision of assumptions regarding 
the value of a life, DOT also analyzed the sensitivity of its findings by evaluating key safety 
benefits using VSLs of $3.2 million, and $8.4 million.  
 
DOT also performed a sensitivity analysis to address the uncertainty regarding the consequences 
from release of PIH materials resulting from train accidents.  This sensitivity analysis is based on 
the assumption that the consequences of projected incidents will be of the same average severity 
as those in the past ten years.  It does not recognize how fortunate the circumstances surrounding

recent past incidents have been.  However, given the rarity of the occurrence of rail accidents 
resulting in the release of PIH materials from tank cars, and the high variability in the 
circumstances and consequences of such events, DOT believes this sensitivity analysis is useful.

performed.

DOT believes that the range of benefit levels presented in this table show that, despite the 
uncertainty surrounding the assumptions related to release consequences, substantial benefits 
would be realized through implementation of the proposed rule. 
 
15.1     Other DOT Initiatives  
 
In the area of human factors, FRA has issued a proposed rule which seeks to ensure better 
management of railroad programs of operational tests and inspections and to establish greater 
accountability for compliance with operating rules involved in approximately half of the human 
factors train accidents.  FRA has completed consultations within the RSAC regarding resolution 
of public comments on the proposed rule, and a final rule should be issued this year.   
 
Recognizing that the best answer to human factor risks is sometimes technology that can 
“backstop” the person in cases where errors have high consequences, FRA continues to work 
actively to promote Positive Train Control (PTC) systems and similar technology.  FRA expects 
that implementation of PTC systems and similar technology will, over time, reduce the risk of 
collisions. 
 
In the field of track safety, FRA is taking concrete steps in both research and enforcement.  FRA 
research has provided a new tool to detect cracks in joint bars.  This optical recognition 
technology can capture and analyze images for very small cracks while mounted on a hi-rail 
truck or other on-track vehicle.  The system is already in initial use by two major railroads. 
Recently FRA also promulgated a final rule on Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) “joint bars” that 
requires track owners to develop and implement procedures for detailed inspections of rail joints 
in CWR.  It identified specific items, such as things that track inspectors should look for like rail 
end batter that track owners must address in their plans.     
 
However, railroad operations continue to present significant safety risks and are likely to do so 
for the foreseeable future.  Increased rail traffic is putting significant pressure on the existing 
infrastructure, and the increasing density of operations continues to drive up the “chances” for 
minor events to become disasters.  Accordingly, strategies that emphasize mitigation of accident 
consequences through improved crashworthiness will be required to address the needs identified 
in this analysis. 

87 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 
While DOT is working on other initiatives that should yield a reduction in train accidents that 
could affect the transportation of hazardous materials, those initiatives are aimed at accident 
avoidance in general.  Such initiatives alone would only partially address the risk posed by the 
transportation of PIH materials by railroad tank car.  In addition, to rely on such initiatives to 
achieve the same level of safety improvement that this rule would yield, would require far larger 
expenditures than currently planned.  For instance, future collisions on Class I main lines would 
be addressed by PTC, however, it would cost approximately $3 billion to implement PTC on 
those lines and 10% of that amount for annual maintenance. Since a significant portion of PIH 
materials do not move on Class I main lines, additional investment would be required.  Given the 
significantly lower levels of traffic along some of the lines that PIH is transported on, such 
investment would not be justified there for the foreseeable future.  Further, many PIH releases 
involve derailments, and derailments with secondary collisions, caused by factors not addressed 
by PTC.  DOT believes there is no more cost effective method to sufficiently address all PIH 
movements by rail than that proposed in this rule. 
 
15.2     Potential Changes in the Railroad Service Environment 
 
The Department recognizes that other changes occurring in the railroad service environment over 
the period of this analysis may influence the potential for train accidents and their likely 
severity.  Although FRA has identified many factors that could positively or negatively influence 
safety performance relevant to tank car catastrophic releases over the next three decades, the 
Department does not believe that firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the net effects of 
these factors. 
 
Factors that will drive reductions in risk include: 

  Development and deployment of PTC systems, which should be extensively deployed at 

least on the Class I railroads, by approximately 2020.  

  Better prevention and management of fatigue among railroad operating employees 

through voluntary efforts, and perhaps, statutory changes presently under examination in 
Congress.  

  Continued progress in the development and deployment of wayside detection systems 

that can identify developing problems with railroad wheels, bearings, brakes, axles, and 
other car components.  

  Reduced derailments from train handling and over-speed conditions if the industry 

embraces electronically-controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes.  

 
Factors that may drive increases in risk include: 

 

 

Increased density of operations (which, as to a single PIH shipment, would create 
additional exposure to events such as secondary collisions in multiple-track territory).  
Increased average train speeds made possible by PTC and ECP brakes, raising the 
potential for breaching less crashworthy tank cars when a train accident occurs.  
  Growing exposure to collisions with heavy motor vehicles at highway-rail grade 

crossings, with subsequent derailment.  

  Deteriorating rail infrastructure, particularly fatigued rail and failing bridges, should the 

industry fail to increase its rate of investment in system replacement from current levels.

  Any increase in intentional acts directed against train movements or rail infrastructure.  

 
Although the major factors likely to influence the level of risk in the service environment over 
the next three decades can be identified in broad outline, as stated above, the extent to which any 
single element will be influential is difficult to predict with precision, and in the case of several 
factors intervening decisions by the industry will be required to determine if they will drive 
reductions or increases in risk.  Accordingly, the Department’s best judgment is that 
requirements for tank car crashworthiness should be proposed and that, if adopted, projected 
benefits are likely to be realized. 
 
16.0  Conclusion 
 
This analysis includes qualitative discussions and quantitative measurements of costs and 
benefits of the proposed rule.  The costs that would be imposed are primarily labor and material 
costs associated with incorporating the new crashworthiness features found in the proposed rule, 
and costs related to the designing and re-engineering required to implement the proposed safety 
enhancements.  In addition, there would be costs associated with transferring current PIH tank 
cars to other commodity services, and costs associated with the proposed operating restrictions.  
Finally, there would be costs for the increased traffic or volume of tank cars on rail due to the 
increased weight, and thus reduced capacity, of the cars.  A majority of the savings will accrue 
from implementation of the requirements that decrease the probability of death, and mitigation of 
potential injuries from accidents and derailments of trains that involve tank cars loaded with PIH 
materials.  In addition, savings would accrue from a decrease in railroad and other property 
damages, environmental remediation, track closures, road closures, and evacuations. 
 
The true regulatory impact from this rulemaking would be the DOT proposal minus the AAR 
proposal.  The the true regulatory cost for the DOT proposed alternative is $351 million PV (7%) 
and with a PV (3%) of $432 million.  The true benefits for the DOT proposal would be $666 
million PV (7%) and with a PV (3%) of $1.088 billion.   
 
The results of this analysis are sensitive to the various inputs and assumptions used to estimate 
costs and benefits.  For instance, the results could change if the total incremental costs for 
incorporating the new crashworthiness features were significantly different.  Given that this 
proposed rule contains performance standards and not prescriptive design standards, it is possible 
that tank car manufacturers may be able to develop compliant designs that are less expensive.  
Another potential source of uncertainty affecting the level of compliance costs is future demand 
level for PIH materials.  The degree and direction of any such fluctuation(s) over the 30-year 
period of this analysis is not predictable with any reasonable degree of confidence.   
 
In addition, the value of a statistical life that is used for estimating safety benefits can also affect 
the overall cost benefit comparison and thus the outcome of this analysis.  This analysis shows 
the differences from using different values for a Value of a Statistical Life (VSL).  Specifically, 
the analysis uses a value of $5.8 million.  It also shows what the benefit totals would be if the 
value was $2.6 million less, i.e., $3.2 million; and $2.6 million more, i.e., $8.4 million.

Other sources of uncertainty can be more readily analyzed.  DOT conducted sensitivity analyses 
varying assumptions related to the value of a statistical life as well as accident severity 
projections used to estimate the benefits of the proposed rule.  The first addresses the uncertainty 
regarding the consequences from release of PIH materials resulting from train accidents.  This 
analysis is based on the assumption that the consequences of projected incidents will be of the 
same average severity as those in the past ten years.  It does not recognize how fortunate the 
circumstances surrounding recent past incidents have been.  Given the rarity of the occurrence of 
rail accidents resulting in the release of PIH materials from tank cars, and the high variability in 
the circumstances and consequences of such events, this sensitivity analysis is useful.  The 30-
year benefit estimates associated with this scenario are $586,624,122 (PV, 7%) 
and $926,731,141 (PV, 3%).  The second and third sensitivity analyses address the imprecision 
of assumptions regarding the value of a life, which affect the level of safety benefits (i.e., 
casualty mitigation) that would result from promulgation of the proposed rule.  Casualty 
mitigation benefits associated with this rulemaking were estimated using a value of statistical life 
of $5.8 million.  Thirty-year benefit estimates associated with values of a statistical life of $3.2 
million and $8.4 million would be $562,100,371 (PV, 7%, VSL: $3.2M), $857,000,000 (PV, 7%, 
VSL: $8.4M).   
 
 
This analysis provides estimates of what the potential savings could be from accidents or 
derailments in which PIH tank cars do not lose their integrity as a result of implementing the 
proposed provisions.  Such benefits include lives saved, injuries averted, evacuations avoided, 
environmental cleanup averted, track and road closures avoided, and property and business 
damages avoided.  Other significant societal benefits are discussed, but their value is translated 
into monetary terms only to the extent it was possible to do so with the information available.  
This analysis also includes benefits associated with the fact that the proposed operating 
restrictions would produce absolute economic (non-accident related) benefits in terms of fuel 
savings.  Finally, this analysis estimates that tank cars built to the proposed standards will have a 
significantly higher residual value at the end of the period analyzed (more crashworthy cars will 
likely not be scrapped at the same rate as current cars).   
 
It is important to note, as several commenters at the public meetings relating to this rule have 
stated, that the tank car is only one component of the rail transportation system, and no single 
component of the system can provide the entire means to improving tank car safety.  
 
Hazardous materials are essential to the economy of the United States and the well being of its 
people.  These materials are used in water purification, farming, manufacturing, and other 
industrial applications.  The need for hazardous materials to support essential services means 
transportation of hazardous materials is unavoidable and rail transportation of hazardous 
materials in the United States is generally recognized to be safe method of moving large 
quantities of hazardous materials over long distances.   
 
PHMSA’s proposed rule would require enhanced tank car performance standards for head and 
shell impacts; operational speed restrictions for all tank cars that transport PIH materials; more 
stringent operational restrictions for trains hauling tank cars not meeting the enhanced 
performance standards proposed, but transporting PIH materials and operating in non-signaled 
territory; and an allowance to increase the gross weight of tank cars that meet the enhanced tank-

90 

PIH Tank Car Performance Standards NPRM   -     RIA 
 

 

head and shell standards.  The proposed rule would require tank cars that transport PIH materials 
be designed and manufactured with tank-head puncture resistance systems capable of preventing 
puncture at 30 mph and shell puncture-resistance systems capable of withstanding the proposed 
performance tests without loss of lading at a minimum 25 mph impact by a ram car weighing 
286,000 pounds.  The relevant research undertaken for this rule indicates that in general, the 
secondary car-to-car impact speed is approximately one-half of initial train speed.  Thus, 
requiring tank cars to withstand head and shell impacts of at least 25 mph and limiting the speed 
of those tank cars to 50 mph ensures that, in most instances, a tank car would not be breached if 
involved in a derailment or other similar type of accident.  To address higher forces associated 
with direct impacts in train-to-train collisions, the tank-head would be required to survive an 
impact at 30 mph.   
 
During the public meetings, several commenters noted that the tank car is only one component of 
the rail transportation system and no single component of the system can provide the entire 
means to improving tank car safety.  PHMSA and FRA are taking a variety of actions to reduce 
the risk of derailments and collisions and to promote prompt and effective responses that reduce 
the loss of life and property.  Nevertheless, an identified gap must be closed if future catastrophic 
events are to be prevented.    
 
Finally, it should be noted that quantitative methodologies such as this benefit-cost analysis are a 
useful way of organizing and comparing the favorable and unfavorable effects of proposed 
regulations such as this one.  A benefit-cost analysis does not provide the policy answer, but 
rather defines and displays a useful framework for debate and review.118  Hence, this impact 
analysis is only one tool which can be utilized when considering such a proposal.

Appendix B 
Abbreviated Injury Scale 
 
 
_____________________________________________________________________________   
 
The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was "[f]irst published in 1971 under the joint sponsorship of 
the American Medical Association; the Society of Automotive Engineers; and the Association 
for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine (formerly the American Association for 
Automotive Medicine)."  The AIS was originally developed for impact injury assessment.  The 
evolution of trauma care systems and trauma registries in the 1980s fostered a need for 
expanding the AIS to facilitate the coding of penetration trauma.  Through revisions, the scope of 
injuries has been broadened.  The AIS is based on anatomical injury.  There is only one AIS 
score for each injury for any one person.  The AIS scores injuries and not the consequences of 
the injuries.  This principle was employed so that the AIS can be used as a measure of the 
severity of the injury itself and not a measurement of impairments or disabilities that result from 
the injury.  AIS is not simply a ranking of expected mortality from an injury.  Were this the case, 
there would be no way to distinguish the majority of minor and moderate injuries since they pose 
little or no threat to life.1  The purpose behind the AIS is to provide a "consistent scale for 
collecting, categorizing, and analyzing injury-severity data."2  The AIS is based on the "threat-to-
life" posed by injuries and not on cost-based criteria which does not always correlate well to the 
cost of an individual accident.3  Although empirical data show that the AIS correlates well with 
the probability of death at the serious and life-threatening levels (AIS > 3), other factors are also 
considered in AIS severity.  Also death rates vary significantly within each AIS value for the 
most severe injury depending upon the AIS value for the second most severe injury.4  The AIS is 
a system that was designed as a predictor of mortality, and not as a measure of disability.5  The 
AIS is a consensus-derived, anatomically-based system that classifies individual injuries by body 
region on a 6-point ordinal severity scale ranging from AIS 1 (minor) to AIS 6 (currently 
untreatable).  The AIS does not assess the combined effect of patients with multiple injuries.  
 
The threat-to-life approach in the AIS is analogous to the "willingness-to-pay" approach to 
valuing human life.  "The willingness-to-pay method values human life according to the amount 
individuals are willing to pay for a change that reduces the probability of death.  This approach 
assumes an individual perspective and incorporates all aspects of well-being, including labor and 
non-labor income, and the value of leisure, pain and suffering."6  The savings society gains

through injury prevention and control, “includes increased tax revenues; reduced transfer 
payments in Medicare, food stamps, unemployment compensation, etc.; reduced private 
insurance payments; and reduced costs for administering transfer payment and insurance 
programs.”  Thus, the AIS assesses how much individuals are willing to spend on injury risk 
reduction and the potential savings to society from this reduction.7  Inclusive in the individual 
willingness to pay are the values for “lost quality of life,” pain and suffering, lost wages and 
fringe benefits, and loss household production.8 
 
The severity of an “injury” can range from a mere scratch to irreparable damage.  Quite 
obviously people would attach a greater value to avoiding more severe injuries.  The range of 
injuries must be divided into a manageable number of levels to estimate specific values for injury 
prevention.  The AIS categorizes injuries into levels ranging from AIS 1 -- minor, to AIS 5 -- 
critical.  AIS 6 is equivalent to a fatality.  The research techniques on willingness to pay to avoid 
injury relies on a panel of experienced physicians to relate injuries in each AIS level to the loss 
of quality and quantity of life involved.  Avoiding a minor injury involving only a few days of 
discomfort equates to only a tiny fraction of a value for saving a life, while preventing a severe 
injury with permanent disability could be deemed nearly equivalent to preventing a death. 
 

  An AIS 1 injury would be one in which the injury is simple, and may not require 

professional medical treatment.  Recovery is usually rapid and complete. 

 

 

 

 

 

  An AIS 2 injury would be one in which the injury almost always requires treatment, but 

is not ordinarily life-threatening or permanently disabling.  Examples include finger or 
toe crush/amputation. 

  An AIS 3 injury would be one in which the injury has the potential for major 

hospitialization and long-term disability, but is not generally life-threatening.  Examples 
include hand, foot or arm crush/amputation. 

  An AIS 4 injury would be one in which the injury is often permanently disabling, but 

survival is probable. 

  An AIS 5 injury would be one that usually requires intensive medical care.  Survival is 

uncertain.

The FRA uses $5.8 Million for the value of life per the policy of the U. S. Department of 
Transportation.  Thus, the values of AIS 1, ..., AIS 5 can be determined by multiplying the 
"value of a life" (i.e. $5.8 Million) times the "fraction of life value."  The monetary value of AIS 
1 through 5, are $11,600, $89,900, $333,500, $1,087,500; and $ 4,422,500; respectively.  
 
The following are complications in dealing with injuries that should be recognized: 
 
o 

Different accident types in different modes tend to have different patterns of associated 
injuries.  In most cases the less severe injury levels tend to be more numerous, but the 
pattern may vary. 

 
o 

 
o 

 
 
 

 

Different safety measures may prevent different patterns of injuries.  Accident prevention 
measures will, of course, prevent injuries in the pattern associated with the type of 
accident. 

Injury data are often spotty and rarely reported in AIS levels.  Injuries are often reported 
as whether there was time lost, whether the victims were carried from the scene, whether 
they required subsequent hospitalization, days absent, restricted days, etc.  Minor injuries 
may not be reported at all.
