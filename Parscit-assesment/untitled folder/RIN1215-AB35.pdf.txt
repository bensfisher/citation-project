Wage and Hour Division 

29 CFR Part 825 
RIN 1215–AB35 

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 
1993 
AGENCY: Employment Standards 
Administration, Wage and Hour 
Division, Department of Labor. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking; 
request for comments. 
SUMMARY: The Department of Labor’s 
Employment Standards Administration/ 
Wage and Hour Division proposes to 
revise certain regulations implementing 
the Family and Medical Leave Act of 
1993 (‘‘FMLA’’), the law that provides 
eligible workers with important rights to 
job protection for absences due to the 
birth or adoption of a child or for a 
serious health condition of the worker 
or a qualifying family member. The 
proposed changes are based on the 
Department’s experience of nearly 
fifteen years administering the law, two 
previous Department of Labor studies of 
the FMLA in 1996 and 2001, several 
U.S. Supreme Court and lower court 
rulings, and the public comments 
received in response to a Request for 
Information (‘‘RFI’’) published in the 
Federal Register in December 2006 
requesting information about 
experiences with the FMLA and 
comments on the effectiveness of these 
regulations. 

The Department is also seeking public 

comment on issues to be addressed in 
final regulations regarding military 
family leave. Section 585(a) of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
FY 2008 amends the FMLA to provide 
leave to eligible employees of covered 
employers to care for injured 
servicemembers and because of any 
qualifying exigency arising out of the 
fact that a covered family member is on 
active duty or has been notified of an 
impending call to active duty status in 
support of a contingency operation 
(collectively referred to herein as 
military family leave). The provisions of 
this amendment providing FMLA leave 
to care for a covered servicemember 
became effective on January 28, 2008, 
when the law was enacted. The 
provisions of this amendment providing 
for FMLA leave due to a qualifying 
exigency arising out of a covered family 
member’s active duty (or call to active 
duty) status are not effective until the 
Secretary of Labor issues regulations

defining ‘‘qualifying exigencies.’’

II. Background 
A. What the Law Provides 

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 
1993, Public Law 103–3, 107 Stat. 6 (29 
U.S.C. 2601 et. seq.) (‘‘FMLA’’ or ‘‘Act’’) 
was enacted on February 5, 1993, and 
became effective for most covered 
employers on August 5, 1993. The 
FMLA entitles eligible employees of 
covered employers to take up to a total 
of twelve weeks of unpaid leave during 
a twelve month period for the birth of 
a child; for the placement of a child for 
adoption or foster care; to care for a 
newborn or newly-placed child; to care 
for a spouse, parent, son or daughter 
with a serious health condition; or when 
the employee is unable to work due to 
the employee’s own serious health

condition. See 29 U.S.C. 2612. The 
twelve weeks of leave may be taken in 
a block, or, under certain circumstances, 
intermittently or on a reduced leave 
schedule. Id. 

Employers covered by the law must 

maintain for the employee any 
preexisting group health coverage 
during the leave period under the same 
conditions coverage would have been 
provided if the employee had not taken 
leave and, once the leave period has 
concluded, reinstate the employee to the 
same or an equivalent job with 
equivalent employment benefits, pay, 
and other terms and conditions of 
employment. See 29 U.S.C. 2614. 

If an employee believes that his or her 

FMLA rights have been violated, the 
employee may file a complaint with the 
Department of Labor (‘‘Department’’ or 
‘‘DOL’’) or file a private lawsuit in 
Federal or State court. If the employer 
has violated an employee’s FMLA 
rights, the employee is entitled to 
reimbursement for any monetary loss 
incurred, equitable relief as appropriate, 
interest, attorneys’ fees, expert witness 
fees, and court costs. Liquidated 
damages also may be awarded. See, 29 
U.S.C. 2617. 

Title I of the FMLA applies to private 

sector employers of fifty or more 
employees, public agencies and certain 
Federal employers and entities, such as 
the U.S. Postal Service and Postal Rate 
Commission. Title II applies to civil 
service employees covered by the 
annual and sick leave system 
established under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 63, 
plus certain employees covered by other 
Federal leave systems. Title III 
established a temporary Commission on 
Leave to conduct a study and report on 
existing and proposed policies on leave 
and the costs, benefits, and impact on 
productivity of such policies. Title IV 
contains miscellaneous provisions, 
including rules governing the effect of 
the FMLA on more generous leave 
policies, other laws, and existing 
employment benefits. Title V originally 
extended leave provisions to certain 
employees of the U.S. Senate and House 
of Representatives, but such coverage 
was repealed and replaced by the 
Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995, 2 U.S.C. 1301. 
B. Who the Law Covers 

The FMLA generally covers 

employers with 50 or more employees, 
and employees must have worked for 
the employer for 12 months and for 
1,250 hours of service during the 
previous year to be eligible for FMLA 
leave. Based on 2005 data, the latest 
year for which data are available, the 
Department estimates that:

• There were an estimated 95.8 
million workers in establishments 
covered by the FMLA regulations, 
• There were approximately 77.1 

million workers in covered 
establishments who met the FMLA’s 
requirements for eligibility, and 
• About 7.0 million covered and 
eligible workers took FMLA leave in 
2005. 
• About 1.7 million covered and 
eligible employees who took FMLA 
leave took at least some of it 
intermittently—and may have taken that 
intermittent leave multiple times over 
the course of the year. 
C. Implementing Regulations 

The FMLA required the Department 
to issue regulations to implement Title 
I and Title IV of the FMLA within 120 
days of enactment, or by June 5, 1993, 
with an effective date of August 5, 1993. 
Given this short implementation period, 
the Department published a notice of 
proposed rulemaking in the Federal 
Register on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 
13394), inviting comments until March 
31, 1993, on a variety of questions and 
issues. The Department received a total 
of 393 comments at that time from a 
wide variety of stakeholders, including 
employers, trade and professional 
associations, advocacy organizations, 
labor unions, State and local 
governments, law firms, employee 
benefit firms, academic institutions, 
financial institutions, medical 
institutions, Members of Congress, and 
others. 

After considering these comments, the 
Department issued an interim final rule 
on June 4, 1993 (58 FR 31794) that 
became effective on August 5, 1993. The 
Department also invited further public 
comment on the interim regulations 
through September 3, 1993, later 
extended to December 3, 1993 (58 FR 
45433). During this comment period, the 
Department received more than 900 
substantive and editorial comments on 
the interim regulations, from a wide 
variety of stakeholders. 

Based on this second round of public 

comments, the Department published 
final regulations to implement the 
FMLA on January 6, 1995 (60 FR 2180). 
The regulations were amended on 
February 3, 1995 (60 FR 6658) and on 
March 30, 1995 (60 FR 16382) to make 
minor technical corrections. The final 
regulations went into effect on April 6, 
1995. 
D. Legal Challenges 
The Ragsdale Decision 

Since the enactment of the FMLA, 

hundreds of reported Federal cases have 

addressed the Act and/or implementing 
regulations. The most significant court 
decision on the validity of the 
regulations is that of the United States 
Supreme Court in Ragsdale v. Wolverine 
World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81 (2002). In 
its first case involving the FMLA, the 
Court ruled in March 2002 that the 
penalty provision in 29 CFR 825.700(a), 
which states ‘‘[i]f an employee takes 
* * * leave and the employer does not 
designate the leave as FMLA leave, the 
leave taken does not count against an 
employee’s FMLA entitlement[,]’’ was 
invalid because in some circumstances 
it required employers to provide leave 
to employees beyond the 12-week 
statutory entitlement. ‘‘The FMLA 
guaranteed [Plaintiff] 12-not 42-weeks of 
leave[.]’’ Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 96. While 
the Supreme Court did not invalidate 
the notice and designation provisions in 
the regulations, it made clear that any 
categorical penalty for a violation of 
such requirements set forth in the 
regulations would exceed the 
Department’s statutory authority. Id. at 
91–96. 
Other Challenges to ‘‘Categorical 
Penalty’’ Provisions 

As the Department explained in its 

December 2006 RFI 1 and the 
subsequent 2007 Report on the RFI 
comments,2 Ragsdale is not the only 
court decision addressing penalty 
provisions contained in the regulations. 
Another provision of the regulations, 
§ 825.110(d), requires an employer to 
notify an employee prior to the 
employee commencing leave as to 
whether or not the employee is eligible 
for FMLA leave. If the employer fails to 
provide the employee with such 
information or the information is not 
accurate, the regulation bars the 
employer from challenging eligibility at 
a later date, even if the employee is not 
eligible for FMLA leave according to the 
statutory requirements. The majority of 
courts addressing this notice provision 
have found it to be invalid, even prior 
to the Ragsdale decision. See, e.g., 
Woodford v. Cmty. Action of Greene 
County, Inc., 268 F.3d 51, 57 (2d Cir. 
2001) (‘‘The regulation exceeds agency 
rulemaking powers by making eligible 
under the FMLA employees who do not 
meet the statute’s clear eligibility 
requirements.’’); Brungart v. BellSouth 
Telecomm., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 796–97 
(11th Cir. 2000) (‘‘There is no ambiguity 
in the statute concerning eligibility for 
family medical leave, no gap to be

filled.’’); Dormeyer v. Comerica Bank- 
Illinois, 223 F.3d 579, 582 (7th Cir. 
2000) (the regulation tries ‘‘to change 
the Act’’ because it makes eligible 
employees who, under the language of 
the statute, are ineligible for family 
leave; ‘‘The statutory test is perfectly 
clear and covers the issue. The right of 
family leave is conferred only on 
employees who have worked at least 
1,250 hours in the previous 12 
months’’). 
Legal Challenges to the Definition of 
Serious Health Condition 

Other regulatory provisions have been 

challenged as well. In particular, 
challenges to the regulatory section 
defining the term ‘‘serious health 
condition’’ as a condition causing a 
period of incapacity of more than three 
consecutive calendar days and 
continuing treatment, 29 CFR 
825.114(a)(2)(i), has received significant 
attention. See, e.g., Miller v. AT&T 
Corp., 250 F.3d 820 (4th Cir. 2001); 
Thorson v. Gemini, Inc., 205 F.3d 370 
(8th Cir. 2000). 

As the Department explained in its 
December 2006 RFI 3 and subsequent 
Report on the RFI,4 the Department 
itself has struggled with this definition. 
After the Act’s passage, the Department 
promulgated § 825.114(c), which states 
that ‘‘[o]rdinarily, unless complications 
arise, the common cold, the flu, ear 
aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, 
headaches other than migraine, routine 
dental or orthodontia problems, 
periodontal disease, etc., are examples 
of conditions that do not meet the 
definition of a serious health condition 
and do not qualify for FMLA leave.’’ 
This regulatory language was intended 
to reflect the legislative history of the 
FMLA and expresses the Congressional 
intent that minor, short-term illnesses 
for which treatment and recovery are 
very brief would be covered by 
employers’ sick leave programs and not 
by the FMLA. See H.R. Rep. No. 103– 
8, at 40 (1993); S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 28– 
29 (1993). Consequently, in an early 
response about the proper handling of 
an employee’s request for leave due to 
the common cold, the Department 
responded by stating ‘‘[t]he fact that an 
employee is incapacitated for more than 
three days, has been treated by a health 
care provider on at least one occasion 
which has resulted in a regimen of 
continuing treatment prescribed by the 
health care provider does not convert 
minor illnesses such as the common 
cold into serious health conditions in 
the ordinary case (absent 

3See 71 FR at 69506. 
4See 72 FR at 35563. 

complications).’’ Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA–57 (Apr. 7, 1995). 
More than a year and a half later, 
however, the Department reversed its 
interpretation, stating that Wage and 
Hour Opinion Letter FMLA–57 
‘‘expresses an incorrect view, being 
inconsistent with the Department’s 
established interpretation of qualifying 
‘serious health conditions’ under the 
FMLA regulations.’’ Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA–86 (Dec. 12, 
1996). The Department further stated 
that such minor illnesses ordinarily 
would not be expected to last more than 
three days, but if they do meet the 
regulatory criteria for a serious health 
condition under § 825.114(a), they 
qualify for FMLA leave. The Department 
received significant commentary about 
its changing interpretations of the 
definition of serious health condition in 
response to its RFI. See Chapter III of 
the Department’s 2007 Report on the 
RFI comments (72 FR at 35563). 
Other Legal Challenges 

Many other legal issues have arisen 
over the nearly thirteen years the final 
regulations have been in effect. For 
example, litigation has ensued under 
§§ 825.302–.303 as to what constitutes 
sufficient employee notice to trigger an 
employer’s obligations under the FMLA. 
See, e.g., Sarnowski v. Air Brook 
Limousine, Inc.,—F.3d ,—2007 WL 
4323259 (3rd Cir. 2007) (employee with 
chronic heart problems who informed 
employer of need for continuing 
medical monitoring and possible 
surgery provided sufficient notice); 
Spangler v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of 
Des Moines, 278 F.3d 847 (8th Cir. 2002) 
(employee who had made employer 
aware that she had problems with 
depression gave sufficient notice when 
she called in and indicated she was out 
because of ‘‘depression again’’). 

Among other cases, the Tenth Circuit 

Court of Appeals considered the 
definition of ‘‘worksite’’ for determining 
whether an employee seeking FMLA 
leave was employed at a worksite where 
50 or more employees were employed 
by the employer within 75 miles. 
Section 825.111(a)(3) states that when 
an employee is jointly employed by two 
or more employers, the employee’s 
worksite is the primary employer’s 
office from which the employee has 
been assigned or to which the employee 
reports. In Harbert v. Healthcare 
Services Group, Inc., 391 F.3d 1140 
(10th Cir. 2004), the Court of Appeals 
invalidated § 825.111(a)(3), insofar as it 
is applied to the situation of an 
employee with a long-term fixed 
worksite at a facility of the secondary 
employer. The First Circuit Court of

Appeals looked at a different eligibility 
criterion, the requirement that the 
employee has been employed by the 
employer for at least 12 months, and 
addressed whether an employee who 
had a break in service may count 
previous periods of employment with 
the same employer toward satisfying the 
12-month employment requirement (29 
U.S.C. 2611(2)(A)(i); 29 CFR 
825.110(a)(1) and (b)). See Rucker v. Lee 
Holding Co., 471 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2006) 
(a complete break in service of a period 
of five years does not prevent the 
employee from counting previous 
employment to meet the 12-month 
employment requirement). Another 
regulation that has been the subject of 
litigation is § 825.220(d), which in part 
discusses the impact of a light duty 
work assignment on an employee’s 
FMLA rights. Further, most recently, the 
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 
Taylor v. Progress Energy, 493 F.3d 454 
(4th Cir. 2007), petition for cert. filed, 76 
U.S.L.W. 3226 (U.S. Oct. 22, 2007) (No. 
07–539), that other language in 
§ 825.220(d) prevents an employee and 
employer from independently settling 
past claims for FMLA violations without 
the approval of the Department or a 
court. 
E. Prior Studies and Reports 

Title III of the FMLA established a 
temporary Commission on Leave to 
conduct a study and report on existing 
and proposed policies on leave and the 
costs, benefits, and impact on 
productivity of such policies. The 
Commission surveyed workers and 
employers in 1995 and issued a report 
published by the Department in 1996, 
‘‘A Workable Balance: Report to 
Congress on Family and Medical Leave 
Policies.’’ 5 In 1999, the Department 
contracted with Westat, Inc.,6 to update 
the employee and establishment surveys 
conducted in 1995. The Department 
published that report, ‘‘Balancing the 
Needs of Families and Employers: 
Family and Medical Leave Surveys, 
2000 Update’’ in January 2001.7 
F. Request for Information 

On December 1, 2006, the Department 

published a Request for Information 
(RFI) in the Federal Register (71 FR 
69504). 

The RFI asked the public to comment 

on its experiences with, and

observations of, the Department’s 
administration of the law and the 
effectiveness of the FMLA regulations. 
The RFI’s questions and subject areas 
were derived from a series of 
stakeholder meetings the Department 
conducted in 2002–2003, a number of 
rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court and 
other Federal courts as discussed above, 
the Department’s own experience 
administering the law, information from 
Congressional hearings, and public 
comments filed with the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) as 
described by OMB in three annual 
reports to Congress on the FMLA’s costs 
and benefits.8 More than 15,000 
comments were received from workers, 
family members, employers, academics, 
and other interested parties.9 This input 
ranged from personal accounts, legal 
reviews, industry and academic studies, 
and surveys to recommendations for 
regulatory and statutory changes to 
address particular areas of concern. The 
Department published its Report on the 
comments received in response to the 
Department’s RFI in June 2007 (see 72 
FR 35550 (June 28, 2007)). 
G. Stakeholder Meeting 

The Department also conducted a 

stakeholder meeting regarding the 
medical certification process on 
September 6, 2007. This meeting 
included representatives from employee 
organizations, employer organizations, 
and the health care provider 
community. 
H. Other Statutory and Regulatory 
Developments 

As discussed in the RFI and the 

Report on the RFI, in addition to 
developments in the courts, several 
important legislative and regulatory 
developments have occurred that either 
directly or indirectly impact the FMLA 
regulations. In 1996, Congress enacted 
the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA), Public Law 
104–191, which addresses in part the 
privacy of individually identifiable 
health information. On December 28, 
2000, and as amended on August 14, 
2002, the Department of Health and

Human Services issued regulations that 
provide standards for the privacy of 
individually identifiable health 
information, codified at 45 CFR Parts 
160 and 164 (‘‘HIPAA Privacy Rule’’). 
These standards apply to ‘‘covered 
entities,’’ defined as a health plan, a 
health care clearinghouse, or a health 
care provider who transmits any health 
information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction as defined 
in the privacy regulations.10 

The HIPAA Privacy Rule has had an 

impact on the FMLA’s medical 
certification process in a number of 
ways. For example, the FMLA provides 
employers with the right to obtain 
medical information to determine that a 
requested leave qualifies as FMLA 
leave, and the employee is required to 
assure that this information, if 
requested, is provided to the employer 
to be entitled to FMLA leave for a 
serious health condition. If an employee 
does not do this, the absence does not 
qualify for FMLA leave.11 While these 
rules are fairly straightforward, recent 
enforcement experience reveals that 
there is confusion with regard to the 
interaction of the HIPAA Privacy Rule 
and FMLA. For example, some 
employees incorrectly believe that the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule prevents employers 
from requiring FMLA certification. See 
discussion of §§ 825.306–.308 for 
further discussion of the impact of the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule on the medical 
certification process. 

Similarly, since the final FMLA 

regulations were implemented in 1995, 
the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC), the agency 
responsible for enforcing the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA), has issued 
guidance with regard to the privacy of 
employee medical information. See, e.g., 
Enforcement Guidance: Disability- 
Related Inquiries and Medical 
Examinations of Employees Under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
(EEOC 2000). The FMLA looks to the 
ADA for guidance on privacy of 
employee medical information.12 
III. Proposed Changes to the FMLA 
Regulations 

The following is a section-by-section 

discussion of the proposed revisions. 
Where a change is proposed to a 
regulatory section, that section is 
discussed below. However, even if a 
section is not discussed, there may be 
minor editorial changes or corrections 
that did not warrant discussion. The 

10See 45 CFR 160.102(a) and 45 CFR 160.03.

2–A (Sept. 14, 2005). 

12See 29 CFR 825.500(g). 

titles to each section of the existing 
regulations are in the form of a question. 
The proposal would reword each 
question into the more common format 
of a descriptive title and the Department 
invites comments on whether this 
change is helpful. In addition, several 
sections have been restructured and 
reorganized to improve the accessibility 
of the information (e.g., guidance on 
leave for pregnancy and birth of a child 
is addressed in one consolidated 
section; an employer’s notice 
obligations are combined in one 
section). 
Section 825.102 (Effective date of the 
Act) 

The proposal deletes this section, 

which discussed when the Act became 
effective, because it is no longer needed. 
The section number itself is reserved to 
avoid extensive renumbering of other 
sections in the regulations. 
Section 825.103 (How the Act affects 
leave in progress on, or taken before, the 
effective date of the Act) 

The proposal deletes and reserves this 

section, which discussed how the Act 
affected leave in progress on, or taken 
before, the Act’s effective date, because 
it is no longer needed. 
Section 825.106 (Joint employer 
coverage) 

Sections 825.106 and 825.111(a)(3) of 

the existing regulations govern 
employer coverage and employee 
eligibility in the case of joint 
employment and set forth the 
responsibilities of the primary and 
secondary employers. Under 
§ 825.106(d), employees jointly 
employed by two employers must be 
counted by both employers in 
determining employer coverage and 
employee eligibility. Thus, for example, 
an employer who jointly employs 15 
workers from a leasing or temporary 
help agency and 40 permanent workers 
is covered by the FMLA. Likewise, if an 
employer with 15 permanent workers 
jointly employs 40 workers from a 
leasing company that employer is also 
covered by the FMLA. 

Although job restoration is the 

primary responsibility of the primary 
employer, the secondary employer is 
responsible for accepting the employee 
returning from FMLA leave if the 
secondary employer continues to utilize 
an employee from the temporary or 
leasing agency and the agency chooses 
to place the employee with that 
secondary employer. The secondary 
employer is also responsible for 
compliance with the prohibited acts 
provisions with respect to its

temporary/leased employees, and thus 
may not interfere with an employee’s 
attempt to exercise rights under the Act, 
or discharge or discriminate against an 
employee for opposing a practice that is 
unlawful under FMLA. See the existing 
§ 825.106(e). 

In Wage and Hour Opinion Letter 

FMLA–111 (Sept. 11, 2000), the 
Department considered the application 
of the FMLA regulations’ ‘‘joint 
employment’’ test in current § 825.106 
to a ‘‘Professional Employer 
Organization’’ (PEO). The PEO in 
question had a contract with the client 
company under which it appeared to 
enter into an employer-employee 
relationship with the client’s employees 
(who were leased back to the client and 
continued to work at the client’s 
worksite pursuant to the terms of the 
contract). The PEO in this case assumed 
substantial employer rights, 
responsibilities and risks, including the 
responsibility for personnel 
management, health benefits, workers’ 
compensation claims, payroll, payroll 
tax compliance, and unemployment 
insurance claims. Moreover, the PEO in 
this case had the right to hire, fire, 
assign, and direct and control the 
employees. 

Based on the facts described in the 

incoming letter, the Opinion Letter 
concluded that the PEO was in a joint 
employment relationship with its client 
companies for these reasons: 

1. The PEO was a separately owned and 

distinct entity under contract with the client 
to lease employees for the purpose of 
handling ‘‘critical human resource 
responsibilities and employer risks for the 
client.’’ 

2. The PEO was acting directly in the 
interest of the client in assuming human 
resource responsibilities. 

3. The PEO appeared to also share control 
of the leased employees consistent with the 
client’s responsibility for its product or 
service. 

The Opinion Letter stated that ‘‘it 

would appear that’’ the PEO is the 
‘‘primary employer’’ for those 
employees ‘‘leased’’ under contract with 
the client. Thus, under existing 
§ 825.106, the PEO would be 
responsible for giving required FMLA 
notices to its employees, providing 
FMLA leave, maintaining group health 
insurance benefits during the leave, and 
restoring the employee to the same or 
equivalent job upon return from leave. 
The ‘‘secondary employer’’ (i.e., the 
client company) would be responsible 
for accepting the employee returning 
from FMLA leave if the PEO chose to 
place the employee with the client 
company. The Opinion Letter 
concluded that the client company, as

the ‘‘secondary employer,’’ whether a 
covered employer or not under the 
FMLA, was prohibited from interfering 
with a ‘‘leased’’ employee’s attempt to 
exercise rights under the Act, or 
discharging or discriminating against an 
employee for opposing a practice that is 
unlawful under the Act. 

While no specific questions 

concerning PEOs were contained in the 
RFI, the Department did seek 
information on ‘‘any issues that may 
arise when an employee is jointly 
employed by two or more employers’’ 
(71 FR at 69509). In response to the RFI, 
a number of stakeholders commented 
that it is not correct to consider PEOs 
(sometimes called ‘‘HR Outsourcing 
Vendors’’) to be joint employers with 
their client companies and explained 
the differences between a temporary 
staffing agency and a PEO. ‘‘A 
temporary staffing agency is a labor 
supplier. It supplies employees to a 
client while a PEO is a service provider 
providing services to existing employees 
of a company.’’ See comments by 
Jackson-Lewis. Unlike a temporary 
staffing agency, a PEO does not have the 
ability to place an employee returning 
from FMLA leave with a different client 
employer. Id. 

The AFL–CIO commented that PEOs 

engage in a practice known as 
‘‘payrolling,’’ in which the client 
employers transfer the payroll and 
related responsibilities for some or all of 
their employees to the PEO, and that 
typically, the PEO also makes payments 
on behalf of the client employer into 
State workers’ compensation and 
unemployment insurance funds, but the 
PEO does not provide placement 
services. In contrast with temporary 
staffing agencies, the AFL–CIO 
commented, PEOs do not match people 
to jobs. 

The law firm of Littler Mendelson 

advised that ‘‘Employee leasing 
arrangements’’—like those involving 
temporary services firms and other 
staffing companies—refer to 
arrangements in which the staffing firm 
places its own employees at a 
customer’s place of business to perform 
services for the recipient’s enterprise. 
The PEO, in contrast, assumes certain 
administrative functions for its clients 
such as payroll and benefits coverage 
and administration (including workers’ 
compensation insurance and health 
insurance). The PEO typically has no 
direct responsibility over the employees 
of its clients including ‘‘hiring, training, 
supervision, evaluation, discipline or 
discharge, among other critical 
employer functions.’’ 

The law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski 

commented that PEO responsibilities 

vary by organization and contract, but 
that most are not involved in the day- 
to-day operations of their client’s 
business and do not exercise the right to 
hire, fire, supervise or manage daily 
activities of employees. The firm urged 
the Department to clarify that opinion 
letter FMLA–111 (Sept. 11, 2000) is 
about an atypical PEO that actually 
exercised control over the client’s 
employees. 

The Department proposes to amend 

§ 825.106(b) to clarify that PEOs that 
contract with client employers merely to 
perform administrative functions, 
including payroll, benefits, regulatory 
paperwork, and updating employment 
policies, are not joint employers with 
their clients, provided they merely 
perform such administrative functions. 
On the other hand, if in a particular fact 
situation a PEO has the right to hire, 
fire, assign, or direct and control the 
employees, or benefits from the work 
that the employees perform, such a PEO 
would be a joint employer with the 
client company. 

Some of the comments concerning 
PEOs suggest confusion over how to 
count employees jointly employed for 
purposes of employer coverage (‘‘over 
50 workers’’) and employee eligibility 
(‘‘over 50 employees within 75 miles’’). 
Some of these comments suggest that all 
of the employees of both the primary 
and secondary employers (and even 
those of other secondary employers) 
must be combined and counted together 
for purposes of these two tests. 
However, under the existing 
§ 825.106(d) only those employees who 
are jointly employed by the primary and 
each of the secondary employers are 
included in the employee counts of both 
firms. The home office employees of the 
primary employer and the employees 
placed with other secondary employers 
are not included, for example, in the 
employee counts for each secondary 
employer. 

For the reasons discussed above, 

existing paragraph (b) of § 825.106 is 
proposed to be changed to paragraph 
(b)(1) and a new paragraph (b)(2) is 
proposed to be added to clarify how the 
joint employment rules apply to PEOs. 
Under the proposal, PEOs that contract 
with client employers merely to perform 
administrative functions—including 
payroll, benefits, regulatory paperwork, 
and updating employment policies—are 
not joint employers with their clients, 
provided: (1) They do not have the right 
to exercise control over the activities of 
the client’s employees, and do not have 
the right to hire, fire or supervise them, 
or determine their rates of pay, and (2) 
do not benefit from the work that the 
employees perform. On the other hand,

if in a particular fact situation a PEO has 
the right to hire, fire, assign, or direct 
and control the employees, or benefits 
from the work that the employees 
perform, such a PEO would be a joint 
employer with the client employer. The 
proposal also includes a cross-reference 
in paragraph (d) to proposed 
§ 825.111(a)(3), which, as discussed 
below, would change the determination 
of the ‘‘worksite’’ for purposes of 
employee eligibility with respect to 
employees who are placed by a primary 
employer at the worksite of a secondary 
employer for more than 12 months. 
Section 825.108 (Public agency 
coverage) 

This section addresses what 

constitutes a ‘‘public agency’’ for 
purposes of coverage under the Act. 
Under the current regulations, the 
dispositive test for determining whether 
a public agency is a separate and 
distinct entity (and therefore a separate 
employer for determining employee 
eligibility) or simply is part of another 
public agency is the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census’ ‘‘Census of Governments.’’ See 
U.S. Census Bureau, 2002 Census of 
Governments, Volume 1, Number 1, 
Government Organization, GC02(1)–1, 
U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC 20002 13 (http:// 
www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/ 
gc021x1.pdf). In contrast, regulations 
issued under the Fair Labor Standards 
Act (FLSA) use this test merely as one 
factor in determining what constitutes a 
separate public agency for its purposes. 
See 29 CFR 553.102. The Department 
proposes no changes to this section. 
Because the FMLA definition of ‘‘public 
agency’’ refers to the definition under 
the FLSA (29 U.S.C. 203(x)), however, 
the Department seeks public comment 
on whether this test in the FMLA 
regulations should be amended to 
conform with the test in the FLSA 
regulations. 
Section 825.109 (Federal agency 
coverage) 

This section of the existing 

regulations identifies the Federal 
agencies that are covered by the 
Department of Labor’s FMLA 
regulations. Shortly after these 
regulations were promulgated, Congress 
enacted the Congressional 
Accountability Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 
1301 (CAA), which in part amended the 
FMLA by repealing Title V of the FMLA 
pertaining to Congressional employees. 
See Section 504(b), Public Law 104–1. 
As a result, Congressional employees

are now covered by the CAA as 
administered by the Office of 
Compliance created by the CAA. 
Section 202(c) of the CAA also 

specifically provided that the General 
Accounting Office (now named the 
Government Accountability Office) 
(GAO) and Library of Congress (LOC) 
are subject to Title I of the FMLA. For 
those agencies, the FMLA is 
administered by the Comptroller 
General and the Librarian of Congress, 
respectively. See 29 U.S.C. 
2611(4)(A)(iv) and 2617(f). 

The CAA also called for a study of 

how the FMLA is administered for the 
Government Printing Office (GPO), as 
well as the GAO and LOC. 2 U.S.C. 
1371. The Congressional Office of 
Compliance issued its study on 
December 31, 1996. The study 
concluded that the GPO is covered by 
Title II and the Office of Personnel 
Management’s regulations, rather than 
Title I and the Department of Labor 
regulations. In a letter dated April 25, 
2000, the GPO asked the Department to 
amend its FMLA regulations to delete 
the reference to GPO coverage, because 
that agency is covered by Title II. In its 
response of January 31, 2001, the 
Department concurred with the 
conclusion that the GPO is covered by 
Title II and stated that it would amend 
the regulations accordingly whenever 
they were next modified. The proposal 
would amend paragraphs (a) and (d) of 
this section to reflect these changes. 

Pursuant to section 604(f) of the 

Postal Accountability and Enhancement 
Act, Public Law 109–435, Dec. 20, 2006, 
120 Stat. 3242, the Postal Rate 
Commission was redesignated as the 
Postal Regulatory Commission, and the 
proposed rule would amend paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section to reflect this 
change. 
Section 825.110 (‘‘Eligible’’ employee) 

Current § 825.110 sets forth the 

eligibility standards employees must 
meet in order to take FMLA leave. 
Specifically, current § 825.110(a) 
restates the statutory requirement that to 
be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee 
must have been employed by an 
employer for at least 12 months, have 
been employed for at least 1,250 hours 
of service during the 12 months 
preceding the leave, and be employed at 
a worksite where 50 or more employees 
are employed by the employer within 75 
miles of the worksite. 

Current § 825.110(b) provides detail 
on the requirement that the employee 
must have been employed by the 
employer for at least 12 months, stating 
that the 12 months need not be 
consecutive. It further explains that if 

the employee was maintained on the 
payroll for any part of a week, that week 
counts towards the employee’s fulfilling 
the 12 months employment requirement 
and that 52 weeks is deemed equal to 12 
months. 

In its RFI, the Department sought 

comment on whether and how to 
address the treatment of combining 
nonconsecutive periods of employment 
to meet the 12 months of employment 
requirement. (71 FR at 69508) This 
eligibility criterion has been the subject 
of litigation. In Rucker v. Lee Holding, 
Co., 471 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2006), the court 
considered whether an employee’s 
previous employment of five years 
counted toward the 12-month 
employment eligibility requirement 
even though it was separated by a five- 
year break in service from his current 
employment. The First Circuit Court of 
Appeals held that ‘‘the complete 
separation of an employee from his or 
her employer for a period of years, here 
five years, does not prevent the 
employee from counting earlier periods 
of employment toward satisfying the 12- 
month requirement.’’ Id. at 13. In regard 
to whether a break in service of more 
than five years would be permissible, 
the court stated that this important 
policy issue should be resolved by the 
Department in the first instance as a part 
of its exercise of its statutory authority. 
Id. 

A number of commenters urged the 

Department to support the Rucker 
decision that prior months of service 
may be combined for eligibility 
purposes even when separated by 
breaks in service of many years. The 
National Partnership for Women & 
Families, for example, stated that ‘‘an 
arbitrary time limit on how long a 
worker could leave the employment of 
a particular employer would operate as 
an unfair and disproportionate burden 
on women workers. Many women leave 
work for extended periods of time, for 
example, to stay home with young 
children during their formative years.’’ 
(See comments by National Partnership 
for Women & Families.) 

Employer comments received on this 

issue overwhelmingly disagreed with 
the First Circuit ruling on combining 
prior periods of service together. For 
example, the University of Notre Dame 
stated, ‘‘There is a tremendous 
administrative burden associated with 
adopting the First Circuit Court of 
Appeals’ interpretation of section 
825.110 that an employer has the duty 
to aggregate non-consecutive service to 
establish ‘12 months of service.’ As we 
understand this possible interpretation, 
the ability to aggregate past service with 
current service to equate to 12 months

is virtually unlimited.’’ Other comments 
received on this issue included 
suggestions for amending the 
regulations to allow the employer to: 
disregard prior employment periods if 
all ties between the company and 
worker were severed; follow company 
policy or State law regarding the 
treatment of previous employment; and 
require that the 12 months of 
employment be consecutive. Employer 
commenters cited the administrative 
burden associated with combining 
previous employment periods as the 
rationale for their recommendations 
including that the FMLA itself only 
requires recordkeeping for three years 
and not indefinitely. 

The Department received comments 
similar to these in response to the 1993 
interim final regulations, which 
suggested limiting the period of time 
used in determining whether the 
employee had been employed by the 
employer for 12 months. In the final 
regulations, however, the Department 
declined to include such a limit, 
reasoning that ‘‘[m]any employers 
require prospective employees to submit 
applications for employment which 
disclose employees’ previous 
employment histories. Thus, the 
information regarding previous 
employment with an employer should 
be readily available and may be 
confirmed by the employer’s records if 
a question arises.’’ (60 FR at 2185) 
Furthermore, the Department did not 
find a basis under the statute or its 
legislative history for adopting the 
recommendations received in response 
to the Interim Final Rule. Id. Indeed, the 
statute does not directly address the 
issue of whether the 12 months of 
employment must be consecutive, and 
the legislative history provides limited 
insight into Congressional intent 
regarding extended breaks in 
employment. The Senate Committee 
Report in discussing the requirement 
that the employee must have worked for 
the employer for 12 months states 
‘‘[t]hese 12 months of employment need 
not have been consecutive.’’ S. Rep. No. 
103–3, at 23 (1993). The House 
Committee Report uses the same 
language in describing the 12-month 
requirement. See H.R. Rep. No. 103–8, 
pt. 1, at 35 (1993). 

Based on the Department’s experience 

in administering the FMLA, the First 
Circuit’s ruling in Rucker, and 
comments received in response to the 
RFI, the Department proposes a new 
§ 825.110(b)(1) to provide that although 
the 12 months of employment need not 
be consecutive, employment prior to a 
continuous break in service of five years 
or more need not be counted. Thus, 

under the proposed rule, if an employee 
in 2008 has worked five months for an 
employer and worked for the same 
employer for two full years in 1997–8, 
the employer would not have to 
consider the two years of prior 
employment in determining whether the 
employee currently is eligible for FMLA 
leave. The FMLA requires covered 
employers to maintain records for three 
years. 29 CFR 825.500(b) (‘‘[E]mployers 
must keep the records specified by these 
regulations for no less than three years 
and make them available for inspection, 
copying, and transcription by 
representatives of the Department of 
Labor upon request.’’). The Department 
is not proposing to change the three- 
year record keeping requirements under 
FMLA. Thus, employers would have 
documentation to confirm previous 
employment for a former employee who 
at the time of rehiring had a break in 
service of three years or less. Where an 
employee relies on a period of 
employment that predates the 
employer’s records, it will be incumbent 
upon the employee to put forth some 
proof of the prior employment. This is 
consistent with the employee’s 
obligation to establish he or she is an 
eligible employee. See Novak v. 
MetroHealth Medical Center, 503 F.3d 
572, 577 (6th Cir. 2007); Burnett v. LFW, 
Inc., 472 F.3d 471, 477 (7th Cir. 2006). 
Of course, in determining whether an 
employee has met the eligibility 
criterion, an employer may have a 
policy to consider employment prior to 
a longer break in service, but in that 
event must do so in a uniform manner 
for all employees with similar breaks in 
service. 

The Department considered several 

alternatives in developing this proposed 
change to § 825.110(b). Because the 
legislative history states that the 12 
months of employment need not be 
consecutive, the Department could not 
adopt suggestions that any break in 
service ‘‘resets’’ the count for 
determining whether the employee has 
met the 12 months employment 
eligibility criterion. On the other hand, 
the Department believes it is not 
reasonable that the time frame used for 
considering prior employment for 
eligibility should be without end. At the 
same time, the Department is mindful of 
the comment by the National 
Partnership for Women & Families 
about the burden on women workers 
who may leave and reenter the 
workforce after the formative years of 
their children. But see S. Rep. No. 103– 
3, at 16 (1993). The Department believes 
that the proposed outer limit of a five 
year break in service is a permissible

interpretation of the statute and strikes 
an appropriate balance between 
providing re-employed workers with 
FMLA protections and not making the 
administration of the Act unduly 
burdensome for employers. 

However, the Department also 

proposes new paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section to address two exceptions to the 
general rule contained in proposed new 
paragraph (b)(1): a break in service 
resulting from the employee’s 
fulfillment of military obligations; and a 
period of approved absence or unpaid 
leave, such as for education or child- 
rearing purposes, where a written 
agreement or collective bargaining 
agreement exists concerning the 
employer’s intent to rehire the 
employee. In these situations, 
employment prior to the break in 
service must be used in determining 
whether the employee has been 
employed for at least 12 months, 
regardless of the length of the break in 
service. 

The current discussion of how weeks 
are counted for fulfilling the 12 months 
requirement is proposed to be re- 
designated as paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section. 

Further, the Department proposes to 

add a new paragraph (b)(4) in this 
section to note that nothing prevents an 
employer from considering employment 
prior to a continuous break in service of 
more than five years when determining 
if an employee meets the 12-month 
employment criterion provided the 
employer does so uniformly with 
respect to all employees with similar 
breaks in service. 

Paragraph (c) of § 825.110 is proposed 

to be revised to address hours an 
employee would have worked for his or 
her employer but for the employee’s 
fulfillment of military service 
obligations. This revision codifies the 
protections and benefits offered by the 
Uniformed Services Employment and 
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). 

In addition, the Department proposes 
several changes to § 825.110 in light of 
the Ragsdale decision. Current 
§ 825.110(c) may result in some 
instances in employees who are 
ineligible for FMLA leave nonetheless 
being ‘‘deemed eligible’’ because of an 
employer’s failure to meet its burden of 
maintaining records needed to establish 
the employee’s eligibility. Current 
§ 825.110(d) may also result in an 
employee who is not eligible for FMLA 
leave being ‘‘deemed eligible’’ based on 
the employer’s lack of (or incorrect) 
notice to the employee. Read in concert 
with Ragsdale, in which the U.S. 
Supreme Court invalidated a similar 
provision in the current § 825.700(a),

the Department believes these 
provisions in current § 825.110(c) and 
(d) need to be modified. 

On the other hand, the Court in 

Ragsdale suggested that if an employer 
fails to notify an employee of his or her 
FMLA rights, the employee may have a 
remedy if the employee can show that 
the employer interfered with, restrained 
or denied the employee the exercise of 
his or her FMLA rights and that the 
employee suffered damages as a result. 
See Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89. Therefore, 
the Department has incorporated into 
the proposed text of § 825.300 a 
statement that in these situations if an 
employee shows individualized harm 
because the employer interferes with, 
restrains or denies the employee of his 
or her FMLA rights, the employee is 
entitled to the remedies provided by the 
statute. The Department also proposes 
to add this language to § 825.220, which 
addresses how employees are protected 
when they assert their FMLA rights, and 
proposed § 825.301, which addresses 
designation of FMLA leave. 

For organizational purposes, the 

notice provisions contained in current 
§ 825.110(d) have been moved to 
proposed § 825.300(b) with other notice 
requirements employers must provide to 
employees under the regulations. This 
organizational change should make it 
easier for employees and employers to 
locate these requirements by 
consolidating them into one section. 
The proposal includes a cross-reference 
to § 825.300 in paragraph (d) of 
§ 825.110. 

The Department also proposes to 

clarify the language in current 
§ 825.110(d) stating that employee 
eligibility determinations ‘‘must be 
made as of the date leave commences.’’ 
This language has led to confusion 
when employees who have fulfilled the 
1,250 hours worked requirement for 
eligibility, but not the 12 months of 
employment requirement, begin a block 
of leave. (Although periods of leave do 
not count towards the 1,250 hour 
requirement because leave is not ‘‘hours 
worked,’’ periods of leave do count 
towards the 12 months of employment 
requirement because the employment 
relationship continues, and has not been 
severed, during the leave.) For example, 
where an employee who has worked for 
an employer for 11 months and 1,300 
hours commences a three month block 
of leave for birth and bonding, 
confusion exists as to whether that 
portion of the leave that occurs after the 
employee reaches 12 months of 
employment is FMLA protected. 
Compare Babcock v. BellSouth 
Advertising and Publishing Corp., 348 
F.3d 73 (4th Cir. 2003), with Willemssen 

v. The Conveyor Co., 359 F.Supp.2d 813 
(N.D. Iowa 2005). The proposal clarifies 
that when an employee is on leave at 
the time he or she meets the 12-month 
eligibility requirement, the period of 
leave prior to meeting the statutory 
requirement is non-FMLA leave and the 
period of leave after the statutory 
requirement is met is FMLA leave. 

The Department proposes to delete 

current § 825.110(e), regarding counting 
periods of employment prior to the 
effective date of the FMLA, because the 
revisions proposed in § 825.110(b) 
discussed above render the provision 
unnecessary. 

The Department proposes no changes 
to current paragraph (f) (paragraph (e) in 
the proposal) of this section, which 
states that whether an employee works 
for an employer who employs 50 or 
more employees within 75 miles of the 
worksite is determined as of the date the 
leave request is made. In the RFI, the 
Department sought comment on the 
differing regulatory tests used for 
determining employee eligibility: the 
determination of whether the employee 
has been employed for at least 12 
months and for at least 1,250 hours in 
the 12 months preceding the leave is 
made as of the date the leave is to 
commence; however, the determination 
of whether 50 employees are employed 
by the employer within 75 miles of the 
worksite is made as of the date the leave 
request is made (emphasis added). (71 
FR at 69508). Some of the comments 
received in response to the RFI urged 
the Department to make these tests the 
same, namely, to require the 
determination of employee eligibility in 
both cases as of the date the leave is to 
begin. The Department appreciates the 
difficulty experienced by many 
employers in complying with these 
different regulatory tests; however, the 
proposal does not adopt this suggestion 
for the reasons discussed in the 
preamble to the 1995 final regulations: 

[T]he purpose and structure of FMLA’s 

notice provisions intentionally encourage as 
much advance notice of an employee’s need 
for leave as possible, to enable both the 
employer to plan for the absence and the 
employee to make necessary arrangements 
for the leave. Both parties are served by 
making this determination when the 
employee requests leave. Tying the worksite 
employee-count to the date leave commences 
as suggested could create the anomalous 
result of both the employee and employer 
planning for the leave, only to have it denied 
at the last moment before it starts if fewer 
than 50 employees are employed within 75 
miles of the worksite at that time. This would 
entirely defeat the notice and planning 
aspects that are so integral and indispensable 
to the FMLA leave process. 
(60 FR at 2186) 

Section 825.111 (Determining whether 
50 employees are employed within 75 
miles) 

Current § 825.111 sets forth the 

standards for determining whether an 
employer employs 50 employees within 
75 miles for purposes of employee 
eligibility. Paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section provides that when an employee 
is jointly employed by two or more 
employers, the employee’s worksite is 
the primary employer’s office from 
which the employee is assigned or 
reports. 

In Harbert v. Healthcare Services 

Group, Inc., 391 F.3d 1140 (10th Cir. 
2004), the Court of Appeals held that 
§ 825.111(a)(3), as applied to the 
situation of an employee with a long- 
term fixed worksite at a facility of the 
secondary employer, was arbitrary and 
capricious because it: (1) Contravened 
the plain meaning of the term 
‘‘worksite’’ as the place where an 
employee actually works (as opposed to 
the location of the long-term care 
placement agency from which Harbert 
was assigned); (2) contradicted 
Congressional intent that if any 
employer, large or small, has no 
significant pool of employees nearby 
(within 75 miles) to cover for an absent 
employee, that employer should not be 
required to provide FMLA leave to that 
employee; and (3) created an arbitrary 
distinction between sole and joint 
employers. 

The court noted that Congress did not 

define the term ‘‘worksite’’ in the 
FMLA, and it concluded that the 
common understanding of the term 
‘‘worksite’’ is the site where the 
employee works. With respect to the 
employee eligibility requirement of 50 
employees within 75 miles, the court 
noted that Congress recognized that 
even potentially large employers may 
have difficulty finding temporary 
replacements for employees who work 
at geographically scattered locations. 
The court stated that Congress 
determined that if any employer (large 
or small) has no significant pool of 
employees in close geographic 
proximity to cover for an absent 
employee, that employer should not be 
required to provide FMLA leave to that 
employee. Therefore, the court 
concluded: 

An employer’s ability to replace a 

particular employee during his or her period 
of leave will depend on where that employee 
must perform his or her work. In general, 
therefore, the congressional purpose 
underlying the 50/75 provision is not 
effected if the ‘‘worksite’’ of an employee 
who has a regular place of work is defined 
as any site other than that place.

7884 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

391 F.3d at 1150. 

In comparing how the regulations 

apply the term ‘‘worksite’’ to joint 
employers and sole employers, the court 
stated: 

The challenged regulation also creates an 
arbitrary distinction between sole employers 
and joint employers. For example, if the 
employer is a company that operates a chain 
of convenience stores, the ‘‘worksite’’ of an 
employee hired to work at one of those 
convenience stores is that particular 
convenience store. See 58 Fed. Reg. 31794, 
31798 (1993). If, on the other hand, the 
employer is a placement company that hires 
certain specialized employees to work at 
convenience stores owned by another entity 
(and therefore is considered a joint 
employer), the ‘‘worksite’’ of that same 
employee hired to work at that same 
convenience store is the office of the 
placement company. 
Id. 

Importantly, the court did not 

invalidate the regulation with respect to 
employees who work out of their 
homes: ‘‘We do not intend this 
statement to cast doubt on the portion 
of the agency’s regulation defining the 
‘worksite’ of employees whose regular 
workplace is his or her home. See 29 
C.F.R. § 825.111(a)(2).’’ Id. at 1150 n.1. 
Nor did the court invalidate the 
regulatory definition in § 825.111(a)(3) 
with respect to employees of temporary 
help companies: ‘‘An employee of a 
temporary help agency does not have a 
permanent, fixed worksite. It is 
therefore appropriate that the joint 
employment provision defines the 
‘worksite’ of a temporary employee as 
the temporary help office, rather than 
the various changing locations at which 
the temporary employee performs his or 
her work.’’ Id. at 1153. 

The RFI requested specific 

information, in light of the court’s 
decision in Harbert, on the definition in 
§ 825.111 for determining employer 
coverage under the statutory 
requirement that FMLA-covered 
employers must employ 50 employees 
within 75 miles. 

Some commenters who argued that 

the current regulations are sound and do 
not require change pointed to the 
legislative history that the term 
‘‘worksite’’ is to be construed in the 
same manner as the term ‘‘single site of 
employment’’ under the WARN Act and 
the regulations under that Act. See 
comments by AFL-CIO and National 
Partnership for Women & Families. The 
AFL-CIO agreed with the dissent in 
Harbert that the Secretary’s 
interpretation of ‘‘single site of 
employment’’ under the WARN Act 
regulations as applying equally to 
employees with and without a fixed 
worksite is a ‘‘permissible and 

reasonable interpretation’’ and does not 
result in arbitrary differences between 
sole and joint employers under the 
FMLA. The National Partnership 
commented that the purpose of 
designating the primary office as the 
worksite is to ensure that the employer 
with the primary responsibility for the 
employee’s assignment is the one held 
accountable for compliance with these 
regulations. The National Partnership 
stated that the same principles 
articulated in the regulations with 
regard to ‘‘no fixed worksite’’ situations 
also should apply to this factual 
scenario. ‘‘In cases where employees 
have long-term assignments, we believe 
the purposes of the FMLA are best 
served by using the primary employer 
from which the employee is assigned as 
the worksite for determining FMLA 
coverage.’’ 

On the other hand, the law firm of 

Pilchak Cohen & Tice commented that, 
under the current regulations, 
employees at the same size 
establishment are treated differently 
because one works for a traditional sole 
employer and the other works for a 
staffing firm: 

For example, where a small retail store 

chain may have many employees nationwide, 
each store could employ fewer than 50 
employees. Those employees clearly would 
not be eligible for FMLA in the traditional 
employment context. Yet, under the current 
regulation, if that same retail chain utilized 
contract employees from an entity which 
employed more than 50 employees from its 
home office and that is where the contract 
employees received their assignments from 
or reported to, those contract employees 
could have FMLA rights at the retail chain. 
This creates an arbitrary distinction between 
sole and joint employers. . . .Under 29 C.F.R. 
§ 825.106(e), an employer could contract for 
an engineer, Employee A, for a six-month 
project, and then find out after the employee 
has only been there for two weeks, that 
Employee A will need 12 weeks off due to 
the upcoming birth of his child. Upon 
Employee A’s departure, the employer would 
then have to spend the time and expense 
training Employee B only to [be] forced to 
return Employee A to the position, even 
though it had already spent time training two 
individuals. The employer would then have 
to spend additional time and expense 
bringing Employee A ‘‘up to speed’’ on the 
project and complete the training initially 
started. 
Pilchak Cohen & Tice stated that the 
regulation would be more palatable if, to 
qualify for FMLA job restoration with 
the client company, the contract 
employee had to have at least 12 months 
of service at that location. 

The National Coalition to Protect 

Family Leave commented that the court 
in Harbert was correct in distinguishing 
between a jointly-employed employee 

who is assigned to a fixed worksite and 
a jointly-employed employee who has 
no fixed worksite and changes worksites 
regularly. ‘‘As for the former, the 
worksite for purposes of determining 
whether they are eligible employees 
* * * would be the fixed worksite of 
the secondary employer. As for the 
latter, the worksite would continue as 
stated in the regulation[.]’’ 

After weighing the comments on this 
issue submitted in response to the RFI, 
the Department believes it needs to 
amend the regulations to reflect the 
decision in Harbert. The proposed rule 
would modify § 825.111(a)(3) to state 
that after an employee who is jointly 
employed is stationed at a fixed 
worksite for a period of at least one year, 
the employee’s worksite for purposes of 
employee eligibility is the actual 
physical place where the employee 
works. No changes are proposed with 
respect to employees whose worksite 
has not been fixed for at least one year. 
Also, no changes are proposed for 
§ 825.111(a)(2) with respect to 
employees who work out of their 
homes, except to update the current 
language ‘‘as under the new concept of 
flexiplace’’ to give it a more modern 
meaning, ‘‘as under the concept of 
flexiplace or telecommuting.’’ 

The Department has not adopted the 

comment from Pilchak Cohen & Tice 
that in order to qualify for FMLA job 
restoration with the client company, a 
contract employee should have at least 
12 months of service at that location. To 
do so would take away the job 
restoration protections for an employee 
who is entitled to FMLA leave under the 
law. However, the primary 
responsibility for placement following 
FMLA leave rests with the primary 
employer, the staffing firm in the 
example given. The client company 
must consent to the placement only if it 
has used another contract employee 
from the same staffing firm to 
temporarily fill the position during the 
period of the FMLA leave.14 
Section 825.112 (Qualifying Reasons for 
Leave, General Rule) 

To make it easier to find information 
in the regulations, the Department has 

14 See 29 CFR 825.106(e). In the preamble to the 
final rule, the Department agreed with comments 
that joint employment relationships present special 
compliance concerns for temporary help and 
leasing agencies in that the ease with which they 
may be able to meet their statutory obligations 
under FMLA may depend largely on the nature of 
the relationship they have established with their 
client-employers. However, the Department found 
there were no viable alternatives that could be 
implemented by regulation that would not also 
deprive eligible employees of their statutory rights 
to job reinstatement at the conclusion of FMLA 
leave. See 60 FR at 2182.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

7885 

reorganized some sections, including 
portions of current § 825.112, which sets 
forth the qualifying reasons that entitle 
an eligible employee to FMLA-protected 
leave. For example, there is no single 
place in the current regulations for the 
provisions that address leave taken for 
the birth of a child or placement of a 
child for adoption or foster care. Rather, 
these provisions are scattered 
throughout several sections of the 
current regulations, including 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of current 
§ 825.112. 

No changes have been made to 

current paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section except for the addition of new 
paragraph titles. Language from current 
paragraphs (c) and (d) addressing leave 
taken prior to the birth of a child or 
placement of a child for birth or 
adoption has been moved to new 
sections in the proposed regulations that 
cover pregnancy, birth, adoption and 
foster care. See proposed §§ 825.120 and 
825.121. 

Current paragraph (e) of this section 

that addresses foster care has been 
moved to proposed § 825.122, which 
provides definitions for the various 
family relationships covered by the Act. 
Similarly, current paragraph (g) of this 
section, which addresses leave for 
substance abuse treatment and an 
employer’s ability to take disciplinary 
action in connection with substance 
abuse, has been moved to proposed 
§ 825.119 that specifically addresses 
leave in connection with substance 
abuse. 
Sections 825.113, 825.114, and 825.115
(Serious Health Condition, Inpatient 
Care, and Continuing Treatment) 

In response to the RFI, the 

Department received extensive 
commentary on the regulatory definition 
of a serious health condition. The full 
range of comments is discussed in detail 
in Chapters III and IV of the 
Department’s 2007 Report on the RFI 
comments (see 72 FR at 35563; 35571). 
There are six separate definitions of 
serious health condition in the 
regulations. Many stakeholders 
addressed their comments toward what 
is called the ‘‘objective test’’ contained 
in the regulations at § 825.114(a)(2), 
which defines ‘‘continuing treatment’’ 
as: 

(i) A period of incapacity * * * of more 

than three consecutive calendar days * * * 
that also involves: 

(A) Treatment two or more times by a 

health care provider * * * or 

(B) Treatment by a health care provider on 

at least one occasion which results in a 
regimen of continuing treatment under the 
supervision of the health care provider. 

29 CFR 825.114(a)(2)(i)(A)–(B). Many of 
the comments—including several from 
health care providers—reported that the 
current regulatory definition is ‘‘vague 
and confusing.’’ The American College 
of Occupational and Environmental 
Medicine stated, ‘‘The term ‘serious 
health condition’ is unnecessarily 
vague. Employees, employers and 
medical providers would be well served 
if the FMLA were to more clearly define 
the criteria for considering a health 
condition serious.’’ The American 
Academy of Family Physicians agreed: 
‘‘The definition of a serious health 
condition within the Act creates 
confusion not only for the 
administrators of the program and 
employers but also for physicians. 
Requiring a physician to certify that a 
gastrointestinal virus or upper 
respiratory infection is a serious health 
condition in an otherwise healthy 
individual is incongruous with medical 
training and experience. * * * . 
[Moreover, t]he categories of ‘Serious 
Health Conditions’ are overly 
complicated and * * * contradictory.’’ 

Many in the employer community 

focused their comments on the 
perceived lack of ‘‘seriousness’’ inherent 
in certain conditions the definition 
covers. The Coolidge Wall Company 
stated: ‘‘The DOL needs to limit the 
definition of serious health condition to 
what it was originally intended by 
Congress. For example, while a common 
cold or flu were never intended to be 
serious health conditions, in case law 
courts have essentially done away with 
all the exclusions from the original 
definition by stating that ‘complications’ 
(without defining this) could cause 
virtually anything (a cold, an earache, a 
cut on finger) to become a serious health 
condition.’’ ORC Worldwide concurred: 
‘‘Uniformly, employers have found the 
definition of ‘serious health condition’ 
and the criteria for determining whether 
or not an employee has a ‘serious health 
condition’ to be extremely broad and 
very confusing.’’ The City of 
Philadelphia wrote, ‘‘What constitutes a 
serious health condition? The definition 
is not clear.’’ 

Stakeholders proposed a number of 

potential revisions to the current 
definition of serious health condition. 
First, many commenters focused on the 
list of ailments in § 825.114(c), which 
states ‘‘Ordinarily, unless complications 
arise, the common cold, the flu, ear 
aches, upset stomach * * * etc., are 
examples of conditions that do not meet 
the definition of a serious health 
condition.’’ These commenters 
recommended that, consistent with the 
legislative intent that these conditions 
are not FMLA-covered conditions, this 

list be converted into a per se rule 
whereby these conditions can never be 
covered under the Act. That is, the flu— 
no matter how severe—could not be a 
serious health condition. Second, some 
commenters recommended that the 
‘‘more than three days’’ period of 
incapacity in the objective test be 
measured by work days as opposed to 
calendar days. Here, too, the 
commenters cited to legislative history 
to support their position: ‘‘[w]ith respect 
to an employee, the term ‘serious health 
condition’ is intended to cover 
conditions or illnesses that affect an 
employee’s health to the extent that he 
or she must be absent from work on a 
recurring basis or for more than a few 
days for treatment or recovery.’’ H.R. 
Rep. No. 103–8, at 40 (1993); S. Rep. No. 
103–3, at 28 (1993) (emphasis added). 
Third, a number of stakeholders 
commented that the two health care 
provider visits in § 825.114(a)(2)(i)(B) 
must occur during the ‘‘more than three 
days’’ period of incapacity. Finally, a 
number of comments recommended that 
the required period of incapacity be 
extended from ‘‘more than three days’’ 
to five or seven or ten days or more. 

At the same time, the Department also 

received many comments from 
employees and employee groups who 
felt that the current objective test is a 
good, clear test that is serving its 
intended purpose. For example, the 
National Partnership for Women & 
Families stated, ‘‘[T]he current 
regulations are crafted appropriately to 
provide guidance on what constitutes a 
serious health condition without 
imposing overly rigid criteria that could 
hinder the ability of workers to take 
leave when necessary.’’ Families USA 
concurred: ‘‘To protect employers from 
employee abuse of this provision, the 
regulations establish an objective 
criteria to be used to determine whether 
conditions presented qualify for leave. 
This criteria creates a standard that can 
be applied in individual cases with 
sufficient flexibility to adjust for 
differences in how individuals are 
affected by illness. It also specifies that 
routine health matters cannot be 
considered serious health conditions, 
unless complications arise.’’ 

After a review of the statute, the 

legislative history, and the significant 
feedback received from stakeholders in 
response to the RFI, the Department has 
not identified an alternative approach to 
the definition that would still cover all 
the types of conditions Congress 
intended to cover under the FMLA, but 
without also including some conditions 
that many believe the legislative history 
indicated should not be covered. The 
Department is well aware, as evidenced

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

by the extensive comments on this issue 
to the RFI, that many of the policy 
choices made in defining a serious 
health condition have not been without 
consequence. For example, the 
Department could put a higher degree of 
‘‘seriousness’’ into the regulatory 
definition if we chose to adopt any one 
of the suggestions offered by employers 
to increase the required number of days 
of incapacity or to simply adopt a work 
days rather than a calendar days 
standard. Doing so would also go a long 
way to eliminate what many employers 
believe to be the ‘‘weekend’’ problem— 
that is, employers’ inability to know or 
verify that an employee, who works a 
regular Monday through Friday 
schedule, is off on Saturday and 
Sunday, then calls in sick on Monday 
claiming an FMLA absence, was in fact 
incapacitated during the two days he or 
she was off work for the weekend, and 
meets the more than three consecutive 
calendar days standard (see e.g., 
comment by Southwest Airlines Co., 
‘‘Unscheduled intermittent leave, which 
is typically based on recurring episodes 
of minor health conditions, gives 
employees many opportunities to 
misuse FMLA leave—to take vacations 
or a long weekend when they otherwise 
would be unable to do so * * *.’’). 
However, Congress itself did not 
provide a statutory ‘‘bright line’’ of 
demarcation for ‘‘seriousness.’’ The Act 
defines serious health condition as 
either ‘‘an illness, injury, impairment, or 
physical or mental condition that 
involves—(A) inpatient care in a 
hospital, hospice, or residential medical 
care facility; or (B) continuing treatment 
by a health care provider.’’ 29 U.S.C. 
2611(11). ‘‘Continuing treatment’’ is not 
further defined by the Act and Congress 
declined to establish any bright-line 
rules of what was covered and what was 
not. See discussion infra about chronic 
conditions specifically. 

A review of the Preamble 

accompanying the current regulations 
reflects the struggle then, as now, to 
craft such an objective definition of 
serious health condition that covers all 
the conditions intended to be covered 
by the Act while still giving meaning to 
the legislative history that minor 
ailments like colds and flus generally 
not be covered. It also reflects the choice 
then, as now, between an objective test 
versus a list of types of health 
conditions that would qualify as 
serious. See 60 FR at 2191. There is no 
question, as explained by the legislative 
history, that Congress expected minor 
conditions (those that last less than a 
few days) to not be covered by the 
FMLA because they would likely be 

covered by a company’s sick leave 
policy. See H.R. Rep. No. 103–8, at 40 
(1993); S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 28 (1993). 
The difficulty is in adequately drawing 
the line between conditions that usually 
resolve in a few days, and those that are 
‘‘serious.’’ Medical conditions that are 
benign to some may be truly 
incapacitating to others. For example, 
the Communication Workers of America 
submitted a comment to the RFI noting 
an employee who had a severe reaction 
to poison oak and was incapacitated for 
more than three days even though most 
individuals would have only a mild 
reaction to poison oak. As a result of all 
these factors, the Department has 
retained essentially the current 
definition of ‘‘serious health condition,’’ 
with some slight modifications as 
discussed below. 

The Department has reorganized the 

structure of the definition so both 
employees and employers can better 
understand what constitutes a serious 
health condition. As noted above, 
serious health condition is currently 
defined in six different ways, and only 
one of the alternatives actually requires 
an absence of more than three 
consecutive calendar days under the 
current regulations. The Department 
believes that the new proposed structure 
will make the definition clearer. 
Section 825.113 (Serious Health 
Condition) 

Current § 825.113 addresses the 

definition of a parent, spouse, son or 
daughter. In the proposed regulations, 
the Department has moved this to 
§ 825.122 for purposes of organization. 
Proposed § 825.113 is titled ‘‘Serious 
health condition’’ and provides the 
general rules and accompanying 
definitions governing what constitutes a 
serious health condition. Proposed 
§ 825.113(a) provides the basic 
definition of what constitutes a serious 
health condition currently found in 
§ 825.114(a). Proposed paragraph (b) 
contains a definition of what constitutes 
‘‘incapacity’’ and incorporates language 
from current § 825.114(a)(2)(i) and (ii) 
without change. Proposed paragraph (c) 
contains the definition of ‘‘treatment’’ 
found in current § 825.114(b) without 
change. 

Proposed paragraph (d) addresses the 
types of treatments and conditions not 
ordinarily expected to be covered by the 
definition and incorporates language 
from current § 825.114(c). As discussed 
above, this section has been the focus of 
considerable debate as to when the list 
of conditions enumerated (colds, flus, 
etc.) are or are not serious health 
conditions. The Department received 
many comments in response to the RFI 

on this issue from both employer and 
employee groups but has not been able 
to construct an alternative regulatory 
definition better than the objective test 
of more than three days incapacity plus 
treatment. The language of current 
§ 825.114(c) listing common ailments 
and conditions—‘‘Ordinarily, unless 
complications arise, the common cold, 
the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, * * * 
etc., are examples of conditions that do 
not meet the definition of a serious 
health condition’’—was intended to be 
merely illustrative of the types of 
conditions that would not ordinarily 
qualify as serious health conditions. 
This sentence was not intended to 
create its own substantive definition of 
serious health condition that 
categorically excluded the listed 
conditions. Section 825.114(c) did not 
create a definition of covered conditions 
separate and apart from the regulatory 
definitions of serious health condition 
in § 825.114(a). 

The Department’s original opinion 

letter in 1995 stated that a minor illness 
such as the common cold could not be 
a serious health condition because colds 
were on the regulatory list of non- 
covered ailments. ‘‘The fact that an 
employee is incapacitated for more than 
three days, has been treated by a health 
care provider on at least one occasion 
which has resulted in a regimen of 
continuing treatment prescribed by the 
health care provider does not convert 
minor illnesses such as the common 
cold into serious health conditions in 
the ordinary case (absent 
complications).’’ Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA–57 (Apr. 7, 1995). 
Unfortunately, this was an incorrect 
statement of the law. As the Department 
explained in its subsequent 1996 
opinion letter: 

The FMLA regulations * * * provide 

examples, in section 825.114(c), of 
conditions that ordinarily, unless 
complications arise, would not meet the 
regulatory definition of a serious health 
condition and would not, therefore, qualify 
for FMLA leave: the common cold, the flu, 
ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, 
headaches other than migraine, routine 
dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal 
disease, etc. Ordinarily, these health 
conditions would not meet the definition in 
825.114(a)(2), as they would not be expected 
to last for more than three consecutive 
calendar days and require continuing 
treatment by a health care provider as 
defined in the regulations. If, however, any 
of these conditions met the regulatory criteria 
for a serious health condition, e.g., an 
incapacity of more than three consecutive 
calendar days that also involves qualifying 
treatment, then the absence would be 
protected by the FMLA.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

7887 

Wage and Hour Opinion Letter FMLA– 
86 (Dec. 12, 1996) (emphasis in 
original). This objective regulatory 
definition was upheld as a reasonable 
implementation of the Act by two 
United States Courts of Appeals even 
though the definition may sweep into its 
coverage some conditions Congress did 
not necessarily anticipate would be 
covered. See Miller v. AT&T Corp., 250 
F.3d 820, 835 (4th Cir. 2001) (‘‘It is 
possible, of course, that the definition 
adopted by the Secretary will, in some 
cases— and perhaps even in this one— 
provide FMLA coverage to illnesses that 
Congress never envisioned would be 
protected. We cannot say, however, that 
the regulations adopted by the Secretary 
are so manifestly contrary to 
congressional intent as to be considered 
arbitrary.’’); Thorson v. Gemini, Inc., 
205 F.3d 370, 380 (8th Cir. 2000) 
(‘‘Under the DOL’s definition, it is 
possible that some absences for minor 
illnesses that Congress did not intend to 
be classified as ‘serious health 
conditions’ may qualify for FMLA 
protection. But the DOL reasonably 
decided that such would be a legitimate 
trade-off for having a definition of 
‘serious health condition’ that sets out 
an objective test that all employers can 
apply uniformly.’’). 

The Department considered whether 

the list of examples of non-serious 
ailments such as colds and flus in 
current § 825.114(c) should be deleted 
as surplusage. Both the Fourth and 
Eighth Circuit courts treated the list of 
examples of non-serious ailments in 
current § 825.114(c) as merely clarifying 
that common ailments such as colds and 
flu normally will not qualify for FMLA 
leave because they generally will not 
satisfy the regulatory criteria for a 
serious health condition. The 
Department continues to believe that the 
§ 825.114(c) list serves a baseline 
purpose as explanatory language similar 
to that which is included in a preamble. 
Therefore, the sentence has been 
retained in the proposed regulations. 
Nevertheless, the Department agrees 
with the Fourth and Eighth Circuit 
Courts of Appeals and restates its view 
that the Department’s objective 
regulatory definition is dispositive. 
Section 825.114 (Inpatient Care) 

Proposed § 825.114, titled, ‘‘Inpatient 
care,’’ defines what constitutes inpatient 
care. As noted above, the Department 
proposes a stand-alone definition of 
‘‘incapacity’’ in § 825.113(b) in contrast 
to the current regulations. Therefore, the 
definitional language of incapacity has 
been removed from the definition of 
‘‘inpatient’’ care, but the requirement

remains and a cross-reference to 
§ 825.113(b) has been included. 
Section 825.115 (Continuing Treatment) 

Proposed § 825.115, titled 

‘‘Continuing treatment,’’ defines 
continuing treatment for purposes of 
establishing a serious health condition. 
The five different definitions are 
contained in § 825.115(a)–(e). Proposed 
§ 825.115(a) (‘‘Incapacity and 
treatment’’) incorporates language from 
current § 825.114(a)(2)(i)(A) and (B), 
which establishes that an employee can 
meet this definition if, in connection 
with a period of incapacity of more than 
three consecutive calendar days, the 
employee or family member has one 
visit to a health care provider and a 
regimen of continuing treatment, such 
as a prescription, or two visits to a 
health care provider. 

As discussed further below 

concerning proposed § 825.125, the 
Department proposes a conforming 
change in the definition of ‘‘continuing 
treatment’’ to generally recognize 
physician assistants as health care 
providers, which eliminates the need to 
refer to them separately in this section 
as performing ‘‘under direct supervision 
of a health care provider’’ (see current 
§§ 825.114(a)(2)(i)(A) and (iii)(A)). 
Otherwise, the current definition has 
been retained with one further proposed 
clarification. The Department proposes 
to specify that the two visits to a health 
care provider must occur within 30 days 
of the beginning of the period of 
incapacity unless extenuating 
circumstances exist, instead of the 
completely open-ended time frame 
under the current regulations. 
Accordingly, if an ill employee visits 
his/her health care provider, is told not 
to report to work for more than 3 days 
due to the health condition but is not 
prescribed any medication, whether the 
condition is considered a serious health 
condition for FMLA purposes will 
depend on whether the health care 
provider determines that additional 
treatment is needed within 30 days of 
the beginning of the initial period of 
incapacity (for example, whether the 
provider determines that an additional 
follow-up appointment should be 
scheduled in two weeks or two months). 
The beginning of the period of 
incapacity will usually correspond with 
the date of the employee’s first absence, 
however, as under the current 
regulations, the more than three 
calendar day period of incapacity may 
commence on a day on which the 
employee is not scheduled to work. See 
60 FR 2195. 

The Department proposes this 

clarification because it believes, as a 

practical matter, that leaving the 
treatment requirement open-ended does 
not provide sufficient guidance for 
determining when the employee has a 
qualifying serious health condition. For 
example, under the current definition, 
an employer could decide that an 
employee does not qualify for FMLA 
coverage a week after an employee has 
been to see a health care provider on 
one occasion and has had more than 
three days of incapacity but no follow- 
up visit during that week-long time 
period. If the employee had a follow-up 
visit three months later, however, the 
test would be met but the employer may 
not be aware of that fact. The 
Department does not believe the 
regulations should leave such 
determinations open-ended and 
unresolved indefinitely. Rather, the 
period of incapacity and the timing of 
the health care provider’s treatment 
regimen should be connected in a 
temporal sense to meet the definitional 
requirement and not left undefined as 
under the current rule. 

The Department received many 

comments to the record on this issue, 
including a number suggesting that the 
Department adopt into regulation the 
interpretation offered by the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Tenth 
Circuit that the two treatments actually 
occur during the period of more than 
three days’ incapacity in order to qualify 
as a serious health condition. See Jones 
v. Denver Pub. Sch., 427 F.3d 1315, 
1323 (10th Cir. 2005) (‘‘[U]nder the 
regulations defining ‘continuing 
treatment by a health care provider,’ the 
‘[t]reatment two or more times’ 
described in 825.114(a)(2)(i)(A) must 
take place during the ‘period of 
incapacity’ required by 
825.114(a)(2)(i).’’). However, the 
Department believes the proposed 30- 
day limitation is more appropriate in 
that it guards against employers making 
quick judgments that deny FMLA leave 
when employees otherwise should 
qualify for FMLA protections. The 
Department is also aware that 
occasionally an employee may need a 
second visit to a health care provider or 
further diagnostic testing within a 30- 
day period but may experience 
difficulty scheduling the second 
appointment in time. The regulations 
therefore acknowledge an ‘‘extenuating 
circumstances’’ exception to the 30-day 
rule in proposed § 825.115(a)(1). 

The Department is not proposing to 
extend the 30-day rule to treatment by 
a health care provider on at least one 
occasion, which results in a regimen of 
continuing treatment under the 
supervision of the health care provider.

7888 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

experience suggests that the doctor visit 
which results in a regimen of continuing 
treatment generally occurs close in time 
to the more than three days of 
incapacity. Accordingly, the 30-day 
limitation is not needed and could, in 
fact, extend the time period for 
receiving the regimen of treatment well 
beyond what is current practice. The 
Department, however, seeks comments 
on this approach, and whether this 
regulatory provision should be changed. 

Proposed § 825.115(b), titled 
‘‘Pregnancy or prenatal care,’’ 
incorporates language from current 
§ 825.114(a)(2)(ii) without change 
except for a reference to the new 
consolidated section found in proposed 
§ 825.120 addressing leave for 
pregnancy and childbirth discussed in 
detail below. The Department wishes to 
emphasize, however, that the phrase 
‘‘incapacity due to pregnancy, or for 
prenatal care’’ includes time spent with 
a health care provider for prenatal care 
purposes. By definition, while an 
employee is visiting a health care 
provider for prenatal care purposes (i.e., 
a doctor’s appointment), the employee 
is unable to work and therefore 
incapacitated. In contrast, however, an 
employee is not entitled to FMLA leave 
to visit the store to purchase infant 
clothes because the employee is not 
incapacitated in such circumstances. In 
a case where a male employee is needed 
to care for (as defined by proposed 
§ 825.124) a pregnant spouse who is 
incapacitated or requires prenatal care, 
the male employee will be entitled to 
FMLA leave. For example, a male 
employee’s pregnant spouse may have 
severe morning sickness and need his 
assistance. Similarly, a male employee 
may be entitled to FMLA leave to 
accompany his pregnant spouse to a 
doctor’s appointment for prenatal care. 
In this case, physical care may not be 
needed, but psychological care may be 
involved. 

Proposed § 825.115(c), titled ‘‘Chronic 
conditions,’’ incorporates language from 
current § 825.114(a)(2)(iii) with one 
modification. The Department received 
extensive comments about the 
definition of ‘‘chronic’’ serious health 
conditions in response to the RFI. As a 
result, the Department provided 
extensive discussion and explanation in 
its Report on the RFI to the evolution of 
the ‘‘chronic’’ serious health condition 
definition. See Chapter IV of the RFI 
Report, 72 FR at 35571. 

As the Department explained in the 

Report on the RFI comments, ‘‘[t]here is 
no definition or specific mention of a 
‘chronic’ serious health condition in the 
Act. The House and Senate Committee 
Reports do, however, refer to conditions 

where ‘the underlying health condition 
or treatment for it requires that the 
employee be absent from work on a 
recurring basis * * * [A] patient with 
severe arthritis may require periodic 
treatment such as physical therapy.’ ’’ 72 
FR at 35572 (internal citations omitted). 
Many employer commenters were 
highly critical of the choice made by the 
Department in the 1995 final rule to 
allow employees to ‘‘self-treat’’ for 
‘‘any’’ period of incapacity due to 
chronic conditions. See current 
§ 825.114(e): ‘‘Absences attributable to 
incapacity under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) or 
(iii) [chronic conditions] qualify for 
FMLA leave even though the employee 
or the family member does not receive 
treatment from a health care provider 
during the absence, and even if the 
absence does not last more than three 
days.’’ Indeed, many employer 
commenters believe that coverage for 
absences due to chronic conditions 
which are accompanied only by self- 
treatment impermissibly undercuts the 
statutory requirement that intermittent 
leave may be taken only when 
medically necessary (29 U.S.C. 
2612(b)(1)) as there is no way to verify 
the medical necessity of an absence for 
self-treatment. (See, e.g., discussion of 
Workplace Consequences of 
Unscheduled Intermittent Leave in the 
Report on the RFI comments, 72 FR at 
35575.) Employee representatives 
commenting on the RFI, however, 
stressed that self-treatment is 
appropriate for many chronic conditions 
and that coverage for such absences is 
crucial to ensuring that employees with 
chronic serious health conditions are 
able to maintain their employment. Id. 
at 35575; 35580. 

While many employers urged the 
Department to alter the definition so 
that only chronic conditions that they 
perceive to be ‘‘serious’’ will be covered, 
and to eliminate the self-treatment 
provision, the Department declines to 
do so. As explained in the preamble 
when the current rule was adopted in 
1995, 

The Department concurs with the 

comments that suggested that special 
recognition should be given to chronic 
conditions. The Department recognizes that 
certain conditions, such as asthma and 
diabetes, continue over an extended period of 
time (i.e., from several months to several 
years), often without affecting day-to-day 
ability to work or perform other activities but 
may cause episodic periods of incapacity of 
less than three days. Although persons with 
such underlying conditions generally visit a 
health care provider periodically, when 
subject to a flare-up or other incapacitating 
episode, staying home and self-treatment are 
often more effective than visiting the health 
care provider (e.g., the asthma sufferer who

is advised to stay home and inside due to the 
pollen count being too high). The definition 
has, therefore, been revised to include such 
conditions as serious health conditions, even 
if the individual episodes of incapacity are 
not of more than three days duration. 
60 FR at 2195. 

Although the Department 

acknowledges employers’ concerns 
regarding the inability to verify the 
medical necessity for an absence 
involving self-treatment, to eliminate 
coverage for such absences at this time 
would, like changing the calendar days 
standard to a work days standard, 
effectively render many currently- 
covered employees who have received 
the protections of the law ineligible. As 
the Department acknowledged in the 
Report on the RFI, it has no way to 
distinguish between those employees 
with chronic conditions who may be, in 
their employers’ views, taking 
advantage of the self-treatment standard 
and those who are not and for whom the 
standard has worked very well. 

The Department does propose one 

modification to the definition of a 
chronic serious health condition. 
Current § 825.114(a)(2)(iii) provides that 
a chronic serious health condition 
‘‘[r]equires periodic visits for treatment’’ 
(§ 825.114(a)(2)(iii)(A)). The current 
regulations do not define the term 
‘‘periodic.’’ The Department 
understands that some employers have 
chosen to provide their own definition 
of the term ‘‘periodic’’ for FMLA 
purposes to the detriment of employees. 
For example, one employer defined the 
term to require a visit to a health care 
provider at least once a month in order 
to satisfy this prong of the continuing 
treatment definition. The Department 
believes that not all serious health 
conditions Congress intended to cover 
require such frequent visits. For 
example, an employee may have 
epilepsy, which renders the employee 
unable to work periodically but does not 
require monthly doctor visits since the 
employee knows how to self-medicate. 
At the same time, because ‘‘periodic’’ is 
left open-ended in the current 
regulations, employers have struggled 
with the ‘‘periodic’’ requirement. The 
Department believes such a lack of 
definition leaves employers and 
employees in an untenable situation. 
(See Executive Summary and Chapters 
IV and VI of the Department’s 2007 
Report on the RFI comments, 72 FR at 
35550, 35571, 35588.) The Department 
proposes to define the term ‘‘periodic’’ 
as twice or more a year, based on an 
expectation that employees with 
chronic serious health conditions 
generally will visit their health care 
providers with that minimum

frequency, but they may not visit them 
more frequently, especially if their 
conditions are stable. The Department 
believes this is reasonable but seeks 
public comments on whether the 
proposed definition of the term 
‘‘periodic’’ is appropriate. 

Proposed § 825.115(d), titled 

‘‘Permanent or long-term conditions,’’ 
incorporates language from current 
§ 825.114(a)(2)(iv) without change. 
Proposed § 825.115(e), titled 
‘‘Conditions requiring multiple 
treatments,’’ incorporates language from 
current § 825.114(a)(2)(v), which 
provides coverage for any period of 
absence to receive multiple treatments 
by a health care provider for restorative 
surgery after an accident or other injury, 
or for a condition that would likely 
result in a period of incapacity of more 
than three consecutive calendar days in 
the absence of medical intervention or 
treatment for conditions such as cancer, 
severe arthritis, and kidney disease. 
Multiple treatments are required to 
satisfy this prong of the continuing 
treatment definition. 
Sections 825.116 Through 825.118 
(Reserved) 

Provisions in current § 825.116 

defining the phrase ‘‘needed to care for’’ 
a family member are moved to proposed 
§ 825.124, discussed below. Provisions 
in current § 825.117 addressing the 
‘‘medical necessity’’ for taking and 
scheduling intermittent or reduced 
schedule leave are moved to proposed 
§§ 825.202 and .203, discussed below. 
Current § 825.118 defining ‘‘health care 
provider’’ is renumbered as § 825.125 of 
the proposed rule. Section numbers 
.116–.118 of the current rule are, 
therefore, reserved to reflect these 
organizational changes, as discussed 
further below. 
Section 825.119 (Leave for Treatment of 
Substance Abuse) 

The Department proposes to create a 
single, consolidated section to address 
substance abuse, which is currently 
addressed in two different sections of 
the regulations, specifically 
§§ 825.112(g) and .114(d). Current 
§ 825.112(g) provides that while FMLA 
leave is available for substance abuse 
treatment, treatment does not prevent an 
employer from taking employment 
action against an employee for violating 
the employer’s substance abuse policy, 
such as being intoxicated at work. The 
section further explains when such 
action is appropriate. Current 
§ 825.114(d) states that substance abuse 
treatment may be covered as a serious 
health condition in certain 
circumstances.

Section 825.120 (Leave for Pregnancy or 
Birth) 

The Department proposes to create a 

single section that addresses FMLA 
rights and responsibilities related to 
pregnancy and birth of a child. The 
current regulations contain regulatory 
guidance pertaining to pregnancy and 
birth throughout a number of regulatory 
sections. This new proposed section 
collects the existing guidance from the 
various regulatory sections into one 
comprehensive section. 

Section 825.120(a)(1) of the proposed 

rule, titled ‘‘[g]eneral rules,’’ restates 
language from current § 825.112(b) that 
both the mother and father are entitled 
to FMLA leave for the birth of their 
child. Proposed paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section restates language from current 
§ 825.201 explaining that leave 
following the birth of a healthy child 
(‘‘bonding time’’) must be completed 
within a year from the birth unless State 
law provides for a longer period of time 
or with an employer’s agreement. Based 
on the statutory requirements (see 29 
U.S.C. 2612(a)(2)), if leave is extended 
beyond a year from the birth per State 
law or employment agreement, the 
additional leave would not receive the 
FMLA protections. Proposed paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section incorporates 
language from current § 825.202(a), that 
husbands and wives who work for the 
same employer may be limited to a 
combined 12 weeks of FMLA leave for 
the birth or placement for adoption or 
foster care of a healthy child, or to care 
for an employee’s parent with a serious 
health condition. (See 29 U.S.C. 
2612(f).) This limitation does not apply 
if only one spouse is eligible for FMLA 
leave. For example, if a wife 
commenced employment with the 
employer only 6 months earlier and 
therefore does not meet the 12-month/ 
1,250-hour eligibility requirement, but 
the husband has worked for the 
employer for five years and otherwise 
meets the eligibility requirements, the 
husband could take twelve weeks of 
leave to be with the newborn child. 
However, if the husband and wife have 
both worked for the same employer for 
five years and the husband already has 
used six weeks of his entitlement to care 
for his parent, the wife may be limited 
to six weeks to be with the newborn 
child (the wife would also be entitled to 
leave for her own serious health 
condition related to the birth). 

Proposed § 825.120(a)(4) combines 

language from current 
§§ 825.114(a)(2)(ii), 825.114(e), and 
825.112(a) and (c) to make clear that a 
mother may be entitled to FMLA leave 
for both prenatal care and incapacity 

related to pregnancy, and the mother’s 
serious health condition following the 
birth of a child. 

Proposed § 825.120(a)(6) has been 

added to reemphasize that both spouses 
may each take their full 12 weeks of 
leave to care for a child with a serious 
health condition, regardless of whether 
the spouses work for the same 
employer. 

Proposed § 825.120(b), titled 

‘‘[i]ntermittent and reduced schedule 
leave,’’ combines language from current 
§§ 825.203(b) and 825.204(a) on the use 
of intermittent or reduced schedule 
leave for pregnancy and birth of a child. 
See 29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(1). Current 
§ 825.203(b) provides that leave taken 
after the birth of a healthy newborn 
child may only be taken on an 
intermittent or reduced leave schedule 
if the employer agrees. Current 
§ 825.204(a) explains that in these cases, 
an employer may temporarily transfer 
an employee to an available alternative 
position that better accommodates the 
need for intermittent or reduced 
schedule leave if the employer does in 
fact agree to such a leave schedule. See 
29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(2). The hours not 
worked due to a reduced leave schedule 
in this situation are considered 
intermittent FMLA leave and are 
counted toward the employee’s FMLA 
leave entitlement (see proposed 
§ 825.205). Proposed § 825.120(b) 
emphasizes that if intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave is medically 
necessary for a serious health condition 
of the mother or the newborn child, no 
employer agreement is necessary. 
Section 825.121 (Leave for Adoption or 
Foster Care) 

For the same reasons discussed above, 

the Department also proposes a single 
section that discusses FMLA rights and 
obligations with regard to adoption and 
foster care. The current regulations 
contain guidance pertaining to adoption 
and foster care throughout a number of 
sections. This new proposed section 
collects the existing guidance from the 
various regulatory sections into one 
comprehensive section on adoption and 
foster care. 

Proposed § 825.121(a) is titled 

‘‘[g]eneral rules’’ and provides that leave 
for adoption or foster care may begin 
prior to the actual birth or adoption. 
Examples incorporated from current 
§ 825.112(d) include leave to attend 
counseling sessions, appear in court, 
consult with an attorney or doctor, or 
submit to a physical examination. The 
proposed section also cross-references 
proposed paragraph (b) of this section, 
which explains the statutory limitation 
that leave following the placement for

adoption and foster care of a healthy 
child can only be taken on an 
intermittent or reduced schedule basis if 
the employer agrees. See 29 U.S.C. 
2612(b)(1). 

Proposed § 825.121(a)(2) contains 

language from current § 825.201 
explaining that leave for adoption or 
foster care must be completed within a 
year from the placement unless State 
law provides for a longer period of time 
or with an employer’s agreement. Such 
leave taken under State law or with an 
employer’s agreement beyond the one 
year period is not protected as FMLA 
leave. Section 825.121(a)(3) also 
incorporates language from current 
§ 825.202(a), that husbands and wives 
working for the same employer are 
limited to a combined 12 weeks of leave 
for purposes of bonding with the 
healthy adopted or foster child, to care 
for the healthy child following the birth 
of the child, and to care for an 
employee’s parent with a serious health 
condition. As discussed above under 
proposed § 825.120, this limitation does 
not apply if only one spouse is eligible 
for FMLA leave. See 29 U.S.C. 2612(f). 

Proposed § 825.121(a)(4) has been 

added to emphasize that both spouses 
may each take their full twelve weeks of 
FMLA leave to care for an adopted or 
foster child with a serious health 
condition, regardless of whether the 
spouses work for the same employer. 

Proposed § 825.121(b), titled ‘‘[u]se of 

intermittent and reduced schedule 
leave,’’ combines language from current 
§§ 825.203(b) and 825.204(a) on the use 
of intermittent or reduced schedule 
leave for adoption and foster care. 
Current § 825.203(b) provides that leave 
taken after the placement of a healthy 
child for adoption or foster care may 
only be taken on an intermittent or 
reduced leave basis if the employer 
agrees. See 29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(1). Current 
§ 825.204(a) explains that in such cases, 
an employer may temporarily transfer 
an employee to an available alternative 
position that better accommodates the 
need for intermittent or reduced 
schedule leave. See 29 U.S.C. 
2612(b)(2). The hours not worked due to 
a reduced leave schedule in this 
situation are considered intermittent 
FMLA leave and are counted toward the 
employee’s FMLA leave entitlement (see 
proposed § 825.205). Proposed 
§ 825.121(b) provides that if intermittent 
or reduced schedule leave is needed for 
a serious health condition of the 
adopted or foster child, no employer 
agreement is necessary.

Section 825.122 (Definition of Spouse, 
Parent, Son or Daughter, Adoption and 
Foster Care) 

Current § 825.113 provides definitions 

of spouse, parent, and son or daughter 
for purposes of determining whether an 
employee qualifies for FMLA leave. 
These definitions are repeated in 
current and proposed § 825.800. The 
Department proposes to move the 
existing section to proposed § 825.122 
for purposes of organization. Proposed 
§ 825.122(a) and (b) defining spouse and 
parent are unchanged except for minor 
editorial changes in paragraph (b) to the 
definition of ‘‘parent.’’ 

Proposed § 825.122(c) that addresses, 
and is now titled, ‘‘[s]on or daughter,’’ 
has been rewritten for clarity. The one 
substantive addition the Department 
proposes is to specify that the 
determination of whether an adult child 
has a disability should be made at the 
time leave is to commence. In Bryant v. 
Delbar, 18 F.Supp.2d 799 (M.D. Tenn. 
1998), the court conducted an analysis 
of whether an adult child had a 
disability for purposes of FMLA 
coverage based on facts and 
circumstances that occurred well after 
the leave commenced. In the 
Department’s view, employers should 
decide FMLA eligibility based on 
information at the time the leave begins. 
A rule that takes into account 
information acquired after-the-fact 
causes confusion about coverage for 
both employees and employers. The 
Department aims to eliminate such 
confusion by adding the proposed 
language. 

Proposed § 825.122(c)(1), (2) and (3) 

remain unchanged from current 
§ 825.113(c)(1), (2) and (3). 

A new § 825.122(d) has been added 
that defines ‘‘adoption.’’ The current 
regulations do not define the term, and 
the Department believes that providing 
such guidance will benefit both 
employees and employers. Language 
from current § 825.112(d) has been 
retained to clarify that the adoption 
source is not relevant to FMLA leave 
eligibility. 

Proposed § 825.122(e), titled ‘‘[f]oster 

care,’’ incorporates the definition of 
foster care from the current § 825.112(e) 
without change. 

Proposed § 825.122(f) addresses the 

documentation of relationships and 
incorporates the current language from 
§ 825.113(d) with two clarifications. 
First, the current regulation states that 
in addition to a child’s birth certificate 
or a court document, a simple statement 
from an employee is sufficient to 
establish a family relationship. The 
Department adds language in proposed 

paragraph (f) to clarify that the example 
of a statement by the employee as 
documentation should be a sworn, 
notarized statement. This provides 
consistency with the other examples 
used in the current regulations. Second, 
the Department proposes to add the 
example of a submitted and signed tax 
return as evidence of a qualified family 
relationship because in the case of an in 
loco parentis relationship, it may be 
difficult to determine what kind of proof 
may be reasonable to establish such a 
relationship. 
Section 825.123 (Unable to Perform the 
Functions of the Position) 

The Department proposes to 

renumber current § 825.115 as § 825.123 
in the proposed regulation due to other 
organizational changes made. Proposed 
paragraph (a), titled ‘‘[d]efinition,’’ 
defines the statutory requirement that 
an individual be unable to perform the 
functions of a job in order to qualify for 
FMLA leave. The current regulatory 
definition states that the employee must 
be ‘‘unable to work at all’’ or be unable 
to perform ‘‘one or more of the essential 
functions of the job.’’ The Department 
proposes no substantive changes to this 
definition. 

The Department proposes no 
substantive changes to current 
paragraph (b), now titled ‘‘[s]tatement of 
functions,’’ except to include language 
from current § 825.115 to clarify that the 
employer may provide a statement of 
the employee’s essential functions to the 
employee’s health care provider, and to 
clarify that the employer may require 
that the health care provider’s medical 
certification specify what functions the 
employee cannot perform. This 
information is part of the ‘‘medical 
facts’’ the statute states an employer 
may obtain as part of the medical 
certification. See 29 U.S.C. 
2613(b)(4)(B). 
Section 825.124 (Needed to Care for a 
Family Member) 

The current regulations define the 
phrase ‘‘needed to care for’’ a family 
member in § 825.116. The Department 
proposes to move this section to 
proposed § 825.124 and clarify that the 
employee need not be the only 
individual or family member available 
to care for the qualified family member. 
A number of comments received in 
response to the RFI recommended that 
the Department impose some sort of 
limitation on what it means for an 
employee to be ‘‘needed to care for’’ a 
family member. A number of 
commenters, including the National 
Council of Chain Restaurants suggested 
that ‘‘care’’ be limited to actual physical

care only. The National Council of 
Chain Restaurants also recommended 
that the employee be required to 
provide a written certification ‘‘that 
explains why the employee cannot rely 
upon other family members to care for’’ 
the qualifying family member. 
Similarly, the law firm of Blank Rome 
suggested that the regulations ‘‘be 
modified to allow for leave under these 
circumstances only when there is no 
other alternative care giver or provider.’’ 
The Pepsi Bottling Group recommended 
that employers be ‘‘able to deny or delay 
leave if an employee has a family 
member at home who is available to 
provide necessary medical care.’’ The 
United Parcel Service suggested 
‘‘add[ing] language requiring that 
requests for intermittent leave to care for 
a family member be supported by a 
representation that the employee is the 
only family member available to provide 
such care.’’ Finally, Manufacturers 
Alliance recommended the Department 
clarify that the term ‘‘needed to care’’ 
for a family member means ‘‘that it [is] 
necessary for the employee to actually 
be providing care during * * * work 
time.’’ 

After review of these comments, the 

Department has declined to adopt any of 
these proposals. The statute provides 
leave ‘‘[i]n order to care for the spouse, 
or a son, daughter, or parent, of the 
employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, 
or parent has a serious health 
condition.’’ 29 U.S.C. 2612(a)(1)(C). 
There is no additional limitation that 
the employee be the only available care 
giver in order to take FMLA leave. 
Indeed, it will often be the case that 
there are multiple potential care 
givers—none of whom is the only care 
giver without alternative—but all of 
whom would need to take FMLA leave 
in order to provide care. Moreover the 
legislative history to the Act indicates 
that the ‘‘phrase ‘to care for’ * * * be 
read broadly to include both physical 
and psychological care.’’ H.R. Rep. No. 
103–8, at 36 (1993); S. Rep. No. 103–3, 
at 24 (1993). The Department intends to 
retain the psychological care language 
and to make clear that employers cannot 
impose an additional requirement upon 
employees for FMLA leave purposes 
that the employee needs to be the only 
individual, or even family member, 
available to provide care to the qualified 
family member with a serious health 
condition. 
Section 825.125 (Definition of Health 
Care Provider) 

Current § 825.118 is renumbered as 

§ 825.125 in the proposed rule to reflect 
organizational changes. In its comments 
to the RFI, the American Academy of 

Physician Assistants noted that 
physician assistants (PAs) are usually 
recognized as authorized health care 
providers for FMLA purposes under the 
existing provision that recognizes ‘‘[a]ny 
health care provider from whom an 
employer or the employer’s group 
health plan’s benefits manager will 
accept certification of the existence of a 
serious health condition to substantiate 
a claim for benefits’’ (current 
§ 825.118(b)(4)). Other language in 
§ 825.118(c) of the current rule has 
created confusion over the status of PAs, 
however, where the phrase ‘‘authorized 
to practice in the State’’ is defined to 
mean that ‘‘the provider must be 
authorized to diagnose and treat 
physical or mental health conditions 
without supervision by a doctor or other 
health care provider.’’ The Department 
proposes to clarify the status of PAs as 
health care providers under proposed 
§ 825.125(b)(2) (formerly § 825.118(b)(2) 
in the current rule) by adding 
‘‘physician assistants’’ to the list of 
recognized health care providers and by 
deleting the requirement that PAs 
operate ‘‘without supervision by a 
doctor or other health care provider.’’ 
The Department has made 
corresponding changes to proposed 
§ 825.115 (Continuing treatment) and 
§ 825.800 (Definitions) to reflect this 
change that PAs would now generally 
be considered health care providers. 
Section 825.200 (Amount of Leave) 

This section explains the basic leave 
entitlement provided under the Act, as 
well as how to determine the 12-month 
period during which the FMLA leave 
entitlement may be used. The 
Department asked in its December 2006 
RFI whether ‘‘scheduled holidays 
[should] count against an employee’s 12 
weeks of FMLA leave when the 
employee is out for a full week as they 
do now?’’ (71 FR at 69509) The 
Department heard from all sides on this 
issue. The Unum Group stated, 
‘‘Changing this process could add 
difficulty to the already complex 
method of calculating FMLA leave 
entitlements.’’ The Pennsylvania 
Turnpike Commission agreed: ‘‘We feel 
that scheduled holidays should 
continue to count against the 12 weeks 
of FMLA. That block of time is covered 
in the employee request—it is incidental 
that they would not have had to work 
due to a holiday. Because of differing 
holiday eligibility for different 
employee groups (i.e. mgmt/union), it 
would greatly complicate the 
calculation of eligible days if holidays 
were excluded. It would be more time 
consuming for an FMLA administrator 
to calculate the amount of time/days an

employee [would] be off under FMLA if 
they had to make sure to subtract any 
holidays that the employee is eligible 
for during the time period they need to 
be off.’’ The State of Ohio said it 
‘‘supports the current regulations in this 
area, and believes that scheduled 
holidays should continue to be counted 
against an employee’s 12 weeks of 
FMLA leave when the employee is out 
a full week. This provision would allow 
employee’s 12 weeks of FMLA leave to 
be treated consistently with employees 
participating in other Ohio benefit 
programs.’’ The National Partnership for 
Women & Families disagreed: ‘‘Under 
the current regulations, such holidays 
are counted as part of an employee’s 
FMLA leave. We believe such a policy 
is inconsistent with how holidays are 
typically treated in other leave contexts. 
If an employee is out on FMLA leave 
and a scheduled holiday occurs, we 
believe the employee should be able to 
use holiday leave just like other 
employees rather than losing a day of 
FMLA leave. Thus, we would urge DOL 
to modify the regulations accordingly.’’ 

A number of commenters noted a 
serious problem that would occur if 
holidays were not counted toward 
FMLA leave when an employee is out 
on a weekly block of leave; that is, such 
a rule could result in the employee 
obtaining greater than 12 weeks of 
FMLA leave per year. One commenter 
stated: ‘‘For some employees counting 
holidays or days not worked during a 
full week of absence, may mean 
employees could be gone beyond the 12 
weeks/60 days if it is determined that 
non-work days or holidays are not 
counted as part of the work week thus 
pro-longing an FMLA beyond the 60 
days/12 weeks[.]’’ The United Parcel 
Service concurred: ‘‘DOL should 
maintain its current position that 
holidays occurring during an 
employee’s scheduled work-week count 
against the 12 weeks of leave. That 
position is supported by the plain 
language of the FMLA, which provides 
for 12 weeks of unpaid leave, not 12 
weeks of leave plus all holidays falling 
therein.’’ The Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania noted, ‘‘Because the law 
references the absence period in terms 
of weeks, rather than days, and 
considers calendar days rather than 
work days, the practice of counting 
holidays seems to be within the spirit of 
the Act and regulations.’’ 

Upon review of the comments 

received to the record, the Department 
believes it may lack the authority to 
change this regulation to not count 
against the FMLA entitlement holidays 
that fall within weeks-long blocks of 
FMLA leave. The statute grants

employees ‘‘12 workweeks of leave’’ 
which the Department has interpreted to 
mean 12 weeks of the employee’s 
normal work schedule. See 60 FR at 
2203. (‘‘The statute uses the ‘workweek’ 
as the basis for the leave entitlement, 
and an employee’s normal ‘workweek’ 
prior to the start of the FMLA leave is 
the controlling factor for determining 
how much leave an employee uses 
when switching to a reduced leave 
schedule.’’) Holidays regularly occur 
during normal workweeks. Discounting 
the holidays that regularly fall within 
those weekly blocks of leave could well 
impermissibly extend an employee’s 
leave period beyond the statutory 12 
normal workweeks of leave that the Act 
permits. Moreover, the current rule is 
clear and apparently working well. See, 
e.g., Mellen v. Trustees of Boston 
University, 504 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 
2007) (‘‘[The Department’s regulations 
governing] [w]hether holidays are to be 
counted against intermittent leave taken 
in an interval of a week or more * * * 
fit together naturally.’’). 

However, consistent with the 

discussion regarding § 825.205 below, 
when an employee is taking leave in 
increments of less than one week, the 
pertinent question for both overtime and 
holidays is whether the employee is 
required to be at work. If an employee 
is not required to be at work because of 
a holiday on the day he or she requested 
leave, then no leave would be charged 
to the employee’s FMLA entitlement. 
Thus, the Department proposes 
language in § 825.200(f) to clarify that, 
if an employee needs less than a full 
week of FMLA leave, and a holiday falls 
within the partial week of leave, the 
hours that the employee does not work 
on the holiday cannot be counted 
against the employee’s FMLA leave 
entitlement if the employee would not 
otherwise have been required to report 
for work on that day. If an employee 
needs a full week of leave in a week 
with a holiday, however, the hours the 
employee does not work on the holiday 
will count against the employee’s FMLA 
entitlement. Accordingly, for an 
employee with a Monday through 
Friday work week schedule, in a week 
with a Friday holiday on which the 
employee would not normally be 
required to report, if the employee 
needs FMLA leave only for Wednesday 
through Friday, the employee would use 
only 2/5 of a week of FMLA leave 
because the employee is not required to 
report for work on the holiday. 
However, if the same employee needed 
FMLA leave for Monday through Friday 
of that week, the employee would use 
a full week of FMLA leave despite not 

being required to report to work on the 
Friday holiday. 
Section 825.201 (Leave To Care for a 
Parent) 

Current § 825.201 on leave for the 

birth or placement for adoption or foster 
care of a child has been incorporated 
into proposed §§ 825.120 and 825.121 
discussed above. The current § 825.202 
addresses how much leave a husband 
and wife may take if they are employed 
by the same employer, in situations 
where an employee wants to be with a 
healthy child following a birth or 
placement for adoption or foster care, or 
to care for a parent with a serious health 
condition. The portions of current 
§ 825.202 pertaining to leave for birth or 
placement of a child have been moved 
to proposed §§ 825.120 and 825.121, 
respectively. The remainder of the 
section has been renumbered as 
§ 825.201. Consistent with the current 
regulatory provisions, proposed 
§ 825.201 now highlights when leave 
can be taken to care for a parent, as well 
as the statutory limitations on taking 
such leave when a husband and wife 
work for the same employer. 
Section 825.202 (Intermittent Leave or 
Reduced Leave Schedule) 

Current § 825.203 explains that FMLA 

leave can be taken in blocks or on an 
intermittent or reduced leave schedule 
basis. Current paragraph (a) of this 
section explains that FMLA leave can be 
taken intermittently or on a reduced 
leave schedule due to a qualifying 
reason, and defines what constitutes 
intermittent and reduced schedule 
leave. Current paragraph (b) explains 
that leave taken after the birth or 
placement for adoption or foster care of 
a healthy child may only be used 
intermittently or on a reduced leave 
schedule with the employer’s 
agreement. Current paragraph (c) 
explains that leave may be taken on an 
intermittent or reduced leave schedule 
when medically necessary for planned 
and/or unanticipated medical treatment 
of a related serious health condition or 
for recovery therefrom, and to provide 
care or psychological comfort to an 
immediate family member with a 
serious health condition. Current 
paragraph (d) explains what limitations 
exist with regard to tracking increments 
of intermittent leave and states that 
employers may limit leave increments 
to the shortest period of time that the 
employer’s payroll system uses to 
account for absences or use of leave, 
provided it is one hour or less. 

This section has been renumbered as 

proposed § 825.202 for purposes of 
organization. Current paragraph (a) from 

§ 825.203 is proposed to be titled 
‘‘[d]efinition,’’ but no other changes are 
proposed. 

Language from current paragraph (b) 

of § 825.203 governing the use of 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave 
after the birth, adoption, or foster care 
placement of a child has been moved to 
proposed paragraph (c), titled ‘‘[b]irth or 
placement,’’ in proposed § 825.202, 
which also cross-references the birth 
and adoption/foster care placement 
sections in proposed §§ 825.120 and 
825.121. 

Proposed paragraph (b) now defines 
‘‘medical necessity’’ and is so titled. It 
combines existing language from current 
§ 825.117 and illustrations from current 
§ 825.203(c). A cross-reference to 
proposed § 825.306 also is proposed in 
paragraph (b), which explains what 
constitutes sufficient information on the 
medical certification form. 

Current paragraph (d), which explains 
how to count increments of leave taken, 
has been moved to proposed § 825.205, 
to be explained below. 
Section 825.203 (Scheduling of 
Intermittent or Reduced Schedule 
Leave) 

Current § 825.117 discusses an 
employee’s statutory obligation to 
schedule foreseeable intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave for planned 
medical treatment so as to not unduly 
disrupt an employer’s operations. See 
29 U.S.C. 2612(e)(2). The Department 
proposes to move this discussion to 
proposed § 825.203 for organizational 
purposes. The statute does not limit this 
obligation to intermittent or reduced 
schedule leave, but rather applies it to 
all foreseeable leave for planned 
medical treatment. Proposed 
§ 825.302(e) (addressing employee 
notice requirements for foreseeable 
leave) sets forth the requirement as to 
any foreseeable leave for planned 
medical treatment. 

Proposed § 825.203 clarifies that an 
employee who takes intermittent leave 
when medically necessary has a 
statutory obligation to make a 
‘‘reasonable effort’’ as opposed to an 
‘‘attempt’’ to schedule leave so as not to 
disrupt unduly the employer’s 
operations. 

The preamble accompanying current 

§ 825.203 also discussed whether 
overtime hours not worked may be 
counted against an employee’s FMLA 
entitlement. See 60 FR at 2202. This 
issue is discussed in the preamble 
below concerning proposed changes to 
§ 825.205, which addresses how to 
determine the amount of leave used.

Section 825.204 (Transfer of an 
Employee to an Alternative Position 
During Intermittent Leave or Reduced 
Schedule Leave) 

Current § 825.204 explains when an 
employer may transfer an employee to 
an alternative position in order to 
accommodate intermittent leave or a 
reduced leave schedule. The 
Department proposes no substantive 
changes to this section, but proposes to 
add subheadings for clarity. 
Specifically, proposed paragraph (a) is 
titled ‘‘transfer or reassignment,’’ 
proposed paragraph (b) is titled 
‘‘compliance,’’ proposed paragraph (c) is 
titled ‘‘equivalent pay and benefits,’’ 
proposed paragraph (d) is titled 
‘‘employer limitations,’’ and proposed 
paragraph (e) is titled ‘‘reinstatement of 
employee.’’ Other than editorial 
changes, the Department proposes no 
other changes to this section. The 
Department asked no questions about 
transfer in its RFI but received a number 
of comments criticizing the current 
regulations particularly as regards 
employees who have a recurring need 
for unscheduled intermittent leave. The 
full range of comments is discussed in 
Chapter VIII of the Report on the RFI 
comments (see 72 FR at 35608). Some 
commenters saw no basis to 
differentiate between foreseeable and 
unforeseeable need for leave in the 
context of this provision. ‘‘We do not 
see any basis for distinguishing between 
foreseeable vs. unforeseeable leaves for 
purposes of such temporary transfers.’’ 
See comments by United Parcel Service, 
Inc. Similarly, The Southern Company 
stated: 

[Section 825.204 provides n]o similar 

option * * * for employers to transfer or 
otherwise alter the duties of an employee 
who needs unscheduled or unforeseeable 
intermittent leave. Even if the employee’s 
unscheduled intermittent absences may 
result in substantial safety risks to the public 
or co-employees, or could cause serious 
disruption to the operations of the employer, 
such employee’s duties or position cannot be 
altered as a result of the unscheduled 
intermittent leave. 

The Edison Electric Institute echoed the 
same concern that under the current 
regulatory scheme ‘‘[e]mployers do not 
have [the option] to transfer or 
otherwise alter the duties of an 
employee who needs unscheduled or 
unforeseeable intermittent leave.’’ The 
Department requests further comments 
on whether this regulatory provision 
should be changed and if so how.

Section 825.205 (Increments of Leave for 
Intermittent or Reduced Schedule 
Leave) 

Current § 825.205 explains how to 
determine the amount of leave used 
when an employee takes intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave. Current 
paragraph (a) makes clear that ‘‘only the 
amount of leave actually taken may be 
counted toward the 12 weeks of leave’’ 
to which an employee is entitled. 
Current paragraph (b) explains how to 
calculate the use of intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave when an 
employee works part-time or variable 
hours. Current paragraph (c) explains 
how to calculate leave when an 
employee’s permanent schedule 
changes and current paragraph (d) 
explains how to calculate leave when an 
employee’s schedule varies from week 
to week. 

The Department proposes to add 
language from current § 825.203(d), 
which explains how to count 
increments of intermittent FMLA leave, 
to paragraph (a) of this section, titled 
‘‘Minimum increment.’’ Current 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of § 825.205 
have been renumbered as 
§ 825.205(b)(1), (2), and (3) for purposes 
of clarity, but no changes have been 
made to the text of those sections. 
Paragraph (b) is proposed to be titled 
‘‘[c]alculation of leave.’’ 

The Department received comments 
expressing concerns about the size of 
increments of intermittent leave that 
may be taken. No issue received more 
substantive commentary to the RFI than 
employee use of unscheduled 
intermittent leave. Employers identified 
a number of problems with current 
§ 825.203(d), which permits FMLA 
leave to be taken in increments as small 
as the employer’s payroll system will 
capture. These difficulties include basic 
administrative problems. Several 
commenters, including a supervisor at 
International Auto Processing, noted 
that their payroll systems capture time 
down to one minute, ‘‘Since our clocks 
track time to the minute, I find myself 
spending an unusual amount of time 
determining how many hours and 
minutes the employee has used by using 
his weekly time sheet. * * * This is a 
nightmare and I sometimes feel like the 
only thing I accomplish during the day 
is tracking intermittent leave.’’ Second, 
employers also stated that the current 
rule does not allow them to adequately 
staff their businesses, as it is very 
difficult to find replacement employees 
to cover absences that are less than one 
half-day. The Detroit Medical Center 
commented that, ‘‘Scheduling of 
sufficient staff is regularly 

compromised, negatively affecting the 
quality of service or, in hospital settings, 
actual patient care because of 
unscheduled intermittent leave.’’ Third, 
as documented in the Department’s 
2007 Report on the RFI comments, 
‘‘intermittent FMLA leave can have 
significant impacts on time-sensitive 
business models. In many situations, the 
absence of just a few employees can 
have a significant impact.’’ 72 FR at 
35632; see generally 72 FR 35632–35638 
(discussing impacts of unscheduled 
intermittent leave on certain time- 
sensitive industries). For example, the 
City of New York stated that when its 
911 operators do not show up for work 
due to a chronic FMLA condition, the 
remaining employees must work longer 
to maintain appropriate staffing and 
response levels: ‘‘The number of 
overtime hours being worked leads to 
overtired people making critical life and 
death decisions in an emergency driven 
environment.’’ As a result of all these 
factors, many employers suggested the 
Department allow employers to require 
that intermittent leave be taken in 
greater increments (e.g., two or four 
hour blocks or one day or one week 
blocks). 

Conversely, a number of commenters 
defended the current rule on minimum 
increments of leave. The Legal Aid 
Society’s Employment Law Center asked 
the Department to ‘‘please be mindful of 
the employee who, in an ideal world, 
would not suffer from such devastating 
illnesses that wreck havoc on their own 
lives. Employees, too, struggle with 
chronic and episodic illnesses. The 
FMLA was specifically designed to 
provide leave in these instances.’’ The 
National Partnership for Women & 
Families noted its strong support for the 
current regulations and specifically 
urged the Department to resist making 
any changes in the minimum increment 
of leave that an employee could take: 
‘‘Intermittent leave was designed to help 
employers by ensuring that workers are 
not absent any longer than necessary. 
While some employers now argue for 
half-day increments of intermittent 
leave, enforcing a four-hour leave 
requirement would mean forcing 
employees to miss more work than 
necessary, which is contrary to the 
statute and harmful to both employees 
and employers.’’ The organization 9to5, 
National Association of Working 
Women also stated it ‘‘opposes any 
regulatory change that would impose 
additional obstacles or requirements on 
workers seeking to utilize intermittent 
FMLA leave. Currently, workers may 
take just the time needed for treatments, 
minimizing their own loss of pay and

the strain on employers and co- 
workers.’’ 

The Department understands the 
burdens imposed on employers by 
employees using unscheduled 
intermittent leave as demonstrated by 
the comments received in response to 
the RFI. At the same time, the 
Department is aware of the importance 
of such leave to employees with serious 
health conditions. The Department is 
not proposing to increase the minimum 
increment of intermittent leave at this 
time. 

The Department also seeks comment 

as to whether, in situations in which 
physical impossibility prevents an 
employee using intermittent leave or 
working a reduced leave schedule from 
commencing work mid-way through a 
shift, an exception should be made to 
allow the entire shift to be designated as 
FMLA leave and counted against the 
employee’s FMLA entitlement. For 
example, if a railroad conductor is 
required to conduct a train from one 
point to another, the employee cannot 
begin or stop work in the middle of the 
trip. Similarly, an employee who works 
in a lab sealed at the start of the day 
cannot enter the lab later or the work 
performed would be lost. The 
Department has addressed this scenario 
in prior guidance. See Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA–42 (Aug. 23, 
1994). In that 1994 Opinion Letter, the 
Department stated that when a flight 
attendant needed only three hours of 
intermittent leave to care for her sick 
mother every Friday, preventing her 
from working a Friday flight assignment 
during a two month period, only the 
three hours of leave needed each week 
could be charged to FMLA, and the 
remainder of the time may be charged 
to some other form of paid or unpaid 
leave. Upon further review, the 
Department questions whether such an 
interpretation is appropriate. While the 
Department’s interpretation allows 
employees to preserve their FMLA 
entitlement, it may expose them to 
disciplinary action based on the 
additional hours of unprotected leave 
that they must take. The Department 
seeks comment on whether it is more 
appropriate to extend FMLA protection 
to the entire period of leave taken from 
the employee’s assigned schedule in 
this situation. 

A number of commenters to the 

record addressed this phenomenon. 
Southwest Airlines stated, ‘‘When 
* * * employees are absent, flights do 
not take off without another employee 
taking their place.’’ Therefore, even a 
few minutes of FMLA leave can result 
in the employee missing an entire flight. 
Similarly, the Air Transport Association 

of America, Inc. and the Airline 
Industrial Relations Conference 
commented, 

In this industry, a six-minute absence can 
result in a flight attendant avoiding a three- 
day trip to which she or he was assigned. 
Most airlines ‘‘bank’’ flights or schedule 
multiple flights to arrive and depart in a 
concentrated time frame, followed by a 
relative lull in activity. An employee could 
use intermittent FMLA leave to miss the 
heavy flight bank, causing the carrier to 
either operate short-handed or to call in a 
replacement worker who likely must be paid 
a shift premium, then come in to work the 
rest of the shift during which no flights may 
arrive or depart, leaving the carrier now over- 
staffed. 

The Regional Transportation District 

in Denver, Colorado commented that 
‘‘due to the particular needs of the 
industry, [there is] difficulty scheduling 
intermittent leave for bus and light rail 
operators, particularly if the operator 
must be relieved in the middle of the 
run. [We] would like clear guidance on 
the limitations it can place on an 
operator to avoid scheduling 
intermittent leave during a run.’’ This 
situation is also prevalent in the rail 
industry. The Association of American 
Railroads commented, 

Railroads typically establish ‘‘pools’’ (and 

‘‘extra boards’’) comprised of train service 
employees who report to duty when called 
by the employer, based on train operations. 
When called in, the worker leaves on the 
train and must be gone for the entire trip; 
given the nature of the work, the worker 
cannot work a ‘‘reduced schedule leave’’ or 
intermittently for less than the entire trip. If 
the employee cannot work the entire trip, he 
or she must miss the entire trip no matter 
how much FMLA leave the worker needs. 

Instead of proposing specific 
language, the Department seeks 
comment from the public on this issue 
and what if any language should be 
included in the final rule to address 
these situations within the statutory 
requirements. 

The Department also wishes to clarify 

the application of FMLA leave to 
overtime hours. An employee may be 
limited to working eight hours per day 
or 40 hours per week due to a serious 
health condition and, under FMLA, has 
the right not to work overtime hours 
without being subject to any discipline. 
It is a reduced leave schedule. 
Employers continue to have questions, 
however, as to whether and how the 
overtime hours not worked due to the 
serious health condition may be 
counted against the employee’s FMLA 
entitlement. The preamble 
accompanying current § 825.203 stated 
that whether overtime hours not worked 
can be counted against the employee’s 
FMLA entitlement is determined by 

whether the employee would be 
required to use some form of leave to 
cover those hours in a non-FMLA 
situation. (60 FR at 2202) The preamble 
also distinguished between mandatory 
overtime, voluntary overtime, and 
overtime on an ‘‘as needed’’ basis. The 
Department’s enforcement experience 
and responses to the RFI lead us to 
believe that the distinction between 
these three types of overtime, and the 
focus on whether leave would normally 
need to be used to cover the hours not 
worked, has caused confusion. See 
Wage and Hour Opinion Letter FMLA– 
107 (July 19, 1999) (‘‘If overtime hours 
are on an ‘as needed’ basis and are not 
part of the employee’s usual or normal 
workweek, or is voluntary, such hours 
would neither be counted to calculate 
the amount of the employee’s FMLA 
leave entitlement nor charged to the 
employee’s FMLA leave entitlement.’’) 
(emphasis in original). The confusion 
has been compounded by language in 
the preamble discussing § 825.205 of the 
current rule, which states ‘‘[a]n 
employee’s FMLA leave entitlement 
may only be reduced for time which the 
employee would otherwise be required 
to report for duty, but for the taking of 
the leave.’’ (60 FR at 2203) 

The Department recognizes that 
overtime by its nature is generally 
assigned on an as needed basis, and the 
fact that it is assigned as needed has no 
bearing on whether the employee has 
volunteered to work or is being required 
to work the additional hours. The 
Department believes the correct focus 
should be not on whether the employee 
would normally be required to use leave 
to cover the overtime hours, but on 
whether the employee would otherwise 
be required to report for duty but for the 
taking of FMLA leave. If the employee 
would be required to work the overtime 
hours were it not for being entitled to 
FMLA leave, then the hours the 
employee would have been required to 
(but did not) work may be counted 
against the employee’s FMLA 
entitlement. Where, in such a case, the 
employee works a part-time or reduced 
leave schedule, the employee’s leave 
usage in any given week is 
proportionate to the employee’s 
scheduled hours in the week in which 
the leave is used. For example, if an 
employee has a certified serious health 
condition limiting the employee’s work 
hours to 40 per week and that employee 
is scheduled for 48 hours in a week, the 
employee would take 8 hours of FMLA 
protected leave that week. This 
translates into 8/48ths or 1/6th of a 
week of FMLA leave. For ease of 
tracking, an employer may convert these

fractions to their hourly equivalent so 
long as the conversion equitably reflects 
the employee’s total normally scheduled 
hours. 

Where the employee’s schedule so 

varies from week to week such that no 
‘‘normal’’ schedule or pattern can be 
discerned, a weekly average of the hours 
worked for the 12 weeks prior to the 
start of the FMLA leave is used to 
calculate the employee’s normal 
workweek as in proposed 
§ 825.205(b)(3) (current § 825.205(d)). In 
all instances, the employer must select 
employees for mandatory overtime in a 
manner that does not discriminate 
against workers who need to use FMLA 
leave (see § 825.220). The Department is 
not proposing any regulatory changes 
related to the overtime issue, which is 
not addressed in the text of the current 
regulations and is discussed only in the 
1995 preamble to the current rule (see 
60 FR at 2202). 
Section 825.207 (Substitution of Paid 
Leave) 

Current § 825.207 addresses the 

interaction between unpaid FMLA leave 
and employer provided paid leave. 
Current paragraph (a) repeats the 
statutory language that paid leave may 
be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave. 
Current paragraph (b) addresses 
substitution of accrued paid vacation, 
personal, or family leave for unpaid 
FMLA family leave for the birth or 
placement of a child for adoption or 
foster care or to care for a spouse, child 
or parent with a serious health 
condition. Current paragraph (c) 
addresses when accrued paid vacation, 
personal, or medical/sick leave can run 
concurrently with the employee’s 
unpaid FMLA leave for the employee’s 
own serious health condition or when 
the employee is needed to care for a 
spouse, child or parent with a serious 
health condition. Current paragraph (d) 
addresses the interaction between a 
disability plan and unpaid FMLA leave, 
as well as the interaction of unpaid 
FMLA leave with a workers’ 
compensation absence. Current 
paragraph (e) addresses the use of paid 
vacation or personal leave when taking 
FMLA leave. Current paragraph (f) 
confirms that if paid leave is not 
substituted at the option of the 
employer or the employee, the 
employee remains entitled to all 
accrued paid leave. Current paragraph 
(g) explains that paid leave used for 
purposes not covered by the FMLA 
cannot count against the employee’s 
FMLA entitlement. Current paragraph 
(h) states that an employer cannot apply 
the FMLA requirements if paid leave is 
substituted and the employer’s paid

leave program applies less stringent 
procedural standards for taking leave 
than the FMLA. Current paragraph (i) 
addresses the interaction between the 
use of compensatory time off in the 
public sector and the use of FMLA 
leave. 

The Department’s enforcement 

experience and responses to the RFI 
lead us to believe that current § 825.207 
may be confusing to employees and 
employers. For example, the differing 
treatment of ‘‘medical leave,’’ ‘‘family 
leave,’’ ‘‘sick leave,’’ and ‘‘vacation 
leave’’ makes it difficult both for 
employers to administer these 
provisions and for employees to know 
what their rights and obligations are in 
substituting paid leave for unpaid 
FMLA leave. Additionally, both 
employees and employers have 
expressed confusion as to the 
application of the employer’s normal 
leave rules when paid leave is 
substituted for unpaid FMLA leave. 

In response to the RFI, many 

employees and employee advocacy 
groups commented that the ability to 
substitute paid leave for any portion of 
an otherwise unpaid FMLA leave in 
many cases was essential to the 
employee’s ability to take leave at all. 
Several employers and employer 
groups, however, commented that the 
substitution provisions of the 
regulations require that employees 
seeking to use accrued paid leave 
concurrently with FMLA leave be 
treated more favorably than those who 
use paid leave for other reasons. Still 
other employers stated that the various 
rules for substituting different types of 
paid leave have added to the costs of 
administering FMLA leave and 
discouraged the employers from 
adopting or retaining leave policies that 
are more generous than required by the 
FMLA. 

Section 102(d)(2) of the FMLA 

governs the substitution of paid leave 
for unpaid FMLA leave. 29 U.S.C. 
2612(d)(2). Paragraph (A) of that section 
of the statute addresses substitution of 
‘‘accrued paid vacation leave, personal 
leave, or family leave’’ for unpaid FMLA 
leave for the birth or placement of a 
child, or to care for a covered family 
member. Paragraph (B) of that section 
addresses substitution of ‘‘accrued paid 
vacation leave, personal leave, or 
medical or sick leave’’ for unpaid FMLA 
leave to care for a covered family 
member or for the employee’s own 
serious health condition. Language in 
paragraph (B) clarifies that the FMLA 
does not require employers to provide 
paid sick or medical leave in any 
situation in which they would not 
normally do so. 

In the current regulations, the 

Department interpreted the clarifying 
clause regarding paid sick and medical 
leave in section 102(d)(2)(B) of the Act 
as indicating congressional intent to 
allow employers to enforce their normal 
rules regarding the use of paid medical 
and sick leave when such leave was 
substituted for unpaid FMLA leave. The 
Department further interpreted the lack 
of a similar clarifying clause in 
paragraph (A) of that section of the 
statute to indicate that employers were 
not permitted to enforce normal rules 
regarding the use of paid vacation leave 
or personal leave when such leave was 
substituted for unpaid FMLA leave. See 
preamble to current FMLA rule, 60 FR 
at 2205 (‘‘There are no limitations, 
however, on the employee’s right to 
elect to substitute accrued paid vacation 
or personal leave for qualifying FMLA 
leave, and the employer may not limit 
the timing during the year in which 
paid vacation may be substituted for 
FMLA-qualifying absences or impose 
other limitations.’’). 

The Department’s interpretation of the 
substitution of paid leave provision has 
evolved over time, as has been reflected 
in the Department’s opinion letters on 
the subject. For example, while the 
preamble to the current regulations 
specifically stated that employers could 
not restrict the time during the year in 
which an employee could substitute 
paid vacation leave for unpaid FMLA 
leave, the Department has clarified in 
Opinion Letter FMLA–75 that where 
vacation leave was accrued pursuant to 
a generally applied restriction on when 
it could be used, an employee did not 
have the right to substitute vacation 
leave for unpaid FMLA leave at any 
other time. Wage and Hour Opinion 
Letter FMLA–75 (Nov. 14, 1995) 
(‘‘[W]here an employee may only use 
leave under the employer’s plan during 
a specified period when the plant is 
shut down, the employee has not fully 
vested in the right to substitute that 
leave for purposes of FMLA.’’). In two 
other opinion letters on the substitution 
of paid vacation leave, the Department 
has recognized that both an employee’s 
right to use paid leave and an 
employer’s right to require substitution 
are subject to the policies pursuant to 
which the leave was accrued. See Wage 
and Hour Opinion Letter FMLA–81 
(June 18, 1996) (‘‘[T]he Department 
interprets these provisions to mean that 
the employee has both earned the 
[vacation] leave and is able to use that 
leave during the FMLA leave period.’’); 
Wage and Hour Opinion Letter FMLA– 
61 (May 12, 1995) (‘‘The Department 
interprets these provisions to mean that

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

the employee has both earned the leave 
and is able to use that leave during the 
FMLA period. * * * [I]n the particular 
situation that you describe, the 
employer could not require the 
employee to substitute [vacation] leave 
that is not yet available to the employee 
to use under the terms of the employer’s 
leave plan.’’). 

On further consideration, the 

Department now believes that the better 
interpretation of paragraph (B) of 
section 102(d)(2) of the Act is that it 
simply clarifies the limits on the 
employer’s obligation to allow the 
substitution of paid sick or medical 
leave. For example, it clarifies that an 
employer is not obligated to allow an 
employee to substitute paid sick leave 
for unpaid FMLA leave when the 
employee is caring for a child with a 
serious health condition if the 
employer’s normal sick leave rules 
allow such paid leave to be used only 
for the employee’s own illness. 
However, as the language in both 
sections of the statute makes clear, in all 
cases the substitution of paid leave 
pursuant to section 102(d)(2) of the Act 
is limited to the substitution of accrued 
paid leave. See FMLA’s legislative 
history: ‘‘Section 102(d) assures that an 
employee is entitled to the benefits of 
applicable paid leave, plus any 
remaining leave time made available by 
the act on an unpaid basis.’’ H.R. Rep. 
No. 103–8, Pt. 1, at 38 (1993); see also 
S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 27–28 (1993). 

Additionally, as several commenters 

to the RFI noted, by prohibiting 
employers from applying their normal 
leave policies to employees substituting 
paid vacation and personal leave for 
unpaid FMLA leave, the current 
regulations may have provided an 
incentive to employers to scale back on 
their provision of vacation and personal 
leave because they are unable to control 
its usage. Moreover, as other 
commenters pointed out, by allowing 
employees to substitute such paid leave 
for unpaid FMLA leave without meeting 
their employer’s normal leave rules, the 
regulations have placed employees 
using FMLA leave in a more favored 
position regarding the use of employer 
provided paid leave than their 
coworkers taking vacation or personal 
leave for non-FMLA reasons. 

The Department agrees that an 

unintended consequence of the current 
regulations on substitution has been to 
create tension with the plain language of 
the FMLA, which states that nothing in 
the Act or any other amendments made 
by it shall be construed to discourage 
employers from adopting or retaining 
leave policies more generous than any 
policies that comply with the 

requirements under the Act or any 
amendment made by it. See 29 U.S.C. 
2653. Additionally, while the FMLA 
prohibits discrimination against FMLA 
leave users, there is nothing in the Act 
that requires employers to treat FMLA 
users more favorably than other 
employees with regard to the provision 
of paid leave. Furthermore, while the 
Act’s protections prohibit an employee 
from losing any accrued benefits as a 
result of taking FMLA leave, nothing in 
that section entitles an FMLA leave- 
taker to any right or benefit other than 
that to which the employee would have 
been entitled had the employee not 
taken the leave. See 29 U.S.C. 2614(a)(2) 
and (3). 

To more consistently apply these 

principles, the Department proposes to 
combine current paragraphs (a), (b), and 
(c) of § 825.207 into one paragraph (a), 
which now clearly states that the terms 
and conditions of an employer’s paid 
leave policies apply and must be 
followed by the employee in order to 
substitute any form of accrued paid 
leave—including, for example, paid 
vacation, personal leave, family leave, 
‘‘paid time off’’ (PTO), or sick leave. 
Additionally, the Department proposes 
to clarify what is meant in § 825.207 by 
the term ‘‘substitution,’’ which normally 
means replacing one thing with another, 
but does not comfortably bear that 
meaning in the context of the FMLA. 
Thus, the Department proposes to add 
language clarifying that for FMLA 
purposes ‘‘substitution’’ means that the 
unpaid FMLA leave and the paid leave 
provided by an employer run 
concurrently. This is standard practice 
under the current regulations and is not 
a change in enforcement policy. 

Just as employees do not have the 
right to use leave which has not yet 
accrued, an employee’s ability to use 
accrued leave is also limited by the 
leave policies pursuant to which the 
‘‘applicable’’ leave is accrued (i.e., 
available for use pursuant to the non- 
discriminatory terms and conditions of 
the employer’s policy). Therefore, for 
example, if an employer’s paid vacation 
leave policy prohibits the use of 
vacation leave in less than full day 
increments, employees would have no 
right to use less than a full day of 
vacation leave regardless of whether the 
vacation leave was being substituted for 
unpaid FMLA leave. Similarly, if an 
employer’s paid personal leave policy 
requires two days notice for the use of 
personal leave, an employee seeking to 
substitute personal leave for unpaid 
FMLA leave would need to meet the 
two-day notice requirement prior to 
receiving the paid personal leave. 
Employers, of course, have the right to

voluntarily waive the application of 
such restrictions on an employee’s use 
of paid leave, but they are not required 
by the FMLA to do so. 

The Department believes the 

proposed language on the substitution 
of paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave 
also is more consistent with the trend 
toward employers providing employees 
with ‘‘paid time off’’ (PTO) policies that 
do not distinguish the right to leave 
based on the reason (vacation versus 
illness) but instead give employees a 
pool of leave to use for whatever reason 
they choose. PTO plans generally allow 
employees to take paid leave for any 
reason as long as the employer’s 
procedures are satisfied. Under the 
current FMLA regulations, such PTO 
policies were treated the same as paid 
vacation or personal leave and 
employers were therefore not allowed to 
apply their normal leave rules to the 
substitution of such leave for unpaid 
FMLA leave. As several commenters to 
the RFI noted, this interpretation 
prohibited an employer who chose to 
use a PTO leave plan from applying its 
existing policies for taking leave when 
the leave was being used for sick or 
family leave purposes. 

In addition to the language proposed 
in this section as described above, the 
Department also believes certain 
safeguards for employees are necessary. 
Therefore, the Department also proposes 
to add language clarifying that, when 
providing notice of eligibility for FMLA 
leave to an employee pursuant to 
proposed § 825.300, an employer must 
make the employee aware of any 
additional requirements for the use of 
paid leave and must inform the 
employee that he/she remains entitled 
to unpaid FMLA leave even if he/she 
chooses not to meet the terms and 
conditions of the employer’s paid leave 
policies (such as using leave only in full 
day increments or completing a specific 
leave request form). The Department 
invites comment as to whether this 
proposal appropriately implements 
Congressional intent regarding 
substitution of paid leave. See 29 U.S.C. 
2612(d)(2). 

Language from current 

§ 825.207(d)(1), explaining that 
employers may apply more stringent 
requirements for receipt of disability 
payments, has been moved to new 
proposed § 825.306(c). The remaining 
language from current § 825.207(d)(1), 
making clear that substitution of paid 
leave does not apply where the 
employee is receiving paid disability 
leave, is retained in the proposed 
section. However, the Department also 
wishes to clarify that while the 
substitution provisions are not

applicable when an employee receives 
disability benefits while taking FMLA 
leave, if the employer and employee 
agree to have paid leave also run 
concurrently with FMLA leave to 
supplement disability benefits, such as 
in the case where an employee only 
receives two-thirds of his or her salary 
from the disability plan, such an 
agreement is permitted under FMLA to 
the degree that it is allowable under 
applicable State law. This is in keeping 
with the statutory mandate not to 
discourage more generous leave policies 
voluntarily provided by employers. 

The language from current 

§ 825.207(d)(2), addressing the 
interaction between workers’ 
compensation, light duty and the 
FMLA, has been moved to proposed 
§ 825.207(e). Additional discussion of 
light duty also can be found in 
§ 825.220(c) of the proposed rule as 
discussed below. Current § 825.207(e), 
which states that no limitations may be 
placed by the employer on substitution 
of paid vacation or personal leave, 
including leave earned or accrued under 
PTO plans, has been deleted in light of 
the discussion of paragraph (a) above. 
Current § 825.207(h), which states that 
when an employer’s procedural 
requirements for taking paid leave are 
less stringent than the requirements of 
the FMLA, employees cannot be 
required to comply with higher FMLA 
standards, has been deleted because it 
does not properly implement section 
103 of the FMLA, which states that 
employers may require sufficient FMLA 
certification in support of any request 
for FMLA leave for either the 
employee’s own serious health 
condition or a covered family member’s 
serious health condition. It also is in 
conflict with section 102(e) of the 
FMLA, which requires employees to 
provide 30 days notice for foreseeable 
leave whenever possible for the birth or 
placement of a child or for planned 
medical treatment. Current § 825.207(f) 
and (g) remain unchanged but have been 
redesignated as paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section. 

Finally, the Department proposes to 
revise current § 825.207(i) to allow the 
use of compensatory time accrued by 
public agency employees under the Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to run 
concurrently with unpaid FMLA leave 
when leave is taken for an FMLA- 
qualifying reason. Although the 
Department did not receive many 
comments dealing specifically with the 
issue of compensatory time in response 
to the RFI, those received indicate a 
general agreement that the substitution 
of compensatory time for otherwise 
unpaid FMLA would be beneficial both 

to the employee, by minimizing the 
financial impact of unpaid leave, and to 
the employer, by allowing the two 
benefits to run concurrently. 
Furthermore, the Department believes 
the proposed revision is consistent with 
the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in 
Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 
576 (2000), in which the Court found 
that public employers always have the 
right to cash out a public sector 
employee’s compensatory time or 
require the employee to use the time. 
Section 825.208 (Reserved) 

Current § 825.208 has been 

renumbered as proposed § 825.301, to 
be discussed below. The section is 
therefore reserved to avoid extensive 
renumbering of other sections. 
Section 825.210 (Employee Payment of 
Group Health Benefit Premiums) 

This section addresses an employee’s 

obligation to pay his or her share of 
group health plan premiums while on 
FMLA leave. The Department received 
few comments regarding this specific 
section in response to the RFI. Some 
commenters stated that it was difficult 
to obtain payment for an employee’s 
share of health benefit premiums during 
the period the employee is on FMLA 
leave. Employer representatives also 
expressed concern about their ability to 
recoup their portion of health insurance 
premiums when an employee decides 
not to return from FMLA leave. Other 
commenters requested that the 
Department clarify an employer’s 
responsibility to maintain health 
insurance coverage when an employee 
on FMLA leave fails to pay his or her 
portion of the premiums. 

The Department is proposing to revise 
paragraph (f) of this section by deleting 
the word ‘‘unpaid.’’ As noted in 
§ 825.207(e), an individual who is 
simultaneously taking FMLA leave and 
receiving payments as a result of a 
workers’ compensation injury is not on 
unpaid leave. No further changes are 
proposed for this section. For further 
discussion of an employer’s 
responsibility to maintain the health 
insurance coverage of an employee on 
FMLA leave, see proposed § 825.212 as 
discussed below. 
Section 825.212 (Employee Failure To 
Make Health Premium Payments) 

Current § 825.212 explains that an 

employer may terminate an employee’s 
health insurance coverage while the 
employee is on FMLA leave if the 
employee fails to pay the employee’s 
share of the premiums, the grace period 
has expired, and the employer provides 
sufficient notification to the employee. 

The Department received a number of 

comments regarding this section. For 
example, the Disability Management 
Employer Coalition requested that the 
Department better explain how 
employers should respond to an 
employee’s failure to pay his or her 
share of health insurance premiums 
while on FMLA leave. In particular, the 
Coalition stated that while many 
employers pay the employee’s share of 
health insurance premiums because of 
concerns regarding continuation of 
coverage, employers have concerns 
about the cost of doing so. Other 
commenters raised similar concerns, 
especially when individuals do not 
return to work after their FMLA leave 
has expired, and requested clarification 
regarding the timing of termination of 
an individual’s coverage for failure to 
make payment. 

The Department proposes to add 

language to current paragraph (c) of this 
section to make clear that if an employer 
allows an employee’s health insurance 
to lapse due to the employee’s failure to 
pay his or her share of the premium as 
set forth in the regulations, the 
employer still has a duty to reinstate the 
employee’s health insurance when the 
employee returns to work and can be 
liable for harm suffered by the employee 
if it fails to do so. Alternatives exist in 
most cases to terminating an employee’s 
health insurance when premium 
payments are not made. For instance, an 
employer could make payroll 
deductions to recoup such payments 
when an employee returns to work 
without violating the FMLA. To the 
extent recovery is allowed, the employer 
may recover the costs through 
deduction from any sums due to the 
employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation 
pay, profit sharing, etc.), provided such 
deductions do not otherwise violate 
applicable Federal or State wage 
payment or other laws. See § 825.213 of 
the current and proposed regulations. 
Section 825.213 (Employer Recovery of 
Benefit Costs) 

This section explains what process an 

employer must follow to recoup 
insurance premiums from an employee 
when the employee does not return 
from leave in certain circumstances. A 
few employer representatives responded 
to the Department’s RFI with concerns 
about this process, with some suggesting 
that employees on FMLA leave be 
provided coverage under the 
continuation coverage requirements of 
Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, as 
amended, 29 U.S.C. 1161–1168 
(COBRA). These commenters were 
particularly concerned that the current

7898 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

system requires that employers provide 
health insurance, and pay the majority 
of the premium, for individuals on 
FMLA leave who have no intention of 
returning to work once their leave 
entitlement expires. The Department 
understands these concerns, but cannot 
adopt the suggested change under 
current law. 

The Department proposes to move 
language from existing § 825.310(h), 
which deals with certification 
requirements when an employee fails to 
return to work due to the continuation, 
recurrence, or onset of a serious health 
condition, to this section, as it believes 
it is more appropriately placed here 
with other issues involving repayment 
of health premiums. This language 
states that the cost of the certification an 
employee must obtain to avoid the 
repayment of health insurance 
premiums when the employee does not 
return from leave must be borne by the 
employee, as well as any travel costs. 
Section 825.214 (Employee Right to 
Reinstatement) 

Current § 825.214 addresses an 

employee’s reinstatement rights upon 
returning to work. This section also 
makes clear that even if an employee is 
unable to return to work as a result of 
the serious health condition and would 
not have FMLA reinstatement rights, the 
employee may have rights under the 
ADA. 

In response to the Department’s RFI, 
employers expressed concern about the 
impact on their business operations of 
reinstating an individual to his or her 
same position. Many of these 
commenters were particularly 
concerned about the interplay between 
the use of intermittent leave by an 
employee and that employee’s right to 
reinstatement. These commenters 
argued that, in many cases, such 
individuals should not be entitled to job 
restoration under current § 825.214(b) 
because they are unable to perform an 
essential function of their position, such 
as to work overtime or meet regular and 
reliable attendance requirements. 
Commenters in certain industries, such 
as those where individuals are trained 
to work with particular consumers, and 
smaller employers stated that returning 
an individual to his or her same 
position can be difficult, even when the 
individual takes block leave. These 
employers often have to hire an 
individual to replace the employee 
taking FMLA leave, and are uncertain 
how to manage the employee’s return to 
work and their obligation to provide 
reinstatement. On the other hand, 
numerous employees stated that the 
ability to take FMLA leave, without

having to worry whether their job was 
secure, was critical to their being able to 
manage their own serious health 
condition or caregiving responsibilities. 
The National Partnership for Women & 
Families stated that the job restoration 
provisions of FMLA ‘‘promote[ ] greater 
workforce continuity and stability by 
helping employees retain their jobs 
when an emergency strikes.’’ 

The Department believes that this 

regulatory provision meets the intent of 
Congress in this area, by providing 
employees with job protection while 
allowing employers some flexibility to 
return the employee to the same or an 
equivalent position, and that no changes 
are appropriate under current law. 
The Department proposes minor 

clarifications along with organizational 
changes to this section. First, the 
Department proposes to add a heading 
titled ‘‘[g]eneral rule,’’ emphasizing that 
the section sets forth the general rule on 
reinstatement obligations under the 
FMLA. Proposed § 825.214 retains the 
language from current § 825.214(a) 
without change. Language from current 
paragraph (b) on limitations on 
reinstatement has been moved to 
proposed § 825.216(c) and combined 
with language from current § 825.216(d) 
on concurrent workers’ compensation 
absences during FMLA leave, for 
organizational and clarification 
purposes. 
Section 825.215 (Equivalent Position) 

Current § 825.215 defines what 

constitutes an ‘‘equivalent position’’ for 
purposes of reinstatement. Current 
paragraph (a) explains that an 
equivalent position is one ‘‘virtually 
identical’’ to the employee’s former 
position. Current paragraph (b) instructs 
employers to give an employee a 
‘‘reasonable opportunity’’ to fulfill any 
conditions the employee needs to fulfill, 
such as attending a course, if the 
employee is no longer qualified for his 
or her position as a result of an FMLA 
absence. Current paragraph (c) defines 
equivalent pay, including when an 
employee is entitled to pay increases 
and certain types of bonuses when 
taking FMLA leave. Current paragraph 
(d) defines what constitutes ‘‘equivalent 
benefits.’’ Current paragraph (e) defines 
what constitutes ‘‘equivalent terms and 
conditions’’ of employment, and current 
paragraph (f) confirms that the 
definition of ‘‘equivalency’’ does not 
extend to de minimis or intangible, 
unmeasurable aspects of the job. 

The Department received extensive 
feedback regarding the impact of the 
requirements of this regulatory section 
on employer incentive programs, 
especially perfect attendance awards. 

This issue has also been the subject of 
many requests for clarification to the 
Department over the years. Employers, 
and their representatives, almost 
uniformly stated that the current 
regulatory distinction between an 
attendance bonus and a production 
bonus has a ‘‘chilling effect on employer 
incentive plans.’’ These commenters 
argued that the current regulatory 
requirements are illogical and unfair, 
and have caused many companies to 
modify, or eliminate altogether, perfect 
attendance reward programs. Other 
employers stated that they would not 
consider implementing a perfect 
attendance program because, by 
requiring that employers provide 
awards to individuals with less than 
perfect attendance, these commenters 
believe that the Department has placed 
employees taking FMLA leave in a 
better position than those who take no 
leave. Many employees also commented 
on the perceived unfairness of providing 
a ‘‘perfect attendance’’ award to 
individuals who had been absent from 
work for up to 12 weeks of the eligible 
time period. Several employer 
representatives suggested that the 
Department permit employers to 
administer attendance incentives and 
reward perfect attendance without 
regard to the reason for an absence, thus 
allowing employers to treat all 
individuals absent for work in the same 
manner. 

Several employee organizations stated 

that the current regulatory scheme 
appropriately recognizes that employees 
should not be penalized for exercising 
their FMLA rights. These commenters 
believed that permitting employers to 
exclude employees on FMLA leave from 
award programs would discourage 
employees from taking FMLA leave. 
The Department proposes several 

changes to this section. No substantive 
changes have been made to proposed 
paragraph (a), titled ‘‘[e]quivalent 
position,’’ proposed paragraph (b), titled 
‘‘[c]onditions to qualify,’’ or current 
paragraph (c)(1). The Department 
proposes changes to current paragraph 
(c)(2) regarding bonuses to allow an 
employer to disqualify an employee 
from a bonus or award predicated on the 
achievement of a goal where the 
employee fails to achieve that goal as a 
result of an FMLA absence. Of course, 
an employer could not disqualify only 
those individuals on FMLA-qualified 
leave and allow other employees on 
other forms of non-FMLA leave to 
receive such an award without violating 
the FMLA’s non-discrimination 
requirement. 

The Department proposes this change 

because the wording of current

§ 825.215(c)(2) on bonuses is confusing 
and because of the unfairness perceived 
by both employees and employers as a 
result of allowing an employee to obtain 
a perfect attendance award when the 
employee has been absent on FMLA 
leave. The confusion stems from 
language in the current section, which 
distinguishes between bonuses for job 
performance, such as those based on 
production goals, versus bonuses based 
on the absence of certain events 
occurring, and includes as examples 
both bonuses for perfect attendance and 
for working safely with no accidents. 
Moreover, the language of the current 
regulation incorrectly groups together 
bonuses for perfect attendance and 
safety as not requiring performance by 
the employee but rather the absence of 
occurrences. This defies the plain 
meaning of attendance. Employers are 
uncertain whether their employee 
incentive plans will be in violation of 
the current regulation. See Wage and 
Hour Opinion Letter FMLA–110 (Sept. 
11, 2000) (Employer inquiry regarding a 
plan the employer believed to be a 
‘‘production incentive’’ plan, which the 
Department found analogous to a perfect 
attendance program). 

Section 825.215(c)(2), containing this 
confusing distinction between a bonus 
for perfect attendance or safety versus 
meeting or exceeding production goals, 
also seems to conflict with the language 
in current § 825.215(d)(5), which states 
that an employee is ‘‘entitled to changes 
in benefits plans, except those which 
may be dependent upon seniority or 
accrual during the leave period, 
immediately upon return from leave or 
to the same extent they would have 
qualified if no leave had been taken. For 
example, if the benefit plan is 
predicated on a pre-established number 
of hours worked each year and the 
employee does not have sufficient hours 
as a result of taking unpaid FMLA leave, 
the benefit is lost.’’ Current 
§ 825.215(d)(5) is more consistent with 
29 U.S.C. 2614(a)(3), which provides 
that nothing in that section shall be 
construed to entitle any restored 
employee to—(A) the accrual of any 
seniority or employment benefits during 
any period of leave; or (B) any right, 
benefit, or position of employment other 
than any right, benefit, or position to 
which the employee would have been 
entitled had the employee not taken the 
leave. 

The Department also is concerned 

that the regulatory language in current 
§ 825.215(c)(2) provides the wrong 
incentive to employers to eliminate 
perfect attendance awards because of 
the inequity perceived by coworkers of 
allowing employees who have taken

FMLA leave to receive these awards. 
The Department did not intend, nor 
does the Act itself intend, that the 
FMLA regulations result in a reduction 
of benefits to all employees. 

Therefore, the Department proposes to 

eliminate the existing language of 
current § 825.215(c)(2) and replace it 
with the following: 

Equivalent pay includes any bonus or 

payment, whether it is discretionary or non- 
discretionary, made to employees consistent 
with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. However, if a bonus or other 
payment is based on the achievement of a 
specified goal such as hours worked, 
products sold or perfect attendance, and the 
employee has not met the goal due to FMLA 
leave, then the payment may be denied, 
unless otherwise paid to employees on an 
equivalent non-FMLA leave status. For 
example, if an employee who used paid 
vacation leave for a non-FMLA purpose 
would receive the payment, then the 
employee who used vacation leave for an 
FMLA-protected purpose also must receive 
the payment. 
The Department believes this proposed 
language better reflects the requirements 
of the statutory scheme. 

The Department has re-titled 

paragraphs (e) and (f) in the proposed 
rule. The final sentence of the current 
section, which reminds employers that 
putting an employee in a job slated for 
lay-off when the employee’s original 
position would not be eliminated would 
not meet the definition of an equivalent 
position, has been moved to proposed 
§ 825.216(a)(1) where related issues are 
discussed, for organizational and 
clarification purposes. 
Section 825.216 (Limitations on an 
employee’s right to reinstatement) 
Current § 825.216 addresses the 

limitations on an employee’s right to 
reinstatement. Specifically, current 
paragraph (a)(1) addresses what 
happens when an employee is laid off 
or the employee’s shift is eliminated 
while the employee is on FMLA leave. 
Current paragraph (b) addresses what 
happens when an employee taking 
FMLA leave was only hired for a 
specific term or project. Current 
paragraph (c) addresses limitations on 
reinstatement with regard to ‘‘key 
employees.’’ Current paragraph (d) 
addresses rules governing the 
interaction between FMLA leave and a 
workers’ compensation absence when 
the employee is unable to return to work 
at the end of the 12-week FMLA leave 
period. 

The Department’s RFI generated a 
handful of comments regarding this 
section. Several of the comments 
focused on the difficulty in providing 
job restoration rights to individuals who 

take intermittent leave for chronic 
serious health conditions. For example, 
FNG Human Resources argued that an 
employer should have the right to 
replace employees who ‘‘consistently 
use up to 11+ weeks of FMLA for year 
after year.’’ One commenter requested 
that the Department more clearly define 
the employer’s obligations should a 
layoff occur. A law firm asked that the 
Department clarify the interaction 
between § 825.216(a), which ‘‘suggests 
that a seniority provision in a [collective 
bargaining agreement] would not yield 
to the FMLA’’, and § 825.700, which, 
the commenter indicated, suggests the 
opposite result. 

The Department is not proposing any 

changes to this section to address the 
use of intermittent leave for chronic 
serious health conditions. Likewise, the 
Department believes the current 
regulatory language in this section and 
current § 825.700 adequately explains 
the interaction between the job 
restoration provisions of FMLA and 
collectively-bargained seniority 
provisions. 

Minor changes have been made to this 

section for purposes of greater clarity. 
The only change the Department 
proposes to current paragraph (a)(1) is to 
incorporate the last sentence of 
§ 825.215(f) which, as discussed above, 
states that restoration to a job slated for 
lay-off would not meet the requirements 
of an equivalent position. This is 
proposed for organizational and 
clarification purposes, but no 
substantive change is intended. 
Similarly, the Department proposes to 
re-order current paragraph (b) as 
paragraph (a)(3) for purposes of 
organizational structure and clarity. The 
Department proposes a new paragraph 
(c) to address an employer’s obligations 
when an employee cannot return to 
work after FMLA leave is exhausted 
because the serious health condition 
continues. This section combines 
language from current §§ 825.214(b) and 
825.216(d), because both sections 
address limitations on reinstatement 
when an employee has exhausted his or 
her FMLA leave entitlement and is 
unable to perform the essential 
functions of his or her job, but no 
substantive changes are intended. The 
Department has not made any changes 
to current paragraph (c) except to re- 
designate it as paragraph (b). Current 
§ 825.312 (g) and (h), which address the 
fraudulent use of FMLA leave and 
outside employment during FMLA 
leave, respectively, and therefore also 
address limitations on reinstatement, 
have been renumbered as proposed 
§ 825.216 (d) and (e) for organizational 
purposes.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Sections 825.217 through 825.219 
(Explanation of key employees and their 
rights) 

Taken together, current §§ 825.217, 
825.218 and 825.219 define the term 
‘‘key employee’’; explain the meaning of 
the phrase ‘‘substantial and grievous 
economic injury’’ to the employer’s 
operations; and provide an explanation 
of the rights of a key employee. A 
handful of comments received in 
response to the Department’s RFI 
requested that the Department allow 
employers greater flexibility to 
designate ‘‘key employees’’, particularly 
in the safety industry. A law firm 
representing employers also requested 
that the Department provide guidance 
regarding the responsibility of a 
placement agency to provide job 
restoration rights when the secondary 
employer refuses to reinstate the 
individual because the position was 
‘‘mission-critical.’’ 

The exemption for highly 

compensated employees is defined by 
statute as applying only to a salaried 
eligible employee who is among the 
highest paid 10 percent of the 
employees employed by the employer 
within 75 miles of the facility at which 
the employee is employed. See 29 
U.S.C. 2614(b)(2). While the Department 
understands that requiring job 
restoration for some lower-paid 
positions in public safety and other 
industries may cause ‘‘substantial and 
grievous economic injury’’ in particular 
situations or may cause hardship to the 
employer, the Department believes that 
any revisions to address such situations 
would require a change in the statute. 
Minor changes to § 825.217(b) have 

been made to update the reference to the 
definition of ‘‘salary basis’’ as now 
contained in 29 CFR 541.602 
(previously codified in 29 CFR 541.118) 
and to add ‘‘computer employees’’ to 
the list of employees who may qualify 
for exemption from the minimum wage 
and overtime requirements of the FLSA 
under those regulations if they meet 
certain duties and salary tests. The 
Department did not receive any 
comments specific to §§ 825.218 and 
825.219 in response to the RFI and is 
not proposing any changes to these 
provisions. 
Section 825.220 (Protection for 
Employees Who Request Leave or 
Otherwise Assert FMLA Rights) 

Current § 825.220 explains what 

actions taken by employers constitute 
an interference with an employee’s 
rights under the FMLA. The Department 
proposes to change two provisions in

this section, and to clarify two other 
provisions. 

First, the Department proposes new 
language to current paragraph (b) that 
sets forth the remedy for interfering 
with an employee’s rights under the 
FMLA. While this language also has 
been included in proposed § 825.300, 
which deals specifically with employer 
notice obligations, and proposed 
§ 825.301, which addresses what 
triggers an employer’s designation 
obligations, the Department believes it 
is important that the general rule 
governing an employer’s obligations 
under the Act also provide guidance on 
the remedy for such violations. First, 
numerous commenters to the RFI asked 
the Department to strengthen or clarify 
the regulatory provisions implementing 
the Act’s prohibitions on interference 
and discrimination. 29 U.S.C. 2615(a)(1) 
and (2). For example, the University of 
California, Hastings College of Law, 
Center for Worklife Law requested that 
the Department ‘‘clarify that 
interference with an employee’s right to 
take FMLA leave includes not only 
withholding information but also 
deterring employees from exercising 
their rights. * * *’’ The Center for 
Worklife Law asserted that ‘‘employees 
returning from [FMLA] leave have been 
given poorer quality assignments, been 
subjected to heightened scrutiny of their 
work and received undeservedly 
negative evaluations.’’ Similarly, the 
law firm of Kennedy, Reeve & Knoll and 
several individual workers asserted that 
some employers actively discourage the 
taking of FMLA leave, especially 
intermittent leave, or penalize those 
employees who take such leave. 

Second, the Department also received 
comments about the language contained 
in current § 825.220(d) stating that 
where an employee has voluntarily 
accepted a light duty position in lieu of 
taking FMLA leave, the employee’s right 
to restoration to the same or an 
equivalent position is available until 12 
weeks have passed within the 12-month 
period, including all FMLA leave taken 
and the period of ‘‘light duty.’’ The 
Department is aware that at least two 
courts have interpreted this language to 
mean that an employee uses up his or 
her twelve week FMLA leave 
entitlement while performing work in a 
light duty assignment. See Roberts v. 
Owens-Illinois, Inc., 2004 WL 1087355 
(S.D. Ind. 2004); Artis v. Palos 
Community Hospital, 2004 WL 2125414 
(N.D. Ill. 2004). These holdings differ 
from the Department’s interpretation of 
the current regulation, as further 
expressed in a 1995 DOL opinion letter 
which states that an employee who 
voluntarily accepts a light duty position: 

retains rights under FMLA to job restoration 
to the same or an equivalent position held 
prior to the start of the leave for a cumulative 
period of up to 12 workweeks. This 
‘‘cumulative period’’ would be measured by 
the time designated as FMLA leave for the 
workers’ compensation leave of absence and 
the time employed in a light duty 
assignment. The period of time employed in 
a light duty assignment cannot count, 
however, against the 12 weeks of FMLA 
leave. 
Wage and Hour Opinion Letter FMLA– 
55 (Mar. 10, 1995). 

Numerous employers, and their 

representatives, urged the Department to 
apply the current regulatory language to 
both voluntary and mandatory light 
duty assignments. The National 
Association of Convenience Stores, the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Society 
for Human Resource Management, and 
others asked the Department to require 
that employees accept light duty 
assignments, consistent with their 
medical restrictions, in lieu of taking 
FMLA leave. The College and 
University Professional Association for 
Human Resources stated that ‘‘[i]n many 
cases, light duty may be a better 
alternative than placing the employee 
on leave, as it allows the employer 
greater flexibility in meeting its staffing 
needs’’ while the Society for Human 
Resource Management noted that 
‘‘[e]xperience has shown that employees 
with minor injuries generally recover 
more quickly if they are working, 
gradually returning to their former 
capabilities.’’ As an alternative, many 
employers suggested that the 
Department revise the regulation to 
make clear that light duty work counts 
against an employee’s 12-week FMLA 
entitlement. The American Bakers 
Association, the National Coalition to 
Protect Family Leave, the National 
Business Group on Health, the Retail 
Industry Leaders Association, the 
National Restaurant Association, several 
management-side law firms, and 
individual employers and human 
resource professionals urged the 
Department to rescind Opinion Letter 
FMLA–55 and explicitly provide ‘‘that 
time spent in light duty away from the 
employee’s usual job counts against the 
12 weeks of FMLA entitlement for all 
purposes.’’ 

Other commenters, including the 

AFL-CIO, the Coalition of Labor Union 
Women, Families USA, the Maine 
Department of Labor, and the University 
of Michigan Center for the Education of 
Women, argued that counting light duty 
work as FMLA leave is not appropriate. 
Some employers, and organizations 
representing human resource 
professionals, also shared this view. For

example, MedStar Health, Inc. stated 
that ‘‘[w]hen an employee works, even 
in an alternate light duty capacity, 
he/she is not absent under the meaning 
of the FMLA.’’ 

Some commenters, such as the 

National Partnership for Women & 
Families, argued that the Department’s 
current position, which counts the time 
spent in a light duty position for 
purposes of job restoration rights but not 
FMLA leave entitlement, struck the 
appropriate balance. Still others, such as 
the University of California, Hastings 
College of Law, Center for Worklife Law, 
expressed concern that counting light 
duty work against an employee’s FMLA 
leave entitlement or reinstatement rights 
could negatively impact pregnant 
women. The National Retail Federation 
suggested that light duty not count 
against FMLA leave, unless the 
individual’s medical restrictions 
required reduced hours, in which case 
any reduction in normal work hours 
would count against the individual’s 
FMLA leave entitlement. 

Upon further review, the Department 

believes that the current regulatory 
language does not serve the Act’s 
purpose to provide job protection when 
FMLA leave is taken. Accordingly, the 
Department proposes deleting the final 
sentence of current § 825.220(d), which 
states that job restoration rights are 
available until 12 weeks have passed 
within the 12-month period including 
all FMLA leave taken and the period of 
light duty. This change will ensure that 
employees retain their right to 
reinstatement for a full 12 weeks of 
leave instead of having the right 
diminished by the amount of time spent 
in a light duty position. The Department 
also is not proposing to require 
employees to accept light duty work in 
lieu of taking FMLA leave. If an 
employee is voluntarily performing a 
light duty assignment and performing 
work, the employee is not on FMLA 
leave and the employee should not be 
deprived of future FMLA-qualifying 
leave when performing such work. By 
deleting this language, the Department 
in no way intends to discourage 
employees and employers from 
engaging in such light duty work 
arrangements. Rather, the Department 
simply wishes to make clear that when 
an employee is performing a light duty 
assignment, that employee’s rights to 
FMLA leave and to job restoration are 
not affected by such light duty 
assignment. The Department invites 
comment on whether the deletion of 
this language may negatively impact an 
employee’s ability to return to his or her 
original position from a voluntary light 
duty position. 

Many RFI commenters asked that the 

Department clarify the language in 
subsection (d) that states ‘‘[e]mployees 
cannot waive, nor may employers 
induce employees to waive, their rights 
under FMLA.’’ Some courts have 
disagreed as to whether this language 
prohibits only the prospective waiver of 
FMLA rights, such as the right to 12 
weeks of leave, or also prohibits the 
retrospective settlement of FMLA claims 
based on past employer conduct, such 
as through a settlement agreement. 
Compare Taylor v. Progress Energy, 493 
F.3d 454 (4th Cir. 2007), petition for 
cert. filed, 75 U.S.L.W. 3226 (Oct. 22, 
2007) (No. 07–539) (Department’s 
regulation prevents employees from 
independently settling past claims for 
FMLA violations with employers 
without the approval of the Department 
or a court) with Faris v. Williams WPC– 
I, Inc., 332 F.3d 316 (5th Cir. 2003) 
(plain reading of the Department’s 
regulation is that it prohibits 
prospective waiver of rights only and 
not retroactive settlement of claims). 

A majority of commenters to the RFI, 
including the Connecticut Department 
of Labor, the Ohio Department of 
Administration, the National Coalition 
to Protect Family Leave, the National 
Retail Federation, the Association of 
Corporate Counsel, the United Parcel 
Service, American Electric Power, and 
the University of California, argued that 
§ 825.220(d) should be amended to 
explicitly allow waivers and releases in 
connection with the settlement of FMLA 
claims, that is, claims for past 
violations. Commenters supporting this 
view stated that any interpretation 
preventing the waiver or release of past 
claims unnecessarily encourages 
litigation and interferes with the public 
policy favoring private resolution of 
disputes, is neither practical nor 
efficient (particularly in a reduction-in- 
force), may discourage companies from 
providing severance or separation 
packages, and is not required by the 
statutory language, which contains no 
indication that Congress intended to 
prevent such waivers. Many of these 
commenters, such as the Connecticut 
Department of Labor, the Indiana 
Chamber of Commerce, the Detroit 
Medical Center, Clark Hill PLC, and the 
Human Resource Management 
Association of Southeastern Wisconsin, 
suggested that the Department adopt 
minimum standards for knowing and 
voluntary waivers, similar to those 
provided for under the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act of 
1967, 29 U.S.C. 621, 626(f). Other RFI 
commenters, such as the National 
Employment Lawyers Association, 

urged the Department to prohibit both 
prospective and retrospective waivers, 
stating that requiring Departmental or 
court approval of voluntary settlements 
in no way jeopardizes the public policy 
in favor of settlement and protects 
vulnerable workers who might be 
induced to waive their FMLA rights 
rather than forfeit income. 

The Department proposes to clarify 

the language in paragraph (d) in light of 
the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Taylor 
which held that employees cannot 
voluntarily settle their past FMLA 
claims. The Department disagrees with 
that reading of the regulations. As the 
example in the current regulations 
reveals, this provision was intended to 
apply only to the waiver of prospective 
rights. In the interest of clarity, 
however, the Department proposes to 
make explicit in paragraph (d) that 
employees and employers should be 
permitted to voluntarily agree to the 
settlement of past claims without having 
to first obtain the permission or 
approval of the Department or a court. 
The Department does not believe this is 
a change in the law as it has never been 
the Department’s practice, since the 
enactment of the FMLA, to supervise 
such voluntary settlements. 
Section 825.300 (Employer Notice 
Requirements) 

The Act imposes notice obligations on 
both employers and employees. Current 
§§ 825.300 and 825.301 outline 
employers’ responsibilities to notify 
employees of their FMLA rights. Several 
additional notice requirements, such as 
notifying employees of their FMLA 
eligibility and designation of their 
FMLA leave, also appear elsewhere in 
current §§ 825.110 and 825.208. 

Current § 825.300(a) addresses the 
statutory posting requirement (see 29 
U.S.C. 2619(a)). Under current 
§ 825.300(b), an employer that willfully 
violates the posting requirement may be 
assessed a civil money penalty not to 
exceed $100 for each separate offense 
(see 29 U.S.C. 2619(b)). Where an 
employer’s workforce is comprised of a 
significant portion of workers who are 
not literate in English, the employer is 
responsible for providing notice in a 
language in which the employees are 
literate. See § 825.300(c). 

Current § 825.301(b) requires the 

employer to provide the employee with 
written notice detailing the specific 
expectations and obligations of the 
employee and explaining the 
consequences of a failure to meet these 
obligations. The written notice must be 
provided in a language in which the 
employee is literate and must include, 
as appropriate:

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

relate to employee awareness of their 
rights and responsibilities. 

Increasing employee and employer 

(i) That the leave will be counted against 

the employee’s annual FMLA leave 
entitlement (see § 825.208); 

(ii) Any requirements for the employee to 

furnish medical certification of a serious 
health condition and the consequences of 
failing to do so (see § 825.305); 

(iii) The employee’s right to substitute paid 
leave and whether the employer will require 
the substitution of paid leave, and the 
conditions related to any substitution; 

(iv) Any requirement for the employee to 

make any premium payments to maintain 
health benefits and the arrangements for 
making such payments (see § 825.210), and 
the possible consequences of failure to make 
such payments on a timely basis (i.e., the 
circumstances under which coverage may 
lapse); 

(v) Any requirement for the employee to 

present a fitness-for-duty certificate to be 
restored to employment (see § 825.310); 

(vi) The employee’s status as a ‘‘key 

employee’’ and the potential consequence 
that restoration may be denied following 
FMLA leave, explaining the conditions 
required for such denial (see § 825.218); 

(vii) The employee’s right to restoration to 

the same or an equivalent job upon return 
from leave (see §§ 825.214 and 825.604); and 
(viii) The employee’s potential liability for 
payment of health insurance premiums paid 
by the employer during the employee’s 
unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to 
return to work after taking FMLA leave (see 
§ 825.213). 
29 CFR 825.301(b)(1). The specific 
notice may include other information— 
e.g., whether the employer will require 
periodic reports of the employee’s status 
and intent to return to work, but is not 
required to do so (§ 825.301(b)(2)). The 
notice must be given within a 
reasonable time after notice of the need 
for leave is given by the employee- 
within one or two business days if 
feasible (§ 825.301(c)). The written 
notification to the employee that the 
leave has been designated as FMLA 
leave may be in any form, including a 
notation on the employee’s pay stub 
(§ 825.208(b)(2)). 

The Department noted in its RFI that 

one consistent concern expressed by the 
employee representatives during 
stakeholder meetings was that 
employees need to be better aware of 
their rights under the FMLA. The RFI 
solicited public input on the 
effectiveness of these various regulatory 
notice provisions in promoting 
communications between employees 
and employers and on what more could 
be done to improve the general state of 
awareness of FMLA rights and 
responsibilities by both employees and 
employers. The Department sought 
information in response to several 
questions concerning the notice 
provisions and how those provisions

The Department believes that a key 

component of making the FMLA a 
success is effective communication 
between employees and employers. To 
improve the process, the Department 
proposes to collect the notice 
requirements into one comprehensive 
section that better captures the 
appropriate communications that need 
to occur between an employer and 
employee in the FMLA process. 
Specifically, the Department proposes to 
combine components of current 
§§ 825.300, 825.301, 825.208, and 
825.110 into one comprehensive section 
addressing an employer’s notice 
obligations. 

Proposed § 825.300 is divided into 
separate paragraphs that address the 
major topics of ‘‘(a): [g]eneral notice’’; 
‘‘(b): [e]ligibility notice’’; ‘‘(c): 
[d]esignation notice’’; and ‘‘(d): 
[c]onsequences of failing to provide 
notice’’. The ‘‘general notice’’ 
requirement requires an employer to 
post a notice explaining the Act’s 
provisions and complaint filing 
procedures, and to provide this same 
notice in employee handbooks or by 
distributing a copy annually. The 
‘‘eligibility notice’’ provides notice to 
the employee that he or she is an 
eligible employee under FMLA (as 
defined in § 825.110), has FMLA leave 
available, and has certain rights and 
responsibilities. Within five business 
days of having obtained sufficient 
information to determine whether the 
requested leave is being taken for a 
qualifying reason, the employer must 
provide the employee with a notice 
regarding designation of FMLA leave— 
referred to as the ‘‘designation notice.’’ 
The designation notice informs the 
employee whether the particular leave 
requested will be designated as FMLA 
leave. 

While the current regulations contain 
the ‘‘provisional designation’’ concept, 
the Department believes that this 
process may cause confusion over 
whether leave is protected prior to the 
actual designation. In some cases, the 
leave may not eventually qualify for the 
Act’s protections. Thus, the 
Department’s proposal restructures the 
regulations to recognize that employers 
may not be able to designate leave as 
FMLA covered until the employee 
provides additional information. The 
Department specifically invites 

awareness of FMLA rights and 
responsibilities continues to be a 
challenge based on comments submitted 
to the RFI. International Auto 
Processing, Inc., suggested that 
employees may be unaware of their 
FMLA rights due to the timing of when 
they receive information about FMLA: 
‘‘If employees continue to be unaware of 
their FMLA rights, it may be because 
most employers will cover this at 
orientation. On the first day of the job, 
new employees are nervous and are 
overwhelmed with paperwork and work 
rules. Since FMLA won’t affect them 
until they have in the requisite 12 
months with the company, they may 
shove that information to the back 
burner.’’ 

Some comments addressed the 

sufficiency of the information provided. 
The United Transportation Union stated 
that the ‘‘posting requirements for 
employers under FMLA do not go far 
enough in that they do not actively 
educate employees on their rights under 
FMLA. In addition to posting FMLA 
basic facts as required by the regulation, 
employers should be required to give 
the information to employees, in 
writing, once they become eligible 
under the regulations with that 
employer. Contact phone numbers for 
the employer as well as detailed appeals 
process afforded to the employee should 
be provided, as well as recourse 
information for possible retaliatory 
practices by the employer.’’ The 
International Association of Machinists 
and Aerospace Workers recommended 
that ‘‘employees should be expressly 
notified of their right to take 
intermittent leave. * * * This has 
proven a real problem for some of our 
members. * * * An employee who 
suffers from a condition that is still 
being diagnosed, but doctors believe it 
is either lupus, a connective tissue 
disorder or rheumatoid arthritis, arrived 
late to work due to her condition on a 
number of occasions [and] was 
completely unaware that she could take 
FMLA on an intermittent basis. She 
thought if she took any FMLA leave, she 
would have to stop working altogether, 
something her illness did not 
necessitate and something she could not 
afford to do.’’ 

The AFL–CIO urged the Department 

to consider ‘‘requiring employers to 
provide an individualized notice 
provision to employees on an annual 
basis,’’ and referred to another 
commenter who suggested requiring 
notice to employees at the point of 
hiring and annually thereafter. The

comment on whether this proposal will 
effectively communicate the required 
information to employees about their 
FMLA rights while relieving some of the 
administrative burdens for employers 
under the current process. 
General Notice Requirements 

Proposed § 825.300(a) is a ‘‘general 
notice requirement’’ that merges the 
poster/notice requirement contained in 
current § 825.300 with the written 
guidance required in current 
§ 825.301(a). Proposed § 825.300(a)(1) 
maintains the statutory requirement that 
every covered employer post and keep 
posted in conspicuous places on its 
premises a notice providing information 
about the FMLA. Given the growth of 
the Internet since the Department issued 
the 1995 regulations, however, as well 
as the practical realities that more and 
more employees do not physically 
report to a central location, the 
Department proposes that this posting 
requirement may be satisfied through an 
electronic posting of the notice as long 
as it otherwise meets the requirements 
of this section. To provide sufficient 
notice required by the statute (see 29 
U.S.C. 2619), the employer must make 
sure that the information is accessible to 
applicants as well as employees, so 
simply posting such information on an 
intranet that is not accessible to 
applicants will not meet the 
requirements. Electronic posting could 
be accomplished, for example, by 
posting the notice in a conspicuous 
manner on the employer’s Internet web- 
page inviting applicants to apply if the 
employer accepts applications only 
through the Internet. If the employer 
also accepts applications on-site, 
however, the notice would have to be 
physically posted for applicants to view 
on-site unless the employer had a 
computer kiosk available for applicants 
to view the poster on-line. Similarly, in 
order for electronic-only posting to 
provide sufficient notice to employees, 
all employees must have access to 
company computers that post the 
information in a conspicuous manner. 
For example, the company may make 
computer kiosks available for use in 
employee lunch rooms. The Department 
specifically seeks comment on whether 
this ‘‘posting’’ alternative is considered 
workable and will ensure that 
employees and applicants obtain the 
required FMLA information. 
Poster Civil Money Penalty 

Section 109(b) of the FMLA (29 U.S.C. 

2619(b)) provides that any employer 
who willfully violates the Act’s 
requirement to post the FMLA notice as 
required by section 109(a) may be 

assessed a civil money penalty (CMP) 
not to exceed $100 for each separate 
offense. This CMP amount was set by 
the Congress as part of the original 
FMLA of 1993. The regulations, at 
§ 825.300(b), currently provide for 
assessment of a $100 penalty for willful 
violations of the posting requirement. 

The Department proposes to increase 
the civil money penalty for violation of 
this posting to $110.00 to meet 
requirements of the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104– 
134, Title III, § 31001(s)(1), Apr. 26, 
1996, 110 Stat. 1321–373). The Debt 
Collection Improvement Act amended 
the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act of 1990 (Public Law 
101–410, Oct. 5, 1990, 104 Stat. 890) to 
require that Federal agencies issue 
regulations to adjust certain CMPs for 
inflation. As amended, the law requires 
each agency to initially adjust for 
inflation all covered CMPs, and to 
periodically make further inflationary 
adjustments thereafter. The adjustment 
prescribed in the amended Act is based 
on a cost-of-living formula according to 
the percentage determined by the 
Department of Labor’s Consumer Price 
Index (CPI). The statute provides for 
rounding the penalty increases. Once 
the percentage change in the CPI is 
calculated, the amount of the 
adjustment is rounded according to a 
table in the Federal Civil Penalties 
Inflation Adjustment Act, which is 
scaled based on the dollar amount of the 
current penalty. For penalties less than 
or equal to $100, the increase is rounded 
to the nearest multiple of $10. The 
statute applies a cap, for the initial 
adjustment only, which limits the 
amount of the first penalty increase to 
10 percent of the current penalty 
amount. Any increase under the Act 
applies prospectively to violations that 
occur after the date the increase takes 
effect in amendments to the regulations. 

The amount by which the current 
CPI–U exceeds the CPI–U for June of 
1993 is more than the statutory cap of 
10 percent. Consequently, due to 
inflation since this CMP amount was 
first established in 1993, the adjustment 
permitted by law is limited to the 
maximum 10 percent initial cap. It is 
proposed, therefore, to amend 
§ 825.300(a) to provide for assessment of 
a penalty of $110 for willful violations 
of the posting requirement. 
Clarification of Covered Employer 
Responsibilities 

For purposes of clarity, the 

Department proposes to separate out 
into a new paragraph the language from 
existing § 825.300(a) that requires a 
covered employer to post the general

notice to individual employees even if 
no employees are eligible for FMLA 
leave. For example, an employer may 
employ 60 employees located in all 50 
states, and no employee meets the 
eligibility requirement of working at a 
site to which 50 or more employees 
report within 75 miles. See 29 U.S.C. 
2611(2)(B)(ii) and 29 CFR 825.110. In 
such a case, an employer still would 
have to comply with the posting 
requirement. This is a statutory posting 
requirement, see 29 U.S.C. 2611(4) and 
2619(a), although some confusion exists 
on this point since it is not obvious that 
such a notice is required when an 
employer does not have any eligible 
employees. The Department aims to 
minimize such confusion by 
highlighting this requirement in a 
separate section. 

Proposed § 825.300(a)(3) states that 

covered employers with eligible 
employees also must distribute the 
general notice described in proposed 
§ 825.300(a) either by including it in an 
employee handbook or by distributing a 
copy to each employee at least once a 
year, either in paper or electronic form. 
This provision incorporates the existing 
notice distribution requirement found in 
current § 825.301(a)(1), which requires 
an employer to place in an employee 
handbook, if one exists, a notice of 
FMLA rights and responsibilities and 
the employer’s policies on the FMLA. 
Current § 825.301(a)(2) states that if an 
employer does not have a handbook, 
when an employee gives specific notice 
of the need for leave, the employer must 
provide written guidance to an 
employee concerning all the employee’s 
rights and obligations under the FMLA, 
and the DOL Fact Sheet can meet this 
requirement. The information found in 
the DOL Fact Sheet mirrors, in part, 
information contained in the poster. 

To streamline the notice requirement 

currently found in § 825.301(a)(1) and 
the posting requirement, the Department 
proposes that one document containing 
identical information be both posted 
and distributed, thereby satisfying the 
posting and distribution requirement. 
The Department intends that this 
proposed change will more effectively 
convey consistent, relevant information 
to employees. Moreover, the 
Department’s proposed prototype notice 
is revised to provide employees more 
useful information on their FMLA rights 
and responsibilities. 

To further address the concern that 

employees are unaware of their rights as 
explained above, the Department 
proposes that if the proposed notice is 
not contained in an employee 
handbook, it must be distributed 
annually, regardless of specific

employee requests for leave. This new 
frequency requirement exceeds that of 
the current regulations, but the 
Department is responding to the 
concern that employees may not be 
aware of their FMLA rights in many 
cases, and the Department believes that 
this requirement will promote increased 
awareness. In addition, the 
communication will be more effective if 
the notice is provided routinely and 
annually rather than only when an 
employee is facing a significant family 
event like the birth or adoption of a 
child or a serious medical emergency 
affecting the employee or a family 
member. 

The Department’s proposal does not 

require that a covered employer with no 
eligible employees distribute the general 
notice, although the employer would 
have to comply with this requirement 
even if it only has one eligible 
employee. The Department specifically 
seeks comments on all aspects of these 
proposed notice provisions. 
Prototype General Notice 

Proposed § 825.300(a)(4) explains that 

the Department has included a 
prototype notice in Appendix C for 
employers to use and that copies will be 
available from Wage and Hour offices 
and from the Department’s Internet 
website. Consistent with current 
§§ 825.300(c) and 825.301(b)(1), 
proposed § 825.300(a)(4) requires that 
an employer provide the poster and 
general notice to employees in a 
language in which they are literate 
when the employer employs a 
significant portion of employees who 
are not literate in English. The 
Department intends to make such 
notices available in alternative 
languages in accordance with the 
requirements of this section on the 
Internet and through local Wage and 
Hour district offices. This section also 
includes language from current 
§ 825.301(e) requiring notice to sensory- 
impaired individuals as required under 
applicable Federal and State law. 
Eligibility Notice 

Proposed § 825.300(b) consolidates 

the notice provisions contained in 
existing §§ 825.110(d) and 825.301(b) 
into a paragraph entitled ‘‘eligibility 
notice.’’ Consistent with current 
§ 825.110, the employer continues to be 
responsible under proposed paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section for communicating 
eligibility status. As under the current 
regulations, the employer’s obligation to 
notify the employee of his or her 
eligibility to take FMLA leave (i.e., 
whether the employee has been 
employed for 12 months and has

worked for 1,250 hours of service in the 
preceding 12 months) is not triggered 
until the employee has provided the 
employer with at least verbal notice 
sufficient to indicate that the employee 
needs FMLA-qualifying leave. See 
§§ 825.302 and 825.303. The proposed 
regulations require that the eligibility 
notice be conveyed within five business 
days after the employee either requests 
leave or the employer acquires 
knowledge that the employee’s leave 
may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason. 
While this proposal is a change from the 
current timeframe of two business days, 
the Department is responding to 
significant comments noting that the 
two-day turnaround time is in practice 
very difficult to meet, and the 
Department does not believe that 
extending this time frame to five 
business days will compromise an 
employee’s FMLA rights. The 
Department specifically seeks comment 
on whether this timeframe will both 
impart sufficient information to 
employees in a timely manner and 
whether it is workable for employers. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(2) of this 

section specifies what information an 
employer must convey when 
communicating with the employee as to 
eligibility status. While not required 
under the current regulations, the 
proposal requires the employer to notify 
the employee whether leave is still 
available in the applicable 12-month 
period. If the employee is not eligible or 
has no FMLA leave available, then, 
pursuant to proposed paragraph (b)(2), 
the notice must indicate the reasons 
why the employee is not eligible or that 
the employee has no FMLA leave 
available. For example, an employer 
might need to indicate that an employee 
has not worked long enough to meet the 
12-month eligibility requirement. 

The Department proposes these new 

notification requirements to address the 
concern that employees are not aware of 
their rights. The Department believes 
that a better understanding on the part 
of both employees and employers as to 
their respective FMLA rights and 
obligations will better ensure that 
employees who qualify for FMLA leave 
obtain such leave. In proposing these 
new notice requirements, the 
Department believes that the additional 
burden will be minimal, since the 
employer is already required to 
calculate such information in any case 
to determine eligibility in order to meet 
the requirements of the statute. 

If the employee is eligible for FMLA 
leave, then proposed paragraph (b)(3) 
also requires, consistent with current 
§ 825.301(b), that the employer inform 
the employee of the employee’s rights 

and responsibilities, such as any 
requirement to provide sufficient 
medical certification, pay premiums for 
continuing benefits, and job restoration 
rights upon expiration of FMLA leave. 
The Department proposes to add 
language to clarify in § 825.300(b)(3)(iii) 
when an employer notifies an eligible 
employee of the right to substitute 
employer-provided paid leave and the 
conditions related to any such 
substitution that the employer also 
inform the employee that he/she may 
take unpaid FMLA leave if the 
employee does not comply with the 
terms and conditions of the employer’s 
paid leave policies (see discussion 
supra at § 825.207). The Department 
also proposes to add language to 
§ 825.300(b)(3)(v) indicating that 
employers should include a statement of 
the employee’s essential job functions 
with the eligibility notice if they will 
require that those functions be 
addressed in a fitness-for-duty 
certification. 

The remainder of proposed 

§ 825.300(b) relies upon existing 
language in current § 825.301 with 
limited modifications. Specifically, 
proposed § 825.300(b)(4) adopts 
language from current § 825.301(b)(2), 
which provides that the eligibility 
notice may include other information on 
an employee’s rights and 
responsibilities such as providing 
periodic reports of the employee’s status 
and intent to return to work. Consistent 
with language from current § 825.301(c), 
proposed § 825.300(b)(6) states that the 
eligibility notice need not be provided 
more frequently than once every six 
months unless the specific information 
in the notice changes. If leave has 
already begun, the notice should be 
mailed to the employee’s address of 
record. Proposed § 825.300(b)(7) states 
that if information changes, the 
employer should provide notice to the 
employee of any information that has 
changed within five business days, a 
change from the current two-day 
requirement. The proposal also contains 
new language stating that the employer 
should include the medical certification 
form, if the employer requires such 
information, along with the eligibility 
notice. 

Consistent with the current 

regulations, proposed § 825.300(b)(8) 
provides that if an employer requires 
medical certification or a fitness-for- 
duty report, written notice of the 
requirement shall be given with respect 
to each employee notice of a need for 
leave, unless the employer 
communicates in writing to employees 
that such information will always be 
required in connection with certain

absences and then oral notice must still 
be given. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(9) is 

unchanged from current § 825.301(d) 
and provides that employers will 
responsively answer employees’ 
questions on their rights and 
responsibilities under FMLA. 

Proposed paragraph (b)(10) provides 

that an optional prototype eligibility 
notice is included in Appendix D. This 
proposed prototype reflects changes in 
the proposed regulation. The 
Department also has attempted to 
simplify the form for easier use and 
adaptability. 
Designation Notice 

Proposed § 825.300(c) outlines the 

proposed requirements of the 
designation notice an employer must 
provide to an employee, currently 
located in § 825.208(b). This proposed 
designation notice requires that an 
employer notify the employee within 
five business days (a change from the 
current requirement of two business 
days) that leave is designated as FMLA 
leave once the employer has sufficient 
information to make such a 
determination. 

The RFI sought comments on whether 
the current two business day time frame 
was adequate for employers to notify 
employees that their request for FMLA 
leave has been approved or denied. The 
majority of comments on this topic 
indicated that the current two-day time 
frame was too restrictive. United Parcel 
Service commented, ‘‘In most cases, the 
initial notification of an absence or need 
for leave is received by front-line 
management, who conveys the 
information up the chain of command 
and to the local HR representative, who 
notifies the FMLA administrator, who is 
ultimately responsible for making a 
determination. It is not unusual for it to 
take one to two business days just for 
the right personnel to receive the 
information, much less make a 
determination and communicate it back 
to the employee.’’ Courier Corporation 
noted similarly, ‘‘The two-day 
timeframe is way too short for notifying 
employees about their leave request, 
since as employers we are often chasing 
information from the employee or 
physician.’’ Spencer Fane Britt & 
Browne LLP agreed: ‘‘For most 
employers, this is virtually impossible. 
Although most employers designate 
leave within a reasonable time frame, it 
is usually well outside the two-day time 
frame, thus creating a risk that the 
designation will be ineffective.’’ 
Employers suggested varying 
timeframes to replace the two-day limit.

LLP (fifteen days from receipt of a 
certification form); National Coalition to 
Protect Family Leave (ten business 
days); Association of Corporate Counsel 
(five working days); Courier Corporation 
(five days); United States Postal Service 
(same); Northrop Grumman Newport 
News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock 
Company (same). 

International Auto Processing, Inc., 

stated that while some decisions can be 
made in two days, even a week might 
not be sufficient in other cases, 
depending upon the amount of 
information supplied by an employee 
and whether clarification is needed 
from the health care provider. Hinshaw 
& Culbertson LLP commented similarly 
that the two-day time frame for 
providing notification to employees that 
FMLA leave has been approved or 
denied is inadequate, ‘‘as there are 
many factors which result in delays in 
both obtaining information and 
processing requests.’’ 

In light of the comments received, the 
proposed rule requires the employer to 
provide the employee notice of the 
designation of FMLA leave within five 
business days of receiving sufficient 
information from the employee to 
designate the leave as FMLA leave. The 
proposed designation notice also 
contains an additional provision that 
expressly requires the employer to 
inform the employee of the number of 
hours, days or weeks, if possible, that 
will be designated as FMLA leave. 
Although current § 825.208(b)(1) 
requires employers to inform employees 
that leave ‘‘is designated and will be 
counted as FMLA leave,’’ it does not 
specifically require employers to 
provide employees with information 
detailing the amount of leave so 
designated. When an employee requests 
a block of foreseeable leave and 
provides appropriate notice to the 
employer, it should be relatively 
straightforward for the employer to 
provide the employee with the amount 
of leave that will be designated as 
FMLA. However, to the extent that 
future leave will be needed by the 
employee for a condition but the exact 
amount of leave is unknown (as is often 
the case with unforeseeable intermittent 
leave for a chronic serious health 
condition), the employer must inform 
the employee every 30 days that leave 
has been designated and protected 
under the FMLA and advise the 
employee as to the amount so 
designated if the employee took leave 
during the 30-day period. Currently, the 
regulations do not specifically address 
designation of unforeseen, intermittent 
leave, and the Department believes that 
it is important for employees to be 

aware when such leave is designated as 
FMLA leave in a timely fashion. 
Further, the proposed section contains a 
new requirement that an employer 
notify the employee if the leave is not 
designated as FMLA leave due to 
insufficient information or a non- 
qualifying reason. 

As noted above, the Department 

proposes to change the timeframe in 
which an employer must designate 
leave as FMLA leave from two business 
days to five business days. As discussed 
above with respect to the change in 
timeframe for providing the eligibility 
notice, the Department believes this will 
result in more accurate notice given to 
employees. Moreover, this change is 
proposed in concert with new notice 
requirements that would require 
employers to provide employees with 
more substantive information than that 
required under the current regulations. 
The Department does not believe that 
these new information requirements 
should be burdensome for employers 
since the employer will already need to 
determine in any event whether or not 
the leave should be designated and 
counted against the employee’s 12-week 
FMLA leave entitlement. The proposed 
requirement merely requires the 
employer to expressly communicate this 
information to the employee. The 
Department specifically seeks comment 
on whether these proposed revisions 
both adequately protect employee rights 
and are workable for employers. Neither 
the proposed nor current regulations 
mandate a specific format for the 
written notice. The proposed paragraph 
(c)(2), consistent with current 
§ 825.208(b)(2), indicates that this 
information may be communicated on a 
pay stub. 

Proposed § 825.300(c)(3) improves the 

notices employers must provide to 
employees. It explicitly permits an 
employer to provide an employee with 
both the eligibility and designation 
notice at the same time in cases where 
the employer has adequate information 
to designate leave as FMLA leave when 
an employee requests the leave. This is 
an acknowledgement that in some cases 
there will be no question that a leave 
request qualifies as FMLA leave and the 
proposal encourages an employer to 
designate the leave as soon as possible. 

Section 825.300(c)(4) states that a 

prototype designation notice is 
contained in Appendix E. This form is 
a new optional ‘‘designation notice’’ 
that an employer can use to satisfy its 
obligation to notify an employee that 
leave is being designated as FMLA leave 
because it is being taken for a qualifying 
reason, as required by proposed 
§ 825.300(c)(1).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Remedy Provision 

Proposed paragraph (d) has been 

added in light of Ragsdale, and expands 
on current § 825.301(f). Consistent with 
the Department’s discussion of 
proposed § 825.301, the Department 
believes that the U.S. Supreme Court’s 
Ragsdale decision requires a remedy 
provision for a notice violation that is 
tailored to individualized harm. 
Therefore, as noted in the discussion of 
§§ 825.110, 825.301, and 825.220, the 
Department has added a provision 
explaining that failure to comply with 
the notice requirements set forth in this 
section could result in the interference 
with, restraint of, or denial of the use of 
FMLA leave. If the employee is able to 
demonstrate harm as a result of the 
employer’s failure to provide notice of 
eligibility or designation of FMLA leave 
as required, an employer may be liable 
for the harm suffered as a result of the 
violation, such as lost compensation 
and benefits, other monetary losses, and 
appropriate equitable or other relief, 
including employment, reinstatement, 
or promotion. 
Section 825.301 (Employer Designation 
of FMLA Leave) 

The Department proposes to delete 

current § 825.301, which addresses 
employer notices to employees, because 
its requirements have been incorporated 
into proposed § 825.300 as discussed 
above. Current § 825.208 addressing 
designation of FMLA leave has been 
moved to proposed § 825.301. Current 
§ 825.208 explains under what 
circumstances an employer can 
designate leave as FMLA leave. 
Paragraph (a) of that section explains 
that it is the employer’s obligation to 
designate leave as FMLA leave. 
Paragraph (a)(1) of that section explains 
that the employee has an obligation to 
provide the employer with enough 
information to determine if the leave is 
potentially FMLA-qualifying. Paragraph 
(a)(2) explains that the employee need 
not specifically request FMLA leave, 
although if an employee requests paid 
leave for an FMLA reason and the 
employer denies the request, the 
employee must provide the employer 
with sufficient information to make the 
determination that the leave is for an 
FMLA-qualifying reason. Paragraph (a) 
also explains that if the employer does 
not have sufficient information to 
designate paid leave as FMLA-covered, 
the employer has an obligation to 
inquire further in order to ascertain 
whether the paid leave is potentially 
covered by the FMLA. Current 
paragraph (b)(1) of that section states 
that once an employer has enough

information that leave is taken for an 
FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer 
must designate the leave as FMLA leave. 
Paragraph (b)(2) explains that the 
designation may be oral or in writing 
and must be confirmed in writing no 
later than the following payday. Current 
paragraph (c) of that section provides 
that paid leave must be designated as 
FMLA-covered leave within two 
business days of when the employee 
gives notice of leave, or when the 
employer has sufficient information to 
make such a determination if not 
available until later. It also requires the 
employer to advise the employee if 
substitution of paid leave will be 
required. The section also explains that 
if the employer knows that paid leave is 
for an FMLA reason when the employee 
advises of the need for leave or when 
the leave commences and does not at 
that time designate (and notify the 
employee) that the leave is being 
charged to the employee’s FMLA leave 
entitlement, the leave may not be 
designated as FMLA leave retroactively 
and may only be designated as FMLA 
leave prospectively. In such case, none 
of the absence preceding the notice to 
the employee of the designation may be 
counted against the employee’s 12-week 
FMLA leave entitlement, but ‘‘the 
employee is subject to the full 
protections of the Act’’ during that 
period of absence. 

Current paragraph (d) of that section 
explains the rules for designating leave 
after leave has begun. Current paragraph 
(e) explains that leave may not be 
retroactively designated except in 
limited circumstances such as when a 
non-FMLA leave turns into an FMLA- 
qualifying leave or when an employee 
has taken leave for a short duration and 
only notifies the employer when the 
employee returns from leave. 

The proposed revisions maintain the 

basic requirement from current 
§ 825.208 that employers designate 
qualifying leave as FMLA promptly and 
notify employees of that designation. 
See the Department’s 2007 Report on 
the RFI comments, Chapter V, Section D 
(72 FR at 35585). The revisions, 
however, account for the Supreme 
Court’s ruling in Ragsdale prohibiting 
categorical penalties based on an 
employer’s failure to appropriately 
designate FMLA leave. 

The Department also proposes a new 

paragraph (b) in this section that 
specifically addresses employee 
responsibilities. The substance of the 
language contained in current paragraph 
(a) of § 825.208 that addresses such 
responsibilities has been retained and 
moved to this new section, but the 
proposal simplifies the language and 

mirrors changes made to §§ 825.302 and 
825.303. The proposed paragraph cross- 
references §§ 825.302 and 825.303 that 
address what constitutes sufficient 
information an employee must 
communicate to an employer when 
needing FMLA leave, as further 
explained below. Proposed § 825.301(b) 
also incorporates the substance of the 
provision in current § 825.208(a)(2) that 
an employee need not invoke the FMLA 
when asserting rights under the Act. As 
a matter of clarification, the word 
‘‘unpaid’’ is deleted, as these employee 
responsibilities apply whether the leave 
is paid or unpaid. The proposed section 
also explains that the consequences for 
an employee’s failure to satisfy these 
responsibilities may include delay as 
well as denial of FMLA leave. 

The substance of current § 825.208(b) 

has been moved to proposed 
§ 825.300(c) that addresses the other 
notice obligations of employers. As 
noted above, current § 825.208(c) 
explains an employer’s designation 
obligations with regard to paid leave 
and the consequences that apply when 
an employer fails to properly and timely 
designate leave. In light of Ragsdale, the 
Department cannot prohibit the 
retroactive designation of FMLA leave 
absent a showing of individual harm. By 
the same token, the Department believes 
that it is important that employers 
timely designate FMLA leave so that 
both employees and employers are 
aware as to what employee rights attach 
when a specific FMLA leave period is 
at issue. Indeed, in the preamble 
accompanying the current regulations, 
the Department explained that this 
section was intended to resolve the 
question of FMLA designation as early 
as possible in the leave request process, 
to eliminate protracted ‘‘after the fact’’ 
disputes. (60 FR at 2207) The 
Department has received comments, 
however, that in certain cases, the 
prohibition on retroactive designation 
actually may harm the employee. 

The Department has reevaluated the 
original rationale for this rule and still 
believes it is beneficial to both 
employees and employers to know in 
advance, or at least as soon as possible, 
when leave is considered FMLA- 
protected leave. Therefore, the 
Department proposes to make clear that 
an employer has an obligation to timely 
designate leave (within five business 
days, absent extenuating circumstances) 
as proposed in § 825.301(a). However, in 
light of Ragsdale and the comments the 
Department has received, proposed 
paragraph (d) of this section 
acknowledges that retroactive 
designation may occur, but that if an 
employer fails to timely designate leave

as specified in § 825.300 and paragraph 
(a) of this section, and if an employee 
establishes that he or she has suffered 
harm as a result of the employer’s 
actions, a remedy may be available. The 
Department provides examples in 
paragraph (e) to illustrate the type of 
circumstance where an employee may 
or may not be able to show that harm 
has occurred as a result of the 
employer’s actions. In many cases 
where an employee’s own serious health 
condition is involved, the Department 
believes it will be difficult to show harm 
as a result of the employer’s failure to 
timely designate FMLA leave, as the 
employee will frequently be unable to 
delay or forgo the leave. Cf. Downey v. 
Strain,—F.3d—, 2007 WL 4328487 (5th 
Cir. 2007) (finding employee was 
harmed by employer’s failure to 
designate leave as FMLA leave). On the 
other hand, if an employee knows he or 
she would need the FMLA leave later in 
the year for planned medical treatment, 
he or she may choose to have another 
family member provide care for a child 
with a serious health condition instead 
of taking leave at a certain point if the 
employee knew that the time off would 
count against the employee’s FMLA 
entitlement. In addition, this proposal 
can benefit employees who did not 
fulfill their FMLA notice obligations at 
the time of taking leave, by allowing 
employers to retroactively designate 
leave to prevent disciplinary action. 

The last sentence in proposed 

paragraph (d) states that in all cases 
where a leave is FMLA-qualifying, an 
employer and an employee can 
mutually agree that leave be 
retroactively designated as FMLA leave. 

Proposed paragraph (e), titled 

‘‘[r]emedies,’’ mirrors the statutory 
scheme and provides that failure to 
timely designate could constitute an 
interference with, restraint of, or denial 
of, the exercise of an employee’s FMLA 
rights. Specifically, if the employee is 
able to establish prejudice as a result of 
the employer’s failure to designate leave 
properly, an employer may be liable for 
compensation and benefits lost by 
reason of the violation, for other 
monetary losses sustained as a direct 
result of the violation, and for 
appropriate equitable relief, including 
employment, reinstatement, promotion, 
or any other relief tailored to the harm 
suffered. This language mirrors the 
statutory remedies set forth in 29 U.S.C. 
2617, as well as language in the 
Ragsdale decision. 

In light of proposed paragraphs (d) 

and (e) discussed above, current 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of § 825.208 
discussing when leave can be 

retroactively designated under the 
current regulations have been deleted. 
Section 825.302 (Employee Notice 
Requirements for Foreseeable FMLA 
Leave) 

Current § 825.302(a) explains what 

notice an employee must give an 
employer when the need for FMLA 
leave is foreseeable. The requirement, as 
set forth in the statute, 29 U.S.C. 
2612(e), is that an employee must give 
at least 30 days’ notice if the need for 
FMLA leave is foreseeable. If 30 days’ 
notice is not possible, the employee 
must give notice ‘‘as soon as 
practicable.’’ The current regulations 
define ‘‘as soon as practicable’’ in 
§ 825.302(b) to mean ‘‘as soon as both 
possible and practical, taking into 
account all of the facts and 
circumstances in the individual case.’’ It 
further states that ‘‘ordinarily’’ as soon 
as practicable would mean ‘‘at least 
verbal notification to the employer 
within one or two business days of 
when the need for leave becomes known 
to the employee.’’ Current paragraph (c) 
explains the form and content of notice 
an employee must provide when taking 
leave and the obligations of employers 
to obtain follow-up information when 
needed. Current paragraph (d) explains 
that an employer can require an 
employee to comply with its usual and 
customary notice procedures, but that 
an employer cannot disallow or delay 
leave if such procedures are not 
followed if timely notice is given. 
Current paragraph (e) explains that an 
employee has a duty to plan medical 
treatment so as to not unduly disrupt an 
employer’s operations; current 
paragraph (f) explains an employee’s 
notification obligations with regard to 
intermittent leave; and current 
paragraph (g) explains that while an 
employer can waive an employee’s 
FMLA notice requirements, an employer 
cannot require an employee to comply 
with stricter FMLA requirements if a 
collective bargaining agreement, State 
law, or the employer’s leave policies 
allow less notice. 
Timing of Notice 

Proposed § 825.302(a) retains both the 

current requirement that an employee 
must give at least 30 days’ notice when 
the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable 
at least 30 days in advance, and the 
requirement that notice be provided ‘‘as 
soon as practicable’’ if leave is 
foreseeable but 30 days’ notice is not 
practicable. The Department further 
proposes to add that when an employee 
gives less than 30 days’ advance notice, 
the employee must respond to a request 
from the employer and explain why it 

was not practicable to give 30 days’ 
notice. 

The Department proposes to delete 

the second sentence of current 
paragraph (b) of this section, which 
defines ‘‘as soon as practicable’’ as 
‘‘ordinarily * * * within one or two 
business days of when the need for 
leave becomes known to the employee.’’ 
While the ‘‘one to two business days’ ’’ 
timeframe was intended as an 
illustrative outer limit, Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA–101 (Jan. 15, 
1999), in effect, mistakenly read the 
regulation as allowing employees two 
business days from learning of their 
need for leave to provide notice to their 
employers, regardless of whether it 
would have been practicable to provide 
notice more quickly. In that letter, the 
Department found that an absence 
policy that required employees to report 
their absences within one hour after the 
start of their shift, unless they were 
unable to do so due to circumstances 
beyond their control, was contrary to 
the FMLA’s notice procedures. The 
Department provided the following 
example of the employee’s notice 
obligation: 

For example, an employee receives notice 
on Monday that his/her therapy session for 
a seriously injured back, which normally is 
scheduled for Fridays, must be rescheduled 
for Thursday. If the employee failed to 
provide the employer notice of this 
scheduling change by close of business 
Wednesday (as would be required under 
FMLA’s two-day notification rule), the 
employer could take an adverse action 
against the employee for failure to provide 
timely notice under the company’s 
attendance policy. 

Comments received in response to the 
RFI indicated that the ‘‘two-day rule’’ 
has created significant problems for 
employers in maintaining appropriate 
staffing levels. See, e.g., Southwest 
Airlines Co. (‘‘[T]he DOL’s informal 
two-day notice practice is an arbitrary 
standard that fails to recognize an 
employer’s legitimate operational need 
for timely notice and that contradicts 
with an employee’s statutory duty to 
provide such notice as is practicable.’’); 
National Coalition to Protect Family 
Leave (‘‘The phrase ‘as much notice as 
is practicable’ is not well-defined. The 
current phrase puts employers in the 
difficult position of having to approve 
leaves where questionable notice has 
been given. The current regulatory 
definition—within one or two business 
days—has been applied by the 
Department to both foreseeable and 
unforeseeable leaves, and to protect 
employees who provide notice within 
two days, even if notice could have been

provided sooner under the particular 
facts and circumstances.’’). 

The Department is aware that timely 
notice of an employee’s need for FMLA 
leave is critical to the balance struck in 
the Act between the employee’s ability 
‘‘to take reasonable leave for medical 
reasons, for the birth or adoption of a 
child, and for the care of a child, 
spouse, or parent who has a serious 
health condition’’ and ‘‘the legitimate 
interests of employers.’’ 29 U.S.C. 
2601(b). Absent emergency situations, 
where an employee becomes aware of a 
need for FMLA leave less than 30 days 
in advance, the Department expects that 
it will be practicable for the employee 
to provide notice of the need for leave 
either the same day (if the employee 
becomes aware of the need for leave 
during work hours) or the next business 
day (if the employee becomes aware of 
the need for leave after work hours). 
Accordingly, the Department proposes 
to add examples to proposed paragraph 
(b) clarifying the employee’s obligation 
to provide notice ‘‘as soon as 
practicable.’’ 
Content of Notice 

Many commenters responding to the 

RFI identified issues relating to the 
sufficiency of the information provided 
by employees when notifying their 
employers of the need for FMLA leave, 
which is addressed in current 
§ 825.302(c). For example, the National 
Coalition To Protect Family Leave stated 
that ‘‘employees who call in because of 
their own or a family member’s medical 
condition do not necessarily provide 
sufficient information for an employer 
to [determine whether the leave 
qualifies for FMLA protection]. Since 
what constitutes ‘sufficient’ information 
is not clearly defined anywhere in the 
regulations, both employees and 
employers face difficulties in meeting 
their rights and responsibilities under 
the FMLA.’’ Jackson Lewis LLP 
similarly noted that employers 
sometimes have difficulty in identifying 
FMLA-qualifying absences: ‘‘Employers 
are not ‘mind readers’ and they often 
refrain from asking employees why they 
are absent for fear that they may invade 
an employee’s medical privacy. It is also 
na¨ive to think that employers can 
effectively train front line supervisors 
on the myriad of health conditions and 
personal family emergencies that might 
qualify for FMLA protection.’’ 

A number of commenters offered 
suggestions for how the Department 
could clarify what information 
constitutes sufficient notice. Some 
commenters suggested that an 
employee’s leave request should have to 
be in writing, or that the request should

have to specifically mention the FMLA. 
See, e.g., Edison Electric Institute, Miles 
& Stockbridge, P.C., Pierce County, 
Washington, Spencer Fane Britt & 
Browne LLP, and DST Systems, Inc. The 
South Central Human Resource 
Management Association suggested: 
It would eliminate many disputes if an 

employee were required to request leave in 
writing or to follow up an oral request with 
a written request within a reasonable time 
(such as within two work days after returning 
to work in the case of intermittent leave, or 
five work days after requesting leave in the 
event of unforeseen continuous leave). * * * 
It would help both parties immensely if the 
employee were required to mention the 
FMLA when making such a request. 

Other stakeholders expressed a desire 

for more information from employees, 
but stopped short of suggesting a 
requirement that the employee must 
specifically ask for FMLA leave. The 
Williams Mullen law firm suggested 
that the Department should implement 
detailed regulations that provide 
necessary language or actions that must 
be taken by employees to put their 
employers on notice of their intent to 
take FMLA leave. The U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce suggested that employees 
should be required to specify the 
purpose of any instance of FMLA leave, 
such as a doctor’s appointment, 
physical treatment, etc., so that 
employers can assess veracity when 
employees appear to be abusing the 
leave policy. The Association of 
Corporate Counsel proposed that the 
DOL should revise the regulations to 
make clear that an employee’s notice to 
the employer must go beyond merely 
requesting leave and must provide a 
basis for the employer to conclude that 
the requested leave is covered by the 
FMLA. 

One reason employees may provide 

less notice than employers want may be 
employees’ lack of awareness of their 
rights and obligations. As noted above, 
numerous commenters to the RFI 
emphasized that employees remain 
unaware of their rights under the FMLA. 
See comments by National Partnership 
for Women & Families, Madison Gas 
and Electric Company, Legal Aid 
Society-Employer Law Center. As the 
AARP commented, even employees who 
have some general awareness of the law 
do not know the details of the law or 
whether it applies to them. These 
commenters also noted that employers 
fail to provide employees with effective 
information about their rights. 

In light of these comments, the 
Department proposes to retain in 
§ 825.302(c) the standard that an 
employee need not assert his or her 
rights under the FMLA or even mention 

the FMLA to put the employer on notice 
of the need for FMLA leave, but at the 
same time employees must provide 
sufficient information to make an 
employer aware that FMLA rights may 
be at issue. The Department proposes to 
clarify that sufficient information must 
indicate that the employee is unable to 
perform the functions of the job (or that 
a covered family member is unable to 
participate in regular daily activities), 
the anticipated duration of the absence, 
and whether the employee (or family 
member) intends to visit a health care 
provider or is receiving continuing 
treatment. 

The Department believes that this 

proposal will provide employers with 
the information necessary to determine 
whether absences may be covered by the 
FMLA, without being overly 
prescriptive in the wording that an 
employee must use to request leave. The 
proposal will also facilitate the early 
identification of potentially FMLA- 
protected absences. Finally, the 
increased specificity in the proposed 
rule will protect employees from losing 
FMLA rights by inadvertently failing to 
put the employer on notice of the need 
for FMLA leave. The Department also 
proposes to include such information in 
the general notice that employers are 
required to post and either to provide in 
an employee handbook or distribute at 
least annually, as specified in proposed 
§ 825.300(a), to ensure that employees 
are aware of the information they must 
provide. 

This proposed section continues to 
require employers to inquire further if 
they need additional information in 
order to obtain the necessary details 
about the leave. The proposed rule also 
states that employees must respond to 
employers’ inquiries designed to 
determine whether leave is FMLA- 
qualifying or risk losing FMLA 
protection if the employer is unable to 
determine whether the leave qualifies. 
The Department seeks comment as to 

whether a different notice standard 
requiring employees to expressly assert 
their FMLA rights should apply in 
situations in which an employee has 
previously provided sufficient notice of 
a serious health condition necessitating 
leave and is subsequently providing 
notice of dates of leave due to the 
condition that were either previously 
unknown or changed. For example, 
where an employee has taken two weeks 
of FMLA leave for surgery and recovery, 
and then learns that he or she will need 
to undergo physical therapy once a 
week for four to six weeks upon 
returning to work, should the employee 
be required to specifically notify the

employer that the additional leave is 
due to the FMLA-covered condition? 
Usual and Customary Employer 
Procedures 

A number of commenters responding 
to the RFI also addressed the provisions 
in § 825.302(d) regarding compliance 
with employers’ usual and customary 
notice procedures for requesting leave. 
Many employers specifically asserted 
that call-in procedures, which are 
enforced routinely outside the FMLA 
context, can serve as a crucial element 
of an attendance program and are often 
critical to an employer’s ability to 
ensure appropriate staffing levels. In 
discussing the effect call-in 
requirements have on State agencies in 
particular, the Ohio Department of 
Administrative Services commented 
that such procedures are especially 
critical in institutional agencies that 
provide direct care and supervision of 
inmates or patients. A number of 
commenters urged reforming the 
regulations to allow employers to 
enforce attendance policies that require 
employees to observe reasonable call-in 
procedures, including policies that 
require employees to call in to their 
direct supervisors or to a designated 
person in human resources, and to 
allow a penalty for noncompliance. See, 
e.g., comments by American Electric 
Power, Ohio Public Employer Relations 
Association, and National Association 
of Convenience Stores. The University 
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee stated that 
requiring employees to comply with 
regular attendance policies unless there 
is a medical emergency would be 
helpful, because the simple need for 
FMLA leave does not mean that regular 
notification is impossible. 

In response to these comments, the 

proposed revision of § 825.302(d) 
retains the current rule providing that 
an employer may require an employee 
to comply with the employer’s usual 
notice and procedural requirements for 
calling in absences and requesting leave. 
However, the Department proposes to 
eliminate the current language stating 
that an employer cannot delay or deny 
FMLA leave if an employee fails to 
follow such procedures. The 
combination of requiring employees to 
comply with employer absence policies, 
yet prohibiting employers from delaying 
or denying leave if such procedures are 
not met in the current regulation, has 
proved confusing. This confusion has 
been exacerbated by language in the

appropriately delayed because the 
employee did not provide timely notice 
of the need for leave, and the employee 
has an absence during the period in 
which he/she accordingly is not entitled 
to FMLA protection, that absence is 
unprotected and can be treated in the 
same manner the employer would treat 
any other unexcused absence. This is a 
clarification of the ramifications of

at 2221. Cases addressing various types 
of employee call-in procedures, 
including employer requirements that 
employees report absences to specific 
individuals or offices and that they keep 
employers updated regarding their need 
for leave, have analyzed the issue 
differently. Compare, e.g., Bones v. 
Honeywell Int’l Inc., 366 F.3d 869, 878 
(10th Cir. 2004) (‘‘[Employee’s] request 
for an FMLA leave does not shelter her 
from the obligation, which is the same 
as that of any other Honeywell 
employee, to comply with Honeywell’s 
employment policies, including its 
absence policy.’’); Cavin v. Honda of 
America Mfg., Inc., 346 F.3d 713, 723 
(6th Cir. 2003) (‘‘[E]mployers cannot 
deny FMLA relief for failure to comply 
with their internal notice requirements 
[to call a specified department].’’); Lewis 
v. Holsum of Fort Wayne, Inc., 278 F.3d 
706, 710 (7th Cir. 2002) (failure to 
follow three-day no-call rule legitimate 
basis for termination and did not violate 
FMLA); Gilliam v. UPS, 233 F.3d 969 
(7th Cir. 2000) (upholding application of 
three-day no-call rule). 

Accordingly, the Department 

proposes that, absent unusual 
circumstances, employees may be 
required to follow established call-in 
procedures (except one that imposes a 
more stringent timing requirement than 
the regulations provide), and failure to 
properly notify employers of absences 
may cause a delay or denial of FMLA 
protections (as explained in § 825.304). 
Unusual circumstances would include 
situations such as when an employee is 
hospitalized and his/her spouse calls 
the supervisor to report the absence, 
unaware that the attendance policy 
requires that the human resources 
department be called instead of the 
supervisor. However, FMLA-protected 
leave cannot be delayed or denied for 
failure to meet the employer’s timing 
standard where the standard is more 
stringent than those established in 
§ 825.302(a). This proposed revision of 
§ 825.302(d) recognizes that call-in 
procedures are necessary for employers 
to provide proper coverage to run their 
businesses. The proposal also benefits 
employees by ensuring early 
identification and protection of 
absences covered by the FMLA. 

Where FMLA protection is 

failing to provide timely notice, and not 
a change in current law. For example, if 
an employee could have provided two 
weeks notice of a doctor’s appointment 
for treatment of a serious health 
condition, but instead provides only one 
week’s notice of the appointment, the 
employer may delay FMLA-protected 
leave for one week (i.e., if the employee 
could have provided notice on the 7th 
day of the month of an appointment on 
the 21st day, but instead only provides 
notice on the 14th day, the employer 
may delay FMLA leave until the 28th 
day (two weeks after the notice was 
provided)). If the employee does not 
delay the taking of the leave, the 
absence will be unprotected and the 
employer can treat the absence in the 
same manner as any unexcused absence 
(i.e., if the employee in the example 
above is absent on the 21st day, instead 
of delaying the absence until the notice 
period is met, the employer may treat 
the absence as an unexcused absence 
under its normal leave policies). 
Alternatively, the employer would have 
the option of accepting the employee’s 
late notice and counting the leave 
against the employee’s FMLA 
entitlement. See § 825.302(g). 

Proposed § 825.302(g) retains 

language stating that employers may 
waive employees’ FMLA notice 
requirements. The Department proposes 
to delete language, however, stating that 
employers cannot enforce FMLA notice 
requirements if those requirements are 
stricter than the terms of a collective 
bargaining agreement, State law or 
employer leave policy. The example 
provided in current § 825.302(g) of an 
employee substituting paid vacation 
leave and the employer not being able 
to require notice from the employee 
under the FMLA because the vacation 
leave policy does not require advance 
notice has proved confusing because it 
is inconsistent with the employer’s right 
to require notice under the FMLA. 
Accordingly, this language has been 
deleted. Sections 825.700 and 825.701 
address in more detail the interaction 
between the FMLA and the provisions 
of collective bargaining agreements, 
State law, and employer policies. 
Section 825.303 (Employee notice 
requirements for unforeseeable FMLA 
leave) 

Current § 825.303 explains what 

notice an employee must give in the 
case of unforeseeable leave. Specifically, 
current paragraph (a) explains the ‘‘as 
soon as practicable’’ required timing of 
the notice, and current paragraph (b) 
sets forth the method by which notice 
can be given. The Department has heard 
from numerous employers that the 

7910 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

taking of unforeseeable leave is central 
to the administrative problems they 
experience with the FMLA, and the 
SHRM FMLA Survey revealed that in its 
members’ experiences, 60 percent of all 
FMLA leave is unforeseeable leave. 
Indeed, the significant number of cases 
that have been litigated as to what 
constitutes sufficient notice from an 
employee in the case of unforeseeable 
leave confirms the difficulties both 
employers and employees experience 
under the current regulation. See 
Spangler v. Federal Home Loan Bank, 
278 F.3d 847, 852 (8th Cir. 2002) 
(employee, who had made employer 
aware that she had problems with 
depression, gave sufficient notice when 
she called in and indicated she was out 
because of ‘‘depression again’’); Gay v. 
Gilman Paper Co., 125 F.3d 1432, 1434– 
35 (11th Cir. 1997) (husband calling for 
employee and indicating wife in the 
hospital having some tests run was not 
sufficient notice); Carter v. Ford Motor 
Co., 121 F.3d 1146, 1148–49 (8th Cir. 
1997) (employee’s wife calling and 
indicating he would be out because of 
family problems did not provide 
sufficient notice); Barr v. New York City 
Transit Auth., 2002 WL 257823, at *7– 
8 (E.D.N.Y. 2002) (employee calling in 
sick reporting ‘‘swelling and tightness’’ 
in legs and follow-up doctor’s note 
indicating swelling in legs and rapid 
heart beat provided sufficient notice); 
Mora v. Chem-Tronics, Inc., 16 F. Supp. 
2d 1192, 1216–17 (S.D. Cal. 1998) 
(invalidating call-in rule requiring 
employees to call in 30 minutes prior to 
shift in all circumstances); Hendry v. 
GTE North, Inc., 896 F. Supp. 816, 828 
(N.D. Ind. 1995) (employee calling in ill 
with a migraine headache provided 
sufficient notice). 

Employers and their representatives 
also mentioned the timing of employee 
notification of the need for 
unforeseeable intermittent leave as a 
particular problem in their 
administration of the FMLA. For 
example, Spokane County commented 
that it is often not notified that an 
employee is out for a serious health 
condition until after the employee 
returns to work. The Pennsylvania 
Turnpike Commission stated: 

The issue of [employees] failing to notify 

their supervisors promptly that they are 
taking FMLA leave is very prevalent in our 
company. Some employees that are approved 
for intermittent FMLA simply don’t show up 
for work, and then email or call their 
supervisor when the work day is almost over 
to inform them that they are taking FMLA. 
This is extremely frustrating as an employer, 
and there does not ever seem to be a valid 
reason that the employee could not notify the 
supervisor earlier. 

Numerous other employer 

commenters asserted that the ‘‘two day 
rule’’ interpreted in Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA–101 (see 
discussion in § 825.302) is even more 
unworkable in the context of unforeseen 
FMLA leave because the employee is 
not required to report the absence prior 
to the start of his/her shift even where 
it is practicable to do so. See, e.g., 
Southwest Airlines Co. (the two-day 
rule allows employees to remain silent 
when they have the knowledge and 
ability to give timely notice, and it ‘‘fails 
to recognize an employer’s legitimate 
operational need for timely notice’’); 
National Association of Manufacturers 
(employees taking ‘‘unscheduled 
intermittent leave routinely ignore 
mandatory shift call-in procedures (even 
if they are fully able to comply), wait 
two working days * * * and then report 
their absence as FMLA-qualifying’’). 

The National Partnership for Women 

& Families and other employee 
advocates agreed that employees should 
notify their employers about their need 
for leave as quickly as is reasonably 
possible, but asserted that it also is 
important to ensure that employees are 
not penalized unfairly when confronted 
with unexpected emergencies. The 
Center for WorkLife Law similarly noted 
that for ‘‘working caregivers with a 
seriously ill child or family member, 
medical emergencies are a way of life. 
Intermittent FMLA leave allows these 
employees to be available to their 
families when they are needed most 
without the stress of losing their jobs.’’ 
The Legal Aid Society’s Employment 
Law Center noted that chronic illnesses 
are devastating and wreak havoc on 
employees’ lives also, and that the 
FMLA was specifically designed to 
cover such episodic absences. The AFL- 
CIO and the Association of Professional 
Flight Attendants emphasized that 
employees who experience 
unforeseeable absences due to chronic 
conditions are precisely those most in 
need of the FMLA’s protections, because 
their jobs are more in jeopardy than 
those of employees who suffer from a 
longer illness only once every two or 
three years. In explaining the difficulties 
for employees who live with 
unforeseeable health conditions, an 
employee described her personal 
experiences with her daughter’s chronic 
serious health condition: 

My daughter had a major asthma attack 

which caused a bronchial infection, swelling 
and bacteria in her throat. * * * No one is 
capable of predicting an[ ] asthma attack or 
the severity of the attack; I just would like 
the assurance of knowing that if or when the 
situation should arise, I have the time off

required to handle her needs without the 
threat of being * * * terminated. 

In light of the apparent confusion 

with regard to timing and sufficiency of 
the required notice, and the critically 
important nature of this topic, the 
Department proposes to further clarify 
what constitutes timely and sufficient 
notice when the need for leave is not 
foreseeable. 
Timing of Notice When ‘‘Not 
Foreseeable’’ 

In the case of unforeseeable leave, the 

Department proposes to maintain the 
requirement that an employee provide 
notice as soon as practicable under the 
facts and circumstances of the particular 
case. While this is the same standard as 
notice for FMLA leave that is 
foreseeable less than 30 days in 
advance, the Department is aware that 
the employer’s need for prompt notice 
of the need for leave is heightened in 
situations in which the need for leave is 
not foreseeable. It is critical in such 
situations that the employer be notified 
of the employee’s absence promptly so 
that the employer can assure 
appropriate staffing. Accordingly, the 
Department expects that in all but the 
most extraordinary circumstances, 
employees will be able to provide notice 
to their employers of the need for leave 
at least prior to the start of their shift. 

To emphasize the importance of 

notice when the need for FMLA leave 
was unforeseen, the Department 
proposes to add language to § 825.302(a) 
to clarify that it is expected employees 
will provide notice to their employers 
promptly. For example, if an employee’s 
child has a severe asthma attack and the 
employee takes the child to the 
emergency room, the employee would 
not be required to leave his/her child in 
order to report the absence while the 
child is receiving emergency treatment; 
once the child’s medical situation has 
stabilized, the employee can be 
expected to report the absence. 
However, if the child’s asthma attack is 
resolved by the use of an inhaler at 
home followed by a period of rest, the 
employee would be expected to call the 
employer promptly after ensuring the 
child has used the inhaler. The 
Department believes that this proposal 
better balances the needs of employees 
to take unforeseeable FMLA leave with 
the interests of employers and other 
employees. 
Content of Notice When ‘‘Not 
Foreseeable’’ 

In proposed paragraph (b), the 

Department retains the standard that an 
employee need not assert his or her 
rights under the FMLA or even mention

the FMLA to put the employer on notice 
of the need for FMLA leave. However, 
consistent with the proposed changes 
discussed above with respect to 
§ 825.302, the Department proposes to 
require that the employee provide the 
employer with sufficient information to 
put the employer on notice that the 
absence may be FMLA-protected. See 
Sarnowski v. Air Brook Limousine, Inc., 
F.3d—, 2007 WL 4323259, at *3 (3rd 
Cir. 2007) (‘‘In providing notice, the 
employee need not use any magic 
words. The critical question is how the 
information conveyed to the employer is 
reasonably interpreted.’’). Sufficient 
information is defined in the same 
manner as proposed § 825.302(c), which 
is information that indicates that the 
employee is unable to perform the 
functions of the job, the anticipated 
duration of the absence, and whether 
the employee intends to visit a health 
care provider. In addition, because 
issues are frequently raised with 
employees giving notice of unforeseen 
absences by simply calling in ‘‘sick,’’ 
proposed § 825.303(b) clarifies that 
calling in with the simple statement that 
the employee or the employee’s family 
member is ‘‘sick’’ without providing 
more information will not be considered 
sufficient notice to trigger an employer’s 
obligations under the Act in the case of 
unforeseeable leave. Of course, many 
unforeseeable conditions do develop 
and deteriorate over a period of a few 
days, and a condition that did not 
initially appear to be a serious health 
condition may develop into one. The 
employee would be expected to provide 
the employer the additional information 
needed to determine if the serious 
health condition standard is met as it 
became available. 

The Department seeks comment as to 

whether a different notice standard 
requiring employees to expressly assert 
their FMLA rights should apply in 
situations in which an employee has 
previously provided sufficient notice of 
a serious health condition necessitating 
leave and is subsequently providing 
notice of dates of leave due to the 
condition that were either previously 
unknown or changed. 
Complying With Employer Policy When 
‘‘Not Foreseeable’’ 

Proposed § 825.303(c) clarifies that an 

employee must comply with the 
employer’s usual procedures for calling 
in and requesting unforeseeable leave, 
except when extraordinary 
circumstances exist (or the procedure 
imposes a more stringent timing 
requirement than the regulations 
provide), such as when the employee or 
a family member needs emergency

medical treatment. For example, an 
employee who seeks emergency 
treatment at a hospital may not be able 
to comply with the employer’s absence 
reporting procedures if the employee 
does not have the telephone number for 
reporting absences with him or her and 
therefore leaves a message on the 
supervisor’s voicemail (the employee 
may also be unable to comply with the 
employer’s timing requirements due to 
the emergency treatment). In contrast, 
an employee who suffers a flare-up of a 
chronic condition for which rest and 
self-medication are the appropriate 
treatment should be able to comply with 
the employer’s normal absence 
reporting procedure. 

If an employee fails to follow the 

employer’s call-in procedures (assuming 
any required timing is not more 
stringent than required by § 825.303(a)), 
except under extraordinary 
circumstances, then the employee is 
subject to whatever discipline the 
employer’s rules provide for such a 
failure and the employer may delay 
FMLA coverage until the employee 
complies with the rules. For example, 
an employer requires that workers 
needing unscheduled leave call a 
designated call-in number instead of 
leaving a message on the supervisor’s 
voicemail. An employee with a medical 
certification under FMLA for migraines 
leaves a message on the supervisor’s 
voicemail indicating that the employee 
will be absent due to a migraine. Unless 
some extraordinary circumstance 
prevented the employee from complying 
with the employer’s requirement that 
the employee call the designated call-in 
number, the employer may treat the 
employee’s failure to comply with the 
call-in rule in the same manner it would 
normally handle such an infraction. The 
employer may also delay FMLA 
protected leave until the employee 
complies with the call-in procedure. Of 
course, if the employer chooses to delay 
the employee’s FMLA leave until the 
employee complies with the call-in 
procedure, any leave that is not FMLA 
protected may not be counted against 
the employee’s FMLA entitlement. 

Proposed § 825.303(c) also contains 

language from current § 825.303(a) 
stating that employers may not enforce 
advance written notice requirements 
where the leave is due to a medical 
emergency. 
Section 825.304 (Employee failure to 
provide notice) 

Current § 825.304 addresses what 

employers may do if an employee fails 
to provide the required notice for FMLA 
leave. Specifically, current paragraph (a) 
states that an employer may waive 

FMLA notice obligations or its own 
internal rules. Current paragraph (b) 
explains that if 30 days notice is not 
provided to the employer for foreseeable 
leave, an employer may delay the taking 
of FMLA leave for 30 days after the date 
notice is given if no reasonable excuse 
is provided. Current paragraph (c) states 
that leave cannot be delayed if the 
employee was not aware of his or her 
notice requirements or the need for 
leave and its timing were not clearly 
foreseeable to the employee 30 days in 
advance. 

The proposal states the rules 

applicable to leave foreseeable at least 
30 days in advance, foreseeable less 
than 30 days in advance, and 
unforeseeable in different paragraphs for 
purposes of clarity. Specifically, the 
Department proposes language that 
provides practical examples of what it 
means to delay FMLA leave in cases of 
both foreseeable and unforeseeable 
leave, such as a case where an employee 
reasonably should have given the 
employer two weeks notice but instead 
only provided one week notice. The 
proposal provides that in such a case, 
the employer may delay FMLA 
protected leave for one week. The 
proposal also provides that an employer 
can take disciplinary action for the 
employee’s violation of the employer’s 
internal call-in procedures, as long as 
such procedures and discipline are 
applied equally to employees taking 
leave for non-FMLA reasons and the 
procedures do not require more advance 
notice than the standard in § 825.303. 
Finally, the Department proposes to 
retain language from current paragraph 
(c) stating that FMLA leave cannot be 
delayed due to lack of required notice 
if the employer has not complied with 
its notice requirements, which now will 
also include providing the general 
notice in an employee handbook or 
annual distribution, as set forth in 
proposed § 825.300. 
Section 825.305 (Medical certification, 
general rule) 

Current § 825.305(a) sets forth the 
general rule as to when an employer 
may request that an employee provide a 
medical certification form to 
substantiate the need for FMLA leave in 
connection with a serious health 
condition. 

Current § 825.305(b) states that when 

leave is foreseeable and at least 30 
(calendar) days notice has been given, 
‘‘the employee should provide the 
medical certification before the leave 
begins.’’ If that is not possible, then the 
employer must give the employee at 
least 15 calendar days to provide the 
certification, unless it is not practicable

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

to do so despite the employee’s diligent, 
good-faith efforts. 

To help ensure that both employees 
and employers better understand this 
requirement, the Department proposes 
that the time-frame in this section for 
submitting a medical certification be 
modified to clearly apply the 15-day 
standard for both foreseeable and 
unforeseeable leave, consistent with the 
language in current § 825.311(a) and (b). 
The Department solicits comments on 

whether language should be added to 
paragraph (b) of this section that would 
state that an employer must notify the 
employee if the certification has not 
been returned in the 15-day time period, 
and give the employee another seven 
calendar days to provide the 
certification unless it is not practicable 
under the particular circumstances to do 
so despite the employee’s diligent, good 
faith efforts. The Department believes 
that this proposed requirement may be 
necessary in light of Urban v. 
Dolgencorp of Texas, Inc., 393 F.3d 572 
(5th Cir. 2004), a decision which found 
an employee was not entitled to FMLA 
leave because a certification was not 
returned to the employer after a 15-day 
extension was granted to the employee 
to submit the certification. In Urban, the 
employee argued that she did not realize 
that her health care provider had not 
returned the certification to the 
employer. She argued that since it was 
not sent to her employer, she provided 
an ‘‘incomplete’’ certification, and 
therefore should have had an 
opportunity to ‘cure’ the deficiency 
under § 825.305(d). The court rejected 
this argument, finding that a 
certification that was never given to the 
employer was not ‘‘incomplete,’’ and 
therefore the employee could not avail 
herself of the provisions in § 825.305(d). 
The court also observed that, as a policy 
matter, the stated purpose of the FMLA 
was to ‘‘balance the demands of the 
workplace with the needs of families’’ 
and ‘‘to entitle employees to take 
reasonable leave for medical reasons’’ in 
a ‘‘manner that accommodates the 
legitimate interests of employers.’’ The 
court reasoned that ‘‘it would seem 
illogical to require an employer to 
continually notify an employee who 
failed to submit medical certification 
within a specified deadline,’’ observing 
that in the case of Urban, a 15-day 
extension had already been granted. Id. 
at 577. 

Current § 825.305(c) provides that an 

employer should request medical 
certification from the employee within 
two business days of receiving the 
employee notice. Consistent with the 
modifications made to proposed 
§ 825.300, the Department proposes a 

five-business day standard and the 
requirement has been incorporated into 
proposed paragraph (b). 

The Department proposes to create a 

new paragraph (c) entitled ‘‘complete 
and sufficient certification,’’ 
incorporated in part from paragraph (d) 
of the current regulation. The 
Department has retained the standard 
from the current regulations, which 
advises employers that in the case of an 
incomplete certification, they must give 
the employee a reasonable period of 
time to cure any deficiency. The 
Department proposes new language that 
states ‘‘a certification is considered 
incomplete if the employer receives a 
certification, but one or more of the 
applicable entries have not been 
completed.’’ In response to the RFI, 
many commenters, including 
employers, employees, and health care 
providers, expressed dissatisfaction 
with the current medical certification 
process. The Department held a 
stakeholder meeting with 
representatives of each of these groups 
in September 2007. Multiple employers 
commented to the RFI that a 
certification should require not just that 
the form is completed, but that 
meaningful responses are given to the 
questions. See, e.g., National Coalition 
To Protect Family Leave (‘‘If health care 
providers * * * do not provide direct 
responses to the questions, the 
regulations should be modified to 
specify that the certification is not 
considered ‘complete’ for purposes of 
the employee’s certification obligations, 
thereby not qualifying the employee for 
FMLA leave.’’); South Central Human 
Resource Management Association (‘‘We 
recommend the Regulations make clear 
that a ‘complete’ certification is 
required, that meaningful answers have 
to be furnished for all questions, and 
that a certification is ‘incomplete’ if a 
doctor provides ‘unknown’ or ‘as 
needed’ to any question.’’). The 
Department agrees that an adequate 
FMLA certification requires responsive 
answers and therefore also proposes to 
define an insufficient certification as 
one where the information provided is 
‘‘vague, ambiguous or non-responsive.’’ 
The Department proposes to define 
these terms because it is aware that 
employers are unsure in many 
circumstances what the distinction is 
between an incomplete versus an 
insufficient certification, and whether 
they must give an employee another 
opportunity to provide sufficient 
certification when the initial 
certification does not establish that the 
employee has a serious health condition 
or whether they can simply deny FMLA 

leave. The Department believes that by 
defining these terms, employers will 
better understand what triggers their 
obligations to give employees further 
opportunity to provide sufficient 
certification, which will in turn protect 
employees from having employers 
immediately deny them FMLA 
protections based on the initial 
certification provided or deny their 
certifications based on technicalities. 
For example, under the current 
regulation, an employer could interpret 
a ‘‘vague’’ answer to simply be 
insufficient and a basis to deny FMLA 
leave. Under the proposed regulation, 
an employer must allow an employee an 
opportunity to provide sufficient 
certification when the initial 
certification is either incomplete or 
insufficient. 

The Department also proposes to 

clarify the process for curing an 
incomplete or insufficient certification. 
The Department received many 
comments in response to the RFI 
indicating that employers were unsure 
how many opportunities an employee 
must be given to cure an insufficient 
certification. See, e.g., Waste 
Management, Inc. (‘‘The current 
regulation is open to interpretation 
regarding when information is due and 
how much additional time should be 
afforded to employees who do not share 
the FMLA certification forms timely.’’); 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
(‘‘There should be an absolute cut off 
when an employer can require the 
employee to submit a completed 
certification form and the consequence 
of not meeting that deadline is that the 
absence(s) is not covered by FMLA.’’); 
Society for Human Resource 
Management (‘‘HR professionals often 
have difficulty in determining how 
many times an employer must give an 
employee an opportunity to ‘cure’ a 
deficiency, and how long to allow them 
to provide such a complete 
certification.’’). Employees and their 
representatives expressed a related 
concern that some employers repeatedly 
indicated that certifications were 
incomplete but failed to specify what 
additional information was necessary, 
oftentimes necessitating that the 
employee make repeated appointments 
with the health care provider in an 
effort to obtain a complete and sufficient 
certification. See, e.g., An Employee 
Comment (‘‘[I]nsurmountable hurdle 
which many employees encounter is, 
upon application for family leave, the 
Company returns the forms asking for 
‘more information’. Even though the 
employee’s Health Care Provider has 
filled out the application sections

relevant to the illness/injury, the 
Company is able to delay, and many 
times deny, for many weeks and months 
the benefits and protections which the 
Act affords.’’); Association of 
Professional Flight Attendants (‘‘[I]t is 
simply unfair to send FMLA leave 
requests back to the employees and their 
treating health care providers for more 
medical facts, without ever indicating 
what kinds of additional medical facts 
are required before the employer will 
make a determination of medical 
eligibility or medical ineligibility.’’); 
International Association of Machinists 
and Aerospace Workers (‘‘We have 
many members who have their doctors 
fill out the paper work only to be told 
it is not properly filled out. The 
employee fixes that problem and the 
Company tells them there is another 
problem with the paper work. This 
occurs over and over until finally the 
doctor or the employee, or both give 
up.’’) (emphasis in original). To address 
these concerns, proposed § 825.305(c) 
requires that when an employer 
determines that a certification is 
incomplete or insufficient, the employer 
must state in writing what additional 
information is necessary and provide 
the employee with seven calendar days 
to cure the deficiency. Additional time 
must be allowed where the employee 
notifies the employer within the seven 
calendar day period that he or she is 
unable to obtain the additional 
information despite diligent good faith 
efforts. The current regulations provide 
an employee ‘‘a reasonable opportunity’’ 
but no timeframe for curing an 
insufficient certification and the 
Department believes that a clear 
timeframe will be helpful to employees 
and employers. If the deficiencies 
specified by the employer are not 
corrected in the resubmitted 
certification, the employer may deny the 
taking of FMLA leave. Finally, in light 
of the Urban decision discussed above 
and the confusion that exists on this 
issue, language also is proposed that 
specifies that a certification never 
submitted to the employer does not 
qualify as an incomplete or insufficient 
certification but constitutes a failure to 
provide certification. 

Proposed paragraph (d), titled 

‘‘[c]onsequences,’’ now sets forth the 
consequences if an employee fails to 
provide a complete and sufficient 
medical certification, and reiterates the 
standard under the existing regulations 
that an employer may deny leave. It 
clarifies that it is the employee’s 
responsibility either to provide such a 
complete and sufficient certification or 
to furnish the health care provider 

providing the certification with any 
necessary authorization from the 
employee or the employee’s family 
member—such as that required by the 
Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy 
Regulations, 45 CFR Part 160 and 164, 
or any other applicable law—in order 
for the health care provider to release a 
sufficient and complete certification to 
the employer to support the employee’s 
FMLA request. See Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA2005–2–A (Sept. 
14, 2005) (‘‘When requested, medical 
certification is a basic qualification for 
FMLA-qualifying leave for a serious 
health condition, and the employee is 
responsible for providing such 
certification to his or her employer. If an 
employee fails to submit a requested 
certification, the leave is not FMLA- 
protected leave.’’). 

Finally, current § 825.305(e) explains 
the interaction between the employer’s 
sick or medical leave plan and the 
FMLA when paid leave (of any type) is 
substituted for unpaid FMLA leave. The 
current regulation explains that if less 
stringent medical certification standards 
apply to the sick leave plan, those 
standards must be followed when paid 
leave is substituted. The Department 
proposes to delete this section. The 
Department has heard feedback that it is 
unclear what constitutes less stringent 
information and how that information 
would allow an employer to determine 
if the leave should be designated as 
FMLA leave. For example, a plan that 
requires a doctor’s note may be 
considered less stringent or more 
stringent depending on what type of 
information is provided on the note, and 
that information may or may not 
indicate whether the leave is FMLA- 
qualified. See Wage and Hour Opinion 
Letter FMLA–108 (Apr. 13, 2000) 
(finding that certification requirements 
the employer asserted were ‘‘less 
stringent’’ were, in fact, more stringent 
than FMLA requirements). Given this 
confusion, and the fact that Congress 
clearly provided in 29 U.S.C. 2613 that 
an employer could request a medical 
certification to substantiate a ‘‘serious 
health condition’’ as a prerequisite to 
being required to provide FMLA leave, 
the Department proposes to eliminate 
this language. Under the proposed rule, 
if an employee seeks the protections of 
FMLA leave for a serious health 
condition of the employee or qualifying 
family member, an employer has a right 
to have the medical information 
permitted by the statute. Such 
information will best enable an 
employer to determine if the leave is in 
fact FMLA-qualified. In place of the

deleted text of current § 825.305(e), the 
Department proposes to add a provision 
allowing for annual medical 
certifications in those cases in which 
the serious health condition extends 
beyond a leave year. This proposal 
incorporates in the regulation the 
Department’s statement in Wage and 
Hour Opinion Letter FMLA2005–2–A 
(Sept. 14, 2005) that a new medical 
certification may be required once each 
leave year. 
Section 825.306 (Content of medical 
certification) 

The information necessary for a 

sufficient certification is set forth in 
section 103 of the Act. See 29 U.S.C. 
2613(b). The statute states that a 
medical certification ‘‘shall be 
sufficient’’ if it states the following: the 
date the condition commenced; the 
probable duration of the condition; 
‘‘appropriate medical facts’’ regarding 
the condition; a statement that the 
employee is needed to care for a covered 
family member or a statement that the 
employee is unable to perform the 
functions of his/her position (as 
applicable); dates and duration of any 
planned treatment; and a statement of 
the medical necessity for intermittent 
leave or leave on a reduced leave 
schedule and expected duration of such 
leave. Id. 

Current § 825.306 addresses how 
much information an employer can 
obtain in the medical certification to 
substantiate the fact that a serious 
health condition exists. This section 
currently explains that DOL has 
developed an optional form (Form WH– 
380) for employees or their family 
members to use in obtaining medical 
certifications and second and third 
opinions from a health care provider to 
substantiate the existence of a serious 
health condition for purposes of FMLA. 
Passage of HIPAA 

Since the current FMLA regulations 
were issued in 1995, Congress enacted 
the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 1996. 
HIPAA addresses in part the privacy of 
individually identifiable health 
information. The Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) 
promulgated regulations in December 
2000 found at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 
that provide for the privacy of 
individually identifiable medical 
information.15 These regulations apply 
only to ‘‘covered entities,’’ defined as a 
health plan, a health care clearinghouse, 
or a health care provider who transmits 
any health information in electronic 

15 See 65 FR 82462 (Dec. 28, 2000).

form in connection with a transaction as 
defined in the privacy regulations. See 
45 CFR 160.102(a), 160.103. HHS has 
stated that the statute does not include 
‘‘employers per se as covered entities.’’ 
Therefore, the HHS regulations do not 
regulate an employer, ‘‘even when it is 
a covered entity acting as an employer.’’ 
See 67 FR 53192 (Aug. 14, 2002). 

The final regulations issued by HHS 
may have an impact, either directly or 
indirectly, on the medical certification 
process for FMLA purposes. Under the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule, the health care 
provider is permitted to disclose 
protected health information directly to 
the patient. Therefore, if the employee 
has the health care provider complete 
the medical certification form or a 
document containing the equivalent 
information and personally requests a 
copy of that form to take or send to the 
employer, the HIPAA Privacy Rule does 
not and should not impede the 
disclosure of the protected health 
information. If the employee asks the 
health care provider to send the 
completed certification form or medical 
information directly to the employer or 
the employer’s representative, however, 
the HIPAA Privacy Rule will require the 
health care provider to receive a valid 
authorization from the employee before 
the health care provider can share the 
protected medical information with the 
employer. As employers have a 
statutory right to require sufficient 
medical information to support an 
employee’s request for FMLA leave for 
a serious health condition, if an 
employee does not fulfill his or her 
obligation to provide such information 
upon request, the employee will not 
qualify for FMLA leave. See Wage and 
Hour Opinion Letter FMLA2005–2–A 
(Sept. 14, 2005). 
Current Certification Requirements 

With regard to what constitutes 

sufficient medical certification, current 
§ 825.306(b)(1) states that the health 
care provider must identify which part 
of the definition of ‘‘serious health 
condition,’’ if any, applies to the 
patient’s condition, and the medical 
facts which support the certification, 
including a brief statement as to how 
the medical facts meet the criteria of the 
definition. Current § 825.306(b)(2)(i) 
asks for the approximate date the 
serious health condition commenced, 
and its probable duration, including the 
probable duration of the patient’s 
present incapacity (defined to mean 
inability to work, attend school or 
perform other regular daily activities 
due to the serious health condition, 
treatment therefor, or recovery 
therefrom) if different.

Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section asks 

whether it will be necessary for the 
employee to take leave intermittently or 
to work on a reduced leave schedule 
basis (i.e., part-time) as a result of the 
serious health condition (see current 
§§ 825.117, 825.203), and if so, the 
probable duration of such schedule. 
Current paragraph (b)(2)(iii) asks if the 
condition is pregnancy or a chronic 
condition within the meaning of current 
§ 825.114(a)(2)(iii), whether the patient 
is presently incapacitated and the likely 
duration and frequency of episodes of 
incapacity. 

Current paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) asks if 
additional treatments will be required 
for the condition, and an estimate of the 
probable number of such treatments. 
Paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) asks if the 
patient’s incapacity will be intermittent, 
or will require a reduced leave 
schedule, an estimate of the probable 
number of and interval between such 
treatments, actual or estimated dates of 
treatment if known, and period required 
for recovery if any. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) 
asks if any of the treatments will be 
provided by another provider of health 
services (e.g., physical therapist), and 
the nature of the treatments. Paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) asks if a regimen of continuing 
treatment by the patient is required 
under the supervision of the health care 
provider, and if so, a general description 
of the regimen (see current 
§ 825.114(b)). 

Paragraph (b)(4) asks, if medical leave 

is required for the employee’s absence 
from work because of the employee’s 
own condition (including absences due 
to pregnancy or a chronic condition), 
whether the employee: (i) is unable to 
perform work of any kind; (ii) is unable 
to perform any one or more of the 
essential functions of the employee’s 
position, including a statement of the 
essential functions the employee is 
unable to perform (see current 
§ 825.115), based on either information 
provided on a statement from the 
employer of the essential functions of 
the position or, if not provided, 
discussion with the employee about the 
employee’s job functions; or (iii) must 
be absent from work for treatment. 

Paragraph (b)(5)(i) asks, if leave is 
required to care for the employee’s 
family member with a serious health 
condition, whether the patient requires 
assistance for basic medical or personal 
needs or safety, or for transportation; or 
if not, whether the employee’s presence 
to provide psychological comfort would 
be beneficial to the patient or assist in 
the patient’s recovery. The employee is 
required to indicate on the form the care 
he or she will provide and an estimate 
of the time period. Paragraph (b)(5)(ii) 

asks if the employee’s family member 
will need care only intermittently or on 
a reduced leave schedule basis (i.e., 
part-time), and the probable duration of 
the need. 

The RFI sought comments on how the 

current form WH–380 is working and 
what improvements could be made to it 
to facilitate the certification process. 
The Department received significant 
feedback from the stakeholder 
community, including health care 
providers, that the existing form is 
confusing. See, e.g., American Academy 
of Family Physicians (‘‘The form WH– 
380 is overly complicated and confusing 
in its format.’’); United Parcel Service, 
Inc. (‘‘The current WH–380 form is 
poorly drafted and confusing.’’); 
Association of Corporate Counsel (‘‘The 
current form is confusing and often 
results in incomplete or vague responses 
by health care providers that are 
insufficient to assess the employee’s 
eligibility for leave or the timing of the 
leave.’’). Indeed, stakeholders have 
shared with the Department that in a 
number of cases, health care providers 
have refused to complete the 
certification form. As the employee has 
the statutory burden of providing 
sufficient medical information to 
substantiate the need for FMLA leave, 
this confusion poses a serious hardship 
to the employee. Several stakeholders 
also have criticized the form for asking 
health care providers to render legal 
conclusions by certifying whether a 
serious health condition exists as 
defined by the FMLA. 

Several commenters suggested that 
the form could be simplified if it was 
broken into multiple forms, with 
separate forms either for intermittent 
and block leave, or for leave for the 
employee and leave for the employee’s 
family member. See, e.g., Yellow Book 
USA (suggesting separate forms for 
block and intermittent leave); National 
Council of Chain Restaurants 
(suggesting separate forms for employee 
and family members); Spencer Fane 
suggesting forms for: ‘‘(a) continuous 
leave for employee’s own serious health 
condition; (b) continuous leave for 
serious health condition of a family 
member; (c) reduced schedule/ 
intermittent leave for employee’s own 
serious health condition; and (d) 
reduced schedule/intermittent leave for 
serious health condition of a family 
member.’’). A physicians group 
suggested that use of a standard form, as 
opposed to individual employer 
variations, would reduce the burden on 
health care providers. See American 
Academy of Family Physicians; see also 
Kennedy Reeve & Knoll (‘‘The model 
certification form must be simplified,

7915 

and then it must be the required form 
for employers to use.’’). 

In reviewing the criticisms of the 

medical certification form, the 
Department notes that employers have a 
statutory right to obtain sufficient 
medical certification from an employee 
to substantiate the existence of a serious 
health condition. See 29 U.S.C. 2613(a), 
(b). However, the Department believes 
that the form can be simplified to make 
it easier for health care providers to 
understand and complete. The 
Department proposes the following 
revisions to the medical certification 
form, to implement the statutory 
requirements for ‘‘sufficiency’’ of the 
medical certification as set forth in 29 
U.S.C. 2613(b). The Department has 
declined at this time to create multiple 
forms. However, the Department seeks 
feedback as to whether multiple forms 
would be clearer than the revised Form 
WH–380 proposed in this rulemaking 
(see Appendix B to these proposed 
regulations). 
Proposed Certification Requirements 

Before detailing the proposed changes 

to this section, the Department notes 
that the medical certification process 
remains optional for the employer. That 
is, an employer is always free to 
designate qualifying leave as FMLA 
leave without requiring medical 
certification of the underlying 
condition. See 29 CFR § 825.305(a). 

Proposed § 825.306(a)(1) still requires 
that the name and address of the health 
care provider and type of medical 
practice be identified, but also requires 
that the pertinent specialization and fax 
number of the health care provider be 
provided. This addition allows the 
employer to more efficiently contact the 
health care provider for purposes of 
clarification and authentication as 
appropriate and in accordance with 
proposed § 825.307 (discussed below). 
The question of the approximate date on 
which the serious health condition 
commenced and the probable duration 
has been retained in proposed 
§ 825.306(a)(2). 

Consistent with the statute, the 
Department proposes to retain the 
requirement that a complete 
certification contain appropriate 
medical facts regarding the patient’s 
health condition for which FMLA leave 
is requested. See 29 U.S.C. 2613(b)(3). 
The Department also has added 
guidance in this regulatory section as to 
what constitutes sufficient medical facts 
for purposes of responding to this 
question. Specifically, the Department 
proposes that such medical facts may 
include information on symptoms, 
hospitalization, doctors visits, whether 

medication has been prescribed, 
referrals for evaluation or treatment 
(physical therapy, for example) or any 
other regimen of continuing treatment. 
These examples of what constitutes 
sufficient medical facts streamline the 
certification form by eliminating the 
need to ask several other questions that 
are contained in the current regulations, 
specifically those listed in 
§ 825.306(b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(i)(A), (b)(3)(ii), 
and (b)(3)(iii), and are intended to 
simplify the certification process for 
health care providers. 

Proposed § 825.306(a)(3) also states 

that the health care provider may 
provide information on the diagnosis of 
the patient’s health condition. The term 
‘‘diagnosis’’ was specifically not 
included in the 1995 final regulations 
due to concerns expressed under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. See 
Preamble to Final FMLA Regulations, 60 
FR at 2222. As noted, in response to the 
RFI, several commenters specifically 
requested that the Department require 
the employee’s health care provider to 
specify a diagnosis. See, e.g., South 
Central Human Resource Management 
Association (‘‘an employer should be 
permitted to obtain diagnosis and 
prognosis’’); Detroit Medical Center (‘‘It 
is critical that the regulations and WH– 
380 form be changed to require actual 
diagnoses to determine whether an 
employee’s absences correlate with the 
medical certification.’’); MedStar 
Health, Inc. (‘‘[T]he FMLA’s current 
restriction on obtaining a diagnosis 
creates an unnecessary and awkward 
limitation on the employee’s health care 
provider in completing the medical 
certification form and the employer’s 
health care provider in seeking 
clarification of information contained in 
that form. Generally, meaningful 
communications between the health 
care providers cannot take place 
without some discussion about the 
actual diagnosis, particularly if second 
and third opinions are involved.’’). In 
practice, in many cases it may be 
difficult to provide sufficient medical 
facts without providing the actual 
diagnosis, and in some cases the 
employee may prefer that a diagnosis be 
provided as opposed to more detailed 
medical facts. The Department is also 
aware that the diagnosis may often be 
provided in practice under the current 
regulation. For example, many health 
care providers may currently write a 
diagnosis such as ‘‘asthma’’ on the 
certification form instead of describing 
symptoms such as ‘‘intermittent 
difficulty in breathing due to inflamed 
airways.’’ The Department proposes, 
therefore, that such information be

allowed on the FMLA leave certification 
form. However, the Department does not 
intend to suggest, by including such 
language, that a diagnosis is a necessary 
component of a complete FMLA 
certification. If the medical facts set 
forth by the health care provider’s 
medical certification establish the 
necessity for leave due to a serious 
health condition without reference to 
the employee’s diagnosis, a diagnosis is 
not necessary and may not be required. 
The health care provider determines the 
appropriate relevant medical facts in 
any case and the employer determines 
if the certification is complete and 
sufficient to meet the regulatory 
definition of a serious health condition. 
Proposed § 825.306(a)(4) requires that 

the health care provider provide 
sufficient information to establish that 
the employee cannot perform the 
functions of the employee’s job and the 
likely duration of such inability, 
consistent with current § 825.306(b)(4). 

Proposed § 825.306(a)(5) retains the 

requirement currently found in 
§ 825.306(b)(5)(i) that information be 
provided sufficient to establish that the 
employee is needed to care for a family 
member, if applicable. 

Proposed § 825.306(a)(6), (7), and (8) 

address the need for certification in 
connection with the need for reduced 
schedule or intermittent leave for the 
employee’s own serious health 
condition or that of a family member. 
These paragraphs incorporate the 
requirements set forth in current 
§ 825.306(b)(2)(i) and (ii), (b)(3)(i)(B), 
and (b)(5)(ii). In response to the RFI, 
several commenters noted that current 
§ 825.306 and the WH–380 model 
certification form do not require the 
health care provider to certify the 
medical necessity for intermittent leave, 
which is a statutory requirement for the 
taking of such leave under section 
102(b) of the Act. See, e.g., National 
Coalition to Protect Family Leave (‘‘In 
the case of intermittent leave, the 
medical necessity for the intermittent or 
reduced schedule also should be 
specified in accordance with 29 C.F.R. 
§ 825.117 (not currently asked on the 
model form).’’); Society for Human 
Resource Management (same); American 
Electric Power (‘‘Unfortunately, the 
statutory requirement that ‘medical 
necessity’ be demonstrated by 
employees seeking intermittent leave 
has been effectively eliminated by the 
Department’s regulations.’’). Consistent 
with the statutory and the current 
regulatory requirements, the proposed 
section would now clarify that the 
health care provider must certify that 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave 
is medically necessary.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Interaction Between FMLA and 
Employer Policies 

Current paragraph (c) of this section 

provides that an employer cannot 
request all of the information set forth 
above to substantiate the existence of a 
serious health condition if an 
employer’s sick leave plan requires less 
information. Consistent with the change 
made to § 825.305(e), the Department 
proposes to eliminate this language. 
Instead, the proposal incorporates 
language from current § 825.307(a)(1), 
which explains the interaction between 
workers’ compensation and the FMLA 
with regard to the clarification of 
medical information. Specifically, the 
current regulation provides that if a 
workers’ compensation statute provides 
for an employer to have direct contact 
with the workers’ compensation health 
care provider, the employer may do so 
even if the leave also may be designated 
FMLA leave. The Department proposes 
to amend this language to state that if 
the employer is permitted ‘‘to request 
additional information’’ from the 
workers’ compensation health care 
provider, the FMLA does not prevent 
the employer from following the 
workers’ compensation provisions. The 
Department notes that for purposes of 
HIPAA, ‘‘individuals do not have a right 
under the Privacy Rule at 56 CFR 
164.522(a) to request that a covered 
entity restrict a disclosure of protected 
health information about them for 
workers’ compensation purposes when 
that disclosure is required by law or 
authorized by, and necessary to comply 
with, a workers’ compensation or 
similar law.’’ See Department of Health 
and Human Services, Office of Civil 
Rights Publication, ‘‘Disclosures For 
Workers’ Compensation Purposes: 
Frequently Asked Questions,’’ 
December 3, 2002. 

The Department also proposes to add 
language to this section that clarifies the 
interaction between paid leave or 
benefit plans and FMLA leave. 
Consistent with Wage and Hour 
Opinion Letter FMLA2004–3–A (Oct. 4, 
2004), the proposed language in this 
section clarifies that if an employee 
ordinarily is required to provide 
additional medical information to 
receive payments under a paid leave 
plan or benefit plan, an employer may 
require that the employee provide the 
additional information to receive those 
payments, as long as it is made clear to 
the employee that the additional 
information is requested only in 
connection with qualifying for the paid 
leave benefit and does not affect the 
employee’s unpaid FMLA leave 
entitlement. This language reiterates

what is contained in existing 
§ 825.207(d)(1) with regard to temporary 
disability benefit plans and proposed 
§ 825.207(a), although the existing 
regulations do not define what 
constitutes a disability plan. For 
consistency and clarity, the Department 
proposes that all disability and paid 
leave plans be covered by this 
provision. 
Interaction Between FMLA Certification 
and ADA Medical Inquiries 

The Department received comments 
in response to the RFI indicating that 
employers were frustrated and confused 
by the differing processes for gathering 
medical information under the FMLA 
and the ADA. See generally RFI Report, 
Chapter VII, Interplay Between the 
Family and Medical Leave Act and the 
Americans With Disabilities Act, 72 FR 
at 35599. The United Parcel Service, 
Inc. explained the dilemma faced by 
employers: ‘‘When an FMLA-qualifying 
‘serious health condition’ is also a 
potential ‘disability’ under the ADA, 
[§ 825.306’s] restriction on medical 
information is in conflict with the ADA 
interactive process, which allows—and 
arguably requires—an employer to 
gather far more medical information 
regarding an employee so that it can 
make an informed decision regarding 
possible accommodations.’’ See also 
Temple University (‘‘FMLA restrictions 
particularly are problematic when 
employers face a request from an 
employee that triggers obligations under 
both the FMLA and ADA, given that the 
latter requires the employer to engage in 
interactive processes to accommodate 
the employee.’’). The Department 
recognizes that an employee’s request 
for leave due to a serious health 
condition may also trigger the 
interactive process under the ADA to 
determine whether the condition is also 
a disability. The Department therefore 
proposes to add a new § 825.306(d), 
which clarifies that where a serious 
health condition may also be a 
disability, employers are not prevented 
from following the procedures under the 
ADA for requesting medical 
information. 

Finally, the Department received 

comments from employees and their 
representatives indicating that 
employers are incorporating medical 
releases into their FMLA certification 
forms and requiring employees to sign 
the release as a condition of providing 
FMLA leave. See An Employee 
Comment (‘‘Also, my employer [has] 
requested me to sign a medical release 
form for my son’s medical records, or I 
wouldn’t be certified for FMLA.’’); Legal 
Aid Society—Employment Law Center 

(‘‘In some cases, a medical release is 
attached to the FMLA form requesting 
leave, with no explanation of its 
purpose. As a result, many employees 
unwittingly forego their right to medical 
privacy and agree to the unlimited 
disclosure of their entire medical 
history, believing that they must sign 
the release in order to qualify for the 
FMLA.’’); United Steel, Paper and 
Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, 
Energy, Allied Industrial and Service 
Workers International Union (‘‘The 
USW asks the DOL to clarify that 
employees are not required to provide a 
release of medical information to the 
employer as a condition of applying for 
or receiving FMLA leave.’’). In the 
preamble to the current regulations, the 
Department specifically rejected 
suggestions that employees be required 
to sign a release or waiver as part of the 
medical certification process. See 60 FR 
2222 (‘‘The Department has not adopted 
the suggestion that a waiver by the 
employee is necessary for FMLA 
purposes.’’). The Department continues 
to believe that employees should not be 
required to sign a release as a condition 
of taking FMLA leave and has added a 
new § 825.306(e) to clarify this issue. Of 
course, when certification is requested, 
the employee is required to provide the 
employer with a complete and sufficient 
certification and failure to do so may 
result in the delay or denial of FMLA 
leave. 
Section 825.307 (Authentication and 
clarification of medical certification) 
Current § 825.307(a) explains that a 

health care provider working for an 
employer can contact the employee’s 
health care provider with the 
employee’s permission for purposes of 
clarification and authentication of the 
medical certification. Commenters 
raised two major areas of concern in 
their response to the RFI regarding the 
authentication and clarification process: 
(1) The requirement that employers 
obtain employee permission to contact 
the employee’s health care provider, 
and (2) the requirement that a health 
care provider working for the employer 
be utilized to contact the employee’s 
health care provider, rather than 
allowing direct employer contact. 

Several commenters asserted that the 
requirement that an employer obtain the 
employee’s permission prior to seeking 
authentication of the certification from 
the employee’s health care provider 
makes it extremely difficult for 
employers to investigate suspected 
fraud related to medical certifications.

investigating fraud when employee’s 
consent is necessary for the employer to 
authenticate form with employee’s 
health care provider); United States 
Postal Service (suggesting that a ‘‘simple 
and fair way to remedy this problem is 
to allow an employer to make contact 
with the provider for the purpose of 
confirming authenticity’’); Taft, 
Stettinius & Hollister LLP (‘‘Where 
authenticity is suspect, the employer’s 
inquiry is not medically related but 
rather, is intended to determine whether 
the employee’s health care provider 
issued the certificate and that it has not 
been altered. In such circumstances, the 
restrictions contained in Section 
825.307(a) serve no useful purpose, 
impose unnecessary expense on 
employers, and are not justified by any 
language in the Act.’’). The Department 
notes that authentication involves only 
verifying that the certification was 
completed, or authorized, by the 
employee’s health care provider and 
does not involve disclosure of any 
additional medical information. 
Accordingly, proposed § 825.307(a) 
clarifies the limited nature of the 
authentication process and removes the 
requirement of employee consent to 
authenticate the certification. 

Unlike authentication, clarification 
does involve communication with the 
employee’s health care provider 
regarding the substance of the medical 
information contained in the 
certification. Several commenters noted 
that the passage of HIPAA (discussed 
above in § 825.306) has complicated the 
process of clarification of FMLA 
certifications. See, e.g., Methodist 
Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University 
Hospital (‘‘With [HIPAA] regulations 
physicians are reluctant to share 
information with Employers who are 
trying to accommodate Employee 
medical conditions to minimize 
absence.’’); American Academy of 
Family Physicians (‘‘We agree with 
comments that the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) has created confusion about 
the disclosure of information on the 
FMLA form. As employers are not 
covered entities, disclosure directly to 
the employer is prohibited without an 
authorization by the patient.’’); AIG 
Employee Benefit Solutions’ Disability 
Claims Center (‘‘More than one Provider 
has written ‘HIPAA’ across the Form 
and returned it.’’); Briggs & Stratton 
Corporation (‘‘[M]any physicians still 
insist that they are prohibited by 
[HIPAA] from responding to questions 
on the Certification.’’). 

The Department notes that the HIPAA 

Privacy Rule provides far more 
protection for employee medical 

information than current § 825.307(a). 
For example, a valid authorization 
under the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires, 
in part, a written document containing: 
(1) A description of the information that 
may be disclosed; (2) the name or 
specific identification of the person(s) to 
whom the requested disclosure may be 
made; (3) a description of the purpose 
of the requested disclosure; (4) an 
expiration date or event for the 
authorization; and (5) a signature of the 
individual and date. 45 CFR 
164.508(c)(1). In any instance in which 
the employee’s health care provider is 
disclosing medical information to the 
employer, the HIPAA Privacy Rule 
requires that the employee execute a 
valid authorization prior to the 
disclosure. The Department agrees with 
those commenters who suggested that 
the protections afforded to employee 
medical information by the HIPAA 
Privacy Rule have supplanted the 
requirement in current § 825.307(a) for 
employee permission to clarify the 
certification. See Ohio Public Employer 
Labor Relations Association (‘‘With 
HIPAA laws protecting confidential 
medical information, the excessive 
restrictions found in 29 C.F.R. § 825.307 
are unnecessary and should be 
removed.’’); Taft, Stettinius & Hollister 
LLP (‘‘HIPAA and similar laws provide 
ample protection for personal health 
data and the employee’s health care 
provider can always refuse to disclose 
information if he or she considers a 
request for clarification to implicate 
privacy issues.’’); Hewitt Associates LLC 
(‘‘[G]iven HIPAA concerns, it’s likely 
that the employee will still have a check 
over the process as the health care 
provider would require the employee’s 
permission before he or she would 
speak with the employer.’’). 
Accordingly, in lieu of the requirement 
in current § 825.307(a) that the 
employee provide permission for the 
employer to clarify the medical 
certification, the Department proposes 
language highlighting that contact 
between the employer and the 
employee’s health care provider for the 
purpose of clarifying the medical 
certification must comply with the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule. Language has also 
been added to make clear that if such 
consent is not given, an employee may 
jeopardize his or her FMLA rights if the 
information provided is incomplete or 
insufficient. 

The second major area of concern 

raised in the comments to the RFI 
regarding § 825.307(a) was the 
requirement that the employer utilize a 
health care provider to contact the 
employee’s health care provider. Many 

employers commented that the 
requirement that they communicate 
only through a health care practitioner 
resulted in significant cost and delay. 
See, e.g., Milwaukee Transport Services, 
Inc. (‘‘In 2006 alone, MTS spent 
$23,000.00 for the services of a 
designated health care provider because 
it was not itself permitted under the 
FMLA regulations to ask questions 
which that provider was then forced to 
ask on its behalf.’’); City of Portland 
(‘‘The Act requires employers to use the 
employee as an intermediary to 
communicate with doctors or incur 
substantial costs hiring additional 
doctors to consult with employee 
physicians or, in narrow circumstances, 
to give second and third opinions.’’); 
Hewitt Associates LLC (‘‘The employer’s 
engagement of its own health care 
provider is expensive, takes additional 
time and ultimately delays the decision 
to approve or deny a leave request.’’). 
Other commenters suggested that their 
human resources professionals could 
more efficiently clarify the certification 
with the employee’s health care 
provider because they were both better 
versed in the FMLA and more familiar 
with the employee’s job duties and the 
work environment than the employer’s 
health care provider. See, e.g., 
Association of Corporate Counsel 
(‘‘[T]he employer’s staff members—often 
its Human Resources employees—are 
usually more knowledgeable about the 
specific job requirements and other 
information that may be relevant or 
helpful to the employee’s health care 
provider in making his/her 
assessment.’’). Commenters also noted 
that the ADA does not contain a similar 
restriction requiring employers to 
engage medical providers to contact 
employees’ doctors. See, e.g., 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Clark 
Hill PLC; City of New York; Edison 
Electric Instituted. The AFL–CIO, 
however, commented that the use of a 
health care provider was necessary to 
preserve employee privacy. 

The Department has considered the 
comments on this issue particularly in 
light of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and 
has determined that employers should 
be allowed to directly contact the 
employee’s health care provider for the 
purposes of authenticating and 
clarifying the medical certification. 
Accordingly, proposed § 825.307(a) 
eliminates the requirement that the 
employer’s health care provider, as 
opposed to the employer itself, make the 
contact to an employee’s health care 
provider. The Department believes that 
this change would significantly address 
the unnecessary administrative burdens

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

the current requirement creates and, in 
light of the protections provided by the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule, will not 
significantly impact employee privacy. 
The Department notes again, however, 
that such contact by the employer may 
only take place after the employee has 
been afforded the opportunity to cure 
any deficiencies with the certification. 

Current § 825.307(a)(1), which 

addresses rules governing access to 
medical information when a workers’ 
compensation absence also is at issue, 
has been moved to proposed § 825.306 
because that section also addresses what 
medical information an employer can 
obtain in connection with an FMLA 
absence. 

Current § 825.307(a)(2) and (b) cover 

the requirements an employer must 
meet when obtaining a second opinion. 
The existing language of current 
§ 825.307(a)(2) and (b) has been 
incorporated into proposed § 825.307(b), 
titled ‘‘[s]econd opinion’’. Employers 
expressed significant frustration with 
the second and third opinion process in 
responding to the RFI— and questioned 
its utility. Specifically, several 
employers commented on the expense 
involved in the second and third 
opinion process. See, e.g., Honda 
(‘‘Based upon Honda’s experience, 
second and third opinions average over 
$700 per second or third opinion, and 
cost the employees their time.’’); Yellow 
Book USA (asserting that second 
opinions are so expensive they are not 
used). Other commenters noted 
practical concerns regarding finding 
physicians to perform second opinions. 
See, e.g., United States Postal Service 
(‘‘We are experiencing increasing 
difficulty finding physicians who will 
perform a second opinion medical 
exam.’’); FNG Human Resources 
(‘‘Requesting a second opinion is 
neither economically feasible nor 
beneficial in our area. We do not find 
healthcare providers willing to state that 
another provider is incorrect in his/her 
diagnosis.’’). The Department notes that 
the statute itself mandates the second 
and third opinion process, including 
that the employer cannot use a health 
care provider it regularly employs to 
render the second opinion, and that the 
employer bears the costs of the second 
and third opinions. 29 U.S.C. 2613(c), 
(d). Thus, the Department has 
determined that it is not appropriate to 
change the current regulation. In order 
to increase the utility of the second and 
third opinion process, however, the 
Department proposes to add language to 
§ 825.307(b)(1) and (c) requiring the 
employee (or family member) to 
authorize the release of relevant medical 
information regarding the condition for 

which leave is sought from the 
employee’s (or family member’s) health 
care provider to the second or third 
opinion provider. 

The final issue in § 825.307 that 

garnered significant comments and an 
issue which the Department is hearing 
about more is the requirement in current 
§ 825.307(f) that under certain 
circumstances, the employer shall 
accept the medical certification and 
second and third opinions from a 
foreign health care provider. In response 
to the RFI, several commenters stated 
that this requirement has caused 
numerous problems. See, e.g., Spencer, 
Fane, Britt & Browne LLP (‘‘First, 
employers have no idea whether the 
health care provider has training and 
credentials equivalent to U.S.-licensed 
health care providers. Second, it is 
difficult to verify that the foreign health 
care provider even completed the form. 
* * * Third, obtaining a second and 
third opinion is next to impossible 
* * * .’’); U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
(‘‘These companies have had to obtain 
the services of translators and health 
care providers with foreign language 
skills to discuss the certification with 
foreign doctors.’’); Fairfax County Public 
Schools (‘‘Approximately 20% of the 
FCPS FMLA requests are for leave for 
immediate family members who live 
outside the U.S. and have received 
medical diagnoses from individuals of 
unclear medical qualifications.’’). 
Commenters suggested that there should 
be additional requirements for 
certifications for foreign health care 
providers. See, e.g., Spencer, Fane, Britt 
& Browne LLP; U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce; Fry’s Electronics, Inc. At the 
present time, the substance of 
§ 825.307(f) remains unchanged. 
Nevertheless, the Department seeks 
further public comment about what 
specific changes would allow for better 
authentication in this area. 

In order to assist individuals referring 

to the regulations on second and third 
opinions, proposed changes have been 
made to add titles to each paragraph in 
this section. Paragraph (c) is now titled, 
‘‘[t]hird opinion,’’ paragraph (d) is 
titled, ‘‘[c]opies of opinions,’’ paragraph 
(e) is titled ‘‘[t]ravel expenses,’’ and 
paragraph (f) is titled, ‘‘[m]edical 
certification abroad.’’ The timeframe for 
employers to provide employees with 
copies of second and third medical 
opinions upon the employees’ request 
under paragraph (d) is proposed to be 
extended from two to five business 
days, to be uniform with other similar 
timeframes. 

Section 825.308 (Recertifications) 

Current § 825.308 specifies when an 

employer may request subsequent 
recertifications of medical conditions. In 
cases of pregnancy, chronic, or 
permanent/long-term conditions, 
recertifications may be requested no 
more often than every 30 days (and only 
in connection with an absence) unless 
circumstances described in the initial 
certification have changed significantly, 
or the employer receives information to 
cast doubt on the employee’s stated 
reason for the absence. If the time 
period specified by the health care 
provider for the duration of the 
incapacity or its treatment is longer than 
30 days, an employer may not request 
recertification until the minimum 
duration has passed, unless the 
employee requests an extension of 
leave, circumstances have changed 
significantly, or an employer has 
received information that casts doubt on 
the validity of the certification. This 
same rule applies to intermittent leaves 
of absence. If no time period is specified 
and the condition is other than 
pregnancy, chronic, or long-term or 
permanent, an employer can request 
recertification every 30 days or more 
frequently if the employee requests an 
extension of leave, circumstances have 
changed significantly, or an employer 
has received information that casts 
doubt on the validity of the certification. 

The Department proposes to re- 
structure § 825.308 for the sake of 
clarity. Proposed paragraphs (a), (b), and 
(c) now clearly apply to all medical 
conditions and work in conjunction 
with each other. Paragraph (a), titled 
‘‘30-day rule,’’ merely states a general 
rule that an employer may request 
recertification no more often than every 
30 days and only in connection with the 
absence of the employee. This rule is 
subject to the more specific occurrences 
described in paragraphs (b) and (c). 

Paragraph (b), titled ‘‘[m]ore than 30 

days,’’ explains, consistent with the 
existing regulation, that if a minimum 
duration for the period of incapacity is 
specified, the employer may not request 
recertification until that time period has 
expired, but adds that in all cases, 
recertifications may be requested every 
six months. An example has been 
provided to give further guidance on 
this issue. This proposal addresses 
situations where a certification is 
provided that states an employee may 
be incapacitated and in need of 
intermittent leave for an extended 
period. There is confusion under the 
existing requirements as to whether an 
employer would be able to obtain 
recertification in a given year absent a

significant change in circumstance or a 
reason that casts doubt on the validity 
of the absence where the certification 
indicates that the duration of the 
condition is ‘‘lifetime.’’ Conversely, 
under current law, where an employee 
has a chronic condition certified to last 
an ‘‘indefinite’’ period of time, that 
certification may be treated as having no 
durational timeframe and the employer 
may require a recertification every 30 
days in connection with an absence. See 
Wage and Hour Opinion Letter 
FMLA2004–2–A (May 25, 2004). 

In response to the RFI, some 

employers argued that recertification 
should be permitted every 30 days even 
where the certification indicates that the 
condition will last for an extended 
duration. See, e.g., University of 
Minnesota (‘‘In all cases, employers 
should have the right to request 
recertification from an employee on 
FMLA leave every thirty days.’’); 
Carolyn Cooper, FMLA Coordinator, 
City of Los Angeles (‘‘A remedy to this 
manipulation or gaming of the medical 
recertification restriction pertaining to 
intermittent/reduced work schedule 
leaves is to allow employers to request 
recertification every 30 days, regardless 
if the duration indicated in the initial 
medical certification is greater than 30 
days.’’) (emphasis in original); United 
Parcel Service, Inc. (‘‘As currently 
drafted, [the] language permits 
employees to evade the 30-day 
recertification requirement by having 
their health care provider specify a 
longer period of time.’’). Employees and 
their representatives, however, 
commented that frequent recertifcations 
are burdensome for employees. See, e.g., 
International Association of Machinists 
and Aerospace Workers (‘‘[O]ur 
members find that the requirement to 
recertify every 30 days is incredibly 
burdensome. * * * [I]t is very 
expensive for employees to get re- 
certifications. Some employees, 
particularly in rural areas, have to travel 
long distances to even see their doctor. 
It is ironic that often these employees 
actually have to miss more work time 
just to get the recertification.’’); An 
Employee Comment (‘‘For an employer 
to repeatedly request for recertifications 
every 30 days, for an chronic Asthmatic 
who has an unforeseeable mild flare-up 
that can be taken care of with 
prescription medication, seems 
unreasonable and repetitious.’’); 
Kennedy Reeve & Knoll (‘‘The frequency 
with which some employers are 
requiring notes and recertification is 
both logistically (due to the availability 
of doctor’s appointment times) and 
financially burdensome on the

employee and physician.’’). The 
American Academy of Family 
Physicians also objected to allowing 
recertifications every 30 days for 
conditions that are medically stable: 
‘‘This is a burden to physicians who 
must spend time completing the form to 
indicate that a chronic condition is still 
being managed. It would lessen this 
burden to allow recertification only for 
those conditions which are not 
categorized as chronic care or 
permanent disability.’’ See also Mark 
Blick DO, Rene Darveaux MD, Eric 
Reiner MD, Susan R. Manuel PA-C 
(‘‘One employer requires us to complete 
the form every 60 days (ATT/SBC), one 
employer every 90 days and another 
every year. Chronic conditions 
extending a patient’s lifetime such as 
diabetes and hypertension are not going 
to change and there is no reason the 
form has to be updated multiple times 
throughout the year.’’); An Employee 
Comment (‘‘[E]ven though my mother’s 
illness is terminal and my father’s 
condition is considered lifetime, I still 
am required to fill out forms and have 
a doctor sign them every 3 months. The 
physician’s office now charges me $20 
for each form I have to have them sign. 
As you can imagine, this takes a lot of 
time and money.’’). 

Taking all of the comments into 

consideration, the Department believes 
that it would be reasonable for 
employers to obtain recertifications 
every six months in circumstances in 
which the certification indicates that the 
condition will last for an extended 
period of time. An extended period of 
time includes not only specific months 
or years (e.g., one year) but certified 
durations of ‘‘indefinite,’’ ‘‘unknown,’’ 
or ‘‘lifetime.’’ This is a change in the 
law from the current construction as 
explained above and expounded in 
Wage and Hour Opinion Letter 
FMLA2004–2–A (May 25, 2004). The 
Department feels six months is a 
reasonable timeframe for permitting 
recertification of such conditions but 
requests comments on this proposal. 
This is also consistent with the 
Department’s proposal in § 825.115(c) 
that ‘‘periodic’’ visits to a health care 
provider for a chronic serious health 
condition is defined as at least twice per 
year. 

Proposed paragraph (c) of this section 

explains, with some modifications to 
the current rule, what circumstances 
must exist to request medical 
recertification in less than 30 days and 
is now titled ‘‘[l]ess than 30 days.’’ The 
proposed paragraph explains that 
recertification may be requested in less 
than 30 days if the employee requests an 
extension of leave, the circumstances 

have changed significantly based on the 
duration or frequency of the absence or 
the nature or severity of the illness, or 
if the employer receives information 
that casts doubt upon the employee’s 
stated reason for the absence or the 
continuing validity of the certification. 
The remaining provisions of the existing 
regulation have been incorporated 
without any substantive changes. 
However, examples have been added to 
illustrate what constitutes a change in 
circumstances or information that 
would ‘‘cast doubt.’’ See also Wage and 
Hour Opinion Letter FMLA2004–2–A 
(May 25, 2004) (noting that a pattern of 
Friday/Monday absences would permit 
an employer to request recertification in 
less than 30 days provided that there 
was no evidence of a medical basis for 
the timing of the absences). 

No changes have been proposed to 

paragraph (d) from the current 
regulations except it is titled, 
‘‘[t]iming.’’ 

A new paragraph (e) has been 
proposed, titled ‘‘[c]ontent,’’ that 
confirms an employer may ask for the 
same information when obtaining 
recertification as that permitted for the 
original certification as set forth in 
current § 825.306. In addition, 
consistent with Wage and Hour Opinion 
Letter FMLA2004–2–A (May 25, 2004), 
the proposed regulation states that as 
part of the information allowed to be 
obtained on recertification, the 
employer may provide the health care 
provider with a record of the employee’s 
absence pattern and ask the health care 
provider if the serious health condition 
and need for leave is consistent with 
such a pattern. 

Proposed paragraph (f) sets forth 
without change the requirements of 
current § 825.308(e) that the employee is 
responsible for the costs associated with 
the recertification and that no second or 
third opinion may be required. The 
Department notes that several 
employers responding to the RFI 
requested that the Department allow 
second and third opinions on 
recertifications. See, e.g., United States 
Postal Service (‘‘[A] second opinion 
should be allowed during the lifetime of 
an employee’s condition, so long as 
there is reason to doubt the validity of 
the information in the certification.’’); 
Air Transport Association of America, 
Inc. and Airline Industrial Relations 
Conference (‘‘Second and third opinions 
should also be available to employers on 
a medical recertification.’’). The 
National Partnership for Women & 
Families, however, argued that the fact 
that the statute only refers to second and 
third opinions on initial certifications 
supports the current regulatory

prohibition on second and third 
opinions on recertification. However, 
both Honda and the AFL-CIO noted that 
employers are already permitted to 
reinitiate the certification process on an 
annual basis, which offers the employer 
the opportunity to seek a second 
opinion annually. See supra discussion 
of proposed § 825.305(e). The 
Department believes that allowing 
employers to request a new medical 
certification on an annual basis (and a 
second and third opinion, if 
appropriate) allows employers sufficient 
opportunity to verify the serious health 
condition. Accordingly, the Department 
has retained the regulatory prohibition 
on second and third opinions on 
recertification, but seeks comment about 
this in light of the restructuring of 
§ 825.308. 
Section 825.310 (Fitness-for-duty 
certification) 

Current § 825.310 explains when an 
employer may require an employee to 
provide a fitness-for-duty certification. 
Current paragraph (a) of this section 
explains that employers may have a 
uniformly applied policy or practice 
that requires similarly situated 
employees who take leave to provide a 
certification that they are able to resume 
work. The Department proposes to add 
a sentence to paragraph (a) clarifying 
that employees have the same obligation 
to provide a complete certification or 
provide sufficient authorization to the 
health care provider to provide the 
information directly to the employer at 
the fitness-for-duty stage as they do in 
the initial certification stage. 

No changes have been proposed to 
paragraph (b), which explains that if 
State or local law or the terms of a 
collective bargaining agreement govern 
an employee’s return to work, those 
provisions apply, and that the ADA 
requires that any return-to-work 
physical be job-related and consistent 
with business necessity. The court in 
Harrell v. USPS, 445 F.3d 913, 926–27 
(7th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 845 
(2006), deferred to this regulation, 
holding that it reasonably implements 
the statute and is consistent with the 
legislative history by providing that a 
collective bargaining agreement ‘‘may 
impose more stringent return-to-work 
requirements on the employee than 
those set forth in the statute.’’ 

Current paragraph (c) of this section 
explains the procedures for obtaining a 
fitness-for-duty certification and states 
that an employer may seek certification 
only with regard to the condition that 
caused the employee’s need for leave. 
The existing regulation provides that the 
certification itself need only be a simple 

statement of ability to return to work. It 
also provides that a health care provider 
employed by the employer can contact 
the employee’s health care provider 
with the employee’s permission for 
purposes of clarifying the employee’s 
fitness to return to work, that no 
additional information may be acquired, 
and that the employee’s reinstatement 
may not be delayed while contact with 
the health provider is made. A number 
of commenters responding to the RFI 
addressed the ‘‘simple statement’’ rule. 
Some employers noted that particular 
safety concerns inherent in their 
workplaces necessitated that they obtain 
clear information regarding an 
employee’s ability to safely return from 
leave. For example, Union Pacific 
Railroad Company noted that clear 
information regarding its employees’ 
ability to work is critical as ‘‘those very 
employees are entrusted with jobs that 
affect the safety and security of the 
general public.’’ The Association of 
American Railroads also stated that 
‘‘returning an employee to work is not 
a ‘simple’ process in cases where the 
employee performs a safety sensitive 
job.’’ Therefore, it recommended that 
the Department should ‘‘define a return 
to work ‘certification’ in such a way as 
to allow employers to require a detailed 
certification similar to what is required 
when an employee first requests FMLA 
leave.’’ Similarly, the Maine Pulp & 
Paper Association stated: 

Employees in the paper industry routinely 

work with hazardous materials in close 
proximity to heavy machinery. Forcing 
employers to accept the employee’s medical 
provider’s simple statement that the 
employee ‘‘is able to resume work,’’ or worse, 
in the case of an intermittent leave-taker, 
accept the employee’s word alone with no 
medical verification whatsoever jeopardizes 
the safety of co-workers and increases 
exposure to expensive workers’ 
compensation claims. MPPA’s members have 
strong safety programs which should not be 
undercut by administrative requirements of 
the FMLA. 
Jackson Lewis LLP stated that the 
‘‘simple statement’’ provision allows 
employees to present ‘‘cursory and 
conclusory notes asserting, without any 
factual explanation, that they are 
‘cleared to return to work without 
restrictions.’ Employers must ignore 
facts suggesting employees are not 
qualified to perform their jobs or might 
pose a direct threat of harm to 
themselves or others.’’ The National 
Coalition To Protect Family Leave also 
noted that ‘‘the inability of an employer 
to obtain more than a ‘statement’ that 
the employee can return to work, and 
lack of opportunity to challenge such a 
statement, creates risk for everyone 

involved.’’ The Coalition and a number 
of other commenters stated that the 
return to work process under the FMLA 
conflicts with the return to work process 
under the ADA, with the latter 
providing a better model because it 
allows both more substantive 
information and physical examinations. 

In contrast, as explained in more 

detail with regard to paragraph (g) of 
this section, several commenters 
representing employees, including the 
National Partnership for Women & 
Families, cautioned that altering the 
fitness for duty certification procedures 
under the FMLA would place an 
‘‘unwarranted burden’’ on employees. 
The proposed regulation retains the 

basic fitness-for-duty certification 
procedures, but states that for purposes 
of authenticating and clarifying the 
fitness-for-duty statement, the employer 
may contact the employee’s health care 
provider consistent with the procedures 
set forth in § 825.307 above. The 
proposal also replaces the requirement 
that the certification must only be a 
‘‘simple statement’’ with the statutory 
language that the employee must obtain 
a certification from his or her health 
care provider that the employee is able 
to resume work. The employer may 
provide the employee with a list of the 
employee’s essential job duties together 
with the eligibility notice, in which (as 
provided for in proposed 
§ 825.300(b)(3)(v)) the employer advises 
the employee of the necessity for a 
fitness-for-duty certification. If the 
employer provides such a list of 
essential functions, it may require the 
employee’s health care provider to 
certify that the employee can perform 
them. When providing a fitness-for-duty 
certification, the health care provider 
therefore must assess the employee’s 
ability to return to work against these 
identified essential functions. However, 
if the employer wants the health care 
provider to consider a list of essential 
functions, it must provide them with the 
eligibility notice; providing the list at a 
later date could force the employee to 
make an extra visit to the health care 
provider or to incur extra expense or 
delay. The statement in the current 
regulations that no additional 
information may be acquired has been 
deleted, as the process of clarifying the 
fitness-for-duty certification may result 
in the employer obtaining additional 
information not initially provided on 
the fitness-for-duty certification. But the 
employer may not request or require 
additional information in a certification 
to establish fitness-for-duty than is 
specified under these regulations. 

The Department also requests further 
input concerning the appropriate level

of information that may be obtained and 
the process that employers may follow 
in connection with a fitness-for-duty 
certification. This includes, but is not 
limited to, whether additional 
information or procedures (such as a 
second and third opinion process) 
should be permitted where an employer 
has reason to doubt the validity of the 
fitness-for-duty certification. Although 
the Department did not ask specific 
questions regarding these topics in the 
RFI, some commenters did address 
them. For example, the Association of 
Corporate Counsel suggested that 
employers should be permitted to 
require an employee returning from 
FMLA leave to undergo a return to work 
physical conducted by the employer’s 
physician, so long as the employer 
regularly requires such a physical for all 
employees returning to work. The Ohio 
Department of Administrative Services 
and the National Council of Chain 
Restaurants stated that employers 
should be allowed to get a second 
opinion on a return to work certification 
when they have reason to doubt the 
validity of the release. Briggs & Stratton 
Corporation similarly suggested that an 
employer should be permitted, ‘‘at its 
expense, to require verification of the 
treating health care providers’ return to 
work certification,’’ arguing that the 
current prohibition impedes an 
employer’s ability to fulfill its OSHA 
obligation to provide a safe work place. 
The National Coalition To Protect 
Family Leave also stated that the 
prohibition on second and third 
opinions on fitness for duty 
certifications is ‘‘problematic from a 
safety perspective’’ and conflicts with 
the ADA process. Therefore, it suggested 
that employers should be able to 
challenge a certification obtained from 
an employee’s health care provider and 
‘‘to delay the employee’s return to work 
pending receipt of a second opinion if 
the employer has a reasonable basis to 
believe that the employee may not be 
able to safely return to work and 
perform all the essential functions of the 
job.’’ The Department is proposing no 
changes in this area, but requests further 
comments on these issues. 

The Department proposes no changes 
to current paragraph (d) of this section, 
which explains who bears the cost of 
the fitness-for-duty certification. Under 
both the current and proposed 
regulations, the employee is responsible 
for the cost of obtaining a fitness-for- 
duty certification. 

Current paragraph (e) of this section 

explains that advance notice of the need 
to provide a fitness-for-duty certification 
must be given when an employee goes 
out on leave. It also requires that if an

employer has a handbook, the employer 
should include its general policy with 
regard to fitness-for-duty certifications. 
The current regulations further provide 
that no second or third opinions on 
fitness-for-duty certifications may be 
required. The Department proposes to 
modify this section by specifying that 
the notice of the fitness-for-duty 
certification requirement is to be 
provided in the eligibility notice set 
forth in proposed § 825.300(b). 

Current paragraph (f) of this section 
provides that an employer may delay 
restoration to employment until an 
employee submits a required fitness-for- 
duty certification unless the employer 
has failed to provide the notice required 
by paragraph (e). This language has been 
retained in the proposed regulations. 
The Department proposes, however, to 
add language, consistent with current 
§ 825.311(c), to make clear that the 
employee is not entitled to the 
reinstatement protections of the Act if 
he or she does not provide such a 
requested certification or request 
additional FMLA leave. 

Current § 825.310(g) provides that an 

employer cannot obtain a fitness-for- 
duty certification when an employee 
returns from an intermittent leave 
absence. Numerous commenters 
responding to the request for 
information addressed this provision. 
The employer comments indicate that 
the primary purpose of requiring a 
fitness-for-duty certification is to make 
sure the employee is able to resume 
work safely without harming the 
employee, co-workers, or the public. 
When leave is taken intermittently, 
employers state that they may need to 
determine whether the employee is fit 
for duty when safety concerns are at 
issue, the same as when an employee 
returns from a block of leave. For 
example, the United States Postal 
Service stated: 

Exempting chronic conditions from return 
to work clearance seems to make little sense 
because those conditions are just as likely as 
any other to compromise the health or safety 
of the workforce. Indeed, some chronic 
conditions are even more likely to give rise 
to a justifiable need for return to work 
clearance than the other serious health 
conditions under the FMLA. For example, an 
employer may have little concern about the 
clerical assistant returning to work after 
giving birth, but far more (and legitimate) 
concern about allowing a utility worker to 
return after a series of epileptic seizures on 
the job. 

puts the employee and his/her co- 
workers at risk and requires the 
employer to assume a legal risk for 
liability, if there is an accident caused 
by the reinstated employee.’’ Therefore, 
Honda suggested that employers should 
be permitted to require a fitness-for-duty 
form for employees returning from 
intermittent leave, but only ‘‘when it is 
consistent with the employer’s 
‘uniformly-applied policy or practice’ 
applicable to all similarly-situated 
employees [the general standard for 
fitness-for-duty certifications in 
§ 825.310(a)].’’ The City of New York 
commented that ‘‘Fitness for Duty 
Certifications for employees in safety- 
sensitive positions who are 
intermittently absent should be an 
option for employers. For example, if a 
sanitation worker responsible for 
driving a two-ton truck on public 
roadways takes intermittent leave to 
treat high blood pressure, a fitness for 
duty certification should be required 
before the employee is restored to the 
position which carries an extreme 
responsibility to the public.’’ Dallas 
Area Rapid Transit similarly stated that 
allowing employers ‘‘to request a 
Fitness for Duty certification [for 
employees returning from intermittent 
leave] would protect the safety of both 
the employee and the public, and 
support the employer’s efforts and 
regulatory requirement to provide a safe 
workplace, while also providing a safe 
efficient service to its customers.’’ Such 
employers suggested that the FMLA 
return to work process undercuts 
legitimate employer safety programs. 
Therefore, numerous commenters, 
including Willcox & Savage, Foley & 
Lardner LLP, the National Retail 
Federation, the National Council of 
Chain Restaurants, and the National 
Coalition to Protect Family Leave, 
suggested that the Department should 
delete or revise this section of the 
regulations so that employers would 
have the same right to seek fitness for 
duty certifications from employees 
returning to work from intermittent 
leave as they do for block leave. 
Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP suggested 
that fitness-for-duty certifications 
‘‘could be regulated to prevent abuse by 
the employer by limiting such 
statements to certain time frames, such 
as once a quarter. It could also be based 
on the frequency of the intermittent 
leave; the more frequent the leave, the 
more frequent the statement.’’ 

Honda similarly stated that, ‘‘[i]n 

manufacturing, many of the jobs include 
safety-sensitive duties. Therefore, the 
current regulation prohibiting a fitness- 
for-duty form for intermittent leaves 

However, numerous commenters 
representing employees vigorously 
supported the existing regulation. The

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

employees returning from intermittent 
leave to provide fitness for duty 
certifications—which are at the 
employee’s expense—would 
significantly undermine the statutory 
purpose behind allowing employees to 
take intermittent leave. It stated that 
‘‘[a]ny benefit to the employer of 
obtaining fitness for duty statements 
from intermittent leave-takers is far 
outstripped by the unwarranted burden 
that such a change in the regulations 
would impose on employees. * * * The 
intermittent leave option helps to take 
some of the financial strain off 
employees by enabling them to continue 
earning a paycheck while addressing 
serious health or family needs, and 
allows employees to preserve as much 
of the twelve weeks of leave as 
possible.’’ The American Federation of 
Teachers, Local 2026, stated that 
‘‘[t]here is no reason to disturb the 
current rule barring employers from 
requesting fitness for duty statements 
from workers who take intermittent 
leave.’’ The AFL–CIO noted that 
‘‘[r]equiring employees who take 
intermittent leave to present fitness for 
duty certifications for potentially every 
absence is burdensome and 
unnecessary.’’ The Pennsylvania Social 
Services Union, SEIU 668, concurred, 
stating that there is no reason to disturb 
the current rule. Kennedy Reeve & Knoll 
commented that ‘‘the logistical 
impossibility and financial burdens of 
allowing employers to require fitness- 
for-duty statements for each and every 
day of absence make such a policy not 
feasible.’’ The National Business Group 
on Health also stated that ‘‘[i]t would be 
an administrative headache to require a 
fitness for duty statement from an 
employee who is absent intermittently. 
The added paperwork to cover this 
would be overly burdensome.’’ The 
Indiana State Personnel Department, 
Employee Relations Division, also 
recognized that the burden of providing 
fitness for duty certifications after every 
intermittent absence would be 
significant for employees and health 
care providers, but beneficial to 
employers. In an attempt to address the 
cost concern, the United Parcel Service 
suggested that employers bear the cost 
of fitness for duty certifications when 
the employee is returning from 
intermittent leave. 

The Department believes, as the 

comments from employee 
representatives assert, that it would be 
unduly burdensome on employees to 
have to provide a fitness-for-duty 
certificate for each intermittent leave 
absence. However, the numerous 
employer comments addressing the 

significant safety risks that can exist 
when some employees return from 
intermittent leave absences indicate that 
the current regulation does not 
appropriately address those concerns. 
Therefore, the Department proposes that 
an employer be permitted to require an 
employee to furnish a fitness-for-duty 
certificate every 30 days if an employee 
has used intermittent leave during that 
period and reasonable safety concerns 
exist. For example, if an employee is out 
periodically for high blood pressure, 
and the employee operates heavy 
equipment as part of the employee’s 
essential functions, an employer may 
have reason to get certification that the 
employee can perform the essential 
functions of the job. The employer may 
not terminate the employment of the 
employee while awaiting such a 
certification of fitness for duty for an 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave 
absence. The Department is cognizant of 
the potential burdens on employees 
who may need to provide both a 
recertification and a fitness-for-duty 
certificate within a short period of time. 
The Department specifically seeks 
comment on ways to minimize this 
burden and asks whether this proposal 
strikes the appropriate balance. 

Current paragraph (h) of this section 
would be deleted to avoid redundancy. 
This paragraph, which provides an 
explanation as to the repayment of 
health insurance premiums if the 
employee is unable to return to work as 
a result of a continuation of a serious 
health condition, is duplicative of the 
provisions set forth in § 825.213. The 
last sentence of current § 825.310(h), 
which explains who bears the cost of 
the certification in such circumstances, 
is moved to proposed § 825.213(a)(3). 
Section 825.311 (Failure to provide 
medical certification) 

Current § 825.311(a) provides that, in 

the case of foreseeable leave, if an 
employee fails to provide medical 
certification in a timely manner, the 
employer may delay the taking of FMLA 
leave until it has been provided. In 
response to the RFI, Foley & Lardner 
LLP noted that the regulation ‘‘does not 
explain how long the delay may last or 
what the consequences of a ’delay’ can 
be.’’ The Department agrees and 
proposes to explain more clearly the 
implications of an employee’s failure to 
provide the medical certification in a 
timely manner. Currently, the regulation 
states that an employer may ‘‘delay the 
taking of FMLA leave.’’ If the employee 
takes leave without timely providing a 
sufficient medical certification for 
foreseeable leave, then any leave during 
the time period that the certification 

was ‘‘delayed’’ is not FMLA-protected. 
To make sure both employees and 
employers understand the intended 
meaning of this provision, the 
Department proposes to amend the 
wording to state that the employer may 
‘‘deny FMLA coverage’’ for the period at 
issue. This proposed language ensures 
that there is no misunderstanding as to 
the impact of the ultimate failure to 
provide a medical certification in a 
timely manner, but substantively this is 
not a change from the current 
regulation. See current § 825.312(b) (‘‘If 
the employee never produces the 
certification, the leave is not FMLA 
leave.’’); see also Sherman & Howard 
LLC (‘‘The regulations should make 
clear that if an employee does not 
ultimately qualify for FMLA leave, or 
fails to provide medical certification to 
support the requested leave, the 
employee’s absence will be unprotected. 
This means that the employer may 
appropriately enforce its attendance 
policy which may result in disciplinary 
action being taken against the 
employee.’’). Proposed paragraph (a) is 
titled ‘‘[f]oreseeable leave.’’ Current 
§ 825.311(b) contains similar language 
to current paragraph (a) with regard to 
unforeseeable leave. The Department 
proposes language similar to that 
proposed in paragraph (a), to be titled 
‘‘[u]nforeseeable leave,’’ in proposed 
§ 825.311(b). Section 825.311(b) is 
proposed to be reworded for purposes of 
clarity, but no other substantive changes 
have been made. The Department 
proposes a new paragraph (c), to be 
titled ‘‘[r]ecertification,’’ that addresses 
the consequences of failing to provide a 
timely recertification when requested by 
the employer. The proposed regulations 
provide that if a recertification is not 
provided within 15 days of the request, 
or as soon as practicable, the employer 
may deny the continuation of the FMLA 
leave protections until the 
recertification is provided. Former 
paragraph (c) is moved to proposed 
paragraph (d) but no changes have been 
made in the requirement to provide 
medical certification that an employee 
is fit for duty and able to return to work 
when seeking reinstatement following 
FMLA leave for a serious health 
condition. 
Section 825.312 (When can an employer 
refuse reinstatement) 

Current § 825.312(a) through (f) 

address when an employer can delay or 
deny FMLA leave to an employee, or 
deny reinstatement after FMLA leave, 
when an employee fails to timely 
provide the required notifications and 
certifications set forth in the regulations.

§§ 825.400 through 825.600 other than 
to the titles of the sections and very 
minor editorial changes (adding a 
reference to the Department’s website in 
proposed § 825.401(a), updating the 
reference in proposed § 825.500(c)(4) to 
the new employer eligibility notice 
requirement proposed in § 825.300(b), 
and deleting a cross-reference in 
proposed section 825.601(b)). 
Subpart G—Effect of Other Laws, 
Employer Practices, and Collective 
Bargaining Agreements on Employee 
Rights Under FMLA 
Section 825.700 (Interaction with 
employer’s policies) 

Current § 825.700(a) provides that an 

employer may not diminish the rights 
established by the FMLA through an 
employment benefit program or plan, 
but that an employer may provide 
greater leave rights than the FMLA 
requires. As noted previously, the U.S. 
Supreme Court in Ragsdale invalidated 
the last sentence of current § 825.700(a), 
which states that if an employee takes 
paid or unpaid leave and the employer 
does not designate the leave as FMLA 
leave, the leave taken does not count 
against an employee’s FMLA 
entitlement. 

A number of commenters responding 

to the RFI addressed the effect of 
Ragsdale. For example, the National 
Coalition to Protect Family Leave stated 
that § 825.700(a) should be removed 
from the regulations. The Air Transport 
Association of America, Inc. and the 
Airline Industrial Relations Conference 
suggested that the regulations should be 
revised in light of Ragsdale, because 
employers do not know which 
regulations they must follow and which 
are no longer valid, and employees who 
read them also are confused about 
which regulations their employers must 
follow. The Association of Corporate 
Counsel similarly suggested that 
§ 825.700(a) should be deleted to clarify 
that an employer’s failure to timely 
designate leave does not increase the 
statutory leave period. Hewitt 
Associates LLC commented that ‘‘by 
deleting the ‘penalty’ provision and 
simply reinforcing employer

notification obligations,’’ the 
Department would appropriately 
respond to Ragsdale. The National 
Partnership for Women & Families 
stated that while the Supreme Court 
struck down the ‘‘categorical penalty’’ 
in the current regulations, it left intact 
the requirement that employers 
designate leave, and it ‘‘did not prohibit 
DOL from imposing any penalties on 
employers for failing to properly 
designate and notify employee about 
leave’’ (emphasis in original). (Related 
comments from both employer and 
employee representatives addressing 
possible changes to the notice and 
designation of leave requirements are 
addressed in the preamble discussing 
changes to § 825.208.) 

In light of these comments, the 

Department proposes to delete the last 
sentence from paragraph (a) of this 
section struck down by Ragsdale. Other 
than this change required by the Court’s 
decision, the Department proposes no 
changes to current paragraph (a). 

The Department proposes no changes 
to current § 825.700(b), which provides 
that an employer may amend existing 
leave programs, so long as they comply 
with the FMLA, and that nothing in the 
Act is intended to discourage employers 
from adopting or retaining more 
generous leave policies. 

The Department proposes to delete 

§ 825.700(c)(1) and (2) from the current 
regulations, as they discuss the initial 
applicability of the statute and periods 
of employment prior to the statute’s 
effective date, which are no longer 
necessary. 
Section 825.702 (Interaction with 
Federal and State anti-discrimination 
laws) 

Current § 825.702 addresses the 
interaction between the FMLA and 
other Federal and State anti- 
discrimination laws. Current paragraph 
(a) confirms that the FMLA and other 
Federal or State laws are wholly distinct 
and must be complied with 
independently. Paragraphs (b), (c), (d) 
and (e) primarily focus on the 
interaction between the FMLA and the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 
particularly with regard to leave rights, 
job modification, light duty, 
reassignment, and reinstatement. 
Paragraph (f) focuses on the interaction 
of the FMLA with Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and 
paragraph (g) states that the U.S. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission 
can provide further information on Title 
VII and the ADA. 

The Department proposes to add a 

new paragraph (g) in this section. 

Existing paragraph (g) would become 
proposed paragraph (h) in this section. 
Proposed paragraph (g) incorporates a 
discussion of the interaction between 
the Uniformed Services Employment 
and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 
(USERRA) and the FMLA. The current 
regulations contain no such reference, 
and the interaction between these two 
laws has been confusing to employees 
and employers alike. On July 22, 2002, 
the Department issued guidance stating 
that, based upon the reinstatement 
rights provided by USERRA, an 
employee is entitled to credit for FMLA 
eligibility purposes for the months and 
hours that the employee would have 
worked during the 12 months preceding 
the start of the leave but for his or her 
qualifying active duty uniformed 
service. See http://www.dol.gov/vets/ 
media/fmlarights.pdf. This guidance has 
been incorporated into paragraph (g) of 
the proposed regulations. The only 
other change the Department is 
proposing is to conform the cross- 
reference in paragraph (d)(2) to the 
proper paragraph in proposed § 825.207. 

commented on the differences between 
the FMLA’s and ADA’s treatment of 
light duty work. Sections 825.702(d)(2) 
and 825.220(d) of the FMLA regulations 
provide that an employee may 
voluntarily accept a ‘‘light duty’’ 
assignment while recovering from a 
serious health condition, but cannot be 
coerced to do so. Under the ADA, an 
employer does not have to create a light 
duty position for an individual with a 
disability but, if a vacant, light duty 
position already exists, the employer 
must reassign the individual with a 
disability to the position if there is no 
other effective accommodation available 
and the reassignment would not pose an 
undue hardship. See EEOC, Workers’ 
Compensation Guidance, at Questions 
27 and 28. In addition, if the only 
effective accommodation available is 
similar or equivalent to a light duty 
position, an employer must provide that 
accommodation, absent undue 

The Department received numerous 
comments in response to the RFI that 
discussed the relationship between the 
FMLA and the ADA. Many of those 
comments were discussed in Chapter 
VII of the Department’s 2007 Report on 
the RFI comments (see 72 FR at 35599), 
and other sections of this preamble 
address comments that are relevant to 
those sections (see, e.g., §§ 825.306– 
.307). The Department also received 
comments regarding the interaction 
between the FMLA and the ADA that 
are relevant to the job modification, 
light duty, and reassignment issues 
addressed in this section.

hardship. See EEOC, Workers’ 
Compensation Guidance, at Question 
27. 

The Department also received 
comments regarding the differing 
standards under the FMLA and the ADA 
for transferring or reassigning 
employees to alternative positions. The 
FMLA permits an employer to 
temporarily transfer an employee who 
needs foreseeable intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave for planned 
medical treatment to an alternative 
position; however, the position must 
have equivalent pay and benefits. The 
position also must be one for which the 
employee is qualified and which better 
accommodates recurring periods of 
leave. Under the ADA, part-time work 
or occasional time-off may be a 
reasonable accommodation. As a general 
matter, reassignment is the 
accommodation of last resort under the 
ADA. However, if or when an 
employee’s need for part-time work or 
reduced hours in his or her current 
position creates an undue hardship for 
an employer, the employer must transfer 
the employee to a vacant, equivalent 
position for which the employee is 
qualified, unless doing so would present 
an undue hardship for the employer. If 
an equivalent position is not available, 
the employer must look for a vacant 
position at a lower level. Further 
accommodation is not required if a 
lower level position is also unavailable. 
See EEOC, Fact Sheet: ‘‘The Family and 
Medical Leave Act, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, and Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964’’ (hereafter 
‘‘EEOC FMLA and ADA Fact Sheet’’), at 
Question 13. Under the ADA, employers 
who place employees in lower level 
positions are not required to maintain 
the employee’s salary at the level of the 
higher grade, unless the employer does 
so for other employees. See EEOC 
Technical Assistance Manual § 3.10.5. 

Commenters also focused on the 

differences between the FMLA and the 
ADA with regard to the use of leave. 
Under current § 825.115, an eligible 
employee may use leave ‘‘where the 
health care provider finds that the 
employee is unable to work at all or is 
unable to perform any one of the 
essential functions of the employee’s 
position.’’ Other provisions of the 
FMLA allow an employee to take leave 
intermittently or on a reduced schedule. 
See 29 U.S.C. 2612(b); 29 CFR 825.203– 
.205. Under the ADA, an employee is 
entitled to reasonable accommodation, 
including medical leave, only if he or 
she has an impairment that 
‘‘substantially limits’’ one or more major 
life activities. Moreover, an employer is 
not required to provide any

accommodation that would pose an 
‘‘undue hardship’’ on the operation of 
the employer’s business. Neither the 
FMLA regulations nor the statute limits 
the availability of FMLA leave to 
situations where the employee’s absence 
does not impose an ‘‘undue hardship’’ 
on the employer. 

Although the Department received 

many comments seeking greater 
consistency between the FMLA and the 
ADA, the Department can do nothing to 
alter the fact that the two statutes serve 
distinctly different purposes, provide 
different rights, and have different 
eligibility criteria. Moreover, the FMLA 
legislative history clearly states that the 
‘‘purpose of the FMLA is to make leave 
available to eligible employees and 
employers within its coverage, and not 
to limit already existing rights and 
protection,’’ and it specifically 
recognizes that ‘‘the leave provisions of 
the [FMLA] are wholly distinct from the 
reasonable accommodation obligations 
of employers covered under the [ADA].’’ 
S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 38 (1993). 
Therefore, the Department proposes no 
changes to this section (other than the 
addition of a new section addressing 
USERRA and the changed internal 
cross-reference, as described 
previously). However, the Department 
believes that both employees and 
employers would benefit from a better 
understanding of the interaction 
between the ADA and FMLA, and 
provides the following additional 
description of that interaction. 

Although the FMLA adopts the ADA 
definition of ‘‘essential functions,’’ an 
FMLA ‘‘serious health condition’’ is not 
necessarily an ADA ‘‘disability.’’ An 
ADA ‘‘disability’’ is an impairment that 
substantially limits one or more major 
life activities, a record of such an 
impairment, or being regarded as having 
such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. 12102(2). 
Some FMLA ‘‘serious health 
conditions’’ may be ADA disabilities, 
for example, most cancers and serious 
strokes and some chronic conditions. 
Other ‘‘serious health conditions’’ may 
not be ADA disabilities, for example, 
pregnancy or a routine broken leg or 
hernia. This is because the condition is 
not an impairment (e.g., normal 
pregnancy), or because the impairment 
is not substantially limiting (e.g., a 
routine broken leg or hernia). See EEOC 
FMLA and ADA Fact Sheet, at Question 
9. 

Under the ADA, an employer is 

required to make a reasonable 
accommodation to the known physical 
or mental limitations of an otherwise 
qualified employee with a disability if it 
would not impose an ‘‘undue hardship’’ 
on the operation of the employer’s 

business. Undue hardship is defined as 
an action requiring significant difficulty 
or expense when considered in light of 
factors such as an employer’s size, 
financial resources, and the nature and 
structure of its operation. Reasonable 
accommodation may include adapting 
existing facilities, job restructuring, 
modifying work schedules, acquiring or 
modifying equipment or devices, or 
adjusting or modifying policies. 
Reasonable accommodation can include 
reassignment to a vacant equivalent 
position, if available, or to a lesser 
position if an equivalent one is 
unavailable or causes undue hardship. 
An employer must provide an effective 
reasonable accommodation that does 
not pose an undue hardship, but need 
not provide the employee’s preferred 
accommodation. 

Generally, an individual with a 

disability (or his or her representative) 
must notify the employer of a request 
for reasonable accommodation. An 
individual may use ‘‘plain English’’ and 
the request need not be in writing or 
mention the ADA or the phrase 
‘‘reasonable accommodation.’’ Instead, 
an individual must let the employer 
know that he or she needs an 
adjustment or change at work for a 
reason related to a medical condition. 
After receiving a request for reasonable 
accommodation, an employer and the 
individual with a disability should 
engage in an informal, ‘‘interactive 
process’’ to clarify what the individual 
needs and identify the appropriate 
reasonable accommodation. See 29 CFR 
pt. 1630 app. § 1630.9. As part of this 
‘‘interactive process,’’ the employer may 
ask the individual relevant questions 
that will enable it to make an informed 
decision about the request. This 
includes asking what type of reasonable 
accommodation is needed. When the 
disability and/or the need for 
accommodation is not obvious, the 
employer may ask the individual for 
reasonable documentation about his or 
her disability and functional limitations. 
See ‘‘EEOC Enforcement Guidance: 
Reasonable Accommodation and Undue 
Hardship Under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act,’’ revised Oct. 17, 2002, 
at Questions 1, 3, 5, and 6. This is 
similar to the rule under the FMLA (see 
§ 825.302), where an employee need not 
assert his or her rights under the FMLA 
or even mention the FMLA to put the 
employer on notice of the need for 
FMLA leave, but must provide sufficient 
information to an employer so that the 
employer is aware that FMLA rights 
may be at issue. The proposed rule 
states that sufficient information 
includes information that indicates that

the employee is unable to perform the 
functions of the job, the anticipated 
duration of the absence, and whether 
the employee intends to visit a health 
care provider. Once the employer is put 
on notice of a FMLA leave request, the 
regulations specify what information 
must be exchanged between the 
employee and employer, rather than 
them engaging in an informal, 
‘‘interactive’’ process. 

Unpaid leave is a potential reasonable 
accommodation that an employer might 
need to provide to an otherwise 
qualified individual with a disability, 
unless (or until) it imposes an undue 
hardship on the operation of the 
employer’s business. See 29 CFR pt. 
1630 app. § 1630.2(o). An otherwise 
qualified individual with a disability 
may be entitled to additional unpaid 
leave as a reasonable accommodation 
under the ADA, beyond the 12 weeks of 
unpaid leave available under the FMLA, 
if the additional leave would not impose 
an undue hardship on the operation of 
the employer’s business. Generally, 
unpaid leave is explored as a reasonable 
accommodation only after examining, 
through the interactive process, whether 
reasonable accommodations can be 
made to the employee’s job to keep the 
employee at work. No set amount of 
leave is required as a reasonable 
accommodation under the ADA. The 
existence of the FMLA does not mean 
that more than 12 weeks of unpaid leave 
automatically imposes an undue 
hardship for purposes of the ADA. To 
evaluate whether additional leave 
would impose an undue hardship, the 
employer may consider the impact on 
its operations caused by the employee’s 
initial 12-week absence, along with the 
undue hardship factors specified in the 
ADA and its regulations found at 29 
CFR 1630.2(p). See EEOC FMLA and 
ADA Fact Sheet. 

Under the ADA, a qualified 

individual with a disability may work 
part-time in his or her current position, 
or occasionally take time off, as a 
reasonable accommodation if it would 
not impose an undue hardship on the 
employer. If (or when) reduced hours 
create an undue hardship in the current 
position, the employer must see if there 
is another effective accommodation or if 
there is a vacant, equivalent position for 
which the employee is qualified and to 
which the employee can be reassigned 
without undue hardship while working 
a reduced schedule. If an equivalent 
position is not available, the employer 
must look for a vacant position at a 
lower level for which the employee is 
qualified. Continued accommodation is 
not required if a vacant position at a 
lower level is also unavailable. See 

EEOC FMLA and ADA Fact Sheet, at 
Question 13. 

Under the ADA, an employer must 

continue health insurance coverage for 
an employee taking leave or working 
part-time only if the employer also 
provides coverage for other employees 
in the same leave or part-time status. 
The coverage must be on the same terms 
normally provided to those in the same 
leave or part-time status. See EEOC 
FMLA and ADA Fact Sheet, at Question 
15. Under the FMLA, an employer must 
maintain the employee’s existing level 
of coverage (including family or 
dependent coverage) under a group 
health plan during the period of FMLA 
leave, provided the employee pays his 
or her share of the premiums. 29 CFR 
825.209–.210. An employer may not 
discriminate against an employee using 
FMLA leave, and therefore must also 
provide such an employee with the 
same benefits (e.g., life or disability 
insurance) normally provided to an 
employee in the same leave or part-time 
status. 29 CFR 825.220(c). 

Under the ADA, an employer and 
employee may agree to a transfer, on 
either a temporary or a permanent basis, 
if both parties believe that such a 
transfer is preferable to accommodating 
the employee in his or her current 
position. Note that a qualified 
individual with a disability who is 
using FMLA leave to work reduced 
hours, and/or has been temporarily 
transferred into another job under the 
FMLA, may also need a reasonable 
accommodation (e.g., special 
equipment) to perform an essential 
function of the job. See 29 CFR 
825.204(b). 
Section 825.800 (Definitions) 

Current § 825.800 contains the 

definitions of significant terms used in 
the regulations. Changes to definitions 
that were affected by the Department’s 
proposed changes and clarifications 
have been made. Specifically, changes 
and clarifications have been made to the 
terms ‘‘continuing treatment,’’ ‘‘eligible 
employee,’’ ‘‘employee,’’ ‘‘health care 
provider,’’ ‘‘serious health condition,’’ 
‘‘parent,’’ and ‘‘son or daughter.’’ 
Family Leave in Connection With 
Injured Members of the Armed Forces 
and Qualifying Exigencies Related to 
Active Duty 

Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986, the 

National Defense Authorization Act for 
FY 2008, amends the FMLA to provide 
leave to eligible employees of covered 
employers to care for covered 
servicemembers and because of any 
qualifying exigency arising out of the 
fact that a covered family member is on 

active duty or has been notified of an 
impending call to active duty status in 
support of a contingency operation 
(collectively referred to herein as the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986). The provisions of H.R. 4986 
providing FMLA leave to care for a 
covered servicemember became 
effective on January 28, 2008, when the 
law was enacted. The provisions of H.R. 
4986 providing for FMLA leave due to 
a qualifying exigency arising out of a 
covered family member’s active duty (or 
call to active duty) status are not 
effective until the Secretary of Labor 
issues regulations defining ‘‘qualifying 
exigencies.’’ Because a significant 
number of United States military 
servicemembers are currently on active 
duty or call to active duty status, the 
Department is fully aware of the need to 
issue regulations under the military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 as 
soon as possible. Towards that end, the 
Department began preliminary 
consultations with the Departments of 
Defense and Veterans Affairs and the 
U.S. Office of Personnel Management 
(which will administer similar 
provisions regarding leave to care for a 
covered servicemember for most Federal 
employees) prior to the passage of H.R. 
4986. 

As it did in the initial notice of 

proposed rulemaking under the FMLA 
in 1993, 58 FR 13394 (Mar. 10, 1993), 
and in the interest of ensuring the 
expedient publication of regulations, the 
Department is including in this Notice 
a description of the relevant military 
family leave statutory provisions, a 
discussion of issues the Department has 
identified, and a series of questions 
seeking comment on subjects and issues 
that may be considered in the final 
regulations. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3) (notice of 
proposed rulemaking shall include 
‘‘either the terms or substance of the 
proposed rule or a description of the 
subjects and issues involved’’). Because 
of the need to issue regulations as soon 
as possible so that employees and 
employers are aware of their respective 
rights and obligations regarding military 
family leave under the FMLA, the 
Department anticipates that the next 
step in the rulemaking process, after full 
consideration of the comments received 
in response to this Notice, will be the 
issuance of final regulations. 

The Department strongly encourages 

the submission of any comments or 
concerns which should be considered in 
the course of developing the final 
regulations. Commenters are encouraged 
to identify any issues related to military 
family leave they believe need to be 
addressed—even if the Department has 
not identified such issues—and to offer

their views, with supporting rationale, 
as to how such issues should be 
addressed by the Department. 
Commenters also are invited to submit 
data relating to the economic impact of 
the FMLA provisions in H.R. 4986. The 
Department will undertake to 
implement the new military family 
leave provisions so as to maximize the 
benefits and minimize the burdens on 
both employees and employers 
consistent with the purposes of the 
FMLA. 
Summary of the Military Family Leave 
Provisions and Regulatory Issues 

The FMLA amendments in Section 

585(a) of H.R. 4986 are summarized 
below. In addition to creating new leave 
entitlements, the FMLA provisions of 
H.R. 4986 include conforming 
amendments to incorporate the new 
leave entitlements into the current 
FMLA statutory provisions relating to 
the use of leave and to add certain new 
terms to the FMLA’s statutory 
definitions. The FMLA amendments in 
H.R. 4986 raise a number of issues about 
which the Department seeks comment. 
Although specific issues for public 
comment are listed below after the 
discussion of each FMLA statutory 
amendment in H.R. 4986, commenters 
are encouraged to identify any issues 
they believe need to be addressed. 
Section 101—Definitions 

The military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 add certain new terms to 
the FMLA’s definitions. The Department 
is considering adding these definitions 
to proposed FMLA regulatory § 825.800 
as follows: 

The term ‘‘Active duty’’ is defined by 
H.R. 4986 as duty under a call or order 
to active duty under a provision of law 
referred to in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)(B). 
This definition will be codified in the 
FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 2611(14). The 
Department believes that the 
Department of Defense is in the best 
position to determine when a 
servicemember has been called to active 
duty. Title 10 provides extensive 
information regarding a 
servicemember’s active duty or call to 
active duty status, the terms of which, 
as noted in H.R. 4986, are referenced in 
Section 101(a)(13)(B) of that Title. 
Accordingly, the Department believes 
that the definition of ‘‘active duty’’ in 
the military family leave provisions of 
H.R. 4986 does not require further 
clarification and is considering adding it 
to proposed FMLA regulatory § 825.800 
as currently defined in H.R. 4986, and 
cross-referencing 10 U.S.C. 
101(a)(13)(B).

‘‘Contingency operation’’ is defined 
by the military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 as a military operation 
designated by the Secretary of Defense 
as provided under 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13). 
This definition will be codified in the 
FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 2611(15). The 
Department believes that the 
Department of Defense’s definition of 
‘‘contingency operation’’ found in Title 
10 does not require further clarification; 
therefore, the Department is considering 
including a definition of ‘‘contingency 
operations’’ in proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.800 as currently 
defined in Section 585(a)(1) of H.R. 
4986, and cross-referencing 10 U.S.C. 
101(a)(13). 

‘‘Covered servicemember’’ is defined 
by the military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 as a member of the Armed 
Forces (including National Guard or 
Reserves) ‘‘who is undergoing medical 
treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is 
otherwise in outpatient status, or is 
otherwise on the temporary disability 
retired list, for a serious injury or 
illness.’’ This definition will be codified 
in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 2611(16). The 
Department believes that determining 
whether a member of the Armed Forces 
is in outpatient status or is otherwise on 
the temporary disability retired list for 
a serious illness or injury is likely to be 
relatively straightforward. There may be 
issues, however, regarding what it 
means for a servicemember to be 
‘‘undergoing medical treatment, 
recuperation, or therapy’’ for a serious 
illness or injury. The Department’s 
initial view is that any treatment, 
recuperation, or therapy provided to a 
servicemember for a serious injury or 
illness, and not just that provided by the 
Armed Forces, should be covered. The 
Department solicits public comments on 
this issue. Should there be a temporal 
proximity requirement between the 
covered servicemember’s injury or 
illness and the treatment, recuperation, 
or therapy for which care is required? 
Should the Department rely on a 
determination made by the Department 
of Defense as to whether a 
servicemember is undergoing medical 
treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a 
serious injury or illness? 

‘‘Outpatient status’’ for a covered 

servicemember is defined by the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 as the status of a member of the 
Armed Forces assigned to (a) a medical 
treatment facility as an outpatient or (b) 
a unit established to provide command 
and control of members of the Armed 
Forces receiving medical care as 
outpatients. This definition will be 
codified in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 
2611(17). The Department believes this 

definition does not require further 
clarification, and is considering 
including it in proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.800 as currently drafted 
in Section 585(a)(1) of H.R. 4986. 
‘‘Next of kin’’ is defined by the 

military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 as the ‘‘nearest blood relative’’ of 
an individual. This definition will be 
codified in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 
2611(18). The Department is consulting 
with the Department of Defense 
regarding this definition. Preliminary 
information suggests that, for 
disposition of remains, personal effects 
and the release of records, the 
Department of Defense generally 
considers the following individuals 
‘‘next of kin’’ of a servicemember in the 
following order: (1) Unremarried 
surviving spouse; (2) natural and 
adopted children; (3) parents; (4) 
remarried surviving spouses (except 
those who obtained a divorce from the 
servicemember or who remarried before 
a finding of death by the military); (4) 
blood or adoptive relatives who have 
been granted legal custody of the 
servicemember by court decree or 
statutory provisions; (5) brothers or 
sisters; (6) grandparents; (7) other 
relatives of legal age in order of 
relationship to the individual according 
to civil laws; and (8) persons standing 
in loco parentis to the servicemember. 
The Department seeks comments on 
whether it should adopt the above list 
of next of kin for purposes of the 
military family leave provisions. The 
Department also seeks comments on 
whether a definition of ‘‘next of kin’’ 
that relies on differing State law 
interpretations is appropriate, and 
whether a certification of ‘‘next of kin’’ 
status should be required. If such a 
certification is required, the Department 
seeks comments on who should issue 
such a certification, and its contents. 
The Department also seeks public 
comments on the requirement in the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 that the next of kin be the 
‘‘nearest’’ blood relative. Should the 
Department interpret this provision to 
mean that each covered servicemember 
may only have one next of kin who is 
eligible to take FMLA leave to provide 
care if the servicemember is undergoing 
medical treatment, recuperation, or 
therapy, is otherwise in outpatient 
status, or is otherwise on the temporary 
disability retired list, for a serious 
illness or injury? The Department seeks 
comments on how to determine if an 
employee is the nearest blood relative of 
a covered servicemember when a 
servicemember has several relatives of 
close consanguinity still alive, and 
whether this language could be

interpreted to provide military caregiver 
leave to any eligible next of kin of a 
covered servicemember. If the nearest 
blood relative of a covered 
servicemember is unable or unwilling to 
provide care, should the next nearest 
blood relative of the covered 
servicemember be eligible to take FMLA 
leave to care for the wounded 
servicemember? The Department also 
seeks comments on whether it would be 
appropriate to permit a covered 
servicemember to designate any blood 
relative, or other individuals such as 
those recognized by the Department of 
Defense as the servicemember’s 
Committed And Designated 
Representative (CADRE), as next of kin 
for purposes of FMLA leave taken to 
care for the servicemember. 

‘‘Serious injury or illness’’ in the case 

of members of the Armed Forces, 
National Guard, or Reserves is defined 
by the military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 as ‘‘an injury or illness 
incurred by the member in line of duty 
on active duty in the Armed Forces that 
may render the member medically unfit 
to perform the duties of the member’s 
office, grade, rank, or rating.’’ This 
definition will be codified in the FMLA 
at 29 U.S.C. 2611(19). The Department 
believes that the Departments of Defense 
or Veterans Affairs are likely in the best 
position to provide the standard for 
what constitutes a ‘‘serious illness or 
injury’’ that may ‘‘render the member 
medically unfit to perform the duties of 
the member’s office, grade, rank, or 
rating.’’ Preliminary information 
suggests that the military branches 
already regularly provide, when 
requested, a medical certification to 
family members of covered 
servicemembers certifying that the 
member is seriously injured or ill and is 
actively receiving medical treatment. 
The Department seeks comments on 
whether a certification from the 
Departments of Defense or Veterans 
Affairs should be sufficient to establish 
whether a servicemember has a serious 
injury or illness that was incurred by 
the member in the line of duty while on 
active duty status in the Armed Forces, 
as well as on other approaches to 
determining whether a servicemember 
has an injury or illness that may render 
a servicemember medically unfit. The 
Department also seeks comments on 
whether H.R. 4986 permits eligible 
employees to take military caregiver 
leave under FMLA to care for a 
servicemember whose serious injury or 
illness was incurred in the line of duty 
but does not manifest itself until after 
the servicemember has left military 
service. In such circumstances, how 

would one determine whether the injury 
or illness renders, or may render, the 
servicemember medically unfit to 
perform the duties of the member’s 
office, grade, rank, or rating, when the 
servicemember is no longer serving in 
the military? 

The military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 appear to rely on certain 
of the FMLA’s existing definitions (e.g., 
‘‘parent’’, ‘‘son or daughter’’, and 
‘‘spouse’’). Although H.R. 4986 does not 
change these definitions, the legislative 
history includes statements by members 
of Congress that suggest that the term 
‘‘son or daughter’’ should be given a 
broader meaning under the military 
family leave provisions to include adult 
children. As discussed in greater detail 
below, the Department seeks comment 
on whether it would be appropriate to 
define some of these terms differently 
for purposes of leave taken because of 
a qualifying exigency or to care for a 
covered servicemember under the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986. 
Section 102(a)—Leave Entitlement 

The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 add a new qualifying 
reason to take FMLA leave: ‘‘[b]ecause 
of any qualifying exigency (as the 
Secretary shall, by regulation, 
determine) arising out of the fact that 
the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent 
of the employee is on active duty (or has 
been notified of an impending call or 
order to active duty) in the Armed 
Forces in support of a contingency 
operation.’’ This provision will be 
codified in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 
2612(a)(1)(E) and, by its terms, is not 
operative until the Secretary of Labor 
determines, by regulation, the qualifying 
exigencies that will entitle an eligible 
employee to take FMLA leave. 

Representative Jason Altmire, who 
introduced this provision, made the 
following three statements on the House 
Floor regarding leave taken for a 
qualifying exigency: 

This amendment allows the immediate 
family of military personnel to use Family 
Medical Leave Act time for issues directly 
arising from deployment and extended 
deployments. The wife of a recently 
deployed military servicemember could use 
the Family and Medical Leave Act to arrange 
for childcare. The husband of a 
servicemember could use the Family Medical 
Leave Act to attend predeployment briefings 
and family support sessions. The parents of 
a deployed servicemember could take Family 
Medical Leave Act time to see their raised 
child off or welcome them back home. This 
amendment does not expand eligibility to 
employees not already covered by the Family 
Medical Leave Act * * *

[W]hat this legislation does is allow family 

members of our brave men and women 
serving in the Guard and Reserve to use 
Family and Medical Leave Act time to see 
off, to see the deployment, or to see the 
members return when they come back, and 
to use that, importantly, to deal with 
economic issues, and get the household 
economics in order * * * 

It will allow military families to use family 

and medical leave time to manage issues 
such as childcare and financial planning that 
arise as a result of the deployment of an 
immediate family member. 
153 Cong. Rec. H5258 (daily ed. May 16, 
2007); 153 Cong. Rec. H15325 (daily ed. 
Dec. 12, 2007); 153 Cong. Rec. H15349 
(daily ed. Dec. 12, 2007) (statements of 
Representative Altmire). 

In addition to Representative 

Altmire’s statements, in remarks on the 
Floor, Representative Tom Udall stated: 

For every soldier who is deployed 

overseas, there is a family back home faced 
with new and challenging hardships. The toll 
extends beyond emotional stress. From 
raising a child to managing household 
finances to day-to-day events, families have 
to find the time and resources to deal with 
the absence of a loved one. * * * The 
Altmire-Udall amendment would allow 
spouses, parents or children of military 
personnel to use Family and Medical Leave 
Act benefits for issues related directly to the 
deployment of a soldier. Current FMLA 
benefits allow individuals to take time off for 
the birth of a child or to care for a family 
member with a serious illness. The 
deployment of a soldier is no less of a crisis 
and certainly puts new demands on families. 
We should ensure that the FMLA benefits 
given in other circumstances are provided to 
our fighting families during their time of 
need. 
153 Cong. Rec. E1076 (daily ed. May 17, 
2007) (statement of Representative 
Udall). 

Finally, Representative George Miller 

stated that: 

Under the amendment * * * a worker can 

take family and medical leave to deal with 
the issues that arise as a result of a spouse, 
parent, or child’s deployment to a combat 
zone like Iraq or Afghanistan. Under this 
amendment family members can use the 
leave to take care of issues like making legal 
and financial arrangements and making child 
care arrangements or other family obligations 
that arise and double when family members 
are on active duty deployments * * * These 
deployments and extended tours are not easy 
on families, and two-parent households can 
suddenly become a single-parent household 
and one parent is left alone to deal with 
paying the bills, going to the bank, picking 
up the kids from school, watching the kids, 
providing emotional support to the rest of the 
family. You have got to deal with these 
predeployment preparations.

Miller).

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Given the statements above and 
Webster’s Dictionary definition of 
‘‘exigency’’ as ‘‘the quality or state of 
requiring immediate aid or action, or a 
state of affairs that makes urgent 
demands,’’ how should the Department 
define qualifying exigencies for 
purposes of the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986? Should 
qualifying exigencies be limited to those 
items of an urgent or one-time nature 
arising from deployment as opposed to 
routine, everyday life occurrences? The 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 would allow leave for any 
‘‘qualifying’’ exigency arising out of the 
fact that the spouse, son, daughter, or 
parent of an eligible employee is on 
active duty (or has been notified of an 
impending call or order to active duty) 
in support of a contingency operation. 
Because the statute uses the word 
‘‘qualifying’’, it is the Department’s 
initial view that not every exigency 
necessarily will entitle a military family 
member to leave. It also is the 
Department’s initial view that there 
must be some nexus between the 
eligible employee’s need for leave and 
the servicemember’s active duty status. 
The Department solicits comments on 
the degree of nexus required to 
demonstrate that the exigency arises out 
of the servicemember’s active duty 
status. In light of the fact that this new 
entitlement to leave would be in 
addition to the existing qualifying 
reasons for FMLA leave, which already 
permit an eligible employee to take 
FMLA leave to care for a son or 
daughter, parent, or spouse with a 
serious health condition, the 
Department’s initial view is that leave 
for qualifying exigencies should be 
limited to non-medical related 
exigencies, as suggested by 
Representative Altmire’s statements. 
The Department seeks comment on 
these issues and on whether it would be 
appropriate to develop a list of pre- 
deployment, deployment, and post- 
deployment qualifying exigencies. If so, 
should the following types of exigencies 
qualify: making arrangements for child 
care; making financial and legal 
arrangements to address the 
servicemember’s absence; attending 
counseling related to the active duty of 
the servicemember; attending official 
ceremonies or programs where the 
participation of the family member is 
requested by the military; attending to 
farewell or arrival arrangements for a 
servicemember; and attending to affairs 
caused by the missing status or death of 
a servicemember? Are there other types 
of exigencies that should qualify? 

Additionally, should such a list be a per 
se list of qualified exigencies? 

Although Representative Altmire’s 
statements suggest that a parent of an 
adult son or daughter should be 
permitted to take FMLA leave for a 
qualifying exigency arising out of the 
deployment of the son or daughter, the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 do not alter the current FMLA 
definition of ‘‘son or daughter.’’ Under 
this definition, a son or daughter must 
either be (1) under the age of 18 or (2) 
18 years of age or older and incapable 
of self-care because of a mental or 
physical disability. 29 U.S.C. 2611(12). 
The Department recognizes that 
applying this definition of ‘‘son or 
daughter’’ to leave taken because of a 
qualifying exigency would mean parents 
would only be able to take FMLA leave 
because of a qualifying exigency if their 
son or daughter is under the age of 18 
or older than age 18 and incapable of 
self-care because of a mental or physical 
disability. By Federal law, however, the 
minimum age for enlistment in the 
United States Military is 17 (with 
parental consent). 10 U.S.C. 505. 
Moreover, children over the age of 18 
who are incapable of self-care are 
unlikely to be found medically qualified 
to perform military duties. Therefore, 
the Department seeks comments on 
whether it would be appropriate, given 
the language of H.R. 4986, to define the 
term ‘‘son or daughter’’ differently for 
purposes of FMLA leave taken because 
of a qualifying exigency. 

The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 also establish an additional 
leave entitlement that permits an ‘‘an 
eligible employee who is the spouse, 
son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of 
a covered servicemember’’ to ‘‘a total of 
26 workweeks of leave during a 12- 
month period to care for the 
servicemember.’’ This provision will be 
codified in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 
2612(a)(3). A number of issues regarding 
the application of this new FMLA leave 
entitlement are discussed below. The 
Department invites comments on these, 
and any other issues, related to the 
provision of FMLA leave to care for a 
covered servicemember. 

First, as with leave taken for a 
qualifying exigency, the military 
caregiver provision of H.R. 4986 does 
not alter the current FMLA definition of 
‘‘son or daughter’’ for purposes of 
defining who is eligible to take leave to 
care for a covered servicemember. Thus, 
the only sons or daughters who will be 
eligible to take FMLA leave to care for 
a seriously injured servicemember will 
be those who are under the age of 18 or 
age 18 or older and incapable of self- 
care because of a mental or physical 

disability. One alternative would be for 
the Department to define ‘‘next of kin’’ 
as including children of covered 
servicemembers. The Department could 
then define the term ‘‘children’’ more 
expansively than the term ‘‘son or 
daughter’’ is currently defined in the 
FMLA to allow adult children of 
covered servicemembers to take FMLA 
leave to care for a covered 
servicemember. Alternatively, the 
Department could define the term ‘‘son 
or daughter of a covered 
servicemember’’ differently than the 
term ‘‘son or daughter.’’ The Department 
seeks comments on these approaches, 
whether these approaches are allowed 
by the military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986, and whether it is 
appropriate to define the term ‘‘son or 
daughter’’ differently for purposes of 
FMLA leave taken to care for a covered 
servicemember. 

Second, the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 provide that 
leave to care for a covered 
servicemember shall only be available 
‘‘during a single 12-month period.’’ The 
amendments do not specify whether 
that 12-month period should be 
calculated from the date of the 
servicemember’s injury, the date of the 
determination that the servicemember 
has a serious injury or illness, the first 
date on which an eligible employee is 
needed to care for a seriously injured 
servicemember, or on some other basis. 
Current and proposed § 825.200 of the 
FMLA regulations permits an employer 
to choose any of the following methods 
when determining the 12-month period 
in which the current 12 weeks of FMLA 
leave entitlement occurs: (1) The 
calendar year; (2) any fixed 12-month 
‘‘leave year,’’ such as a fiscal year, a year 
required by State law, or a year starting 
on an employee’s anniversary date; (3) 
the 12-month period measured forward 
from the date any employee’s first 
FMLA leave begins; or, (4) a ‘‘rolling’’ 
12-month period measured backward 
from the date an employee uses any 
FMLA leave. The Department seeks 
comments on how the ‘‘single 12-month 
period’’ should be measured for 
purposes of determining entitlement to 
leave to care for a covered 
servicemember. For example, should an 
employer be permitted to choose a 
method when determining the 12-month 
period in which the 26 workweeks of 
leave entitlement to care for a covered 
servicemember occurs, as is the case for 
other types of FMLA-qualifying leave? 
What distinctions should the 
Department draw between calculating 
the 12-month period for leave to care for 
a covered servicemember and the other

qualifying reasons for FMLA leave? The 
Department also seeks comments on 
how to reconcile this single 12-month 
period to the employer’s regular FMLA 
leave year, if different 12-month periods 
are used. 

Third, the military family leave 

provisions of H.R. 4986 provide that the 
eligible employee is entitled to a total of 
26 workweeks of leave during a single 
12-month period to care for a covered 
servicemember. Is the 26 workweek 
leave entitlement to care for a covered 
servicemember a one-time entitlement 
or may an employee have multiple 
entitlements? The FMLA currently 
provides that an eligible employee is 
entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of 
leave during the relevant 12-month 
period. The 12 workweeks of leave may 
be taken for any qualifying FMLA 
reason until the leave is exhausted in 
the relevant 12-month period. Assuming 
the employee continues to meet the 
eligibility requirements, the employee 
may take leave again (up to 12 weeks) 
for any qualifying FMLA reason in a 
new leave year. The Department seeks 
comments on whether a similar 
approach to leave taken to care for a 
covered servicemember would be 
appropriate even though the leave 
entitlement to care for a covered 
servicemember is limited to a ‘‘single 
12-month period’’ under the military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986. 

Given the statutory language of H.R. 

4986, can the 26 workweek leave 
entitlement be interpreted to apply per 
covered servicemember, i.e., each 
eligible employee may take 26 
workweeks of leave to care for each 
covered servicemember? Under this 
reading, an eligible employee would be 
permitted to take 26 workweeks of leave 
to care for his or her spouse who is a 
covered servicemember in a 12-month 
period, and could take another 26 
workweeks of leave to care for his or her 
parent who is a covered servicemember 
in another 12-month period. Could an 
employee take leave to care for both a 
spouse and a child who are covered 
servicemembers in the same 12-month 
period? Alternatively, could the 26 
workweek leave entitlement be 
calculated per injury of a covered 
servicemember, such that an eligible 
employee may take 26 workweeks of 
leave during a single 12-month period to 
provide care to a covered 
servicemember and then may take 
another 26 workweeks of leave during a 
different 12-month period to provide 
care to the same covered servicemember 
who is experiencing a second serious 
injury or illness? The 26 workweek 
leave entitlement also may be viewed as 
a one-time entitlement to each eligible

employee. This interpretation would 
permit each eligible employee to take 26 
workweeks of leave during any single 
12-month period, but would not entitle 
that employee to any additional periods 
of military family leave to care for the 
same or other covered servicemembers 
while still employed by the same 
covered employer. In this circumstance, 
does the 12-month limitation continue 
to apply to the employee in the event he 
or she goes to work for a different 
employer? Under any of these examples, 
should an employee be permitted to 
take more than 26 workweeks of leave 
during a single 12-month period? The 
Department seeks comments on these 
and any other options relating to how 
this provision should be interpreted. 
Fourth, because leave to care for a 

covered servicemember with a serious 
illness or injury may, in some 
circumstances, also qualify as leave to 
care for a spouse, parent, or child with 
a serious health condition, the 
Department seeks comments on how 
such leave should be designated. In 
particular, the Department seeks 
comments on whether the employee or 
employer should be able to select 
whether the leave is counted as FMLA 
leave taken to care for a covered 
servicemember or FMLA leave taken to 
care for a spouse, parent or child with 
a serious health condition. The 
Department also seeks comments on 
whether an initial designation of this 
leave as one type of FMLA leave may be 
changed retroactively in any 
circumstances. 

Finally, the military family leave 

provisions of H.R. 4986 provide for a 
combined total of 26 workweeks of 
FMLA leave for an eligible employee 
who takes leave to care for a covered 
servicemember as well as leave for other 
FMLA-qualifying reasons during the 
applicable 12-month period. The 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 do not limit the availability of 
leave to an eligible employee for other 
FMLA-qualifying reasons during any 
other 12-month period. These 
provisions will be codified in the FMLA 
at 29 U.S.C. 2612(a)(4). How should 
these provisions be implemented if 
different methods are used to calculate 
the 12-month period for leave taken to 
care for a covered servicemember versus 
leave for other FMLA-qualifying 
reasons? 
Section 102(b)—Requirements Relating 
to Leave Taken Intermittently or on a 
Reduced Leave Schedule 

The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 allow eligible employees to 
take FMLA leave to care for a covered 
servicemember intermittently or on a 

reduced leave schedule when medically 
necessary. Eligible employees also are 
permitted to take FMLA leave for a 
qualifying exigency intermittently or on 
a reduced leave schedule. These 
provisions will be codified in the FMLA 
at 29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(1). The military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 
also permit an employer to require an 
employee taking FMLA leave to care for 
a covered servicemember who is 
undergoing planned treatment to 
temporarily transfer to an available 
alternative position with equivalent pay 
and benefits that better accommodates 
recurring periods of intermittent leave 
or leave on a reduced leave schedule. 
This is the case currently for FMLA 
leave taken for planned medical 
treatment due to the employee’s own 
serious health condition or the serious 
health condition of a spouse, son, 
daughter, or parent. The military family 
leave provisions of H.R. 4986 do not 
specifically provide for such temporary 
transfers when FMLA leave is taken for 
a qualifying exigency. The Department 
seeks comment on whether it would be 
appropriate to permit temporary 
transfers when FMLA leave is taken on 
an intermittent or reduced leave 
schedule basis for a qualifying exigency. 
The Department also seeks comment on 
how H.R. 4986’s provisions regarding 
leave taken intermittently or on a 
reduced leave schedule should be 
incorporated into proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.202, which generally 
explains the taking of FMLA leave 
intermittently or on a reduced leave 
schedule, and proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.204, which covers 
temporary transfers. 
Section 102(d)—Relationship to Paid 
Leave 

The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 amend the statutory 
provisions for substitution of paid leave 
to include the new FMLA leave 
entitlements. These amendments will be 
codified in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 
2612(d). Under the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986, an eligible 
employee may elect, or an employer 
may require, that an employee 
substitute any accrued paid vacation 
leave, personal leave, or family leave for 
unpaid FMLA leave taken because of a 
qualifying exigency. In addition, the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 permit an eligible employee to 
elect, or an employer to require, that an 
employee substitute any accrued paid 
vacation leave, personal leave, family 
leave, or medical or sick leave for 
unpaid FMLA leave taken to care for a 
covered servicemember. The 
Department is considering how to

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

incorporate the military family leave 
provisions into proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.207, which addresses 
the substitution of paid leave for unpaid 
FMLA leave. Because that section as 
currently proposed in this NPRM refers 
generally to the substitution of paid 
leave for unpaid FMLA leave, the 
Department does not believe that 
specific reference to the new types of 
leave entitlement is required. The 
Department also seeks comments on 
alternative approaches relating to 
substitution of paid leave for military 
family leave provided under H.R. 4986. 
Section 102(e)—Employee Notice 

The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 extend to the new leave 
provision related to care for a 
servicemember the FMLA’s existing 
requirements for employees to provide 
advance notice when the need for leave 
is foreseeable based on planned medical 
treatment, and for making reasonable 
efforts to schedule planned medical 
treatment so as not to disrupt unduly 
the employer’s operations. The military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 
also provide for new notice 
requirements for leave taken due to 
qualifying exigencies whenever the 
need for such leave is foreseeable. The 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 require that eligible employees 
provide notice to the employer that is 
‘‘reasonable and practicable’’ in these 
circumstances. These amendments will 
be codified in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 
2612(e)(2) and (e)(3). 

Under the proposed FMLA 

regulations in this NPRM, an employee 
must generally provide the employer at 
least 30 days advance notice before 
FMLA leave is to begin if the need for 
the leave is foreseeable based on an 
expected birth, placement for adoption 
or foster care, or planned medical 
treatment for a serious health condition 
of the employee or of a family member. 
If 30 days notice is not practicable, such 
as because of a lack of knowledge of 
approximately when leave will be 
required to begin, a change in 
circumstances, a medical emergency, or 
because the leave is unforeseeable, 
notice must be given as soon as 
practicable under the particular facts 
and circumstances. For a further 
discussion of the employee notice 
requirements proposed in this NPRM, 
see the preamble discussion of proposed 
FMLA regulatory §§ 825.302 and 
825.303. 

The Department’s initial view is that 
these same notice requirements should 
be extended to leave taken to care for a 
covered servicemember. If the same 
notice requirements were adopted, an 

employee taking FMLA leave to care for 
a covered servicemember generally 
would be expected to provide the 
employer at least 30 days advance 
notice before FMLA leave is to begin 
when the need for the leave is 
foreseeable based on planned medical 
treatment for the covered 
servicemember. If 30 days notice is not 
practicable, such as because of a lack of 
knowledge of approximately when leave 
will be required to begin, a change in 
circumstances, a medical emergency, or 
because the leave is unforeseeable, 
notice must be given as soon as 
practicable under the particular facts 
and circumstances. The Department 
seeks comments on whether it should 
incorporate leave to care for a covered 
servicemember into the notice 
provisions of proposed FMLA 
regulatory §§ 825.302 and 825.303. The 
Department also is considering applying 
the requirements in proposed FMLA 
regulatory §§ 825.302(c) and 825.303(b), 
which require that the employee 
provide at least verbal notice sufficient 
to make the employer aware that the 
employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave 
and provide information regarding the 
anticipated timing and duration of the 
leave, to the taking of FMLA leave to 
care for a covered servicemember. 
Finally, the Department requests 
comments on whether proposed FMLA 
regulatory §§ 825.203 and 825.302(e), 
which address an employee’s obligation 
to make a reasonable effort to schedule 
foreseeable leave for planned medical 
treatment so as not to disrupt unduly 
the employer’s operations, should 
specifically reference the requirement in 
H.R. 4986 that servicemember family 
leave that is foreseeable based on 
planned medical treatment be 
scheduled in the same manner. 

The military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 provide that an employee 
taking leave due to a qualifying 
exigency provide ‘‘such notice to the 
employer as is reasonable and is 
practicable.’’ The Department’s initial 
view is that the notice requirements in 
proposed FMLA regulatory §§ 825.302 
and 825.303 also should be applied to 
leave taken due to qualifying exigencies. 
If different notice requirements should 
be used, the Department seeks 
comments on what should be required. 
For example, should the notice timing 
requirements for leave taken due to 
qualifying exigencies distinguish 
between foreseeable leave and 
unforeseeable leave, as proposed FMLA 
regulatory §§ 825.302 and 825.303 do? 
Additionally, leave taken because of a 
qualifying exigency may not involve a 
medical condition; therefore, the 

Department seeks comments on the type 
of information an employee should 
provide to the employer in order for the 
notice to be sufficient to make the 
employer aware that the employee’s 
need is FMLA-qualifying. 

These changes also will likely require 

that the Department make conforming 
changes to proposed FMLA regulatory 
§ 825.301(b), which generally addresses 
employee responsibilities to provide 
notice of the need for FMLA leave. The 
exact nature of the changes will depend 
on whether the same notice standards 
are applied to all qualifying reasons for 
FMLA leave. The Department believes 
that the general notice principles set 
forth in proposed FMLA regulatory 
§ 825.301 should apply to all qualifying 
reasons for FMLA leave. The public is 
invited, however, to comment on this 
issue and provide alternative views. 
Section 102(f)—Leave Entitlements for 
Spouses Employed by the Same 
Employer 

Under the military family leave 

provisions of H.R. 4986, an employer 
may limit the aggregate amount of leave 
to which eligible spouses employed by 
the same employer may be entitled in 
some circumstances. H.R. 4986 provides 
that a husband and wife employed by 
the same employer are limited to a 
combined total of 26 workweeks of 
leave during the relevant 12-month 
period if the leave taken is to care for 
a covered servicemember or a 
combination of leave taken to care for a 
covered servicemember and leave for 
the birth or placement of a healthy child 
or to care for a parent with a serious 
health condition. This provision does 
not alter the existing 12-week limitation 
that applies to leave taken by a husband 
and wife employed by the same 
employer for leave for the birth or 
placement of a healthy child or to care 
for a parent with a serious health 
condition (e.g., a husband and wife 
employed by the same employer could 
take no more than a combined total of 
12 weeks of FMLA leave for the birth or 
placement of a healthy child in a 12- 
month period, even if the husband and 
wife combined took fewer than 14 
weeks of leave to care for a covered 
servicemember, in that same period). 
These provisions will be codified in the 
FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 2612(f). How should 
the Department incorporate the same 
employer limitation of the military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 
into the regulatory scheme proposed in 
this NPRM? The Department 
specifically seeks comments on how 
H.R. 4986’s limitation on spouses 
employed by the same employer would 
interact with FMLA’s existing limitation

on spouses employed by the same 
employer if different 12-month periods 
are used to determine eligibility for 
leave taken to care for a covered 
servicemember and other FMLA- 
qualifying leave. 

Conforming regulatory changes likely 

will be required to proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.120(a)(3), which 
discusses the applicability of the same 
employer limit to FMLA leave taken for 
pregnancy or birth; proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.121(a)(3), applying the 
same employer limit to FMLA leave 
taken for adoption or foster care; and 
proposed FMLA regulatory § 825.201(b), 
which discusses the same employer 
limit in the context of FMLA leave taken 
to care for a parent with a serious health 
condition. The Department requests 
comments on how these sections should 
be changed to incorporate the same 
employer limit in the military family 
leave provisions of H.R. 4986. 
Section 103—Certification 

The military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 allow employers to apply 
the FMLA’s existing medical 
certification requirements for serious 
health conditions to leave taken to care 
for a covered servicemember. In 
addition, the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 provide for a 
new certification related to leave taken 
because of a qualifying exigency. Under 
the military family leave provisions of 
H.R. 4986, an employer may require that 
leave taken because of a qualifying 
exigency be ‘‘supported by a 
certification issued at such time and in 
such manner as the Secretary may by 
regulation prescribe.’’ These provisions 
will be codified in the FMLA at 29 
U.S.C. 2613. 

The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 amend FMLA’s current 
certification requirements to permit an 
employer to request that leave taken to 
care for a covered servicemember be 
supported by a medical certification. 
FMLA’s current certification 
requirements, however, focus on 
providing information related to a 
serious health condition—a term that is 
not relevant to leave taken to care for a 
covered servicemember. At the same 
time, the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 do not explicitly 
require that a sufficient certification for 
purposes of military caregiver leave 
provide relevant information regarding 
the covered servicemember’s serious 
injury or illness, such as whether the 
injury was incurred by the member in 
the line of duty while on active duty in 
the Armed Forces, or whether the injury 
may render the member medically unfit 
to perform the duties of the member’s

office, grade, rank, or rating. In light of 
this, the Department seeks comments on 
the appropriate certification 
requirements for military caregiver 
leave, including whether it would be 
appropriate to interpret FMLA’s 
statutory certification requirements 
differently for purposes of leave taken to 
care for a covered servicemember. 

Furthermore, FMLA currently 

provides that an employer may request 
a medical certification issued by the 
health care provider of the employee’s 
son, daughter, spouse, or parent in order 
to support a request for FMLA leave to 
care for a spouse, parent, or child with 
a serious health condition. 29 U.S.C. 
2613. Although the leave entitlement 
provisions of H.R. 4986 permit an 
eligible employee who is the next of kin 
of a covered servicemember to take 
military family leave, H.R. 4986’s 
certification requirements appear to 
permit an employer to obtain 
certification issued by the health care 
provider of the employee’s next of kin, 
rather than the covered servicemember. 
The Department believes that an 
employer should only be able to obtain 
a certification from the health care 
provider or military branch of the 
covered servicemember for whom the 
eligible employee is caring. The 
Department seeks comment on whether 
it is appropriate to interpret the military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 in 
this manner when a medical 
certification is sought for leave taken by 
an eligible employee who is the next of 
kin of a covered servicemember. 
The Department is considering 
whether a medical certification to 
support leave taken to care for a covered 
servicemember issued by the 
Departments of Defense or Veterans 
Affairs would, in all cases, eliminate the 
need to both define a sufficient medical 
certification for purposes of taking leave 
to care for a covered servicemember and 
develop a clarification, authentication, 
validation, and recertification process 
for leave taken for this purpose. The 
Department also seeks comment on 
whether, and how, to incorporate the 
new certification requirement for leave 
taken to care for a covered 
servicemember into proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.305, which describes 
the general rule applicable to FMLA 
medical certifications; and proposed 
FMLA regulatory § 825.306, which 
addresses the required content of a 
FMLA medical certification. In light of 
the fact that many of the certifications 
supporting leave taken to care for a 
covered servicemember may be issued 
by the Departments of Defense or 
Veterans Affairs, the Department 
specifically seeks comment on whether 

there should be different timing 
requirements that an employee must 
follow when providing such 
certification. Likewise, should the 
content of a sufficient medical 
certification be different when it is 
required to support a leave request to 
care for a covered servicemember? 
Should the clarification, authentication, 
and second and third opinion 
provisions of proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.307 and the 
recertification provisions in proposed 
FMLA regulatory § 825.308 be applied 
to certifications supporting FMLA leave 
taken to care for a covered 
servicemember, and, if so, how? 

The military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 also permit the Secretary 
of Labor to prescribe a new certification 
requirement for leave taken because of 
a qualifying exigency arising out of a 
servicemember’s active duty or call to 
active duty. The Department is 
considering how to implement such a 
requirement and seeks comments on the 
following specific issues: 

(A) What type of information should 
be provided in a certification related to 
active duty or call to active duty status 
in order for it to be considered complete 
and sufficient? Should the certification 
merely require confirmation of the 
covered servicemember’s active duty 
status? 

(B) Who may issue a certification 

related to active duty or call to active 
duty status? Should anyone other than 
the Department of Defense provide a 
certification of the covered 
servicemember’s active duty or call to 
active duty status? 

(C) The Department’s initial view is 

that an employee also must provide 
certification that an absence(s) is due to 
a qualifying exigency. Because the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 require that the qualifying 
exigency arise out of the covered 
servicemember’s active duty or call to 
active duty status in support of a 
contingency operation, should any 
required certification specify that the 
requested leave is a qualifying exigency 
or that it arises out of the covered 
servicemember’s active duty or call to 
active duty status in support of a 
contingency operation? 

(D) Should an employee seeking 

FMLA leave due to a qualifying 
exigency provide certification of the 
qualifying exigency by statement or 
affidavit? Who else might certify that a 
particular request for FMLA leave is 
because of a qualifying exigency? 

(E) Should the certification 

requirements for leave taken because of 
a qualifying exigency vary depending on

be applied to certifications related to 
leave taken because of a qualifying 
exigency? 

(G) Who should bear the cost, if any, 

of obtaining certifications related to 
leave taken because of a qualifying 
exigency? 

(H) Should an employer be permitted 

to clarify, authenticate, or validate an 
active duty or call to active duty 
certification? Likewise, should an 
employer be permitted to clarify, 
authenticate, or validate a certification 
that a particular event is a qualifying 
exigency? If so, what limitations, if any, 
should be imposed on an employer’s 
ability to seek such clarification, 
authentication, or validation for both 
types of certifications? 

(I) Should a recertification process be 
established for certifications related to 
leave taken because of a qualifying 
exigency? If so, how would that process 
compare to the current FMLA 
recertification process? 
Section 104(c)—Maintenance of Health 
Benefits 

Under the FMLA, an employer must 

maintain group health insurance 
coverage for an eligible employee on 
FMLA leave on the same terms as if the 
employee continued to work. 29 U.S.C. 
2614(c). When an eligible employee 
takes qualifying leave to care for a 
covered servicemember and fails to 
return from leave after the period of 
leave entitlement has expired, under the 
FMLA amendments in H.R. 4986, the 
employer may recover the premiums 
paid for maintaining the employee’s 
group health plan coverage during any 
period of unpaid leave if the employee 
fails to return to work for a reason other 
than the continuation, recurrence, or 
onset of a serious health condition that 
entitles the employee to leave or other 
circumstances beyond the control of the 
employee. In addition, the military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 
provide that an employer may require 
an employee to support a claim that he 
or she did not return to work after 
taking military caregiver leave because 
of the continuation, recurrence, or onset 
of a serious health condition with a 
certification issued by the health care 
provider of the servicemember being 
cared for by the employee. These 
provisions will be codified in the FMLA 
at 29 U.S.C. 2614(c)(2)–(3). 

These new requirements focus on 

whether an employee does not return to 
work because of the continuation, 
recurrence, or onset of a serious health 
condition—a term that is not relevant to

leave taken to care for a covered 
servicemember. At the same time, the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 do not explicitly address whether 
an employer may recover premiums 
paid when an employee fails to return 
to work because of the continuation, 
recurrence, or onset of a serious injury 
or illness of the covered servicemember. 
Likewise, the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 do not 
specifically provide that an employer 
may obtain a certification regarding the 
continuation, recurrence, or onset of the 
servicemember’s serious injury or 
illness if an employee does not return to 
work after taking FMLA leave to care for 
a covered servicemember. In light of 
this, the Department seeks comments on 
how to appropriately implement these 
provisions of H.R. 4986. 

The Department is considering 

revisions to proposed FMLA regulatory 
§ 825.213(a) to incorporate these new 
requirements. The Department believes 
that proposed FMLA regulatory 
§ 825.213(a)(1) will need to be changed 
in order to address an employee’s 
failure to return to work after taking 
leave to care for a covered 
servicemember. Proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.213(a)(3) also will need 
to be changed to provide that an 
employer may require an employee to 
provide a certification issued by the 
health care provider of the covered 
servicemember being cared for by the 
employee. The Department requests 
comments on how the requirements in 
H.R. 4986 should be incorporated into 
these proposed FMLA regulatory 
provisions, and whether any additional 
guidance may be required on this topic. 
Section 107—Enforcement 

The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 provide for conforming 
amendments to the FMLA to include the 
new leave entitlements in the FMLA’s 
statutory enforcement scheme. These 
provisions will be codified in the FMLA 
at 29 U.S.C. 2617 and amend FMLA’s 
damages provision to provide for the 
recovery of damages equal to any actual 
monetary losses sustained by the 
employee up to a total of 26 weeks 
(rather than the current 12 weeks) in a 
case involving leave to care for a 
covered servicemember in which wages, 
salary, employment benefits or other 
compensation have not been denied or 
lost to the employee. 

The Department believes that a 

similar revision is required to FMLA 
regulatory § 825.400(c). That regulatory 
provision currently and as proposed in 
this NPRM provides that an employee is 
entitled to actual monetary losses 
sustained by an employee as a direct 

result of an employer’s violation of one 
or more of the provisions of FMLA up 
to a total of 12 weeks of wages. In order 
to reflect that the leave provisions 
relating to care for a covered 
servicemember provide up to 26 weeks 
of leave, the Department anticipates 
changing FMLA regulatory § 825.400(c) 
to provide that, in a case involving a 
violation of the military family leave 
provisions, an employee is entitled to 
actual monetary losses sustained up to 
a total of 26 weeks of wages. The 
Department does not believe that further 
changes to the FMLA regulatory 
provisions on enforcement are required 
in order to implement the military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986. 
The Department invites the public to 
comment on this and any other 
enforcement provisions that they 
believe may need to be revised. 
Section 108—Instructional Employees 
The military family leave provisions 

of H.R. 4986 also extend the entitlement 
to take FMLA leave to care for a covered 
servicemember and because of a 
qualifying exigency to eligible 
instructional employees of local 
educational agencies. In order to 
implement this revision, H.R. 4986 
contains three statutory changes to the 
FMLA, which will be codified in 
subsections (c)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of 29 
U.S.C. 2618, and apply the current 
FMLA rules regarding the taking of 
intermittent leave or leave on a reduced 
leave schedule, or leave near the end of 
an academic term, by employees of local 
educational agencies to certain leave 
taken to care for a covered 
servicemember by these same 
employees. The Department believes 
that three related regulatory changes are 
required to incorporate these provisions 
of H.R. 4986 into the FMLA regulatory 
scheme proposed in this NPRM, which 
other than changes to titles and very 
minor editorial changes is the same as 
the instructional employee provisions in 
the current FMLA regulations. 

First, the military family leave 

provisions of H.R. 4986 provide that an 
employer covered by 29 U.S.C. 2618 
could require that, in the case of an 
instructional employee who requests 
FMLA leave intermittently or on a 
reduced leave schedule for foreseeable 
planned medical treatment of a covered 
servicemember and who, as a result, 
will be on leave for greater than 20 
percent of the total number of working 
days during the period of leave, the 
employee choose to either (1) take leave 
for a period or periods of particular 
duration; or (2) transfer temporarily to 
an available alternative position with 
equivalent pay and benefits that better

7933 

accommodates recurring periods of 
leave. In order to incorporate this 
change, the Department believes a 
minor technical revision is required to 
current and proposed FMLA regulatory 
§ 825.601(a)(1) to provide that the 
provisions of that section apply when 
an eligible instructional employee needs 
intermittent leave or leave on a reduced 
schedule to care for a covered 
servicemember, in addition to applying 
to situations where the employee takes 
such leave to care for a family member 
or for the employee’s own serious health 
condition. In all three cases, the 
provision would continue to apply only 
to intermittent leave or leave on a 
reduced leave schedule which is 
foreseeable based on planned medical 
treatment and requires the employee to 
be on leave for more than 20 percent of 
the total number of working days over 
the period the leave would extend. 
Second, the military family leave 

provisions of H.R. 4986 extend some of 
the limitations on leave near the end of 
an academic term to leave requested 
during this period to care for a covered 
servicemember. The Department 
believes that several FMLA regulatory 
sections will need to be changed in 
order to apply the limitations on leave 
near the end of an academic term to 
military family leave. Current and 
proposed FMLA regulatory 
§ 825.602(a)(2) provides that, where an 
instructional employee begins leave for 
a purpose other than the employee’s 
own serious health condition during the 
five-week period before the end of the 
term, the employer may require the 
employee to continue taking leave until 
the end of the term if the leave will last 
more than two weeks and the employee 
would return to work during the two- 
week period before the end of the term. 
Because the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 only extend this 
limitation on leave near the end of an 
academic term to leave taken to care for 
a covered servicemember, and not leave 
taken because of a qualifying exigency, 
the Department believes that this FMLA 
regulatory section may need to be 
changed in order to specifically 
reference the types of leave that are 
subject to the limitation: (1) Leave 
because of the birth of a son or daughter, 
(2) leave because of the placement of a 
son or daughter for adoption or foster 
care, (3) leave taken to care for a spouse, 
parent, or child with a serious health 
condition, and (4) leave taken to care for 
a covered servicemember. A similar 
revision also may be required to FMLA 
regulatory § 825.602(a)(3), which 
currently and as proposed in this NPRM 
provides that an employer may require

an instructional employee to continue 
taking leave until the end of the term 
where the employee begins leave which 
will last more than five working days for 
a purpose other than the employee’s 
own serious health condition during the 
three-week period before the end of the 
term. 

The Department invites comments on 

whether additional revisions are 
required to the regulatory provisions 
governing local educational institutions 
in light of the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986. 
Incorporation of New FMLA Leave 
Entitlements Into Proposed FMLA 
Regulatory Scheme 

In addition to the issues discussed 

above, the Department specifically 
requests comments on whether the 
FMLA leave entitlements in H.R. 4986 
should generally be incorporated into 
the FMLA regulatory scheme proposed 
in this NPRM, or whether stand-alone 
regulatory sections should be created for 
one or both of the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986. The 
Department seeks comments on which 
of these approaches would be most 
beneficial for employees and employers. 
Although not specified in the military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986, the 
Department believes that a number of 
additional conforming changes may be 
required to the proposed FMLA 
regulations in this NPRM in order to 
fully integrate the military family leave 
provisions into FMLA’s regulatory 
scheme. For example, proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.100 may need to be 
changed to incorporate a discussion of 
the new leave entitlements into the 
general description of what the FMLA 
provides. Similarly, proposed FMLA 
regulatory § 825.112(a), which provides 
the general rule regarding the 
circumstances that will qualify for 
leave, may need to be changed to 
reference the two qualifying reasons for 
FMLA leave in H.R. 4986. 

The Department also plans on 

changing the proposed poster and 
general notice to incorporate the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986. The Department’s initial view is 
that these new qualifying reasons for 
FMLA leave should be incorporated into 
the poster and general notice discussed 
in proposed FMLA regulatory 
§ 825.300(a). However, the Department 
seeks comments on whether a separate 
poster and general notice should be 
created for military family leave. The 
proposed eligibility and designation 
notices in FMLA regulatory § 825.300(b) 
and (c) also will need to incorporate 
appropriate references to military family 
leave. The Department seeks comments 

on how these notices should be revised 
in order to incorporate these new FMLA 
leave entitlements. 

The Department seeks public 
comment on whether there are 
additional regulatory sections that 
should be reexamined in light of the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986. The questions set forth above are 
not intended to be an exhaustive list of 
issues that might arise when FMLA 
leave is taken to care for a covered 
servicemember or because of a 
qualifying exigency. The Department 
encourages the public to identify any 
other issues which should be 
considered during the rulemaking 
process. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 

In accordance with requirements of 

the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and its attendant 
regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, the DOL 
seeks to minimize the paperwork 
burden for individuals, small 
businesses, educational and nonprofit 
institutions, Federal contractors, State, 
local and tribal governments, and other 
persons resulting from the collection of 
information by or for the agency. The 
PRA typically requires an agency to 
provide notice and seek public 
comments on any proposed collection of 
information contained in a proposed 
rule. See 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B); 5 CFR 
1320.8. Persons are not required to 
respond to the information collection 
requirements as contained in this 
proposal unless and until they are 
approved by the OMB under the PRA at 
the final rule stage. 

This ‘‘paperwork burden’’ analysis 

estimates the burdens for the proposed 
regulations as drafted. In addition and 
as already discussed, the military family 
leave provisions of H.R. 4986 amend the 
FMLA to provide leave to eligible 
employees of covered employers to care 
for covered servicemembers and 
because of any qualifying exigency 
arising out of the fact that a covered 
family member is on active duty or has 
been notified of an impending call to 
active duty status in support of a 
contingency operation. The new 
statutory provisions will be codified at 
29 U.S.C. 2612(e)(2) and (e)(3). The 
earlier preamble discussion on Family 
Leave in Connection with Injured 
Members of the Armed Forces and 
Qualifying Exigencies Related to Active 
Duty provides a fuller explanation of the 
specific provisions and issues on which 
the Department seeks public comments. 
Because of the need to issue regulations 
as soon as possible so that employees 
and employers are aware of the 
respective rights and obligations

7934 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

regarding military family leave under 
the FMLA, the Department anticipates 
issuing, after full consideration of the 
comments received in response to this 
Notice, final regulations that will 
include necessary revisions to the 
currently proposed FMLA information 
collections. 

As will be more fully explained later, 
many of the estimates in the analysis of 
the ‘‘paperwork’’ requirements derive 
from data developed for the Preliminary 
Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) 
under E.O. 12866. However, the specific 
needs that the PRA analysis and PRIA 
are intended to meet often require that 
the data undergo a different analysis to 
estimate the burdens imposed by the 
‘‘paperwork’’ requirements from the 
analysis used in estimating the effect the 
regulations will have on the economy. 
Consequently, the differing treatment 
that must be undertaken in the PRA 
analysis and the PRIA may result in 
different results. For example, the PRA 
analysis measures the total burden of 
the information collection; however, the 
PRIA measures the incremental changes 
expected to result from the proposed 
regulatory changes. Thus, the PRA 
analysis will calculate a paperwork 
burden for an information collection 
that remains unchanged from the 
current regulation and the PRIA will not 
consider that item. Conversely, the 
regulatory definition for ‘‘collection of 
information’’ for PRA purposes 
specifically excludes the public 
disclosure of information originally 
supplied by the Federal government to 
the recipient for the purpose of 
disclosure to the public. 5 CFR 
1320.3(c)(2). The PRIA, however, may 
need to consider the impact of any 
regulatory changes in such notifications 
provided by the government. For 
example, in the context of the proposed 
FMLA changes, the general notice that 
employers currently must develop and 
provide to their workers is proposed to 
be replaced with a notice using wording 
provided by the DOL that employers 
must periodically provide to their 
employees. This proposed DOL- 
provided FMLA notice would not be a 
‘‘collection of information’’ for PRA 
purposes; therefore, the proposal 
reduces burden for PRA purposes. The 
PRIA, however, must address the 
economic impact of the frequency with 
which employers must provide the 
DOL’s FMLA notice under the proposed 
change to the regulations. Finally, the 
PRA definition of ‘‘burden’’ can exclude 
the time, effort, and financial resources 
necessary to comply with a collection of 
information that would be incurred by 
persons in the normal course of their

activities (e.g., in compiling and 
maintaining business records). 5 CFR 
1320.3(b)(2). The PRIA, however, must 
consider the economic impact of any 
changes in the proposed regulation. 

Circumstances Necessitating 

Collection: The FMLA requires private 
sector employers of 50 or more 
employees and public agencies to 
provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job- 
protected leave during any 12-month 
period to ‘‘eligible’’ employees for 
certain family and medical reasons (i.e., 
for birth of a son or daughter, and to 
care for the newborn child; for 
placement with the employee of a son 
or daughter for adoption or foster care; 
to care for the employee’s spouse, son, 
daughter, or parent with a serious health 
condition; and because of a serious 
health condition that makes the 
employee unable to perform the 
functions of the employee’s job). FMLA 
section 404 requires the Secretary of 
Labor to prescribe such regulations as 
necessary to enforce this Act. 29 U.S.C. 
2654. The proposed regulations provide 
for the following information 
collections, many of which are third- 
party notifications between employers 
and employees. 

A. Employee Notice of Need for 

FMLA Leave [29 U.S.C. 2612(e); 29 CFR 
825.100(d), 825.301(b), 825.302, and 
825.303]. An employee must provide 
the employer at least 30 days’ advance 
notice before FMLA leave is to begin if 
the need for the leave is foreseeable 
based on an expected birth, placement 
for adoption or foster care, or planned 
medical treatment for a serious health 
condition of the employee or of a family 
member. If 30 days’ notice is not 
practicable, such as because of a lack of 
knowledge of approximately when leave 
will be required to begin, a change in 
circumstances, or a medical emergency, 
notice must be given as soon as 
practicable under the facts and 
circumstances of the particular case. In 
neither case must an employee 
expressly assert rights under the FMLA 
or even mention the FMLA. The 
employee must, however, provide 
information that indicates that a 
condition renders the employee unable 
to perform the functions of the job, or 
if the leave is for a family member, that 
the condition renders the family 
member unable to perform daily 
activities; the anticipated duration of 
the absence; and whether the employee 
or the employee’s family member 
intends to visit a health care provider or 
has a condition for which the employee 
or the employee’s family member is 
under the continuing care of a health 
care provider. An employer, generally, 
may require an employee to comply 

with its usual and customary notice and 
procedural requirements for requesting 
leave. 

B. Notice to Employee of FMLA 

Eligibility [29 CFR 825.219 and 
825.300(b)]. When an employee requests 
FMLA leave or when the employer 
acquires knowledge that an employee’s 
leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying 
condition, the employer must notify the 
employee within five business days of 
the employee’s eligibility to take FMLA 
leave and any additional requirements 
for qualifying for such leave. This 
eligibility notice must provide 
information regarding the employee’s 
eligibility for FMLA leave, detail the 
specific responsibilities of the 
employee, and explain any 
consequences of a failure to meet these 
responsibilities. The employer generally 
must provide the notice the first time in 
each six-month period that an employee 
gives notice of the need for FMLA leave; 
however, if the specific information 
provided by the notice changes with 
respect to a subsequent period of FMLA 
leave, the employer would need to 
provide an updated notice. 

C. Medical Certification and 
Recertification [29 U.S.C. 2613, 
2614(c)(3); 29 CFR 825.100(d) and 
825.305 through 825.308]. An employer 
may require that an employee’s leave to 
care for the employee’s seriously-ill 
spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or due 
to the employee’s own serious health 
condition that makes the employee 
unable to perform one or more essential 
functions of the employee’s position, be 
supported by a certification issued by 
the health care provider of the eligible 
employee or of the ill family member. 
The proposal provides that the 
employer may contact the employee’s 
health care provider for purposes of 
clarification and authentication of the 
medical certification (whether initial 
certification or recertification) after the 
employer has given the employee an 
opportunity to cure any deficiencies. In 
addition, an employer must advise an 
employee whenever it finds a 
certification incomplete or insufficient 
and state in writing what additional 
information is necessary to make the 
certification complete and sufficient. An 
employer, at its own expense and 
subject to certain limitations, also may 
require an employee to obtain a second 
and third medical opinion. In addition, 
an employer may also request 
recertification under certain conditions. 
The employer must provide the 
employee at least 15 calendar days to 
provide the initial certification and any 
subsequent recertification. The 
proposed regulations would provide 
that the employer must provide seven

calendar days (unless not practicable 
under the particular circumstances 
despite the employee’s diligent good 
faith efforts) to cure any deficiency 
identified by the employer. 

D. Notice to Employees of FMLA 
Designation [29 CFR 825.300(c) and 
825.301(a)]. When the employer has 
enough information to determine 
whether the leave qualifies as FMLA 
leave (after receiving a medical 
certification, for example), the employer 
must notify the employee within five 
business days of making such 
determination whether the leave has or 
has not been designated as FMLA leave 
and the number of hours, days or weeks 
that will be counted against the 
employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. If 
it is not possible to provide the hours, 
days or weeks that will be counted 
against the employee’s FMLA leave 
entitlement (such as in the case of 
unforeseeable intermittent leave), then 
such information must be provided 
every 30 days to the employee if leave 
is taken during the prior 30-day period. 
If the employer requires paid leave to be 
substituted for unpaid leave, or that 
paid leave taken under an existing leave 
plan be counted as FMLA leave, this 
designation also must be made at the 
time of the FMLA designation. 
E. Fitness-for-Duty Medical 

Certification [29 U.S.C. 2614(a)(4); 29 
CFR 825.100(d) and 825.310]. As a 
condition of restoring an employee 
whose FMLA leave was occasioned by 
the employee’s own serious health 
condition that made the employee 
unable to perform the employee’s job, 
an employer may have a uniformly- 
applied policy or practice that requires 
all similarly-situated employees (i.e., 
same occupation, same serious health 
condition) who take leave for such 
conditions to obtain and present 
certification from the employee’s health 
care provider that the employee is able 
to resume work. The employee has the 
same obligations to participate and 
cooperate in providing a complete and 
sufficient certification to the employer 
in the fitness-for-duty certification 
process as in the initial certification 
process. The DOL is also proposing in 
§ 825.310(g) that an employer be 
permitted to require an employee to 
furnish a fitness-for-duty certificate 
every 30 days if an employee has used 
intermittent leave during that period 
and reasonable safety concerns exist. 

F. Notice to Employees of Change of

12-Month Period for Determining FMLA 
Entitlement [29 CFR 825.200(d)(1)]. An 
employer generally must choose a single 
uniform method from four options 
available under the regulations for 
determining the 12-month period in 

which the 12-week entitlement occurs 
for purposes of FMLA leave. An 
employer wishing to change to another 
alternative is required to give at least 60 
days’ notice to all employees. 

G. Key Employee Notification [29 
U.S.C. 2614(b)(1)(B); 29 CFR 825.219 
and 825.300(b)(3)(vi)]. An employer that 
believes that it may deny reinstatement 
to a key employee must give written 
notice to the employee at the time the 
employee gives notice of the need for 
FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave 
commences, if earlier) that he or she 
qualifies as a key employee. At the same 
time, the employer must also fully 
inform the employee of the potential 
consequences with respect to 
reinstatement and maintenance of 
health benefits if the employer should 
determine that substantial and grievous 
economic injury to the employer’s 
operations would result if the employer 
were to reinstate the employee from 
FMLA leave. If the employer cannot 
immediately give such notice, because 
of the need to determine whether the 
employee is a key employee, the 
employer must give the notice as soon 
as practicable after receiving the 
employee’s notice of a need for leave (or 
the commencement of leave, if earlier). 
If an employer fails to provide such 
timely notice it loses its right to deny 
restoration, even if substantial and 
grievous economic injury will result 
from reinstatement. 

As soon as an employer makes a good 
faith determination—based on the facts 
available—that substantial and grievous 
economic injury to its operations will 
result if a key employee who has given 
notice of the need for FMLA leave or is 
using FMLA leave is reinstated, the 
employer must notify the employee in 
writing of its determination; that the 
employer cannot deny FMLA leave; and 
that the employer intends to deny 
restoration to employment on 
completion of the FMLA leave. The 
employer must serve this notice either 
in person or by certified mail. This 
notice must explain the basis for the 
employer’s finding that substantial and 
grievous economic injury will result, 
and, if leave has commenced, must 
provide the employee a reasonable time 
in which to return to work, taking into 
account the circumstances, such as the 
length of the leave and the urgency of 
the need for the employee to return. 

An employee may still request 

reinstatement at the end of the leave 
period, even if the employee did not 
return to work in response to the 
employer’s notice. The employer must 
then determine whether there will be 
substantial and grievous economic 
injury from reinstatement, based on the 

facts at that time. If the employer 
determines that substantial and grievous 
economic injury will result from 
reinstating the employee, the employer 
must notify the employee in writing (in 
person or by certified mail) of the denial 
of restoration. 

H. Periodic Employee Status Reports 
[29 CFR 825.300(b)(4) and 825.309]. An 
employer may require an employee to 
provide periodic reports regarding the 
employee’s status and intent to return to 
work. 

I. Notice to Employee of Pending 

Cancellation of Health Benefits [29 CFR 
825.212(a)]. Unless an employer 
establishes a policy providing a longer 
grace period, an employer’s obligation 
to maintain health insurance coverage 
ceases under FMLA if an employee’s 
premium payment is more than 30 days 
late. In order to drop the coverage for an 
employee whose premium payment is 
late, the employer must provide written 
notice to the employee that the payment 
has not been received. Such notice must 
be mailed to the employee at least 15 
days before coverage is to cease and 
advise the employee that coverage will 
be dropped on a specified date at least 
15 days after the date of the letter unless 
the payment has been received by that 
date. 

J. Documenting Family Relationship 
[29 CFR 825.122(f)]. An employer may 
require an employee giving notice of the 
need for leave to provide reasonable 
documentation or statement of family 
relationship. This documentation may 
take the form of a child’s birth 
certificate, a court document, a sworn 
notarized statement, a submitted or 
signed tax return, etc. The employer is 
entitled to examine documentation such 
as a birth certificate, etc., but the 
employee is entitled to the return of the 
official document submitted for this 
purpose. 

K. Recordkeeping [29 U.S.C. 2616; 29 
CFR 825.500]. The FMLA provides that 
employers shall make, keep, and 
preserve records pertaining to the FMLA 
in accordance with the recordkeeping 
requirements of Fair Labor Standards 
Act section 11(c), 29 U.S.C. 211(c), and 
regulations issued by the Secretary of 
Labor. This statutory authority provides 
that no employer or plan, fund, or 
program shall be required to submit 
books or records more than once during 
any 12-month period unless the DOL 
has reasonable cause to believe a 
violation of the FMLA exists or is 
investigating a complaint. 

Employers must maintain basic 

payroll and identifying employee data, 
including name, address, and 
occupation; rate or basis of pay and 
terms of compensation; daily and

weekly hours worked per pay period; 
additions to or deductions from wages; 
and total compensation paid; dates 
FMLA leave is taken by FMLA eligible 
employees (available from time records, 
requests for leave, etc., if so designated). 
Leave must be designated in records as 
FMLA leave; leave so designated may 
not include leave required under State 
law or an employer plan which is not 
also covered by FMLA; if FMLA leave 
is taken by eligible employees in 
increments of less than one full day, the 
hours of the leave; copies of employee 
notices of leave furnished to the 
employer under FMLA, if in writing, 
and copies of all eligibility notices given 
to employees as required under FMLA 
and these regulations; any documents 
(including written and electronic 
records) describing employee benefits or 
employer policies and practices 
regarding the taking of paid and unpaid 
leaves; premium payments of employee 
benefits; records of any dispute between 
the employer and an eligible employee 
regarding designation of leave as FMLA 
leave, including any written statement 
from the employer or employee of the 
reasons for the designation and for the 
disagreement. 

Covered employers with no eligible 

employees must maintain the basic 
payroll and identifying employee data 
already discussed. Covered employers 
that jointly employ workers with other 
employers must keep all the records 
required by the regulations with respect 
to any primary employees, and must 
keep the basic payroll and identifying 
employee data with respect to any 
secondary employees. 

If FMLA-eligible employees are not 

subject to FLSA recordkeeping 
regulations for purposes of minimum 
wage or overtime compliance (i.e., not 
covered by, or exempt from, FLSA), an 
employer need not keep a record of 
actual hours worked (as otherwise 
required under FLSA, 29 CFR 
516.2(a)(7)), provided that: eligibility for 
FMLA leave is presumed for any 
employee who has been employed for at 
least 12 months; and with respect to 
employees who take FMLA leave 
intermittently or on a reduced leave 
schedule, the employer and employee 
agree on the employee’s normal 
schedule or average hours worked each 
week and reduce their agreement to a 
written record. 

Employers must maintain records and 

documents relating to any medical 
certification, recertification or medical 
history of an employee or employee’s 
family member, created for FMLA 
purposes as confidential medical 
records in separate files/records from 
the usual personnel files. Employers

must also maintain such records in 
conformance with any applicable ADA 
confidentiality requirements; except 
that: supervisors and managers may be 
informed regarding necessary 
restrictions on the work or duties of an 
employee and necessary 
accommodations; first aid and safety 
personnel may be informed, when 
appropriate, if the employee’s physical 
or medical condition might require 
emergency treatment; and government 
officials investigating compliance with 
the FMLA, or other pertinent law, shall 
be provided relevant information upon 
request. 

The FLSA recordkeeping 

requirements, contained in 29 CFR part 
516, are currently approved under 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) control number 1215–0017; 
consequently, this information 
collection does not duplicate their 
burden, despite the fact that for the 
administrative ease of the regulated 
community this information collection 
restates them. 

L. Military Family Leave [29 U.S.C. 

2612(e), 2613]: The military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 extend to the 
new leave provision related to care for 
a servicemember the FMLA’s existing 
requirements for employees to provide 
advance notice when the need for leave 
is foreseeable based on planned medical 
treatment, and for making reasonable 
efforts to schedule planned medical 
treatment so as not to disrupt unduly 
the employer’s operations. The military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 
also provide for new notice 
requirements for leave taken due to 
qualifying exigencies whenever the 
need for such leave is foreseeable. The 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 require that eligible employees 
provide notice to the employer that is 
‘‘reasonable and practicable’’ in these 
circumstances. 

The military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 allow employers to apply 
the FMLA’s existing medical 
certification requirements for serious 
health conditions to leave taken to care 
for a covered servicemember. In 
addition, the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 also permit the 
Secretary of Labor to prescribe a new 
certification requirement to leave taken 
because of a qualifying exigency arising 
out of a servicemember’s active duty or 
call to active duty. 

The earlier preamble discussion on 

Family Leave in Connection with 
Injured Members of the Armed Forces 
and Qualifying Exigencies Related to 
Active Duty provides a fuller 
explanation of the specific provisions 

and issues on which the Department 
seeks public comments. 

Purpose and Use: The WHD has 

created optional use Forms WH–380, 
WH–381, and the proposed WH–382 to 
assist employees and employers in 
meeting their FMLA third-party 
notification obligations. Form WH–380 
allows an employee requesting FMLA 
leave based on a serious health 
condition to satisfy the statutory 
requirement to furnish, upon the 
employer’s request, a medical 
certification (including a second or third 
opinion and recertification) from the 
health care provider. See §§ 825.306 and 
825.307 and Appendices B, D, and E. 
Form WH–381 allows an employer to 
satisfy the regulatory requirement to 
provide employees taking FMLA leave 
with written notice detailing specific 
expectations and obligations of the 
employee and explaining any 
consequences of a failure to meet these 
obligations. See § 825.301(b). Form WH– 
382 allows an employer to meet its 
obligation to designate an absence as 
FMLA leave. See §§ 825.300(c) and 825 
.301(a). While the use of the DOL forms 
is optional, the regulations require 
employers and employees to make the 
third-party disclosures that the forms 
cover. The FMLA third-party 
disclosures ensure that both employers 
and employees are aware of and can 
exercise their rights and meet their 
respective obligations under FMLA. 

The recordkeeping requirements are 
necessary in order for the DOL to carry 
out its statutory obligation under FMLA 
section 106 to investigate and ensure 
employer compliance. The WHD uses 
these records to determine employer 
compliance. 

Information Technology: The 

proposed regulations continue to 
prescribe no particular order or form of 
records. See § 825.500(b). The 
preservation of records in such forms as 
microfilm or automated word or data 
processing memory is acceptable, 
provided the employer maintains the 
information and provides adequate 
facilities to the DOL for inspection, 
copying, and transcription of the 
records. In addition, photocopies of 
records are also acceptable under the 
regulations. Id. 

Aside from the basic requirement that 

all third-party notifications be in 
writing, with a possible exception for 
the employee’s FMLA request that 
depends on the employer’s leave 
policies, there are no restrictions on the 
method of transmission. Respondents 
may meet many of their notification 
obligations by using DOL-prepared 
publications available on the WHD Web 
site. These forms are in a PDF, fillable

made a matter of public record, and 
posted without change to http:// 
www.regulations.gov, including any 
personal information provided. 

An agency may not conduct an 

information collection unless it has a 
currently valid OMB approval, and the 
DOL has submitted the identified 
information collections contained in the 
proposed rule to the OMB for review 
under the PRA under Control Number 
1215–0181. See 44 U.S.C. 3507(d); 5 
CFR 1320.11. While much of the 
information provided to the OMB in 
support of the information collection 
request appears in this preamble, 
interested parties may obtain a copy of 
the full supporting statement by sending 
a written request to the mail address 
shown in the ADDRESSES section at the 
beginning of this preamble or by visiting 
the http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/ 
PRAMain Web site. 

In addition to having an opportunity 

to file comments with the DOL, 
comments about the paperwork 
implications of the proposed regulations 
may be addressed to the OMB. 
Comments to the OMB should be 
directed to: Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Attention OMB Desk 
Officer for the Employment Standards 
Administration (ESA), Office of 
Management and Budget, Room 10235, 
Washington, DC 20503, Telephone: 
202–395–7316/Fax: 202–395–6974 
(these are not toll-free numbers). 

Confidentiality: The DOL makes no 

assurances of confidentiality to 
respondents. Much of the information 
covered by this information collection 
consists of third-party disclosures. 
Employers generally must maintain 
records and documents relating to any 
medical certification, recertification, or 
medical history of an employee or 
employee’s family members as 
confidential medical records in separate 
files/records from usual personnel files. 
Employers must also generally maintain 
such records in conformance with any 
applicable ADA confidentiality 
requirements. As a practical matter, the 
DOL would only disclose agency 
investigation records of materials 
subject to this collection in accordance 
with the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the 
attendant regulations, 29 CFR part 70, 
and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 
its attendant regulations, 29 CFR part 
71. 

Hours Burden Estimates: The DOL 

bases the following burden estimates on 
the estimates the PRIA presented 
elsewhere in this document, except as 
otherwise noted. The DOL estimates 
77.1 million employees were eligible for 
FMLA leave in 2005. The FMLA applied 

format for downloading and printing. 
The employers may keep recordkeeping 
requirements covered by this 
information collection in any form, 
including electronic. 

Minimizing Duplication: The FMLA 

information collections do not duplicate 
other existing information collections. 
In order to provide all relevant FMLA 
information in one set of requirements, 
the recordkeeping requirements restate a 
portion of the records employers must 
maintain under the FLSA. Employers do 
not need to duplicate the records when 
basic records maintained to meet FLSA 
requirements also document FMLA 
compliance. The additional records 
required by the FMLA regulations, with 
the exception of specifically tracking 
FMLA leave, are records that employers 
ordinarily maintain for monitoring 
employee leave in the usual and 
ordinary course of business. The 
regulations do impose, however, a three- 
year minimum time limit that 
employers must make the records 
available for inspection, copying, and 
transcription by the DOL. The DOL 
minimizes the FMLA information 
collection burden by accepting records 
maintained by employers as a matter of 
usual or customary business practices. 
The DOL also accepts records kept due 
to requirements of other governmental 
requirements (e.g., records maintained 
for tax and payroll purposes). The DOL 
has reviewed the needs of both 
employers and employees to determine 
the frequency of the third-party 
notifications covered by this collection 
to establish frequencies that provide 
timely information with the least 
burden. The DOL has further minimized 
burden by developing prototype notices 
for many of the third-party disclosures 
covered by this information collection. 
Agency Need: The DOL is assigned a 

statutory responsibility to ensure 
employer compliance with the FMLA. 
The DOL uses records covered by the 
FMLA information collection to 
determine compliance, as required of 
the agency by FMLA section 107(b)(1). 
29 U.S.C. 2617(b)(1). Without the third- 
party notifications required by the law 
and/or regulations, employers and 
employees would have difficulty 
knowing their FMLA rights and 
obligations. 

Special Circumstances: Because of the 
unforeseeable and often urgent nature of 
the need for FMLA leave, notice and 
response times must be of short 
duration to ensure that employers and 
employees are sufficiently informed and 
can exercise their FMLA rights and 
obligations. The discussion above 
outlines the circumstances necessitating 
the information collection and provides

the details of when employees and 
employers must provide certain notices. 

Employers must maintain employee 

medical information they obtain for 
FMLA purposes as confidential medical 
records in separate files/records from 
the usual personnel files. Employers 
must also maintain such records in 
conformance with any applicable ADA 
confidentiality requirements, except 
that: supervisors and managers may be 
informed regarding necessary 
restrictions on the work or duties of an 
employee and necessary 
accommodations; first aid and safety 
personnel may be informed (when 
appropriate) if the employee’s physical 
or medical condition might require 
emergency treatment; and government 
officials investigating compliance with 
FMLA (or other pertinent law) shall be 
provided relevant information upon 
request. 

Public Comments: On December 1, 

2006, the DOL published a Request for 
Information (RFI) in the Federal 
Register inviting public comment about 
the FMLA paperwork requirements and 
other issues. 71 FR 69504. On June 28, 
2007, the DOL published a report that 
summarized the comments received in 
response to the RFI. 72 FR 35550. The 
DOL also engaged various stakeholders 
representing the interests of employees, 
employers, and healthcare providers to 
discuss the FMLA information 
collection requirements. The proposed 
FMLA regulations reflect the results of 
these efforts. 

The DOL seeks additional public 

comments regarding the burdens 
imposed by information collections 
contained in this proposed rule. In 
particular, the DOL seeks comments 
that: evaluate whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
functions of the agency, including 
whether the information will have 
practical utility; evaluate the accuracy 
of the agency’s estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; 
enhance the quality, utility and clarity 
of the information to be collected; and 
minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on those who are to 
respond, including through the use of 
appropriate automated, electronic, 
mechanical, or other technological 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology, e.g., permitting 
electronic submissions of responses. 
Commenters may send their views about 
these information collections to the DOL 
in the same way as all other comments 
(e.g., through the regulations.gov Web 
site). All comments received will be

7938 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

to approximately 415,000 private 
business establishments and State and 
local governments in 2005. See County 
Business Patterns, 2005, U.S. Census 
Bureau, http://censtats.census.gov/cgi- 
bin/cbpnaic/cbpsel.pl; and Census of 
Governments, Volume 3, Public 
Employment, Compendium of Public 
Employment: 2002 at 248–249, http:// 
www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/ 
gc023x2.pdf. The PRIA data also suggest 
7 million employees took FMLA leave 
in 2005. 

A. Employee Notice of Need for 

FMLA Leave. While employees 
normally will provide general 
information regarding their absences, 
the regulations may impose 
requirements for workers to provide 
their employers with more detailed 
information than might otherwise be the 
case. The DOL estimates that providing 
this additional information will take 
approximately two minutes per 
employee notice of the need to take 
FMLA leave. In addition, Westat Report 
data indicate about 75 percent of FMLA 
users take leave in a single block, 15 
percent take leave in two blocks, and 10 
percent take leave in more than two 
blocks. See 2000 Westat Report at 2–3, 
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/fmla/ 
chapter2.pdf. The DOL, consequently, 
estimates FMLA leave takers, on a per 
capita basis, annually provide 1.5 
notices of the need for FMLA leave. In 
addition, the PRIA estimates some 
employees who are not eligible for 
FMLA protections will make some 
2,200,000 requests for FMLA leave. 
(7,000,000 FMLA covered employee 
respondents × 1.5 valid responses 
[i.e., notices to employers]) + 
2,200,000 ineligible FMLA requests = 
12,700,000 total responses 
12,700,000 total responses × 2 minutes/ 
60 minutes per hour = 423,333 hours 
B. Notice to Employee of FMLA 

Eligibility. The DOL estimates that each 
written notice to an employee of FMLA 
eligibility, rights, and responsibilities 
takes approximately ten minutes. 
Consistent with the estimates for the 
number of notices employees provide, 
the DOL estimates that employers will 
provide 12,700,000 FMLA eligibility 
notices to employees. Employers may 
use optional Form WH–381 to satisfy 
this requirement. 
12,700,000 total responses × 10 

minutes/60 minutes per hour = 
2,116,667 hours 
C. Medical Certification and 

Recertification. The DOL estimates 81.5 
percent of employees taking FMLA 
leave do so because of their own serious 
health condition or that of a family 
member. See 2000 Westat Report at 2– 

5, http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/ 
fmla/chapter2.pdf. The DOL also 
estimates 92 percent of these employees 
provide medical certifications. See 2000 
Westat Report at A–2–51. Additionally, 
the DOL estimates that second or third 
opinions and/or recertifications add 15 
percent to the total number of 
certifications and that employees spend 
an average of 20 minutes in obtaining 
the certifications. Employers may have 
employees use optional Form WH–380 
to satisfy this requirement. 
7,000,000 employees taking FMLA leave 

× 81.5% rate for serious health 
condition × 92% asked to provide 
initial medical certifications = 
5,248,600 employee respondents 

5,248,600 employee respondents × 1.15 
responses = 6,035,890 total responses 
6,035,890 total responses × 20 minutes/ 

60 minutes per hour = 2,011,963 
hours 
The DOL associates no paperwork 

burden with the portion of this 
information collection employers 
complete, since—even absent the 
FMLA—similar information would 
customarily appear in their internal 
instructions requesting a medical 
certification or recertification. The DOL 
accounts for health care provider 
burdens to complete these certifications 
as a ‘‘maintenance and operation’’ cost 
burden, discussed later. 

D. Notice to Employees of FMLA 

Designation. The DOL estimates that 
each written FMLA designation notice 
takes approximately ten minutes and 
that there are 10,500,000 FMLA leaves 
taken each year. Employers can 
designate FMLA leave at the same time 
they provide the eligibility notice about 
25 percent of the time, based on the 
number of instances where employers 
request a medical certification. 
According to a 2005 WorldatWork 
survey, 28.6 percent of absences result 
from either chronic or permanent/long 
term conditions. (See FMLA 
Perspectives and Practices: Survey of 
WorldatWork Members, April 2005, 
WorldatWork, Figure 9a, p. 8.) 
Assuming that this applies to FMLA 
leave takers, the DOL estimates that the 
notices will have to be sent to about 
2,000,000 workers (i.e., 28.6% of 7 
million) taking FMLA for either chronic 
or permanent/long term conditions. For 
purposes of estimating the paperwork 
burden, the DOL assumes that for 
workers with chronic conditions (either 
temporary or permanent) ten additional 
notices will have to be provided each 
year to each of these employees. 
7,875,000 initial notices + 20,000,000 
additional notices = 27,875,000 total 
responses 

27,875,000 total responses × 10 

minutes/60 minutes per hour = 
4,645,833 hours 
E. Fitness-for-Duty Medical 

Certification. The DOL estimates that 
367,000 employees will each have to 
provide one fitness for duty certification 
and 44,000 employees will each have to 
provide three such certifications, for a 
total of 499,000 certifications provided 
by 411,000 employees and that each 
fitness for duty certification will require 
ten minutes of the employee’s time. 
499,000 responses × 10 minutes/60 
minutes per hour = 83,167 hours 
The DOL accounts for health care 
provider burdens to complete these 
certifications as a ‘‘maintenance and 
operation’’ cost burden, discussed later. 

F. Notice to Employees of Change of 

12-Month Period for Determining FMLA 
Entitlement. The DOL estimates that 
annually 10 percent of FMLA covered 
employers choose to change their 12- 
month period for determining FMLA 
eligibility and must notify employees of 
the change, requiring approximately 10 
minutes per change. 
415,000 covered employers × 10% 
response rate = 41,500 respondents 
41,500 respondents × 10 minutes/60 

minutes = 6917 hours 
G. Key Employee Notification. The 

‘‘key employee’’ status notification to an 
employee is part of the employee 
eligibility notice; accordingly, the DOL 
associates no additional burden for the 
initial notification. The DOL estimates 
that annually 10 percent of employers 
notify one employee of the intent not to 
restore the employee at the conclusion 
of FMLA leave. In addition, the DOL 
estimates half of these cases will require 
the employer to issue a second notice 
from the employer to address a key 
employee’s subsequent request for 
reinstatement. Finally, the DOL 
estimates each key employee 
notification takes approximately 5 
minutes. The DOL associates no 
paperwork burden with the employee 
requests, since these employees would 
ordinarily ask for reinstatement even if 
the rule were not to exist. 
415,000 covered employers × 10% 
response rate = 41,500 employer 
respondents 
41,500 employer respondents × 1.5 
responses = 62,250 total responses 
62,250 total responses × 5 minutes/60 

minutes = 5188 hours 
H. Periodic Employee Status Reports. 

The DOL estimates employers require 
periodic reports from 25 percent of 
FMLA leave users (based on the 
percentage of FMLA leave takers with 
absences lasting more than 30 days). See

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

7939 

2000 Westat Report at A–2–29, http:// 
www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/fmla/ 
appendixa-2.pdf. The DOL also 
estimates a typical employee would 
normally respond to an employer’s 
request for a status report; however, to 
account for any additional burden the 
regulations might impose, the DOL 
estimates a 10 percent response rate and 
a burden of two minutes per response. 
The DOL also estimates that each such 
respondent annually provides two 
periodic status reports. While the DOL 
believes most employers would only 
seek these reports in accordance with 
customary business practices, the 
agency has accounted for any potential 
additional employer burden in the 
‘‘Eligibility Notice.’’ 
7,000,000 FMLA leave takers × 25% rate 

of employer requests × 10% 
regulatory burden = 175,000 
employee respondents 

175,000 employee respondents × 2 
responses = 350,000 total responses 
350,000 total responses × 2 minutes/60 

minutes per hour = 11,667 hours 
I. Notice to Employee of Pending 
Cancellation of Health Benefits. The 
DOL estimates the regulations require 
employers send notifications of not 
having received health insurance 
premiums to 2% of leave takers, based 
on the number of employees indicating 
they have lost benefits. For purposes of 
estimating the paperwork burden 
associated with this information 
collection, the DOL expects that unique 
respondents would send all responses. 
See 2000 Westat Report at 4–4, http:// 
www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/fmla/ 
chapter4.pdf. The DOL also estimates 
each notification will take 5 minutes. 
7,000,000 FMLA leave takers × 2% rate 

notification = 140,000 respondents 
and responses 

140,000 responses × 5 minutes/60 
minutes per hour = 11,667 hours 

J. Documenting Family Relationships. 
The DOL estimates 50% of FMLA leave 
takers do so for ‘‘family’’ related 
reasons, such as caring for a newborn or 
recently adopted child or a qualifying 
family member with a serious health 
condition. See 2000 Westat Report at 2– 
5, http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/ 
fmla/chapter2.pdf. The DOL also 
estimates employers require additional 
documentation to support a family 
relationship in 5 percent of these cases, 
and the additional documentation 
requires 20 minutes. 
7,000,000 employees taking FMLA leave 

× 50% rate for family leave × 5% 
response rate = 175,000 employee 
respondents 
175,000 × 20 minutes/60 minutes per 

hour = 58,333 hours 
K. General Recordkeeping. The DOL 

estimates the FMLA imposes an 
additional general recordkeeping 
burden on each employer that equals 
1.25 minutes for each notation of an 
employee absence. 
10,500,000 total records × 1.25 minutes/ 
60 minutes per hour = 218,750 hours 
L. Military Family Leave. This 

‘‘paperwork burden’’ analysis estimates 
the burdens for the proposed regulations 
as drafted. The Department anticipates 
issuing, after full consideration of the 
comments received in response to the 
Proposed Rule, final regulations that 
will include necessary revisions to the 
currently proposed FMLA information 
burden estimates to account for the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986. 
GRAND TOTAL ANNUAL BURDEN 

HOURS = 9,593,485 HOURS 
Persons responding to the various 

FMLA information collections may be 
employees of any of a wide variety of 
businesses. Absent specific wage data 
regarding respondents, the DOL has 

used the average hourly rate of non- 
supervisory workers on non-farm 
payrolls for September 2007 of $17.62 
plus 40 percent for fringe benefits to 
estimate respondent costs. See The 
Employment Situation, November 2007, 
at DOL, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
(http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ 
archives/empsit_12072007.pdf). The 
DOL estimates total annual respondent 
costs for the value of their time to be 
$236,652,088 ($17.62 × 1.4 × 9,593,485 
hours). 

Other Respondent Cost Burdens 

(Maintenance and Operation): 
Employees seeking FMLA leave for a 
serious health condition must obtain, 
upon their employer’s request, a 
certification of the serious health 
condition from a health care provider. 
Often the heath care provider’s office 
staff completes the form for the 
provider’s signature. In other cases, the 
health care provider personally 
completes it. While most health care 
providers do not charge for completing 
these certifications, some do. The DOL 
estimates completion of Form WH–380 
to take about 20 minutes and a fitness- 
for-duty certification to require 10 
minutes; thus, the time would equal the 
respondent’s time in obtaining the 
certification. The DOL has used the 
2005 average hourly wage rate for a 
physician’s assistant of $36.49 plus 40 
percent in fringe benefits to compute a 
$17.03 cost for Form WH–380 ($51.09 × 
20 minutes/60 minutes per hour) and 
$8.52 cost for fitness-for-duty 
certifications ($51.09 × 10 minutes/60 
minutes per hour) See National

Federal Costs: The Federal costs that 

the DOL associates with this 
information collection relate to printing/ 
duplicating and mailing the subject 
forms. The DOL also estimates it will 
annually provide an average of one copy 

of each form covered by this 
information collection to each FMLA- 
covered employer, and that the agency 
will mail all forms simultaneously to 
any given requestor. The DOL further 
estimates information technology costs 

will offset some of the printing and 
duplicating costs in an equal amount; 
therefore, the agency is presenting only 
the costs of the latter: 

415,000 WH–380s (Certification of Health Care Provider) × 4 pages = ............................................................................... 1,660,000 pages. 
415,000 WH–381s (Notice to Employee of FMLA Eligibility) × 2 pages = ........................................................................... 830,000 pages. 
415,000 WH–382s (Notice to Employee of FMLA Designation) × 1 page = ........................................................................ 415,000 pages. 

Total Forms = 1,245,000, Total pages = 2,905,000.

2,905,000 pages × $0.03 printing costs = ............................................................................................................... $87,150. 
1,245,000 forms × $0.03 envelopes = .................................................................................................................... $37,350.

Executive Order 12866, the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act, and the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act 

This rule has been drafted and 

reviewed in accordance with Executive 
Order 12866, Section 1(b), Principles of 
Regulation. The Department has 
preliminarily determined that this 
proposed rule is an ‘‘economically 
significant’’ regulatory action under 
Section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 
12866, based on the analysis presented 
below. As a result, the Office of 
Management and Budget has reviewed 
this proposed rule. The Department also 
has concluded that this proposed rule is 
a major rule under the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996 (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.). In addition, 
the Department has certified that the 
proposed rule as drafted will not have 
‘‘a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities’’ 
and, therefore, has not prepared an 
initial regulatory flexibility analysis 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980 (see the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
section below). However, the new 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 will result in an increase in the 

annual number of FMLA leaves taken. If 
these additional leaves significantly 
increase the economic impacts imposed 
by the FMLA regulation on a substantial 
number of small businesses, then a 
regulatory flexibility analysis will be 
required. 

The Department has prepared a 

Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis 
(PRIA) in connection with this rule, 
which is presented below in its entirety. 
Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis 
of the Proposed Revisions to the Family 
and Medical Leave Act Regulations 
Chapter 1: Industry Profile 
Background 

The Family and Medical Leave Act 

established a bipartisan Commission on 
Family and Medical Leave to study 
family and medical leave policies and 
their impact on workers and their 
employers. The Commission surveyed 
workers and employers and issued a 
report in 1995.16 

In 1999, the Department contracted 

with Westat to update the employee and 
establishment surveys conducted in 
1995.17 The two surveys were 
completed in 2000. A report entitled 
‘‘Balancing the Needs of Families and 
Employers: Family and Medical Leave 
Surveys, 2000 Update’’ (the ‘‘2000 
Westat Report’’) was published in 
January 2001.18 

In 2006, the Department published a 

Request for Information (RFI) seeking 
public comment on the Department’s 
administration and implementation of 
the FMLA regulations.19 To assist in 
analyzing the impacts of the FMLA, the 
Department presented estimates of the 
coverage and usage of FMLA leave in 
2005 in the ‘‘FMLA Coverage and Usage 
Estimates’’ section of the RFI (71 FR 
69510). That presentation updated 
Westat’s estimates of the number of 
workers employed at establishments 
covered by the FMLA, the number of 
workers eligible for FMLA leave at 
covered establishments, and the number 
of workers who took FMLA leave in 
2005 (the latest year for which BLS 
employment data was available). It also 
highlighted a number of important 
findings in the 2000 Westat Report 
including some of the limitations in 
using the estimates presented in the 
report that were noted by Westat and 
others. 

The methodology to calculate the 

estimates presented in the RFI was to 
apply coverage, eligibility, and usage 
rates from the 2000 Westat Report to 
employment estimates from the 2005 
Current Population Survey to produce 
national estimates of FMLA coverage, 
eligibility, and usage. The estimates the 
Department developed using this 
methodology are reproduced in Table 1 
below.

As discussed in the Department’s 
report entitled ‘‘Family and Medical 
Leave Act Regulations: A Report on the 
Department of Labor’s Request for 
Information’’ (the ‘‘RFI Report’’), the 
Department did not receive any 
substantive comments on its coverage or 

eligibility estimates, or the methodology 
it used to produce those estimates.20 
However, the Department received 
many comments regarding the FMLA 
leave usage rates that the Department 
used. 

In the RFI, the Department presented 

three estimates of the percent (or rate) 
of covered and eligible workers who 
took FMLA leave in 2005, and asked for 
information and data on the estimates. 
These estimates are reproduced in Table 
2 below.

Family and Medical Leave Policies.’’ The report is

Source: U.S. Department of Labor, ‘‘Family and Medical Leave Act Regulations: A Report on the Department of Labor’s Request for Informa-

tion’’ (72 FR at 35622). 

In response to the RFI the Department 
received a significant amount of data on 
FMLA leave usage from a wide variety 
of sources, including nationally 
representative survey data and detailed 
information from specific employers, 
both large and small, in a wide variety 
of industries. Although many of the 
comments concerning FMLA usage rates 
submitted data higher than the 
employer survey based estimate 
presented in Table 2 above, many of the 
comments included usage rates that 
were consistent with the range of 
estimates presented in the RFI and 
Table 2. Clearly, some employers in 
some industries will experience higher 
rates of usage just as other employers in 
other industries may experience lower 
rates. Indeed, a few comments to the RFI 
suggested the Department develop 
industry specific estimates because the 
issues related to the FMLA vary by 
industry. 

The RFI was a useful information 

collection method that yielded a wide 
variety of objective survey data and 
research, as well as a considerable 
amount of company-specific data and 
information. As explained in the RFI 
and the RFI Report, despite the 
criticisms and limitations of the 2000 
Westat Report,21 the Department 
believes that it provides a great deal of 
useful information and data on FMLA 
leave-takers. Moreover, based upon that 
data, coupled with the information 
received in response to the RFI, the 
Department has significantly 
supplemented and updated its 
knowledge of the impacts of FMLA 
leave, particularly intermittent FMLA 
leave. 

Data Sources and Total Estimates by 
Industry 

The estimates presented in this 

Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis 
(PRIA) are primarily derived from an 
industry profile developed by CONSAD 
Research.22 Just as the Department did 
for the RFI, CONSAD used data from the 
2000 Westat Report as the basis for 
many of its estimates. However, rather 
than applying the Westat coverage, 
eligibility, and usage rates to data from 
the Current Population Survey (CPS), 
CONSAD primarily used data from the 
U.S. Census Bureau, 2005 County 
Business Patterns (CBP). The CBP data 
was used because it provides data on 
the number of employees, 
establishments, and the size of the 
payroll in each industry, as well as 
these data by size of establishment. 
However, since the CBP only covers 
most non-agricultural businesses in the 
private sector, CONSAD supplemented 
the CBP with data from other sources 
including the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Census of Agriculture, 
2002, the U.S. Census Bureau, Census of 
Governments, Compendium of Public 
Employment, 2002, the annual reports 
of certain Federal agencies (Bonneville 
Power Authority and Tennessee Valley 
Authority), the Association of American 
Railroads, Railroad Service in the 
United States, 2005, and the U.S. Postal 
Service, Annual Report, 2006. 

CONSAD estimated the number of 

firms based upon the U.S. Census 
Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Business, 
2004. The Statistics of U.S. Business is 
based upon the same underlying data as 
CBP, but presents the data on a firm 
basis rather than the establishment basis 
presented in the CBP. This was an 
important consideration in studying the 

FMLA regulations, since the 50- 
employee cutoff above which the FMLA 
applies refers to the number of 
employees at a particular firm within a 
geographic area. The Statistics of U.S. 
Business contains both the number of 
firms and the number of establishments 
in those firms at the 2-digit industry 
level. 

CONSAD based its estimates of 

revenues at the 2-digit industry level 
primarily on data from the U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2002 Economic Census series 
(2005). Depending upon the particular 
industry sector, CONSAD used the 
value of shipments, value of business 
done, receipts, sales, or revenues, in 
conjunction with the employment 
estimates in the Economic Census. In 
addition, CONSAD obtained some 
revenue estimates directly from the 
Census of Agriculture, as well as in the 
annual reports for the Bonneville Power 
Authority, the Tennessee Valley 
Authority, and the U.S. Postal Service.23 

CONSAD developed estimates of net 
income before taxes (profits) for each 2- 
digit industry primarily from the 
Statistics of Income, 2004, published by 
the Internal Revenue Service. In 
addition, CONSAD obtained net income 
estimates directly from the annual 
reports for the Bonneville Power 
Authority, the Tennessee Valley 
Authority, and the U.S. Postal Service.24 

Table 3 below presents CONSAD’s 
estimates of the total number of firms, 
establishments, and employees in the 2- 
digit industries in which Title I of the 
FMLA applies. It also presents the 
annual payroll, revenues, and profits for 
each 2-digit industry sector. See the 
CONSAD Report for the complete 
details on these estimates.25

Table 3, 139.361 million, is very close 
to the total number of workers (less 
Federal employees) in 2005 published 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
139.773 million. The difference is just 
412,000, or 0.3 percent—not enough to 
significantly affect the estimates 
presented below. 
FMLA Coverage and Eligibility 
Estimates 

Title I of the FMLA covers private- 

sector employers of 50 or more 
employees, public agencies and certain 
Federal employers and entities, such as 
the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal 
Rate Commission. To be eligible for 
FMLA benefits, an employee must: (1) 
Work for a covered employer; (2) have 
worked for the employer for a total of 
12 months; (3) have worked at least 
1,250 hours over the previous 12 
months; and 4) work at a location where 
at least 50 employees are employed by 
the employer within 75 miles. 

CONSAD’s best estimate of FMLA 

coverage, by 2-digit industry, was 
developed by summing the number of 
establishments with 50 or more 
employees from the CBP with data from 
the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of 
U.S. Business for estimates of 
employment in private firms with 50 or

more employees within a 75 mile radius 
of each other. Some additional data for 
the operations not covered by the CBP 
and Statistics of U.S. Business (i.e., the 
estimates from Census of Agriculture, 
Census of Governments, U.S. Postal 
Service, Association of American 
Railroads, Bonneville Power Authority, 
and Tennessee Valley Authority) were 
also used. 

All employers in primary and 

secondary education are covered. 
Although data for the U.S. Postal 
Service, classified by the employment 
size of the post office, are not available, 
CONSAD assumed that all career postal 
workers are employed at worksites 
where 50 or more employees work for 
the U.S. Postal Service within 75 miles 
of those locations and that all non- 
career postal workers, which primarily 
include casual workers and workers at 
rural substations, likely do not meet the 
coverage and eligibility requirements 
relating to worksite location or to job 
tenure and working hours (and are not 
included in these estimates). 

For the railroad industry (more 

specifically, the freight railroad 
industry), data for 2005 from the 
Association of American Railroads 
include Class I railroads, regional line 
haul railroads, local line haul carriers, 

and switching and terminal carriers. 
Based on the average employment in 
each type of freight railroad, CONSAD 
assumed that Class I railroads and 
regional line haul railroads are, in 
general, covered under the FMLA, while 
local line haul carriers and switching 
and terminal carriers are generally not 
covered because they generally do not 
employ 50 or more workers. 

Data for the agricultural sectors are 

from the 2002 Census of Agriculture for 
both crop production and animal 
production combined. These data 
identify those farms with 10 or more 
workers and those workers on these 
farms who are employed at least 150 
days per year. To the extent that these 
farms have a total of 50 or more 
employees (and the data suggest that 
they likely would when the average 
number of workers employed on these 
farms working less than 150 days per 
year is added into the average number 
of workers employed on these farms 
working at least 150 days per year), 
these farms would then be covered 
under the FMLA. Their employees 
include those workers employed at least 
150 days per year (and likely eligible for 
FMLA leave), as well as workers 
employed less than 150 days per year 
(and not eligible for FMLA leave).

Note the 95.8 million estimate of the 
total number of workers employed at 

covered establishments based upon this 
methodology and data is close to the 
Department’s estimate of 94.4 million

Estimates of Workers Eligible To Take 
FMLA Leave and FMLA Leave Usage 

The estimates of the number of 

workers eligible to take FMLA leave and 
FMLA leave usage were developed by 
applying estimates from the 2000 Westat 
Report to the coverage estimates. The 
number of workers eligible to take 
FMLA leave in each industry was 
calculated by multiplying Westat’s 
estimate that 80.5 percent of workers 
employed at covered establishments are 
eligible to take FMLA leave 26 by the 
number of workers covered by the 
FMLA in each industry. Note that 
CONSAD’s estimates of the total number 
of workers covered by the FMLA is 
relatively close to the Department’s 
estimates published in the RFI, because 
both were developed by applying the 
same Westat estimate to the number of 
covered employees. 

In the RFI, the Department estimated 
the number of workers who took FMLA 
leave in 2005 by multiplying the 
number of workers employed in 

establishments covered by the FMLA by 
Westat’s estimate that 6.5 percent of 
workers employed at establishments 
covered by the FMLA took FMLA 
leave.27 However, the Department 
received many comments in response to 
RFI that noted this estimate does not 
represent current conditions because 
employees today are more aware of their 
FMLA rights than they were in 1999 
when Westat conducted its survey. In 
the RFI Report, the Department 
concurred and stated that ‘‘awareness of 
the FMLA appears to be higher in 2005 
than in 1999 when Westat conducted its 
surveys. So just as FMLA usage 
increased between the times the two 
surveys sponsored by the Department 
were conducted in the 1990s, given the 
comments received it is likely that 
FMLA usage increased between 1999 
and 2005.’’ (72 FR at 35623) 

To account for the increase in 

employee awareness of the FMLA, 
CONSAD examined the changes in 
FMLA usage between the 1995 and the 
1999 surveys commissioned by the 

26 DOL estimate developed from 2000 Westat 

Report, p. A–2–21. 

27 See 2000 Westat Report, pp. 3–14—3–15. 

Department. CONSAD then assumed 
that the extrapolation would look like a 
typical learning curve and plotted three 
points corresponding to zero FMLA 
leave taking in 1993, 3.6 percent in 
1995, and 6.5 percent in 2000, and 
sketched a smooth, monotonically 
increasing curve through the points and 
projected it through 2007. On this basis, 
CONSAD estimated that the curve 
would have a value of roughly 7.3 in 
2007 (i.e., 7.3 percent of workers 
employed at establishments covered by 
the FMLA currently take FMLA leave). 

Estimates of the number of workers 

taking FMLA in each industry were then 
calculated by multiplying the estimated 
number of workers covered by the 
FMLA in each industry by 7.3 percent. 
See Table 5 below. 

The number of workers who took 
intermittent FMLA leave in 2005 in 
each industry was estimated by 
multiplying Westat’s estimate that 23.9 
percent of workers who take FMLA 
leave take some of the leave 
intermittently (i.e., they repeatedly took 
leave for a few hours or days at a time 
because of ongoing family or medical

Although the Department presented a 

range for the number of FMLA leave- 
takers in the RFI Report (see Chapter XI, 
Section D, of the RFI Report (72 FR at 
35550)), for this PRIA the Department 
presents its best estimate—7.0 million 
workers. The Department departed from 
presenting a range here because the 
comments received in response to the 
RFI strongly suggested that the 
Department’s Employer Survey Based 
(point) Estimate that it presented in the 
RFI (6.1 million workers) was 
reasonable and the Department received 
very few comments on the approach 
that it used to develop that estimate. 
Estimates of the Number of FMLA 
Leaves Taken 

Because the impacts of some of the 
proposed revisions are related to the 

number of FMLA leaves taken rather 
than the number of workers taking 
FMLA leave, for this analysis it was 
necessary to estimate the number of 
FMLA leaves taken. To do this, 
CONSAD examined the data collected 
by the Westat employee survey. From 
this survey, CONSAD estimated that 
during 1999, 8.8 million leave-takers 
working in FMLA covered 
establishments took 13.3 million leaves. 
Therefore, on average each leave-taker 
took 1.5 leaves.29 Assuming this rate 
applies to workers taking FMLA leave in 
2005, CONSAD estimates that the 7.0 
million workers taking FMLA leave took 
about 10.5 million leaves in 2005.30 The 
Department did not develop estimates of 
the number of FMLA leaves by industry 
based upon the national average, 
because comments to the RFI indicate 

that leave usage can vary greatly by 
industry.31 
Chapter 2: Estimated Impacts of the 
Proposed Revisions Introduction 

In this Chapter, the Department 

presents its estimates of the impacts of 
the proposed revisions to the FMLA. 
The approach utilized was to present a 
summary of the changes most likely to 
result in behavior changes by covered 
employers and their employees and to 
estimate the monetary value of these 
changes whenever possible. (The 
preamble to the proposed rule provides 
a more detailed discussion of each 
proposed change.) Several findings in 
the Department’s RFI Report, noted 
below, influenced the methodology 
used to estimate the impact of the 
proposed revisions. 

28 Those that answered yes to Question A5B of 

Westat’s employee questionnaire: See 2000 Westat 
Report, Appendix D, p. 10. 

29 It is important to note that the average number 

of leaves is higher for many leave-takers. For 
example, as was noted in the CONSAD Report, the 
covered and eligible leave-takers who reported 
taking both leave intermittently (i.e., repeatedly at 
different times) and taking more than one leave, 
took an average of 4.6 leaves. There also is some 
uncertainty over how respondents interpreted the 
term ‘‘leave’’ (i.e., whether it means each incident/ 
absence or a group of absences for a single 
qualifying condition). For example, 1.3 percent of 
the covered and eligible leave-takers who reported 

taking leave intermittently reported taking no FMLA 
leaves. Another 53.2 percent of the covered and 
eligible leave-takers who reported taking leave 
intermittently reported taking only one FMLA 
leave. Thus, it would appear that many workers 
considered a leave to be a single qualified reason 
(e.g., pregnancy and birth of a child) regardless of 
the number of incidents/absences (e.g., for pre-natal 
care, morning sickness, childbirth, recovery from 
child birth). On the other hand, 8.3 percent of the 
covered and eligible leave-takers who reported 
taking leave intermittently reported taking 10 or 
more FMLA leaves. Presumably, many of these 
leave-takers were reporting the number of incidents 
(e.g., absences, late arrivals, etc.) rather than the 

number of leaves based on different qualifying 
conditions. 

30 Although there is some uncertainty over how 

respondents interpreted the term ‘‘leave’’ in the 
Westat employee survey (see footnote 29), this is 
the Department’s best estimate given available data. 

31 In addition to the difficulty interpreting the 

term ‘‘leave’’ discussed in footnote 29, the Westat 
surveys were not large enough to develop industry- 
specific leave usage estimates. Although 
information provided in response to the RFI 
suggests that leave usage varies by industry, the 
data submitted do not permit the development of 
estimates by industry.

• ‘‘Previous congressional testimony, 
the 2000 Westat Report, other surveys, 
and stakeholder meetings suggest that 
the FMLA has significant benefits and 
costs.’’ (72 FR at 35627) 
• ‘‘Further, most surveys of workers 

and employers show that, while the 
FMLA has been generally effective in 
carrying out the congressional intent of 
the Act, some aspects of the statute and 
regulations have created challenges for 
both workers and employers * * * 
employers report job disruptions and 
adverse effects on the workforce when 
employees take frequent, unscheduled, 
intermittent leave from work with little 
or no advance notice to the employer.’’ 
(72 FR at 35627) 

• ‘‘[S]ome employers are likely to 
incur higher costs than the ‘average’ 
firm responding to Westat’s employer 
survey. If these high costs are clustered 
in specific industries or types of work, 
then the FMLA could impose significant 
costs for those clusters of employers 
while the average number of employers 
may have reported relatively lower 
costs.’’ (72 FR at 35630) 
• ‘‘The RFI record suggests that 
intermittent FMLA leave can have 
significant impacts on time-sensitive 
business models * * * In many 
situations, the absence of just a few 
employees can have a significant impact 
* * * Comments received in response 
to the RFI suggest at least four types of 
business operations appear to have 
particular difficulty with unscheduled 
intermittent FMLA leave: (1) Assembly 
line manufacturing; (2) operations with 
peak demand; (3) transportation 
operations; (4) and operations involving 
public health and safety.’’ (72 FR at 
35632) 

Based on these findings, the 

Department used a bifurcated approach 
to assessing the impacts of the proposed 
revisions. First, the PRIA assesses the 
impacts that are generally applicable to 
most employers and their employees. 
Second, the PRIA qualitatively 
discusses the impacts on employers and 
employees with highly time-sensitive 
operations. 

Although many of the estimates 

presented below are developed from the 
same data sources used in the 
Department’s estimates under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and its attendant 
regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, there are 
several differences in the estimates. 
These differences, however, result from 
the differing requirements imposed by 
the E.O. 12866 and the PRA. For 
example, many of the employer 
estimates developed for the PRIA are 
based upon the number of covered 
establishments while the estimates in 

the PRA are based upon the number of 
respondents, which is often the number 
of employers covered by the FMLA. In 
addition, the estimates in the PRIA 
represent the incremental changes of the 
proposed rule while those in the PRA 
analysis represent the total burden of 
the information collection. In some 
cases, this results in the PRA analysis 
calculating a paperwork burden for an 
information collection that remains 
unchanged from the current regulation 
and is thus not considered an 
incremental cost of the new regulation 
in the PRIA. Conversely, the regulatory 
definition for ‘‘collection of 
information’’ for PRA purposes 
specifically excludes the public 
disclosure of information originally 
supplied by the Federal government to 
the recipient for the purpose of 
disclosure to the public (see 5 CFR 
1320.3(c)(2)), while the PRIA needs to 
consider the impact of any regulatory 
changes in such notifications provided 
by the government. 
Cost of Reviewing and Implementing 
Revisions 

Any change in a regulation will result 
in costs for the regulated community to 
review the changes and revise their 
policies and procedures. The 
Department estimates that, on average, a 
human resource professional at each 
firm with FMLA covered establishments 
will spend an average of six hours to 
review the revised FMLA provisions, 
adjust existing company policies 
accordingly, and disseminate 
information to managers and staff. 
Given that the average hourly wage and 
benefits rate of a Human Resource 
compensation and benefits specialist is 
$36.51,32 the average one time cost per 
covered firm is $219.06 (6 hours × 
$36.51). Multiplying this average cost 
per firm by the estimated 273,937 firms 
that have FMLA covered establishments 
(see the industry profile above) results 
in an estimated one-time cost of about 
$60.0 million for firms to review the 
changes and revise their policies and 
procedures. 
Clarifying the Treatment of Professional 
Employer Organizations (§ 825.106) 

The Department is proposing to 

clarify how the joint employment rules 
apply to Professional Employer 
Organizations (PEOs). Under the 
proposal, PEOs that contract with client 
employers merely to perform 
administrative functions—including 

32 Bureau of Labor Statistics, ‘‘National 

Compensation Survey: Occupational Wages in the 
United States, June 2006.’’ Rate assumes hourly 
wage plus 40% for benefits. 

payroll, benefits, regulatory paperwork, 
and updating employment policies—are 
not joint employers with their clients, 
provided: (1) They do not have the right 
to exercise control over the activities of 
the client’s employees, and do not have 
the right to hire, fire or supervise them, 
or determine their rates of pay, and (2) 
do not benefit from the work that the 
employees perform. 

Based upon the comments received in 
response to the RFI, it appears that some 
commenters were under the erroneous 
impression that PEOs were treated the 
same as temporary staffing agencies. 
Thus, some workers may have been 
mistakenly treated as if they were 
covered by the FMLA when they were 
not. Other comments indicated that 
some small employers do not use PEOs 
because of uncertainty over FMLA 
coverage. Some of these employers may 
choose to use PEOs after the 
clarification and provide their 
employees with some of the benefits 
offered by the PEOs such as access to 
group life and health insurance, and 
retirement plans. Although data 
limitations inhibit the Department from 
estimating the impact of this 
clarification, the Department expects 
that very few workers or employers will 
be impacted by this clarification. 
Clarifying the Definition of ‘‘Eligible 
Employee’’ (§ 825.110) 

Current § 825.110 sets forth the 

eligibility standards employees must 
meet in order to take FMLA leave. 
Specifically, current § 825.110(a) 
restates the statutory requirement that to 
be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee 
must have been employed by an 
employer for 12 months, been employed 
for 1,250 hours in the 12 months 
preceding the leave, and be employed 
by an employer with 50 or more 
employees within 75 miles of the 
worksite. Current § 825.110(b) provides 
detail on the requirement that the 
employee must have been employed by 
the employer for at least 12 months, 
stating that the 12 months need not be 
consecutive. 

The Department is proposing a new 

§ 825.110(b)(1) to provide that although 
the 12 months of employment need not 
be consecutive, employment prior to a 
continuous break in service of five years 
or more need not be counted. The 
Department expects that very few 
workers will be impacted by this 
clarification.33 

33 In order to be impacted by the proposed 

provision a worker would have to (1) be employed 
for at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12 
months, (2) have a break in employment with that

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

The Determination of Whether 50 
Employees Are Employed Within 75 
Miles (§ 825.111) 

Current § 825.111 sets forth the 

standards for determining whether an 
employer employs 50 employees within 
75 miles for purposes of employee 
eligibility. Paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section provides that when an employee 
is jointly employed by two or more 
employers, the employee’s worksite is 
the primary employer’s office from 
which the employee is assigned or 
reports. The Department is proposing to 
modify § 825.111(a)(3) to state that after 
an employee who is jointly employed is 
stationed at a fixed worksite for a period 
of at least one year, the employee’s 
worksite for purposes of employee 
eligibility is the actual physical place 
where the employee works. No changes 
are being proposed with respect to 
employees whose worksite has not been 
fixed for at least one year. 

The Department expects that this 

clarification will have little net impact. 
Some employees currently covered by 
FMLA may not be covered if their 
official worksite is changed because 
they have worked more than one year at 
an establishment which has less than 50 
employees within 75 miles, while other 
employees not currently covered may 
become covered if their worksite is 
changed to an establishment which has 
50 or more employees within 75 miles. 
Clarifying the Definitions of 
‘‘Continuing Treatment’’ and ‘‘Periodic 
Visit’’ (§ 825.113, § 825.114 and 
§ 825.115) 

The current regulations 

(§ 825.114(a)(2)(i)(A)) define 
‘‘continuing treatment’’ for purposes of 
establishing a serious health condition 
as a period of incapacity of more than 
three consecutive calendar days and 
treatment two or more times by a health 
care provider. However, the current 
‘‘two visit’’ requirement for serious 
health conditions is open-ended. One of 

from the earlier period of employment with the 
same employer to meet the 12 months of 
employment requirement for FMLA eligibility. Very 
few workers are likely to meet these three 
conditions. For example, part-time employees 
would have to work an average of 25 hours per 
week for 50 weeks to meet the 1,250 hours 
employed requirement. So the only ones impacted 
are those who want to use FMLA leave and who 
need a few additional weeks of employment from 
their previous period of employment more than 5 
years ago with the same employer. Similarly, 
returning full-time employees will need more than 
7 months of employment at 40 hours per week to 
meet the 1,250 hours employed requirement. So the 
only ones impacted are those who want to use 
FMLA leave and who need a few extra months of 
employment from their previous period of 
employment more than 5 years ago with the same 
employer.

the proposed clarifications specifies that 
the two visits to a health care provider 
must take place within a 30 calendar- 
day period to meet the definition. 

Similarly, a chronic serious health 

condition is currently defined in 
§ 825.114(a)(2)(iii) as one that requires 
periodic visits for treatment, but the 
regulations do not define the term 
‘‘periodic visit.’’ In the proposal, 
‘‘periodic visit’’ is defined as visiting a 
physician twice or more per year for the 
same condition. This is based on an 
expectation that employees with 
chronic serious health conditions will 
generally visit their health care 
providers with a minimum frequency of 
semi-annually. 

Although the proposed clarification 

will reduce uncertainty in the 
workplace, it is unlikely to have any 
identifiable impact on FMLA leave- 
takers for several reasons. First, of the 
five different definitions of continuing 
treatment contained in current 
§ 825.114(a)(2)(i) through (v), the 
Department is proposing to update only 
two. Those workers who meet the other 
tests will not be affected (i.e., the 
clarifications do not impact workers 
who take FMLA leave for a pregnancy 
or prenatal care; workers who use leave 
for a condition that is permanent or 
long-term for which treatment may not 
be effective; or workers who use leave 
for multiple treatments, such as for a 
condition that would likely result in 
more than three consecutive days of 
incapacity in the absence of treatment. 
The proposed changes also do not affect 
employees who take FMLA leave for 
serious health conditions that required 
an overnight hospital stay or workers 
who will qualify on the basis of one 
visit to a health care professional and a 
continuing regimen of treatment. 
Second, serious health conditions 
usually require two visits to a health 
care provider within 30 days, and 
workers with chronic serious health 
conditions typically visit their health 
care providers twice a year. Finally, the 
Department has also proposed an 
‘‘extenuating circumstances’’ exception 
to the 30-day rule in § 825.115(a)(1), so 
it is likely that very few workers will be 
negatively impacted by the proposed 
changes. 

In fact, the Department believes it is 

providing FMLA protection to more 
workers by clarifying that the period 
should be 30 days, instead of adopting 
the stricter regulatory interpretation 
offered by the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (see 
discussion in preamble). Further, to the 
extent that some employers have chosen 
to provide their own more stringent 
definition of the term ‘‘periodic’’ for 

FMLA purposes, clarifying the term 
‘‘periodic’’ for chronic conditions to 
mean two or more visits per year will 
reduce uncertainty in the workplace and 
decrease the burden for some workers. 

The following analysis illustrates how 

few workers and leaves this may 
involve. According to both the Westat 
and WorldatWork surveys, leaves based 
on multiple visits to a health care 
provider (as distinct from leaves for self- 
treatment) represent only a small 
percentage of FMLA leaves. In fact, the 
WorldatWork survey states that multiple 
treatments were the basis of only 5.1 
percent of FMLA episodes.34 However, 
it is very unlikely that the proposed 
changes will impact even this small 
percentage of leaves because: (1) The 
multiple treatments that most workers 
currently have will likely meet the 
revised requirements with no change in 
the behavior of those workers; and (2) 
other workers will simply move up the 
time of their second treatments to meet 
the revised requirements (e.g., the 30 
day period), or provide an explanation 
of the ‘‘extenuating circumstances.’’ 
Therefore, it is likely that on balance 
very few workers will be impacted by 
the proposed changes.35 The 
Department specifically requests 
comment on this conclusion. 
Substitution of Paid Leave (§ 825.207) 

In the RFI the Department noted 

‘‘Some employers commented that the 
substitution of leave provisions 
contribute to increased FMLA leave at 
otherwise popular vacation or personal 
leave times.’’ Moreover, this increased 
use of FMLA leave resulted in some 
workers receiving more favorable 
treatment than others. ‘‘Many employers 
commented that the regulations force 
employers to treat employees seeking to 
use accrued paid leave concurrently 
with FMLA leave more favorably than 
those who use their accrued paid leave 
for other reasons. The Madison Gas and 
Electric Company, for example, stated 
that ‘‘during ‘peak’ or ‘high demand’ 
vacation periods, employees may 
request FMLA leave causing the 
employer to deny other employees their 
scheduled leaves due to staffing level 
concerns based on business needs.’’ (72 
FR at 35612) The proposed revision will 
address both of these concerns by 
combining current paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of § 825.207 into one paragraph 
(a), which now clearly states that the 

34 WorldatWork, FMLA Perspectives and 

Practices: Survey of WorldatWork Members, April 
2005, Figure 9a, p. 8. 

35 The Department anticipates that at most 27,000 

leaves may require an additional visit to a 
healthcare professional to qualify for FMLA 
protection.

terms and conditions of an employer’s 
paid leave policies apply and must be 
followed by the employee in order to 
substitute any form of accrued paid 
leave—including, for example, paid 
vacation, personal leave, family leave, 
‘‘paid time off’’ (PTO), or sick leave. In 
addition, the proposed revision will 
help reduce the impact of unforeseeable 
intermittent leave and uncertainty in the 
workplace by providing employers with 
sufficient notice of their employees’ 
need for leave and thereby allowing for 
better staffing adjustments. 

Proposed § 825.207 requires FMLA 

leave-takers who are also receiving paid 
leave to meet their employer’s 
uniformly-applied paid leave policies 
for accrued paid vacation and personal 
leave. If an employee does not comply 
with the requirements in an employer’s 
paid leave policy, the employee is not 
entitled to substitute accrued paid 
vacation and personal leave, but 
remains entitled to all the protections of 
unpaid FMLA leave. 

According to Westat, 65.8 percent of 
workers who take FMLA leave received 
some type of pay during their longest 
FMLA leave.36 Further, CONSAD 
estimated that 55.0 percent of these 
leave-takers received paid vacation or 
personal leave.37 Therefore, about 2.5 
million workers (i.e., 7.0 million × 
65.8% × 55%) received paid vacation or 
personal leave during their FMLA leave. 
However, the proposal will not impact 
all of these workers because many of 
them will continue to be eligible to use 
paid vacation pursuant to their 
employers’ normal vacation leave 
policies. 

Most employers do not have very 

strict requirements regarding paid leave. 
According to the 2000 Westat Report, 
77.8 percent of leave-takers reported 
that it was easy to get their employer to 
let them take time off. This suggests that 
the vast majority of workers will have 
no problem complying with their 
employers’ paid leave policies. On the 
other hand, 14 percent reported that it 
was difficult to get time off.38 This 
suggests that a similarly small 
percentage of the 2.5 million workers 
who received paid vacation or personal 
leave during their FMLA leave may 
have some difficulty satisfying their 
employers’ paid leave policies. 

Some of these FMLA leave-takers will 

be encouraged to provide their

36 See the 2000 Westat Report, Table 4.2, p. 4–5. 
37 The 2000 Westat Report indicated that of leave- 
takers who received paid leave during their longest 
FMLA leave, 39.4% received paid vacation leave 
and 25.7% received paid personal leave (Table 4.6, 
p. 4–6). Using probabilities, 55.0% = 39.4% + 
25.7%—(39.4% × 25.7%). 

38 See 2000 Westat Report, Table 4.2, p. 4–3. 

employers with additional notice of a 
pending absence so they can utilize paid 
vacation and personal leave in 
conjunction with their FMLA leave. 
Other FMLA leave-takers will not be 
able to satisfy their employer’s 
procedures for taking paid leave (e.g., 
because the procedures require that 
leave be taken at specific times of the 
year or in minimum blocks of time such 
as a week). However, workers who do 
not or cannot satisfy their employer’s 
procedures for taking paid leave will 
still remain entitled to all the 
protections of unpaid FMLA leave. 

The inability to take paid vacation 
leave concurrently with FMLA leave 
may have a negative impact on the cash 
flow of those few who do not satisfy 
their employer’s requirements for taking 
paid leave, and the Department 
understands that many commenters 
responding to the RFI emphasized the 
importance of the ability to substitute 
paid leave. However, for the few 
workers who will no longer be able to 
substitute paid vacation in all 
situations, these workers will still be 
entitled to use their accrued paid leave 
at some other time. 
Perfect Attendance Awards 
(§ 825.215(c)(2)) 

The Department is proposing to 

replace the existing language in 
§ 825.215(c)(2) with language that better 
reflects the requirements of the statute 
and reduces uncertainty in the 
workplace. Specifically, employers are 
uncertain whether their employee 
incentive plans are in violation of the 
current regulation. The confusion stems 
from language which distinguishes 
between bonuses for job performance 
such as those based on production 
goals, and bonuses that contemplate the 
absence of occurrences, such as bonuses 
for working safely with no accidents or 
for perfect attendance. 

Perfect attendance incentives are 
traditionally offered by employers 
where the costs of absent employees 
(i.e., the cost of the production delay 
itself or the cost of overstaffing or 
overtime to avoid the delay) are high. 
Employers would offer the bonuses to 
motivate workers not to be absent, 
thereby avoiding costs that are far in 
excess of the bonus.39 In such 
situations, both employers and 
employees gain from the bonus. 
Employers reduce their costs. 
Employees increase their income. 

Comments made in response to the 

RFI indicate that the current FMLA 

39 A rational employer would balance the perfect 

attendance award cost with the cost of employee 
absence, and not offer such bonuses where the cost 
of an absence is relatively low. 

regulations interfere with the 
effectiveness of perfect attendance 
bonuses because employees could still 
qualify for the bonus while absent on 
FMLA leave. As a result, the benefits of 
the bonuses to employers are 
diminished because employers still 
incur the costs related to absenteeism in 
addition to the cost of the bonuses, 
which means that fewer employers may 
offer these awards, ultimately hurting 
employees as well. 

The Department believes that this 

revision will restore perfect attendance 
awards to their intended purpose. By 
reducing the uncertainty surrounding 
employee incentive plans, this revision 
may encourage more employers to 
provide larger bonuses as incentives to 
reduce absenteeism among all workers. 
Based upon the comments to the RFI, 
the Department expects that some 
reduction in unnecessary absenteeism 
will reduce overall employer costs. 
However, data limitations inhibit the 
Department from quantifying the impact 
of this revision. 
The Treatment of Light Duty 
(§ 825.220(d)) 

The Department is proposing to delete 

the final sentence of current 
§ 825.220(d) to ensure that employees 
retain their right to reinstatement for a 
full 12 weeks of leave instead of having 
the right diminished by the amount of 
time spent in a light duty position. 

Under FMLA employees have no right 

to a light duty position. Therefore, 
employers will only offer such duty to 
employees when it is advantageous for 
them to do so. This will continue to be 
the case under the revised provision. 
Although the Department believes that 
this change will have a negligible 
impact on employers, a few workers 
whose employers are counting their 
light duty hours towards their 12 weeks 
of FMLA leave will now have more 
hours of leave available. The only 
impact that the Department anticipates 
is that some workers may not be offered 
light duty because their employers will 
not consider such duty cost-effective if 
the time is not counted against the 
worker’s FMLA allotment, either for 
purposes of restoration rights or length 
of leave. 
Changes to the Employer Notification 
Requirements (§ 825.300) 

Proposed § 825.300(a)(3) requires 

covered employers with eligible 
employees to distribute a general notice 
of information about the FMLA to 
employees either by including it in an 
employee handbook or by distributing a 
copy to each employee at least once a 
year, either in paper or electronic

out each year (i.e., 7.8 million—1 
million sent out under the current rule). 
The 2000 Westat Report suggests that 
32 percent of employees without FMLA 
information in a handbook will receive 
an annual notice via e-mail, 62 percent 
will receive a hand-delivered memo at 
work, and the remaining 6 percent will 
receive their annual notice via regular 
mail.42 Therefore, among the additional 
notices needed each year, 2.2 million 
(i.e., 32% of 6.8 million) will be e- 
mailed, 4.2 million will be hand- 
delivered at work, and 0.4 million 
notices will be sent by regular mail. 

Of the 1.135 million FMLA covered 

establishments, an estimated 92,000 
(8.1%) do not include FMLA 
information in an employee handbook 
and will be required to send annual 
notices to employees. For e-mail 
notices, the Department estimates that it 
will take on average one hour for a 
‘‘benefits and compensation’’ specialist 
to prepare a notice (or find a pre-made 
one from the Department of Labor’s Web 
site) and e-mail the notice to employees. 
For hand-delivered notices, the 
Department assumes that it will take on 
average 1.5 hours to prepare the notice 
and hand-deliver it through the 
interoffice mail. Finally, the Department 
estimates that it will take a similar 
specialist an average of two hours to 
prepare notices to be mailed by regular 
mail. This time includes preparing the 
notice, printing mailing labels, and 
putting the notices in envelopes. 

Based on data from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the average cost for 
wage and benefits of a ‘‘benefits and 
compensation specialist’’ is $36.51 per 
hour.43 So the estimated cost to prepare 
the 29,000 e-mail notices is about $1.1 
million (i.e., 92,000 establishments 
multiplied by 32%, times the cost of 
$36.51 per establishment) and the 
estimated cost for 57,000 firms to hand- 
deliver notices is about $3.4 million 
(i.e., 92,000 establishments multiplied 
by 62%, times the cost of $54.77 per 
establishment, plus the cost of copying 
the notice for 4.2 million workers at 8 
cents per copy). The estimated cost for 
5,500 firms to prepare and deliver the 
notice through regular mail is about $0.6 
million (i.e., 92,000 establishments 
multiplied by 6%, times the cost of 
$73.02 per establishment, plus the cost 
of mailing a notice via regular mail 

format, regardless of whether an 
employee requests leave. 

Current § 825.301(a)(1) requires an 

employer to place in an employee 
handbook, if one exists, a notice of 
FMLA rights and responsibilities and 
the employer’s policies on FMLA. 
Current § 825.301(a)(2) states that an 
employer without a handbook must 
provide written guidance to an 
employee concerning all the employee’s 
rights and obligations under FMLA 
when the employee gives specific notice 
of the need for leave. 

The difference between the proposed 
and current provisions, therefore, is that 
under the proposal all employees 
working in covered establishments 
without handbooks must be notified 
annually rather than just when they ask 
for leave that could be FMLA leave. The 
proposed change will likely increase 
notification costs for some covered 
employers (i.e., those without 
handbooks), and will likely increase 
awareness of the Act and therefore 
FMLA usage. 

CONSAD estimated the number of 

additional notices that may be required 
for this provision, based upon data from 
the 2000 Westat Report. The 2000 
Westat Report indicates that 18.9 
percent of employees request FMLA 
leave annually. CONSAD added 1 
percent to this estimate to account for 
the growth in awareness of the FMLA 
from 1999 to 2005, and then the 19.9 
percent was multiplied by 2⁄3 to account 
for the fact that the Westat survey 
covered 18 months instead of 12 
months. Thus, CONSAD estimated that 
about 12.7 million covered employees 
request leave each year (i.e., 13.3% of 
the 95.8 million FMLA covered 
employees).40 Data from Westat also 
indicate that 8.1 percent of covered 
employees did not receive information 
regarding their FMLA rights in 
handbooks.41 Therefore, employers 
currently send out about 1 million 
general notices to employees requesting 
leave (i.e., 12.7 million × 8.1%). 

Under the new provision, all FMLA- 

covered employees must receive an 
FMLA general notice at least annually, 
regardless of whether they request leave, 
if the information is not in an employee 
handbook. Therefore, employers will 
have to send annual notices to about 7.8 
million workers (i.e., 8.1% of the 95.8 
million covered employees), and the net 
impact of the proposal will be 6.8 
million additional general notices sent 

40 Although 12.7 million workers requested leave, 

only 7.0 million were eligible and took leave.

A–2–50.

(about 49 cents) times the 0.4 million 
additional annual notices sent via mail). 

Adding all of these costs together 

yields a total estimated annual 
additional cost of about $5.1 million for 
the general notice proposal.44 

After receiving these general notices 

on an annual basis some employees who 
previously did not take FMLA leave, 
may choose to do so because they 
acquire additional information from the 
notice regarding the protections 
afforded by the FMLA. Data from Westat 
employee survey reveal that 2.7 percent, 
or 2.4 million, of covered and eligible 
employees needed leave for FMLA 
covered reasons, but did not take it, and 
that 8.6 percent, or 210,000, of covered 
and eligible leave-needers reported that 
they could have afforded to take the 
leave, but had never heard about the 
FMLA.45 The Department also estimates 
that 17.7 percent of covered and eligible 
leave-needers who reported they could 
afford to take leave, but had never heard 
about the FMLA, did not take the leave 
for fear of losing their jobs.46 Assuming 
these workers would now be more 
aware of their FMLA protections they 
would most likely take FMLA leave, the 
Department estimates that the number 
of FMLA leave-takers will increase by 
about 37,000 employees (i.e., 17.7% of 
210,000) because of the proposed 
general notice provision. 

The estimated administrative costs 

associated with these additional 
workers taking FMLA leave is based 
upon the estimate of 1.25 hours of a 
‘‘compensation and benefits specialist’’ 
to process the paperwork for each 
worker at a cost of $36.51 per hour. 
Thus, the administrative burden of 
37,000 additional workers taking FMLA 
leave will cost approximately $1.7 
million. 

Proposed § 825.300(b) consolidates 

the notice provisions contained in 
existing § 825.110(d) and § 825.301(b) 
into a paragraph entitled ‘‘eligibility 
notice.’’ Consistent with current 
§ 825.110, the employer continues to be 
responsible under proposed paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section for communicating 
eligibility status. The proposed 
regulations require that this information 
be conveyed within five business days 
after the employee requests leave or the 
employer acquires knowledge that the 
employee’s leave may be for an FMLA- 
qualifying reason (a change from the

the impact of this provision.

current requirement of two business 
days). 

Proposed § 825.300(b)(2) specifies 
what information an employer must 
convey when communicating with the 
employee as to eligibility status. While 
not required under the current 
regulations, the proposal requires the 
employer to notify the employee 
whether leave is still available in the 
applicable 12-month period. If the 
employee is not eligible or has no FMLA 
leave available, then, pursuant to 
proposed (b)(2), the notice must indicate 
the reasons why the employee is not 
eligible or that the employee has no 
FMLA leave available. In proposing 
these new notice requirements, the 
Department believes there will be very 
little additional burden, since the 
employer is already required to 
calculate such information in order to 
determine eligibility. Moreover, any 
additional reporting burden will likely 
be more than offset by the benefit of 
changing the notification requirement 
from two to five days. Providing more 
time will reduce mistakes and provide 
greater certainty in the workplace, and 
this typically benefits both workers and 
employers. 

Similarly, proposed § 825.300(c) 

outlines the proposed requirements of 
the designation notice an employer 
must provide to an employee, currently 
located in § 825.208(b). This proposed 
designation notice requires that an 
employer notify the employee within 
five business days (a change from the 
current requirement of two business 
days) that the leave is designated as 
FMLA leave once the employer has 
sufficient information to make such a 
determination. 

Proposed § 825.300(c)(3) explicitly 

permits an employer to provide an 
employee with both the eligibility and 
designation notice at the same time in 
cases where the employer has adequate 
information to designate leave as FMLA 
leave when an employee requests the 
leave. 

The Department estimates that the 
changes related to increasing the time 
permitted to provide the notices and the 
ability to combine the notices will save 
employers on average about 15 minutes 
of a ‘‘compensation and benefits 
specialist’’ time in processing each 
leave. At a cost of $36.51 per hour, 
saving 0.25 hours on each of the 
estimated 10.5 million leaves taken 
results in a savings of about $95.8 
million. However, these savings are 
offset by the cost of the new 
requirement that an employer notify the 
employee if the leave is not designated 
as FMLA leave due to insufficient 
information or a non-qualifying reason

and the cost of providing more 
information to employees in the 
designation notices (see below). 

Proposed § 825.300(c) requires that an 

employer notify the employee if the 
leave is not designated as FMLA leave. 
As was noted above, CONSAD 
estimated that 12.7 million covered 
employees request leave each year. 
Subtracting the estimated 10.5 million 
FMLA leaves from the number of 
requests for FMLA leave yields an 
estimated 2.2 million FMLA leave 
requests denied each year. Based upon 
an estimated 0.5 hours to process each 
of these requests at a cost of $36.51 per 
hour, the Department estimates that 
notifying the 2.2 million workers why 
their requests for FMLA has been 
denied will results in a cost to 
employers of about $40.2 million. 

Proposed § 825.300(c)(1) requires 

employers to inform their employees of 
the number of hours, days, or weeks, if 
possible, designated as FMLA leave. To 
estimate the impact of this change, the 
Department assumes it would take an 
additional 10 minutes of a 
‘‘compensation and benefits specialist’’ 
time to process each designation 
because of the new requirement to 
provide the amount of time that will be 
designated as FMLA leave.47 Based 
upon 10.5 million leaves, this will result 
in about $65.9 million in additional 
costs. 

Moreover, where the amount of future 

leave that will be needed by an 
employee is unknown, such as for 
workers with chronic conditions, 
proposed § 825.300(c)(1) requires that 
the notice of the amount of leave 
designated and counted be provided 
every 30 days, to the extent that the 
employee took leave for the condition in 
the prior 30-day period. Currently, the 
regulations do not specifically address 
the designation of the particular amount 
of unforeseen, intermittent leave used. 
Current § 825.208 requires an employer 
to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying 
leave, and current § 825.301(c) requires 
that the notice of an employee’s specific 
obligations must be provided no less 
often than once every six months, but 
they do not expressly address the 
number of days or hours of leave used. 
To estimate the impact of this change, 
the Department assumes that for 
workers with chronic conditions (either 
temporary or permanent) an additional 
10 notices 48 will have to be provided 
each year and that each notice will take 

47 This estimate is consistent with the data 

presented in WorldatWork, FMLA Perspectives and 
Practices: Survey of WorldatWork Members, April 
2005, Figure 6, p. 7. 

48 Currently up to 2 notices are required each 

year. 

about 10 minutes of a ‘‘compensation 
and benefits specialist’’ time to 
process.49 According to the 
WorldatWork survey, 28.6 percent of 
absences result from either chronic or 
permanent/long term conditions.50 
Assuming that this applies to leave 
takers, the Department estimates that 10 
additional designation notices will have 
to be sent to about 2 million workers 
(i.e., 28.6% of 7 million) taking FMLA 
for either chronic or permanent/long 
term conditions each year at a cost of 
$121.9 million (i.e., 2 million × 10 
notices × 0.167 hour × $36.51 per 
hour).51 The Department has not 
estimated the cost of alternative 
notification frequencies (e.g., every 60 
days, every three months, etc.) because 
the cost of this revision depends solely 
on the frequency of the designation 
notices.52 The Department, however, 
requests comment on its assumption 
that 10 additional designation notices 
would be required each year under the 
proposed language of § 825.300(c)(1) 
and whether some alternative frequency 
for employers to provide the designation 
notices is more appropriate than the 
proposed frequency of every 30 days. 

The net impact of all of the revisions 
discussed in this subsection, therefore, 
will be a net cost of about $139.0 
million. 
Changes Related to Employees Notifying 
Their Employers (§§ 825.302, .303 and 
.304) 

The current regulations require an 

employee to notify his or her employer 
of the need for leave and generally to 
schedule leave for planned medical 
treatments in a way that the absences do 
not unduly disrupt the employer’s 
business operations. These proposed 
revisions are intended to reduce the 
impact of unforeseeable intermittent 
leave and uncertainty in the workplace 
without negatively impacting leave- 
needers. 

49 This estimate is consistent with the data 

presented in WorldatWork, FMLA Perspectives and 
Practices: Survey of WorldatWork Members, April 
2005, Figure 6, p. 7. 

50 Id., Figure 9a, p. 8. 
51 This is an upper bound estimate because it is 
based upon the assumption that the workers will 
take some FMLA leave each month and that a 
designation notice will be required every month. 
Clearly, some workers with FMLA certifications for 
chronic health conditions do not take FMLA leave 
every month. Moreover, although the current 
regulations do not specifically address the 
designation of unforeseen intermittent leave, the 
RFI record suggests that many employers are 
already sending out designation notices for this 
type of FMLA leave to avoid any potential legal 
liability.

Notices Required—2 Current Notices) × $12.2 
million.

7950 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Under the Department’s proposal, an 
employee must provide notice as soon 
as practicable, meaning feasible under 
the circumstances, and must comply 
with the employer’s usual procedures 
for calling in and requesting leave, 
except when extraordinary 
circumstances exist such as when the 
employee or covered family member 
needs emergency medical treatment. 
The Department expects that in all but 
the most extraordinary circumstances, 
employees will be able to provide notice 
to their employers of the need for leave 
prior to the start of their shift. The 
proposed changes should reduce some 
of the uncertainty and disruptions 
caused by employees taking 
unforeseeable FMLA leave with little or 
no advance notice to their employers. 

As was noted in the RFI Report, 

unscheduled leave is more disruptive to 
employers than foreseeable leave. By its 
very definition, foreseeable FMLA leave 
can be anticipated and planned for as 
employees are aware of their need in 
advance and can easily notify their 
employers prior to taking FMLA leave. 
Even in cases where the exact timing of 
the leave is not known 30 days in 
advance, the Department believes that 
most employees taking foreseeable 
FMLA will easily be able to comply 
with their employers’ leave policies (see 
discussion in preamble). On the other 
hand, by its very nature, unforeseeable 
leave presents difficulties for both 
employees and their employers, 
particularly as to the requirement that 
the employee provide notice of the need 
for leave as soon as practicable. 

According to a 2007 survey conducted 

by the Society for Human Resource 
Management (SHRM), 34 percent of 
FMLA leave takers for episodic 
conditions did not provide notice before 
the day the leave was taken and 12 
percent provided notice more than one 
day after the leave was taken.53 
Therefore, according to SHRM’s survey 
about 46 percent of employees are not 
providing notice prior to the start of 
their workday. This estimate is 
consistent with the findings of the 
Employment Policy Foundation, which 
found that 41 percent of employees are 
not providing notice prior to the start of 
their workday or shift.54 Thus, the 

Department estimates that no notice is 
currently being provided prior to the 
start of the workday for 4.8 million 
leaves (i.e., 46% of 10.5 million leaves). 

It is this late notification that results 

in greatest uncertainty and disruption to 
employers’ business operations. For 
example, it creates significant problems 
if the employer cannot obtain adequate 
staffing; 55 the production process is 
often slowed down or brought to a 
halt; 56 and the situation is particularly 
ominous when the employee works in a 
safety-sensitive position, such as 911 
operators.57 Moreover, workplace 
uncertainty can impact other employees 
who may have to pull double-duty to 
cover for a team member or co-worker.58 
There are three anticipated behavioral 
responses that leave-takers will have to 
the proposed provisions. First, most 
leave-takers will simply change their 
notification behavior and notify their 
employers of leaves prior to the start of 
their workday. This change will mean 
that although the leaves are taken, staff 
uncertainty will be reduced and 
employers will have more time to obtain 
a replacement and be in a better 
position to meet staffing needs despite 
the unexpected absence. The 
Department expects that 95 percent or 
4.6 million of the 4.8 million leaves 
where employees are currently not 
providing notification until the start of 
the workday will be in this category. 

Better control of the unforeseen 

absences will reduce the disruptions 
associated with the labor absence. The 
Westat Survey and comments made in 
response to the RFI suggest that the 
most likely response of employers to an 
unforeseen absence of short duration is 
to simply assign the absent employee’s 
work to other employees. However, the 
comments to the RFI also indicate that 
it may take employers some time to 
arrange for coverage, especially in cases 
where the notification of the FMLA 
comes in after the start of the shift. For 
this proposed rule, therefore, DOL has 
used one hour of the average earnings of 
production and nonsupervisory workers 
on private nonfarm payrolls ($17.57) 59 
plus 40 percent for benefits as a proxy 
for the cost of an absence without 
sufficient notification. This savings is

not a productivity savings in the 
traditional sense because there is no 
output and no time involved. Rather, 
the Department is using one hour of 
employees’ compensation 60 as a rough 
estimate of the costs related to the 
uncertainty and disruptions caused by 
unscheduled intermittent FMLA leave 
(e.g., work being left undone until the 
absent employee’s work can be shifted 
to another employee or until another 
employee can cover for the absent 
employee). Further, this estimate is 
limited to the typical impact. If the 
absence of an employee affects the 
productivity of other employees besides 
the one reassigned the task (i.e., in 
highly time-sensitive production 
processes such as manufacturing), this 
may be an underestimate of the effects 
of this provision.61 Thus, the 
Department estimates that more timely 
notifications by employees will result in 
a savings of about $113.2 million to 
employers. The Department specifically 
request comments on the analysis used 
to develop this estimate. 

The second possible response to this 

change is that some workers who 
continue to avoid compliance with their 
employer’s attendance policies may be 
subject to their employer’s disciplinary 
procedures for being absent. No workers 
with a legitimate need for FMLA leave 
will be in this group or decide not to 
take the leave in response to a last- 
minute emergency because: (1) The 
revisions provide for ‘‘extraordinary 
circumstances’’ (see below); and (2) an 
employee is likely to take leave 
regardless of the interpretation of ‘‘as 
soon as practicable’’ during a serious 
health situation.62 

The Department expects that 4.9 

percent or 235,000 of the 4.8 million 
leaves where employees are currently 
not providing notification until the start 
of the workday will be in this category. 
The Department estimates that each of 
the leaves not covered by FMLA will 
save employers’ administration and 

60 The wage plus benefits represents the marginal 

cost of the absent employee. In a perfectly 
competitive market, this would be equal to the 
marginal revenue brought in by that employee. 
Therefore, one hour of compensation is used as a 
proxy for the opportunity cost of having the worker 
missing for an hour. 

61 See the later discussion on the possible impacts 

on highly time-sensitive industries. 

62 The Department received a number of 

comments in response to the RFI that suggest some 
employees may be misusing FMLA leave to avoid 
their employers’ attendance policies (see Chapter 
IV, Section B.2, of the RFI Report, 72 FR at 35571). 
However, as noted in the RFI Report, the 
Department cannot assess from the record how 
much leave taking is actual ‘‘abuse’’ and how much 
is legitimate, and therefore cannot estimate what 
impact this proposal would have on the alleged 
misuse of FMLA leave.

reduced operational costs equal to an 
average of about 1 hour of a 
‘‘compensation and benefits 
specialist’s’’ time. At a cost of $36.51 
per hour, this will result in a savings of 
about $8.6 million. 

The third possible response is that 

some leave-takers will have 
‘‘extraordinary circumstances’’ with a 
serious health condition and take leave 
without providing advance notice. 
However, the number of leaves for 
which advance notice cannot be given 
will likely be very small, on the order 
of 0.1 percent of the 4.8 million leaves 
or 48,000. The uncertainty, disruptions, 
and costs associated with this type of 
unscheduled leave for both employers 
and employees are inevitable, 
unavoidable, and will likely continue, 
but the incremental impacts of this 
continued type of leave, relative to the 
current rule, is minimal. 

The net impact of all of the revisions 
discussed in this subsection, therefore, 
will be a net savings of about $121.8 
million. 
Medical Certifications (§§ 825.305, 
825.306 and 825.307) 

Current § 825.305(c) provides that an 

employer should request medical 
certification from the employee within 
two business days of receiving the 
employee notice of the need for leave. 
The Department is proposing to modify 
this time-frame to a five-business-day 
standard. This change is being proposed 
to maintain consistency with the 
modifications being proposed to 
§ 825.300. Providing more time will 
reduce mistakes and provide greater 
certainty in the workplace, and this 
typically benefits both workers and 
employers. 

The Department is also proposing in 

§ 825.305(c) that when an employer 
determines that a medical certification 
is incomplete or insufficient, the 
employer must state in writing what 
additional information is necessary and 
provide the employee with seven 
calendar days to cure the deficiency 
(additional time must be allowed where 
the employee is unable to obtain the 
additional information despite diligent 
good faith efforts). Under the current 
rule no written statement from the 
employer is necessary. 

In § 825.306 the Department is 
proposing several revisions to the 
medical certification form, to implement 
the statutory requirements for 
‘‘sufficiency’’ of the medical 
certification as set forth in 29 U.S.C. 
2613(b) and to make it easier for health 
care providers to understand and 
complete. The Department has revised 
its optional form (Form WH–380) for

employees or their family members to 
use in obtaining medical certifications 
and second and third opinions from a 
health care provider. 

There are three proposed changes to 

§ 825.307. First, the proposed provision 
clarifies the limited nature of the 
authentication process and removes the 
requirement that employees consent to 
authentication of the certification. 
Second, the proposal allows employers 
to contact the employee’s health care 
provider directly, rather than through a 
third-party health care provider that 
represents the employer, provided the 
contact between the provider and the 
employer comply with the privacy rule 
under the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Third, 
the new provision extends the time 
allowed for an employer to provide the 
results of second and third opinions of 
medical certifications from two business 
days to five. 

According to the 2000 Westat Report, 

73.6 percent of leave-takers took leave 
for a serious health condition (either 
their own or for a covered family 
member),63 and 92 percent of covered 
establishments required medical 
documentation for covered leave due to 
a serious health condition.64 The 
Department estimates that these 
provisions will affect about 7.1 million 
FMLA leaves taken for serious health 
conditions (i.e., 7.0 million leave-takers 
× 73.6% × 1.5 leaves × 92% = 7.1 
million). The Department also estimates 
that these changes, as well as the 
changes discussed above, will result in 
a net savings to employers of on average 
about 15 minutes of a ‘‘compensation 
and benefits specialist’’ time in 
processing each leave request.65 At a 
cost of $36.51 per hour, saving 0.25 
hours on each of the estimated 7.1 
million leaves taken results in a savings 
of about $64.8 million for employers. 

In response to the RFI, some 

employee groups stated that it was often 
very challenging for workers to obtain 
certifications because the ambiguities on 
the form made it difficult for their 
health care providers to address 
deficiencies noted by their employers. 

63 The 2000 Westat Report, Table 2.3, p. 2–5. 
64 The 2000 Westat Report, Table A2–6.3, p. A– 

2–51. 

65 The net savings of 15 minutes includes: 1) the 
savings associated with extending the time allowed 
to ‘‘process’’ medical certifications from two to five 
days (providing more time will reduce the number 
of mistakes involved in the medical certification 
process and time required to address and correct 
those mistakes); plus 2) the time saved by allowing 
employers to contact the employee’s health care 
provider directly; less 3) the additional time and 
cost that employers will have to take to provide a 
written explanation of why a medical certification 
is incomplete or insufficient. 

The proposed revisions will make it 
easier for employees to understand what 
is required and will reduce uncertainty 
as to whether the condition qualifies as 
a serious health condition under the 
FMLA. In addition, the Department 
expects that employees will have to 
make fewer trips and phone calls to 
their health care providers to obtain 
‘‘complete and sufficient’’ certifications, 
although the Department has not 
quantified this impact. 

In response to the RFI, some health 

care providers expressed their 
frustration with the current form and 
the amount of time required to provide 
their patients with ‘‘complete and 
sufficient’’ certifications. The 
Department expects that the proposed 
clarifications will decrease the burden 
on health care providers and possibly 
reverse the trend of increasing numbers 
of health care providers charging their 
patients for filling out the medical 
certification forms. 
Recertifications (§ 825.308) and 
Certifications for Fitness-for-Duty 
(§ 825.310) 

Consistent with Wage and Hour 

Opinion Letter FMLA2004–2–A (May 
25, 2004), the proposed change to 
§ 825.308(e) of the FMLA would allow 
employers to send the absence schedule 
of an employee to a health care provider 
and to ask the health care provider 
whether or not the employee’s pattern of 
intermittent leave use is congruent with 
the employee’s qualifying medical 
condition. Further, consistent with the 
existing regulation, proposed 
§ 825.308(b) explains that if a minimum 
duration for the leave is specified, the 
employer may not request recertification 
until that time period has expired but 
adds that, in all cases, recertifications 
may be requested every six months. 
Thus, the Department assumes that this 
clarification will not impact either 
employers or employees. The proposed 
change to § 825.308(e) will, however, 
provide employers with a tool to 
determine if the employee’s pattern of 
FMLA leave is consistent with their 
condition, or possible misuse. However, 
as noted in the RFI Report, the 
Department cannot assess from the 
record how much leave taking is actual 
‘‘abuse’’ and how much is legitimate, 
and therefore can not estimate what 
impact this proposal would have on the 
alleged misuse of FMLA leave.66 

66 The Department received a number of 

comments in response to the RFI that suggest some 
employees may be misusing FMLA leave. For 
example, a number of commenters stated that some 
employees appear to be misusing the FMLA rules 
to secure for themselves a preferred schedule (see

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Current § 825.310(c) states that a 

fitness-for-duty certification need only 
be a simple statement of the employee’s 
ability to return to work. The proposed 
provision allows a fitness-for-duty 
certification similar to that of the initial 
medical certification of the FMLA leave. 
The Department is also proposing in 
§ 825.310(g) that an employer be 
permitted to require an employee to 
furnish a fitness-for-duty certificate 
every 30 days if an employee has used 
intermittent leave during that period 
and reasonable safety concerns exist. 
For example, if a bus driver takes 
intermittent leave for a serious health 
condition that may influence his or her 
ability to drive safely over the road, then 
a fitness-for-duty certification is 
permitted. Finally, the Department is 
proposing in § 825.310(c) that, 
consistent with the HIPAA Privacy 
Rule, employers may contact an 
employee’s health care provider 
directly, rather than through a third- 
party health care provider which 
represents the employer, for purposes of 
clarifying and authenticating the fitness- 
for-duty certification. 

These proposed changes have several 

important impacts. First, they would 
better protect the safety and health of 
workers taking leave, and their 
coworkers. Second, § 825.310(c) will 
reduce administrative burdens. Third, 
the proposed change to § 825.308(e) will 
reduce uncertainty in the workplace by 
permitting an employer to determine if 
an employee’s pattern of leave is 
consistent with the serious health 
condition.67 

The additional information needed for 

a fitness-for-duty certification is likely 
to result in additional costs. The 2000 
Westat Report found that 52.4 percent of 
workers took leave for their own serious 
health condition;68 and the Department 
assumes that 10 percent of these leave- 
takers, or 367,000 workers, are required 
to have a fitness-for-duty certification to 
return to work (i.e., 7.0 million workers 
× 52.4% × 10.0% = 367,000). Their 
health care providers will have to take 
an additional 10 minutes to provide the 
additional information on the proposed 

Chapter IV, Section B, of the RFI Report, 72 FR at 
35575). However, the RFI Report also noted that the 
increase in the use of unscheduled intermittent 
FMLA leave seen in the data submitted by some 
employers could be due to other factors, such as 
workers suffering from the adverse health effects 
associated with the stress of staffing shorthanded 
operations (see Chapter XI, Section L, of the RFI 
Report, Id. at 35635). 

67 A number of comments to the RFI questioned 

employee leave patterns. 

fitness-for-duty certification, and this 
additional time will cost an average of 
$51.06 per hour.69 Thus, health care 
providers are likely to incur about $4.7 
million in additional costs and these 
costs are likely to be shifted to 
employees in the form of higher fees for 
filling out the certifications.70 

Although employers will take longer 

to review these certifications, the 
Department assumes that these costs 
will be offset by the ability of employers 
to directly contact the workers’ health 
care providers. 

The proposal in § 825.310(g) to permit 

an employer to require an employee to 
furnish a fitness-for-duty certificate 
every 30 days if an employee has used 
intermittent leave during that period 
and reasonable safety concerns exist is 
likely to impact very few workers. The 
2000 Westat Report found that 52.4 
percent of workers took leave for their 
own serious health condition and 23.9 
percent of those workers took it 
intermittently.71 The Department 
assumes that 5 percent of these leave- 
takers, or 44,000 workers, will be 
required to have a fitness-for-duty 
certification where reasonable safety 
concerns exist 72 in order to return to 
work from intermittent leave (i.e., 7.0 
million workers taking FMLA leave × 
52.4% × 23.9% × 5.0% = 44,000).73 On 
average the Department assumes these 
44,000 workers will be required to 
provide three fitness-for-duty 
certifications for the intermittent leave 
they take, and obtaining each of these 
132,000 certifications will cost an 
average of $50.74 Thus, the revised 

69 Average cost of physicians’ assistants from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Compensation 
Survey, 2005. The average hourly wage was 
multiplied by 1.4 to account for benefits. 

70 Comments to the RFI indicate that many health 

care providers are now charging fees for FMLA 
certifications. It should be noted that the 
Department expects the majority of these fees will 
be paid by workers’ health insurance. According to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2007 National 
Compensation Survey, unpublished data, 90 
percent of establishments with 50 or more 
employees offer health care benefits, and 81 percent 
of workers in those establishments have access to 
those health care benefits. Further, employers with 
50 or more employees paid for 81 percent of health 
insurance premiums for single coverage, and 73 
percent for family coverage. 

71 The 2000 Westat Report, Table 2.3, p. 2–5; and 

those that answered yes to Question A5B of 
Westat’s employee Questionnaire. 

72 See the preamble for a discussion and examples 

of the term ‘‘reasonable safety concerns.’’ 

73 The Department assumed a lower rate here 

because of the additional ‘‘reasonable safety 
concern’’ requirement on employer’s ability to 
require a fitness-for-duty certification for 
intermittent leave. 

68 The 2000 Westat Report, Table 2.3, p. 2–5. The 

establishment survey also found that 37.8 percent 
of FMLA leave-takers took leave for their own 
serious health condition; Table 3.8, p. 3–16. 

74 The Department assumes that workers with 

chronic conditions are under doctors’ care so that 
for most workers the added cost of the certifications 
will only be the charge for the doctor to fill out the

provision will likely cost workers about 
$6.6 million per year.75 

To estimate the impact of these 

additional certifications on employers, 
the Department assumed that it would 
take an additional 30 minutes of a 
‘‘compensation and benefits 
specialist’s’’ time at a cost of $36.51 per 
hour to request and process each 
certification. Based upon 132,000 
fitness-for-duty certifications, this will 
result in about $2.4 million in 
additional costs for employers. 

Although the net impact of the 

revisions discussed in this subsection 
will be a net cost of about $2.4 million 
for employers and $11.3 million for 
employees, the proposed revisions to 
§ 825.310(g) will increase workplace 
safety by making sure that workers are 
healthy enough to return to work and do 
not pose a safety risk to themselves and 
others. However, data limitations inhibit 
the Department from estimating the 
number of workers who may be 
impacted by this proposal, or 
quantifying the resulting safety benefit. 
Summary of Impacts 

The Department estimates that the 

proposed revisions will result in a total 
first year net costs of about $26.1 
million, and a net savings of about $33.9 
million, each year thereafter (and this 
does not include the additional savings 
expected in the time-sensitive high- 
impact industries that are discussed in 
the next section). 

For employers, the most significant 

costs will be the first year cost of 
reviewing and implementing the 
proposed revisions and the cost of 
providing employees with additional 
and more specific notifications. After 
the first year, however, these costs will 
be more than offset by the reduction in 
administrative costs and increased 
productivity resulting from employees 
providing better notice of their need for 
FMLA leave (see previous discussion of 
§§ 825.302, 825.303 and 825.304). 

Although the vast majority of FMLA 
leave-takers will see no difference, the 
Department estimates that employees 
will incur $11.3 million in additional 
expenses related to taking FMLA leave, 
primarily as the result of the increased 
number of certifications that they will 
have to provide their employers. 
However, since these costs are primarily 
related to health care, a large portion is 
likely to be paid by the employee’s 

forms, which will probably cost less than $50. 
Other workers will, of course, require medical 
examinations, which will probably cost more than 
$50. 

75 It should be noted that the Department expects 
the majority of these costs will be paid by workers’ 
health insurance. See footnote 70.

Although these impacts are 

substantial, the Department has 
determined that they do not account for 
all of the impacts that can be reasonably 
anticipated from the proposed revisions. 
The Department expects that the impact 
that the revisions will have in the highly 
time-sensitive operations will add to the 
benefits. Analyses of these impacts are 
presented below, however, because of 
data limitations the Department has not 
attempted to quantify these benefits. 
Impact of the Revisions on Highly Time- 
Sensitive Operations 

Comments in response to the RFI 

indicate that firms in industries with 
time-sensitive operations incur greater 
costs than the typical establishments. 
These vulnerable industries include 
manufacturing, health care, 
transportation, public safety, and 
communications. For example, 
unexpectedly absent employees in these 
industries can disrupt assembly lines for 
manufacturing, delay the take-off of 
commercial airliners, and jeopardize 
adequate staffing in public safety 
positions.77 This section discusses the 
impacts the proposed revisions will 
have on highly time-sensitive 
operations. 

Untimely notification of an absence of 

a high-impact employee can have a 
more costly effect in highly time- 
sensitive industries than others. 
Examples provided in response to the 
RFI indicate that if an employer is 

provided when police officers, 
emergency dispatch workers, fire 
fighters, and paramedic shifts are not 
fully covered because of inadequate 
notice. 

The conventional economic 

unable to plan for the absence of a high- 
impact employee in one of these 
industries because of late notification, 
the following disruptive events can 
occur: 

• Manufacturing assembly lines may 
be interrupted if there is not a stand-by 
employee to take the absent employee’s 
place. 

• Passengers are delayed and 

productivity losses increase if an airline 
pilot, flight attendant, bus driver, or 
train engineer does not show up for 
work at their expected time. 

• Adequate public safety may not be 

assumption is that the wage rate 
represents the value of the marginal 
product for the occupation and/or the 
industry. This was the reason in the 
previous sections that wage rates were 
used as a proxy of the cost of the 
disruption caused by the absence of a 
worker taking unscheduled FMLA 
leave. However, this assumption does 
not hold in highly time-sensitive 
operations because of the asymmetrical 
nature of their operations. 

Workers’ wages are primarily based 

upon their average output. Yet, in time- 
sensitive operations the absence of a 
single worker can sometimes result in 
disruptions that cost far in excess of the 

value of the worker’s average output or 
wage. For example, a worker’s absence 
may cause expensive equipment and 
other workers to be idled. In these 
situations, the worker’s average 
compensation or productivity cannot be 
used to estimate the total welfare cost of 
the absence. 

‘‘Data on the productivity impact of FMLA, 

while potentially probative, cannot by itself 
be used to estimate welfare effects accurately. 
While it is broadly true that reductions in 
productivity reduce economic welfare, the 
magnitude of the reduction depends on how 
the effect is distributed across inputs and 
industries. A regulation that reduces labor 
productivity, for example, will have a larger 
impact on economic welfare in industries 
where production requires ‘‘fixed 
proportions’’ of capital and labor (e.g., air 
transport, which requires at least one pilot 
and one co-pilot per airplane) than in 
industries where capital can easily be 
substituted for labor. Similarly, a reduction 
in total factor productivity in an industry 
producing products for which there are few 
economic substitutes will have a larger effect 
on economic welfare than one affecting an 
industry producing a product with many 
substitutes. In the latter case, consumers will 
simply shift their purchases away from the 
products of the less productive industry, 
suffering little or no loss in consumer 
surplus. For these and other reasons, 
economists do not generally attempt to 
measure the impact of policies on economic 
welfare effects by tracking their effects on 
productivity.’’ 78 

This situation is akin to the peak 

demand situation at an electric utility 

76 Bureau of Labor Statistics, National 

Compensation Survey, 2007, unpublished data. 

77 For example, New York City noted: ‘‘The 

situation is particularly ominous when the 
employee works in a safety-sensitive position, such 
as 911 operators, or other employees requiring face- 
to-face relief, because if the person’s shift is not able 
to be covered by a colleague who in some instances 
is required to work overtime, then the public may 

receive a slow response to an emergency call.’’ 
Fairfax County Public Schools provided the 
example of school bus drivers. ‘‘[T]he essence of a 
school bus driver’s job is to deliver children to 
school on time and safely. A few bus drivers have 
used chronic conditions such as CFS, depression, 
or sleep problems as an excuse not to report on time 
and not to call in when they will be late. They 
claim that their ‘condition’ precludes them from 
providing notice or from being on time. These 

behaviors mean that children are often left waiting 
on street corners in all weather for some other bus 
driver.’’ For a complete discussion, see Section K 
of Chapter XI of the Department’s Report on the RFI 
(72 FR at 35632).

company. Most customers are charged 
rates equal to the average cost of power 
generation. During periods of peak 
demand (when the marginal high-cost 
equipment is pressed into service and 
when the utility is sometimes forced to 
buy power to meet customer demands), 
the utility may take a loss on the sale 
of power. However, this loss is made up 
when demand drops so that the utility 
can generate the needed power at a 
much lower rate. This is why electric 
utilities offer customers variable rates 
tied to overall power demand. By 
charging higher rates during periods 
when power is more expensive to 
supply (so-called peak load pricing), 
this pricing structure motivates 
customers to cut back on their power 
use during periods of high or peak 
demand. 

The U.S. labor market is not perfectly 

competitive. For instance, some labor 
laws and regulations limit the flexibility 
of employers and employees to enter 
into some mutually agreeable 
arrangements. Moreover, most 
employers cannot use peak load pricing 
to vary the wages paid to their 
employees based upon the demand at 
that moment. 

[The] FMLA may inhibit the market’s 

ability to allocate labor efficiently among 
firms (and jobs among workers). Both firms 
and workers display heterogeneity with 
respect to values they place on absenteeism. 
In some industries, employee absenteeism 
will have a relatively small effect on firms’ 
overall ability to operate, and therefore entail 
a relatively modest financial impact. In other 
sectors, absenteeism hinders production 
substantially by, for example, diminishing 
the productivity of other workers and 
equipment. If the effect of worker absence on 
a company’s productivity is relatively 
modest, economists classify that firm as 
operating a so called linear production 
technology. Firms whose productivity is 
more sensitive to absenteeism are said to 
employ assembly line technologies. 
Companies relying on assembly line 
production techniques depend to a much 
greater extent on coordinated efforts of labor 
and machinery. Therefore, the absence of a 
single employee has a ripple effect 
throughout the organization.79 

The RFI record suggests that 

intermittent FMLA leave can have 
significant impacts on time-sensitive 
business models. For example, the 
United States Postal Service reported 
‘‘[i]n a time-sensitive environment 
* * * unscheduled leave presents 
significant operational challenges.’’ The 
United Parcel Service, Inc. stated 
‘‘employers typically can arrange 
coverage for an employee who might 
require intermittent leave to take his

employee who is certified for

[conditions] and who calls in with no 
advance notice * * * especially in 
time-sensitive/service-related 
industries.’’ 80 

In many situations, the absence of just 

a few employees can have a significant 
impact. For example, with respect to 
unscheduled intermittent leaves, some 
employers find they have to over staff 
on a continuing basis just to make sure 
they have sufficient coverage on any 
particular day (such as hourly positions 
in manufacturing, public transportation, 
customer service, health care, call 
centers, and other establishments that 
operate on a 24/7 basis). Some 
employers require their employees to 
work overtime to cover the absent 
employee’s work. Both of these options 
result in additional costs.81 

Unfortunately, without an accurate 
production function for each of these 
industries, it is not possible to 
quantitatively estimate the impact that 
the absence of these workers, including 
unforeseen absences, will have on the 
time-sensitive operations. However, to 
the extent the proposed rule reduces the 
cost of uncertainty in staffing, time- 
sensitive operations are likely to see 
larger productivity benefits than other 
industries. 
Appendix A: Potential Impact of Section 
585(a) of H.R. 4986, the National 
Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008 
Introduction 

As discussed in the preamble above, 

Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986, the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
FY 2008, amends the FMLA to provide 
leave to eligible employees of covered 
employers to care for covered 
servicemembers, or for any qualifying 
exigency arising out of the fact that a 
covered family member is on active 
duty or has been notified of an 
impending call to active duty status in 
support of a contingency operation. The 
provisions of H.R. 4986 providing 
FMLA leave to care for a covered 
servicemember became effective on 
January 28, 2008, when the law was 
enacted. The provisions of H.R. 4986 
providing for FMLA leave due to a 
qualifying exigency arising out of a 
covered family member’s active duty (or 
call to active duty) status are not 
effective until the Secretary of Labor 
issues regulations defining ‘‘qualifying 

80 See RFI Report, 72 FR at 35632. 
81 Id. 

exigencies.’’ Because a significant 
number of United States military are 
currently on active duty or call to active 
duty status, the Department is fully 
aware of the need to issue regulations 
under the military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 as soon as 
possible and is seeking public comment 
on any issues related to military family 
leave that may need to be addressed in 
final regulations. 

This appendix to the PRIA indentifies 

the potential number of covered and 
eligible workers who may be impacted 
by the military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986. Commenters are invited to 
submit any data relating to the 
economic impact of the military family 
leave provisions of H.R. 4986. 
Estimating such impacts is required 
under Executive Order 12866. 
Impact of Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986 on 
the Number of FMLA Covered 
Employers and Eligible Workers 

Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986 has no 

impact on the number of establishments 
covered by the FMLA, or on the number 
of workers eligible to take FMLA. 
Therefore, many of the estimates 
presented in the Chapter 1 of the PRIA 
(e.g., number of covered employers, 
covered establishments, workers 
employed at covered establishments and 
FMLA eligible workers) remain the 
same. 
Impact of Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986 on 
the Number of Workers Who May Take 
FMLA Leave 

Under the new military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986, workers who 
are eligible to take FMLA leave will be 
permitted to take protected leave under 
two new circumstances (i.e., to care for 
covered servicemembers, or for any 
qualifying exigency arising out of the 
fact that a covered family member is on 
active duty or has been notified of an 
impending call to active duty status in 
support of a contingency operation). 
Since both of these circumstances are 
related to family relationships with 
servicemembers, the first step in 
estimating the number of workers who 
may take FMLA Leave under the 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 was to develop a family profile of 
servicemembers. 

Using data from the Defense 

Manpower Data Center, the Current 
Population Survey (CPS), and the 
Decennial Census of Population, 
CONSAD developed a model to estimate 
the number of parents, spouses, and 
adult sons and daughters of

servicemembers.82 A summary of the 
methodology used by CONSAD to 
develop its estimates of the number of 
parents, spouses, and sons and 
daughters of servicemembers eligible to 
take FMLA leave is presented below. 
CONSAD estimated the number of 

parents by first computing, for CPS 
reference persons in a set of age ranges 
that are compatible with the age ranges 
of servicemembers in general, the 
numbers and proportions of married 
males living with spouses, married 
females living with spouses, married 
males living separately, married females 
living separately, separated males, 
separated females, divorced males, 
divorced females, widowed males, 
widowed females, never married males, 
and never married females reported in 
the CPS for each age range. 

Next, CONSAD made adjustments for 
the expected separate inclusion of both 
parents of the same child or children in 
two different categories (married living 
separately, separated, or divorced), for 
the expected remarriage of widowed or 
divorced parents, and for the expected 
death of both parents of some children. 
Then, CONSAD summed the adjusted 
estimates within each age range, to 
produce estimates of the proportion of 
people with parents in that age range 
who can be expected to have zero, one, 
or two living parents. For the estimate 
of the number of guardians and persons 
in loco parentis, CONSAD assumed that 
all servicemembers age 17 and 18 with 
no living parents would have one 
guardian or a person in loco parentis. 

CONSAD estimated the proportion of 
servicemembers with spouses using data 
from the Defense Manpower Data 
Center. 

CONSAD estimated the number of 

dependent adult children among 
servicemembers in different age ranges 
based upon data from the CPS.83 First, 
CONSAD estimated the number of 
dependent children among 
servicemembers in different age ranges. 
Then based on those estimates, 
CONSAD estimated the number of 
children 16 years of age and over with 
parents in the age range of the military 
servicemembers to produce 
distributions of the number of children 
16 years of age and over among 
servicemembers in each age range. 

To calculate employment rates for 

parents and spouses who might need to 
take military family leave, CONSAD 
used the employment rates for age 
ranges expected to be associated with 
the age range of the military 
servicemembers.84 CONSAD assumed 
that the employment rate of adult 
children who might need to take 
military family leave was 66 percent.85 
CONSAD also assumed that 60 percent 
of employed workers who might need to 
take military family leave would be 
FMLA covered and eligible.86 
Impact of Leave to Care for Covered 
Servicemembers With Serious Injuries 
or Illnesses 

Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986 amends 

the FMLA to permit an ‘‘an eligible 
employee who is the spouse, son, 
daughter, parent, or next of kin of a 

covered servicemember’’ to ‘‘a total of 
26 workweeks of leave during a 12- 
month period to care for the 
servicemember.’’ This provision will be 
codified in the FMLA at 29 U.S.C. 
2612(a)(3). 

According to the President’s 

Commission on Care for America’s 
Returning Wounded Warriors, 3,082 
servicemembers have been seriously 
injured since the beginning of hostilities 
in Iraq, or about 750 seriously injured 
servicemembers per year.87 Assuming 
that an equal number of servicemembers 
have been seriously injured during 
preparation or training for combat, the 
total annual number is about 1,500.88 
Further, preliminary estimates from the 
Department of Defense suggest that the 
DOD Disability System separates (with 
benefits) 14,000 servicemembers 
annually. Consequently, at any one time 
the Department estimates that there are 
1,500 to 14,000 seriously injured 
servicemembers whose potential 
caregivers may be eligible for FMLA 
leave under Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986. 
Based on the assumption that the age 

distribution of seriously wounded 
servicemembers is the same as the age 
distribution of all military 
servicemembers deployed in Iraq or 
Afghanistan, the Department used 
CONSAD’s model to compute the 
numbers of servicemembers with 
serious injuries or illnesses who will 
have no potential caregivers, and one, 
two, three, four, or five or more 
potential caregivers who may be eligible 
for FMLA leave.89 The results of this 
analysis are presented in Table A–1.

82 CONSAD Report, 2007, available at: http:// 

www.wagehour.dol.gov. CONSAD developed 
estimates for S. 1894 which did not include 
coverage of ‘‘next of kin’’ or ‘‘nearest blood relative’’ 
as H.R. 4986 does. 

83 The Department’s estimates are based upon the 

dictionary definition of son and daughter rather 
than the definition in the FMLA. As was discussed 
in the Preamble above, this is an important 
distinction, since the FMLA defines ‘‘son or 
daughter’’ to mean a biological, adopted, or foster 
child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a 
person standing in loco parentis, who is either 
under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age or older 
and incapable of self-care because of a mental or 
physical disability. Under the definition of ‘‘son or 
daughter’’ in FMLA, very few FMLA-eligible sons 
or daughters would be able to provide care to a 
covered servicemember with a serious injury or 
illness since, in order to meet the FMLA eligibility 
criteria, a son or daughter ages 18 and over must 

be incapable of self-care and would presumably be 
unable to care for a parent with a serious injury or 
illness. Further, very few parents would have 
FMLA-eligible sons or daughters who are called to 
active duty in the armed forces because, to be 
covered by the current FMLA definition of ‘‘son or 
daughter,’’ such sons or daughters must either be 
(1) under the age of 18 or (2) 18 years or older and 
incapable of self-care. (Only about 35,000 of the 1.4 
million active duty servicemembers are under 18 
years of age). 

84 For a more detailed explanation of the 

methodology see Appendix A in the CONSAD 
Report, 2007. 

85 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 
employment population ratio for civilians 16 years 
and over was 63% in 2007. CONSAD adjusted this 
upwards by 5% (3 percentage points) to 66% to 
account for the fact the working children of 
servicemembers are significantly younger than the 

overall workforce and the employment-population 
ratio of older workers is significantly lower than 
that of the overall workforce (e.g., the employment 
population ratio of workers 55 years and over was 
37.4 in 2007). 

86 The estimated 77.1 million FMLA eligible 
workers under Title I of the FMLA plus the 2.6 
million Federal employees covered by Title 2 of the 
FMLA comprise about 60 percent of U.S. civilian 
employment. 

87 Department of Labor estimate based on 3,082 

divided by 4.1 years (the elapsed time for the 
Commission’s estimate). 

88 This assumption is based on preliminary 

discussions between the Departments of Defense 
and Labor. 

89 Based on the methodology in the CONSAD 

Report, 2007. It is possible for a seriously injured 
servicemember to have more than one caregiver 
such as a spouse, parent, and brother or sister.

Of the 1,500 servicemembers with 

serious injuries or illnesses, 98 are 
likely to have one caregiver, 972 are 
likely to have two caregivers, 402 are 
likely to have three caregivers, and 28 
are likely to have four or more 
caregivers. Based upon Table A–1, the 
Department estimates that under the 
assumption of 1,500 servicemembers 
with serious injuries or illnesses each 
year, 3,370 caregivers would be 
available (i.e., 3,370 = 98 + 972 × 2 + 
402 × 3 + 18 × 4 + 10 × 5); however, 
not all of these caregivers are employed. 
Utilizing the CONSAD model described 
above, the Department estimates that 
there is about 1,900 potential FMLA 
covered and eligible caregivers for the 
1,500 seriously injured and ill 
servicemembers under Section 585(a) of 
H.R. 4986.90 

Alternatively, preliminary estimates 

from the Department of Defense suggest 
that the DOD Disability System 
separates (with benefits) or retires 

14,000 servicemembers annually. Using 
CONSAD’s model and assuming each 
seriously injured and ill servicemember 
would have at least one FMLA-eligible 
caregiver, the Department estimates 
there would be about 17,700 potential 
caregivers for servicemembers who are 
separated through the DOD Disability 
System every year. 

Thus, the Department estimates that 

between 1,900 and 17,700 potential 
caregivers of servicemembers with 
serious injuries or illnesses would be 
eligible for protected FMLA leave under 
Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986. 
Impact of Leave for Qualifying Exigency 
Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986 also adds 
an additional qualifying reason to take 
FMLA leave: ‘‘[b]ecause of any 
qualifying exigency (as the Secretary 
shall, by regulation, determine) arising 
out of the fact that the spouse, or a son, 
daughter, or parent of the employee is 
on active duty (or has been notified of 

an impending call or order to active 
duty) in the Armed Forces in support of 
a contingency operation.’’ This 
provision will be codified in the FMLA 
at 29 U.S.C. 2612(a)(1)(E). 

Preliminary estimates from the 

Department of Defense suggest that 
there are approximately 339,000 
servicemembers currently deployed on 
or activated for contingency operations. 
Based on these numbers, the 
Department used the model in the 
CONSAD Report to develop estimates of 
the number of FMLA covered and 
eligible workers who would take leave 
for a qualifying exigency.91 Based on the 
age distribution of active duty 
servicemembers, the Department 
estimated the number of currently 
deployed or activated personnel in 
contingency operations by age and 
number of family members potentially 
eligible for qualifying exigency leave.92 
The results of this analysis are 
presented in Table A–2.

assumed each seriously injured and ill 

servicemember would be likely to have at least one 
FMLA-eligible caregiver.

brother or sister) eligible for leave for a qualified 
exigency.

Source:  U.S.  DOL/Employment  Standards  Administration  estimates  based  upon  the  model  used  in  CONSAD  2007,  and  Department  of  De-

fense data. 

Of the 339,000 servicemembers 

deployed on or activated for 
contingency operations, about 21,000 
are likely to have one covered family 
member, 197,000 are likely to have two 
covered family members, 108,000 are 
likely to have three covered family 
members, and 12,000 are likely to have 
four or more covered family members. 
Based upon Table A–2, the Department 
estimates 792,000 adult family members 
would be impacted by servicemembers’ 
call to active duty for a contingency 
operation (i.e., 792 = 21 + 197 × 2 + 108 
× 3 + 8 × 4 + 4 × 5); however, not all 
of these family members are employed. 
Utilizing the CONSAD model described 
above, the Department estimates that 
about 330,000 potential FMLA covered 
and eligible family members would be 
eligible to take leave for any qualifying 
exigency under Section 585(a) of H.R. 
4986.93 
Estimated Impacts 

Based upon the preceding analyses, 

the Department estimates that the 
number of employees eligible to take 
FMLA leave under Section 585(a) of 
H.R. 4986 range from 332,000 to 348,000 
workers. Although some of these 
workers may already be taking FMLA 
leave for other covered conditions, some 
may not. If the leave usage among the 
workers eligible to take FMLA leave 
under the new military family leave 
provisions of H.R. 4986 and the costs of 
such leave are similar to current FMLA 
leave takers, then one would expect the 
costs of the FMLA to potentially 
increase by as much as 5 percent based 

93 For a more detailed explanation of the 

methodology used to develop this estimate see 
Appendix A in the CONSAD Report, 2007, available 
at: http://www.wagehour.dol.gov. 

upon the potential increased number of 
FMLA eligible workers with qualifying 
reasons to take FMLA leave.94 However, 
there are other factors that must be 
considered. 

• H.R. 4986 does not change the 
scope of the FMLA in terms of the 
establishments covered or the eligibility 
of workers. Many of the costs of the 
FMLA are related to the coverage of the 
establishment or the eligibility of 
workers rather than the number of 
workers taking leave. Since the former 
will not change, assuming a 5 percent 
cost increase may be an over-estimate. 
• The Department estimates that the 

number of employees eligible to take 
FMLA leave under the new military 
family leave provisions of H.R. 4986 
range from 332,000 to 348,000 workers. 
However, just as all workers eligible to 
take FMLA leave do not take FMLA 
leave when they or a qualified family 
member have a serious health 
condition,95 similarly, not all employees 
eligible to take FMLA leave under the 
new military family leave provisions of 
H.R. 4986 will take such leave. 
Therefore, assuming a 5 percent cost 
increase may be an over-estimate. 

The Department requests information 

and data related to the impacts of 
workers taking FMLA leave and how 
these impacts might apply to workers 
taking FMLA under the additional 

94 The Department estimates that 7.0 million 

workers took FMLA leave under the current statute 
in 2005; 332,000 to 348,000 additional workers 
represents an increase of 4.7 to 5.0 percent. 

95 For example, only one family member may 
choose to act as the caregiver even though other 
family members are eligible to take family leave 
(e.g., two spouses may be eligible to take FMLA 
leave for a seriously ill child but only one may 
choose to do so).

qualifying circumstances permitted 
under Section 585(a) of H.R. 4986. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act 

requires that agencies prepare initial 
regulatory flexibility analyses for 
proposed rules unless they are not 
expected to have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603, 605(b). 

The FMLA applies to public agencies 

and to private sector employers that 
employ 50 or more employees for each 
working day during 20 or more calendar 
weeks in the current or preceding 
calendar year. 29 U.S.C. 2611(4). In 
addition, the FMLA excludes employees 
from eligibility for FMLA leave if the 
total number of employees employed by 
that employer within 75 miles of that 
worksite is less than 50. 29 U.S.C. 
2611(2)(B)(ii). As explained in the 
FMLA’s legislative history, ‘‘[t]he act 
exempts small businesses and limits 
coverage of private employers to 
employers who employ 50 or more 
employees for each working day during 
20 or more calendar weeks in the 
current or preceding calendar year. 
* * * The employer must, in addition, 
employ at least 50 people within a 75- 
mile radius of the employee’s worksite.’’ 
S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 2 (1993). 

The Department has examined the 

impact of these proposed revisions on 
all the firms covered under the FMLA, 
including those with 50 to 500 
employees, and has estimated the net 
impact of the proposed changes would 
reduce the overall costs for all firms, 
both large and small. Most small 
businesses (establishments), 89.4 
percent, were excluded from coverage 
under the FMLA by Congress. However, 
6.3 percent of establishments with less

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

than 50 employees are covered by the 
Act due to the ‘‘75 mile’’ provision in 
the statute. The Department estimates 
that 633,000 of the 1.1 million covered 
establishments, or 55.8 percent, have 
less than 50 employees. Another 
481,000 establishments have 50 to 500 
employees. Clearly, this is a substantial 
number (although small percentage— 
10.6%) of small employers.96 

On average the proposed rule is 

estimated to have a net cost for these 
small businesses of $13 in the first 
year,97 and a net recurring savings of 
$40 per small business every year after 
that.98 Consequently, the Department 
has determined that because the 
proposed revisions primarily clarify the 
existing rules and reduce overall costs 
to all firms (both large and small), the 
proposed rule as drafted will not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
within the meaning of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act and the Department has 
certified to this effect to the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA. 
Therefore, an initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis is not required for 
this proposed rule. 

However, the new military family 

leave provisions of H.R. 4986 will result 
in an increase in the annual number of 
FMLA leaves taken. If these additional 
leaves significantly increase the 
economic impacts imposed by the 
FMLA regulation on a substantial 
number of small businesses, then a 
regulatory flexibility analysis will be 
required. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 

The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 

of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq, requires 
agencies to prepare a written statement 
that identifies the: (1) Authorizing 
legislation; (2) cost-benefit analysis; (3) 
macro-economic effects; (4) summary of 
State, local, and tribal government 
input; and (5) identification of 
reasonable alternatives and selection, or 
explanation of non-selection, of the least 
costly, most cost-effective or least 
burdensome alternative; for proposed 
rules that include any Federal mandate 
that may result in increased 
expenditures by State, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million or more 
inflation adjusted in any one year, or 

approximately $135 million in 2007 
dollars. 
(1) Authorizing Legislation 

This rule is issued pursuant to Family 
and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 
Public Law 103–3, 107 Stat. 6 (29 U.S.C. 
2601 et seq.). The FMLA entitles eligible 
employees of covered employers to take 
up to a total of twelve weeks of unpaid 
leave during a twelve month period for 
the birth of a child; for the placement of 
a child for adoption or foster care; to 
care for a newborn or newly-placed 
child; to care for a spouse, parent, son 
or daughter with a serious health 
condition; or when the employee is 
unable to work due to the employee’s 
own serious health condition. See 29 
U.S.C. 2612. 

Title I of the FMLA applies to private 

sector employers of fifty or more 
employees, public agencies and certain 
Federal employers and entities, such as 
the U.S. Postal Service and Postal 
Regulatory Commission. While Title I 
generally covers employers with 50 or 
more employees, public agencies are 
covered employers without regard to the 
number of workers employed. 

The FMLA references the definition of 

employee in the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, 29 U.S.C. 203(e) so that most 
individuals employed by a State, 
political subdivision of a State, or 
interstate governmental agency meet the 
definition of employee. 
(2) Cost-Benefit Analysis 

Based upon Table 2.2 in the CONSAD 

Report, the Department estimates that 
approximately 90,000 State and local 
governmental entities will be affected by 
the proposed rule. Nationwide, these 
entities employ more than 19 million 
workers and their annual payrolls are 
$591 billion.99 

The Department’s Preliminary 

Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) 
includes estimates of the net costs 
associated with the proposed rule. The 
Department estimates that the proposed 
revisions will result in a total first year 
net costs of about $26.1 million, and a 
net savings of about $33.9 million, each 
year thereafter. Moreover, this does not 
include the additional savings expected 
in the time-sensitive high-impact 
operations such as public safety. 

On average the proposed rule is 

estimated to have a net cost per

96 The Department of Labor based these estimates 

on the Westat 2000 establishment survey data. 

97 This estimate is based on the first year costs of 

$14.8 million (see Table 6 of the PRIA) and 1.1 
million establishments (see Table 4 of the PRIA). 

98 This estimate is based on the recurring savings 

of $45.2 million (see Table 6 of the PRIA) and 1.1 
million establishments (see Table 4 of the PRIA). 

99 Estimates based upon Table 2.2 on page 7 of 

the 2007 CONSAD Report available at: http:// 
www.wagehour.dol.gov. Estimates presented above 
were developed by summing the CONSAD 
estimates for Public Utilities, Public Transit, Public 
Educational Services and Public Administration. 
Note, however that CONSAD did not have an 
estimate for the number of establishments in public 
utilities. 

employer, including State and local 
governmental entities, of $13 in the first 
year,100 and a net recurring savings of 
$40 per such entities every year after 
that.101 Consequently, the Department 
concludes that the primary impact of 
the proposed revisions will be to reduce 
the burden of the FMLA regulations on 
employers, including State and local 
governmental entities. 

The most significant costs associated 
with the proposed revisions will be the 
first year cost of reviewing and 
implementing the proposed revisions 
($60 million) and the cost of providing 
employees with additional and more 
specific notifications ($139 million). 
Based upon their share of covered 
employment, the share of these first year 
costs for State and local governmental 
entities will be about $50 million, and 
the share of the first year costs for the 
private sector will be about $149 
million.102 

Under the worst case assumption that 

no offsetting savings will occur to the 
State and local entities during the first 
year, these $50 million first year costs 
would be equivalent to raising State and 
local payrolls by less than one- 
hundredth percent (0.01 percent) of the 
$591 billion in total payrolls103 for those 
entities for a single year. Therefore, we 
have tentatively concluded that even 
under the worst case scenario, this 
rulemaking does not increase 
expenditures by State, local, and tribal 
governments above the current 
unfunded mandate threshold. 

Under the worst case assumption that 

no offsetting savings will occur to the 
private sector during the first year, we 
estimate that the first year impacts do 
exceed the approximately $135 million 
threshold under the Act for the private 
sector. The Department feels that this 
scenario is very unlikely, however, and 
that the net expenditures of the private 
sector will be less than the Unfunded 
Mandates threshold. The Department 
specifically requests comment on this 
conclusion. Nevertheless, we believe the 

100 This estimate is based on the first year costs 

for all covered establishments of $14.8 million (see 
Table 6 of the PRIA) and 1.1 million establishments 
(see Table 4 of the PRIA). [Note—these numbers are 
all employers, not just State and local government 
entities.] 

101 This estimate is based on the recurring savings 
for all covered establishments of $45.2 million (see 
Table 6 of the PRIA) and 1.1 million establishments 
(see Table 4 of the PRIA). 

102 State and local governmental entities employ 

about one-quarter (19 million) of the 77 million 
workers covered by Title I of the FMLA. One 
quarter of $200 million is $50 million. 

103 See Table 2.2 on page 7 of the 2007 CONSAD 

Report. The $591 billion estimate was the sum of 
the payrolls in Public Utilities, Public Transit, 
Public Educational Services and Public 
Administration.

cost-benefit analysis provided pursuant 
to the requirements under Executive 
Order 12866 for this economically 
significant rulemaking would meet the 
requirements for analysis under the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. 

The above analysis does not include 
an assessment of the impact of the new 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986. The Department anticipates that 
the new military family leave provisions 
of H.R. 4986 will increase the annual 
number of FMLA leaves taken. If these 
additional leaves increase the economic 
impacts imposed by the FMLA 
regulation on State and local entities, 
then the Department will appropriately 
revise this analysis for the final rule. 

The FMLA does not provide for 

Federal financial assistance or other 
Federal resources to meet the 
requirements of its intergovernmental 
mandates. The Federal mandate 
imposed by this proposed rule is not 
expected to have a measurable effect on 
health, safety, or the natural 
environment. 
(3) Macro-Economic Effects 

Agencies are expected to estimate the 

effect of a regulation on the national 
economy, such as the effect on 
productivity, economic growth, full 
employment, creation of productive 
jobs, and international competitiveness 
of United States goods and services, if 
accurate estimates are reasonably 
feasible and the effect is relevant and 
material. 5 U.S.C. 1532(a)(4). However, 
OMB guidance on this requirement 
notes that such macro-economic effects 
tend to be measurable in nationwide 
econometric models only if the 
economic impact of the regulation 
reaches 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent of 
gross domestic product, or in the range 
of $1.5 billion to $3.0 billion.104 A 
regulation with smaller aggregate effect 
is not likely to have a measurable 
impact in macro-economic terms unless 
it is highly focused on a particular 
geographic region or economic sector, 
which is not the case with this proposed 
rule. 

The Department’s PRIA estimates that 

the total aggregate economic impact of 
this proposed rule ranges from total first 
year net costs of about $26.1 million to 
total net savings of about $33.9 million, 
each year thereafter. Therefore, the 
Department has determined that a full 
macro-economic analysis is not likely to 
show any measurable impact on the 
economy. However, the analysis in the 

104 OMB Guidance on Implementing Title II of 

S.1, March 31, 1995 Memorandum from Sally 
Kazten to the Heads of Executive Departments and 
Agencies, available at http://www.fws.gov/policy/ 
library/rgkatze.pdf.

PRIA does not include an assessment of 
the impact of the new military family 
leave provisions of H.R. 4986. The 
Department anticipates that the new 
military family leave provisions of H.R. 
4986 will increase the annual number of 
FMLA leaves taken. If these additional 
leaves substantially increase the 
economic impacts imposed by the 
FMLA regulation, then the Department 
will appropriately reassess this 
conclusion for the final rule. 
(4) Summary of State, Local, and Tribal 
Government Input 

On December 1, 2006, the Department 

published a Request for Information 
(RFI) in the Federal Register (71 FR 
69504). The RFI asked the public, 
including State, local, and tribal 
governments, to comment on their 
experiences with, and observations of, 
the Department’s administration of the 
law and the effectiveness of the FMLA 
regulations. More than 15,000 
comments were received from workers, 
family members, employers, academics, 
and other interested parties.105 This 
input ranged from personal accounts, 
legal reviews, industry and academic 
studies, and surveys, to 
recommendations for regulatory and 
statutory changes to address particular 
areas of concern. The Department 
published a Report on the comments 
received in response to the 
Department’s RFI in June 2007 (see 72 
FR 35550).106 

The Department received in response 
to the RFI a number of comments from 
various State and local government 
entities across the country, including 
the City of Philadelphia, the City of 
Gillette, the City of Portland , the City 
of New York, the City of Los Angeles, 
Ohio Department of Administrative 
Services, the Ohio Public Employer 
Labor Relations Association, the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the 
Indiana State Personnel Department, 
Spokane County, the University of 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Fairfax County 
Public Schools, the University of 
Minnesota, Washington Metropolitan 
Area Transit Authority, Metro Regional 
Transit Authority (Akron, Ohio), the 
Port Authority of Allegheny County 
(PA), the Transit Authority (Huntington, 
WV), and the Milwaukee Transport 
Services. Many of these entities 
provided input, for instance, on 

105 All comments are available for viewing via the 
public docket of the Wage and Hour Division of the 
Employment Standards Administration, U.S. 
Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, 
NW., Washington, DC 20210. Many comments are

applying uniform call-in procedures and 
seeking medical re-certifications and 
return to work certifications. The 
comments by State and local 
government entities were considered by 
the Department in developing this 
proposed rule and are addressed above 
under the sections of the rule on which 
they commented (see, e.g., preamble 
discussion of §§ 825.302, 825.303, 
825.308, and 825.310). 
(5) Least Burdensome Option or 
Explanation Required 

The Department’s consideration of 

various options is described in the 
preceding section in the preamble. The 
Department believes that it has chosen 
the least burdensome option that 
updates, clarifies, and simplifies the 
rule. 
Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
The proposed rule does not have 

federalism implications as outlined in 
Executive Order 13132 regarding 
federalism. The proposed rule does not 
have substantial direct effects on the 
states, on the relationship between the 
national government and the states, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
Executive Order 13175, Indian Tribal 
Governments 

This proposed rule was reviewed 
under the terms of Executive Order 
13175 and determined not to have 
‘‘tribal implications.’’ The proposed rule 
does not have ‘‘substantial direct effects 
on one or more Indian tribes, on the 
relationship between the Federal 
government and Indian tribes, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
government and Indian tribes.’’ As a 
result, no tribal summary impact 
statement has been prepared. 
Effects on Families 

The undersigned hereby certify that 
this proposed rule will not adversely 
affect the well-being of families, as 
discussed under section 654 of the 
Treasury and General Government 
Appropriations Act, 1999. 
Executive Order 13045, Protection of 
Children 

Executive Order 13045, dated April 
23, 1997 (62 FR 19885), applies to any 
rule that (1) is determined to be 
‘‘economically significant’’ as defined in 
Executive Order 12866, and (2) concerns 
an environmental health or safety risk 
that the promulgating agency has reason 
to believe may have a disproportionate 
effect on children. This proposal is not

7960 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

subject to Executive Order 13045 
because, although this proposed rule 
addresses family and medical leave 
provisions of the FMLA including the 
rights of employees to take leave for the 
birth or adoption of a child and to care 
for a healthy newborn or adopted child, 
and to take leave to care for a son or 
daughter with a serious health 
condition, it has no environmental 
health or safety risks that may 
disproportionately affect children. 
Environmental Impact Assessment 

A review of this proposal in 

accordance with the requirements of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; the 
regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality, 40 CFR 1500 et 
seq.; and the Departmental NEPA 
procedures, 29 CFR part 11, indicates 
that the proposed rule will not have a 
significant impact on the quality of the 
human environment. There is, thus, no 
corresponding environmental 
assessment or an environmental impact 
statement. 
Executive Order 13211, Energy Supply 

This proposed rule is not subject to 

Executive Order 13211. It will not have 
a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy. 
Executive Order 12630, Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights 

This proposal is not subject to 

Executive Order 12630, because it does 
not involve implementation of a policy 
‘‘that has takings implications’’ or that 
could impose limitations on private 
property use. 
Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice 
Reform Analysis 

This proposed rule was drafted and 

reviewed in accordance with Executive 
Order 12988 and will not unduly 
burden the Federal court system. The 
proposed rule was: (1) Reviewed to 
eliminate drafting errors and 
ambiguities; (2) written to minimize 
litigation; and (3) written to provide a 
clear legal standard for affected conduct 
and to promote burden reduction.

Authority: 29 U.S.C. 2654. 

Subpart A—Coverage Under the 
Family and Medical Leave Act 

§ 825.100 The Family and Medical Leave 
Act. 

(a) The Family and Medical Leave Act 
of 1993 (FMLA or Act) allows ‘‘eligible’’ 
employees of a covered employer to take 
job-protected, unpaid leave, or to 
substitute appropriate paid leave if the 
employee has earned or accrued it, for 
up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 
months because of the birth of a child 
and to care for the newborn child, 
because of the placement of a child with 
the employee for adoption or foster care, 
because the employee is needed to care 
for a family member (child, spouse, or 
parent) with a serious health condition, 
or because the employee’s own serious 
health condition makes the employee 
unable to perform the functions of his 
or her job (see § 825.306(b)(4)). In 
certain cases, this leave may be taken on 
an intermittent basis rather than all at 
once, or the employee may work a part- 
time schedule. 

(b) An employee on FMLA leave is 

also entitled to have health benefits 
maintained while on leave as if the 
employee had continued to work 
instead of taking the leave. If an 
employee was paying all or part of the 
premium payments prior to leave, the 
employee would continue to pay his or 
her share during the leave period. The 
employer may recover its share only if 
the employee does not return to work 
for a reason other than the serious 
health condition of the employee or the 
employee’s covered family member, or 
another reason beyond the employee’s 
control. 

(c) An employee generally has a right 

to return to the same position or an 
equivalent position with equivalent pay, 
benefits, and working conditions at the 
conclusion of the leave. The taking of 
FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of 
any benefit that accrued prior to the 
start of the leave. 

(d) The employer has a right to 30 

days advance notice from the employee 
where practicable. In addition, the 
employer may require an employee to 
submit certification from a health care 
provider to substantiate that the leave is 

due to the serious health condition of 
the employee or the employee’s covered 
family member. Failure to comply with 
these requirements may result in a delay 
in the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to 
a uniformly applied policy, the 
employer may also require that an 
employee present a certification of 
fitness to return to work when the 
absence was caused by the employee’s 
serious health condition (see §§ 825.310 
and 825.311(d)). The employer may 
delay restoring the employee to 
employment without such certificate 
relating to the health condition which 
caused the employee’s absence. 

§ 825.101 Purpose of the Act. 

(a) FMLA is intended to allow 

employees to balance their work and 
family life by taking reasonable unpaid 
leave for medical reasons, for the birth 
or adoption of a child, and for the care 
of a child, spouse, or parent who has a 
serious health condition. The Act is 
intended to balance the demands of the 
workplace with the needs of families, to 
promote the stability and economic 
security of families, and to promote 
national interests in preserving family 
integrity. It was intended that the Act 
accomplish these purposes in a manner 
that accommodates the legitimate 
interests of employers, and in a manner 
consistent with the Equal Protection 
Clause of the 14th amendment in 
minimizing the potential for 
employment discrimination on the basis 
of sex, while promoting equal 
employment opportunity for men and 
women. 

(b) The enactment of FMLA was 

predicated on two fundamental 
concerns—the needs of the American 
workforce, and the development of 
high-performance organizations. 
Increasingly, America’s children and 
elderly are dependent upon family 
members who must spend long hours at 
work. When a family emergency arises, 
requiring workers to attend to seriously- 
ill children or parents, or to newly-born 
or adopted infants, or even to their own 
serious illness, workers need 
reassurance that they will not be asked 
to choose between continuing their 
employment, and meeting their personal 
and family obligations or tending to 
vital needs at home. 

(c) The FMLA is both intended and 

expected to benefit employers as well as 
their employees. A direct correlation 
exists between stability in the family 
and productivity in the workplace. 
FMLA will encourage the development 
of high-performance organizations. 
When workers can count on durable 
links to their workplace they are able to 
make their own full commitments to 

their jobs. The record of hearings on 
family and medical leave indicate the 
powerful productive advantages of 
stable workplace relationships, and the 
comparatively small costs of 
guaranteeing that those relationships 
will not be dissolved while workers 
attend to pressing family health 
obligations or their own serious illness. 

§ 825.102 [Reserved] 

§ 825.103 [Reserved] 

§ 825.104 Covered employer. 

(a) An employer covered by FMLA is 
any person engaged in commerce or in 
any industry or activity affecting 
commerce, who employs 50 or more 
employees for each working day during 
each of 20 or more calendar workweeks 
in the current or preceding calendar 
year. Employers covered by FMLA also 
include any person acting, directly or 
indirectly, in the interest of a covered 
employer to any of the employees of the 
employer, any successor in interest of a 
covered employer, and any public 
agency. Public agencies are covered 
employers without regard to the number 
of employees employed. Public as well 
as private elementary and secondary 
schools are also covered employers 
without regard to the number of 
employees employed. (See § 825.600.) 

(b) The terms ‘‘commerce’’ and 

‘‘industry affecting commerce’’ are 
defined in accordance with section 
501(1) and (3) of the Labor Management 
Relations Act of 1947 (LMRA) (29 U.S.C. 
142(1) and (3)), as set forth in the 
definitions at § 825.800 of this part. For 
purposes of the FMLA, employers who 
meet the 50-employee coverage test are 
deemed to be engaged in commerce or 
in an industry or activity affecting 
commerce. 

(c) Normally the legal entity which 

employs the employee is the employer 
under FMLA. Applying this principle, a 
corporation is a single employer rather 
than its separate establishments or 
divisions. 

(1) Where one corporation has an 

ownership interest in another 
corporation, it is a separate employer 
unless it meets the ‘‘joint employment’’ 
test discussed in § 825.106, or the 
‘‘integrated employer’’ test contained in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 

(2) Separate entities will be deemed to 

be parts of a single employer for 
purposes of FMLA if they meet the 
‘‘integrated employer’’ test. Where this 
test is met, the employees of all entities 
making up the integrated employer will 
be counted in determining employer 
coverage and employee eligibility. A 
determination of whether or not 
separate entities are an integrated

employer is not determined by the 
application of any single criterion, but 
rather the entire relationship is to be 
reviewed in its totality. Factors 
considered in determining whether two 
or more entities are an integrated 
employer include: 

(i) Common management; 
(ii) Interrelation between operations; 
(iii) Centralized control of labor 

(iv) Degree of common ownership/ 

relations; and 

financial control. 

(d) An ‘‘employer’’ includes any 

person who acts directly or indirectly in 
the interest of an employer to any of the 
employer’s employees. The definition of 
‘‘employer’’ in section 3(d) of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 
203(d), similarly includes any person 
acting directly or indirectly in the 
interest of an employer in relation to an 
employee. As under the FLSA, 
individuals such as corporate officers 
‘‘acting in the interest of an employer’’ 
are individually liable for any violations 
of the requirements of FMLA. 

§ 825.105 Counting employees for 
determining coverage. 

(a) The definition of ‘‘employ’’ for 

purposes of FMLA is taken from the Fair 
Labor Standards Act, § 3(g). The courts 
have made it clear that the employment 
relationship under the FLSA is broader 
than the traditional common law 
concept of master and servant. The 
difference between the employment 
relationship under the FLSA and that 
under the common law arises from the 
fact that the term ‘‘employ’’ as defined 
in the Act includes ‘‘to suffer or permit 
to work.’’ The courts have indicated 
that, while ‘‘to permit’’ requires a more 
positive action than ‘‘to suffer,’’ both 
terms imply much less positive action 
than required by the common law. Mere 
knowledge by an employer of work 
done for the employer by another is 
sufficient to create the employment 
relationship under the Act. The courts 
have said that there is no definition that 
solves all problems as to the limitations 
of the employer/employee relationship 
under the Act; and that determination of 
the relation cannot be based on 
‘‘isolated factors’’ or upon a single 
characteristic or ‘‘technical concepts,’’ 
but depends ‘‘upon the circumstances of 
the whole activity’’ including the 
underlying ‘‘economic reality.’’ In 
general an employee, as distinguished 
from an independent contractor who is 
engaged in a business of his/her own, is 
one who ‘‘follows the usual path of an 
employee’’ and is dependent on the 
business which he/she serves. 

(b) Any employee whose name 

appears on the employer’s payroll will

be considered employed each working 
day of the calendar week, and must be 
counted whether or not any 
compensation is received for the week. 
However, the FMLA applies only to 
employees who are employed within 
any State of the United States, the 
District of Columbia or any Territory or 
possession of the United States. 
Employees who are employed outside 
these areas are not counted for purposes 
of determining employer coverage or 
employee eligibility. 

(c) Employees on paid or unpaid 

leave, including FMLA leave, leaves of 
absence, disciplinary suspension, etc., 
are counted as long as the employer has 
a reasonable expectation that the 
employee will later return to active 
employment. If there is no employer/ 
employee relationship (as when an 
employee is laid off, whether 
temporarily or permanently) such 
individual is not counted. Part-time 
employees, like full-time employees, are 
considered to be employed each 
working day of the calendar week, as 
long as they are maintained on the 
payroll. 

(d) An employee who does not begin 
to work for an employer until after the 
first working day of a calendar week, or 
who terminates employment before the 
last working day of a calendar week, is 
not considered employed on each 
working day of that calendar week. 

(e) A private employer is covered if it 

maintained 50 or more employees on 
the payroll during 20 or more calendar 
workweeks (not necessarily consecutive 
workweeks) in either the current or the 
preceding calendar year. 

(f) Once a private employer meets the 
50 employees/20 workweeks threshold, 
the employer remains covered until it 
reaches a future point where it no longer 
has employed 50 employees for 20 
(nonconsecutive) workweeks in the 
current and preceding calendar year. 
For example, if an employer who met 
the 50 employees/20 workweeks test in 
the calendar year as of September 1, 
2007, subsequently dropped below 50 
employees before the end of 2007 and 
continued to employ fewer than 50 
employees in all workweeks throughout 
calendar year 2008, the employer would 
continue to be covered throughout 
calendar year 2008 because it met the 
coverage criteria for 20 workweeks of 
the preceding (i.e., 2007) calendar year. 

§ 825.106 Joint employer coverage. 

(a) Where two or more businesses 

exercise some control over the work or 
working conditions of the employee, the 
businesses may be joint employers 
under FMLA. Joint employers may be 
separate and distinct entities with 

separate owners, managers and 
facilities. Where the employee performs 
work which simultaneously benefits 
two or more employers, or works for 
two or more employers at different 
times during the workweek, a joint 
employment relationship generally will 
be considered to exist in situations such 
as: 

(1) Where there is an arrangement 

between employers to share an 
employee’s services or to interchange 
employees; 

(2) Where one employer acts directly 
or indirectly in the interest of the other 
employer in relation to the employee; 
or, 

(3) Where the employers are not 

completely disassociated with respect to 
the employee’s employment and may be 
deemed to share control of the 
employee, directly or indirectly, 
because one employer controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common 
control with the other employer. 

(b)(1) A determination of whether or 

not a joint employment relationship 
exists is not determined by the 
application of any single criterion, but 
rather the entire relationship is to be 
viewed in its totality. For example, joint 
employment will ordinarily be found to 
exist when a temporary or leasing 
agency supplies employees to a second 
employer. 

(2) A type of company that is often 

called a ‘‘Professional Employment 
Organization’’ (PEO) or ‘‘HR 
Outsourcing Vendor’’ contracts with 
client employers merely to perform 
administrative functions—including 
payroll, benefits, regulatory paperwork, 
and updating employment policies. A 
PEO does not enter into a joint 
employment relationship with the 
employees of its client companies 
provided it merely performs these 
administrative functions. On the other 
hand, if in a particular fact situation, a 
PEO has the right to hire, fire, assign, or 
direct and control the client’s 
employees, or benefits from the work 
that the employees perform, such a PEO 
would be a joint employer with the 
client employer. 

(c) In joint employment relationships, 

only the primary employer is 
responsible for giving required notices 
to its employees, providing FMLA leave, 
and maintenance of health benefits. 
Factors considered in determining 
which is the ‘‘primary’’ employer 
include authority/responsibility to hire 
and fire, assign/place the employee, 
make payroll, and provide employment 
benefits. For employees of temporary 
help or leasing agencies, for example, 
the placement agency most commonly 
would be the primary employer.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

7963 

(d) Employees jointly employed by 

two employers must be counted by both 
employers, whether or not maintained 
on one of the employer’s payroll, in 
determining employer coverage and 
employee eligibility. For example, an 
employer who jointly employs 15 
workers from a leasing or temporary 
help agency and 40 permanent workers 
is covered by FMLA. (A special rule 
applies to employees jointly employed 
who physically work at a facility of the 
secondary employer for a period of at 
least one year. See § 825.111(a)(3).) An 
employee on leave who is working for 
a secondary employer is considered 
employed by the secondary employer, 
and must be counted for coverage and 
eligibility purposes, as long as the 
employer has a reasonable expectation 
that that employee will return to 
employment with that employer. 

(e) Job restoration is the primary 

responsibility of the primary employer. 
The secondary employer is responsible 
for accepting the employee returning 
from FMLA leave in place of the 
replacement employee if the secondary 
employer continues to utilize an 
employee from the temporary or leasing 
agency, and the agency chooses to place 
the employee with the secondary 
employer. A secondary employer is also 
responsible for compliance with the 
prohibited acts provisions with respect 
to its temporary/leased employees, 
whether or not the secondary employer 
is covered by FMLA (see § 825.220(a)). 
The prohibited acts include prohibitions 
against interfering with an employee’s 
attempt to exercise rights under the Act, 
or discharging or discriminating against 
an employee for opposing a practice 
which is unlawful under FMLA. A 
covered secondary employer will be 
responsible for compliance with all the 
provisions of the FMLA with respect to 
its regular, permanent workforce. 

§ 825.107 Successor in interest coverage. 

(a) For purposes of FMLA, in 

determining whether an employer is 
covered because it is a ‘‘successor in 
interest’’ to a covered employer, the 
factors used under Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act and the Vietnam Era 
Veterans’ Adjustment Act will be 
considered. However, unlike Title VII, 
whether the successor has notice of the 
employee’s claim is not a consideration. 
Notice may be relevant, however, in 
determining successor liability for 
violations of the predecessor. The 
factors to be considered include: 

(1) Substantial continuity of the same 

business operations; 

(2) Use of the same plant; 
(3) Continuity of the workforce;

(4) Similarity of jobs and working 

conditions; 

personnel; 

(5) Similarity of supervisory 

(6) Similarity in machinery, 

equipment, and production methods; 

(7) Similarity of products or services; 

and 

(8) The ability of the predecessor to 

provide relief. 

(b) A determination of whether or not 

a ‘‘successor in interest’’ exists is not 
determined by the application of any 
single criterion, but rather the entire 
circumstances are to be viewed in their 
totality. 

(c) When an employer is a ‘‘successor 
in interest,’’ employees’ entitlements are 
the same as if the employment by the 
predecessor and successor were 
continuous employment by a single 
employer. For example, the successor, 
whether or not it meets FMLA coverage 
criteria, must grant leave for eligible 
employees who had provided 
appropriate notice to the predecessor, or 
continue leave begun while employed 
by the predecessor, including 
maintenance of group health benefits 
during the leave and job restoration at 
the conclusion of the leave. A successor 
which meets FMLA’s coverage criteria 
must count periods of employment and 
hours worked for the predecessor for 
purposes of determining employee 
eligibility for FMLA leave. 

§ 825.108 Public agency coverage. 

(a) An ‘‘employer’’ under FMLA 

includes any ‘‘public agency,’’ as 
defined in section 3(x) of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 203(x). Section 
3(x) of the FLSA defines ‘‘public 
agency’’ as the government of the 
United States; the government of a State 
or political subdivision of a State; or an 
agency of the United States, a State, or 
a political subdivision of a State, or any 
interstate governmental agency. ‘‘State’’ 
is further defined in Section 3(c) of the 
FLSA to include any State of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, or any 
Territory or possession of the United 
States. 

(b) The determination of whether an 

entity is a ‘‘public’’ agency, as 
distinguished from a private employer, 
is determined by whether the agency 
has taxing authority, or whether the 
chief administrative officer or board, 
etc., is elected by the voters-at-large or 
their appointment is subject to approval 
by an elected official. 

(c)(1) A State or a political 

subdivision of a State constitutes a 
single public agency and, therefore, a 
single employer for purposes of 
determining employee eligibility. For 
example, a State is a single employer; a 

county is a single employer; a city or 
town is a single employer. Where there 
is any question about whether a public 
entity is a public agency, as 
distinguished from a part of another 
public agency, the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census’ ‘‘Census of Governments’’ will 
be determinative, except for new 
entities formed since the most recent 
publication of the ‘‘Census.’’ For new 
entities, the criteria used by the Bureau 
of the Census will be used to determine 
whether an entity is a public agency or 
a part of another agency, including 
existence as an organized entity, 
governmental character, and substantial 
autonomy of the entity. 

(2) The Census Bureau takes a census 

of governments at 5-year intervals. 
Volume I, Government Organization, 
contains the official counts of the 
number of State and local governments. 
It includes tabulations of governments 
by State, type of government, size, and 
county location. Also produced is a 
universe list of governmental units, 
classified according to type of 
government. Copies of Volume I, 
Government Organization, and 
subsequent volumes are available from 
the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC 20402, U.S. Department 
of Commerce District Offices, or can be 
found in Regional and selective 
depository libraries. For a list of all 
depository libraries, write to the 
Government Printing Office, 710 N. 
Capitol St., NW., Washington, DC 
20402. 

(d) All public agencies are covered by 

the FMLA regardless of the number of 
employees; they are not subject to the 
coverage threshold of 50 employees 
carried on the payroll each day for 20 
or more weeks in a year. However, 
employees of public agencies must meet 
all of the requirements of eligibility, 
including the requirement that the 
employer (e.g., State) employ 50 
employees at the worksite or within 75 
miles. 

§ 825.109 Federal agency coverage. 

(a) Most employees of the government 
of the United States, if they are covered 
by the FMLA, are covered under Title II 
of the FMLA (incorporated in Title V, 
Chapter 63, Subchapter 5 of the United 
States Code) which is administered by 
the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM). OPM has separate 
regulations at 5 CFR Part 630, Subpart 
L. Employees of the Government 
Printing Office are covered by Title II. 
While employees of the Government 
Accountability Office and the Library of 
Congress are covered by Title I of the 
FMLA, the Comptroller General of the

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

United States and the Librarian of 
Congress, respectively, have 
responsibility for the administration of 
the FMLA with respect to these 
employees. Other legislative branch 
employees, such as employees of the 
Senate and House of Representatives, 
are covered by the Congressional 
Accountability Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 
1301. 

(b) The Federal Executive Branch 
employees within the jurisdiction of 
these regulations include: 

(1) Employees of the Postal Service; 
(2) Employees of the Postal Regulatory 

Commission; 

(3) A part-time employee who does 
not have an established regular tour of 
duty during the administrative 
workweek; and, 

(4) An employee serving under an 

intermittent appointment or temporary 
appointment with a time limitation of 
one year or less. 

(c) Employees of other Federal 

executive agencies are also covered by 
these regulations if they are not covered 
by Title II of FMLA. 

(d) Employees of the judicial branch 

of the United States are covered by these 
regulations only if they are employed in 
a unit which has employees in the 
competitive service. For example, 
employees of the U.S. Tax Court are 
covered by these regulations. 

(e) For employees covered by these 

regulations, the U.S. Government 
constitutes a single employer for 
purposes of determining employee 
eligibility. These employees must meet 
all of the requirements for eligibility, 
including the requirement that the 
Federal Government employ 50 
employees at the worksite or within 75 
miles. 

§ 825.110 Eligible employee. 

(a) An ‘‘eligible employee’’ is an 

employee of a covered employer who: 

(1) Has been employed by the 

employer for at least 12 months, and 
(2) Has been employed for at least 
1,250 hours of service during the 12- 
month period immediately preceding 
the commencement of the leave, and 
(3) Is employed at a worksite where 

50 or more employees are employed by 
the employer within 75 miles of that 
worksite. (See § 825.105(b) regarding 
employees who work outside the U.S.) 
(b) The 12 months an employee must 

have been employed by the employer 
need not be consecutive months, 
provided 

(1) Subject to the exceptions provided 

in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
employment periods prior to a break in 
service of five years or more need not 
be counted in determining whether the

employee has been employed by the 
employer for at least 12 months. 

(2) Employment periods preceding a 
break in service of more than five years 
must be counted in determining 
whether the employee has been 
employed by the employer for at least 
12 months where: 

(i) The employee’s break in service is 
occasioned by the fulfillment of his or 
her National Guard or Reserve military 
service obligation. The time served 
performing the military service must be 
also counted in determining whether 
the employee has been employed for at 
least 12 months by the employer. 
However, this section does not provide 
any greater entitlement to the employee 
than would be available under the 
Uniformed Services Employment and 
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA); or 

(ii) A written agreement, including a 
collective bargaining agreement, exists 
concerning the employer’s intention to 
rehire the employee after the break in 
service (e.g., for purposes of the 
employee furthering his or her 
education or for childrearing purposes). 

(3) If an employee is maintained on 

the payroll for any part of a week, 
including any periods of paid or unpaid 
leave (sick, vacation) during which 
other benefits or compensation are 
provided by the employer (e.g., workers’ 
compensation, group health plan 
benefits, etc.), the week counts as a 
week of employment. For purposes of 
determining whether intermittent/ 
occasional/casual employment qualifies 
as ‘‘at least 12 months,’’ 52 weeks is 
deemed to be equal to 12 months. 

(4) Nothing in this section prevents 

employers from considering 
employment prior to a continuous break 
in service of more than five years when 
determining whether an employee has 
met the 12–month employment 
requirement. However, if an employer 
chooses to recognize such prior 
employment, the employer must do so 
uniformly, with respect to all employees 
with similar breaks in service. 

(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph 

(c)(2) of this section, whether an 
employee has worked the minimum 
1,250 hours of service is determined 
according to the principles established 
under the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA) for determining compensable 
hours of work. (See 29 CFR part 785.) 
The determining factor is the number of 
hours an employee has worked for the 
employer within the meaning of the 
FLSA. The determination is not limited 
by methods of recordkeeping, or by 
compensation agreements that do not 
accurately reflect all of the hours an 
employee has worked for or been in 
service to the employer. Any accurate 

accounting of actual hours worked 
under FLSA’s principles may be used. 

(2) An employee returning from 

fulfilling his or her National Guard or 
Reserve military obligation shall be 
credited with the hours-of-service that 
would have been performed but for the 
period of military service in 
determining whether the employee 
worked the 1,250 hours of service. 
Accordingly, a person reemployed 
following military service has the hours 
that would have been worked for the 
employer added to any hours actually 
worked during the previous 12-month 
period to meet the 1,250 hour 
requirement. In order to determine the 
hours that would have been worked 
during the period of military service, the 
employee’s pre-service work schedule 
can generally be used for calculations. 
(3) In the event an employer does not 

maintain an accurate record of hours 
worked by an employee, including for 
employees who are exempt from FLSA’s 
requirement that a record be kept of 
their hours worked (e.g., bona fide 
executive, administrative, and 
professional employees as defined in 
FLSA Regulations, 29 CFR part 541), the 
employer has the burden of showing 
that the employee has not worked the 
requisite hours. An employer must be 
able to clearly demonstrate, for example, 
that full-time teachers (see § 825.800 for 
definition) of an elementary or 
secondary school system, or institution 
of higher education, or other 
educational establishment or institution 
(who often work outside the classroom 
or at their homes) did not work 1,250 
hours during the previous 12 months in 
order to claim that the teachers are not 
eligible for FMLA leave. 

(d) The determination of whether an 
employee has worked for the employer 
for at least 1,250 hours in the past 12 
months and has been employed by the 
employer for a total of at least 12 
months must be made as of the date the 
FMLA leave is to start. An employee 
may be on ‘‘non-FMLA leave’’ at the 
time he/she meets the eligibility 
requirements, and in that event, any 
portion of the leave taken for an FMLA- 
qualifying reason after the employee 
meets the eligibility requirement would 
be ‘‘FMLA leave.’’ (See § 825.300(b) for 
rules governing the content of the 
eligibility notice given to employees.) 

(e) Whether 50 employees are 

employed within 75 miles to ascertain 
an employee’s eligibility for FMLA 
benefits is determined when the 
employee gives notice of the need for 
leave. Whether the leave is to be taken 
at one time or on an intermittent or 
reduced leave schedule basis, once an 
employee is determined eligible in

response to that notice of the need for 
leave, the employee’s eligibility is not 
affected by any subsequent change in 
the number of employees employed at 
or within 75 miles of the employee’s 
worksite, for that specific notice of the 
need for leave. Similarly, an employer 
may not terminate employee leave that 
has already started if the employee- 
count drops below 50. For example, if 
an employer employs 60 employees in 
August, but expects that the number of 
employees will drop to 40 in December, 
the employer must grant FMLA benefits 
to an otherwise eligible employee who 
gives notice of the need for leave in 
August for a period of leave to begin in 
December. 

§ 825.111 Determining whether 50 
employees are employed within 75 miles. 
(a) Generally, a worksite can refer to 

either a single location or a group of 
contiguous locations. Structures which 
form a campus or industrial park, or 
separate facilities in proximity with one 
another, may be considered a single site 
of employment. On the other hand, 
there may be several single sites of 
employment within a single building, 
such as an office building, if separate 
employers conduct activities within the 
building. For example, an office 
building with 50 different businesses as 
tenants will contain 50 sites of 
employment. The offices of each 
employer will be considered separate 
sites of employment for purposes of 
FMLA. An employee’s worksite under 
FMLA will ordinarily be the site the 
employee reports to or, if none, from 
which the employee’s work is assigned. 
(1) Separate buildings or areas which 

are not directly connected or in 
immediate proximity are a single 
worksite if they are in reasonable 
geographic proximity, are used for the 
same purpose, and share the same staff 
and equipment. For example, if an 
employer manages a number of 
warehouses in a metropolitan area but 
regularly shifts or rotates the same 
employees from one building to another, 
the multiple warehouses would be a 
single worksite. 

(2) For employees with no fixed 

worksite, e.g., construction workers, 
transportation workers (e.g., truck 
drivers, seamen, pilots), salespersons, 
etc., the ‘‘worksite’’ is the site to which 
they are assigned as their home base, 
from which their work is assigned, or to 
which they report. For example, if a 
construction company headquartered in 
New Jersey opened a construction site 
in Ohio, and set up a mobile trailer on 
the construction site as the company’s 
on-site office, the construction site in 
Ohio would be the worksite for any 

employees hired locally who report to 
the mobile trailer/company office daily 
for work assignments, etc. If that 
construction company also sent 
personnel such as job superintendents, 
foremen, engineers, an office manager, 
etc., from New Jersey to the job site in 
Ohio, those workers sent from New 
Jersey continue to have the headquarters 
in New Jersey as their ‘‘worksite.’’ The 
workers who have New Jersey as their 
worksite would not be counted in 
determining eligibility of employees 
whose home base is the Ohio worksite, 
but would be counted in determining 
eligibility of employees whose home 
base is New Jersey. For transportation 
employees, their worksite is the 
terminal to which they are assigned, 
report for work, depart, and return after 
completion of a work assignment. For 
example, an airline pilot may work for 
an airline with headquarters in New 
York, but the pilot regularly reports for 
duty and originates or begins flights 
from the company’s facilities located in 
an airport in Chicago and returns to 
Chicago at the completion of one or 
more flights to go off duty. The pilot’s 
worksite is the facility in Chicago. An 
employee’s personal residence is not a 
worksite in the case of employees such 
as salespersons who travel a sales 
territory and who generally leave to 
work and return from work to their 
personal residence, or employees who 
work at home, as under the concept of 
flexiplace or telecommuting. Rather, 
their worksite is the office to which they 
report and from which assignments are 
made. 

(3) For purposes of determining that 

employee’s eligibility, when an 
employee is jointly employed by two or 
more employers (see § 825.106), the 
employee’s worksite is the primary 
employer’s office from which the 
employee is assigned or reports, unless 
the employee has physically worked for 
at least one year at a facility of a 
secondary employer, in which case the 
employee’s worksite is that location. 
The employee is also counted by the 
secondary employer to determine 
eligibility for the secondary employer’s 
full-time or permanent employees. 

(b) The 75-mile distance is measured 

by surface miles, using surface 
transportation over public streets, roads, 
highways and waterways, by the 
shortest route from the facility where 
the eligible employee needing leave is 
employed. Absent available surface 
transportation between worksites, the 
distance is measured by using the most 
frequently utilized mode of 
transportation (e.g., airline miles).

employees are employed within 75

miles of the worksite of an employee is 
based on the number of employees 
maintained on the payroll. Employees of 
educational institutions who are 
employed permanently or who are 
under contract are ‘‘maintained on the 
payroll’’ during any portion of the year 
when school is not in session. See 
§ 825.105(c). 

§ 825.112 Qualifying reasons for leave, 
general rule. 

(a) Circumstances qualifying for leave. 

Employers covered by FMLA are 
required to grant leave to eligible 
employees: 

(1) For birth of a son or daughter, and 

to care for the newborn child (see 
§ 825.120); 

(2) For placement with the employee 

of a son or daughter for adoption or 
foster care (see § 825.121); 

(3) To care for the employee’s spouse, 

son, daughter, or parent with a serious 
health condition (see §§ 825.113 and 
825.122); and 

(4) Because of a serious health 

condition that makes the employee 
unable to perform the functions of the 
employee’s job (see §§ 825.113 and 
825.123). 

(b) Equal application. The right to 

take leave under FMLA applies equally 
to male and female employees. A father, 
as well as a mother, can take family 
leave for the birth, placement for 
adoption or foster care of a child. 

(c) Active employee. In situations 

where the employer/employee 
relationship has been interrupted, such 
as an employee who has been on layoff, 
the employee must be recalled or 
otherwise be re-employed before being 
eligible for FMLA leave. Under such 
circumstances, an eligible employee is 
immediately entitled to further FMLA 
leave for a qualifying reason. 

§ 825.113 Serious health condition. 

(a) For purposes of FMLA, ‘‘serious 

health condition’’ entitling an employee 
to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, 
impairment or physical or mental 
condition that involves inpatient care as 
defined in § 825.114 or continuing 
treatment by a health care provider as 
defined in § 825.115. 

(b) The term ‘‘incapacity’’ means 
inability to work, attend school or 
perform other regular daily activities 
due to the serious health condition, 
treatment therefor, or recovery 
therefrom. 

(c) The term ‘‘treatment’’ includes 

(but is not limited to) examinations to 
determine if a serious health condition 
exists and evaluations of the condition. 
Treatment does not include routine 
physical examinations, eye

examinations, or dental examinations. A 
regimen of continuing treatment 
includes, for example, a course of 
prescription medication (e.g., an 
antibiotic) or therapy requiring special 
equipment to resolve or alleviate the 
health condition (e.g., oxygen). A 
regimen of continuing treatment that 
includes the taking of over-the-counter 
medications such as aspirin, 
antihistamines, or salves; or bed-rest, 
drinking fluids, exercise, and other 
similar activities that can be initiated 
without a visit to a health care provider, 
is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute 
a regimen of continuing treatment for 
purposes of FMLA leave. 

(d) Conditions for which cosmetic 
treatments are administered (such as 
most treatments for acne or plastic 
surgery) are not ‘‘serious health 
conditions’’ unless inpatient hospital 
care is required or unless complications 
develop. Ordinarily, unless 
complications arise, the common cold, 
the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor 
ulcers, headaches other than migraine, 
routine dental or orthodontia problems, 
periodontal disease, etc., are examples 
of conditions that do not meet the 
definition of a serious health condition 
and do not qualify for FMLA leave. 
Restorative dental or plastic surgery 
after an injury or removal of cancerous 
growths are serious health conditions 
provided all the other conditions of this 
regulation are met. Mental illness 
resulting from stress, or allergies may be 
serious health conditions, but only if all 
the conditions of this section are met. 

§ 825.114 Inpatient care. 

Inpatient care means an overnight 

stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential 
medical care facility, including any 
period of incapacity as defined in 
§ 825.113(b), or any subsequent 
treatment in connection with such 
inpatient care. 

§ 825.115 Continuing treatment. 

A serious health condition involving 

continuing treatment by a health care 
provider includes any one or more of 
the following: 

(a) Incapacity and treatment. A period 

of incapacity of more than three 
consecutive calendar days, and any 
subsequent treatment or period of 
incapacity relating to the same 
condition, that also involves: 

(1) Treatment two or more times, 

within a 30-day period unless 
extenuating circumstances exist, by a 
health care provider, by a nurse under 
direct supervision of a health care 
provider, or by a provider of health care 
services (e.g., physical therapist) under

orders of, or on referral by, a health care 
provider; or 

(2) Treatment by a health care 

provider on at least one occasion, which 
results in a regimen of continuing 
treatment under the supervision of the 
health care provider. 

(b) Pregnancy or prenatal care. Any 
period of incapacity due to pregnancy, 
or for prenatal care. See also § 825.120. 
(c) Chronic conditions. Any period of 

incapacity or treatment for such 
incapacity due to a chronic serious 
health condition. A chronic serious 
health condition is one which: 

(1) Requires periodic visits (defined as 

at least twice a year) for treatment by a 
health care provider, or by a nurse 
under direct supervision of a health care 
provider; 

(2) Continues over an extended period 
of time (including recurring episodes of 
a single underlying condition); and 

(3) May cause episodic rather than a 

continuing period of incapacity (e.g., 
asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.). 

(d) Permanent or long-term 

conditions. A period of incapacity 
which is permanent or long-term due to 
a condition for which treatment may not 
be effective. The employee or family 
member must be under the continuing 
supervision of, but need not be 
receiving active treatment by, a health 
care provider. Examples include 
Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, or the 
terminal stages of a disease. 

(e) Conditions requiring multiple 

treatments. Any period of absence to 
receive multiple treatments (including 
any period of recovery therefrom) by a 
health care provider or by a provider of 
health care services under orders of, or 
on referral by, a health care provider, 
for: 

(1) Restorative surgery after an 

accident or other injury; or 

(2) A condition that would likely 

result in a period of incapacity of more 
than three consecutive calendar days in 
the absence of medical intervention or 
treatment, such as cancer 
(chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe 
arthritis (physical therapy), kidney 
disease (dialysis). 

(f) Absences attributable to incapacity 
under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section 
qualify for FMLA leave even though the 
employee or the covered family member 
does not receive treatment from a health 
care provider during the absence, and 
even if the absence does not last more 
than three consecutive calendar days. 
For example, an employee with asthma 
may be unable to report for work due to 
the onset of an asthma attack or because 
the employee’s health care provider has 
advised the employee to stay home 
when the pollen count exceeds a certain 

level. An employee who is pregnant 
may be unable to report to work because 
of severe morning sickness. 

§ 825.116 [Reserved] 

§ 825.117 [Reserved] 

§ 825.118 [Reserved] 

§ 825.119 Leave for treatment of 
substance abuse. 

(a) Substance abuse may be a serious 

health condition if the conditions of 
§§ 825.113 through 825.115 are met. 
However, FMLA leave may only be 
taken for treatment for substance abuse 
by a health care provider or by a 
provider of health care services on 
referral by a health care provider. On 
the other hand, absence because of the 
employee’s use of the substance, rather 
than for treatment, does not qualify for 
FMLA leave. 

(b) Treatment for substance abuse 
does not prevent an employer from 
taking employment action against an 
employee. The employer may not take 
action against the employee because the 
employee has exercised his or her right 
to take FMLA leave for treatment. 
However, if the employer has an 
established policy, applied in a non- 
discriminatory manner that has been 
communicated to all employees, that 
provides under certain circumstances an 
employee may be terminated for 
substance abuse, pursuant to that policy 
the employee may be terminated 
whether or not the employee is 
presently taking FMLA leave. An 
employee may also take FMLA leave to 
care for a covered family member who 
is receiving treatment for substance 
abuse. The employer may not take 
action against an employee who is 
providing care for a covered family 
member receiving treatment for 
substance abuse. 

§ 825.120 Leave for pregnancy or birth. 

(a) General rules. Eligible employees 

are entitled to FMLA leave for 
pregnancy or birth of a child as follows: 

(1) Both the mother and father are 

entitled to FMLA leave for the birth of 
their child. 

(2) Both the mother and father are 

entitled to FMLA leave to be with the 
healthy newborn child (i.e., bonding 
time) during the 12-month period 
beginning on the date of birth. An 
employee’s entitlement to leave for a 
birth expires at the end of the 12-month 
period beginning on the date of the 
birth, unless State law allows, or the 
employer permits, leave to be taken for 
a longer period. Any such FMLA leave 
must be concluded within this one-year 
period. However, see § 825.701

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

7967 

regarding non-FMLA leave which may 
be available under applicable State 
laws. Under this section, both the 
mother and father are entitled to FMLA 
leave even if the newborn does not have 
a serious health condition. 

(3) A husband and wife who are 

eligible for FMLA leave and are 
employed by the same covered 
employer may be limited to a combined 
total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12- 
month period if the leave is taken for 
birth of the employee’s son or daughter 
or to care for the child after birth, for 
placement of a son or daughter with the 
employee for adoption or foster care, or 
to care for the child after placement, or 
to care for the employee’s parent with 
a serious health condition. This 
limitation on the total weeks of leave 
applies to leave taken for the reasons 
specified as long as a husband and wife 
are employed by the ‘‘same employer.’’ 
It would apply, for example, even 
though the spouses are employed at two 
different worksites of an employer 
located more than 75 miles from each 
other, or by two different operating 
divisions of the same company. On the 
other hand, if one spouse is ineligible 
for FMLA leave, the other spouse would 
be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA 
leave. Where the husband and wife both 
use a portion of the total 12-week FMLA 
leave entitlement for either the birth of 
a child, for placement for adoption or 
foster care, or to care for a parent, the 
husband and wife would each be 
entitled to the difference between the 
amount he or she has taken individually 
and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other 
purposes. For example, if each spouse 
took 6 weeks of leave to care for a 
healthy, newborn child, each could use 
an additional 6 weeks due to his or her 
own serious health condition or to care 
for a child with a serious health 
condition. Note, too, that many State 
pregnancy disability laws specify a 
period of disability either before or after 
the birth of a child; such periods would 
also be considered FMLA leave for a 
serious health condition of the mother, 
and would not be subject to the 
combined limit. 

(4) The mother is entitled to FMLA 
leave for incapacity due to pregnancy, 
for prenatal care, or for her own serious 
health condition following the birth of 
the child. Circumstances may require 
that FMLA leave begin before the actual 
date of birth of a child. An expectant 
mother may take FMLA leave before the 
birth of the child for prenatal care or if 
her condition makes her unable to work. 
The mother is entitled to leave for 
incapacity due to pregnancy even 
though she does not receive treatment 
from a health care provider during the 

absence, and even if the absence does 
not last for more than three consecutive 
calendar days. For example, a pregnant 
employee may be unable to report to 
work because of severe morning 
sickness. 

(5) The father is entitled to FMLA 

leave if needed to care for his pregnant 
spouse who is incapacitated or for 
prenatal care, or if needed to care for the 
spouse following the birth of a child if 
the spouse has a serious health 
condition. See § 825.124. 

(6) Both the mother and father are 

entitled to FMLA leave if needed to care 
for a child with a serious health 
condition if the requirements of 
§§ 825.113 through 825.115 and .122(c) 
are met. Thus, a husband and wife may 
each take their 12 weeks of FMLA leave 
if needed to care for their newborn child 
with a serious health condition, even if 
both are employed by the same 
employer, provided they have not 
exhausted their entitlements during the 
applicable 12-month FMLA leave 
period. 

(b) Intermittent and reduced schedule 

leave. An eligible employee may use 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave 
after the birth to be with a healthy 
newborn child only if the employer 
agrees. For example, an employer and 
employee may agree to a part-time work 
schedule after the birth. If the employer 
agrees to permit intermittent or reduced 
schedule leave for the birth of a child, 
the employer may require the employee 
to transfer temporarily, during the 
period the intermittent or reduced leave 
schedule is required, to an available 
alternative position for which the 
employee is qualified and which better 
accommodates recurring periods of 
leave than does the employee’s regular 
position. Transfer to an alternative 
position may require compliance with 
any applicable collective bargaining 
agreement, Federal law (such as the 
Americans with Disabilities Act), and 
State law. Transfer to an alternative 
position may include altering an 
existing job to better accommodate the 
employee’s need for intermittent or 
reduced leave. The employer’s 
agreement is not required for 
intermittent leave required by the 
serious health condition of the mother 
or newborn child. See §§ 825.202-.205 
for general rules governing the use of 
intermittent and reduced schedule 
leave. See § 825.121 for rules governing 
leave for adoption or foster care. See 
§ 825.601 for special rules applicable to 
instructional employees of schools.

§ 825.121 Leave for adoption or foster 
care. 

(a) General rules. Eligible employees 

are entitled to FMLA leave for 
placement with the employee of a son 
or daughter for adoption or foster care 
as follows: 

(1) Employees may take FMLA leave 
before the actual placement or adoption 
of a child if an absence from work is 
required for the placement for adoption 
or foster care to proceed. For example, 
the employee may be required to attend 
counseling sessions, appear in court, 
consult with his or her attorney or the 
doctor(s) representing the birth parent, 
submit to a physical examination, or 
travel to another country to complete an 
adoption. The source of an adopted 
child (e.g., whether from a licensed 
placement agency or otherwise) is not a 
factor in determining eligibility for leave 
for this purpose. 

(2) An employee’s entitlement to 

leave for adoption or foster care expires 
at the end of the 12-month period 
beginning on the date of the placement, 
unless State law allows, or the employer 
permits, leave to be taken for a longer 
period. Any such FMLA leave must be 
concluded within this one-year period. 
However, see § 825.701 regarding non- 
FMLA leave which may be available 
under applicable State laws. Under this 
section, the employee is entitled to 
FMLA leave even if the adopted or 
foster child does not have a serious 
health condition. 

(3) A husband and wife who are 

eligible for FMLA leave and are 
employed by the same covered 
employer may be limited to a combined 
total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12- 
month period if the leave is taken for 
the placement of the employee’s son or 
daughter or to care for the child after 
placement, for the birth of the 
employee’s son or daughter or to care 
for the child after birth, or to care for the 
employee’s parent with a serious health 
condition. This limitation on the total 
weeks of leave applies to leave taken for 
the reasons specified as long as a 
husband and wife are employed by the 
‘‘same employer.’’ It would apply, for 
example, even though the spouses are 
employed at two different worksites of 
an employer located more than 75 miles 
from each other, or by two different 
operating divisions of the same 
company. On the other hand, if one 
spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the 
other spouse would be entitled to a full 
12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where the 
husband and wife both use a portion of 
the total 12-week FMLA leave 
entitlement for either the birth of a 
child, for placement for adoption or 
foster care, or to care for a parent, the

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

husband and wife would each be 
entitled to the difference between the 
amount he or she has taken individually 
and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other 
purposes. For example, if each spouse 
took 6 weeks of leave to care for a 
healthy, newly placed child, each could 
use an additional 6 weeks due to his or 
her own serious health condition or to 
care for a child with a serious health 
condition. 

(4) An eligible employee is entitled to 

FMLA leave in order to care for an 
adopted or foster child with a serious 
health condition if the requirements of 
§§ 825.113 through 825.115 and .122(c) 
are met. Thus, a husband and wife may 
each take 12 weeks of FMLA leave if 
needed to care for an adopted or foster 
child with a serious health condition, 
even if both are employed by the same 
employer, provided they have not 
exhausted their entitlements during the 
applicable 12-month FMLA leave 
period. 

(b) Use of intermittent and reduced 
schedule leave. An eligible employee 
may use intermittent or reduced 
schedule leave after the placement of a 
healthy child for adoption or foster care 
only if the employer agrees. Thus, for 
example, the employer and employee 
may agree to a part-time work schedule 
after the placement for bonding 
purposes. If the employer agrees to 
permit intermittent or reduced schedule 
leave for the placement for adoption or 
foster care, the employer may require 
the employee to transfer temporarily, 
during the period the intermittent or 
reduced leave schedule is required, to 
an available alternative position for 
which the employee is qualified and 
which better accommodates recurring 
periods of leave than does the 
employee’s regular position. Transfer to 
an alternative position may require 
compliance with any applicable 
collective bargaining agreement, Federal 
law (such as the Americans with 
Disabilities Act), and State law. Transfer 
to an alternative position may include 
altering an existing job to better 
accommodate the employee’s need for 
intermittent or reduced leave. The 
employer’s agreement is not required for 
intermittent leave required by the 
serious health condition of the adopted 
or foster child. See §§ 825.202 through 
825.205 for general rules governing the 
use of intermittent and reduced 
schedule leave. See § 825.120 for 
general rules governing leave for 
pregnancy and birth of a child. See 
§ 825.601 for special rules applicable to 
instructional employees of schools.

§ 825.122 Definitions of spouse, parent, 
son or daughter, adoption and foster care. 
(a) Spouse. Spouse means a husband 
or wife as defined or recognized under 
State law for purposes of marriage in the 
State where the employee resides, 
including common law marriage in 
States where it is recognized. 

(b) Parent. Parent means a biological, 
adoptive, step or foster father or mother, 
or any other individual who stood in 
loco parentis to the employee when the 
employee was a son or daughter as 
defined in paragraph (c) of this section. 
This term does not include parents ‘‘in 
law.’’ 

(c) Son or daughter. Son or daughter 

means a biological, adopted, or foster 
child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a 
child of a person standing in loco 
parentis, who is either under age 18, or 
age 18 or older and ‘‘incapable of self- 
care because of a mental or physical 
disability’’ at the time that FMLA leave 
is to commence. 

(1) ‘‘Incapable of self-care’’ means that 
the individual requires active assistance 
or supervision to provide daily self-care 
in three or more of the ‘‘activities of 
daily living’’ (ADLs) or ‘‘instrumental 
activities of daily living’’ (IADLs). 
Activities of daily living include 
adaptive activities such as caring 
appropriately for one’s grooming and 
hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating. 
Instrumental activities of daily living 
include cooking, cleaning, shopping, 
taking public transportation, paying 
bills, maintaining a residence, using 
telephones and directories, using a post 
office, etc. 

(2) ‘‘Physical or mental disability’’ 

means a physical or mental impairment 
that substantially limits one or more of 
the major life activities of an individual. 
Regulations at 29 CFR 1630.2(h), (i), and 
(j), issued by the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 
42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define these 
terms. 

(3) Persons who are ‘‘in loco parentis’’ 

include those with day-to-day 
responsibilities to care for and 
financially support a child, or, in the 
case of an employee, who had such 
responsibility for the employee when 
the employee was a child. A biological 
or legal relationship is not necessary. 

(d) Adoption. ‘‘Adoption’’ means 

(e) Foster care. Foster care is 24-hour 
care for children in substitution for, and 
away from, their parents or guardian. 
Such placement is made by or with the 
agreement of the State as a result of a 
voluntary agreement between the parent 
or guardian that the child be removed 
from the home, or pursuant to a judicial 
determination of the necessity for foster 
care, and involves agreement between 
the State and foster family that the foster 
family will take care of the child. 
Although foster care may be with 
relatives of the child, State action is 
involved in the removal of the child 
from parental custody. See § 825.121 for 
rules governing leave for foster care. 
(f) Documenting relationships. For 

purposes of confirmation of family 
relationship, the employer may require 
the employee giving notice of the need 
for leave to provide reasonable 
documentation or statement of family 
relationship. This documentation may 
take the form of a child’s birth 
certificate, a court document, a sworn 
notarized statement, a submitted and 
signed tax return, etc. The employer is 
entitled to examine documentation such 
as a birth certificate, etc., but the 
employee is entitled to the return of the 
official document submitted for this 
purpose. 

§ 825.123 Unable to perform the functions 
of the position. 

(a) Definition. An employee is 

‘‘unable to perform the functions of the 
position’’ where the health care 
provider finds that the employee is 
unable to work at all or is unable to 
perform any one of the essential 
functions of the employee’s position 
within the meaning of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 
12101 et seq., and the regulations at 29 
CFR 1630.2(n). An employee who must 
be absent from work to receive medical 
treatment for a serious health condition 
is considered to be unable to perform 
the essential functions of the position 
during the absence for treatment. 
(b) Statement of functions. An 

employer has the option, in requiring 
certification from a health care provider, 
to provide a statement of the essential 
functions of the employee’s position for 
the health care provider to review. For 
purposes of FMLA, the essential 
functions of the employee’s position are 
to be determined with reference to the 
position the employee held at the time 
notice is given or leave commenced, 
whichever is earlier. A sufficient 
medical certification must specify what 
functions of the employee’s position the 
employee is unable to perform. See 
§ 825.306.

§ 825.124 Needed to care for a family 
member. 

(a) The medical certification provision 
that an employee is ‘‘needed to care for’’ 
a family member encompasses both 
physical and psychological care. It 
includes situations where, for example, 
because of a serious health condition, 
the family member is unable to care for 
his or her own basic medical, hygienic, 
or nutritional needs or safety, or is 
unable to transport himself or herself to 
the doctor, etc. The term also includes 
providing psychological comfort and 
reassurance which would be beneficial 
to a child, spouse or parent with a 
serious health condition who is 
receiving inpatient or home care. 

(b) The term also includes situations 
where the employee may be needed to 
fill in for others who are caring for the 
family member, or to make 
arrangements for changes in care, such 
as transfer to a nursing home. The 
employee need not be the only 
individual or family member available 
to care for the qualified family member. 
(c) An employee’s intermittent leave 

or a reduced leave schedule necessary to 
care for a family member includes not 
only a situation where the family 
member’s condition itself is 
intermittent, but also where the 
employee is only needed 
intermittently—such as where other 
care is normally available, or care 
responsibilities are shared with another 
member of the family or a third party. 
See §§ 825.202 through 825.205 for rules 
governing the use of intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave. 

§ 825.125 Definition of health care 
provider. 

(a) The Act defines ‘‘health care 

provider’’ as: 

(1) A doctor of medicine or 

osteopathy who is authorized to practice 
medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by 
the State in which the doctor practices; 
or 

(2) Any other person determined by 

the Secretary to be capable of providing 
health care services. 

(b) Others ‘‘capable of providing 
health care services’’ include only: 
(1) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical 

psychologists, optometrists, and 
chiropractors (limited to treatment 
consisting of manual manipulation of 
the spine to correct a subluxation as 
demonstrated by X-ray to exist) 
authorized to practice in the State and 
performing within the scope of their 
practice as defined under State law; 

(2) Nurse practitioners, nurse- 

midwives, clinical social workers and 
physician assistants who are authorized 
to practice under State law and who are

performing within the scope of their 
practice as defined under State law; 
(3) Christian Science Practitioners 
listed with the First Church of Christ, 
Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. 
Where an employee or family member is 
receiving treatment from a Christian 
Science practitioner, an employee may 
not object to any requirement from an 
employer that the employee or family 
member submit to examination (though 
not treatment) to obtain a second or 
third certification from a health care 
provider other than a Christian Science 
practitioner except as otherwise 
provided under applicable State or local 
law or collective bargaining agreement. 

(4) Any health care provider from 

whom an employer or the employer’s 
group health plan’s benefits manager 
will accept certification of the existence 
of a serious health condition to 
substantiate a claim for benefits; and 

(5) A health care provider listed above 

who practices in a country other than 
the United States, who is authorized to 
practice in accordance with the law of 
that country, and who is performing 
within the scope of his or her practice 
as defined under such law. 

(c) The phrase ‘‘authorized to practice 

in the State’’ as used in this section 
means that the provider must be 
authorized to diagnose and treat 
physical or mental health conditions. 

Subpart B—Employee Leave 
Entitlements Under the Family and 
Medical Leave Act 

§ 825.200 Amount of leave. 

(a) An eligible employee’s FMLA 

leave entitlement is limited to a total of 
12 workweeks of leave during any 12- 
month period for any one, or more, of 
the following reasons: 

(1) The birth of the employee’s son or 

daughter, and to care for the newborn 
child; 

(2) The placement with the employee 

of a son or daughter for adoption or 
foster care, and to care for the newly 
placed child; 

(3) To care for the employee’s spouse, 

son, daughter, or parent with a serious 
health condition; and 

(4) Because of a serious health 

condition that makes the employee 
unable to perform one or more of the 
essential functions of his or her job. 

(b) An employer is permitted to 

choose any one of the following 
methods for determining the ‘‘12-month 
period’’ in which the 12 weeks of leave 
entitlement occurs: 

(1) The calendar year; 
(2) Any fixed 12-month ‘‘leave year,’’ 
such as a fiscal year, a year required by 
State law, or a year starting on an 
employee’s ‘‘anniversary’’ date; 

(3) The 12-month period measured 
forward from the date any employee’s 
first FMLA leave begins; or, 

(4) A ‘‘rolling’’ 12-month period 

measured backward from the date an 
employee uses any FMLA leave. 

(c) Under methods in paragraphs 

(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section an 
employee would be entitled to up to 12 
weeks of FMLA leave at any time in the 
fixed 12-month period selected. An 
employee could, therefore, take 12 
weeks of leave at the end of the year and 
12 weeks at the beginning of the 
following year. Under the method in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an 
employee would be entitled to 12 weeks 
of leave during the year beginning on 
the first date FMLA leave is taken; the 
next 12-month period would begin the 
first time FMLA leave is taken after 
completion of any previous 12-month 
period. Under the method in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section, the ‘‘rolling’’ 12- 
month period, each time an employee 
takes FMLA leave the remaining leave 
entitlement would be any balance of the 
12 weeks which has not been used 
during the immediately preceding 12 
months. For example, if an employee 
has taken eight weeks of leave during 
the past 12 months, an additional four 
weeks of leave could be taken. If an 
employee used four weeks beginning 
February 1, 2007, four weeks beginning 
June 1, 2007, and four weeks beginning 
December 1, 2007, the employee would 
not be entitled to any additional leave 
until February 1, 2008. However, 
beginning on February 1, 2008, the 
employee would be entitled to four 
weeks of leave, on June 1 the employee 
would be entitled to an additional four 
weeks, etc. 

(d)(1) Employers will be allowed to 
choose any one of the alternatives in 
paragraph (b) of this section provided 
the alternative chosen is applied 
consistently and uniformly to all 
employees. An employer wishing to 
change to another alternative is required 
to give at least 60 days notice to all 
employees, and the transition must take 
place in such a way that the employees 
retain the full benefit of 12 weeks of 
leave under whichever method affords 
the greatest benefit to the employee. 
Under no circumstances may a new 
method be implemented in order to 
avoid the Act’s leave requirements. 
(2) An exception to this required 

uniformity would apply in the case of 
a multi-State employer who has eligible 
employees in a State which has a family 
and medical leave statute. The State 
may require a single method of 
determining the period during which 
use of the leave entitlement is 
measured. This method may conflict

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

with the method chosen by the 
employer to determine ‘‘any 12 months’’ 
for purposes of the Federal statute. The 
employer may comply with the State 
provision for all employees employed 
within that State, and uniformly use 
another method provided by this 
regulation for all other employees. 

(e) If an employer fails to select one 
of the options in paragraph (b) of this 
section for measuring the 12-month 
period, the option that provides the 
most beneficial outcome for the 
employee will be used. The employer 
may subsequently select an option only 
by providing the 60-day notice to all 
employees of the option the employer 
intends to implement. During the 
running of the 60-day period any other 
employee who needs FMLA leave may 
use the option providing the most 
beneficial outcome to that employee. At 
the conclusion of the 60-day period the 
employer may implement the selected 
option. 

(f) For purposes of determining the 
amount of leave used by an employee, 
the fact that a holiday may occur within 
the week taken as FMLA leave has no 
effect; the week is counted as a week of 
FMLA leave. However, if an employee 
is using FMLA leave in increments of 
less than one week, the holiday will not 
count against the employee’s FMLA 
entitlement unless the employee was 
otherwise scheduled and expected to 
work during the holiday. Similarly, if 
for some reason the employer’s business 
activity has temporarily ceased and 
employees generally are not expected to 
report for work for one or more weeks 
(e.g., a school closing two weeks for the 
Christmas/New Year holiday or the 
summer vacation or an employer closing 
the plant for retooling or repairs), the 
days the employer’s activities have 
ceased do not count against the 
employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. 
Methods for determining an employee’s 
12-week leave entitlement are also 
described in § 825.205. 

§ 825.201 Leave to care for a parent. 

(a) General rule. An eligible employee 

is entitled to FMLA leave if needed to 
care for the employee’s parent with a 
serious health condition. Care for 
parents-in-law is not covered by the 
FMLA. See § 825.122(b) for definition of 
parent. 

(b) ‘‘Same employer’’ limitation. A 
husband and wife who are eligible for 
FMLA leave and are employed by the 
same covered employer may be limited 
to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave 
during any 12-month period if the leave 
is taken to care for the employee’s 
parent with a serious health condition, 
for the birth of the employee’s son or

daughter or to care for the child after the 
birth, or for placement of a son or 
daughter with the employee for 
adoption or foster care or to care for the 
child after placement. This limitation on 
the total weeks of leave applies to leave 
taken for the reasons specified as long 
as a husband and wife are employed by 
the ‘‘same employer.’’ It would apply, 
for example, even though the spouses 
are employed at two different worksites 
of an employer located more than 75 
miles from each other, or by two 
different operating divisions of the same 
company. On the other hand, if one 
spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the 
other spouse would be entitled to a full 
12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where the 
husband and wife both use a portion of 
the total 12-week FMLA leave 
entitlement for either the birth of a 
child, for placement for adoption or 
foster care, or to care for a parent, the 
husband and wife would each be 
entitled to the difference between the 
amount he or she has taken individually 
and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other 
purposes. For example, if each spouse 
took 6 weeks of leave to care for a 
parent, each could use an additional 6 
weeks due to his or her own serious 
health condition or to care for a child 
with a serious health condition. 

§ 825.202 Intermittent leave or reduced 
leave schedule. 

(a) Definition. FMLA leave may be 
taken ‘‘intermittently or on a reduced 
leave schedule’’ under certain 
circumstances. Intermittent leave is 
FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of 
time due to a single qualifying reason. 
A reduced leave schedule is a leave 
schedule that reduces an employee’s 
usual number of working hours per 
workweek, or hours per workday. A 
reduced leave schedule is a change in 
the employee’s schedule for a period of 
time, normally from full-time to part- 
time. 

(b) Medical necessity. For intermittent 

leave or leave on a reduced leave 
schedule, there must be a medical need 
for leave (as distinguished from 
voluntary treatments and procedures) 
and it must be that such medical need 
can be best accommodated through an 
intermittent or reduced leave schedule. 
The treatment regimen and other 
information described in the 
certification of a serious health 
condition (see § 825.306) meets the 
requirement for certification of the 
medical necessity of intermittent leave 
or leave on a reduced leave schedule. 
Leave may be taken intermittently or on 
a reduced leave schedule when 
medically necessary for planned and/or 
unanticipated medical treatment of a 

related serious health condition by or 
under the supervision of a health care 
provider, or for recovery from treatment 
or recovery from a serious health 
condition. It may also be taken to 
provide care or psychological comfort to 
a covered family member with a serious 
health condition. 

(1) Intermittent leave may be taken for 

a serious health condition which 
requires treatment by a health care 
provider periodically, rather than for 
one continuous period of time, and may 
include leave of periods from an hour or 
more to several weeks. Examples of 
intermittent leave would include leave 
taken on an occasional basis for medical 
appointments, or leave taken several 
days at a time spread over a period of 
six months, such as for chemotherapy. 
A pregnant employee may take leave 
intermittently for prenatal examinations 
or for her own condition, such as for 
periods of severe morning sickness. An 
example of an employee taking leave on 
a reduced leave schedule is an 
employee who is recovering from a 
serious health condition and is not 
strong enough to work a full-time 
schedule. 

(2) Intermittent or reduced schedule 
leave may be taken for absences where 
the employee or family member is 
incapacitated or unable to perform the 
essential functions of the position 
because of a chronic serious health 
condition even if he or she does not 
receive treatment by a health care 
provider. See § 825.113. 

(c) Birth or placement. When leave is 

taken after the birth of a healthy child 
or placement of a healthy child for 
adoption or foster care, an employee 
may take leave intermittently or on a 
reduced leave schedule only if the 
employer agrees. Such a schedule 
reduction might occur, for example, 
where an employee, with the employer’s 
agreement, works part-time after the 
birth of a child, or takes leave in several 
segments. The employer’s agreement is 
not required, however, for leave during 
which the mother has a serious health 
condition in connection with the birth 
of her child or if the newborn child has 
a serious health condition. See 
§ 825.204 for rules governing transfer to 
an alternative position that better 
accommodates intermittent leave. See 
also § 825.120 (pregnancy) and 
§ 825.121 (adoption and foster care). 

§ 825.203 Scheduling of intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave. 

Eligible employees may take FMLA 

leave on an intermittent or reduced 
schedule basis when medically 
necessary due to the serious health 
condition of a qualified family member

or the employee. See § 825.202. If an 
employee needs leave intermittently or 
on a reduced leave schedule for planned 
medical treatment, then the employee 
must make a reasonable effort to 
schedule the leave so as not to disrupt 
unduly the employer’s operations. 

§ 825.204 Transfer of an employee to an 
alternative position during intermittent 
leave or reduced schedule leave. 

(a) Transfer or reassignment. If an 
employee needs intermittent leave or 
leave on a reduced leave schedule that 
is foreseeable based on planned medical 
treatment for the employee or a family 
member, including during a period of 
recovery from a serious health 
condition, or if the employer agrees to 
permit intermittent or reduced schedule 
leave for the birth of a child or for 
placement of a child for adoption or 
foster care, the employer may require 
the employee to transfer temporarily, 
during the period that the intermittent 
or reduced leave schedule is required, to 
an available alternative position for 
which the employee is qualified and 
which better accommodates recurring 
periods of leave than does the 
employee’s regular position. See 
§ 825.601 for special rules applicable to 
instructional employees of schools. 

(b) Compliance. Transfer to an 
alternative position may require 
compliance with any applicable 
collective bargaining agreement, Federal 
law (such as the Americans with 
Disabilities Act), and State law. Transfer 
to an alternative position may include 
altering an existing job to better 
accommodate the employee’s need for 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave. 
(c) Equivalent pay and benefits. The 

alternative position must have 
equivalent pay and benefits. An 
alternative position for these purposes 
does not have to have equivalent duties. 
The employer may increase the pay and 
benefits of an existing alternative 
position, so as to make them equivalent 
to the pay and benefits of the 
employee’s regular job. The employer 
may also transfer the employee to a part- 
time job with the same hourly rate of 
pay and benefits, provided the 
employee is not required to take more 
leave than is medically necessary. For 
example, an employee desiring to take 
leave in increments of four hours per 
day could be transferred to a half-time 
job, or could remain in the employee’s 
same job on a part-time schedule, 
paying the same hourly rate as the 
employee’s previous job and enjoying 
the same benefits. The employer may 
not eliminate benefits which otherwise 
would not be provided to part-time 
employees; however, an employer may

proportionately reduce benefits such as 
vacation leave where an employer’s 
normal practice is to base such benefits 
on the number of hours worked. 

(d) Employer limitations. An 

employer may not transfer the employee 
to an alternative position in order to 
discourage the employee from taking 
leave or otherwise work a hardship on 
the employee. For example, a white 
collar employee may not be assigned to 
perform laborer’s work; an employee 
working the day shift may not be 
reassigned to the graveyard shift; an 
employee working in the headquarters 
facility may not be reassigned to a 
branch a significant distance away from 
the employee’s normal job location. Any 
such attempt on the part of the 
employer to make such a transfer will be 
held to be contrary to the prohibited 
acts of the FMLA. 

(e) Reinstatement of employee. When 

an employee who is taking leave 
intermittently or on a reduced leave 
schedule and has been transferred to an 
alternative position no longer needs to 
continue on leave and is able to return 
to full-time work, the employee must be 
placed in the same or equivalent job as 
the job he/she left when the leave 
commenced. An employee may not be 
required to take more leave than 
necessary to address the circumstance 
that precipitated the need for leave. 

§ 825.205 Increments of leave for 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave. 
(a) Minimum increment. When an 

employee takes leave on an intermittent 
or reduced leave schedule, an employer 
may limit leave increments to the 
shortest period of time that the 
employer’s payroll system uses to 
account for absences or use of leave, 
provided it is one hour or less. If an 
employee takes leave on an intermittent 
or reduced leave schedule, only the 
amount of leave actually taken may be 
counted toward the 12 weeks of leave to 
which an employee is entitled. The 
normal workweek is the basis of leave 
entitlement. Therefore, if an employee 
who normally works five days a week 
takes off one day, the employee would 
use 1/5 of a week of FMLA leave. 
Similarly, if a full-time employee who 
normally works 8-hour days works 
4-hour days under a reduced leave 
schedule, the employee would use 1/2 
week of FMLA leave. 

(b) Calculation of leave. (1) Where an 

employee normally works a part-time 
schedule or variable hours, the amount 
of leave to which an employee is 
entitled is determined on a pro rata or 
proportional basis by comparing the 
new schedule with the employee’s 
normal schedule. For example, if an 

employee who normally works 30 hours 
per week works only 20 hours a week 
under a reduced leave schedule, the 
employee’s ten hours of leave would 
constitute one-third of a week of FMLA 
leave for each week the employee works 
the reduced leave schedule. 

(2) If an employer has made a 

permanent or long-term change in the 
employee’s schedule (for reasons other 
than FMLA, and prior to the notice of 
need for FMLA leave), the hours worked 
under the new schedule are to be used 
for making this calculation. 

(3) If an employee’s schedule varies 

from week to week, a weekly average of 
the hours worked over the 12 weeks 
prior to the beginning of the leave 
period would be used for calculating the 
employee’s normal workweek. 

§ 825.206 Interaction with the FLSA. 

(a) Leave taken under FMLA may be 

unpaid. If an employee is otherwise 
exempt from minimum wage and 
overtime requirements of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act (FLSA) as a salaried 
executive, administrative, professional, 
or computer employee (under 
regulations issued by the Secretary), 29 
CFR part 541, providing unpaid FMLA- 
qualifying leave to such an employee 
will not cause the employee to lose the 
FLSA exemption. See 29 CFR 
541.602(b)(7). This means that under 
regulations currently in effect, where an 
employee meets the specified duties 
test, is paid on a salary basis, and is paid 
a salary of at least the amount specified 
in the regulations, the employer may 
make deductions from the employee’s 
salary for any hours taken as 
intermittent or reduced FMLA leave 
within a workweek, without affecting 
the exempt status of the employee. The 
fact that an employer provides FMLA 
leave, whether paid or unpaid, and 
maintains records required by this part 
regarding FMLA leave, will not be 
relevant to the determination whether 
an employee is exempt within the 
meaning of 29 CFR part 541. 

(b) For an employee paid in 

accordance with the fluctuating 
workweek method of payment for 
overtime (see 29 CFR 778.114), the 
employer, during the period in which 
intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA 
leave is scheduled to be taken, may 
compensate an employee on an hourly 
basis and pay only for the hours the 
employee works, including time and 
one-half the employee’s regular rate for 
overtime hours. The change to payment 
on an hourly basis would include the 
entire period during which the 
employee is taking intermittent leave, 
including weeks in which no leave is 
taken. The hourly rate shall be

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

determined by dividing the employee’s 
weekly salary by the employee’s normal 
or average schedule of hours worked 
during weeks in which FMLA leave is 
not being taken. If an employer chooses 
to follow this exception from the 
fluctuating workweek method of 
payment, the employer must do so 
uniformly, with respect to all employees 
paid on a fluctuating workweek basis for 
whom FMLA leave is taken on an 
intermittent or reduced leave schedule 
basis. If an employer does not elect to 
convert the employee’s compensation to 
hourly pay, no deduction may be taken 
for FMLA leave absences. Once the need 
for intermittent or reduced scheduled 
leave is over, the employee may be 
restored to payment on a fluctuating 
work week basis. 

(c) This special exception to the 

‘‘salary basis’’ requirements of the FLSA 
exemption or fluctuating workweek 
payment requirements applies only to 
employees of covered employers who 
are eligible for FMLA leave, and to leave 
which qualifies as (one of the four types 
of) FMLA leave. Hourly or other 
deductions which are not in accordance 
with 29 CFR part 541 or 29 CFR 778.114 
may not be taken, for example, from the 
salary of an employee who works for an 
employer with fewer than 50 
employees, or where the employee has 
not worked long enough to be eligible 
for FMLA leave without potentially 
affecting the employee’s eligibility for 
exemption. Nor may deductions which 
are not permitted by 29 CFR part 541 or 
29 CFR 778.114 be taken from such an 
employee’s salary for any leave which 
does not qualify as FMLA leave, for 
example, deductions from an 
employee’s pay for leave required under 
State law or under an employer’s policy 
or practice for a reason which does not 
qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to 
care for a grandparent or for a medical 
condition which does not qualify as a 
serious health condition; or for leave 
which is more generous than provided 
by FMLA, such as leave in excess of 12 
weeks in a year. Employers may comply 
with State law or the employer’s own 
policy/practice under these 
circumstances and maintain the 
employee’s eligibility for exemption or 
for the fluctuating workweek method of 
pay by not taking hourly deductions 
from the employee’s pay, in accordance 
with FLSA requirements, or may take 
such deductions, treating the employee 
as an ‘‘hourly’’ employee and pay 
overtime premium pay for hours worked 
over 40 in a workweek. 

§ 825.207 Substitution of paid leave. 

(a) Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid 

leave. However, under the 

circumstances described in this section, 
FMLA permits an eligible employee to 
choose to substitute paid leave for 
FMLA leave. If an employee does not 
choose to substitute accrued paid leave, 
the employer may require the employee 
to substitute accrued paid leave for 
unpaid FMLA leave. The term 
‘‘substitute’’ means that the paid leave 
provided by the employer, and accrued 
pursuant to established policies of the 
employer, will run concurrently with 
the unpaid FMLA leave. Accordingly, 
the employee receives pay pursuant to 
the employer’s applicable paid leave 
policy during the period of otherwise 
unpaid FMLA leave. An employee’s 
ability to use accrued paid leave is 
determined by the terms and conditions 
of the employer’s normal leave policy. 
Employers may not discriminate against 
employees on FMLA leave in the 
administration of their leave policies. 
When an employee chooses, or an 
employer requires, substitution of 
accrued paid leave, the employer must 
inform the employee that the employee 
must satisfy any procedural 
requirements and meet any additional 
qualifying standards of the paid leave 
policy only in connection with the 
receipt of such payment or benefit. If an 
employee does not comply with the 
additional requirements in an 
employer’s paid leave policy, the 
employee is not entitled to substitute 
accrued paid leave, but the employee 
remains entitled to all the protections of 
unpaid FMLA leave. 

(b) If neither the employee nor the 

employer elects to substitute paid leave 
for unpaid FMLA leave under the above 
conditions and circumstances, the 
employee will remain entitled to all the 
paid leave which is earned or accrued 
under the terms of the employer’s plan. 

(c) If an employee uses paid leave 
under circumstances which do not 
qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will 
not count against the 12 weeks of FMLA 
leave to which the employee is entitled. 
For example, paid sick leave used for a 
medical condition which is not a 
serious health condition does not count 
against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave 
entitlement. 

(d) Disability leave for the birth of a 

child would be considered FMLA leave 
for a serious health condition and 
counted in the 12 weeks of leave 
permitted under FMLA. Because the 
leave pursuant to a temporary disability 
benefit plan is not unpaid, the provision 
for substitution of paid leave is 
inapplicable. However, the employer 
may designate the leave as FMLA leave 
and count the leave as running 
concurrently for purposes of both the 
benefit plan and the FMLA leave

entitlement. Employers and employees 
also may agree, where State law permits, 
to have paid leave supplement the 
temporary disability benefits, such as in 
the case where a plan only provides 
replacement income for two-thirds of an 
employee’s salary. 

(e) The Act provides that a serious 

health condition may result from injury 
to the employee ‘‘on or off’’ the job. If 
the employer designates the leave as 
FMLA leave in accordance with 
§ 825.301, the employee’s FMLA 12- 
week leave entitlement may run 
concurrently with a workers’ 
compensation absence when the injury 
is one that meets the criteria for a 
serious health condition. As the 
workers’ compensation absence is not 
unpaid leave, the provision for 
substitution of the employee’s accrued 
paid leave is not applicable. However, if 
the health care provider treating the 
employee for the workers’ compensation 
injury certifies the employee is able to 
return to a ‘‘light duty job’’ but is unable 
to return to the same or equivalent job, 
the employee may decline the 
employer’s offer of a ‘‘light duty job.’’ 
As a result the employee may lose 
workers’ compensation payments, but is 
entitled to remain on unpaid FMLA 
leave until the 12-week entitlement is 
exhausted. As of the date workers’ 
compensation benefits cease, the 
substitution provision becomes 
applicable and either the employee may 
elect or the employer may require the 
use of accrued paid leave. See also 
§§ 825.210(f), 825.216(d), 825.220(d), 
825.307(a) and 825.702(d) (1) and (2) 
regarding the relationship between 
workers’ compensation absences and 
FMLA leave. 

(f) Section 7(o) of the Fair Labor 

Standards Act (FLSA) permits public 
employers under prescribed 
circumstances to substitute 
compensatory time off accrued at one 
and one-half hours for each overtime 
hour worked in lieu of paying cash to 
an employee when the employee works 
overtime hours as prescribed by the Act. 
There are limits to the amounts of hours 
of compensatory time an employee may 
accumulate depending upon whether 
the employee works in fire protection or 
law enforcement (480 hours) or 
elsewhere for a public agency (240 
hours). In addition, under the FLSA, an 
employer always has the right to cash 
out an employee’s compensatory time or 
to require the employee to use the time. 
Therefore, if an employee requests and 
is permitted to use accrued 
compensatory time to receive pay for 
time taken off for an FMLA reason, or 
if the employer requires such use 
pursuant to the FLSA, the time taken off

for an FMLA reason may be counted 
against the employee’s FMLA leave 
entitlement. 

§ 825.208 [Reserved] 

§ 825.209 Maintenance of employee 
benefits. 

(a) During any FMLA leave, an 

employer must maintain the employee’s 
coverage under any group health plan 
(as defined in the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) on 
the same conditions as coverage would 
have been provided if the employee had 
been continuously employed during the 
entire leave period. All employers 
covered by FMLA, including public 
agencies, are subject to the Act’s 
requirements to maintain health 
coverage. The definition of ‘‘group 
health plan’’ is set forth in § 825.800. 
For purposes of FMLA, the term ‘‘group 
health plan’’ shall not include an 
insurance program providing health 
coverage under which employees 
purchase individual policies from 
insurers provided that: 

(1) No contributions are made by the 

employer; 

(2) Participation in the program is 
completely voluntary for employees; 

(3) The sole functions of the employer 
with respect to the program are, without 
endorsing the program, to permit the 
insurer to publicize the program to 
employees, to collect premiums through 
payroll deductions and to remit them to 
the insurer; 

(4) The employer receives no 

consideration in the form of cash or 
otherwise in connection with the 
program, other than reasonable 
compensation, excluding any profit, for 
administrative services actually 
rendered in connection with payroll 
deduction; and, 

(5) The premium charged with respect 

to such coverage does not increase in 
the event the employment relationship 
terminates. 

(b) The same group health plan 

benefits provided to an employee prior 
to taking FMLA leave must be 
maintained during the FMLA leave. For 
example, if family member coverage is 
provided to an employee, family 
member coverage must be maintained 
during the FMLA leave. Similarly, 
benefit coverage during FMLA leave for 
medical care, surgical care, hospital 
care, dental care, eye care, mental health 
counseling, substance abuse treatment, 
etc., must be maintained during leave if 
provided in an employer’s group health 
plan, including a supplement to a group 
health plan, whether or not provided 
through a flexible spending account or 
other component of a cafeteria plan. 

(c) If an employer provides a new 

health plan or benefits or changes health 
benefits or plans while an employee is 
on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled 
to the new or changed plan/benefits to 
the same extent as if the employee were 
not on leave. For example, if an 
employer changes a group health plan 
so that dental care becomes covered 
under the plan, an employee on FMLA 
leave must be given the same 
opportunity as other employees to 
receive (or obtain) the dental care 
coverage. Any other plan changes (e.g., 
in coverage, premiums, deductibles, 
etc.) which apply to all employees of the 
workforce would also apply to an 
employee on FMLA leave. 

(d) Notice of any opportunity to 

change plans or benefits must also be 
given to an employee on FMLA leave. 
If the group health plan permits an 
employee to change from single to 
family coverage upon the birth of a 
child or otherwise add new family 
members, such a change in benefits 
must be made available while an 
employee is on FMLA leave. If the 
employee requests the changed coverage 
it must be provided by the employer. 
(e) An employee may choose not to 

retain group health plan coverage 
during FMLA leave. However, when an 
employee returns from leave, the 
employee is entitled to be reinstated on 
the same terms as prior to taking the 
leave, including family or dependent 
coverages, without any qualifying 
period, physical examination, exclusion 
of pre-existing conditions, etc. See 
§ 825.212(c). 

(f) Except as required by the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) 
and for ‘‘key’’ employees (as discussed 
below), an employer’s obligation to 
maintain health benefits during leave 
(and to restore the employee to the same 
or equivalent employment) under FMLA 
ceases if and when the employment 
relationship would have terminated if 
the employee had not taken FMLA leave 
(e.g., if the employee’s position is 
eliminated as part of a 
nondiscriminatory reduction in force 
and the employee would not have been 
transferred to another position); an 
employee informs the employer of his or 
her intent not to return from leave 
(including before starting the leave if the 
employer is so informed before the leave 
starts); or the employee fails to return 
from leave or continues on leave after 
exhausting his or her FMLA leave 
entitlement in the 12-month period. 

(g) If a ‘‘key employee’’ (see § 825.218) 

does not return from leave when 
notified by the employer that substantial 
or grievous economic injury will result 

from his or her reinstatement, the 
employee’s entitlement to group health 
plan benefits continues unless and until 
the employee advises the employer that 
the employee does not desire restoration 
to employment at the end of the leave 
period, or FMLA leave entitlement is 
exhausted, or reinstatement is actually 
denied. 

(h) An employee’s entitlement to 

benefits other than group health benefits 
during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., 
holiday pay) is to be determined by the 
employer’s established policy for 
providing such benefits when the 
employee is on other forms of leave 
(paid or unpaid, as appropriate). 

§ 825.210 Employee payment of group 
health benefit premiums. 

(a) Group health plan benefits must be 

maintained on the same basis as 
coverage would have been provided if 
the employee had been continuously 
employed during the FMLA leave 
period. Therefore, any share of group 
health plan premiums which had been 
paid by the employee prior to FMLA 
leave must continue to be paid by the 
employee during the FMLA leave 
period. If premiums are raised or 
lowered, the employee would be 
required to pay the new premium rates. 
Maintenance of health insurance 
policies which are not a part of the 
employer’s group health plan, as 
described in § 825.209(a)(1), are the sole 
responsibility of the employee. The 
employee and the insurer should make 
necessary arrangements for payment of 
premiums during periods of unpaid 
FMLA leave. 

(b) If the FMLA leave is substituted 

paid leave, the employee’s share of 
premiums must be paid by the method 
normally used during any paid leave, 
presumably as a payroll deduction. 
(c) If FMLA leave is unpaid, the 

employer has a number of options for 
obtaining payment from the employee. 
The employer may require that payment 
be made to the employer or to the 
insurance carrier, but no additional 
charge may be added to the employee’s 
premium payment for administrative 
expenses. The employer may require 
employees to pay their share of 
premium payments in any of the 
following ways: 

(1) Payment would be due at the same 

time as it would be made if by payroll 
deduction; 

(2) Payment would be due on the 

same schedule as payments are made 
under COBRA; 

(3) Payment would be prepaid 
pursuant to a cafeteria plan at the 
employee’s option;

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

(4) The employer’s existing rules for 

payment by employees on ‘‘leave 
without pay’’ would be followed, 
provided that such rules do not require 
prepayment (i.e., prior to the 
commencement of the leave) of the 
premiums that will become due during 
a period of unpaid FMLA leave or 
payment of higher premiums than if the 
employee had continued to work 
instead of taking leave; or, 

(5) Another system voluntarily agreed 

to between the employer and the 
employee, which may include 
prepayment of premiums (e.g., through 
increased payroll deductions when the 
need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable). 

(d) The employer must provide the 
employee with advance written notice 
of the terms and conditions under 
which these payments must be made. 
(See § 825.300.) 

(e) An employer may not require more 

of an employee using unpaid FMLA 
leave than the employer requires of 
other employees on ‘‘leave without 
pay.’’ 

(f) An employee who is receiving 

payments as a result of a workers’ 
compensation injury must make 
arrangements with the employer for 
payment of group health plan benefits 
when simultaneously taking FMLA 
leave. See § 825.207(e). 

§ 825.211 Maintenance of benefits under 
multi-employer health plans. 

(a) A multi-employer health plan is a 
plan to which more than one employer 
is required to contribute, and which is 
maintained pursuant to one or more 
collective bargaining agreements 
between employee organization(s) and 
the employers. 

(b) An employer under a multi- 

employer plan must continue to make 
contributions on behalf of an employee 
using FMLA leave as though the 
employee had been continuously 
employed, unless the plan contains an 
explicit FMLA provision for 
maintaining coverage such as through 
pooled contributions by all employers 
party to the plan. 

(c) During the duration of an 

employee’s FMLA leave, coverage by 
the group health plan, and benefits 
provided pursuant to the plan, must be 
maintained at the level of coverage and 
benefits which were applicable to the 
employee at the time FMLA leave 
commenced. 

(d) An employee using FMLA leave 

cannot be required to use ‘‘banked’’ 
hours or pay a greater premium than the 
employee would have been required to 
pay if the employee had been 
continuously employed.

(e) As provided in § 825.209(f) of this 

part, group health plan coverage must 
be maintained for an employee on 
FMLA leave until: 

(1) The employee’s FMLA leave 

entitlement is exhausted; 

(2) The employer can show that the 

employee would have been laid off and 
the employment relationship 
terminated; or, 

(3) The employee provides 

unequivocal notice of intent not to 
return to work. 

§ 825.212 Employee failure to pay health 
plan premium payments. 

(a)(1) In the absence of an established 

employer policy providing a longer 
grace period, an employer’s obligations 
to maintain health insurance coverage 
cease under FMLA if an employee’s 
premium payment is more than 30 days 
late. In order to drop the coverage for an 
employee whose premium payment is 
late, the employer must provide written 
notice to the employee that the payment 
has not been received. Such notice must 
be mailed to the employee at least 15 
days before coverage is to cease, 
advising that coverage will be dropped 
on a specified date at least 15 days after 
the date of the letter unless the payment 
has been received by that date. If the 
employer has established policies 
regarding other forms of unpaid leave 
that provide for the employer to cease 
coverage retroactively to the date the 
unpaid premium payment was due, the 
employer may drop the employee from 
coverage retroactively in accordance 
with that policy, provided the 15-day 
notice was given. In the absence of such 
a policy, coverage for the employee may 
be terminated at the end of the 30-day 
grace period, where the required 15-day 
notice has been provided. 

(2) An employer has no obligation 

regarding the maintenance of a health 
insurance policy which is not a ‘‘group 
health plan.’’ See § 825.209(a). 
(3) All other obligations of an 

employer under FMLA would continue; 
for example, the employer continues to 
have an obligation to reinstate an 
employee upon return from leave. 

(b) The employer may recover the 

employee’s share of any premium 
payments missed by the employee for 
any FMLA leave period during which 
the employer maintains health coverage 
by paying the employee’s share after the 
premium payment is missed. 

(c) If coverage lapses because an 

employee has not made required 
premium payments, upon the 
employee’s return from FMLA leave the 
employer must still restore the 
employee to coverage/benefits 
equivalent to those the employee would 

have had if leave had not been taken 
and the premium payment(s) had not 
been missed, including family or 
dependent coverage. See § 825.215(d)(1) 
through (5). In such case, an employee 
may not be required to meet any 
qualification requirements imposed by 
the plan, including any new preexisting 
condition waiting period, to wait for an 
open season, or to pass a medical 
examination to obtain reinstatement of 
coverage. If an employer terminates an 
employee’s insurance in accordance 
with this section and fails to restore the 
employee’s health insurance as required 
by this section upon the employee’s 
return, the employer may be liable for 
benefits lost by reason of the violation, 
for other actual monetary losses 
sustained as a direct result of the 
violation, and for appropriate equitable 
relief tailored to the harm suffered. 

§ 825.213 Employer recovery of benefit 
costs. 

(a) In addition to the circumstances 
discussed in § 825.212(b), an employer 
may recover its share of health plan 
premiums during a period of unpaid 
FMLA leave from an employee if the 
employee fails to return to work after 
the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement 
has been exhausted or expires, unless 
the reason the employee does not return 
is due to: 

(1) The continuation, recurrence, or 
onset of a serious health condition of 
the employee or the employee’s family 
member which would otherwise entitle 
the employee to leave under FMLA; or 
(2) Other circumstances beyond the 

employee’s control. Examples of ‘‘other 
circumstances beyond the employee’s 
control’’ are necessarily broad. They 
include such situations as where a 
parent chooses to stay home with a 
newborn child who has a serious health 
condition; an employee’s spouse is 
unexpectedly transferred to a job 
location more than 75 miles from the 
employee’s worksite; a relative or 
individual other than a covered family 
member has a serious health condition 
and the employee is needed to provide 
care; the employee is laid off while on 
leave; or, the employee is a ‘‘key 
employee’’ who decides not to return to 
work upon being notified of the 
employer’s intention to deny restoration 
because of substantial and grievous 
economic injury to the employer’s 
operations and is not reinstated by the 
employer. Other circumstances beyond 
the employee’s control would not 
include a situation where an employee 
desires to remain with a parent in a 
distant city even though the parent no 
longer requires the employee’s care, or 
a parent chooses not to return to work

to stay home with a well, newborn 
child. 

(3) When an employee fails to return 

to work because of the continuation, 
recurrence, or onset of a serious health 
condition, thereby precluding the 
employer from recovering its (share of) 
health benefit premium payments made 
on the employee’s behalf during a 
period of unpaid FMLA leave, the 
employer may require medical 
certification of the employee’s or the 
family member’s serious health 
condition. Such certification is not 
required unless requested by the 
employer. The cost of the certification 
shall be borne by the employee, and the 
employee is not entitled to be paid for 
the time or travel costs spent in 
acquiring the certification. The 
employee is required to provide medical 
certification in a timely manner which, 
for purposes of this section, is within 30 
days from the date of the employer’s 
request. For purposes of medical 
certification, the employee may use the 
optional DOL form developed for this 
purpose (see § 825.306(b) and Appendix 
B of this part). If the employer requests 
medical certification and the employee 
does not provide such certification in a 
timely manner (within 30 days), or the 
reason for not returning to work does 
not meet the test of other circumstances 
beyond the employee’s control, the 
employer may recover 100% of the 
health benefit premiums it paid during 
the period of unpaid FMLA leave. 

(b) Under some circumstances an 

employer may elect to maintain other 
benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability 
insurance, etc., by paying the 
employee’s (share of) premiums during 
periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For 
example, to ensure the employer can 
meet its responsibilities to provide 
equivalent benefits to the employee 
upon return from unpaid FMLA leave, 
it may be necessary that premiums be 
paid continuously to avoid a lapse of 
coverage. If the employer elects to 
maintain such benefits during the leave, 
at the conclusion of leave, the employer 
is entitled to recover only the costs 
incurred for paying the employee’s 
share of any premiums whether or not 
the employee returns to work. 

(c) An employee who returns to work 

for at least 30 calendar days is 
considered to have ‘‘returned’’ to work. 
An employee who transfers directly 
from taking FMLA leave to retirement, 
or who retires during the first 30 days 
after the employee returns to work, is 
deemed to have returned to work. 

(d) When an employee elects or an 

employer requires paid leave to be 
substituted for FMLA leave, the 
employer may not recover its (share of) 

health insurance or other non-health 
benefit premiums for any period of 
FMLA leave covered by paid leave. 
Because paid leave provided under a 
plan covering temporary disabilities 
(including workers’ compensation) is 
not unpaid, recovery of health insurance 
premiums does not apply to such paid 
leave. 

(e) The amount that self-insured 

employers may recover is limited to 
only the employer’s share of allowable 
‘‘premiums’’ as would be calculated 
under COBRA, excluding the 2 percent 
fee for administrative costs. 

(f) When an employee fails to return 

to work, any health and non-health 
benefit premiums which this section of 
the regulations permits an employer to 
recover are a debt owed by the non- 
returning employee to the employer. 
The existence of this debt caused by the 
employee’s failure to return to work 
does not alter the employer’s 
responsibilities for health benefit 
coverage and, under a self-insurance 
plan, payment of claims incurred during 
the period of FMLA leave. To the extent 
recovery is allowed, the employer may 
recover the costs through deduction 
from any sums due to the employee 
(e.g., unpaid wages, vacation pay, profit 
sharing, etc.), provided such deductions 
do not otherwise violate applicable 
Federal or State wage payment or other 
laws. Alternatively, the employer may 
initiate legal action against the 
employee to recover such costs. 

§ 825.214 Employee right to reinstatement. 

General rule. On return from FMLA 

leave, an employee is entitled to be 
returned to the same position the 
employee held when leave commenced, 
or to an equivalent position with 
equivalent benefits, pay, and other 
terms and conditions of employment. 
An employee is entitled to such 
reinstatement even if the employee has 
been replaced or his or her position has 
been restructured to accommodate the 
employee’s absence. See also 
§ 825.106(e) for the obligations of joint 
employers. 

§ 825.215 Equivalent position. 

(a) Equivalent position. An equivalent 
position is one that is virtually identical 
to the employee’s former position in 
terms of pay, benefits and working 
conditions, including privileges, 
perquisites and status. It must involve 
the same or substantially similar duties 
and responsibilities, which must entail 
substantially equivalent skill, effort, 
responsibility, and authority. 

(b) Conditions to qualify. If an 

employee is no longer qualified for the 
position because of the employee’s

inability to attend a necessary course, 
renew a license, fly a minimum number 
of hours, etc., as a result of the leave, the 
employee shall be given a reasonable 
opportunity to fulfill those conditions 
upon return to work. 

(c) Equivalent pay. (1) An employee is 

entitled to any unconditional pay 
increases which may have occurred 
during the FMLA leave period, such as 
cost of living increases. Pay increases 
conditioned upon seniority, length of 
service, or work performed would not 
have to be granted unless it is the 
employer’s policy or practice to do so 
with respect to other employees on 
‘‘leave without pay.’’ In such case, any 
pay increase would be granted based on 
the employee’s seniority, length of 
service, work performed, etc., excluding 
the period of unpaid FMLA leave. An 
employee is entitled to be restored to a 
position with the same or equivalent 
pay premiums, such as a shift 
differential. If an employee departed 
from a position averaging ten hours of 
overtime (and corresponding overtime 
pay) each week, an employee is 
ordinarily entitled to such a position on 
return from FMLA leave. 

(2) Equivalent pay includes any bonus 

or payment, whether it is discretionary 
or non-discretionary, made to 
employees consistent with the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. However, if a bonus or other 
payment is based on the achievement of 
a specified goal such as hours worked, 
products sold or perfect attendance, and 
the employee has not met the goal due 
to FMLA leave, then the payment may 
be denied, unless otherwise paid to 
employees on an equivalent non-FMLA 
leave status. For example, if an 
employee who used paid vacation leave 
for a non-FMLA purpose would receive 
the payment, then the employee who 
used vacation leave for an FMLA- 
protected purpose also must receive the 
payment. 

(d) Equivalent benefits. ‘‘Benefits’’ 
include all benefits provided or made 
available to employees by an employer, 
including group life insurance, health 
insurance, disability insurance, sick 
leave, annual leave, educational 
benefits, and pensions, regardless of 
whether such benefits are provided by 
a practice or written policy of an 
employer through an employee benefit 
plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1002(3). 

(1) At the end of an employee’s FMLA 

leave, benefits must be resumed in the 
same manner and at the same levels as 
provided when the leave began, and 
subject to any changes in benefit levels 
that may have taken place during the

period of FMLA leave affecting the 
entire workforce, unless otherwise 
elected by the employee. Upon return 
from FMLA leave, an employee cannot 
be required to requalify for any benefits 
the employee enjoyed before FMLA 
leave began (including family or 
dependent coverages). For example, if 
an employee was covered by a life 
insurance policy before taking leave but 
is not covered or coverage lapses during 
the period of unpaid FMLA leave, the 
employee cannot be required to meet 
any qualifications, such as taking a 
physical examination, in order to 
requalify for life insurance upon return 
from leave. Accordingly, some 
employers may find it necessary to 
modify life insurance and other benefits 
programs in order to restore employees 
to equivalent benefits upon return from 
FMLA leave, make arrangements for 
continued payment of costs to maintain 
such benefits during unpaid FMLA 
leave, or pay these costs subject to 
recovery from the employee on return 
from leave. See § 825.213(b). 

(2) An employee may, but is not 
entitled to, accrue any additional 
benefits or seniority during unpaid 
FMLA leave. Benefits accrued at the 
time leave began, however, (e.g., paid 
vacation, sick or personal leave to the 
extent not substituted for FMLA leave) 
must be available to an employee upon 
return from leave. 

(3) If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, 

an employee desires to continue life 
insurance, disability insurance, or other 
types of benefits for which he or she 
typically pays, the employer is required 
to follow established policies or 
practices for continuing such benefits 
for other instances of leave without pay. 
If the employer has no established 
policy, the employee and the employer 
are encouraged to agree upon 
arrangements before FMLA leave begins. 
(4) With respect to pension and other 
retirement plans, any period of unpaid 
FMLA leave shall not be treated as or 
counted toward a break in service for 
purposes of vesting and eligibility to 
participate. Also, if the plan requires an 
employee to be employed on a specific 
date in order to be credited with a year 
of service for vesting, contributions or 
participation purposes, an employee on 
unpaid FMLA leave on that date shall 
be deemed to have been employed on 
that date. However, unpaid FMLA leave 
periods need not be treated as credited 
service for purposes of benefit accrual, 
vesting and eligibility to participate. 

(5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave 
are to be treated as if they continued to 
work for purposes of changes to benefit 
plans. They are entitled to changes in 
benefits plans, except those which may

be dependent upon seniority or accrual 
during the leave period, immediately 
upon return from leave or to the same 
extent they would have qualified if no 
leave had been taken. For example if the 
benefit plan is predicated on a pre- 
established number of hours worked 
each year and the employee does not 
have sufficient hours as a result of 
taking unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit 
is lost. (In this regard, § 825.209 
addresses health benefits.) 

(e) Other issues related to equivalent 

terms and conditions of employment. 
An equivalent position must have 
substantially similar duties, conditions, 
responsibilities, privileges and status as 
the employee’s original position. 

(1) The employee must be reinstated 

to the same or a geographically 
proximate worksite (i.e., one that does 
not involve a significant increase in 
commuting time or distance) from 
where the employee had previously 
been employed. If the employee’s 
original worksite has been closed, the 
employee is entitled to the same rights 
as if the employee had not been on leave 
when the worksite closed. For example, 
if an employer transfers all employees 
from a closed worksite to a new 
worksite in a different city, the 
employee on leave is also entitled to 
transfer under the same conditions as if 
he or she had continued to be 
employed. 

(2) The employee is ordinarily 

entitled to return to the same shift or the 
same or an equivalent work schedule. 

(3) The employee must have the same 

or an equivalent opportunity for 
bonuses, profit-sharing, and other 
similar discretionary and non- 
discretionary payments. 

(4) FMLA does not prohibit an 

employer from accommodating an 
employee’s request to be restored to a 
different shift, schedule, or position 
which better suits the employee’s 
personal needs on return from leave, or 
to offer a promotion to a better position. 
However, an employee cannot be 
induced by the employer to accept a 
different position against the employee’s 
wishes. 

(f) De minimis exception. The 
requirement that an employee be 
restored to the same or equivalent job 
with the same or equivalent pay, 
benefits, and terms and conditions of 
employment does not extend to de 
minimis, intangible, or unmeasurable 
aspects of the job. 

§ 825.216 Limitations on an employee’s 
right to reinstatement. 

(a) An employee has no greater right 

to reinstatement or to other benefits and 
conditions of employment than if the 

employee had been continuously 
employed during the FMLA leave 
period. An employer must be able to 
show that an employee would not 
otherwise have been employed at the 
time reinstatement is requested in order 
to deny restoration to employment. For 
example: 

(1) If an employee is laid off during 
the course of taking FMLA leave and 
employment is terminated, the 
employer’s responsibility to continue 
FMLA leave, maintain group health 
plan benefits and restore the employee 
cease at the time the employee is laid 
off, provided the employer has no 
continuing obligations under a 
collective bargaining agreement or 
otherwise. An employer would have the 
burden of proving that an employee 
would have been laid off during the 
FMLA leave period and, therefore, 
would not be entitled to restoration. 
Restoration to a job slated for lay-off 
when the employee’s original position is 
not would not meet the requirements of 
an equivalent position. 

(2) If a shift has been eliminated, or 

overtime has been decreased, an 
employee would not be entitled to 
return to work that shift or the original 
overtime hours upon restoration. 
However, if a position on, for example, 
a night shift has been filled by another 
employee, the employee is entitled to 
return to the same shift on which 
employed before taking FMLA leave. 
(3) If an employee was hired for a 

specific term or only to perform work on 
a discrete project, the employer has no 
obligation to restore the employee if the 
employment term or project is over and 
the employer would not otherwise have 
continued to employ the employee. On 
the other hand, if an employee was 
hired to perform work on a contract, and 
after that contract period the contract 
was awarded to another contractor, the 
successor contractor may be required to 
restore the employee if it is a successor 
employer. See § 825.107. 

(b) In addition to the circumstances 

explained above, an employer may deny 
job restoration to salaried eligible 
employees (‘‘key employees,’’ as defined 
in § 825.217(c)), if such denial is 
necessary to prevent substantial and 
grievous economic injury to the 
operations of the employer; or may 
delay restoration to an employee who 
fails to provide a fitness for duty 
certificate to return to work under the 
conditions described in § 825.310. 
(c) If the employee is unable to 

perform an essential function of the 
position because of a physical or mental 
condition, including the continuation of 
a serious health condition or an injury 
or illness also covered by workers’

compensation, the employee has no 
right to restoration to another position 
under the FMLA. However, the 
employer’s obligations may be governed 
by the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA). See § 825.702, State leave laws, 
or workers’ compensation laws. 

(d) An employee who fraudulently 

obtains FMLA leave from an employer 
is not protected by FMLA’s job 
restoration or maintenance of health 
benefits provisions. 

(e) If the employer has a uniformly- 

applied policy governing outside or 
supplemental employment, such a 
policy may continue to apply to an 
employee while on FMLA leave. An 
employer which does not have such a 
policy may not deny benefits to which 
an employee is entitled under FMLA on 
this basis unless the FMLA leave was 
fraudulently obtained as in paragraph 
(d) of this section. 

§ 825.217 Key employee, general rule. 
(a) A ‘‘key employee’’ is a salaried 

FMLA-eligible employee who is among 
the highest paid 10 percent of all the 
employees employed by the employer 
within 75 miles of the employee’s 
worksite. 

(b) The term ‘‘salaried’’ means ‘‘paid 
on a salary basis,’’ as defined in 29 CFR 
541.602. This is the Department of 
Labor regulation defining employees 
who may qualify as exempt from the 
minimum wage and overtime 
requirements of the FLSA as executive, 
administrative, professional, and 
computer employees. 

(c) A ‘‘key employee’’ must be 

‘‘among the highest paid 10 percent’’ of 
all the employees—both salaried and 
non-salaried, eligible and ineligible— 
who are employed by the employer 
within 75 miles of the worksite. 

(1) In determining which employees 
are among the highest paid 10 percent, 
year-to-date earnings are divided by 
weeks worked by the employee 
(including weeks in which paid leave 
was taken). Earnings include wages, 
premium pay, incentive pay, and non- 
discretionary and discretionary bonuses. 
Earnings do not include incentives 
whose value is determined at some 
future date, e.g., stock options, or 
benefits or perquisites. 

(2) The determination of whether a 

salaried employee is among the highest 
paid 10 percent shall be made at the 
time the employee gives notice of the 
need for leave. No more than 10 percent 
of the employer’s employees within 75 
miles of the worksite may be ‘‘key 
employees.’’

§ 825.218 Substantial and grievous 
economic injury. 

(a) In order to deny restoration to a 

key employee, an employer must 
determine that the restoration of the 
employee to employment will cause 
‘‘substantial and grievous economic 
injury’’ to the operations of the 
employer, not whether the absence of 
the employee will cause such 
substantial and grievous injury. 
(b) An employer may take into 
account its ability to replace on a 
temporary basis (or temporarily do 
without) the employee on FMLA leave. 
If permanent replacement is 
unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating 
the employee can be considered in 
evaluating whether substantial and 
grievous economic injury will occur 
from restoration; in other words, the 
effect on the operations of the company 
of reinstating the employee in an 
equivalent position. 

(c) A precise test cannot be set for the 

level of hardship or injury to the 
employer which must be sustained. If 
the reinstatement of a ‘‘key employee’’ 
threatens the economic viability of the 
firm, that would constitute ‘‘substantial 
and grievous economic injury.’’ A lesser 
injury which causes substantial, long- 
term economic injury would also be 
sufficient. Minor inconveniences and 
costs that the employer would 
experience in the normal course of 
doing business would certainly not 
constitute ‘‘substantial and grievous 
economic injury.’’ 

(d) FMLA’s ‘‘substantial and grievous 

economic injury’’ standard is different 
from and more stringent than the 
‘‘undue hardship’’ test under the ADA 
(see also § 825.702). 

§ 825.219 Rights of a key employee. 

(a) An employer who believes that 
reinstatement may be denied to a key 
employee, must give written notice to 
the employee at the time the employee 
gives notice of the need for FMLA leave 
(or when FMLA leave commences, if 
earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key 
employee. At the same time, the 
employer must also fully inform the 
employee of the potential consequences 
with respect to reinstatement and 
maintenance of health benefits if the 
employer should determine that 
substantial and grievous economic 
injury to the employer’s operations will 
result if the employee is reinstated from 
FMLA leave. If such notice cannot be 
given immediately because of the need 
to determine whether the employee is a 
key employee, it shall be given as soon 
as practicable after being notified of a 
need for leave (or the commencement of 
leave, if earlier). It is expected that in 

most circumstances there will be no 
desire that an employee be denied 
restoration after FMLA leave and, 
therefore, there would be no need to 
provide such notice. However, an 
employer who fails to provide such 
timely notice will lose its right to deny 
restoration even if substantial and 
grievous economic injury will result 
from reinstatement. 

(b) As soon as an employer makes a 
good faith determination, based on the 
facts available, that substantial and 
grievous economic injury to its 
operations will result if a key employee 
who has given notice of the need for 
FMLA leave or is using FMLA leave is 
reinstated, the employer shall notify the 
employee in writing of its 
determination, that it cannot deny 
FMLA leave, and that it intends to deny 
restoration to employment on 
completion of the FMLA leave. It is 
anticipated that an employer will 
ordinarily be able to give such notice 
prior to the employee starting leave. The 
employer must serve this notice either 
in person or by certified mail. This 
notice must explain the basis for the 
employer’s finding that substantial and 
grievous economic injury will result, 
and, if leave has commenced, must 
provide the employee a reasonable time 
in which to return to work, taking into 
account the circumstances, such as the 
length of the leave and the urgency of 
the need for the employee to return. 

(c) If an employee on leave does not 

return to work in response to the 
employer’s notification of intent to deny 
restoration, the employee continues to 
be entitled to maintenance of health 
benefits and the employer may not 
recover its cost of health benefit 
premiums. A key employee’s rights 
under FMLA continue unless and until 
the employee either gives notice that he 
or she no longer wishes to return to 
work, or the employer actually denies 
reinstatement at the conclusion of the 
leave period. 

(d) After notice to an employee has 

been given that substantial and grievous 
economic injury will result if the 
employee is reinstated to employment, 
an employee is still entitled to request 
reinstatement at the end of the leave 
period even if the employee did not 
return to work in response to the 
employer’s notice. The employer must 
then again determine whether there will 
be substantial and grievous economic 
injury from reinstatement, based on the 
facts at that time. If it is determined that 
substantial and grievous economic 
injury will result, the employer shall 
notify the employee in writing (in 
person or by certified mail) of the denial 
of restoration.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

§ 825.220 Protection for employees who 
request leave or otherwise assert FMLA 
rights. 

(a) The FMLA prohibits interference 

with an employee’s rights under the 
law, and with legal proceedings or 
inquiries relating to an employee’s 
rights. More specifically, the law 
contains the following employee 
protections: 

(1) An employer is prohibited from 

interfering with, restraining, or denying 
the exercise of (or attempts to exercise) 
any rights provided by the Act. 

(2) An employer is prohibited from 

discharging or in any other way 
discriminating against any person 
(whether or not an employee) for 
opposing or complaining about any 
unlawful practice under the Act. 
(3) All persons (whether or not 

employers) are prohibited from 
discharging or in any other way 
discriminating against any person 
(whether or not an employee) because 
that person has— 

(i) Filed any charge, or has instituted 

(or caused to be instituted) any 
proceeding under or related to this Act; 

(ii) Given, or is about to give, any 
information in connection with an 
inquiry or proceeding relating to a right 
under this Act; 

(iii) Testified, or is about to testify, in 
any inquiry or proceeding relating to a 
right under this Act. 

(b) Any violations of the Act or of 

these regulations constitute interfering 
with, restraining, or denying the 
exercise of rights provided by the Act. 
An employer may be liable for 
compensation and benefits lost by 
reason of the violation, for other actual 
monetary losses sustained as a direct 
result of the violation, and for 
appropriate equitable or other relief, 
including employment, reinstatement, 
promotion, or any other relief tailored to 
the harm suffered (see § 825.400(c)). 
‘‘Interfering with’’ the exercise of an 
employee’s rights would include, for 
example, not only refusing to authorize 
FMLA leave, but discouraging an 
employee from using such leave. It 
would also include manipulation by a 
covered employer to avoid 
responsibilities under FMLA, for 
example: 

(1) Transferring employees from one 
worksite to another for the purpose of 
reducing worksites, or to keep 
worksites, below the 50-employee 
threshold for employee eligibility under 
the Act; 

(2) Changing the essential functions of 

the job in order to preclude the taking 
of leave; 

(3) Reducing hours available to work 
in order to avoid employee eligibility.

(c) The Act’s prohibition against 

‘‘interference’’ prohibits an employer 
from discriminating or retaliating 
against an employee or prospective 
employee for having exercised or 
attempted to exercise FMLA rights. For 
example, if an employee on leave 
without pay would otherwise be 
entitled to full benefits (other than 
health benefits), the same benefits 
would be required to be provided to an 
employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By 
the same token, employers cannot use 
the taking of FMLA leave as a negative 
factor in employment actions, such as 
hiring, promotions or disciplinary 
actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted 
under ‘‘no fault’’ attendance policies. 
See § 825.215. 

(d) Employees cannot waive, nor may 
employers induce employees to waive, 
their prospective rights under FMLA. 
For example, employees (or their 
collective bargaining representatives) 
cannot ‘‘trade off’’ the right to take 
FMLA leave against some other benefit 
offered by the employer. This does not 
prevent an employee’s voluntary and 
uncoerced acceptance (not as a 
condition of employment) of a ‘‘light 
duty’’ assignment while recovering from 
a serious health condition (see 
§ 825.702(d)). Nor does it prevent the 
settlement of past FMLA claims by 
employees without the approval of the 
Department of Labor or a court. 

(e) Individuals, and not merely 

employees, are protected from 
retaliation for opposing (e.g., filing a 
complaint about) any practice which is 
unlawful under the Act. They are 
similarly protected if they oppose any 
practice which they reasonably believe 
to be a violation of the Act or 
regulations. 

Subpart C—Employee and Employer 
Rights and Obligations Under the Act 

§ 825.300 Employer notice requirements. 

(a) General notice. (1) Every employer 
covered by the FMLA is required to post 
and keep posted on its premises, in 
conspicuous places where employees 
are employed, a notice explaining the 
Act’s provisions and providing 
information concerning the procedures 
for filing complaints of violations of the 
Act with the Wage and Hour Division. 
The notice must be posted prominently 
where it can be readily seen by 
employees and applicants for 
employment. The poster and the text 
must be large enough to be easily read 
and contain fully legible text. Electronic 
posting is sufficient to meet this posting 
requirement as long as it otherwise 
meets the requirements of this 
subsection. An employer that willfully 

violates the posting requirement may be 
assessed a civil money penalty by the 
Wage and Hour Division not to exceed 
$110 for each separate offense. 

(2) Covered employers must post this 
general notice even if no employees are 
eligible for FMLA leave. 

(3) If an FMLA-covered employer has 

any eligible employees, it shall also 
provide this general notice to each 
employee by either including the notice 
in employee handbooks distributed to 
all employees or distributing a copy of 
the general notice to each employee at 
least annually (distribution may be by 
electronic mail). 

(4) To meet the general notice 

requirements of this section, employers 
may duplicate the text of the notice 
contained in Appendix C of this part. 
Where an employer’s workforce is 
comprised of a significant portion of 
workers who are not literate in English, 
the employer shall be responsible for 
providing the general notices in a 
language in which the employees are 
literate. Prototypes are available in 
several languages from the nearest office 
of the Wage and Hour Division or on the 
Internet at http:// 
www.wagehour.dol.gov. Employers 
furnishing FMLA notices to sensory 
impaired individuals must also comply 
with all applicable requirements under 
Federal or State law. 

(b) Eligibility notice. (1) When an 
employee requests FMLA leave, or 
when the employer acquires knowledge 
that an employee’s leave may be for an 
FMLA-qualifying condition, the 
employer must notify the employee 
within five business days of the 
employee’s eligibility to take FMLA 
leave and any additional requirements 
for qualifying for such leave. This 
eligibility notice shall provide 
information regarding the employee’s 
eligibility for FMLA leave, detail the 
specific responsibilities of the 
employee, and explain any 
consequences of a failure to meet these 
responsibilities. See § 825.110 for 
definition of an eligible employee. 

(2) Specifically, the eligibility notice 

must state whether the employee is 
eligible for FMLA leave and whether the 
employee still has FMLA leave available 
in the current applicable 12-month 
FMLA leave period. If the employee is 
not eligible for FMLA leave, the notice 
must state the reasons why the 
employee is not eligible, including as 
applicable that the employee has no 
remaining FMLA leave available in the 
12-month period, the number of months 
the employee has been employed by the 
employer, the number of hours of 
service during the 12-month period, and 
whether the employee is employed at a

worksite where 50 or more employees 
are employed by the employer within 75 
miles of that worksite. 

(3) If the employee is eligible for 
FMLA leave and has FMLA leave 
available, the eligibility notice must 
detail the specific expectations and 
obligations of the employee and explain 
any consequences of a failure to meet 
these obligations. Such specific notice 
must include, as appropriate: 

(i) That the leave may be designated 

and counted against the employee’s 
annual FMLA leave entitlement if 
qualifying (see §§ 825.300(c) and 
825.301); 

(ii) Any requirements for the 

employee to furnish medical 
certification of a serious health 
condition and the consequences of 
failing to do so (see § 825.305); 

(iii) The employee’s right to substitute 

paid leave, whether the employer will 
require the substitution of paid leave, 
the conditions related to any 
substitution, and the employee’s 
entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave 
if the employee does not comply; 

(iv) Any requirement for the employee 

to make any premium payments to 
maintain health benefits and the 
arrangements for making such payments 
(see § 825.210), and the possible 
consequences of failure to make such 
payments on a timely basis (i.e., the 
circumstances under which coverage 
may lapse); 

(v) Any requirement for the employee 
to present a fitness-for-duty certificate to 
be restored to employment and a list of 
the essential functions of the employee’s 
position if the employer will require 
that the fitness-for-duty certification 
address those functions (see § 825.310); 

(vi) The employee’s status as a ‘‘key 

employee’’ and the potential 
consequence that restoration may be 
denied following FMLA leave, 
explaining the conditions required for 
such denial (see § 825.218); 

(vii) The employee’s rights to 

maintenance of benefits during the 
FMLA leave and restoration to the same 
or an equivalent job upon return from 
FMLA leave (see §§ 825.214 and 
825.604); and 

(viii) The employee’s potential 

liability for payment of health insurance 
premiums paid by the employer during 
the employee’s unpaid FMLA leave if 
the employee fails to return to work 
after taking FMLA leave (see § 825.213). 
(4) The eligibility notice may include 

other information—e.g., whether the 
employer will require periodic reports 
of the employee’s status and intent to 
return to work—but is not required to 
do so. 

(5) The eligibility notice should be 

accompanied by any required medical 
certification form. 

(6) Except as provided in this section, 

the eligibility notice must be provided 
to the employee no less often than the 
first time in each six-month period that 
an employee gives notice of the need for 
FMLA leave (if FMLA leave is taken 
during the six-month period). The 
notice shall be given within a 
reasonable time after notice of the need 
for leave is given by the employee— 
within five business days if feasible. If 
leave has already begun, the notice 
should be mailed to the employee’s 
address of record. 

(7) If the specific information 

provided by the notice changes with 
respect to a subsequent period of FMLA 
leave during the six-month period, the 
employer shall, within five business 
days of receipt of the employee’s notice 
of need for leave, provide written notice 
referencing the prior notice and setting 
forth any of the information in the 
eligibility notice which has changed. 
For example, if the initial leave period 
was paid leave and the subsequent leave 
period would be unpaid leave, the 
employer may need to give notice of the 
arrangements for making premium 
payments. 

(8)(i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii) of this section, if the employer 
is requiring medical certification or a 
‘‘fitness-for-duty’’ report, written notice 
of the requirement shall be given with 
respect to each employee notice of a 
need for leave. 

(ii) Subsequent written notification 

shall not be required if the initial 
eligibility notice in the six-month 
period and the employer handbook or 
other written documents (if any) 
describing the employer’s leave policies, 
clearly provided that certification or a 
‘‘fitness-for-duty’’ report would be 
required (e.g., by stating that 
certification would be required in all 
cases, by stating that certification would 
be required in all cases in which leave 
of more than a specified number of days 
is taken, or by stating that a ‘‘fitness-for- 
duty’’ report would be required in all 
cases for back injuries for employees in 
a certain occupation). Where subsequent 
written notice is not required, at least 
oral notice shall be provided. See 
§ 825.305(a). 

(9) Employers are also expected to 
responsively answer questions from 
employees concerning their rights and 
responsibilities under the FMLA. 

(10) A prototype eligibility notice is 
contained in Appendix D of this part; 
the prototype may be obtained from 
local offices of the Wage and Hour 
Division or from the Internet at http:// 

www.wagehour.dol.gov. Employers may 
adapt the prototype notice as 
appropriate to meet these notice 
requirements. 

(c) Designation notice. (1) When the 

employer has enough information to 
determine whether the leave qualifies as 
FMLA leave (after receiving a medical 
certification, for example), the employer 
must notify the employee within five 
business days of making such 
determination whether the leave has or 
has not been designated as FMLA leave 
and the number of hours, days or weeks 
that will be counted against the 
employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. If 
it is not possible to provide the hours, 
days or weeks that will be counted 
against the employee’s FMLA leave 
entitlement (such as in the case of 
unforeseeable intermittent leave), then 
such information must be provided 
every 30 days to the employee if leave 
is taken during the prior 30-day period. 
If the employer requires paid leave to be 
substituted for unpaid leave, or that 
paid leave taken under an existing leave 
plan be counted as FMLA leave, this 
designation also must be made at the 
time of the FMLA designation. 

(2) This designation notice must be in 

writing, but may be in any form, 
including a notation on the employee’s 
pay stub. See § 825.301 for rules on 
leave designation. If the leave is not 
designated as FMLA leave because it 
does not meet the requirements of the 
Act, the notice to the employee that the 
leave is not designated as FMLA leave 
may be in the form of a simple written 
statement. 

(3) If the employer has sufficient 

information to designate the leave as 
FMLA leave immediately after receiving 
notice of the employee’s need for leave, 
an employer may provide an employee 
with the designation notice 
immediately, and also must provide the 
employee with the information required 
in the eligibility notice as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 

(4) A prototype designation notice is 

contained in Appendix E of this part; 
the prototype designation notice may be 
obtained from local offices of the Wage 
and Hour Division or from the Internet 
at www.wagehour.dol.gov. 

(d) Consequences of failing to provide 

notice. Failure to follow the notice 
requirements set forth in this section 
may constitute an interference with, 
restraint or denial of the exercise of an 
employee’s FMLA rights. An employer 
may be liable for compensation and 
benefits lost by reason of the violation, 
for other actual monetary losses 
sustained as a direct result of the 
violation, and for appropriate equitable 
or other relief, including employment,

reinstatement, promotion, or any other 
relief tailored to the harm suffered (see 
§ 825.400(c)). 

§ 825.301 Employer designation of FMLA 
leave. 

(a) Employer responsibilities. In all 

circumstances, it is the employer’s 
responsibility to designate leave, paid or 
unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying, and to give 
notice of the designation to the 
employee as provided in § 825.300. In 
the case of intermittent leave or leave on 
a reduced schedule, only one such 
notice is required unless the 
circumstances regarding the leave have 
changed. The employer’s designation 
decision must be based only on 
information received from the employee 
or the employee’s spokesperson (e.g., if 
the employee is incapacitated, the 
employee’s spouse, adult child, parent, 
doctor, etc., may provide notice to the 
employer of the need to take FMLA 
leave). In any circumstance where the 
employer does not have sufficient 
information about the reason for an 
employee’s use of leave, the employer 
should inquire further of the employee 
or the spokesperson to ascertain 
whether paid leave is potentially FMLA- 
qualifying. Once the employer has 
acquired knowledge that the leave is 
being taken for an FMLA required 
reason, the employer must notify the 
employee within five business days, 
absent extenuating circumstances, that 
the leave is designated and will be 
counted as FMLA leave. 

(b) Employee responsibilities. As 

noted in §§ 825.302(c) and 825.303(b), 
an employee giving notice of the need 
for FMLA leave does not need to 
expressly assert rights under the Act or 
even mention the FMLA to meet his or 
her obligation to provide notice, though 
the employee would need to state a 
qualifying reason for the needed leave 
and otherwise satisfy the notice 
requirements set forth in § 825.302 or 
§ 825.303 depending on whether the 
need for leave is foreseeable or 
unforeseeable. An employee giving 
notice of the need for FMLA leave must 
explain the reasons for the needed leave 
so as to allow the employer to determine 
that the leave qualifies under the Act. If 
the employee fails to explain the 
reasons, leave may be denied. In many 
cases, in explaining the reasons for a 
request to use paid leave, especially 
when the need for the leave was 
unexpected or unforeseen, an employee 
will provide sufficient information for 
the employer to designate the paid leave 
as FMLA leave. An employee using 
accrued paid leave, especially vacation 
or personal leave, may in some cases not 
spontaneously explain the reasons or

their plans for using their accrued leave. 
An employee requesting or notifying the 
employer of an intent to use accrued 
paid leave, even if for a purpose covered 
by FMLA, would not need to assert such 
right either. However, if an employee 
requesting to use paid leave for an 
FMLA-qualifying purpose does not 
explain the reason for the leave— 
consistent with the employer’s 
established policy or practice—and the 
employer denies the employee’s request, 
the employee will need to provide 
sufficient information to establish an 
FMLA-qualifying reason for the needed 
leave so that the employer is aware of 
the employee’s entitlement (i.e., that the 
leave may not be denied) and, then, may 
designate that the paid leave be 
appropriately counted against 
(substituted for) the employee’s 12-week 
entitlement. Similarly, an employee 
using accrued paid vacation leave who 
seeks an extension of unpaid leave for 
an FMLA-qualifying purpose will need 
to state the reason. If this is due to an 
event which occurred during the period 
of paid leave, the employer may count 
the leave used after the FMLA- 
qualifying event against the employee’s 
12-week entitlement. 

(c) Disputes. If there is a dispute 

between an employer and an employee 
as to whether paid leave qualifies as 
FMLA leave, it should be resolved 
through discussions between the 
employee and the employer. Such 
discussions and the decision must be 
documented. 

(d) Retroactive designation. If an 

employer does not designate leave as 
required by § 825.300, the employer 
may retroactively designate leave as 
FMLA leave with appropriate notice to 
the employee as required by § 825.300 
provided that the employer’s failure to 
timely designate leave does not cause 
harm or injury to the employee. In all 
cases where leave would qualify for 
FMLA protections, an employer and an 
employee can mutually agree that leave 
be retroactively designated as FMLA 
leave. 

(e) Remedies. If an employer’s failure 
to timely designate leave in accordance 
with § 825.300 causes the employee to 
suffer harm, it may constitute an 
interference with, restraint of or denial 
of the exercise of an employee’s FMLA 
rights. An employer may be liable for 
compensation and benefits lost by 
reason of the violation, for other actual 
monetary losses sustained as a direct 
result of the violation, and for 
appropriate equitable or other relief, 
including employment, reinstatement, 
promotion, or any other relief tailored to 
the harm suffered (see § 825.400(c)). For 
example, if an employer that was put on 

notice that an employee needed FMLA 
leave failed to designate the leave 
properly, but the employee’s own 
serious health condition prevented the 
employee from returning to work during 
that time period regardless of the 
designation, an employee may not be 
able to show that the employee suffered 
harm as a result of the employer’s 
actions. However, if an employee took 
leave to provide care for a son or 
daughter with a serious health condition 
believing it would not count toward the 
employee’s FMLA entitlement, and the 
employee planned to later use that 
FMLA leave to provide care for a spouse 
who would need assistance when 
recovering from surgery planned for a 
later date, the employee may be able to 
show that harm has occurred as a result 
of the employer’s failure to designate 
properly. The employee might establish 
this by showing that he or she would 
have arranged for an alternative 
caregiver for the seriously-ill son or 
daughter if the leave had been 
designated timely. 

§ 825.302 Employee notice requirements 
for foreseeable FMLA leave. 

(a) Timing of notice. An employee 

must provide the employer at least 30 
days’ advance notice before FMLA leave 
is to begin if the need for the leave is 
foreseeable based on an expected birth, 
placement for adoption or foster care, or 
planned medical treatment for a serious 
health condition of the employee or of 
a family member. If 30 days notice is not 
practicable, such as because of a lack of 
knowledge of approximately when leave 
will be required to begin, a change in 
circumstances, or a medical emergency, 
notice must be given as soon as 
practicable. For example, an employee’s 
health condition may require leave to 
commence earlier than anticipated 
before the birth of a child. Similarly, 
little opportunity for notice may be 
given before placement for adoption. 
Whether the leave is to be continuous or 
is to be taken intermittently or on a 
reduced schedule basis, notice need 
only be given one time, but the 
employee shall advise the employer as 
soon as practicable if dates of scheduled 
leave change or are extended, or were 
initially unknown. In those cases where 
the employee does not provide at least 
30 days notice of foreseeable leave, the 
employee shall explain the reasons why 
such notice was not practicable upon a 
request from the employer for such 
information. 

(b) As soon as practicable means as 

soon as both possible and practical, 
taking into account all of the facts and 
circumstances in the individual case. 
For example, where an employee learns

during the work day on Monday that a 
scheduled doctor appointment has been 
rescheduled from Friday to Wednesday 
of the same week, it would ordinarily be 
practicable for the employee to provide 
notice of the schedule change to the 
employer before the end of the work 
day. If the employee did not learn of the 
change in the scheduled appointment 
until after work hours, the employee 
should be able to provide the employer 
with notice the next business day. 

(c) Content of notice. An employee 

shall provide at least verbal notice 
sufficient to make the employer aware 
that the employee needs FMLA- 
qualifying leave, and the anticipated 
timing and duration of the leave. The 
employee need not expressly assert 
rights under the FMLA or even mention 
the FMLA. The employee must provide 
sufficient information that indicates that 
a condition renders the employee 
unable to perform the functions of the 
job, or if the leave is for a family 
member, that the condition renders the 
family member unable to perform daily 
activities; the anticipated duration of 
the absence; and whether the employee 
or the employee’s family member 
intends to visit a health care provider or 
has a condition for which the employee 
or the employee’s family member is 
under the continuing care of a health 
care provider. The employer should 
inquire further of the employee if it is 
necessary to have more information 
about whether FMLA leave is being 
sought by the employee, and obtain the 
necessary details of the leave to be 
taken. In the case of medical conditions, 
the employer may find it necessary to 
inquire further to determine if the leave 
is because of a serious health condition 
and may request medical certification to 
support the need for such leave (see 
§ 825.305). An employee has an 
obligation to respond to an employer’s 
questions designed to determine 
whether an absence is potentially 
FMLA-qualifying. Failure to respond to 
reasonable employer inquiries regarding 
the leave request may result in denial of 
FMLA protection if the employer is 
unable to determine whether the leave 
is FMLA-qualifying. 

(d) Complying with employer policy. 
An employer may require an employee 
to comply with the employer’s usual 
and customary notice and procedural 
requirements for requesting leave, 
absent unusual circumstances. For 
example, an employer may require that 
written notice set forth the reasons for 
the requested leave, the anticipated 
duration of the leave, and the 
anticipated start of the leave. An 
employee also may be required by an 
employer’s policy to contact a specific

individual. Unusual circumstances 
would include situations such as when 
an employee is unable to call in due to 
his/her medical condition and his/her 
spouse calls the direct supervisor to 
report the absence instead of calling the 
human resources department as 
required by the employer policy. Where 
an employee does not comply with the 
employer’s usual notice and procedural 
requirements, and no unusual 
circumstances justify the failure to 
comply, FMLA-protected leave may be 
delayed or denied. However, FMLA- 
protected leave may not be delayed or 
denied where the employer’s policy 
requires notice to be given sooner than 
set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
and the employee provides timely 
notice as set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section. 

(e) Scheduling planned medical 
treatment. When planning medical 
treatment, the employee must consult 
with the employer and make a 
reasonable effort to schedule the 
treatment so as not to disrupt unduly 
the employer’s operations, subject to the 
approval of the health care provider. 
Employees are ordinarily expected to 
consult with their employers prior to 
the scheduling of treatment in order to 
work out a treatment schedule which 
best suits the needs of both the 
employer and the employee. If an 
employee who provides notice of the 
need to take FMLA leave on an 
intermittent basis for planned medical 
treatment neglects to consult with the 
employer to make a reasonable effort to 
arrange the schedule of treatments so as 
not to unduly disrupt the employer’s 
operations, the employer may initiate 
discussions with the employee and 
require the employee to attempt to make 
such arrangements, subject to the 
approval of the health care provider. See 
§§ 825.203 and 825.205. 

(f) In the case of intermittent leave or 

leave on a reduced leave schedule 
which is medically necessary, an 
employee shall advise the employer, 
upon request, of the reasons why the 
intermittent/reduced leave schedule is 
necessary and of the schedule for 
treatment, if applicable. The employee 
and employer shall attempt to work out 
a schedule which meets the employee’s 
needs without unduly disrupting the 
employer’s operations, subject to the 
approval of the health care provider. 

(g) An employer may waive 

employees’ FMLA notice requirements. 

§ 825.303 Employee notice requirements 
for unforeseeable FMLA leave. 

(a) Timing of notice. When the 

approximate timing of the need for leave 
is not foreseeable, an employee must 

provide notice to the employer as soon 
as practicable under the facts and 
circumstances of the particular case. 
Where the need for leave is 
unforeseeable, it is expected that an 
employee will give notice to the 
employer promptly. Notice may be 
given by the employee’s spokesperson 
(e.g., spouse, adult family member or 
other responsible party) if the employee 
is unable to do so personally. For 
example, if an employee’s child has a 
severe asthma attack and the employee 
takes the child to the emergency room, 
the employee would not be required to 
leave his or her child in order to report 
the absence while the child is receiving 
emergency treatment. However, if the 
child’s asthma attack required only the 
use of an inhaler at home followed by 
period of rest, the employee would be 
expected to call the employer promptly 
after ensuring the child has used the 
inhaler. 

(b) Content of notice. An employee 

shall provide sufficient information for 
an employer to reasonably determine 
whether the FMLA may apply to the 
leave request. The employee need not 
expressly assert rights under the FMLA 
or even mention the FMLA. The 
employee must provide sufficient 
information that indicates that a 
condition renders the employee unable 
to perform the functions of the job, or 
if the leave is for a family member, that 
the condition renders the family 
member unable to perform daily 
activities; the anticipated duration of 
the absence; and whether the employee 
or the employee’s family member 
intends to visit a health care provider or 
has a condition for which the employee 
or the employee’s family member is 
under the continuing care of a health 
care provider. Calling in ‘‘sick’’ without 
providing more information will not be 
considered sufficient notice to trigger an 
employer’s obligations under the Act. 
The employer will be expected to obtain 
any additional required information 
through informal means. An employee 
has an obligation to respond to an 
employer’s questions designed to 
determine whether an absence is 
potentially FMLA-qualifying. Failure to 
respond to reasonable employer 
inquiries regarding the leave request 
may result in denial of FMLA protection 
if the employer is unable to determine 
whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying. 
(c) Complying with employer policy. 

When the need for leave is not 
foreseeable, an employee must comply 
with the employer’s usual and 
customary notice and procedural 
requirements for requesting leave, 
except when extraordinary 
circumstances exist. For example, an

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

employer may require employees to call 
a designated number or a specific 
individual to request leave. However, if 
an employee requires emergency 
medical treatment, he or she would not 
be required to follow the call-in 
procedure until his or her condition is 
stabilized and he or she has access to, 
and is able to use, a phone. FMLA- 
protected leave may not be delayed or 
denied where the employer’s policy 
requires notice to be given sooner than 
set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
and the employee provides timely 
notice as set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section. In the case of a medical 
emergency requiring leave because of an 
employee’s own serious health 
condition or to care for a family member 
with a serious health condition, written 
advance notice pursuant to an 
employer’s internal rules and 
procedures may not be required when 
FMLA leave is involved. 

§ 825.304 Employee failure to provide 
notice. 

(a) Waiver of notice. An employer 
may waive employees’ FMLA notice 
obligations or the employer’s own 
internal rules on leave notice 
requirements. If an employer does not 
waive the employee’s obligations under 
its internal leave rules, the employer 
may take appropriate action under its 
internal rules and procedures for failure 
to follow its usual and customary 
notification rules as long as the actions 
are taken in a manner that does not 
discriminate against employees taking 
FMLA leave and the rules are not 
inconsistent with § 825.303(a). 

(b) Foreseeable leave—30 days. When 
the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable 
at least 30 days in advance and an 
employee fails to give timely advance 
notice with no reasonable excuse, the 
employer may delay FMLA coverage 
until 30 days after the date the 
employee provides notice. The need for 
leave and the approximate date leave 
would be taken must have been clearly 
foreseeable to the employee 30 days in 
advance of the leave. For example, 
knowledge that an employee would 
receive a telephone call about the 
availability of a child for adoption at 
some unknown point in the future 
would not be sufficient to establish the 
leave was clearly foreseeable 30 days in 
advance. 

(c) Foreseeable leave—less than 30 

days. When the need for FMLA leave is 
foreseeable fewer than 30 days in 
advance and an employee fails to give 
notice as soon as practicable under the 
particular facts and circumstances, the 
extent to which an employer may delay 
FMLA coverage for leave depends on 

the facts of the particular case. For 
example, if an employee reasonably 
should have given the employer two 
weeks notice but instead only provided 
one week notice, then the employer may 
delay FMLA-protected leave for one 
week (thus, if the employer elects to 
delay FMLA coverage and the employee 
nonetheless takes leave one week after 
providing the notice (i.e., a week before 
the two week notice period has been 
met) the leave will not be FMLA- 
protected). 

(d) Unforeseeable leave. When the 
need for FMLA leave is unforeseeable 
and an employee fails to give notice in 
accordance with § 825.303, the extent to 
which an employer may delay FMLA 
coverage for leave depends on the facts 
of the particular case. For example, if it 
would have been practicable for an 
employee to have given the employer 
notice of the need for leave promptly, 
but instead the employee provided 
notice two days after the leave began, 
then the employer may delay FMLA 
coverage of the leave by two days. 

(e) Proper notice required. In all cases, 

in order for the onset of an employee’s 
FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack 
of required notice, it must be clear that 
the employee had actual notice of the 
FMLA notice requirements. This 
condition would be satisfied by the 
employer’s proper posting of the 
required notice at the worksite where 
the employee is employed and the 
employer’s provision of the required 
notice in either an employee handbook 
or annual distribution, as required by 
§ 825.300. 

§ 825.305 Medical certification, general 
rule. 

(a) General. An employer may require 
that an employee’s leave to care for the 
employee’s seriously ill spouse, son, 
daughter, or parent, or due to the 
employee’s own serious health 
condition that makes the employee 
unable to perform one or more of the 
essential functions of the employee’s 
position, be supported by a certification 
issued by the health care provider of the 
employee or the employee’s ill family 
member. An employer must give notice 
of a requirement for medical 
certification each time a certification is 
required; such notice must be written 
notice whenever required by 
§ 825.300(b). An employer’s oral request 
to an employee to furnish any 
subsequent medical certification is 
sufficient. 

(b) Timing. In most cases, the 
employer should request that an 
employee furnish certification from a 
health care provider at the time the 
employee gives notice of the need for

leave or within five business days 
thereafter, or, in the case of unforeseen 
leave, within five business days after the 
leave commences. The employer may 
request certification at some later date if 
the employer later has reason to 
question the appropriateness of the 
leave or its duration. The employee 
must provide the requested certification 
to the employer within the time frame 
requested by the employer (which must 
allow at least 15 calendar days after the 
employer’s request), unless it is not 
practicable under the particular 
circumstances to do so despite the 
employee’s diligent, good faith efforts. 

(c) Complete and sufficient 

certification. The employee must 
provide a complete and sufficient 
medical certification to the employer if 
required by the employer in accordance 
with § 825.306. The employer shall 
advise an employee whenever the 
employer finds a certification 
incomplete or insufficient, and shall 
state in writing what additional 
information is necessary to make the 
certification complete and sufficient. A 
certification is considered incomplete if 
the employer receives a certification, 
but one or more of the applicable entries 
have not been completed. A certification 
is considered insufficient if the 
employer receives a complete 
certification, but the information 
provided is vague, ambiguous or non- 
responsive. The employer must provide 
the employee with seven calendar days 
(unless not practicable under the 
particular circumstances despite the 
employee’s diligent good faith efforts) to 
cure any such deficiency. If the 
deficiencies specified by the employer 
are not cured in the resubmitted 
certification, the employer may deny the 
taking of FMLA leave, in accordance 
with § 825.311. A certification that is 
not returned to the employer is not 
considered incomplete or insufficient, 
but constitutes a failure to provide 
certification. 

(d) Consequences. At the time the 
employer requests certification, the 
employer must also advise an employee 
of the anticipated consequences of an 
employee’s failure to provide adequate 
certification. If the employee fails to 
provide the employer with a complete 
and sufficient medical certification, 
despite the opportunity to cure the 
certification as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, or fails to provide any 
certification, the employer may deny the 
taking of FMLA leave, in accordance 
with § 825.311. It is the employee’s 
responsibility either to furnish a 
complete and sufficient certification or 
to furnish the health care provider 
providing the certification with any

necessary authorization from the 
employee or the employee’s family 
member in order for the health care 
provider to release a complete and 
sufficient certification to the employer 
to support the employee’s FMLA 
request. This provision will apply in 
any case where an employer requests a 
certification permitted by these 
regulations, whether it is the initial 
certification, a recertification, a second 
or third opinion, or a fitness for duty 
certificate, including any clarifications 
necessary to determine if such 
certifications are authentic and 
sufficient. See §§ 825.306, 825.307, 
825.308, and 825.310. 

(e) Annual medical certification. 

Where the employee’s need for leave 
due to the employee’s own serious 
health condition, or the serious health 
condition of the employee’s spouse, son, 
daughter, or parent lasts beyond a single 
leave year (as defined in § 825.200), the 
employer may require the employee to 
provide a new medical certification in 
each subsequent leave year. 

§ 825.306 Content of medical certification. 

(a) Required information. An 

employer may require an employee to 
obtain a medical certification from a 
health care provider that sets forth the 
following information: 

(1) The name, address, telephone 

number, and fax number of the health 
care provider and type of medical 
practice, including pertinent 
specialization; 

(2) The approximate date on which 

the serious health condition 
commenced, and its probable duration; 

(3) A statement or description of 

appropriate medical facts regarding the 
patient’s health condition for which 
FMLA leave is requested. The medical 
facts must be sufficient to support the 
need for leave. Such medical facts may 
include information on symptoms, 
diagnosis, hospitalization, doctor visits, 
whether medication has been 
prescribed, any referrals for evaluation 
or treatment (physical therapy, for 
example), or any other regimen of 
continuing treatment; 

(4) If the employee is the patient, 

information sufficient to establish that 
the employee cannot perform the 
functions of the employee’s job, as well 
as the nature of any other work 
restrictions, and the likely duration of 
such inability (see § 825.123(b) and (c)); 
(5) If the patient is a qualified family 

member, information sufficient to 
establish that the family member is in 
need of care, as described in § 825.124, 
and an estimate of the frequency and 
duration of the leave required to care for 
the family member; 

(6) If an employee requests leave on 

an intermittent or reduced schedule 
basis for planned medical treatment of 
the employee or a qualified family 
member, information sufficient to 
establish the medical necessity for such 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave 
and an estimate of the dates and 
duration of such treatments and any 
periods of recovery; 

(7) If an employee requests leave on 

an intermittent or reduced schedule 
basis for the employee’s health 
condition, including pregnancy, that 
may result in unforeseeable episodes of 
incapacity, information sufficient to 
establish the medical necessity for such 
intermittent or reduced schedule leave 
and an estimate of the frequency and 
duration of the episodes of incapacity; 
and 

(8) If an employee requests leave on 

an intermittent or reduced schedule 
basis to care for a qualified family 
member, a statement that such leave is 
medically necessary to care for the 
family member, as described in 
§§ 825.124 and 825.203(b), which can 
include assisting in the family member’s 
recovery, and an estimate of the 
frequency and duration of the required 
leave. 

(b) DOL has developed an optional 
form (Form WH–380, as revised) for 
employees’ (or their family members’) 
use in obtaining medical certification, 
including second and third opinions, 
from health care providers that meets 
FMLA’s certification requirements. (See 
Appendix B to these regulations.) This 
optional form reflects certification 
requirements so as to permit the health 
care provider to furnish appropriate 
medical information within his or her 
knowledge. Form WH–380, as revised, 
or another form containing the same 
basic information, may be used by the 
employer; however, no information may 
be required beyond that specified in 
§§ 825.306, 825.307, and 825.308. In all 
instances the information on the form 
must relate only to the serious health 
condition for which the current need for 
leave exists. 

(c) If an employee is on FMLA leave 
running concurrently with a workers’ 
compensation absence, and the 
provisions of the workers’ compensation 
statute permit the employer or the 
employer’s representative to request 
additional information from the 
employee’s workers’ compensation 
health care provider, the FMLA does not 
prevent the employer from following the 
workers’ compensation provisions. 
Similarly, an employer may request 
additional information in accordance 
with a paid leave policy or disability 
plan that requires greater information to 

qualify for payments or benefits, 
provided that the employer informs the 
employee that the additional 
information only needs to be provided 
in connection with receipt of such 
payments or benefits. If the employee 
fails to provide the information required 
for receipt of such payments or benefits, 
the employee’s entitlement to take 
unpaid FMLA leave will not be affected. 
See § 825.207(a). 

(d) If an employee’s serious health 

condition may also be a disability 
within the meaning of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA), the FMLA 
does not prevent the employer from 
following the procedures for requesting 
medical information under the ADA. 

(e) While an employee may choose to 

comply with the certification 
requirement by providing the employer 
with an authorization release or waiver 
allowing the employer to communicate 
directly with the employee’s health care 
provider, the employee may not be 
required to provide such an 
authorization release or waiver. In all 
instances in which certification is 
requested, it is the employee’s 
responsibility to provide the employer 
with complete and sufficient 
certification and failure to do so may 
result in the denial of FMLA leave. See 
§ 825.305(d). 

§ 825.307 Authentication and clarification 
of medical certification. 

(a) Clarification and authentication. If 

an employee submits a complete and 
sufficient certification signed by the 
health care provider, the employer may 
not request additional information from 
the employee’s health care provider. 
However, the employer may contact the 
employee’s health care provider for 
purposes of clarification and 
authentication of the medical 
certification (whether initial 
certification or recertification) after the 
employer has given the employee an 
opportunity to cure any deficiencies as 
set forth in § 825.305(c). For purposes of 
these regulations, ‘‘authentication’’ 
means providing the health care 
provider with a copy of the certification 
and requesting verification that the 
information contained on the 
certification form was completed and/or 
authorized by the health care provider 
who signed the document; no additional 
medical information may be requested 
and the employee’s permission is not 
required. ‘‘Clarification’’ means 
contacting the health care provider to 
understand the handwriting on the 
medical certification or to understand 
the meaning of a response. Employers 
may not ask health care providers for 
additional information beyond that

7984 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

required by the certification form. 
Contact between the employer and the 
employee’s health care provider for 
purposes of clarification must comply 
with the requirements of the Health 
Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (‘‘HIPAA’’) Privacy 
Rule (see 45 CFR parts 160 and 164). If 
an employee chooses not to provide the 
employer with authorization allowing 
the employer to clarify the certification 
with the employee’s health care 
provider, and does not otherwise clarify 
the certification, the employer may deny 
the taking of FMLA leave if the 
certification is unclear. See § 825.305(d). 
It is the employee’s responsibility to 
provide the employer with a complete 
and sufficient certification or to provide 
the health care provider with sufficient 
authorization from the employee or the 
employee’s family member to clarify the 
certification so that it is complete and 
sufficient. 

(b) Second opinion. (1) An employer 
who has reason to doubt the validity of 
a medical certification may require the 
employee to obtain a second opinion at 
the employer’s expense. Pending receipt 
of the second (or third) medical opinion, 
the employee is provisionally entitled to 
the benefits of the Act, including 
maintenance of group health benefits. If 
the certifications do not ultimately 
establish the employee’s entitlement to 
FMLA leave, the leave shall not be 
designated as FMLA leave and may be 
treated as paid or unpaid leave under 
the employer’s established leave 
policies. In addition, the consequences 
set forth in § 825.305(d) will apply if the 
employee or the employee’s family 
member fails to authorize his or her 
health care provider to release all 
relevant medical information pertaining 
to the serious health condition at issue 
if requested by the health care provider 
designated to provide a second opinion 
in order to render a sufficient and 
complete second opinion. 

(2) The employer is permitted to 

designate the health care provider to 
furnish the second opinion, but the 
selected health care provider may not be 
employed on a regular basis by the 
employer. The employer may not 
regularly contract with or otherwise 
regularly utilize the services of the 
health care provider furnishing the 
second opinion unless the employer is 
located in an area where access to 
health care is extremely limited (e.g., a 
rural area where no more than one or 
two doctors practice in the relevant 
specialty in the vicinity). 

(c) Third opinion. If the opinions of 

the employee’s and the employer’s 
designated health care providers differ, 
the employer may require the employee 

to obtain certification from a third 
health care provider, again at the 
employer’s expense. This third opinion 
shall be final and binding. The third 
health care provider must be designated 
or approved jointly by the employer and 
the employee. The employer and the 
employee must each act in good faith to 
attempt to reach agreement on whom to 
select for the third opinion provider. If 
the employer does not attempt in good 
faith to reach agreement, the employer 
will be bound by the first certification. 
If the employee does not attempt in 
good faith to reach agreement, the 
employee will be bound by the second 
certification. For example, an employee 
who refuses to agree to see a doctor in 
the specialty in question may be failing 
to act in good faith. On the other hand, 
an employer that refuses to agree to any 
doctor on a list of specialists in the 
appropriate field provided by the 
employee and whom the employee has 
not previously consulted may be failing 
to act in good faith. In addition, the 
consequences set forth in § 825.305(d) 
will apply if the employee or the 
employee’s family member fails to 
authorize his or her health care provider 
to release all relevant medical 
information pertaining to the serious 
health condition at issue if requested by 
the health care provider designated to 
provide a third opinion in order to 
render a sufficient and complete third 
opinion. 

(d) Copies of opinions. The employer 

is required to provide the employee 
with a copy of the second and third 
medical opinions, where applicable, 
upon request by the employee. 
Requested copies are to be provided 
within five business days unless 
extenuating circumstances prevent such 
action. 

(e) Travel expenses. If the employer 

requires the employee to obtain either a 
second or third opinion, the employer 
must reimburse an employee or family 
member for any reasonable ‘‘out of 
pocket’’ travel expenses incurred to 
obtain the second and third medical 
opinions. The employer may not require 
the employee or family member to travel 
outside normal commuting distance for 
purposes of obtaining the second or 
third medical opinions except in very 
unusual circumstances. 

(f) Medical certification abroad. In 

circumstances when the employee or a 
family member is visiting in another 
country, or a family member resides in 
another country, and a serious health 
condition develops, the employer shall 
accept a medical certification as well as 
second and third opinions from a health 
care provider who practices in that 
country.

§ 825.308 Recertifications. 

(a) 30-day rule. Generally, an 

employer may request recertification no 
more often than every 30 days and only 
in connection with an absence by the 
employee. 

(b) More than 30 days. If the medical 

certification indicates that the minimum 
duration of incapacity is more than 30 
days, an employer must wait until that 
minimum duration expires before 
requesting a recertification, unless 
paragraph (c) applies. For example, if 
the medical certification states that an 
employee will be unable to work, 
whether continuously or on an 
intermittent basis, for 40 days, the 
employer must wait 40 days before 
requesting a recertification. In all cases, 
an employer may request a 
recertification every six months in 
connection with an absence by the 
employee. 

(c) Less than 30 days. An employer 

may request recertification in less than 
30 days if: 

(1) The employee requests an 

extension of leave; 

(2) Circumstances described by the 

previous certification have changed 
significantly (e.g., the duration or 
frequency of the absence, the nature or 
severity of the illness, complications). 
For example, if a medical certification 
stated that an employee would need 
leave for one to two days when the 
employee suffered a migraine headache 
and the employee’s absences for his/her 
last two migraines lasted four days each, 
then the increased duration of absence 
might constitute a significant change in 
circumstances allowing the employer to 
request a recertification in less than 30 
days. Likewise, if an employee had a 
pattern of using unscheduled FMLA 
leave for migraines in conjunction with 
his/her scheduled days off, then the 
timing of the absences also might 
constitute a significant change in 
circumstances sufficient for an 
employer to request a recertification 
more frequently than every 30 days; or 

(3) The employer receives information 

that casts doubt upon the employee’s 
stated reason for the absence or the 
continuing validity of the certification. 
For example, if an employee is on 
FMLA leave for four weeks due to the 
employee’s knee surgery, including 
recuperation, and the employee plays in 
company softball league games during 
the employee’s third week of FMLA 
leave, such information might be 
sufficient to cast doubt upon the 
continuing validity of the certification 
allowing the employer to request a 
recertification in less than 30 days. 
(d) Timing. The employee must 

provide the requested recertification to

the employer within the time frame 
requested by the employer (which must 
allow at least 15 calendar days after the 
employer’s request), unless it is not 
practicable under the particular 
circumstances to do so despite the 
employee’s diligent, good faith efforts. 

(e) Content. The employer may ask for 

the same information when obtaining 
recertification as that permitted for the 
original certification as set forth in 
§ 825.306. The employee has the same 
obligations to participate and cooperate 
(including providing a complete and 
sufficient certification or adequate 
authorization to the health care 
provider) in the recertification process 
as in the initial certification process. See 
§ 825.305(d). As part of the information 
allowed to be obtained on 
recertification, the employer may 
provide the health care provider with a 
record of the employee’s absence 
pattern and ask the health care provider 
if the serious health condition and need 
for leave is consistent with such a 
pattern. 

(f) Any recertification requested by 

the employer shall be at the employee’s 
expense unless the employer provides 
otherwise. No second or third opinion 
on recertification may be required. 

§ 825.309 Intent to return to work. 

(a) An employer may require an 
employee on FMLA leave to report 
periodically on the employee’s status 
and intent to return to work. The 
employer’s policy regarding such 
reports may not be discriminatory and 
must take into account all of the 
relevant facts and circumstances related 
to the individual employee’s leave 
situation. 

(b) If an employee gives unequivocal 

notice of intent not to return to work, 
the employer’s obligations under FMLA 
to maintain health benefits (subject to 
COBRA requirements) and to restore the 
employee cease. However, these 
obligations continue if an employee 
indicates he or she may be unable to 
return to work but expresses a 
continuing desire to do so. 

(c) It may be necessary for an 

employee to take more leave than 
originally anticipated. Conversely, an 
employee may discover after beginning 
leave that the circumstances have 
changed and the amount of leave 
originally anticipated is no longer 
necessary. An employee may not be 
required to take more FMLA leave than 
necessary to resolve the circumstance 
that precipitated the need for leave. In 
both of these situations, the employer 
may require that the employee provide 
the employer reasonable notice (i.e., 
within two business days) of the 

changed circumstances where 
foreseeable. The employer may also 
obtain information on such changed 
circumstances through requested status 
reports. 

§ 825.310 Fitness-for-duty certification. 

(a) As a condition of restoring an 
employee whose FMLA leave was 
occasioned by the employee’s own 
serious health condition that made the 
employee unable to perform the 
employee’s job, an employer may have 
a uniformly-applied policy or practice 
that requires all similarly-situated 
employees (i.e., same occupation, same 
serious health condition) who take leave 
for such conditions to obtain and 
present certification from the 
employee’s health care provider that the 
employee is able to resume work. The 
employee has the same obligations to 
participate and cooperate (including 
providing a complete and sufficient 
certification or providing sufficient 
authorization to the health care provider 
to provide the information directly to 
the employer) in the fitness-for-duty 
certification process as in the initial 
certification process. See § 825.305(d). 
(b) If State or local law or the terms 

of a collective bargaining agreement 
govern an employee’s return to work, 
those provisions shall be applied. 
Similarly, requirements under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
that any return-to-work physical be job- 
related and consistent with business 
necessity apply. For example, an 
attorney could not be required to submit 
to a medical examination or inquiry just 
because her leg had been amputated. 
The essential functions of an attorney’s 
job do not require use of both legs; 
therefore such an inquiry would not be 
job related. An employer may require a 
warehouse laborer, whose back 
impairment affects the ability to lift, to 
be examined by an orthopedist, but may 
not require this employee to submit to 
an HIV test where the test is not related 
to either the essential functions of his/ 
her job or to his/her impairment. 

(c) An employer may seek fitness-for- 

duty certification only with regard to 
the particular health condition that 
caused the employee’s need for FMLA 
leave. The certification from the 
employee’s health care provider must 
certify that the employee is able to 
resume work. An employer may require 
that the certification address the 
employee’s ability to perform the 
essential functions of the employee’s job 
by providing a list of essential functions 
with the eligibility notice required by 
§ 825.300(b). If the employer timely 
provides such a list, the employee’s 
health care provider must certify that

the employee can perform the identified 
essential functions of his or her job. 
Following the procedures set forth in 
§ 825.307(a), the employer may contact 
the employee’s health care provider for 
purposes of clarifying and 
authenticating the fitness-for-duty 
certification. Clarification may be 
requested only for the serious health 
condition for which FMLA leave was 
taken. The employer may not delay the 
employee’s return to work while contact 
with the health care provider is being 
made. 

(d) The cost of the certification shall 

be borne by the employee, and the 
employee is not entitled to be paid for 
the time or travel costs spent in 
acquiring the certification. 

(e) The eligibility notice required in 

§ 825.300(b) shall advise the employee if 
the employer will require fitness-for- 
duty certification to return to work. No 
second or third fitness-for-duty 
certification may be required. 

(f) An employer may delay restoration 

to employment until an employee 
submits a required fitness-for-duty 
certification unless the employer has 
failed to provide the notice required in 
paragraph (e) of this section. If an 
employer provides the notice required, 
an employee who does not provide a 
fitness-for-duty certification or request 
additional FMLA leave is no longer 
entitled to reinstatement under the 
FMLA. See § 825.311(d). 

(g) An employer is not entitled to 

certification of fitness to return to duty 
for each absence taken on an 
intermittent or reduced leave schedule 
as set forth in §§ 825.203 through 
825.205. However, an employer is 
entitled to a certification of fitness to 
return to duty for such absences up to 
once every 30 days if reasonable safety 
concerns exist regarding the employee’s 
ability to perform his or her duties, 
based on the serious health condition 
for which the employee took such leave. 
The employer may not terminate the 
employment of the employee while 
awaiting such a certification of fitness to 
return to duty for an intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave absence. 

§ 825.311 Failure to provide medical 
certification. 

(a) Foreseeable leave. In the case of 

foreseeable leave, if an employee fails to 
provide certification in a timely manner 
as required by § 825.305, then an 
employer may deny FMLA coverage 
until the required certification is 
provided. For example, if an employee 
has 15 days to provide a certification 
and does not provide the certification 
for 45 days without sufficient reason for 
the delay, the employer can deny FMLA

protections for the 30 day period 
following the expiration of the 15 day 
time period, if the employee takes leave 
during such period. 

(b) Unforeseeable leave. In the case of 

unforeseeable leave, an employer may 
deny FMLA coverage for the requested 
leave if the employee fails to provide a 
medical certification within 15 calendar 
days from receipt of the request for 
certification unless not practicable due 
to extenuating circumstances. For 
example, in the case of a medical 
emergency, it may not be practicable for 
an employee to provide the required 
certification within 15 calendar days. 
Absent such extenuating circumstances, 
if the employee fails to timely return the 
certification, the employer can deny 
FMLA protections for the leave 
following the expiration of the 15-day 
time period until a sufficient 
certification is provided. If the 
employee never produces the 
certification, the leave is not FMLA 
leave. 

(c) Recertification. An employee must 

provide recertification within the time 
requested by the employer (which must 
allow at least 15 calendar days after the 
request) or as soon as practicable under 
the particular facts and circumstances. If 
an employee fails to provide a 
recertification within a reasonable time 
under the particular facts and 
circumstances, then the employer may 
deny continuation of the FMLA leave 
protections until the employee produces 
a sufficient recertification. If the 
employee never produces the 
recertification, the leave is not FMLA 
leave. 

(d) Fitness-for-duty certification. 

When requested by the employer 
pursuant to a uniformly applied policy 
for similarly-situated employees, the 
employee must provide medical 
certification at the time the employee 
seeks reinstatement at the end of FMLA 
leave taken for the employee’s serious 
health condition, that the employee is 
fit for duty and able to return to work 
(see § 825.310(a)) if the employer has 
provided the required notice (see 
§ 825.300(c)); the employer may delay 
restoration until the certification is 
provided. In this situation, unless the 
employee provides either a fitness-for- 
duty certification or a new medical 
certification for a serious health 
condition at the time FMLA leave is 
concluded, the employee may be 
terminated. See also § 825.213(a)(3).

(1) Filing, or having another person 
file on his or her behalf, a complaint 
with the Secretary of Labor, or 

(2) Filing a private lawsuit pursuant 

to section 107 of FMLA. 

(b) If the employee files a private 
lawsuit, it must be filed within two 
years after the last action which the 
employee contends was in violation of 
the Act, or three years if the violation 
was willful. 

(c) If an employer has violated one or 

more provisions of FMLA, and if 
justified by the facts of a particular case, 
an employee may receive one or more 
of the following: wages, employment 
benefits, or other compensation denied 
or lost to such employee by reason of 
the violation; or, where no such tangible 
loss has occurred, such as when FMLA 
leave was unlawfully denied, any actual 
monetary loss sustained by the 
employee as a direct result of the 
violation, such as the cost of providing 
care, up to a sum equal to 12 weeks of 
wages for the employee. In addition, the 
employee may be entitled to interest on 
such sum, calculated at the prevailing 
rate. An amount equaling the preceding 
sums may also be awarded as liquidated 
damages unless such amount is reduced 
by the court because the violation was 
in good faith and the employer had 
reasonable grounds for believing the 
employer had not violated the Act. 
When appropriate, the employee may 
also obtain appropriate equitable relief, 
such as employment, reinstatement and 
promotion. When the employer is found 
in violation, the employee may recover 
a reasonable attorney’s fee, reasonable 
expert witness fees, and other costs of 
the action from the employer in 
addition to any judgment awarded by 
the court. 

§ 825.401 Filing a complaint with the 
Federal Government. 

(a) A complaint may be filed in 

person, by mail or by telephone, with 
the Wage and Hour Division, 
Employment Standards Administration, 
U.S. Department of Labor. A complaint 
may be filed at any local office of the 
Wage and Hour Division; the address 
and telephone number of local offices 
may be found in telephone directories 
or on the Department’s website. 
(b) A complaint filed with the 

Secretary of Labor should be filed 
within a reasonable time of when the 
employee discovers that his or her 
FMLA rights have been violated. In no 
event may a complaint be filed more 
than two years after the action which is 
alleged to be a violation of FMLA 
occurred, or three years in the case of 
a willful violation. 

(c) No particular form of complaint is 
required, except that a complaint must 
be reduced to writing and should 
include a full statement of the acts and/ 
or omissions, with pertinent dates, 
which are believed to constitute the 
violation. 

§ 825.402 Violations of the posting 
requirement. 

Section 825.300 describes the 

requirements for covered employers to 
post a notice for employees that 
explains the Act’s provisions. If a 
representative of the Department of 
Labor determines that an employer has 
committed a willful violation of this 
posting requirement, and that the 
imposition of a civil money penalty for 
such violation is appropriate, the 
representative may issue and serve a 
notice of penalty on such employer in 
person or by certified mail. Where 
service by certified mail is not accepted, 
notice shall be deemed received on the 
date of attempted delivery. Where 
service is not accepted, the notice may 
be served by regular mail. 

§ 825.403 Appealing the assessment of a 
penalty for willful violation of the posting 
requirement. 

(a) An employer may obtain a review 

of the assessment of penalty from the 
Wage and Hour Regional Administrator 
for the region in which the alleged 
violation(s) occurred. If the employer 
does not seek such a review or fails to 
do so in a timely manner, the notice of 
the penalty constitutes the final ruling 
of the Secretary of Labor. 

(b) To obtain review, an employer 

may file a petition with the Wage and 
Hour Regional Administrator for the 
region in which the alleged violations 
occurred. No particular form of petition 
for review is required, except that the 
petition must be in writing, should 
contain the legal and factual bases for 
the petition, and must be mailed to the 
Regional Administrator within 15 days 
of receipt of the notice of penalty. The 
employer may request an oral hearing 
which may be conducted by telephone. 

(c) The decision of the Regional 

Administrator constitutes the final order 
of the Secretary. 

§ 825.404 Consequences for an employer 
when not paying the penalty assessment 
after a final order is issued. 

The Regional Administrator may seek 
to recover the unpaid penalty pursuant 
to the Debt Collection Act (DCA), 31 
U.S.C. 3711 et seq., and, in addition to 
seeking recovery of the unpaid final 
order, may seek interest and penalties as 
provided under the DCA. The final 
order may also be referred to the 
Solicitor of Labor for collection. The

Subpart E—Recordkeeping 
Requirements 

§ 825.500 Recordkeeping requirements. 

(a) FMLA provides that covered 

employers shall make, keep, and 
preserve records pertaining to their 
obligations under the Act in accordance 
with the recordkeeping requirements of 
section 11(c) of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act (FLSA) and in accordance with 
these regulations. FMLA also restricts 
the authority of the Department of Labor 
to require any employer or plan, fund or 
program to submit books or records 
more than once during any 12-month 
period unless the Department has 
reasonable cause to believe a violation 
of the FMLA exists or the DOL is 
investigating a complaint. These 
regulations establish no requirement for 
the submission of any records unless 
specifically requested by a Departmental 
official. 

(b) No particular order or form of 

records is required. These regulations 
establish no requirement that any 
employer revise its computerized 
payroll or personnel records systems to 
comply. However, employers must keep 
the records specified by these 
regulations for no less than three years 
and make them available for inspection, 
copying, and transcription by 
representatives of the Department of 
Labor upon request. The records may be 
maintained and preserved on microfilm 
or other basic source document of an 
automated data processing memory 
provided that adequate projection or 
viewing equipment is available, that the 
reproductions are clear and identifiable 
by date or pay period, and that 
extensions or transcriptions of the 
information required herein can be and 
are made available upon request. 
Records kept in computer form must be 
made available for transcription or 
copying. 

(c) Covered employers who have 
eligible employees must maintain 
records that must disclose the following: 

(1) Basic payroll and identifying 

employee data, including name, 
address, and occupation; rate or basis of 
pay and terms of compensation; daily 
and weekly hours worked per pay 
period; additions to or deductions from 
wages; and total compensation paid. 

(2) Dates FMLA leave is taken by 

FMLA eligible employees (e.g., available 
from time records, requests for leave, 
etc., if so designated). Leave must be 
designated in records as FMLA leave;

benefits. 

(7) Records of any dispute between 

the employer and an eligible employee 
regarding designation of leave as FMLA 
leave, including any written statement 
from the employer or employee of the 
reasons for the designation and for the 
disagreement. 

(d) Covered employers with no 

eligible employees must maintain the 
records set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section. 

(e) Covered employers in a joint 

employment situation (see § 825.106) 
must keep all the records required by 
paragraph (c) of this section with 
respect to any primary employees, and 
must keep the records required by 
paragraph (c)(1) with respect to any 
secondary employees. 

(f) If FMLA-eligible employees are not 

leave so designated may not include 
leave required under State law or an 
employer plan which is not also covered 
by FMLA. 

(3) If FMLA leave is taken by eligible 

employees in increments of less than 
one full day, the hours of the leave. 
(4) Copies of employee notices of 

leave furnished to the employer under 
FMLA, if in writing, and copies of all 
eligibility notices given to employees as 
required under FMLA and these 
regulations (see § 825.300(b)). Copies 
may be maintained in employee 
personnel files. 

(5) Any documents (including written 

and electronic records) describing 
employee benefits or employer policies 
and practices regarding the taking of 
paid and unpaid leaves. 

(6) Premium payments of employee 

subject to FLSA’s recordkeeping 
regulations for purposes of minimum 
wage or overtime compliance (i.e., not 
covered by or exempt from FLSA), an 
employer need not keep a record of 
actual hours worked (as otherwise 
required under FLSA, 29 CFR 
516.2(a)(7)), provided that: 

(1) Eligibility for FMLA leave is 

presumed for any employee who has 
been employed for at least 12 months; 
and 

(2) With respect to employees who 

take FMLA leave intermittently or on a 
reduced leave schedule, the employer 
and employee agree on the employee’s 
normal schedule or average hours 
worked each week and reduce their 
agreement to a written record 
maintained in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section. 

(g) Records and documents relating to 
medical certifications, recertifications or 
medical histories of employees or 
employees’ family members, created for 
purposes of FMLA, shall be maintained 
as confidential medical records in 

separate files/records from the usual 
personnel files, and if ADA is also 
applicable, such records shall be 
maintained in conformance with ADA 
confidentiality requirements (see 29 
CFR 1630.14(c)(1)), except that: 

(1) Supervisors and managers may be 

informed regarding necessary 
restrictions on the work or duties of an 
employee and necessary 
accommodations; 

(2) First aid and safety personnel may 

be informed (when appropriate) if the 
employee’s physical or medical 
condition might require emergency 
treatment; and 

(3) Government officials investigating 

compliance with FMLA (or other 
pertinent law) shall be provided 
relevant information upon request. 

Subpart F—Special Rules Applicable 
to Employees of Schools 

§ 825.600 Special rules for school 
employees, definitions. 

(a) Certain special rules apply to 

employees of ‘‘local educational 
agencies,’’ including public school 
boards and elementary and secondary 
schools under their jurisdiction, and 
private elementary and secondary 
schools. The special rules do not apply 
to other kinds of educational 
institutions, such as colleges and 
universities, trade schools, and 
preschools. 

(b) Educational institutions are 

covered by FMLA (and these special 
rules) and the Act’s 50-employee 
coverage test does not apply. The usual 
requirements for employees to be 
‘‘eligible’’ do apply, however, including 
employment at a worksite where at least 
50 employees are employed within 75 
miles. For example, employees of a rural 
school would not be eligible for FMLA 
leave if the school has fewer than 50 
employees and there are no other 
schools under the jurisdiction of the 
same employer (usually, a school board) 
within 75 miles. 

(c) The special rules affect the taking 

of intermittent leave or leave on a 
reduced leave schedule, or leave near 
the end of an academic term (semester), 
by instructional employees. 
‘‘Instructional employees’’ are those 
whose principal function is to teach and 
instruct students in a class, a small 
group, or an individual setting. This 
term includes not only teachers, but also 
athletic coaches, driving instructors, 
and special education assistants such as 
signers for the hearing impaired. It does 
not include, and the special rules do not 
apply to, teacher assistants or aides who 
do not have as their principal job actual 
teaching or instructing, nor does it

include auxiliary personnel such as 
counselors, psychologists, or curriculum 
specialists. It also does not include 
cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, 
or bus drivers. 

(d) Special rules which apply to 

restoration to an equivalent position 
apply to all employees of local 
educational agencies. 

§ 825.601 Special rules for school 
employees, limitations on intermittent 
leave. 

(a) Leave taken for a period that ends 
with the school year and begins the next 
semester is leave taken consecutively 
rather than intermittently. The period 
during the summer vacation when the 
employee would not have been required 
to report for duty is not counted against 
the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. 
An instructional employee who is on 
FMLA leave at the end of the school 
year must be provided with any benefits 
over the summer vacation that 
employees would normally receive if 
they had been working at the end of the 
school year. 

(1) If an eligible instructional 

employee needs intermittent leave or 
leave on a reduced leave schedule to 
care for a family member, or for the 
employee’s own serious health 
condition, which is foreseeable based on 
planned medical treatment, and the 
employee would be on leave for more 
than 20 percent of the total number of 
working days over the period the leave 
would extend, the employer may 
require the employee to choose either 
to: 

(i) Take leave for a period or periods 

of a particular duration, not greater than 
the duration of the planned treatment; 
or 

(ii) Transfer temporarily to an 

available alternative position for which 
the employee is qualified, which has 
equivalent pay and benefits and which 
better accommodates recurring periods 
of leave than does the employee’s 
regular position. 

(2) These rules apply only to a leave 
involving more than 20 percent of the 
working days during the period over 
which the leave extends. For example, 
if an instructional employee who 
normally works five days each week 
needs to take two days of FMLA leave 
per week over a period of several weeks, 
the special rules would apply. 
Employees taking leave which 
constitutes 20 percent or less of the 
working days during the leave period 
would not be subject to transfer to an 
alternative position. ‘‘Periods of a 
particular duration’’ means a block, or 
blocks, of time beginning no earlier than 
the first day for which leave is needed

and ending no later than the last day on 
which leave is needed, and may include 
one uninterrupted period of leave. 

(b) If an instructional employee does 
not give required notice of foreseeable 
FMLA leave (see § 825.302) to be taken 
intermittently or on a reduced leave 
schedule, the employer may require the 
employee to take leave of a particular 
duration, or to transfer temporarily to an 
alternative position. Alternatively, the 
employer may require the employee to 
delay the taking of leave until the notice 
provision is met. 

§ 825.602 Special rules for school 
employees, limitations on leave near the 
end of an academic term. 

(a) There are also different rules for 

instructional employees who begin 
leave more than five weeks before the 
end of a term, less than five weeks 
before the end of a term, and less than 
three weeks before the end of a term. 
Regular rules apply except in 
circumstances when: 

(1) An instructional employee begins 

leave more than five weeks before the 
end of a term. The employer may 
require the employee to continue taking 
leave until the end of the term if— 

(i) The leave will last at least three 

weeks, and 

(ii) The employee would return to 

work during the three-week period 
before the end of the term. 

(2) The employee begins leave for a 

purpose other than the employee’s own 
serious health condition during the five- 
week period before the end of a term. 
The employer may require the employee 
to continue taking leave until the end of 
the term if — 

(i) The leave will last more than two 

weeks, and 

(ii) The employee would return to 

work during the two-week period before 
the end of the term. 

(3) The employee begins leave for a 

purpose other than the employee’s own 
serious health condition during the 
three-week period before the end of a 
term, and the leave will last more than 
five working days. The employer may 
require the employee to continue taking 
leave until the end of the term. 

(b) For purposes of these provisions, 

‘‘academic term’’ means the school 
semester, which typically ends near the 
end of the calendar year and the end of 
spring each school year. In no case may 
a school have more than two academic 
terms or semesters each year for 
purposes of FMLA. An example of leave 
falling within these provisions would be 
where an employee plans two weeks of 
leave to care for a family member which 
will begin three weeks before the end of 
the term. In that situation, the employer 

could require the employee to stay out 
on leave until the end of the term. 

§ 825.603 Special rules for school 
employees, duration of FMLA leave. 

(a) If an employee chooses to take 

leave for ‘‘periods of a particular 
duration’’ in the case of intermittent or 
reduced schedule leave, the entire 
period of leave taken will count as 
FMLA leave. 

(b) In the case of an employee who is 

required to take leave until the end of 
an academic term, only the period of 
leave until the employee is ready and 
able to return to work shall be charged 
against the employee’s FMLA leave 
entitlement. The employer has the 
option not to require the employee to 
stay on leave until the end of the school 
term. Therefore, any additional leave 
required by the employer to the end of 
the school term is not counted as FMLA 
leave; however, the employer shall be 
required to maintain the employee’s 
group health insurance and restore the 
employee to the same or equivalent job 
including other benefits at the 
conclusion of the leave. 

§ 825.604 Special rules for school 
employees, restoration to ‘‘an equivalent 
position.’’ 

The determination of how an 

employee is to be restored to ‘‘an 
equivalent position’’ upon return from 
FMLA leave will be made on the basis 
of ‘‘established school board policies 
and practices, private school policies 
and practices, and collective bargaining 
agreements.’’ The ‘‘established policies’’ 
and collective bargaining agreements 
used as a basis for restoration must be 
in writing, must be made known to the 
employee prior to the taking of FMLA 
leave, and must clearly explain the 
employee’s restoration rights upon 
return from leave. Any established 
policy which is used as the basis for 
restoration of an employee to ‘‘an 
equivalent position’’ must provide 
substantially the same protections as 
provided in the Act for reinstated 
employees. See § 825.215. In other 
words, the policy or collective 
bargaining agreement must provide for 
restoration to an ‘‘equivalent position’’ 
with equivalent employment benefits, 
pay, and other terms and conditions of 
employment. For example, an employee 
may not be restored to a position 
requiring additional licensure or 
certification.

7989 

Subpart G—Effect of Other Laws, 
Employer Practices, and Collective 
Bargaining Agreements on Employee 
Rights Under FMLA 

§ 825.700 Interaction with employer’s 
policies. 

(a) An employer must observe any 
employment benefit program or plan 
that provides greater family or medical 
leave rights to employees than the rights 
established by the FMLA. Conversely, 
the rights established by the Act may 
not be diminished by any employment 
benefit program or plan. For example, a 
provision of a CBA which provides for 
reinstatement to a position that is not 
equivalent because of seniority (e.g., 
provides lesser pay) is superseded by 
FMLA. If an employer provides greater 
unpaid family leave rights than are 
afforded by FMLA, the employer is not 
required to extend additional rights 
afforded by FMLA, such as maintenance 
of health benefits (other than through 
COBRA), to the additional leave period 
not covered by FMLA. 

(b) Nothing in this Act prevents an 

employer from amending existing leave 
and employee benefit programs, 
provided they comply with FMLA. 
However, nothing in the Act is intended 
to discourage employers from adopting 
or retaining more generous leave 
policies. 

§ 825.701 Interaction with State laws. 

(a) Nothing in FMLA supersedes any 

provision of State or local law that 
provides greater family or medical leave 
rights than those provided by FMLA. 
The Department of Labor will not, 
however, enforce State family or 
medical leave laws, and States may not 
enforce the FMLA. Employees are not 
required to designate whether the leave 
they are taking is FMLA leave or leave 
under State law, and an employer must 
comply with the appropriate 
(applicable) provisions of both. An 
employer covered by one law and not 
the other has to comply only with the 
law under which it is covered. 
Similarly, an employee eligible under 
only one law must receive benefits in 
accordance with that law. If leave 
qualifies for FMLA leave and leave 
under State law, the leave used counts 
against the employee’s entitlement 
under both laws. Examples of the 
interaction between FMLA and State 
laws include: 

(1) If State law provides 16 weeks of 

leave entitlement over two years, an 
employee would be entitled to take 16 
weeks one year under State law and 12 
weeks the next year under FMLA. 
Health benefits maintenance under 
FMLA would be applicable only to the

first 12 weeks of leave entitlement each 
year. If the employee took 12 weeks the 
first year, the employee would be 
entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks the 
second year under FMLA (not 16 
weeks). An employee would not be 
entitled to 28 weeks in one year. 

(2) If State law provides half-pay for 

employees temporarily disabled because 
of pregnancy for six weeks, the 
employee would be entitled to an 
additional six weeks of unpaid FMLA 
leave (or accrued paid leave). 

(3) A shorter notice period under 

State law must be allowed by the 
employer unless an employer has 
already provided, or the employee is 
requesting, more leave than required 
under State law. 

(4) If State law provides for only one 

medical certification, no additional 
certifications may be required by the 
employer unless the employer has 
already provided, or the employee is 
requesting, more leave than required 
under State law. 

(5) If State law provides six weeks of 
leave, which may include leave to care 
for a seriously-ill grandparent or a 
‘‘spouse equivalent,’’ and leave was 
used for that purpose, the employee is 
still entitled to 12 weeks of FMLA leave, 
as the leave used was provided for a 
purpose not covered by FMLA. If FMLA 
leave is used first for a purpose also 
provided under State law, and State 
leave has thereby been exhausted, the 
employer would not be required to 
provide additional leave to care for the 
grandparent or ‘‘spouse equivalent.’’ 

(6) If State law prohibits mandatory 

leave beyond the actual period of 
pregnancy disability, an instructional 
employee of an educational agency 
subject to special FMLA rules may not 
be required to remain on leave until the 
end of the academic term, as permitted 
by FMLA under certain circumstances. 
(See Subpart F of this part.) 

(b) [Reserved] 

§ 825.702 Interaction with Federal and 
State anti-discrimination laws. 

(a) Nothing in FMLA modifies or 

affects any Federal or State law 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis 
of race, religion, color, national origin, 
sex, age, or disability (e.g., Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended 
by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act). 
FMLA’s legislative history explains that 
FMLA is ‘‘not intended to modify or 
affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 
amended, the regulations concerning 
employment which have been 
promulgated pursuant to that statute, or 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990, or the regulations issued under 
that act. Thus, the leave provisions of 

the [FMLA] are wholly distinct from the 
reasonable accommodation obligations 
of employers covered under the [ADA], 
employers who receive Federal financial 
assistance, employers who contract with 
the Federal government, or the Federal 
government itself. The purpose of the 
FMLA is to make leave available to 
eligible employees and employers 
within its coverage, and not to limit 
already existing rights and protection.’’ 
S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 38 (1993). An 
employer must therefore provide leave 
under whichever statutory provision 
provides the greater rights to employees. 
When an employer violates both FMLA 
and a discrimination law, an employee 
may be able to recover under either or 
both statutes (double relief may not be 
awarded for the same loss; when 
remedies coincide a claimant may be 
allowed to utilize whichever avenue of 
relief is desired (Laffey v. Northwest 
Airlines, Inc., 567 F.2d 429, 445 (D.C. 
Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086 
(1978))). 

(b) If an employee is a qualified 

individual with a disability within the 
meaning of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA), the employer 
must make reasonable accommodations, 
etc., barring undue hardship, in 
accordance with the ADA. At the same 
time, the employer must afford an 
employee his or her FMLA rights. 
ADA’s ‘‘disability’’ and FMLA’s 
‘‘serious health condition’’ are different 
concepts, and must be analyzed 
separately. FMLA entitles eligible 
employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 
12-month period, whereas the ADA 
allows an indeterminate amount of 
leave, barring undue hardship, as a 
reasonable accommodation. FMLA 
requires employers to maintain 
employees’ group health plan coverage 
during FMLA leave on the same 
conditions as coverage would have been 
provided if the employee had been 
continuously employed during the leave 
period, whereas ADA does not require 
maintenance of health insurance unless 
other employees receive health 
insurance during leave under the same 
circumstances. 

(c)(1) A reasonable accommodation 

under the ADA might be accomplished 
by providing an individual with a 
disability with a part-time job with no 
health benefits, assuming the employer 
did not ordinarily provide health 
insurance for part-time employees. 
However, FMLA would permit an 
employee to work a reduced leave 
schedule until the equivalent of 12 
workweeks of leave were used, with 
group health benefits maintained during 
this period. FMLA permits an employer 
to temporarily transfer an employee

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  28 / Monday,  February  11,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

who is taking leave intermittently or on 
a reduced leave schedule for planned 
medical treatment to an alternative 
position, whereas the ADA allows an 
accommodation of reassignment to an 
equivalent, vacant position only if the 
employee cannot perform the essential 
functions of the employee’s present 
position and an accommodation is not 
possible in the employee’s present 
position, or an accommodation in the 
employee’s present position would 
cause an undue hardship. The examples 
in the following paragraphs of this 
section demonstrate how the two laws 
would interact with respect to a 
qualified individual with a disability. 

(2) A qualified individual with a 
disability who is also an ‘‘eligible 
employee’’ entitled to FMLA leave 
requests 10 weeks of medical leave as a 
reasonable accommodation, which the 
employer grants because it is not an 
undue hardship. The employer advises 
the employee that the 10 weeks of leave 
is also being designated as FMLA leave 
and will count towards the employee’s 
FMLA leave entitlement. This 
designation does not prevent the parties 
from also treating the leave as a 
reasonable accommodation and 
reinstating the employee into the same 
job, as required by the ADA, rather than 
an equivalent position under FMLA, if 
that is the greater right available to the 
employee. At the same time, the 
employee would be entitled under 
FMLA to have the employer maintain 
group health plan coverage during the 
leave, as that requirement provides the 
greater right to the employee. 

(3) If the same employee needed to 

work part-time (a reduced leave 
schedule) after returning to his or her 
same job, the employee would still be 
entitled under FMLA to have group 
health plan coverage maintained for the 
remainder of the two-week equivalent of 
FMLA leave entitlement, 
notwithstanding an employer policy 
that part-time employees do not receive 
health insurance. This employee would 
be entitled under the ADA to reasonable 
accommodations to enable the employee 
to perform the essential functions of the 
part-time position. In addition, because 
the employee is working a part-time 
schedule as a reasonable 
accommodation, the FMLA’s provision 
for temporary assignment to a different 
alternative position would not apply. 
Once the employee has exhausted his or 
her remaining FMLA leave entitlement 
while working the reduced (part-time) 
schedule, if the employee is a qualified 
individual with a disability, and if the 
employee is unable to return to the same 
full-time position at that time, the 
employee might continue to work part-

for duty to return to work, as permitted 
by FMLA under a uniform policy, it 
must comply with the ADA requirement 
that a fitness for duty physical be job- 
related and consistent with business 
necessity. 

(f) Under Title VII of the Civil Rights 

Act of 1964, as amended by the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act, an 
employer should provide the same 
benefits for women who are pregnant as 
the employer provides to other 
employees with short-term disabilities. 
Because Title VII does not require 
employees to be employed for a certain 
period of time to be protected, an 
employee employed for less than 12 
months by the employer (and, therefore, 
not an ‘‘eligible’’ employee under 
FMLA) may not be denied maternity 
leave if the employer normally provides 
short-term disability benefits to 
employees with the same tenure who 
are experiencing other short-term 
disabilities. 

(g) Under the Uniformed Services 

Employment and Reemployment Rights 
Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. 4301–4333 
(USERRA), veterans are entitled to 
receive all rights and benefits of 
employment that they would have 
obtained if they had been continuously 
employed. Therefore, under USERRA, a 
returning service member would be 
eligible for FMLA leave if the months 
and hours that he or she would have 
worked for the civilian employer during 
the period of military service, combined 
with the months employed and the 
hours actually worked, meet the FMLA 
eligibility threshold of 12 months and 
1,250 hours of employment. See 
§ 825.110(b)(2)(i) and .110(c)(2). 

(h) For further information on Federal 
antidiscrimination laws, including Title 
VII and the ADA, individuals are 
encouraged to contact the nearest office 
of the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission. 

Subpart H—Definitions 

§ 825.800 Definitions. 

For purposes of this part: 
Act or FMLA means the Family and 

Medical Leave Act of 1993, Public Law 
103–3 (February 5, 1993), 107 Stat. 6 (29 
U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) 

ADA means the Americans With 

Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) 

Administrator means the 

Administrator of the Wage and Hour 
Division, Employment Standards 
Administration, U.S. Department of 
Labor, and includes any official of the 
Wage and Hour Division authorized to 
perform any of the functions of the 
Administrator under this part. 

time as a reasonable accommodation, 
barring undue hardship; the employee 
would then be entitled to only those 
employment benefits ordinarily 
provided by the employer to part-time 
employees. 

(4) At the end of the FMLA leave 

entitlement, an employer is required 
under FMLA to reinstate the employee 
in the same or an equivalent position, 
with equivalent pay and benefits, to that 
which the employee held when leave 
commenced. The employer’s FMLA 
obligations would be satisfied if the 
employer offered the employee an 
equivalent full-time position. If the 
employee were unable to perform the 
essential functions of that equivalent 
position even with reasonable 
accommodation, because of a disability, 
the ADA may require the employer to 
make a reasonable accommodation at 
that time by allowing the employee to 
work part-time or by reassigning the 
employee to a vacant position, barring 
undue hardship. 

(d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to 

leave, an employer may not, in lieu of 
FMLA leave entitlement, require an 
employee to take a job with a reasonable 
accommodation. However, ADA may 
require that an employer offer an 
employee the opportunity to take such 
a position. An employer may not change 
the essential functions of the job in 
order to deny FMLA leave. See 
§ 825.220(b). 

(2) An employee may be on a workers’ 
compensation absence due to an on-the- 
job injury or illness which also qualifies 
as a serious health condition under 
FMLA. The workers’ compensation 
absence and FMLA leave may run 
concurrently (subject to proper notice 
and designation by the employer). At 
some point the health care provider 
providing medical care pursuant to the 
workers’ compensation injury may 
certify the employee is able to return to 
work in a ‘‘light duty’’ position. If the 
employer offers such a position, the 
employee is permitted but not required 
to accept the position (see § 825.220(d)). 
As a result, the employee may no longer 
qualify for payments from the workers’ 
compensation benefit plan, but the 
employee is entitled to continue on 
unpaid FMLA leave either until the 
employee is able to return to the same 
or equivalent job the employee left or 
until the 12-week FMLA leave 
entitlement is exhausted. See 
§ 825.207(e). If the employee returning 
from the workers’ compensation injury 
is a qualified individual with a 
disability, he or she will have rights 
under the ADA.

COBRA means the continuation 

coverage requirements of Title X of the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1986, As 
Amended (Pub. L. 99–272, title X, 
section 10002; 100 Stat 227; 29 U.S.C. 
1161–1168). 

Commerce and industry or activity 

affecting commerce mean any activity, 
business, or industry in commerce or in 
which a labor dispute would hinder or 
obstruct commerce or the free flow of 
commerce, and include ‘‘commerce’’ 
and any ‘‘industry affecting commerce’’ 
as defined in sections 501(1) and 501(3) 
of the Labor Management Relations Act 
of 1947, 29 U.S.C. 142(1) and (3). 

Continuing treatment by a health care 

provider means any one of the 
following: 

(1) Incapacity and treatment. A 

period of incapacity of more than three 
consecutive calendar days, and any 
subsequent treatment or period of 
incapacity relating to the same 
condition, that also involves: 

(i) Treatment two or more times, 

within a 30-day period unless 
extenuating circumstances exist, by a 
health care provider, by a nurse under 
direct supervision of a health care 
provider, or by a provider of health care 
services (e.g., physical therapist) under 
orders of, or on referral by, a health care 
provider; or 

(ii) Treatment by a health care 

provider on at least one occasion which 
results in a regimen of continuing 
treatment under the supervision of the 
health care provider. 

(2) Pregnancy or prenatal care. Any 
period of incapacity due to pregnancy, 
or for prenatal care. See also § 825.120. 
(3) Chronic conditions. Any period of 

incapacity or treatment for such 
incapacity due to a chronic serious 
health condition. A chronic serious 
health condition is one which: 

(i) Requires periodic visits (defined as 

at least twice a year) for treatment by a 
health care provider, or by a nurse 
under direct supervision of a health care 
provider; 

(ii) Continues over an extended 

period of time (including recurring 
episodes of a single underlying 
condition); and 

(iii) May cause episodic rather than a 

continuing period of incapacity (e.g., 
asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.). 

(4) Permanent or long-term 

conditions. A period of incapacity 
which is permanent or long-term due to 
a condition for which treatment may not 
be effective. The employee or family 
member must be under the continuing 
supervision of, but need not be 
receiving active treatment by, a health 
care provider. Examples include 

Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, or the 
terminal stages of a disease. 

(5) Conditions requiring multiple 

treatments. Any period of absence to 
receive multiple treatments (including 
any period of recovery therefrom) by a 
health care provider or by a provider of 
health care services under orders of, or 
on referral by, a health care provider, 
for: 

(i) Restorative surgery after an 

accident or other injury; or 

(ii) A condition that would likely 

result in a period of incapacity of more 
than three consecutive calendar days in 
the absence of medical intervention or 
treatment, such as cancer 
(chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe 
arthritis (physical therapy), kidney 
disease (dialysis). 

(6) Absences attributable to incapacity 

under paragraphs (2) or (3) of this 
definition qualify for FMLA leave even 
though the employee or the covered 
family member does not receive 
treatment from a health care provider 
during the absence, and even if the 
absence does not last more than three 
consecutive calendar days. For example, 
an employee with asthma may be 
unable to report for work due to the 
onset of an asthma attack or because the 
employee’s health care provider has 
advised the employee to stay home 
when the pollen count exceeds a certain 
level. An employee who is pregnant 
may be unable to report to work because 
of severe morning sickness. 
Eligible employee means: 
(1) An employee who has been 
employed for a total of at least 12 
months by the employer on the date on 
which any FMLA leave is to commence, 
except that an employer need not 
consider any period of previous 
employment that occurred more than 
five years before the date of the most 
recent hiring of the employee, unless: 

(i) The break in service is occasioned 

by the fulfillment of the employee’s 
National Guard or Reserve military 
service obligation (the time served 
performing the military service must be 
also counted in determining whether 
the employee has been employed for at 
least 12 months by the employer, but 
this section does not provide any greater 
entitlement to the employee than would 
be available under the Uniformed 
Services Employment and 
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)); 
or 

(ii) A written agreement, including a 
collective bargaining agreement, exists 
concerning the employer’s intention to 
rehire the employee after the break in 
service (e.g., for purposes of the 
employee furthering his or her

and 

(2) Who, on the date on which any 

FMLA leave is to commence, has been 
employed for at least 1,250 hours of 
service with such employer during the 
previous 12-month period; and 

(3) Who is employed in any State of 

the United States, the District of 
Columbia or any Territories or

employees employed by that employer 
within 75 miles of that worksite is also 
fewer than 50. 

(7) Excludes any employee employed 

in any country other than the United 
States or any Territory or possession of 
the United States.

(2) In the case of an individual 

employed by a public agency,

through an ‘‘employee benefit plan’’ as 
defined in section 3(3) of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
29 U.S.C. 1002(3). The term does not

§ 825.209(a)). 

FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards 

Act (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).

such employees or former employees. 
For purposes of FMLA the term ‘‘group

(1) No contributions are made by the 

employer; 

(2) Participation in the program is 
completely voluntary for employees; 

(3) The sole functions of the employer

Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. 
Where an employee or family member is 
receiving treatment from a Christian 
Science practitioner, an employee may 
not object to any requirement from an 
employer that the employee or family 
member submit to examination (though 
not treatment) to obtain a second or 
third certification from a health care 
provider other than a Christian Science 

practitioner except as otherwise 
provided under applicable State or local 
law or collective bargaining agreement. 

(iv) Any health care provider from 
whom an employer or the employer’s 
group health plan’s benefits manager 
will accept certification of the existence

Regulations at 29 CFR part 1630.2(h), (i), 
and (j), issued by the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 
42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define these 
terms. 

Public agency means the government 
of the United States; the government of 
a State or political subdivision thereof; 
any agency of the United States 
(including the United States Postal 
Service and Postal Regulatory 
Commission), a State, or a political 
subdivision of a State, or any interstate 
governmental agency. Under section 
101(5)(B) of the Act, a public agency is 
considered to be a ‘‘person’’ engaged in 
commerce or in an industry or activity 
affecting commerce within the meaning 
of the Act. 

Reduced leave schedule means a 

leave schedule that reduces the usual 
number of hours per workweek, or 
hours per workday, of an employee. 
Secretary means the Secretary of 
Labor or authorized representative. 

Serious health condition means an 

illness, injury, impairment or physical 
or mental condition that involves 
inpatient care as defined in § 825.114 or 

continuing treatment by a health care 
provider as defined in § 825.115. 
Conditions for which cosmetic 
treatments are administered (such as 
most treatments for acne or plastic 
surgery) are not ‘‘serious health 
conditions’’ unless inpatient hospital 
care is required or unless complications 
develop. Restorative dental or plastic 
surgery after an injury or removal of 
cancerous growths are serious health 
conditions provided all the other 
conditions of this regulation are met. 
Mental illness resulting from stress, or 
allergies may be serious health 
conditions, but only if all the conditions
