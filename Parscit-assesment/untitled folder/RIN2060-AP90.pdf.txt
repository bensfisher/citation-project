SECTION 1  

INTRODUCTION 

Section 129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires that performance standards for new 
units and emission guidelines (EG) for existing units be established for each category of solid 
waste incineration units. In previous actions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
has promulgated rules and EG for hospital medical and infectious waste incinerators (HMIWI), 
commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators (CISWI), and other solid waste incineration 
(OSWI) units. These actions did not apply to sewage sludge incinerators (SSI). EPA is proposing 
new source performance standards (NSPS) and EG for SSI units. As part of the regulatory 
process, EPA is required to develop a regulatory impact analysis (RIA). The RIA includes an 
economic impact analysis (EIA) and a small entity impacts analysis and documents the RIA 
methods and results.  

1.1 

Executive Summary 
The key results of the RIA are as follows: 

§  Options Analyzed: EPA analyzed the following options and selected Option 2:  

–  Option 1 is the MACT floor level of control for the two subcategories developed 
for existing sewage sludge incineration (SSI) units, multiple hearth (MH) units, 
and fluidized bed (FB) units. 

–  Option 2 is the same as Option 1, with the addition of activated carbon injection 

for additional mercury (Hg) emissions reduction from MH units. 

–  Option 3 is the same as Option 2, with the addition of an afterburner on all MH 

units for additional carbon monoxide (CO) emissions reduction.   

§  Engineering Cost Analysis: EPA estimates the proposed rule’s total annualized costs 

will be $92 million (2008$).  

§  Social Cost Analysis: Because the proposed regulatory option affects governmental 

entities (96 of the 97 owners are governmental entities) providing services not 
provided in a market, the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has 
used the direct compliance cost method as a measure of social costs. The social cost is 
approximately $92 million (2008$).  

§  Small Entity Analyses: EPA performed a screening analysis for impacts for 18 small 
government entities by comparing compliance costs to revenues (e.g., revenue tests). 
EPA’s analysis found the tests were below 1% for small entities.  

§  Benefits Analysis: In the year of full implementation (2015), EPA estimates the 
monetized PM2.5 benefits of the proposed NSPS and EG are $130 million to $320 
million and $120 million to $290 million, at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively. 

1-1 

 

All estimates are in 2008$ for the year 2015. Using alternate relationships between 
PM2.5 and premature mortality supplied by experts, higher and lower benefits 
estimates are plausible, but most of the expert-based estimates fall between these 
estimates. The benefits from reducing other air pollutants have not been monetized in 
this analysis, including reducing 2,900 tons of CO, 96 tons of HCl, 3.0 tons of Pb, 1.6 
tons of Cd, 5,500 pounds of mercury (Hg), and 90 grams of total dioxins/furans 
(CDD/CDF) each year. In addition, ecosystem benefits and visibility benefits have 
not been monetized in this analysis. 

§  Net Benefits: The net benefits for the NSPS and EG are $37 million to $220 million 
and $26 million to $190 million, at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively (Table 1-
1). All estimates are in 2008$ for the year 2015.

incinerators anticipated to come online by 2015 and the large entities comply and small entities landfill assumption. 
b The total monetized benefits reflect the human health benefits associated with reducing exposure to PM2.5 through reductions of 
directly emitted PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors such as NOx and SO2. It is important to note that the monetized benefits include 
many but not all health effects associated with PM2.5 exposure. Benefits are shown as a range from Pope et al. (2002) to Laden 
et al. (2006). These models assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in causing 
premature mortality because there is no clear scientific evidence that would support the development of differential effects 
estimates by particle type. These estimates include energy disbenefits valued at $0.5 million at a 3% discount rate from CO2 
emissions. 
c The annual compliances costs serve as a proxy for the annual social costs of this rule given the lack of difference between the two. 

 

 

SECTION 2 

 

DESCRIPTION OF SEWAGE SLUDGE INCINERATION1 

Sewage sludge incinerators combust the organic and inorganic solids and dissolved 
materials resulting from the wastewater treatment process. Incineration greatly reduces the 
sludge volume, and post-incineration sludge ash can be disposed of more easily. Sludge ash is 
generally disposed of in landfills but can also be used in construction materials. In addition to 
disposal functions, some facilities capture the heat from sewage sludge incineration operations 
and use the heat as an energy source.  

The incineration process releases several pollutants, some of which were present in the 

sewage sludge and some of which are created as a result of combustion. Pollutants emitted from 
SSI include particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbons, CO, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, 
hydrogen chloride, dioxins and dibenzofurans, and a number of metals. The amount of these 
pollutants released during incineration depends on the content of the sludge, the type of 
incinerator used, and the level of PM control.  

The majority of incineration facilities (163, or 75%) are multiple hearth (MH) 

incinerators. These incinerators consist of a cylinder around a series of hearths with a rotating 
shaft through the center. Rabble arms with teeth in each hearth rake the sludge while air is ducted 
into the shaft and circulated. The incinerator consists of the upper drying zone, the middle sludge 
combustion zone, and the lower cooling zone.  

Although MH incinerators have been in use since the 1930s and remain in the majority, 

fluidized bed (FB) incinerators have begun to replace them.2 Of the 218 incineration units in 
operation 55 (25%) are FB incinerators. In a FB incinerator, a steel shell holds a refractory-lined 
grid beneath a bed of sand. Air is injected into the incinerator, fluidizing the sand and sludge. FB 
incinerators work efficiently to transfer heat from the sand to the sludge, using less excess air 
than MH incinerators. Emissions for most pollutants are, therefore, lower for FB incinerators.  

2.1 

Relation to Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) 
Publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) are wastewater treatment systems owned by 

states, municipalities, or other public entities. POTWs receive sewage from homes and 

                                                
1Portions of this section rely on information provided by EPA (2007 and 2009). 
2Other types of sewage sludge incinerators, such as electric arc furnaces, are no longer used in the United States. 

2-1 

 

businesses, runoff, and sometimes industrial wastewater. After the wastewater treatment process, 
POTWs are responsible for disposing of the sewage sludge.  

POTWs treat sewage in three steps: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. In the 

primary stage, heavy solids settle to the bottom while oil and light solids are skimmed from the 
top. The sludge removed during this step is known as primary sludge. During secondary 
treatment, biological treatment creates secondary sludge. Some plants may continue with a 
tertiary treatment of chemical disinfection, which produces a tertiary or chemical sludge (EPA, 
2009). The three sludge types are then generally combined and disposed of or sent for further 
treatment.  

2.2 

Alternative Disposal Options 
Incineration continues to be utilized to dispose of sewage sludge but is increasingly 
becoming less common. Additional pollution controls will increase costs for facilities that 
continue to use the incineration disposal method. If the additional costs are high enough, many 
POTWs may choose to adopt alternative disposals methods (e.g., surface disposal in landfills or 
other beneficial land applications). However, the use of alternative disposal methods may be of 
limited in some areas because of landfill capacity constraints, local geography, or other legal or 
economic constraints.  

2.2.1  Surface Disposal: Landfills 

Landfilling, in some cases, provides a simple and low-cost option for sewage sludge 
disposal. Sewage sludge may be placed in landfills used for other municipal solid waste or in 
landfills constructed specifically for sewage sludge. The landfill disposal option is attractive for 
low-volume incinerators; landfill capacity constraints limit disposal opportunities for large 
sludge volumes. 

Sewage sludge may also be useful for landfills. For example, sludge can be used in place 
of a daily soil cover for odor and blowing litter control or as a final cover for closed landfills to 
aid growth of a vegetative layer. The sewage sludge’s high organic content also helps break 
down other landfill waste.  

2.2.2  Other Land Application 

Sewage sludge that has undergone treatment to make it safe for use on other land 
application (e.g., fertilizer) is commonly referred to as biosolids. Biosolids can be sold to 
agricultural or landscaping entities for land application, so the organic material in biosolids is 

2-2 

 

reused to contribute to crop production. Land application has also been used in mine reclamation 
to reestablish vegetation.  

Biosolids must meet federal and state regulations to ensure their safety; meeting these 
standards may make other land applications a less attractive disposal option. In addition, land 
application may not be suitable in some areas, based on factors such as proximity of water 
sources and slope. Rules vary based on the quality of the biosolid: Class A biosolids meet strict 
standards, while Class B biosolids are treated but still contain detectable pathogen levels and 
face greater restrictions on usage (EPA, 2007). Actions must also be taken to reduce the vector 
attraction of biosolids, either through additional treatment or by preventing contact with vectors.  

2.3  Ownership 

Sewage sludge incinerators can be operated by municipalities or other entities. There is 

no specific North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these units. 
Applicable NAICS codes include 562213 (solid waste combustors and incinerators) and 221320 
(sewage treatment facilities). Most sludge incinerators are located in the eastern United States.  

The United States has 97 operators that own 112 facilities with a total of 218 affected 

incinerator units; the typical (e.g., median) operator owns one facility. Almost all operators are 
towns, cities, and their utility authorities; the exception is one operator that is a large publicly 
owned company. Among owner municipalities whose exact population is known, the average 
(median) population is 336,305 (108,213). Out of the 94 owners with population information 
available, 18 (or 19%) are small entities that serve a population under 50,000.

SECTION 3 

 

ENGINEERING COST ANALYSIS 

This section documents the calculation of costs and emissions reductions associated with 

existing and new sources complying with the MACT floor level of control, the selection of 
control options more stringent than the MACT floor level of control, and summarizes cost and 
emissions reductions of each control option. The costs and emission reductions of each option 
are then used in the economic analysis (Section 4) and human health benefits analysis (Section 
5). Costs and emissions reductions were calculated for two scenarios: 

§  Control options were applied to all SSI units, and 

§  Control options were applied to only larger entities. Larger entities mean wastewater 

treatment facilities that are owned by municipalities or authorities with more than 
50,000 people. Entities with fewer than 50,000 people are likely to dispose of sewage 
sludge by landfilling rather than continuing to operate their incineration unit.  

3.1 

Calculation of Costs and Emissions Reductions of the Maximum Achievable Control 
Technology (MACT) Floor 
A significant portion of the total cost for industry compliance comes from the cost of 

installing new pollution control devices or improving existing pollution control devices for units 
not currently meeting the proposed limits. In order to determine the control costs, it was 
necessary to evaluate, for each SSI unit, how much improvement for each pollutant would be 
needed to meet the proposed emissions limits.  

The average pollutant concentration values used to calculate baseline annual emissions 

(Estimation of Baseline Emissions, 2010) for each unit were compared with the proposed 
emissions limits, and percentages were calculated to quantify the amount of improvement needed 
for the unit to meet the proposed limits. Tables C-1a and C-1b in Appendix C contain the 
baseline pollutant concentration values used for each unit in each subcategory and the percentage 
improvement required to meet the proposed emissions limits for each unit for each pollutant. The 
existing SSI units are subcategorized into two main groups: multiple hearth (MH) units and 
fluidized bed (FB) units. The pollutant- and subcategory-specific limits are shown in each header 
row of these tables. 

Control methods and cost algorithms utilized in a recent rulemaking for another waste 

combustion source category, Hospital, Medical and Infectious Waste Incinerators (HMIWI) were 
updated and utilized generally for the SSI source category, since most of these algorithms can be 
tailored to the combustion units found in the SSI source category with slight modifications. 

3-1 

 

Based on these required improvements, pollutant-specific control methods were chosen as 
follows for units requiring more than 10 percent improvement to meet the proposed limits. It was 
assumed that units within 10 percent of the limit would be able to meet the limit by making 
minor adjustments to the unit and/or controls already in place. 

Metals (cadmium and lead) and PM: Adding fabric filters (FF). 

Mercury and dioxins/furans (CDD/CDF): Adding activated carbon injection (ACI) and 

adjusting the carbon addition rate to meet the amount of reduction required. 

Hydrogen chloride (HCl): Adding packed bed scrubbers (PBS). 

Carbon monoxide (CO): No further improvement was needed for units to meet the 

MACT floor limit. However, the beyond-the-floor limit required the use of afterburner retrofits 
for units not already having similar control. The costs and emission reductions associated with 
the proposed CO limit are discussed in the memorandum “Analysis of Beyond the Maximum 
Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Floor Controls for Existing SSI Units.”2 

Nitrogen oxides (NOx): No more than 10 percent improvement in NOx control was 

needed for any units. Minor adjustments were considered sufficient for those needing 
improvement to meet the NOx limit. 

Sulfur dioxide (SO2): Adding packed bed scrubbers. 

Further descriptions of these controls and their associated costs are listed below in 

Section 3.1.1. 

3.1.1  Compliance Costs 

This section presents the methodology used to estimate costs for existing SSI for (A) the 

emission controls used to comply with the proposed limits; (B) the monitoring, testing, 
recordkeeping, and reporting activities used to demonstrate compliance; and (C) the alternatives 
to compliance.  

3.1.1.1 Emission Control Costs 

Emission control technologies and other control measures that can be used to comply 
with the MACT floor options for existing SSI units include PBS, FF, and activated ACI. This 
section presents the costs that were estimated for each of these control measures. 

3-2 

 

The retrofit factors for the capital costs were assumed to be 40 percent for packed bed 
scrubbers, fabric filters, and 20 percent for and ACI.5, 6 Downtime costs for the retrofits were 
assumed to be negligible. Most SSI are expected to have adequate space to install an emission 
control system without shutting down the incinerator for an extended period. It was also 
expected that connecting the ductwork could be performed during a scheduled downtime for 
maintenance, thereby minimizing expected downtime.7  

The capital and annual costs for the emission controls were estimated in units of dollars 

($) and $/flow. The $/flow costs were calculated by dividing the capital/annual control cost 
estimate for each unit by the average gas flow rate assigned to that unit.  

Costs are on a 2008 basis, and annualized costs assumed an interest rate of 7 percent. 

Tables C-2a to C-2c in Appendix C present a summary of the parameters and equations used in 
the cost algorithms for each emission control and alternative to compliance where applicable. 
Table C-3 in Appendix C lists of the unit-specific inputs used in the algorithms (e.g., incinerator 
charge rate, stack gas flow rate, incinerator operating hours, and concentrations) 

a. 

Adding a fabric filter. 

Fabric filters can be installed either alone or with other add-on controls. The cost 

algorithm for installing a fabric filter is presented in Table C-2a in Appendix C and is based on 
algorithms in the Model Plant Description and Control Cost Report for HMIWI.6 The fabric 
filter capital costs range from approximately $893,000 to $4.2 million, and annualized costs 
range from approximately $209,000/yr to $1.2 million/yr. Sources for specific cost data are noted 
below Table C-2a in Appendix C.

Adding a packed bed scrubber.  

Wet scrubbers can be installed alone or after a dry scrubber/fabric filter. The cost 

algorithm for installing a packed-bed wet scrubber is presented in Table C-2b of Appendix C and 
is based on algorithms in the Model Plant Description and Control Cost Report for HMIWI.8 
The packed-bed wet scrubber capital costs range from approximately $366,000 to $8.7 million, 
and annualized costs range from approximately $103,000/yr to $1.8 million/yr. Sources for 
specific cost data are noted below Table C-2b in Appendix C. 

c. 

Adding an activated carbon injection (ACI) system.  

Injecting activated carbon before the fabric filter has been demonstrated to improve the 

removal efficiency of both Hg and CDD/CDF from SSI. The cost algorithm for installing an ACI 

3-3 

 

system is presented in Table C-2c in Appendix C and is based on algorithms in the Model Plant 
Description and Control Cost Report for HMIWI.8 Adjustments to the carbon injection rate were 
made to account for how much reduction was required to meet the proposed limit, and whether a 
packed-bed scrubber was being added, since those may also assist in reducing Hg emissions. The 
packed-bed scrubber adjustment is a ten percent Hg reduction, and is based on input from the 
boiler NESHAP development. The ACI factor compares the carbon grain loading originally 
assumed to achieve 90 percent control of mercury or 98 percent control of CDD/CDF to the 
amount of reduction the unit will need to meet the proposed emission limits. The highest factor 
(Hg or CDD/CDF) is then used to adjust the carbon injection rate calculation of the algorithm. 
ACI capital costs range from approximately $8,400 to $37,000, and annualized costs range from 
approximately $9,300/yr to $210,000/yr. Sources for specific cost data are noted below Table C-
2c in Appendix C. 

d. 

Additional Control Options.  

Minor adjustments, such as air handling and distribution adjustments in the firebox, can 

be made to certain units to improve NOx control. It was assumed these adjustments could be 
made at no additional cost. 

3.1.1.2 Stack Testing, Monitoring, and Recordkeeping Costs 

Monitoring Costs. Initial and continuous compliance provisions for SSI units were 

selected to be as consistent as possible with proposed commercial and industrial solid waste 
incinerator (CISWI) and current HMIWI provisions. This section presents the costs that were 
estimated for each of these requirements. 

The total capital cost for stack testing, monitoring, and recordkeeping and reporting for 

all subcategories is estimated at approximately $14.9 million, and the total annualized cost is 
about $16.9 million per year. Cost estimates were based on algorithms recently utilized in the 
HMIWI regulatory development. Costs were updated to a 2008 basis, and annualized costs 
assumed an interest rate of 7 percent. Tables C-4a to C-4e in Appendix C present a summary of 
the parameters and equations used in the cost algorithms for each monitoring component, where 
applicable. 

Inspections. Consistent with HMIWI regulations, it was assumed that annual control 
device inspections will be required for any units having control devices in place or requiring 
further controls to meet the proposed emission limits. In this context, control devices include 

3-4 

 

fabric filters, afterburners, wet scrubbers, or ACI systems. The cost was estimated at a flat rate of 
$1000 per year. See Table C-4a in Appendix C for further details and sources. 

Parameter monitors. Monitoring of operating parameters can be used to indicate whether 
air pollution control equipment and practices are functioning properly to minimize air pollution. 
Based on the existing CISWI regulations and HMIWI regulations, it was assumed that parameter 
monitoring will be mandatory for all units required to add fabric filters, packed bed scrubbers, or 
ACI systems. Costs for each monitoring system were estimated as follows: 

• 

• 

• 

For a fabric filter bag leak detection system, capital cost was estimated at $25,500 
and annualized cost at $9,700/yr.  
For a wet scrubber monitoring system, capital cost was estimated at $24,300 and 
annualized cost at $5,600/yr.  
The cost for ACI monitoring depends on a unit’s annual operational hours. There 
are no capital costs for ACI monitoring. Annual costs ranged from $500 to $9,800.  

For default parameters and equations used for monitoring costs, see Table C-4b. Sources 

for specific cost data are noted below the table. 

a. 

Testing Costs 

1.  Initial Stack Testing. It was assumed that initial stack testing will be required for each 
pollutant that the ICR testing showed did not meet the proposed emission limit. Any 
unit having no test data for certain pollutants will also be required to perform an 
initial emissions test for those pollutants. Costs for each required stack test were 
summed and multiplied by 2/3 to adjust for economies of scale when multiple 
pollutant tests were being performed on a unit. The annualized costs were calculated 
assuming a capital recovery factor of 0.10979 (15 years at 7 percent). The basis of 
these cost estimates for each stack test is summarized in Table C-4c in Appendix C.  

2.  Annual Stack Testing. It was assumed that all units, to some extent, will be required to 

demonstrate ongoing compliance with the emissions limits for all pollutants. It was 
assumed that all units will be required to conduct annual stack tests for all pollutants. 
The cost for this annual testing was estimated to be approximately $61,000/yr. The 
basis of these cost estimates for each stack test is summarized in Table C-4c in 
Appendix C. 

3.  Visible emissions testing. All SSI units will likely have ash handling operations. 

Therefore, these units would be required to demonstrate compliance to a 5 percent 
visible emissions limit for fugitive emissions generated during ash handling (similar 
to HMIWI).  We are proposing that units will be required to conduct annual 
performance tests for fugitive emissions from ash handling using EPA Method 22. 
Costs for this annual test include a capital cost of $250 and an annual cost of $200, 
based on the Revised Compliance Costs and Economic Inputs for Existing HMIWI 

3-5 

 

memo.8 Further details regarding this cost estimate are included in Table C-4d in 
Appendix C. 

b. 

Recordkeeping and Reporting Costs 

For all units, a flat rate of $2,989 per year was estimated as the annual cost for 

recordkeeping and reporting. Further details regarding this cost estimate, including hourly labor 
assumptions, labor rates, and associated sources, are included in Table C-4e in Appendix C. 

3.1.1.3 Alternative Disposal Costs 

Certain SSI units may have waste disposal alternatives other than combustion available to 

them, and these alternatives may prove to be less costly than the controls and monitoring 
required for compliance with the proposed SSI standards. To determine if landfilling would be 
an affordable option for facilities even in the absence of the proposed standards, both the annual 
cost to landfill and the annual unit operating cost were estimated. Then, the overall cost for the 
landfilling option was calculated using the following equation: 

Annual Cost for Landfilling Option = Annual Cost to Landfill – Annual Cost to Operate 

SSI Unit 

The methodology for determining annual landfilling costs and annual unit operational 

costs is described below. 

a. 

Cost to Haul to Landfill 

The cost to haul waste to a landfill is the sum of additional sludge storage costs, landfill 
tipping fees, and transportation costs, which depend on the amount of waste to be hauled and the 
distance traveled per haul.  

If choosing to landfill, it was assumed that a facility would need adequate storage 

capacity to store a minimum of 2 to 4 days worth of dried sludge, to account for occasional 
multi-day landfill closures (e.g. weekends and holidays). Facilities may already have such 
storage on-site to account for non-continuous operation of the incineration unit. For this analysis, 
to provide a conservative estimate of costs of the landfilling option, a cost for storing dewatered 
sludge was calculated. It was assumed that a concrete pad with metal railing would be sufficient 
for storage of dried or dewatered sludge at small entities. The smaller entities have a lower 
average dry sludge capacity than large entities. Sewage sludge incineration capacity was known 
for 4 of the 21 units owned by small entities. An average capacity of 1.90 dry tons per hour was 
applied to the other 17 units, and these capacities were used to estimate the maximum volume of 
dry sludge that would accumulate over 4 days. Costs were then estimated for the concrete and 

3-6 

 

aluminum required to accommodate these volumes. Table C-5c in Appendix C presents these 
costs estimates by unit. For large entities, a different type of storage would likely be required 
(such as a concrete basin capable of storing large quantities of sludge); storage costs for these 
facilities were not estimated because it was assumed large entities would comply rather than shut 
down their units and landfill. 

Tipping fees used in the analysis were specific to each state where state data were 
available9; where state data were not available, landfill tipping fees were based on regional 
tipping fees.10 All fees were in units of $/ton waste and were converted to 2008 dollars. The 
annual tonnage of waste being diverted was calculated based on the dry sludge feed rate of each 
unit and the number of hours it operates per year. Operational hours and sludge feed rates are 
discussed in further detail in the SSI inventory and baseline emissions memos. Discussion with 
landfill experts indicated that landfills may accept wet sewage sludge as well. However, because 
landfills might have a wet sludge capacity limit and SSI units are already dewatering their 
sludge, it’s likely they would continue to do this. The cost analysis therefore focuses on 
landfilling dry sludge rather than wet sludge. 

Transportation costs were based on an estimated $0.266 per ton-mile11. It was assumed 
that a landfill could be found within 50 miles of each facility, yielding a roundtrip distance of 
100 miles. However, a review of state regulations for states where small entities are located 
revealed that Connecticut and New Jersey do not allow sewage sludge to be landfilled. To adjust 
for this, round trip distances for facilities in these states were increased to 200 miles, assuming a 
landfill could be found in another state within 100 miles from the facility.  

Annual landfilling costs varied widely, ranging from $13,000/yr to $5.1 million/yr. Table 
C-5a in Appendix C summarizes the parameters and equations used to calculate the annual cost 
for each facility to landfill the waste it would otherwise incinerate in an SSI. 

b. 

Cost to Operate Incinerator 

Annual incinerator operational costs were based on data provided from the ICR survey 
and known unit capacities. The survey specifically requested that respondents provide annual 
costs to operate each incinerator in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Costs were then confirmed or revised 
based on follow-up contact with the survey recipients. Several steps were taken and assumptions 
made to standardize the data: (1) total costs provided were assumed to be for operating only the 
incinerator (i.e. did not include dewatering or other aspects of plant operation); (2) total costs 

3-7 

 

listed for multiple units were divided evenly among each unit; and (3) individual cost 
components (e.g. electricity, labor, fuel) were summed if a total cost was not explicitly provided.  

Because cost information was only available for the 9 surveyed entities, an annual cost 

factor, in $/dry ton, was developed using the available data and multiplied by the average 
capacities of all other units. Both an average factor ($113.80/dry ton for FB units and 
$329.22/dry ton for MH units) and a minimum factor ($55.50/dry ton for FB units and 
$79.43/dry ton for MH units) were calculated and applied. The minimum factor is the most 
conservative estimate (i.e. would yield the lowest unit operational cost and thus the highest net 
cost for the landfilling option) and was used for the economic analysis.12 

Table C-5b in Appendix C summarizes the information provided, assumptions made, and 

cost factors used to estimate costs for all units not having cost data.  

3.1.2  Emission Reductions 

Emissions reductions were calculated for each of the nine pollutants for two scenarios: 
(1) assuming each existing unit complied with the proposed emissions limits; and (2) assuming 
that all large entities would comply with the proposed emission limits and small entities would 
cease using their incinerators and landfill the dewatered sludge instead. Emission reductions 
were calculated by estimating the emissions resulting from each scenario and subtracting the 
baseline emissions previously calculated. Baseline emission calculations are discussed in a 
separate memorandum.3 The baseline memorandum indicates that emissions and flow rate 
information was collected from only 25 of the 218 SSI units. Sludge capacity information was 
collected from 105 of 218 units. As described in the baseline memorandum, default factors for 
emissions, flow rate, and sludge capacity were developed and applied to units without data. 

3.1.2.1 Emission Reductions if All Entities Comply With MACT Floor Limits  

Emission reductions were calculated using the following equation: 

Reduction = Baseline – MACT Floor Emission 

The calculation of baseline emissions are described in detail in a separate memo.3 The 

MACT floor emission values, resulting from all entities meeting the proposed limits, were 
calculated as follows: 

3-8 

 

a. 

Units already meeting the proposed limits.  

If a unit was already meeting the MACT floor for a given pollutant, then the MACT floor 

emission value was assumed to equal the baseline value (i.e., no backsliding or emissions 
increases would occur), yielding zero reduction.  

b. 

Units not currently meeting the proposed limits. 

For units not already meeting the MACT floor for a given pollutant, it was assumed that 
with the proposed limits in place the unit would reduce its pollutant concentration to at least that 
of the floor. Thus, the reduction would be the difference between the baseline and the proposed 
limit.  

3.1.2.2 Emission Reductions if Large Entities Comply With MACT Floor Limits and Small 

Entities Landfill 

For large entities, reductions are calculated as described in Section 4.1. For small entities, 

however, the emissions resulting from hauling the diverted waste, landfilling the waste, and 
flaring the landfill gas generated from the waste need to be considered. Emission reductions for 
small entities were calculated using the following equations: 

Reduction = Baseline – (MACT Floor Emission + Emissions from Landfilling) 

Emissions from Landfilling = Vehicle Emissions + Direct Landfill Emissions + Flare 

Emissions 

a. 

Vehicle Emissions 

To determine the vehicle emissions resulting from the trucks that would haul the 

dewatered sewage sludge to a nearby landfill, assumptions regarding sludge density, truck 
capacity, and vehicle emission factors were made: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

A dewatered sludge density of 1,215 pounds per cubic yard13 was used in 
conjunction with each unit’s capacity to determine the approximate volume of 
sludge to be hauled. 
It was assumed that, since most facilities would need to move at least 50 cubic 
yards per day, a maximum capacity hauling vehicle (36 yd3) would be the most 
likely vehicle used.14 
The following emission factors for CO, NOx, Filterable PM, PM2.5, and SO2 were 
derived from EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) Motor 
Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES),15 using national defaults for parameters 
and refuse trucks as the source type :  

3-9 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

2.99 grams emitted per mile 
CO  
NOx  
10.8 grams emitted per mile 
Filterable PM  0.65 grams emitted per mile 
0.56 grams emitted per mile 
PM2.5    
SO2  
 
0.03 grams emitted per mile 

Table C-6a shows the inputs and resulting emissions calculated for each unit choosing the 

landfill option. 

b. 

Direct Landfill Emissions 

Landfill gas generated by the decomposition of waste is a source of Hg, HCl, and SO2. 

Emissions of these three criteria pollutants due to landfilled, dewatered sewage sludge, were 
estimated using EPA’s LandGEM16 model in conjunction with default landfill gas sulfur and 
chlorine concentrations, as reported in the AP-42.17 As a conservative estimate, it was assumed 
that landfill gas collection systems would collect 50 percent of the landfill gas generated. Unit 
capacities and operational hours were used to determine the amount of waste diverted annually 
from all units. Instead of running LandGEM for each individual unit, a total estimate of landfill 
gas generated by running the model once using the total annual waste diverted for all units. Unit-
specific estimates for landfill emissions were not calculated. Raw LandGEM outputs and default 
assumptions are presented in Table C-6b in Appendix C. Resulting total emissions over 20 years 
for these three pollutants are presented in Table C-6c in Appendix C. These values were divided 
by 20 to obtain annual emissions directly emitted from landfills as a result of landfilling 
dewatered sewage sludge. 

c. 

Emissions from Landfill Gas Flaring 

Additional emissions of PM, NOx, and CO will result from flaring landfill gas generated 
by the landfilling of dewatered sewage sludge. A landfill gas collection efficiency of 50 percent 
was assumed, meaning that 50 percent of the landfill gas generated from landfilled sewage 
sludge would be collected and combusted. AP-42 emission factors, representing the mass of 
pollutant emitted per volume of methane combusted, were applied in conjunction with the 
methane output calculated in the LandGEM model. Again, LandGEM outputs are presented in 
Table C-6b in Appendix C, and resulting total emissions over 20 years for these three pollutants 
are presented in Table C-6c in Appendix C. Values were divided by 20 to obtain annual 
emissions resulting from landfill gas flaring.

3.2 

Analysis of Beyond the MACT Floor Controls for Existing SSI Units 
The MACT floor analysis for existing sources results in emission levels that each existing 
SSI unit is required to meet. The costs and emission reductions of the MACT floor requirements 
were estimated using the following assumptions: (1) units that needed to meet the MACT floor 
for Cd, Pb, and PM would add a FF, (2) units that needed to meet the MACT floor for HCl and 
SO2 would add a packed bed scrubber (PBS), and (3) units that needed to meet the MACT floor 
for Hg and CDD/CDF would use activated carbon injection (ACI) (Cost and Emissions 
Reduction, 2010). All FB and MH units were determined to meet the floor level of control for 
NOx and CO, and no additional control was necessary.  

Section 3.2.1 discusses the selection of more stringent controls or emission levels than 

the floor level reviewed for this analysis. Section 3.2.2 discusses the methodology used to 
estimate costs and emission reductions of the more stringent controls, and Section 3.2.3 
summarizes regulatory options selected for the BTF analysis. Baseline emissions and emission 
reductions of PM2.5 were calculated from emissions data collected by EPA and assuming that 
controls applicable for PM would also reduce PM2.5. 

3.2.1  Selection of More Stringent Controls 

The control technologies that were costed to achieve the MACT floor levels for PM, Cd, 

Pb, HCl, SO2, Hg, and CDD/CDF are the most effective controls available to reduce these 
pollutants. Consequently, no additional technologies were considered to control these pollutants 
for this analysis. Since not every SSI unit was determined to need FF, PBS, or ACI to achieve 
the MACT floor level of control or operated them currently (i.e., the baseline level of control), 
more stringent controls to be analyzed for the entire SSI source category would be requiring all 
units that did not have these controls at baseline or for meeting the MACT floors to add these 
controls. Consequently, more stringent controls applied to SSI units that were analyzed include 
adding a FF for all SSI units (if the units did not already have one at baseline or to meet the 
MACT floor) to control PM, Cd, and Pb; adding a PBS for all SSI units (if the units did not 
already have one at baseline or to meet the MACT floor) to control HCl and SO2; and adding 
ACI (if the units did not already have one at baseline or to meet the MACT floor) to control Hg 
and CDD/CDF. Emission reductions of PM2.5 were calculated assuming that controls applicable 
for PM would also reduce PM2.5. 

Potential add-on control technologies that achieve NOx reduction at other combustion 
sources are selective catalytic reduction (SCR), selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), and 
flue gas recirculation (FGR). However, none of these technologies were evaluated to be 

3-11 

 

appropriate for SSI units. SSI units do not use SCR or SNCR (Inventory Database, 2010). 
Additionally, there are no successful applications of SCR technology to waste-combustion units 
possibly because of the difficulties operating SCRs in operations where there is significant PM or 
sulfur loading in the gas stream. Application of SNCR also may not be technically feasible 
considering the combustion mechanisms of MH and FB units (U.S. EPA, 2003). Application of 
SNCR requires installation of a reagent injection system that is unlikely to work for existing SSI 
units. Additionally, SNCR is optimal for combustion units with high residence time and exit 
incinerator temperature, and less effective for lower uncontrolled NOx pollutant loadings (e.g., 
less than 200 ppm). Existing SSI units are not good matches for these considerations. FGR has 
been used on combustion devices to reduce NOx emissions. However, the amount of NOx 
reduced varies widely, ranging from 20% to 80%, and site-specific factors often affect the 
performance. To support regulations for SSI units, EPA collected emissions information on the 
nine Section 129 pollutants. One unit providing emission test data operates a MH unit with FGR. 
However, its emission levels are similar to units without FGR. Therefore, no conclusion could be 
made on FGR performance. Additionally, no FB units use any add-on NOx control because FB 
units can achieve low NOx emission levels, below 100 ppmv and many achieve below 70 ppmv.  

For control of CO, an add-on combustion device, such as an afterburner or thermal 

oxidizer, was analyzed as a more stringent control device that could be applied to SSI units. CO 
emissions data were collected from nine MH SSI units as part of the data collection efforts 
supporting the development of emission standards for SSI units. Table 3-1 summarizes the 
average CO concentration levels from these units (Facility, Unit, and Emissions Test Database, 
2010). The table is grouped into three classes of SSIs: (1) units that do not use any combustion 
controls, (2) units that use an on-hearth afterburner, and (3) units that use either a detached 
afterburner or thermal oxidizer or use FGR in combination with an on-hearth afterburner. 

Afterburner, or secondary chamber, retrofits include retrofitting an incinerator with a 

larger secondary chamber (with a longer gas residence time, for example, 2 seconds) and 
operating it at a higher temperature (e.g., 1,800°F). On-hearth afterburners are the top hearth of a 
MH unit that has been redesigned so that sludge is rerouted to the second hearth. Retrofitting the 
MH unit with an on-hearth afterburner may require modifications to downstream air pollution 
control systems because of higher temperatures and larger volumes of exhaust gases (Dangtran, 
Mullen, and Mayrose, 2000). Although there will be reductions in CO and total hydrocarbon 
(THC) emissions, the reductions may be limited because of low temperature and limited 
residence time of the gas in the afterburner stage. The use of FGR in combination with an on-
hearth afterburner shows significantly lower emissions levels than just using an on-hearth

afterburner. However, this may be a generalization because only one data point for this control 
combination was reviewed. Additionally, performance of FGR is often influenced by site-
specific parameters that may not be generalized to the entire subcategory. 

Table 3-1 shows that MH units using an add-on afterburner or thermal oxidizer can 

achieve CO emission levels less than 100 ppmv. The Clean Water Acts “503 Rule” [40CFR Part 
503] limits sewage sludge incinerators to 100 ppm THC as propane, dry basis, corrected to 7% 
oxygen, averaged for 30 days. The 503 Rule allows substitution of 100 ppm CO dry basis, 
corrected to 7% oxygen for the THC originally required. This allows the use of a lower cost, 
easier to maintain CO monitor in place of the THC monitor, which is difficult to keep online. To 
be consistent with the 503 regulations for disposal of sewage sludge, a value of 100 ppmv was 
used as the emission level that a MH unit with an afterburner could achieve. Because CO levels 
for FB units are below 100 ppmv, no afterburners were costed for this subcategory. 

3.2.2  Methodology Used to Estimate Cost and Emission Reductions 

The methodology used to calculate costs and emission reductions from applying the more 

stringent controls followed the procedures discussed in Section 3.1 and in the SSI cost 
memorandum (Cost and Emissions Reduction, 2010). As described above, if a unit already had a 
FF or needed one to meet the MACT floor limits, no additional costs for FF were calculated. 
Otherwise, a FF was costed out for the unit. Similar procedures were followed for PBS and ACI. 
The cost algorithms; inputs to the algorithms; and testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and 

3-13 

 

reporting costs calculations are the same as conducted for the MACT floor and are discussed in 
detail in the MACT floor cost and emission reductions memorandum. 

Emission reductions from applying the controls relative to the MACT floor limits were 
calculated using the following procedure. First, the reduction efficiency of the control for each 
pollutant was applied to the uncontrolled concentration to determine the total reduction the 
control would achieve. The reduction from uncontrolled levels to the MACT floor limits was 
previously calculated for the MACT floor cost and emission reduction analysis discussed in 
Section 3.1 and in a supporting memorandum (Cost and Emissions Reduction, 2010). For each 
pollutant, the incremental reduction between the more stringent control application and the 
MACT floor was calculated by subtracting the MACT floor concentration from the reduction 
achieved by the more stringent control. Reduction of PM2.5 was calculated assuming that controls 
applicable for PM would also reduce PM2.5. 

3.2.3  Selection of Regulatory Options 

Tables 3-2 and 3-3 summarize the costs, emission reductions, and incremental cost 

effectiveness of the controls analyzed in the BTF analysis, for the case where all entities comply 
(Table 3-2) and the case where small entities choose to landfill (Table 3-3). Tables 3-4 and 3-5 
present the results from Tables 3-2 and 3-3 on a per unit basis. The number of Fluidized Bed 
units requiring some sort of control to meet the MACT floors can be broken down as follows: 
Fabric Filter, 41 units; Afterburner Retrofit, 0 units; Packed Bed Scrubber, 7 units; and ACI, 51 
units.  The number of Multiple Hearth units requiring some sort of control to meet the MACT 
floors can be broken down as follows: Fabric Filter, 25 units; Afterburner Retrofit, 0 units; 
Packed Bed Scrubber, 11 units; and ACI, 2 units.  The total number of SSIs requiring some sort 
of control to meet the MACT floors can be broken down as follows: Fabric Filter, 66 units; 
Afterburner Retrofit, 0 units; Packed Bed Scrubber, 18 units; and ACI, 53 units.  The per unit 
values were calculated by dividing the costs and emissions reduction for each option by the 
number of SSI units that would require control for the option. The tables indicate that except for 
the afterburner, all of the controls applied result in a high incremental cost-effectiveness, greater 
than $70,000/ton. Consequently, these controls, with the exception of activation carbon injection 
for Hg control, were considered infeasible. Activated carbon injection was determined to provide 
significant reduction in Hg emissions at MH units. Therefore, the following control options were 
selected for further analysis:  

§  Option 1 is the MACT floor level of control for the two subcategories developed for 

existing SSI units, MH units and FB units. 

3-14 

 

§  Option 2 is the same as Option 1, with the addition of activated carbon injection for 

additional Hg emissions reduction from MH units. 

§  Option 3 is the same as Option 2, with the addition of an afterburner on all MH units 

for additional CO emissions reduction. 

Tables 3-6 and 3-7 summarize the costs, total emission reductions, and incremental cost-
effectiveness of the three options. Detailed costs and emission reductions for each SSI unit for 
the each option are presented in supporting memoranda

a. The number of Fluidized Bed units requiring some sort of control to meet the MACT floors can be broken down as follows: Fabric Filter, 41 units; Afterburner Retrofit, 0 units; Packed Bed Scrubber, 7 units; and ACI, 51 units. 
  The number of Multiple Hearth units requiring some sort of control to meet the MACT floors can be broken down as follows: Fabric Filter, 25 units; Afterburner Retrofit, 0 units; Packed Bed Scrubber, 11 units; and ACI, 2 units. 
  The total number of SSIs requiring some sort of control to meet the MACT floors can be broken down as follows: Fabric Filter, 66 units; Afterburner Retrofit, 0 units; Packed Bed Scrubber, 18 units; and ACI, 53 units. 
b. Emission reductions of zero are an artifact of the methodology used to conservatively estimate reductions, which was kept consistent for all pollutant controls. For other pollutants, reductions resulted from the installation of controls where 

improvement was needed in order to meet the proposed limit. For any case where the unit already met a pollutant limit, that MACT pollutant concentration was set equal to the baseline, based on the assumption that the unit would be able to at 
least achieve the limit. For CO, all FB units already met the limit, yielding a calculated reduction of zero for each unit.  

c. Although no additional ACI is required for beyond-the-floor control for FB units (hence no incremental cost), small reductions are calculated because for the BTF scenario, the maximum control efficiency (98%) was assumed. For the MACT 

floor scenario, only the percent reduction required to meet the floor limits were incorporated as the control efficiencies. 

d. The cost-effectiveness of ACI control for MH units is equivalent to $6,160 per pound of Hg reduced. 
e. The cost-effectiveness of ACI control for all units is equivalent to $6,150 per pound of Hg reduced. 
f. Costs were annualized using a discount rate of 7 percent

d. Emission reductions of zero are an artifact of the methodology used to conservatively estimate reductions, which was kept consistent for all pollutant controls. 

For other pollutants, reductions resulted from the installation of controls where improvement was needed in order to meet the proposed limit. For any case 
where the unit already met a pollutant limit, that MACT pollutant concentration was set equal to the baseline, based on the assumption that the unit would be 
able to at least achieve the limit. For CO, all FB units already met the limit, yielding a calculated reduction of zero for each unit.  

e. Although no additional ACI is required for beyond-the-floor control for FB units (hence no incremental cost), small reductions are calculated because for the 
BTF scenario, the maximum control efficiency (98%) was assumed. For the MACT floor scenario, only the percent reduction required to meet the floor limits 
were incorporated as the control efficiencies.

3.3 

Estimation of Impacts for New Units Constructed within 5 Years After 
Promulgation of the SSI NSPS 

3.3.1  Estimation of New Sources 

Several significant changes have occurred to SSI units in the past 20 years. EPA’s Office 

of Water (OW) set emission and discharge standards for sewage sludge disposal methods 
(including incineration) in 1993 (40 CFR part 503). As a result of the CWA part 503 Rule, many 
wastewater treatment facilities chose to use alternative methods for disposing of sewage sludge, 
such as landfilling or land application, rather than try to meet the incineration requirements. 
Many of the closed incinerators had been operated by municipalities or agencies serving smaller 
populations (i.e., fewer than 50,000 people) (Summary of Telephone Contacts, 2010).  

The general trend has also been for facilities still incinerating sewage sludge to replace 
older MH units with newer FB units because of better emissions performance, savings in fuel 
cost, and flexibility in operation. Since 1988, over 40 new FB systems have been installed, with 
11 replacing existing MH units (Dangtran, Mullen, and Mayrose, 2000). Discussions with the 
National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA), the industry trade group, indicated 
that only FB units are likely to be constructed in the future (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Consequently, it 
was assumed that any new units that would be built after promulgation of the NSPS would be a 
FB design. 

To estimate the number of new sources that might be constructed in the 5 years following 
promulgation of the NSPS, the number of sources being constructed 5 years prior to proposal of 
the rule was reviewed to determine if there was a trend. Under EPA’s New Source Review 
(NSR) program, if a company is planning to build a new plant or modify an existing plant such 
that air pollution emissions will increase by a large amount, then the company must obtain an 
NSR permit. The NSR permit is a construction permit that requires the company to minimize air 
pollution emissions by changing the process to prevent air pollution and/or installing air 
pollution control equipment. The NSR program defines control levels based on the type of 
program the source is subject to: reasonably available control technology (RACT), best available 
control technology (BACT), or lowest achievable emissions reduction (LAER). Information 
from the EPA’s RACT/BACT/LAER database contains case-specific information on the “best 
available” air pollution technologies that have been required to reduce the emission of air 
pollutants from stationary sources. This information has been provided by state and local 
permitting agencies. The database was searched for SSI units permitted or constructed since 
2005. The search results showed two FB units at the R.L. Sutton Water Reclamation facility in 
Georgia were permitted in 2005, and completed construction in 2008 and are currently in 

3-25 

 

operation. Additional information collected from state environmental agencies and permits 
indicated an additional three units at the Mill Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Ohio were 
expected to finish construction and be in operation in 2010 (Oommen and Allen, 2010a). All of 
these new FB units were replacements for MH units. 

Based on the data collected and assuming the trend in construction continues, five 

additional FB units will be permitted to be constructed in 5 years after the NSPS is proposed. 
However, given the time necessary to review and assess the requirements of the NSPS and plan, 
permit, and construct incineration units, it is unlikely that all five would be in operation in the 5 
years. For this analysis, it was assumed at least two new FB units would be constructed and in 
operation in this time period. 

3.3.2  Methodology Used to Estimate Cost and Emission Reductions of the MACT Floor 

Level of Control 

Cost and emission reductions for new units complying with the NSPS were calculated by 

(1) determining the controls that these units would most likely apply if the NSPS were not in 
place (referred to as the baseline level of control), (2) calculating the cost of complying with the 
NSPS emission levels, and (3) estimating the emissions reduction from complying with the 
NSPS emissions levels. Each of these steps is discussed in more detail. 

3.3.2.1 Determining Baseline Controls 

The baseline level of control that new units would likely implement (in the absence of the 

NSPS) was determined from reviewing the most common controls used at existing FB units, as 
shown in the SSI inventory memorandum (Inventory Database, 2010). Table 3-8 shows the 
distribution of controls. Based on this information, the baseline controls assumed for the new 
units are a combination of venturi scrubbers and impingement scrubbers. Data gathered on the 
controls currently used at FB units indicate that few FB units operate an afterburner, because 
their CO emissions are already low. However, to meet the new source floor limit, the analysis 
costs out an afterburner to reach the limit. In reality, new FB units that are constructed are likely 
to be designed to meet the CO level. Costing an afterburner provides a conservative estimate of 
costs. 

3.3.2.2 Calculating Baseline Emissions 

The SSI baseline emissions memorandum (Estimation of Baseline Emissions, 2010) 

documents the calculation of baseline emissions from existing FB SSI units. Baseline emissions 
were calculated on a mass basis by multiplying the concentration of the pollutant in the emission 
stream, flow rate of the emission stream, and the hours of operation of the SSI unit. For units

August 5, 2009. “SSI Inventory Updated Information.” 

where no emissions test data were collected, baseline emissions were estimated using an average 
uncontrolled concentration and applying reduction efficiencies associated with the control 
devices located at each SSI unit for each pollutant. 

An average flue gas flow rate factor was also developed for FB units relating the flue gas 

flow rate to the dry sludge feed rate from units providing emission test data. For units where 
sludge feed rates were not collected, unit capacities were multiplied by a capacity utilization 

3-27 

 

factor of 75%, which was the median of the capacity utilizations reported in the ICR survey 
responses. More information about how unit capacity values were obtained can be found in the 
SSI inventory database memorandum (Inventory Database, 2010). The flow rate of the flue gas 
stream was calculated by multiplying the dry sludge feed rate by the average flue gas flow rate 
factor.  

Based on the information gathered from RACT/BACT/LAER and permits, it is likely that 

new FB units constructed will be replacements for existing units. However, it cannot be 
determined how many units will be replaced at a facility or the total number of units that will be 
in operation at a facility. For this analysis, the simplest and most conservative assumption was 
used—that only one FB unit would be constructed replacing one older MH unit. The operating 
hours for facilities operating one unit were assumed to be 8,400 hours per year (incorporating 
two weeks’ downtime). 

Table 3-9 shows the average concentration factors, average dry sludge capacity, and 

operating hours, as well as other default parameters necessary for the costs. These factors were 
applied to each new unit estimated to be constructed within the next 5 years. Table 3-10 shows 
the estimated baseline concentrations for new units. 

Calculating Costs and Emission Reductions 

Costs were calculated using the procedures and algorithms discussed in the memorandum 

“Cost and Emissions Reduction of Complying with the MACT Floor for Existing SSI Units” 
(Oommen and Allen, 2010b). Control devices costed out were those that would be necessary to 
meet the MACT floor level of control for new sources. It is possible for some units with wet 
scrubbers to comply with the NSPS limits for SO2 by adding caustic. However, it is uncertain if 
all units could do this. Therefore, this analysis assumed a PBS would be used, which would 
provide a more conservative estimate of costs. Similarly, wet electrostatic precipitators can be 
used for PM control; a FF was costed in this analysis to provide a conservative estimate of costs.  

Table 3-11 shows the comparison of baseline emissions levels to MACT floor levels to 
determine the amount of pollutant reduction needed and the types of control devices that would 
be used to meet the levels. Emission reductions from applying the MACT floor requirements to 
the baseline emission levels are presented in Table 3-10. The inputs to the cost algorithm are 
presented in Table 3-9. For this analysis, it was assumed that controls applicable for PM would 
also reduce PM2.5.

3.3.3  Analysis of Beyond the Floor Options 

The control technologies costed to achieve the MACT floor levels are generally the most 

effective controls available: FFs for PM, Cd, Pb; ACI for Hg and CDD/CDF; afterburners for 
CO; and PBSs for HCl and SO2. In addition, incremental additions of activated carbon have not 
been proven to achieve further reductions above the projected flue gas concentration estimated to 
achieve the limits for new sources. Data gathered do not indicate that any FB units operate NOx 
controls, such as SNCR, SCR, or flue gas recirculation because the NOx emissions are already 
low. Therefore, no BTF options were analyzed for this analysis because we are not aware of any 
technologies or methods to achieve emission limits more stringent than the MACT floor limits 
for new units, which are based on the lowest emitting FB units.

SECTION 4 

 

ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 

EPA has prepared an EIA to provide decision makers with a measure of the social costs 
of using resources to comply with the proposed greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements. 
As noted in EPA’s (2000) Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses, several tools are 
available to estimate social costs and range from simple direct compliance cost methods to the 
development of a more complex market analysis that estimates market changes (e.g., price and 
consumption) and economic welfare changes (e.g., changes in consumer and producer surplus). 
Because the proposed regulatory option affects governmental entities (96 of the 97 owners are 
governmental entities) providing services not provided in a market, the Office of Air Quality 
Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has used the direct compliance cost method as a measure of 
social costs. Since no market impacts are anticipated, the economic analysis focused on the 
comparison of control cost to total governmental revenue. 

The EIA evaluates three options discussed in Section 3:  

§  Option 1 is the MACT floor level of control for the two subcategories developed for 

existing SSI units, MH units and FB units. 

§  Option 2 is the same as Option 1, with the addition of activated carbon injection for 

additional Hg emissions reduction from MH units. 

§  Option 3 is the same as Option 2, with the addition of an afterburner on all MH units 

for additional CO emissions reduction. 

Within each option, EPA presents the results of the cost analysis using two assumptions: 

§  Large government entities comply and incinerate while small government entities 
choose to landfill. EPA anticipates this is the most likely response to the regulation 
based on analysis of landfilling costs and interviews with a sample of small 
government entities. 

§  All government entities (small and large) comply and incinerate. EPA anticipates this 
assumption significantly overstates the rule’s costs because it assumes small entities 
do not consider other disposal options. 

4.1 

Social Cost Estimates  

EPA has estimated compliance costs for all existing units to add the necessary controls, 

monitoring equipment, inspections, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements to comply 
with the proposed SSI standards. Based on the engineering cost analysis, we anticipate the 

4-1 

 

overall total annual social cost to be approximately $92 million. The lowest cost option is the 
MACT floor where large entities comply and small entities landfill ($63 million). The highest 
cost option is the MACT floor with afterburners and fabric filters for MH units and all entities 
comply ($151 million). All cost options are displayed in Table 4-1.

Small Entity Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a 

regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking 
requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency 
certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities (SISNOSE). The first step in this assessment was to determine whether the rule 
will have SISNOSE. To make this determination, EPA used a screening analysis to indicate 
whether EPA can certify the rule as not having a SISNOSE. The elements of this analysis 
included 

§ 

§ 

identifying affected small entities, 

selecting and describing the measures and economic impact thresholds used in the 
analysis, and 

§  completing the assessment and determining the SISNOSE certification category. 

4-2 

 

4.2.1  Identify Affected Small Entities 

For the purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, small 

entity is defined as (1) a small business as defined by the Small Business Administration’s 
regulations at 13 CFR 121.20; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a 
city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and 
(3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and 
operated and is not dominant in its field. As reported in Section 2, EPA has identified 18 small 
entities that have a population of fewer than 50,000. There are no small businesses or 
organizations affected by the proposed rule. 

4.2.2  Screening Analysis: Revenue Test 

In the next step of the analysis, EPA compared each regulatory option’s control costs to 

total government revenues (i.e., a “revenue” test). To estimate government revenues, we 
collected U.S. Census financial information for municipal governments by population ranges, 
computed average per capita revenues for each population range, and multiplied the per capita 
revenue figure by the population served by small and large government entities (Table 4-2).

Each option’s screening results under two disposal assumptions are presented in Tables 

4-3 through Table 4-8. As noted above, EPA anticipates small government entities will most 
likely switch from incineration to landfilling (Tables 4-4, 4-6, and 4-8). EPA has also presented 
small entity results where small entities comply and incinerate (Tables 4-3, 4-5, and 4-7). 
However, EPA anticipates this assumption would significantly overstate the rule’s small entity 
impacts because it assumes small entities continue to incinerate and do not consider other less 
expensive disposal options. 

4-3 

 

Based on the engineering cost analysis, EPA anticipates the overall total annualized cost 

for the selection option will be $92 million (Option 2: MACT floor with activated carbon 
injection for MH, large entities comply and small entities landfill); under this option and set of 
disposal choices, all small entities are affected at less than 1% revenues (Table 4-6).  

For the lowest cost Option 1, the MACT floor where large entities comply and small 

entities landfill (total annualized costs = $63 million), all small entities are affected at less than 
1% revenue (Table 4-4).  

For the highest cost Option 3, the MACT floor with activated carbon injection and 

afterburners for MH units and small entities landfill (total annualized cost = $132 million). All 
small entities are still affected at less than 1% revenue (Table 4-8).

HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 

SECTION 5 

 

5.1 

Synopsis 
In this section, we provide an estimate of the monetized benefits associated with reducing 

particulate matter (PM) for the proposed Sewage Sludge Incinerator (SSI) New Source 
Performance Standard (NSPS) and Emissions Guidelines (EG). For this rule, the PM reductions 
are the result of emission limits on PM, emission limits on PM2.5 precursors such as NOx and 
SO2, as well as emission limits on other pollutants. The total PM2.5 reductions are the 
consequence of the technologies installed or waste diversion to meet these multiple limits. These 
estimates reflect the monetized human health benefits of reducing cases of morbidity and 
premature mortality among populations exposed to the PM2.5 precursors reduced by this 
rulemaking. Using a 3% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized benefits including energy 
disbenefits of the proposed SSI NSPS and EG to be $130 million to $320 million in the 
implementation year (2015). Using a 7% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized benefits 
including energy disbenefits of the proposed SSI NSPS and EG to be $120 million to $290 
million in the implementation year. All estimates are in 2008$.  

These estimates reflect EPA’s most current interpretation of the scientific literature. 

Higher or lower estimates of benefits are possible using other assumptions; examples of this are 
provided in Figure 5-2. Data, resource, and methodological limitations prevented EPA from 
monetizing the benefits from several important benefit categories, including benefits from 
reducing hazardous air pollutants, ecosystem effects, and visibility impairment. The benefits 
from reducing other air pollutants have not been monetized in this analysis, including reducing 
2,900 tons of CO, 96 tons of HCl, 3.0 tons of Pb, 1.6 tons of Cd, 5,500 pounds of mercury (Hg), 
and 90 grams of total dioxins/furans (CDD/CDF) each year. 

5.2 

Calculation of PM2.5 Human Health Benefits 
This rulemaking would reduce emissions of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2. Because SOx and NO2 
are also precursors to PM2.5, reducing these emissions would also reduce PM2.5 formation, human 
exposure, and the incidence of PM2.5-related health effects. For this rule, the PM reductions are 
the result of emission limits on PM, emission limits on PM2.5 precursors such as NOx and SO2, as 
well as emission limits on other pollutants. The total PM2.5 reductions are the consequence of the 
technologies installed or waste diversion to meet these multiple limits. Due to analytical 
limitations, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive estimate of PM2.5-related benefits. 
Instead, we used the “benefit-per-ton” approach to estimate these benefits based on the 

5-1 

 

methodology described in Fann, Fulcher, and Hubbell (2009). The key assumptions are 
described in detail below. These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton estimates provide the total monetized 
human health benefits (the sum of premature mortality and premature morbidity) of reducing one 
ton of PM2.5 from a specified source. EPA has used the benefit per-ton technique in several 
previous RIAs, including the recent NO2 NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2010b). Table 5-1 shows the 
quantified and unquantified benefits captured in those benefit-per-ton estimates.

Consistent with the Portland Cement NESHAP (U.S. EPA, 2009a), the PM2.5 benefits 

estimates utilize the concentration-response functions as reported in the epidemiology literature, 
as well as the 12 functions obtained in EPA’s expert elicitation study as a sensitivity analysis.  

§  One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed from 
the extended analysis of American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort, as reported in Pope 
et al. (2002), a study that EPA has previously used to generate its primary benefits 
estimate.  When calculating the estimate, EPA applied the effect coefficient as 
reported in the study without an adjustment for assumed concentration threshold of 10 
µg/m3 as was done in recent (2006-2009) Office of Air and Radiation RIAs. 

§  One estimate is based on the C-R function developed from the extended analysis of 

the Harvard Six Cities cohort, as reported by Laden et al. (2006). This study, 
published after the completion of the Staff Paper for the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS, has 
been used as an alternative estimate in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and PM2.5 benefits 
estimates in RIAs completed since the PM2.5 NAAQS. When calculating the estimate, 
EPA applied the effect coefficient as reported in the study without an adjustment for 
assumed concentration threshold of 10 µg/m3 as was done in recent (2006-2009) 
RIAs.

§  Twelve estimates are based on the C-R functions from EPA’s expert elicitation study 
(IEc, 2006; Roman et al., 2008) on the PM2.5 -mortality relationship and interpreted 
for benefits analysis in EPA’s final RIA for the PM2.5 NAAQS. For that study, twelve 
experts (labeled A through L) provided independent estimates of the PM2.5 -mortality 
concentration-response function. EPA practice has been to develop independent 
estimates of PM2.5 -mortality estimates corresponding to the concentration-response 
function provided by each of the twelve experts, to better characterize the degree of 
variability in the expert responses. 

The effect coefficients are drawn from epidemiology studies examining two large 

population cohorts: the American Cancer Society cohort (Pope et al., 2002) and the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort (Laden et al., 2006).1 These are logical choices for anchor points in our presentation 
because, while both studies are well designed and peer reviewed, there are strengths and 
weaknesses inherent in each, which we believe argues for using both studies to generate benefits 
estimates. Previously, EPA had calculated benefits based on these two empirical studies, but 
derived the range of benefits, including the minimum and maximum results, from an expert 
elicitation of the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and premature mortality (Roman et al., 
2008).2 Within this assessment, we include the benefits estimates derived from the concentration-
response function provided by each of the twelve experts to better characterize the uncertainty in 
the concentration-response function for mortality and the degree of variability in the expert 
responses. Because the experts used these cohort studies to inform their concentration-response 
functions, benefits estimates using these functions generally fall between results using these 
epidemiology studies (see Figure 5-2). In general, the expert elicitation results support the 
conclusion that the benefits of PM2.5 control are very likely to be substantial. 

Readers interested in reviewing the general methodology for creating the benefit-per-ton 
estimates used in this analysis should consult Fann, Fulcher, and Hubbell (2009). As described in 
Fann, Fulcher, and Hubbell (2009), benefit-per-ton estimates are developed for selected 
pollutant/source category combinations. The per-ton values calculated therefore apply only to 
tons reduced from those specific pollutant/source combinations (e.g., SO2 emitted from electric 
generating units; NO2 emitted from mobile sources). In this analysis, we apply the national 
average benefit-per-ton estimate for a 2015 analysis year and multiply it by the corresponding 
emission reductions of directly emitted PM2.5, SO2, and NOx to quantify the benefits of this rule. 
The benefit-per-ton estimates found in Fann, Fulcher, and Hubbell (2009) reflect a specifc set of 
key assumptions and input data.  As we update these underlying assumptions to reflect the 

                                                
1These two studies specify multi-pollutant models that control for SO2, among other pollutants.

change in the presentation of benefits estimates.

scientific literature, we re-estimate the benefit-per-ton estimates and post the updated estimates 
at http://www.epa.gov/air/benmap/bpt.html.  In addition, we adjust these estimates to match the 
currency year for the costs in this analysis.   

These models assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 

equally potent in causing premature mortality because there is no clear scientific evidence that 
would support the development of differential effects estimates by particle type. Directly emitted 
PM, SO2, and NOx are the primary PM2.5 precursors affected by this rule. Even though we 
assume that all fine particles have equivalent health effects, the benefit-per-ton estimates vary 
between precursors because each ton of precursor reduced has a different propensity to form 
PM2.5. For example, NOX has a lower benefit-per-ton estimate than direct PM2.5 because it does 
not form as much PM2.5, thus the exposure would be lower, and the monetized health co-benefits 
would be lower.  

The benefit-per-ton coefficients in this analysis were derived using modified versions of 
the health impact functions used in the PM NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis. Specifically, 
this analysis uses the benefit-per-ton method first applied in the Portland Cement NESHAP RIA 
(U.S. EPA, 2009a), which incorporated three updates: a new population dataset, an expanded 
geographic scope of the benefit-per-ton calculation, and the functions directly from the 
epidemiology studies without an adjustment for an assumed threshold.3 Removing the threshold 
assumption is a key difference between the method used in this analysis of PM benefits and the 
methods used in RIAs prior to Portland Cement, and we now calculate incremental benefits 
down to the lowest modeled PM2.5 air quality levels.  

EPA strives to use the best available science to support our benefits analyses, and we 
recognize that interpretation of the science regarding air pollution and health is dynamic and 
evolving. Based on our review of the current body of scientific literature, EPA now estimates 
PM-related mortality without applying an assumed concentration threshold. EPA’s Integrated 
Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2009b), which was recently reviewed by 
EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2009b), concluded that the scientific literature consistently finds that a no-threshold log-linear 
model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship while 
recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape of the concentration-response function. 
Since then, the Health Effects Subcommittee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010) of EPA’s Council 

                                                
3The benefit-per-ton estimates have also been updated since the Cement RIA to incorporate a revised VSL, as 

discussed on the next page.

concluded, “The HES fully supports EPA’s decision to use a no-threshold model to estimate 
mortality reductions. This decision is supported by the data, which are quite consistent in 
showing effects down to the lowest measured levels. Analyses of cohorts using data from more 
recent years, during which time PM concentrations have fallen, continue to report strong 
associations with mortality. Therefore, there is no evidence to support a truncation of the CRF.” 
In conjunction with the underlying scientific literature, this document provided a basis for 
reconsidering the application of thresholds in PM2.5 concentration-response functions used in 
EPA’s RIAs. For a summary of these scientific review statements and the panel members 
commenting on thresholds since 2002, please consult the Technical Support Document (TSD) 
Summary of Expert Opinions on the Existence of a Threshold (U.S. EPA, 2010c), which is 
provided as an appendix to this RIA. 

Consistent with this recent scientific advice, we are replacing the previous threshold 

sensitivity analysis with a new “Lowest Measured Level” (LML) assessment. This information 
allows readers to determine the portion of population exposed to annual mean PM2.5 levels at or 
above the LML of each study; in general, our confidence in the estimated PM mortality 
decreases as we consider air quality levels further below the LML in major cohort studies that 
estimate PM-related mortality. While an LML assessment provides some insight into the level of 
uncertainty in the estimated PM mortality benefits, EPA does not view the LML as a threshold 
and continues to quantify PM-related mortality impacts using a full range of modeled air quality 
concentrations. It is important to emphasize that we have high confidence in PM2.5-related effects 
down to the lowest LML of the major cohort studies. Just because we have greater confidence in 
the benefits above the LML, this does not mean that we have no confidence that benefits occur 
below the LML. 

For this analysis, policy-specific air quality data is not available due to time or resource 

limitations. For these rules, we are unable to estimate the percentage of premature mortality 
associated with this specific rule’s emission reductions at each PM2.5 level. However, we believe 
that it is still important to characterize the distribution of exposure to baseline air quality levels. 
As a surrogate measure of mortality impacts, we provide the percentage of the population 
exposed at each PM2.5 level using the most recent modeling available from the recently proposed 
Transport Rule (U.S. EPA, 2010e). It is important to note that baseline exposure is only one 
parameter in the health impact function, along with baseline incidence rates population, and 
change in air quality. In other words, the percentage of the population exposed to air pollution 
below the LML is not the same as the percentage of the population experiencing health impacts 
as a result of a specific emission reduction policy. The most important aspect, which we are 

5-5 

 

unable to quantify for rules without air quality modeling, is the shift in exposure associated with 
this specific rule. Therefore, caution is warranted when interpreting the LML assessment. For 
more information on the data and conclusions in the LML assessment for rules without policy-
specific air quality modeling, please consult the LML TSD (U.S. EPA, 2010d), which is 
provided as an appendix to this RIA. The results of this analysis are provided in Section 5.4. 

As is the nature of Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs), the assumptions and methods 

used to estimate air quality benefits evolve over time to reflect the Agency’s most current 
interpretation of the scientific and economic literature. For a period of time (2004–2008), the 
Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) valued mortality risk reductions using a value of statistical 
life (VSL) estimate derived from a limited analysis of some of the available studies. OAR arrived 
at a VSL using a range of $1 million to $10 million (2000$) consistent with two meta-analyses of 
the wage-risk literature. The $1 million value represented the lower end of the interquartile range 
from the Mrozek and Taylor (2002) meta-analysis of 33 studies. The $10 million value 
represented the upper end of the interquartile range from the Viscusi and Aldy (2003) meta-
analysis of 43 studies. The mean estimate of $5.5 million (2000$)4 was also consistent with the 
mean VSL of $5.4 million estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006) meta-analysis. However, the 
Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected 
the interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board 
(SAB) or other peer-review group.  

During this time, the Agency continued work to update its guidance on valuing mortality 

risk reductions, including commissioning a report from meta-analytic experts to evaluate 
methodological questions raised by EPA and the SAB on combining estimates from the various 
data sources. In addition, the Agency consulted several times with the Science Advisory Board 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) on the issue. With input from the 
meta-analytic experts, the SAB-EEAC advised the Agency to update its guidance using specific, 
appropriate meta-analytic techniques to combine estimates from unique data sources and 
different studies, including those using different methodologies (i.e., wage-risk and stated 
preference) (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2007).  

Until updated guidance is available, the Agency determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the SAB-EEAC advice it has received. Therefore, the 
Agency has decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the Guidelines 

                                                
4 After adjusting the VSL to account for a different currency year (2008$) and to account for income growth to 

2015, the $5.5 million VSL is $7.9 million.

for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)5 while the Agency continues its efforts to 
update its guidance on this issue. This approach calculates a mean value across VSL estimates 
derived from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 and 
1991. The mean VSL across these studies is $6.3 million (2000$).6 The Agency is committed to 
using scientifically sound, appropriately reviewed evidence in valuing mortality risk reductions 
and has made significant progress in responding to the SAB-EEAC’s specific recommendations.

7To comply with Circular A-4, EPA provides monetized benefits using discount rates of 3% and 7% (OMB, 2003). 
These benefits are estimated for a specific analysis year (i.e., 2015), and most of the PM benefits occur within that 
year with two exceptions: acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) and premature mortality. For AMIs, we assume 5 
years of follow-up medical costs and lost wages. For premature mortality, we assume that there is a “cessation” 
lag between PM exposures and the total realization of changes in health effects. Although the structure of the lag 
is uncertain, EPA follows the advice of the SAB-HES to assume a segmented lag structure characterized by 30% 
of mortality reductions in the first year, 50% over years 2 to 5, and 20% over the years 6 to 20 after the reduction 
in PM2.5 (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004). Changes in the lag assumptions do not change the total number of estimated 
deaths but rather the timing of those deaths. Therefore, discounting only affects the AMI costs after the analysis 
year and the valuation of premature mortalities that occur after the analysis year. As such, the monetized benefits 
using a 7% discount rate are only approximately 10% less than the monetized benefits using a 3% discount rate.

a All estimates are for the implementation year (2015), and are rounded to two significant figures so numbers may 
not sum across columns. All fine particles are assumed to have equivalent health effects, but the benefit per ton 
estimates vary because each ton of precursor reduced has a different propensity to form PM2.5. The monetized 
benefits incorporate the conversion from precursor emissions to ambient fine particles. These results include 2 
new FB incinerators anticipated to come online by 2015. These estimates do not include energy disbenefits valued 
at $0.5 million at a 3% discount rate for CO2 emissions.

Energy Disbenefits 
Electricity usage associated with the operation of control devices is anticipated to 

increase emissions of pollutants from utility boilers that supply electricity to the sewage sludge 
incinerators. For example, increased scrubber pump horsepower and sorbent injection controls 
may cause slight increases in electricity consumption. We estimate that the increased electricity 
consumption associated with the proposed option would be 12 million kWh if all entities 
comply, and 12 million kWh if the small entities landfill. Using national emission factors from 
eGRID for electrical generating units (EGUs), we estimate the increased emissions to be 19,000 
tpy of CO2 for the proposed option assuming that small entities landfill.8 Since NOx and SO2 are 
covered by capped emissions trading programs, we are only estimating the CO2 emission 
increases from the increased electricity demand.   The methodology used to calculate these

which results in additional emissions of CO2, CO, and NOx.   The CO2 energy disbenefits for Option 3 are 
shown in Tables 5-7 and 5-8.  The additional NOx disbenefits (as a precursor to PM2.5 using the methodolology 
described in Section 5.2) for Option 3 are $0.4 million to $0.9 million, which do not affect the rounded benefits 
results.

5.3.1  Social Cost of Carbon and Greenhouse Gas Disbenefits 

EPA has assigned a dollar value to reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using 
recent estimates of the “social cost of carbon” (SCC). The SCC is an estimate of the monetized 
damages associated with an incremental increase in carbon emissions in a given year. It is 
intended to include (but is not limited to) changes in net agricultural productivity, human health, 
property damages from increased flood risk, and the value of ecosystem services due to climate 
change. The SCC estimates used in this analysis were developed through an interagency process 
that included EPA and other executive branch entities, and concluded in February 2010. EPA 
first used these SCC estimates in the benefits analysis for the final joint EPA/DOT Rulemaking 
to establish Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy Standards; see the rule’s preamble for discussion about application of SCC (75 
FR 25324; 5/7/10). The SCC Technical Support Document (SCC TSD) provides a complete 
discussion of the methods used to develop these SCC estimates.9  

The interagency group selected four SCC values for use in regulatory analyses, which we 
have applied in this analysis: $5, $21, $35, and $65 per metric ton of CO2 emissions10 in 2010, in 
2007 dollars. The first three values are based on the average SCC from three integrated 
assessment models, at discount rates of 2.5, 3, and 5 percent, respectively. SCCs at several 
discount rates are included because the literature shows that the SCC is quite sensitive to 
assumptions about the discount rate, and because no consensus exists on the appropriate rate to 
use in an intergenerational context. The fourth value is the 95th percentile of the SCC from all 
three models at a 3 percent discount rate. It is included to represent higher-than-expected impacts 
from temperature change further out in the tails of the SCC distribution. Low probability, high 
impact events are incorporated into all of the SCC values through explicit consideration of their 
effects in two of the three models as well as the use of a probability density function for 

                                                
9 Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0472-114577, Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon for 

Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866, Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of 
Carbon, with participation by Council of Economic Advisers, Council on Environmental Quality, Department of 
Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental 
Protection Agency, National Economic Council, Office of Energy and Climate Change, Office of Management 
and Budget, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Department of Treasury (February 2010). Also 
available at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/regulations.htm 

10 The interagency group decided that these estimates apply only to CO2 emissions. Given that warming profiles and 

impacts other than temperature change (e.g. ocean acidification) vary across GHGs, the group concluded 
“transforming gases into CO2-equivalents using GWP, and then multiplying the carbon-equivalents by the SCC, 
would not result in accurate estimates of the social costs of non-CO2 gases” (SCC TSD, pg 13).

equilibrium climate sensitivity. Treating climate sensitivity probabilistically results in more high 
temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher projections of damages. 

The SCC increases over time because future emissions are expected to produce larger 
incremental damages as physical and economic systems become more stressed in response to 
greater climatic change. Note that the interagency group estimated the growth rate of the SCC 
directly using the three integrated assessment models rather than assuming a constant annual 
growth rate. This helps to ensure that the estimates are internally consistent with other modeling 
assumptions.  The SCC estimates for the analysis years of 2015, in 2008$ are provided in Table 
5-6. 

When attempting to assess the incremental economic impacts of carbon dioxide 

emissions, the analyst faces a number of serious challenges. A recent report from the National 
Academies of Science (NRC, 2008) points out that any assessment will suffer from uncertainty, 
speculation, and lack of information about (1) future emissions of greenhouse gases, (2) the 
effects of past and future emissions on the climate system, (3) the impact of changes in climate 
on the physical and biological environment, and (4) the translation of these environmental 
impacts into economic damages. As a result, any effort to quantify and monetize the harms 
associated with climate change will raise serious questions of science, economics, and ethics and 
should be viewed as provisional.  

The interagency group noted a number of limitations to the SCC analysis, including the 

incomplete way in which the integrated assessment models capture catastrophic and non-
catastrophic impacts, their incomplete treatment of adaptation and technological change, 
uncertainty in the extrapolation of damages to high temperatures, and assumptions regarding risk 
aversion. The limited amount of research linking climate impacts to economic damages makes 
the interagency modeling exercise even more difficult. The interagency group hopes that over 
time researchers and modelers will work to fill these gaps and that the SCC estimates used for 
regulatory analysis by the Federal government will continue to evolve with improvements in 
modeling. Additional details on these limitations are discussed in the SCC TSD. 

In light of these limitations, the interagency group has committed to updating the current 

estimates as the science and economic understanding of climate change and its impacts on 
society improves over time. Specifically, the interagency group has set a preliminary goal of 
revisiting the SCC values within two years or at such time as substantially updated models 
become available, and to continue to support research in this area.

Applying the global SCC estimates to the estimated increases in CO2 emissions for the 

range of policy scenarios, we estimate the dollar value of the climate-related disbenefits captured 
by the models for each analysis year. For internal consistency, the annual disbenefits are 
discounted back to NPV terms using the same discount rate as each SCC estimate (i.e. 5%, 3%, 
and 2.5%) rather than 3% and 7%.11 These estimates are provided in Tables 5-7 and 5-8.

5.4 

Unquantified Benefits 

The monetized benefits estimated in this RIA only reflect the portion of benefits 

attributable to the health effect reductions associated with ambient fine particles. Data, resource, 
and methodological limitations prevented EPA from quantifying or monetizing the benefits from 
several important benefit categories, including benefits from reducing toxic emissions, 
ecosystem effects, and visibility impairment. The health benefits from reducing hazardous air 
pollutants (HAPs) and carbon monoxide have not been monetized in this analysis. In addition to 
being a PM2.5 precursor, SO2 emissions also contribute to adverse effects from acidic deposition 
in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, increased mercury methylation, as well as visibility 
impairment. The benefits from reducing other air pollutants that have not been monetized in this 
analysis including 2,900 tons of carbon monoxide, 96 tons of HCl, 3.0 tons of lead, 1.6 tons of 
cadmium, 5,500 pounds of mercury, and 90 grams of total dioxins/furans each year. 

5.4.1  Carbon Monoxide Benefits 

Carbon monoxide (CO) exposure is associated with a variety of health effects. Without 
knowing the location of the emission reductions and the resulting ambient concentrations using 
fine-scale air quality modeling, we were unable to estimate the exposure to CO for nearby 
populations. Due to data, resource, and methodological limitations, we were unable to estimate 
the benefits associated with the reductions of CO emissions that would occur as a result of this 
rule.  

Carbon monoxide in ambient air is formed primarily by the incomplete combustion of 

carbon-containing fuels and photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. The amount of CO 
emitted from these reactions, relative to carbon dioxide (CO2), is sensitive to conditions in the 
combustion zone, such as fuel oxygen content, burn temperature, or mixing time. Upon 
inhalation, CO diffuses through the respiratory system to the blood, which can cause hypoxia 
(reduced oxygen availability). Carbon monoxide can elicit a broad range of effects in multiple 
tissues and organ systems that are dependent upon concentration and duration of exposure.  

The Integrated Science Assessment for Carbon Monoxide (U.S. EPA, 2010a) concluded 

that short-term exposure to CO is “likely to have a causal relationship” with cardiovascular 
morbidity, particularly in individuals with coronary heart disease. Epidemiologic studies 
associate short-term CO exposure with increased risk of emergency department visits and 

5-19 

 

hospital admissions. Coronary heart disease includes those who have angina pectoris (cardiac 
chest pain), as well as those who have experienced a heart attack. Other subpopulations 
potentially at risk include individuals with diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), anemia, or diabetes, and individuals in very early or late life stages, such as 
older adults or the developing young. The evidence is suggestive of a causal relationship 
between short-term exposure to CO and respiratory morbidity and mortality. The evidence is also 
suggestive of a causal relationship for birth outcomes and developmental effects following long-
term exposure to CO, and for central nervous system effects linked to short- and long-term 
exposure to CO.  

5.4.2  Other SO2 Benefits 

In addition to being a precursor to PM2.5, SO2 emissions are also associated with a variety 

of respiratory health effects. Unfortunately, we were unable to estimate the health benefits 
associated with reduced SO2 exposure in this analysis because we do not have air quality 
modeling data available. Without knowing the location of the emission reductions and the 
resulting ambient concentrations, we were unable to estimate the exposure to SO2 for nearby 
populations. Therefore, this analysis only quantifies and monetizes the PM2.5 benefits associated 
with the reductions in SO2 emissions.  

Following an extensive evaluation of health evidence from epidemiologic and laboratory 
studies, the U.S. EPA has concluded that there is a causal relationship between respiratory health 
effects and short-term exposure to SO2 (U.S. EPA, 2008). According to summary of the ISA in 
EPA’s risk and exposure assessment (REA) for the SO2 NAAQS, “the immediate effect of SO2 
on the respiratory system in humans is bronchoconstriction” (U.S. EPA, 2009c). In addition, the 
REA summarized from the ISA that “asthmatics are more sensitive to the effects of SO2 likely 
resulting from preexisting inflammation associated with this disease.” A clear concentration-
response relationship has been demonstrated in laboratory studies following exposures to SO2 at 
concentrations between 20 and 100 ppb, both in terms of increasing severity of effect and 
percentage of asthmatics adversely affected (U.S. EPA, 2009c). Based on our review of this 
information, we identified four short-term morbidity endpoints that the SO2 ISA identified as a 
“causal relationship”: asthma exacerbation, respiratory-related emergency department visits, and 
respiratory-related hospitalizations. The differing evidence and associated strength of the 
evidence for these different effects is described in detail in the SO2 ISA. The SO2 ISA also 
concluded that the relationship between short-term SO2 exposure and premature mortality was 
“suggestive of a causal relationship” because it is difficult to attribute the mortality risk effects to 
SO2 alone. Although the SO2 ISA stated that studies are generally consistent in reporting a 

5-20 

 

relationship between SO2 exposure and mortality, there was a lack of robustness of the observed 
associations to adjustment for pollutants.  

SO2 emissions also contribute to adverse welfare effects from acidic deposition, visibility 
impairment, and enhanced mercury methylation. Deposition of sulfur causes acidification, which 
can cause a loss of biodiversity of fishes, zooplankton, and macro invertebrates in aquatic 
ecosystems, as well as a decline in sensitive tree species, such as red spruce (Picea rubens) and 
sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in terrestrial ecosystems. In the northeastern United States, the 
surface waters affected by acidification are a source of food for some recreational and 
subsistence fishermen and for other consumers and support several cultural services, including 
aesthetic and educational services and recreational fishing. Biological effects of acidification in 
terrestrial ecosystems are generally linked to aluminum toxicity, which can cause reduced root 
growth, which restricts the ability of the plant to take up water and nutrients. These direct effects 
can, in turn, increase the sensitivity of these plants to stresses, such as droughts, cold 
temperatures, insect pests, and disease leading to increased mortality of canopy trees. Terrestrial 
acidification affects several important ecological services, including declines in habitat for 
threatened and endangered species (cultural), declines in forest aesthetics (cultural), declines in 
forest productivity (provisioning), and increases in forest soil erosion and reductions in water 
retention (cultural and regulating) (U.S. EPA, 2008d). 

Reducing SO2 emissions and the secondary formation of PM2.5 would improve the level 

of visibility throughout the United States. Fine particles with significant light-extinction 
efficiencies include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and soil (Sisler, 1996). 
These suspended particles and gases degrade visibility by scattering and absorbing light. Higher 
visibility impairment levels in the East are due to generally higher concentrations of fine 
particles, particularly sulfates, and higher average relative humidity levels. In fact, particulate 
sulfate is the largest contributor to regional haze in the eastern U.S. (i.e., 40% or more annually 
and 75% during summer). In the western U.S., particulate sulfate contributes to 20-50% of 
regional haze (U.S. EPA, 2009c). Visibility has direct significance to people’s enjoyment of 
daily activities and their overall sense of wellbeing. Good visibility increases the quality of life 
where individuals live and work, and where they engage in recreational activities.  

5.4.3  HAP Benefits 

Due to data, resource, and methodology limitations, we were unable to estimate the 
benefits associated with the hazardous air pollutants that would be reduced as a result of this 
rule. Available emissions data show that several different HAPs are emitted from SSI. This rule 

5-21 

 

is anticipated to reduce 96 tons of HCl, 3.0 tons of lead, 1.6 tons of cadmium, 5,500 pounds of 
mercury, and 90 grams of total dioxins/furans each year. In the absence of air quality modeling 
and/or concentration-response functions, we are unable to quantify the magnitude of the 
reduction in human exposure to these pollutants associated with the emission reductions from 
this rule.   

5.4.3.1 Mercury 

Mercury is a highly neurotoxic contaminant that enters the food web as a methylated 

compound, methylmercury (U.S. EPA, 2008d). The contaminant is concentrated in higher 
trophic levels, including fish eaten by humans. Experimental evidence has established that only 
inconsequential amounts of methylmercury can be produced in the absence of sulfate (U.S. EPA, 
2008d). Current evidence indicates that in watersheds where mercury is present, increased sulfate 
deposition very likely results in methylmercury accumulation in fish (Drevnick et al., 2007; 
Munthe et al, 2007). The SO2 ISA concluded that evidence is sufficient to infer a casual 
relationship between sulfur deposition and increased mercury methylation in wetlands and 
aquatic environments (U.S. EPA, 2008d).  

In addition to the role of sulfate deposition on methylation, this proposed rule would also 

reduce mercury emissions. Mercury is emitted to the air from various man-made and natural 
sources. These emissions transport through the atmosphere and eventually deposit to land or 
water bodies. This deposition can occur locally, regionally, or globally, depending on the form of 
mercury emitted and other factors such as the weather. The form of mercury emitted varies 
depending on the source type and other factors. Available data indicate that the mercury 
emissions from these sources are a mixture of gaseous elemental mercury, inorganic ionic 
mercury, and particulate bound mercury. Gaseous elemental mercury can be transported very 
long distances, even globally, to regions far from the emissions source (becoming part of the 
global “pool”) before deposition occurs. Inorganic ionic and particulate bound mercury have a 
shorter atmospheric lifetime and can deposit to land or water bodies closer to the emissions 
source. Furthermore, elemental mercury in the atmosphere can undergo transformation into ionic 
mercury, providing a significant pathway for deposition of emitted elemental mercury. 

This source category emitted about 3.1 tons of mercury in the air in 2008 in the U.S. 

Based on the EPA’s National Emission Inventory, about 103 tons of mercury were emitted from 
all anthropogenic sources in the U.S. in 2005. Moreover, the United Nations has estimated that 
about 2,100 tons of mercury were emitted worldwide by anthropogenic sources in 2005. We 
believe that total mercury emissions in the U.S. and globally in 2008 were about the same 

5-22 

 

magnitude in 2005. Therefore, we estimate that in 2008, these sources emitted about 3% of the 
total anthropogenic mercury emissions in the U.S. and about 0.15% of the global emissions. 
Overall, this rule would reduce mercury emissions by about 5,500 pounds per year from current 
levels, and therefore, contribute to reductions in mercury exposures and health effects. Due to 
time and resource limitations, we were unable to model mercury dispersion, deposition, 
methylation, bioaccumulation in fish tissue, and human consumption of mercury-contaminated 
fish that would be needed in order to estimate the human health benefits from reducing mercury 
emissions.  

Potential exposure routes to mercury emissions include both direct inhalation and 
consumption of fish containing methylmercury. In the U.S., the primary route of human 
exposure to mercury emissions from industrial sources is generally indirectly through the 
consumption of fish containing methylmercury. As described above, mercury that has been 
emitted to the air eventually settles into water bodies or onto land where it can either move 
directly or be leached into waterbodies. Once deposited, certain microorganisms can change it 
into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that builds up in fish, shellfish and animals that eat fish. 
Consumption of fish and shellfish are the main sources of methylmercury exposure to humans. 
Methylmercury builds up more in some types of fish and shellfish than in others. The levels of 
methylmercury in fish and shellfish vary widely depending on what they eat, how long they live, 
and how high they are in the food chain. Most fish, including ocean species and local freshwater 
fish, contain some methylmercury. For example, in recent studies by EPA and the U.S. 
Geological Survey (USGS) of fish tissues, every fish sampled from 291 streams across the 
country contained some methylmercury (Scudder, 2009). 

The majority of fish consumed in the U.S. are ocean species. The methylmercury 
concentrations in ocean fish species are primarily influenced by the global mercury pool. 
However, the methylmercury found in local fish can be due, at least partly, to mercury emissions 
from local sources. Research shows that most people’s fish consumption does not cause a 
mercury-related health concern. However, certain people may be at higher risk because of their 
routinely high consumption of fish (e.g., tribal and other subsistence fishers and their families 
who rely heavily on fish for a substantial part of their diet). It has been demonstrated that high 
levels of methylmercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the 
developing nervous system, making the child less able to think and learn. Moreover, mercury 
exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people 
of all ages.  

5-23 

 

Several studies suggest that the methylmercury content of fish may reduce these cardio-
protective effects of fish consumption. Some of these studies also suggest that methylmercury 
may cause adverse effects to the cardiovascular system. For example, the NRC (2000) review of 
the literature concerning methylmercury health effects took note of two epidemiological studies 
that found an association between dietary exposure to methylmercury and adverse cardiovascular 
effects.12 Moreover, in a study of 1,833 males in Finland aged 42 to 60 years, Solonen et al. 
(1995) observed a relationship between methylmercury exposure via fish consumption and acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI or heart attacks), coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and 
all-cause mortality.13 The NRC also noted a study of 917 seven year old children in the Faroe 
Islands, whose initial exposure to methylmercury was in utero although post natal exposures may 
have occurred as well. At seven years of age, these children exhibited an increase in blood 
pressure and a decrease in heart rate variability.14 Based on these and other studies, NRC 
concluded in 2000 that, while “the data base is not as extensive for cardiovascular effects as it is 
for other end points (i.e. neurologic effects) the cardiovascular system appears to be a target for 
methylmercury toxicity.”15  

Since publication of the NRC report there have been some 30 published papers 

presenting the findings of studies that have examined the possible cardiovascular effects of 
methylmercury exposure. These studies include epidemiological, toxicological, and toxicokinetic 
investigations. Over a dozen review papers have also been published. If there is a causal 
relationship between methylmercury exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects, then reducing 
exposure to methylmercury would result in public health benefits from reduced cardiovascular 
effects. 

In early 2010, EPA sponsored a workshop in which a group of experts were asked to 

assess the plausibility of a causal relationship between methylmercury exposure and 
cardiovascular health effects and to advise EPA on methodologies for estimating population

workshop is in preparation. 

5.4.3.2 Cadmium 

Breathing air with very high levels of cadmium can severely damage the lungs and may 

cause death. In the United States, where proper industrial hygiene is generally practiced, inhaling 
very high levels of cadmium at work is expected to be rare and accidental. Breathing air with 
lower levels of cadmium over long periods of time (for years) results in a build-up of cadmium 
in the kidney, and if sufficiently high, may result in kidney disease. Lung cancer has been found 
in some studies of workers exposed to cadmium in the air and studies of rats that breathed in 
cadmium. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that 
cadmium and cadmium compounds are known human carcinogens. The International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that cadmium is carcinogenic to humans. The EPA 
has determined that cadmium is a probable human carcinogen.16 

5.4.3.3 Lead 

The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system, both in adults and children. Long-
term exposure of adults to lead at work has resulted in decreased performance in some tests that 
measure functions of the nervous system. Lead exposure may also cause weakness in fingers, 
wrists, or ankles. Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure, particularly in 
middle-aged and older people. Lead exposure may also cause anemia. At high levels of 
exposure, lead can severely damage the brain and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately 
cause death. In pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. High-
level exposure in men can damage the organs responsible for sperm production.  

We have no conclusive proof that lead causes cancer (is carcinogenic) in humans. Kidney 

tumors have developed in rats and mice that had been given large doses of some kind of lead 
compounds. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that lead 
and lead compounds are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens based on limited 
evidence from studies in humans and sufficient evidence from animal studies, and the EPA has 
determined that lead is a probable human carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on 
Cancer (IARC) has determined that inorganic lead is probably carcinogenic to humans. IARC 
determined that organic lead compounds are not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity in 
humans based on inadequate evidence from studies in humans and in animals.

Children are more sensitive to the health effects of lead than adults. No safe blood lead 

level in children has been determined. Lead affects children in different ways depending on how 
much lead a child swallows. A child who swallows large amounts of lead may develop anemia, 
kidney damage, colic (severe “stomach ache”), muscle weakness, and brain damage, which 
ultimately can kill the child. In some cases, the amount of lead in the child’s body can be 
lowered by giving the child certain drugs that help eliminate lead from the body. If a child 
swallows smaller amounts of lead, such as dust containing lead from paint, much less severe but 
still important effects on blood, development, and behavior may occur. In this case, recovery is 
likely once the child is removed from the source of lead exposure, but there is no guarantee that 
the child will completely avoid all long-term consequences of lead exposure. At still lower levels 
of exposure, lead can affect a child’s mental and physical growth. Fetuses exposed to lead in the 
womb, because their mothers had a lot of lead in their bodies, may be born prematurely and have 
lower weights at birth. Exposure in the womb, in infancy, or in early childhood also may slow 
mental development and cause lower intelligence later in childhood. There is evidence that these 
effects may persist beyond childhood.17 

5.4.3.4 Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) 

Hydrogen chloride gas is intensely irritating to the mucous membranes of the nose, 

throat, and respiratory tract. Brief exposure to 35 ppm causes throat irritation, and levels of 50 to 
100 ppm are barely tolerable for 1 hour. The greatest impact is on the upper respiratory tract; 
exposure to high concentrations can rapidly lead to swelling and spasm of the throat and 
suffocation. Most seriously exposed persons have immediate onset of rapid breathing, blue 
coloring of the skin, and narrowing of the bronchioles. Patients who have massive exposures 
may develop an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Exposure to hydrogen chloride can lead to 
Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS), a chemically- or irritant-induced type of 
asthma. Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults because of the 
relatively smaller diameter of their airways. Children may also be more vulnerable to gas 
exposure because of increased minute ventilation per kg and failure to evacuate an area promptly 
when exposed. Hydrogen chloride has not been classified for carcinogenic effects.18

5.4.3.5 Dioxins (Chlorinated dibenzodioxins (CDDs) 

A number of effects have been observed in people exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD levels that 

are at least 10 times higher than background levels. The most obvious health effect in people 
exposure to relatively large amounts of 2,3,7,8-TCDD is chloracne. Chloracne is a severe skin 
disease with acne-like lesions that occur mainly on the face and upper body. Other skin effects 
noted in people exposed to high doses of 2,3,7,8-TCDD include skin rashes, discoloration, and 
excessive body hair. Changes in blood and urine that may indicate liver damage also are seen in 
people. Alterations in the ability of the liver to metabolize (or breakdown) hemoglobin, lipids, 
sugar, and protein have been reported in people exposed to relatively high concentrations of 
2,3,7,8-TCDD. Most of the effects are considered mild and were reversible. However, in some 
people these effects may last for many years. Slight increases in the risk of diabetes and 
abnormal glucose tolerance have been observed in some studies of people exposed to 2,3,7,8-
TCDD. We do not have enough information to know if exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD would result 
in reproductive or developmental effects in people, but animal studies suggest that this is a 
potential health concern. 

In certain animal species, 2,3,7,8-TCDD is especially harmful and can cause death after a 

single exposure. Exposure to lower levels can cause a variety of effects in animals, such as 
weight loss, liver damage, and disruption of the endocrine system. In many species of animals, 
2,3,7,8-TCDD weakens the immune system and causes a decrease in the system’s ability to fight 
bacteria and viruses at relatively low levels (approximately 10 times higher than human 
background body burdens). In other animal studies, exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD has caused 
reproductive damage and birth defects. Some animal species exposed to CDDs during pregnancy 
had miscarriages and the offspring of animals exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD during pregnancy often 
had severe birth defects including skeletal deformities, kidney defects, and weakened immune 
responses. In some studies, effects were observed at body burdens 10 times higher than human 
background levels.19 

5.4.3.6 Furans (Chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs)) 

Most of the information on the adverse health effects comes from studies in people who 
were accidentally exposed to food contaminated with CDFs. The amounts that these people were 
exposed to were much higher than are likely from environmental exposures or from a normal 
diet. Skin and eye irritations, especially severe acne, darkened skin color, and swollen eyelids

with discharge, were the most obvious health effects of the CDF poisoning. CDF poisoning also 
caused vomiting and diarrhea, anemia, more frequent lung infections, numbness, effects on the 
nervous system, and mild changes in the liver. Children born to exposed mothers had skin 
irritation and more difficulty learning, but it is unknown if this effect was permanent or caused 
by CDFs alone or CDFs and polychlorinated biphenyls in combination. 

Many of the same effects that occurred in people accidentally exposed also occurred in 

laboratory animals that ate CDFs. Animals also had severe weight loss, and their stomachs, 
livers, kidneys, and immune systems were seriously injured. Some animals had birth defects and 
testicular damage, and in severe cases, some animals died. These effects in animals were seen 
when they were fed large amounts of CDFs over a short time, or small amounts over several 
weeks or months. Nothing is known about the possible health effects in animals from eating 
CDFs over a lifetime.20  

5.5 

Characterization of Uncertainty in the Monetized PM2.5 Benefits 
In any complex analysis, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. Many inputs 

are used to derive the final estimate of economic benefits, including emission inventories, air 
quality models (with their associated parameters and inputs), epidemiological estimates of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions, estimates of values, population estimates, income 
estimates, and estimates of the future state of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human 
behavior). For some parameters or inputs it may be possible to provide a statistical representation 
of the underlying uncertainty distribution. For other parameters or inputs, the necessary 
information is not available.  

The annual benefit estimates presented in this analysis are also inherently variable due to 

the processes that govern pollutant emissions and ambient air quality in a given year. Factors 
such as hours of equipment use and weather are constantly variable, regardless of our ability to 
measure them accurately. As discussed in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5-5) (U.S. EPA, 2006), 
there are a variety of uncertainties associated with these PM benefits. Therefore, the estimates of 
annual benefits should be viewed as representative of the magnitude of benefits expected, rather 
than the actual benefits that would occur every year.  

It is important to note that the monetized benefit-per-ton estimates used here reflect 

specific geographic patterns of emissions reductions and specific air quality and benefits

modeling assumptions. For example, these estimates do not reflect local variability in population 
density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors. Use of 
these $/ton values to estimate benefits associated with different emission control programs (e.g., 
for reducing emissions from large stationary sources like EGUs) may lead to higher or lower 
benefit estimates than if benefits were calculated based on direct air quality modeling. Great care 
should be taken in applying these estimates to emission reductions occurring in any specific 
location, as these are all based on national or broad regional emission reduction programs and 
therefore represent average benefits-per-ton over the entire United States. The benefits-per-ton 
for emission reductions in specific locations may be very different than the estimates presented 
here.  

PM2.5 mortality benefits are the largest benefit category that we monetized in this 
analysis. To better characterize the uncertainty associated with mortality impacts that are 
estimated to occur in areas with low baseline levels of PM2.5, we included the LML assessment. 
Without policy-specific air quality modeling, we are unable to quantify the shift in exposure 
associated with this specific rule. For this rule, as a surrogate measure of mortality impacts, we 
provide the percentage of the population exposed at each PM2.5 level using the most recent 
modeling available from the recently proposed Transport Rule (U.S. EPA, 2010e). A very large 
proportion of the population is exposed at or above the lowest LML of the cohort studies 
(Figures 5-5 and 5-6), increasing our confidence in the PM mortality analysis. Figure 5-5 shows 
a bar chart of the percentage of the population exposed to various air quality levels in the pre- 
and post-policy policy. Figure 5-6 shows a cumulative distribution function of the same data. 
Both figures identify the LML for each of the major cohort studies. As the policy shifts the 
distribution of air quality levels, fewer people are exposed to PM2.5 levels at or above the LML. 
Using the Pope et al. (2002) study, the 85% of the population is exposed to annual mean PM2.5 
levels at or above the LML of 7.5 µg/m3. Using the Laden et al. (2006) study, 40% of the 
population is exposed above the LML of 10 µg/m3. As we model mortality impacts among 
populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 that are successively lower than the LML of the lowest 
cohort study, our confidence in the results diminishes. However, the analysis above confirms that 
the great majority of the impacts occur at or above the lowest cohort study’s LML. It is important 
to emphasize that we have high confidence in PM2.5-related effects down to the lowest LML of 
the major cohort studies. Just because we have greater confidence in the benefits above the LML, 
this does not mean that we have no confidence that benefits occur below the LML.

Above we present the estimates of the total monetized benefits, based on our 

interpretation of the best available scientific literature and methods and supported by the SAB-
HES and the NAS (NRC, 2002). The benefits estimates are subject to a number of assumptions 
and uncertainties. For example, for key assumptions underlying the estimates for premature 
mortality, which typically account for at least 90% of the total monetized benefits, we were able 
to quantify include the following:  

1. PM 2.5 benefits were derived through benefit per-ton estimates, which do not reflect 

local variability in population density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health 
incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an over-estimate or under-
estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly emitted fine particulates.  

2. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 

equally potent in causing premature mortality. This is an important assumption, 
because PM2.5 produced via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ 
significantly from direct PM2.5 released from diesel engines and other industrial 
sources, but no clear scientific grounds exist for supporting differential effects 
estimates by particle type.  

3. We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is linear down to the 

lowest air quality levels modeled in this analysis. Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM2.5, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled concentrations.  

4. To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between PM 2.5 and premature 

mortality (which typically accounts for 85% to 95% of total monetized benefits), we 
include a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert elicitation study in 
addition to our core estimates. Even these multiple characterizations omit the 
uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence rates, populations exposed and 
transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. As a result, the reported 
confidence intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the 
overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates. This information should be interpreted 
within the context of the larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. For more 
information on the uncertainties associated with PM2.5 benefits, please consult the 
PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5-5). 

This RIA does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the PM 

NAAQS RIA because we lack the necessary air quality input and monitoring data to run the 
benefits model. In addition, we have not conducted any air quality modeling for this rule. 
Moreover, it was not possible to develop benefit-per-ton metrics and associated estimates of 
uncertainty using the benefits estimates from the PM RIA because of the significant differences 
between the sources affected in that rule and those regulated here. However, the results of the 

5-31 

 

Monte Carlo analyses of the health and welfare benefits presented in Chapter 5 of the PM RIA 
can provide some evidence of the uncertainty surrounding the benefits results presented in this 
analysis. 

5.6 

Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
Using a 3% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized benefits of the proposed SSI 

NSPS and EG including energy disbenefits to be $130 million to $320 million in the 
implementation year (2015). Using a 7% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized benefits 
of the SSI NSPS and EG including energy disbenefits to be $120 million to $290 million. The 
annualized costs are $92 million at a 7% interest rate.21 Thus, net benefits are $37 million to $220 
million at a 3% discount rate for the benefits and $26 million to $190 million at a 7% discount 
rate. All estimates are in 2008$.  

Table 5-9 shows a summary of the monetized co-benefits, social costs, and net benefits 
for the SSI NSPS and EG, respectively. Figures 5-7 and 5-8 show the full range of net benefits 
estimates (i.e., annual co-benefits minus annualized costs) utilizing the 14 different PM2.5 
mortality functions at discount rates of 3% and 7%. In addition, the benefits from reducing 2,900 
tons of carbon monoxide, 96 tons of HCl, 3.0 tons of lead, 1.6 tons of cadmium, 5,500 pounds of 
mercury, and 90 grams of total dioxins/furans each year have not been included in these 
estimates.  

                                                
21 For more information on the annualized costs, please refer to Section 4 of this RIA. There are no estimates of 

costs available at a 3% discount rate.

a All estimates are for the implementation year (2015), and are rounded to two significant figures. These results include 2 new FB

b The total monetized benefits reflect the human health benefits associated with reducing exposure to PM2.5 through reductions of 
directly emitted PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors such as NOx and SO2. It is important to note that the monetized benefits include 
many but not all health effects associated with PM2.5 exposure. Benefits are shown as a range from Pope et al. (2002) to Laden 
et al. (2006). These models assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in causing 
premature mortality because there is no clear scientific evidence that would support the development of differential effects 
estimates by particle type. These estimates include energy disbenefits valued at $0.5 million at a 3% discount rate for CO2 
emissions. 
c The annual compliances costs serve as a proxy for the annual social costs of this rule given the lack of difference between the two.

Pg 2: “The HES generally agrees with other decisions made by the EPA project team with 
respect to PM, in particular, the PM mortality effect threshold model, the cessation lag model, 
the inclusion of infant mortality estimation, and differential toxicity of PM.” 
 
Pg 2: “Further, the HES fully supports EPA’s use of a no-threshold model to estimate the 
mortality reductions associated with reduced PM exposure.” 
 
Pg 6: “The HES also supports the Agency’s choice of a no-threshold model for PM-related 
effects.” 
 
Pg 13: “The HES fully supports EPA’s decision to use a no-threshold model to estimate mortality 
reductions. This decision is supported by the data, which are quite consistent in showing effects down to 
the lowest measured levels. Analyses of cohorts using data from more recent years, during which time 
PM concentrations have fallen, continue to report strong associations with mortality. Therefore, there is 
no evidence to support a truncation of the CRF.”

Prevention, Council on the Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease, and Council on Nutrition, 
Physical Activity and Metabolism. (2010). “Particulate matter air pollution and 
cardiovascular disease: an update to the scientific statement from the American Heart 
Association.” Circulation. 121: 2331-2378. 

 
Pg 2338: “Finally, there appeared to be no lower-limit threshold below which PM10 was not 
associated with excess mortality across all regions.” 
 
Pg 2350: “There also appears to be a monotonic (e.g., linear or log-linear) concentration-
response relationship between PM2.5 and mortality risk observed in cohort studies that extends 
below present-day regulations of 15 µg/m3 for mean annual levels, without a discernable “safe” 
threshold.” (cites Pope 2004, Krewski 2009, and Schwartz 2008) 
 
Pg 2364: “The PM2.5 concentration– cardiovascular risk relationships for both short- and long-
term exposures appear to be monotonic, extending below 15 µg/m3 (the 2006 annual NAAQS 
level) without a discernable “safe” threshold.” 

Pg 2365: “This updated review by the AHA writing group corroborates and strengthens the 
conclusions of the initial scientific statement. In this context, we agree with the concept and 
continue to support measures based on scientific evidence, such as the US EPA NAAQS, that 
seek to control PM levels to protect the public health. Because the evidence reviewed supports 
that there is no safe threshold, it appears that public health benefits would accrue from lowering 
PM2.5 concentrations even below present-day annual (15 µg/m3) and 24-hour (35 µg/m3) 
NAAQS, if feasible, to optimally protect the most susceptible populations.” 

Pg 2366: “Although numerous insights have greatly enhanced our understanding of the PM-
cardiovascular relationship since the first AHA statement was published, the following list 
represents broad strategic avenues for future investigation: ... Determine whether any “safe” PM 
threshold concentration exists that eliminates both acute and chronic cardiovascular effects in 
healthy and susceptible individuals and at a population level.”

Pg 1-22: “An important consideration in characterizing the public health impacts associated with 
exposure to a pollutant is whether the concentration-response relationship is linear across the full 
concentration range encountered, or if nonlinear relationships exist along any part of this range. 
Of particular interest is the shape of the concentration-response curve at and below the level of 
the current standards. The shape of the concentration-response curve varies, depending on the 
type of health outcome, underlying biological mechanisms and dose. At the human population 
level, however, various sources of variability and uncertainty tend to smooth and “linearize” the 
concentration-response function (such as the low data density in the lower concentration range, 
possible influence of measurement error, and individual differences in susceptibility to air 
pollution health effects). In addition, many chemicals and agents may act by perturbing naturally 
occurring background processes that lead to disease, which also linearizes population 
concentration-response relationships (Clewell and Crump, 2005, 156359; Crump et al., 1976, 
003192; Hoel, 1980, 156555). These attributes of population dose-response may explain why the 
available human data at ambient concentrations for some environmental pollutants (e.g., PM, O3, 
lead [Pb], ETS, radiation) do not exhibit evident thresholds for health effects, even though likely 
mechanisms include nonlinear processes for some key events. These attributes of human 
population dose-response relationships have been extensively discussed in the broader 
epidemiologic literature (Rothman and Greenland, 1998, 086599).” 
 
Pg 2-16: “In addition, cardiovascular hospital admission and mortality studies that examined the 
PM10 concentration-response relationship found evidence of a log-linear no-threshold 
relationship between PM exposure and cardiovascular-related morbidity (Section 6.2) and 
mortality (Section 6.5).” 
 
Pg 2-25: “2.4.3. PM Concentration-Response Relationship 
An important consideration in characterizing the PM-morbidity and mortality association is 
whether the concentration-response relationship is linear across the full concentration range that 
is encountered or if there are concentration ranges where there are departures from linearity (i.e., 
nonlinearity). In this ISA studies have been identified that attempt to characterize the shape of 
the concentration-response curve along with possible PM “thresholds” (i.e., levels which PM 
concentrations must exceed in order to elicit a health response). The epidemiologic studies 
evaluated that examined the shape of the concentration-response curve and the potential presence 
of a threshold have focused on cardiovascular hospital admissions and ED visits and mortality 
associated with short-term exposure to PM10 and mortality associated with long-term exposure to 
PM2.5.  
 
“A limited number of studies have been identified that examined the shape of the PM 
cardiovascular hospital admission and ED visit concentration-response relationship. Of these 

A-6 

 

studies, some conducted an exploratory analysis during model selection to determine if a linear 
curve most adequately represented the concentration-response relationship; whereas, only one 
study conducted an extensive analysis to examine the shape of the concentration-response curve 
at different concentrations (Section 6.2.10.10). Overall, the limited evidence from the studies 
evaluated supports the use of a no-threshold, log-linear model, which is consistent with the 
observations made in studies that examined the PM-mortality relationship. 
 
“Although multiple studies have previously examined the PM-mortality concentration-response 
relationship and whether a threshold exists, more complex statistical analyses continue to be 
developed to analyze this association. Using a variety of methods and models, most of the 
studies evaluated support the use of a no-threshold, log-linear model; however, one study did 
observe heterogeneity in the shape of the concentration-response curve across cities (Section 
6.5). Overall, the studies evaluated further support the use of a no-threshold log-linear model, but 
additional issues such as the influence of heterogeneity in estimates between cities, and the effect 
of seasonal and regional differences in PM on the concentration-response relationship still 
require further investigation. 
 
“In addition to examining the concentration-response relationship between short-term exposure 
to PM and mortality, Schwartz et al. (2008, 156963) conducted an analysis of the shape of the 
concentration-response relationship associated with long-term exposure to PM. Using a variety 
of statistical methods, the concentration-response curve was found to be indistinguishable from 
linear, and, therefore, little evidence was observed to suggest that a threshold exists in the 
association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the risk of death (Section 7.6).” 
 
Pg 6-75: “6.2.10.10. Concentration Response 
The concentration-response relationship has been extensively analyzed primarily through studies 
that examined the relationship between PM and mortality. These studies, which have focused on 
short- and long-term exposures to PM have consistently found no evidence for deviations from 
linearity or a safe threshold (Daniels et al., 2004, 087343; Samoli et al., 2005, 087436; Schwartz, 
2004, 078998; Schwartz et al., 2008, 156963) (Sections 6.5.2.7 and 7.1.4). Although on a more 
limited basis, studies that have examined PM effects on cardiovascular hospital admissions and 
ED visits have also analyzed the PM concentration-response relationship, and contributed to the 
overall body of evidence which suggests a log-linear, no-threshold PM concentration-response 
relationship. 
 
“The results from the three multicity studies discussed above support no-threshold log-linear 
models, but issues such as the possible influence of exposure error and heterogeneity of shapes 
across cities remain to be resolved. Also, given the pattern of seasonal and regional differences 
in PM risk estimates depicted in recent multicity study results (e.g., Peng et al., 2005, 087463), 
the very concept of a concentration-response relationship estimated across cities and for all-year 
data may not be very informative.” 
 
Pg 6-197: “6.5.2.7. Investigation of Concentration-Response Relationship 
The results from large multicity studies reviewed in the 2004 PM AQCD (U.S. EPA, 2004, 
056905) suggested that strong evidence did not exist for a clear threshold for PM mortality 
effects. However, as discussed in the 2004 PM AQCD (U.S. EPA, 2004, 056905), there are 

A-7 

 

several challenges in determining and interpreting the shape of PM-mortality concentration-
response functions and the presence of a threshold, including: (1) limited range of available 
concentration levels (i.e., sparse data at the low and high end); (2) heterogeneity of susceptible 
populations; and (3) investigate the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. 
 
“Daniels et al. (2004, 087343) evaluated three concentration-response models: (1) log-linear 
models (i.e., the most commonly used approach, from which the majority of risk estimates are 
derived); (2) spline models that allow data to fit possibly non-linear relationship; and (3) 
threshold models, using PM10 data in 20 cities from the 1987-1994 NMMAPS data. They 
reported that the spline model, combined across the cities, showed a linear relation without 
indicating a threshold for the relative risks of death for all-causes and for cardiovascular-
respiratory causes in relation to PM10, but “the other cause” deaths (i.e., all cause minus 
cardiovascular-respiratory) showed an apparent threshold at around 50 μg/m3 PM10, as shown in 
Figure 6-35. For all-cause and cardio-respiratory deaths, based on the Akaike’s Information 
Criterion (AIC), a log-linear model without threshold was preferred to the threshold model and 
to the spline model. 
 
“The HEI review committee commented that interpretation of these results required caution, 
because (1) the measurement error could obscure any threshold; (2) the city-specific 
concentration-response curves exhibited a variety of shapes; and (3) the use of AIC to choose 
among the models might not be appropriate due to the fact it was not designed to assess scientific 
theories of etiology. Note, however, that there has been no etiologically credible reason 
suggested thus far to choose one model over others for aggregate outcomes. Thus, at least 
statistically, the result of Daniels et al. (2004, 087343) suggests that the log-linear model is 
appropriate in describing the relationship between PM10 and mortality. 
 
“The Schwartz (2004, 078998) analysis of PM10 and mortality in 14 U.S. cities, described in 
Section 6.5.2.1, also examined the shape of the concentration-response relationship by including 
indicator variables for days when concentrations were between 15 and 25 μg/m3, between 25 and 
34 μg/m3, between 35 and 44 μg/m3, and 45 μg/m3 and above. In the model, days with 
concentrations below 15 μg/m3 served as the reference level. This model was fit using the single 
stage method, combining strata across all cities in the case-crossover design. Figure 6-36 shows 
the resulting relationship, which does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that a threshold 
exists. The authors did not examine city-to-city variation in the concentration-response 
relationship in this study. 
 
“PM10 and mortality in 22 European cities (and BS in 15 of the cities) participating in the 
APHEA project. In nine of the 22 cities, PM10 levels were estimated using a regression model 
relating co-located PM10 to BS or TSP. They used regression spline models with two knots (30 
and 50 μg/m3) and then combined the individual city estimates of the splines across cities. The 
investigators concluded that the association between PM and mortality in these cities could be 
adequately estimated using the log-linear model. However, in an ancillary analysis of the 
concentration-response curves for the largest cities in each of the three distinct geographic areas 
(western, southern, and eastern European cities): London, England; Athens, Greece; and Cracow, 
Poland, Samoli et al. (2005, 087436) observed a difference in the shape of the concentration-
response curve across cities. Thus, while the combined curves (Figure 6-37) appear to support 

A-8 

 

no-threshold relationships between PM10 and mortality, the heterogeneity of the shapes across 
cities makes it difficult to interpret the biological relevance of the shape of the combined curves. 
 
“The results from the three multicity studies discussed above support no-threshold log-linear 
models, but issues such as the possible influence of exposure error and heterogeneity of shapes 
across cities remain to be resolved. Also, given the pattern of seasonal and regional differences 
in PM risk estimates depicted in recent multicity study results (e.g., Peng et al., 2005, 087463), 
the very concept of a concentration-response relationship estimated across cities and for all-year 
data may not be very informative.”

Pg 67: “A key finding of this study is that there is little evidence for a threshold in the 
association between exposure to fine particles and the risk of death on follow-up, which 
continues well below the U.S. EPA standard of 15 μg/m3.”  
 
Pg 68: “In conclusion, penalized spline smoothing and model averaging represent reasonable, 
feasible approaches to addressing questions of the shape of the exposure–response curve, and can 
provide valuable information to decisionmakers. In this example, both approaches are consistent, 
and suggest that the association of particles with mortality has no threshold down to close to 
background levels.”

G. Expert Elicitation on PM-Mortality (2006, 2008) 

 
Industrial Economics, Inc., 2006. Expanded Expert Judgment Assessment of the 

Concentration-Response Relationship Between PM2.5 Exposure and Mortality. Prepared for 
the U.S.EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, September. Available on the 
Internet at <http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/regdata/Uncertainty/pm_ee_report.pdf>. 

 
Pg v: “Each expert was given the option to integrate their judgments about the likelihood of a 
causal relationship and/or threshold in the C-R function into his distribution or to provide a 
distribution "conditional on" one or both of these factors.” 
 
Pg vii: “Only one of 12 experts explicitly incorporated a threshold into his C-R function.3 The 
rest believed there was a lack of empirical and/or theoretical support for a population threshold. 
However, three other experts gave differing effect estimate distributions above and below some 
cut-off concentration. The adjustments these experts made to median estimates and/or 
uncertainty at lower PM2.5 concentrations were modest.” 

“3 Expert K indicated that he was 50 percent sure that a threshold existed. If there 
were a threshold, he thought that there was an 80 percent chance that it would be 
less than or equal to 5 μg/m3, and a 20 percent chance that it would fall between 5 
and 10 μg/m3.” 

 
Pg ix: “Compared to the pilot study, experts in this study were in general more confident in a 
causal relationship, less likely to incorporate thresholds, and reported higher mortality effect 
estimates. The differences in results compared with the pilot appear to reflect the influence of 
new research on the interpretation of the key epidemiological studies that were the focus of both 
elicitation studies, more than the influence of changes to the structure of the protocol.” 
 
Pg 3-25: “3.1.8 THRESHOLDS  
The protocol asked experts for their judgments regarding whether a threshold exists in the PM2.5 
mortality C-R function. The protocol focused on assessing expert judgments regarding theory 
and evidential support for a population threshold (i.e., the concentration below which no member 
of the study population would experience an increased risk of death).32 If an expert wished to 
incorporate a threshold in his characterization of the concentration-response relationship, the 
team then asked the expert to specify the threshold PM2.5 concentration probabilistically, 
incorporating his uncertainty about the true threshold level. 
 
“From a theoretical and conceptual standpoint, all experts generally believed that individuals 
exhibit thresholds for PM-related mortality. However, 11 of them discounted the idea of a 
population threshold in the C-R function on a theoretical and/or empirical basis. Seven of these 
experts noted that theoretically one would be unlikely to observe a population threshold due to 
the variation in susceptibility at any given time in the study population resulting from 
combinations of genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors.33 All 11 thought that there 
was insufficient empirical support for a population threshold in the C-R function. In addition, 
two experts (E and L) cited analyses of the ACS cohort data in Pope et al. (2002) and another (J) 
cited Krewski et al. (2000a & b) as supportive of a linear relationship in the study range.  

A-20 

 

 
“Seven of the experts favored epidemiological studies as ideally the best means of addressing the 
population threshold issue, because they are best able to evaluate the full range of susceptible 
individuals at environmentally relevant exposure levels. However, those who favored 
epidemiologic studies generally acknowledged that definitive studies addressing thresholds 
would be difficult or impossible to conduct, because they would need to include a very large and 
diverse population with wide variation in exposure and a long follow-up period. Furthermore, 
two experts (B and I) cited studies documenting difficulties in detecting a threshold using 
epidemiological studies (Cakmak et al. 1999, and Brauer et al., 2002, respectively). The experts 
generally thought that clinical and toxicological studies are best suited for researching 
mechanisms and for addressing thresholds in very narrowly defined groups. One expert, B, 
thought that a better understanding of the detailed biological mechanism is critical to addressing 
the question of a threshold. 
 
“One expert, K, believed it was possible to make a conceptual argument for a population 
threshold. He drew an analogy with smoking, indicating that among heavy smokers, only a 
proportion of them gets lung cancer or demonstrates an accelerated decline in lung function. He 
thought that the idea that there is no level that is biologically safe is fundamentally at odds with 
toxicological theory. He did not think that a population threshold was detectable in the currently 
available epidemiologic studies. He indicated that some of the cohort studies showed greater 
uncertainty in the shape of the C-R function at lower levels, which could be indicative of a 
threshold.  
 
“Expert K chose to incorporate a threshold into his C-R function. He indicated that he was 50 
percent sure that a threshold existed. If there were a threshold, he thought that there was an 80 
percent chance that it would be less than or equal to 5 μg/m3, and a 20 percent chance that it 
would fall between 5 and 10 μg/m3.”

average PM2.5 was log-linear across the entire study range (ln(mortality) ) β × PM). Four experts 
(B, F, K, and L) specified a “piecewise” log-linear function, with different β coefficients for PM 
concentrations above and below an expert-specified break point. This approach allowed them to 
express increased uncertainty in mortality effects seen at lower concentrations in major 
epidemiological studies. Expert K thought the relationship would be log-linear above a 
threshold.” 
 
Pg 2271: “Expert K also applied a threshold, T, to his function, which he described 
probabilistically. He specified P(T > 0) = 0.5. Given T > 0, he indicated P(T ≤ 5 μg/m3) = 0.8 
and P(5 μg/m3 < T ≤ 10 μg/m3) = 0.2. Figure 3 does not include the impact of applying expert 
K’s threshold, as the size of the reduction in benefits will depend on the distribution of baseline 
PM levels in a benefits analysis.”

Pg 6: “A second concern is with methodological issues. The issue of the selection of 
concentration-response (C-R) relationships based on locally-derived coefficients needs more 
discussion. The Panel did not agree with EPA staff in calculating the burden of associated 
incidence in their risk assessment using either the predicted background or the lowest measured 
level (LML) in the utilized epidemiological analysis. The available epidemiological database on 
daily mortality and morbidity does not establish either the presence or absence of threshold 
concentrations for adverse health effects. Thus, in order to avoid emphasizing an approach that 
assumes effects that extend to either predicted background concentrations or LML, and to 
standardize the approach across cities, for the purpose of estimating public health impacts, the 
Panel favored the primary use of an assumed threshold of 10 μg/m3. The original approach of 
using background or LML, as well as the other postulated thresholds, could still be used in a 
sensitivity analysis of threshold assumptions. 
“The analyses in this chapter highlight the impact of assumptions regarding thresholds, or lack of 
threshold, on the estimates of risk. The uncertainty associated with threshold or nonlinear models 
needs more thorough discussion. A major research need is for more work to determine the 
existence and level of any thresholds that may exist or the shape of nonlinear concentration-
response curves at low levels of exposure that may exist, and to reduce uncertainty in estimated 
risks at the lowest PM concentrations.”

Pg 20: “The Subcommittee agrees that the whole range of uncertainties, such as the questions of 
causality, shape of C-R functions and thresholds, relative toxicity, years of life lost, cessation lag 
structure, cause of death, biologic pathways, or susceptibilities may be viewed differently for 
acute effects versus long-term effects.  
 
“For the studies of long-term exposure, the HES notes that Krewski et al. (2000) have conducted 
the most careful work on this issue. They report that the associations between PM2.5 and both all-
cause and cardiopulmonary mortality were near linear within the relevant ranges, with no 
apparent threshold. Graphical analyses of these studies (Dockery et al., 1993, Figure 3 and 
Krewski et al., 2000, page 162) also suggest a continuum of effects down to lower levels. 
Therefore, it is reasonable for EPA to assume a no threshold model down to, at least, the low end 
of the concentrations reported in the studies.”

J. NRC – Committee on Estimating the Health Risk Reduction Benefits of Proposed Air 

Pollution Regulations (2002) 

 

National Research Council (NRC). 2002. Estimating the Public Health Benefits of Proposed 

Air Pollution Regulations. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. 

 
Pg 109: “Linearity and Thresholds 

“The shape of the concentration-response functions may influence the overall estimate of 
benefits. The shape is particularly important for lower ambient air pollution concentrations to 
which a large portion of the population is exposed. For this reason, the impact of the existence of 
a threshold may be considerable. 

“In epidemiological studies, air pollution concentrations are usually measured and modeled as 
continuous variables. Thus, it may be feasible to test linearity and the existence of thresholds, 
depending on the study design. In time-series studies with the large number of repeated 
measurements, linearity and thresholds have been formally addressed with reasonable statistical 
power. For pollutants such as PM10 and PM2.5, there is no evidence for any departure of linearity 
in the observed range of exposure, nor any indication of a threshold. For example, examination 
of the mortality effects of short-term exposure to PM10 in 88 cities indicates that the 
concentration-response functions are not due to the high concentrations and that the slopes of 
these functions do not appear to increase at higher concentrations (Samet et al. 2000). Many 
other mortality studies have examined the shape of the concentration-response function and 
indicated that a linear (nonthreshold) model fit the data well (Pope 2000). Furthermore, studies 
conducted in cities with very low ambient pollution concentrations have similar effects per unit 
change in concentration as those studies conducted in cities with higher concentrations. Again, 
this finding suggests a fairly linear concentration-response function over the observed range of 
exposures. 

“Regarding the studies of long-term exposure, Krewski et al. (2000) found that the assumption of 
a linear concentration-response function for mortality outcomes was not unreasonable. However, 
the statistical power to assess the shape of these functions is weakest at the upper and lower end 
of the observed exposure ranges. Most of the studies examining the effects of long-term 
exposure on morbidity compare subjects living in a small number of communities (Dockery et al. 
1996; Ackermmann-Liebrich 1997; Braun-Fahrländer et al. 1997). Because the number of long-
term effects studies are few and the number of communities studied is relatively small (8 to 24), 
the ability to test formally the absence or existence of a no-effect threshold is not feasible. 
However, even if thresholds exist, they may not be at the same concentration for all health 
outcomes. 

“A review of the time-series and cohort studies may lead to the conclusion that although a 
threshold is not apparent at commonly observed concentrations, one may exist at lower levels. 
An important point to acknowledge regarding thresholds is that for health benefits analysis a key 
threshold is the population threshold (the lowest of the individual thresholds). However, the 
population threshold would be very difficult to observe empirically through epidemiology, 

A-27 

 

because epidemiology integrates information from very large groups of people (thousands). Air 
pollution regulations affect even larger groups of people (millions). It is reasonable to assume 
that among such large groups susceptibility to air pollution health effects varies considerably 
across individuals and depends on a large set of underlying factors, including genetic makeup, 
age, exposure measurement error, preexisting disease, and simultaneous exposures from smoking 
and occupational hazards. This variation in individual susceptibilities and the resulting 
distribution of individual thresholds underlies the concentration-response function observed in 
epidemiology. Thus, until biologically based models of the distribution of individual thresholds 
are developed, it may be productive to assume that the population concentration-response 
function is continuous and to focus on finding evidence of changes in its slope as one approaches 
lower concentrations. 

EPA’s Use of Thresholds 

“In EPA’s benefits analyses, threshold issues were discussed and interpreted. For the PM and 
ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), EPA investigated the effects of a 
potential threshold or reference value below which health consequences were assumed to be zero 
(EPA 1997). Specifically, the high-end benefits estimate assumed a 12-microgram per cubic 
meter (µg/m3) mean threshold for mortality associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5. The 
low-end benefits estimate assumed a 15-µg/m3 threshold for all PM-related health effects. The 
studies, however, included concentrations as low as 7.5 µg/m3. For the Tier 2 rule and the HD 
engine and diesel-fuel rule, no threshold was assumed (EPA 1999, 2000). EPA in these analyses 
acknowledged that there was no evidence for a threshold for PM. 

“Several points should be noted regarding the threshold assumptions. If a threshold is assumed 
where one was not apparent in the original study, then the data should be refit and a new curve 
generated with the assumption of a zero slope over a segment of the concentration-response 
function that was originally found to be positively sloped. The assumption of a zero slope over a 
portion of the curve will force the slope in the remaining segment of the positively sloped 
concentration-response function to be greater than was indicated in the original study. A new 
concentration-response function was not generated for EPA’s benefits analysis for the PM and 
ozone NAAQS for which threshold assumptions were made. The generation of the steeper slope 
in the remaining portion of the concentration-response function may fully offset the effect of 
assuming a threshold. These aspects of assuming a threshold in a benefits analysis where one 
was not indicated in the original study should be conveyed to the reader. The committee notes 
that the treatment of thresholds should be evaluated in a consistent and transparent framework by 
using different explicit assumptions in the formal uncertainty analyses (see Chapter 5).” 

Pg 117: “Although the assumption of no thresholds in the most recent EPA benefits analyses was 
appropriate, EPA should evaluate threshold assumptions in a consistent and transparent 
framework using several alternative assumptions in the formal uncertainty analysis.” 

Pg 136: “Two additional illustrative examples are thresholds for adverse effects and lag 
structures.2 EPA considers implausible any threshold for mortality in the particulate matter (PM) 
exposure ranges under consideration (EPA 1999a, p. 3-8). Although the agency conducts 
sensitivity analyses incorporating thresholds, it provides no judgment as to their relative 

A-28 

 

plausibility. In a probabilistic uncertainty analysis, EPA could assign appropriate weights to 
various threshold models. For PM-related mortality in the Tier 2 analysis, the committee expects 
that this approach would have resulted in only a slight widening of the probability distribution 
for avoided mortality and a slight reduction in the mean of that distribution, thus reflecting 
EPA’s views about the implausibility of thresholds. The committee finds that such formal 
incorporation of EPA’s expert judgments about the plausibility of thresholds into its primary 
analysis would have been an improvement. 

“Uncertainty about thresholds is a special aspect of uncertainty about the shape of concentration-
response functions. Typically, EPA and authors of epidemiological studies assume that these 
functions are linear on some scale. Often, the scale is a logarithmic transformation of the risk or 
rate of the health outcome, but when a rate or risk is low, a linear function on the logarithmic 
scale is approximately linear on the scale of the rate or risk itself. Increasingly, epidemiological 
investigators are employing analytic methods that permit the estimation of nonlinear shapes for 
concentration-response functions (Greenland et al. 1999). As a consequence, EPA will need to be 
prepared to incorporate nonlinear concentration-response functions from epidemiological studies 
into the agency’s health benefits analyses. Any source of error or bias that can distort an 
epidemiological association can also distort the shape of an estimated concentration -response 
function, as can variation in individual susceptibility (Hattis and Burmaster 1994; Hattis et al. 
2001).” 

Pg 137: “In principle, many components of the health benefits model need realistic probabilistic 
models (see Table 5-1 for a listing of such components), in addition to concentration-response 
thresholds and time lags between exposure and response. For example, additional features of the 
concentration-response function—such as projection of the results from the study population to 
the target populations (which may have etiologically relevant characteristics outside the range 
seen in the study population) and the projection of baseline frequencies of morbidity and 
mortality into the future—must be characterized probabilistically. Other uncertainties that might 
affect the probability distributions are the estimations of population exposure (or even 
concentration) from emissions, estimates of emissions themselves, and the relative toxicity of 
various classes of particles. Similarly, many aspects of the analysis of the impact of regulation on 
ambient concentrations and on population exposure involve considerable uncertainty and, 
therefore, may be beneficially modeled in this way. Depending on the analytic approach used, 
joint probability distributions will have to be specified to incorporate correlations between model 
components that are structurally dependent upon each other, or the analysis will have to be 
conducted in a sequential fashion that follows the model for the data-generating process. 

“EPA should explore alternative options for incorporating expert judgment into its probabilistic 
uncertainty analyses. The agency possesses considerable internal expertise, which should be 
employed as fully as possible. Outside experts should also be consulted as needed, individually 
or in panels. In all cases, when expert judgment is used in the construction of a model 
component, the experts should be identified and the rationales and empirical bases for their 
judgments should be made available.”

Inherent in any complex Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) are multiple sources of 
uncertainty. Health benefits analysis relies on an array of data inputs—including air quality 
modeling, health impact functions and valuation estimates among others—which are themselves 
subject to uncertainty and may also in turn contribute to the overall uncertainty in this analysis. 
There are a variety of methods to characterizing the uncertainty associated with the human health 
benefits of air pollution, including quantitative and qualitative methods. When evaluated within 
the context of these uncertainties, the health impact and monetized benefits estimates in an RIA 
can provide useful information regarding the magnitude of the public health impacts attributable 
to reducing air pollution. 

Reductions in premature mortality typically dominate the size of the overall monetized 
benefits. Therefore, most of the uncertainty characterization generally focuses on the mortality-
related benefits. Typically, EPA employs two primary techniques for quantifying this 
uncertainty. First, because this characterization of random statistical error may omit important 
sources of uncertainty, we employ the results of an expert elicitation on the relationship between 
premature mortality and ambient PM2.5 concentration (Roman et al., 2008); this provides 
additional insight into the likelihood of different outcomes and about the state of knowledge 
regarding the benefits estimates. Second, when we have air quality modeling specific to the 
policy we are evaluating and it can be used as an input to the health impact and economic 
analysis, we use Monte Carlo methods for characterizing random sampling error associated with 
the concentration response functions from epidemiological studies and economic valuation 
functions.1 Both approaches have different strengths and weaknesses, which are fully described 
in Chapter 5 of the PM NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006).  

In addition, some RIAs, including the PM NAAQS RIA (2006d) and Ozone NAAQS 

RIA (2008a), also contain a suite of sensitivity analyses that evaluate the sensitivity of the 
monetized benefits to the specification of alternate mortality cessation lags and income growth 
adjustment factors. Cessation lags and income growth adjustments are simply multipliers applied 
to the valuation function, which generally affect monetized benefits estimates in the same 
manner. Thus, it is possible for readers to infer the sensitivity of these parameters by referring to 
those previous analyses.2 Other RIAs contain unique sensitivity analyses that are specific to the 
                                                
1 Currently, we are unable to characterize the random sampling error from the underlying studies when applying 

national average benefit-per-ton estimates.  

2 For example, in the PM NAAQS RIA, the use of an alternate lag structure would change the PM2.5-related 

mortality benefits discounted at 3% discounted by between 10.4% and –27%; when discounted at 7%, these 

B-2 

 

input parameters of that analysis, such as blood lead level (U.S. EPA, 2008b) or rollback method 
(U.S. EPA, 2010a). Other sources of uncertainty, including the projection of atmospheric 
conditions and source-level emissions, the projection of baseline morbidity rates, incomes and 
technological development are typically unquantified in our RIAs. For these sources, we 
typically provide a qualitative uncertainty characterization associated with these input 
parameters. 

One particular aspect of uncertainty has received extensive quantitative and qualitative 
attention in recent RIAs: the existence of a threshold in the concentration-response function for 
PM2.5-related mortality. A threshold is a specific type of discontinuity in the concentration-
response function where there are no benefits associated with reducing PM2.5 levels in areas 
where the baseline air quality is less than the threshold. Previously, EPA had included a 
sensitivity analysis with an arbitrary assumed threshold at 10 µg/m3 in the PM-mortality health 
impact function in the RIA to illustrate that the fraction of benefits that occur at lower air 
pollution concentration levels are inherently more uncertain. A threshold of 10 µg/m3 does not 
necessarily have any stronger technical basis than any other threshold, and we could have instead 
assumed a threshold at 4, 7.5, or 12 µg/m3 for the sensitivity analysis. In addition to identifying 
the most support for a non-threshold model, the underlying scientific evidence does not support 
any specific “bright line”. 

Based on our review of the current body of scientific literature, EPA now estimates PM-

related mortality without applying an assumed concentration threshold. EPA’s Integrated 
Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2009b), which was recently reviewed by 
EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2009b), concluded that the scientific literature consistently finds that a no-threshold log-linear 
model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship while 
recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape of the concentration-response function.1 
Since then, the Health Effects Subcommittee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010) of EPA’s Council 
concluded, “The HES fully supports EPA’s decision to use a no-threshold model to estimate 
mortality reductions. This decision is supported by the data, which are quite consistent in 

                                                                                                                                                       

benefits change by between 31% and -49%. When applying higher and lower income growth adjustments, the 
monetary value of PM2.5 and ozone-related premature changes between 30% and -10%; the value of chronic 
endpoints change between 5% and -2% and the value of acute endpoints change between 6% and -7%. (U.S. EPA, 
2006) 

1It is important to note that uncertainty regarding the shape of the concentration-response function is conceptually 

distinct from an assumed threshold. An assumed threshold (below which there are no health effects) is a 
discontinuity, which is a specific example of non-linearity. 

B-3 

 

showing effects down to the lowest measured levels. Analyses of cohorts using data from more 
recent years, during which time PM concentrations have fallen, continue to report strong 
associations with mortality. Therefore, there is no evidence to support a truncation of the CRF.” 
For a summary of these scientific review statements and the panel members please consult the 
Technical Support Document (TSD) Summary of Expert Opinions on the Existence of a 
Threshold (U.S. EPA, 2010c). 

Consistent with this finding, we have conformed the previous threshold sensitivity 

analysis to the current state of the PM science by incorporating a new “Lowest Measured Level” 
(LML) assessment. While an LML assessment provides some insight into the level of uncertainty 
in the estimated PM mortality benefits, EPA does not view the LML as a threshold and continues 
to quantify PM-related mortality impacts using a full range of modeled air quality 
concentrations. Unlike an assumed threshold, which is a modeling assumption that reduces the 
magnitude of the estimated health impacts, the LML is a characterization of the fraction of 
benefits that are more uncertain. It is important to emphasize that just because we have greater 
confidence in the benefits above the LML, this does not mean that we have no confidence that 
benefits occur below the LML. 

While the LML of each study is important to consider when characterizing and 

interpreting the overall level PM-related benefits, EPA believes that large cohort-based mortality 
estimates are suitable for use in air pollution health impact analyses. When estimating PM 
mortality impacts using risk coefficients drawn from the Harvard Six Cities and the American 
Cancer Society cohorts there are innumerable other attributes that may affect the size of the 
reported risk estimates—including differences in population demographics, the size of the 
cohort, activity patterns and particle composition among others. The LML assessment provides a 
limited representation of one key difference between the two studies. For the purpose of 
estimating the benefits associated with reducing PM2.5 levels, we utilize the effect coefficients 
from Pope et al. (2002) for the American Cancer Society cohort and from Laden et al. (2006) for 
the Harvard Six Cities cohort.  

Analyses of these cohorts using data from more recent years, during which time PM 

concentrations have fallen, continue to report strong associations with mortality. For example, 
the Krewski et al. (2009) follow-up study of the American Cancer Society cohort had an LML of 
5.8 µg/m3. As we model mortality impacts among populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 that are 
successively lower than the LML of each study, our confidence in the results diminishes. As air 
pollution emissions continue to decrease over time, there will be more people in areas where we 
do not have published epidemiology studies. However, each successive cohort study has shown 

B-4 

 

evidence of effects at successively lower levels of PM2.5. As more large cohort studies follow 
populations over time, we will likely have more studies with lower LML as air quality levels 
continue to improve. Even in the absence of a definable threshold, we have more confidence in 
the benefits estimates above the LML of the large cohort studies. To account for the uncertainty 
in each of the studies that we base our mortality estimates on, we provide the LML for each of 
the cohort studies. However, the finding of effects at the lowest LML from the recent Krewski et 
al (2009) study indicates that confidence in PM2.5-related mortality effects down to at least 5.8 
µg/m3 is high.  

In the recently proposed Transport Rule RIA (U.S. EPA, 2010b), we included the new 
LML assessment in which we binned the estimated number of avoided PM2.5-related premature 
mortalities resulting from the implementation of the Transport Rule according to the projected 
2014 baseline PM2.5 air quality levels. This presentation is consistent with our approach to 
applying PM2.5 mortality risk coefficients that have not been adjusted to incorporate an assumed 
threshold. A very large proportion of the avoided PM-related impacts occurred among 
populations initially exposed at or above the LML of each study, which gave us a high level of 
confidence in the PM mortality estimates. This assessment summarized the distribution of 
avoided PM mortality impacts according to the baseline PM2.5 levels experienced by the 
population receiving the PM2.5 mortality benefit. Approximately 80% of the avoided impacts 
occurred at or above a baseline annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 µg/m3 (the LML of the Laden et 
al. 2006 study); about 97% occur at or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 7.5 µg/m3 (the LML 
of the Pope et al. 2002 study). This assessment confirmed that the great majority of the impacts 
associated with the Transport Rule occurred at or above each study’s LML.  

For the Transport Rule, policy-specific air quality modeling data for the year 2014 was 

 
available as an input into the benefits analysis. For some rules, especially New Source 
Performance Standards (NSPS) or National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant 
(NESHAP) rules, policy-specific air quality data is not available due to time or resource 
limitations. For these rules, we provide the following LML assessment as a characterization of 
the baseline exposure to PM2.5 levels in the U.S. Many of the upcoming NSPS and NESHAP 
rules have compliance dates between 2013 and 2016 and represent marginal improvements in air 
quality levels. Although it the data is not a perfect match, we believe that the air quality data 

B-5 

 

from the Transport Rule is a reasonable approximation of the baseline exposure in the U.S. for 
upcoming NSPS and NESHAP rules.1  

For rules without air quality modeling, we generally estimate the monetized benefits and 

 
health impacts using benefit-per-ton estimates (Fann, Fulcher and Hubbell, 2009). Using this 
method, we are unable to estimate the percentage of premature mortality associated with the 
specific rules’ emission reductions at each PM2.5 level. However, we believe that it is still 
important to characterize the uncertainty associated with the distribution of the baseline air 
quality. As a surrogate measure of mortality impacts, we provide the percentage of baseline 
exposure at each PM2.5 level. If air quality levels in the baseline are above the LML, the marginal 
changes anticipated from these rules would likely also lead to post-policy air quality levels above 
the LML. Therefore, we have high confidence that the magnitude of the benefits estimated for 
these rules, as the marginal changes would also be above the LML.  

It is important to note that baseline exposure is only one parameter in the health impact 

function, along with baseline incidence rates population, and change in air quality. In other 
words, the percentage of the population exposed to air pollution below the LML is not the same 
as the percentage of the population experiencing health impacts as a result of a specific emission 
reduction policy. The most important aspect, which we are unable to quantify for rules without 
air quality modeling, is the shift in exposure associated with the specific rule. Therefore, caution 
is warranted when interpreting the following assessment.  

A very large proportion of the population is exposed at or above the lowest LML of the 

cohort studies (Figures 1 and 2), increasing our confidence in the PM mortality analysis. Figure 1 
shows a bar chart of the percentage of the population exposed to various air quality levels in the 
pre- and post-policy policy. Figure 2 shows a cumulative distribution function of the same data. 
In addition, Figure 2 also demonstrates that policy had a greater impact on reducing exposure to 
the portion of the population in areas with high PM2.5 levels relative to the portion of the 
population at low PM2.5 levels. Both figures identify the LML for each of the major cohort 
studies. As the policy shifts the distribution of air quality levels, fewer people are exposed to 
PM2.5 levels above the LML. Under baseline conditions, about 96 percent of the population is 
                                                
1 Because the Transport Rule is not yet promulgated, the baseline exposure obtained from this modeling data would 

slightly overestimate the fraction of the population exposed to air quality levels below the LML. As additional 
rules continue to reduce the ambient PM2.5 levels over time, a larger fraction of the population would be exposed 
to air quality levels below the LML. However, the emission reductions anticipated from the rules without air 
quality modeling available are comparatively small and represent marginal changes. We intend to update this 
LML assessment as necessary to correspond with the successively lower baseline air quality levels anticipated as 
the result of promulgating significant upcoming rules.

exposed to annual mean PM2.5 levels of at least 5.8 µg/m3, which is the lowest air quality level 
considered in the most recent study of the American Cancer Society cohort by Krewski et al. 
(2009). Using the Pope et al. (2002) study, the 85% of the population is exposed at or above the 
LML of 7.5 µg/m3. Using the Laden et al. (2006) study, 40% of the population is exposed above 
the LML of 10 µg/m3. As we model mortality impacts among populations exposed to levels of 
PM2.5 that are successively lower than the LML of the lowest cohort study, our confidence in the 
results diminishes. However, the analysis above confirms that the great majority of the impacts 
occur at or above the lowest cohort study’s LML. It is important to emphasize that we have high 
confidence in PM2.5-related effects down to the lowest LML of the major cohort studies, which is 
5.8 µg/m3. Just because we have greater confidence in the benefits above the LML, this does not 
mean that we have no confidence that benefits occur below the LML.

There are several important differences between the assessment conducted for the 

Transport Rule and the assessment presented here. If you compare the graphics in the Transport 
Rule to those provided here, you will notice that these graphs show a larger percentage of the 
population below the LML. It is imperative to point out that the Transport Rule graphics 
represented mortality impacts attributable to the Transport Rule, whereas these graphics 
represent exposure. Mortality impacts are the result of the incremental change in exposure 
between the baseline and control. However, the baseline population exposure at lower air quality 
levels is so much larger than the impacts among these same populations. In other words, the 
population exposed to lower PM2.5 levels are not receiving very much of the air quality benefit 
between the base and the control case.

Dioxin/Furan TEQ concentrations, no data was available for the subcategory, so TEQ concentrations were assumed to be 57% of the TMB values. 

1. Assumes that units with a packed bed scrubber or installing a packed bed scrubber will get a 10% Hg reduction. 
2. ACI algorithm is based on 90% Hg reduction efficiency and 98% CDD/CDF reduction efficiency.  This adjustment factor will be used to adjust total annual 

costs to the estimated reduction efficiency needed to meet the floor.

1. Assumes that units with a packed bed scrubber or installing a packed bed scrubber will get a 10% Hg reduction. 
2. ACI algorithm is based on 90% Hg reduction efficiency and 98% CDD/CDF reduction efficiency.  This 

adjustment factor will be used to adjust total annual costs to the estimated reduction efficiency needed to meet the 
floor.

E.  Total Labor Burden and Cost 
Notes: 
1.  Industry costs are based on the following hourly rates:  technical at $34.60, management at $82.23, and clerical at $22.32 (see table below).  The composite 

$2,989 

7.3 

3.7 

84 

hourly labor rate is ($34.60/hr) + (0.05 x $82.23/hr) + (0.1 x $22.32/hr) = $40.94/hr.  Labor  

 

 

73 

 

2.  Person-hours per occurrence for CMS performance specification costs are based on the performance specification costs to certify CMS ($700) divided by the 

composite hourly labor rate ($40.94/hr). 

3.  Control device inspection cost already accounted for under monitoring costs. 
4.  Assume 8 hours for each facility to review the report of the initial performance test for pollutants and fugitive ash. 
5.  Assume 2 hours for each facility to review the report of the initial performance test for fugitive ash. 
6.  Assume 40 hours to review report of annual PM, CO, and HCl compliance reports. 
7.  The average recurrent burden and cost in the first 3 years after promulgation for the sources with recurrent burden are equal to the person-hours added down 

each column for technical, management, and clerical and the sum of the cost column.

C.  Annual Costs (with landfill tip fee), $/yr 
  50 mile round trip 
  100 mile round trip 
  200 mile round trip 

Equation 

 

= $0.266/ton-mile x 50 miles + landfill tip fee 
= $0.266/ton-mile x 100 miles + landfill tip fee 
= $0.266/ton-mile x 200 miles + landfill tip fee 

= Total annual cost x (C x 0.67) x H

Notes: 
Values derived from LandGEM V3.02, using the following defaults: 
k = 0.06 k value based on default IPCC value for sewage sludge in dry, temperate climate. 
Lo = 42 Inventory default Lo for MSW = 100 for conventional climate (dry, temperate); CAA default Lo for MSW = 170 for conventional climate (dry, 

8,025 

8,025 

 

temperate).  
Sewage sludge Lo value calculated based on IPCC equation using default degradable organic carbon (DOC) value of 0.05 for sewage sludge. 
IPCC values for other Lo parameters are consistent with inventory defaults, so multplied the result by 1.7 to be consistent with CAA defaults.  

 
 
Methane in landfill gas = 50%
