I. Summary of the Proposed Rule 

The Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act, as amended (EPCA), specifies that 

any new or amended energy 
conservation standard the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) prescribes 
for the equipment covered by this notice 
shall be designed to ‘‘achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency * * * which the Secretary 
determines is technologically feasible 
and economically justified.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A) and 6316(e)(1)) 
Furthermore, the new or amended 
standard must ‘‘result in significant 
conservation of energy.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)(B) and 6316(e)(1)) In 
accordance with these and other 
statutory criteria discussed in this 
notice, DOE proposes to adopt new 
energy conservation standards for 
commercial ice-cream freezers; self- 
contained commercial refrigerators, 
commercial freezers, and commercial 
refrigerator-freezers without doors; and 
remote condensing commercial 
refrigerators, commercial freezers, and 
commercial refrigerator-freezers.1 The 
proposed standards, shown in Table I– 
1, would apply to all commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufactured 
on or after January 1, 2012, and offered 
for sale in the United States. 42 U.S.C. 
6313(c)(4)(A).

2 For this rulemaking, equipment class 

designations consist of a combination (in sequential 
order separated by periods) of: (1) an equipment 
family code (VOP = vertical open, SVO = 

semivertical open, HZO = horizontal open, VCT = 
vertical transparent doors, VCS = vertical solid 
doors, HCT = horizontal transparent doors, HCS = 
horizontal solid doors, or SOC = service over 
counter); (2) an operating mode code (RC = remote 
condensing or SC = self-contained); and ( 3) a rating 
temperature code (M = medium temperature (38 °F), 

L = low temperature (0 °F), or I = ice-cream 
temperature (¥15 °F)). For example, ‘‘VOP.RC.M’’ 
refers to the ‘‘vertical open, remote condensing, 
medium temperature’’ equipment class. See 
discussion below and chapter 3 of the TSD, market 
and technology assessment, for a more detailed 
explanation of the equipment class terminology.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

DOE’s analyses indicate that the 

proposed energy conservation 
standards, trial standard level (TSL) 4 
(see Section V.A for a detailed 
description of TSLs), would save a 
significant amount of energy—an 
estimated 0.83 quadrillion British 
thermal units (Btu), or quads, of 
cumulative energy over 30 years (2012– 
2042). The economic impacts on 
commercial consumers (i.e., the average 
life-cycle cost (LCC) savings) are 
positive for all equipment classes. 

The cumulative national net present 
value (NPV) of the proposed standards 
at TSL 4 from 2012 to 2042 ranges from 
$1.1 billion (at a seven percent discount 
rate) to $3.24 billion (at a three percent 
discount rate), in 2007$. This is the 
estimated total value of future operating 
cost savings minus the estimated 
increased equipment costs, discounted 
to 2007$. The benefits and costs of the 
standard can also be expressed in terms 
of annualized 2007$ values over the 
forecast period 2012 through 2062. 
Using a 7 percent discount rate for the 
annualized cost analysis, the cost of the 
standard is estimated to be $109 million 
per year in increased equipment and 
installation costs while the annualized 
benefits are expected to be $214 million 
per year in reduced equipment 
operating costs. Using a 3 percent 
discount rate, the annualized cost of the 
standard is expected to be $92 million 
per year while the annualized benefits 
of today’s standard are expected to be 
$234 million per year. See Section V.B.3 
for additional details. If DOE adopts the 
proposed standards, it expects 
manufacturers will lose 8 to 35 percent 
of the industry net present value (INPV), 
which is approximately $40 to $180 
million. 

DOE estimates that the proposed 
standards will have environmental 
benefits leading to reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., 
cumulative (undiscounted) emission 
reductions) of 44 million tons (Mt) of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) from 2012 to 
2042.3 Most of the energy saved is 
electricity. In addition, DOE expects the 
energy savings from the proposed 
standards to eliminate the need for 
approximately 640 megawatts (MW) of 
generating capacity by 2042. These 
results reflect DOE’s use of energy price 
projections from the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA)’s 

3 Additionally, the standards would result in 17 

thousand tons (kt) of nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
emissions reductions or generate a similar amount 
of NOX emissions allowance credits in areas where 
such emissions are subject to regulatory or 
voluntary emissions caps.

Annual Energy Outlook 2007 (AEO 
2007).4 

DOE proposes that TSL 4 represents 
the maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified. DOE 
proposes that the benefits to the Nation 
of TSL 4 (energy savings, commercial 
consumer average LCC savings, national 
NPV increase, and emission reductions) 
outweigh the costs (loss of manufacturer 
INPV) and is therefore proposing TSL 4 
as the energy conservation standards for 
commercial refrigeration equipment in 
this NOPR. TSL 4 is technologically 
feasible because the technologies 
required to achieve these levels already 
exist. 

In this NOPR, DOE proposes that TSL 
5 is not economically justified because, 
under the current circumstances, DOE 
believes that the benefits to the Nation 
of TSL 5 (energy savings, commercial 
consumer average LCC savings, and 
emission reductions) do not outweigh 
the costs (national NPV decrease and 
loss of manufacturer INPV). DOE’s 
analyses indicate that TSL 5 would save 
a greater amount of energy than TSL 4— 
an estimated 1.21 quadrillion quads of 
cumulative energy over 30 years (2012– 
2042). At TSL 5, while the economic 
impacts on commercial consumers (i.e., 
LCC savings and NPV) are still positive 
for the majority of equipment classes, 
the impacts on commercial customers 
for five classes (VOP.RC.M, VOP.SC.M, 
SVO.RC.M, SVO.SC.M, and SOC.RC.M) 
are negative. The life-cycle cost savings 
are negative for three classes and NPV 
results for each of these five classes are 
negative. 

The cumulative NPV at TSL 5, from 

2012 to 2042, ranges from ¥$200 
million (at a seven percent discount 
rate) to $1.16 billion (at a three percent 
discount rate), in 2007$. Using a 7 
percent discount rate, the annualized 
cost of the standard is estimated to be 
$285 million per year in increased 
equipment and installation costs while 
the annualized benefits are expected to 
be $266 million per year in reduced 
equipment operating costs. Using a 3 
percent discount rate, the annualized 
cost of the standard is expected to be 
$241 million per year while the 
annualized benefits are expected to be 

4 DOE intends to use EIA’s AEO 2008 to generate 

the results for the final rule. The AEO2008 Early 
Release contains reference case energy price 
forecasts which show higher commercial electricity 
prices at the national level compared with the AEO 
2007 on a real (inflation adjusted) basis. If these 
early release energy prices remain unchanged in the 
final release, then incorporation of the AEO 2008 
forecasts would likely result in reduced payback 
periods and greater life-cycle cost savings and 
greater national net present value for the proposed 
standards. 

$292 million per year. See Section V.B.3 
for additional details. At TSL 5, DOE 
expects manufacturers will lose 3 to 56 
percent of the industry net present value 
INPV, which is approximately $18 to 
$285 million. 

DOE based its estimates of the 

economic impacts referenced above on 
current costs for energy improving 
technologies used in commercial 
refrigeration equipment. A key 
technology for energy savings benefits 
in most commercial refrigeration 
equipment is the use of solid state 
lighting (i.e., light emitting diodes or 
LEDs). At current LED prices, the life- 
cycle cost savings at TSL 5 are 
substantially lower than TSL 3 and TSL 
4 for several equipment classes. For 
example, the average per unit LCC 
savings for the VOP.RC.M equipment 
class is $1,551 at TSL 3, but this number 
falls by $1,785 to ¥$234 when moving 
to TSL 5. When accounting for the 
projected volume of sales for these 
equipment classes in 2012, the net effect 
of moving from TSL 3 to TSL 5 is a 
decrease in LCC savings of $130 million 
per year. To achieve the same or greater 
LCC savings at TSL 5 as other efficiency 
levels (e.g., TSL 3 or 4), for all 
equipment classes, average LED costs 
would need to decrease by almost 45 
percent. 

While considerable information is 
available that suggests LED costs are 
likely to decline more than assumed in 
DOE’s analysis, DOE believes it must 
have a higher degree of confidence of 
further cost reductions than assumed in 
today’s proposed rule. In this NOPR, 
DOE projected future LED costs based 
on DOE’s Multi-Year Program Plan,5 
which are consistent with historical 
LED price reductions between 2000 and 
2007. The Multi-Year Program Plan 
projects that LED chip costs will 
continue to decrease at a compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 
approximately ¥27 percent between 
2007 and 2012, which represents a price 
reduction of 80 percent over that time 
period. Since LED chips are only a 
portion of the total LED system (other 
components include power supply and 
the LED fixture), the 80 percent 
reduction in chip costs contributes to an 
estimated decrease in total LED system 
cost of approximately 50 percent by 
2012, assuming the costs of the power 
supply and LED fixtures do not change 
significantly. Such a decrease in cost

would be sufficient for TSL 5 to achieve 
LCC savings equal to or greater than 
other TSLs. 

DOE examined whether the projected 

LED costs presented in the Multi-Year 
Program Plan and used in this NOPR are 
consistent with publicly available 
empirical historical cost data. DOE 
reviewed available price data for the 
LED market and found that between 
2000 and 2007, white-light LEDs had a 
CAGR ranging from approximately ¥18 
to ¥31 percent. DOE’s LED cost 
projection (i.e., ¥27 percent CAGR) 
falls within the range of CAGRs 
observed. DOE expanded its 
examination by comparing this 
projected trend to the red-light LED 
market, which is a related technology, 
with cost information spanning 
approximately three decades (i.e., 1973 
to 2005). DOE found that the CAGR of 
red-light LED costs was ¥22 percent 
over this longer time span. The trend in 
red-light LED costs derived from 
empirical data over this longer time 
period is of a similar magnitude to 
DOE’s projected costs for white-light 
LEDs. Due to the technological 
similarities between red-light LEDs and 
white-light LEDs, DOE believes that the 
historical cost reductions for red-light 
LEDs are indicative of future cost 
reductions for white-light LEDs. 
Furthermore, the white-light LED 
market is undergoing a massive 
expansion and growth phase, with 
significant investment, new products 
and innovative applications for LED 
technology, including illumination of 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
See Section V.C of this NOPR and 
Appendix B of the technical support 
document (TSD) for more detail on the 
cost projection and DOE’s validation of 
those estimates. DOE seeks comment on 
the extent to which these price trends 
are indicative of what can be expected 
for commercial refrigeration equipment 
LED lighting from 2007 to 2012 and the 
extent to which the cost reduction 
observed for red-light LEDs is relevant 
to DOE’s cost projections for white-light 
LEDs. DOE also seeks comment on the 
extent to which stakeholders expect 
projected LED cost reductions would 
occur, the timing of the projected LED 
cost reductions, and the certainty of the 
projected LED cost reductions. Finally, 
considering the rapid development of 
LED technology and the steady 
reductions in cost, DOE seeks comment 
on the extent to which manufacturers 
would adopt LED technology into the 
design of commercial refrigeration 
equipment in the absence of standards. 

DOE also performed sensitivity 

analyses of the effect of projected cost 
reductions in LED lighting systems on

LCC and NPV. Incorporation of DOE 
LED lighting system cost projections of 
a 50 percent decline by 2012 shift the 
calculated NPV, for 2012–2042, from 
¥$200 million to a positive $1.62 
billion at a seven percent discount rate, 
for TSL 5. See Section V.C of this NOPR 
or Chapter 8 of the TSD for additional 
details. 

TSL 5 is estimated to have 

environmental benefits leading to 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
of 63 Mt of CO2 from 2012 to 2042. 
Additionally, TSL 5 would result in 23 
kt of NOX emissions reductions or 
generate a similar amount of NOX 
emissions allowance credits in areas 
where such emissions are subject to 
emissions caps. Most of the energy 
saved is electricity. In addition, DOE 
expects the energy savings from the 
proposed standards to eliminate the 
need for approximately 930 MW of 
generating capacity by 2042. 

Although DOE has tentatively rejected 

TSL 5 because, under the current 
circumstances, it tentatively found that 
the benefits to the Nation do not 
outweigh the costs, and therefore does 
not consider TSL 5 economically 
justified, DOE expects that LED costs 
will decline substantially over the next 
4–5 years and could have a dramatic 
effect on the economic impacts 
described above. Therefore, DOE 
requests data or information that could 
provide a greater level of confidence 
that the projected LED cost reductions 
will occur and DOE will assess that data 
in determining whether to further 
consider TSL 5 in its final rule analysis. 
II. Introduction 
A. Overview 

DOE proposes to set energy 

conservation standards for commercial 
refrigeration equipment at the levels 
shown in Table I–1. The proposed 
standards would apply to equipment 
manufactured on or after January 1, 
2012, and offered for sale in the United 
States. DOE has tentatively found that 
the standards would save a significant 
amount of energy (see Section III.C.2) 
and result in a cleaner environment. In 
the 30-year period after the new 
standard becomes effective, the Nation 
would tentatively save 0.83 quads of 
primary energy. These energy savings 
also would tentatively result in 
significantly reduced emissions of air 
pollutants and greenhouse gases 
associated with electricity production, 
by avoiding the emission of 44 Mt of 
CO2 and 17 kt of NOX. In addition, DOE 
expects the standard to prevent the 
construction of the new power plants 
that would be necessary to produce 

approximately 640 MW by 2042. In 
total, DOE tentatively estimates the net 
present value to the Nation of this 
standard to be $1.1 billion from 2012 to 
2042 in 2007$. 

Commercial customers would see 

benefits from the proposed standards. 
Although DOE expects the price of the 
higher efficiency commercial 
refrigeration equipment to be 
approximately 11 percent higher than 
the average price of this equipment 
today, weighted by shipments across 
equipment classes, the energy efficiency 
gains would result in lower energy 
costs, saving customers about 26 percent 
per year on their energy bills. Based on 
DOE’s LCC analysis, DOE tentatively 
estimates that the mean payback period 
for the higher efficiency commercial 
refrigeration equipment would be 
between a low of 1.4 to a high of 6.1 
years. In addition, when the net results 
of these price increases and energy cost 
savings are summed over the lifetime of 
the higher efficiency equipment, 
customers could save approximately 
$690 to $3800, depending on equipment 
class, compared to their expenditures on 
today’s baseline commercial 
refrigeration equipment. 
B. Authority 

Title III of EPCA sets forth a variety 

of provisions designed to improve 
energy efficiency. Part A of Title III (42 
U.S.C. 6291–6309) provides for the 
Energy Conservation Program for 
Consumer Products Other Than 
Automobiles. Part A–1 of Title III (42 
U.S.C. 6311–6317) establishes a similar 
program for certain types of commercial 
and industrial equipment.6 The Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005), Pub. 
L. 109–58, included an amendment to 
Part A–1 requiring that DOE prescribe 
energy conservation standards for the 
commercial refrigeration equipment that 
is the subject of this rulemaking. 
(EPACT 2005, Section 136(c); 42 U.S.C. 
6313(c)(4)(A)) Hence, DOE publishes 
today’s notice of proposed rulemaking 
(NOPR) pursuant to Part A–1, which 
provides definitions, test procedures, 
labeling provisions, energy conservation 
standards, and the authority to require 
information and reports from 
manufacturers. The test procedures for 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
appear at Title 10 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Sections 431.63 and 
431.64. 

EPCA provides criteria for prescribing 

new or amended standards for covered 
equipment. As indicated above, any 

6 This part was originally titled Part C, however, 
it was renamed Part A–1 after Part B of Title III was 
repealed by EPACT 2005.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

new or amended standard for 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
must be designed to achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified.7 (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A) and 6316(e)(1)) But 
EPCA precludes DOE from adopting any 
standard that would not result in 
significant conservation of energy. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3) and 6316(e)(1)) 
Moreover, DOE may not prescribe a 
standard for certain equipment if no test 
procedure has been established for that 
equipment, or if DOE determines by rule 
that the standard is not technologically 
feasible or economically justified, and 
that such standard will not result in 
significant conservation of energy. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3) and 6316(e)(1)) EPCA 
also provides that, in deciding whether 
a standard is economically justified, 
DOE must determine whether the 
benefits of the standard exceed its 
burdens after receiving comments on 
the proposed standard. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 6316(e)(1)) To the 
greatest extent practicable, DOE must 
consider the following seven factors: 

(I) The economic impact of the 

standard on manufacturers and 
consumers of the equipment subject to 
the standard; 

(II) The savings in operating costs 

throughout the estimated average life of 
the covered equipment in the type (or 
class) compared to any increase in the 
price, initial charges, or maintenance 
expenses for the equipment that are 
likely to result from the imposition of 
the standard; 

(III) The total projected amount of 

energy savings likely to result directly 
from the imposition of the standard; 

(IV) Any lessening of the utility or the 

performance of the covered equipment 
likely to result from the imposition of 
the standard; 

(V) The impact of any lessening of 

competition, as determined in writing 
by the Attorney General, that is likely to 
result from the imposition of the 
standard; 

(VI) The need for national energy 

conservation; and 

(VII) Other factors the Secretary 

considers relevant. 
Id. 

Furthermore, the Secretary may not 
prescribe an amended or new standard 

7 This notice concerns types of ‘‘covered 

equipment’’ as that term is defined in EPCA, (42 
U.S.C. 6311(1)(E)) in Part A–1, Certain Industrial 
Equipment. Therefore, when DOE quotes from, 
paraphrases or describes general provisions in Part 
A, for instance, 42 U.S.C. 6295(o), it substitutes the 
term ‘‘equipment’’ for ‘‘product’’ when the latter 
term appears in those provisions. (See 42 U.S.C. 
6316 (a)(3))

if interested persons have established by 
a preponderance of the evidence that 
the standard is likely to result in the 
unavailability in the United States of 
any equipment type (or class) with 
performance characteristics (including 
reliability), features, sizes, capacities, 
and volumes that are substantially the 
same as those generally available in the 
United States. (42 U.S.C. 6295 (o)(4) and 
6316(e)(1)) In addition, there is a 
rebuttable presumption that a standard 
level is economically justified if the 
Secretary finds that ‘‘the additional cost 
to the consumer of purchasing 
equipment complying with an energy 
conservation standard level will be less 
than three times the value of the energy 
* * * savings during the first year that 
the consumer will receive as a result of 
the standard, as calculated under the 
applicable test procedure * * *.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii) and 6316(e)(1)) 
The rebuttable presumption test is an 
alternative path to establishing 
economic justification. 

Section 325(q)(1) of EPCA addresses 

the situation where DOE sets a standard 
for a type or class of covered equipment 
that has two or more groups of covered 
equipment. DOE must specify a 
different standard level than that which 
applies generally to such equipment 
‘‘for any group of covered equipment 
which have the same function or 
intended use, if * * * equipment 
within such group—(A) consume a 
different kind of energy from that 
consumed by other covered equipment 
within such type (or class); or (B) have 
a capacity or other performance-related 
feature which other equipment within 
such type (or class) do not have and 
such feature justifies a higher or lower 
standard’’ than applies or will apply to 
the other equipment. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(q)(1) and 6316(e)(1)) In 
determining whether a performance- 
related feature justifies a different 
standard for a group of equipment, DOE 
must ‘‘consider such factors as the 
utility to the consumer of such a 
feature’’ and other factors DOE deems 
appropriate. Any rule prescribing such 
a standard must include an explanation 
of the basis on which a higher or lower 
level was established. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(q)(2) and 6316(e)(1)) 

Finally, Federal energy conservation 

requirements for commercial equipment 
generally supersede State laws or 
regulations concerning energy 
conservation testing, labeling, and 
standards for such equipment. (42 
U.S.C. 6316(a)–(b)) For the commercial 
refrigeration equipment covered by this 
rulemaking, Federal energy 
conservation requirements will 
supersede all such State laws or 

regulations beginning on the date of 
publication of the Federal standards, 
except that any state or local standard 
issued before that time will be 
superseded only when the Federal 
standards take effect. (42 U.S.C. 
6316(e)(3)) Furthermore, DOE can grant 
waivers of preemption to any State laws 
or regulations that are superseded in 
accordance with the procedures and 
other provisions of Section 327(d) of the 
Act. (42 U.S.C. 6297(d) and 6316(e)(3)) 
C. Background 
1. Current Standards 

There are no national energy 
conservation standards for the 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
covered by this rulemaking. EPACT 
2005 did amend EPCA to establish 
energy conservation standards that will 
apply to certain other types of 
commercial refrigerators, freezers, and 
refrigerator-freezers when manufactured 
on or after January 1, 2010. (42 U.S.C. 
6313(c)(2)–(3)) Those standards are not 
at issue in this rulemaking. 
2. History of Standards Rulemaking for 
Commercial Refrigeration Equipment 

On August 8, 2005, Section 136(c) of 
EPACT 2005 amended EPCA, in part to 
direct DOE to issue energy conservation 
standards for the equipment covered by 
this rulemaking, which standards would 
apply to equipment manufactured on or 
after January 1, 2012. (42 U.S.C. 
6313(c)(4)(A)) Section 136(a)(3) of 
EPACT 2005 also amended EPCA, by 
adding definitions for terms relevant to 
this equipment. (42 U.S.C. 6311(9)) In 
defining the term ‘‘commercial 
refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator- 
freezer,’’ EPCA states that this 
refrigeration equipment is connected to 
either a self-contained condensing unit 
or to a remote condensing unit. 42 
U.S.C. 6311(9)(A)(vii). Subsequently, 
EPCA defines the terms ‘‘remote 
condensing unit’’ and ‘‘self-contained 
condensing unit.’’ 42 U.S.C. 6311(9)(E)– 
(F). These are the two condenser 
configurations of equipment covered by 
this rulemaking. 

On December 19, 2006, the Energy 

Independence and Security Act of 2007 
(EISA 2007) was signed into law by the 
President. This legislation affected some 
of the products for which DOE had 
rulemakings underway. However, it did 
not create any additional requirements 
for commercial refrigeration equipment. 

As an initial step to comply with 

EPCA’s mandate to issue standards for 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
and to commence this rulemaking, on 
April 25, 2006, DOE published notice of 
a public meeting and of the availability

of its Framework Document for this 
rulemaking. 71 FR 23876. The 
Framework Document described the 
procedural and analytical approaches 
that DOE anticipated using to evaluate 
energy conservation standards for 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
and identified various issues to be 
resolved in conducting the rulemaking. 
DOE held a public meeting on May 16, 
2006 to present the contents of the 
Framework Document, describe the 
analyses it planned to conduct during 
the rulemaking, obtain public comment 
on these subjects, and inform and 
facilitate interested persons’ 
involvement in the rulemaking. DOE 
also gave interested persons an 
opportunity, after the public meeting, to 
submit written statements in response to 
the Framework Document. DOE 
received five statements. 

On July 26, 2007, DOE published an 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking 
(ANOPR) concerning energy 
conservation standards for commercial 
refrigeration equipment. 72 FR 41161. In 
the ANOPR, DOE described and sought 
comment on its proposed equipment 
classes for this rulemaking, and on the 
analytical framework, models, and tools 
(e.g., LCC and national energy savings 
(NES) spreadsheets) that DOE used to 
analyze the impacts of energy 
conservation standards for commercial 
refrigeration equipment. In conjunction 
with the ANOPR, DOE also published 
on its Web site the complete ANOPR 
TSD. The TSD included the results of 
DOE’s preliminary (1) engineering 
analysis, (2) markups analysis to 
determine equipment price, (3) energy 
use characterization, (4) LCC and 
payback period (PBP) analyses, (5) NES 
and national impact analyses (NIA), and 
(6) manufacturer impact analysis (MIA). 
In the ANOPR, DOE requested comment 
on these results, and on a range of other 
issues. These issues included 
equipment classes, definitions for air- 
curtain angle and door angle, case 
lighting operating hours, operation and 
maintenance practices, equipment 
lifetime, LCC baseline levels, NIA base 
case, base case and standards case 
forecasts, differential impact of new 
standards on future shipments, selection 
of standard levels for post-ANOPR 
analysis, the equation that expresses the 
energy conservation standards, and the 
nature of standards for commercial 
refrigerator-freezers. 

DOE held a public meeting in 

Washington, DC on August 23, 2007, to 
present the methodology and results of 
the ANOPR analyses, and to solicit both 
oral and written comments from the 
interested persons who attended. Public 
comment focused on DOE’s 

assumptions, approach, and equipment 
class breakdown, and are addressed in 
detail in this NOPR. 
III. General Discussion 
A. Test Procedures 

On December 8, 2006, DOE published 

a final rule in which it adopted 
American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI)/Air-Conditioning and 
Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Standard 
1200–2006, Performance Rating of 
Commercial Refrigerated Display 
Merchandisers and Storage Cabinets, as 
the DOE test procedure for this 
equipment. 71 FR 71340, 71369–70; 10 
CFR 431.63–431.64. ANSI/ARI Standard 
1200–2006 contains rating temperature 
specifications of 38 °F (±2 °F) for 
commercial refrigerators and refrigerator 
compartments, 0 °F (±2 °F) for 
commercial freezers and freezer 
compartments, and ¥5 °F (±2 °F) for 
commercial ice-cream freezers. The 
standard also requires performance tests 
to be conducted according to the 
American Society of Heating, 
Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning 
Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 72–2005, 
Method of Testing Commercial 
Refrigerators and Freezers. In this final 
rule, DOE also adopted a ¥15 °F (±2 °F) 
rating temperature for commercial ice- 
cream freezers. 71 FR 71370. In 
addition, DOE adopted ANSI/ 
Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers (AHAM) Standard HRF– 
1–2004, Energy, Performance and 
Capacity of Household Refrigerators, 
Refrigerator-Freezers and Freezers, for 
determining compartment volumes for 
this equipment. 71 FR 71369–70. 
B. Technological Feasibility 
1. General 

DOE considers design options 

technologically feasible if industry 
already uses these options or if research 
has progressed to the development of a 
working prototype. ‘‘Technologies 
incorporated in commercially available 
equipment or in working prototypes 
will be considered technologically 
feasible.’’ 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart C, 
Appendix A, Section 4(a)(4)(i). 

In each standards rulemaking, DOE 

conducts a screening analysis, which it 
bases on information it has gathered 
regarding all current technology options 
and prototype designs. In consultation 
with interested parties, DOE develops a 
list of design options for consideration 
in the rulemaking. All technologically 
feasible design options are candidates in 
this initial assessment. Early in the 
process, DOE eliminates from 
consideration any design option (a) that 
is not practicable to manufacture, 

install, or service; (b) that will have 
adverse impacts on equipment utility or 
availability; or (c) for which there are 
health or safety concerns that cannot be 
resolved. Chapter 4 of the TSD 
accompanying this notice contains a 
description of the screening analysis for 
this rulemaking. 

In the ANOPR, DOE eliminated five of 

the technologies considered in the 
market and technology assessment: (1) 
Air-curtain design, (2) thermoacoustic 
refrigeration, (3) magnetic refrigeration, 
(4) electro-hydrodynamic heat 
exchangers, and (5) copper rotor motors. 
Because all five of these technologies 
are in the research stage, DOE believes 
that they would not be practicable to 
manufacture, install and service on the 
scale necessary to serve the relevant 
market at the time of the effective date 
of the standard. In addition, because 
these technologies are in the research 
stage, DOE cannot assess whether they 
would have any adverse impacts on 
utility to significant subgroups of 
consumers, result in the unavailability 
of any types of equipment, or present 
any significant adverse impacts on 
health or safety. Therefore, DOE did not 
consider these technologies as design 
options for improving the energy 
efficiency of commercial refrigeration 
equipment. DOE believes that all the 
efficiency levels discussed in today’s 
notice are technologically feasible 
because there is equipment either in the 
market or in working prototypes at all 
of the efficiency levels analyzed. See 
Chapter 4 of the TSD for further 
discussion of the screening analysis. 
2. Maximum Technologically Feasible 
Levels 

In deciding whether to adopt a new 

standard for a type or class of 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
DOE must ‘‘determine the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency or 
maximum reduction in energy use that 
is technologically feasible’’ for such 
equipment. (42 U.S.C. 6295(p)(1) and 
6316(e)(1)) If such standard is not 
designed to achieve such efficiency or 
use, the Secretary shall state the reasons 
such is the case in the proposed rule. Id. 
For this rulemaking, DOE determined 
that the values in Table III–1 represent 
the energy use levels that would achieve 
the maximum reductions in energy use 
that are technologically feasible at this 
time for commercial refrigeration 
equipment. DOE identified these ‘‘max- 
tech’’ levels for the equipment classes 
analyzed as part of the engineering 
analysis (Chapter 5 of the TSD). For 
each equipment class, DOE applied the 
most efficient design options available

C. Energy Savings 
1. Determination of Savings 

DOE used the NES spreadsheet to 

estimate energy savings. The 
spreadsheet forecasts energy savings 
over the period of analysis for TSLs 
relative to the base case. DOE quantified 
the energy savings attributable to an 
energy conservation standard as the 
difference in energy consumption 
between the trial standards case and the 
base case. The base case represents the 
forecast of energy consumption in the 
absence of new mandatory efficiency 
standards. The NES spreadsheet model 
is described in Section IV.G of this 
notice and in Chapter 11 of the TSD 
accompanying this notice. 

The NES spreadsheet model 

calculates the energy savings in site 
energy or kilowatt hours (kWh). Site 
energy is the energy directly consumed 
at building sites by commercial 
refrigeration equipment. DOE expresses 
national energy savings in terms of the 
source energy savings, which are the 
energy savings used to generate and 
transmit the energy consumed at the 
site. Chapter 11 of the TSD contains a 
table of factors used to convert kWh to 
Btu. DOE derives these conversion 
factors, which change with time, from 
DOE’s EIA’s AEO2007. 
2. Significance of Savings 

For commercial refrigeration 

equipment, EPCA prohibits DOE from 
adopting a standard that would not 
result in significant additional energy 
savings. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B) and 

6316(e)(1)) While the term ‘‘significant’’ 
is not defined in the Act, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals, in Natural Resources 
Defense Council v. Herrington, 768 F.2d 
1355, 1373 (D.C. Cir. 1985), indicated 
that Congress intended significant 
energy savings in this context to be 
savings that were not ‘‘genuinely 
trivial.’’ The estimated energy savings 
for all of the trial standard levels 
considered in this rulemaking are 
nontrivial, and therefore DOE considers 
them significant within the meaning of 
Section 325 of the Act. 
D. Economic Justification 
1. Specific Criteria 

As noted earlier, EPCA provides 

seven factors to be evaluated in 
determining whether an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified. The following sections discuss 
how DOE has addressed each factor thus 
far in this rulemaking. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 6316(e)(1)) 
a. Economic Impact on Manufacturers 
and Commercial Customers 

DOE uses an annual cash-flow 

approach in determining the 
quantitative impacts of a new or 
amended standard on manufacturers. 
This includes both a short-term 
assessment based on the cost and capital 
requirements between the 
announcement of a regulation and when 
the regulation comes into effect, and a 
long-term assessment. Impacts analyzed 
include INPV, cash flows by year, and 
changes in revenue and income. Next, 

DOE analyzes and reports the impacts 
on different types of manufacturers, 
with particular attention to impacts on 
small manufacturers. DOE then 
considers the impact of standards on 
domestic manufacturer employment, 
manufacturing capacity, plant closures, 
and loss of capital investment. Finally, 
DOE takes into account the cumulative 
impact of regulations on manufacturers. 
For commercial consumers, measures 

of economic impact are generally the 
changes in installed cost and annual 
operating costs, i.e., the LCC. Chapter 6 
of the TSD presents the LCC of the 
equipment at each TSL. The LCC is one 
of the seven factors to be considered in 
determining the economic justification 
for a new or amended standard. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(II) and 
6316(e)(1)) It is discussed in the 
paragraphs that follow. 
b. Life-Cycle Costs 

The LCC is the sum of the purchase 

price, including the installation and 
operating expense (i.e., operating 
energy, maintenance, and repair 
expenditures) discounted over the 
lifetime of the equipment. To determine 
the purchase price including 
installation, DOE estimated the markups 
that distributors and contractors add to 
the manufacturer selling price (MSP); 
DOE also estimated installation costs 
from an analysis of commercial 
refrigeration equipment installation 
costs for each equipment class. DOE 
determined that preventative 
maintenance costs do not depend on 
efficiency but that repair costs increase

with efficiency and that the cost of 
replacement lighting fixtures (‘‘lighting 
maintenance’’) increased with higher 
efficiency. See Sections IV.E.8 and 
IV.E.9 for more detail. In estimating 
operating energy costs, DOE used 
average effective commercial electricity 
prices at the State level from the EIA 
publication, State Energy Consumption, 
Price, and Expenditure Estimates. DOE 
modified the 2006 average commercial 
electricity prices to reflect the average 
electricity prices for each of the four 
types of businesses examined in this 
analysis. The LCC analysis compares the 
LCCs of equipment designed to meet 
possible energy conservation standards 
with the LCCs of equipment likely to be 
installed in the absence of standards. 
The LCC analysis also identifies a range 
of energy price forecasts for the 
electricity prices used in the economic 
analyses and provides results showing 
the sensitivity of the LCC results to 
these price forecasts. 

Recognizing that each commercial 

building that uses commercial 
refrigeration equipment is unique, DOE 
analyzed variability and uncertainty by 
performing the LCC and PBP 
calculations for two prototype 
commercial buildings (i.e., stores) and 
four types of businesses (two types of 
businesses for each prototype store). 
The first store prototype is a large 
grocery store, which encompasses 
supermarkets and wholesaler/retailer 
multi-line stores such as big-box stores, 
warehouse stores, and supercenters. The 
second prototype is a small store, which 
encompasses convenience stores and 
small specialty stores such as meat 
markets; wine, beer, and liquor stores; 
and convenience stores associated with 
gasoline stations. Various types of 
commercial refrigeration equipment can 
serve a given type of store’s refrigeration 
needs. DOE gives the LCC savings as a 
distribution, with a mean value and a 
range. DOE developed average discount 
rates for each of four business types 
analyzed, ranging from 5.1 to 8.4 
percent for the calculations, and 
assumed that the customer purchases 
the equipment in 2012. Chapter 8 of the 
TSD contains the details of the LCC 
calculations. 
c. Energy Savings 

While significant energy conservation 

is a separate statutory requirement for 
imposing an energy conservation 
standard, EPCA requires DOE, in 
determining the economic justification 
of such a standard, to consider the total 
projected energy savings that are 
expected to result directly from the 
standard. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(III) 
and 6316(e)(1)) DOE used the NES

spreadsheet results in its consideration 
of total projected savings. Section IV.G.1 
of this notice discusses the savings 
figures. 
d. Lessening of Utility or Performance of 
Equipment 

In establishing equipment classes, 

evaluating design options, and assessing 
the impact of potential standard levels, 
DOE tried to avoid having new 
standards for commercial refrigeration 
equipment lessen the utility or 
performance of the equipment under 
consideration in this rulemaking. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV) and 
6316(e)(1)) None of the proposed trial 
standard levels considered in this 
rulemaking involve changes in 
equipment design or unusual 
installation requirements that would 
reduce the utility or performance of the 
equipment. See Chapter 4 and Chapter 
16 of the TSD for more detail. 
e. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 

EPCA directs DOE to consider any 

lessening of competition likely to result 
from standards. It directs the Attorney 
General to determine in writing the 
impact, if any, of any lessening of 
competition likely to result from 
imposition of a proposed standard. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and (ii); and 
6316(e)(1)) DOE has transmitted a 
written request to the Attorney General 
soliciting a written determination on 
this issue. 
f. Need of the Nation to Conserve Energy 

The non-monetary benefits of the 

proposed standard are likely to be 
reflected in improvements to the 
security and reliability of the Nation’s 
energy system. Reductions in the overall 
demand for energy will reduce the 
Nation’s reliance on foreign sources of 
energy and increase reliability of the 
Nation’s electricity system. DOE 
conducts a utility impact analysis to 
show the reduction in installed 
generation capacity. Reduced power 
demand (including peak power 
demand) generally improves the 
security and reliability of the energy 
system. 

The proposed standard also is likely 

to result in improvements to the 
environment. In quantifying these 
improvements, DOE has defined a range 
of primary energy conversion factors 
and associated emission reductions 
based on the generation that energy 
conservation standards displaced. DOE 
reports the environmental effects from 
each trial standard level for this 
equipment in the environmental 

assessment in the TSD. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 6316(e)(1)) 
g. Other Factors 

EPCA allows the Secretary of Energy, 

in determining whether a standard is 
economically justified, to consider any 
other factors the Secretary deems to be 
relevant. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII) 
and 6316(e)(1)) Under this provision, 
DOE considered LCC impacts on 
identifiable groups of customers, such 
as customers of different business types, 
who may be disproportionately affected 
by any national energy conservation 
standard level. In particular, DOE 
examined the LCC impact on 
independent small grocery/convenience 
store businesses where both higher 
discount rates and lack of access to 
national account equipment purchases 
might disproportionately affect those 
business types when compared to the 
overall commercial refrigeration 
equipment market. 
2. Rebuttable Presumption 

Another criterion for determining 

whether a standard level is 
economically justified is the following 
rebuttable presumption test: 

If the Secretary finds that the additional 

cost to the consumer of purchasing 
equipment complying with an energy 
conservation standard level will be less than 
three times the value of the energy * * * 
savings during the first year that the 
consumer will receive as a result of the 
standard, as calculated under the applicable 
test procedure, there shall be a rebuttable 
presumption that such standard level is 
economically justified. A determination by 
the Secretary that such criterion is not met 
shall not be taken into consideration in the 
Secretary’s determination of whether a 
standard is economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii) and 6316(e)(1)) 

If the initial price of equipment 

increases due to a conservation 
standard, and the consumer would 
recover the increase in energy savings in 
less than three years through reduced 
energy costs resulting from the standard, 
then DOE presumes that such standard 
is economically justified. This 
presumption of economic justification 
can be rebutted upon a proper showing. 
The rebuttable presumption payback 
calculation is discussed in Sections 
III.D.2 and V.B.1.b of this NOPR. 
IV. Methodology and Discussion of 
Comments 

DOE used two spreadsheet tools to 

determine the impact of energy 
conservation standards on the Nation. 
The first spreadsheet calculates LCCs 
and payback periods of potential new 
energy conservation standards. The 
second provides shipments forecasts

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

and then calculates national energy 
savings and net present value impacts of 
potential new energy conservation 
standards. DOE also assessed 
manufacturer impacts, largely through 
use of the Government Regulatory 
Impact Model (GRIM). 

Additionally, DOE estimated the 

impacts of energy conservation 
standards for commercial refrigeration 
equipment on utilities and the 
environment. DOE used a version of 
EIA’s National Energy Modeling System 
(NEMS) for the utility and 
environmental analyses. The NEMS 
model simulates the energy economy of 
the United States and has been 
developed over several years by the EIA 
primarily for the purpose of preparing 
the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO). The 
NEMS produces a widely known 
baseline forecast for the Nation through 
2025 that is available on the DOE Web 
site. The version of NEMS used for 
efficiency standards analysis is called 
NEMS–BT,8 and is based on the 
AEO2007 version with minor 
modifications. The NEMS offers a 
sophisticated picture of the effect of 
standards, since its scope allows it to 
measure the interactions between the 
various energy supply and demand 
sectors and the economy as a whole. 
A. Market and Technology Assessment 

When beginning an energy 

conservation standards rulemaking, 
DOE develops information that provides 
an overall picture of the market for the 
equipment concerned, including the 
purpose of the equipment, the industry 
structure, and market characteristics. 
This activity includes both quantitative 
and qualitative assessments based 
primarily on publicly available 
information. The subjects addressed in 
the market and technology assessment 
for this rulemaking (Chapter 3 of the 
TSD) include equipment classes, 
manufacturers, quantities, and types of 
equipment sold and offered for sale, 
retail market trends, and regulatory and 
non-regulatory programs. 

8 The EIA approves use of the name NEMS to 

describe only an AEO version of the model without 
any modification to code or data. Because the 
present analysis entails some minor code 
modifications and runs the model under various 
policy scenarios that deviate from AEO 
assumptions, the name NEMS–BT refers to the 
model used here. For more information on NEMS, 
refer to The National Energy Modeling System: An 
Overview 1998. DOE/EIA–0581 (98), February, 
1998. BT is DOE’s Building Technologies Program. 
NEMS–BT was formerly called NEMS–BRS.

1. Definitions Related to Commercial 
Refrigeration Equipment 
a. Air Curtain Angle Definition 

For equipment without doors, an air 

curtain divides the refrigerated 
compartment from the ambient space. 
DOE stated in the ANOPR that the 
orientation of the air curtain affects the 
energy consumption of both remote 
condensing and self-contained 
equipment, and that equipment without 
doors can be broadly categorized by the 
angle of the air curtain. DOE considered 
defining the air-curtain angle as ‘‘the 
angle between a vertical line and the 
line formed by the points at the center 
of the discharge air grille and the center 
of the return air grille, when viewed in 
cross-section.’’ DOE presented this 
definition in the ANOPR, 72 FR 41173, 
and for discussion at the ANOPR public 
meeting, and requested feedback. 

ARI and Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 
recommended that DOE slightly modify 
its definition of air-curtain angle to ‘‘the 
angle formed between a vertical line and 
the line formed by the points at the 
inside edge of the discharge air opening 
and the inside edge of the return air 
opening, when viewed in cross- 
section.’’ For equipment without doors 
and without a discharge air grille or 
discharge air honeycomb, the air curtain 
should be defined as ‘‘the angle between 
a vertical line extended down from the 
highest point on the manufacturer’s 
recommended load limit line and the 
same load limit line.’’ (ARI, No. 18 at p. 
2 and EEI, No. 15 at p. 2) DOE 
recognizes that these proposed 
definitions are consistent with industry- 
approved standards and is therefore 
including the suggested modifications to 
the definition for air-curtain angle in 
today’s proposed rule. 
b. Door Angle Definition 

For equipment with doors, DOE stated 
in the ANOPR that the orientation of the 
doors affects the energy consumption, 
and that equipment with doors can be 
broadly categorized by the angle of the 
door. DOE considered defining door 
angle as ‘‘the angle between a vertical 
line and the line formed by the plane of 
the door, when viewed in cross- 
section.’’ 72 FR 41174. DOE also 
presented this definition for discussion 
at the ANOPR public meeting and 
requested feedback. 

While stakeholders agreed with DOE’s 

proposed definition of door angle flat 
doors, it was not clear how DOE would 
define the door angle for curved doors 
such as those found on service over-the- 
counter cases. True stated that curved 
door angle should be defined by forming 
a plane between ‘‘the end plane and the 

end peak in-section.’’ (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 59) Southern 
California Edison (SCE) suggested 
defining door angle for curved doors in 
the way air-curtain angle is defined, by 
the angle formed between the vertical 
and a line drawn between the top and 
bottom edges. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 59) DOE is 
proposing its original definition of door 
angle for cases with flat doors. For cases 
with curved doors, DOE is not clear 
what True’s intent was in defining door 
angle, and no clarification was made in 
True’s written comments. DOE believes 
the approach suggested by SCE is 
appropriate because it accounts for the 
complex geometry of curved doors 
while still remaining consistent with the 
existing definition for air-curtain angle. 
Therefore, DOE is proposing to define 
door angle as ‘‘the angle formed 
between a vertical line and the straight 
line drawn by connecting the top and 
bottom points where the display area 
glass joins the cabinet, when the 
equipment is viewed in cross-section.’’ 
2. Equipment Classes 

When establishing energy 

conservation standards, DOE generally 
divides covered equipment into 
equipment classes by the type of energy 
used, capacity, or other performance- 
related features that affect efficiency. 
Different energy conservation standards 
may apply to different equipment 
classes. (42 U.S.C. 6295(q) and 
6316(e)(1)) 

Commercial refrigerators, commercial 

freezers, and commercial refrigerator- 
freezers can be divided into various 
equipment classes categorized largely by 
physical characteristics that affect 
energy efficiency. Some of these 
characteristics delineate the categories 
of equipment covered by this 
rulemaking.9 Most affect the 
merchandise that the equipment can be 
used to display, and how the customer 
can access that merchandise. Key 
physical characteristics that affect 
energy efficiency are the operating 
temperature, the presence or absence of 
doors (i.e., closed cases or open cases), 
the type of doors used (i.e., transparent 

9 ‘‘Commercial refrigerators, commercial freezers, 

and commercial refrigerator-freezers’’ is a type of 
covered commercial equipment. For purposes of 
discussion only in this proceeding, DOE uses the 
term ‘‘categories’’ to designate groupings of 
‘‘commercial refrigeration equipment.’’ The 
categories of equipment are: Self-contained 
commercial refrigerators, commercial freezers, and 
commercial refrigerator-freezers without doors; 
remote condensing commercial refrigerators, 
commercial freezers, and commercial refrigerator- 
freezers; and commercial ice-cream freezers. DOE 
will analyze specific equipment classes that fall 
within these general categories and set appropriate 
standards.

or solid), the angle of the door or air- 
curtain (i.e., horizontal, semivertical, or 
vertical) and the type of condensing unit 
(i.e., remote or self-contained). As 
discussed in the ANOPR, 72 FR 41173– 
77, and below, DOE has developed 
equipment classes in this rulemaking by 
(1) dividing commercial refrigerators, 
commercial freezers, and commercial 

refrigerator-freezers into equipment 
families, (2) subdividing these families 
based on condensing unit configurations 
and rating temperature designations, 
and (3) identifying the resulting classes 
that are within each of the three 
equipment categories covered by this 
rulemaking. 

DOE divided covered equipment into 

eight equipment families, which are 

shown in Table IV–1. Following the 
ANOPR, DOE did not receive any 
comments that it believes warranted 
changes to the eight equipment families 
proposed in the ANOPR and therefore, 
the eight families are unchanged. The 
two issues related to equipment family 
designations are discussed below. 

TABLE IV–1—EQUIPMENT FAMILY DESIGNATIONS 

Equipment family 

Description 

Vertical Open (VOP) ........................................... Equipment without doors and an air-curtain ≥ 0° and < 10° from the vertical. 
Semivertical Open (SVO) .................................... Equipment without doors and an air-curtain angle ≥ 10° and < 80° from the vertical. 
Horizontal Open (HZO) ....................................... Equipment without doors and an air-curtain angle ≥ 80° from the vertical. 
Vertical Closed Transparent (VCT) ..................... Equipment with hinged or sliding transparent doors and a door angle < 45°. 
Horizontal Closed Transparent (HCT) ................ Equipment with hinged or sliding transparent doors and a door angle ≥ 45°. 
Vertical Closed Solid (VCS) ................................ Equipment with hinged or sliding solid (opaque) doors and a door angle < 45°. 
Horizontal Closed Solid (HCS) ............................ Equipment with hinged or sliding solid (opaque) doors and a door angle ≥ 45°. 
Service Over Counter (SOC) .............................. Equipment  with  sliding  or  hinged  doors  intended  for  use  by  sales  personnel  and  fixed  or 

hinged glass for displaying merchandise. 

Within each of the eight equipment 

families is equipment that has one of the 
two condensing unit configurations, 
which are shown in Table IV–2. Because 

these are the only two condensing unit 
configurations used in commercial 
refrigeration equipment, and since DOE 
did not receive any comments on these 

configurations following the ANOPR, 
DOE did not make any changes. 

Condensing unit configuration 

Description 

TABLE IV–2—CONDENSING UNIT CONFIGURATION 

Remote Condensing (RC) .............. Condensing  unit  is  remotely  located  from  the  refrigerated  equipment  and  consists  of  one  or  more  refrig-
erant  compressors,  refrigerant  condensers,  condenser  fans  and  motors,  and  factory-supplied  acces-
sories. 

Self-Contained (SC) ........................ Condensing  unit  is  an  integral  part  of  the  refrigerated  equipment  and  consists  of  one  or  more  refrigerant 

compressors, refrigerant condensers, condenser fans and motors, and factory-supplied accessories. 

DOE is also organizing equipment 
classes based on the three operating 
temperature ranges shown in Table IV– 
3. Based on the temperature at which 
the equipment is designed to operate, it 
will fall into one of these operating 
temperature ranges. This is identified as 

Issue 3 under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE 
Seeks Comment’’ in Section VII.E of this 
NOPR. 

Each temperature range coincides 
with a rating temperature used in the 
test procedure final rule for the different 
equipment types. 10 CFR 431.64. 

Following the ANOPR, DOE did not 
receive any comments regarding the 
rating temperature designations 
proposed in the ANOPR, and therefore 
DOE did not make any changes to the 
rating temperature designations.

In the ANOPR, DOE responded to 

several comments and presented a 
discussion (Section II.A.2) of the air- 
curtain angle ranges used to delineate 
vertical, semivertical, and horizontal 
equipment families without doors (VOP, 
SVO, and HZO). 72 FR 41173–74. In 
comments received following the 
Framework document publication, some 
stakeholders felt that the air-curtain 

angle ranges used in the data provided 
by ARI might encourage manufacturers 
to redesign equipment to take advantage 
of less stringent standards. Specifically, 
the stakeholders were concerned that 
manufacturers of VOP.RC.M equipment 
(a high-volume equipment class) would 
make slight alterations in their designs 
that would shift the equipment to the 
SVO.RC.M equipment class. If this shift 

occurred for a large number of models, 
and if standards for SVO.RC.M 
equipment were significantly less 
stringent than standards for VOP.RC.M 
equipment, a significant amount of 
energy savings would be avoided. In 
other words, energy savings will be less 
than if that equipment was not modified 
and remained under the vertical 
classification. DOE responded to these

comments in the ANOPR, concurring 
with stakeholders’ concerns, and 
requesting any relevant data or feedback 
regarding the ranges of air-curtain angle 
proposed in the ANOPR. No further 
comments were received on this issue 
following the ANOPR. DOE is proposing 
standards for the SVO.RC.M equipment 
class that are virtually equivalent to 
standards for the VOP.RC.M equipment 
class (see the proposed rule language of 
this NOPR). As a result, DOE believes 
that the proposed standards eliminate 
motivation for market shifts between 
these equipment classes. However, to 
assure that no changes to the air-curtain 
ranges for the VOP, SVO, and HZO 
equipment families are warranted, DOE 
seeks comment on the possibility of 
market shifts between equipment 
classes based on the proposed 
standards. 

As discussed in the ANOPR, 72 FR 
41174 and during the ANOPR public 
meeting, DOE stated that it was 
considering defining two equipment 
families each for equipment with solid 
and transparent doors, based on door 
angles of 0° to 45° (vertical) and 45° to 
90° (horizontal). EEI stated that DOE 
should consider revising its definition 
of door angle, because it is unclear 
whether a door angle of 45° to be 
vertical or horizontal. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 58) DOE agrees 
with EEI that its previous designation 
did not specify what equipment family 
a unit with a 45° door angle would fall 
under. Therefore, DOE has tentatively 
decided that it will designate vertical 
equipment with transparent or solid 
doors as ‘‘equipment with hinged or 
sliding doors and a door angle less than 
45°,’’ and horizontal equipment with 

transparent or solid doors as 
‘‘equipment with hinged or sliding 
doors and a door angle greater than or 
equal to 45°.’’ 

DOE is considering 38 of the 48 

equipment classes shown in Table IV– 
4.10 The equipment classes are 
organized by equipment family, 
compressor operating mode, and rating 
temperature. The right-hand column in 
Table IV–4 with the heading 
‘‘Equipment Class Designation’’ 
identifies each of the 48 equipment 
classes with a particular set of letters. 
The first three letters for each class 
represent its equipment family. The 
next two letters represent the 
condensing unit configuration. The last 
letter represents the rating temperature. 
Table IV–1 through Table IV–3 set forth 
the meaning of the equipment class 
lettering designations.

provides the incremental costs of adding 
design options to a baseline model that 
will improve its efficiency; (2) the 
efficiency-level approach, which 
provides the relative costs of achieving 
increases in energy efficiency levels 
without regard to the particular design 
options used to achieve such increases; 
and (3) the cost-assessment (or reverse 
engineering) approach, which provides 
‘‘bottom-up’’ manufacturing cost 
assessments for achieving various levels 
of increased efficiency based on detailed 
cost data for parts and material, labor, 
shipping/packaging, and investment for 
models that operate at particular 
efficiency levels. 
1. Approach 

In the ANOPR engineering analysis, 

the primary methodology was an 
efficiency-level approach, 
supplemented by a design option 
approach. DOE analyzed only the 15 
equipment classes with shipment 
volumes greater than 100 per year. The 
basis of the approach was four industry- 
supplied cost-efficiency curves for the 
four equipment classes shipped most 
frequently (i.e., VCT.RC.L, VOP.RC.M, 
SVO.RC.M, and HZO.RC.L). See Section 
0 for shipment data. DOE developed 
these classes using an efficiency-level 
approach. DOE supplemented these 
industry-supplied curves with 15 curves 
it developed using a design option 
approach. Four of DOE’s curves were 
intended only for comparison with the 
industry-supplied curves, as verification 
of the industry data. The other 11 curves 
formed the basis of analysis for the other 
11 analyzed equipment classes. The 
ANOPR provides more details on this 
approach. 72 FR 41180. 

During the ANOPR public meeting 

and subsequent comment period, 
stakeholders raised concerns over using 
industry-supplied data as the basis of 
the engineering analysis. ARI stated that 
the intent was to use the industry curves 
only to validate DOE’s design option 
analysis, not to use them directly in the 
analysis. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 91) The American Council 
for an Energy Efficient Economy 
(ACEEE) stated that rulemakings have 
always used industry curves when they 
were available. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 91) ARI stated 
that the industry data represents an 
average and covers the range of 
available equipment, but not all 
manufacturers’ equipment would span 
the whole range. ARI also stated that as 
few as three manufacturers submitted 
data for some of the cost-efficiency 
curves, while in the best cases there 
were up to seven. ARI explained that 
three manufacturers might not represent 

the entire industry. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at pp. 94–95) 
Hussmann stated that it doesn’t know, 
for example, how many shelf lights 
other manufacturers included in the 
data they submitted to ARI, and therein 
lies some of the danger of using an 
industry average. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 95) Regarding 
the HZO.RC.L equipment class, EEI 
stated that DOE’s data does not appear 
to have the same range as ARI’s data. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 93) Copeland also questioned 
whether the cost-efficiency curves from 
industry made sense [because they did 
not appear to be ordered in terms of 
increasing payback]. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 149) ACEEE 
noted that the analytically derived price 
points for several equipment classes are 
significantly higher than the industry- 
supplied data at high efficiency, and 
suggested that DOE reexamine this data. 
(ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) ARI stated that 
DOE’s design option approach appears 
to be technically sound, and that the 
ARI cost-efficiency curves are only 
available for a limited number of 
equipment classes. For consistency, ARI 
recommended that DOE base its analysis 
solely on DOE’s analytically derived 
curves. (ARI, No. 18 at p. 6) 

As mentioned above, DOE used the 
four cost-efficiency curves 11 provided 
by ARI as the basis for its ANOPR 
engineering analysis. DOE was not 
aware of ARI’s intent that they be used 
only to validate DOE’s own analysis, or 
of ARI’s concerns that the data may 
have been insufficient for some classes. 
DOE agrees with stakeholders that using 
the analytically derived curves (a design 
option approach) for all equipment 
classes would be more consistent and 
provide more transparency. Although 
the efficiency-level and design option 
approaches have been used together in 
other rulemakings, DOE recognizes the 
challenges in using the industry- 
supplied data as the primary 
engineering analysis approach in this 
rulemaking. The ARI data cannot be 
disaggregated for public review, since 
doing so would disclose sensitive 
manufacturer information. This 
prevents a rigorous investigation of any 
discrepancies or irregularities in data 
submitted by the manufacturers. At the 
ANOPR public meeting, Hussmann 
mentioned lighting levels as one 
example of a design feature that could 
cause discrepancies among data from 

11 These four curves applied to the following four 

equipment classes: VCT.RC.L, VOP.RC.M, 
SVO.RC.M, and HZO.RC.L. These represent the 
equipment classes with the highest shipment 
volumes. 

different manufacturers. In the design 
option approach, data on design features 
that affect performance (such as 
lighting) are available for interested 
persons to review and comment on, 
along with other assumptions and 
calculations. The aggregation of 
industry data seems to have resulted in 
cost-efficiency curves that lack the 
marked cost increases at higher levels of 
efficiency that are typical of the cost- 
efficiency relationship. The industry- 
supplied curves tended to be ‘‘flatter’’ 
than those developed by DOE, and in 
some cases appear to have efficiency 
levels that were not in order of 
increasing payback, as noted by 
Copeland. DOE believes the flatness of 
the industry curves may account for 
some of the discrepancies in pricing 
between the industry-supplied and 
analytically derived data, as noted by 
ACEEE. 

The extent of the industry-supplied 
data was also cause for concern. ARI’s 
statement that not all manufacturers’ 
equipment would span the whole range 
of efficiency levels is consistent with 
EEI’s concern that the data derived 
using DOE’s design option approach did 
not span the same range as the industry 
data. Because of overlapping ranges of 
efficiency of manufacturers’ data, the 
overall cost-efficiency data reported by 
ARI spans a range that in some cases is 
greater than the range covered by DOE’s 
design option data. DOE realizes this 
could raise a concern that its analysis is 
incomplete, for example by neglecting 
design options that could account for 
additional increases in efficiency, and 
thus an increase in the span of 
efficiencies covered. However, based on 
the comments received, DOE believes 
the extra range in the ARI data is instead 
largely due to inconsistencies in the 
manufacturer data submitted to ARI, 
such as lighting levels. A smaller 
portion of the extra range may also be 
attributable to subtle aspects of design 
and manufacturing (e.g., airflow and air- 
curtain design) that have an 
insignificant impact on performance 
and that cannot be modeled accurately 
in the design option approach. DOE 
appreciates the feedback from ARI that 
the design option approach appears 
sound, and believes that the design 
option data is more accurate in 
depicting the cost-efficiency 
relationship for commercial 
refrigeration equipment. 

For the NOPR engineering analysis, 
DOE analyzed the same 15 equipment 
classes as in the ANOPR analysis, but 
used only a design option approach. 
That approach is identical to the one 
used in the ANOPR, involving 
consultation with outside experts,

review of publicly available cost and 
performance information, and modeling 
of equipment cost and energy 
consumption, but DOE applied it to all 
15 equipment classes analyzed. The 
industry-supplied data developed using 
an efficiency-level approach is used 
only as a check on DOE’s data. DOE 
believes this approach is more reliable, 
and affords the public full transparency 
of assumptions and results and the 
ability to perform independent analyses 

for verification. See Chapter 5 of the 
TSD for more detail. 
2. Equipment Classes Analyzed 

For the NOPR, DOE did not make any 

changes to the equipment classes 
directly analyzed in the ANOPR 
engineering analysis. Because of the 
large number of equipment classes in 
this rulemaking, DOE did not directly 
analyze all equipment classes using the 
design option approach. DOE 

maintained the same equipment class 
prioritization used in the ANOPR. 
Equipment classes with more than 100 
units shipped per year (‘‘primary’’ 
classes), as well as the VOP.RC.L 12 
equipment class, were directly 
analyzed. Table IV–6 lists these 
equipment classes, which represent 
approximately 98 percent of the 
shipments of commercial refrigeration 
equipment reported by ARI.

3. Analytical Models 

In the design option approach, DOE 

used models to develop estimates of 
cost and energy consumption for each 
equipment class at each efficiency level. 
DOE used a cost model to estimate the 
manufacturer production cost (MPC) in 
dollars, and an energy consumption 
model to estimate the daily energy 
consumption in kWh for each of the 15 
primary equipment classes analyzed. 
a. Cost Model 

Development of the cost model 
involved the disassembly of a self- 
contained refrigerator with transparent 
doors, an analysis of the materials and 
manufacturing processes, and the 
development of a parametric 
spreadsheet model flexible enough to 
cover all equipment classes. The 
manufacturing cost model estimated 
MPC and reported it in aggregated form 
to maintain confidentiality of sensitive 
cost data. DOE obtained input from 
stakeholders on the MPC estimates and 
assumptions to confirm accuracy. The 
cost model was used for 7 of the 15 
examined equipment classes and the 
results were extended to 6 of the 
remaining examined equipment classes. 

The cost of the remaining two 
equipment classes was estimated using 
available manufacturer list price (MLP) 
information discounted to MPC. Details 
of the cost model are provided in 
chapter 5 of the TSD. 

Following the ANOPR, no comments 

were received regarding DOE’s cost 
model, and therefore no significant 
changes were made to the methodology 
used in the NOPR analysis. One change 
was made to the manufacturer markup 
assumption, which is discussed below. 
One key element of DOE’s cost model 

concerned features and structural 
elements common in commercial 
refrigeration equipment, but that would 
not affect the energy use of the 
equipment. Development of this part of 
the cost model involved disassembling 
a self-contained refrigerator with 
transparent doors, analyzing the 
materials and manufacturing processes, 
and developing a parametric 
spreadsheet model flexible enough to 
cover all equipment classes. The other 
key part of the cost model estimated the 
costs of particular features or design 
options that would affect the energy use 
of the equipment. DOE obtained input 
from stakeholders on the MPC estimates 
and assumptions to confirm their 

12 The VOP.RC.L equipment class was reported as 

having zero shipments in the ARI shipment data, 
but was included in the analysis based on 
recommendations from manufacturers. During 

interviews conducted for the NOPR, manufacturers 
reported to DOE their individual shipment numbers 
for the VOP.RC.L class. Regardless of the actual 
shipment volume, DOE believes there are 

accuracy. DOE used the cost model for 
7 of the 15 examined equipment classes 
and extended the results to 6 of the 
remaining examined equipment classes. 
DOE estimated the cost of the remaining 
two equipment classes using available 
manufacturer list price (MLP) 
information reduced to MPC. Chapter 5 
of the TSD provides details of the cost 
model. 

A manufacturer markup is applied to 
the MPC estimates to arrive at the MSP. 
This is the price of equipment sold at 
which the manufacturer can recover 
both production and non-production 
costs and can earn a profit. DOE 
calculated the manufacturer markup as 
the market share weighted average value 
for the industry. For the ANOPR, DOE 
developed this manufacturer markup by 
examining several major commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers’ 
gross margin information from annual 
reports and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) 10–K reports. The 
manufacturers DOE analyzed account 
for approximately 80 percent of the 
market, and each company is a 
subsidiary of a more diversified parent 
company that manufactures equipment 
other than commercial refrigeration 
equipment. Because the 10–K reports do 

significantly more than 100 annual shipments of the 
VOP.RC.L equipment class.

the subsidiary level, the estimated 
markups represent the average markups 
that the parent company applies over its 
entire range of equipment offerings and 
does not necessarily represent the 
manufacturer markup of the subsidiary. 

The ANOPR analysis indicated that 

the average manufacturer markup is 
1.39. However, DOE adjusted the 
markups to be more representative of 
the industry following discussions with 
manufacturers during the MIA 
interviews (Chapter 13). An aggregation 
of the MIA interview responses gives a 
market share weighted average 
manufacturer markup value of 1.32. For 
the NOPR, DOE used this revised 
manufacturer markup with the MPC 
values from the engineering analysis to 
arrive at the MSP values used in the 
GRIM. 

As explained in the ANOPR, DOE 

received industry-supplied curves from 
ARI in the form of daily energy 
consumption versus MLP, both 
normalized by total display area (TDA). 
Since DOE developed its analytically 
derived curves in the form of calculated 
daily energy consumption (CDEC) 
versus MSP, it was necessary for DOE to 
estimate an industry list price markup 
so that it could make comparisons 
between the two sets of curves. The 
industry list price markup is a markup 
to the selling price that provides the list 
price. To make comparisons between 
the analytically derived and industry- 
supplied cost-efficiency curves, DOE 
discounted the industry data with the 
list price markup and normalized the 
analytically derived curves by TDA. 

Manufacturers typically offer a 

discount from the MLP, which depends 
on factors such as the relationship with 
the customer and the volume and type 
of equipment being purchased. For the 
estimate of list price markup, DOE 
relied on information gathered on self- 
contained commercial refrigeration 
equipment, since list price information 
is readily available and typically 
published by manufacturers of this 
equipment. A review of the data shows 
that the list price markup is typically 
2.0 (i.e., manufacturers will typically 
sell their equipment for 50 percent off 
the published list price). DOE further 
verified the estimate by obtaining list 
price quotes from several remote 
condensing equipment manufacturers. 
During manufacturer interviews, some 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers agreed with the 2.0 
markup estimate, while others stated the 
estimate was somewhat high. Although 
the list price markup can vary 
significantly by manufacturer and by 
customer, DOE believes the estimated

list price markup of 2.0 is representative 
of the industry. DOE applied this 
markup to all equipment classes. 

DOE did not receive any additional 

comments or information indicating that 
revision of the cost model used in the 
ANOPR analysis is warranted. Therefore 
DOE has adhered to that model in the 
NOPR analysis. 
b. Energy Consumption Model 

The energy consumption model 

estimates the daily energy consumption 
of commercial refrigeration equipment 
at various performance levels using a 
design options approach. The model is 
specific to the categories of equipment 
covered under this rulemaking, but is 
sufficiently generalized to model the 
energy consumption of all covered 
equipment classes. For a given 
equipment class, the model estimates 
the daily energy consumption for the 
baseline and the energy consumption of 
several levels of performance above the 
baseline. The model is used to calculate 
each performance level separately. 

In developing the energy 

consumption model, DOE made general 
assumptions about the analysis 
methodology and specific numerical 
assumptions regarding load components 
and design options. DOE based its 
energy consumption estimates on new 
equipment tested in a controlled- 
environment chamber in accordance 
with ANSI/ARI Standard 1200–2006, 
the DOE test procedure for commercial 
refrigeration equipment, which 
references the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 
72–2005 test method.13 Once Federal 
standards for this equipment become 
operative, manufacturers will be 
required to test units with this test 
method, which specifies a certain 
ambient temperature, humidity, light 
level, and other requirements. This test 
method, however, contains no 
specification as to the operating hours of 
the display case lighting, and DOE’s 
energy consumption model considers 
the operating hours to be 24 hours per 
day (i.e., that lights are on 
continuously). This assumption is 
consistent with the lighting operating 
time assumption used in the energy use 
characterization (see Section IV.D). 
Chapter 5 of the TSD discusses further 
the assumptions used in the energy 
consumption model. 

The energy consumption model 

calculates CDEC as having two major 
components: Compressor energy 
consumption and component energy 
consumption (expressed as kWh/day). 
Component energy consumption is the 

13 The test procedures are found at 10 CFR 

431.64. 

sum of the direct electrical energy 
consumption of fan motors, lighting, 
defrost and drain heaters, anti-sweat 
heaters, and pan heaters. Compressor 
energy consumption is calculated from 
the total refrigeration load (expressed in 
Btu/h) and one of two compressor 
models: One version for remote 
condensing equipment and one for self- 
contained equipment. The total 
refrigeration load is a sum of the 
component load and the non-electric 
load. The component load is the sum of 
the heat emitted by evaporator fan 
motors, lighting, defrost and drain 
heaters, and anti-sweat heaters inside 
and adjacent to the refrigerated space 
(condenser fan motors and pan heaters 
are outside of the refrigerated space and 
do not contribute to the component heat 
load). The non-electric load is the sum 
of the heat contributed by radiation 
through glass and openings, heat 
conducted through walls and doors, and 
sensible and latent loads from warm, 
moist air infiltration through openings. 
Chapter 5 of the TSD discusses 
component energy consumption, 
compressor energy consumption, and 
load models. 

DOE made one change to the 

methodology of calculating the radiation 
load for cases without doors (VOP, SVO, 
and HZO equipment families). In the 
ANOPR analysis, the view factor 14 from 
the interior of the case to the walls of 
the test chamber was estimated as 0.025. 
This value was kept as a constant for all 
cases and sizes in the ANOPR analysis, 
but it is clear this value should change 
somewhat as the geometry and the 
overall size of the case changes. For the 
NOPR, DOE calculated the view factor 
separately for each equipment class 
depending on the geometry specific to 
the baseline design specifications of that 
class. The view factor from the case to 
the room is calculated as the ratio of 
TDA (i.e., the area of the plane 
separating the case from the room) to 
the test chamber wall surface area. 

Stakeholders raised questions 

regarding DOE’s method of calculating 
the infiltration load 15 for commercial 
refrigeration equipment. Carrier asserted 
that DOE’s method of using defrost 
water to model infiltration has 
limitations. Carrier pointed out that as 
the case is run at higher suction 
temperatures, the coil has a tendency to 
run as a wet coil and does not retain 
much of the moisture on its exterior. 
Typically on manufacturer specification 
sheets, defrost meltwater is only the

water that comes out during a defrost 
period, and Carrier noted that there may 
be additional water that would come off 
the coil between defrost periods. Carrier 
believes DOE may be underestimating 
the infiltration load using information 
from the specification sheets, and 
estimated that the infiltration load is 
typically around 75 percent of total 
cooling water. Carrier questioned 
whether or not DOE compared its 
estimates with the calculated infiltration 
loads. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
13.5 at p. 83) Hussmann stated that 
when it publishes data for defrost 
meltwater, it does so for the sole 
purpose of sizing sewer lines and not for 
estimating the infiltration load. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 85) 

In the ANOPR analysis, DOE 

calculated infiltration load using 
empirical defrost meltwater data 
obtained from manufacturers’ detailed 
specification sheets. DOE assumed that 
defrost meltwater could be correlated 
with infiltration load, given certain 
known parameters such as ambient 
relative humidity. This methodology 
was calibrated with detailed 
refrigeration load data obtained from 
Southern California Edison for several 
large-volume equipment classes. DOE 
agrees with the assessment made by 
stakeholders and has altered its 
methodology accordingly. In the NOPR 
engineering design specifications, 
defrost meltwater (in pounds per hour, 
lbs/hr) is replaced with infiltrated air 
(also in lbs/hr) for all equipment classes. 
DOE estimated infiltrated air by using 
manufacturers’ detailed specification 
sheets, recognizing that infiltration load 
is the only load component that cannot 
be directly calculated. Using physical 
parameters about each case, the other 
load components (internal load, 
conduction load, radiation load) are 
calculated. DOE subtracted these load 
components from the listed total 
refrigeration load, and it is assumed that 
the remaining load is due to infiltration. 
Chapter 5 of the TSD provides more 
details of the change to this 
methodology. 

At the public meeting, stakeholders 

expressed concern over the refrigerants 
DOE used in the analysis. EEI asked if 
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants 
were already assumed to be in use in the 
baseline. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 97) ARI stated that most 
of the data it provided to DOE was 
based on such refrigerants and no 
changes are expected in that regard. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 97) In its analysis, DOE assumed that 
HFC refrigerants are already fully in use 
for commercial refrigeration equipment. 
For all remote condensing equipment, 

in accordance with the DOE test 
procedure in ANSI/ARI Standard 1200– 
2006, DOE assumes the use of a 
compressor using an HFC refrigerant 
(i.e., R–404A). Likewise, all of the 
compressors DOE used in modeling self- 
contained equipment use either R–404A 
or R–134A, another HFC refrigerant. 
c. Design Options 

In the market and technology 
assessment for the ANOPR, DOE 
defined an initial list of technologies 
that have the potential to reduce the 
energy consumption of commercial 
refrigeration equipment. In the 
screening analysis for the ANOPR, DOE 
screened out some of these technologies 
based on four screening criteria: 
Technological feasibility; practicability 
to manufacture, install and service; 
impacts on equipment utility or 
availability; and impacts on health or 
safety. 72 FR 41179–80. The remaining 
technologies became inputs to the 
ANOPR engineering analysis as design 
options. However, for reasons described 
in the ANOPR, DOE did not incorporate 
all of these technologies as design 
options in the energy consumption 
model. 72 FR 41182–83. Stakeholders 
commented that some of these 
technologies should be included in the 
NOPR engineering analysis, and 
recommended additional design options 
DOE should consider. Comments 
pertaining to each suggested technology 
and DOE’s response are provided below. 
As a general comment about design 
options, ACEEE stated that some design 
options that were screened out should 
be considered for further analysis and 
that prevalence in the marketplace is 
not necessarily a good reason to screen 
out a design option. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 62) DOE 
screened out five technologies in the 
ANOPR screening analysis. These are 
air-curtain design, thermoacoustic 
refrigeration, magnetic refrigeration, 
electro-hydrodynamic heat exchangers, 
and copper rotor motors. All five of 
these design options were screened out 
because they are in the research stage 
and would not be practical to 
manufacture, install, and service. Since 
the publication of the ANOPR, DOE is 
not aware of any significant changes to 
the status of these technologies, and has 
not included them in the NOPR 
analysis. 

ACEEE recommended that variable- 
speed compressors be included in the 
analysis. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) EEI 
also suggested that DOE consider the 
use of variable-speed drives for 
compressors. (EEI, No. 15 at p. 2) 
Variable-speed compressors could 
potentially improve the efficiency of 

commercial refrigeration equipment 
classes that are self-contained units 
without doors and self-contained ice- 
cream freezers. Variable-speed 
compressors can reduce energy 
consumption under real-world 
conditions by matching cooling capacity 
to the refrigeration load, which can 
change due to variations in ambient 
conditions and product loading. This 
load matching allows for a more 
constant temperature inside the case, 
eliminating the large fluctuations in 
temperature that are typical of single- 
speed compressors. The stability in 
temperature allows manufacturers to 
design equipment with higher 
evaporator temperatures, improving 
compressor efficiency. However, the 
energy-saving benefit of variable-speed 
compressors is not clear under ANSI/ 
ASHRAE Standard 72–2005, because it 
is a steady-state test for commercial 
refrigeration equipment. Further, DOE is 
not aware of any test data showing the 
energy savings benefit of variable speed 
compressors in the types of equipment 
covered in this rule. Certain test data 
does exist for walk-ins and residential 
refrigerators, but DOE does not believe 
that this data can be used to predict the 
performance of variable-speed 
compressors in commercial refrigeration 
equipment. Therefore, DOE did not 
include variable-speed compressors as a 
design option in its engineering 
analysis. 

ACEEE recommended that variable- 

speed evaporator fans be included in the 
analysis. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) San 
Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDGE) 
also recommended that DOE include in 
its analysis the energy savings, cost- 
effectiveness, and feasibility of such 
fans for enclosed refrigeration 
equipment served by remote 
refrigeration compressors. (SDGE, No. 
22 at p. 2) SCE recommended that DOE 
consider the cost-effectiveness of 
variable-speed evaporator fans for this 
equipment. SCE asserted that variable- 
speed fan control was a very effective 
and cost-effective means of increasing 
refrigerated warehouse efficiency and 
should be applicable to commercial 
refrigeration equipment as well. SCE 
stated that this reduces the energy 
consumption of the fan and the amount 
of load that the refrigerant must reject. 
SCE also noted that its work in support 
of California building and appliance 
standards showed variable-speed 
controls on evaporator fans had 
approximately one-year simple 
paybacks in both refrigerated 
warehouses and small walk-in coolers.

p. 69 and SCE, No. 19 at p. 3) EEI also

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

suggested that DOE consider the use of 
variable-speed drives for evaporator fans 
and compressors. (EEI, No. 15 at p. 2) 
Variable-speed evaporator fans can 
operate at speeds that match changing 
conditions in the case. DOE recognizes 
that the use of these fans provides some 
opportunity for energy savings, because 
the buildup and removal of frost creates 
differing pressure drops across the 
evaporator coil. Theoretically, less fan 
power is required when the coil is free 
of frost. Additionally, when an 
evaporator fan operates at variable 
speeds, the coil would operate at a more 
stable temperature during the period of 
frost build-up. However, the 
effectiveness of the air curtain in 
equipment without doors is very 
sensitive to changes in airflow, so fan 
motor controllers would likely disrupt 
air curtains. DOE believes the likely 
disturbance to the air curtain, which 
would lead to higher infiltration loads 
and higher overall energy consumption, 
would negate the use of evaporator fan 
motor controllers in equipment without 
doors, even if there were some 
reduction in fan energy use. In addition, 
the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 
test method is a steady-state test for 
commercial refrigeration equipment, so 
similar to variable-speed compressors, 
the energy-saving benefit of variable- 
speed fans is not clear. Therefore, DOE 
did not include variable-speed fans as a 
design option in its engineering 
analysis. 

ACEEE recommended that remote 

ballast location be included in the 
analysis. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) 
Fluorescent lamp ballasts generate heat, 
and their relocation outside the 
refrigerated space can reduce energy 
consumption by lessening the 
refrigeration load on the compressor. 
However, for the majority of commercial 
refrigeration equipment currently 
manufactured, ballasts are already 
located in electrical trays outside of the 
refrigerated space, in either the base or 
top of the equipment. The notable 
exceptions are the equipment classes in 
the VCT equipment family, where 
ballasts are most often located on the 
interior of each door mullion. Most 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers purchase doors for VCT 
units that are preassembled with the 
entire lighting system in place rather 
than configured for separate ballasts. 
DOE believes that most commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
choose these kinds of doors because it 
would be labor intensive and time 
consuming to relocate these ballasts at 
the factory, and because of the 
additional cost and labor of wiring 
separate ballasts. Manufacturers have 

indicated that the potential energy 
savings are also small, since modern 
electronic ballasts are very efficient and 
typically contribute only a few watts 
(W) each to the refrigeration load. 
Because (1) lamp ballasts are already 
located externally on most equipment; 
(2) most units that have internally 
located lamp ballasts use preassembled 
lighting systems; and (3) potential 
energy savings are small, DOE did not 
consider remote relocation of ballasts as 
a design option in its engineering 
analysis. 

ACEEE recommended that improved 
insulation be included in the analysis. 
(ACEEE, No. 15 at p. 2) Potential 
improvements to insulation material 
used in commercial refrigeration 
equipment cabinets include better 
polyurethane foams and vacuum panels. 
In consultation with insulation material 
manufacturers, DOE determined that 
there are no significant differences in 
‘‘grades’’ of insulation material, so 
equipment manufacturers are already 
using the best commercially available 
foam materials in their equipment. 
Vacuum panels are an alternative form 
of insulation; however, they may 
degrade in performance in time as small 
leaks develop. Based on knowledge of 
typical manufacturing practices, DOE 
also believes it would be impractical to 
use vacuum panels to construct 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
because they cannot be penetrated by 
fasteners, and do not provide the 
rigidity of ‘‘foamed-in-place’’ 
polyurethane insulation panels. Thicker 
insulation is another possible option, 
but could be problematic because it 
would likely result in either a reduced 
volume for the refrigerated space or an 
increase in the overall size of the 
equipment cabinet. Reducing the 
volume of the refrigerated space could 
affect the utility of the equipment, and 
because the outer dimensions of 
commercial refrigeration equipment are 
often limited (e.g., by interior 
dimensions of shipping containers), it is 
often not practical to increase the 
overall size of the cabinet. For all these 
reasons, DOE did not consider 
insulation thickness increases or 
improvements as a design option in its 
ANOPR engineering analysis. 

However, DOE did add increases in 
insulation thickness as a design option 
in the NOPR engineering analysis, 
because it now believes this is a cost- 
effective option in several equipment 
types, most notably self-contained ice- 
cream freezers with doors. DOE 
understands that in equipment classes 
where conduction makes up a 
significant portion of the total 
refrigeration load, a modest increase in

insulation thickness can lead to small, 
but significant energy savings. In 
relatively large units, which make up 
the largest portion of the shipments of 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
even if such added insulation results in 
reduction of the refrigerated volume, 
any such reduction would not be 
substantial. DOE does not foresee any 
impact on the availability of this type of 
equipment from the use of increased 
insulation that would trigger EPCA’s 
prohibition at 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(4) and 
6316(e)(1). As to smaller units, DOE 
assumes that their outer dimensions are 
less constrained than the dimensions of 
larger units, and that therefore 
manufacturers could accommodate a 
small increase in insulation thickness, 
and maintain the amount of refrigerated 
volume, by making a small increase in 
the overall size of the cabinet. 
Therefore, in the NOPR, DOE modeled 
a 1⁄2-inch increase in insulation 
thickness for all equipment classes. 
When implemented as a design option, 
this increase in thickness was added to 
the baseline value of insulation 
thickness and DOE recalculated the 
conduction load. DOE based the cost of 
increasing the insulation thickness on a 
sunk cost per unit, considering foam 
fixture engineering and tooling costs, 
production line lifetime, and number of 
fixtures and units produced. Chapter 5 
of the TSD provides details of the 
assumptions DOE used to calculate the 
additional cost of insulation thickness 
increases. 

ACEEE recommended that DOE 
include defrost cycle control in the 
analysis. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) Defrost 
cycle control can reduce energy 
consumption by reducing the frequency 
and duration of defrost periods. The 
majority of equipment currently 
manufactured already uses partial 
defrost cycle control in the form of cycle 
termination control. However, defrost 
cycle initiation is still scheduled at 
regular intervals. Full defrost cycle 
control would involve detecting frost 
buildup and initiating defrost. As 
described in the market and technology 
assessment (Chapter 3 of the TSD), this 
could be accomplished through an 
optical sensor or by sensing the 
temperature differential across the 
evaporator coil. However, both methods 
are unreliable due to problems with 
fouling of the coil from dust and other 
surface contaminants. This becomes 
more of an issue as the display case 
ages. Because of these issues, DOE did 
not consider defrost cycle control as a 
design option in its engineering 
analysis.

units, and that open units without doors 
should be held to energy consumption 
standards at levels warranted for units 
with doors. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 44) SCE advocates, in 
essence, that manufacture of new, open 
commercial refrigeration equipment be 
discontinued and replaced by 
manufacture of equipment with doors. It 
stated that this would be a cost-effective 
way of saving substantial amounts of 
energy. (SCE, No. 19 at p. 2) Although 
SCE did not state it explicitly, DOE 
understands that its main argument for 
advocating that doors be considered for 
open cases is that doors should be 
regarded as a design option and not a 
feature, such that there are not separate 
equipment classes for equipment with 
and without doors. 

DOE acknowledges SCE’s position. 

Substantial, cost-effective energy 
savings might well result from standards 
that would, in effect, require the 
manufacture of commercial refrigeration 
equipment with doors instead of 
without. DOE has not considered such 
standards in this proceeding, however, 
nor has it studied their potential energy 
savings or economic justification 
(including the extent of their impact on 
product utility), because it believes 
EPCA precludes their adoption. First, 
DOE believes that, for commercial 
refrigeration equipment, the existence or 
lack of doors (i.e., whether the case is 
open or closed) does affect the utility of 
the equipment to its owner and user, 
and therefore is a ‘‘feature’’ as that term 
is used in 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(4) and 
6316(e)(1). Because a standard based on 
combining open and closed equipment 
classes would result in the 
unavailability of open cases, as 
described above, such a standard would 
violate EPCA’s prohibition against any 
standard that would ‘‘result in the 
unavailability’’ of equipment with 
‘‘features * * * that are substantially 
the same’’ as those currently available in 
the United States. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(4) 
and 6316(e)(1)) Second, EPCA 
prescribes energy conservation 
standards for self-contained equipment 
with doors, and mandates that DOE 
issue standard levels for ‘‘self-contained 
commercial refrigerators, freezers, and 
refrigerator-freezers without doors.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6313(c)(2)–(4)) The latter 
equipment is one of the subjects of this 
rulemaking. Hence, the plain language 
of EPCA covers standards for 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
with and without doors. DOE must 
follow this legislative mandate. For 
these reasons, DOE did not consider 
doors as a design option for open 
equipment in its engineering analysis.

The design options DOE considered in 
the NOPR engineering analysis are: 
• Higher efficiency lighting and 

ballasts for the VOP, SVO, HZO, and 
SOC equipment families (horizontal 
fixtures); 

• Higher efficiency lighting and 

motors; 

ballasts for the VCT equipment family 
(vertical fixtures); 
• Higher efficiency evaporator fan 
• Increased evaporator surface area; 
• Increased insulation thickness; 
• Improved doors for the VCT 
• Improved doors for the VCT 
• Improved doors for the HCT 

equipment family, low temperature; 

equipment family, medium temperature; 

equipment family, ice-cream 
temperature; 

equipment family, medium temperature; 

• Improved doors for the SOC 
• Higher efficiency condenser fan 
motors (for self-contained equipment 
only); 
• Increased condenser surface area 
(for self-contained equipment only); and 
• Higher efficiency compressors (for 

self-contained equipment only).16 

At the public meeting and during the 

comment period, stakeholders raised 
concerns about some of the design 
option data DOE used in its analysis and 
about DOE’s depiction of some of the 
design options. Several stakeholders 
were concerned with the lighting design 
option data. Zero Zone stated that DOE’s 
estimate of the incremental increase in 
cost for light emitting diode (LED) 
lighting was too low. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 89) ARI 
seemed to agree with Zero Zone’s 
assessment, stating that DOE appears to 
have significantly underestimated the 
incremental cost for LED lighting by 
about 50 percent. 

DOE revised its cost assumption for 

LED lighting used in the VOP, SVO, 
HZO, and SOC equipment families 
(horizontal four-foot fixtures) and the 
VCT equipment family (vertical 5-foot 
fixtures). For the ANOPR, DOE based 
LED lighting costs on an LED retrofit 
case study, but DOE revised some of its 
assumptions for the NOPR based on 
conversations with manufacturers of 
LED chips and LED fixtures. 
Specifically, DOE revised its 
assumptions on the relative weight of 
the costs of LED chips, power supplies, 
and the balance of fixtures (which 
includes labor). These changes cause the 
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
cost (i.e., the cost to commercial

the test procedure and standard apply only to the 
cabinet and not the condensing unit. 

refrigeration equipment manufacturers) 
of LED fixtures to increase for both 
horizontal and vertical fixtures. DOE 
believes the cost estimates for LED 
fixtures are now more accurate and are 
consistent with the costs commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
would experience in today’s market at 
mass-production volumes. Further 
discussion of the assumptions used to 
calculate LED fixture costs are provided 
in Chapter 5 of the TSD. 

Although DOE found that current LED 

costs are higher than originally 
estimated in the ANOPR analysis, 
through a closer examination of cost 
data for currently available LEDs, DOE 
recognizes that LED technology has 
historically exceeded DOE’s efficiency 
and cost targets. In this NOPR, DOE 
conducted a sensitivity study that 
analyzed future LED costs based on 
DOE’s Multi-Year Program Plan,17 
which are consistent with historical 
LED price reductions between 2000 and 
2007 (see Appendix B of the TSD). The 
Multi-Year Program Plan projects that 
LED chip costs will continue to decrease 
at a compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR) of approximately ¥27 percent 
between 2007 and 2012, which 
represents a price reduction of 80 
percent over that time period. Also in 
agreement, EIA’s NEMS uses a 
technology characterization for LED 
light sources, which show that LED chip 
costs are expected to decline by 
approximately 71 percent for the same 
time period. Since LED chips are only 
a portion of the total LED system (other 
components include power supply and 
the LED fixture), the 80 percent 
reduction in chip costs contributes to an 
estimated decrease in total LED system 
cost of approximately 50 percent by 
2012, assuming the costs of the power 
supply and LED fixtures do not change 
significantly. 

DOE examined whether the projected 

LED costs presented in the Multi-Year 
Program Plan and used in this NOPR are 
consistent with publicly available 
empirical historical cost data. DOE 
reviewed available price data for the 
LED market and found that between 
2000 and 2007, white-light LEDs had a 
CAGR ranging from approximately ¥18 
to ¥31 percent. DOE’s LED cost 
projection (i.e., ¥27 percent CAGR) 
falls within the range of CAGRs 
observed.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

DOE expanded its examination by 
comparing this projected trend to the 
red-light LED market, which is a related 
technology, with price information 
spanning approximately three decades 
(i.e., 1973 to 2005). DOE found that the 
CAGR of red-light LED costs was ¥22 
percent over this longer time span. The 
trend in red-light LED costs derived 
from empirical data over this longer 
time period is of a similar magnitude to 
DOE’s projected costs for white-light 
LEDs. Due to the technological 
similarities between red-light LEDs and 
white-light LEDs, DOE believes that the 
historical cost reductions for red-light 
LEDs are indicative of future cost 
reductions for white-light LEDs. 
Furthermore, the white-light LED 
market is undergoing a massive 
expansion and growth phase, with 
significant investment, new products 
and innovative applications for LED 
technology, including illumination of 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
See Section V.C of this NOPR and 
Appendix B of the TSD for more detail 
on the cost projection and DOE’s 
validation of those estimates. DOE seeks 
comment on the extent to which these 
price trends are indicative of what can 
be expected for commercial refrigeration 
equipment LED lighting from 2007 to 
2012 and the extent to which the cost 
reduction observed for red-light LEDs is 
relevant to DOE’s cost projections for 
white-light LEDs. Also, in order to 
consider that LED costs are to decline 
more than assumed in this analysis, 
DOE will need more information than 
currently available on the extent, 
timing, and certainty of such further 
price reductions. Finally, DOE seeks 
comment on the extent to which 
manufacturers would adopt LED 
technology into the design of 
commercial refrigeration equipment in 
the absence of standards considering the 
rapid development of LED technology 
and the steady reductions in cost. See 
Section VII.E.1 for details. 

The design option data for doors on 
VCT equipment were another area of 
concern for stakeholders. Zero Zone 
stated that the incremental increase in 
cost for high-efficiency doors 
(particularly cooler doors) seemed too 
high. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
13.5 at p. 89) ACEEE also indicated that 
DOE’s costs for high-efficiency doors are 
too high. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) ARI 
stated that it does not believe that the 
door used in DOE’s analysis (one that 
uses no energy) is available in the 
market today. According to ARI, high- 
efficiency door models currently in the 
market have no heat in the door, but the 
frame installed in the case uses at least

options, Emerson noted that possible 
efficiency improvements for 
compressors in self-contained units may 
be too optimistic. True believes that 
because the test procedure is not steady- 
state (due to door openings), variable- 
speed compressors may be an effective 
design option. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 75) However, 
True also noted that few variable-speed 
compressors are available in the 
appropriate power range, but that their

40 W per door. ARI also stated that this 
option is not available to manufacturers 
in all applications because it is not 
intended for stores that operate outside 
a condition of 75 °F dry bulb and 55 
percent relative humidity, which 
requires higher wattage anti-condensate 
heaters in the doors/frames. (ARI, No. 
18 at p. 6) Zero Zone made similar 
comments, stating that building 
humidity could be an issue in the use 
and functionality of higher efficiency 
doors without heaters. Zero Zone also 
recommended that DOE revise its 
analysis and use 40 W per door for the 
high-efficiency medium temperature 
frame, and that high-efficiency doors 
should be dropped from the analysis 
because they can result in condensate 
and water on the floor, such that they 
are not safe to use in a number of stores. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 119 and Zero Zone, No. 17 at p. 2) 

DOE did not revise its costs for doors 
on VCT equipment. After reviewing the 
information collected for the ANOPR 
analysis, DOE concluded that its 
preliminary cost estimates were 
reasonable. Notwithstanding the 
stakeholder observations just set forth, 
none of them provided any specific 
additional data that would warrant 
revision of DOE’s cost assessments, and 
DOE is not aware of such data. 
However, DOE revised the values for the 
anti-sweat heater power for glass doors 
for VCT.RC.L and VCT.RC.I equipment 
in the NOPR engineering analysis. 
Based on discussion with manufacturers 
and data from manufacturer 
specification sheets, the anti-sweat 
heater power for both the baseline and 
high-efficiency doors was increased 
(from 160 W to 200 W for baseline doors 
and from 60 W to 110 W for high- 
efficiency doors). DOE also revised the 
anti-sweat heater power for glass doors 
for VCT.RC.M equipment in the NOPR 
engineering analysis based on 
comments and data received from 
manufacturer specification sheets. DOE 
increased the anti-sweat heater power 
for both the baseline doors (from 60 W 
to 100 W) and high-efficiency doors 
(from 0 W to 50 W). See Chapter 5 of 
the TSD for more detail. 

Regarding the compressor design 

development is continuing. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 76) 
Emerson also believes that high- 
efficiency compressors may not be 
readily available and that it may be 
particularly hard to find compressors 
capable of this level of increased 
efficiency for low temperature 
equipment. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 65) For the NOPR, DOE 
revised the assumptions it used to 
estimate the changes in cost and 
efficiency for high-efficiency, single- 
speed compressors. Based on 
discussions with manufacturers and 
other experts, DOE concluded that the 
assumptions used in the ANOPR 
analysis (a 10 percent increase in cost 
results in a 20 percent reduction in 
energy use) overstated the actual 
efficiency gains that are possible for 
today’s compressors. Therefore, DOE 
now assumes that a five percent 
increase in cost would result in a 10 
percent reduction in compressor energy 
use. Per-dollar efficiency gains are 
equivalent with these new assumptions, 
but the overall magnitude of power 
reduction and the cost premium are 
reduced. This change affects only the 
self-contained equipment classes 
analyzed in the engineering analysis. 
Additionally, in the NOPR analysis, 

DOE revised the capacity values used to 
select self-contained compressors in the 
energy consumption model. DOE’s 
energy consumption model selects the 
most appropriate compressor by 
comparing each compressor’s capacity 
to the total refrigeration load in the case 
multiplied by the compressor oversize 
factor. Because compressor capacity is 
dependent on the conditions the 
compressor is tested at (compressor 
manufacturers provide capacity data 
over a range of conditions), it is 
important to select the compressor 
capacity based on the same conditions 
used to calculate total refrigeration load. 
For the ANOPR analysis, DOE listed 
capacity at standard ASHRAE rating 
conditions. However, the standard 
rating conditions used in the ASHRAE 
540–2004 standard differ from the 
operating conditions used in the model, 
and each set of conditions results in 
different capacity values.18 Because the 
standard conditions and modeled 

18 ASHRAE Standard 540–2004 lists standard 

rating conditions for hermetic refrigeration 
compressors. For medium-temperature equipment, 
compressors are rated at 20 °F suction dewpoint, 
120 °F discharge dewpoint, 40 °F return gas, and 
0 °F subcooling. For low-temperature equipment, 
compressors are rated at ¥10 °F suction dewpoint, 
120 °F discharge dewpoint, 40 °F return gas, and 
0 °F subcooling. For ice-cream-temperature 
equipment, compressors are rated at ¥25 °F suction 
dewpoint, 105 °F discharge dewpoint, 40 °F return 
gas, and 0 °F subcooling. 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules

conditions differed, the model typically 
overestimated the capacity of the 
selected compressors. To compensate, 
DOE adjusted the compressor oversize 
factor to an unrealistic level (typically 1) 
in order for the ANOPR model to select 
the correct compressor. For the NOPR, 
DOE used capacities based on the same 
conditions used to calculate total 
refrigeration load and revised the 
oversize factor (typically 1.4 in the 
NOPR model) for all self-contained 
equipment classes to maintain the 
selection of the correct compressor size. 
See Chapter 5 of the TSD for more 
detail. 

In the analysis for the ANOPR, the 

calculation of LED energy use assumed 
that the LED lighting fixtures at the ends 
of VCT cases were identical to those 
between doors. With fluorescent 
fixtures, manufacturers install the same 
lamp regardless of whether it is at the 
end of the case (attached to an end 
mullion) or between doors (attached to 
an interior mullion). This causes excess 
light at the ends of the case. The light 
output of a single lamp between two 
doors is directed in both directions (i.e., 
behind two doors), whereas lamps at the 
ends direct light only on the contents 
behind the end door. LED fixtures are 
inherently scalable, so manufacturers 
can install an LED fixture in the end 
mullion that uses fewer LEDs than 
fixtures in interior mullions. In the 
NOPR analysis, the calculation assumes 
single-row LED fixtures are used in the 
end mullions and that these fixtures use 
roughly 75 percent of the energy of 
double-row fixtures in interior mullions. 
See Chapter 5 of the TSD for more 
detail. 
4. Baseline Models 

As mentioned above, the engineering 
analysis estimates the incremental costs 
for equipment with efficiency levels 
above the baseline in each equipment 
class. DOE was not able to identify a 
voluntary or industry standard that 
provided a minimum baseline efficiency 
requirement for commercial 
refrigeration equipment. Therefore, it 
was necessary for DOE to determine 
baseline specifications for each 
equipment class to define the energy 
consumption and cost of the typical, 
baseline equipment. These 
specifications include dimensions, 
number of components, temperatures, 
nominal power ratings, and other case 
features that affect energy consumption, 
as well as a basic case cost (the cost of 
a piece of equipment not including the 
major efficiency-related components 
such as lights, fan motors, and 
evaporator coils).

DOE established baseline 

specifications for each equipment class 
modeled in the engineering analysis by 
reviewing available manufacturer data, 
selecting several representative units 
from available manufacturer data, and 
then aggregating the physical 
characteristics of the selected units. 
This process created a unit 
representative of commercial 
refrigeration equipment currently being 
offered for sale in each equipment class, 
with average characteristics for physical 
parameters (e.g., volume, TDA), and 
minimum performance of energy- 
consuming components (e.g., fans, 
lighting). DOE used the cost model to 
develop the basic case cost for each 
equipment class. See Appendix B of the 
TSD for these specifications. 

Zero Zone expressed concern over 

DOE’s method for calculating the 
internal case volume. Zero Zone 
suggested that DOE update its analysis 
to use ARI Standard 1200 for calculating 
the internal volume of a case. This 
standard calculates internal volume 
using the internal height and depth of 
the case from the inside of the door to 
the rear wall or rear duct. This is 
typically how the industry calculates 
internal volume. (Zero Zone, No. 17 at 
p. 1) 

In its engineering analysis, DOE 

followed the methodology in ANSI/ARI 
Standard 1200–2006 when calculating 
the refrigerated volume parameter used 
in the baseline design specifications. 
DOE used the internal height and depth 
of the case from inside of the door to the 
rear wall. No subtractions were made for 
shelving or other protrusions within the 
case interior envelope. 

At the public meeting, Zero Zone 
expressed concern over the lighting 
technology for the baseline models in 
each equipment class. Zero Zone stated 
that T12 lighting is no longer used in 
closed cases, and that T8 lighting is now 
the baseline for those cases. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 88) 
Further, Zero Zone reiterated in writing 
that the baseline lighting for cases with 
a vertical transparent door should be T8. 
(Zero Zone, No. 17 at p. 3) DOE has 
changed the baseline specifications and 
is now using T8 lighting in the analysis 
of baseline models. 

Stakeholders raised concerns over the 

accuracy of some of the data used for 
the baseline models. Zero Zone stated 
that the TDA for VCT.RC.L and 
VCT.RC.M cases may be incorrect, and 
that the sum of the TDA for each door 
did not equal the TDA of the entire case 
for these two equipment classes. (Zero 
Zone, No. 17 at p. 3) 

In the NOPR analysis, DOE made 

several revisions to the baseline 

specifications. Appendix B of the TSD 
shows changes to baseline design 
specifications relative to the ANOPR 
analysis. DOE revised the TDA for 
VCT.RC.L and VCT.RC.M equipment so 
that the sum of the display area of the 
doors matches the TDA of the case. The 
baseline models used in the NOPR 
analysis are more representative of 
actual equipment than those DOE used 
in the ANOPR analysis, but in some 
situations, the changes to baseline 
characteristics affected the baseline 
energy consumption significantly 
compared to the ANOPR. Four 
equipment classes (HZO.RC.M, 
HZO.SC.M, HZO.SC.L, and VCS.SC.I) 
had changes that resulted in a 
significant increase in the baseline 
energy consumption, and one 
equipment class (SOC.RC.M) had 
changes that resulted in a decrease in 
the baseline energy consumption. See 
Appendix B of the TSD for more detail. 

For the ANOPR analysis, DOE 

calculated a baseline energy usage of 
0.16 kWh/ft2 for the HZO.RC.M 
equipment class. During manufacturer 
interviews, some manufacturers stated 
that this seemed unreasonably low. DOE 
reviewed the data it presented in the 
ANOPR TSD, as to the energy 
consumption of equipment on the 
market and realized that its figure for 
baseline energy usage for HZO.RC.M 
cases was well below the amounts 
indicated by the market data. DOE 
identified problems with the ANOPR 
design specifications for the HZO.RC.M 
equipment class, namely a lack of 
electric defrost and a mismatch between 
the size of the case (TDA) and the 
amount of infiltration load. For the 
NOPR analysis, DOE revised its baseline 
design specifications for this equipment 
to include electric defrost based on 
discussions with manufacturers during 
the MIA interviews and a review of 
market data. Although electric defrost is 
not always required on HZO.RC.M 
cases, about two-thirds of such 
equipment on the market use electric 
defrost. Based on manufacturer 
interviews, DOE understands there are 
lower infiltration loads (on a per-TDA 
basis) in horizontal open cases because 
of the natural ‘‘well’’ of cold air that 
tends to sit inside the case. In contrast, 
for a vertical or semivertical open case, 
the cold air tends to spill out of the 
opening under the influence of gravity. 
With a lower infiltration load for a given 
TDA, there is less heat available to melt 
frost from the evaporator coil using off- 
cycle defrost. Thus, most HZO.RC.M 
case designs necessitate the use of 
electric resistance heating for defrost. 
DOE also revised the specifications for

the HZO.RC.M equipment class to 
include a higher infiltration load (in 
accordance with the updated infiltration 
methodology), and updated dimensions. 
In the ANOPR analysis, DOE used 
defrost meltwater to estimate the 
infiltration load. In accordance with the 
updated infiltration methodology, DOE 
used refrigeration load data to calculate 
the baseline infiltration load, which was 
higher than the load estimated using 
meltwater data in the ANOPR analysis 
(Chapter 5 for details). DOE also revised 
the dimensions of the HZO.RC.M class 
to reflect a somewhat smaller case size 
that was more representative of cases 
currently on the market. This change 
involved reducing the TDA, volume, 
wall area, and case interior surface area, 
all of which DOE matched to the 
infiltration load and other case 
components. See Appendix B of the 
TSD for more detail. 

For the HZO.SC.M and HZO.SC.L 

equipment classes, DOE made changes 
similar to those described in the 
preceding paragraph. These two 
equipment classes are in the same 
equipment family as the HZO.RC.M 
equipment class, so they share 
similarities to that class (e.g., having the 
same cabinet). Because of a lack of 
detailed data for the HZO.SC.M and 

HZO.SC.L equipment classes, DOE 
based its baseline specifications on the 
HZO.RC.M equipment class, making 
reasonable adjustments for design 
features specific to self-contained 
equipment. In particular, self-contained 
equipment has a lower compressor 
energy efficiency ratio (EER), and an 
added drain pan heater to evaporate 
defrost meltwater. Similar to the 
HZO.RC.M class, the change in 
infiltration load calculation led to a 
higher infiltration load for the 
HZO.SC.M class. DOE also added 
electric defrost to the HZO.SC.M class 
and increased the anti-sweat heater 
load. For the HZO.SC.L class, electric 
defrost was already included, since it is 
necessary for low-temperature 
equipment. However, DOE revised the 
infiltration load in accordance with the 
change in methodology and increased 
the anti-sweat heater load. See 
Appendix B of the TSD for more detail. 
Discussions during the manufacturer 
interviews revealed that in the ANOPR 
analysis, the baseline energy usage for 
the VCS.SC.I equipment class was 
unrealistically low. Therefore, in the 
NOPR analysis, DOE made revisions 
that increased energy usage in the 
baseline equipment for this class. DOE 
was unable to verify the accuracy of the 

baseline specifications in the ANOPR 
analysis, because of a lack of publicly 
available performance data for this 
class. For the NOPR, DOE revised its 
baseline assumptions to reflect a two- 
door case instead of the three-door 
model analyzed in the ANOPR. DOE 
believes this change more accurately 
reflects the current market for VCS.SC.I 
cases and is more in line with the 
electric defrost power level. DOE 
increased infiltration load somewhat 
relative to the ANOPR specifications 
and added anti-sweat power. See 
Appendix B of the TSD for more detail. 
5. Engineering Analysis Results 

The results of the engineering analysis 

are reported as cost-efficiency data (or 
‘‘curves’’) in the form of CDEC (in kWh) 
versus MSP (in dollars), both 
normalized by TDA (or volume for the 
VCS.SC.I equipment class). DOE created 
15 cost-efficiency curves in the 
engineering analysis. 

Table IV–7 presents data for these 
curves. See Chapter 5 of the TSD for 
additional detail on the engineering 
analysis and comparisons of DOE’s 
analytically derived curves to industry- 
supplied curves. See Appendix B of the 
TSD for complete cost-efficiency results.

C. Markups to Determine Equipment 
Price 

This section explains how DOE 

developed the distribution channel 
markups it used (Chapter 6 of the TSD). 

DOE used these markups, along with 
sales taxes, installation costs, and the 
MSPs developed in the engineering 
analysis, to arrive at the final installed 
equipment prices for baseline and 
higher efficiency commercial 
refrigeration equipment. As explained 

in the ANOPR, 72 FR 41184, and as 
shown in Table IV–8, DOE defined three 
distribution channels for commercial 
refrigeration equipment to describe how 
the equipment passes from the 
manufacturer to the customer.

For the ANOPR analysis, DOE 
estimated shares of 86 percent, 7 
percent, and 7 percent for the 
manufacturer, manufacturer/wholesaler, 
and manufacturer/wholesaler/contractor 
channels, respectively, for all 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
based on market estimates from 
consultants. At the ANOPR public 
meeting, ARI and Carrier commented 
that the breakdown should be changed 
to 70 percent, 15 percent, and 15 

percent among the three channels, 
respectively, for remote condensing 
equipment and 30 percent, 35 percent, 
and 35 percent, respectively, for self- 
contained equipment. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 122; ARI, No. 
18 at p. 7) No other alternative estimates 
were provided of shipments through 
these distribution channels. Therefore, 
in the NOPR, DOE decided to modify 
the breakdown and it recalculated the 
overall markups using the same 

procedure described in the ANOPR (72 
FR 41184), but based upon the industry 
comments from ARI and Carrier. The 
new overall baseline and incremental 
markups for sales to supermarkets 
within each distribution channel are 
shown in Table IV–9, Table IV–10, 
Table IV–11, and Table IV–12, 
respectively. Chapter 6 of the TSD 
provides additional details on markups.

D. Energy Use Characterization 

The energy use characterization 

estimates the annual energy 
consumption of commercial 
refrigeration equipment systems 
(including the remote condensing 
units). This estimate is used in the 
subsequent LCC and PBP analyses 
(Chapter 8 of the TSD) and NIA (Chapter 
11 of the TSD). DOE estimated the 
energy consumption of the 15 
equipment classes analyzed in the 
engineering analysis (Chapter 5 of the 
TSD) using the relevant test procedure. 
DOE then validated these energy 
consumption estimates with annual 
whole-building simulation modeling of 
selected equipment classes and 
efficiency levels. One of the key 
assumptions in both the engineering 
analysis and the whole-building 
simulation in the ANOPR analysis was 
that the display case lighting operated 
24 hours per day. DOE conducted a 
limited sensitivity analysis to explore 
how variation in display case lighting 
operating hours affected the energy 
savings. The sensitivity analysis showed 
that energy savings fell as lighting 
operating hours were reduced for all 
equipment classes that used display 
case lighting. The magnitude of this 
effect depended on the equipment class. 

At the ANOPR public meeting, SCE 

stated that it was studying display case 
lighting and will gladly share results of 
the study with DOE as soon as the study 
is done. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
13.5 at p. 117) Hussman stated that with 
today’s low-temperature cabinets, store 
owners won’t turn those lights off 
because they may not come back on 
when they are so cold. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 118) Hill 
Phoenix stated that turning off 
fluorescent lights at night can lead to 
maintenance issues because of moisture 
infiltration, so it is typical to leave the 
lights on all night. LEDs don’t have that 
problem. They agreed that 24-hour 
lighting is not a bad assumption. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 118) 
Another manufacturer, Zero Zone, also 
agreed that 24 hours is a valid 
assumption for case lighting operating 
hours. (Zero Zone, No. 17 at p. 4) ARI

recommended that the DOE analysis be 
based on 24 hours-per-day operation as 
this represents the worst-case scenario 
and many stores are open for 24 hours. 
(ARI, No. 18 at p. 4) Based on these 
comments, DOE decided to leave the 
assumption of display case lighting 
operating hours of 24 hours per day 
unchanged for the NOPR analysis. 
Additional detail on the energy use 
characterization can be found in 
Chapter 7 of the TSD. 

DOE also requested comments on 

other operational factors that might be 
encountered in the field that would 
differ from that found in the relevant 
test procedure, the relative frequency of 
these factors, and how it could account 
for them in its energy analysis. DOE 
received a comment from the Chinese 
delegation to the World Trade 
Organization stating that it should 
consider all kinds of on-site factors in 
operation and maintenance practices of 
the commercial refrigerating equipment 
when evaluating the optional standard 
class of the equipment. (China, No. 20 
at pp. 3–4) No specifics on what these 
factors might be or how to take them 
into account were provided, however. 
Chapter 7 of the TSD provides 
additional detail on the energy use 
characterization. 
E. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 
Analyses 

In response to the requirements of 
Section 325(o)(2)(B)(i) of EPCA, DOE 
conducted LCC and PBP analyses to 
evaluate the economic impacts of 
possible new commercial refrigeration 
equipment standards on individual 
customers. This section describes the 
LCC and PBP analyses and the 
spreadsheet model DOE used for 
analyzing the economic impacts of 
possible standards on individual 
commercial customers. Details of the 
spreadsheet model, and of all the inputs 
to the LCC and PBP analyses, are in TSD 
Chapter 8. DOE conducted the LCC and 
PBP analyses using a spreadsheet model 
developed in Microsoft Excel for 
Windows 2003. 

The LCC is the total cost for a unit of 

commercial refrigeration equipment, 

over the life of the equipment, including 
purchase and installation expense and 
operating costs (energy expenditures 
and maintenance). To compute the LCC, 
DOE summed the installed price of the 
equipment and its lifetime operating 
costs discounted to the time of 
purchase. The PBP is the change in 
purchase expense due to a given energy 
conservation standard divided by the 
change in first-year operating cost that 
results from the standard. DOE 
expresses PBP in years. Otherwise 
stated, the payback period is the number 
of years it would take for the customer 
to recover the increased costs of a 
higher-efficiency product through 
energy savings. DOE measures the 
changes in LCC and in PBP associated 
with a given energy use standard level 
relative to a base case forecast of 
equipment energy use. The base case 
forecast reflects the market in the 
absence of mandatory energy 
conservation standards. 

The data inputs to the PBP calculation 

are the purchase expense (otherwise 
known as the total installed customer 
cost or first cost) and the annual 
operating costs for each selected design. 
The inputs to the equipment purchase 
expense were the equipment price and 
the installation cost, with appropriate 
markups. The inputs to the operating 
costs were the annual energy 
consumption, the electricity price, and 
the repair and maintenance costs. The 
PBP calculation uses the same inputs as 
the LCC analysis but, since it is a simple 
payback, the operating cost is for the 
year the standard takes effect, assumed 
to be 2012. For each efficiency level 
analyzed, the LCC analysis required 
input data for the total installed cost of 
the equipment, the operating cost, and 
the discount rate. 

Table IV–13 summarizes the inputs 
and key assumptions used to calculate 
the customer economic impacts of 
various energy consumption levels. 
Equipment price, installation cost, and 
baseline and standard design selection 
affect the installed cost of the 
equipment. Annual energy use, 
electricity costs, electricity price trends, 
and repair and maintenance costs affect

the operating cost. The effective date of 
the standard, the discount rate, and the 
lifetime of equipment affect the 

calculation of the present value of 
annual operating cost savings from a 
proposed standard. Table IV–13 also 

shows how DOE modified these inputs 
and key assumptions for the NOPR, 
relative to the ANOPR.

analysis.

The following sections contain brief 
discussions of the methods underlying 
each input and key assumption in the 
LCC analysis. Where appropriate, DOE 
also summarizes comments on these 
inputs and assumptions and explains 
how it took these comments into 
consideration. 
1. Manufacturer Selling Price 

The baseline MSP is the price charged 
by manufacturers to either a wholesaler/ 
distributor or very large customer for 
equipment meeting existing energy use 
(or baseline) levels. The MSP includes 
a markup that converts the MPC to MSP. 
DOE obtained the baseline MSPs 
through industry-supplied efficiency- 
level data supplemented with a design 
option analysis. Refer to Chapter 5 of 
the TSD for details. 

DOE developed MSPs for equipment 

classes consisting of eight possible 
equipment families, two possible 
condensing unit configurations (remote 
condensing and self-contained), and 
three possible operating temperature 
ranges. Not all covered equipment

classes have significant actual 
shipments (Chapter 3 of the TSD). DOE 
carried out the LCC and PBP analyses 
on the 15 primary equipment classes 
identified earlier. DOE estimated the 
MSP for each primary equipment class 
between the baseline efficiency level 
and for four to seven additional more- 
efficient levels. Refer to Chapter 5 of the 
TSD for details. 

DOE was not able to identify data on 

relative shipments for equipment 
classes by efficiency level, and DOE did 
not find equivalent data in the literature 
or studies. DOE designated the 
equipment with the highest energy use 
as Level 1, and selected this as the 
baseline equipment. 

In the ANOPR analysis, DOE 

requested feedback on whether the 
Level 1 baseline is valid for the LCC 
analysis, and if not, what changes 
should be made to provide a more 
realistic baseline level. DOE also asked 
whether a distribution of efficiencies 
should be used to establish the baseline 
for the LCC analysis. 72 FR 41193, 
41208. DOE received comments on the 

engineering analysis and the use of the 
analytically derived curves versus the 
industry-supplied curves. DOE modified 
the engineering analysis, which resulted 
in a modified Level 1 baseline. See 
Section IV.B for details. 

ARI stated that it would try to provide 

energy efficiency distribution data to 
DOE, but was unable to provide that 
data in time for the NOPR. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 143) 
EEI stated that Electric Power Research 
Institute (EPRI) end use studies might 
provide some data that could be used to 
establish distributions. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 141) ACEEE 
suggested that DOE check with the 
Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance 
for possible energy efficiency 
distribution data. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 142) However, 
ARI agreed with DOE’s approach to use 
the Level 1 data established in the 
engineering analysis as the appropriate 
baseline for DOE’s LCC analysis. DOE 
was able to explore some of the data 
available with the Northwest Energy 
Efficiency Alliance; however, the

available data generally provides only 
frequency of use of specific design 
features and not energy use. Based on 
this, DOE chose to continue to use the 
Level 1 energy efficiency level as the 
baseline efficiency level for the LCC 
analysis. See Chapter 8 of the TSD. 
2. Increase in Selling Price 

The standard level MSP increase is 

the change in MSP associated with 
producing equipment at lower energy 
consumption levels associated with 
higher standards. DOE developed MSP 
increases associated with decreasing 
equipment energy consumption (or 
higher efficiency) levels through a 
combination of energy consumption 
level and design-option analyses. See 
Chapter 5 of the TSD for details. DOE 
developed MSP increases as a function 
of equipment energy consumption for 
each of the 15 equipment classes. 
Although the engineering analysis 
produced up to 11 energy consumption 
levels, depending on equipment class, 
the LCC and PBP analyses used only up 
to eight selected energy consumption 
levels. 
3. Markups 

As discussed earlier, overall markups 

are based on one of three distribution 
channels and the calculation of baseline 
and incremental markups. The 
distribution channels defined in the 
ANOPR were also used for the NOPR 
analysis, but DOE modified the relative 
fractions of shipments through each 
distribution channel based on 
stakeholder input. See Section IV.C, 
Markups to Determine Equipment Price, 
for details. 
4. Installation Costs 

In the ANOPR, DOE derived 

installation costs for commercial 
refrigeration equipment from data 
provided in RS Means Mechanical Cost 
Data.19 RS Means provides estimates on 
the person-hours required to install 
commercial refrigeration equipment and 
the labor rates associated with the type 
of crew required to install the 
equipment. DOE developed separate 
installation costs for self-contained and 
remote condensing equipment. DOE 
considered the installation costs to be 
fixed, independent of the cost or 
efficiency of the equipment. Although 
the LCC spreadsheet allows for 
alternative scenarios, DOE did not find 
a basis for changing its basic premise for 
the ANOPR analysis. 

DOE received comments on the RS 

Means installation costs. Zero Zone 

commented that the installation costs 
seem low, and that it tracks installation 
costs and would provide installation 
cost data to DOE. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 133) 
Separately, Zero Zone provided 
installation costs of $2,000 and $750, 
respectively, for remote condensing and 
self-contained equipment. DOE has 
decided to use these cost data in the 
NOPR analysis. Zero Zone also stated 
that a high-efficiency case installation 
isn’t going to cost significantly more 
than a standard case unless there are 
more controls to tune and adjust. SCE 
stated that if the installation cost doesn’t 
change with the equipment efficiency, 
then it doesn’t affect the relative life- 
cycle cost. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 117) 

The total installed cost is the sum of 

the equipment price and the installation 
cost. DOE derived the customer 
equipment price for any given standard 
level by multiplying the baseline MSP 
by the baseline markup and adding to it 
the product of the incremental MSP and 
the incremental markup. Because MSPs, 
markups, and the sales tax can take on 
a variety of values depending on 
location, the resulting total installed 
cost for a particular standard level will 
not be a single-point value, but a 
distribution of values. See Chapter 8 of 
the TSD. 
5. Energy Consumption 

The electricity consumed by the 

commercial refrigeration equipment was 
based on the engineering analysis 
estimates as described previously in 
Section IV.B. No change was made to 
the ANOPR methodology. 
6. Electricity Prices 

Electricity prices are necessary to 

convert the electric energy savings into 
energy cost savings. Because of the wide 
variation in electricity consumption 
patterns, wholesale costs, and retail 
rates across the country, it is important 
to consider regional differences in 
electricity prices. DOE used average 
commercial electricity prices at the 
State level from the EIA Monthly 
Electricity Database.20 The 2006 prices 
were then converted to 2007$ using 
AEO2007. 

Different kinds of businesses typically 

use electricity in different amounts at 
different times of the day, week, and 
year, and therefore face different 
effective prices. To make this 
adjustment, DOE used the 2003 
Commercial Building Energy 

19 RS Means Company, Inc. 2005. Mechanical 

Cost Data 28th Annual Edition. Kingston, 
Massachusetts. 

20 EIA form 826. Annual 1991 through 2006, Jan- 
Feb 2007. http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/ 
page/data.html. Accessed May 29, 2007. 

Consumption Survey (CBECS) data to 
identify the average prices the four 
kinds of businesses in this analysis paid 
compared with the average prices all 
commercial customers paid. The ratios 
of prices paid by the four types of 
businesses to the national average 
commercial prices seen in the 2003 
CBECS were used as multiplying factors 
to increase or decrease the average 
commercial 2006 price data previously 
developed. Once the electricity prices 
for the four types of businesses were 
adjusted, the resulting prices were used 
in the analysis. 

To obtain a weighted-average national 
electricity price, the prices paid by each 
business in each State was weighted by 
the estimated sales of frozen and 
refrigerated food products, which also 
serves as the distribution of commercial 
refrigeration equipment units in each 
State, to each prototype building. The 
State/business type weights are the 
probabilities that a given commercial 
refrigeration equipment unit shipped 
will be operated with a given electricity 
price. For evaluation purposes, the 
prices and weights can be depicted as a 
cumulative probability distribution. The 
effective electricity prices range from 
approximately 5 cents per kWh to 
approximately 22 cents per kWh. 

During the ANOPR public meeting, 
EEI concurred with the DOE analysis 
that shows grocery stores and food 
markets having lower electric prices 
than typical commercial facilities. (EEI, 
No. 15 at p. 3) DOE continued to use the 
same approach to develop electric 
prices for the NOPR analysis; however, 
DOE updated electric costs to 2007$. 
The section below describes the 
development and use of State-average 
electricity prices by building type; 
Chapter 8 of the TSD provides more 
detail. 
7. Electricity Price Trends 

The electricity price trend provides 
the relative change in electricity prices 
for future years to 2030. Estimating 
future electricity prices is difficult, 
especially considering that many States 
are attempting to restructure the 
electricity supply industry. DOE applied 
the AEO2007 reference case as the 
default scenario and extrapolated the 
trend in values from 2020 to 2030 of the 
forecast to establish prices in 2030 to 
2042. This method of extrapolation is in 
line with methods the EIA uses to 
forecast fuel prices for the Federal 
Energy Management Program (FEMP). 
DOE provided a sensitivity analysis of 
the life-cycle cost savings and PBP 
results to future electricity price 
scenarios using both the AEO2007 high- 
growth and low-growth forecasts in

Chapter 8 of the TSD. ACEEE suggested 
that the NOPR economic analysis be 
recalculated using AEO2008 price 
forecasts. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) 
However, the AEO2008 was not 
available when DOE was completing the 
NOPR analysis. DOE used the most 
recent AEO forecast available 
(AEO2007) when it performed the LCC 
analysis for the NOPR. 
8. Repair Costs 

The equipment repair cost is the cost 
to the customer of replacing or repairing 
components in commercial refrigeration 
equipment that have failed. For the 
ANOPR analysis, DOE calculated the 
annualized repair cost for baseline 
efficiency equipment using the 
following expression: 
RC = k × EQP/LIFE 
Where 

RC = repair cost in dollars 
k = fraction of equipment price (estimated 

to be 0.5) 

and 

EQP = baseline equipment price in dollars, 

LIFE = average lifetime of the equipment in 

years (estimated to be 10 years for large 
grocery and multi-line retail chains and 
15 years for small grocery and 
convenience stores) 

DOE placed replacement of lighting 

components (lamps and ballasts) under 
maintenance expenses since the typical 
lamp life is known and commonly 
considered a maintenance item by 
customers of commercial refrigeration 
equipment. 

Because data were not available for 
how repair costs vary with equipment 
efficiency, DOE held repair costs 
constant as the default scenario for the 
ANOPR LCC and PBP analyses. DOE 
received several comments on the use of 
constant repair costs for higher 
efficiency equipment. Carrier stated that 
while it had no data to support this, 
higher efficiency design options—like 
adding controls—could cost more to 
repair, and it encouraged DOE to find 
more accurate repair costs that would 
correlate with more sophisticated 
controls. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 135) Carrier felt that 
making repair costs proportional was 
better than making them flat. ARI stated 
that the assumption that repair costs are 
constant and do not vary with 
equipment efficiency is incorrect. (ARI, 
No. 18 at p. 7) Industry experience 
indicates that higher efficiency 
equipment is more expensive to repair 
because it uses more sophisticated and 
more expensive components. If actual 
cost data are not available, ARI 
recommended that DOE assume the 
repair cost to increase as a function of 
equipment cost. True stated that many

routine maintenance items are affected 
by higher efficiency fan motors and 
lighting systems. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 136) Hill 
Phoenix stated that higher maintenance 
costs would be incurred with almost 
any new technology. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 136) However, 
True Manufacturing also stated that no 
data exists as to whether components 
such as energy efficient motors would 
have the same lifetime or costs as 
existing components. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 138) ACEEE 
stated that it would caution against a 
straight ratio of repair cost to initial 
purchase cost; for controls this might be 
appropriate, but it shouldn’t affect 
repair costs for heat exchangers. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 137) 
ACEEE suggested that any measures 
requiring increased repair costs be 
treated on a measure-by-measure basis. 
(ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 3) 

To address comments on repair costs, 
DOE contacted users and manufacturers 
of commercial refrigeration equipment 
to determine typical repair frequency for 
components used in commercial 
refrigeration equipment. Based on this 
review, DOE estimated replacement 
frequencies for five key components that 
appear to represent the most common 
repairs, and for which higher efficiency 
and more costly components were used 
in the engineering analysis for higher 
efficiency commercial refrigeration 
equipment. DOE then annualized the 
expected costs for these components at 
each efficiency level and added these 
component costs to the baseline repair 
cost estimates. This resulted in repair 
costs that increase with higher 
efficiency equipment. Refer to Chapter 8 
of the TSD for details. 
9. Maintenance Costs 

DOE estimated the annualized 

maintenance costs for commercial 
refrigeration equipment from data in RS 
Means Facilities Maintenance & Repair 
Cost Data.21 RS Means provides 
estimates on the person-hours, labor 
rates, and materials required to maintain 
commercial refrigeration equipment on 
a semi-annual basis. DOE used a single 
figure of $160/year (2007$) for 
preventive maintenance for all classes of 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
based on data from RS Means. Because 
data were not available to indicate 
whether, and if so, how, maintenance 
costs vary with equipment efficiency, 
DOE held preventive maintenance costs 
constant even as equipment efficiency 

increased. Lamp replacement and other 
lighting maintenance activities are 
required maintenance for commercial 
refrigeration equipment, which DOE 
considered to be separate from 
preventive maintenance, and were not 
itemized in the preventive maintenance 
activities described by RS Means. 
Different commercial refrigeration 
equipment classes have different 
numbers of lamps (and ballasts), and 
many of the efficiency options DOE 
considered in the engineering analysis 
involved changes to the lighting 
configuration (lamp, ballast, or use of 
LED lighting systems). Because the 
lighting configurations can vary by 
energy consumption level, DOE 
estimated the relative maintenance costs 
for lighting for each case type for which 
a design-option analysis was performed. 
DOE estimated the frequency of failure 
and replacement of individual lighting 
components, estimated the cost of 
replacement in the field, and developed 
an annualized maintenance cost based 
on the sum of the total lighting 
maintenance costs (in 2007$) over the 
estimated life of the equipment divided 
by the estimated life of the equipment. 
DOE based costs for fluorescent lamp 
and ballast replacements on a review of 
the OEM costs used in the engineering 
analysis, RS Means estimates, cost data 
from Grainger, Inc., and previous 
studies. DOE estimated the costs of field 
replacement using labor cost hours from 
RS Means Electrical Cost Data 22 for 
typical lamp or ballast replacement for 
other lighting fixtures using a 150- 
percent multiplier on OEM costs for 
lamps and ballasts (provided in the 
engineering analysis spreadsheets) to 
reflect retail pricing. See Chapter 8 of 
the TSD for details. 

Fluorescent lamp and ballast 

technology is mature, so DOE made no 
change in inflation-adjusted costs for 
these components. However, because of 
rapid technological improvement, costs 
for LED lamps are declining. DOE 
estimated the cost for field replacement 
of LED lighting fixtures (believed to 
occur approximately 6 years after the 
effective date of the standard, or 2018) 
at 140 percent of the OEM cost of LED 
lighting fixtures (2007 MPC cost in 
2007$), plus installation. This estimate 
includes installation labor and all retail 
markups for replacement fixtures. This 
estimate of replacement LED costs was 
based on 2007 OEM prices for LED 
fixtures, but with additional contractor 
markups for replacement fixtures 
similar to that used for fluorescent light 
ballasts and lamps (150 percent of OEM

costs). In addition, because of the rapid 
development of LED technology and the 
projected OEM cost reductions for LED 
systems, DOE performed an LCC 
sensitivity analysis that examined the 
impact of reducing the cost of the LED 
replacement fixtures in 2018 by 50 
percent of the cost used in the base 
analysis.23 DOE recognizes that both life 
and cost estimates for LED replacement 
are projections and seeks comment on 
how it can best estimate the price for 
replacement LED fixture costs in the 
LCC analysis. This is identified as Issue 
1 under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in Section VII.E of this 
NOPR. Chapter 8 of the TSD provides 
details on the development of 
maintenance costs. 
10. Lifetime 

DOE defines lifetime as the age when 

a commercial refrigeration equipment 
unit is retired from service. In its 
ANOPR analysis, DOE based equipment 
lifetime on discussions with industry 
experts and other stakeholders, as well 
as a review of estimates in the subject 
literature. DOE concluded that a typical 
lifetime of 10 years is appropriate for 
commercial refrigeration equipment. In 
commenting on the ANOPR analysis, 
ARI stated that, on average, equipment 
lifetime is approximately 10 years. ARI 
noted, however, that properly installed 
and maintained equipment typically has 
a useful life longer than end-use 
customers retain it due to retail store 
customer business models and 
competitive demands to upgrade and 
remodel stores. (ARI, No. 18 at p. 5) 
Zero Zone stated that door cases may be 
changed in store remodels every 10 
years at larger chains, but small 
independent chains will use cases for 20 
years. (Zero Zone, No. 17 at p. 4) True 
stated that most self-contained 
equipment has a life expectancy of 7 to 
12 years, although it regularly services 
equipment that is 25 years old. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 98) 
For the NOPR analysis, DOE used an 
average life of 10 years for large grocery 
and multi-line retailers, but modified 
the lifetime in the LCC analysis to use 
a longer average 15-year life for the 
small grocery and convenience store 
business types, consistent with 
stakeholder comments and equipment 
life estimates from industry experts 
regarding smaller stores and 
independent grocers and chains. See 
Chapter 3 of the TSD for more detail. 

23 DOE anticipates a reduction in installed cost of 
LED systems over time. The projected reduction in 
price for LED systems is provided and discussed in 
Sections V.C and IV.B.3.c of this NOPR and 
Appendix B of the TSD.

Commercial refrigeration equipment 

units are typically replaced when stores 
are renovated, which is before the units 
would have physically worn out. 
Therefore, there is a used equipment 
market for commercial refrigeration 
equipment. Due to the difficulty of 
incorporating used equipment into 
grocery store display case line-ups, the 
salvage value to the original purchaser 
is very low. Therefore, the ANOPR LCC 
analysis did not take the used 
equipment market into account. This 
methodology was also maintained in the 
NOPR LCC analysis. 
11. Discount Rate 

The discount rate is the rate at which 

future expenditures are discounted to 
establish their present value. DOE 
derived the discount rates for the LCC 
analysis by estimating the cost of capital 
for companies that purchase commercial 
refrigeration equipment. The cost of 
capital is commonly used to estimate 
the present value of cash flows to be 
derived from a typical company project 
or investment. Most companies use both 
debt and equity capital to fund 
investments, so their cost of capital is 
the weighted average of the cost to the 
company of equity and debt financing. 

DOE estimated the cost of equity 
financing by using the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM, 
among the most widely used models to 
estimate the cost of equity financing, 
considers the cost of equity to be 
proportional to the amount of 
systematic risk associated with a 
company. The cost of equity financing 
tends to be high when a company faces 
a large degree of systematic risk, and it 
tends to be low when the company faces 
a small degree of systematic risk. 

To estimate the weighted average cost 

of capital (WACC) (including the 
weighted average cost of debt and equity 
financing) of commercial refrigeration 
equipment purchasers, DOE used a 
sample of companies involved in 
grocery and multi-line retailing drawn 
from a database of 7,319 U.S. companies 
on the Damodaran Online website. The 
WACC approach taken to determine 
discount rates takes into account the 
current tax status of the individual firms 
on an overall corporate basis. DOE did 
not evaluate the marginal effects of 
increased costs (and thus depreciation 
due to higher cost equipment on the 
overall tax status). 

DOE used a sample of 17 companies 

to represent the purchasers of 
commercial refrigeration equipment. For 
each company in the sample, DOE 
derived the cost of debt, percent debt 
financing, and systematic company risk 
from information provided by 

Damodaran Online. DOE estimated the 
cost of debt financing from the long- 
term Government bond rate (4.39 
percent) and the standard deviation of 
the stock price. The cost of capital for 
small, independent grocers; 
convenience store franchisees; gasoline 
station owner-operators; and others with 
more limited access to capital is more 
difficult to determine. Individual credit- 
worthiness varies considerably, and 
some franchisees have access to the 
financial resources of the franchising 
corporation. However, personal contacts 
with a sample of commercial bankers 
yielded an estimate for the small 
operator weighted cost of capital of 
about 200 to 300 basis points (2 percent 
to 3 percent) above the rates for large 
grocery chains. A central value equal to 
the weighted average of large grocery 
chains, plus 250 basis points (2.5 
percent), was used for small operators. 
Deducting expected inflation from the 
cost of capital provides the estimates of 
the real discount rate by ownership 
category. The average after-tax discount 
rate, weighted by the percentage shares 
of total purchases of commercial 
refrigeration equipment, is 5.87 percent 
for large grocery stores, 5.11 percent for 
multi-line retailers, and 8.37 percent for 
convenience stores and convenience 
stores associated with gasoline stations. 
DOE received no comments on the 
discount rates developed in the ANOPR 
but took advantage of the availability of 
2007 financial data to update the 
discount rate assumptions in the NOPR. 
See Chapter 8 of the TSD. 
12. Payback Period 

The PBP is the amount of time it takes 

the customer to recover the 
incrementally higher purchase cost of 
more energy efficient equipment as a 
result of lower operating costs. 
Numerically, the PBP is the ratio of the 
increase in purchase cost (i.e., from a 
less efficient design to a more efficient 
design) to the decrease in annual 
operating expenditures. This type of 
calculation is known as a ‘‘simple’’ PBP, 
because it does not take into account 
changes in operating cost over time or 
the time value of money, that is, the 
calculation is done at an effective 
discount rate of zero percent. 

The equation for PBP is: 

PBP = DIC/DOC 
Where 

PBP = payback period in years, 
DIC = difference in the total installed cost 

between the more efficient standard level 
equipment (energy consumption levels 2, 
3, etc.) and the baseline (energy 
consumption level 1) equipment, and 

DOC = difference in annual operating costs.

50100 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

The data inputs to the PBP analysis 

are the total installed cost of the 
equipment to the customer for each 
energy consumption level and the 
annual (first-year) operating costs for 
each energy consumption level. The 
inputs to the total installed cost are the 
equipment price and the installation 
cost. The inputs to the operating costs 
are the annual energy cost, the annual 
repair cost, and the annual maintenance 
cost. The PBP uses the same inputs as 
the LCC analysis, except that electricity 
price trends and discount rates are not 
required. Since the PBP is a ‘‘simple’’ 
(undiscounted) payback, the required 
electricity cost is only for the year in 
which a new energy conservation 
standard is to take effect—in this case, 
2012. The electricity price used in the 
PBP calculation of electricity cost was 
the price projected for 2012, expressed 
in 2007$, but not discounted to 2007. 
Discount rates are not used in the PBP 
calculation. 

PBP is one of the economic indicators 
that DOE uses when assessing economic 
impact to a customer. PBP does not take 
into account the time value of money 
explicitly (e.g., through a discount 
factor), the life of the efficiency 
measure, or changing fuel costs over 
time. In addition, because PBP takes 
into account the cumulative energy and 
first-cost impact of a set of efficiency 
measures, it can be sensitive to the 
baseline level assumed. In addition, 
what is deemed an acceptable payback 
period can vary. By contrast, when 
examining LCC savings by efficiency 
levels, there is generally a maximum 
LCC savings point (minimum LCC 
efficiency level) indicative of maximum 
economic benefit to the customer. The 
selection of the baseline efficiency level 
does not affect the identification of the 
minimum LCC efficiency level, although 
a baseline efficiency is used when 
calculating net LCC savings or costs. 
DOE considers both LCC and PBP as 
related to the seven factors discussed in 
Section II.B to determine whether a 
standard is economically justified and 
whether the benefits of an energy 
conservation standard will exceed its 
burdens to the greatest extent 
practicable. However, because LCC uses 
an explicit discount rate, takes into 
account changing energy prices, and 
does not require selection of a baseline 
efficiency level, it is considered by DOE 
to be a better indicator of the likely 
economic impacts on consumers. 
F. Shipments Analysis 

One of the more important 

components of any estimate of the 
future impact of a standard is 
equipment shipments. DOE developed

forecasts of shipments for the base case 
and standards cases and includes those 
forecasts in the NES spreadsheet. The 
shipments portion of the spreadsheet 
forecasts shipments of commercial 
refrigeration equipment from 2012 to 
2042. DOE developed shipments 
forecasts for the 15 primary equipment 
classes by accounting for the shipments 
to replace the existing stock of 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
commercial refrigeration shipments into 
new commercial floor spaces, and old 
equipment removed through 
demolitions. Chapter 10 of the TSD 
provides additional details on the 
shipments forecasts. 

The results of the shipments analysis 

are driven primarily by historical 
shipments data for the 15 equipment 
classes of commercial refrigeration 
equipment, DOE estimates of average 
equipment life, relative shipment 
estimates to each of the four business 
types, the existing total floor space in 
food sales buildings, and the anticipated 
growth in food sales floor space 
estimated in EIA’s NEMS. The model 
estimates that, in each year, the existing 
stock of commercial refrigeration 
equipment either ages by one year or is 
worn out and replaced. In addition, new 
equipment can be shipped into new 
commercial floor space, and old 
equipment can be removed through 
demolitions. DOE chose to preserve the 
capability to analyze all efficiency levels 
analyzed in the LCC in the NIA. 

The shipments analysis is a 

description of commercial refrigeration 
equipment stock flows as a function of 
year and age. While there are 15 
equipment classes, the shipment 
analysis treats each category of 
equipment independently such that 
future shipments in any one class are 
unaffected by shipments in any other 
equipment classes and the relative 
fraction of shipments in each product 
class compared to all commercial 
refrigeration equipment shipments is 
assumed to be constant over time. DOE 
recognizes that a retailer of refrigerated 
or frozen food can choose to use 
different classes of commercial 
refrigeration equipment to sell the same 
food product as long as the equipment 
is in the required temperature range (i.e. 
refrigerator, freezer, or ice-cream 
temperature range). The decision to 
adopt one equipment class over another 
within the same temperature range will 
depend on first costs, operating costs, 
and the perceived ability to 
merchandise product. In addition, 
relative sales refrigerated versus frozen 
foods could change in the future. 
However, DOE had no information with 
which to develop and calibrate a 

shipments model incorporating these 
factors. 

DOE formulated the equations used in 

the analysis as updates of the 
distribution of stock in any given year, 
as a function of age, to the following 
year using the following steps: 

1. DOE first converted the equipment 

units to linear feet of display space 
cooled by those units by taking the 
national statistics on sales of equipment 
and calculating equipment capacity per 
linear foot of retail grocery building 
display space. 

2. DOE used this calculation of 

existing stock, and the average age of the 
equipment, as a basis for calculating 
replacement sales. 

3. DOE subtracted replacement sales 

from historical total sales statistics to 
calculate new sales of commercial 
refrigeration equipment. 

4. DOE forecasted new sales as a 

function of new construction of retail 
food sales space. 

5. DOE recorded sales of new and 
replacement equipment by the year 
sold, and depreciated each annual 
vintage over the estimated life of the 
equipment. 

6. DOE allocated sales in each year to 
the 15 equipment classes in proportion 
to their relative historical sales. 

In response to DOE’s presentation of 

the ANOPR shipment analysis, the 
public made two primary comments. 
True stated that while food sales 
buildings are probably representative of 
remote condensing equipment, as much 
as 25 percent of the self-contained 
market goes into unusual conditions, 
but that the majority does end up in 
some sort of food-sales type application. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 165) However, in a follow-up 
conversation, True agreed that for self- 
contained equipment without doors, 
which is the majority of the self- 
contained equipment covered in this 
rulemaking, the amount of equipment 
not shipped to food sales buildings 
represents a very small fraction of the 
total market. DOE concluded that it was 
therefore unnecessary to include other 
business types or building categories for 
the analysis of self-contained equipment 
to be valid and representative. 

Other stakeholders commented on the 

assumption of zero shipments in the 
ANOPR for the VOP.RC.L equipment 
class based on the submitted ARI 
shipment data. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 164) ARI, in 
turn, stated that zero values in its data 
submittal to DOE may represent an 
equipment class where only one or two 
manufacturers have shipments. These 
data were excluded to maintain 
confidentiality. (Public Meeting

50101 

Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 52) To address 
these issues, DOE estimated the 
shipments for the VOP.RC.L equipment 
class at five percent of the similarly 
designed VOP.RC.M equipment class 
based on information provided in 
manufacturer interviews. 

Finally, DOE received comments on 

the impact of the used equipment 
market on shipments in the presence of 
new equipment standards. True stated 
that DOE should consider how long 
existing low-efficiency equipment will 
be in service. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 98) As you 
drive the cost higher, the life expectancy 
of existing equipment increases. ACEEE 
countered, however, that the issue of 
used equipment has come up in other 
rulemakings. Customers may use 
existing equipment longer, but the 
average was only one or two years more, 
which has a small impact on the energy 
savings projected through 2042. It may 
be more of a factor in the manufacturer 
impact analysis, because that could 
affect sales in at least the first year. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 102) 

True stated that the used equipment 
market is often ignored. As you drive 
costs of capital up, you drive the need 
for low-end users to buy used 
equipment and that the higher the cost 

per unit, the more the used equipment 
market thrives. True stated that this is 
very significant in the restaurant 
industry, where studies suggest that 90 
percent of all new non-chain restaurants 
fail within the first year. Most of these 
businesses are buying used equipment. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 202–207) EEI suggested that, if 
possible, DOE should investigate the use 
of used versus new equipment in 
restaurants, and make sure that new 
standards do not increase the purchase 
of older, less efficient equipment. (EEI, 
No. 15 at p. 2) 

Follow-up conversations with True 

lead DOE to believe that it is 
unnecessary to take the restaurant 
business type into account since it is not 
a large market for the equipment 
covered under this rulemaking. DOE 
determined that it would not try to 
account for life extension in the NIA. 
While DOE recognizes that there may be 
some initial life extension for existing 
markets for some customers, no data are 
available to forecast the frequency and 
amount of life extension that might 
occur within the industry. DOE agrees 
with ACEEE that this would result in a 
relatively small impact on energy 
savings and, given that it would also 
reduce expenditures for new equipment, 
would have an even smaller impact on 

calculated NPV. For the NOPR analysis, 
DOE did not assume an initial decrease 
in sales and life extension for 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
covered in this rulemaking. 

Table IV–14 shows the results of the 

shipments analysis for the 15 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
classes for the base case (baseline 
efficiency level or Level 1). As 
equipment purchase price increases 
with higher efficiency levels, a drop in 
shipments can be expected relative to 
the base case. However, as annual 
energy consumption is reduced, there is 
potentially a countering effect of 
increased equipment sales due to more 
frequent installations and use of 
commercial refrigeration equipment by 
retailers (a potential rebound effect). 
Although there is a provision in the 
spreadsheet for a change in projected 
shipments in response to efficiency 
level increases (or energy consumption 
level decreases), DOE has no 
information with which to calibrate 
such a relationship. No such data was 
provided in comments on the ANOPR 
analysis. Therefore, for the NOPR 
analysis, DOE assumed that the overall 
shipments do not change in response to 
the changing TSLs. Additional details 
on the shipments analysis can be found 
in Chapter 10 of the TSD.

G. National Impact Analysis 

The NIA assesses future NES and the 
national economic impacts of different 
efficiency levels. The analysis measures 
economic impacts using the NPV metric 
(i.e., future amounts discounted to the 
present) of total commercial customer 
costs and savings expected to result 
from new standards at specific 
efficiency levels. 

To make the analysis more accessible 
and transparent to the public, DOE used 

an Excel spreadsheet model to calculate 
the energy savings and the national 
economic costs and savings from new 
standards. Excel is the most widely used 
spreadsheet calculation tool in the 
United States and there is general 
familiarity with its basic features. Thus, 
DOE’s use of Excel as the basis for the 
spreadsheet models provides interested 
persons with access to the models 
within a familiar context. In addition, 
the TSD and other documentation that 

DOE provides during the rulemaking 
help explain the models and how to use 
them, and interested persons can review 
DOE’s analyses by changing various 
input quantities within the spreadsheet. 

Unlike the LCC analysis, the NES 

spreadsheet does not use distributions 
for inputs or outputs. DOE examined 
sensitivities by applying different 
scenarios. DOE used the NES 
spreadsheet to perform calculations of 
national energy savings and NPV using

the annual energy consumption and 
total installed cost data from the LCC 
analysis and estimates of national 
shipments for each of the 15 primary 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
classes. DOE forecasted the energy 
savings, energy cost savings, equipment 
costs, and NPV of benefits for all 
primary commercial refrigeration 
equipment classes from 2012 through 
2062. The forecasts provided annual 

and cumulative values for all four 
output parameters. 

DOE calculated the NES by 
subtracting energy use under a 
standards scenario from energy use in a 
base case (no new standards) scenario. 
Energy use is reduced when a unit of 
commercial refrigeration equipment in 
the base case efficiency distribution is 
replaced by a more efficient piece of 
equipment. Energy savings for each 
equipment class are the same national 

average values as calculated in the LCC 
and payback period spreadsheet. 
However, these results are normalized 
on a per-unit-length basis by equipment 
class and applied to the total annual 
estimated shipments in terms of line-up 
length of all equipment with the class. 
Table IV–15 shows key inputs to the 
NIA. Chapter 11 of the TSD provides 
additional information about the NES 
spreadsheet.

1. Base Case and Standards Case 
Forecasted Efficiencies 

A key component of DOE’s estimates 

of NES and NPV are the energy 
efficiencies for shipped equipment that 
it forecasts over time for the base case 
(without new standards) and for each 
standards case. The forecasted 
efficiencies represent the distribution of 
energy efficiency of the equipment 
under consideration that is shipped over 
the forecast period (i.e., from the 
assumed effective date of a new 
standard to 30 years after the standard 
becomes effective). 

The annual per-unit energy 
consumption is the site energy 
consumed by a commercial refrigeration 
equipment unit per year. The annual 
energy consumption is directly tied to 
the efficiency of the unit. Thus, 
knowing the efficiency of a commercial 
refrigeration equipment unit determines 
the corresponding annual energy 
consumption. DOE determined annual 
forecasted market shares by efficiency 
level that, in turn, enabled 
determination of shipment-weighted 
annual energy consumption values. 
Because no data were available on 

market shares broken down by 
efficiency level, DOE determined market 

shares by efficiency level for 
commercial refrigeration based on its 
own analysis. DOE first converted 2005 
shipment information by equipment 
class into market shares by equipment 
class, and then adapted a cost-based 
method similar to that used in the 
NEMS to estimate market shares for 
each equipment class by efficiency 
level. This cost-based method relied on 
cost data developed in the engineering 
and life-cycle cost analyses, as well as 
economic purchase criteria data taken 
directly from NEMS. From those market 
shares and projections of shipments by 
equipment class, DOE developed the 
future efficiency scenarios for a base

case (i.e., without new standards) and 
for various standards cases (i.e., with 
new standards). DOE did not have data 
to calibrate this approach to actual 
market shipments by efficiency level. 
DOE requested comment on this 
approach to generating market shares by 
efficiency level in the ANOPR. 

Commenting on the distribution of 

market efficiency, ARI stated that 
experience with other equipment tells 
us that the majority of the shipments are 
usually at the lower end of the curve of 
the highest efficiency. ARI was 
surprised that DOE had only 25 percent 
or 30 percent of the shipments at that 
efficiency level. They also cautioned 
DOE that the industry-supplied curves 
are cost curves and do not mean that 
such equipment is on the market today. 
As Section IV.E, Life-Cycle Cost, 
discusses, ARI offered to try to provide 
data on the distribution of efficiencies 
in current equipment but was not able 
to do so. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
13.5 at p. 143) Other stakeholders, such 
as EEI and ACEEE, suggested possible 
avenues that DOE could examine but 
did not have data DOE could use to 
establish a distribution of efficiencies. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 141–142; p. 173) Because of the lack 
of data on market shipments by 
efficiency level, DOE chose to continue 
to use the ANOPR approach to estimate 
shipments by efficiency level. 

DOE developed base case efficiency 

forecasts based on the estimated market 
shares by equipment class and 
efficiency level. Because there are no 
historical data to indicate how 
equipment efficiencies or relative 
equipment class preferences have 
changed over time, DOE predicted that 
forecasted market shares would remain 
frozen at the 2012 efficiency level until 
the end of the forecast period (30 years 
after the effective date, 2042). DOE 
requested comments on this 
assumption. 

Copeland commented that since DOE 

plans to update the forecast in five 
years, no one can really figure out what 
that distribution of efficiency in the 
future looks like. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 175) EEI 
suggested DOE make further contacts 
with national accounts that use 
commercial refrigeration equipment. No 
suggestions for improving this 
assumption were received. For the 
NOPR, DOE continued to use the 
assumption of flat market shares by 
efficiency level for the forecast period. 

For its determination of standards 

case forecasted efficiencies, DOE used a 
‘‘roll-up’’ scenario to establish the 
market shares by efficiency level for 
2012, the year that standards become 

effective. Information available to DOE 
suggests that equipment shipments with 
efficiencies in the base case that did not 
meet the standard level under 
consideration would roll up to meet the 
new standard level, and that all 
equipment efficiencies in the base case 
that were above the standard level 
under consideration would not be 
affected. Emerson commented that a 
standard brings some compression in 
the distribution of efficiencies. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 175) 
However, ARI stated the roll-up 
scenario best represents what is likely to 
happen when energy conservation 
standards take effect. (ARI, No. 18 at p. 
5) DOE continued to use the roll-up 
scenario for the NOPR analysis. 

Finally, DOE recognizes that baseline 

efficiency trends can change if 
equipment costs are different than those 
projected. For example, if LED prices 
drop more than assumed in the 
engineering analysis, consumer demand 
for equipment with LEDs could change. 
DOE seeks comment on whether 
shipments of equipment with LEDs 
would change if LED costs drop and if 
so, the extent and timing of such 
shipment changes. See Section VII.E.1. 
2. Annual Energy Consumption, Total 
Installed Cost, Maintenance Cost, and 
Repair Costs 

The difference in shipments by 

equipment efficiency level between the 
base and standards cases was the basis 
for determining the reduction in per- 
unit annual energy consumption that 
could result from new standards. The 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
stock in a given year is the total linear 
footage of commercial refrigeration 
equipment shipped from earlier years 
that survive in the given year. The NES 
spreadsheet model keeps track of the 
total linear footage of commercial 
refrigeration equipment units shipped 
each year and estimates the total 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
stock for each year. The annual energy 
consumption by efficiency level for each 
equipment category comes from the LCC 
analysis and is converted to a per-linear- 
foot basis by dividing by the length of 
the specific equipment analyzed in the 
engineering analysis. Similarly, the total 
installed cost, maintenance cost, and 
repair costs for each efficiency level for 
each equipment class analyzed in the 
LCC are converted to a per linear foot 
basis. Using the total estimated 
shipments and total estimated stock by 
equipment category and efficiency level, 
DOE calculates the annual energy 
consumption for the commercial 
refrigeration equipment stock in each 
year, the maintenance and repair costs 

associated with the equipment stock, 
and the total installed costs associated 
with new shipments in each year based 
on the standards scenario and 
associated distribution of shipments by 
efficiency level. 
3. Escalation of Electricity Prices 
DOE uses the most recent AEO 

reference case to forecast energy prices 
for standard rulemakings. For the 
ANOPR, DOE used the AEO2006 
reference case forecasts to estimate 
future electricity prices. ACEEE 
commented that it would like DOE to 
use the AEO2008 forecasts for the NOPR 
analysis. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) 
However, this forecast was not available 
when DOE completed the NOPR 
analysis. DOE used the AEO2007 
reference case forecasts for future 
electricity prices, extended out to the 
end of the analysis period. DOE 
extrapolated the trend in values from 
2020 to 2030 of the forecast to establish 
prices for the remainder of the analysis 
period. DOE intends to update its 
analysis for the final rule to reflect the 
AEO 2008 electricity price forecasts 
when final versions of these price 
forecasts are available. An AEO Revised 
Early Release for the AEO 2008 
reference case only has indicated that 
the reference case electricity prices are 
higher in real (inflation adjusted) terms 
and if this holds true in the final release 
it would generally result in more 
favorable economics for higher 
efficiency standard levels (i.e. shorter 
payback periods, greater life-cycle cost 
savings, and greater national net present 
value). 
4. Electricity Site-to-Source Conversion 
The site-to-source conversion factor is 

a multiplier used for converting site 
energy consumption, expressed in kWh, 
into primary or source energy 
consumption, expressed in quadrillion 
Btu (quads). The site-to-source 
conversion factor accounts for losses in 
electricity generation, transmission, and 
distribution. For the ANOPR, DOE used 
site-to-source conversion factors based 
on U.S. average values for the 
commercial sector, calculated from 
AEO2006, Table A5. The average 
conversion factors vary over time, due 
to projected changes in electricity 
generation sources (i.e., the power plant 
types projected to provide electricity to 
the country). For the NOPR, DOE 
developed marginal site-source 
conversion factors that relate the 
national electrical energy savings at the 
point of use to the fuel savings at the 
power plant. These factors use the 
NEMS model and the examination of 
the corresponding energy savings from

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

standards scenarios considered in DOE’s 
utility analysis (Chapter 14 of the TSD). 
The conversion factors vary over time, 
due to projected changes in electricity 
generation sources (i.e., the power plant 
types projected to provide electricity to 
the country) and power plant dispatch 
scenarios. Average U.S. conversion 
factors were used in the ANOPR 
because the utility analysis which is 
used to determine marginal conversion 
factors appropriate to efficiency 
standards for commercial refrigeration 
equipment occurs in the NOPR stage of 
DOE’s analysis. 

To estimate NPV, DOE calculated the 

net impact each year as the difference 
between total operating cost savings 
(including electricity, repair, and 
maintenance cost savings) and increases 
in total installed costs (including MSP, 
sales taxes, distribution channel 
markups, and installation cost). DOE 
calculated the NPV of each TSL over the 
life of the equipment using three steps. 
First, DOE determined the difference 
between the equipment costs under the 
TSL and the base case to calculate the 
net equipment cost increase resulting 
from the TSL. Second, DOE determined 
the difference between the base case 
operating costs and the TSL operating 
costs to calculate the net operating cost 
savings from the TSL. Third, DOE 
determined the difference between the 
net operating cost savings and the net 
equipment cost increase to calculate the 
net savings (or expense) for each year. 
DOE then discounted the annual net 
savings (or expenses) for commercial 
refrigeration equipment purchased on or 
after 2012 to 2008, and summed the 
discounted values to determine the NPV 
of a TSL. An NPV greater than zero 
shows net savings (i.e., the TSL would 
reduce overall customer expenditures 
relative to the base case in present value 
terms). An NPV less than zero indicates 
that the TSL would result in a net 
increase in customer expenditures in 
present value terms. 
H. Life-Cycle Cost Sub-Group Analysis 
In analyzing the potential impact of 

new or amended standards on 
commercial customers, DOE evaluates 
the impact on identifiable groups (i.e., 
sub-groups) of customers, such as 
different types of businesses that may be 
disproportionately affected by a 
National standard level. For this 
rulemaking, DOE identified 
independent small grocery and 
convenience stores as a commercial 
refrigeration equipment customer sub- 
group that could be disproportionately 
affected, and examined the impact of 
proposed standards on this group.

DOE determined the impact on this 

commercial refrigeration equipment 
customer sub-group using the LCC 
spreadsheet model. DOE conducted the 
LCC and PBP analyses for commercial 
refrigeration equipment customers. The 
standard LCC and PBP analyses 
(described in Section IV.E) includes 
various types of businesses that use 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
The LCC spreadsheet model allows for 
the identification of one or more sub- 
groups of businesses, which can then be 
analyzed by sampling only each such 
sub-group. The results of DOE’s LCC 
sub-group analysis are summarized in 
Section V.B.1.c and described in detail 
in Chapter 12 of the TSD. 
I. Manufacturer Impact Analysis 
1. Overview 

DOE performed an MIA to estimate 

the financial impact of energy 
conservation standards on 
manufacturers of commercial 
refrigeration equipment, and to assess 
the impact of such standards on 
employment and manufacturing 
capacity. The MIA has both quantitative 
and qualitative aspects. The quantitative 
part of the MIA relies on the GRIM, an 
industry-cash-flow model customized 
for this rulemaking. The GRIM inputs 
are information regarding the industry 
cost structure, shipments, and revenues. 
This includes information from many of 
the analyses described above, such as 
manufacturing costs and prices from the 
engineering analysis and shipments 
forecasts. The key GRIM output is the 
industry net present value (INPV). The 
model estimates the financial impact of 
energy conservation standards by 
comparing changes in INPV between the 
base case and the various trial standard 
levels. Different sets of assumptions 
(scenarios) will produce different 
results. The qualitative part of the MIA 
addresses factors such as equipment 
characteristics, characteristics of 
particular firms, and market and 
equipment trends, and includes 
assessment of the impacts of standards 
on sub-groups of manufacturers. 
Chapter 13 of the TSD outlines the 
complete MIA. 

DOE conducted the MIA for 

commercial refrigeration equipment in 
three phases. Phase 1, Industry Profile, 
consisted of preparing an industry 
characterization, including data on 
market share, sales volumes and trends, 
pricing, employment, and financial 
structure. Phase 2, Industry Cash Flow 
Analysis, focused on the industry as a 
whole. In this phase, DOE used the 
GRIM to prepare an industry cash-flow 
analysis. Using publicly available 

information developed in Phase 1, DOE 
adapted the GRIM’s generic structure to 
perform an analysis of commercial 
refrigeration equipment energy 
conservation standards. In Phase 3, Sub- 
Group Impact Analysis, DOE conducted 
interviews with manufacturers 
representing the majority of domestic 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
sales. This group included large and 
small manufacturers, providing a 
representative cross-section of the 
industry. During these interviews, DOE 
discussed engineering, manufacturing, 
procurement, and financial topics 
specific to each company and obtained 
each manufacturer’s view of the 
industry. The interviews provided 
valuable information DOE used to 
evaluate the impacts of an energy 
conservation standard on manufacturer 
cash flows, manufacturing capacities, 
and employment levels. For more detail 
on the manufacturer impact analysis, 
refer to Chapter 13 of the TSD. 
a. Phase 1, Industry Profile 

In Phase 1 of the MIA, DOE prepared 
a profile of the commercial refrigeration 
equipment industry based on the market 
and technology assessment prepared for 
this rulemaking. Before initiating the 
detailed impact studies, DOE collected 
information on the present and past 
structure and market characteristics of 
the commercial refrigeration equipment 
industry. The information DOE 
collected at that time included market 
share, equipment shipments, markups, 
and cost structure for various 
manufacturers. The industry profile 
includes further detail on equipment 
characteristics, estimated manufacturer 
market shares, the financial situation of 
manufacturers, trends in the number of 
firms, the market, and equipment 
characteristics of the commercial 
refrigeration equipment industry. 

The industry profile included a top- 

down cost analysis of commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
that DOE used to derive cost and 
preliminary financial inputs for the 
GRIM (e.g., revenues; material, labor, 
overhead, and depreciation expenses; 
selling, general, and administrative 
expenses (SG&A); and research and 
development (R&D) expenses). DOE also 
used public sources of information to 
further calibrate its initial 
characterization of the industry, 
including U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) 10–K reports, 
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) stock reports, 
and corporate annual reports. 
b. Phase 2, Industry Cash-Flow Analysis

financial impacts of energy conservation

standards on the industry. Higher 
energy conservation standards can affect 
a manufacturer’s cash flow in three 
distinct ways, resulting in: (1) A need 
for increased investment; (2) higher 
production costs per unit; and (3) 
altered revenue by virtue of higher per- 
unit prices and changes in sales values. 
To quantify these impacts in Phase 2 of 
the MIA, DOE used the GRIM to perform 
a cash-flow analysis of commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers. 
In performing these analyses, DOE used 
the financial values derived during 
Phase 1 and the shipment scenarios 
used in the NES analyses. 
c. Phase 3, Sub-Group Impact Analysis 

Using average cost assumptions to 

develop an industry-cash-flow estimate 
is not adequate for assessing differential 
impacts among sub-groups of 
manufacturers. For example, small 
manufacturers, niche equipment 
manufacturers, or manufacturers 
exhibiting a cost structure that largely 
differs from the industry average could 
be more negatively affected. DOE used 
the results of the industry 
characterization analysis (in Phase 1) to 
group manufacturers that exhibit similar 
characteristics. 

During the interview process, DOE 

discussed the potential sub-groups and 
sub-group members it identified for the 
analysis. DOE encouraged the 
manufacturers to recommend sub- 
groups or characteristics that are 
appropriate for the sub-group analysis. 
DOE identified small commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
as a potential manufacturing sub-group. 
DOE found that small business 
manufacturers generally have the same 
concerns as large manufacturers 
regarding energy conservation 
standards. In addition, DOE found no 
significant differences in the R&D 
emphasis or marketing strategies 
between small business manufacturers 
and large manufacturers. Therefore, for 
the equipment classes comprised 
primarily of small business 
manufacturers, DOE believes the GRIM 
analysis, which models each equipment 
class separately, is representative of the 
small business manufacturers affected 
by standards. 
2. Government Regulatory Impact Model 
Analysis 

As mentioned above, DOE uses the 

GRIM to quantify changes in cash flow 
that result in a higher or lower industry 
value. The GRIM analysis uses a 
standard annual cash-flow analysis that 
incorporates manufacturer prices, 
manufacturing costs, shipments, and 
industry financial information. The

GRIM models changes in costs, 
distribution of shipments, investments, 
and associated margins that would 
result from new regulatory conditions 
(in this case, standard levels). The GRIM 
spreadsheet uses a number of inputs to 
arrive at a series of annual cash flows, 
beginning with the base year of the 
analysis, 2007, and continuing to 2042. 
DOE calculated INPVs by summing the 
stream of annual discounted cash flows 
during this period. 

DOE used the GRIM to calculate cash 

flows using standard accounting 
principles and compare changes in 
INPV between a base case and different 
TSLs (the standards cases). Essentially, 
the difference in INPV between the base 
case and a standards case represents the 
financial impact of the energy 
conservation standards on 
manufacturers. DOE collected this 
information from a number of sources, 
including publicly available data and 
interviews with manufacturers (Chapter 
13 of the TSD). 
3. Manufacturer Interviews 

As part of the MIA, DOE discussed 

potential impacts of energy conservation 
standards with manufacturers 
responsible for a majority of commercial 
refrigeration equipment sales. The 
manufacturers interviewed manufacture 
close to 90 percent of the commercial 
refrigeration equipment on the market. 
These interviews were in addition to 
those DOE conducted as part of the 
engineering analysis. The interviews 
provided valuable information that DOE 
used to evaluate the impacts of energy 
conservation standards on 
manufacturers’ cash flows, 
manufacturing capacities, and 
employment levels. 
a. Key Issues 

Manufacturers identified the 

following key issues for DOE to consider 
in developing energy conservation 
standards: 

• Meeting Standards. Manufacturers 
expressed concern that they would have 
difficulty meeting certain efficiency 
levels for certain equipment classes. 
First, some manufacturers stated that 
they could not meet or would have 
extreme difficulty meeting any of the 
possible efficiency levels presented 
during interviews for self-contained 
equipment (e.g., horizontal open units). 
One manufacturer stated that due to the 
small number of parts in the self- 
contained equipment, efficiency 
improvements are constrained to these 
parts and are therefore limited. The 
same manufacturer stated that it already 
implements the most efficient options 
on the market that are available within 

its price range. For some manufacturers, 
self-contained equipment represents 
only a small portion of their business. 
These manufacturers make more remote 
condensing equipment and simply 
convert the design into self-contained 
units. Second, some manufacturers 
stated that they could not meet 
efficiency levels 3 and 4 for medium- 
temperature equipment (e.g., SOC.RC.M, 
VCT.RC.M, VOP.RC.M), and that they 
would need advances in technology to 
achieve these levels by 2012. One 
manufacturer stated that it does not 
manufacture any equipment in the 
VOP.RC.M equipment class that meets 
DOE’s baseline level. 
• Customer Needs. Manufacturers are 

concerned that increased equipment 
efficiency will come at the expense of 
equipment functionality, utility, and 
customizability. The commercial 
refrigeration equipment industry is 
focused on customers’ need to sell 
products, and customers place a higher 
priority on marketing and displaying 
their goods than they do on energy 
efficiency. Customers demand high 
levels of customization to differentiate 
themselves from other retail stores. 
They do not want to lose any 
functionality or utility in their 
equipment, such as display area, that 
affects their ability to sell products. 
Often, the desire of customers for easy 
product access requires equipment that 
is less energy efficient. They also do not 
want to lose any flexibility in design 
choices, such as lighting options. For 
example, some customers specify 
certain lighting configurations (e.g., 
color rendering, color temperature, light 
distribution) to maximize the sale of 
products such as fresh meat, produce, or 
dairy. Manufacturers believe that setting 
standards at the maximum level will 
affect their customers’ ability to 
merchandise products by limiting the 
flexibility to choose from among 
different designs, which they expect 
would commoditize the industry and 
lead to reduced profit margins. Having 
some allowance in the efficiency 
thresholds would allow tradeoffs in 
design selection that would ease the 
reconciliation of energy savings with the 
ability to sell products. 

• Customer Awareness. 

Manufacturers expressed concern that 
their retail customers are not 
sufficiently aware of pending energy 
conservation standards and the impacts 
these standards may have on their 
purchasing decisions. The supermarket 
industry is a low-margin industry, 
which places much emphasis on low- 
first-cost equipment. Manufacturers 
believe that many customers may not be 
able to handle an increase in equipment

price effectively since they operate with 
a fixed budget, or a fixed amount of 
capital available for purchasing 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
Manufacturers stated that customers 
with a fixed capital budget would tend 
to extend refurbishment periods and cut 
back on equipment growth to deal with 
the increase in price of higher efficiency 
equipment, which manufacturers say 
will reduce annual sales of commercial 
refrigeration equipment. Manufacturers 
expect that smaller stores and even 
small regional chains will feel 
significant financial pressure when 
faced with the increase in prices. Single 
family-owned stores and local stores in 
large cities may have no capital budget 
with which to replace existing cases 
with cases that are 30 percent to 50 
percent higher in price. Manufacturers 
stated that a reduction in sales would 
lead to employee layoffs since labor is 
proportional to units sold, not 
equipment price. Manufacturers also 
stated that customers have usually been 
unwilling to adopt energy efficiency 
improvements unless there is a 12- 
month payback period or less. 

• Equipment Classes. Manufacturers 

expressed concern regarding how 
equipment they manufacture would be 
categorized in DOE’s equipment classes. 
Manufacturers stated that certain pieces 
of low-volume equipment they 
manufacture do not easily fit into DOE’s 
equipment classes, and other pieces of 
equipment are excluded from coverage. 
For example, custom pieces of 
equipment, especially hybrid or 
combination units, do not easily fall 
within the DOE equipment classes since 
they could be classified in more than 
one category. A self-contained case with 
a service over counter upper portion 
and an open lower portion could be 
classified as a self-contained service 
over counter unit as well as a self- 
contained open unit. Another example 
is wedges—transition pieces placed at 
the corners of a case lineup. These do 
not have a reasonable TDA and 
therefore do not have meaningful energy 
consumption levels when normalized to 
TDA. Some manufacturers stated that 

low-volume equipment that cannot meet 
energy conservation standards may be 
discontinued because the cost to 
increase the efficiency will not be worth 
the benefit gained. Manufacturers also 
expressed concern regarding secondary 
coolant systems, which may provide a 
loophole. Manufacturers estimate that 
secondary coolant systems represent 
about 10 percent of the market currently 
and consume about five percent more 
energy than their direct expansion 
equivalent. Some manufacturers stated 
that customers might purchase these 
lower efficiency secondary coolant 
systems instead of the direct expansion 
equipment that are subject to standards. 
This concerns manufacturers since it 
would defeat the purpose of regulatory 
action. 

• Component Manufacturers. 

Manufacturers expressed concern that 
they have little control over the options 
available and the price they pay for 
components used to manufacture 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
Commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers purchase many of the 
components needed to build the 
equipment and therefore rely heavily on 
component manufacturers to deliver 
parts, such as doors, motors, fans, and 
lights. However, commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
state that higher efficiency components 
may not be readily available to meet 
standards. For example, the high- 
efficiency compressors needed for self- 
contained equipment to meet energy 
conservation standards may not be 
readily available. Manufacturers said 
that the compressors they purchase for 
commercial refrigeration are left over 
from the white goods (home appliances) 
industry since that industry has a much 
higher sales volume compared to 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
Also, manufacturers stated that 
component suppliers set their own 
pricing, and manufacturers have no 
control over this. Manufacturers are 
concerned about what prices they 
would have to pay for higher efficiency 
components in the future. 

4. Government Regulatory Impact Model 
Key Inputs and Scenarios 
a. Base Case Shipments Forecast 

The GRIM estimates manufacturer 

revenues based on total unit shipment 
forecasts and the distribution of these 
values by efficiency level. Changes in 
the efficiency mix at each standard level 
are a key driver of manufacturer 
finances. For this analysis, the GRIM 
used the NES shipments forecasts from 
2007 to 2042. Total shipments 
forecasted by the NES for the base case 
in 2012 are shown in Table IV–16 and 
further discussed in this section of 
today’s Notice.

In the shipments analysis, DOE also 

estimated the distribution of efficiencies 
in the base case for commercial 
refrigeration equipment (Chapter 10 of 
the TSD). Table IV–17 shows one 
example of the distribution of 
efficiencies in the base case for the 
VOP.RC.M equipment class. The 
distribution of efficiencies in the base 
case for other equipment classes are 
shown in Chapter 10 of the TSD.

* For VOP.RC.M, TSL 4 is set at the same efficiency level as TSL 3. Therefore, the shipment distribution is the same for both of these TSLs. 

b. Standards Case Shipments Forecast 

For each standards case, DOE 

assumed that shipments at efficiencies 

below the projected standard levels 
were most likely to roll up to those 
efficiency levels in response to an 

energy conservation standard. This 
scenario assumes that demand for high- 
efficiency equipment is a function of its

price without regard to the standard 
level. See Chapter 12 of the TSD for 
additional details. 
c. Markup Scenarios 

To understand how baseline and more 

efficient equipment are differentiated, 
DOE reviewed manufacturer catalogs 
and information gathered by 
manufacturers. To estimate the 
manufacturer price of the equipment 
sold, DOE applied markups to the 
production costs. For the analysis, DOE 
considered different markup scenarios, 
based on manufacturer input, for 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
Scenarios were used to bound the range 
of expected equipment prices following 
new energy conservation standards. For 
each equipment class, DOE used the 
markup scenarios that best 
characterized the prevailing markup 
conditions and described the range of 
market responses manufacturers expect 
as a result of new energy conservation 
standards. DOE learned from interviews 
with manufacturers that the majority of 
manufacturers only offer one equipment 
line. A single equipment line means that 
there is no markup used to differentiate 
baseline equipment from premium 
equipment. 

After discussions with manufacturers, 

DOE believes its adoption of standards 
for commercial refrigeration equipment 
would likely result in one of two 
distinct markup scenarios: Preservation- 
of-gross-margin-percentage or 
preservation-of-operating-profit. Under 
the preservation-of-gross-margin- 
percentage scenario, DOE applied a 
single uniform gross margin percentage 
markup across all efficiency levels. As 
production cost increases with 
efficiency, this scenario implies that the 
absolute dollar markup will increase. 
DOE assumed the non-production cost 
markup—which includes SG&A 
expenses, R&D expenses, interest, and 
profit—to be 1.32. Manufacturers 
believe it is optimistic to assume that as 
their production costs increase in 
response to an efficiency standard, they 
would be able to maintain the same 
gross margin percentage markup. 
Therefore, DOE assumes that this 
scenario represents a high bound to 
industry profitability under an energy 
conservation standard. 

Gross margin is defined as revenues 

less cost of goods sold. The implicit 
assumption behind this markup 
scenario is that the industry can 
maintain its gross margin from the 
baseline (in absolute dollars) after the 
standard. The industry would do so by 
passing through its increased 
production costs to customers without 
passing through its increased R&D and 

selling, general, and administrative 
expenses so the gross profit per unit is 
the same in absolute dollars. DOE 
implemented this scenario in the GRIM 
by setting the production cost markups 
for each TSL to yield approximately the 
same gross margin in the standards 
cases in the year standard are effective 
(2012) as is yielded in the base case. 
d. Equipment and Capital Conversion 
Costs 

New efficiency standards typically 

cause manufacturers to incur one-time 
conversion costs to bring their 
production facilities and equipment 
designs into compliance with the new 
regulation. For the purpose of the MIA, 
DOE classified these one-time 
conversion costs into three major 
groups. Capital conversion expenditures 
are one-time investments in property, 
plant, and equipment to adapt or change 
existing production facilities so that 
new equipment designs can be 
fabricated and assembled under the new 
regulation. Equipment conversion 
expenditures are one-time investments 
in research, development, testing, and 
marketing focused on creating 
equipment designs that comply with the 
new efficiency standard. Stranded assets 
are equipment or tooling that become 
obsolete as a result of new regulation. 

During the MIA interviews, DOE 

asked manufacturers for their estimates 
of the conversion costs they would 
incur due to new energy conservation 
standards. DOE then used the costs 
provided by each manufacturer and 
their respective market shares to 
develop estimates for the conversion 
costs of the entire industry at varying 
TSLs. Chapter 13 of the TSD 
summarizes these estimates. 
J. Utility Impact Analysis 

The utility impact analysis estimates 

the effects of reduced energy 
consumption due to improved 
equipment efficiency on the utility 
industry. This utility analysis consists 
of a comparison between forecast results 
for a case comparable to the AEO2007 
reference case and forecasts for policy 
cases incorporating each of the 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
TSLs. 

DOE analyzed the effects of proposed 

standards on electric utility industry 
generation capacity and fuel 
consumption using a variant of the 
EIA’s NEMS. NEMS, which is available 
on the DOE website, is a large, multi- 
sector, partial-equilibrium model of the 
U.S. energy sector. EIA uses NEMS to 
produce its AEO, a widely recognized 
baseline energy forecast for the United 
States. DOE used a variant known as 

NEMS–BT. The NEMS–BT is run 
similarly to the AEO2007 NEMS, except 
that commercial refrigeration equipment 
energy usage is reduced by the amount 
of energy (by fuel type) saved due to the 
TSLs. DOE obtained the inputs of 
national energy savings from the NES 
spreadsheet model. For the final rule, 
DOE intends to report utility analysis 
results using a version of NEMS–BT 
based on the AEO2008 NEMS. 

DOE conducted the utility analysis as 

policy deviations from the AEO2007, 
applying the same basic set of 
assumptions. In the utility analysis, 
DOE reported the changes in installed 
capacity and generation by fuel type 
that result for each TSL, as well as 
changes in end-use electricity sales. 
Chapter 14 of the TSD provides details 
of the utility analysis methods and 
results. 
K. Employment Impact Analysis 

Employment impact is one of the 

factors that DOE considers in selecting 
a standard. Employment impacts 
include direct and indirect impacts. 
Direct employment impacts are any 
changes in the number of employees for 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers, their suppliers, and 
related service firms. Indirect impacts 
are those changes of employment in the 
larger economy that occur due to the 
shift in expenditures and capital 
investment caused by the purchase and 
operation of more efficient commercial 
refrigeration equipment. The MIA in 
this rulemaking addresses only the 
direct employment impacts on 
manufacturers of commercial 
refrigeration equipment. Chapter 15 of 
the TSD describes other, primarily 
indirect, employment impacts. 

Indirect employment impacts from 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
standards consist of the net jobs created 
or eliminated in the national economy, 
other than in the manufacturing sector 
being regulated, as a consequence of (1) 
reduced spending by end users on 
electricity (offset to some degree by the 
increased spending on maintenance and 
repair); (2) reduced spending on new 
energy supply by the utility industry; (3) 
increased spending on the purchase 
price of new commercial refrigeration 
equipment; and (4) the effects of those 
three factors throughout the economy. 
DOE expects the net monetary savings 
from standards to be redirected to other 
forms of economic activity. DOE also 
expects these shifts in spending and 
economic activity to affect the demand 
for labor. 

In developing this proposed rule, DOE 
estimated indirect national employment 
impacts using an input/output model of

the U.S. economy, called ImSET (Impact 
of Sector Energy Technologies), 
developed by DOE’s Building 
Technologies Program. ImSET is a 
personal-computer-based, economic- 
analysis model that characterizes the 
interconnections among 188 sectors of 
the economy as national input/output 
structural matrices, using data from the 
U.S. Department of Commerce’s 1997 
Benchmark U.S. input-output table. The 
ImSET model estimates changes in 
employment, industry output, and wage 
income in the overall U.S. economy 
resulting from changes in expenditures 
in various sectors of the economy. DOE 
estimated changes in expenditures using 
the NES spreadsheet. ImSET then 
estimated the net national indirect 
employment impacts of potential 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
efficiency standards on employment by 
sector. In comments on the ANOPR, 
Zero Zone asked if DOE was going to 
contact second tier suppliers (e.g., door 
suppliers, fluorescent lighting suppliers, 
shaded pole motor suppliers) regarding 
employment impacts. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at pp. 230–231) ARI 
noted that this had been done in the 
central air conditioning rulemaking. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 231) 

DOE stated that the ImSET tool would 
not be able to address this in detail, but 
that it has been done within the MIA for 
other equipment. In the public meeting, 
DOE commented that there would be 
impacts from standards, but the 
effective date is different from the 
issuance date partly to allow time for 
adjustments in manufacturing. 

The ImSET input/output model 

suggests that the proposed commercial 
refrigeration equipment efficiency 
standards could increase the net 
demand for labor in the economy and 
the gains would most likely be very 
small relative to total national 
employment. DOE therefore concludes 
that the proposed commercial 
refrigeration equipment standards are 
only likely to produce employment 
benefits that are sufficient to fully offset 
any adverse impacts on employment in 
the commercial refrigeration equipment 
industry. For more details on the 
employment impact analysis, see 
Chapter 15 of the TSD. 
L. Environmental Assessment 

DOE has prepared a draft 

Environmental Assessment (EA) 
pursuant to the National Environmental 
Policy Act and the requirements of 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 
6316(e)(1)(A), to determine the 
environmental impacts of the proposed 
standards. Specifically, DOE estimated

the reduction in power plant emissions 
of CO2, NOX, and mercury (Hg) using 
the NEMS–BT computer model. 
However, the Environmental 
Assessment (Chapter 16 of the TSD) 
does not include the estimated 
reduction in power plant emissions of 
SO2 because, DOE has determined that 
due to the presence of national caps on 
SO2 emissions as addressed below, any 
such reduction resulting from an energy 
conservation standard would not affect 
the overall level of SO2 emissions in the 
United States. 

The NEMS–BT is run similarly to the 

AEO2007 NEMS, except that 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
energy use is reduced by the amount of 
energy saved (by fuel type) due to the 
TSLs. DOE obtained the inputs of 
national energy savings from the NES 
spreadsheet model. For the 
environmental analysis, the output is 
the forecasted physical emissions. The 
net benefit of the standard is the 
difference between emissions estimated 
by NEMS–BT and the AEO2007 
Reference Case. The NEMS–BT tracks 
CO2 emissions using a detailed module 
that provides results with broad 
coverage of all sectors and inclusion of 
interactive effects. For the final rule, 
DOE intends to revise the emissions 
analysis using the AEO2008 NEMS 
model using the process outlined above. 

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 

1990 set an emissions cap on SO2 for all 
power generation. The attainment of 
this target, however, is flexible among 
generators and is enforced through the 
use of emissions allowances and 
tradable permits. As a result, accurate 
simulation of SO2 trading tends to imply 
that the effect of energy conservation 
standards on physical emissions will be 
near zero because emissions will always 
be at, or near, the ceiling. Thus, it is 
unlikely that there will be an SO2 
environmental benefit from electricity 
savings as long as there is enforcement 
of the emissions ceilings. 

Although there may not be an actual 

reduction in SO2 emissions from 
electricity savings, there still may be an 
economic benefit from reduced demand 
for SO2 emission allowances. Electricity 
savings decrease the generation of SO2 
emissions from power production, 
which can decrease the need to 
purchase or generate SO2 emissions 
allowance credits, and decrease the 
costs of complying with regulatory caps 
on emissions. 

Like SO2, future emissions of NOX 

and Hg would have been subject to 
emissions caps under the Clean Air 
Interstate Act and Clean Air Mercury 
Rule. As discussed later, these rules 
have been vacated by a Federal court. 

DOE calculated a forecast of reductions 
for these emissions under an uncapped 
scenario. DOE assumes that the 
uncapped emissions reduction estimate 
would have corresponded generally to 
the generation of emissions allowance 
credits under an emissions cap scenario. 
V. Analytical Results 
A. Trial Standard Levels 

DOE selected between four and eight 

energy consumption levels for each 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
class in the LCC analysis. Based on the 
results of the LCC analysis, DOE 
selected five trial standard levels above 
the baseline level for each equipment 
class for the NOPR stage of the 
rulemaking. The range of TSLs selected 
includes the most energy efficient 
combination of design options with a 
positive NPV at the seven percent 
discount rate, and the combination of 
design options with the minimum LCC. 
Additionally, TSLs were selected that 
filled large gaps between the baseline 
and the level with the minimum LCC. 
Because of the size variation within 

each equipment class and the use of 
daily energy consumption as the 
efficiency metric, DOE presented a 
methodology to express efficiency 
standards in terms of a normalizing 
metric. This allows for a single energy 
conservation standard to be used for a 
broad range of equipment sizes within 
a given equipment class. DOE proposed 
the use of TDA as the normalizing 
metric for equipment with display 
capability. For equipment classes 
without display capability (e.g., 
equipment with solid doors), DOE 
proposed the use of internal volume as 
the normalizing metric. See Chapter 9 of 
the TSD for more detail. 

True commented that all self- 

contained units (including any open 
units) should be tested using volume as 
a normalizing factor to provide a 
straight comparison between open and 
closed-door self-contained units. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at pp. 202– 
207) DOE understands the usefulness of 
comparing self-contained equipment 
with and without doors on the basis of 
volume. However, the self-contained 
equipment covered in this rulemaking is 
frequently installed in supermarkets and 
convenience stores, where its primary 
purpose is to display and merchandise 
food. The most common application of 
remote condensing equipment is also in 
supermarkets and convenience stores. 
Therefore, DOE believes that, with 
respect to the purpose of equipment, the 
self-contained equipment covered in 
this rulemaking is more similar to 
remote condensing equipment than

analyzed. TSL 5 is the max-tech level 
for each equipment class. TSL 4 is the 
maximum efficiency level with a 
positive NPV at the seven percent 
discount rate, except for VOP.RC.M, 
where the minimal difference in energy 
efficiency between the minimum life- 
cycle cost level as determined by the 
LCC analysis and the maximum 
efficiency level with positive NPV 
prompted DOE to select the minimum 
life-cycle cost level in preference to the 
maximum level with positive NPV. TSL 
4 is a combination of the efficiency 
levels selected for TSL 3 and TSL 5. For 
a given equipment class, the efficiency 
levels selected for TSL 4 are either 
equivalent to that of TSL 3 or that of 
TSL 5. TSL 3 is the efficiency level that 
provides the minimum life-cycle cost as 
determined by the LCC analysis. TSL 2 
and TSL 1 represent lower efficiency 
levels that fill in the gap between the 
current baseline and the levels 
determined to have the minimum LCC. 
Table V–2 shows the same TSL levels 

in terms of proposed equations that 
establish a maximum daily energy 
consumption (MEC) limit through a 
linear equation of the form: 
MEC = A × TDA + B (for equipment 

using TDA as a normalizing metric) 
or 

MEC = A × V + B (for equipment using 
volume as a normalizing metric) 
Coefficients A and B are uniquely 

derived for each equipment class based 
on the calculated offset factor B (see 
Chapter 5 of the TSD for offset factors) 
and the equation slope A, which would 
be used to describe the efficiency 
requirements for equipment of different 
sizes within the same equipment class. 
Chapter 9 of the TSD explains the 
methodology DOE used for selecting 
trial standard levels and developing the 
coefficients shown in Table V–2. 
BILLING  CODE  6450–01–P 

noted that not all manufacturers make 
all case sizes. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 88) Later, in 
a written comment, Zero Zone 
recommended that DOE base its analysis 
on the smaller case models instead of 
the larger case models to avoid 
accidentally outlawing smaller cases. 
(Zero Zone, No. 17 at p. 3) ARI 
commented that it generally agrees with 
the approach proposed by DOE for 
characterizing energy conservation 
standards for commercial refrigeration 
equipment, and offered to work with 
DOE in developing appropriate offset 
factors. (ARI, No. 18 at p. 6) 

For the NOPR, DOE developed offset 

factors as a way to adjust the energy 
efficiency requirements for smaller- 
sized equipment in each equipment 
class analyzed. These offset factors 
account for certain components of the 
refrigeration load (such as the 
conduction end effects) that remain 
constant even when equipment sizes 
vary. These constant loads affect smaller 
cases disproportionately. The offset 
factors are intended to approximate 
these constant loads and provide a fixed 
end point, corresponding to a zero TDA 
or zero volume case, in an equation that 
describes the relationship between 
energy consumption and the 
corresponding TDA or volume metric. 
See Chapter 5 of the TSD for further 
details on the development of these 
offset factors for each equipment class. 
This is identified as Issue 4 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in Section VII.E of this NOPR. 
DOE preserved the general 

methodology and themes it used for the 
selection of efficiency levels in the 
ANOPR in establishing specific 
efficiency levels for equipment classes. 
These levels are based on the results of 
the updated LCC analysis and make up 
the TSLs used in the NOPR. Table V– 
1 shows the TSL levels DOE selected for 
energy use for the equipment classes 

other self-contained equipment (i.e., 
equipment with doors). DOE discussed 
this issue with manufacturers, and 
determined that TDA is the most 
appropriate normalization metric for the 
self-contained equipment covered in 
this rulemaking, since that is the metric 
used for remote condensing equipment. 
DOE expressed the ANOPR efficiency 

levels in terms of a normalized energy 
consumption using these normalization 
factors. DOE proposed equations for 
final standards that would have 
maximum energy consumption for 
equipment whose display area is 
directly proportional to TDA. DOE also 
suggested that for equipment 
normalized to volume, it might be 
necessary to develop equations that use 
offset factors to account for a potential 
non-linear variation of energy 
consumption with volume. At the 
ANOPR public meeting and during the 
comment period, stakeholders 
expressed concerns about the size of 
equipment DOE analyzed as the 
representative model for each 
equipment class. Zero Zone stated that 
its analysis indicates that using a two- 
door case as the baseline (for the 
VCT.RC.L class) is more reasonable 
because of the end effects in those cases. 
Zero Zone reported a 10 percent 
increase in energy consumption per 
door for a two-door case with the same 
design features as a five-door case. A 
two-door case consumes more energy 
per door than a five-door case because 
of the lighting and end effects. Zero 
Zone noted that if the standard is based 
on a five-door case, it will penalize any 
smaller cabinet, and could eliminate 
smaller cases from production due to 
their size. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 87) At the public meeting, 
Zero Zone stated that it would give 
some thought to what should be used 
for a representative model—a two-door 
case, or some combination of two-door 
and five-door cases. Zero Zone also

In addition to the 15 primary 

equipment classes analyzed, DOE 
intends to establish standards for the 
remaining 23 secondary equipment 
classes of commercial refrigeration 

equipment covered in this rulemaking 
that were not directly analyzed in the 
engineering analysis due to low annual 
shipments (less than 100 units per year). 
DOE’s approach involves extension 
multipliers developed using both the 15 

primary equipment classes analyzed 
and a set of focused matched-pair 
analyses. In addition, DOE believes that 
standards for certain primary equipment 
classes can be directly applied to other 
similar secondary equipment classes.

50111 

Chapter 5 of the TSD discusses the 
development of the extension 
multipliers and the set of focused 
matched-pair analyses. 

Using this approach, DOE developed 

an additional set of TSLs for these 
secondary equipment classes that 
corresponds to each of the equations 
shown in Table V–2 at each TSL. Table 

V–3 shows this additional set of 
corresponding TSL levels. The levels 
shown in Table V–3 do not necessarily 
reflect the minimum life-cycle cost or 
max-tech efficiency levels for these 
equipment classes, and do not reflect 
TSLs that DOE has analyzed in its 
impact analyses. The primary purpose 

of presenting these levels in this section 
is to provide interested persons with the 
range of efficiency standards that DOE 
is considering for these secondary 
equipment classes. This is identified as 
Issue 5 under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE 
Seeks Comment’’ in Section VII.E of this 
NOPR. 

1. Miscellaneous Equipment 

In the ANOPR, DOE proposed as part 

of its commercial refrigeration 
equipment test procedure that all 
equipment be tested at one of three 
rating temperatures: 38 °F for 
refrigerators, 0 °F for freezers, and ¥15 
°F for ice-cream freezers. Zero Zone, 
Hill Phoenix, Carrier/Tyler 
Refrigeration, and True expressed 
concern because they produce 
equipment that is not designed to 
operate at these designated rating 
temperatures. (Public Meeting 

Transcript, No. 13.5 at pp. 28–33) ARI 
stated that DOE should not require all 
equipment to be tested at these three 
rating temperatures alone. Doing so may 
require manufacturers to produce 
equipment that is less efficient solely for 
the purpose of meeting a specific rating 
condition, thus defeating the intent of 
the regulation. (ARI, No. 18 at p. 4) Hill 
Phoenix and True stated that the 
equipment they manufacture that is 
unable to meet these rating temperatures 
is only one percent to two percent of 
their shipments. Hill Phoenix added 

that, if possible, it would prefer to avoid 
the excessive paperwork of applying for 
waivers for equipment that cannot meet 
the three rating temperatures in the test 
procedure. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 13.5 at p. 33) 

Zero Zone recommended developing 

regulations that apply to the special 
circumstances of the rating temperature 
(Zero Zone, No. 17 at p. 2) and that DOE 
should consider developing additional 
rating temperatures. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 28) ACEEE 
suggested that DOE develop a method to 
interpolate the standard based on the

standards at the three official rating 
temperatures. (ACEEE, No. 16 at p. 2) 
ARI recommended that any equipment 
specifically designed to hold 
temperatures higher than the rating 
temperature should be tested at its 
application temperature, but must still 
meet the energy standard for its 
respective equipment class. (ARI, No. 18 
at p. 4) 

The DOE test procedure for 

commercial refrigeration equipment 
specifies three rating temperatures, 38 
°F, 0 °F, and ¥15 °F, that are required 
to be used in the testing of this 
equipment, each applied to designated 
equipment classes. 71 FR 71357. Since 
all of this equipment must be tested at 
one of these three rating temperatures, 
any manufacturer that is unable to test 
such equipment at its designated rating 
temperature, must request a test 
procedure waiver from DOE pursuant to 
the provisions described in 10 CFR 
431.401. If the equipment is unable to 
meet the maximum daily energy 
consumption (MDEC) limit for its 
designated equipment class, a 
manufacturer can petition DOE’s Office 
of Hearing and Appeals (OHA) for 
exception relief from the energy 
conservation standard pursuant to 
OHA’s authority under section 504 of 
the DOE Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 
7194), as implemented at subpart B of 
10 CFR part 1003. OHA grants such 
relief on a case-by-case basis if it 
determines that a manufacturer has 
demonstrated that meeting the standard 
would cause hardship, inequity, or 
unfair distributions of burdens. DOE 
believes that the majority of equipment 
covered by this rulemaking can be 
tested using the three specified rating 
temperatures (38 °F, 0 °F and ¥15 °F) 
provided in the test procedure. 

Certain types of equipment meet the 
definition of ‘‘commercial refrigeration 
equipment’’ (Section 136(a)(3) of EPACT 
2005), but do not fall directly into any 
of the 38 equipment classes defined in 
the market and technology assessment. 
One of these types is hybrid cases, 
where two or more compartments are in 
different equipment families and are 
contained in one cabinet. Another is 
refrigerator-freezers, which have two 
compartments in the same equipment 
family but with different operating 
temperatures. Hybrid refrigerator- 
freezers, where two or more 
compartments are in different 
equipment families and have different 
operating temperatures, may also exist. 
Another is wedge cases, which form 
miter transitions (a corner section 
between two refrigerated display 
merchandisers) between standard 
display case lineups. DOE is proposing 

language that will allow manufacturers 
to determine appropriate standard levels 
for these types of equipment. 

An example of a pure hybrid case 

(one with two or more compartments in 
different equipment families and at the 
same temperature) is a unit with one 
open and one closed medium- 
temperature compartment, such as those 
seen in coffee shops that merchandise 
baked goods and beverages. These 
hybrid cases may be either self- 
contained or remote condensing, and 
may be cooled by one or more 
condensing units. They may also have 
one evaporator cooling both 
compartments or one evaporator feeding 
each compartment separately. 

An example of a refrigerator-freezer is 

a unit with doors where one 
compartment operates at medium 
temperature and one compartment 
operates at low temperature. Remote 
condensing commercial refrigerator- 
freezers (with and without doors) and 
self-contained commercial refrigerator- 
freezers without doors may operate in 
one of two ways. First, they may operate 
as separate chilled and frozen 
compartments with evaporators fed by 
two sets of refrigerant lines or two 
compressors. Second, they may operate 
as separate chilled and frozen 
compartments fed by one set of low- 
temperature refrigerant lines (with 
evaporator pressure regulator (EPR) 
valves or similar devices used to raise 
the evaporator pressure) or one 
compressor. 

An example of a hybrid refrigerator- 

freezer is a unit with one open 
compartment at medium temperature 
and one closed compartment at low 
temperature. As with pure hybrid cases, 
these cases may be either self-contained 
or remote condensing, and may be 
cooled by one or more condensing units. 
In the case of remote condensing 
equipment, they may operate as separate 
chilled and frozen compartments with 
evaporators fed by two sets of refrigerant 
lines or two compressors. Or they may 
operate as separate chilled and frozen 
compartments fed by one set of low- 
temperature refrigerant lines (with EPR 
valves or similar devices used to raise 
the evaporator pressure of one 
compartment) or one compressor. 

During the ANOPR public meeting, 

stakeholders commented on how to 
handle these types of cases. True 
suggested that for self-contained 
refrigerator-freezer equipment, DOE 
should use a weighted average of the 
minimum standard requirements for the 
freezer and refrigerator. This is the 
present standard used in California and 
Canada, and [EPACT] 2005 for self- 
contained equipment with doors: 1.63 

times freezer volume plus the 
refrigerated volume gives you a number 
[adjusted volume]. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 215) Copeland 
followed up on the True comment on 
refrigerator-freezers, suggesting that a 
refrigerator-freezer standard for remote 
cases should be simple, and that they 
should be treated as if they have two 
separate compressors. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 13.5 at p. 215) Zero 
Zone stated that a manufacturer could 
build equipment with one or two 
separate suction lines. If it is built with 
one, measure the suction pressure for 
that one and base the EER on that 
suction pressure, without concern for 
what is happening upstream of the case. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 13.5 at 
p. 215) 

DOE has reviewed the comments and 
is proposing the following language for 
requiring manufacturers to meet 
standards for hybrid cases, refrigerator- 
freezers, and hybrid refrigerator/ 
freezers: 
• For commercial refrigeration 

equipment with two or more 
compartments (hybrid refrigerators, 
hybrid freezers, hybrid refrigerator- 
freezers, and non-hybrid refrigerator/ 
freezers), the MDEC for each model 
shall be the sum of the MDEC values for 
all of its compartments. For each 
compartment, measure the TDA or 
volume of that compartment, and 
determine the appropriate equipment 
class based on that compartment’s 
equipment family, condensing unit 
configuration, and designed operating 
temperature. The MDEC limit for each 
compartment shall be the calculated 
value obtained by entering that 
compartment’s TDA or volume into the 
standard equation in subsection (d)(1) 
for that compartment’s equipment class. 
Measure the calculated daily energy 
consumption (CDEC) or total daily 
energy consumption (TDEC) for the 
entire case as follows: 

Æ For remote condensing commercial 

hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, 
hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non- 
hybrid refrigerator-freezers, where two 
or more independent condensing units 
each separately cool only one 
compartment, measure the total 
refrigeration load of each compartment 
separately according to the ANSI/ 
ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. Calculate compressor energy 
consumption (CEC) for each 
compartment using Table 1 in ANSI/ 
ARI Standard 1200–2006 using the 
saturated evaporator temperature for 
that compartment. The calculated daily 
energy consumption (CDEC) for the 
entire case shall be the sum of the CEC 
for each compartment, fan energy

consumption (FEC), lighting energy 
consumption (LEC), anti-condensate 
energy consumption (AEC), defrost 
energy consumption (DEC), and 
condensate evaporator pan energy 
consumption (PEC) (as measured in 
ANSI/ARI Standard 1200–2006). 

Æ For remote condensing commercial 

hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, 
hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non- 
hybrid refrigerator-freezers, where two 
or more compartments are cooled 
collectively by one condensing unit, 
measure the total refrigeration load of 
the entire case according to the ANSI/ 
ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. Calculate a weighted 
saturated evaporator temperature for the 
entire case by (i) multiplying the 
saturated evaporator temperature of 
each compartment by the volume of that 
compartment (as measured in ANSI/ARI 
Standard 1200–2006), (ii) summing the 
resulting values for all compartments, 
and (iii) dividing the resulting total by 
the total volume of all compartments. 
Calculate the CEC for the entire case 
using Table 1 in ANSI/ARI Standard 
1200–2006, using the total refrigeration 
load and the weighted average saturated 
evaporator temperature. The CDEC for 
the entire case shall be the sum of the 
CEC, FEC, LEC, AEC, DEC, and PEC. 

Æ For self-contained commercial 
hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, 

hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non- 
hybrid refrigerator-freezers, measure the 
total daily energy consumption (TDEC) 
for the entire case according to the 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. 
• For remote-condensing and self- 
contained wedge cases, measure the 
CDEC or TDEC according to the ANSI/ 
ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. The MDEC for each model 
shall be the amount derived by 
incorporating into the standards 
equation in subsection (d)(1) for the 
appropriate equipment class a value for 
the TDA that is the product of (1) the 
vertical height of the air-curtain (or glass 
in a transparent door) and (2) the largest 
overall width of the case, when viewed 
from the front. This is identified as Issue 
6 under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in Section VII.E of this 
NOPR. 
B. Economic Justification and Energy 
Savings 
1. Economic Impacts on Commercial 
Customers 
a. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 
To evaluate the economic impact of 

the TSLs on customers, DOE conducted 
an LCC analysis for each level. More 
efficient commercial refrigeration 
equipment would affect customers in 
two ways: Annual operating expense 

would decrease and purchase price 
would increase. DOE analyzed the net 
effect by calculating the LCC. Inputs 
used for calculating the LCC include 
total installed costs (i.e., equipment 
price plus installation costs), annual 
energy savings, average electricity costs 
by customer, energy price trends, repair 
costs, maintenance costs, equipment 
lifetime, and discount rates. 

DOE’s LCC and PBP analyses 

provided five outputs for each TSL that 
are reported in Table V–4 through Table 
V–18. The first three outputs are the 
proportion of commercial refrigeration 
equipment purchases where the 
purchase of a standard-compliant piece 
of equipment would create a net LCC 
increase, no impact, or a net LCC 
savings for the customer. DOE used the 
estimated distribution of shipments by 
efficiency level for each equipment class 
to determine the affected customers. 
The fourth output is the average net LCC 
savings from standard-compliant 
equipment. The fifth output is the 
average PBP for the customer 
investment in standard-compliant 
equipment. The payback period is the 
number of years it would take for the 
customer to recover through energy 
savings the increased costs of higher 
efficiency equipment compared with the 
purchase of baseline efficiency 
equipment.

For three equipment classes 

(VOP.RC.M, SVO.RC.M, and SOC.RC.M) 
TSL 5 resulted in a negative LCC 
savings compared with the purchase of 
baseline equipment. For all other 
equipment classes, TSL 5 showed 
positive LCC savings. DOE noted that 
for equipment classes with lighting, the 
inclusion of LED lighting at TSL 5 had 
a significant impact on the calculated 
LCC savings. For equipment classes 
without lighting (i.e., VCS.SC.I, 
HZO.RC.L, HZO.SC.M, HZO.SC.L, 
HCT.SC.I), the LCC savings at TSL 5 was 
either identical to that of TSL 3, or less 
(between $17 and $38 over the life of 
the equipment). However, for 
equipment classes with lighting the 
difference in the LCC calculated 
between TSL 3 and TSL 5 varied from 
$23 for VCT.SC.I to $1785 for 
VOP.RC.M. When compared to TSL 3, 
the estimated reduction in LCC savings 
for TSL 5 was most pronounced for the 
three medium temperature equipment 
classes identified above as having 
negative LCC compared to the baseline 
(VOP.RC.M, SOC.RC.M, and 
SVO.RC.M), varying between $1276 and 
$1785 dollars. For three additional 
equipment classes (VOP.RC.L, 
SVO.SC.M, and VOP.SC.M), when 
compared to TSL 3, the difference in 
LCC was greater than $500. DOE noted 
that these are all medium temperature 
cases with the exception of VOP.RC.L, 
which is a small sales volume unit, 
similar in design to a medium 
temperature VOP.RC.M case. 

The inclusion of LED lighting systems 

result in an incremental increase in 
installed price. It also increases 
annualized lighting maintenance cost, 
since LED lights were assumed to be 
replaced after 50,000 hours or 5.7 years 
of steady operation. DOE performed two 
sensitivity analyses of the effect of 
projected cost reductions in LED 
lighting systems on LCC. These analyses 
involved five equipment classes: 
VOP.RC.M, VOP.SC.M, SVO.RC.M, 
SVO.SC.M, and SOC.RC.M. In the first 
sensitivity analysis, DOE determined 
the reduction in LED fixture cost, 
applied to the installed price in 2012, 
that would be necessary to reduce the

average LCC for TSL 5 to a level 
equivalent to the LCC savings at TSL 3, 
the maximum LCC level. DOE 
determined that for these five 
equipment classes, a LED cost reduction 
ranging from 37 percent to 44 percent, 
depending on equipment class, would 
provide an LCC at TSL 5 equivalent to 
that at TSL 3. 

In the second sensitivity analysis, 

DOE presumed that the cost for 
replacement LED fixtures in 2018 would 
be reduced by 50 percent of the cost 
assumed in the base LCC analysis, and 
then calculated the reduction in LED 
fixture cost necessary by 2012 to reduce 
the average LCC for TSL 5 to a level that 
provided equivalent LCC savings as TSL 
3. DOE determined that for these five 
equipment classes an LED cost 
reduction ranging from 29 percent to 40 
percent, depending on equipment class, 
would provide a LCC at TSL 5 
equivalent to that at TSL 3. 

Based on these analyses, DOE 

concluded that a reduction in LED 
fixture costs of approximately 45 
percent would be sufficient to result in 
the maximum LCC savings for all five 
equipment classes at TSL 5. DOE 
estimated that this reduction in LED 
fixture costs would also increase LCC 
savings for all other equipment classes 
with installed lighting at TSL 5. DOE 
estimates that for all equipment classes 
to achieve their maximum LCC savings 
at TSL 5, LED fixture costs must 
decrease by at least 45 percent. DOE 
concluded that a reduction in LED costs 
of less than 45 percent could result in 
only certain commercial refrigeration 
equipment classes achieving their 
maximum LCC savings at TSL 5. 
b. Rebuttable Presumption Payback 

As discussed above, EPCA provides a 

rebuttable presumption that an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified if the increased purchase cost 
for the equipment that meets the 
standard is less than three times the 
value of the first year energy savings 
resulting from the standard. DOE 
calculated a rebuttable presumption 
payback period for each TSL to 
determine if DOE could presume that a 

standard at that level is economically 
justified. Rather than using distributions 
for input values, DOE used discrete 
values and, as required by EPCA, based 
the calculation on the DOE commercial 
refrigeration equipment test procedure 
assumptions. As a result, DOE 
calculated a single rebuttable 
presumption payback value for each 
standard level, and not a distribution of 
payback periods. 

To evaluate the rebuttable 

presumption, DOE estimated the 
additional customer price of a more 
efficient, standard-compliant unit using 
the average customer markup, and 
compared this cost to the value of the 
energy saved during the first year of 
operation of the equipment as 
determined by ANSI/ARI Standard 
1200–2006. DOE interprets that the 
increased cost of purchasing a standard- 
compliant unit includes the cost of 
installing the equipment for use by the 
purchaser. DOE calculated the 
rebuttable presumption PBP, or the ratio 
of the value of the increased installed 
price above the baseline efficiency level 
to the first year’s energy cost savings. 
When this PBP is less than three years, 
the rebuttable presumption is satisfied; 
when this PBP is equal to or more than 
three years, the rebuttable presumption 
is not satisfied. 

Rebuttable presumption PBPs were 

calculated based on single-point 
national average values for installed 
costs and energy prices appropriate to 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
Equipment prices are based on a 
shipment-weighted average distribution 
markup for remote condensing 
equipment or self-contained equipment, 
as applied to the MSP for each 
equipment class. The installed cost is 
based on the national average 
equipment price and the national 
average installation cost for remote 
condensing or self-contained equipment 
as appropriate. Average first-year energy 
costs were calculated as the product of 
the annual energy consumption used in 
the LCC and the shipment-weighted 
national-average electricity price, which 
was calculated using the shipment 
weights for the four business types

using commercial refrigeration 
equipment. 

The equation for the rebuttable PBP 

is: 
PBP = DIC/DEC 
Where 
PBP = payback period in years, 
DIC = difference in the total installed cost 

between the more efficient standard level 
equipment (energy consumption levels 2, 
3, etc.) and the baseline (energy 
consumption level 1) equipment, and 

DEC = difference in annual energy costs. 
PBPs are expressed in years. PBPs 
greater than the life of the equipment 
means that the increased total installed 
cost of the more efficient equipment is 
not recovered in reduced operating costs 
for the more efficient equipment. The 
rebuttable presumption PBPs differ from 

the other PBPs calculated in the LCC 
analysis (see Section IV.E.12 of this 
NOPR) because they do not include 
maintenance or repair costs and they are 
based on single point values instead of 
distributions for installation costs or 
energy costs. The baseline efficiency 
level for the rebuttable presumption 
calculation is the baseline established in 
the engineering analysis. 

Table V–19 shows the nationally 

averaged rebuttable presumption 
paybacks calculated for all equipment 
classes and efficiency levels. The 
highest efficiency level with a rebuttable 
presumption payback of less than three 
years is also shown in Table V–19 for 
each equipment class. For eight 
equipment classes, the rebuttable 
presumption criteria were satisfied at all 

TSLs. At TSL 4, the rebuttable 
presumption criteria are satisfied for 13 
equipment classes. At TSL 3, the 
rebuttable presumption criteria are 
satisfied for 14 equipment classes. At 
TSL 2, the rebuttable presumption 
criteria were satisfied for all equipment 
classes. However, while DOE has 
examined the rebuttable presumption 
PBPs, DOE has not determined 
economic justification for any of the 
standard levels analyzed based on the 
ANOPR rebuttable presumption 
analysis. The economic justification for 
each TSL for each equipment class will 
take into account the more detailed 
analysis of the economic impacts of 
increased efficiency pursuant to Section 
325(o)(2)(B)(i) of EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 6316(e)(1)).

c. Life-Cycle Cost Sub-Group Analysis 

Using the LCC spreadsheet model, 

DOE estimated the impact of the TSLs 
on the following customer sub-group: 
small businesses. For the retail food 
sales business, the Small Business 
Association (SBA) defines as small 
businesses supermarkets and other 
grocery stores and convenience stores 
with less than $25 million in total 
annual sales. For specialty stores (e.g., 
meat markets, bakeries, fish and seafood 
markets), this limit is set at less than 
$6.5 million in annual sales. According 
to the Food Marketing Institute, the 
average supermarket had sales of 
approximately $15 million in 2006, so a 
small business could be represented by 
one to two average-size supermarkets or 
a chain of smaller grocery or 
convenience stores. The Food Marketing 
Institute defines independent stores as a 
retailer with one to ten stores, so most 
small supermarkets or grocery 

businesses as defined by SBA would be 
classified as independent grocery stores 
by the industry. A somewhat larger 
chain of convenience stores could still 
be classified as a small business. 

DOE estimated the LCC and PBP for 
small food sales businesses defined by 
SBA by presuming that most small 
business customers could be 
represented by the analysis performed 
for small grocery and convenience store 
owners. DOE assumed, however, that 
the smaller, independent grocery and 
convenience store chains may not have 
access to national accounts, but would 
instead purchase equipment primarily 
through distributors and grocery 
wholesalers. DOE modified the 
distribution channels for remote 
condensing and self-contained 
equipment to these small businesses as 
follows: 
• For remote condensing equipment, 
15 percent of the sales were assumed to 

pass through a manufacturer-to- 
distributor-to-contractor-to-customer 
channel, and 85 percent were assumed 
to be purchased through a 
manufacturer-to-distributor-to-customer 
channel. 

• For self-contained equipment, 35 
percent of sales were assumed to pass 
through a manufacturer-to-distributor- 
to-contractor-to-customer channel, and 
65 percent were assumed to be 
purchased through a manufacturer-to- 
distributor-to-customer channel. 

In both cases, the distribution chain 
markups were calculated accordingly. 
Table V–20 shows the mean LCC 
savings from proposed energy 
conservation standards for the small 
business sub-group, and Table V–21 
shows the mean payback period (in 
years) for this sub-group. More detailed 
discussion on the LCC sub-group 
analysis and results can be found in 
Chapter 12 of the TSD.

For commercial refrigeration 

equipment, the LCC and PBP impacts 
for small businesses are similar to those 
of all customers as a whole. While the 
discount rate for small grocery stores is 
higher than that for commercial 
refrigeration equipment customers as a 
whole and equipment prices are higher 
due to the higher markups, these small 
business customers appear to retain 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
over longer periods, and generally, 
smaller stores tend to pay higher 

electrical prices. The average LCC 
savings for the small business sub-group 
is slightly higher than that calculated for 
the average commercial refrigeration 
equipment customer, and the average 
PBP is slightly shorter than the national 
average. DOE tentatively concluded that 
the small food sales businesses as 
defined by SBA will not experience 
economic impacts significantly different 
or more negative than those impacts on 
food sales businesses as a whole. 

2. Economic Impacts on Manufacturers 

DOE performed an MIA to estimate 

the impact of amended energy 
conservation standards on commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
(Chapter 13 of the TSD). 
a. Industry Cash-Flow Analysis Results 

Table V–22 and Table V–23 show the 

MIA results for each TSL using both 
markup scenarios described above for 
commercial refrigeration equipment.24

equipment in the entire range of equipment classes 

(i.e., the MIA results in Table V–22 and Table V–

manufacturers of equipment from all equipment 
classes).

At TSL 1, the impact on INPV and 

cash flow varies greatly depending on 
the manufacturers and their ability to 
pass on MPC increases to the customer. 
DOE estimated the impacts in INPV at 
TSL 1 to range from approximately no 
impact to ¥$63 million, which is a 
change in INPV of zero percent to 
¥12.34 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow is $50.9 million, 
which is nearly the same as the base 
case value of $51.4 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. Since DOE 
estimates that more than 80 percent of 
the equipment being sold is already at 
or above this level, manufacturers that 
currently meet TSL 1 will not have to 
make additional modifications to their 

equipment lines to conform to the 
energy conservation standards. DOE 
expects the lower end of the impacts to 
be reached, because manufacturers will 
be able to fully recover the increase in 
manufacturer production cost from 
customers. Therefore, DOE expects that 
industry revenues and costs will not be 
significantly negatively affected at TSL 
1. 

At TSL 2, the impact on INPV and 

cash flow continues to vary depending 
on the manufacturers and their ability to 
pass on MPC increases to the customer. 
DOE estimated the impacts in INPV at 
TSL 2 to range from approximately $6 
million to ¥$88 million, which is a 
change in INPV of 1.22 percent to 

¥17.16 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow decreases by 
approximately 6 percent, to $48.2 
million, compared to the base case value 
of $51.4 million in the year leading up 
to the standards. DOE estimates that 
roughly 45 percent of the equipment 
being sold is already at or above this 
level. The required higher level of 
efficiency will cause some manufactures 
to modify their equipment lines to 
conform to the energy conservation 
standards. DOE does not expect 
industry revenues and costs to be 
affected significantly as long as 
manufacturers fully recover the increase 
in manufacturer production cost from 
customers. The positive INPV value is

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

explained by the assumption that MSP 
increases due to higher costs of the 
equipment, so that manufacturers fully 
recover and even surpass the 
investments needed to achieve this 
level. 

At TSL 3, DOE estimated the impacts 

in INPV to range from approximately 
¥$17 million to ¥$129 million, which 
is a change in INPV of ¥3.3 percent to 
¥25.2 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow decreases by 
approximately 45.5 percent, to $28 
million, compared to the base case value 
of $51.4 million in the year leading up 
to the standards. Based on information 
submitted by industry, the majority of 
manufacturers would require a complete 
redesign of their equipment, and 
therefore DOE expects that commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
will have some difficulty fully passing 
on larger MPC increases to customers. 
Manufacturers expect that the actual 
impacts will be closer to the higher end 
of the range of impacts (i.e., a drop of 
25.2 percent in INPV). 

At TSL 4, DOE estimated the impacts 
on INPV to range from ¥$40 million to 
¥$180 million, which is a change in 
INPV of approximately ¥7.76 percent to 
¥35.32 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow decreases by 
approximately 88.4 percent to $5.5 
million, compared to the base case value 
of $51.4 million in the year leading up 
to the standards. TSL 4 was created as 
a combination of TSL 3 (minimum LCC) 
and TSL 5 (max-tech). Manufacturers 
were not directly asked about this 
combination TSL during interviews. 
However, DOE estimated the range of 
impacts at TSL 4 based on the expected 
impacts manufacturers reported for TSL 

3 and TSL 5. Since manufacturers 
expect that the actual impacts will be 
closer to the higher range of impacts at 
TSL 3 and TSL 5, DOE expects that the 
actual impacts for TSL 4 will also be at 
the higher range (i.e., a drop of 35.32 
percent in INPV). 

At TSL 5 (max-tech), DOE estimated 

the impacts in INPV to range from ¥$18 
million to ¥$285 million, which is a 
change in INPV of approximately ¥3.49 
percent to ¥55.77 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow decreases by 
approximately 114 percent to ¥$7.2 
million, compared to the base case value 
of $51.4 million in the year leading up 
to the standards. At higher TSLs, 
manufacturers have more difficulty fully 
passing on larger MPC increases to 
customers, and therefore manufacturers 
expect that the actual impacts will be 
closer to the higher end of the range of 
impacts (i.e., a drop of 55.77 percent in 
INPV). Currently, there is only one 
model being manufactured at these 
efficiency levels for most equipment 
classes, and some equipment classes 
have no equipment at these levels. At 
TSL 5, DOE recognizes that there is a 
risk of very large negative impacts if 
manufacturers’ expectations are 
accurate about reduced profit margins. 
During the interviews, manufacturers 
expressed great concern at the 
possibility of requiring an entire 
equipment line to be manufactured at 
the max-tech levels. 
b. Cumulative Regulatory Burden 

While any one regulation may not 

impose a significant burden on 
manufacturers, the combined effects of 
several impending regulations may have 
serious consequences for some 

manufacturers, groups of manufacturers, 
or an entire industry. Assessing the 
impact of a single regulation may 
overlook this cumulative regulatory 
burden. 

In addition to the energy conservation 
regulations on commercial refrigeration 
equipment, several other Federal 
regulations and pending regulations 
apply to commercial refrigeration 
equipment and other equipment 
produced by the same manufacturers or 
parent companies. DOE recognizes that 
each regulation can significantly affect 
manufacturers’ financial operations. 
Multiple regulations affecting the same 
manufacturer can quickly strain 
manufacturers’ profits and possibly 
cause an exit from the market. An 
example of these additional regulations 
is the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-mandated phaseout of 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and 
the potential residential central air 
conditioners and heat pumps Federal 
energy conservation standard. Table V– 
24 provides the timetables for these 
mandatory or potential regulations. DOE 
believes that the cumulative burden of 
the HCFC phaseout is minimal because 
much of the commercial refrigeration 
equipment industry has already 
initiated the transition to HFC 
refrigerants. As shown in Section IV.B.3 
above, ARI stated that the data it 
provided to DOE was based on HFC 
refrigerants, and DOE therefore used 
HFC refrigerants in its analysis. DOE is 
aware of the industry’s transition to 
HFC refrigerants, but requests comment 
on any cumulative regulatory burdens 
from the combined effects of impending 
regulations that may affect 
manufacturers.

Production of foam insulation uses a 

blowing agent. The EPA strategy for 
meeting U.S. obligations under the 
Montreal Protocol requires the United 
States to phase out the production and 
use of HCFC blowing agents. HCFC–22 
and HCFC–142b will be phased out on 
January 1, 2010. This affects equipment 
manufacturing in the United States after 
this date and causes manufacturers to 
switch to other blowing agents with no 
ozone depletion potential. 

DOE recognizes that some parent 

companies of commercial refrigeration 
equipment manufacturers could also be 
affected by the potential energy 
conservation standards for central air 
conditioners and heat pumps and for 
room air conditioners. Additional 
investments necessary to meet these 
potential standards could have 
significant impacts on manufacturers of 
commercial refrigeration equipment. 
DOE seeks comment on the magnitude 
of impacts for cumulative regulatory 

burden on manufacturers for potential 
energy conservation standards for 
central air conditioners and heat pumps 
and for room air conditioners. 
c. Impacts on Employment 

DOE used the GRIM to assess the 

impacts of energy conservation 
standards on commercial refrigeration 
equipment employment. DOE used 
statistical data from the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s 2006 Annual Survey of 
Manufacturers, the results of the

engineering analysis, and interviews 
with manufacturers to estimate the 
inputs necessary to calculate industry- 
wide labor expenditures and 
employment levels. 

Currently the vast majority of 

commercial refrigeration equipment is 
manufactured in the U.S. Based on the 
GRIM results and interviews with 
manufacturers, DOE expects that there 
would be positive direct employment 
impacts among domestic commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
for TSL 1 through TSL 5. This 
conclusion ignores the possible 
relocation of domestic jobs to lower- 
labor-cost countries which may occur 
independently of new standards or may 
be influenced by the level of 
investments required by new standards. 
Because the labor impacts in the GRIM 
do not take relocation into account, the 
labor impacts would be different if 
manufacturers chose to relocate to lower 
cost countries. Manufactures stated that, 
although there are no current plans to 
relocate production facilities, at higher 
TSLs there would be increased pressure 
to cut costs, which could result in 
relocation. Chapter 13 of the TSD 
further discusses the employment 
impacts and exhibits the actual changes 
in employment levels by TSL. 

The conclusions in this section are 

independent of any conclusions 
regarding employment impacts from the 
broader U.S. economy estimated in the 
Employment Impact Analysis. These 
impacts are documented in Chapter 15 
of this TSD. 

d. Impacts on Manufacturing Capacity 

According to the majority of 

commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers, new energy conservation 
standards will not significantly affect 
manufacturers’ production capacity. 
Any necessary redesign of commercial 
refrigeration equipment will not change 
the fundamental assembly of the 
equipment. However, manufacturers 
anticipate some minor changes to 
tooling. Thus, DOE believes 
manufacturers will be able to maintain 
manufacturing capacity levels and 
continue to meet market demand under 
new energy conservation standards. 
e. Impacts on Sub-Groups of 
Manufacturers 

As discussed above, using average 

cost assumptions to develop an industry 
cash-flow estimate is not adequate for 
assessing differential impacts among 
sub-groups of manufacturers. Small 
manufacturers, niche equipment 
manufacturers, or manufacturers 
exhibiting a cost structure that differs 
largely from the industry average could 
be affected differently. DOE used the 
results of the industry characterization 
to group manufacturers exhibiting 
similar characteristics. 

DOE evaluated the impact of new 

energy conservation standards on small 
businesses, as defined by the SBA for 
the commercial refrigeration equipment 
industry, as manufacturing enterprises 
with 750 or fewer employees. DOE 
shared the interview guides with small 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers and tailored specific 

questions for them. During DOE’s 
interviews, small manufacturers 
suggested that the impacts of standards 
on them would not differ from impacts 
on larger companies within the industry 
(Chapter 13 of the TSD). 
3. National Impact Analysis 
a. Amount and Significance of Energy 
Savings 

To estimate the energy savings 
through 2042 due to new energy 
conservation standards, DOE compared 
the energy consumption of commercial 
refrigeration equipment under the base 
case to energy consumption of 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
under a new standard. The energy 
consumption calculated in the NIA is 
source energy, taking into account 
energy losses in the generation and 
transmission of electricity as discussed 
in Section IV.J. 

DOE tentatively determined the 

amount of energy savings at each of the 
5 TSLs being considered for the 15 
primary equipment class analyzed and 
aggregated the results. Table V–25 
shows the forecasted aggregate national 
energy savings for all 15 equipment 
classes at each TSL. The table also 
shows the magnitude of the estimated 
energy savings if the savings are 
discounted at seven percent and three 
percent. Each TSL considered in this 
rulemaking would result in significant 
energy savings, and the amount of 
savings increases with higher energy 
conservation standards (Chapter 11 of 
the TSD).

Each TSL analyzed results in additional 
energy savings, ranging from an 
estimated 0.141 quads to 1.208 quads 
for TSLs 1 through 5 (undiscounted). 
b. Net Present Value 

The net present value analysis is a 
measure of the cumulative benefit or 
cost of standards to the Nation. In 
accordance with the Office of 

Management and Budget (OMB)’s 
guidelines on regulatory analysis (OMB 
Circular A–4, Section E, September 17, 
2003), DOE calculated an estimated 
NPV using both a seven percent and a 
three percent real discount rate. The 
seven percent rate is an estimate of the 
average before-tax rate of return to 
private capital in the U.S. economy, and 
reflects the returns to real estate and 
small business capital as well as 

corporate capital. DOE used this 
discount rate to approximate the 
opportunity cost of capital in the private 
sector, since recent OMB analysis has 
found the average rate of return to 
capital to be near this rate. In addition, 
DOE used the three percent rate to 
capture the potential effects of standards 
on private consumption (e.g., through 
higher prices for equipment and 
purchase of reduced amounts of energy).

This rate represents the rate at which 
society discounts future consumption 
flows to their present value. This rate 
can be approximated by the real rate of 
return on long-term Government debt 
(e.g., the yield on Treasury notes minus 
the annual rate of change in the 
Consumer Price Index), which has 
averaged about three percent on a pre- 
tax basis for the last 30 years. 

Table V–27 shows the estimated 

cumulative NPV for commercial 
refrigeration equipment resulting from 
the sum of the NPV calculated for each 
of the 15 primary equipment classes 
analyzed. Table V–27 assumes the 
AEO2007 reference case forecast for 
electricity prices. At a seven percent 
discount rate, TSL 1–4 show positive 
cumulative NPVs. The highest NPV is 
provided by TSL 3 at $1.20 billion. TSL 
4 provided $1.10 billion, close to that of 
TSL 3. TSL 5 showed a negative NPV at 
¥$200 million, the result of negative 

NPV observed in five equipment classes 
(VOP.RC.M, VOP.SC.M, SVO.RC.M, 
SVO.SC.M, and SOC.RC.M). DOE 
determined through a sensitivity 
analysis that a 50 percent reduction in 
LED fixture costs, applied to equipment 
sold during the analysis period starting 
in 2012, would yield a NPV of $1.62 
billion for TSL 5.25 

At a three percent discount rate, all 
TSLs showed a positive NPV, with the 
highest NPV provided at TSL 3 (i.e., 
$3.25 billion). TSL 4 provided a near 
equivalent NPV at $3.24 billion. TSL 5 
provided a NPV of $1.16 billion dollars. 
Three equipment classes (VOP.RC.M, 
SVO.RC.M, and SOC.RC.M) were 
estimated to have negative NPVs at a 
three percent discount rate at TSL 5. 
DOE determined through a sensitivity 
analysis that a 50 percent reduction in 
LED fixture costs, applied to all 
equipment sold during the analysis 
period starting in 2012, would result in 

the greatest NPV at TSL 5 with $4.76 
billion. 

DOE also determined that a six 

percent reduction in LED system costs 
by 2012 would be sufficient to provide 
a positive NPV at TSL 5 in aggregate 
across all equipment classes at a seven 
percent discount rate. DOE recognizes 
that the aggregate six percent reduction 
in LED system costs could be attained 
by 2012 because of the rapid 
development of LED technology. In 
addition, DOE expects that a 50 percent 
reduction in LED system costs is 
possible in 2012, given the projections 
discussed previously, and considers a 
50 percent reduction likely to occur by 
2018 as examined in the LCC LED 
replacement cost sensitivity analysis. 

Table V–26 shows the estimated NPV 

results at TSL 5, for projected LED 
system cost reductions of six percent 
and 50 percent.

c. Impacts on Employment 

DOE develops general estimates of the 

indirect employment impacts of 
proposed standards on the economy. As 
discussed above, DOE expects energy 
conservation standards for commercial 
refrigeration equipment to reduce 
energy bills for commercial customers, 
and the resulting net savings to be 
redirected to other forms of economic 

activity. DOE also realizes that these 
shifts in spending and economic activity 
could affect the demand for labor. To 
estimate these effects, DOE used an 
input/output model of the U.S. economy 
using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
data (as described in Section IV.K; see 
Chapter 15 of the TSD for details). 

This input/output model suggests the 

proposed commercial refrigeration 
equipment energy conservation 

standards are likely to slightly increase 
the net demand for labor in the 
economy. Neither the BLS data nor the 
input/output model used by DOE 
includes the quality or wage level of the 
jobs. As shown in Table V–28, DOE 
estimates that net indirect employment 
impacts from a proposed commercial 
refrigeration equipment standard are 
likely to be very small. The net increase 
in jobs is so small that it would be 

25 DOE anticipates a reduction in installed cost of 
LED systems over time. The projected reduction in 

price for LED systems is provided and discussed in 

Sections V.C and IV.B.3.c of this NOPR and 
Appendix B of the TSD.

4. Impact on Utility or Performance of 
Equipment 

In performing the engineering 
analysis, DOE considered design 
options that would not lessen the utility 
or performance of the individual classes 
of equipment. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV) and 6316(e)(1)) As 
presented in the screening analysis 
(Chapter 4 of the TSD), DOE did not 
consider design options that reduce the 
utility of the equipment. Because no 
design options were considered that 
reduce utility, DOE tentatively 
concluded that none of the efficiency 
levels proposed for commercial 
refrigeration equipment reduce the 
utility or performance of the equipment. 
5. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 

EPCA directs DOE to consider any 

lessening of competition that is likely to 
result from standards. It directs the 
Attorney General to determine in 
writing the impact, if any, of any 
lessening of competition likely to result 
from a proposed standard. (42 U.S.C. 

6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and 6316(e)(1)) To 
assist the Attorney General in making 
such a determination, DOE has provided 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) with 
copies of this Notice and the TSD for 
review. During MIA interviews, 
domestic manufacturers indicated that 
foreign manufacturers have entered the 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
market over the past several years. 
Manufacturers also stated that while 
there has been significant consolidation 
with supermarket chains, little or no 
consolidation has occurred among 
commercial refrigeration manufacturers 
in recent years. DOE believes that these 
trends will continue to happen in this 
market regardless of the proposed 
standard level chosen. 
6. Need of the Nation to Conserve 
Energy 

An improvement in the energy 

efficiency of commercial refrigeration 
equipment is likely to improve the 
security of the Nation’s energy system 
by reducing overall demand for energy, 
and thus reduce the Nation’s reliance on 
foreign sources of energy. Reduced 

demand may also improve the reliability 
of the electricity system, particularly 
during peak-load periods. As a measure 
of this reduced demand, DOE expects 
the proposed standards (TSL 4) to 
prevent the need for the construction of 
new power plants totaling 
approximately 643 MW of electricity 
generation capacity in 2042. 

Enhanced energy efficiency also 

produces environmental benefits. The 
expected energy savings from higher 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
standards will reduce the emissions of 
air pollutants and greenhouse gases 
associated with energy production and 
fossil fuel usage. Table V–29 shows 
estimated cumulative CO2, NOX, and Hg 
emissions reductions for all the 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
classes over the forecast period. The 
expected energy savings from 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
standards will reduce the emissions of 
greenhouse gases associated with energy 
production, and it may reduce the cost 
of maintaining nationwide emissions 
standards and constraints.

equipment classes over the period from 
2012 to 2042. However, TSL 5 provides 
the greatest reduction of emissions of all 
the TSLs considered. In the 

environmental assessment (Chapter 16 
of the TSD), DOE reports estimated 
annual changes in CO2, NOX, and Hg 
emissions attributable to each TSL. As 
discussed in Section IV.L, DOE does not 
report SO2 emissions reduction from 
power plants because reductions from 
an energy conservation standard would 

not affect the overall level of SO2 
emissions in the United States due to 
the emissions caps for SO2.

that NOX would be subject to the Clean

50124 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

on March 10, 2005.26 70 FR 25162 (May 
12, 2005). On July 11, 2008, the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued 
its decision in North Carolina v. 
Environmental Protection Agency,27 in 
which the court vacated the CAIR. If left 
in place, the CAIR would have 
permanently capped emissions of NOX 
in 28 eastern States and the District of 
Columbia. As with the SO2 emissions 
cap, a cap on NOX emissions would 
have meant that equipment energy 
conservation standards are not likely to 
have a physical effect on NOX emissions 
in States covered by the CAIR caps. 
While the caps would have meant that 
physical emissions reductions in those 
States would not have resulted from the 
energy conservation standards we are 
proposing today, the standards might 
have produced an environmental- 
related economic impact in the form of 
lower prices for emissions allowance 
credits, if large enough. DOE notes that 
the estimated total reduction in NOX 
emissions, including projected 
emissions or corresponding allowance 
credits in States covered by the CAIR 
cap was between 0.004 and 0.034 
percent of the nationwide NOX 
emissions as a whole, percentages that 
DOE estimated were too small to affect 
allowance prices for NOX under the 
CAIR. 

Even though the D.C. Circuit vacated 

the CAIR, DOE notes that the D.C. 
Circuit left intact EPA’s 1998 NOX SIP 
Call rule, which capped seasonal 
(summer) NOX emissions from electric 
generating units and other sources in 23 
jurisdictions and gave those 
jurisdictions the option to participate in 
a cap and trade program for those 
emissions. See 63 Fed. Reg. 57356, 
57359 (Oct. 27, 1998).28 Accordingly, 

26 See http://www.epa.gov/cleanairinterstaterule/. 
27 Case No. 05–1244, 2008 WL 2698180 at *1 

(D.C. Cir. July 11, 2008). 

28 In the NOX SIP Call rule, EPA found that 

sources in the District of Columbia and 22 
‘‘upwind’’ states (States) were emitting NOX (an 
ozone precursor) at levels that significantly 
contributed to ‘‘downwind’’ states not attaining the 
ozone NAAQS or at levels that interfered with 
states in attainment maintaining the ozone NAAQS. 
In an effort to ensure that ‘‘downwind’’ states attain 
or continue to attain the ozone NAAQS, EPA 
established a region-wide cap for NOX emissions 
from certain large combustion sources and set a 
NOX emissions budget for each State. Unlike the 
cap that CAIR would have established, the NOX SIP 
Call Rule’s cap only constrains seasonal (summer 
time) emissions. In order to comply with the NOX 
SIP Call Rule, States could elect to participate in the 
NOX Budget Trading Program. Under the NOX 
Budget Trading Program, each emission source is 
required to have one allowance for each ton of NOX

DOE is considering whether changes are 
needed to its plan for addressing the 
issue of NOX reduction. DOE invites 
public comment on how the agency 
should address this issue, including 
how it might value NOX emissions for 
States now that the CAIR has been 
vacated.29 

With regard to mercury emissions, 

DOE is able to report an estimate of the 
physical quantity changes in mercury 
emissions associated with an energy 
conservation standard. Based on the 
NEMS–BT modeling, Hg emissions 
show a slight decrease in the period 
from 2012 to 2042. These changes in Hg 
emissions, as shown in Table V–29, are 
extremely small with a range of between 
0.02 and 0.14 percent of national base 
case emissions depending on TSL. 

The NEMS–BT model assumed that 
mercury emissions would be subject to 
EPA’s Clean Air Mercury Rule 30 
(CAMR), which would have 
permanently capped emissions of 
mercury for new and existing coal-fired 
plants in all States by 2010. Similar to 
SO2 and NOX, DOE assumed that under 
such a system, energy conservation 
standards would result in no physical 
effect on these emissions, but might 
result in an environmental-related 
economic benefit in the form of a lower 
price for emissions allowance credits, if 
large enough. DOE estimated that the 
change in Hg emissions from standards 
would not be large enough to influence 
allowance prices under CAMR. 

On February 8, 2008, the D.C. Circuit 

issued its decision in New Jersey v. 
Environmental Protection Agency,31 in 
which the Court, among other actions, 
vacated the CAMR referenced above. 
Accordingly, DOE is considering 
whether changes are needed to its plan 
for addressing the issue of mercury 
emissions in light of the D.C. Circuit’s 
decision. DOE invites public comment 

emitted during the ozone season. States have 
flexibility in how they allocate allowances through 
their State Implementation Plans but States must 
remain within the EPA-established budget. 
Emission sources are allowed to buy, sell and bank 
NOX allowances as appropriate. It should be noted 
that, on April 16, 2008, EPA determined that 
Georgia is no longer subject to the NOX SIP Call 
rule. 

29 In anticipation of CAIR replacing the NOX SIP 
Call Rule, many States adopted sunset provisions 
for their plans implementing the NOX SIP Call Rule. 
The impact of the NOX SIP Call Rule on NOX 
emissions will depend, in part, on whether these 
implementation plans are reinstated.

on addressing mercury emissions in this 
rulemaking. 

DOE is considering taking into 

account a monetary benefit of CO2 
emission reductions associated with this 
rulemaking. During the preparation of 
its most recent review of the state of 
climate science, the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
identified various estimates of the 
present value of reducing carbon- 
dioxide emissions by one ton over the 
life that these emissions would remain 
in the atmosphere. The estimates 
reviewed by the IPCC spanned a range 
of values. In the absence of a consensus 
on any single estimate of the monetary 
value of CO2 emissions, DOE used an 
estimate identified by the study cited in 
Summary for Policymakers prepared by 
Working Group II of the IPCC’s Fourth 
Assessment Report to estimate the 
potential monetary value of the CO2 
reductions likely to result from the 
standards under consideration in this 
rulemaking. 

The estimated year-by-year reductions 

in CO2 emissions were converted into 
monetary values ranging from the $0 
and $14 per ton. These monetary 
estimates were based on an assumption 
of no benefit to an average benefit value 
reported by the IPCC and the values 
include a range of discount factors used 
in their development.32 Based on DOE’s 
consideration of the IPCC report, DOE 
escalated the average benefit value per 
ton in real 2007$ at 2.4 percent per year. 
The resulting estimates of the potential 
range of benefits associated with the 
reduction of CO2 emissions are reflected 
in Table V–30. 

32 According to the IPCC, the mean social cost of 
carbon (SCC) reported in studies published in peer- 
reviewed journals was US$43 per ton of carbon. 
This translates into about $12 per ton of carbon 
dioxide. The social costs estimated represented the 
discounted present value of increasing (or 
decreasing) current emissions of carbon dioxide (or 
an equivalent greenhouse gas) by one ton. The 
literature review (Tol 2005) from which this mean 
was derived did not report the year in which these 
dollars are denominated. However, since the 
underlying studies spanned several years on either 
side of 2000, the estimate is often treated as year 
2000 dollars. Updating that estimate to 2007 dollars 
yields a SCC of $14 per ton of carbon dioxide. Tol 
concluded that when only peer-reviewed studies 
published in recognized journals are considered, 
‘‘* * * climate change impacts may be very 
uncertain but is unlikely that the marginal damage 
costs of carbon dioxide emissions exceed $50 per 
tonne carbon [about $14 per metric ton of CO2 or 
about $12.66 per short ton][emphasis added].’’ He 
also concluded that the costs may be substantially 
lower than $50 per tonne of C. Tol’s survey showed 
that 10 percent of the SCC estimates were actually 
negative, so that a lower bound of zero is not 
unreasonable.

DOE relied on the average of the IPCC 
reported estimate as an upper bound on 
the benefits resulting from reducing 
each metric ton of U.S. CO2 emissions. 
It is important to note that estimate of 
the $14 per ton of CO2 represents an 
average value of worldwide impacts 
from potential climate impacts caused 
by CO2 emissions, and is not confined 
to impacts likely to occur within the 
U.S. In contrast, most of the other 
estimates of costs and benefits of 
increasing the efficiency of commercial 
refrigeration equipment discussed in 
this proposal include only the economic 
values of impacts that would be 
experienced in the U.S. Consequently, 
as DOE considers a monetary value for 
CO2 emission reductions, the value 
might be restricted to a representation of 
those cost/benefits likely to be 
experienced in the United States. 
Currently, there are no estimated values 
for the U.S. benefits likely to result from 
CO2 emission reductions. However, 
DOE expects that, if such values were 
developed, DOE would use those U.S. 
benefit values, and not world benefit 
values, in its analysis. DOE further 
expects that, if such values were 
developed, they would be lower than 
comparable global values. DOE invites 
public comment on the above 
discussion of CO2. 

DOE also investigated the potential 

monetary impact resulting from the 
impact of today’s efficiency standards 
on SO2, NOX, and mercury (Hg) 
emissions. As previously stated, DOE’s 
analysis assumed the presence of 

nationwide emission caps on SO2 and 
caps on NOX emissions in the 28 states 
covered by the CAIR caps. In the 
presence of emission caps, DOE 
concluded that no physical reductions 
in total sector emissions would occur, 
however DOE’s estimates for reduction 
of these emissions could correspond to 
incremental changes in the prices of 
emissions allowances in cap-and-trade 
emissions markets rather than to 
physical emissions reductions. For SO2, 
the changes in annual emissions from 
today’s rule would be less than 0.03 
percent of the annual SO2 allowances, a 
change that DOE estimated is too small 
to influence allowance prices. Similarly, 
for NOX, in the 28 CAIR states, the 
emissions savings from today’s rule 
would be less than 0.018 percent of NOX 
allowances, also a change that DOE also 
estimated is too small to influence 
allowance prices. 

In DOE’s analysis, for 22 non-CAIR 

states, emissions of NOX from electricity 
generation were not controlled by a 
regulatory cap. By 2012, DOE projected 
that the NOX emissions in the non-CAIR 
states would be about 25 percent of the 
national total.33 Mercury emissions are 
also not controlled by a regulatory cap. 
For these two emissions, DOE estimated 
the national monetized benefits of 
emissions reductions from today’s rule 
based on environmental damage 
estimates from the literature. Non-CAIR 
emissions would not be controlled by an 
emissions cap so those emissions would 
actually be reduced by the PTAC-PTHP 
energy savings. Available estimates 

suggest a very wide range of monetary 
values for NOX emissions, ranging from 
$370 per ton to $3,800 per ton of NOX 
from stationary sources, measured in 
2001 dollars 34 or a range of $432 per ton 
to $4,441 per ton in 2007 dollars. The 
basic science linking mercury emissions 
from power plants to impacts on 
humans is considered highly uncertain. 
However, DOE located two estimates of 
the environmental damages of mercury 
based on two estimates of the adverse 
impact of childhood exposure to methyl 
mercury on IQ for American children, 
and subsequent loss of lifetime 
economic productivity resulting from 
these IQ losses. The high end estimate 
is based on an estimate of the current 
aggregate cost of the loss of IQ that 
results from exposure of American 
children of U.S. power plant origin of 
$1.3 billion per year in year 2000$, 
which works out to $32.6 million per 
ton emitted per year (2007$).35 The low- 
end estimate was $664,000 per ton 
emitted in 2004$ or $729,000 per ton in 
2007$), which DOE derived from a 
published evaluation of mercury control 
using different methods and 
assumptions from the first study, but 
also based on the present value of the 
lifetime earnings of children exposed.36 
The resulting estimates of the potential 
range of the present value benefits 
associated with the reduction of NOX in 
the 22 non-CAIR states and national 
reductions in Hg emissions are reflected 
in Table V.31 and Table V.32 

33 U.S. NOX emissions have been trending 

downward steadily since 1995, falling from 31.5 
million tons in 1995 to 15.2 million in 2006 (EIA 
2007). Although non-CAIR states’ emissions have 
also fallen, the emissions in the CAIR states have 
fallen more rapidly; thus, the CAIR states’ 
percentage of the total has also fallen from 87.4% 
in 1997 to 80.9% in 2006. For purposes of this 
analysis, DOE assumed that the CAIR states, 
percentage of emissions continues to decline until 
it reaches 75 percent in 2012. Seventy-five percent 
of emissions reductions are allocated to the CAIR 
states thereafter. Consequently non-CAIR state 

emissions would be about 25% of the total.

As discussed above, with the D.C. 

Circuit vacating the CAIR, DOE is 
considering how it should address the 
issue of NOX reduction and 
corresponding monetary valuation. DOE 
invites public comment on how the 
agency should address this issue, 
including how to value NOX emissions 
for States in the absence of the CAIR. 
7. Other Factors 

EPCA allows the Secretary of Energy, 

in determining whether a standard is 
economically justified, to consider any 
other factors that the Secretary deems to 
be relevant. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII) and 6316(e)(1)) 
Under this provision, DOE considered 
LCC impacts on identifiable groups of 
customers, such as customers of 
different business types, who may be 
disproportionately affected by any 
national energy conservation standard 

level. DOE also considered the 
reduction in generated capacity that 
could result from the imposition of any 
national energy conservation standard 
level. 
C. Proposed Standard 

EPCA specifies that any new or 

amended energy conservation standard 
for any type (or class) of covered 
equipment shall be designed to achieve 
the maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that the Secretary determines 
is technologically feasible and 
economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A) and 6316(e)(1)) In 
determining whether a standard is 
economically justified, the Secretary 
must determine whether the benefits of 
the standard exceed its burdens. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 6316(e)(1)) 
The new or amended standard must 
‘‘result in significant conservation of 

energy.’’ (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B) and 
6316(e)(1)) 

DOE considered the impacts of 

standards at each of five trial standard 
levels, beginning with the most efficient 
level (TSL 5) and worked down to a 
level where DOE determined the 
benefits of potential standards 
outweighed the burdens of potential 
standards. To aid the reader as DOE 
discusses the benefits and/or burdens of 
each TSL, Table V–33 presents a 
summary of quantitative analysis results 
for each TSL based on the assumptions 
and methodology discussed above. This 
table presents the results or, in some 
cases, a range of results, for each TSL. 
The range of values reported in this 
table for industry impacts represents the 
results for the different markup 
scenarios that DOE used to estimate 
manufacturer impacts.

† CO2 emissions  impacts  include  physical  reductions  at  power  plants.  NOX emissions  impacts  include  physical  reductions  at  power  plants  as 

well as production of emissions allowance credits where NOX emissions are subject to emissions caps. 

First, DOE considered TSL 5, the most 
efficient level for all equipment classes. 
TSL 5 would likely save an estimated 
1.208 quads of energy through 2042, an 
amount DOE considers significant. 
Discounted at seven percent, the 
projected energy savings through 2042 
would be 0.292 quads. For the Nation as 
a whole, DOE projects that TSL 5 would 
result in a net decrease of $200 million 
in NPV, using a discount rate of seven 
percent. Five equipment classes 
(VOP.RC.M, VOP.SC.M, SVO.RC.M, 
SVO.SC.M, and SOC.RC.M) show 
negative NPV at TSL 5. The emissions 
reductions at TSL 5 are 63.17 Mt of CO2 
and up to 23.47 kt of NOX. DOE also 
estimates that under TSL 5, total 
generating capacity in 2042 will 
decrease compared to the base case by 
0.934 gigawatts (GW). 

At TSL 5, DOE projects that the 
average commercial refrigeration 
equipment customer will experience a 
reduction in LCC compared to the 
baseline for 12 of the 15 equipment 
classes analyzed, while three equipment 
classes (VOP.RC.M, SVO.RC.M, 
SOC.RC.M) experienced an increase in 
LCC. These three equipment classes are 
among the five identified above that 
DOE showed had negative NPV. The 
two additional classes, SVO.SC.M and 
VOP.SC.M, had positive LCC savings at 
TSL 5, but at substantially reduced 
values compared to those shown at TSL 
4 or TSL 3. LCC savings for all 15 
equipment classes vary from negative 
(¥$673) to positive $3,818. At TSL 5, 
DOE estimates the fraction of customers 
experiencing LCC increases will vary 
between 0 and 71 percent depending on 
equipment class. The mean payback 
period for the average commercial 
refrigeration equipment customer at TSL 
5 compared to the baseline level is 
projected to be between 1.4 and 12.6 
years, depending on equipment class. 

At higher TSLs, manufacturers have a 

more difficult time fully passing on

larger increases in MPC to customers, 
and therefore manufacturers expect the 
higher end of the range of impacts to be 
reached at TSL 5 (i.e., a drop of 55.77 
percent in INPV). At TSL 5, there is the 
risk of very large negative impacts on 
the industry if manufacturers’ profit 
margins are reduced. Manufacturers 
expressed great concern at the 
possibility of having to manufacture an 
entire equipment line at the max-tech 
levels, because customers put a much 
higher priority on marketing and 
displaying their goods than they do on 
energy efficiency. For this reason, 
manufacturers fear that they will be 
unable to recover the additional cost 
incurred from producing the most 
efficient equipment possible. See 
Section IV.I for additional manufacturer 
concerns. 

After carefully considering the 

analysis and weighing the benefits and 
burdens of TSL 5, DOE tentatively 
concludes that the estimated benefits of 
energy savings and related benefits 
would not outweigh the potential $200 
million net economic cost to the Nation 
(at the seven percent discount rate), as 
well as the economic burden on 
consumers and the potential negative 
impact on manufacturers through 
reduction in INPV. 

As discussed above, DOE proposes to 
reject TSL 5 because DOE finds that the 
benefits to the Nation of TSL 5 (energy 
savings, commercial consumer average 
LCC savings, and emission reductions) 
do not outweigh the costs (national NPV 
decrease and loss of manufacturer 
INPV), and, therefore, DOE proposes 
that TSL 5 is not economically justified. 
This proposal reflects DOE’s tentative 
conclusion that there remains too much 
uncertainty regarding the timing and 
extent of anticipated reductions in LED 
costs to justify standards at the TSL 5 
level. While considerable information is 
available that suggests LED costs are 
likely to decline more than assumed in 

DOE’s analysis (see discussion in 
sections IV.B.3.c, V.B.1.a, and V.B.3.b), 
DOE believes that it must have a higher 
degree of confidence that the timing and 
extent of such further cost reductions 
will warrant higher standards before it 
imposes such requirements. DOE is 
soliciting public comments on these and 
other issues, and will reconsider this 
tentative conclusion during the 
development of its final rule. (See 
Section VII.E.1.) 

As mentioned above, if LED system 
costs achieve the 50 percent reduction 
projection by 2012, the estimated NPV 
at TSL 5 would be a positive $1.62 
billion at a seven percent discount rate 
and $4.76 billion at the three percent 
discount rate, and is likely to result in 
a net benefit. DOE requests comment on 
whether the benefits of TSL 5 would 
outweigh the burdens of TSL 5, 
considering the potential impacts of 
future LED cost projections. This is 
identified as Issue 7 under ‘‘Issues on 
Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ in Section 
VII.E of this NOPR. DOE also seeks 
comment on the extent to which 
stakeholders expect projected LED cost 
reductions would occur, the timing of 
the projected LED cost reductions, and 
the certainty of the projected LED cost 
reductions. Also, considering the rapid 
development of LED technology and the 
steady reductions in cost, DOE seeks 
comment on the extent to which 
manufacturers would adopt LED 
technology into the design of 
commercial refrigeration equipment in 
the absence of standards. 

DOE then considered TSL 4, which 
provides for all equipment classes the 
maximum efficiency levels that the 
analysis showed to have positive NPV to 
the Nation. TSL 4 would likely save an 
estimated 0.832 quads of energy through 
2042, an amount DOE considers 
significant. Discounted at seven percent, 
the projected energy savings through 
2042 would be 0.201 quads. For the

50128 

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

Nation as a whole, DOE projects that 
TSL 4 would result in a net increase of 
$1.10 billion in NPV, using a discount 
rate of seven percent. The estimated 
emissions reductions at TSL 4 are 43.50 
Mt of CO2 and up to 16.16 kt of NOX. 
Total generating capacity in 2042 is 
estimated to decrease compared to the 
base case by 0.643 GW under TSL 4. 

At TSL 4, DOE projects that the 
average commercial refrigeration 
equipment customer will experience a 
reduction in LCC compared to the 
baseline for all 15 equipment classes 
analyzed, ranging from $693 to $3,818 
depending on equipment class. The 
mean payback period for the average 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
customer at TSL 4 is projected to be 
between 1.4 and 6.1 years compared to 
the purchase of baseline equipment. 

As is the case with TSL 5, DOE 

believes the majority of manufacturers 
would need to completely redesign most 
equipment offered for sale, and 
therefore DOE expects that commercial 
refrigeration manufacturers will have 
some difficulty fully passing on larger 
MPC increases to customers. Similar to 
TSL 5, manufacturers expect the higher 
end of the range of impacts to be 
reached at TSL 4 (i.e., a drop of 35.3 
percent in INPV). However, compared to 
the baseline, all 15 equipment classes 
showed significant positive life-cycle 
cost savings on a national average basis 
and few customers experienced an 
increase in LCC with a standard at TSL 
4 compared with purchasing baseline 
equipment. The payback periods 
calculated for all equipment classes 
were lower than the life of the 
equipment. 

After carefully considering the 

analysis and weighing the benefits and 
burdens of TSL 4, DOE proposes that 
TSL 4 represents the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency that is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified and that the 
estimated benefits to the Nation 
outweigh the costs. DOE proposes that 
TSL 4 is technologically feasible 
because the technologies required to 
achieve these levels are already in 
existence. Therefore, DOE is proposing 
TSL 4 as the energy conservation 
standards for commercial refrigeration 
equipment in this NOPR. 

However, for the reasons discussed 

above, DOE also requests comments on 
whether it should adopt TSL 5 for all or 
some of the equipment classes.

VI. Procedural Issues and Regulatory 
Review 
A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 

DOE has determined that today’s 

regulatory action is an ‘‘economically 
significant’’ action under Section 3(f)(1) 
of Executive Order 12866, ‘‘Regulatory 
Planning and Review.’’ 58 FR 51735 
(October 4, 1993). The Executive Order 
requires that each agency identify in 
writing the specific market failure or 
other specific problem that it intends to 
address that warrants new agency 
action, as well as assess the significance 
of that problem to determine whether 
any new regulation is warranted. 
Executive Order 12866, § 1(b)(1). 

In the ANOPR for this rulemaking, 

DOE requested feedback and data on a 
number of issues related to Executive 
Order 12866 and the existence of a 
market failure in the commercial 
refrigeration equipment industry. This 
request included (1) Data on, and 
suggestions for testing the existence and 
extent of, potential market failures to 
complete an assessment in the proposed 
rule of the significance of any failures; 
(2) data on the efficiency levels of 
existing commercial refrigeration 
equipment in use by store type; (3) 
comment on the Federal ENERGYSTAR 
program and its penetration into the 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
market as a resource on the availability 
and benefits of energy efficient 
refrigeration units; (4) data on owner- 
occupied buildings versus leased/non- 
owner occupied buildings for given 
store types and their associated use of 
high-efficiency equipment; and (5) 
comment on the weight that should be 
given to these factors in DOE’s 
determination of the maximum 
efficiency level at which the total 
benefits are likely to exceed the total 
burdens resulting from a DOE standard. 
Following publication of the ANOPR 
and subsequent public comment period, 
DOE did not receive any feedback 
related to these requests. 

Much of the industry segment that 

uses commercial refrigeration 
equipment tends to be large grocery 
stores, multi-line retailers, small grocery 
stores, or convenience stores. DOE 
believes that these owners may lack 
corporate direction on energy policy. 
The transaction costs for these owners 
to research, purchase, and install 
optimum efficiency equipment options 
are too high to make such action 
commonplace. DOE believes that there 
is a lack of information about energy 
efficiency opportunities in the 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
market available to these owners. Unlike 
residential heating and air conditioning 

equipment, commercial refrigeration 
equipment is not included in energy 
labeling programs such as the Federal 
Trade Commission’s energy labeling 
program. Furthermore, the energy use of 
this equipment depends on usage. 
Information is not readily available for 
the owners to make a decision on 
whether improving the energy efficiency 
of commercial refrigeration equipment 
is cost-effective. DOE seeks data on the 
efficiency levels of existing commercial 
refrigeration equipment in use by 
owners, electricity price, and equipment 
class. Being part of the food 
merchandising industry, energy 
efficiency and energy cost savings are 
not the primary drivers of the business, 
as is selling food products to shoppers. 
This may incur transaction costs, thus 
preventing access to capital to finance 
energy efficiency investment. 

Today’s action also required a 

regulatory impact analysis (RIA) and, 
under the Executive Order, was subject 
to review by the Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the 
OMB. DOE presented to OIRA for 
review the draft proposed rule and other 
documents prepared for this 
rulemaking, including the RIA, and has 
included these documents in the

for public review in the Resource Room 
of the Building Technologies Program, 
950 L’Enfant Plaza, SW., 6th Floor, 
Washington, DC 20024, (202) 586–9127, 
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday 
through Friday, except Federal holidays. 

The RIA is contained in the TSD 

prepared for the rulemaking. The RIA 
consists of (1) a statement of the 
problem addressed by this regulation 
and the mandate for Government action; 
(2) a description and analysis of the 
feasible policy alternatives to this 
regulation; (3) a quantitative comparison 
of the impacts of the alternatives; and 
(4) the national economic impacts of the 
proposed standard. 

The RIA calculates the effects of 

feasible policy alternatives to 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
standards and provides a quantitative 
comparison of the impacts of the 
alternatives. DOE evaluated the 
alternatives in terms of their ability to 
achieve significant energy savings at 
reasonable cost, and compared it to the 
effectiveness of the proposed rule. DOE 
analyzed these alternatives using a 
series of regulatory scenarios as input to 
the NES/shipments model for 
commercial refrigeration equipment, 
which DOE modified to provide inputs 
for these voluntary measures. 

DOE identified the following major 

policy alternatives for achieving

DOE evaluated each alternative’s 
ability to achieve significant energy 
savings at reasonable cost (Table VI–1),

* Energy savings are in source quads. 
** Net present value is the value in the present of a time series of costs and savings. DOE determined the net present value from 2012 to 2062 

in billions of 2007$. 

† These are example values for TSL 3. 

The net present value amounts shown 

in Table VI–1 refer to the NPV for 
commercial customers. The following 
paragraphs discuss each policy 
alternative listed in Table VI–1. (See 
Chapter 17 of the TSD, Regulatory 
Impact Analysis, for further details.) 

No new regulatory action. The case in 
which no regulatory action is taken for 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
constitutes the base case (or No Action) 
scenario. By definition, no new 
regulatory action yields zero energy 
savings and a net present value of zero 
dollars. 

Commercial Customer Rebates. DOE 

modeled the impact of the customer 
rebate policy by determining the 
increased customer participation rate 
due to the rebates (i.e., the percent 
increase in customers purchasing high- 
efficiency equipment). DOE modeled a 
national rebate program after existing 
utility rebate programs that provide 
incentives for incorporating high- 
efficiency technologies into commercial 
refrigeration equipment. The reduction 
in retail cost of the higher efficiency 
cases was calculated and the 
methodology developed for the NIA 
used to assess relative shipments by 
efficiency level was used to assess 
relative shipments by efficiency level 
under the rebate scenario. DOE applied 
the resulting increase in market share of 
efficient units to the NES spreadsheet 
model to estimate the resulting NES and 
NPV for the rebate scenario with respect 
to the base case. 

Commercial Customer Tax Credits. 

DOE assumed a commercial or 
industrial customer Federal tax credit 
patterned after the tax credits created in 
EPACT 2005. EPACT 2005 provided tax 
credits to customers who purchase and 
install specific products such as energy 
efficient windows, insulation, doors, 
roofs, and heating and cooling 

equipment. DOE presumed the presence 
of a certification or other program that 
could be used to identify high-efficiency 
commercial refrigeration equipment by 
energy consumption, and assumed TSL 
3 as a likely candidate level for a tax 
credit incentive, given that it was the 
minimum LCC level. DOE then 
reviewed the incremental customer 
price increase to reach TSL 3 from the 
baseline for all 15 equipment classes. 
For 12 of the equipment classes, the 
incremental cost was between 6.1 and 
21.3 percent. For three equipment 
classes (SOC.RC.M, HZO.RC.M, 
HZO.RC.L), the incremental cost was 
less than five percent. In its tax credit 
analysis, DOE assumed a flat tax credit 
equal to five percent of the customer 
price for equipment sold at TSL 3 or 
higher for each primary equipment 
class, with the exception of SOC.RC.M, 
HZO.RC.M, and HZO.RC.L. DOE 
assumed a 100 percent application rate 
for the tax credit from commercial 
refrigeration equipment customers and 
reduced the retail equipment price by 
five percent for TSL 3, TSL 4, and TSL 
5 for the 12 equipment classes. The 
reductions in retail cost of commercial 
refrigeration equipment at these levels 
was calculated and the methodology 
developed for the NIA used to assess 
relative shipments by efficiency level 
under the tax credit scenario. DOE 
applied the resulting increase in market 
share of efficient units to the NES 
spreadsheet model to estimate the 
resulting NES and NPV for the tax credit 
scenario with respect to the base case. 
To see results for tax credits for 
equipment meeting or exceeding TSL 5, 
see the Regulatory Impact Analysis of 
the TSD. 

Performance Standards. Each of the 

non-regulatory alternatives must be 
gauged against the performance 

standards DOE is proposing in this 
proposed rule. DOE also considered, but 
did not analyze, the potential of bulk 
Government purchases and early 
replacement incentive programs as 
alternatives to the proposed standards. 
In the case of bulk Government 
purchases, commercial refrigeration 
equipment is a very small part of the 
total market and the volume of high- 
efficiency equipment purchases that the 
Federal Government might make would 
have very limited impact on improving 
the overall market efficiency of 
commercial refrigeration equipment. In 
the case of replacement incentives, 
several policy options exist to promote 
early replacement, including a direct 
national program of customer 
incentives, incentives paid to utilities to 
promote an early replacement program, 
market promotions through equipment 
manufacturers, and replacement of 
Federally owned equipment. Previous 
analysis by DOE of methods to promote 
early replacement for other covered 
equipment have suggested that the 
energy savings realized through a one- 
time early replacement of existing stock 
equipment has not resulted in energy 
savings commensurate to the cost to run 
and administer the program. As a 
consequence, DOE did not analyze this 
option in detail. 

As Table VI–1 indicates, none of the 
alternatives DOE examined would save 
as much energy as today’s proposed 
rule. Also, several of the alternatives 
would require new enabling legislation, 
since authority to carry out those 
alternatives does not exist. The tax 
credit scenario would also require the 
development of a database of 
commercial refrigeration equipment that 
would meet or exceed the TSL 3 
efficiency level in order to determine 
compliance with the tax credit.

Federal  Register / Vol.  73,  No.  165 / Monday,  August  25,  2008 / Proposed  Rules 

B. Review Under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act/Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 

U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires preparation 
of an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis (IRFA) for any rule that by law 
must be proposed for public comment, 
unless the agency certifies that the rule, 
if promulgated, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. As 
required by Executive Order 13272, 
‘‘Proper Consideration of Small Entities 
in Agency Rulemaking’’ 67 FR 53461 
(August 16, 2002), DOE published 
procedures and policies on February 19, 
2003, to ensure that the potential 
impacts of its rules on small entities are 
properly considered during the 
rulemaking process. 68 FR 7990. DOE 
has made its procedures and policies 
available on the Office of General 
Counsel’s Web site, http:// 
www.gc.doe.gov. 

Small businesses, as defined by the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) 
for the commercial refrigeration 
equipment manufacturing industry, are 
manufacturing enterprises with 750 
employees or fewer. DOE used the small 
business size standards published on 
January 31, 1996, as amended by the 
SBA to determine whether any small 
entities would be required to comply 
with the rule. 61 FR 3286 and codified 
at 13 CFR Part 121. The size standards 
are listed by North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) code and 
industry description. Commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturing 
is classified under NAICS 333415. 

Prior to issuing this notice of 

proposed rulemaking, DOE interviewed 
two small businesses affected by the 
rulemaking. DOE also obtained 
information about small business 
impacts while interviewing 
manufacturers that exceed the small 
business size threshold of 750 
employees. 

DOE reviewed ARI’s listing of its 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturer members and surveyed 
the industry to develop a list of all 
domestic manufacturers. DOE also 
asked stakeholders and ARI 
representatives within the industry if 
they were aware of any other small 
business manufacturers. DOE then 
examined publicly available data and 
contacted manufacturers, when needed, 
to determine if they meet the SBA’s 
definition of a small manufacturing 
facility and if their manufacturing 
facilities are located within the United 
States. Based on this analysis, DOE 
identified nine small manufacturers of 

commercial refrigeration equipment. 
DOE conducted on-site interviews with 
two small manufacturers who agreed to 
be interviewed to determine if there are 
differential impacts on these companies 
that may result from new energy 
conservation standards. 

DOE found that, in general, small 

manufacturers have the same concerns 
as large manufacturers regarding new 
energy conservation standards. DOE 
summarized the key issues for 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers in Section IV.I.3.a of 
today’s notice. Both manufacturers 
echoed the same concerns regarding 
new energy conservation standards as 
the larger manufacturers, including 
investments needed to meet standards, 
meeting customer needs, equipment 
sales, and coverage of niche equipment. 
Specifically, DOE found no significant 
differences in the R&D emphasis or 
marketing strategies between small 
business manufacturers and large 
manufacturers. Therefore, for the 
equipment classes manufactured 
primarily by the small businesses, DOE 
believes the GRIM analysis, which 
models each equipment class separately, 
is representative of the small businesses 
affected by standards. The qualitative 
and quantitative GRIM results are 
summarized in Section V.B.2 of today’s 
notice. 

DOE reviewed the standard levels 

considered in today’s notice of proposed 
rulemaking under the provisions of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act and the 
procedures and policies published on 
February 19, 2003. Based on this review, 
DOE has prepared an IRFA for this 
rulemaking. The IRFA describes 
potential impacts on small businesses 
associated with commercial 
refrigeration equipment design and 
manufacturing. 

The potential impacts on commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
are discussed in the following sections. 
DOE has transmitted a copy of this IRFA 
to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the 
Small Business Administration for 
review. 
1. Reasons for the Proposed Rule 

Part A–1 of Title III of EPCA 

addresses the energy efficiency of 
certain types of commercial and 
industrial equipment. (42 U.S.C. 6311– 
6317) EPACT 2005, Pub. L. 109–58, 
included an amendment to Part A–1 
requiring that DOE prescribe energy 
conservation standards for the 
commercial refrigeration equipment that 
is the subject of this rulemaking. 
(EPACT 2005, Section 136(c); 42 U.S.C. 
6313(c)(4)(A)) Hence, DOE is proposing 
in today’s notice, energy conservation 

standards for commercial ice-cream 
freezers; self-contained commercial 
refrigerators, commercial freezers, and 
commercial refrigerator-freezers without 
doors; and remote condensing 
commercial refrigerators, commercial 
freezers, and commercial refrigerator- 
freezers. 
2. Objectives of, and Legal Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule 

EPCA provides that any new or 
amended standard for commercial 
refrigeration equipment must be 
designed to achieve the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency that is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A) and 6316(e)(1)) But EPCA 
precludes DOE from adopting any 
standard that would not result in 
significant conservation of energy. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3) and 6316(e)(1)) 
Moreover, DOE may not prescribe a 
standard for certain equipment if no test 
procedure has been established for that 
equipment, or if DOE determines by rule 
that the standard is not technologically 
feasible or economically justified, and 
that such standard will not result in 
significant conservation of energy. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3) and 6316(e)(1)) EPCA 
also provides that, in deciding whether 
a standard is economically justified, 
DOE must determine whether the 
benefits of the standard exceed its 
burdens after receiving comments on 
the proposed standard. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 6316(e)(1)) To 
determine whether economic 
justification exists, DOE reviews 
comments received and conducts 
analysis to determine whether the 
economic benefits of the proposed 
standard exceed the burdens to the 
greatest extent practicable, taking into 
consideration seven factors set forth in 
42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B) and 6316(e)(1) 
(see Section II.B of this preamble). 

EPCA also states that the Secretary 

may not prescribe an amended or new 
standard if interested persons have 
established by a preponderance of the 
evidence that the standard is likely to 
result in the unavailability in the United 
States of any equipment type (or class) 
with performance characteristics 
(including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as those generally 
available in the United States. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(4) and 6316(e)(1)) Further 
information concerning the background 
of this rulemaking is provided in 
Chapter 1 of the TSD.

3. Description and Estimated Number of 
Small Entities Regulated 

DOE reviewed ARI’s listing of 

commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturer members and surveyed 
the industry to develop a list of every 
manufacturer. DOE also asked 
stakeholders and ARI representatives 
within the industry if they were aware 
of any other small business 
manufacturers. DOE then looked at 
publicly available data and contacted 
manufacturers, where needed, to 
determine if they meet the SBA’s 
definition of a small business 
manufacturing facility and have their 
manufacturing facilities located within 
the U.S. Based on this analysis, DOE 
estimates that there are nine small 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers. See Chapter 13 of the 
TSD for further discussion about the 
methodology used in DOE’s 
manufacturer impact analysis and its 
analysis of small-business impacts. 
4. Description and Estimate of 
Compliance Requirements 

Potential impacts on manufacturers, 
including small businesses, come from 
impacts associated with commercial 
refrigeration equipment design and 
manufacturing. The margins and/or 
market share of manufacturers, 
including small businesses, in the 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
industry could be negatively impacted 
in the long term by the standard levels 
under consideration in this notice of 
proposed rulemaking, specifically TSL 
4. The level of research and 
development needed to meet energy 
conservation standards increases with 
more stringent energy conservation 
standards. DOE expects that small 
manufacturers will have more difficulty 
funding the required research and 
development necessary to meet energy 
conservation standards than larger 
manufacturers. Therefore, at proposed 
TSL 4, as opposed to lower TSLs, small 
manufacturers would have less 
flexibility in choosing a design path. 
However, as discussed under subsection 
6 (Significant alternatives to the rule) 
below, DOE expects that the differential 
impact on small commercial 
refrigeration equipment manufacturers 
(versus large businesses) would be 
smaller in moving from proposed TSL 1 
to proposed TSL 2 than it would be in 
moving from proposed TSL 4 to 
proposed TSL 5. The rationale for DOE’s 
expectation is best discussed in a 
comparative context and is therefore 
elaborated upon in subsection 6 
(Significant alternatives to the rule). As 
discussed in the introduction to this

IRFA, DOE expects that the differential 
impact associated with commercial 
refrigeration equipment design and 
manufacturing on small businesses 
would be negligible. 
5. Duplication, Overlap, and Conflict 
With Other Rules and Regulations 
DOE is not aware of any rules or 

regulations that duplicate, overlap, or 
conflict with the rule being considered 
today. 
6. Significant Alternatives to the Rule 

The primary alternatives to the 

proposed rule considered by DOE are 
the other TSLs besides the one being 
considered today, proposed TSL 4. In 
addition to the other TSLs considered, 
the TSD associated with this proposed 
rule includes a report referred to in 
Section VI.A in the preamble as the 
regulatory impact analysis (RIA- 
discussed earlier in this report and in 
detail in the TSD). This report discusses 
the following policy alternatives: (1) No 
new regulatory action, (2) commercial 
customer rebates, and (3) commercial 
customer tax credits. The energy savings 
of these regulatory alternatives are one 
to two orders of magnitude smaller than 
those expected from the standard levels 
under consideration. The range of 
economic impacts of these regulatory 
alternatives is an order of magnitude 
smaller than the range of impacts 
expected from the standard levels under 
consideration. 

The commercial refrigeration 

equipment industry is highly 
customized. Customers demand high 
levels of customization from 
commercial refrigeration equipment 
manufacturers to differentiate 
themselves from other retail stores. 
They do not want to lose any 
functionality or utility in their 
equipment, such as display area, 
because this affects their ability to 
merchandise products. Often, the 
customer’s desire for easy consumer 
access requires equipment that is less 
energy efficient. They also do not want 
to lose any flexibility in design choices, 
such as lighting options. All 
manufacturers, including small 
businesses, would have to develop 
designs to enable compliance to higher 
TSLs. Product redesign costs tend to be 
fixed and do not scale with sales 
volume. Thus, small manufacturers 
would be at a relative disadvantage at 
higher TSLs because research and 
development efforts would be on the 
same scale as those for larger 
companies, but these expenses would be 
recouped over smaller sales volumes. 

At proposed TSL 5, the max-tech 

level, manufacturers stated their 

concerns over the ability to be able to 
produce equipment by the future 
effective date of the standard. At 
proposed TSL 5, DOE estimates that the 
majority of manufacturers would be 
negatively impacted. Based on 
manufacturer interviews, some 
manufacturers stated that they could not 
meet proposed TSL 5 for medium- 
temperature equipment, and that they 
would need technological innovation to 
achieve these levels by 2012. 
Manufacturers believe that setting 
standards at the maximum level will 
affect their customers’ ability to 
merchandise products by limiting the 
flexibility in choosing design options. 
For example, at TSL 5 specifically, the 
use of LED lighting technology may be 
necessary to meet the proposed levels 
for many equipment classes. 
Manufacturers expect that having 
limited choices in design options would 
commoditize the industry and reduce 
profit margins. This concern was echoed 
by all manufacturers, not just small 
business manufacturers. 

For the proposed standard, TSL 4, and 

for alternative TSLs, TSL 1 through 3, 
DOE expects that impacts to small 
manufacturers would be less than the 
impacts described above for TSL 5. At 
lower TSLs, the differential impacts to 
small manufacturers are diminished 
because research and development 
efforts are less at lower TSLs. Chapter 
12 of the TSD contains additional 
information about the impact of this 
rulemaking on manufacturers. As 
mentioned above, the other policy 
alternatives (no new regulatory action, 
commercial customer rebates, and 
commercial customer tax credits) are 
described in Section VI.A of the 
preamble and in the Regulatory Impact 
Analysis, Chapter 17 of the TSD. Since 
the impacts of these policy alternatives 
are lower than the impacts described 
above for TSL 5, DOE expects that the 
impacts to small manufacturers would 
also be less than the impacts described 
above for the proposed standard levels. 
DOE requests comment on the impacts 
to small business manufacturers for 
these and any other possible alternatives 
to the proposed rule. DOE will consider 
any comments received regarding 
impacts to small business manufacturers 
for all the alternatives identified, 
including those in the RIA, for the Final 
Rule.

D. Review Under the National

DOE is preparing an environmental

proposed rule. DOE is preparing an 
environmental assessment of the 
impacts of the proposed rule. The 
assessment will include an examination 
of the potential effects of emission 
reductions likely to result from the rule 
in the context of global climate change 
as well as other types of environmental 
impacts. DOE anticipates completing a 
Finding of No Significant Impact 
(FONSI) before publishing the final rule 
on commercial refrigeration equipment, 
pursuant to the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.), the regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 
1500–1508), and DOE’s regulations for 
compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act (10 CFR Part 
1021). 
E. Review Under Executive Order 13132 

Executive Order 13132, Federalism, 
64 FR 43255 (August 4, 1999) imposes 
certain requirements on agencies 
formulating and implementing policies 
or regulations that preempt State law or 
that have federalism implications. The 
Executive Order requires agencies to 
examine the constitutional and statutory 
authority supporting any action that 
would limit the policymaking discretion 
of the States and carefully assess the 
necessity for such actions. The 
Executive Order also requires agencies 
to have an accountable process to 
ensure meaningful and timely input by 
State and local officials in the 
development of regulatory policies that 
have federalism implications. On March 
14, 2000, DOE published a statement of 
policy describing the intergovernmental 
consultation process it will follow in the 
development of such regulations. 65 FR 
13735. DOE has examined today’s 
proposed rule and has determined that 
it would not have a substantial direct 
effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the National Government and 
the States, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. EPCA 
governs and prescribes Federal 
preemption of State regulations as to 
energy conservation for the equipment 
that is the subject of today’s proposed 
rule. States can petition DOE for 
exemption from such preemption to the 
extent, and based on criteria, set forth in 
EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6297(d) and 
6316(b)(2(D)) No further action is 
required by Executive Order 13132.

F. Review Under Executive Order 12988 
With respect to the review of existing 

regulations and the promulgation of 
new regulations, section 3(a) of 
Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice 
Reform (61 FR 4729, February 7, 1996) 
imposes on Federal agencies the general 
duty to adhere to the following 
requirements: (1) Eliminate drafting 
errors and ambiguity; (2) write 
regulations to minimize litigation; and 
(3) provide a clear legal standard for 
affected conduct rather than a general 
standard and promote simplification 
and burden reduction. Section 3(b) of 
Executive Order 12988 specifically 
requires that Executive agencies make 
every reasonable effort to ensure that the 
regulation (1) clearly specifies the 
preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly 
specifies any effect on existing Federal 
law or regulation; (3) provides a clear 
legal standard for affected conduct 
while promoting simplification and 
burden reduction; (4) specifies the 
retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately 
defines key terms; and (6) addresses 
other important issues affecting clarity 
and general draftsmanship under any 
guidelines issued by the Attorney 
General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 
12988 requires Executive agencies to 
review regulations in light of applicable 
standards in Section 3(a) and Section 
3(b) to determine whether they are met 
or it is unreasonable to meet one or 
more of them. DOE has completed the 
required review and determined that, to 
the extent permitted by law, this 
proposed rule meets the relevant 
standards of Executive Order 12988. 
G. Review Under the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 

DOE reviewed this regulatory action 

under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4) 
(UMRA), which requires each Federal 
agency to assess the effects of Federal 
regulatory actions on State, local and 
Tribal governments and the private 
sector. Today’s final rule may impose 
expenditures of $100 million or more on 
the private sector. It does not contain a 
Federal intergovernmental mandate. 

Section 202 of UMRA authorizes an 

agency to respond to the content 
requirements of UMRA in any other 
statement or analysis that accompanies 
the proposed rule. 2 U.S.C. 1532(c). The 
content requirements of section 202(b) 
of UMRA relevant to a private sector 
mandate substantially overlap the 
economic analysis requirements that 
apply under section 325(o) of EPCA and 
Executive Order 12866. The 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of 
the notice of final rulemaking and the 

‘‘Regulatory Impact Analysis’’ section of 
the TSD for this final rule respond to 
those requirements. 

Under section 205 of UMRA, the 

Department is obligated to identify and 
consider a reasonable number of 
regulatory alternatives before 
promulgating a rule for which a written 
statement under section 202 is required. 
DOE is required to select from those 
alternatives the most cost-effective and 
least burdensome alternative that 
achieves the objectives of the rule 
unless DOE publishes an explanation 
for doing otherwise or the selection of 
such an alternative is inconsistent with 
law. As required by sections 325(o), 
345(a) and 342(c)(4)(A) of EPCA (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o), 6316(a) and 
6313(c)(4)(A)), today’s proposed rule 
would establish energy conservation 
standards for commercial refrigeration 
equipment that are designed to achieve 
the maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that DOE has determined to 
be both technologically feasible and 
economically justified. A full discussion 
of the alternatives considered by DOE is 
presented in the ‘‘Regulatory Impact 
Analysis’’ section of the TSD for today’s 
final rule. 
H. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 1999 

Section 654 of the Treasury and 

General Government Appropriations 
Act, 1999 (Pub. L. 105–277) requires 
Federal agencies to issue a Family 
Policymaking Assessment for any rule 
that may affect family well-being. This 
rule would not have any impact on the 
autonomy or integrity of the family as 
an institution. Accordingly, DOE has 
concluded that it is not necessary to 
prepare a Family Policymaking 
Assessment. 
I. Review Under Executive Order 12630 
DOE has determined, under Executive 
Order 12630, Governmental Actions and 
Interference with Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights, 53 FR 8859 
(March 18, 1988), that this regulation 
would not result in any takings that 
might require compensation under the 
Fifth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. 
J. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2001 

The Treasury and General 

Government Appropriations Act, 2001 
(44 U.S.C. 3516 note) provides for 
agencies to review most disseminations 
of information to the public under 
guidelines established by each agency 
pursuant to general guidelines issued by

OMB. The OMB’s guidelines were 
published at 67 FR 8452 (February 22, 
2002), and DOE’s guidelines were 
published at 67 FR 62446 (October 7, 
2002). DOE has reviewed today’s Notice 
under the OMB and DOE guidelines and 
has concluded that it is consistent with 
applicable policies in those guidelines. 
K. Review Under Executive Order 13211 

Executive Order 13211, Actions 

Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use, 66 FR 28355 (May 
22, 2001) requires Federal agencies to 
prepare and submit to the OIRA, OMB, 
a Statement of Energy Effects for any 
proposed significant energy action. A 
significant energy action is defined as 
any action by an agency that 
promulgated or is expected to lead to 
promulgation of a final rule, and that (1) 
is a significant regulatory action under 
Executive Order 12866, or any successor 
order; and (2) is likely to have a 
significant adverse effect on the supply, 
distribution, or use of energy, or (3) is 
designated by the Administrator of 
OIRA as a significant energy action. For 
any proposed significant energy action, 
the agency must give a detailed 
statement of any adverse effects on 
energy supply, distribution, or use 
should the proposal be implemented, 
and of reasonable alternatives to the 
action and their expected benefits on 
energy supply, distribution, and use. 

Today’s regulatory action would not 
have a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy 
and, therefore, is not a significant 
energy action. Accordingly, DOE has not 
prepared a Statement of Energy Effects. 
L. Review Under the Information 
Quality Bulletin for Peer Review 

On December 16, 2004, the OMB, in 
consultation with the Office of Science 
and Technology (OSTP), issued its Final 
Information Quality Bulletin for Peer 
Review (Bulletin). 70 FR 2664 (January 
14, 2005). The Bulletin establishes that 
certain scientific information shall be 
peer reviewed by qualified specialists 
before it is disseminated by the Federal 
Government, including influential 
scientific information related to agency 
regulatory actions. The purpose of the 
bulletin is to enhance the quality and 
credibility of the Government’s 
scientific information. Under the 
Bulletin, the energy conservation 
standards rulemaking analyses are 
‘‘influential scientific information.’’ The 
Bulletin defines ‘‘influential scientific 
information’’ as ‘‘scientific information 
the agency reasonably can determine 
will have, or does have, a clear and 
substantial impact on important public

policies or private sector decisions.’’ 70 
FR 2667 (January 14, 2005). 

In response to OMB’s Bulletin, DOE 

conducted formal, in-progress peer 
reviews of the energy conservation 
standards development process and 
analyses and has prepared a Peer 
Review Report pertaining to the energy 
conservation standards rulemaking 
analyses. The Energy Conservation 
Standards Rulemaking Peer Review 
Report dated February 2007 has been 
disseminated and is available at http:// 
www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/

the author. Absent an electronic 
signature, comments submitted 
electronically must be followed and 
authenticated by submitting a signed 
original paper document. No 
telefacsimiles (faxes) will be accepted. 

Under 10 CFR 1004.11, any person 
submitting information that he or she 
believes to be confidential and exempt 
by law from public disclosure should 
submit two copies: One copy of the 
document including all the information 
believed to be confidential, and one 
copy of the document with the 
information believed to be confidential 
deleted. DOE will make its own 
determination about the confidential 
status of the information and treat it 
according to its determination. 

Factors of interest to DOE when 

evaluating requests to treat submitted 
information as confidential include (1) a 
description of the items; (2) whether 
and why such items are customarily 
treated as confidential within the 
industry; (3) whether the information is 
generally known by, or available from, 
other sources; (4) whether the 
information has previously been made 
available to others without obligation 
concerning its confidentiality; (5) an 
explanation of the competitive injury to 
the submitting person which would 
result from public disclosure; (6) when 
such information might lose its 
confidential character due to the 
passage of time; and (7) why disclosure 
of the information would be contrary to 
the public interest. 
E. Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment 

DOE is particularly interested in 
receiving comments and views of 
interested parties concerning: 

1. LED Price Projections 

TSL 5 has an estimated ¥$200 

million burden on the Nation. DOE 
recognizes that anticipated reductions 
in LED lighting costs by the effective 
date of the rule could shift the NPV, at 
the seven percent discount rate, for TSL 
5 from a negative NPV (¥$200 million) 
to a positive NPV. DOE calculated that 
a reduction in LED system cost of six 
percent would be sufficient to ensure a 
slightly positive aggregate NPV at TSL 5, 
at the seven percent discount rate, when 
compared with the base case. DOE fully 
expects that the aggregate six percent 
reduction in LED system costs could be 
attained and even exceeded by 2012 
because of the rapid development of 
LED technology. Furthermore, if LED 
system costs achieve the 50 percent 
reduction projection, the NPV at a seven 
percent discount rate for TSL 5 would 
be substantially positive. DOE requests 
data or information on projected LED 
cost reductions and basis for such 
projections. DOE also seeks comment on 
its consideration of projected LED 
prices. DOE also seeks comment on the 
extent to which stakeholders expect 
projected LED cost reductions would 
occur, the timing of the projected LED 
cost reductions, and the certainty of the 
projected LED cost reductions. Also, 
considering the rapid development of 
LED technology and the steady 
reductions in cost, DOE seeks comment 
on the extent to which manufacturers 
would adopt LED technology into the 
design of commercial refrigeration 
equipment in the absence of standards. 
DOE recognizes that LED system 
replacement costs assumed in its LCC 
analysis would also be affected by 
projected LED cost reductions and seeks 
comment on how it can best predict the 
cost for LED fixture replacements in the 
LCC analysis. (See Section V.C of this 
NOPR for further details.) 
2. Base Case Efficiency 

DOE recognizes that baseline 
efficiency trends can change if 
equipment costs are different than those 
projected. For example, if LED prices 
drop more than assumed in the 
engineering analysis, consumer demand 
for LED-equipped equipment could 
change. DOE seeks comment on whether 
shipments of LED-equipped equipment 
would change if LED costs drop and if 
so, the extent and timing of such 
shipment changes. See Section IV.G.1. 
3. Operating Temperature Ranges 

One factor in determining which 

equipment class a commercial 
refrigeration equipment unit belongs to 
is its designed operating temperature. 

DOE is organizing equipment classes 
based on three operating temperature 
ranges. Medium temperature equipment 
operates at or above 32 °F, low 
temperature equipment operates at 
temperatures below 32 °F and greater 
than 5 °F, and ice-cream temperature 
equipment operates at or below ¥15 °F. 
DOE seeks comment on the 
temperatures selected to categorize 
equipment classes. (See Section IV.A.2 
of this NOPR for further details.) 
4. Offset Factors 

For the NOPR, DOE developed offset 

factors as a way to adjust the energy 
efficiency requirements for smaller- 
sized equipment in each equipment 
class analyzed. These offset factors 
account for certain components of the 
refrigeration load (such as the 
conduction end effects) that remain 
constant even when equipment sizes 
vary. These constant loads affect smaller 
cases disproportionately. The offset 
factors are intended to approximate 
these constant loads and provide a fixed 
end point, corresponding to a zero TDA 
or zero volume case, in an equation that 
describes the relationship between 
energy consumption and the 
corresponding TDA or volume metric. 
DOE seeks comment on the use of offset 
factors and the methodology used to 
calculate them. (See Section V.A of this 
NOPR and Chapter 5 of the TSD for 
further details.) 
5. Extension of Standards 

DOE developed an extension 

approach to applying the standards 
developed for these 15 primary 
equipment classes to the remaining 23 
secondary classes. This approach 
involves extension multipliers 
developed using both the 15 primary 
equipment classes analyzed and a set of 
focused matched-pair analyses. DOE 
believes that standards for certain 
primary equipment classes can be 
directly applied to other similar 
secondary equipment classes. DOE 
seeks comment on its approach to 
extending the results of the engineering 
analysis to the 23 secondary equipment 
classes. (See Section V.A of this NOPR 
and Chapter 5 of the TSD for further 
details.) 
6. Standards for Hybrid Cases and 
Wedges 

There are certain types of equipment 
that meet the definition of commercial 
refrigeration equipment (Section 
136(a)(3) of EPACT 2005), but do not 
fall easily into any of the 38 equipment 
classes defined in the market and 
technology assessment. One of these 
types is hybrid cases, where two or

more compartments are in different 
equipment families and contained in 
one cabinet. Another is refrigerator- 
freezers, which have two compartments 
in the same equipment family but with 
different operating temperatures. There 
may also exist hybrid refrigerator- 
freezers, where two or more 
compartments are in different 
equipment families and have different 
operating temperatures. Another is 
wedge cases, which form miter 
transitions between standard display 
case lineups. DOE seeks comment on 
proposed language that will allow 
manufacturers to determine appropriate 
standard levels for these types of 
equipment. (See Section 0 of this NOPR 
for further details.) 
7. Standard Levels 

If, based on comment, DOE were to 

revise the LED system costs as described 
above (section V.C) the economic 
impacts of TSL 5 would change. DOE 
seeks comments on its consideration of 
TSL 5 and whether the benefits would 
outweigh the burdens.

50137 

(iii) For self-contained commercial 
hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, 
hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non- 
hybrid refrigerator-freezers, measure the 
total daily energy consumption (TDEC) 
for the entire case according to the 
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. 

(3) For remote-condensing and self- 

contained wedge cases, measure the 
CDEC or TDEC according to the ANSI/ 
ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. The MDEC for each model 
shall be the amount derived by 
incorporating into the standards 
equation in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section for the appropriate equipment 
class a value for the TDA that is the 
product of (i) the vertical height of the 
air-curtain (or glass in a transparent 
door) and (ii) the largest overall width 
of the case, when viewed from the front.

BILLING  CODE  6450–01–P 

or more independent condensing units 
each separately cool only one 
compartment, measure the total 
refrigeration load of each compartment 
separately according to the ANSI/ 
ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. Calculate compressor energy 
consumption (CEC) for each 
compartment using Table 1 in ANSI/ 
ARI Standard 1200–2006 using the 
evaporator temperature for that 
compartment. The calculated daily 
energy consumption (CDEC) for the 
entire case shall be the sum of the CEC 
for each compartment, fan energy 
consumption (FEC), lighting energy 
consumption (LEC), anti-condensate 
energy consumption (AEC), defrost 
energy consumption (DEC), and 
condensate evaporator pan energy 
consumption (PEC) (as measured in 
ANSI/ARI Standard 1200–2006). 

(ii) For remote condensing 

commercial hybrid refrigerators, hybrid 

freezers, hybrid refrigerator-freezers, 
and non-hybrid refrigerator-freezers, 
where two or more compartments are 
cooled collectively by one condensing 
unit, measure the total refrigeration load 
of the entire case according to the ANSI/ 
ASHRAE Standard 72–2005 test 
procedure. Calculated a weighted 
saturated evaporator temperature for the 
entire case by (A) multiplying the 
saturated evaporator temperature of 
each compartment by the volume of that 
compartment (as measured in ANSI/ARI 
Standard 1200–2006), (B) summing the 
resulting values for all compartments, 
and (C) dividing the resulting total by 
the total volume of all compartments. 
Calculate the CEC for the entire case 
using Table 1 in ANSI/ARI Standard 
1200–2006, using the total refrigeration 
load and the weighted average saturated 
evaporator temperature. The CDEC for 
the entire case shall be the sum of the 
CEC, FEC, LEC, AEC, DEC, and PEC.
