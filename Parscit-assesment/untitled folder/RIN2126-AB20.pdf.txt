EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This  Regulatory  Impact Analysis  (RIA)  or regulatory evaluation provides  an assessment 

of the costs  and benefits  of requiring motor carriers  to use electronic on-board recorders 

(EOBRs) 

to 

track  driving  and  duty 

time.  The  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety 

Administration  (FMCSA  or  the  Agency)  is  issuing  a  Notice  of Proposed  Rulemaking 

(NPRM)  that  this  RIA  accompanies  to  improve  compliance  with  the  Hours  of Service 

(HOS)  regulations  for  (49  CFR  Part  395)  commercial  motor  vehicle  (CMV)  drivers. 

EOBRs  track driving time and other activities  electronically,  providing largely the  same 

information currently collected on paper records of duty status (RODS). 

A Final Rule on EOBRs for HOS  compliance (EOBR I)  was  published on April 5,  2010, 

75  FR  17207,1  providing  the  technical  requirements  for  EOBRs  and  mandating  their 

installation and use for a period of two  years on all power units of carriers with recurrent 

HOS  compliance problems, those found  in a compliance review to  have  a  10 percent or 

greater violation rate (pattern violation) for any regulation in Appendix C to 49 CFR Part 

385  ("IXlO  Remedial  Directive  Carriers,,).2  FMCSA  determined  that  an  approach 

designed to  target only HOS  violators  would (1) be most likely to  improve the safety of 

the  motoring  public  on  the highways  in  the  near  term,  and  (2)  effectively  utilize  motor 

carrier and Federal and State enforcement resources. 

FMCSA proposes to expand the requirement for EOBR use to  a larger number of motor 

carriers  and to require these devices to be permanently installed and utilized for tracking 

of drivers'  HOS.  This  RIA examines  three options  for  the broader EOBR mandate  that 

differ  solely on the  number of carriers,  drivers,  and  power units  affected.  Whereas  the 

lXlO  Remedial  Directive  targeted  a  relatively  small  number  of carriers,  approximately 

5,700  firms  with  139,000  CMVs,  this  second  EOBR  rule  could  potentially  affect  the 

entire  motor  carrier  industry  subject  to  the  HOS  rules,  about  500,000  carriers  with  4 

million  CMV s.  The  Agency  proposes  to  implement  the  rule  three  years  after  the 

1  Final Rule, "Electronic On-Board Recorders for Hours-of-Service Compliance," Fed. Reg. 49, No. 64 
(April 5, 2010):  17207-17252.

publication  of  a  final  rule;  this  accounts  for  the  time  needed  for  EOBR  vendors  to 

produce adequate numbers of the devices. 

The  Agency  gathered  cost  information from  publicly available  marketing  materials  and 

contact  with  EOBR  vendors.  The  analysis  for  EOBR  I  focused  on  the  least  expensive 
device  determined  to  be  compliant  with  the  rule. 3  The  Agency  has  chosen  to  base  its 
calculations on a higher cost device in this RIA.  The manufacturer of the devices used as 

the  basis  for  the  EOBR  I  is  relatively  small,  and,  although  the  Agency  believed  that  a 

sufficient number of units  for  lxlO remedial directive carriers  would be available at this 

price  from  this  vendor  or  its  competitors,  it  did  not  find  evidence  indicating  that  a 

sufficient number of-the Agency estimates  that  about  2 million will  be needed-these 

least  cost  units  are  available  for  a  broad  industry  mandate.  The  Agency  also  has  not 

found  any compelling evidence or  economic  arguments  that  market  forces  would  cause 

EOBR device prices to fall.  The performance standards for EOBRs require manufacturers 

to  use  mature,  off-the-shelf  technology  currently  implemented  in  fleet  management 

systems  (FMS)  already  sold  in  a  large,  competitive  market.  EOBR  functionality  will 

likely be added to these devices.  The Agency is receptive to comments on its analysis of 

the EOBR and FMS market. 

FMCSA uses  a higher cost device such as  the one discussed in Appendix B (Alternative 

Estimates  of  EOBR  Device  Costs)  of the  EOBR  I  RIA.4  Although  the  manufacturer 

produces  more expensive devices  than the one evaluated in the EOBR I RIA,  the higher 

costs  of its  products  reflects  additional  functions  and  features  unrelated  to  the  EOBR 

HOS  tracking  feature.  The  Agency  believes  the  unit  considered  in  this  analysis 

represents  a reasonable upper limit for costs.  After amortizing purchase and repair costs 

over time  and  evaluating  monthly  operational  costs,  the  per-unit device  costs  would  be 

slightly higher than those presented in the EOBR I RIA, but the Agency still believes that 

these costs are not overly burdensome to motor carriers.  The Agency has found the range 

3  The least expensive device that satisfies the requirements of the proposed rule was found to be the 
RouteTracker sold by Turnpike Global, now part of Xata Corporation.  Cost data are based on the use of 
this device with the Sprint network.  See the EOBR I RIA for a complete discussion of costs of this device.

of device costs to  be narrow:  Annualized costs for the low cost device were estimated to 

be  $525,  and  annualized  costs  for  the  high  cost  device  were  estimated  to  be  $785.  -

Appendix  F  of this  RIA  contains  a  more  detailed  discussion  of EOBR  device  costs. 

Moreover,  EOBRs  would  eliminate  or  significantly  simplify  several  of the  paperwork 

processes  associated  with  paper RODS,  and  the  monetized  paperwork burden reduction 

offsets  most of the device costs  for motor carriers and their drivers  currently using paper 

RODS.  Appendix  F  of this  RIA  contains  additional  discussion  of the  availability  and 

prices of EOBRs. 

This  analysis  also  evaluates  the  costs  and  benefits  of  motor  carriers'  improved 

compliance with the underlying HOS  rules  through the use of EOBRs.  The Agency has 

updated  its  assessment  of the  baseline  level  of non-compliance  with  the  HOS  rules  to 

account for changes in factors  such as  inflation, a decline in HOS violations that preceded 

the  mandate  for  EOBR  use,  and  the  decline  in  CMV -related  crashes.  Included  in  this 

analysis  as  alternative  baselines  are  options  from  the  recently  published  NPRM  for  the 

HOS  rules  for  property  carriers.  (Option  1 of the  HOS  NPRM  is  to  retain  the  current 

HOS  rules)  [75 FR 82170 (Dec.29, 2010)]).  The major changes for both HOS  options is 

to  allow  at  most  13  hours  of  on-duty  time  within  the  daily  driving  window;  limit 

continuous on-duty drive time to  seven hours,  at which point a thirty-minute off-duty or 

sleeper-berth period would be required;  and to  require at least two  overnight periods per 

34-hour  restart.  HOS  Option  2,  however,  also  reduces  daily  drive  time  from  11  to  10 

hours,  while HOS  Option 3 retains  11  hours  of drive time.  To avoid confusion between 

the HOS  options and the options for the EOBR NPRM, HOS Option 2 and HOS Option 3 

are referred to as Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. 

As  stated,  the  Agency  is  currently  considering  three  options  for  the  EOBR  mandate. 

Option 1 would be to require EOBRs for all drivers currently using paper RODS.  Option 

2  (often  referred  to  as  "RODS+"  in  this  RIA)  expands  Option  1  to  include  nearly  all 

passenger-carrying  CMV s  and  all  shipments  of bulk  quantities  of hazardous  materials, 

regardless  of whether  the  drivers  use  paper  RODS  or  are  exempted  from  doing  so  as 

described under the "short-haul operations" provisions  in 49 CFR 395.1(e).  The Agency 

iv 

believes that the higher potential for injuries and fatalities  in crashes involving passenger(cid:173)

carrying  CMV s  and  shipments  of  bulk  hazardous  materials  could  warrant  additional 

safety  requirements  for  these  operations.  Option  3  would  include  all  CMV  operations 

subject to HaS requirements. 

The  NPRM  being  evaluated  also  proposes  changes  to  the  HaS  supporting  document 

requirements. 

The  Agency  has  attempted 

to  clarify 

its  supporting  document 

requirements,  recognizing  that  EOBR  records  serve  as  the  most  robust  form  of 

documentation for  on-duty driving periods.  FMCSA neither increases nor decreases  the 

burden  associated  with  Supporting  Documents  for  HaS  Compliance.  These  proposed 

changes  are expected to  improve the  quality and usefulness of the  supporting documents 

retained.  The improved  quality of the  supporting documents  will  subsequently increase 

the  effectiveness  and efficiency of the Agency's review  of motor carriers'  HaS records 

during  on-site  compliance  reviews,  thereby  increasing  its  ability  to  detect  HaS  rules 

violations.  The Agency is  currently unable to evaluate the  extent to which the proposed 

changes to the supporting documents requirements will lead to reductions in crashes.

seven percent and three percent discount rates.

FMCSA has  estimated that  all  options  presented  in  this  RIA  have  positive  net  benefits 

under any baseline,  that is,  under any version of the HOS  rules.  However,  the  greatest 

safety impacts of the HOS  rules  are  seen in long-haul (LH) operations, and the inclusion 

of short-haul (SH) operations diminishes the net benefits of this EOBR rule, although SH 

RODS  users  would experience sizable paper work savings  that boost the net benefits  of 
the  rule. 5  Therefore  Option  3,  which  includes  all  carrier  operations,  results  in  much 

lower  net  benefits  as  compared  to  Options  1  and  2.  The  alternative  baselines  reflect 

changes to the HOS rules that affect only LH, RODS-using operations. 

5  The distinction between SH and LH operations is  an important analytical concept for evaluating HOS 
rules and EOBRs,  However, operationally, it is extremely difficult for enforcement personnel to 
differentiate between drivers and CMVs by length of haul.  Consequently, the Agency does not believe a 
LH only option would be practical.

Background 

1.1 

Agency Mission 

Transportation  safety  is  the  Department  of  Transportation's  (DOT's)  top  strategic  priority. 

Because the human toll  and economic cost of transportation accidents  are substantial, improving 

transportation  safety  is  an  important  objective  of all  DOT  modes.  Within  DOT,  FMCSA  is 

primarily  focused  on  safe  use  of public  roadways  by  motor  carriers  with  the  goal  of reducing 

crashes, injuries, and fatalities  involving large trucks and buses.  The Secretary of Transportation 

has  promulgated  the  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Regulations  (FMCSRs)  to  further  this 

purpose. 

In  carrying  out  its  safety  mandate,  FMCSA  develops  and  enforces  regulations  that 

balance motor carrier safety with industry efficiency.6 

The  goal  of the  HOS  regulations  (49  CFR  Part 395)  is  to  promote  safe  driving  of commercial 

motor vehicles by limiting on-duty and driving time and ensuring that drivers have adequate time 

to obtain rest. FMCSA conducts regular checks at the roadside and during compliance reviews to 

ensure  that  drivers  are  operating  within  the  HOS  limits.  Surveys  have  shown,  however,  that 

many CMV drivers  violate HOS  limits,  and that many also falsify their paper RODS  to  give the 
appearance  of legal  operation.7
Inc.,  revealed  that  over 78%  of its  respondents  believe  that  the  most  common,  deliberate  HOS 

,8  A  recent  online  survey,  conducted  by  United  Safety Alliance, 

violation  is  log-time  as  being  off-duty  when  actually  on-duty.  The  survey  also  discovered  that 

"77%  of the  respondents  admitted to  deliberately violating the HOS  regulations  in the past and 

55%  said  they  were  still  currently  deliberately  violating  the  rules."  Furthermore,  survey 

respondents  were  asked  to  estimate  how  many  days  per  month  that  they  were  in  violation. 

Respondents  admitted  to  intentionally  violating  HOS  regulations  6  days  per  month,  and 
unintentionally at least 5 days per month, either by accident,  oversight, or honest mistake.9  The

National Transportation Safety Board and safety advocacy groups have recommended mandatory 

use of EOBRs as  a way to increase compliance with HOS  regulations. 

1.2 

Description of Proposed Rule 

This  RIA  provides  an  assessment  of the  costs  and  benefits  of requiring  motor  carriers  to  use 

EOBRs to track driving, on-duty, off-duty, and sleeper berth time.  This requirement would be set 

primarily  to  improve  compliance  with  the  HOS  limits  on  CMV  drivers.  EOBRs  track  driving 

time and other activities electronically, providing similar information to  the currently used paper 

RODS.  However,  use  of EOBR  technology  would  significantly  reduce  or  eliminate  false  or 

erroneous  driving  time  records,  and  could  reduce  false  and  erroneous  on-duty,  off-duty,  and 

sleeper-berth entries. The Agency published a Final Rule on EOBRs (EOBR I)  on April 5,  2010, 

specifying their technical  requirements  and  mandating their installation and  use for  a period of 

two years on all power units of carriers with recurrent HOS  compliance problems, those found in 

a  compliance  review  to  have  a  10  percent  or  greater  violation  rate  (pattern  violation)  for  any 

regulation  in  Appendix  C  to  49  CFR  part  385  ("1XlO  Remedial  Directive  Carriers").  The 

effective date of this  Final Rule is  June 4,  2012.  A full  RIA assessing the costs  and benefits of 

EOBRs was prepared for EOBR I,  but the analysis of EOBR benefits and costs has been updated 

to  more precisely evaluate the impacts  of these devices  when they are required for a majority of 

or all  CMV  operations.  The  Agency has  also  published an  NPRM  on the  HOS  rules,  and  this 

RIA also evaluates EOBRs against two of the proposals in that NPRM. 

The Agency has  yet to  identify any device that functions  solely as  an EOBR.  Rather,  electronic 

HOS  recording  is  a  simple  extension  of many  fleet  management  systems  (FMS)  which  offer 

mobile  communications  and  tracking  and  are  integrally  synchronized  with  the  CMV,  the  two 

most critical hardware requirements for the EOBRs.  Carriers required to acquire and use EOBRs 

will  most  likely  obtain  new  FMS  that  offer  EOBR  functionality.  As  it  did  in  EOBR  I,  the 

Agency will continue to recognize that carriers that already have in place FMS will have a low or 

no cost alternative to acquiring EOBR functionality.  These carriers will simply begin using their 

devices' EOBR feature or to upgrade their devices to this functionality.

1.3 

Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) 

FMCSA has  determined  that  this  rulemaking  is  a  significant regulatory  action under Executive 

Order  12866,10  Regulatory  Planning  and  Review,  and  significant  under  Department  of 

Transportation regulatory policies and procedures because the economic costs and benefits of the 

rule exceed the $100 million annual  threshold and because of the substantial Congressional and 

public interest concerning the crash risks associated with driver fatigue. 

1.4 

Policy Options Considered 

FMCSA  is  proposing  to  extend  the  mandate  for  EOBRs  to  permanent  installation  and  use  of 

these  devices  for  the  majority of motor  carrier operations.  However,  the  costs  and benefits  of 

such a broad mandate are  not identical  across  all  types  of options.  The options  the Agency has 

chosen  to  evaluate  reflect  public  comments  the  Agency  received  in  past  EOBR  and  HOS 

rulemakings,  recommendations  from  other  Government  entities,  and  the  Agency's  safety 

priorities. 

The Agency  is  currently  considering  three  options  regarding  the  scope  of the  EOBR  mandate. 

Option  1 would require EOBRs  for  all  drivers  required to  use  paper RODS.  Option 2 expands 

Option  1 to  include nearly all  passenger carrying CMVs  and  all  shipments  of bulk quantities  of 

hazardous  materials  (bulk  HM),  regardless  of  whether  the  drivers  use  paper  RODS  or  are 

exempted from  doing  so  as  described  under  the  "Short-haul  operations"  provisions  in 49  CFR 

395.1(e).  The  Agency  believes  that  the  higher  potential  for  injuries  and  fatalities  in  crashes 

involving  passenger-carrying  CMVs  and  shipments  of  bulk  hazardous  materials  warrant 

additional safety requirements for these operations.  Option 3 is  the broadest in scope within the 

Agency's  legal  authority,  and  would  include  all  CMV  operations  subject  to  the  HOS 

requirements. 

The Agency did not consider an alternative for proposing mandatory use of EOBRs only for LH 

operations  in the  current NPRM.  Proposing to  require EOBR use for LH CMVs  would present

difficulties  for  implementation because there  is  no  current regulatory  definition of "long-haul" 

and it  is  likely that attempts  to  establish a definition would cause  confusion among carriers  and 

enforcement officials.  For example, some drivers  and carriers  may fall  under the definition and 

be  subject  to  the  EOBR  requirement  on  an  intermittent  basis  making  it  difficult  to  assess  the 

safety benefits for the periods where such carriers do not engage in LH operations. 

1.5 

Baselines for Analysis 

The  Agency  considered  three  baselines  for  its  analysis.  The  first  uses  the  current  state  of 

compliance and estimated compliance costs  and safety benefits from stricter enforcement of the 

current  HOS  rules.  In  constructing this  baseline,  the  Agency began with  the  baseline  level  of 
non compliance developed for changes made to the HOS  rules  in 2003 11  and carefully reviewed 
and  integrated all  subsequent changes  that have led to the current regulations.  Furthermore, the 

recomputed  baseline  includes  adjustments  that  reflect the  decrease  in  HOS  violations  found  in 

roadside  inspections  and  the  overall  improvement  in  motor  carrier  safety  since  the  2003  HOS 

RIA was  produced.  Compliance costs and safety benefits were also rescaled for inflation and the 

current estimates of the monetized costs of CMV crashes. 

FMCSA  evaluated  costs  and  benefits  against two  alternative  baselines  derived  from  Options  2 

and  3 proposed in the  HOS  NPRM regarding property carriers  that has  been recently published 

(Option 1 of the HOS  NPRM is  to retain the current HOS  rules)[ 75  FR 82170 (Dec 29, 2010)]). 

The major changes for both HOS  options is to allow at most 13 hours of on-duty time within the 

daily driving window;  limit continuous  on-duty drive  time to  seven hours,  at which point a 30-

minute off-duty or sleeper-berth period would be required;  and to  require at least two overnight 

periods per 34-hour restart.  HOS  Option 2, however, also reduces daily drive time from  11  to  10 

hours, while HOS  Option 3 retains  11  hours of drive time.  To avoid confusion between the HOS 

options and the options for the EOBR NPRM, HOS  Option 2 and HOS  Option 3 are referred to 

as Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. 

11  The 2003 and subsequent HOS rule changes have applied to property carrying operations only.  The Agency 
found negligible differences in its overall estimates of costs and benefits when passenger carriers were evaluated 
separately from property carriers. 

4 

The  Agency  also  estimated  EOBRs'  effectiveness  in  reducing  HOS  violations  and  improving 

safety.  EOBR data are not continuously monitored for  violations,  and even if they were,  not all 

HOS  violations would be documented.  Consequently, the Agency cannot assume that EOBR use 

wi11lead to  perfect compliance with the HOS  regulations.  Safety benefits  and compliance costs 

in all three baselines are therefore reduced to reflect the limitations of the devices. 

All monetary values are in year 2008 dollars.  This  is  the same basis  as  the 2010 HOS  RIA,  and 

facilitates comparison between the two analyses. 

1.6 

Implementation of Proposed Rule 

This  RIA  separately considers  several  categories  of motor carrier operations.  Short-haul  (SH) 

operations for vehicles are defined as  those that occur within 150 air-miles of their base, and LH 

operations  for  vehicles  are  defined  as  those  that  occur  outside  of the  150  air-mile  radius.  SH 

drivers  are  generally not  required to  keep  RODS  if they work fewer  than  12  hours  a day,  start 

and  stop  at the same location,  and operate within a  100-air mile radius  (under the provisions of 

49  CFR 395.1(e)(1))  or  operate  certain  vehicles  within  a  150-air  mile  radius  (under  the 

provisions of 49 CFR 395. 1(e)(2)). 12  The Agency estimates that 25 percent of SH operations are 
exempt from RODS requirements. 13 

The  SH  and  LH  group  together  is  the  entire  regulated  freight  and  passenger  transporting 

population  subject  to  HOS  regulations.  Because  of  their  higher  potential  for  fatalities  and 

injuries,  FMCSA examined  passenger  carrying  and  bulk hazmat operations.  Last,  the  Agency 

divided carriers  into three size groups,  large (greater than  1,000 CMVs),  medium (151  to  1,000 

CMVs),  and small  (150 CMVs  or fewer).  The Agency found that the percentages of operations 

in LH and SH differ across these size categories. 

The Agency proposes full implementation to occur three years after the rule is  published to allow 

12  These SH drivers are allowed to substitute time-cards for RODS. 
13  See the currently approved supporting statement for the HOS Information Collection Request (lCR) (OMB 
control number 2126-000 1).  The ICR estimates that 35 percent of interstate and intrastate drivers (assuming States 
adopt compatible HOS provisions for intrastate drivers) would be exempt from RODS requirements.  The Agency 
assumes that a lower percentage, 25  percent of the interstate-only population of drivers,  would be exempt from 
RODS. 

5 

for  sufficient  availability  of EOBRs.  This  rule  would  likely  become  effective  no  earlier  than 

2014, four years  after the technical specifications were published in EOBR I,  and two years after 

the first  1xlO remedial directive carriers will have been required to use the devices.  Moreover, a 

significant number of motor carriers have already adopted automatic on-board recording devices 

(AOBRDs) for HOS  recording and monitoring, therefore would likely adopt EOBRs  when units 

meeting  the  technical  requirements  become  available.  Nevertheless,  the  Agency  is  uncertain 

whether motor carriers  and EOBR device manufacturers will be prepared for a mandate as  broad 

as  those being proposed in this  NPRM even by 2014,  and has  requested comments on this  topic 

in the NPRM.

Overview of Motor Carrier Industry 

2.1 

Regulated Motor Carriers 

FMCSA  estimates  that  approximately  500,000  motor  carriers  with  4,000,000  drivers  and 

3,637,000 CMVs  are currently subject to  the HOS  rules.  Roughly 60 percent of the industry is 

engaged in SH operations and 40 percent in LH operations, although these percentages vary with 

different  segments  of the  industry.  Table  1 below summarizes  the number of affected  carriers, 

drivers,  and  CMVs  in total  and for  the  individual  segments  analyzed.  The explanation of how 

these numbers were derived can be found in Appendix A.

The magnitude of costs and benefits of this proposed rule is  determined by the number of drivers 

and  CMV s  covered  by  the  mandate.  However,  the  effects  of different  sources  of costs  and 

benefits are not uniform for all drivers  and CMVs.  For example, the safety benefits of the HOS 

rules  are  highest  for  LH  drivers,  those  most  at  risk  to  suffer  from  inadequate  rest  because  of 

longer continuous daily driving periods and nights spent away from home, and, for team drivers, 

sleeping  in  a  CMV  in  motion.  For these  reasons,  LH  carriers  are  the  most likely to  already be 

using  EOBRs  or  FMS  to  efficiently  route  their  drivers  or  to  track  their  whereabouts.  A  full 

EOBR mandate can likely be accomplished more rapidly and  at  lower costs  for  LH operations. 

SH operations  accrue  smaller safety benefits from the HOS  rules,  and those SH carriers exempt 

from paper RODS  requirements  likely have no voluntary EOBR use and would not benefit from 

the elimination of paper RODS afforded by EOBRs. 

2.2 

Current AOBRDIEOBR and FMS Use 

Many  carriers  already use  AOBRDs  and  FMS,  and  will  likely  voluntarily  adopt  EOBRs  when 

units  meeting  the  technical  requirements  are  available.  As  it  did  in  EOBR  I,  the  Agency 

excludes  any  voluntary  use  of AOBRDs  and  EOBRs  from  its  analysis.  Although  one  might 

believe  that  the  pace  of  voluntary  adoption  would  increase  with  the  release  of  the  EOBR 

technical  requirements,  the  Agency  notes  that  the  requirements  for  AOBRDs  have  been in  the 

FMCSRs since 1988 and, although some sectors of the motor carrier industry (specifically, many 

private  motor  carriers  of property14)  use  AOBRDs  extensively,  the  estimated  adoption  rate  by 

motor carriers overall is  only approximately 12 percent for LH operations and 4 percent for SH. 

The Agency therefore believes that without an EOBR mandate,  its  actions  have had little effect 

on voluntary EOBR adoption and that  it is  most appropriate to  evaluate benefits  and costs  with 

respect to mandated, rather than voluntary, use of these devices. 

The Agency's  perception is  that  carriers  that  voluntarily  adopt new technologies  has  been that 

these  carriers  are  generally  larger,  more  efficient,  and  safer  than  average. 

In  other  words,

carriers would not have voluntarily adopted EOBRs to address  safety problems but because of a 

culture of safety consciousness  that extends across  many of its  business  decisions.  Survey data 

collected by Corsi et al. 15  seem to  verify this hypothesis:  Their data found a negative corellation 
between current  voluntary EOBR use  and  past SafeStat l6  scores,  that  is  voluntary  EOBR  users 
had lower past scores,  indicating that they were relatively safer relative to  other carriers.  With 

respect  to  this  analysis  of an  EOBR  mandate,  voluntary  adopters  likely have  better underlying 

HOS  compliance records,  and therefore lower net benefits of EOBR use than those carriers  that 

will  utilize  the  devices  only  when  mandated  to  do  so.  Because  the  net  benefits  of this  rule 

pertain only to  these carriers that have not yet installed EOBRs, they may be understated  in this 

analysis.  It is  important  to  note,  however,  that  voluntary  adopters  likely  accrue  other  benefits 

that  are  not  necessarily  part  of  minimal  EOBR  functionality,  but  that  arise  from  other  fleet 

management  capabilities  in  the  systems  EOBRs  may  be  bundled  with.  However,  the  EOBR 

performance  specifications  are  such  that  an EOBR  may  be  a  stand-alone  system  that  can  only 

electronically  monitor  HOS,  so  these  other  potential  productivity  benefits  have  not  been 

evaluated here.  The  Agency seeks  data  and  information from  current  users  of EOBR  devices 

about any business benefits that they have observed. 

This RIA uses  an updated model for forecasting  voluntary use of EOBRs or AOBRDs  and FMS 

without  any  EOBR  mandate.  Details  on  how  this  forecast  was  constructed  are  presented  in 

Appendix  B  of this  RIA.  The  Agency  forecasted  voluntary  use  only  for  LH  operations  and, 

based on data observed in 2005,  assumed that voluntary use for  SH operations will be one-third 

that of LH.  As  a consequence,  while voluntary EOBR and FMS  usage approaches  100 percent, 

SH voluntary use  never exceeds  33  percent.  This  seems  reasonable  in light of the  fact  that SH 

CMV s operate close enough to  their terminals  such that HOS  monitoring  and  CMV  tracking  is 

not  problematic.  Table  2  presents  the  forecasts  of voluntary  EOBR  and  FMS  use  that  would 

have  occurred  without  the  EOBR  mandate.  Included  is  the  percentage  of carriers  who  would 

already be required to  use EOBRs  under a  lxlO remedial  directive;  they are  excluded from  the 

analysis for this rule because the benefits and costs of their using EOBRs were already accounted

Total EOBRs Required 

The estimates presented in the previous two sections are used to produce estimates of the number 

of EOBRs  that  will  need  to  be  produced  to  meet  the  Agency's  proposed  mandate.  A  large 

portion of EOBR  supply  will  be  met by existing FMS  which,  as  discussed  in  the  next  section, 

significantly  reduces  the  cost  of this  rule.  Table  3  presents  the  estimates  of new  EOBRs  and 

upgradeable  FMS  needed  for  the  LH  and  SH  drivers  and  CMV s  presented  in  table  2  above. 

Conversations  with  motorcoach  companies  and  vendors  indicate  that  passenger-carrying 

operations  are  not given attention by FMS  vendors.  The logistics  of passenger transport,  which 

generally  follows  predetermined  schedules  and  routes,  differ  from  the  logistics  of  property 

transport, in which pickup and delivery of loads may be scheduled with little to no notice and in 

which  the  type  of cargo,  vehicle  size,  and  weight  can  require  more  careful  routing  of CMV s. 

Consequently,  the  Agency  assumes  that the  current use  of EOBRs  and  FMS  is  insignificant in 

passenger carrying operations, and uses 0 percent in its calculations.  Data in the shaded rows are 

carried forward into later stages of the analysis for the calculations of total costs and benefits.

For the  calculation of paperwork savings,  it  is  also  necessary to  divide the  SH populations  into 

those using RODS and those not using RODS.  SH operations that are exempt from RODS under 

one of the SH provisions  will  accrue no paperwork savings from EOBR use and are unlikely to 

currently use  EOBRs.  Table 4  presents  this  subdivision.  Many calculations  in  this  table  refer 

back to table 3.

EOBR Device Costs 

3.1 

New EOBR Costs 

The  Agency  is  basing  its  estimate  of EOBR  purchase  cost  on  one  FMS  that  offers  electronic 

HOS  monitoring  and  is  representative  of  mid-2010  state-of-the-practice  devices.  Cost 

information  was  gathered  from  a  conversation  with  a  sales  representative  from 
this 
manufacturer. 17  Although the $1,675  purchase price of this  unit is  on the high end of the range 

of prices  the  Agency  is  aware  of,  its  manufacturer  has  the  largest  share  of the  FMS  market. 

Therefore units sold at this price are  currently the most abundantly available.  The manufacturer 

states that it generally covers all repairs within a three-year initial warranty period, and that it has 

been charging $300-$500 per repair outside of the warranty period.  The vendor also claims that 

its  devices  are extremely durable  and are  specially tested to ensure they withstand the rigors  of 

CMV operation;  it states  that many of its  early model FMS  units have been in service for  more 

than  a  decade.  Although  it  is  unlikely  that  all  EOBRs  will  remain  serviceable  for  such  long 

periods, less durable units would likely have lower purchase prices, and amortized over time, the 

purchase and repair costs of the unit considered in the analysis may equal the purchase and repair 

or replacement costs of other units.  In its analysis, the Agency assumes that $500 repairs will be 

required  in  the  fifth  and  tenth  years  of the  devices'  operational  lives.  As  is  the  case  for  the 

purchase price, the Agency believes it is using a relatively high estimate for repair costs. 

Two  other  costs  related  to  the  device  are  considered  in  the  analysis.  The  first  is  the  cost  of 

17  Cost information for the Qualcomm Mobile Computing Platform (MCP)  100 was acquired through 
conversation with Qualcomm sales representative, Angelo Matera, and FMCSA during a meeting on May 12,2010. 

11 

installation.  The vendor of the device FMCSA is  using in this analysis states that installation by 

an experienced technician would take an hour or two per unit.  This RIA will use an installation 

cost of $100, which is  approximately two hours of labor cost for a CMV technician.  The Agency 

believes  the  installation of this  device  is  relatively more  complex  than that  of other units.  For 

example, the device used for the RIA in EOBR I was simply plugged into a CMVs OBDn port, a 

procedure that  took  only  a  few  seconds.  The  last  cost  is  that  for  monthly  service  fees  for  the 

unit.  The  minimum  service  package,  which  covers  all  FMS  functions  and  HOS  monitoring, 

costs $40 per month. 

In this analysis, the Agency has assumed complete ownership, or access, to computer technology 

by  motor  carriers,  as  their  use  is  known  to  be  ubiquitous  among  all  businesses.  Also,  this 

assumption has  been adopted from  EOBR I analysis,  therefore,  the  analysis  did not consider an 

estimation  of  the  cost  of  purchasing  new  equipment  (i.e.,  PCs).  The  Agency  seeks  public 

comments on this assumption. 

3.2 

EOBR Monitoring on Current FMS 

Many FMS  currently offer an HOS  monitoring feature.  Vendors  of these devices  have told the 

Agency  that  they  are  already  modifying  the  functionality  of these  devices  to  comply  with  the 

technical requirements of EOBR 1.  Almost all FMS  currently sold offer the two most important 

hardware  features  necessary  for  EOBRs,  location  tracking  and  synchronization  with the  CMV 

engine,  and  the  Agency  believes  that  most  upgrades  will  be  relatively  inexpensive  software 

changes.  Although  HOS  monitoring  is  often  included  in  a  single  monthly  fee,  some 

manufacturers  offer  a  la  carte  pricing  for  that  particular  feature.  Two  vendors  contacted  for 

EOBR I quoted prices of $5  or $8 per month for this  additional service. IS  The higher number is 

used in this RIA. 

3.3 

Training Costs 

18  RouteTracker charges an additional $5 for HOS functionality and Qualcomm charges $8.  Qualcomm has since 
dropped its a la carte pricing for this function, but the Agency prefers to  be conservative and to  use its higher price 
quote in this RIA. 

12 

In analyses  conducted for EOBR I,  FMCSA included the costs  of training drivers,  motor carrier 

office  staff,  and  state  police  and  other roadside  inspection  staff on how  to  use  the  devices  and 

access  electronic  records,  but  in  this  RIA  FMCSA  has  opted  to  exclude  these  costs  as 

insignificant.  Spread  over  the  140,000  CMVs  affected  by  EOBR  I,  annualized  training  costs 

amounted to only $26 per CMV.19  Training of enforcement staff accounted for  $6 of that cost, 

and because this training has  to be undertaken for EOBR I,  it is  not a cost of this rule.  Training 

costs borne by carriers were spread over two  years  (the period of time a carrier remains  under a 

remedial  directive).  When  the  devices  are  installed  permanently,  these  figures  would  be 

amortized over more years, further reducing the estimated cost per CMV. 

Most importantly, however, is  that as  the Agency has continued to talk with FMS  vendors and to 

learn how these  units  function,  it has  come to  believe that use of the EOBR features  by drivers 

and  access  to  the  electronic  RODS  by  carriers  are  largely  intuitive  and  self-explanatory. 

Vendors have demonstrated that they have tried to make these devices as  easy-to-use as  possible 

for the motor carrier industry.  A sales representative from the vendor of the device used in  this 

analysis was  able to demonstrate to FMCSA staff the EOBR features  of his firm's device in just 

a few minutes.  Other devices Agency staff has seen use either touch screens or simple buttons or 

keys  for  interacting  with  the  device.  The  RouteTracker device  analyzed  for  EOBR  I used  the 

driver's  cell  phone  as  its  user  interface.  Among  the  tasks  most  drivers  are  already  able  to 

accomplish  with  current  communications  technology,  such  as  mobile  phones,  computers,  and 

FMS,  using EOBR functions  would rank as  one of the simplest, and would certainly require no 

additional  expertise  from  drivers.  Also,  by  the  time  this  rule  becomes  effective,  the  Agency 

believes  that  most  drivers  will  have had  some  interaction  with  an  FMS  if not  an EOBR  in  the 

course  of their  careers.  The  Agency  is  also  certain that  new  drivers  will  learn  to  use  EOBRs 

much more rapidly than to learn how to  manually fill  in paper RODS.  Allowing for 5 minutes' 
worth  of initial  training  per driver  at  a  rate  of $27  per hour2o  yields  an  initial  training  cost  of 
$2.25 per driver,  and using the ratio of 1.1  drivers  per CMV (or EOBR)21  yields  a cost of about 

$2.50 per EOBR.  Because it is  a one-time cost-new drivers in the future will substitute EOBR 

training  for  paper RODS  training  already  occurring-it should  be  amortized  over  the  ten-year

13 

horizon of this  analysis,  which  yields  an  annualized  value  (using  a  7  percent  discount  rate)  of 

$0.33  per  EOBR.  Given  that  the  Agency  uses  a  relatively  high  EOBR  cost  estimate  in  this 

analysis, it has opted not to include this minor adjustment for training costs. 

Also,  carrier  office  staff  should  be  able  to  access  and  review  the  electronic  records  of their 

drivers more easily.  The vendors of devices offering EOBR features that the Agency is  aware of 

all offer a World Wide Web based hosting system for driver electronic RODS.  Carrier staff need 

only log on to a secure web site to have access to all their drivers'  records.  The Agency believes 

that the  tasks  required  of carrier office  staff to  view  and  audit the  records  from  EOBRs  are  no 

more  complex  than  those  they  should  already  be  able  to  complete  for  other  office  work,  and 

assumes that no additional training will be needed by carrier office staff. 

3.4 

Annualized Estimates of EOBR Costs 

Based  on  the  information  described  above  and  data  gathered  earlier  for  the  EOBR  I RIA,  the 

Agency calculated annualized costs per device.  These results  are presented in table 5.  All costs 

are  discounted over  10  years  and to  the beginning of year  1.  The  analysis  uses  the total  device 

cost of $785 per year.

Baseline for HOS Compliance Costs and Safety Benefits 

4.1 

Overview of Analysis 

The  total  level  of  non-compliance  with  the  HOS  is  extremely  difficult  to  measure  because 

violators  have  an  incentive  to  hide  their behavior.  FMCSA  does  have  extensive  data  on HOS 

violations  from  roadside  inspections,  compliance  reviews,  and  safety  audits,  but,  because  the 

Agency  cannot  continually  monitor  every  carrier  and  driver,  this  is  an  incomplete  picture  of 

HOS  compliance.  The  last  analysis  to  comprehensively  assess  total  non-compliance  was 

conducted  for  the  2003  HOS  rule  and  resulted  in  estimates  in  costs  and  benefits  of  full 

compliance with  the  HOS  rules  relative to  a "status  quo,"  that  is  a real-world baseline of daily 

and  weekly  drive  and  duty  times.  However,  data  on  total  compliance  have  not been collected 

since then, but the Agency does not assume that the status-quo baseline has remained static since 

2003.  Rather,  it  assumes  that total  HOS  compliance has  changed proportionally  to  changes  in 

HOS  violations  found  in roadside  inspections,  and  additionally that the  safety impacts  of HOS 

non-compliance has  changed  proportionally to  changes  in  overall  societal  damages  from  CMV 

crashes  adjusted  for  revised  estimates  of fatigue  involvement  in  those  crashes.  The  following 

sections  demonstrate  step-by-step  how  the  Agency  updated  the  2003  baseline  to  reflect  the 

present status of compliance. 

FMCSA carefully reviewed all  of its  past HOS  rulemaking  analyses  back to  the  2003  rule,  the 

point at which the Agency evaluated the underlying level of non-compliance with the HOS  rules 

15 

prior to changes already implemented or proposed in the recently published HOS  NPRM.  75  FR 

82170  (Dec  29,  2010).  From  that  point  through  the  current  HOS  NPRM,  each  analysis  of 

changes  to  the HOS  rules  has evaluated the impacts of rule changes  with respect to the fraction 

of operations affected by the changes.  That is,  they represent the incremental costs and benefits 

of full  enforcement to changes to the rule compared to the costs and benefits of full  enforcement 

of the  existing  rules.  Consequently,  starting  from  the  2003  status  quo  baseline,  the  costs  and 

benefits of subsequent changes can be layered on to create figures representing costs and benefits 

of eliminating non-compliance with the rules  currently in effect.  Figures  were also adjusted for 

inflation and underlying  improvements  in overall motor carrier safety and  compliance with  the 

HOS regulations. 

Because  the  Agency  has  recently  published  proposed  revisions  to  the  HOS  rule,  the  Agency 

seeks comments related to the approach by which HOS  is used within this rule. 

4.2 

Baseline for Compliance Costs 

Compliance costs  associated  with  the  HOS  rules  from  the  perspective of a  mandate for  EOBR 

use represent the costs  of moving the  motor carrier industry from  the current level of less-than(cid:173)

one-hundred-percent  compliance  to  full  compliance  with  the  current,  or  any  set  of HOS  rules. 

The Agency used  several  steps  to  construct a  baseline,  that  is,  the  maximum compliance  costs 

EOBRs  would force  carriers  to  bear if these  devices  brought about perfect  enforcement  of the 

HOS  rules, the current HOS rules  and two of the proposed HOS  options, as  described in section 

1.5 of this RIA.  Table 6 below presents the results of each level of this process.  In step one (I), 

FMCSA used figures  from the "Currentl100%" column of Exhibit 9-15 of the 2003  HOS RIA.22 

These figures  estimated the costs of moving motor carriers to full  compliance with the pre-2003 

HOS rules.  Step 2 (II-III) adds the incremental changes to compliance costs from changes to the 

rules  put in effect in 2003;  these figures  are from the  "FMC SA" column of Exhibit 9-13  of the 

2003 RIA.  Step 3 (IV-VI) adds the 2005 HOS rule changes-see Exhibits ES-2 and ES-5 of the 

22  See the "Regulatory Impact Analysis and Small Business Impact Analysis for Hours of Service Options,

2005 RIA23-deflated24  to the same year 2000 dollars as  the 2003  figures. 25  Step 4 arrives at the 

baseline  for  the  current  rules  by  adjusting  from  year  2000  to  2008  dollars  (122%)  and  the  16 
percent decline (84% = 100% - 16%) in HOS  violations discovered in roadside inspections since 
the  2003  rules  went  into  effect.  The  calculation  of this  decline  in  the  out  of service  (OOS) 

violation rate is presented in Appendix C of this RIA.  The final steps simply add the incremental 

costs of the two alternative baselines derived from the 2010 HOS RIA. 

The  2003,  2005,  and  2010  HOS  rule  baselines  are  taken from  their respective RIAs  which  are 

available for public comment in the docket and summarized in Appendix H.

Baseline for Safety Benefits 

The calculations  of the  safety benefits  follow  similar steps  as  the compliance cost calculations. 

Table 7 below presents  the results  of each level  of this  process.  Step one (I)  figures  are pulled 
from  the  "Current/100%"  column  of Exhibit  9-16  of  the  2003  HOS  RIA.26  These  figures 
estimated the safety benefits of moving motor carriers to full compliance with the pre-2003  HOS 

rules.  Step  2  (II-III)  adds  the  incremental  changes  to  safety  from  changes  to  the  rules  put  in 

effect  in  2003;  these  figures  are  from  the  "FMC SA"  column  of Exhibit  9-6  of the  2003  RIA. 

Step  3  (IV-VI)  adds  the  2005  HOS  rule  changes-see  Exhibits  ES-2  and  ES-5  of the  2005 
RIA 27-deflated to the same year 2000 dollars as  the 2003  RIA figures. 28  Step 4 arrives  adjusts 
for  a  203  percent  increase  in the  average  value  of a  CMV  crash,  which  reflects  both  inflation 

from  2000  to  2008  and  a higher  value  of statistical  life  (VSL),  since  the  2003  HOS  RIA  was 

produced.  The  calculation of this  increase  in  the  value  per crash  is  presented  in Appendix  D. 

Step  5  inflates  safety  benefits  to  account  for  the  Agency's  revised  estimate  of fatigue  related 

crashes,  as  discussed in the HOS  NPRM RIA (see also Appendix D of this RIA)  [.  The Agency 

had estimated 7 percent  as  the percentage of CMV crashes  attributable  to  CMV  driver  fatigue, 

but the  2010  HOS  RIA bases  its  analysis  on  13  percent,  which results  in  an  adjustment  of 186 

percent  (13%-:-7%).  The  final  steps  simply  add  the  incremental  benefits  of the  two  alternative 

baselines  presented  in  the  HOS  NPRM. 

Importantly,  the  HOS  NPRM  analysis  calculates 

additional benefits  from  driver health  improvements  brought  about by the proposed changes  to

EOBR Effectiveness 

In the  last few  years,  the Agency has  entered into  settlement agreements  with  a few  carriers  in 

which  it waived civil penalties for  violations  discovered in compliance reviews  in exchange for 

the  carriers  agreeing  to  install  AOBRDs  with  enhanced  functionality  (such  as  automated 

location-tracking).  The  Agency  examined  roadside  inspection  and  crash  data  to  evaluate  the 

19 

effectiveness of these devices  at  reducing  violations  and  crashes  for  these carriers.  Analysis of 

crash data is  inconclusive.  To date, relatively small carriers have entered these agreements,  and 

although their crash rates  may have been high,  crashes  were too  infrequent to  yield  statistically 

significant  measures  of the  safety  impacts  of enhanced  AOBRDs.  FMCSA  will  continue  to 

monitor  the  data  for  these  carriers.  Roadside  inspection  HOS  violation  data,  however,  were 

plentiful  and  yielded  statistically  significant  results.  The  overall  out  of service  HOS  violation 

rate  fell  70  percent  for  these  carriers,  but  many  of the  violations  eliminated  were  those  for 

missing and  improper RODS,  which may not mask violations  to  driving or on-duty time  limits. 

Consequently,  the  Agency  focused  on  driving  and  on-duty  time  violations,  which  it  estimates 

EOBRs  can reduce  40  percent.  Therefore,  in  addition  to  baseline  compliance  of current  HOS 

rules, the implementation of EOBR devices is  estimated to eliminate 40 percent of remaining out 

of service  HOS  violations. Appendix  E contains  a more  detailed  description  of this  calculation 

and other analyses and studies the Agency considered for estimating EOBR effectiveness. 

The 2010 HOS  RIA does  not measure the current state of compliance with the current proposal. 

FMCSA has  used  the  level  of non-compliance  with  the  pre-2003  rule,  with  some  adjustments, 

including one which accounts for the current size of the carrier population affected by this rule ..

Compliance Costs and Safety Benefits per EOBR 

In order to complete the analysis, the Agency computes compliance costs and safety benefits per 

EOBR  installed. 

It  assumes  that  the  benefits  of  EOBR  use  have  already  accrued  to  those 

operations  currently  employing  AOBRDs  or  EOBRs,  12%  of LH  operations  and  4%  of SH 

operations  (the  year  2009  row  of table  2).  EOBRs  are  installed  on  individual  CMVs  and,  as 

indicated  in  table  1,  there  are  currently  1,472,000  LH  CMVs  and  2,165,000  SH  CMVs.  The 

number of LH  CMVs  without  AOBRDs  or EOBRs  is  1,295,000  ((1-0.12)x1,472,000)  and  the 

number  of SH  CMVs  without  AOBRDs  or  EOBRs  is  2,078,000  (((1-0.04)x2,165,000),  for  a 

total  of  3,374,000  CMVs  without  the  devices.  The  attainable  compliance  costs  and  safety 

benefits  per  EOBR  are  calculated  by  dividing  the  values  in  tables  8  and  9  by  the  number  of 

CMVs without AOBRDs or EOBRs.  An adjustment was  made to the LH figures  to  account for 

the  fact  that  the  1,295,000  CMVs  that  currently  do  not  have  EOBRs  contain  CMVs  of 1XlO 

carriers,  those  with  the  worst  HOS  compliance  records  that  are  covered  under  EOBR1,  which 

will  not  be  effective  until  2012.  The  compliance  costs  and  safety benefits  of those  remaining 

CMVs  will  be  slightly  lower  than  the  current  state  of the  industry  after  the  1XlO  remedial 

directive goes into effect. 29  Tables  10 and 11  present the results of these calculations. 

29 The approximately 140,000 CMVs covered under the EOBR1  rule, the  1X1O group, represent about  10.8 percent 
of the total number ofLH CMVs that have not yet been outfitted with EOBRs.  CMVs in the 1X1O group were 
found to have double the violation rate and  1.4 times the crash risk per HOS  violation compared to other carriers. 
The unadjusted per EOBR cost is  implicitly a weighted average of 1X1O and other CMVs, so that: 
(a) WeightedAverageCost = (l40,0001X1O CMVs x 2violation rate x UnweightedAverageCost + (1,295,000CMVs 
- l40,0001X1O CMVs) x UnweightedAverageCost) 7  1,295,000CMVs 
(b) UnweightedAverageCost 7  WeightedAverageCost = 1,295,000CMVs 7  (l40,0001X1O CMVs x  2violation rate 
+ (1,295,000CMVs - 140,0001X1O CMVs)) . 
Solving this equation yields a value of 0.90 as an adjustment factor for compliance costs, that is, per EOBR

The use of EOBRs will significantly reduce the paperwork and recordkeeping burden associated 

with  the  HOS  regulations.  Drivers  will  benefit the  most:  EOBRS  will  greatly reduce  the  time 

they  spend  completing  their  RODS  and  eliminate  the  time  that  some  of them  currently  spend 

forwarding  their  RODS  to  their  employers  while  they  are  away  from  the  motor  carriers' 

terminals.  Comments received for  the NPRM on the EOBR I rule suggest that carriers  often do 

not  recognize  these  savings  because  drivers  are  not  always  compensated  for  completing  these 

tasks.  Regardless,  the  Agency  has  long  recognized  in  the  estimates  it  prepares  for  the  HOS 

compliance costs for non-lXlO CMVs are 0.90 times the average for all CMVs.  An analogous safety benefit 
adjustment equation that includes the higher crash risk is: 
(b2) UnweightedAverageBenefit + WeightedAverageBenefit =  1,295,000CMVs + (l40,0001XlO CMVs x 
2violation rate x  l.4CrashRisk + (l,295,000CMVs - 140,0001XIO CMVs». 
Solving this second equation yields a value of 0.84 as  an adjustment factor for safety benefits.

Information  Collection  Request  supporting  statements  that  the  largest  portion  of burden  falls 

directly to drivers.  With EOBR use, carriers will  accrue clerical time savings and will altogether 

avoid  the  cost of purchasing  paper log books.  Table  12  below  summarizes  the  paperwork and 

recordkeeping savings for each driver using an EOBR.

Labor Costs 

The Agency estimated the hourly labor costs of drivers and motor carrier clerical staff.  A motor 

carrier  employee  at  some  supervisory  level  would  also  handle  the  RODS  in  their  duties 

reviewing them, but the Agency assumes that electronic RODS will undergo the same scrutiny as 

paper  RODS,  and  therefore  does  not  estimate  any  time  savings  for  these  employees.  This 
analysis uses  a fringe benefit percentage of 1.5230  for motor carrier staff and a base wage of $15 
per  hour  for  clerical  staff  and  $18  for  drivers. 3l  MUltiplying  these  base  wages  by  the  fringe 
benefit factor yields labor costs of about $23  for clerks and $27 for drivers.  Drivers are assumed 

to  undertake  these  activities  during  non-compensated,  off-duty  time,  whereas  filing  is  part  of 

normal  paid  clerical  duties.  The  clerical  wage  was  inflated  by  27  percent  to  include  firm 
overhead. 32  The final labor costs used were $29 for clerks and $27 for drivers.

EOBRs do not fully  eliminate driver time spent logging HOS.  Although changes from  on-duty 

driving  to  on-duty non-driving are  logged  automatically by monitoring of the  CMVs  motion,  a 

driver will still have to interact with these devices to  log in at the beginning of the work shift, to 

log  out  at  the  end  of the  work  shift,  and  to  change  duty  status  to  off-duty  and,  if applicable, 

sleeper berth time.  The Agency estimates  that drivers  fill  out on  average  240  RODS  per  year. 

EOBRs  are  estimated  to  reduce  the  amount  of time  drivers  spend  logging  their  HOS  by  4.5 

minutes  per  RODS.  EOBRs  are  also  assumed  to  completely  eliminate  the  time  drivers  spend 

filing or forwarding their RODS  to the carriers, which the Agency estimates takes 5 minutes and 

occurs  25  times  per  year.  These  estimates  match  those  used  in  the  currently  approved  HOS 

Information Collection Request  supporting  statement.  Total  annual  estimated  time  savings  per 

driver are  18  hours  for  filling  out the RODS  (4.5  minutes  x  240 RODS  -:- 60 minutes  per hour) 

and  2.08  hours  for  forwarding  RODS  (5  minutes  x  25  occurrences  -:- 60  minutes  per  hour). 

These result  in  annual  labor or time  cost savings  per driver of $486  (18  hours  x  $27  per hour) 

plus  $56  (2.08  hours  x  $27  per  hour).  The  Agency  seeks  comment  from  the  public  on  the 

accuracy of these estimates. 

5.4 

Clerical Time Savings 

Because  electronic  RODS  will  likely  be  automatically  transmitted  and  stored  on  a  secure 

website,  carrier clerical  staff will  no  longer have  to  handle  these  documents.  The  Agency had 

estimated that it took carrier clerical staff only a minute to file each RODS, and EOBRs will now 

completely eliminate that task, resulting in annual time savings of 4 hours per driver (l minute x 

240 RODS  -:- 60 minutes per hour).  The labor cost saving of clerical time is $116 (4 hours x $29 

per hour). 

5.5 

Paper Cost Savings 

Vendors  such  as  JJ  Keller  sell  bound  packets  containing  a  month's  worth  of paper RODS  for 

about $2.50.  EOBRs will eliminate the need for these materials, resulting in annual cost savings 

per driver of $30 (12 monthly log books x $2.50).

Results for All Options 

Tables  13,  14, and 15  show the steps used to arrive at the final cost and benefit figures.  Table 13 

establishes  the numbers  of drivers  and  CMVs  affected,  and  what fraction of CMVs will  require 

wholly new EOBR purchases rather than upgrades to FMS.  Table 14 applies the figures  in table 

13  to  per unit or  per driver  estimates  of costs  and  benefits  to  arrive  at  totals  for  all  operations 

included under each option.  Table 15  shows net benefits under the two alternate HOS baselines. 

Net  benefits  are  positive for  all  three  options,  although they  are  substantially lower in option 3 

with the inclusion of SH operations exempt from RODS.

Alternative Implementation Schedule, Results for All Options 

FMCSA  also  evaluated  an  alternative  implementation  plan,  one  that  would  allow  for  gradual 

adoption  of  EOBRs  by  motor  carriers  over  a  five-year  period.  One  of  many  possible 

implementation schedules  would require EOBRs  in all  motorcoaches  in  year  1,  other passenger 

carrying operations  in year 2,  bulk HM operations and large property carriers  in year 3, medium 

sized  property  carriers  in  year  4,  and  small  property  carriers  in  year  5.  Although  after 

implementation  has  been  completed,  net  benefits  would  be  about  the  same  for  both  the 

alternative  and  proposed  implementation  schedules,  they  are  slightly lower under the  five-year 

26 

option because some net benefits are delayed later in the ten-year horizon evaluated in this  RIA. 

Appendix G contains a detailed explanation of how these estimates  were calculated.  Tables  16, 

17, and  18  show the steps used to  arrive at these cost and benefit figures.  Net benefits are again 

positive for all  three options, although they are substantially lower in option 3 with the inclusion 

of SH operations exempt from RODS.

Sensitivity Analyses 

8.1 

Faster Rate of Voluntary EOBR Adoption 

The Agency considered if its  EOBR adoption forecast  was  too  low,  and  evaluated the  cost and 

benefits  of its  options  using higher levels  of voluntary use.  Carriers  that would voluntarily use 

EOBRs  may have delayed their purchases  until the final  technical  specifications for the devices 

were  published  and  until  devices  compliant  with  these  specifications  became  available. 

Furthermore,  the  publication of this  NPRM and  the  potential  subsequent final  rule may prompt 

carriers to get ahead of the implementation schedule, in particular if they believe there is  a risk of 

units not being available when widespread required use begins.  The Agency created estimates of 

costs  and  benefits  based on  a doubling  of its  forecast  for  voluntary EOBR  use.  The  results  of 

this analysis are presented in table 21.

Other Agency Actions Improving Enforcement 

The  Agency  is  poised  to  propose  and  implement  several  other  rules  and  programs  that  it 

anticipates  will  improve  safety  before  this  EOBR  rule  would  become  effective.  The  most 

notable of them with regards to HOS  enforcement is  the Comprehensive Safety Analysis (CSA), 

under  which  the  Agency  will  propose  to  perform  targeted  interventions  on  carriers'  specific 

problem  areas  rather  than  rely  solely  on  comprehensive  compliance  reviews.  One  of those 

specific problem areas  is  driver fatigue/HOS  compliance.  This  will allow the Agency to  spread 

its  enforcement resources  over more  carriers  and  will  lead to  more  carriers  facing  enforcement 

actions for poor HOS compliance. 

In  the  main body  of the  analysis,  the  Agency did  not  attempt  to  forecast  additional  safety  and 

compliance  improvements  that  would  precede  the  effective  date  of this  rule. 

It did  find  that 

roadside inspection HOS  OOS  violations have declined to about 84 percent of their 2004 levels, 

and in this  sensitivity analysis FMCSA assumes that by the first compliance date, violations will 

drop  again  to  84  percent  of their  current  levels,  for  a  cumulative  effect  of about  70  percent 

(84%x84%  - 70%) of their 2004 levels.  The Agency also  observed that the average number of 

annual  fatal  crashes  over 2007  and  2008  was  93  percent of the  amount calculated for  the  2003 

HOS RIA analysis, and assumes that by the first compliance date fatal crashes will have dropped 

to  93  percent  of their  current  levels,  for  a  cumulative  effect  of about  85  percent  (93%x93%-

31 

85%) of the levels  estimated in the  2003  HOS  baseline, a  15  percent (100%-85%) reduction the 

attainable safety benefit pool.  The results of this  analysis are presented in table 22.  Net benefits 

are negative for option 3 with the current HOS rules as  a baseline.

Alternate Values of Statistical Life 

The  Agency  calculated  safety  benefits  and  net  benefits  using  a  lower  value  of statistical  life 

(VSL),  $3.3  million,  and  a higher  VSL,  $8.7  million,  as  compared  to  the  primary  estimate  of 

$6.0 million (all  VSL figures  in year 2008 dollars).  The results of these alternative analyses  are 

presented in tables 23  and 24 below.  With a lower VSL, option 3 has negative net benefits under 

both  implementation  plans,  and  option  2  has  negative  net  benefits  with  the  five-year  schedule 

only when the current HOS rules are the baseline.  All options have positive net benefits when an 

32 

$8.7 million VSL is  used.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 

9.1 

Introduction 

The  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act  of  1980,  Pub.  L.  96-354,  94  Stat.  1164  (5  U.S.C.  601-612) 

requires  Federal  agencies  to  consider the  effects  of the  regulatory  action on small  business  and 

other small entities  and to  minimize any significant economic impact.  The term "small entities" 

comprises  small  businesses  and  not-for-profit  organizations  that  are  independently  owned  and 

operated and are not dominant in their fields,  and governmental jurisdictions with populations of 

less  than 50,000.  Accordingly,  DOT policy requires  an  analysis  of the  impact of all  regulations 

on  small  entities,  and  mandates  that  agencies  strive  to  lessen  any  adverse  effects  on  these 

businesses. 

A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis must contain the following: 

A description of the reasons for the action by the Agency. 

A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for,  the rule. 

A description -

and,  where feasible,  an estimate of the number - of small entities to which the 

rule applies. 

A  description  of the  reporting,  recordkeeping,  and  other  compliance  requirements  of the  rule, 

including an estimate of the  classes  of small entities  that will  be subject to  the  requirement and 

the types of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record. 

Identification, to  the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules  that may duplicate, overlap, 

or conflict with the rule. 

A  description  of any  significant  alternatives  to  the  proposed  rule  which  accomplish  the  stated 

objectives  of applicable  statutes  and  which  minimize  any  significant  economic  impact  of the 

proposed rule on small entities 

35 

9.2 

Description of Reasons for Action by the Agency. 

FMCSA  proposes  to  amend  Part  395  of the  FMCSRs  to  require  the  installation  and  use  of 

EOBRs  for  most  CMV  operations.  CMV  drivers  are  currently  required  to  record  their  HOS 

(driving time, on- and off-duty time) in paper logbooks,  although some carriers have voluntarily 

adopted an earlier standard for  HOS  recording using devices known as  AOBRDs.  On April  5, 

2010,  FMCSA  published  a  rule  mandating  EOBR  use  for  a  two-year  period  by  commercial 

motor  carriers  that  fall  under  the  Remedial  Directive  defined  in  Subpart  J  of Part  385  (75  FR 

17208).  Remedial  Directive carriers  are  required to  install  EOBRs  in each CMV  regardless  of 

the  date  of manufacture  of the  vehicle. 33  These  carriers  will  have  been  found  during  a  single 

compliance review  (CR)  to have violation rates  greater than or equal to  10%  for  the HOS  rules 

listed under the Appendix C of Part 385 of the FMCSRs.  Although, after the compliance date of 

EOBR I,  EOBRs  will already be required for  those carriers  with the poorest compliance records 

with the HOS  regulations,  the Agency believes  that the benefits of EOBR use by the remaining 

majority of the motor carrier industry will exceed the costs associated with these devices. 

The  HOS  regulations  are  designed  to  ensure  that  driving  time,  one  of  the  principal 

"responsibilities  imposed  on  the  operators  of commercial  motor  vehicles,"  does  "not impair 

their ability to operate the vehicles  safely"  (49 U.S.c. 31136(a)(2)). Driver compliance with the 

HOS  rules  helps  ensure  that  "the  physical  condition  of commercial  motor  vehicle  drivers  is 

adequate  to  enable  them  to  operate  the  vehicles  safely"  (49  U.S.c.  31136(a)(3)).  FMCSA 

believes  that  properly  designed,  used,  and  maintained  EOBRs  would  enable  motor  carriers  to 

track  their  drivers'  on-duty  driving  hours  accurately,  thus  preventing  regulatory  violations  or 

excessive driver fatigue. 

Improved  HOS  compliance  will  prevent  commercial  vehicle  operators  from  driving  for  long 

periods  without  opportunities  to  obtain  adequate  sleep.  Sufficient  sleep  is  necessary  to  ensure 

that a driver is  alert behind the wheel and able to respond appropriately to changes in the driving 

33  A provision has been included to exempt Remedial Directive carriers from EOBR use if they already employ 
AOBRDs. 

36 

environment. 

Substantial paperwork and recordkeeping burdens  are also associated with HOS  rules,  including 

time  spent  by  drivers  filling  out  and  submitting  paper RODS  and  time  spent  by  motor carrier 

staff reviewing,  filing,  and  maintaining  these  RODS.  EOBRs  will  eliminate  all  of the  clerical 

tasks  associated  with the  RODS  and  significantly reduce the time drivers  spend recording their 

HOS.  These paperwork reductions offset most of the costs of the devices. 

9.3 

Objectives and Legal Basis. 

The  Agency  is  issuing  an  NPRM  proposing  to  mandate  the  use  of EOBRs  by  the  majority  of 

CMVoperations.  The objective is  to reduce the number of crashes caused by driver fatigue that 

could have  been avoided had the  driver complied with the HOS  rules.  The  legal  basis  for  this 

proposed rule is described in the NPRM. 

9.4 

Small Entities Affected. 

Under  criteria  established  by  the  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA),  firms  with  annual 

revenues  of  less  than  $25.5  million  are  considered  small  for  all  North  American  Industrial 

Classification System (NAICS)  codes  falling  under the  truck transportation sub-sector (NAICS 

484)  or  the  bus  transportation  sub-sector  (NAICS  485).  Many  motor  carriers,  however,  are 

private  carriers  that  transport  goods  or passengers  for  parent companies  who  are  primarily not 

engaged in truck transportation, for example, airlines, railroads, retail  stores,  and landscaping or 

home  contracting  businesses  with  SBA  size  thresholds  associated  with  their  industries  that  are 

different from those used for truck or bus transportation. 

FMCSA  does  not  collect  revenue  data  for  most  carriers  nor  can  it  identify  carrier-by-carrier 

which  industry  sub-sectors  each  firm  belongs  to.  Carriers  do,  however,  report  the  number  of 

power units they operate in the U.S.  on Form MCS-150.  With regards  to truck power units,  the 
Agency determined in the 2003 Hours  of Service Rulemaking RIA34  that a power unit produces

37 

about  $172,000  in  revenue  annually  (adjusted  for  inflation).35  According  to  the  SBA,  motor 
carriers  with  annual  gross  revenue  of  $25.5  million  are  considered  small  businesses.36  This 
equates  to  about  150  power units  (25,500,000/172,000).  FMCSA believes  that  this  150  power 

unit figure would be applicable to private carriers as  well:  Because the sizes of the fleets  they are 

able  to  sustain  are  indicative  of  the  overall  size  of  their  operations,  large  CMV  fleets  can 

generally only be managed by large firms.  There is  a risk, however, of overstating the number of 

small businesses because the operations of some large non-truck or bus firms  may require only a 

small  number  of CMVs.  The Agency has  identified about 482,000  motor carriers  that  operate 

150 or fewer power units, about 99% of property carriers. 

For  passenger  carriers,  the  Agency  conducted  a  preliminary  analysis  to  estimate  the  average 

number  of  power  units  (PUs)  for  a  small  entity  earning  $7  million  annually,  based  on  an 

assumption that a passenger carrying CMV generates annual revenues of $150,000. This estimate 

compares  reasonably  to  the  estimated  average  annual  revenue  per  power  unit  for  the  trucking 

industry ($172,000).  A  lower estimate  was  used  because  buses  generally do  not accumulate  as 
many vehicle miles  traveled (VMT) per power units  as  trucks37, and it is  assumed therefore that 
they  would  generate  less  revenue  on  average.  The  analysis  concluded  that  passenger  carriers 

with  47  PUs  or  fewer  ($7,000,000  divided  by  $150,000IPU  =  46.7  PU)  would  be  considered 

small  entities.  The  Agency  examined  its  registration  data  and  found  that  96%  of,  or just over 

19,000, interstate passenger carriers have 47 PUs or fewer. 

The Agency seeks comment on other ways to minimize the impact on small entities.  FMCSA is 

often  contacted  with  public  inquiries  about  EOBR  devices,  and  will  continue  to  address  these 

questions.  Following  the  pattern  of previous  rulemakings,  the  Agency  will  conduct  outreach 

once a final  rule is  issued.  The Agency notes that all registered motor carriers are subject to this 

rule.  This includes small non-profits.  This does not include small governmental jurisdictions.

9.5 

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements. 

FMCSA  believes  that  implementation  of  the  proposed  rule  would  not  require  additional 

reporting,  recordkeeping,  or other paperwork-related compliance requirements  beyond  what  are 

already required  in  the  existing regulations.  In fact,  the  proposed rule  is  estimated to  result  in 

paperwork savings,  particularly from  the  elimination of paper RODS.  Furthermore,  the  carriers 

would  experience  compensatory  time-saving  or  administrative  efficiencies  as  a  result  of using 

EOBR  records  in  place  of paper RODS.  The  level  of savings  would  vary  with  the  size  of the 

carrier implementing the systems (larger carriers generally experience greater savings). 

Under  current  regulations,  most  CMV  drivers  are  required  to  fill  out  RODS  for  every  24-hour 

period.  The  remaining  population  of CMV  drivers  is  required  to  fill  out  time  cards  at  their 

workplace (reporting location). Motor carriers must retain the RODS  (or timecards, if used) for 6 

months.  FMCSA  estimates  the  annual  recordkeeping  cost  savings  from  this  proposed  rule  of 

about  $688  per  driver.  This  is  comprised  of  $486  for  a  reduction  in  time  drivers  spend 

completing  paper RODS  and  $56  submitting  those  RODS  to  their  employers;  $116  for  motor 

carrier  clerical  staff to  handle  and  file  the  RODS;  and  $30  for  elimination  of expenditures  on 

blank paper RODS  for  drivers.  Two  of the  options  discussed  in  the  NPRM  extend  the  EOBR 

mandate  to  carrier  operations  that  are  exempt  from  the  RODS.  Paperwork  savings  will  not 

accrue to drivers engaged in these operations. 

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995  (PRA)  (44  U.S.c.  3501  et seq.),  Federal agencies 

must obtain approval from the OMB for each collection of information they conduct, sponsor, or 

require  through  regulations.  This  NPRM  proposes  regulatory  changes  to  several  parts  of the 

FMCSRs,  but only those  applicable  to  part  395,  "Hours  of Service of Drivers,"  would  alter  or 

impose  information  collection  requirements.  The  information  collection  requirements  of this 

NPRM  would  affect  OMB  Control  Number  2126-0001,  which  is  currently  approved  through 

August 31, 2011, at 181,270,000 burden hours. 

OMB  requires agencies to provide a specific, objective estimate of the burden hours  imposed by 

their  information  collection  requirements  (5  CFR  1320.8(a)(4)).  This  NPRM  proposes  a 

compliance date 3 years  after the date of publication of the final rule to allow regulated entities a 

39 

reasonable  opportunity  to  satisfy  its  requirements.  The  PRA  limits  estimates  of  paperwork 

burdens  to  a 3-year period;  during the  initial  3 years  following  publication of a final  rule  in this 

matter,  the  requirements  of  part  395,  including  information  collection  requirements,  would 

remain unchanged.  Consequently,  the Agency estimates  the paperwork burden of this  proposal 

to  be  181,270,000  burden hours,  as  currently  approved  by OMB.  At  an  appropriate  time,  the 

Agency  will  provide  notice  and  request  public  comment  on  the  paperwork  burden  of part  395 

after  the  initial  3-year  period  of this  rule;  at  the  present  time,  the  Agency  believes  that  the 

regulatory  changes  proposed  by  this  NPRM  will  ultimately  affect  a  net  reduction  in  the 

paperwork burden of OMB Control Number 2126-0001.

Federal Rules that May Duplicate, Overlap, or Conflict with the Rule 

The Agency did not identify any Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the rule. 

9.7 

Steps to Minimize Adverse Economic Impacts on Small Entities 

Of the  population  of motor  carriers  that  FMCSA  regulates,  99%  are  considered  small  entities 
under the SBA's definition. 38  Because small businesses are such a large part of the demographic 

the  Agency  regulates,  providing  exemptions  to  small  business  to  permit  noncompliance  with 

safety regulations  is  not feasible  and not consistent with good public policy.  The safe operation 

of  CMVs  on  the  Nation's  highways  depends  on  compliance  with  all  of  FMCSA's  safety 

regulations.  Accordingly,  the  Agency  will  not  allow  any  motor  carriers  to  be  exempt  from 

coverage of the proposed rule based solely on a status as  a small entity. 

FMCSA  analyzed  an  alternative  5-year  implementation  schedule  that  would  have  provided  a 

longer implementation period for  small businesses.  However,  the estimated cost of compliance 

for  motor  carriers,  including  small  businesses,  did  not  decrease  from  the  3-year  "baseline" 

proposed  implementation  period.  Furthermore,  a  considerably  longer  implementation  period 

could  compromise  the  consistency  of  compliance-assurance  and  enforcement  activities,  and 

thereby diminish the rule's potential safety benefits.  Therefore,  the Agency's proposal includes 

(482,000 property carriers + 19,000 passenger carriers) + 504,000 total carriers = 99.4% 

38 

40 

a  single  compliance  date  for  all  motor  carriers  that  would  be  subject  to  the  new  rule's 

requirements. 

However,  the  Agency  recognizes  that  small  businesses  may  need  additional  information  and 

guidance  in  order  to  comply  with  the  proposed  regulation. 

In  order  and  to  improve  their 

understanding of the proposal and any rulemaking that would result from it, FMCSA proposes to 

conduct outreach aimed specifically at small businesses.  FMCSA'would conduct Webinars  and 

other presentations as  needed and upon request, at no charge to the participants.  These would be 

held  after  the  final  rule  has  published  and  before  the  rule's  compliance  date.  To  the  extent 

practicable,  these  presentations  will  be  interactive.  Their  purpose  will  be  to  describe  in  plain 

language the compliance and reporting requirements so they are clear and readily understood by 

the small entities that will be affected. The technical requirements the EOBR device and support 

systems used by small businesses must be identical to those established in the April 5,  2010 final 

rule, as  amended (75  FR 17208; amended at 75  FR 55488, Sept.  132010», codified in Appendix 

A to Part 395.  This section establishes the minimum performance standards for the devices. 

Today's  rule would  likely become  effective  no  earlier than  2014,  four  years  after the technical 

specifications  were  published  in EOBR  I,  and  two  years  after the  first  lxlO remedial  directive 

carriers will have been required to use the devices.  EOBRs are expected to reduce business costs 

related to  HOS  Compliance,  and  can be used to  increase other business-related efficiencies  and 

reduce costs. 

EOBRs  can lead to  significant paperwork savings  that can in part or fully offset the  costs  of the 

devices.  The  Agency,  however,  recognizes  that  these  devices  entail  a  significant  up-front 

investment  than  can  be  burdensome  for  small  carriers.  At  least  one  vendor,  however,  provides 

free  hardware  and  recoups  the  cost  of  the  device  over  time  in  the  form  of higher  monthly 

operating  fees.  The  Agency  is  also  aware  of lease-to-own  programs  that  allow  the  carriers  to 

spread  the  purchase  costs  over  several  years.  Nevertheless,  the  typical  carrier  would  likely  be 

required to  spend $1,500-$2,000 per CMV to  purchase and  install EOBRs, and several hundred 

dollars per year for service fees.  This estimate is  higher than the estimate used in the April 2010 

EOBR rulemaking for two primary reasons. 

41 

This  proposed mandate  would be permanent and  also  would require EOBRs  to  be installed and 

used  in  more  than  20  times  as  many CMVs  than were  estimated  to  be  affected by the April  5, 

2010, final rule. Therefore, the Agency cannot assume that an adequate number of the lower-cost 

devices  would be  available  to  meet the  needs  of that  larger market.  Current revenue  data  from 

the  manufacturer of the  device cited in the April 2010 final  rule indicate that its  market share is 

relatively low. 

A  second  reason  for  using  a  higher  cost  for  this  analysis  is  that,  in  response  to  motor  carrier 

customer  demand,  EOBR  suppliers  have  expanded  the  functionality  of  their  products  and 

services.  Hours-of-service  recording  and  monitoring  are  functions  commonly offered as  part of 

comprehensive  fleet  management  systems,  rather  than  in  stand-alone  devices.  Many  motor 

carriers  are  recognizing  the  potential  operational  benefits  they  can  gain  from  the  use  of fleet 

management systems,  and  the  marketplace  is  responding  with products  and services  tailored to 

motor  carriers  of all  sizes.  However,  the  Agency  is  not  dismissing  the  possibility that  "stand(cid:173)

alone"  EOBRs,  providing  only  hours-of-service  recording  and  reporting  (similar  to  the  first 

AOBRDs  in the  1980s), may be offered for  sale or lease at a lower cost than devices with other 

functionalities  in  addition  to  HOS  compliance.  The  Agency requests  comments  and  data  about 

EOBR cost. 

Based  on  direct  expenence  with  the  devices  and  conversations  with  vendors,  the  Agency 

believes  these  devices  are  extremely  durable  and  can  be  kept  operational  for  many  years. 

In 

addition to  purchase costs,  carriers  would  also  likely spend  about $40  per month  per  CMV  for 

monthly service fees.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Analysis 

The Unfunded Mandates  Reform Act of 1995  requires  Agencies to  evaluate whether an Agency 

action would result in the expenditure by State, local and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or 

by the private sector, of $140.8 million or more (as adjusted for inflation) in anyone year, and if 

so,  to  take  steps  to  minimize  these  unfunded  mandates.  This  rule  would  not  result  in  the 

expenditure by State, local and tribal governments, in the aggregate, of $140.8 million or more in 

anyone year, nor would it affect small governments, as they are excluded from this rule. As table 

25  shows,  this  rulemaking would result in private sector expenditures  in  excess  of the  threshold 

for  all  of the  proposed  options.  Gross  costs,  however,  are  expected  to  be  more  than  offset  in 

savings from paperwork burden reductions.

Appendix A  Derivation of Carrier, Driver, and CMV Counts 

FMCSA used two recently conducted rulemaking analyses and data for  years  2007 through 2009 

from the  Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) for  its estimates of carriers, 

drivers, and CMVs.  Estimates of about 500,000 active carriers and 4,000,000 CMV drivers were 

developed  for  the  Drivers  of  CMVs:  Restricting  the  Use  of Cellular  Phones  (hereafter  "cell 
phone")  proposed rule. 39  The RIA prepared for the 2010 HOS  NPRM estimated  1,472,000 LH 

or over-the-road (OTR) tractors and 1,619,000 LH or OTR drivers, the latter estimate derived by 

having applied an industry average of 1.1  drivers  per CMV.40  The estimate in this  RIA of total 

CMVs  was  derived  by dividing  the 4,000,000  driver  estimate  in  the  cell  phone rule  by the  1.1 

driver-per-CMV  average,  resulting  in  an  estimate  of  3,637,000  CMVs.  SH  estimates  were 

derived by subtracting the LH estimates from the totals.  The Agency did not develop estimates 

for  the  number of LH and SH carriers  due  to  the overlap  between the  two  types  of operations, 

that  is,  not all  carriers  specialize by length of haul,  and many conduct both types  of operations. 

Separate estimates of the numbers of carriers engaged in LH and SH operations were not needed 

for the cost and benefit calculations.

MCMIS  data  on  the  type  and  number  of CMVs  are  generally  more  accurate  than  those  on 

drivers.  Carriers  report both types of information when they register for  their DOT numbers  on 

the  MCS-150 forms,  and  are  required  to  update  this  information at  least  once every two  years. 

The MCS-150 registration forms  contain information on the types  of equipment carriers  operate 

and if they haul bulk quantities of hazardous materials.  Counts of total CMVs by type of vehicle 

are believed to  be reasonably accurate and can be reconstructed  quickly from  the  MCMIS  data.

40  See section 2.1.3 and Appendix A of the 2010 HOS  NPRM RIA. 

44 

Counts of CMV s are also used to parse non passenger carrying, non bulk hazmat operations into 

three categories:  large (greater than 1,000 power units),  medium (151  to  1,000 power units),  and 

small  (150  or  fewer  power  units).  Driver  counts  do  not  identify  the  types  of  operations, 

passenger versus  property,  or the type of cargo that drivers  transport.  Due to  high occupational 

turnover,  driver  counts  can  be  fluid,  and  a  particular  driver  may  not  drive  the  same  type  of 

vehicle  or  cargo  throughout  the  year.  For  these  reasons,  the  Agency  simply  applied  the  1.1 

driver-per-CMV  estimate  for  the  CMV  totals  to  estimate  the  drivers  working  in  each  type  of 

operation.

Although  the  counts  of drivers  by type  of operation  in  the  MCMIS  data  were  unsuited  to  this 

analysis,  the Agency did  use  information on the number of SH ("within  100-Mile Radius")  and 

LH ("beyond 100-Mile Radius") drivers reported by carriers on the MCS-150 form.  Using these 

data, the Agency constructed estimates of the average fractions  of carrier operations by length of 

haul  for  each  of the  groups  (table  28).  Because  it  began  with  estimates  of total,  LH,  and  SH 

operations,  FMCSA  estimated  each  of the  categories  of operations,  and  then  used  the  small 

carrier group  as  a residual to  ensure that the  sum across  all  the  groups  equaled the total,  that is, 
Small = Total  - Motorcoach - Other Passenger - Bulk Hazmat - Large - Medium.  As  a next 
step,  the  percentages  in  table  28  were  applied  to  the  figures  in  table  27  for  the  final  counts  of 

CMVs and drivers by type of operation and length of haul, shown in table 29.

Appendix B  Forecasts of EOBR and FMS Use 

To forecast  EOBR  and  FMS  use,  the  Agency fit  a  model  to  the  few  data  points  it  had  on  the 

percentage of CMVs  equipped with these devices.  The Agency picked  1990 as  a starting point: 

around that year the first AOBRDs were introduced and FMS41  first came on the market.  Those 

early  FMS  would  have  had  none  of the  functionality  required  for  HOS  logging  as  defined  in 

EOBR I,  but the Agency assumes that early adopters will have upgraded their FMS to those with 

fully compliant EOBR functions  by the time the rule being proposed here will become effective. 

The Agency relied on a simple model for technology adoption called a diffusion model.  A study 

by  Ryan  and  Gross  (1943)42  on  farmers'  adoption  of  hybrid  seed  technology  is  widely 

recognized as  the starting point for modem research into the technological diffusion process.  A 

more  formal  mathematical  analysis  of this  earlier  study  was  presented  by  Griliches  (1957).43 

The  general  premise  is  that  the  total  percentage  of  new  technology  adopters  will  follow  a 

cumulative  normal  distribution  extending  over  time.  Using  1990  as  an  approximate  starting 

point, the Agency fitted diffusion curves to the 1990 starting point and other available data points 

on motor carrier technology use.  Charts 1 and 2 display those fitted curves.

Table  30  shows  the  percentages  for  FMS  and  EOBR  used  from  each  of the  diffusion  model 

curves  and  the  final  estimates  of technology  adoption  used  in  the  analysis.  As  of 2005,  the 

percentage  of SH  operations  using  FMS  was  about  one-third  the  percentage  of LH  operations 

48 

using  this  technology (8%  for  SH versus  25%  for  LH).44  The Agency does  not have  sufficient 

data to  estimate separate SH technology adoption curves,  and assumes  that technology adoption 

for  SH  will  be  one-third  that  of LH  for  any  point  on  the  diffusion  curves.  Last,  beginning  in 

2012,  the percentage of power units  affected by the EOBR I 1X10 remedial directive was  added 

on top of the percentages of EOBR voluntary users.

Appendix C  Improvements in HOS Compliance 

FMCSA  examined  CMV  roadside  inspection  data  from  2004,  the  first  full  year  the  main 

provisions of the current HaS rules  were in effect, through 2009, the last complete year of data, 

to  assess  changes  in carrier compliance with the HaS rules,  focusing  on those violations  severe 

enough to  warrant out of service (OOS) orders.  Table 31  shows the overall HaS OOS  violation 

rates  and  the  most  prevalent  types  of individual  violations  (the  OOS  rate  will  be less  than  the 

sum of the  individual  categories  because  an  inspection can  result  in  multiple  OOS  violations). 

From 2004 to  2009, the  overall OOS  rate declined about 84 percent.  OOS  rates  for  the  11  hour 

driving limit declined 67  percent,  and  OOS  violations  related to  missing,  incomplete,  improper, 

or  fraudulent  RODS  declined  84  percent.  Although  there  are  not  enough  years  of  data  to 

determine  whether  the  declines  in  the  HaS  violation  OOS  in  2008  and  2009  are  permanent, 

incomplete inspection data for 2010 are so far  showing further declines  in the HaS OOS  rate as 

compared to that in 2009.  These data represent the Agency's best estimate of the current state of 

HaS compliance,  and  although there  may be  some uncertainty as  to  whether they  are  the most 

robust  assessment  of baseline  non-compliance  with  the  HaS  rules,  projections  of future  non(cid:173)

compliance  rates  would  be  difficult  to  construct  and  would  have  high  degrees  of  forecast 

uncertainty. 

EOBRs  at  a minimum will  automatically record driving  time;  insofar as  drivers  use  the  devices 

as  required,  EOBRs  will ensure that drivers  have RODS  that are  complete and contain properly 

formatted  entries.  The Agency believes  that EOBRs  will  have  the  greatest impact reducing  11 

hour  driving  time  violations  and  most  of the  serious  RODS  preparation  violations.  However, 

because drivers  will  have to  manually record when on-duty,  non-driving periods  begin and end, 

EOBRs  will  have limited effects  on improving accurate recording of overall daily on-duty time 

(l4-hour rule violations) or weekly on-duty time (6017  or 70/8 rule violations).  Improvements in 

overall HaS compliance currently reflect reductions in  11  hour RODS preparation violations and 

will continue to do so when the majority of CMV operations begin using EOBRs.

Appendix D  Improvements in CMV Safety 

The  ability  of EOBRs  to  reduce  CMV  crashes  is  constrained  by  two  factors.  The  first  is  the 

overall  number  of crashes  occurring;  irrespective  of HOS  noncompliance,  safety  deficiencies 

have to  exist for  safety improvements to  occur.  The second is  the prevalence of crashes related 

to  HOS  violations,  specifically fatigue  related  crashes.  Safety benefits  can be  estimated as  the 

monetized reductions  in crashes that can be anticipated to follow  from reductions  in fatigue.  An 

accurate indicator to  measure safety benefits are reductions in crash risk because eliminating any 

hour of driving  eliminates  all  increase  in  crash  risk  associated  with  that  hour,  not just the  risk 

associated  with  fatigue  coded  ones.  However,  the  Agency  does  not  have  enough  data  to 

determine relative crash risk for all  types  of crashes at each hour.  Hence,  we consider only risk 

associated with fatigue-coded crashes. Table 32 shows the changes in the measurements of CMV 

safety since the safety baseline for the current rules  was  established in the 2003  HOS  RIA.  The 

"2003 Rule" column does not contain year 2003  data, but a four-year average from 1997-2000 to 

which the Agency's estimate of the cost of CMV crashes available at the time 45  was applied for a 

measure  of  total  societal  damages.  To  update  the  overall  CMV  safety  measure,  FMCSA 

compared the 2003  HOS  rule figures  to the average number of crashes that occurred in the most 

recent  two  years  for  which  data  are  available,  2007  and  2008.  As  shown in table  32, fatal  and 

injury  crashes  declined,  but  the  less  severe  category  of property  damage  only  (PDO)  crashes 

increased.  In total,  the number of crashes has  increased slightly, only 3 percent, as  compared to 

the  data used  in the  2003  HOS  rule.  The Agency also  applied  a higher value  for  the  cost per 

CMV  crash  which  reflects  revised  cost  per  crash  data,46  inflation  to  year  2008  prices,  and  a 
higher  VSL  required  by  DOT  for  all  of  its  regulatory  evaluations.47  Combined,  these 
adjustments  caused  the  estimate  of the  cost  per CMV  crash  to  about  double.  Total  monetized 

damages  from  CMV  involved  crashes  were  203  percent  of the  estimate  prepared  in  the  2003 

HOS  RIA;  this  adjustment  is  reflected  in  row  VII  of table  7.  Although  the  total  number  of 

crashes  did  not  change  substantially,  the  monetary  value  assigned  to  those  crashes  led  to  a 

significant increase in the safety benefits attainable by mandating EOBRs.

In the  2010 HOS  RIA,  the Agency reassessed the prevalence of CMV driver fatigue  in crashes. 

Past HOS  analyses had  used  an estimate of about 7  percent,  which limited the  attainable safety 

benefits from  any changes to the HOS  rules  or improved enforcement of those rules,  such as  by 

mandating  EOBRs,  to  at  most  7  percent  of the  total  societal  damages  from  CMV  involved 

crashes.  Based  on data from  the Large Truck  Crash  Causation study and public comments  on 

past HOS rule analyses, the Agency updated its estimate of the prevalence of CMV driver fatigue 

to  13  percent of crashes,  resulting  in the attainable safety benefits  increasing to  186 percent (13 

percent -:- 7 percent) of the value estimated in the 2003  HOS RIA.  This adjustment is reflected in 

row VIII of table 7. 

54 

Appendix E  EOBR Effectiveness 

There is  little research  on the  effectiveness  of EOBRs  in reducing  crashes  and HOS  violations. 

FMCSA  examined  a  study  conducted  by  Cantor  et  al.  of the  University  of Maryland  on  the 
effectiveness of EOBRs in reducing HOS  violations  and crashes.48  Data used in this study were 
from a national survey sponsored by FMCSA on safety technology adoption (which includes but 

is  not  limited  to  EOBRs  or  AOBRDs)  by  large  motor  carriers.  The  final  dataset  included 

information from  a total  of 386  firms  that operated on  average  671  CMVs;  in terms  of CMVs, 

survey  respondents  represented  about  6  112  percent  of the  estimated  total.  About  58  percent 

were  for-hire  carriers  and  the  range  of operations  represented  about  8 percent local,  44 percent 

regional,  and  41  percent  national.  Among  larger  carriers,  the  Agency  believes  the  survey 

achieved a representative cross section of the industry.  Small and medium carriers, however, are 

not  represented,  but  the  Agency  believes  that  these  firms  will  likely  have  lower  adoption  of 

safety technologies. 

The  researchers  employed Poisson models  that  treat  both  HOS  violations  and  crashes  as  count 

variables,  and  regressed  these  on  an  EOBR variable measuring the  percentage of each  carrier's 

fleet  that  used  the  devices  and  several  control  variables.  The  authors  developed  an  impact 

analysis on the average effect of EOBR usage based on the estimates resulting from their models. 

Their  analysis  found  that  full  EOBR  adoption  could  reduce  HOS  violations  12.4  percent  and 

reduce  total  crashes,  not  only  fatigue-related  crashes,  15.6  percent.  While  the  estimates  of 

positive impacts of the devices  are credible, the Agency believes that the magnitude of the crash 

effects estimated in this  study is  larger than what one would anticipate from the implementation 

of this  rule,  and the magnitude of the reduction in HOS  violations much smaller.  All  carriers in 

the  sample  that  use  EOBRs  adopted  these  devices  voluntarily, 

indicating  a  proactive 

commitment  to  reducing  their  fatigue-related  crashes.  Also,  EOBRs  were  likely  implemented 

along  with  other  safety  technology,  which  this  study did  not  control  for,  and  the  EOBR  usage 

variable  may  also  capture  safety  improvements  from  reductions  in  other  types  of crashes  not 

related to HOS  violations.  For the purposes of this  analysis, the Agency focuses  strictly on costs

55 

and  benefits  from  electronic  HOS  logging  and  monitoring,  which  likely  form  a  subset  of the 

crashes eliminated by the voluntary adopters in this study. 

The Agency relied on a different analysis of EOBR effectiveness that is  intended to evaluate. the 

effects  of  these  devices  for  the  typical,  unwilling  adopter  and  that  maintains  analytical 

consistency with the  HOS  rule.  It estimated the percentage of crashes  occurring at  illegal  drive 

times (after 11  hours) to construct an upper bound for the safety benefits of EOBR use.  It began 

with  the  Time  on  Task  (TOT)  model  developed  for  the  HOS  rules,  which  used  a  logistic 

regression to  predict fatigue related crashes as  a function of driving time:  Percentage of Crashes 
that  are  Fatigue Related = exp(-4.632 + 0.1226Drive Time + 0.0034Drive Time).2  Next,  using 
data from FMCSA's 2008 Field Survey,  the Agency constructed a measure  of driver exposure, 
that  is,  the  percentage  of driving  occurring,  at  each  hour  of drive  time.49  The  product  of the 

predicted percentage of fatigue related crashes and exposure yields an estimate of the percentage 

of total  crashes  attributable  to  fatigue  distributed  over  20  hours  of drive  time.  The  Agency 

estimates  that  driver  fatigue  occurs  in  13  percent  of crashes,  and  as  a  final  step  rescales  these 

results  to sum to  13  percent.  Last,  as  shown in table 33, the Agency calculates that total  annual 

societal damages  from  CMV crashes  are  $65,510 million.  This  amount can be allocated to  the 

fatigue related crashes  occurring in each hour of drive time.  This  analysis  is  presented in Table 

32.

According to this analysis, eliminating all fatigue-related crashes that occur during illegal driving 

times  results  in a  1.5 percent reduction in total crashes  and a monetized safety benefit of $1,014 

million.  As  Table 7  indicates,  the  baseline  safety benefit related  to  perfect enforcement of the 

existing HOS  rules  is  $2,658million.  If the elimination of driving  time violations  could accrue 

safety benefits of $1,014 million, then other violations  account for the remaining $1,644 million 

($2,658 - $1,014) in maximum safety benefits. 

To  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  EOBRs  in  improving  HOS  compliance,  the  Agency  used 

roadside  inspection  data  from  motor  carriers  under  settlement  agreements  with  the  Agency  to 

install and use enhanced AOBRDs.  The Agency continually monitors inspection data from these 

carriers.  It began by analyzing  OOS  II-hour rule  violations  per inspection.  Because  multiple 

categories  of OOS  HOS  violations  can  be  found  during  a  single  inspection,  the  TOT  model 

would have  captured the risks  of other types  of HOS  violations  that coincide with  driving time 

violations.  To attempt to isolate the effects of EOBRs on other violations, these other OOS HOS 

57 

violations  are  evaluated only where an  ll-hour rule violation had not been found.  As  shown in 

table  34,  after  the  carriers  began  using  enhanced  AOBRDs,  HOS  violations  dropped 

significantly; the differences in violation rates were significant at a 99 percent level or higher.5o

FMCSA's  analysis  indicates  that  enhanced  AOBRDs  can eliminate  at  least  two-thirds  of HOS 

violations.  However, the Agency is cautious not to overestimate the effectiveness of the devices, 

and  for  this  regulatory  analysis,  prefers  to  evaluate  them  at  the  lower  bound  of a  95  percent 

confidence  interval,  where  22  percent  of II-hour rule  violations  are  eliminated,  41  percent  of 

violations to other time limits are eliminated, and 66 percent of RODS preparation violations, so(cid:173)

called "form and  manner" violations,  are eliminated.  The Agency is  uncertain about the degree 

to  which form and manner violations are the result of simple negligence or mask other time limit 

violations,  but believes  the  latter reason is  prevalent enough to justify its  adjusting the  estimate 

of EOBR  effectiveness  upward  slightly.  As  discussed  above,  about  one-third  of  the  safety 

benefits  of enforcing  the  HOS  rules  come  from  the  drive  time  limits,  and  the  other  two-thirds 

from  the  other provisions.  The Agency calculates  overall  EOBR  effectiveness  as  the  weighted

treated as proportions, rather than sample means, was conducted.

average of II-hour rule and other rule enforcement, or [(22% x  1/3) + (41 % x 2/3)] = 34%.  The 
Agency rounds  this  figure  up  to  40  percent to  account for  form  and  manner violations  used  to 

hide time limit violations.

Appendix F  Price and Availability of EOBRs 

The  device  examined  in  the  analysis  for  cost  estimates  is  the  Qua1comm  MCP-100  FMS  that 

uses  terrestrial  communications. 

In  past  reviews  of devices,  FMCSA  has  found  Qua1comm 

devices to be at the top of the cost range of available products.  Qua1comm has among the largest 
market shares of FMS51

,  and although its devices are slightly more expensive, devices with costs 

close  to  that  of the  MCP-100  may  be  the  most  abundant  in  the  market  when  the  compliance 

phase-in begins.  Qua1comm reports  that the MCP-100 currently costs  $1675  and requires  a $40 

per  month  communication  fee,  which  covers  all  the  device's  main  features,  including  HOS 

monitoring.  A Qua1comm sales representative also  discussed third party lease-to-own programs 

that  allow  carriers  to  spread  the  up-front  costs  of the  device  over  a  monthly payment plan.  A 

typical payment plan is  $60 per month over 36 months. 

FMCSA  has  limited  information  on  the  ability  of  vendors  to  produce  adequate  supplies  of 

EOBRs  by the compliance date  of the  rule.  However,  there  is  currently  sufficient depth  in the 

market to  suggest that  vendors  will  be  able  to  meet  demand.  The  Agency estimates  that  about 

one-half of LH  operations  currently  use  FMS  or  EOBRs,  and  is  forecasting  that  about  three(cid:173)

quarters  of LH operations  will  have been using  these devices  absent this  rulemaking.  It is  also 

estimated that about 15 percent of SH operations use these devices, and that this will have grown 

to about 25  percent absent this rulemaking.  Vendors  are currently able to meet demand,  and the 

Agency  believes  that  they  will  have  already  been  anticipating  growth  in  EOBR  and  FMS 

markets.  FMCSA is  seeking commentary and information on vendors  on their ability to  supply 

EOBRs. 

Table 35  present further comparisons of devices costs.  A slightly higher cost results if the MCP-

100  is  evaluated  with  the  thirty-six-month  payment  plan.  The  cost  of producing  devices  may 

decline  over  time,  but  the  Agency  is  uncertain,  given  the  surge  in  demand  caused  by  the 

compliance date, whether these cost savings will be passed on to purchasers in the near term.

Appendix G  Evaluation of Five-Year Implementation Schedule 

The analysis  of a five-year  implementation plan is  complicated by the fact  that the  Agency has 

forecast  that  use  of FMS  and  voluntary  adoption  of EOBRs  will  increase  over  time,  thereby 

reducing  the  number  of carriers,  drivers,  and  CMVs  this  rule  will  affect  as  each  year  passes. 

Numerous  implementation schedules can be considered and  evaluated.  The Agency considered 

requiring EOBRs  for  all  motorcoaches  in  year  1,  other passenger carrying operations  in  year  2, 

bulk HM operations and large property carriers  in year 3, medium sized property carriers  in year 

4,  and  small  property  carriers  in  year  5.  Passenger  carrier  and  bulk  HM  operations  have  the 

highest  potential  for  societal  damages  and  therefore  might  reasonably  be  put  first  in  any  new 

safety rule.  For all other property carrying operations, the largest carriers would be subject to an 

EOBR  mandate  first  because  they  are  best  able  to  absorb  the  costs  of these  devices,  whereas 

small business  might be disadvantaged by simultaneous implementation,  and therefore  could be 

required to install these devices in year five. 

Tables  36 and 37  show the number of LH and SH CMVs  and drivers  that would be affected by 

the rule during each year.

These  counts  of drivers  and  CMV s  are  applied  to  evaluate  the  annualized  incremental  costs  of 

benefits  of  each  option  in  each  year,  that  is,  the  monetized  values  associated  only  to  those 

operations  added to  the EOBR mandate in each year.  These amounts  are  then summed to total 

annualized costs and benefits. 

G.l  Derivation of Option 1 Costs and Benefits, Five-Year Implementation

G.3 

Derivation of Option 3 Costs and Benefits, Five-Year Implementation 

Option 3 merely  adds  the SH operations  that  are  exempt from  RODS  to  year 5 of the Option 2 
implementation schedule.  As  shown in table 44,  EOBR use  in these  types  of operations results 

in  no  paperwork  reduction  and  very  small  safety  benefits.  The  addition  of these  operations 
results in an incremental annualized net benefit of -$174 million.

Appendix H  Derivation of Cost and Benefits in the HOS Rule Analyses 

Most  of the  content  of this  Appendix has  been taken  verbatim from  the  RIAs  prepared  for  the 

2003  and  2005  HOS  rules.  This  appendix  provides  detail  about  FMCSA's  methodology  for 

estimating costs  and benefits.  FMCSA has  not undertaken a comprehensive survey of drivers to 

measure the level  of noncompliance with the  HOS  rules  since enactment of the  2003  HOS  rule. 

The  Agency does  not  attempt  to  directly  measure  the  costs  and  benefits  of the  increased  HOS 

compliance that is  expected with the adoption of EOBRs.  Instead, FMCSA starts with the level 

of noncompliance that was  found  when drivers  were surveyed prior to  2003.  Then the  Agency 

replicates  portions  of  the  analysis  that  was  performed  to  estimate  costs  and  benefits  of  the 

changes  in the 2003  and 2005 rules,  to  account for the changes  in the HOS rules  and changes in 

drivers'  compliance with the rules.  Most of the content of this  appendix has been taken from the 

RIAs prepared for the 2003 and 2005 rules. 

H.I 

Basis for 2003 Rule and Derivation of Pre-2003 Status Quo 

This  section summarizes  the survey data and analytical techniques used to evaluate the baseline 

level  of non-compliance  with  the  HOS  rules.  Survey  data  provided  information  on  drivers' 

actual  schedules,  which were than evaluated against schedules  that fully  complied with the pre-

2003  and 2003  HOS  rules.  Simulated adjustments were  made to  any schedules  that were found 

to  be non-compliant to  bring them to the minimal level of compliance.  These adjustments  were 

then  translated  into  a  redistribution  of hours  for  a  given  driver  and  across  drivers  to  estimate 

compliance costs and safety benefits. 

The  status  quo  level  of  compliance  was  derived  from  a  simulation  of  driver  work  and  rest 

schedules  calibrated with  data  from  two  driver  surveys.  After this  status  quo  was  established, 

FMCSA determined what changes to driver schedules would have to occur should 100 percent of 

non-compliant drivers move toward full  compliance with the pre-2003 HOS rules, and then what 

changes  would  occur if it  were  the  2003  HOS  rules  that drivers  were  complying  with.  Results 

for costs  and benefits for  the pre-2003  baseline and the effects  of the 2003  rules  are the starting 

points for the compliance cost and benefits calculations estimated in this rule.

H.1.1  Survey Data Used in Status Quo 

University of Michigan Trucking Industry Program (UMTIP) Driver Surveys (1997-1999), 
by Dale Belman et at., with the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research 

The  first  wave of the  UMTIP data collection  effort resulted  in  573  long  surveys  completed  by 

truck  drivers  at  19  mid-western  truck  stops  between  July  and  October  of  1997.  The  second 

phase  of the  driver  survey,  conducted  between  summer  1998  and  spring  1999,  used  the  same 

methodology and essentially the same  questions  at  12  truck stops  and increased the sample size 

to  over  1,019  valid  observations.  Truck  stops  were  chosen  based  on the  number of overnight 

parking  spaces  available,  which  gives  a  measure  of traffic  volume.  The  probability  sampling 

technique  employed  ensures  that  the  selected  truck  stops  match  the  distribution  of  overnight 

parking spaces by both state and size category.  A  potential respondent was  interviewed if he or 

she  reported  being  a  truck  driver,  possessed  a  Commercial  Drivers  License  (CDL)  and  was 

driving a tractor trailer at the time of the interview. 

The variables of interest contained in the UMTIP data set included hours spent sleeping, working 

and driving in the 24 hours leading up to the interview, hours worked in the last pay period,52 and 

detailed  variables  concerning the  timing  and/or  duration of activities  during  the  last  completed 

trip  (for  example,  waiting  for  a  dispatch,  loading/unloading,  or  driving).  For  descriptive 

statistics  and  cross-tabs,  FMCSA used  sample weights  to  account  for  sampling bias due to  the 
size of the truck stops selected as  survey 10cations.53 

In  cooperation  with  the  authors  of  the  UMTIP  driver  survey,  FMCSA  studied  customized 

statistical outputs for particular subsets of the population surveyed.  These subsets were designed 

to  match,  as  closely  as  possible  and  where  appropriate,  the  industry  segments  determined  to 

reflect the most relevant profile for the present regulatory impact analysis.  In particular, this data 

set  provided  several  useful  variables  on  driver  type  (owner-operator,  employee,  union,  non(cid:173)

union,  teams),  industry  segment  (for-hire,  private  carriage,  truckload  and  less-than-truckload), 

52  Drivers' responses pertaining to pay period were standardized to 7 days. 
53  Weights were constructed and used according to the procedures in Belman, D., Monaco, K, and Brooks, T. 
(1998). "Let it Be Palletized: A Portrait of Truck Drivers' Work and Lives," University of Michigan Trucking 
Industry Program.

range of operations (local, regional, LH) and size of firm,  which enabled comparative analyses of 

many different sub-groups of drivers.  For comparison with other data sets, it was useful to study 

miles driven in the past year and miles driven on a "typical run." 

The UMTIP driver survey provides  a representative picture of certain segments  of the regional 

and  LH OTR truck driver population.  The survey team did not intend to capture every aspect of 

the  trucking industry;  rather,  it was  the express  intent of the  authors  to  sample regional  and LH 

OTR truck drivers.  For example, the authors  clearly state that local pickup and delivery drivers 

are  underrepresented.  Analysis  of their  data  further  indicates  that  those  SH  drivers  are  not  a 

representative  sub-sample of the  SH population.  The survey design addressed  the  potential for 

bias  by applying  randomization techniques  to  the choice  of truck  stops,  the  choice of potential 

respondents,  the  day of the  week,  and  the  time of day.  Subsets  of the driver population,  to  the 

extent  possible,  were  analyzed  separately  to  ensure  that  dissimilar  subsets  were  not  grouped 

together.  Advantages of the UMTIP driver survey are that it captures  the  portion of the driving 

population  that  will  be  most  affected  by  the  proposed  regulations,  it  offers  a  rich  range  of 

information about its subjects, and its limitations are transparent. 

"Effects of Sleep Schedules on Commercial Motor Vehicle Driver Performance," 2000,  by 

Balkin et ale  (Walter-Reed Army Institute of Research) 

The  Walter  Reed  Commercial  Motor  Vehicle  field  study  gathered  sleep  patterns  via  wrist 

actigraphy and self-reported sleep logs  from  25  LH and 25  SH drivers  over two to three weeks. 

The data was  entered into the Walter Reed Sleep Performance Model.  Participants drivers  were 

recruited  through  flyers  at  truck  stops  and  through  word-of-mouth  and  were  required  to  hold  a 

commercial  drivers  license  (CDL).  SH  and  LH  drivers  were  differentiated  based  on  whether 

they were able to return home at the end of work periods to sleep. 

The  variables  of interest  in the Walter Reed  study  were the  date  of observation,  the time  spent 

on-duty and off-duty each day, and the time of day and duration of each sleep period.  This study 

represents  the  most  accurate  information  available  regarding  truckers'  exact  sleep  routines  by 

time of day.  This  study does  not suffer from  problems  of other datasets  that underestimate  the 

proportion  of  drivers  with  extreme  schedules  because  they  do  not  sufficiently  differentiate 

72 

among  types  of tmckers  or  their  differing  work  schedules  over the  past  7  days  by  aggregating 

tmckers'  schedules  were homogeneous  over time  and  across  groups.  Moreover,  with exception 

of  Walter  Reed,  most  studies  ask  subjects  for  their  subjective  view  of  how  much  they  are 

sleeping,  incremented  in  one-hour  units,  and  do  not  differentiate  between  time  in  bed  versus 

actual  sleep.  The  strength  of  the  WR  study  resides  in  the  precise  nature  of  its  sleep 

measurements and the fact that they were carried out over a relatively long period of time. 

H.l.2  Driver Schedule Simulation Methods and Results 

UMTIP provides  insufficient raw data to  completely enumerate driver schedules over time.  For 

instance,  the  UMTIP surveys  ask drivers  about hours  worked over the last 24  hours  rather than 

for  a  full  week  or  for  averages  over  time.  The  Walter  Reed  Field  Study  provided  more 

information across  days but is  a small sample that was  not randomly drawn and was  insufficient 

to  determine  whether  work/sleep  schedules  shift  under  current  or  other  proposal  options. 

FMCSA  gathered  descriptive  statistics  describing  the distribution  of schedule  types  from  these 

studies in order to model 25-day schedules representative of those found in the real world. 

In  order  to  model  representative  schedules,  the  Agency  first  estimated  the  distribution  across 

individuals  of average  number  of hours  worked  per  day  using  the  average  number  of hours 

worked  in  a  24-hour  period  for  LH  OTR  drivers  excluding  team drivers 54  from  UMTIP.  The 

average  number  of  hours  worked  is  required  because  the  relationship  between  tmckers' 

schedules  and sleep is  estimated and available only for  sleep with hours on-duty.  For modeling 

hours  worked  per  day,  a  large  distribution  of average  number  of hours  worked  per  day  was 

generated,  100  random  numbers,  with  mean  and  standard  deviation  values  taken  from  the 

UMTIP and Walter Reed data, to represent a distribution of average number of hours worked per 

day.  The random numbers  are drawn from a normal distribution with a mean value equal to  the 

mean  number  of hours  worked  per  24-hour  period  for  LH  OTR  drivers  from  UMTIP  (11.37 

hours per day).  The standard deviation of the random numbers is  equal to the standard deviation 

across  LH drivers  in the Walter Reed Field Study of their average number of hours  worked per 

S4  Team drivers are less likely to be affected by the rule changes, and were not modeled. 

73 

day  (1.88  hours).55  Rather  than  model  100  separate  schedules  with  only  slight  differences  in 

average  length of work  day,  the  analysis  groups  them into  four  bins  representing  average  work 

day  lengths  around  9,  11,  13,  and  15  hours  on-duty on average  in  a  24-hour period  (excluding 

full  days  off-duty).  These bin values  are  chosen to  divide the distribution such  that the  middle 

two  values  (11  and  13)  represent  about  a  third  of  the  distribution  under  current  compliance 
levels,  with the remainder divided  about equally between the other two  values.56  This  provides 
the average number of hours worked per 24-hour period worked for the current HOS  rules under 

current compliance (status quo scenario). 

Next,  average  number  of hours  worked  per  24-hour  period  is  used  to  simulate  the  number  of 

hours worked per eight-day work period under the pre-2003  HOS rules.  This is  derived from the 

frequency  distribution  from  UMTIP  of  number  of  days  worked  in  the  last  seven-day  pay 
period.57  Interviews  with  industry  experts  indicate  that most OTR LH drivers  follow  an eight(cid:173)
day work schedule.  In order to make this distribution based on seven-days apply to the pre-2003 

compliance  baseline,  the  UMTIP  distribution  is  scaled  up  from  days  worked  in  seven  days  to 

days worked in eight days.  Because the mean, median, and modal OTR driver worked five days 

in  the  seven-day  period,  it  is  assumed  that,  from  each  group,  five  of every  seven  would  work 
another day in an eight-day period.58  The majority of drivers in the resulting distribution worked 
five to eight of the last eight days.  Those who  work four or fewer days  in eight are not expected 

to  be affected by changes  in HOS  rules.  The analysis  is  simplified by reducing the  number of 

schedules  to  model  by combining into one bin those who worked four  or fewer days  within the 

eight-day period.  This  group,  modeled as  working three days  in eight,  represents  12  percent of 

the trucker population. Table 45 displays the original distribution of workweek lengths as well as 

55  This figure excludes days  in which the driver was on-duty for fewer than two hours. The UMTIP was preferred 
for the average number of hours  worked per day due to  its larger sample size combined with its more random 
sampling approach. 
56  Nine hours is approximately the average number of hours  worked in 24-hours for truckers modeled as having 
worked up to  10.5 or fewer hours on average.  Eleven hours is  approximately the average number of hours  worked 
in 24-hours for truckers modeled as having worked  10.5  up to  12 hours on average.  Thirteen hours is  approximately 
the average number of hours worked in 24-hours for truckers modeled as having worked  12 up to  14 hours on 
average, and  15  hours is  approximately the average number of hours worked in 24-hours for truckers modeled as 
having worked  14 or more hours on average. 
57  This distribution is  based on only those OTR drivers  who reported fewer than 24 hours of combined work and 
sleep. 
58  There is no  evidence of a negative correlation of number of days  worked across  weeks.  For this reason, it is 
assumed that the number of days  worked in the seven-day period covered in the survey represents the average for 
the respective proportion of the trucker population.

No information is  available in UMTIP to estimate directly the proportion of the driver population 

by both hours  worked  in  24  hours  and the  number of days  worked.  The  proportion of drivers 

who  worked  on  average  around  nine,  11,  13,  or  15  hours  in  24-hours  is  multiplied  by  the 

proportion who worked three, five,  six,  seven, or eight days  in an eight-day schedule.  This does 

not account for possible negative correlation between these two variables, but although this  is  no 

evidence  of a  strong  negative  relationship. 59  The  matrix  of proportions  of truckers  working 

various  hours-per-day  and  days-per-eight  has  been  termed  the  "driver  schedule  proportion 

matrix" and any individual cell within the matrix a "driver proportion cell."  The driver schedule 

proportion  matrix  is  generated  first  to  reflect  current  compliance  levels  with  HOS  rules.  This 

matrix  is  shown for the status  quo  in table 46.  The percentages  in the cell that represents  three 

days  of work  in  an  eight-day period  and  nine hours  of work  in  24  is  simply the  product  of 12 

percent and 14 percent, or 2 percent.

59  Walter Reed field study LH driver data revealed a small negative correlation of -0.05 between hours worked 
and days worked in a seven-day period.  This would translate into a difference of less than a third of a day shorter 
workweek for those averaging  15  hours of work per day than those averaging 9 hours per day.

The  proportion  matrix  was  adjusted  to  show  fully  compliant  schedules  under  the  different 

numbers  of hours  worked  per  week  allowed  under the  pre-2003  and  2003  HOS  rules.  Driver 

proportion  cells  were  truncated  to  reflect  daily  and  weekly  limits  allowed  under  current  HOS 

rules.  That  is,  if a  group  of drivers  work  too  many  hours  per day  or  week,  those  drivers  are 

added to a cell that complies with HOS  rules.  Driver proportion cells that allow too many hours 

per  day  are  carried down  to  the  cell  with  the  next  lower number of hours  that  meets  the  daily 

limits. 

If the  total  number  of hours  per  week  worked  for  that  driver  proportion  cell  remains 

above that allowed under a given HOS  rule option, hours worked per day are reduced within the 

same number of days  per eight-day period by shifting the proportion in that cell to the  cell with 

the next lower number of hours per day working.  If the cell already is  in the nine hours of work 

per 24-hours cell and still is  over the threshold, the proportion of hours  in that cell is  shifted to a 

cell in which drivers work fewer days per week. 

H.I.3  Rolling Work and Sleep Schedules 

The  modeled  runs  from  a dispatching simulation are  used to  predict  the  extent  to  which,  under 

the pre-2003  and 2003  HOS  rules,  drivers'  primary sleeping time (and,  thus,  their whole  sleep(cid:173)

work cycle) steadily moves, or rolls, over a series of days or remains fixed over time. 

H.1.3.1  Dispatching Simulation 

The following table summarizes the results of the dispatch simulations. The numbers in the cells 

in the  table  are  index  measures  that  reflect relative productivity of drivers  and  are  different  for 

the for-hire and private cases.  In the for-hire case, the index reflects both number of loads moved 

76 

and  length  of  haul.  Changing  HOS  rules  affects  both  the  number  of  loads  carried  and  the 

distances  covered  by  a for-hire,  truckload  company.  If such  a  company can make  longer hauls 

with  a given  set  of resources,  it  is  likely that  it  will;  longer  moves  for  the  same  tonnage  mean 

more revenue.  In the real world, a company might use fewer resources to carry the same number 

of loads the same distance in response to less restrictive HOS rules. Either response would reflect 

the  same  productivity  gain.  Simulation  analyses  of  for-hire  operations  use  a  fixed  level  of 

resources, so the output vary with a change to the HOS rules. 

The for-hire  index is  a composite,  weighted one-third according to  loads  moved per vehicle and 

two-thirds  according  to  distance  moved  per vehicle.  Productivity  measures  based  on  delivered 

orders  per driver per  week  and  miles  per driver per week can differ  somewhat  if the  length  of 

haul  differs  under different options.  After reviewing the factors  that would cause the  length of 

haul to vary, and the relative contributions of driving to non-driving activities to producing value 

for  shippers,  FMCSA  developed  a  composite  measure  of productivity  that  weights  miles  per 

driver per week twice  as  heavily as  orders per driver per week.  This  weighting scheme,  which 

was  not  intended  to  be  precise,  was  based  roughly  on  the  ratio  of driving  time  to  non-driving 

time for a LH truckload shipment. 

Selection  of private-carriage  scenarios  posed  some  problems.  One  can  postulate  a  set  of basic 

patterns  for  private-carriage  operations,  but  there  is  no  empirical  basis  for  allocating  shares  of 

private-carriage activity among various patterns. Nor is  it possible to specify a set of patterns and 

assert that they account for all, or almost all,  of private movement.  The analysis focused on just 

two  private  scenarios,  the  "national  one-to-few"  case  and  the  "regional  one-to-many."  The 

national  one-to-few case  could be  a manufacturer shipping from  one  factory  to  a few  regional(cid:173)

hub distribution centers (DCs) from which large numbers of stores or other DCs are served.  The 

regional-hub  DCs  might be owned  by the  manufacturer or by its  customers.  The one-to-many 

case may be thought of as one of those regional DCs, shipping on to stores andlor lower-tier DCs 

as  the  case  may be.  In the  private cases,  output is  fixed  and  variation  in  the  level  of resources 

used  to  produce  that  output  is  captured.  Most  of that  variation  takes  the  form  of more  or  less 

intensive  use  of the  same  set of tractors  and  drivers.  The  index  reflects  the  number  of loads  a 

driver could deliver in a standardized, fully employed week.

Estimates  of total  vehicle  miles  of travel  for  truckload  and  private  carriers  and  numbers  of 

drivers,  presented  elsewhere,  are  used  to  convert  these  productivity  changes  into  costs  (or 

benefits) of rule changes. It would be incorrect, however, to use these index numbers directly for 

that  purpose.  Not  all  companies  have  operations  that  are  always  pressing  against  HOS  limits; 

many do not,  as  indicated by anecdotal  evidence  and  from  the findings  from  the UMTIP driver 

survey of hours  actually worked.  The impacts on for-hire  TL were scaled back to 46  percent of 

the  result  from  direct  application  of  these  indices  and  to  35  percent  in  the  case  of private 

carriage.  The difference in these percentages simply reflects the fact that TL operations are more 

likely to be pushing against the HOS rules than are private operations. 

H.1.3.2  Results of Rolling Work and Sleep Schedule Analysis 

The total  change in time of day between the  beginning and  end of a working week schedule at 

which an OTR driver begins his  or her sleeping break period was  calculated.  For example,  if a 

driver begins a route at 8 am on the first day of the route and ends  at 4 am on the last day of the 

route  before  an  extended  (multiple-day)  break,  the  schedule  is  calculated  to  have  rolled 

backwards  by  four  hours.  The  threshold  at  which  a  schedule  qualifies  as  having  work-sleep 

cycles  that  rolled  is  a  difference  of  at  least  two  hours  over  a  route  for  a  backward-rolling 

schedule  and  three  hours  over  a  route  for  a  forward-rolling  schedule.  Preliminary  analysis 

suggested that less than two-hour change in sleeping time over a driving route was insufficient to 

result in a significant change in modeled schedules.  Because initial tests  of the model  indicated 

that a schedule that rolls  forward  adds  about two-thirds of the incremental crash probability as  a 

schedule rolling backwards, the forward-rolling threshold was set to an equivalent to three hours. 

78 

The  likelihood  of  rolling  was  analyzed  separately  for  the  pre-2003  rules  relative  to  full 

compliance  and  the  2003  rules,  and  for  regional  and  LH  operations.  The  number  of hours  a 

schedule rolls was also measured separately in order to down-weight schedules that roll for fewer 

hours than modeled. 

For the current rule fully enforced, the analysis found three of 13  regional schedules and seven of 

11  LH to  shift.  The majority of these were rolling backwards.  The regional schedules rolled on 

average  two  hours  and  the  LH  over  ten  hours  over the  driving  period.  These  driving  periods 

varied  in  their  length  depending  on  the  limits  for  each  proposal  and  trip  lengths  for  the  driver 

types. 

FMCSA  assumed  that the  proportion of OTR  drivers  is  split evenly  between  regional 

and  LH  companies  and  combine  the  calculated  proportion  of regional  and  LH  drivers  whose 

schedules roll into an overall weighted average.  That is, even though it is not expected that all of 

the  drivers  with  sleeping  times  that  roll  to  shift  by  a  total  of  10  hours,  the  modeling  uses  a 

weighted proportion that would be equivalent to the proportion whose sleep periods  would shift 

backwards by ten hours.  For the current rule fully enforced, the result is  a weighted average of 

34 percent of drivers rolling backwards an average of 10 hours (given a five-day route).  For the 
2003 rules, two of eight regional schedules and seven of ten LH roll backwards.6o

Compliance Costs 

This  section  summarizes  the  results  of  applying  the  analysis  of driver  schedules  to  costs  of 

achieving full  compliance  with  HOS  rules.  Additional  drivers  (and  CMVs)  will  be have  to  be 

added to shift work away from over-utilized drivers, which entail additional labor, overhead, and 

capital  costs.  The  analysis  also  examined  the  total  labor  pool  available  to  the  motor  carrier 

industry,  not  just  the  driver  population,  and  concluded  that  there  was  sufficient  numbers  of 

workers  available  to  shift  into  CMV  driver jobs.  Given  the  current  under-employment  in blue 

collar occupations, the Agency believes this conclusion still holds. 

Compliance costs  with the  HOS  rules  are  those  costs  associated with  changes  that  carriers  will 

need  to  make  to  their  operations  to  achieve  full  compliance  with  the  HOS  rules.  Non(cid:173)

compliance  is  the  result  of over-utilization of both  drivers  and  CMV s  beyond  what  is  allowed 

under the HOS rules.  Assuming carriers maintain the same level of work, additional drivers and 

equipment will have to be acquired to complete these loads without exceeding the HOS limits. 

H.2.1  Labor Cost Changes 

This  section  discusses  the  issues  related  to  the  truck  driver  labor  supply  and  the  methodology 

used for the labor cost changes.  Compliance with HOS  rules are expected to result in changes in 

labor  productivity  for  truck  drivers,  leading  to  changes  in  driver  labor  demand.  The  analysis 

uses  the  changes  in  labor  productivity  obtained  from  simulations  of  trucking  routes  for  the 

various options and translates  them to dollar impacts based on the labor supply relationships for 

truck drivers. 

Issues related to the truck driver wage equation, as a function of job and employee characteristics 

are  discussed  first,  followed  by  a  discussion  of the  labor  supply  elasticity  for  truck  drivers. 

Components  of  the  indirect  labor  costs  that  are  associated  with  driver  wage  costs  are  also 

analyzed to complete the discussion on various aspects of the labor cost changes. 

H.2.1.1 

Estimate of Driver Wage Function 

80 

To  analyze  the  labor  costs  of  the  different  options,  the  Agency  examined  the  relationship 

between hours worked and wages earned for  truck drivers.  The issue of individual driver wages 

is  important because it  is  one dimension of the cost of the  HOS  regulations.  As  hours  of work 

are  shifted  from  drivers  who  currently  work  very  long  hours  to  newly  hired  drivers,  the  cost 

implications  for  carriers  depends  on  the  employment  costs  per  additional  hour  of  work  by 

existing drivers relative to the costs for new hires. 

H.2.1.1.1  Data, Methodology, and Results 

The  primary  data  source  for  the  analyses  carried  out  in  the  following  section  is  the  Current  ' 

Population Survey (CPS),  a household based  survey conducted by the  BLS  every month.  This 

2003  HOS  RIA uses  annual  CPS  data compiled by the  National  Bureau of Economic Research 

(NBER) that give earnings and hours  worked for  a randomly chosen sample.  FMCSA combine 

annual data from  1995 to 2000 and model the wage equation for non-union truck drivers only. 

The wage equation was  estimated for  truck drivers based on their demographic  information and 

job characteristics.  It was hypothesized that the  wage earned by truck drivers  depends  on their 
hours  worked61

,  along  with  their  occupational  experience,  and  dummy  variables  to  capture 

whether  they  are  high  school  graduates,  married,  sex,  race,  whether  they  are  in  the  for-hire 

industry,  as  well  as  dummies  to  control  for  year  and  regional  effects.  The  details  of all  the 

variables used in the regression, including descriptive statistics and the estimated coefficients are 

presented in table 49.

All the variables of interest have the expected signs and most are statistically significant (except 

for  some  of  the  region  and  year  control  dummies)62.  Of  particular  importance  are  the 

coefficients  associated  with  the  two  hours  worked  variables  and  the  distribution  of  wages 

implied. 

Table 50 presents predicted wages for different levels of weekly hours  worked for the sample on 

non-union truck drivers  only.  Based on the total  wage relationship,  the  model  predicts  that the 

average  50  hour/week  driver  earns  $28,307,  a  60  hour/week  driver  makes  $33,588  and  a  70 

hour/week driver makes $38,022 annually.

Hours Worked  Per Week 

The  results  indicate  that  the  total  annual  wages  for  drivers  is  an  increasing  function  of hours 

worked that increases  at  a decreasing rate.  This  implies that the  marginal  cost to the firm  of an 

additional  hour  of  driver  labor  diminishes  constantly  as  the  hours  of  work  increases.  The 

specific  shape  of the  total  wage  curve  also  ensures  that  the  average  wage  curve  is  below  the 

marginal wage for a significant part of the distribution. 

The  downward  slope of the marginal  cost curve implies  that as  the number of hours  worked by 

drivers under the HOS rules are curtailed, the cost savings to companies from cutting down hours 

of service from  drivers  is  less  than the  increase in  cost due  to  the hiring of new drivers,  that is, 

giving an  hour of work to a new driver costs more than the savings from taking an hour of  . 

work  away  from  an  over  utilized  driver  who  would  exceed  the  HOS  limits.  Another 

implication of the  slope of the  marginal  wage  curve  is  that  every hour of driver  labor does  not 

cost  the  same  for  the  trucking  company.  This  is  because  of the  "non-standard"  labor-leisure 

choice faced by truck drivers.  While they are on the road, they are willing to work an extra hour 

for  a  lower  marginal  wage  (and  cost  to  the  firm),  to  maximize  their  earnings  potential,  in  part 

because the value of leisure time out on the road is  low.  As  drivers  work more and more hours, 

84 

the shape of the marginal wage curve implies that the cost to the firm for the extra hours declines 

gradually. 

H.2.1.2 

Supply of Drivers 

Another aspect of the labor costs of the different HOS  options  is  related to the issue of the labor 

supply curve in the market for truck drivers.  The shape of the labor supply curve determines the 

impact that changes  in labor demand would have on the  wage rates for truck drivers,  and this  is 

expressed  as  the  elasticity  of labor  supply.  As  discussed,  there  is  evidence  in  the  literature  to 

suggest that trucking is  a very competitive industry with relatively free entry and exit and that its 

market labor supply curve is  quite elastic.  This  is  because trucking is  considered a low-skill job 

with relatively low fixed  costs.  A small change in labor demand from  additional drivers needed 

for full compliance with the HOS rules will not lead to any substantial changes in wage rates. 

H.2.1.2.1  Previous Studies 

Rose  (1987)  contends  that the truck  driver  labor supply  curve,  especially for  the  non-union  TL 

sector  should  be  highly  elastic.  This  is  because  "truck  driving  is  a  low-skill  occupation  with 

considerable turnover."  She also discusses the fact that there is  a large pool of drivers outside of 

the regulated  interstate trucking  industry who  perform the  same  type  of job - owner-operators, 

private carriage drivers and delivery drivers.  She argues  thus  that the labor supply curve should 

be highly elastic for  this  occupation as  a  whole.  Hirsch  (1988)  also  makes  the  same argument 

that truck driver labor supply is  likely to  be highly elastic,  given the fact  that  it  is  considered a 
low-skilled job.  Enge163  (1998)  argues  that the  high turnover rate  in trucking,  especially in the 

TL sector,  indicates  that this  occupation has  a highly elastic labor supply curve and provides an 

easy entry to  new truck drivers.  The author further argues  that these high rates  of turnover also 

indicate  that  trucking  is  a  job  that  is  difficult  to  perform  over  extended  periods.  There  is 

evidence  in  the  literature  that  the  trucking  industry,  especially  the  TL  sector,  suffers  from 

significant driver shortage.  The details about how this can potentially impact the issue of market 

labor supply are discussed below. 

63  Cynthia Engel.  "Competition Drives the Trucking Industry".  Monthly Labor Review, April  1998. 

85 

Other studies that looked at the issue of labor supply elasticity in general (not for trucking only) 

have  come up  with  estimates  ranging between 2 and  5.  (See for  e.g.,  Lettau (1994),  Eberts  and 

Stone  (1992».  These  studies  introduce  a  spatial  dimension  to  the  analysis  by  looking  at  local 

labor markets and therefore are not directly comparable to the analysis here.  Nevertheless, these 
estimates provide a "benchmark" for labor supply elasticity values.  Lettau64
that  empirical  studies  that  look  at  local  area  labor  demand-labor supply  relationships,  find  that 
"an area's elasticity of labor supply is  between 2.0 and  5.0."  Eberts  and Stone65  use a recursive 
model  to  identify the  labor  supply  and  demand  relationships  in  local  labor markets  using  CPS 

,  for example, argues 

data.  They find a labor supply elasticity of 4.9 using a five-period lag structure. 

H.2.1.2.2  Evidence from Industry Data 

Analysis  of historical  employment  data  on  truck  drivers  confirms  the  view  held  by experts  on 

this  industry that the market labor supply for  truck drivers  is  relatively elastic.  Table 51  shows 

the  pattern  of employment  and  annual  earnings  of truck  drivers  in  the  economy from  1983  to 

2000, based on CPS  data.  Although driver employment has  grown close to a million from  1983 

to 2000 (a growth rate of about 40 percent), growth in real wages for drivers has  not been nearly 

that  dramatic.  In  fact,  real  wages,  in 2000 dollars,  have  grown less  than  one-half of a  percent 

during the same period.

H.2.1.2.3  The Pool of Available Truck Drivers 

Wage  elasticity  for  new  drivers  should  ideally  be  considered  in  the  context  of potential  truck 

drivers.  Since  hiring  new  drivers  would  mean  shifting  or  attracting  workers  from  other 

competing  sectors  to  trucking,  the  Agency  analyzed  the  existing  labor  pool  for  blue-collar 

workers  to  see  where  the  new  drivers  could  come  from.  Table  52  gives  the  number  of blue(cid:173)

collar  workers  in  some  of the  industries  that  could  supply  additional  truck  drivers  needed  to 

comply with the new rules.

The data in the above table indicate that truck drivers  account for about 5 to 6 percent of a total 
blue-collar population.66  Most of the occupations listed above can be considered similar to truck 

driving in terms of attracting people.  This is  one reason to believe that there is  a large labor pool 

of blue-collar workers  from  which  to  attract potential  new  truck drivers  as  a  result  of the  HOS 

options.  This fact,  coupled with the historical trends on wage movements, suggests that changes 

in  labor  demand  would  not  lead  to  substantial  wage  effects  due  to  the  high  labor  supply 

elasticity. 

Some  analysts  believe  the  high  turnover  rates  in  this  industry  are  not  driven  by a  shortage  of 

drivers.  According to  a study done by the Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute (UGPTI)67 

in  1990,  and  quoted  in  a  report on "What Matters  to Drivers,,68  published in  1997,  the  trucking 

industry does not suffer from a "shortage of drivers" to hire from.  The study claims the fact that 

this  industry  has  been  able  to  sustain  such  high  driver  turnover  rates  over  the  years  is  an 

indication that the problem is  not one of labor shortage, but a lack of human resource strategy to 

take advantage of the available driver pool. 

Also,  the  truck  driver  population  in  the  U.S.  under  the  current  conditions  is  predominantly 

middle-aged  white  males.  The  average  age  of drivers  in the  CPS  sample  is  39  years  (for both 

males  and  females),  with  96  percent  of the  population  being  male.  However,  according  to  a 

66  The definition of blue-collar workers is broader than that used by BLS to  include occupations that can 
potentially supply new truck drivers.

,  females,  non-whites  (or  minorities)  and  those  that 

have  less  than  15  years  of experience  most  likely  see  trucking  as  a  good  occupational  choice. 

There is  a growing segment of the labor force  that has remained untapped to increase the pool of 

drivers. 

Improving  the  working  conditions  of  drivers  and  making  their  job  characteristics 

consistent with other competing occupations  would be one way to  attract this  previously unused 

portion of the labor force. 

H.2.1.2.4  Turnover and its  Impact on Driver Labor 

Another issue that is  related to  this  and  could have  a potential  impact on labor supply is  that of 

turnover.  Evidence  suggests  that this  industry,  particularly the  TL sector,  has  been plagued by 

very high rates of turnover. 70 

The Gallup study argues that between 1994 and 2005, the industry will need to hire an additional 

403,000 drivers/year (even before new HOS).  Of these, about 320,000 (or 80 percent) would be 

because  of  "churning"  or  internal  turnover,  drivers  leaving  one  company  to  go  to  another, 

because  of their  dissatisfaction  with  the  present job  and  pay.  Another  34,000  (or  8  percent) 

would  be  needed  to  account  for  growth  in  the  industry.  And  the  remaining  48,000  (or  12 

percent) would be needed because of attrition, retirement and external turnover. 

The study also notes five  specific job attributes that can predict overall job satisfaction for truck 

drivers: 71 

Steadiness of work (i.e., consistent driving assignments) 
Genuine care of managers for their drivers 
Pay 
Support from company while on the road, and 
Number of hours of work. 

Any improvement in the work schedules of drivers that makes it comparable to other competing

occupations  could  reduce  driver  turnover.  Pay  structure  is  also  important.  Since  pay  is  also 

listed as  an important reason for the lack of satisfaction, any changes in the rules that results in a 

reduction  in  pay for  drivers  could  increase  driver  turnover.  Thus  the  net  effect of better  work 

schedules and lower overall wages is unknown. 

Based on the issues  discussed above and the evidence from previous literature and data on truck 

driver labor supply,  the  Agency assume  a labor supply elasticity of 5 to  measure the  impact on 

wages  as  a  result  of a  change  in  demand  for  drivers.  An  elasticity  of 5  is  consistent  with  the 

view held by industry analysts that trucking is  a fairly low-skill,  easy entry job.  Although there 

seem to  be  very limited research on truck driver's  market labor  supply models  that  are  directly 

relevant for  the 2003  HOS  analysis,  an elasticity measure of 5 is  reasonable.  Changes  in  labor 

demand due to compliance with HOS rules should not have large impacts on wage rates. 

H.2.l.3 

Summary of Labor Cost Assumptions 

Using  the  methodology  discussed  above,  labor  costs  of  compliance  with  HOS  rules  are 

calculated separately for LH and SH.  Using the labor productivity changes for these segments as 

inputs, FMCSA calculated the changes in the driver population that would be needed to maintain 

the same VMT.  Then, using the relationships derived from the labor supply curve for individual 

truck drivers,  as  well  as  for  the  market  labor supply,  the  avoided  (from reducing hours  of over 

utilized drivers) and new (from giving hours to new drivers) labor costs and the overhead.

H.2.2  Non-Wage Costs 

A  change  in  the  number  of  drivers  required  to  conduct  trucking  activity  requires  a 

90 

complementary  change  in  the  fleet  Size  and  supporting  infrastructure.  FMCSA  identified 

methods  for  estimating  the  cost  of  new  power  units,  trailers,  and  parking  spaces,  and 

maintenance  and  insurance  costs  of  this  equipment  based  on  a  review  of  the  literature  and 

relevant databases,  as  well as  on the  conclusions of its  industry experts.  It was  assumed that no 

new  docking  facilities  or  change  in  mileage-based  costs  occurs  since  no  direct  change  in  the 

number of deliveries  or in VMT  is  assumed,  that  is  the  amount of total  work conducted by the 

trucking industry is held as fixed. 

H.2.2.1 

Trucking Equipment 

The  method used to  estimate the change  in the  number of tractors  and  trailers  incorporates  two 

countervailing impacts from the change in labor productivity.  The first is  the obvious change in 

the  number  of trucks  associated  with  the  incremental  change  in  the  number  of drivers.  The 

second  has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  a  change  in  the  number  of tractors  and  trailers,  under  an 

assumption  of  no  direct  change  in  overall  fleet  VMT,  changes  the  life  of the  entire  fleet  of 

tractors and trailers, including the life of newly purchased trucks.  For example, consider the case 

of lower labor productivity requiring more drivers  and,  hence, tractors  and trailers.  The existing 

fleet  is  now driving less to  maintain the same VMT,  meaning that the average life of each truck 

is  longer.  On average,  this  will  translate into lower vehicle replacement based on the  change in 

the number of trucks relative to the initial fleet. 

For purposes of illustration, the preceding example will be worked through a representative case 

in  which  10,000  new  drivers  are  hired  by  trucking  companies  in  response  to  lower  labor 

productivity,  where  the  initial  fleet  size  is  1,500,000  drivers.  Table  54  summarizes  the  key 

assumptions  used  in the  analysis.  FMCSA assessed and incorporated a number of assumptions 

made by National Economic Research Associates (NERA)72 (2001). 

The  change  in  motor  vehicle  expenditures  has  two  implications  for  the  economy  that  are 

estimated  for  purposes  of  conducting  the  regional  economic  analysis.  First,  the  direct

Safety Administration's Economic Analysis for its Proposed Hours of Service Standard."  Prepared for the 
American Trucking Association by National Economic Research Associates (NERA).  August 3. 

91 

expenditures on equipment are estimated based on the starting year of the policy, the anticipated 

reaction time by trucking firms,  and the anticipated life of assets  adjusted for the change in fleet 

size.  Second, the assumption is  made that firms  will not simply bear the  swings  in capital costs 

in each year.  Instead, firms  will finance the costs over the amortization schedule at a reasonable 

weighted-average cost of capital. 

The  money  to  cover these  transactions  is  assumed  to  come  from  personal  consumption  in  the 

regional  economic  framework. 

In  year  1 of an  amortization  schedule,  consumers  provide  the 

cash  to  cover  the  change  in  purchases  of new  vehicles,  net  of the  first  year's  principal  and 

interest payments.  In  subsequent years,  consumers  receive  the  remaining principal  and  interest 

payments  associated  with  the  original  loan  in  the  first  year.  The  principal  and  interest  costs 

represent an increase in the production costs facing trucking-related sectors in the economy.

Returning to the example,  the steps  involved in estimating the changes  in the demand for motor 

73  NERA evaluated ratios of trucks to drivers based on estimates of 1.14 from an ATA Driver Comparison Study 
(August 2000), an ATA survey of members at  1.18, and a study by Belzer, Michael, Hours of Service Impact 
Assessment, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, March 5,  1999. 
74  NERA evaluated truck valuations and expected lives based on information from Martin Labbe Associates and 
an AT A report of costs between $60,000 and $150,000 per truck.  The Agency revised up to $95,000 per tractor 
based on discussions with its  industry experts.

Parking Space Construction and Maintenance 

A  change  in  the  number  of tractor-trailer  sets  will  require  that  additional  parking  spaces  be 

available at terminals.  The construction and maintenance of new parking spaces requires both an 

up-front capital expenditure in the first year followed by annual maintenance costs in subsequent 

years.  The capital expenditures will be capitalized and amortized as  a cost to the trucking sector 

with  financing  assumed  to  be  substituted  for  personal  consumption  as  with  equipment 

expenditures.  Unlike trucks,  no  off-setting change in the life of existing parking spaces  occurs, 

because  the  life  of a  parking  space  is  expected  to  be  longer  than  the  lO-year  horizon  under 

consideration in this analysis. 

The assumptions used in the analysis  are documented in table 55.  Information on parking space 

requirements  for  tractor-trailer  sets  was  taken  from  the  National  Association  of  Truck  Stop 

Owners  (NATSO)  and  for  auto  parking  spaces  from  International  Parking  Institute  (IPI). 

Maintenance  costs  for  auto  spaces  were  assumed  to  occur  at  the  same  ratio  as  truck  space 

maintenance to capital cost. 

Not  all  new  tractor-trailer  sets  will  be  at  the  terminal  at  any  given  point  in  time,  where 

Terminal_Max  summarizes  the  proportion  of additional  spaces  to  sets.  In  addition  to  parking 

spaces  for new  tractor-trailer sets,  additional spaces must be constructed for new drivers  to  park 

at truck stops, rest areas, or terminals while en route.  The ratio of new drivers parking at work to 

new  tractor-trailer  sets  is  accounted  for  in  variable  TerminaCTD.  The  installation  and 

maintenance costs are estimated based on the following steps.

Insurance 

Additional  tractor-trailer  sets  have  value  whether  they  are  on  the  road  or  not.  Though 

incremental'insurance costs are predominantly associated with changes in the VMT, a portion of 

the  insurance  cost  is  associated  with  the  intrinsic  value  of  the  change  in  the  capital  stock 

represented  by  the  change  in  the  number  of tractor-trailer  sets.  NERA  estimated  a  value  of 

$2,549  per new  driver per year  in  insurance  costs  based on AT A  data,  and  the  2003  HOS  rule 
analysis  used  this  estimate. 78 

Industry  experts  estimated  that  perhaps  25%  of  this  cost  is 

associated  with  the  intrinsic  value  of the  truck,  and  is  therefore  a  fixed  cost  per  CMV.  The 

remainder  is  assumed  to  be  variable  with  changes  in  VMT.  FMCSA  assumed  that  no  direct 

change  will  occur  in  the  variable  portion  of insurance  costs  since  overall  VMT  is  assumed  to 

remain the  same.  The end result is  a change of $637.25 per driver per year,  or,  $6.3725  million 

per year. 

H.2.2.4  Maintenance 

Analogous  to  the  issue  of  insurance,  additional  tractor-trailer  sets  require  some  regular 

maintenance  whether  they  are  on  the  road  or  not.  Though  incremental  maintenance  costs  are 

predominantly  associated  with  changes  in  the  VMT,  a  portion  of  the  maintenance  cost  is 

associated with regular safety inspections  and other routine,  scheduled maintenance represented 

by the change in the number of tractor-trailer sets.  Industry experts  estimated a value of $8,500 

per  new  tractor-trailer  per  year  in  maintenance  costs  and  that  perhaps  25%  of  this  cost  is 

78  Based on data from Motor Carrier Financial and Operating Statistics,  1998. 

96 

associated with fixed maintenance costs per truck.  The remainder is  assumed to  be variable with 

changes  in VMT.  The portion of the maintenance cost associated with new trucks is  negated by 

changes  in  VMT  in  the  rest  of the  fleet  to  yield  no  direct  net  change  in  VMT,  and,  hence,  no 

change  in  the  variable  portion of maintenance costs.  The end  result  is  a change  of $2,125  per 

truck per year, or $21.25 million per year. 

H.2.2.5 

Recruitment 

The need for more or fewer drivers will have an impact on recruitment costs  associated with the 

hiring  of new  drivers.  Rodriquez,  et  al.  (1998),79  surveyed  15  LH,  for-hire  trucking  firms  to 

determine  the  average  costs  associated  with  driver turnover,  or chum.  The  study estimated an 

average  cost to  firms  of $5,423,  as  summarized  by  cost  category  in  the  first  three  columns  of 

table 56.  The Agency excluded the costs and profits from idle equipment and the production loss 

due  to  chum  since  equipment  costs  are  explicitly  modeled  and  VMT  is  assumed  to  remain 

constant.  It also  assumed  that  75%  of the  advertising  and  staff labor costs  are  based on fixed 

annual budgets, where only 25%  is  variable based on the change in number of new drivers  to  be 

recruited.  Firms  are  likely  to  have  exhausted  the  most  important  marketing  channels  to  them 

given  the  high  industry  chum  rate.  Administrative  support  (Staff  Labor)  is  assumed  to  be 

characterized by  a high  degree  of automation,  with  the  25%  assumption used  to  cover the fact 

that some back-office recruiting labor was  included in this category by Rodriquez, et al.  The rest 

of the  costs  are  assumed to  be fully  variable  with  a change  in the  number of new  drivers.  The 

result  is  an  incremental  cost  of $1,610  per  hire  as  compared  to  the  average  of $5,423  based 

directly on the survey results.

The  cost  per  driver  is  multiplied  by the  change  in  the  number  of drivers  in  the  first  year.  In 

subsequent  years,  the  cost  per  hire  is  multiplied  by  the  change  in  the  number  of new  drivers 

times  the assumed chum rate for drivers.  Estimates of chum rates  vary from 25%  to over 100% 

depending  on the  survey.  The  2003  HOS  RIA  employed  the  chum rate  of 25%  assumed  by 
NERA (2001).80  The cost in Year  1 is  $1,610 * 10,000 drivers,  or $16.10 million.  The cost in 
subsequent years is equal to $16.10 times the chum rate of 25%, or $4.02 million per year.

This  section  estimates  the  safety  benefits  from  reducing  fatigue  III  over-utilized  drivers  by 

bringing them into minimal compliance with the HOS rules. 

H.3.1  Background on Driver Fatigue, Sleep and Truck-Involved Accidents 

This  review  draws  on  existing  literature  to  describe  the  function  of sleep  and  the  established 

relationship  between  sleep,  fatigue,  shift  work  and  performance,  and  CMV  accidents.  For  the 

purposes  of this review,  fatigue  is  defined as  the  decreased ability to  perform induced by a lack 

of adequate  sleep,  approximately  8  hours  per  24-hour  period.  The  review  does  not  intend  to 

duplicate  other  major  literature  reviews  performed  on  the  subject  of sleep,  fatigue  and  truck(cid:173)
involved  accidents.8l  Rather,  it  is  a  targeted  summary  of key  issues  related  to  the  analysis 

80  NERA claims this  is a conservative assumption based on survey data indicating 25% churn per quarter for TL 
and 4% for NTL carriers, or -75% annually across all driver types (Trucking Activity Report, June 2000, ATA). 
FMCAS also reviewed a compendium of surveys compiled by J.J.  Keller &  Associates ("What Matters to Drivers", 
Neenah, WI,  1997) which generally confirms the range of estimates cited by NERA.

The Function and Physiology of Sleep 

Sleep is  an  integral part of human functioning and longevity.  Not getting enough sleep leads to 
drowsiness  and  impaired  concentration for  the  subsequent  non-sleep  period. 82  Too  little  sleep 

also  leads  to  impaired  memory  and  physical  performance  and  reduced  ability  to  perform  on 

cognitive tasks.  Without sleep,  neurons  may become so  depleted  in energy or so  polluted with 

byproducts  of normal  cellular  activity that  they  begin to  malfunction.  During  sleep,  the  body 

also  increases  its  protein production,  enabling  the  repair of damaged cells,  damaged  from  such 

external elements as  ultraviolet rays or stress.  Sleep is crucial to this process of cell repair and to 

the promotion of uncompromised performance during non-sleep periods. 

H.3.1.1.1  The Stages of Sleep 

Until  the  1950s,  sleep  was  regarded  as  a  dormant,  passive  part  of daily  life.  After  this  time, 

however,  sleep  became  to  be  recognized  as  a  dynamic  process  with  multiple  states  of brain 

activity.  There are five  different stages  of sleep,  as  measured through brain activity.  These five 

stages are: 

Stage 1 - Sleep Onset 
Stage 2,3 and 4 - non Rapid Eye Movement (non-REM) Sleep 
Stage 5 - Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep 

The  brain  passes  through  stages  1,  2,  3  and  4  (non-REM  sleep)  and  then  into  stage  5  (REM 

sleep).  The time spent in each stage varies depending on the stage and depending on the number 

of sleep  cycles  (progression  through  stages  1,  2,  3,  4  and  REM  sleep)  completed  in  the  sleep 

period.  Approximately  50  percent  of total  sleep  time  is  spent  in  stage  2,  20  percent  in  REM 

sleep and 30 percent in the remaining stages. 

Stage  1  is  the  shortest  phase,  comprised  of drifting  in  and  out  of  sleep.  People  are  easily

awakened during this  phase.  This  is  also the  phase where one experiences  "hypnic myoclonia" 

where the sensation of falling is  often felt.  In stage 1, the body has slow muscle activity and eye 

movement.  In stage 2,  the stage  in  which  most  sleep  time  is  spent,  eye  movement stops.  The 

brain's  electrical  activity  decreases  and  short  bursts  of rapid  brain  waves  occasionally  appear. 

Stage 2 is  the first stage of the non-REM sleep stages.  Stages 3 and 4 (called deep sleep) are also 

non-REM sleep stages and are characterized by very slow brain waves. 

REM sleep  is  the next stage.  This  is  often referred to  as  the  "active" sleep  stage.  The slowed 

brain  waves  begin  to  accelerate,  breathing  becomes  more  rapid,  irregular  and  shallow,  eye 

movement  begins,  heart  rate  increases  and  blood  pressure  rises.  This  lighter  stage  of sleep  is 

where most dreaming occurs.  As the sleep period progresses,  the REM sleep stage increases  in 

length  where  towards  the  end  of the  sleep  period,  an  individual  may spend  up  to  one  hour  in 

REM sleep and experience very involved dreams. 

The complete sleep cycle usually takes  90 to  110  minutes.  The first  sleep  cycles  of each sleep 

period  contain  relatively  short  REM  periods  and  long  periods  of  deep  sleep.  As  the  night 

progresses,  REM  sleep  periods  increase  in length  while  deep  sleep  (stages  3  and  4)  decreases. 

By the end of a "normal" sleep period (defined here as  approximately 8' hours),  almost all  sleep 

is  spent in Stage 2 and REM sleep. 

H.3.1.1.2  Physiology of Sleep 

Most sleep experts agree that adults need between six and ten hours of sleep per 24-hour period, 

with  most  people  requiring  approximately  8  hours  of sleep  per  day.83  Sleep  most  naturally 

occurs at night, due to the human body's circadian rhythm.  Circadian, or daily, rhythms operate 

on  approximately  a  24-hour  cycle  and  are  responsible  for  natural  peaks  and  lulls  in  hormonal 

secretions,  a  heightened  sense  of fatigue  during  different  parts  of the  day  - particularly  in  the 

earl y  morning  hours  and  the  late  afternoon - and  the  coordination and  timing  of other  internal 

bodily functions,  including body temperature and sleep.  Sunlight and other time cues help to set 

and maintain circadian cycles.

Body temperature fluctuates  in accordance with  other bodily fluctuations  of the  circadian cycle 

and influences the timing of sleep and sleep onset.  During a single day,  the body's temperature 

rises and falls  a number of times.  Body temperature rises in the early morning hours, declines in 

the  late  afternoon,  rises  in  the  evening  and  declines  later  at  night.  People  prefer  to  go  to  bed 

during certain phases  in the temperature cycle over others,  preferring phases when the circadian 

temperature  cycle  is  at  the  nadir  (lowest  point).84  When  body  temperature  is  on the  rise,  the 
body has a greater propensity to  awaken.85  Body temperature is  on the rise in the morning hours, 
when people on regular night sleep schedules tend to wake up.  It logically follows  that it is more 

difficult  to  fall  asleep  during  these  morning  hours  (because  body  temperature  is  rising,  not 

falling). 

The  sleep/wake  cycle  shows  that  the  degree  of sleepiness  depends  on the  oscillating  circadian 

rhythm and declining linear function (increased degree of sleepiness) based on the length of time 

spent awake. 86 

H.3.1.2 

Significance of the Timing of Sleep 

The timing of sleep matters.  Sleep duration is  greatest after evening bedtimes and shortest after 
morning  bedtimes.87  The  duration  of sleep  has  also  been  found  to  be  shorter  the  later  in  the 
morning  sleep  begins.88  The  shorter  sleep  duration  after  a  morning  bedtime  might  seem 
somewhat  counterintuitive  as  a  morning  bedtime  is  often  the  result  of  sleep  postponed  (i.e. 

longer period ~lapsed since last period of sleep).  However, this decrease can be explained by the 

strong influence of the circadian rhythm on sleep duration, which makes it more difficult to  sleep 

during daytime hours than it is during nighttime hours. 

A number of studies have shown that duration of sleep is  influenced by the time of day of sleep.

A  survey found  that night  workers,  who by default must  sleep  in some part,  or entirely,  during 
the day,  slept three hours less than the recommended eight hours required to prevent sleep debt.89 
Another study found that night workers  (shift starting around 2200 or 0000) slept on average 3.3 

hours  less  than  their  day-working  counterparts  (shift  starting  around  0800),  sleeping  4.3  hours 

and 7.6 hours respectively.9o  These data demonstrate that people who rely on daytime sleep for a 

significant part of their rest are experiencing less total sleep. 

H.3.1.3 

Sleep Deprivation and Sleep Debt and Impact on Performance 

Sleep  deprivation  occurs  when  an  individual  sleeps  two  or  more  hours  less  than  the  optimal 

amount during anyone sleep episode, eight hours  being the standard optimal  amount subject to 

significant variation by individual. Sleep deprivation over a series of sleep periods leads to sleep 
debt,  the  accumulated  sleep  loss  over  the  course  of time.91  The  discussion  in  this  section 
presents  the  results  of a  number of studies  and  the  implications  of sleep  deprivation  and  sleep 

debt on performance based on the available literature. 

Sleep  deprivation  and  sleep  debt  have  a  number  of  consequences  for  performance.  Sleep 

deprivation over a couple of days leads to slower response times and decreased initiative.92  After 

one sleepless night, cognitive performance may decrease 25% as  compared to the performance of 
non-sleep  deprived  individuals.93  After  the  second  sleepless  night,  performance  on  cognitive 
tasks may decrease to nearly 40% the potential level.  A meta-analysis found that people who are 

chronically sleep deprived, that is,  have substantial sleep debt, performed at the 9th percentile of

Individuals switching from an irregular to regular schedule do not immediately achieve improved 

fatigue  levels.  Sleep  deprived  individuals  with  irregular  sleep  schedules  (as  could  be  the  case 

with  truck  drivers)  who  regularized  their  sleep  schedules  but  suffered  sleep  loss  in  the  process 

experienced an  increase  in  daytime  sleepiness  and  a concomitant deterioration  in  concentration 
ratings, immediately after regularizing their sleep schedule.95 

These  findings  suggest  that  routine  sleep  schedules  that  allow  the  individual  sleeping  an 

adequate  number  of hours  (approximately  8,  varying  by  individual)  during  approximately  the 

same time during a 24-hour period facilitate daily functioning at unimpaired performance levels. 

H.3.1.4 

Fatigue and Work 

Workers  experience  a  number of different  types  of fatigue  while  on the job.  The three  major 
types  of fatigue  affecting  work  performance  are  industrial,  cumulative  and  circadian. 96  These 

types of fatigue are described below, focusing on the literature relating to truck drivers. 

Industrial  fatigue  results  from  working  continuously  over  an  extended  period  of time  without 

proper  rest,  often  referred  to  in  the  literature  as  fatigue  resulting  from  time-on-task.  For 

example, a truck driver who has been driving for  six hours, without a break, might be subject to 
industrial fatigue.  Some studies have shown performance to decrease as  time on task increases. 97 

Time-on-task problems could be exacerbated by sleep  loss,  even in  the early stages  of the task. 

One study  concluded  that  for  sleep  deprived  individuals,  performance  is  compromised  even at 

early  stages  of performance  of a  monotonous  task  if the  situation  is  undemanding  and  boring. 

This  study  suggests  that  the  effect  of sleepiness  becomes  immediately  evident  in  the  form  of

Cumulative  fatigue  arises  from  working  for  too  many  days  on  any  protracted,  repetitive  task 

without  any  prolonged  break.  This  fatigue  results  from  a  lack  of  alertness  brought  on  by 

familiarity  and  boredom  with  the  task  at  hand.  A  truck  driver  could  experience  cumulative 

fatigue  after  driving  for  12  hours,  taking  eight  hours  off  and  then  driving  another  12  hours 

(driving a total of 24 hours in a 32 hour period). 

Circadian fatigue  is  a function of the circadian rhythm.  Fatigue is  greatest when approaching or 

at  the  nadir of the  circadian cycle,  where  the  body is  least  vigilant.  The  truck  accident  rate  is 

much higher during the early morning hours than during any other time of day,100  supporting the 

circadian effect hypothesis that accidents are more likely to  occur when the human body is  least 

vigilant. 101 

Night and rotating shift workers  are  especially susceptible to being fatigued  on the job. 102,103,104 

Permanently  assigned  graveyard-shift  workers  sleep  between  5.8  to  6.4  hours  per  day.105 

Rotating shift workers,  such as  many truck drivers,  sleep even less  when they work a night shift 

(5.25 to 5.5 hours).  Shift workers experience disturbances in their circadian rhythm, as  measured 

by changes in hormonal levels; 106  they are also less  alert during nighttime shifts and perform less 
well  on reasoning  and non-stimulating tasks  than non-shift workers. 107  Though nightshift work 
for  many  workers  is  regular  (the  same  schedule  is  kept  over  time),  truck  drivers  often  have 

irregular schedules  which can amplify the effects of circadian, cumulative and industrial fatigue 

"Vigilance" was  measured through a 34-minute visual vigilance test.

H.3.1.5 

Fatigue and Truck-Involved Crashes 

Fatigue increases over the duration of trips, regardless of the driving schedulel08  and total driving 
time has  a  significant effect on  crash risk though  there  is  variation on the  point at  which  crash 

risk  increases  significantly,  depending  on  the  study  methodology. 109,1 10  A  study  of industrial 

fatigue  in  truck  drivers  found  that  in  over 65%  of cases,  truck  accidents  took  place  during  the 

second half of a trip, regardless of trip length. I I I  An analysis of Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety 

data  in the  1970s  found  that  about  twice  as  many accidents  occurred during  the  second half of 

trips than during the first half, regardless of trip duration. I 12  Another study found that the risk of 

accident  increased  after  the  fourth  hour  of driving  and  peaked  after  nine  hours  of driving.113 

These  studies  are  among  many finding  that  industrial fatigue  plays  a role  in predisposing truck 

drivers  to accidents.  Determining the magnitude of this  effect, however,  and ensuring that other 

factors (such as sleep history and time of day) have been factored out, is  quite difficult. 

Researchers have long asked how long a person can sustain work effort at different tasks without 

lengthy  breaks,  before  hislher  performance  of  those  tasks  becomes  unacceptably  degraded. 

There has  always  been a notion that by itself,  sustained performance at a task (Time on Task or 

TOT)  eventually results  in a "fatiguing effect" manifesting itself in the form  of slower response 

times or errors of omission.  Below is  a short literature review of five  studies about the time-on(cid:173)

task effect on driving and some conduding remarks.

Jones  and  Stein (1987)114  attempted to  provide  "adjusted odds  ratios"  to  different categories  of 

"length  of time  in  driving"  (TOT),  assigning  a  baseline  value  of 1.0  to  the  relative  risk  of the 

likelihood of crashes  attributable  to  a  driving  time  of from  0  to  2 hours;  and  they  presented an 

increased odds ratio of 1.2 for driving times of from 2 to 5 hours and also 5 to 8 hours of driving 

time (TOT).  The work of Jones  and Stein says  nothing about projecting odds  ratios  for  driving 

more than 8 hours, something at the root question of the entire discussion of truck driver HOS. 

Lin,  J ovanis,  and  Yang  (1993) 115 

introduce  a  time-dependent  logistic  regression  model 

formulated to  assess  the  safety of motor carrier operations.  They describe their model  as  being 

flexible,  allowing  the  inclusion  of  time-independent  covariates,  time  main  effects,  and  time(cid:173)

related  interactions.  The  model  estimates  the  probability  of having  a  crash  at  time  interval  t, 

subject to surviving (not having a crash) before that time interval.  Covariates tested in the model 

in  this  paper  include  consecutive  driving  time,  multiday  driving  pattern  over  a  7-day  period, 

driver age and  experience,  and hours  off duty before the  trip  of interest.  Although the  work of 

Lin, Jovanis, and Yang has some appeal in the conduct of this study, their methods and modeling 

are  of  some  concern  in  that  they  do  not  model  beyond  the  8-9  hours  of  driving  incidents, 

something which is obviously needed to examine the HOS alternatives. 

In  their description  of nine  logistic  regression  modeling  attempts  Lin,  J ovanis,  and  Yang  state 

that  driving  time  (TOT)  has  the  strongest  direct  effect  on  accident  risk.  The  first  4  hr 

consistently  have  the  lowest  crash  risk  and  are  indistinguishable  from  each  other.  Accident 

(crash)  risk  increases  significantly  after  the  fourth  hour  of driving,  by  approximately  50%  or 

more, until the seventh hour.  The 8th and 9th hours show a further increase, approximately 80% 

and 130% higher than the first 4 hours. 

Campbell  (1988)"6  states  that  there  IS  a  steady  increase  in  the  probability  of  accident 

involvement  with  the  number  of hours  driving.  To  look  into  this,  Campbell  used  data  from

accident  reports  filed  with  the  Office  of Motor Carriers  and  extracted  the  time  of day  that  the 

accident  occurred,  the  number  of hours  driving  at  the  time  of the  accident,  and  the  intended 

driving period had the accident not occurred.  The accidents that were coded as  the driver having 

dozed  at the time of the  accident  were  used to  determine  the  time-on-task effect.  The problem 

with  this  is  that  not  all  of the  crash  data  was  included  and  crashes  may  have  been  caused  by 

fatigue  yet  the  driver was  not  dozing  at  the  time.  It was  concluded that the  crossover point in 

which the  proportion of accidents  in the  latter hours  of driving  is  more  frequent  occurs  around 

four hours of driving. 

O'Neill  et  ai.  (1999)117  studied  the  operating  practices  of  CMV  drivers,  as  well  as  the 

relationship  of these  practices  to  driver  fatigue.  Drivers  worked  a  14-hour  on,  10  hour  off 

schedule  driving  a  simulator for  a  5-day week.  Two  30-minute breaks  and  a  45-minute  lunch 

break were  taken during  the day at  regularly scheduled times.  The observed recovery effect of 

the breaks  was  rather striking.  The effects  of 6.5  hours  of driving were  virtually reduced to the 

starting levels  by a 45-minute break (O'Neil et aI.,  1999).  It is  important to  keep  in mind that 

while  this  recovery  effect  is  remarkable,  it  occurred  under  very  strict,  adhered  to  conditions. 

This  effect  took  place  under  daytime  driving  conditions,  the  14  hours  onllQ  hours  off driving 

schedule  that  allowed  for  adequate  rest,  and  scheduled  breaks. 

It  cannot  be  said  with  a 

reasonable  degree  of  certainty  that  this  recovery  effect  would  occur  in  the  same  way  under 

different conditions. 

Wylie  et  ai.  (1996)  118studied  four  different  driving  conditions  to  test  several  driving  fatigue 

questions:  a  lQ-hour "baseline" daytime schedule, a  lQ-hour "operational" or rotating schedule, 

a 13-hour nighttime start schedule, and a 13-hour daytime start schedule.  The authors concluded 

that  hours-of-driving  (TOT)  was  not  a  strong  or  consistent  predictor  of  observed  fatigue. 

Interestingly,  there  was  a  positive  correlation  between  driver's  self-ratings  of fatigue  and  the 

number  of hours  driving  within  a  trip  while  objective  performance  did  not  indicate  a  positive 

correlation.

Based on the  literature reviewed,  the  time-on-task effect was  not  quantified  independent of and 

in addition to  the circadian and recovery/decrement recovery factors.  Therefore, the TOT effect 

was not used as  a separate factor in the 2003 HaS rule analysis. 

Another important and relevant factor  is  time of day and continuity of sleep.  Numerous studies 

have found an increased crash risk for truck drivers associated with night-time driving. I 19,120  In a 

study of a  group  of drivers  involved  in  single-vehicle  accidents,  almost  twice  as  many of their 

accidents occurred in the early morning hours between midnight and 0800 hours (66%) as  during 

the  rest  of the  day  (34%).121  Accidents  and  workplace  errors  from  studies  concerning  road, 
maritime and industrial operations show a peak at 0300. 122  Additionally, the  continuity of sleep 

is  significant.  An  elevated  fatal  crash  risk  was  identified  for  drivers  that  split  the  required  8 

hours off-duty into two sessions in a sleeper berth. 123 

An  arduous  work  schedule  has  also  been  identified  as  increasing  the  risk  of truck  involved 
accidents. 124  One  study found  that drivers  on a regular  13-hour daytime-start driving  schedule 

slept for  5.1  hours  while  drivers  on a  lO-hour daytime  start driving  schedule  slept 5.4 hours. 125 

While this  study only looked at  daytime-start schedules,  the  relationship between time-off duty 

and  time  spent asleep  is  remarkable.  Drivers  with  11  hours  off spent 5.1  hours  asleep  (and  an 

additional  .4  hours  in  bed)  while  drivers  with  14  hours  off  spent  5.4  hours  asleep  (and  an 

additional  .4  hours  in  bed).  The  study cites  the  fact  that drivers  on the  13-hour schedule  were 

within  10  minutes  of their sleep laboratory and thus  may have been able to  get more  sleep than 

otherwise.  The sleep  numbers  for  both groups  are  likely to  be  high because each  were  able  to 

obtain  their  principal  sleep  during  optimal  times  of the  day  (in  accordance  with  the  circadian

same schedule durations,  these drivers  could have  slept less  if conditions  were different (e.g.,  if 

the  schedule necessitated nighttime driving,  if the  drivers  lived (or the sleep center was)  further 

from their daily terminating point).

Conclusion 

Driving  requires  sustained  attention;  it  is  an  inherently  fatiguing  task  in  its  monotony  and 

repetition. 126  For  many  commercial  motor  vehicle  drivers,  the  inherently  fatiguing  task  of 

driving  is  compounded  by  fatigue  caused  by  working  long,  irregular  hours  that  conflict  with 

natural  circadian  rhythms.127  Because  of the  economic  incentives  for  rapid  goods  transport, 

many  drivers  may  be  unable  to  obtain  sufficient,  sustained,  restorative  sleep  and  may 

subsequently experience sleep deprivation or accumulate a sizable sleep debt.  Sleep deprivation 

and  sleep  debt,  as  shown  through  this  review,  can  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  risk  of accidents 

through  impaired  performance.  This  fact  supports  the  need  to  provide  CMV  drivers  with 

conditions  that  make  it  possible  and  likely  for  them  to  get  sufficient  sleep,  though  even  ideal 

conditions could not eliminate all fatigue-related crashes. 

H.3.2  Estimates of Motor Carrier Crashes Due to Fatigue 

H.3.2.1 

Data and Approach to Crash Analyses 

The  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA)  Fatality  Analysis  Reporting 

System  (FARS)  and  General  Estimates  System  (GES)  databases  and  the  MCMIS  Crash  File 

were  reviewed  for  the  years  1997  through  2000.  They  provided  the  primary  basis  for  crash 

estimates.  Other databases including the MCMIS  Census File, National Motor Carrier Directory 

(NMCD),  and Bluebook were used to categorize crashes by motor carrier firm operations so that 

the resultant crash data could be linked to the industry profile and schedule/risk analyses used to 

evaluate the potential effects of proposed changes to the hours of service regulations.

The crash analysis  began with an attempt to  extract commercial motor vehicle crashes  from  the 

three crash data files.  Key variables included the state, and date of the crashes;  vehicle type and 

configuration;  motor carrier census number;  total  vehicles, occupants, injuries  and fatalities;  and 

driver, vehicle and environmental factors  associated with the crashes.  The goal was to be able to 

establish a profile of carriers/vehicles involved in crashes  with particular attention placed on the 

apparent contributing factors  or accident causes.  There was  an attempt made to eliminate "other 

driver"  and  environmental  factors  leading  to  the  crash.  This  was  done  to  extract truck  crashes 

where the driver would probably be considered not "at fault" from the overall set of crashes.  The 

key issue was to determine the extent to which CMV driver fatigue or associated factors  could be 

reasonably established as  a primary contributing factor in the crash. 

In conducting such an analysis,  it is  essential that one recognize the potential weakness  in using 

police  accident  reports  (PARs)  as  the  sole  basis  for  attributing  fatigue  as  a  crash  cause.  The 

police officers who complete the reports rarely have specialized training in crash investigation or 

even in completing the forms.  One should also note that completing the PAR is no greater than a 

third  priority  for  officers  who  are  involved  in  situation  assessment,  emergency  response  and 

victim assistance,  and finally  controlling and then restoring traffic flow  around the crash scene. 

Additionally, PARs  are believed to under- rather than overestimate fatigue involvement in large 

truck crashes. 

Crashes where CMV driver fatigue is  cited as  a primary contributing factor should be viewed as 

the  "minimum"  number  of crashes  with  fatigue  as  a  cause.  For  this  reason,  the  analysis  was 

conducted to  develop  a more reasonable estimate of the  total  number of fatigue-related  crashes. 

An analysis  of data for  crashes  where  driver  inattention  was  cited  within the  PAR was  used to 

apportion  part  of  those  crashes  as  fatigue-related.  This  conclusion  was  drawn  from  a 

comprehensive report of SH drivers that attributed more than 20 percent of all inattention crashes 

to driver fatigue. 

H.3.2.1.1  Historical Crash Data Summary 

In order to  develop  estimates  of the total  cost of truck  crashes  in  recent  years,  the  FARS,  GES 

and  MCMIS  databases  were  reviewed  to  derive  national  summary  totals  of crashes  by  type, 

110 

fatalities,  and injuries.  Crashes  are defined by whether or not they involve fatalities  suffered by 

vehicle  passengers  or  non-occupants  (pedestrians),  reported  injuries  where  no  fatality  was 

involved, or property damage with no fatalities or injuries  (property damage only crashes.).  The 

MCMIS  database  tends  to  contain more detailed  information about the vehicle configuration or 

cargo carried and is  especially useful for determining the identity of the motor carrier involved in 

a  crash.  Historically,  there  has  been  an  undercount  of  truck  crashes  noted  in  the  MCMIS 

database  versus  FARS.  Comparably,  there  still  seems  to  be  a  substantial  undercount  of injury 

and property damage only (PDO) crashes in MCMIS  versus the national estimates derived in the 

NHTSA GES  database.  Part of the difference is  because MCMIS only records  PD~ crashes that 

resulted in a vehicle being towed away, a subset of all PD~ crashes. 

The F ARS  database is  considered the best source of fatal crash information since it is  a census of 

all  fatality  involved  motor  vehicle  crashes  occurring  within  the  United  States.  It was  used  to 

develop estimates of the total fatal  crashes  involving trucks, the total fatalities  (broken down by 

truck,  other  vehicle,  or  non-occupants)  and  the  numbers  of combination  and  large  single  unit 

trucks  involved.  Data were reported for  calendar years  1997 through  2000  and for  the  average 

over the four-year period. 

National estimates of truck crashes that do  not involve a fatal  injury were derived from the GES 

files.  Crashes,  total  injuries  and trucks  involved were reported for the  injury crashes  while total 

crashes and trucks involved were reported for the PD~ crashes.  The GES  estimates are based on 

a  stratified  national  sample  where  each  crash  is  assigned  a  sampling  weight  according  the 

stratum  from  which  it  is  reported.  The  GES  estimates  are  always  rounded  to  the  nearest 

thousand crashes, vehicles, or injuries.  These national estimates are provided below.

H.3.2.1.2  MCMIS Data Analysis 

In order to complete the baseline analysis, it was  necessary to determine what proportion of truck 

crashes  could  be  attributed  to  truck  driver  fatigue.  The  MCMIS  Crash  File  for  1997  through 

2000 was  used.  Bus  and unknown vehicle type records  were  eliminated from  the database  and 

the "apparent driver condition" variable was used to code the data records for which "fatigue" or 

"asleep"  had  been  cited  as  contributing  factor  in  the  crash.  The  "raw"  fatigue/asleep  crash 

estimates for  1997  through  1999  was  approximately  1.31 % of all  truck crashes with the number 

dropping  in  2000  to  less  than  1%.  These  very  low  values  could  seem  to  indicate  a  minimal 

fatigue rate for truck crashes.  However, closer examination of the data and direct benchmarking 

to alternative data sources point to numerous deficiencies in such a simple analysis. 

As  a  matter  of policy,  the  "apparent  driver  condition"  variable  has  been  eliminated  from  the 

National Governor's Association (NGA) required list of reportable data elements for commercial 

vehicle crash reports  in the SAFETYNET 2000 (Version 2)  reporting system.  This  was  in large 

part  due  to  historical  under-reported  and  non-reported  values  for  this  variable.  In  38%  of the 

2000 data records,  the  driver condition variable  was  missing  compared  to  less  than  10%  of the 

time  in earlier years.  In the earlier years,  the data field  was  reported as  "unknown" rather than 

missing  in  about  7%  of all  crash  records.  A  problem  arises  in  that  "appeared  normal"  and 

112 

"unknown" are both coding options, but for analytic purposes,  it is  difficult to  ascertain whether 

a  blank  value  for  this  variable  should  be  interpreted  as  "normal",  "unknown"  or  "not 

interpretable".  Previous  estimates  of driver  fatigue  associated  with  truck  crashes  have  been 

hampered by this serious data quality problem. 

A  state-by-state  examination  of  the  data  also  showed  several  systematic  problems  in  the 

reporting of the driver condition variable.  Driver condition was  not reported in truck crash data 

records from the States of Massachusetts, Oregon, South Carolina or Virginia in any of the years 

of data examined.  Additionally, fatigue/asleep  was never reported as  a factor in truck crashes in 

the  States  of Colorado,  Michigan,  New  Mexico  or Wisconsin.  These  data reporting  problems 

result in a logical inconsistency in calculating fatigue involvement rates for truck crashes.  If it is 

impossible to add a fatigue event in the numerator of the national fatigue crash rate, then the data 

from these States should not be included in the denominator of the rate calculation.  The problem 

grows  worse  in  more  recent  years  with  many  more  States  opting  to  not  report  apparent  driver 

condition at all.  For these reasons, the MCMIS  database should not be used to  derive estimates 

of fatigue-involved truck crashes. 

H.3.2.1.3  FARS Data Analysis 

As  an  alternative  to  using  the MCMIS  data,  FARS  truck crash data for  the  years  1997  through 

2000 were reviewed.  The FARS database contains information for crashes involving at least one 

associated fatality in the  involved truck,  in another vehicle, or a pedestrian.  The F ARS database 

has  been used  as  a benchmark for  the  MCMIS  database  fatal  crashes  since  the requirement for 

motor carrier self-reporting of crashes  was  ended  in the  early  1990's.  The  FARS  database has 

historically been held in high regard because of the NHTSA protocols for editing and coding the 

data elements within the data records. 

In order to  use the F ARS  database for analysis of fatigue related truck crashes, several key issues 

have to be examined.  Is  it reasonable to extend fatigue-related crash estimates from fatal crashes 

to  injury  and  property damage only crashes?  Since the  FARS  database  contains  data  elements 

for  reporting  up  to  four  driver  factors,  how  should  these  multiple  responses  be  handled?  Are 

there data reporting issues for the FARS dataset comparable to those encountered in the MCMIS 

113 

data set? 

The FARS  database is  limited to crashes involving a traffic fatality.  By definition, these crashes 

are  more  severe  since  the  fatal  outcome  has  a  higher  social  or  economic  cost  than  would  a 

comparable  crash  resulting  in  (perhaps  minor)  injuries  or  damages  to  property  only.  Fatal 

crashes  certainly have other characteristics that separate them from  injury only or PDQ crashes, 

especially  those  factors  associated  with  speed  and  type  of impact.  In truck  crashes,  the  "other 

vehicle" occupant is  almost six times more likely to die in the crash than a truck occupant, so it is 

not clear to  what extent fatal  truck crash characteristics can be reasonably generalized to  injury 

or PDQ crashes. 

This  question  is  difficult  to  answer  with  the  data  available.  A  review  of  MCMIS  fatigue 

involved crashes by crash type reveal that there was  an historical trend of fatigue being reported 

in  fatal  crashes  more  than  in  injury  and  property  damage  only  crashes.  The  overall  data 

reporting  problems  for  MCMIS  fatigue  crash  rates  also  present interpretation problems  for  this 

feature of the data.  Data for the year 2000 should not be used since the apparent driver condition 

variable had already stopped being used.  However,  for  1999  and  1998, fatigue  involvement in 

fatal crashes did exceed that reported in injury crashes or PDQ crashes. 

Another  estimate  of the  relative  prevalence  of fatigue  in  the  three  types  of crashes  could  be 

drawn from the GES data.  The GES  database serves as  a very good source of national estimates 

of total  crashes  and  for  crashes  with  certain  characteristics  (such  as  number  of occupants  or 

injuries,  or  by  vehicle  type).  However,  some  specific  details  of the  crash  cannot  be  estimated 

very  reliably.  Derived  from  state  databases  of police  accident  reports,  the  GES  suffers  from 

some of the same faults  as  the MCMIS.  There may be only one (if any)  of the driver condition 

variables included in the reports and fatigue may not always be a coded or reported factor.  In the 

2000  database,  however,  fatigue  was  cited  as  a  contributing  factor  in  1.46%  of  all  the  fatal 

crashes,  0.94%  of the  injury  only  crashes  and  0.65%  of the  PDQ  crashes.  These  percentages 

were  drawn  from  the  raw  non-weighted  sample.  Additionally,  the  data  were  not  edited  for 

missing values or adjusted for any other factors related to the data reporting in the files. 

With  such  small  percentages  reported  in  the  MCMIS  and  GES  databases,  there  IS  some 

114 

uncertainty in concluding that FARS  data for fatigue  involvement in crashes can be extended to 

the  injury and  PD~ crashes.  In  real  terms,  the  differences  are  negligible. 

In percentage terms 

the  differences  could be viewed as  substantial.  However,  the FARS  database contains  the  most 

detailed  and  highest  quality  data.  There  is  also  evidence  that  the  historical  underreporting  of 

fatigue involvement in F ARS would tend to provide conservative estimates regardless. 

Since the FARS database contains four different fields for reporting driver factors  contributing to 

the crash, there was  some initial concern that this could introduce an upward bias in the reporting 

of fatigue  involvement  in  crashes.  For the  years  1997  through  2000  this  appears  not  to  be  the 

case.  In  most  all  of the  cases  where  fatigue  was  cited  as  a factor  and  there  were  other factors 

cited, the fatigue code tended to occur first in the list.  Additionally, it was reported with a factor 

that  would  not  confound  the  results  reported  in  this  analysis.  The  two  most  common  other 

factors reported were "ran off road" and "inattention".  These accounted for a large proportion of 

the multiple factors cases. 

Finally,  from  the  standpoint of data quality,  some factors  ought to  be considered when viewing 

the FARS  data to  assure that cases  are  not included in the denominator of the rate  calculations, 

unreasonably  biasing  the  estimates  downward.  Examination  of  the  individual  data  records 

indicated  that  there  are  several  sets  of  crashes  that  it  seems  unreasonable  to  consider  in 

calculating  the  fatigue  involvement  rate.  For  one  set  of crashes,  many  of the  key  variables 

(vehicle configuration, body type,  harmful events,  driver charges,  impact details, etc.) are coded 

as  "9's",  which  means  unknown  or  unreported.  In  all  of these  cases  the  driver  contributing 

factors  are coded as  "99".  In  another set of data records,  the  individual crashes can be matched 

back  to  the  MCMIS  file  where  the  contributing  factors  are  missing  because  of  state  data 

reporting systems and procedures.  These appear in the FARS database with driver factors  coded 

as  "O's".  Eliminating  these  records  from  the  analysis  set  was  a  prerequisite  to  calculating  the 

proportion of crashes with motor carrier fatigue as  a contributing factor. 

The final  step in completing this  analysis was to examine each fatal  crash involving a large truck 

and  use the factors  cited to determine whether "fault" was  attributed in the  crash.  Crashes  were 

categorized as  whether the "other" (non-truck) driver was  determined to  be at fault  and  whether 

115 

the  truck  driver  was  determined  to  be  at fault.  Two  other  values  for  these  variables  were  also 

considered  and  reported  below.  If inclement weather was  cited  that  is  so  reported.  If no  fault 

was assigned for the crash, that was also reported.  One should note that since weather conditions 

and  multiple  drivers  may  interact  to  provide  multiple  responsible  conditions  or  persons,  the 

percentages for fault attribution could add up to more than  100%.  In all of the  years of reported 

data,  that  is  the  case.  One important  fact  to  note  from  these  attribution data,  is  that  the  "other 

driver" was deemed to be at fault almost twice as  often as  the truck driver. 

The fatigue attribution for the FARS crash data is  shown in table 58.  The edited data provide us 

with  an  estimate  of between 6.60%  (2000)  and  8.21 %  (1999)  for  the  period  examined.  These 

fatigue  numbers  were  adjusted  further  to  account  for  a  systematic  phenomenon  noted  by 
Hanowski  in  his  study  of  SH  drivers. 128 

In  that  study,  fatigue  was  determined  to  be  a 

contributing factor in 20.8 percent of the incidents where the driver was judged to be at fault due 

to  inattention.  When  at  fault,  their  PERCLOS  (percent  eyelid  closure)  values  prior  to  the 

incidents were significantly higher than for other types of critical incidents.

H.3.2.2 

Estimates of Crashes by Large Truck Firm Operations Type 

To estimate the relative involvement of large trucks  in crashes by operations  type,  crash records 

must  contain  specific  information  about  the  trucks  involved.  Crashes  can  be  classified  by  the 

operations  of the  vehicles  or firms  involved using  either the  actual  characteristics  of the  trip  in 

which  a  crash  occurred  or  the  identity  of the  motor  carrier  involved,  assuming  that  the  firm 

identifying  number  can  be  matched  to  a  data  source  in  which  motor  carriers  are  classified  by 

their operations. 

The most commonly cited crash databases do  not contain trip-specific characteristics.  The ideal 

information for  determining  whether  a  crash  occurred  in  long- versus  SH  operations  would  be 

the  starting  and  intended  ending  point  of the  trip  in  which  the  crash  occurred.  The  calculated 

distance  between  those  two  points  would  provide  with  certainty the  ability  to  classify  the  trip 

according  to  any  specified  cut-off  point  selected  for  differentiating  between  LH  and  SH 

operations. 

A  very  good  indicator  for  determining  if a  truck  crash  occurred  in  SH  operations  may  be  the 

vehicle or equipment type.  Dump trucks, garbage trucks and concrete mixers are rarely involved 

in  LH operations.  To  a  lesser extent,  cargo  tanks  are  somewhat restricted  to  SH use.  Flatbed 

trucks,  straight  trucks,  and  vans  or  enclosed  boxes  are  widely  used  in  both  long- and  SH 

operations.  This group comprises a substantial population of the cargo body types noted in truck 

crashes. 

An alternative method for determining the operations  of the  crash involved truck is  to  associate 

the  individual  vehicle  with  a firm  and  then  research  the  primary operations  type  for  the  whole 

firm.  The  TTS  Blue  Book  database  of 2,681  motor  carriers  provides  two  key  indicators  for 

specifying operations type, and also provides the US DOT motor carrier identification number for 

these carriers.  Average  length of haul  for  trips  made  in the  year and  the  freight  revenues  from 

long  and  short  distance  transportation  are  reported  in  the  database.  The  average  length of trip 

variable  can  be  used  directly  to  classify  carriers.  A  calculated  proportion  of revenue  derived 

from  short distance  operations  could also  be used to  classify carriers.  There are  2,481  firms  in 

the  TTS  database  with  sufficient  information  to  be  able  to  classify  them  as  long  or SH.  With 

117 

these  data,  the  motor  carrier  identification  number  can  be  used  to  match  firm  records  to  the 

MCMIS  and  (to  a  lesser  extent)  FARS  crash  files.  There  were  32,342  different  firms  with  a 

fatal,  injury or property damage only crash reported in the MCMIS  database during 2000, so the 

TTS  data  alone  cannot provide  a very good match for  ascertaining operations  type.  The  2,481 

firms with data can account for 2,016 matched crash records in the year 2000. 

Another  possible  criterion  for  establishing  the  operations  of  a  motor  carrier  is  the  primary 

commodity being carried.  The Blue Book database has  one field  for  each carrier indicating the 

commodity hauled.  The  TTS  National  Motor Carrier Directory  lists  the  top  four  commodities 

being  carried,  while  the  MCMIS  motor carrier census  lists  up  to  30 different  commodities  that 

each firm  may carry.  There are  a number of commodities  that are  very  clearly associated with 

SH<carriage  (C<ement,  garbage,  tank petroleum products,  coal/coke,  ores,  grain,  livestock,  et al). 

These products are associated with  special equipment used (as  mentioned above),  are hauled by 

train  when  moving  long  distances  or  have  some  other  characteristic  that  makes  long  distance 

carriage untenable or uneconomical.  The relative number of long and SH firms carrying anyone 

of the 24 different commodity groups in the Blue Book data provides a very good benchmark for 

the  potential  classification  of data  in  the  motor  carrier  census.  A  discriminate  analysis  of the 

Blue  Book data  revealed  that  a  substantial  number  of firms  could  be  classified  as  long  or  SH 

based  on  the  primary  commodity  that  they  carry.  Petroleum  tank  products,  dump  trucks, 

agricultural commodities, film products and local cartage operations are predominantly listed by 

firms  otherwise  classified  as  SH.  Firms  handling  refrigerated  solids,  refrigerated  liquids  and 

household goods were primarily classified as  LH. 

A  final  set of characteristics  could be used to  classify carriers  by long and SH operations.  The 

number of power units owned or leased or number of drivers employed divided by the total miles 

driven per year provides a measure of the utilization rate of these resources.  Other data from the 

Blue Book indicate that the low mileage per power unit (or driver)  firms  tend to be involved  in 

SH carriage.  Low end and high end cut-off points  were established for  these variables  and  the 

carriers  at  the  extremes  were  classified according  to  these  utilization variables.  Since mileage, 

drivers,  and  equipment  details  are  available  for  a  large  proportion  of  the  firms  listed  in  the 

USDOT  motor  carrier  census,  this  analysis  was  conducted  for  all  889,381  carriers  in  the 

118 

database.  Based on a review  of the  Blue  Book data,  a logical  cut-off point of 30,000  or fewer 

miles per year per driver or power unit was established for defining SH trucking firms  and a cut(cid:173)

off point of 60,000 or more miles  per year per driver or power unit was  established for defining 

LH  trucking  firms.  Firms  with  average  driver  and  vehicle  usage  between  30,000  and  60,000 

miles per year were left unclassified. 

The results  of these three  analyses  were combined to  develop the  overall estimates  of short and 

LH  involvement  in  the  103,055  truck  crashes  in  the  2000  MCMIS  Crash  database.  The  crash 

data  cargo  body  criterion  was  given  the  highest  priority  in  the  classification,  followed  by  the 

Blue  Book  average  trip  length,  chief  commodity,  and  utilization,  finally  incorporating  the 

MCMIS Census file commodity and utilization information.  Once a crash was  classified by one 

of these  methods  the  methods  following  it  in  the  priority  list  were  not  used.  For the  MCMIS 

commodity  and  utilization  tests,  consistency  checks  were  used  to  assure  that  there  was  no 

conflict in classification using the different methods.  If a conflict was  detected, then the carrier 

was  left  unclassified.  Approximately  70%  of  the  fatal  crashes  and  65%  of  the  injury  and 

property damage only crashes could be classified as long or SH using this procedure. 

Table 59 shows the numbers and proportion of crashes in calendar year 2000 broken out by long(cid:173)

or SH firms.  The raw percentages have been adjusted to reflect the relative involvement of long 

and SH operations noted.  This allocation scheme assumes that the unclassified crashes should be 

distributed proportionally to the LH and SH groups.  For 2000, there was an approximate 60% to 

40%  split  between  LH  and  SH  operations  involvement  in  fatal  and  property  damage  only 

crashes.  LH  operations  were  associated  with  approximately  55%  of the  injury  only  crashes. 

These  estimates  can  be  used  with  the  baseline  crash  numbers  derived  from  F ARS  and  GES  to 

establish the historical baseline of crash involvement for the two different types of motor carrier 

operations.  From that one can estimate the  relative benefits  of crash reduction due  to  differing 

hours of service proposals.

H.3.3  Sleep Models 

Sleep  models  are  used  to  analyze  the  major  processes  underlying  sleep  regulation.  They  also 

provide  a  conceptual  framework  for  the  analysis  of sleep  data.  As  pointed  out  in  the  sleep 

literature,  sleep  regulation  involves  three  processes: 

(1)  the  homeostatic  process 129  which 

increases  during  wakefulness  and  decreases  during  sleep;  (2)  the  circadian  process  which 

depends  on  the  circadian  oscillator  controlling  temperature  and  alertness  rhythms;  and  (3)  the 

ultradian  process  which  determines  the  NREMIREM  (Non  RapidlRapid  Eye  Movement) 
periodicity. 130 

Over the  past  two  decades,  quantitative  models  have  been  developed  to  describe  human  sleep 

regulation.  Most current mathematical models of alertness include a homeostatic component and 
circadian component. 131  Sleep models also account for the regulation of the alternation between 

non-REM  sleep  and  REM  sleep. 

In one  class  of models,  an  ultradian  oscillator  regulates  the 

alternation of non-REM and REM sleep.  In the second class  of models  the alternation between 

non-REM sleep and REM sleep is  governed by homeostatic processes related to non-REM sleep 

and REM sleep itself. 132 

129  The homeostatic process is often referred to  as Process S. The homeostatic process triggers an increase in the 
. demand for sleep after a period of prior wakefulness. It reflects the extent to  which the need for sleep has been 
satisfied.

H.3.3.1 

Variation among Models 

Sleep  models  differ  on  how  the  various  components  interact  with  each  other.  Some  models 

assume  an  additive  interaction between  the  circadian  and  homeostatic  components  of alertness 
while  later  studies  provide  evidence  of  a  nonadditive  interaction. 133 

Jewett  et  al  (1999)134 

developed mathematical models in which levels of subjective alertness and cognitive throughput 

are  predicted by three  components  that  interact with  one another in  a nonlinear manner.  These 

components  are:  (1)  a homeostatic component (H)  that falls  in  a s-shaped manner during  wake 

and  increases at a decreasing rate that asymptotically approaches a maximum during sleep;  (2) a 

circadian component  (C);  and  (3)  a  sleep  inertia  component  (W)  that  increases  at  a decreasing 

rate after awakening. 

Sleep  models  also  vary  depending  on  the  model's  purpose.  More  recently,  efforts  have  been 

made to develop sleep models that can quantify the relationship between sleep; circadian rhythm 

and  performance.  The models use  sleep data  as  input  and  they yield  predicted alertness  as  well 

as  performance on monotonous tasks.  Some models  include an identification of levels  at which 

the risk of performance or alertness  impairment starts,  as  well  as  prediction of sleep latency and 

time of awakening of sleep episodes.  Examples of this  new generation of sleep models  include 

the  following:  the  Fatigue  Audit  InterDyne  model  (FAID),  the  Circadian  Alertness  Simulator 

(CAS) and the Walter Reed Sleep Performance Model (WRAIR-SPM). 

H.3.3.2  Walter Reed Sleep Performance Model 

The Walter Reed Sleep and Performance Prediction Model (WRAIR-SPM) was conceived in the 

late  1980s  by Colonel  Gregory L.  Belenky,  US  Army,  and  members  of his  research  staff at  the 

U.S.  Army's  Walter  Reed  Army  Institute  of  Research  (WRAIR).  The  WRAIR-SPM  is  a 

quantitative  model  that  was  initially  designed  to  predict  the  performance  of  soldiers  during 

extended operations.

performance", Journal of Sleep Research 1992, 1: 112117.

throughput in humans, Journal of Biological Rhythms  1999;14(6):588-97. 

121 

During  the  1990's,  WRAIR's  sleep  researchers  refined  the  model  based on data  obtained from 

studies  of sleep  loss  per  se  as  a  determinant  of cognitive  performance.  They  focused  on  the 

effects  of total  and  partial  sleep  deprivation  on  a  wide  range  of psychological  and  cognitive 

performance  tests.  The  cognitive  task  performances  selected  from  the  WRAIR  Performance 

Assessment  Battery  (PAB)  include  those  that  tap  into  brain  functions  representative  of those 

involved  in  doing  military command  and  control  tasks  (e.g.,  serial  addition/subtraction,  logical 

reasoning, choice reaction time and pattern recognition tasks). 

Further  attempts  to  refine  the  model  in  the  mid-1990s  led  to  debates  about  whether  expected 

performance  decline  during  complete  sleep  deprivation  periods  were  linear,  or  degraded  in  a 

step-wise function over time for successive days of military operations.  The step-wise cognitive 

performance  degradation  function  (Angus  &  Heslegrave,  1985)135  indicates  that  performance 

was  relatively constant until  about  18  hours  of non-stop work which is  similar but not the same 

as  time-on-task).  After  18  hours  of non-stop  work,  performance  drops  by  25%  from  baseline, 

and remains  at a constant level  until  about 30 hours  of continuous  work.  At this  point,  it drops 

by another 15-20%, and subsequently begins to deteriorate to 30% of baseline over three days  in 

sustained performance tasks. 

In  order  to  extend  and  validate  the  parameters  of the  WRAIR-SPM,  the  FMCSA  and  other 

government  agencies  sponsored  a  large-scale  laboratory  confinement  study  to  determine  the 

effects  of four  sleep/wake  schedules  on  alertness  and  performance.  The  Sleep  Dose-Response 

study  (SDR)  examined the effects of one  week's restricted sleep (three,  five,  seven,  or nine hrs 

per night)  on the  performance  of 66  CMV  driver  subjects.  Multiple  measures  of performance, 

including  psychomotor  vigilance  tasks  (PVTs)  and  driving  performance  measures,  were  taken 

while  drivers  did  a  sequence  of  45-minute  drives  on  a  low-fidelity  desk-top  truck  driving 

simulator (Balkin,  et aI.,  May 2000).  This  study resulted in numerical estimation of parameters 

for the WRAIR Sleep Performance Model, and elucidated the relationships among several sleep(cid:173)

related performance measures.

team originally based their prediction model  (originally called SPM-96  and framed  around only 

young  healthy  males)  on  its  ability  to  predict  a  person's  performance  on  the  serial 

addition/subtraction  task  from  the  WRAIR-PAB  (Thome  et  aI.,  1985)136.  The  SDR  truck 

simulator  study  added  experience  with  a  more  diverse  population  of  subjects.  With  this 

information,  they  refined  the  WRAIR-SPM  model  and  they  began  to  base  the  prediction 

algorithms around the Dinges Psychomotor Vigilance Task, a simple reaction time test (Balkin et 

aI.,  2000).  Generally,  the PVT reaction time  scores  are used as  indications  of a  secondary task 

measurement to indicate the level of "alertness" remaining, the reservoir of alertness still there in 

the subject while being subjected to continuous performance demands over time. 

After the SDR study with truck drivers  in the simulator, the WR-SPM gradually became a four(cid:173)

process  model.  The  timing  and  duration  of  a  person's  sleep  and  wakefulness  periods  over 

several  days  constitutes  a  sleep/wake  history.  Four  separate  functions  are  used  to  relate 

sleep/wake history to level of cognitive performance capacity, including (a) a wake function,  (b) 

a sleep function, (c) a "delay of recuperation" function, and (d) a sleep inertia function. 

Because  the  parameter  values  for  the  latest  WRAIR-SPM  were  estimated  using  normalized 

Response  Time  on the  Psychomotor  Vigilance  Task  as  the  performance  metric,  and  given  the 

wide  acceptability of PVTs  as  a "standard" by which  many sleep  deprivation and  performance 

studies  are  measured,  the  next  section  will  be  devoted  to  describing  the  main  features  of the 

psychomotor vigilance task. 

H.3.3.3 

Psychomotor Vigilance Task 

The  Psychomotor  Vigilance  Task  is  a  test  of behavioral  alertness  developed  by  David  Dinges 

and  John  Powell  in the  mid-1980s  at  the  University of Pennsylvania  (UPENN)  Hospital.  The 

PVT was  designed to  evaluate the ability to  sustain attention and respond in a timely manner to 

salient signals (Dinges &  Powell,  1985).137  It was also designed to be free of a learning curve or

influence  from  acquired  skills,  such  as  aptitude  or  education,  and  to  be  highly  sensitive  to  an 

attentional process that is  fundamental to normal behavioral alertness. 

PVT  performance  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  highly  sensitive  to  detecting  changes  in 

behavioral  alertness  associated  with  numerous  work  settings,  such  as  medical  house  staff jobs, 

night  shift  workers,  drowsy  drivers,  transoceanic  pilots.  PVT  performance  is  also  sensitive  to 

bodily states,  such  as  those  of partial  and  total  sleep-deprived subjects,  truck drivers  with  sleep 

apnea,  sleepy elderly subjects, and to exposure to  various  ingested chemical substances, such as 

caffeine, modafinil, and alcohol. 

In  the  study  of operating  practices  in  a  high-fidelity  truck  simulator,  O'Neill  et  al.  (1999)138 

examined two weeks of day-time driving (0700-2130 hrs) that entailed simulated driving tests of 

12 hours  per day on a  14 hours  on duty and  10 hours  off duty work schedule.  Ten-minute PVT 

tests  were  administered  three  times  per  day  (at  0645,  1330  and  2100  hrs)  during  a  five-day 

driving  workweek,  and  four  times  per  day  on  the  drivers'  weekend  off  recovery  days  (0900, 

1300,  1700 and 2100 hrs).  PVT data were reported in the form  of median and mean reciprocal 

response times, and number of lapses, combined on a graph.  The authors found that PVT scores 

were  sensitive  to  partial  and  full  sleep  deprivation,  thus  underscoring  the  value  of  properly 

designed work-rest schedules. 

The  PVT  is  acknowledged  as  being one  of the  most  consistently reliable  research  tools  for  the 

study of operator alertness,  fatigue  and/or drowsiness.  The  PVT test of simple choice  reaction 

time is  backed by almost two decades of experience and historical data.  It has  been used widely 

by the research community in many studies  e.g.  Balkin, (2000)139;  O'Neill et al.  (1999);  Hartley 

et aI., (2000)140 and Krueger, (2002).141

H.3.3.3.1  Model Calibration 

Balkin et al. (2000) described the WRAIR-SPM as  "a series of empirically derived mathematical 

relationships describing the continuous decrement of cognitive performance during wakefulness, 

restoration of cognitive performance during sleep,  and cyclic variation in cognitive performance 

during the course of the day." 

Wakefulness  was  assumed to  diminish cognitive performance capacity by a simple linear decay 
function Ct = Ct-1  - KW,  where Ct is  the cognitive performance capacity at time t,  and  KW  is  the 
performance depletion occurring in the interval t-1  to t. 

Sleep was  assumed to  restore cognitive capacity utilizing an exponential growth function.  For a 

subject going to sleep once cognitive capacity reached zero and remaining asleep for  a period of 

time t, cognitive capacity would equal  100 * (1  - e_c2*t).142  In this representation, the coefficient 

c2 is the sleep recovery time constant. 

The  third  component  of the  model  is  the  circadian  phase  modulating  function  (M)  which  has 

both a circadian (24-hour)  and ultradian (l2-hour) component.  To reflect the 24-hour circadian 

and  12-hour ultradian components, M is expressed as an additive double cosine function: 

M = 1 + C3  * cos ((2n/ 24) * t + C4)  + Cs  * cos ((2n/ 12) * t + C6)143 

where c3  and c5  represent the amplitude parameters for the cosine functions  c4 and c6 represent 

phase shift parameters from  midnight (the beginning of a day).  In the WRAIR-SPM,  predicted 

performance at a given time (t) is expressed as the product of the Current Cognitive Capacity (C) 

and the Modulating function (M). 

H.3.3.3.2  Inputs 

The software model enables users to enter sleep/wake schedules in which the subject follows  the 

142  FMCSA, "The effects of sleep schedules on commercial motor vehicle driver performance", May 2000. pp. 3-9. 
143

125 

exact same pattern over a period,  or to  enter a schedule where the  subject's  sleep pattern varies 

from  day-to-day.  The  model  has  the  capacity to  evaluate  schedules  that  cover up  to  100 days. 

The following are the major input components to the WRAIR -SPM model. 

H.3.3.3.3  Sleep/Wake History 

The first  major input to  the  model  is  sleep/wake history.  The sleep/wake history represents the 

timing  and  duration  of sleep  and  wakefulness  periods  over  a  period  of days.  In  the  WRAIR(cid:173)

SPM, four functions  are used to relate sleep/wake history to cognitive performance capacity level 

(CPCL).  These  four  functions,  and  a  brief  description  of  their  relationship  to  cognitive 

performance are as follows: 

WakelDecrement Function - The wake/decrement function describes how cognitive 

performance declines during periods of continuous wakefulness. 

SleeplRestoration Function - The sleep/restoration function describes the rate at which 

cognitive performance capacity accrues during sleep. 

Delay-of-Recuperation Function - The delay-of-recuperation function was incorporated 
into the model to exhibit the time lag between the wake/decrement function and the 
sleep/restoration function at the beginning of sleep.  This delay is set at five minutes 
in the model, the time assumed to transition into recuperative sleep. 

Sleep Inertia Function - The sleep inertia function accounts for the gradual restoration of 

normal performance and alertness upon awakening (approximately 20 minutes). 

H.3.3.3.4  Time of Day (Circadian Phase) 

The  second  input  is  the  circadian  phase,  which  is  based  on  time  of  day.  This  component 

accounts  for the empirical data showing that CPCL oscillates between a five  and twenty percent 

peak  to  trough  over  a  24-hour  period.  Reflecting  the  influence  of  circadian  and  ultradian 

rhythms on performance, performance is  lowest in early morning hours, and increases  across the 

day (except for a dip in the afternoon), and peaks in the evening hours, prior to sleep onset. 

H.3.3.3.5  Output 

Based on the user input of a sleep/wake schedule, the model will generate graphical and tabular 

126 

outputs.  The tabular data presents minute-by-minute reports of the subject's sleep/wake status at 

the  particular  time  and  level  of predicted performance.  The  level  of predicted  performance  is 

reported numerically on a scale ranging from zero (0) to one hundred (100). 

H.3.3.3.6  Model Limitations 

The  model  does  not  differentiate  between  "awake  and  working"  versus  "awake  and  resting" 

times.  One  might  think  that  the  former  would  take  a  greater  toll  on  one's  performance  level 

capacity for  subsequent periods  in  the  day.  In  addition,  it does  not  explicitly take  into  account 

the  interaction  of physical  and  mental  exhaustion  and  it  does  not  recognize  any  time-on-task 

effects separate from the general cognitive depletion and circadian functions. 

H.3.4  Estimating Sleep Profiles 

The modeling uses  actigraph data from the Walter Reed field study to predict sleep in a 24-hour 

period  based  on  time  on  duty  in  24  hours.  The  WaIter  Reed  field  study  provides  the  most 

accurate  measure  of actual  sleep  (rather  than  reported  sleep)  as  well  as  its  relationship  to  time 

worked.  Because the  dataset follows  a panel  of people  across  time,  the  appropriate  model  is  a 
random-effects  cross-sectional time series  model  for panel datasets. 144  Diagnostic tests  indicate 

the appropriateness of a random effects model. 145 

The data suggest the most appropriate functional form is  a cubic regression equation (third-order 

polynomial),  particularly  given  the  interest  in  accurately  reflecting  hours  of  sleep  for  those 

working longer hours. 146  This relationship between time sleeping and time on-duty is  then used 

144  Theory suggests that the individual differences are random disturbances drawn from some general distribution 
rather than that each person has a fixed effect shifting the equation up or down, that is, residuals do not vary by 
individual.  In order to run the model appropriately, it was assumed that all days are sequential even if one day's 
observation was missing or was dropped due data problems. 
145  A Hausman test did not reject the null model that the fixed and random effects models are equivalent at a 5 
percent alpha level, although it did at a  10 percent level.  The coefficients and standard errors found  using the 
random effects model, however, differ only slightly from either using a fixed effects model or pooling the dataset 
(coefficients only) as  if the data points were all independent individuals.  This indicates that misspecification is  not 
likely to have affected results.  For instance, the fixed effect regression equation results in predictions for sleep vary 
by no  more than five minutes from the random effects model. 
146  The data show non-linear tendencies, and a quadratic equation provides predictions that fall  out of the realm of 
that possible (more than 24 hours of activity per day) for people who report a large number of hours on duty.

Total Hours On Duty in 24 Hours 

Because of the interest in this study of accurately reflecting schedules for people who  work a large number of hours, 
the functional form is cubic so that it more closely matches the data especially if a driver is  modeled as having 
worked a large number of hours.  The equation estimated is  y = 8.12800 - 0.18272 x + 0.02335x2 
- 0.00138x3
R-square is reasonable given the number of data points available. 
147  FMCSA attempted to compare the relationship between hours of sleep and time on-duty found from the Walter 
Reed Field Study with that found from the two  waves of the UMTIP data.  It was expected that the relationship 
would be larger for UMTIP because it provides self-reported time sleeping rather than actiwatch monitoring of 
actual sleep.  Another qualification is  that the UMTIP did not require drivers to  verify time on duty by logging on 
duty periods or referring to  their log books.  Because there were problems with the accuracy of the UMTIP data, 
they  were used only as a check on the magnitude of predicted difference in hours slept due to different hours on 
duty.  A regression using these data  produces less reliable estimates, with a slope rising from eight hours of sleep in 
the last 24 with zero hours on duty to over 9.5 hours of sleep when working six hours in the last 24.  The downward 
slope for hours  worked above ten was  somewhat steeper than that resulting from the Walter Reed data.

H.3.5  Estimating Change in SH Crashes using Model Schedules 

Source:  Walter Reed Field Study 

Daily schedules were modeled for SH drivers to input into the Sleep Performance spreadsheet to 

predict  differences  in  incremental  crash  risks  for  a  baseline  with  full  nights  of sleep,  actual 

compliance  with  current  HOS  rules,  current  HOS  rules  under  full  compliance,  and  the  three 

proposed  options.  Research  on schedules  for  SH drivers  is  more  limited  than  for  LH  drivers. 

The literature indicates that these schedules are noted for their more regular pattern of work even 

if length of the work day varies 

Daily  schedules  for  SH drivers  were  modeled using  information on  typical  SH schedules  from 

the  Virginia  Tech  Field  Study  and  Virginia  Tech  Focus  Groups.  General  lessons  from  these 

sources  were  confirmed  with  industry representatives  involved  in SH operations.  Column 2 of 

Virginia Tech Focus Groups' table 4 (p.  8) outlines typical daily patterns for local beverage truck 

drivers.  The  general  pattern begins  with  an early  start to  the  work-day beginning  with pre-trip 

inspections and paperwork.  The trip to the first delivery stop is  about 15 to 30 miles followed by 

delivery  and  paperwork activities.  This  is  followed  by a  series  of shorter driving  times  (about 

three  miles  according  to  the  table)  among  subsequent  route  stops  and  delivery  and  paperwork 

activities  of roughly constant length.  The route ends  with a trip back to the facility followed by 

assisting  in  reloading  or  paperwork.  The  Virginia  Tech  Focus  Groups'  table  14  (p.  77)  lists 

average  number  of deliveries  for  beverage  and  snack  delivery  drivers  as  just over  11  per day. 

Figure 25  in the Virginia Tech Focus  Groups  (p.  75)  indicates that the average SH driver in the 

focus groups spent 29 percent of their non-break time driving. 148 

All  SH drivers  are  modeled as  arriving at  work at 7:00 am,  the  median response to  time of day 

they  start  work.  They  are  modeled  as  having  awoken  a  half-hour  before  arriving  at  work. 

Sensitivity  tests  indicated  that  modeling  the  drivers  as  arriving  at  work  75  minutes  after 

awakening  made  minimal  differences.  Following  the  information discussed  above,  SH drivers 

are modeled as  performing non-driving work for  their first half hour on duty, followed by a half 

148  This  indicates that the driving hours limitations in the 2003 rules  would not constrain SH drivers. This average 
response of 29 percent of a work-day spent driving is  somewhat less than that suggested by the Virginia Tech Field 
Study question asking "What percentage of work time is driving?" The modal response in the field study was  50% 
(answers were restricted to <50%, 50%, >50%,  100%.) 

129 

hour  of driving  to  arrive  at  their  first  delivery  stop  and  a half-hour of non-driving  work  at  the 

first  stop.149  Drivers'  last  half hour is  modeled  as  non-driving  work.  For the remaining hours 

on-duty for SH drivers,  time is  modeled as  a repeating pattern of alternating deliveries  such that 

even numbered deliveries begins with a quarter-hour of driving followed  by three-quarters of an 

hour of non-driving work and odd deliveries begins with a quarter-hour of driving followed by a 

half-hour of non-driving work.  These lengths  were chosen such that SH drivers  drive just over 
30  percent  of the  day  for  average  workdays  of  10.3  hours  in  length. 150  Because  FMCSA  is 
interested  primarily  in  the  differences  in  crash  risk  among  the  proposals,  the  exact  number  of 

deliveries  or  length  of time  spent on each  aspect  of a  driver's  duties  is  less  important than the 

even distribution of driving throughout the day. 

This general pattern of daily schedules is applied to 25-day schedules. 151  The series of schedules 

are  adapted  such  that  the  SH drivers  do  not  work  on the  sixth and  seventh  day of the  week  to 

reflect the  typical  regular work week schedules found  in the  industry. 152  For a given night,  the 

amount  of sleep  is  modeled  based  on  the  calculated  relationship  between  sleep  and  time  on(cid:173)

duty.153  Sleep was  modeled for  SH drivers  as  ending a half-hour before leaving for  work.  The 

time  sleep  begins  varies  according  to  the  amount  of  total  time  (within  a  quarter  hour)  of 

estimated sleep.  A  25-day working schedule  was  input from every fourth  driver  into the Sleep 

Performance spreadsheet for  each of the  proposal  options  as  well  as  for  the current compliance 

level.  The schedules for each proposal vary only by the threshold at which individual work days 

are  truncated. 154  The  resulting  incremental  crash  incidence  calculation  for  each  scenario  is 

subtracted  from  a  baseline  crash  increment.  This  baseline  increment  represents  the  model's 

estimated  crash  risk  increment  from  five-day  work  week  schedules  of  8  hours  of sleep  with 

149  These time lengths were based partially on the approximate number of miles driving for each segment in 
Appendix J divided by 20 mph speeds in city between deliveries and by 40 mph from the terminal to  the first stop. 
150  This is the average length of work day according to  the Virginia Tech Field Study and the average length of 
work day modeled under current compliance levels.  The Virginia Tech Focus Group drivers provide a slightly 
longer average shift length of 10.89 hours. 
151  This is done by inputting the daily driving schedule pattern as an equation conditional on length of day and 
varying the 25-day schedule as  an input. 
152  Representatives involved in the SH industry indicated that most SH operations are based on a regular five-day 
work week.  Similarly, the majority of local pick-up and delivery respondents in the UMTIP survey indicated they 
worked five-days  in the past seven day pay period. 
153  There was no evidence found that the relationship between amount of sleep nightly and number of hours on 
duty should vary between LH and SH drivers. 
154  Additional drivers are not modeled explicitly under the simplifying assumption that replacement drivers will 
work and drive similar day lengths as the dataset average.

driving spread throughout the day. ISS  Given the assumptions  in the baseline, the model provides 
a  baseline  crash  increment  of  -1.72  percent,  just  slightly  below  the  a  percent  expected 
theoretically.  Because this  baseline is  subtracted from  the  increment for the  2003  rules,  its  size 

does not affect the results, which are presented at the end of the following section.

H.3.6.2  Weighting Crash Increments, Productivity and Proportion Fatigue-Related 

The crash risk increments calculated above  are  multiplied by the percentage of drivers  found  in 

each  cell  in the  driver schedule proportion matrices.  The resulting value is  subtracted from  the 

baseline crash increment  under schedules  with  eight hours  of regular sleep for  an  interim crash 

increment score for the pre-2003  compliance status  quo,  pre-2003 rule with full compliance, and 

2003 rule with full  compliance. 

These  interim  crash  increments  are  adjusted  for  the  differences  in  productivity  found  through 

155  Driving is spread throughout the day in order to  get an appropriate baseline that reflects an average of any time 
of day driving. 

131 

these  calculations  from  the  productivity  found  in  generating  the  cost  estimates.  Crash  risk 

estimates are scaled up or down using the ratio of productivity found  in the cost analysis  to that 

found  in the crash risk analysis.  The results  are multiplied by the proportion of truck crashes  in 

which  fatigue  may  have  played  a  role.  Only  truck  crashes  in  which  truck  driver  fatigue  is 

considered  to  have  potentially  played  a  role  are  included  in  this  proportion.  The  productivity 

adjustments  and  the  raw  fatigue-related  crash  increments  calculated  across  all  cells  in  a  driver 

proportion matrix are shown in table 62.

The final  step discussed in this section is  to  convert the raw crash increment into the percentage 

of crashes  that  are  related  to  fatigue,  starting  with  the  incremental  crashes  for  each option that 

occur  due  to  fatigue  (raw  fatigue  increment).  This  number  does  not  represent  fatigue-related 

crashes as  a proportion of all crashes, which ultimately is the proportion of interest.  To calculate 

this proportion, termed the fatigue-related percentage, the raw fatigue increment is divided by the 

sum  of the  fatigue  increment  and  the  baseline  of crashes  before  the  fatigue  increment.  The 

baseline  percentage of crashes  before  adding the  fatigue  increment is  simply  100 percent.  The 

sum of the raw fatigue  increment plus  the baseline percentage of total crashes is  the raw fatigue 

increment plus  100 percent.  The percentage of fatigue-related crashes, therefore, is the raw crash 

increments divided by 100 percent plus the raw crash increment or (raw increment)/(lOO percent 
+ raw increment). 156 

For the pre 2003  status  quo  scenario,  the raw crash increment of 11.5  percent is  divided by 100 
percent plus  11.5 percent or 11.5 percent 1(100 percent + 11.5 percent) = 10.3 percent.  The result 

156  As an example for clarification, suppose for the status quo that the fatigue increment were  100 percent.  That is, 
in this hypothetical example, fatigue causes as  many crashes in the status quo as  would occur without driving under 
fatigued conditions.  Fatigue, however, would not cause 100 percent of all crashes - only half.  This percentage is 
calculated by dividing  100 percent by  100 percent + 100 percent, or  100 percent/200 percent = 50 percent. 

132 

of these  calculations  are  shown  in  table  63,  which  also  presents  the  equivalent  fatigue-related 

crash results from the analysis of SH operations described above.

Calibration of SP Results to Empirical Fatigue Crash Estimates 

Because the  SP spreadsheet is  based on predictions  of changes  in  simulated crashes  rather than 

real-world  experience,  it  cannot  be  used  directly  to  estimate  the  percentage  of  crashes 

attributable  to  fatigue. 

Instead,  that  percentage  was  estimated  independently.  To  ensure  that 

they map well to  the real  world,  the  spreadsheet results  need to  be adjusted  so  that the scenario 

representing the status quo corresponds to this independent estimate of fatigue-related crashes. 

The  SP  spreadsheet  projected  the  fatigue-related  crash  percentage  (relative  to  what  would  be 

expected  for  non-fatigued  drivers)  of  10.3  percent  for  LH  operations  and  3.6  percent  for  SH 

operations.  The percentage of fatigue-related crashes  is  projected to be just under three times  as 

great for  LH as  for  SH operations.  This  difference  is  not  surprising,  given that SH drivers  are 

much more  likely than LH drivers  to  work during  the  day,  sleep  at  home  at  night,  and  are  less 

likely  to  be  pushed  to  work  extremely  long  hours.  Previous  research  supports  this  general 

conclusion.  For trucks on trips of 500 miles or more, the relative risk is even higher, at 2.35.,,157 

LH operations  account  for  61.8  percent  of fatal  truck  crashes,  55  percent  of injury-only  truck

Motor Carrier Safety Administration, April 2000, p.  28.

crashes,  and 59  percent of property-damage only crashes.  Weighting by the  number of crashes 

in each category, it was found that LH operations accounted for 58.2 percent of all crashes, with 

SH operations accounting for the remaining 41.8 percent.  Fatigue accounted for 8.15 percent of 

all  fatal  truck  crashes.  Combining  these  percentages  with  the  SP  spreadsheet  results  showing 

fatigue-related increments of 3.6 percent and 10.3 percent for SH and LH operations respectively 

indicates that all  of the estimates can be reconciled if the SP spreadsheet estimates are multiplied 

by an appropriate factor.  This  factor  was  found  by setting up  the following  equation for X,  the 

factor by which the SP spreadsheet estimates are to be multiplied: 

41.8% * 3.6% * X  +  58.2% * 10.3% * X  = 8.15% 

Rearranging terms and solving, X = 8.15%/(41.8%*3.6%+58.2%*10.3%) 

= 8.15%/7.45% = 1.0917. 

Thus, the SP spreadsheet can be calibrated to yield the 8.15% overall fatigue-related crash risk if 

the  SP  spreadsheet  estimates  of  the  crash  increments  are  multiplied  by  1.0917,  producing 

fatigue-related  increments  of 3.9  and  11.2 percent for  SH and LH  respectively.  Calibrating the 

estimates  of the  percentage  of fatigue-related  crashes  for  all  of the  options  by  multiplying  by 

1.0917 results in the estimates presented in table 64.

H.3.7  Risks Associated with New Drivers 

A  secondary impact of the proposed HOS  options  would be to  change the  number of relatively 

inexperienced  drivers  that  operate  in  the  trucking  industry.  Since  there  is  evidence  in  the 

literature  linking  experience  with  accident  rates,  any  changes  in  the  number  of inexperienced 

drivers  would  correspondingly change  the  overall  accident  rates  for  all  drivers  under  the  HOS 

134 

options considered. 

Calculations  for  the  changes  in  crash rates  for  new drivers  were performed  using data from  the 

UMTIP  driver  survey  and  the  discrete  time  proportional  crash  hazards  model  estimated  for 
drivers  based  on  that  data. 158  Using  the  regression  coefficients  for  experience  and  its  squared 
term from that model, and data on driving experience from Abrams, et al.  (1997),159  a crash risk 

as  a function of driving experience was estimated.  Chart 6 shows that relationship.

--,wg. crash risk for existing drivers 

The  function  above  indicates  a  28  percent  average  reduction  in  crash  risk  for  existing  drivers 

over their lifetime of driving.  Given the coefficients on years of experience and its  squared term, 

FMCSA  also  estimated  a  lO-year  weighted  average  change  in  accident  rates  for  new  drivers. 

The  lO-year time horizon was  chosen to  be consistent with the time period used in this  analysis 

for the costs and benefits calculations. 

158  See Michael Belzer, et al.  "Pay for Safety: An Economic Alternative for Truck Driver Safety", FMCSA, 
January 2002. 
159  See C. Abrams, T.  Schultz, CD. Wylie.  "Commercial Motor Vehicle Driver Fatigue, Alertness, and 
Countermeasures Survey."  Sponsored by U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. 
August  1997. 

135 

The weights  used for  this  calculation are  based on the distribution of experience levels  for new 

drivers.  According  to  conversations  with  industry  analysts,  approximately  85  percent  of new 

drivers  come  in  without  any driving  experience  outside  of their  training  and  the  remaining  15 

percent is estimated to have an average 4 years of driving experience. 

There is  evidence that suggests  that the high turnover rates,  especially in the  TL segment,  have 

been  driven  by the  nature  of tfi'e  hours  of service,160  among  other  factors.  Conversations  with 

industry experts  on driver  retention  suggest  that  the  proposed new  rules  could  have  a  positive 

impact on turnover to  the extent that they make the work schedules  in this  profession similar to 

some  of  the  other  blue-collar  occupations.  Experts  also  feel  that  the  industry  does  not  have 

adequate human resource programs to retain drivers, leading to the highest turnover rates  within 

the  first  12  months  of tenure.  If HOS  compliance  could  bring  about  any reductions  in drivers 

leaving trucking, it could reduce the need for hiring new inexperienced drivers 161  and change the 

composition  of the  new  driver  pool  such  that  it  is  on  average  more  experienced.  Moreover, 

according  to  some  industry experts,  there  is  a  growing  tendency  among  trucking  companies  to 

only hire  new drivers  with  some experience.  This  trend  can also  increase  the  average  level  of 

experience  for  the  new  drivers,  as  well  as  change  the  composition  of drivers  with  or  without 

experience  in the  analysis.  Because data are  not available  on reduction  in turnover because of 

the  proposed  new  rules  or  fraction  of  the  companies  that  only  hire  new  drivers  with  some 

experience, FMCSA looked at  a case in  which only 50 percent of the new drivers  come in with 

no  experience  and  the  rest  with  4  years  of experience.  The Agency also  looked  at  an  extreme 

case  where  99  percent  of the  new  drivers  have  no  experience.  The results  of this  analysis  are 

presented in table 65. 

160  See Gallup Organization study:  "Empty Seats and Musical Chairs: Critical Success Factors in Truck Driver 
Retention",  1997, and discussion of these issues in detail in Chapter 6. 
161  What is  also  worth mentioning is  that tenure seems to  be a bigger problem for TL companies, more than 
inexperience.  Driver retention rates are very low and improving HOS can have a positive impact on that.

Note that negative  crash  risk  percentages  imply that  in  that market segment,  there  is  actually  a 

reduction  in  overall  crash  risk  because  of  a  decrease  in  labor  demand  (or  increase  in  labor 

productivity) from the HOS rules. 

The main conclusion from  the  table given above  is  that  although the  Agency did  not  expect an 

increase in crash rates  if there  is  a need to  hire new drivers,  the relative  increases  in their crash 

risk probabilities are not that alarming.  The table also suggests that the increase in crash rates for 

new drivers  is  not very sensitive to the composition of experience levels  for  new drivers,  in that 

the changes in crash risks from the top row of the table to the bottom are generally much smaller 

than one percentage point whereas the risk reductions provided by the options are on the order of 

several percent.  This  analysis  used row 2,  the  85  percent - 15  percent division,  to  calculate the 

changes in dollar benefits.

crashes by the average damage imposed per large truck crash.  The average value of damages per 

crash shown in table 66,  $75,637,  is  based on research for  the  Department of Transportation. 162 

Multiplied together,  the  total  number of crashes  and the  value  of damages  per crash  yield  total 

annual damages of over $32 billion.

This total value of damages can be divided between LH and SH operations using the breakdowns 

of crashes by length-of-haul and severity.  Dividing the total number of crashes of each severity 

level  into  LH  and  SH  yields  the  total  number of crashes  for  each  length  of haul.  Multiplying 

these totals  by the average value per crash yields  an approximate value of damages from  all  LH 

and SH crashes.  These estimates are only approximate because the damages per crash differ by 

crash severity,  and  the breakdown of crashes  by length of haul  differs  according to  the  severity 

of the crash. 

The  last  line  of  table  67  shows  the  effect  of excluding  two  groups  of  LH  drivers  from  the 

calculation of benefits.  It is  not expected that drivers in these two relatively small groups - team 

drivers (for both private fleets  and for-hire carriers) and the LH drivers in LTL carriers - to have 

their work schedules significantly affected by changes in the HOS rules.  The changes in fatigue(cid:173)

related  crashes  estimated  to  result  from  the  options  would  not  apply  to  these  drivers  or to  the 

crashes  that  involve  them.  The damage  estimates  for  LH crashes  are reduced by  14.6  percent, 

which is the estimate of the percentage of LH VMT accounted for by these drivers.

The direct costs relative to the status quo are shown in table 70.  This table shows the costs of the 

current rules  with full compliance in the fourth column from the right.  Because there would be 

costs for compliance with the pre-2003  rules,  the costs of the current rules  are higher relative to 

the status quo than relative to the pre-2003 rule with full compliance.

Changes to Cost and Benefit Calculations from the 2005 HOS RIA 

In the 2005, HOS  rule,  FMCSA changed the regulations to constrain the use of sleeper berths to 

ensure that each sleeper berth period is  at least  8 hours,  and is  supplemented by a 2-hour break: 

that may be outside the sleeper berth.  At that time,  the Agency also  implemented an exemption 

from  maintaining  RODS  for  certain  SH  operations,  which  generates  an  ongoing  paperwork 

savings.  However, compliance costs and safety benefits to SH were unaffected. 

H.5.1  Work Patterns 

Patterns  of working  by drivers  in the  different sectors  of the  trucking  industry for  the  basis  for 

the 2005 HOS rule analysis.  In particular, the analysis focused on intensity of effort; this may be 

thought  of as  the  degree  to  which  drivers  work  close  to  the  limits  imposed  by the  HOS  rules. 

This  can refer to  hours  worked  (on-duty hours)  in  a  week and  in  a  day,  hours  driven  in  a day, 

days  worked  and  days  off  in  a  week.  These  measures  are  important  for  analysis  of  both 

productivity and safety effects of rule changes. 

H.5.1.1 

Data Sources 

The measures of work patterns and intensity were based on several data sources. There were four 

sets  of  data  on  current  experience  (under  the  2003  HOS  rule):  data  provided  by  Schneider 

National  on some aspects  of its  operations;  data from  the  Owner Operator Independent Drivers 

Association (OOIDA) based on a survey of its  members;  a survey of private carriers carried out 

by Professor Stephen Burks of the University of Minnesota;  and data collected by FMCSA (the 

"field survey"). The Schneider, OOIDA, and Burks data were gathered with the express purpose 

of obtaining information on use of three aspects of the new rule:  the  11th hour, restarts, and split 

sleeper periods.  Each of these sources is focused on a different sector of the industry. 

In  addition to  the  above  data,  information  was  used from  nine  private  interviews  with  carriers, 

eight small TL firms and one small L TL firm. 

H.5.1.1.1  Schneider 

141 

Schneider's  data  are  for  a  large  TL  firm  and  cover  approximately  16,000  drivers.  They  were 

taken from company records for August and October of 2004. 

H.5.1.1.2  OOIDA 

OOIDA  data  are  based  on owner-operators  and  a few  company drivers  for  TL firms.  OOIDA 

posted  a  survey  form  on  its  website  asking  drivers  for  information  on  use  of the  2003  rule 

provisions in June 2004. The data used here are based on responses from  1,223 drivers. 

H.5.1.1.3  Burks 

Professor Burks mailed a survey form to private carriers  asking for  information on their drivers' 

use of the new-rule features  in June 2004.  He received usable responses from 29 firms  covering 

3,311  drivers. 

H.5.1.1.4  FMCSA Field Survey 

The  field-survey  data  largely represent  company drivers  with  small  TL companies.  In terms  of 

distribution  of company  size,  this  makes  sense;  the  most  TL companies  are  quite  small.  In  the 

field  survey, 86 percent of for-hire,  TLlOTR companies have fewer than 25  tractors.  Viewed in 

terms  of truckload  company  size,  the  field  survey  is  a  representative  sample,  but  these  small 

companies  account for  a faid y small share of TLlOTR VMT,  about  17  percent.  L TL firms  and 

private carriers are sparsely represented in the field survey. 

These  data,  based  on  drivers'  log  books,  were  obtained  from  compames  III  the  course  of 

compliance reviews  or safety  audits.  Data cover  542  drivers  with  269  firms  in  the  period July 

2004 to January 2005. For each driver, data for one month of operation were collected. 

H.5.1.2  Average Hours Per Day-On-Duty and Driving 

Two basic measures  of work are  daily hours  of driving and total  work,  the latter term including 

all  on-duty time,  both driving  and  other work.  The field  survey and  the  Schneider data provide 

142 

information on  driving  time  per tour;  only  the  field  survey  provides  data  on on-duty hours  per 

tour.  The  field  survey  provides  some  information  on  local  drivers;  the  Schneider  data  do  not 

distinguish between local and OTR operations. 

A basic assumption in the calculation is that a day is  equivalent to a tour of duty. While there are 

exceptions,  most  drivers  work  one  shift  in  a  day.  A  tour  of duty  comprises  the  time  from  the 

driver's start of work to end of work,  including driving, other on-duty, and off-duty time. Results 

are in table 74. That the numbers for driving hours for Schneider and OTR drivers from the field 

survey  are  so  close  enhances  confidence  in  these  numbers,  even  though  the  Schneider  data 

include local service along with OTR operation.

H.5.1.3  Average Hours and Days of Work Per Week 

For OTR drivers,  a typical measure of work is  number of hours  in eight days,  which shows how 

close  drivers  work  to  the  70-hour  limit  for  eight  days.  A  more  complete  understanding  of 

drivers'  work  patterns,  though,  is  revealed by examining data on days  worked per week.  Both 

the field  survey and the Schneider data give hours worked in eight days,  62 hours  for  Schneider 
drivers,  59  hours  for  field-survey  drivers. 163  Some  intermediate  steps  are  required  to  convert 
these numbers  to  days  per week.  They are  first  divided them by 9.2,  the field  survey figure  for 

on-duty  hours  per tour  of duty,  to  obtain  days  worked  per  eight days  and  then  make  a further 

adjustment to obtain days worked per seven days. These results are presented in table 75. 

163  For both data sources, the analysis discarded all drivers with fewer than 50 hours of work in eight days on the 
grounds that they were not driving full-time in the period covered.

Intensity of Effort 

Examining  only  the  average  hours  of driving  and  hours  and  days  of work  might  lead  one  to 

conclude  that  all  drivers  work  well  within  the  limits  imposed  by the  HOS  rules.  Many  drivers 

work  and  drive  longer  hours  than  the  averages,  and  this  analysis  relies  on  the  percentages  of 

drivers that work close to the limits for estimating productivity and safety effects. The following 

show the distributions of daily driving and on-duty hours and on-duty hours in 8-day periods.

The OOIDA survey asked  for  frequency  of use of the  11th  hour but did not otherwise ask about driving  hours.  The 
figure presented here was  calculated from  the underlying survey data. 

It is  worth  noting  that  the  on-duty hours  show  a  pattern  relative  to  the  14-hour limit  different 

from that of the driving hours relative to the  II-hour limit. Drivers are driving ten or more hours 

in more than 25.0 percent of their work days  while reporting  13  or more on-duty hours for only 

8.0  percent  of days.  The  latter  number  suggests  that  drivers  are  generally  taking  two  hours  of 

break  in  a  14-hour  tour  or  their  normal  work  shifts  are  shorter  than  14  hours.  The  Agency 

suspects that both are true.  Inaccurate logging of on-duty hours could also be a factor.

Tables  77  and  78  show  that,  while  daily  on-duty  hours  tend  to  "bunch"  away  from  the  limit, 

multi-day  on-duty  hours  bunch  close  to  the  limit,  closer,  indeed,  than  is  the  case  for  driving 

hours.  Tables  76  and 78  give  information on differences  in behavior between company drivers 

and owner-operators. While driving hours show a marked difference, the difference in multi-day 

hours  is  slight.  Some of this  could be  accounted for  by the fact  that OOrDA data  include some 

owner-operators working on their own authority; those in the Schneider data are all leased. 

Regarding differences in the average driving hours listed in table 79, it should be noted that there 

are few  owner-operators in the field-survey data; the higher percentage of 11 th -hour use from the 

field survey, as  compared with Schneider, suggests that smaller companies may push harder than 

larger ones, insofar as  the driving limit is  concerned. The OOrDA data on the  11th hour could be 

seen  as  part  of such  a  pattern,  especially  if one  thinks  the  own-authority  owner-operators  are 

using  the  11th  hour  heavily.  However,  the  multi-day  hours  show  the  reverse  pattern.  For  65.0 

percent of reported instances, Schneider's drivers  have over 59 hours;  from the field  survey, the 

comparable number is  43.0 percent. This might suggest that a big company does not schedule as 

close to  the  driving  limits  as  a  smaller company might but enjoys  greater success  in  marketing 

and,  thus,  is  able to  keep  its  drivers  moving more consistently.  There could,  of course,  be  other 

145 

explanations. 

One must be wary of reaching too far in drawing  inferences  from  these  data.  To  the extent that 

data  from  different  sources  show  consistent  patterns,  one  can  use  this  information  in  analysis 

with some confidence.  One pattern that comes  through consistently is  that the preponderance of 

OTR drivers and trucking firms  are  not operating at,  or close to,  the HaS limits.  Approximately 

25  to  30  percent  of drivers  are  driving  more  than nine  hours  regularly  and  25  to  40  percent of 

drivers  are  regularly working  more than 64 hours  in eight days.  The  industry experts  consulted 

for this analysis agreed that this  is an accurate general view of industry operations. 

H.5.2  Use of New Provisions of the 2003 HaS Rule 

The analysis  examined the use of three aspects of the 2003  rule:  restarts,  the  11th hour,  and the 

split  sleeper-berth  provision.  The  data  come  from  the  sources  already  mentioned:  Schneider, 

OOIDA, Burks, and the FMCSA field survey. 

H.5.2.1 

Restarts 

All  four  of data  sources  reported on use of restarts.  OOIDA reported  that  almost  90 percent of 
drivers  used  the  restart  at  least  some  of the  time. l64  Burks  reported  that  private  carrier drivers 

used the restart on 61.0 percent of their runs. 165  Neither OOIDA nor Burks, however, reported on 

length of restarts. 

A driver using the restart provision may not be taking only the minimum 34 hours for the restart 

period.  Schneider  and  the  field  survey  both  reported  a  high  level  of use  of restarts  and  gave 

information on the length of restarts.  In Schneider's data,  only 2.0 percent of restarts  were only 

34  hours.  Depending  on  the  reporting  period,  one-quarter  to  one-third  of the  restarts  were  44 

hours  or  fewer.  Forty-three  percent  were  58  hours  or  fewer.  Schneider  showed  a  bi-modal 

distribution with  peaks  at  39  and  62  hours.  Presumably,  the  former  reflects  cases  in  which  the 

164  John H.  Siebert, "A Survey of  Owner-Operators and Company Drivers on their Use of Three New  'Hours of 
Service Features,'"  OOIDA Foundation, September  15,2004.

September  15, 2004 

146 

driver has  taken one full  day off,  plus  a  few  hours  from  the  preceding  and  following  days;  the 

latter would reflect two  full  days  off.  The field  survey shows  that 33.0 percent of restarts  were 

44 hours or fewer.  This comports well with the Schneider data.  On this basis, one can say that at 

least  one-third  of restarts  are  short  enough  to  bring  a  productivity  gain.  Using  the  alternative 

method  of the  moving  eight-day  period,  drivers  would  usually  have  to  stay  off more  than  44 

hours before returning to work. 

Anecdotal  information on company attitudes  towards  restarts  is  that they  like the  provision and 

find  some productivity gain even though  drivers  are  staying off more  than 34  hours.  Managers 

seem hesitant to demand a return to work after 34 hours, except in unusual  situations. It may,  of 

course,  be the case that taking only 34 hours  off would not fit  with the work schedule of many 
drivers, that is, there would not be anything for them to  do at the 35th  hour. For example, the 35th 

hour might come at 3:00 AM, and the company might have no use for the driver until  8:00 AM. 

When a TL driver comes off his restart, his first task is  to pick up a new load; the hour at which 

the company needs his services will be set by the requirements of the shipper of that first load. 

H.5.2.2 

Split Sleeper Berths 

Data clearly  indicate  that  most  drivers  never  split,  and  those  that  do  do  so  only  occasionally. 

Schneider data for October 2004 show 97  percent of drivers never splitting and only 0.4 percent 

splitting "regularly." Before the new rule,  Schneider did not allow solo drivers  to  split at all and 

has  only allowed them to  split on an 8-and-2 basis  under the new rule.  The data from  OOIDA 

and the field survey show many more drivers splitting occasionally but few splitting frequently.

The  Burks  data  show  a  higher  percentage  of frequent  splitting,  although  they  are  not  directly 

147 

comparable  with  those  from  the  field  survey  and  OOIDA.  They  suggest  that  52.0  percent  of 

drivers  split four  or fewer  times  a  month  with  the  rest  splitting  more  frequently.  It is  not  clear 

why private drivers  would split more frequently than others.  There might be a higher percentage 

of teams in Burks's data; evidence suggests that teams split more frequently than solo drivers. 166 

The  data  in  the  following  table  come  from  an  Insurance  Institute  for  Highway  Safety  (IIHS) 

survey  of drivers  at  weigh  stations  in  Pennsylvania  and  Oregon  and  from  FMCSA's  Driver 

Fatigue, Alertness and Countermeasures Study (DF ACS). 

The  IIHS  and  DFACS  findings  agree  that  teams  split  more  than  solo  drivers.  There  is  some 

anecdotal evidence that the incidence of splitting by teams  is  higher than that found by IIHS  and 

DFACS.  Several comments to the HOS  rule docket suggested higher percentages than these and 

also  indicated that team splitting is  generally balanced;  that is,  sleeper periods  and driving stints 
are  about  equal  at  four  to  six  hours  each. 167  The  IIHSIDFACS  findings  for  solo  drivers 

sometimes splitting are lower than those from OOIDA and the field survey.

Data on splitting  clearly  show  that  splitting  for  most  solo  drivers  occurs  on  an  occasional  and 

opportunistic basis. They do not build splitting into their operating routines.  When they do take a 

split period in the sleeper, they go right back to the ten-hour rest at the next rest period. This does 

suggest that most drivers find the limited rest period unsatisfactory and use it only to avoid some 

other  problem.  An  unexpected  period  of congestion  would  be  one  example.  However,  routine 

splitting is probably part of the daily operation of many teams. 

166  There is  also some ambiguity in the Burks survey which asked for the percentage of "runs" using the splitting 
rule but did not define runs. It appears that some respondents interpreted "run" to  be a multi-day period. The field 
survey data contained cases  in which drivers reported splitting, though one of the "split" r.est periods exceeded ten 
hours. These cases were discarded, but this  shows the danger of inaccurate logging of split sleeper periods.

Field-survey numbers for compliant drivers only. Burks data might overstate  11 th  hour  use because drivers reported 
11 th  hour use for "runs," which may encompass an entire trip spanning mUltiple work days. 

Data  show that the 11th hour is definitely being used.  Comparing Schneider data to OOIDA and 

the  field  survey  implies  that  big  companies  use  it  less  often  than  small  companies  or  owner(cid:173)

operators.  The  analysis  uses  the  assumption that usage  is  heavier for  smaller firms  and  sets  25 

tractors  as  the  demarcation point between big  and  small TL companies.  FMCSA estimates  that 

40 percent of TL VMT is from small companies and 60 percent is from large companies.

In the simulation model used to  assess impacts on the more complex types of carrier operations, 

a  truck's  progress  is  tracked  in  a  computer  program  as  the  driver  moves  between  origin  and 

destination  points,  choosing  new  loads  at  the  end  of each  run  from  a  set  of choices  randomly 

selected from a data base representative of inter-county shipment patterns.  The driver's choices 

are  made  on the  basis  of which loads  feasibly  can be picked up  and  delivered  within specified 

windows,  given  the  limits  imposed  by  the  need  to  stop  and  rest.  Within  feasible  choices,  the 

driver  is  assumed to  choose  (or be  assigned)  the  load that  is  most advantageous  in  terms  of its 

contribution to  its  productivity.  Because the HOS  rules affect which loads can be delivered, and 

change the amount of time that can be devoted to  driving,  the model is  able to  estimate impacts 

on productivity, and the accompanying changes in typical schedules.

The  model  starts  at  the  user  defined  home  terminal.  Out  of 20  randomly  generated  origin(cid:173)

destination  pairs,  it  chooses  the  pair  that  b~st  fits  its  schedule  as  well  as  maximizes  its 

productivity.  Then  it  moves  to  the  origin  terminal,  waits  until  the  pick-up  window  time,  and 

loads  the  shipment.  It then  drives  to  the  destination terminal,  waits  until  the  delivery  window 

time, and unloads the shipment.  At this point, the model again analyzes another set of 20 origin(cid:173)

destination pairs  and  repeats the same procedure prescribed above for the time duration defined 

by  the  user.  The  movement  of the  truck  in  the  model  is  constrained  by  HOS  rules  (i.e.,  all 

required  rest  periods)  allowing  the  user  to  compare  different  facets  of  HOS  rules  with 

assumption of full compliance. 

At  the  end  of the  simulation,  the  model  yields  an  output  that  shows  how  the  CMV  operator 

behaved at each time of day.  The truck's movement following the operation cycle is  recorded in 

the  schedule output table  which reveals  what the truck  was  doing  at  each  time  of the  day each 

day during the whole  simulation duration.  The duration of simulation is  defined by the user so 

the model can generate up  to  one year's  worth of the  schedule table.  Table  82  is  a snapshot of 

150 

the  schedule  table  showing  only  a  small  portion of it.  The  table  actually has  over 40  columns 

providing  details  such  as  time  of the  day,  day  of the  week,  driving  status,  load  status,  origin 

county, destination county, cumulative duty, driving, and rest hours.

H.S.4  LH Safety Benefits 

Safety  impacts  were  measured  by feeding  the  working  and  driving  schedules  from  the  carrier 

simulation model  into a fatigue  model to  project driver effectiveness levels,  and then estimating 

the  resulting  changes  in  crash  risks  for  different  cases.  Changes  in  fatigue-related  crash  risks, 

calibrated to  match realistic  levels,  were  then multiplied by the  value  of all  affected  crashes  to 

yield estimates of total benefits. 

The  approach  to  this  analysis  is  illustrated  in  the  flow  diagram  below.  The  crash  and  benefit 

analyses  use the output of the truck operations  simulations  as  the  starting point for  the analysis. 

The  operations  analyses  provide  a  series  of realistic  truck  driver  schedules  for  each  trucking 

industry  segment.  The  schedules  specify  driver  activity  for  each  half hour  (off duty,  on-duty 

driving,  and on-duty performing other activities  such as  loading,  unloading,  and  waiting) over a 

multi-day period.  The outputs of the simulations are also used as  inputs into cost modeling. 

The simulation model does not provide estimates on how the driver splits off-duty time between 

sleep  and other personal activities.  A separate analysis  to  address  this  question was  carried out 

151 

to  add  this  information  to  the  working  schedules,  based  on  sleep  pattern  surveys  and  similar 

research.  These  analyses  led  to  a  set  of algorithms  for  sleep  time  based  on  the  length  of the 

break and the time of day at the start and end of the break.

Benefit Calculation:  Value of 

Crashes and Damages Avoided 

The FAST/SAFTE human performance model, developed in part from research led by the Walter 

Reed Army Institute of Research,  was  used for the analysis.  The model  applies  a large body of 

sleep  and  fatigue  research,  including  circadian  rhythms  to  provide  an  operator  effectiveness 

percentage  relative  to  a  fully  rested  individual.  The  FAST/SAFTE  model  does  not  take  into 

account  TOT  effects,  so  a  separate  analysis  of these  effects  was  performed  to  determine  the 

relationship between TOT and crash risk.  However, because the  rule  adopted in 2005  made no 

changes in the maximum number of driver hours per day, the results of the TOT analysis did not 

figure  into the benefits  calculations of the  2005  rule,  but were used  to  evaluate alternatives  that 

152 

reduced maximum drive time to  10 hours. 

H.5.4.1  Off-duty Sleep Time Assignment 

In order to  use  the  FAST/SAFTE model  to  process  the outputs  of the  operational  model,  it  was 

necessary  to  determine  how  much  sleep  the  drivers  were  getting  and  when  that  sleep  would 

occur during  a given  off-duty period.  The productivity analysis  outlined  above  focused  on the 

lengths  of drivers'  on-duty,  off-duty,  and  driving  periods.  While  the  safety  model  requires  the 

length  of the  on-duty  and  off-duty  periods,  it  also  requires  the  amount  of sleep  taken  by  the 

driver,  and the placement of that sleep within the off-duty period. These are the two functions  of 

the sleep allocation model. After a driver's schedule has been separated into on-duty periods, off(cid:173)

duty periods and sleep periods, it is ready for input into the FAST/SAFTE model. 

The first  step in the sleep allocation process is  to determine how much sleep a driver is  expected 

to  get  based  on  past  work  history.  This  calculation  is  a  decreasing  function  based  on  the 

cumulative  amount  of  on-duty  time  in  the  previous  24  hour  period.  The  basic  function  is 

identical  to  the  one  used  in  the  2003  RIA.  For  a  driver  who  works  14  hours  a  day  on  a 

continuous  basis,  that  amounts  to  6.57  hours  of sleep  per  24  hour period.  Once  the  amount  of 

sleep  is  determined,  the  model  checks  to  see  how  much  sleep  the  driver has  received  over the 

previous  24  hour  period.  If the  driver  has  had  more  sleep  than  he  is  expected  to  get,  a  sleep 

surplus is  assumed to exist.  If the driver requires more sleep than he has received over the last 24 

hours,  he  has  a  sleep  deficit  and  the  model  allocates  sleep  until  the  driver's  deficit  has  been 

reduced to zero or until the driver begins his next on-duty period, whichever comes first. 

The second step in this process is  the actual placement of the sleep within the off-duty period. To 

begin,  the  model  consolidates  all  of the  driver's  sleep  within  a  period  of time.  For  off-duty 

periods  less  than 24  hours,  it  is  assumed that the driver will  rest  in a single session,  and  so  the 

sleep is  consolidated into a single sleep period. For rest periods equal to  or longer than 34 hours, 

the driver is  assumed to be taking a week-end break or restart of some length, and multiple sleep 

periods  will  be  allocated  based  on  the  length  of  the  rest  period.  Once  the  sleep  has  been 

consolidated,  it  needs  to  be  placed  within  the  off-duty  period.  After  some  test  runs  involving 

different  rest  period  lengths  and  times  of day,  it  was  assumed  that  the  driver's  sleep  period 

153 

should be placed as  late in his off-duty period as  possible, while still allowing him to wake up 30 

minutes prior to the beginning of his next on-duty period.  This 30-minute buffer was  included to 

allow the driver to overcome any sleep inertia present when he awoke.  It was determined that by 

placing  the  driver's  sleep  towards  the  end  of his  off-duty period,  it  allowed the  start of the  on(cid:173)

duty period with the highest possible level of effectiveness.  Whether drivers  base their personal 

sleep allocation decisions on this same rationality is not clear at this time. 

H.5.4.2 

Importance of Regularity in Driver Schedules 

Another observation from the results of the safety modeling was the importance of maintaining a 

'regular' schedule, referring to the driver's ability to work and rest in the same general timeframe 

over consecutive  work  days.  The  importance  of regularity  stems  from  the  effect  that  circadian 

rhythm  has  on  driver  effectiveness.  Those  drivers  that  had  substantial  shifts  in  their  daily 

work/rest  cycle  performed  considerably  worse  than  those  drivers  that  maintained  a  relatively 

constant schedule. It should also be noted that those drivers that shift to an entirely new schedule 

and  maintain it  over a period of weeks  will  eventually adapt to  the  new  circadian  rhythm.  It is 

those  drivers  that  shift to  a different  schedule on a daily  or weekly basis  that  show  substantial 

drops  in  effectiveness.  Chart  7  compares  effectiveness  (y  axis)  for  regular  versus  variable 

schedules across the work week (x axis) as  modeled in FAST/SAFTE.

The  'regular'  driver,  in addition to  showing a higher overall effectiveness, also shows much less 

154 

variability in effectiveness.  The large drops  in effectiveness shown in the output of the variable(cid:173)

schedule  driver  are  a  characteristic  of  a  constantly  changing  schedule.  In  the  two  examples 

above,  the  average  driver effectiveness  over a one-year period for  the  'regular'  schedule driver 

was  92.95%.  This  compares  very favorably to  an  average effectiveness of 77.89%  for  the driver 

with the variable schedule. 

H.5.4.3  Driver Effectiveness - Split v.  Continuous Sleeper Berth Periods 

Another  important  observation  from  the  FAST ISAFTE  model  was  the  difference  in  driver 

effectiveness values based on how drivers took their off-duty periods, and specifically their sleep 

periods.  Of particular interest were drivers who split their sleep period as  compared to  those that 

chose  not  to  split.  To  model  these  two  different  drivers,  the  Agency  used  the  FAST/SAFTE 

model to calculate the effectiveness of drivers with 10 hours of on-duty time and 14 hours of off(cid:173)

duty time each day. One driver was given the 14 hour off-duty period in one single block and the 

other driver was  given two 7 hour off-duty blocks. Twelve simulations  were run for each driver, 

each offset by 2 hours, to determine the combined effect of splitting and circadian rhythms.  Four 

weeks of driver data were modeled for this particular analysis.  In general, drivers who split their 

sleep period into two, 7 -hour blocks had lower levels of effectiveness than those drivers that took 

one  continuous  14-hour break.  Chart  8  shows  two  screen  shots  from  the  FAST/SAFTE  model 

comparing driver effectiveness for a continuous and a split off-duty period. 

Chart 8: Continuous (left) Versus Split (right) Off Duty Periods 

155 

At  different  start times  over the  course of a  24-hour period,  the  driver that  chooses  not to  split 

generally  has  a  higher  average  effectiveness  than  the  driver  that  splits.  However,  modeling 

shows  that drivers  beginning their shift between the hours of 22:00 and 0:00 show higher levels 

of effectiveness if they choose to split their rest period. Chart 9 illustrates these findings.

Estimate of Raw Crash Increment 

The  primary source of data to  form  a link between crash risk  and  PVT  scores  produced by the 

FAST/SAFTE  tool  was  a  laboratory  study  carried  out  by  Walter  Reed  Army  Institute  of 

Research,  in  which  driving  performance  on  a  truck  simulator  was  compared  with  PVT 

measurements  for  different  levels  of  sleep  deprivation.  A  robust  straight  line  relationship 

between the log of crashes during a 45  minute driving session and fatigue  level  as  measured by 

100-PVT score was  obtained.  Chart  10  shows  the  scatter plot and  the linear relationship.  PVT 

scores were scaled so that a score of 100 indicates a fully rested individual.

Estimate Actual Fatigue-Related Crash Risk. 

The final  stem in the analysis  is  to convert the raw  crash risk increments  to  an estimate of crash 

risk.  This  is  achieved  by  calibrating  the  crash  risk  increments  for  a  base  case  to  real-world 

fatigue  related  crash  data.  The  procedure  is  identical  to  that  described  used  in  the  2003  HOS 

RIA.  The raw crash risk increments are the percentage increase in crash risk over the crash risk 

for  a fully  rested  driver.  Thus  the  proportional change  in  fatigue-related  crashes  is  represented 

by the ratio: 

[100+crash increment for 2003  HOS Rules]/[100+crash increment for 2005  HOS Rules] 

The base case for  this  analysis  is  the fatigue-related crash risk for LH truck operations under the 

2003  HOS  regulations,  estimated at  7%  of all  truck involved crashes.  The fatigue-related  crash 

risk percentage for each of the HOS scenarios analyzed in this analysis is then as  shown below: 

7.0 x [lOO+crash increment for 2005 Rule] 

[100+crash risk increment for 2003 HOS Rule] 

157 

H.5.4.6 

Crash Risk Results 

The results  of the crash risk modeling were found  to  be decrease in crash risk of 0.3  percent for 

LH operations.  When these results  are weighted by VMT  such that experiences  the real drivers 

can  be  extrapolated  from  the  simulated  drivers,  the  crash  risk  reduction  was  found  to  be  0.1 

percent.  This percentage was valued by mUltiplying it by an estimate of the total annual damage 

associated with LH truck crashes.  For consistency with the 2003  HOS  analysis, the Agency used 

the value from the previous analysis  of $32.2 billion in year 2000 dollars,  or about $34.9 billion 

in  year  2004  dollars.  The  2003  RIA  also  presented  an  estimate  of  the  percentage  of total 

damages  that  were  caused  by  the  LH  segment.  Applying  the  same  percentage - just over  58 

percent - to  $34.9  billion  yields just over $20  billion.  The reduction  in risk attributable  to  the 
2005  HOS  rule,  given this  total  value for  all  LH truck crash damages,  is  0.1 % * $20 billion or 
about $20 million per year. 

H.5.5  LH Compliance Costs 

The  analysis  of costs  recognizes  that  the  different  provisions  of the  options  will  affect  carrier 

operations  in  complex  and  interacting  ways. 

It also  recognizes  that  these  effects  will  depend 

strongly  on  the  carriers'  baseline  operating  patterns,  which  vary  widely  across  this  diverse 

industry.  To produce a realistic measurement of the options'  impacts, then,  FMCSA divided the 

industry  into  broad  segments,  collected  information  on  operations  within  these  segments,  and 

then  created  a  model  of carrier  operations  as  they  are  affected  by  HOS  rules.  The  variety  of 

operational patterns made it necessary to limit the analysis to the most important cases. 

The  model  was  first  loaded  with  data  representative  of  shipping  patterns  and  carrier  cost 

structures,  and  tested to  ensure that it could realistically simulate typical lengths  of haul,  empty 

mile ratios, and productivity.  It was then set up to cover most important cases, under constraints 

representing the options, and used to  simulate carrier operations under different conditions.  The 

Agency  then  analyzed  the  data  representing  the  simulated  operations,  using  changes  in  miles 

driven  as  a  measure  of  productivity  impacts.  Output  measures  from  individual  runs  were 

weighted to  give  a realistic representation of the  affected industry,  including the  drivers'  use of 

the most important provisions.  The weighted changes  in productivity from  this  procedure were 

158 

then used to estimate the cost increases imposed on the industry by the options, using an analysis 

of the  changes  in  wages  and  other  costs  likely  to  result  from  changes  in  productivity.  These 

productivity-related  costs  were  combined  with  transition  costs  associated  with  shifting  to  new 

rules to produce estimates of total social costs. 

For representative  carriers  in each of several  carrier size  categories,  the  financial  impact of the 

HOS rule was estimated in terms of the change in net income (in 2004$) to the carrier,  as  well as 

a  change  in  profits  as  a  fraction  of operating  revenues.  The  approach  used  to  estimate  these 

impacts  involved  the  development  of a  pro  forma  financial  model  of firms  of different  sizes 

confronted  by  changes  in  productivity,  wages,  and  prices.  Financial  impacts  were  estimated 

under  two  assumptions  about  prices  of trucking  services:  unchanged  prices  (representing  the 

short run), and prices after industry-wide cost changes have been passed through to consumers. 

The  2005  rule  resulted  in  small  adverse  financial  impacts  (reduced  profits)  on  most  carriers, 

directly related to the magnitude of the drop in labor productivity.  The results  in terms of profit 

impacts relative to  revenues  seem to  suggest very small impacts  for firms  across  the wide range 

of size  categories  examined,  including both large  and small  entities.  The threshold for  impacts 

considered  to  be  of  moderate  size  is  generally  taken  to  be  one  percent  of revenues,  and  the 

average impacts of the rule fall well below that magnitude. 

H.5.5.1 

Core Cost Components 

A  significant  portion  of the  total  cost  is  driver  labor  costs.  Changes  in  the  number  of hours 

drivers  can  work  or drive  were  translated  to  changes  in  driver's  labor productivities  using  the 

simulation  model  explained  above.  These  changes  were  then  used  to  calculate  the  additional 

number of drivers  needed  to  achieve  full  compliance.  Changes  in  the  number  of drivers  were 

then  translated  into  labor  cost  changes  using  the  estimated  wage-hours  worked  functional 

relationship for truck drivers used in the 2003  HOS RIA, described in section H.2.1.1.1  and table 

49  above.  The  changes  made  in  the  2005  HOS  rules  were  also  evaluated  with  respect  to  the 

same non-wage costs considered in the 2003 HOS RIA, discussed in section H.2.2 above. 

The  results  of the  simulation  model  described  in  section  H.5.3  above  showed  a  3.9  percent 

159 

decrease  in  productivity  for  LH  drivers  (a  7.0  percent  decrease  for  regional  less  a  3.1  percent 

productivity increase for LH OTR) using split sleeper berths  as  a result of the elimination of the 

sleep  sleeper  berth  provision  in  the  2005  HOS  rule.  These  percentages  are  calculated  for  the 

simulated  drivers;  to  extrapolate  to  the  real  driver  population,  these  figures  were  weighted 

according  to  the  fraction  of total  VMT  attributable  to  these  drivers,  resulting  in  a  productivity 

loss  of 0.042  percent  (a  0.08  percent  decrease  for  regional  less  a  0.038  percent  productivity 

increase for LH OTR). 

The 2003  HOS  rule analysis found  that a 3.9 percent increase in LH labor productivity from the 

2003  rules  could  be  valued  at  about  $1  billion,  or  about  $275  million  per  percentage  point 

(referred to as  the "unit cost") in year 2000 dollars. The 2005 rule analysis updated this  figure to 

$298  million  per  percentage  point  of productivity  year  2004  dollars  using  the  GDP  deflator. 

Converting the total cost changes  to  a unit cost number,  as  is  done here,  is  possible because the 

2003  HOS  analysis  showed that there was  a linear relationship between changes  in driver labor 

productivity and the associated costs.  Table 83  presents the breakdown of LH unit costs.

Training Costs for New HOS Rules 

Several commenters provided data on costs of re-training drivers and other personnel on changes 

to the HOS  rules.  Costs per driver varied between $7S  and $lS0, and the Agency assumed $100 

in its analysis of the 200S HOS rule.  Using a 7-percent interest rate,  10 years as  the amortization 

period,  and  1.S  million  total  LH  truck  drivers  (the  same  basis  as  for  the  2003  RIA),  it  was 

calculated that the annualized re-training costs for the LH segment to be $21  million.
