Executive Summary 

 
 
This RIA evaluates the expected regulatory compliance costs, economic and environmental benefits, and potential impact on CCR beneficial 
use, of EPA’s proposed regulation of coal combustion residual (CCR) disposal by coal-fired electric utility plants.  The CCR disposal 
regulatory options evaluated in this RIA are based on EPA’s statutory authority contained in the 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA).  The main findings of this RIA are summarized below according to six sections: 
 

ES-1: 
ES-2: 
ES-3: 
ES-4: 
ES-5: 
ES-6: 

Regulatory Options Evaluated in this RIA 
Benefits of Avoided Future Groundwater Contamination (Human Health Protection & Avoided Remediation Costs) 
Benefits of Avoided Future CCR Impoundment Structural Failures (Avoided Cleanup Costs) 
Economic and Environmental Benefits from Future Increase in CCR Beneficial Uses by Other Industries 
Regulatory Compliance Costs 
Comparison of Regulatory Benefits to Costs 

 
 
ES-1:  Regulatory Options Evaluated in this RIA 
 
This RIA evaluates three options for RCRA regulation of CCR disposal at coal-fired electric utility plants.  All options (a) maintain the existing 
Bevill regulatory exclusion for CCR beneficial uses, and (b) propose the same set of 10 custom-tailored engineering controls (i.e., technical 
design and operating standards) for CCR disposal units: 
 

1.  Subtitle C “Special Waste” Option:  Regulate CCR landfills and impoundments as a “special waste” under Subtitle C requirements, and 

would require phase out of impoundments within five years. 

 
2.  Subtitle D Option (version 2): Composite liners required for all (i.e., existing and future new) CCR impoundments but only for new 
landfills.  For any CCR landfills and impoundments that closed before the effective date, there would be no regulatory controls over 
those units, unless the states choose to adopt controls over such units.  Also, all surface impoundments (existing and new) would need 
to have composite liners within 5-years of the effective date. 

 
3.  Subtitle “D prime” Option: Composite liners required only for new impoundments and landfills; unlined units could continue to 

operate.  This approach would be the same as the Subtitle D option above, except that existing impoundments would not be required to 
retrofit and install a composite liner, or close.

ES-2:  Benefits of Avoided Future Groundwater Contamination (Human Health & Avoided Remediation Costs) 
 
By establishing management and permit standards for CCR disposal units under RCRA, the proposed regulatory options will reduce 
uncontrolled releases and cancer risks, and improve detection and, if necessary, response to future groundwater contamination.  This RIA 
quantifies two components of groundwater protection benefits: (a) human cancer risks avoided from drinking contaminated groundwater, and 
(b) groundwater contamination remediation costs avoided.  Summary Exhibit 1 below presents the monetized results of this evaluation. 
 

•  Estimate of avoided human cancer risks from avoided future groundwater contamination by CCR disposal units: 

o  Individual skin cancer risks avoided (by eliminating the groundwater pathway for arsenic at CCR impoundments) are estimated 
up to 2 x 10-2 (i.e., a probability equal to 2 individual human skin cancer incidence risks for every 100 persons exposed) using 
the current IRIS skin cancer slope factor for arsenic. 
o  30,400 people use drinking water wells within one mile of coal-fired electric utility plants; of which 8,150 (27%) are children. 
o  Taking into account current CCR disposal unit designs, an estimated 145 (using the IRIS cancer slope factor) to 2,509 (using the 
NRC lung and bladder cancer slope factor1) future human cancer risks are expected to occur in absence of the proposed RCRA 
regulation, based on drinking water exposure to arsenic in CCR. 

•  Other human health risks from CCR disposal units not quantified in this RIA: 

o  Human non-cancer risks, including from selenium, cobalt, nitrate/nitrite, and molybdenum, which may be released to 
o  Cancer and non-cancer risks from arsenic and other metals released in effluent from CCR impoundments to surface waters.

ES-3:  Benefits of Avoided Future CCR Impoundment Structural Failures (Avoided Cleanup Costs) 
 
This RIA estimated future avoided cleanup costs from catastrophic impoundment failures, like the one that occurred at TVA’s Kingston TN 
coal-fired electricity plant in December 2008, which would be prevented under the proposed rule.  Given the increasing age of CCR

impoundments, the relative number that present high or significant hazard potential, and the history of CCR impoundment failures to date, this 
RIA presents three alternative scenarios of future catastrophic failures, the result for which are displayed in Summary Exhibit 2 below: 
 

•  Failure Scenario #1:  Extrapolation of future CCR impoundment failure probability based on the relative (a) recent historical occurrence 

frequency, (b) CCR quantity release magnitude, and (c) cleanup costs, associated with three recent (2005, 2008, 2009) CCR 
impoundment failures which exceeded 1 million gallons in release quantity each. 

•  Failure Scenario #2:  Assumes 10% of CCR impoundments in the high failure risk group (i.e., above 40 feet tall and over 25 years old) 

•  Failure Scenario #3:  Assumes 20% of CCR impoundments in the high failure risk group (i.e., above 40 feet tall and over 25 years old) 

fail over the next 20 years in absence of RCRA regulation.2

The proposed regulation has categories of other benefits from avoiding future CCR impoundment structural failures which this RIA did not 
quantify and monetize, including potential avoided costs associated with a few possible benefit categories: 
 

1.  Litigation costs: Avoided litigation and related costs associated with such damage events. 
2.  Riparian damages: Reduction of toxic chemical contaminated effluent discharges from CCR impoundments to surface waters (i.e., 

rivers and lakes) through future phase-out of surface impoundments.3 

3.  Non-cancer health risks: Reduction in human health risks from future reduction in human exposure to non-carcinogenic but otherwise 

toxic chemicals contained in CCR, such as selenium, cobalt, nitrate/nitrite, and molybdenum, which, as currently managed in CCR 

                                                 
2 Based on the responses to our CERCLA 104(e) information requests to utilities with impoundments, there are 96 impoundments that meet these criteria.  However, this 
RIA estimates that 16 of these impoundments have closed or are expected to close before the CCR rule is finalized and goes into effect.  Therefore, this analysis removed 
these 16 impoundments and based the estimated future impoundment failure cleanup costs on a subset of 80 CCR impoundments meeting the ‘at risk’ criterion. 
3   EPA is developing a regulatory proposal under the Clean Water Act to revise the current effluent guidelines for steam electric utilities.  Current guidelines only control 
pH, total chlorine, and total suspended solids (TSS).  EPA’s proposed CCR rule would eliminate CCR surface impoundments, eliminating much of the risk that would be 
addressed under revisions to the effluent guidelines, including risks posed by arsenic, selenium, mercury, cadmium, copper, chromium, and nickel.

disposal units, can exceed the human health hazard quotient (HQ) or Maximum Contaminant Limit (MCL).  Chapter 5 of this RIA 
provides a list of contaminants of concern in CCR surface impoundment effluent and potential human health and environmental effects. 
4.  Dry CCR disposal risks: Human health effects from improperly managed dry disposal, which are based on ongoing research by EPA’s 

Office of Research & Development (ORD), may pose greater risks than previously estimated by EPA in 2000 and 2007. 

 
 
ES-4:  Economic & Environmental Benefits from Future Increase in CCR Beneficial Uses by Other Industries 
 
This RIA evaluated the potential impact that the CCR proposed rule may have on beneficial uses of CCR by other industries.  Baseline CCR 
beneficial use at the current 62 million tons per year rate (2009) is estimated in this RIA to provide $26 billion per year in nationwide social 
benefits consisting of: (a) materials cost savings, plus (b) lifecycle avoided pollution benefits, plus (c) avoided CCR disposal costs to the 
electric utility industry.  On a present value basis over the 50-year future period-of-analysis (2012-2061) applied in this RIA, the present value 
of CCR beneficial use amounts to $778 billion (@7% discount).  Although the industries which use CCR for beneficial uses are not subject to 
the requirements of the CCR proposed rule, this RIA presents three alternative scenarios of potential induced effect of the CCR rule on future 
CCR beneficial use, consisting of increased use (scenario #1), decreased use (scenario #2), and no change (scenario #3).  This RIA quanfities 
both scenario #1 and scenario #2 incrementally in relation to the “no change” scenario #3.  EPA believes the increasing beneficial use scenario 
#1 is most likely because (a) the proposed CCR regulation is targeted at CCR disposal not at CCR beneficial uses, (b) all CCR regulatory 
options retain the existing RCRA Bevill exemption for CCR beneficial uses, and (c) the added cost of regulatory compliance will make 
beneficial use relatively more cost-effective and represent an “avoided disposal cost incentive”4 to electric utility plants to increase their supply 
of CCR to industrial markets for CCR as a raw or intermediate input into industrial manufacturing and construction activities.  Furthermore, 
EPA does not believe that market “stigma” of CCR regulation under RCRA Subtitle C --- as alleged in numerous stakeholder letters to the EPA 
in 2009 --- will result in a reduction in future annual CCR beneficial use, because the proposed rule designates the Subtitle C option as a 
“special waste” rather than as a “hazardous waste.”  Summary Exhibit 3 below presents the results for both the increase scenario #1 and the 
decrease scenario #2. 

                                                 
4 The concept of “avoided disposal cost incentive” is recognized and defined by the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) on its website as follows: 

“If a [coal-fired electric utility] plant markets its [CCR] into commercial applications, then disposal of this [CCR] is not required.  Not only is a revenue stream 
created for the [coal-fired electricity plant] but also the need to dispose of the [CCR] is avoided.  As discussed above, disposal is not just the transportation and 
placement of [CCR] in a disposal site.  The need for future space is a concern.  If [CCR is] marketed, then the need to develop future [CCR disposal] sites 
(including land acquisition, permitting, design and construction costs) is avoided ….  It is not uncommon for a company to help offset the costs of transportation or 
placement at construction sites by providing the contractor or trucking firm a payment of some sort.  For example, if the cost of disposal at a plant is normally four 
dollars a ton, then the company may arrange a payment of four dollars or less to the contractors to cover transportation and placement costs.  The difference 
between the amount of this payment and the cost of disposal is also referred to as “avoided disposal costs.”  Source: ACAA Frequently Asked Question nr. 14

ES-5:  Regulatory Compliance Costs 
 
Chapter 4 of the RIA presents the estimated costs for industry compliance (and for government implementation) of each regulatory option.  
Summary Exhibit 4 below presents the estimated costs on a present value basis.  The RIA presents three categories of regulatory compliance 
cost.  These regulatory costs are incremental to an estimated $5,556 million per year average annual baseline (i.e., current) cost to the electric 
utility industry for CCR disposal, which represents a baseline cost of $76,678 million in present value on a 7% and 50-year discounting basis.

The dry conversion cost estimate incorporates projection of the recent (1995-2009) electric utility industry trend converting away from wet 
CCR disposal to dry CCR disposal.  In fact, there are several upcoming EPA regulations which could accelerate this trend but are not reflected 
in the cost estimate of this RIA.  These are anticipated rules under the Clean Air Act which will increase the installation of air pollution 
scrubbers and other air emission control technology at coal-fired power plants, as well as new wastewater effluent guidelines under the Clean 
Water Act which will require installation of treatment technology for wastewater discharges from CCR impoundments to surface waters.

ES-6:  Comparison of Regulatory Benefits to Industry Compliance Costs 
 
The set of three Summary Exhibits 5, 6 and 7 below compare the estimated regulatory costs to estimated regulatory benefits, using “net 
benefits” and “benefit-cost ratio” comparison indicators.  The three Exhibits are based on the three alternative scenarios about the potential 
induced impact of the CCR rule on future annual CCR beneficial use as presented in Section 5C of this RIA (i.e., increase, decrease, and no 
change, respectively).  All three Summary Exhibits below present costs, benefits, and net benefits on both a present value and average 
annualized equivalent basis, based on a 7% discount rate.  A set of exhibits in Chapter 6 of this RIA present these values based on a 3% rate.

Problem Statement:  The Need for RCRA Regulation of CCR Disposal 

Institutional Context 

 
 
1A. 
 
For purpose of evaluating Federal regulations, the 1993 Executive Order 12866 “Regulatory Planning and Review” (Section 1(b)(1)) requires 
each Federal regulatory agency to identify the problem that it intends to address, including where applicable, the failures of private markets or 
public institutions that warrant new agency action, as well as to assess the significance of the problem.  In line with this requirement, this 
Chapter provides a problem statement consisting of the institutional context (i.e., prior EPA actions), significance of the problem (i.e., evidence 
of environmental damages), and characterization of market failure. 
 
In September 2003, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated its guidance to federal agencies on the development 
of regulatory analysis required under Section 6(a)(3)(c) of the 1993 Executive Order 128665 “Regulatory Planning and Review.”  The updated 
guidance is OMB’s September 17, 2003 “Circular A-4 Regulatory Analysis.”6  Section A (Introduction) of Circular A-4 defines three key 
elements of good regulatory analysis: 
 

1.  Statement of the need for the proposed regulation. 
2.  Examination of alternative approaches. 
3.  Evaluation of the benefits and costs (quantitative and qualitative) of the proposed regulation and the main alternatives. 

 
Concerning the first basic element listed above (i.e., statement of the need for regulation), Section B of Circular A-4 requires federal agencies 
to demonstrate that the proposed regulation is necessary.  The Circular defines four categories of possible regulatory need: 
 

1.  Required by law:  If the need results from statutory or judicial directive, agencies should describe the: 

a.  specific authority for the proposed regulation 
b.  extent of discretion available to the agency 
c.  regulatory instruments available 

2.  Necessary to interpret law. 
3.  Market failure: Three examples cited in Circular A-4 (pages 4 & 5) are: 

a.  externality, common property resources and public goods 
b.  non-competitive market power 
c.  inadequate or asymmetric information 

4.  Other social purposes:  Six examples cited in Circular A-4 (page 5) are: 

a.  make government operate more efficiently

As explained below, EPA’s proposed RCRA7 regulation of coal combustion residual (CCR) disposal at coal-fired electricity plants is both 
required by law and will correct market failure. 
 
 
1B.  EPA’s Proposed Regulation of CCR Disposal Is Required by Law 
 
In 1976, Congress amended the 1965 Solid Waste Disposal Act (the first federal statute that specifically focused on improving solid waste 
disposal methods) by adding industrial hazardous waste management requirements as Subtitle C, among other new requirements.  This 
amendment is the 1976 Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA).  The EPA’s regulatory evaluation of coal combustion residues (CCR) 
dates back to 1978, two years after enactment of RCRA.  In December 1978, the EPA proposed the first industrial hazardous waste regulations 
to implement Subtitle C (i.e., Sections 3001 to 3020 of RCRA).  At that time, the EPA recognized that certain large-volume industrial wastes, 
including wastes from the combustion of fossil fuels (aka “CCR” as named in this RIA), might warrant special treatment under RCRA 
regulation.  On 18 December 1978, EPA proposed but deferred and never finalized a relatively limited set of ten RCRA Subtitle C industrial 
hazardous waste regulations for the management of CCR.8  Included in this deferral of hazardous waste requirements were six categories of 
industrial wastes --- which EPA termed “special wastes”9 --- until further study and assessment could be completed by EPA to determine their 
risk to human health and the environment. The six categories of special wastes included:  
 

1.  Cement kiln dust  
2.  Mining waste  
3.  Oil and gas drilling muds and oil production brines  
4.  Phosphate rock mining, beneficiation, and processing waste  
5.  Uranium waste  
6.  Utility waste (i.e., fossil fuel combustion waste by electric utility plants) 

b.  redistribute resources to select groups 
c.  prohibit discrimination 
d.  protect privacy 
e.  permit more personal freedom 
f.  promote other democratic aspirations 

 
These wastes typically are generated in large volumes and, at the time, were believed to possess less risk to human health and the environment 
than the wastes being identified for regulation as RCRA hazardous waste.  On 12 October 1980, Congress enacted the Solid Waste Disposal 
Act Amendments of 1980 (Public Law 96-482) which amended RCRA in several ways.  Pertinent to “special wastes” were the Bentsen and 
                                                 
7 RCRA = Resource Conservation & Recovery Act of 1976: http://www.epa.gov/waste/laws-regs/rcrahistory.htm 
8 Federal Register, Vol. 43, No. 243, 18 December 1978, page 59015, section 250.46-2 “Utility Waste” of “Hazardous Waste Guidelines and Regulations.”  This action 
proposed the following ten regulatory conditions: (a) waste analysis standards, (b) waste site selection standards, (c) waste site security, (d) waste shipment manifesting, (e) 
recordkeeping, (f) reporting, (g) waste site visual inspections, (h) waste site closure, (i) waste site post-closure care, and (j) groundwater monitoring.

•  1980 Bevill Amendment (RCRA 3001(b)(3)(A)(i-iii)): Exempted fossil fuel combustion waste; waste from the extraction, beneficiation, 

and processing of ores and minerals (including phosphate rock and overburden from uranium ore mining); and cement kiln dust. 

 
The Bevill and Bentsen Amendments required EPA to complete full assessments of each exempted waste and submit a formal report to 
Congress on its findings.  As itemized in Appendix A to this RIA, since 1978, EPA continued to evaluate CCR (as well as the other five waste 
categories) for different possible RCRA hazardous and non-hazardous waste regulatory approaches.  The proposed RCRA regulation this RIA 
supports is a continuation of those prior evaluations. 
 
 
1C.  EPA’s Proposed Regulation of CCR Disposal Will Correct Market Failure 
 
OMB’s 2003 Circular A-4 “Regulatory Analysis” guidance (pages 4 to 5) to Federal agencies for implementation of Executive Order 12866 
identifies three major types of market failure: 
 

1.  Externality, common property resource, and public good 
2.  Market power (i.e., lack of market competition from monopolies) 
3.  Inadequate or asymmetric information 

Bevill Amendments10 which exempted “special wastes” from regulation under Subtitle C of RCRA until further study and assessment of risk 
could be performed: 
 

•  1980 Bentsen Amendment (RCRA 3001(b)(2)(A)): Exempted drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the 

exploration, development, and production of crude oil or natural gas or geothermal energy. 

 
The CCR proposed rule which this RIA supports may be characterized as addressing the “negative externality” of environmental pollution and 
damages from CCR disposal landfills and impoundments.  As summarized in the “Benefits” Chapter 5 of this RIA, there are a number of 
historical and recent environmental damage cases which represent externalities, in that some or all of the (a) human health damages (i.e., 
human cancer cases from contaminated groundwater near CCR disposal sites) and (b) environmental damages (i.e., ecological damages, natural 
resource damages, and socio-economic damages from CCR spills/releases from structural failures in CCR disposal impoundments) may be 
external to the capital and operating costs of the electric utility plants.  If implemented, the CCR proposed rule may be expected to reduce this 
market failure externality, by internalizing into the capital and operating costs of the electric utility plants, the added costs of installing 
engineering controls and oversight of the physical integrity of CCR disposal units. 
 
Firms are sometimes held accountable for some of the external costs through lawsuits brought by affected citizens.  However, the system of 
accountability can be imperfect.  The primary human bearers of the external costs from CCR disposal are households residing disposal units.  
When an unorganized group of households suffer external costs, they face a host of obstacles to having their costs recuperated.  They must 
                                                 
10 These 1980 RCRA “special waste” amendments are named after US Senator Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX; Senate service years 1971-1993) and US House Congressman Tom 
Bevill (D-AL; House service years 1967-1997).  Source: Biographical Directory of the US Congress at http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp

form a coherent organization and they must have enough funding to launch and maintain a lawsuit.  On the other side of such litigation, 
households usually face a single firm often with greater legal funding resources.  This imbalance suggests that external costs of leachate 
contamination from industrial waste disposal sites (such as CCR landfills and impoundments) may not be recuperated. 
 
The CCR proposed rule also addresses a second source of market failure – inadequate or asymmetric information.  Citizens residing near CCR 
disposal sites may be unaware of exposure to chemical contaminants contained in CCR leaching from disposal units.  Thus, while nearby 
citizens may have the right to legal lawsuits to recuperate health and property damages, citizens may not be aware of the need to do so until 
health risks (and health costs) have already been incurred. 
 
A very recent example of negative externalities associated with structural failures is the ecological and socio-economic damages and costs 
associated with a large environmental disaster involving the collapse of a CCR impoundment in 2008.  On 22 December 2008, over a billion 
gallons (i.e., 5.4 million cubic yards) of CCR was unintentional environmental released over 300 acres from the collapse of a Tennessee Valley 
Authority (TVA) coal-fired electric utility surface impoundment in Kingston TN.  This event caused significant damage to 40 homes, the 
Emory River, a nearby recreational lake, community roadways, a gas pipeline, and a railroad.  As indicated in Exhibit 5B-2 of this RIA, the 
estimated cleanup costs to the TVA --- not including social costs of ecological damages and community socio-economic damages --- are 
estimated at $933 million to $1.2 billion.  This event attracted major citizen, national press, and Congressional interest in the subject of CCR 
management and the urgent need for prevention of such future environmental and community damages.  In the wake of this disaster, during her 
14 January 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, EPA Administrator-designate Lisa P. Jackson, testified11: 

“I think that you’ve put your finger on a very important thing that EPA must do right away, which is to assess the hundreds 
of other sites that are out there.  Many of them …  are … up hill from schools or from areas where just the physical hazard 
of having this mountain of wet coal ash, if there’s a break, can endanger lives immediately.  So I would think that EPA needs 
to first and foremost assess the current state of what’s out here and where there might be another horrible accident waiting 
to happen … EPA currently has and has in the past, assessed its regulatory options with respect to coal ash, and I think it’s 
time to re-ask those questions and re-look at the state of regulation of them from an EPA perspective.” 

 

 

 

 

According to a 23 January 2009 news report,12 there was growing Congressional interest for either the EPA with its existing RCRA regulatory 
authorities, or the Congress with potential new legislation, to regulate CCR disposal units: 

“Several lawmakers have introduced, or announced plans to introduce, competing legislation to regulate CCR. For example, 
Senate Environment & Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said she would introduce legislation 
compelling EPA to regulate CCR in the event the Obama EPA fails to act soon. "If we are not satisfied with action we may 
move legislatively," Boxer told EPA Administrator-designate Lisa Jackson at a January 14 [2009] confirmation hearing. "I 
don't want to get to that point because I think you have the authority to regulate this. It needs to be done."”

Just three weeks after the TVA’s Kingston TN CCR impoundment disaster, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall (D-
WV) introduced legislation requiring federal standards to regulate the engineering of CCR impoundments.13  Introduced on 14 January 2009, 
the Coal Ash Reclamation and Environmental Safety Act of 2009 (H.R. 493) directs the Department of Interior to impose uniform federal 
design, engineering, and performance standards on CCR impoundments to avoid a repeat of the damage done in Kingston TN.  The legislation, 
which requires minimum design and stability standards for all surface impoundments constructed to hold coal ash, draws on the regulatory 
model for impoundments that is used for coal slurry management under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). 

In a letter dated 02 March 2009, the Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice, joined by the National Resources Defense Council, the 
Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, and 104 other environmental groups requested EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson “to act as soon as 
possible” to regulate CCR.  A letter signed by the groups and delivered to EPA on 03 March 2009 identified 12 principles to guide the 
development of EPA standards.  These include the phase-out of CCR surface impoundments, locating CCR disposal sites away from 
groundwater or surface water, requiring liners, leachate collection systems and adequate monitoring, and requiring industry to assume long 
term liability for cleanup: 

 

 

 

“The recent disaster at TVA's Kingston Plant stands as a startling reminder that federal standards for CCR are long 
overdue. For too long, power companies have been able to dump CCR, laden with a host of toxic metals like arsenic, 
selenium, lead, mercury, and boron, in unlined mines, quarries, landfills, and surface impoundments.  Without 
federal standards governing disposal practices, contaminants can leak or spill from these dump sites, threatening 
human health, natural resources and wildlife.”14 

On 04 March 2009, US Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Tom Carper (D-DE) submitted Senate Resolution 64 to the Senate Committee on 
Environment and Public Works.  This resolution calls on the EPA to “immediately” inspect all CCR impoundments and landfills operating at 
coal-fired electricity plants, and to propose and finalize “as quickly as possible” rules to regulate CCR under RCRA.15

Potentially Affected Industries & RCRA Regulatory Options 

Identity of Potentially Affected Industries 

 
 
2A. 
 
There are two categories of industries which may be directly affected by the CCR regulatory options. “Directly affected entities” are 
entities potentially subject to any of the rule’s requirements.16  In addition, there are 14 or more industries which beneficially use CCR. 
 

1.  Coal-Fired Electric Utility Industry 

 
The scope of industrial plants directly affected by the regulatory options is classifiable according to at least two different glossary systems: 
 

•  Classification #1 of 2:  The scope of industrial plants is classifiable as “coal-fired electric utility plants” under the US Census Bureau’s 

North American Industrial Classification System” NAICS code 22 “Utilities” economic sector, and in that sector, as a subgroup of the 
1,245 establishments within the NAICS 221112 “Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation” industry:17 
NAICS 221112: 

This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating fossil fuel powered electric power 
generation facilities. These facilities use fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, or gas, in internal combustion or 
combustion turbine conventional steam process to produce electric energy. The electric energy produced in 
these establishments is provided to electric power transmission systems or to electric power distribution 
systems. 

 

•  Classification #2 of 2:  The scope of industrial plants is classifiable as “electric utilities plus independent power producers” under the 

Energy Information Administration (EIA) categorization system for its coal combustion electric power sector statistics:18 
Electric utility: 

Any entity that generates, transmits, or distributes electricity and recovers the cost of its generation, transmission or 
distribution assets and operations, either directly or indirectly, through cost-based rates set by a separate regulatory 
authority (e.g., State Public Service Commission), or is owned by a governmental unit or the consumers that the 
entity serves.  Examples of these entities include: investor-owned entities, public power districts, public utility 
districts, municipalities, rural electric cooperatives, and State and Federal agencies. 

Independent power  A corporation, person, agency, authority, or other legal entity or instrumentality that owns or operates 
producer: 

facilities for the generation of electricity for use primarily by the public, and that is not an electric utility.

2.  Waste & Environmental Management Services Industries 

 
In addition, because some electric utility plants transport their CCR to either company-owned or to commercial offsite landfills, and because 
some regulatory options may trigger RCRA facility-wide corrective action, the regulatory options of the proposed rule may also affect: 

NAICS 562211: 

NAICS 562212: 

NAICS 562219: 

NAICS 562910: 

Hazardous waste treatment and disposal industry (may be affected under the RCRA Subtitle C regulatory 
options evaluated in this RIA). 
Solid waste landfill industry (may represent baseline offsite CCR landfills to which the estimated 149 of the 
495 electric utility plants may transport some or all of the 15 million tons per year CCR for offsite disposal). 
Other non-hazardous waste treatment and disposal industry (may represent baseline offsite CCR landfills to 
which some or all of 149 of the 495 electric utility plants may transport some or all of the 15 million tons per 
year CCR for offsite disposal). 
Environmental cleanup/remediation services industry. 

 

 

3.  Industries Which “Beneficially Use” CCR 

 
According to the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA)19 as of 2007 there are over 15 industries which “beneficially use” CCR for 
industrial applications.  These industrial applications are listed below with corresponding NAICS20 codes estimated by EPA ORCR.  Because 
the regulatory options evaluated in this RIA establish CCR disposal requirements, industries which beneficially use CCR are characterized in 
this RIA as potentially “indirectly” affected by the proposed rule rather than “directly” affected (i.e., subject to the rule’s requirements). 
 

1.  Concrete/concrete products/grout 
2.  Blended cement/raw feed for clinker 
3.  Flowable fill 
4.  Structural fills/embankments  
5.  Road base/sub-base 
6.  Soil modification/stabilization 
7.  Mineral filler in asphalt 
8.  Snow and ice control 
9.  Blasting grit/ 
     Roofing granules 
10. Mining applications

2B.  Other Industries with CCR Disposal Units Not Covered by the Proposed Rule 
 
The scope of the proposed rule excludes two other categories of CCR disposal units from the regulatory options.  These other two categories 
are identified here to provide a rough estimate of potential additional cost for regulation if they were added to the scope of the rulemaking or 
addressed in a separate but similar rulemaking. 
 

•  Inactive/Abandoned CCR Disposal Units Excluded from Scope 

 
The scope of the proposed rule only covers active (i.e., operating) CCR disposal units used by electric utility plants.  There are two other 
operating status categories consisting of an estimated count of at least 197 additional CCR disposal units excluded from the scope of the rule:21 
•  Inactive units: 
CCR impoundments and landfills not in operation or not receiving CCR.  Inactive impoundments may receive CCR in 
the future, becoming active again, and therefore have not been closed permanently. 

•  Abandoned units:  CCR impoundments and landfills not in operation and closed.  These impoundments usually have been filled to 

capacity and have been permanently closed. 

 
In absence of inventory data on inactive units, the nationwide count of such inactive and abandoned units is indirectly and roughly estimated in 
this RIA based on known data for large volume coal mining slurry waste impoundments.  There are an estimated 1,600 coal waste 
impoundments in operation across the US in coal-related industries (i.e., coal mining industry plus industries which burn coal).  In addition, 
there are another 670 coal waste impoundments which are no longer in operation but still contain coal waste slurry (i.e., inactive or 
abandoned).22  These two counts represent a ratio of 0.42 inactive/abandoned:to:active (i.e., 670:to:1,600). 
 
In absence of national survey data, multiplying the 0.42 inactive:to:active coal waste impoundments ratio by the 158 coal-fired electric utility 
plants estimated in this RIA using CCR impoundments, yields an estimate of at least 66 inactive/abandoned CCR impoundments may be 
located at electric utility plants (i.e., (158 impoundment using electric utility plants) x (0.42 ratio) = 66).

Responses and Alternatives, National Academy Press,  2002 at http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=030908251X 
22 Source: Counts of 1,600 active coal waste impoundments and 670 inactive or abandoned coal waste impoundments from the prior footnoted source. 
 

20 

This RIA did not discover similar data for coal waste landfills in active and inactive/abandoned status.  For purpose of a rough estimate in this 
RIA, multiplying the 0.42 inactive/abandoned:to:active ratio by the 311 electric utility plants which use landfills, indicates there may be at least 
131 inactive or abandoned CCR landfills at or near electric utility plants (i.e., (311 landfill using electric utility plants) x (0.42 ratio) = 131). 
 
As of 2004, the Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) oversees 646 active coal mining slurry impoundments in the US, which implies 
954 remainder active coal slurry impoundments (i.e., 1,600 – 646 = 954).23  Of these, this RIA estimates at least 158 active impoundments at 
158 electric utility plants, which implies that a fraction of 796 other active coal waste impoundments (i.e., 954 – 158 = 796) may be located at 
electric power plants in non-utility industries (see the next sub-section below “Other Industries Excluded from Scope”). 
 

•  Other Industries Excluded from Scope 

 
The scope of the proposed rule only includes NAICS code 22 coal-fired electric utility plants (495 plants).  However, there is a range of 139 to 
759 non-utility facilities which currently, or have the capacity to, burn coal and thus generate CCR.  Adding these facilities to the scope of the 
proposed rule could increase the cost estimates by 2% to 28%.  This range is based on the following two data sources: 
 
Source #1: 

As displayed below in Exhibit 2A based on 2005 data from the DOE-EIA, there are 139 non-utility coal-fired electricity plants 
owned and operated by 8 other industrial sub-sectors involving 27 industries.  Appendix B of this RIA contains a list of these 
other industry plants according to NAICS industry codes.  If these other non-utility industries were to be added to the scope of 
the CCR proposed rule, a rough estimate of potential additional cost and benefit impacts would be between 2% and 28% relative 
to the impacts estimated in this RIA: 

•  >2%: 

•  <28%: 

Compared to the 369,183 megawatts (MW) nameplate capacity for the coal-fired electricity plants contained in 
the 2005 DOE-EIA database (which contains data on electricity plants at least 10 MW nameplate capacity in 
size), the 5,959 MW capacity of the 139 non-utility electricity plants represents about 2% of national coal-fired 
electricity generation capacity.  For purpose of rough estimation – in so far that electricity plant capacity 
correlates to annual CCR generation and thus to annual CCR disposal costs and to regulatory costs --- this 
percentage indicates that the additional economic impact of including these additional 139 non-utility plants in 
the proposed rule might add at least 2% to the cost estimates under each regulatory option. 
On the other hand, some CCR disposal costs and regulatory costs better correlate to the count and size (footprint) 
of CCR landfills and impoundments, not to electricity generating capacity.  For such costs, adding the 139 non-
utility plants to the scope of the proposed rule could increase the cost estimates for each regulatory option by up 
to 28% (i.e., (495 + 139) / (495)).

Source #2: 

EPA’s 2002 analysis24 of the results from a 2001 survey of non-utility CCR generation identified 759 non-utility facilities “with 
the capacity to burn coal, and therefore, generate CCR.”  The estimated annual CCR generation for these facilities is 7.8 million 
tons (as of year 2000), which is 5.5% to 6.3% of the 123.1 million to 141.2 million tons CCR generated by electric utility plants 
in 2005 as estimated in Exhibit 3D of this RIA.  Allowing for annual growth of the 7.8 million tons since 2000 suggests that 
adding these 759 facilities to the scope of the proposed rule could increase the cost estimates by 7%.

2C.  RCRA Regulatory Options Evaluated in this RIA 
 
This RIA evaluates three RCRA regulatory options which are defined with reference to the two alternative regulatory authorities --- Subtitle C 
and Subtitle D --- contained in EPA’s 1976 RCRA waste management statutory authority: 
 

Option 1: 

RCRA Subtitle C “special waste”: 

•  Regulate CCR disposed in landfills and surface impoundments as “special wastes” under Subtitle C, and require 

phase out of surface impoundments within five years.  This approach: 

•  Eliminates health risks from groundwater and surface water contamination for both landfills and surface 
impoundments, and avoids damages from uncontrolled ground “fill” operations (e.g., Gambrills MD and 
Chesapeake VA) and attendant environmental remediation costs. 

•  Eliminates the future threat of catastrophic failures of surface impoundments. 
•  Provides for corrective action, including at closed units at facilities with surface impoundments or landfills 

regulated under the rule, and imposes groundwater monitoring requirements. 

•  Provides for Federal oversight, which EPA experience has shown is necessary for successful implementation of 

RCRA industrial waste regulations, especially as it relates to ground-water monitoring and corrective action, 
when needed.  Without Federal oversight, it is highly questionable whether CCR will be properly managed, 
considering EPA’s experience with the RCRA program of the last 10 years, which illustrate the limited results 
that could be expected of a Subtitle D rule. 

 
Option 2: 

RCRA Subtitle D “non-hazardous” industrial waste (version 2): 

•  Liners required for all (i.e., existing and future new) CCR surface impoundments but only for new landfills.  
Subtitle D requirements would set national criteria for landfills and surface impoundments that manage CCR 
after the rule goes into effect.  For any CCR landfills and impoundments that closed before the effective date, 
there would be no regulatory controls over those units, unless the states choose to adopt controls over such units.  
Also, all surface impoundments (existing and new) would need to have composite liners within 5-years of the 
effective date.  Consistent with the Subtitle C approach, existing landfills would not need to be lined. 

•  Requirements would not be enforceable by EPA or the states (unless states had similar requirements under state 

law).  Lack of enforcement and Federal oversight may significantly reduce compliance and effective 
implementation of regulatory requirements. 

•  Although this option does not require phase-out of existing surface impoundments, it could cause some phase-out 

because all surface impoundments would need to have composite liners by a certain date, or they would need to 
close down, assuming the rule is effectively implemented by the states. 

•  Eliminates some ground-water contamination over the current situation (e.g., because of surface impoundment 

retrofitting), thus avoiding some damage cases, again assuming effective implementation. 

 

24 

 
Option 3: 

•  Require review of surface impoundments for stability by independent experts, but because impoundments could 

remain in operation (because they are currently lined or owners choose to retrofit line them rather than phase 
them out), there would still be a risk of future structural failures of impoundments. 

RCRA Subtitle “D prime”: 
•  Regulation of disposal under subtitle D, with liners required only for new surface impoundments and landfills.  This 
approach would be the same as the subtitle D approach above, except that existing surface impoundments would not 
be required to retrofit and install a composite liner, or close.  Unlined existing impoundments could continue to 
operate, but new landfills and surface impoundments or expansions of existing landfills must have composite liners. 
•  Under this approach the potential for catastrophic failure of surface impoundments would remain significant, since 

phase-out of surface impoundments wouldn’t occur. 

•  Would be less effective than the subtitle C or subtitle D approaches in eliminating groundwater contamination (or in 
having it be discovered sooner), but would still provide some benefits over no national regulation.  (The same caveats 
on state regulations and enforcement would apply as in the subtitle D option.) 

•  Would reduce regulatory costs significantly since conversion to dry disposal would not be required, but would also 

provide fewer benefits. 

 
Evaluation of three regulatory options is consistent with OMB’s 2003 “Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis” best practices guidance for Federal 
agencies, which requires analysis of at least three regulatory options.25  All three regulatory options are identical in two ways: 
 

1.  Beneficial use: All options propose to replace the 1980 RCRA “Bevill exclusion” under 40 CFR 261.4(b)(4) for CCR disposal with new 

RCRA waste regulation, but to retain the existing Bevill exclusion for CCR beneficial uses.  Beneficial uses of CCR will retain the 
Bevill exclusion and will not be subject to any regulation, either under Subtitle C or Subtitle D. 

 
2.  Engineering controls: All options propose the same set of 10 custom-tailored engineering controls (i.e., technical design and 
operating standards) for CCR disposal units.  For purpose of launching this RIA in April 2009, the waste disposal “management 
standards” described in EPA’s August 1999 cement kiln dust (CKD) proposed rule26 were used in absence of uniquely defined controls 
specific to CCR disposal units.  This was a reasonable starting point because the CKD management standards are similar or identical to 
the technical standards defined in the CCR proposed rule. 

                                                 
25 OMB’s 2003 Circular A-4 (p.16) directs Federal agencies to analyze at least three regulatory options: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/omb/circulars/a004/a-4.pdf 
26 EPA’s 20 August 1999 CKD proposed rule (Federal Register, 67 pages). 
 

25 

During EPA’s April 2009 launch of this RIA, EPA defined three other RCRA options which are very similar to the above three options.  The 
initial set of options is included in EPA’s October, 8 2009 initial draft (165 pages) of this RIA which EPA submitted to OMB for review in 
mid-October 2009.  The regulatory cost estimation in Chapter 4 and the supplemental analyses in Chapter 7 of this RIA are based on the 
initial set of three options, defined as follows: 
 

2009 Option 1:  RCRA Subtitle C “hazardous” industrial waste: 

•  Subtitle C provides Federal enforceability. 
•  RCRA Section 3004(x)27custom-tailor engineering controls (i.e., technical standards) for CCR disposal units. 
•  Subject CCR to Subtitle C land disposal restriction (LDR) treatment standards prior to disposal: 

•  Dry CCR (landfills): Moisture conditioning and compaction to attain 95% dry density value. 
•  Wet CCR (impoundments): Dewatering and dry disposal within 5 years after rule’s effective date. 

 

 

2009 Option 2:  RCRA Subtitle D “non-hazardous” industrial waste (version 1): 

•  This option is different from the 2010 Option 2: Subtitle D option because it does not require liners for existing 
impoundments as the 2010 Option 2 does, but it only requires liners for new impoundments (and only for new 
landfills). 

•  Regulate CCR disposal as RCRA Subtitle D non-hazardous waste based on the same custom-tailored engineering 

controls as the 2009 Option 1. 

•  Except under RCRA Section 7003 “imminent and substantial endangerment” authority, this option is not Federally 
enforceable because RCRA Subtitle D directs EPA only to assist state government waste management programs.28 

2009 Option 3:  Hybrid RCRA Subtitle C & Subtitle D: 

•  Subtitle C regulation of CCR impoundments (same as the 2009 Option 1) 
•  Subtitle D regulation of CCR landfills (same as the 2009 Option 2) 

                                                 
27 The following excerpt from RCRA Section 3004(x) pertains specifically to CCR, by providing EPA with authority “to modify” the RCRA Subtitle C technical standards 
for regulation of CCR disposal: 

“Section 3004(x):  If…  (2) fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, and flue gas emission control waste generated primarily from the combustion of coal or 
other fossil fuels…  is subject to regulation under this subtitle, the [EPA] Administrator is authorized to modify the requirements of subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), 
(o) and (u) and section 3005(j), in the case of landfills or surface impoundments receiving such solid waste, to take into account the special characteristics of such 
wastes, the practical difficulties associated with implementation of such requirements, and site-specific characteristics, including but not limited to the climate, 
geology, hydrology and soil chemistry at the site, so long as such modified requirements assure protection of human health and the environment.” 

28 Section 4001 of Subtitle D of the 1976 RCRA statute prescribes the Federal role under Subtitle D as assistance to state governments:  “The objectives of this subtitle are 
to assist in developing and encouraging methods for the disposal of solid waste…  Such objectives are to be accomplished through Federal technical and financial 
assistance to States or regional authorities for comprehensive planning pursuant to Federal guidelines designed to foster cooperation among Federal, State and local 
governments and private industry.”

Chapter 3 

Baseline CCR Management in the Electric Utility Industry 

 
 
This Chapter characterizes baseline (i.e., current) CCR management practices within the electric utility industry.  This baseline consists of two 
components described in this Chapter: CCR disposal and CCR beneficial use.  This Chapter begins with a description of baseline CCR 
management quantities (i.e., annual tonnages of CCR) and CCR disposal methods used by the electric utility industry.  This Chapter also 
presents an evaluation of baseline operating conditions (i.e., “engineering controls” and “ancillary costs”) of CCR disposal units and an 
estimate of the associated costs to the electric utility industry.  This Chapter concludes with a characterization of baseline CCR “beneficial use” 
(for CCR which is not disposed) and an estimate of associated net benefits to the environment and the national economy. 
 
 
3A. 
 
This RIA initially identified the sub-group of potentially affected coal-fired electric utility plants using the 2007 US Department of Energy 
(DOE), Energy Information Agency (EIA) database for electricity power plants from the Form EIA-860 "Annual Electric Generator Report.”  
This data was supplemented with the master list of utility plants from the 2007 EIA-860 database entitled “existingunits2007”. 29  This RIA 
applied three database filters to identify the subset of electricity plants which may potentially be affected by the proposed rule: 
 

Identity of Coal-Fired Electric Utility Plants 

 

•  Database filter #1 of 3: EPA sorted the 2007 EIA-860 electric plant database by the North American Industry Classification 

System (NAICS) industrial codes, and deleted all plants not assigned utility sector NAICS code 22 (only 2-digit NAICS 
codes are provided by the EIA database). 

NAICS 22: 

The Utilities sector comprises establishments engaged in the provision of the following utility services: 
electric power, natural gas, steam supply, water supply, and sewage removal. Within this sector, the specific 
activities associated with the utility services provided vary by utility: electric power includes generation, 
transmission, and distribution; natural gas includes distribution; steam supply includes provision and/or 
distribution; water supply includes treatment and distribution; and sewage removal includes collection, 
treatment, and disposal of waste through sewer systems and sewage treatment facilities. Excluded from this 
sector are establishments primarily engaged in waste management services classified in Subsector 562 Waste 
Management and Remediation Services. These establishments also collect, treat, and dispose of waste 

                                                 
29 The EIA-860 database is itemized on an electricity generator unit basis, not on a per-plant basis.  It includes specific information about generators at electric power plants 
owned and operated by electric utilities and non-utility industries (i.e., including independent power producers, combined heat and power producers, and other industrials). 
The file contains generator-specific information such as initial date of commercial operation, prime movers, generating capacity, energy sources, status of existing and 
proposed generators, proposed changes to existing generators, county and State location (including power plant address), ownership, and FERC qualifying facility status. 
Also included are data related to the ability to use multiple fuels; specifically, data on co-firing and fuel switching are included.   The DOE spreadsheet “existingunits2007” 
is available at http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/capacity/capacity.html.

•  Database filter #2 of 3: EPA deleted all of the units that did not use coal as either a primary or secondary energy source 
using the coal type codes displayed in Exhibit 3A below.  In addition to these five categories of coal, examples of other 
primary or secondary energy sources reported by coal burning electric utility plants are agriculture byproducts, distillate fuel 
oil, natural gas, petroleum coke, propane, and wood & waste solids.

•  Database filter #3 of 3: The first two filter criteria resulted in a subset of 506 coal-fired electric utility plants.  Based on the 

reported operating status of the generators at these plants (i.e., OP, OS, SB, RE, OA)30, 11 plants reported that all generators are 
out-of-service, 2 plants reported that all generators are on standby and all remaining plants reported that at least one of their 
generators is operating.  Removal of the 11 out-of-service plants from the master list resulted in a total affected plant population of 
495 coal-fired electric utility plants.31  Appendix C presents the list of 495 plants.32 

 
For purpose of identifying the types and size classifications for owner entities, this RIA initially used the utility code reported in the 2007 EIA-
860 database to identify which plants are owned by the same company.  Company owner classifications were also checked for many plants 
using internet searches by plant and company name which sometimes revealed parent company owners.  As summarized in Exhibit 3B and 
                                                 
30   OP = Operating - in service (commercial operation) and producing electricity.  Includes peaking units that are run on an as needed (intermittent or seasonal) basis, OS = 
Out of service – was not used for some or all of the reporting period and is NOT expected to be returned to service in the next calendar year, SB = Standby/Backup - 
available for service but not normally used (has little or no generation during the year) for this reporting period, RE = Retired - no longer in service and not expected to be 
returned to service, and OA = Out of service – was not used for some or all of the reporting period but was either returned to service on Dec 31 or will be returned to service 
in the next calendar year. Note: Units undergoing maintenance or repair of less than 12 months and are expected to be returned to service are assigned operating status. 
31 This RIA filtered out 11 out-of-service electricity plant identification codes: 508, 511, 996, 1732, 2341, 2468, 2529, 2531, 2908, 3419, and 55612. 
32 In comparison, a 2008 EPA Office of Water (OW) study estimated a nationwide total of 497 coal-fired electric plants using the same 2005 EIA-767 database; the 495 
plants estimated in this RIA are less than the 2008 EPA OW estimate because this RIA takes account of more recent plant operating status information (i.e., plants which 
have converted to other non-coal fuels or are not operating).  Source: Table 3-1 (page 3-9) of EPA Office of Waster “Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source 
Category: 2007/2008 Detailed Study Report,” report nr. 821-R-08-011, August 2008; http://www.epa.gov/guide/304m/2008/steam-detailed-200809.pdf

Exhibit 3C below, these 495 coal-fired electric utility plants are owned and operated by 200 entities which are listed in Appendix D to this 
RIA.  The 495 plants have a combined electricity generation nameplate capacity of 369,183 MW (megawatts), ranging in individual plant size 
from 2.3 MW to 3,969 MW, with an average size of 746 MW and a median size of 497 MW.  This combined capacity represents 34% of the 
1.088 million MW total US electricity generation capacity as of 2007.33

** Size class determined according to the following numerical threshold criteria consistent with EPA’s Nov 2006 guidance for Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) compliance: 

•  Small non-government = Based on the US Small Business Administration NAICS code 221112 small business size standard of <4 

million megawatt hours per year total annual electricity generation by all plants owned by the entity). 

•  Non-small non-government = entity’s total annual electricity generation >4 million megawatt hours per year. 
•  Small government = Based on the RFA’s definition (5 US Code section 601(5)) of “small government jurisdiction” as the 

government of a city, county, town, township, village, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000. 

•  Non-small government = entity’s jurisdiction population >50,000 people.

Many plants use more than one coal fuel type so the above percentages exceed 100%.  Appendices B & C present the quantity of coal burned 
and the types of coal burned for the list of 495 plants.  As displayed in the state-by-state Exhibit 3D below, 47 states have coal-fired electric 
utility plants (3 states --- ID, RI, VT --- and DC do not have electric utility plants).  The top-5 state coal-fired electric utility plant counts are: 

1.  PA   
2.  IN & OH

3B.  Types of CCR Disposal Units 
 

•  Estimated Plant Counts by Type of CCR Disposal Unit 

 
The scope of CCR disposal units covered by this RIA is active units (i.e., operational units which were receiving CCR as of year 2005).  
Inactive or abandoned units (i.e., non-operating units) are excluded from the scope of this RIA.  The data source used to identify baseline CCR 
management practices and active units is the 2005 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA-767 
“Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Report” database.34  The EIA-767 database is the primary data source for reporting annual CCR 
disposition for plants generating greater than 100 MW (megawatts) of electricity.  Plants smaller than 100 MW are not required to report CCR 
tonnage and disposition (i.e., type of disposal and beneficial use) data to the EIA-767 database.  Schedule 3 of the EIA-767 database contains 
the annual disposition of CCR in one or more of the following five forms of CCR management categories, according to annual tons disposed 
for each plant.  EIA-767 does not contain counts of CCR disposal units for each plant: 

 

 

1.  Company-owned landfill 
2.  Company-owned disposal ponds (i.e., surface impoundments) 
3.  Onsite use and storage (this RIA assumes all of this quantity eventually goes to beneficial use, not disposal) 
4.  Sold (for beneficial use) 
5.  Disposed off site 

 
The 2005 EIA-767 database contained annual CCR disposal data for 363 of the 495 plants identified in the 2007 EIA-860 database.  The 363 
plants are over 100 MW in size and thus are covered by the EIA-767 database.  For the 132 plants which did not report CCR disposal practices 
in the 2005 EIA-767 database because they are less than 100 MW in size, disposal of CCR is assumed to take place in on-site or off-site 
landfills (whichever is the lowest-cost method as assigned by the CCR disposal engineering control cost model used for this RIA).   For each of 
the 495 coal-fired utility plants identified in the prior section of this RIA using the 2007 EIA-860 database, baseline CCR disposal practices 
were assigned using the methodology and data sources presented below.  Based on this analysis, 467 of the 495 plants dispose CCR using the 
following methods.  The 28 remainder of the 495 plants do not dispose because they solely supply their CCR for beneficial uses.  A total of 272 
of the 495 plants supply CCR for beneficial uses.  The total count of disposal methods exceeds the 467 total count of disposing plants because 
some plants use more than one disposal method.  The EIA-767 database does not contain counts of disposal units for each plant so only plant 
counts are summarized below according to disposal method, not CCR disposal unit counts.  Because some plants use more than one disposal 
unit, the total count of CCR disposal units – although unknown for purpose of this RIA -- exceeds the 467 total count of disposing plants. 

                                                 
34 Source: The EIA-767 database includes annual data from organic-fueled or combustible renewable steam-electric plants with a generator nameplate rating of 10 or more 
megawatts (MW) regardless of current ownership and/or operation.   However, it contains annual tonnage CCR generation, CCR disposal, and CCR beneficial use data only 
for plants over 100MW in size.  The EIA terminated the EIA-767 database after year 2005.  Beginning with calendar year 2007 data, two other surveys, the Form EIA-860 
and the Form EIA-923, will collect most of the data formerly collected by Form EIA-767.  No data will be collected for 2006.  The following weblink provides a crosswalk 
of the data elements previously collected on the Form EIA-767 for 2005 with the corresponding data elements to be collected beginning with calendar year 2007 on the 
Form EIA-860 or the Form EIA-923: http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/2008forms/consolidate.html

•  Onsite landfills: 

311 plants operate onsite CCR landfills (this RIA refers to these as “onsite” landfills although some may be 
located off plant property).  This estimate consists of two sources (i.e., 212 plants + 99 plants): 

(cid:131)  212 plants: dentified through actual data reporting of 363 coal-fired electric plants in size >100 MW 

contained in the 2005 EIA-767 database, out of the total 495 plants identified using the 2007 EIA-
860 database (as described in the previous section above). 

(cid:131)  99 plants:  This estimate is based on the remainder 132 electric utility plants (i.e., 495 minus 363 

plants = 132 plants) between 1 MW and 100 MW size for which there is no CCR disposal data in the 
EIA-767 database, and for which the CCR disposal engineering control cost model used in this RIA 
assigned the lowest-cost of three landfill options: (1) onsite dug landfill, (2) onsite pile landfill, or 
(3) offsite landfill.  The cost model assignment was dependent upon the level of baseline engineering 
controls assumed required by each plant’s state location and annual CCR disposal tonnage.  The cost 
model estimated that 99 of the 132 plants without data dispose CCR in onsite landfills. 

•  Onsite impoundments: 

158 plants operate onsite CCR surface impoundments (aka “ponds,” “embankments,” “dams,” “dikes,” “wet 
dumps,” “constructed wetlands”).  This RIA assumes that all impoundments are “onsite” although some may 
be located off plant property. 

The non-duplicative count of plants using onsite landfills and/or onsite impoundments is 383 plants. 

•  Offsite disposal: 

149 plants assigned as sending CCR offsite for disposal to commercial landfills (of which 84 plants solely 
ship CCR for offsite disposal).  Off-site landfills receiving CCR are assumed to already be in compliance 
with EPA’s RCRA Subtitle D guidance.  The 149 plants assigned as using offsite landfills consist of the 
following assignments according to data sources (i.e., 116 plants + 33 plants): 

(cid:131)  116 plants: Electric utility plants >100 MW size (source: 2005 EIA-767 database):  Final disposition 

of wastes is reported as either (a) company-owned landfill, (b) company-owned disposal pond, (c) 
on-site use & storage, (d) sold, or (e) off-site disposal.  This RIA assumes that off-site disposal 
means offsite commercial landfill.  Plants could have reported offsite minefill in this category if it 
was not "sold" (e.g., they paid to dispose it in a mine or it was used as minefill and no payment was 
made to the electric utility).  However, it is unknown the sub-quantity of “offsite disposal” which 
includes plants reporting tonnages for non-sold uses as offsite minefill.35 

 

 

 

                                                 
35 In July 2009, ORCR contacted the DOE-EIA Form 767 questionnaire contact person (Natalie Ko, Electric Power Division) to clarify this RIA’s assignment of all “offsite 
disposal” tonnages as commercial landfills.  The DOE-EIA contact person responded with additional information from four 2005 Form EIA-767 questionnaires regarding 
how electricity plant respondents optionally characterized the fly ash and bottom ash reported in the Form EIA-767 survey questionnaire as “Off Site Disposal” : 
·  “This quantity of fly ash was given away at no cost” 
·  “The fly ash was sent off site for beneficial use” 
·  “The fly ash is injected into the nearby mines for recharging the mines” 
·   “Ash is recycled as a beneficial re-use product for flowable fill in the construction industry” 
 

34 

•  92 plants Offsite landfill fly ash 
•  76 plants Offsite landfill bottom ash 
•  4 plants  Offsite landfill gypsum 
•  16 plants Offsite landfill FGD 
•  7 plants  Offsite landfill other CCR (i.e., coal combustion by-products) 
•  Sub-total = 116 plants (non-duplicative count) 

(cid:131)  33 plants: This estimate is based on the 132 electric utility plants between 1 MW and 100 MW size 
for which there is no CCR disposal data in the EIA-767 database, and for which the CCR disposal 
engineering control cost model used in this RIA assigned the lowest-cost of three landfill options: 
(1) onsite dug landfill, (2) onsite pile landfill, or (3) offsite landfill.  The cost model assignment was 
dependent upon the level of baseline engineering controls assumed required by each plant’s state 
location and annual CCR disposal tonnage. 

•  Estimated Counts of CCR Disposal Units 

 
The methodology of this RIA does not estimate or use secondary information about the actual count of CCR disposal units (i.e., landfill units 
and impoundment units) used by these 467 onsite or offsite disposing plants.  However, there are two sources of CCR disposal unit counts: 
 

•  Source #1 of 2: ASTSWMO:  The February-March 2009 ASTSWMO voluntary participation survey36 of 42 states (which is incomplete 

coverage of the 47 states identified in this RIA for the 495 coal-fired electric plants) estimates a total of 484 electric utility plant CCR 
disposal units: 

•  227 electric utility plant CCR landfill units in 41 states 
•  257 electric utility plant CCR impoundment units in 33 states 
•  Total electric utility plant CCR disposal units = 484 (i.e., 227 landfills + 257 impoundments) 

 
 

 

 

 
But it is not clear whether the ASTSWMO CCR disposal unit counts (a) are restricted in the ASTSWMO survey to electric utility plants in 
NAICS code 221112, (b) may also include counts of CCR disposal units associated with other industries which generate coal-fired electricity 
in the surveyed states, (c) may include inactive/abandoned as well as active CCR disposal units, or (d) may include landfills or impoundments 
operated by electric utility plants which contain other types of waste streams (e.g. waste water treatment ponds without co-mingled CCR). 

Source #2 of 2: EPA:  In March 2009 EPA sent letters37 to 210 coal-fired electric plant facilities and owner companies in order to identify the 
location of CCR impoundments and evaluate their structural integrity in the wake of the December 2008 CCR impoundment collapse and

flooding at the TVA Kingston TN electricity plant.  Although not used in this RIA other than for reference here, the responses received to the 
March 2009 EPA letters resulted in identification of 584 CCR impoundments units at electric utility plants.  The letters did not collect 
information about CCR landfills38 

As of 2008, coal-fired utilities burn approximately 1.036 billion tons of coal per year using a variety of conventional combustion technologies. 
NAICS 22 electric utility coal combustion results in the generation of five types of CCR: 
 

 
 
3C. 
 

  Types of CCR and Annual Quantities 

1.  Fly ash 
2.  Bottom ash 
3.  Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) sludge 
4.  Gypsum 
5.  Other residues (including boiler slag) 

 
These wastes may be (a) disposed in onsite landfills and surface impoundments (i.e., ponds, dams, embankments, lagoons), or (b) may be 
applied to beneficial uses, or (c) disposed offsite.  At the time of preparing this RIA in 2009, waste generation and disposition data from 
Schedule 8, Part A of the 2007 DOE EIA database for the Form EIA-932 “Power Plant Operations Report” database had yet to be finalized.  
Instead, the most currently available waste data was from the 2005 DOE EIA Form 767 “Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Report” 
database.  Therefore, the 2005 EIA-767 database is the primary source used in this RIA to quantify CCR generation and identify the ultimate 
disposition of CCR (i.e., type of disposal or beneficial use).  CCR generation and final disposition are reported under the above five CCR type 
categories in the 2005 EIA 767 database.  As estimated in this RIA and displayed below in Exhibit 3E, the 495 electric utility plants generated 
141.2 million tons per year of CCR (2005/2007 mixed data). 
 

Interpretive Note:  This RIA’s CCR generation estimate of 141.2 million tons is 15% and 8% higher, respectively, than the 

123.1 million tons (2005) and the 131.1 million tons (2007) annual CCR generation estimates published by 
the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA).39  The numerical discrepancy between this RIA’s estimate and 
the ACAA estimates may be explained by the fact that both estimates (i.e., this RIA and the ACAA) are 
based on incomplete CCR tonnage disposition data for less than the “universe” of all known operating

39 As of the date of this RIA, ACAA’s “Coal Combustion Products Production & Use Statistics” website contains annual CCR generation and annual CCR beneficial use 
tonnage estimates for the US electric utility industry for years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008.  As reported in footnotes on ACAA’s annual survey 
results data tables, ACAA’s CCR generation and CCR beneficial use annual tonnage estimates are based on the following survey coverages: 2001 coverage not indicated on 
data table; 2002 2/3rd coal burn; 2003 60% coal burn; 2004 60% coal burn; 2005 54% coal burn; 2006 57% coal burn reported by 58 electric utilities; 2007 161 plants; and 
2008 274 plants.  ACAA’s annual CCR tonnage data webpage is at http://acaa.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=3 
 

36 

electric utility plants in the data year, extrapolated to plants for which there is no CCR tonnage data in the 
EIA database (in the case of this RIA’s estimation methodology) and in the case of the ACAA estimates, 
extrapolated to plants not covered by ACAA’s annual utility industry survey by supplementing with EIA 
data. 

The estimate of CCR generation developed in this RIA consists of the following breakout of generation estimates according to two electric 
utility plant size categories, which correspond to the CCR tonnage disposition data reporting cut-off requirement in the EIA-767 database: 

•  >100 MW plants:  Exhibit 3E below presents CCR disposition data for a sub-total of 120.9 million tons CCR generated per year as 

 

 

 

reported by plants with annual electricity generation >100 MW from Schedule 3A of the 2005 EIA-767 database for 
each plant. 
•  Ash generation data (fly ash and bottom ash) were available for 385 plants. 
•  FGD sludge generation data were available for 72 plants. 
•  Gypsum generation data were available for 31 plants. 
•  Other byproduct generation data were available for 40 plants. 
If plants > 100 MW reported either company landfill, company disposal ponds, sold for beneficial use, or off-site 
disposal of CCR in the EIA-767 database, these final disposition practices are assumed in this RIA for the baseline.  A 
total 179 plants with company-owned CCR landfills and 158 plants with company-owned CCR surface 
impoundments were reported in the 2005 EIA-767 database (i.e., 337 of the 495 electric plants).40  112 of the 495 
plants reported 8.2 million “on-site use and storage” which this RIA assigned as beneficial use not as disposal.  This 
assumption is supported by (a) DOE’s August 2006 report41 “Coal Combustion Waste Management at Landfills and 
Surface Impoundments 1994-2004” which interpreted the entire "onsite use & storage" quantity as beneficial use, and 
(b) the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) which indicates that 49.6 million tons of coal ash were beneficially 
used in 200542.  However, the beneficial use estimate in Exhibit 3E below is much less at 38.8 million tons which is 
based on the EIA-767 “Sold” (i.e., beneficial use) CCR tonnage category.  But adding the 8.2 million tons reported as 
"onsite use & storage" yields an estimate of 47.0 million tons (Exhibit 3G), which nearly matches the ACAA 
beneficial use estimate of 49.6 million tons.  This suggests it is valid to assign the tonnage reported in the EIA-767 
database as "onsite use & storage" to beneficial use rather than to disposal. 

                                                 
40 In the 2005 DPRA Report, an additional step was included after step 1 that identified additional disposal practices using landfill and surface impoundment as reported in 
the 1995 EPRI Comanagement Survey.  This data source was not used to identify CCR management units in this RIA given it dates back to 1995.  The data source is only 
used to identify existing engineering controls for the units identified in the 2005 EIA 767 database.  In the 2005 DPRA Report, 14 additional landfills and 10 surface 
impoundments were identified using this information source.

•  1MW  to 100 MW  Exhibit 3F below presents an additional sub-total of 20.3 million tons per year of CCR generated by 132 electric 
utility plants between 1 MW and 100 MW in capacity which had no CCR management information in the EIA767 
database, because plants less than 100 MW are not required to report their CCR management annual tonnages in the 
EIA-767 database.  Therefore, this RIA formulated an estimate for this size category of plants based on the 
following approach.  Coal use and percent ash content data from Schedule 4A of the 2005 EIA-767 database were 
used to estimate ash generation quantities for 102 plants within this smaller size category.  For 5 plants for which 
EIA-767 coal use data were unavailable for 2005, coal use data from Schedule 4A of the 2007 EIA-923 database 
were used to estimate CCR generation quantities for those 5 plants.  FGD sludge generation data obtained from 
Schedule 843 of the 2005 EIA-767 database were used for 115 plants.  Landfill (either on-site or off-site whichever 
is more economical) is the assumed CCR disposal practice.  No gypsum or other byproduct generation quantities 
were estimated.  For plants between 1 MW and 10 MW, ash generation quantities estimated using generator 
nameplate capacity rating data from the 2007 DOE Form 860 database.  This 1 MW to 100 MW subtotal of 132 
plants consists of two sub-categories: 

 

•  10 MW to 100 MW:  5.4 million tons of CCR for 110 plants estimated by multiplying the quantity of coal they 
burned by the percent CCR content of the coal data from Schedule 4A of the 2005 EIA-767 database and 2007 
DOE EIA 923 database, or using generator nameplate rating data from the 2007 EIA-860 database and an 
average percent ash content. 

•  1 MW to 10 MW:  14.9 million tons of FGD sludge reported for 22 plants in Schedule 8 of the 2005 EIA-767 

database that did not report any FGD sludge in Schedule 3A of the 2005 EIA-767 database. 

                                                 
43  In general, data obtained from Schedule 8 of the 2005 EIA-767 database reflects information reported by plants between 10 MW and 100 MW.  However, if a plant 
greater than 100 MW reported no final disposition quantities for FGD sludge in Schedule 3A of the 2005 EIA-767 database, the reported FGD sludge quantity in Schedule 8 
is assumed in this RIA to be placed in a landfill for that plant.

3D.  Size of CCR Disposal Units 
 
The size of CCR disposal units ranges from modest to very large, with some impoundments covering 1,500 acres or more.  Sizing of the units 
is based on the annual tonnage of CCR placed in the unit.  CCR disposal unit size assumptions for this RIA are adopted from Section 4.4.1 of 
the 2005 DPRA Report: 
 

•  Landfills sizes: 

Designed as “combination fill landfills” 

Designed as “pile fill landfills” 

(cid:131)  3.8 million cubic  yards capacity 
(cid:131)  50% of the capacity excavated below grade 
(cid:131)  40-year capacity (i.e., operating lifespan)44 
(cid:131)  Per-unit surface area size ranges from 12 acres for 10,000 tons per year to over 2,000 acres for 2,000,000 tons per year. 

(cid:131)  3.4 million cubic yards capacity 
(cid:131)  5% of the capacity excavated below grade 
(cid:131)  40-year capacity (i.e., operating lifespan) 
(cid:131)  Per-unit surface area ranges from 16 acres for 10,000 tons per year to over 3,000 acres for 2,000,000 tons per year. 

 

•  Surface impoundment sizes:

o  40-year capacity 
o  Per-unit surface area ranges from 30 acres for 10,000 tons per year, 140 acres for 50,000 tons per year, 500 acres for 200,000 tons per 

year, 1,400 acres for 500,000 tons per year, and 5,500 acres for 2,000,000 tons per year. 

                                                 
44 For the 30 Nov 2005 DPRA report (“Estimation of Costs for Regulating Fossil Fuel Combustion Ash Management at Large Electric Utilities Under Part 258”, docket 
document ID nr. EPA-HQ-RCRA-2006-0796-0469), the EPA asked utility industry representatives for the typical lifespan years of CCR landfills and impoundments.  
Industry representatives provided a 40-year estimate for both.  This estimate is supported by data provided by industry in the 1995 EPRI Comanagement Survey.  In the 
EPRI Survey, data describing six CCR landfills noted the year the unit was opened and the estimated date of closure.  The average life expectancy is 34 years and the 
median life expectancy is 38 years.  Similarly, data provided for 18 CCR impoundments indicate an average life expectancy of 45 years and a median life expectancy of 46 
years.  Therefore, this RIA assumes a 40-year lifespan for both landfills and impoundments.

3E.   Cost of Baseline CCR Disposal 
 
This Chapter presents characterizing data and estimates of the costs to the electric utility industry and to government, for baseline (i.e., current) 
industry  engineering  controls  and  other  costs  associated  with  CCR  disposal.    OMB’s  2003  Circular  A-4  “Regulatory  Analysis”  (page  15) 
requires RIAs to measure the benefits and costs of regulations against a baseline defined as: 
 

Baseline = “[T]he best assessment of the way the world would look absent the proposed rule.” 

 
The baseline developed here uses the most recent data year available and relies solely on publicly available data used in prior studies and 
reports, updated using empirically-justifiable factors.  For purpose of this RIA, the possible types of baseline costs include: 
 

A. Baseline “engineering control “costs for CCR disposal units: 

1.  Ground water monitoring 
2.  Bottom liners 
3.  Leachate collection system 
4.  Dust controls – applicable to landfills only 
5.  Rain and surface water run-on/run-off controls – applicable to landfills only 
6.  Financial assurance for disposal unit closure and post-closure 
7.  Disposal unit location restrictions (6 types: water tables, floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic zones, karst terrain) 
8.  Closure capping to cover unit 
9.  Post-closure monitoring requirements 
10. Storage design and operating standards (tanks, containers, containment buildings) – not evaluated in this RIA 

 
B. Baseline “ancillary costs” directly related to CCR disposal: 

11. Offsite disposal 
12. Structural integrity inspections – impoundments only 
13. RCRA facility-wide investigation (RFI) 
14. Corrective action 
15. Waste disposal permits 
16. Inspection & enforcement 
17. Remediation of environmental releases 

 
 

•  Characterization of Industry Baseline CCR Disposal 

 
For each of the 467 operating electric utility plants which currently (2007) dispose CCR onsite or offsite (28 of the 495 total plants solely send 
their CCR for beneficial uses not disposal), this RIA estimated baseline engineering controls at disposal units and associated baseline disposal 
 

42 

costs for each type of disposal (note: the sum of plant counts for each disposal category below exceeds 467 because some plants use more than 
one type of CCR disposal method): 
 

o  311 plants with active onsite CCR landfills 
o  158 plants with active onsite CCR surface impoundments 
o  149 plants which offsite dispose (assumed all involve offsite landfills) 

 
For this RIA, the “baseline” is defined as existing conditions plus projection of future conditions over the 50-year future period-of-analysis 
2012 to 2061 applied in this RIA (this RIA assumes year 2012 represents the first year when the final rule could take effect, if promulgated). 
Baseline engineering controls were estimated using the following 2-step method which is based on two alternative and complementary sources 
of information: 
 

•  Step 1: 

If the plant reported controls in the 1995 EPRI Comanagement Survey, 1996 CIBO Survey, or the 1994-2004 DOE-EPA Study, 
the stricter of these controls or state-specified controls are assumed for the baseline.  These studies contained control data for 89 plants with 
CCR landfills and 50 plants with CCR impoundments (i.e., 139 of the 495 electric utility plants).  State regulations added additional 
controls at 69 of the 89 landfill plants and 43 of the 50 impoundment plants with plant specific information (e.g., the EPRI Survey data may 
have indicated that the unit had a liner only but state regulations required groundwater monitoring and capping so these additional controls 
were added). 

Controls specified under state regulations for 34 states are assumed for all other plants in those 34 states for the baseline if no 
1995 EPRI Comanagement Survey data, 1996 CIBO Survey data, or 1994-2004 DOE-EPA Study data are available for that plant.   This 
step resulted in assigning state-required controls to 201 plants with CCR landfills and 55 plants with CCR impoundments (i.e., 256 of the 
495 plants).  Overall state regulations were added to 270 plants with CCR landfills and 98 plants with CCR impoundments. 

•  Step 2: 

For the 100 plants (i.e., 47 plants with landfills and 53 plants with impoundments) for which there are no data from the three 

studies, and no state-regulatory data on controls from Step 1, no controls are assumed under baseline for on-site landfills and 
impoundments; this represents a worst case (i.e., high cost) assumption. 

 
The associated data sources and findings for each baseline characterization step are described below. 
 

•  Step 1: Baseline Installed CCR Disposal Engineering Controls Identified in Prior Industry Surveys (1995, 1996, 2004) 

 
The controls identified through the Step 1 prior studies were more stringent than the state government requirements discussed in Step 2 for:  
  
o  Landfills:  Voluntary controls for 25 plants with landfills (9% of 227 plants landfills) receiving 6.4 million tons per year (i.e., 

9% of total landfill CCR quantity) in 12 states (some are identified as voluntary because state regulations were not reviewed for 
the state): AR, AZ, CA, IA, IN, KS, MD, MN, NE, SD, SI, WV. 

 

43 

o  Impoundments:  Voluntary controls for 39 plants with impoundments (25% of 158 plants with impoundments) receiving 5.5 

million tons per year (i.e., 25% of total CCR impoundment quantity) in 14 states (some are identified as voluntary because state 
regulations were not reviewed for the state): AL, FL, IA, IL, IN, LA, MN, MS, NM, OH, SC, TX, UT, WY.  

•  Step 2: Baseline State Government CCR Disposal Engineering Control Requirements for Landfills & Impoundments (2008) 

 
Several states have already established certain CCR disposal unit design and operating requirements that are required to be implemented either 
upon the effective date of the regulation (e.g., groundwater monitoring), upon retirement of the disposal unit (e.g., post-closure monitoring), or 
for newly constructed units only.  Appendix E of this RIA provides a summary of the state government requirements for both landfills and 
impoundments.  Current CCR disposal regulations have been reviewed for the top 34 states that utilize coal for producing electricity for 
required engineering controls at landfills and impoundments.  The plants located in these states account for 99% of the annual quantity of CCR 
managed in company-owned (i.e., onsite) landfills and impoundments.  State regulations were reviewed for the following 34 states: AL, AZ, 
CO, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MD, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NV, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WV, 
WI, WY.  Below is a synopsis of the baseline state government requirements according to the engineering controls listed above. 
 
1. Groundwater monitoring requirements: 

 

 

•  Point-of Compliance:  

•  Number of Wells: 

Two options for point-of-compliance groundwater monitoring include installing monitoring wells at the unit boundary or within 150 
meters of the unit boundary.  Recent changes to state regulations suggest that states typically require unit boundary monitoring. 

Certain states specify a minimum number of monitoring wells: FL (3 wells for impoundments), IA (1 well for landfill), IL (multiple 
wells for landfills), KY (3 wells for landfills), LA (3 wells for impoundments and landfills), MO (4 wells for impoundments and 
landfills), ND (3 wells for impoundments), OK (3 wells for impoundments and 4 wells for landfills), TN (3 wells for landfills), UT (3 
wells for landfills), WV (3 wells for impoundments and 4 wells for landfills).  Well spacing design criteria for landfill boundary 
detection wells for FL, IA, and KS were reviewed.  FL requires a minimum of one down-gradient detection well every 500 feet placed 
within 50 feet of the unit.  Iowa requires a minimum of one detection well every 600 feet placed within 50 feet of the unit.  KS 
recommends a minimum of one-down-gradient detection well every 500 feet. 

•  Monitoring Parameters:  

Two options for sampling include testing for chemical indicators and testing for RCRA hazardous waste Appendix VIII constituents 
(i.e., 40 CFR 261 Appendix VIII).  Of the 34 state regulations reviewed, three states require chemical indicator monitoring for surface 
impoundments [CO, PA, WV] and 11 states require chemical indicator monitoring for landfills [IA, FL, KY, MI, OH, OK, PA, TN, UT, 
WI, WV].  Three states require RCRA Appendix VIII constituent monitoring for impoundments [MO, PA, WV], and 10 states require 
RCRA Appendix VIII constituent monitoring for landfills [GA, FL, IA, IL, MI, MO, OH, TN, UT, WV].   

•  Monitoring Frequency:  

Three options for groundwater sampling frequency include quarterly, semi-annual and annual.  Of the 34 state regulations reviewed, 
one state requires quarterly sampling for surface impoundments [CO (depending on the ground-water classification)] and three states 
require quarterly monitoring for landfills [IA (until baseline conditions are established), IL (first 5 years), MI]. Five states require semi-
44 

annual sampling for surface impoundments [LA, MO, ND, PA (chemical indicators), WV] and 12 states require semi-annual 
monitoring for landfills [FL, GA, KY, LA, MO, OH (chemical indicators), OK, PA (indicator parameters), TN (chemical indicators), 
UT, WV, WY].  Three states require annual sampling for surface impoundments [CO (depending on the ground-water classification), 
PA (metals and VOCs), WV] and five states require annual sampling for landfills [IA (after baseline established), IL (after 5 years), OH 
(metals, TOC, TDS, chloride, sodium and radionuclides), PA (metals and VOCs), TN (RCRA Appendix VIII constituents)]. 

• 

Timing of State Regulation Implementation: 

In the baseline, certain states require groundwater monitoring only for newly constructed units.  These baseline costs are tracked as 
future baseline cost streams in the cost model.  Of the 34 state regulations reviewed, nine states require immediate compliance with 
monitoring requirements for impoundments: LA, MN, MO, ND, NV, NY, OK, SC, UT.  Eight states that only require groundwater 
monitoring only at newly constructed surface impoundments: CO, FL, KY, MI, NC, PA, WI, WV.  21 states require immediate 
compliance with monitoring requirements for landfills: AL, CO, GA, IA, IN, KS, KY, MI, MN, MT, NC, ND, NY, OH, PA, SC, TN, 
UT, VA, WA, WY.   Ten states require groundwater monitoring only at newly constructed landfills: FL, IL, LA, MS, MO, NV, OK,

7. Disposal Unit Location Restrictions (6 categories) 

State regulations for the top-25 coal usage states (for electricity) were reviewed back in year 2000 for any location restrictions.  These 
regulations were not updated as part of this RIA.  The following is a synopsis of state government location restrictions on locating CCR 
surface impoundments and landfills, according to six categories of location restrictions (water table, floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, 
seismic zones, unstable karst terrain).

•  Industry Baseline CCR Disposal Characterization Findings 

 
Appendix F of this RIA presents on a plant-by-plant basis the baseline engineering controls assumed for each of the 383 of the 495 electric 
utility plants which onsite dispose CCR (84 plants solely dispose CCR offsite; this RIA assumes that all offsite CCR disposal units are landfills, 
and further assumes that all of those offsite landfills currently comply with the engineering controls described in this RIA for the regulatory 
options).  Exhibits 3I (for landfills) and Exhibit 3J (for impoundments) below summarize the assignment of baseline conditions in this RIA 
for these 411 plants which dispose CCR onsite.

•  Baseline CCR Disposal Cost Estimation 

 
This section presents baseline cost estimates for both onsite and offsite CCR disposal units (i.e., landfills and impoundments) for 467 of the 495 
electric utility plants which dispose CCR (CCR from the remainder 28 of the 495 plants is solely beneficially used). 
 

•  Cost Estimation Framework 

 

•  Cost calculations:  This RIA contains three types of cost estimates (with decreasing relative degrees of expected accuracy): 

o  Data-based estimates:  Based on a landfill and impoundment engineering controls cost estimation model using relatively 

robust and recent data inputs (e.g., 2005 or newer) pertaining to CCR quantities and disposal methods for individual 
electric utility plants.  The cost model was first developed by EPA in 1988 to support EPA’s 1991 final criteria for 
municipal solid waste RCRA Subtitle D landfills, and EPA’s 1999 proposed rule cement kiln dust landfill requirements.45  
The cost model consists of two software components; Appendix G to this RIA provides additional details about the 
model: 

(cid:131)  1st of 2 cost model components: Unit Cost Component: The first component is a Fortran computer programmed 

cost model which dates back to 1988.  This model specifies the various steps and physical units (e.g., square 
footage sizes and associated quantities of labor, equipment and materials for the specified sizes) involved in 
designing, constructing, operating, and closing a landfill or impoundment.  Then it combines the physical 
component data inputs, with input data on the prices/ costs/ fees for the physical components to estimate as model 
outputs, the capital and annual O&M costs of specified sizes of landfills and impoundments.  The unit prices/ 
costs/fees used as input data include a wide range of items, such as the per-acre cost of land, clearing, excavation, 
equipment, labor, bottom liner materials, and cover materials.  For this RIA, the model was run multiple times to 
generate individual cost estimates for a series of five alternatively-sized CCR landfills and impoundments with 
varying types of engineering controls to represent the range of sizes and engineering controls in the population of 
495 electric utility plants.  The size categories are defined in tons per day of CCR disposed.  Each CCR landfill or 

                                                 
45 The 1988 cost model is documented in the “User’s Manual for the Subtitle D Municipal Landfill Cost Model” draft report prepared for EPA’s Office of Solid Waste by 
DPRA Inc, Sept 1988, 129 pages which is available from the Federal docket as document ID nr EPA-HQ-RCRA-2006-0796.  

EPA previously publicly referenced this cost model in the following six publications:  (a) “Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis for Proposed Revisions to Subtitle D 
Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills,” prepared for US EPA Office of Solid Waste by Temple, Barker & Sloane, Inc., ICF Incorporated, Pope-Reid Associates (now 
DPRA Inc.) and American Management Systems, Inc., 05 Aug 1988 (this document includes about a 4-page summary of the cost model); (b) “Regulatory Impact Analysis 
for the Final Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills,” prepared for US EPA Office of Solid Waste by Temple, Barker & Sloane/Clayton Environmental Consultants, 
ICF Inc, DPRA Inc, and American Management Systems, Inc., Dec 1990 (this document includes about a 4-page summary of the cost model); (c) “Addendum to the 
Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Final Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills,” prepared for US EPA, Office of Solid Waste by Temple, Barker & Sloane/Clayton 
Environmental Consultants and ICF Inc, August 1991; (d) “40 CFR Parts 257 and 258 Solid Waste Disposal Facility Criteria: Proposed Rule,” Federal Register, Vol.53, 
No.168,  pp.33314-33422, 30 Aug 1988; (e) “Revised Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills,” Federal Register Volume 56, pp. 50978, 09 Oct 1991; (f) “Technical 
Background Document: Compliance Cost Estimated for the Proposed Land Management Regulation of Cement Kiln Dust,” prepared for the US EPA, Office of Solid 
Waste by DPRA Inc, 10 April 1998.; and (g) “40 CFR Parts 259, 261, 266, and 270 Standards for the Management of Cement Kiln Dust; Proposed Rule,” Federal Register 
Vol.64, No.161,  pp. 45632-45697, 20 Aug 1999.

impoundment is assumed to operate 300 days per year (average number of operating days for coal-fired boilers 
based on 2005 DOE EIA 767 database).  The size categories are 10,000, 50,000, 200,000, 500,000 and 2,000,000 
tons of CCR per year.  Size is the primary determinant of overall cost; however, landfills and impoundments 
exhibit increasing returns to scale: the larger the landfill or impoundment, the lower the cost per ton of CCR 
managed.  The cost equations generated by these unit cost model runs are used as inputs in the second component 
of the cost model to compute landfill and impoundment cost curves (equations) based on size for each combination 
of engineering controls, so that a unique cost estimate may be assigned to each of the 495 electric utility plants 
according to each plant’s unique annual CCR disposal tonnage. 

(cid:131)  2nd of 2 cost model components: Plant-by-Plant & Aggregate Cost Component:  The second component of the 

model is an Excel spreadsheet with Visual Basic programming used to estimate unique baseline (i.e., current) and 
regulatory option costs for each electric utility plant.  The spreadsheet is populated with plant-by-plant data 
including plant location, known disposal and beneficial reuse practices, known or estimated baseline engineering 
controls on CCR disposal units, annual CCR disposal tonnages, and known or estimated CCR landfill and 
impoundment future closure years.  The spreadsheet is also populated with the cost equations generated by the first 
component of the model for the various engineering controls (e.g., groundwater monitoring and safety inspections) 
and for off-site landfill disposal costs.  The Visual Basic programming is used for this RIA to estimate engineering 
control costs for both the (a) baseline and (b) regulatory options for each plant over a 50-year future period-of-
analysis (i.e., 2012 to 2061).  The plant-by-plant estimated costs are then aggregated in this second component of 
the model on an average annualized basis. 
o  Assumption-based estimates: These are based on relatively limited data, and/or older data (e.g., older than 2005), or meta-

analysis transfer of results from other studies, or data from case studies, or based mostly on professional judgment 
assumptions rather than data, for some of the major factors used in cost calculations. 

o  Scenario-based estimates: These are applied in absence of data, case studies, or assumptions for purpose of illustrating 
potential lower- and upper-bound costs (i.e., bounding estimates).  EPA defines “scenarios” as qualitative projections of 
possible future conditions based on variations in key drivers of change, including social, technological, economic and 
institutional drivers.  Scenario construction is a futures analysis method; as such, scenario-based estimates do not strive to 
predict the future with absolute certainty, but to explore uncertainties, possible consequences, and possible outcomes.46 

•  2009 price level:  Costs are normalized to beginning-of-year 2009 dollars using inflation factors developed by Engineering News-
Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index, and using regional cost adjustment factors applied to each plant cost 
estimate involving on-site construction.  These regional factors account for the variability between states in site work 
and landscape construction costs.  Cost adjustment factors are derived from the Means Building Construction Costs 
Year 2003 city factors.  All the cities for each state were averaged together to derive a state average.

•  Before-tax costs:    Baseline disposal costs estimated on a before-tax basis to approximate the overall economic cost (i.e., real resource 

allocation for the economy as a whole, rather than on an after-tax basis which would approximate a relatively narrower 
financial cost to the electric utility industry because after-tax costs subtract business expense tax deductions and 
depreciation of capital expenditures for pollution control equipment. 

•  50-year period:    A 50-year future time horizon (aka period-of-analysis) was applied because new construction for replacement of all 

CCR disposal units and end of existing lifespan is estimated to have occurred at least once by that time. 

•  7% discount rate:  

 A 7% discount rate was applied for calculating both net present value cost and average annualized cost for the 
engineering control unit costs applied in this RIA.  Because both the annualized baseline cost and annualized 
incremental proposed rule costs estimated in this RIA consist of primarily (i.e., >95%) industry cost rather than 
government cost, this RIA applies a 7% discount rate rather than a lower (e.g., 3%, 2%, 1% or 0%) discount rate to 
represent the opportunity cost of business capital investment and business expense financing (i.e., the average rate of 
return to corporate capital).  This is consistent with OMB’s 2003 Circular A-447 (page 33) and 1992 Circular A-9448 
(page 8) which indicate that a 7% discount rate base-case should be used for regulatory analyses when regulation is 
expected to primarily and directly affect businesses and industries. 

•  0.73% growth:  

 Baseline cost estimates increased 0.73% per year over the 50-year future time horizon to reflect a 0.73% annual 
growth in coal consumption at electric utility plants (which is a proxy for future annual growth in the annual tonnage of 
CCR generation needing disposal from those plants).  The 0.73% annual growth factor is based on DOE-EIA's January 
2009 "Annual Energy Outlook 2009" forecast change in US coal consumption for electricity generation between year 
2010 (22.91 quadrillion Btus) and 2030 (26.41 quadrillion Btus), available at: 
http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/index.html 

•  Beneficial use:   

If reported in the baseline by any particular plant, beneficial use was assumed to continue in the future by that plant 
under the baseline projection over the 50-year future period-of-analysis.  Section 5C in Chapter 5 of this RIA 
evaluates potential changes to this beneficial use baseline under alternative regulatory impact scenarios. 

•  Offsite disposal:   

If reported in baseline by any particular plant, offsite disposal was assumed to continue in the future by that plant.  
Offsite disposal landfill cost estimated under both baseline and regulatory options using the engineering control cost 
model.  Truck operating cost estimated separately outside of the model. 

•  Existing unit closure:  One set of years for the opening and closure of disposal units are assumed for each facility.  If data for initial year of 

operation were provided in the 1995 EPRI Comanagement Survey, these data were used.  If the plant had more than

•  New unit construction:  The timing of when baseline state regulatory requirements for newly constructed units begin to be incurred depends 

on the installation and closure date for the existing disposal units.  Baseline state regulatory cost requirements are 
incurred at the closure date of the disposal unit when new unit construction occurs.  For example, if a plant’s disposal 
unit is assumed in this RIA to close in 2019; new unit construction costs required under state regulations are incurred 
over its assumed 40-year future lifespan beginning in 2020. 

one disposal unit and more than one reported date for initial year of operation, the years were averaged.  For example, 
if a facility had three disposal units (2 landfills and 1 impoundment) with installation dates of 1970, 1980, and 1990, 
this RIA assumed the installation date of all the units was 1980.  This assumption simplified the cost calculations on a 
per facility basis instead of a per disposal unit basis.  If no disposal unit installation data were available, the installation 
year is assumed to be equal to the earliest boiler installation year reported in either the 2007 EIA 860 database for that 
plant or 1998 EIA 767 database, whichever was older.  If no disposal unit or boiler installation year data were 
available, an installation year of 1980 was assumed.  If the 1995 EPRI Comanagement Survey provided a forecasted 
closure year for a unit, new unit installation is assumed to occur in that year.  Otherwise, if no closure forecast year is 
provided, closure is assumed to occur 40 years after the year of installation (assumed average lifespan for CCR landfills 
and impoundments). 

•  New landfills:  The most economic of three landfill options – (1) combination landfill with 50% of waste below 
ground and 50% above ground, (2) pile landfill with 5 % of waste below ground and 95% above ground, or (3) 
offsite landfill -- is determined within the cost model.  The cost for the most economical approach is assigned to 
that plant unless available data specify otherwise.  The choice is dependent upon on estimated engineering 
control costs and annual CCR disposal tonnage. 

•  New impoundments:  If currently used as a disposal unit, this RIA assumes a landfill will be constructed as the 
future new disposal unit as impoundments reach end of lifespan, because the model calculates that new landfills 
are more economical to construct for two cost reasons: (a) if no pre-existing land depressions for use as a new 
impoundment, the cost for a larger excavation for a new impoundment rather than a smaller excavation for a 
landfill is necessary, and (b) the primary determinant of many of the cost for engineering controls is the footprint 
of the disposal unit such that the same set of engineering controls for a new impoundment would be more 
expensive than for a new landfill.  However, the cost model does not estimate the associated capital and annual 
O&M costs for future conversion of existing wet ash and wet scrubber boilers and conversion of wet CCR 
conveyance equipment used for moving CCR to disposal units.  These conversion costs are estimated separately 
outside of the cost model in this RIA.

•  Baseline “Engineering Control” Cost Estimates 

 
1. Baseline ground water monitoring 
Groundwater  monitoring  costs  are  based  on  the  Remedial  Action  Cost  Engineering  and  Requirements  (RACER)  cost  estimating  software 
(2002) with costs based on the R.S. Means, Environmental Cost Handling Options and Solutions (ECHOS), Environmental Remediation Cost 
Data (2002). 
(cid:131)  Assumes same groundwater monitoring requirements for both landfills and impoundments 
(cid:131)  Point of compliance: 

Placement at the unit boundary is assumed in the cost estimates.  Unit boundary point-of-compliance monitoring complies with the “within 
150 meter point-of-compliance” criterion.  Plants monitoring at the unit boundary will incur no additional costs under the within 150 meter 
placement criteria. 

(cid:131)  Number of wells: 

EPA’s March 1985 “Ground Water Technical Enforcement Guidance” Document (pages 2-8 to 2-16) recommends a maximum of 150 feet 
spacing between down-gradient wells.  EPA’s December 1980 SW-611 “Procedures Manual for Groundwater Monitoring at Solid Waste 
Disposal Facilities” (pages 40 to 43) recommends a maximum of 250 feet spacing between down-gradient wells.  Assuming the technical 
documents are the most stringent and the state regulation minimums are the least stringent, a middle ground within the range is anticipated 
and used in the cost estimates.  This RIA does not evaluate the cost differences between the upper and lower bounds of well spacing.  
Groundwater monitoring well costs in this analysis assume a minimum of 2 down-gradient wells for the first 800 feet of length along two 
sides of the landfill or impoundment unit, which is assumed to be square, plus additional wells spaced every 400 feet.  In addition, one up-
gradient well is assumed. 

The cost estimates include monitoring for the following chemical indicators and metals, which represents a reasonable “likely-case” 
scenario between indicators only and RCRA 40 CFR 261 Appendix VIII constituent monitoring which includes about 500 chemical 
substances: 

o Chemical indicators: Based on EPA’s 1999 cement kiln dust proposed rule parameters (i.e., pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, 
o Metals: Metals with primary and secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) (i.e., Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ag, Zn, Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, 

potassium, chloride, sodium, and sulfate) as a cost proxy. 

(cid:131)  Constituents: 

Cr, Pb, Hg, Se, Tl). 

(cid:131)  Frequency: 

The cost estimates only include semi-annual sampling (most-likely case) analogous to EPA’s 1999 cement kiln dust proposed rule and to 
many current state regulations, even if some states require a quarterly or annual basis. 

(cid:131)  Unitized cost estimate:  Dividing the average annual cost estimate result displayed in Exhibit 3L below (row item 1) for baseline ground 

water monitoring, by the count of electric utility plants estimated in Exhibit 3I (row 1, column A) and Exhibit 3J (row 1, column A) above 
to conduct that activity under state government requirements, yields an average annual per-plant (i.e., unitized) cost estimate of $64,000.  In 
comparison, EPA’s most recent (2008) Information Collection Request (ICR) No. 0959.13 “Ground-Water Monitoring Requirements” 
(renewal) for the RCRA Subtitle C 40 CFR 264.92 and 265.92 TSDF “ground-water protection standard” provides an estimate of $28,130 

 

55 

per year.49  The $64,000 unitized cost for groundwater monitoring generated by the above assumptions applied in the engineering control 
cost model used for this RIA is 2.3 times larger and more appropriate to this RIA because it reflects a larger number of wells per-plant to 
monitor the groundwater under the larger sized CCR disposal units compared to the average sizes of other types of industrial waste disposal 
units. 
 

2.  Baseline bottom liners 
(cid:131)  Same bottom liner requirements for both new landfills and new impoundments 
(cid:131)  The cost estimates include a composite (2-foot compacted clay-synthetic) liner for the more stringent design and a 2-foot compacted clay 

liner, single-synthetic liner, and a 2-foot compacted ash liner for less stringent baseline designs. 

 
3.  Baseline leachate collection system 
(cid:131)  No leachate collection is assumed from beneath the impoundment liner 
(cid:131)  The cost estimate is comprised of perforated pipes spaced approximately 300 feet apart along the base of the unit.  It includes a wet well for 

leachate collection.  Leachate is shipped by truck for off-site treatment. 

(cid:131)  Assumes 3-inches of leachate per year collected in landfill leachate collection systems. 
 
4.  Baseline dust controls 
Cost estimate includes CCR compaction equipment, water trucks for spraying CCR during compaction and for spraying unpaved landfill roads, 
and covers for landfill trucks: 
(cid:131)  Compaction Equipment 

Ash is assumed to be compacted in the waste management area by self-propelled rollers for regulatory scenarios including dust controls. A 
model cost assumption is that four passes are made by the roller in 6-inch lifts. With these assumptions, the roller can compact 
approximately 1,300 cy of ash per day.  The operating life of purchased compaction equipment is assumed to be five years. The number of 
sheepsfoot rollers required is estimated as follows: 

Ash is assumed to be wetted in the waste management area by water trucks to facilitate compaction and to control dust. A model assumption is 
that FFC plants currently use water trucks 50% of the operational day to control dust on roads (see Water Spray on Roads). It is reasonable to 

                                                 
49 $28,130 per year per-facility average cost derived for purpose of this RIA by dividing the reported $27.818 million annual cost by the reported 989 TSDFs from the EPA 
ICR 0959.13, Federal Register, Vol.73, No.103, page 30617; 28 May 2008; http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-11888.pdf

Rollers = (tons/yr)(2,000 lb/ton)(16.02 kg/m3 / lb/cf) 

(1,190 kg/m3)(27 cf/cy)(1,300 cy/day)(300 days/yr) 

The cost of a sheepsfoot roller is assumed to be $75,000 in 1995 dollars. 
Plants will incur annual costs for equipment operation ($0.63/cy) and maintenance. 
Maintenance costs are assumed to be 5% of capital costs. Annual costs for compaction are estimated as follows: 

Annual Cost = 

 

(tons/yr)(2,000 lb/ton)(16.02 kg/m3 / lb/cf)($0.63/cy) + $75,000*0.05*Rollers 

• 

Water Truck for Compaction: 

(1,190 kg/m3)(27 cf/cy) 

assume that the same water trucks will be used for the roads and the ash management unit. Therefore, it is assumed that an existing water truck 
is available for compaction 50% of the operational day. Additional water trucks are assumed to be necessary to facilitate compaction for large 
facilities. The cost of tarps, tarp mechanisms, and installation of the mechanisms, as well as the life of each tarp were estimated by ICF in “Cost 
Functions for Alternative CKD Control Technologies” (Draft), 19 July 1996.  A model assumption is that a water truck will be necessary for 
compaction 50% of the time required by the compaction equipment. The water truck time for compaction is estimated as follows: 

Water Truck Time for Compaction = 

 

(tons/yr)(2,000 lb/ton)(16.02 kg/m3 / lb/cf)(8 hr/day)(0.5) 

(1,190 kg/m3)(27 cf/cy)(1,300 cy/day) 

One existing water truck for compaction and water spray on roads is estimated to be sufficient for plants managing less than 391,000 tons per 
year of ash. Facilities managing between 391,000 and 1,173,000 tons per year are assumed to purchase one additional water truck.  Facilities 
managing between 1,173,000 and 1,955,000 tons per year are assumed to purchase two additional water trucks. Facilities managing more than 
1,955,000 tons per year to the maximum facility size modeled of 2,000,000 tons per year are assumed to purchase three additional water trucks. 
The cost of a water truck is assumed to be $101,000 in 1995 dollars. The water truck operating life is assumed to be five years.  The operating 
costs for water spray for compaction are estimated assuming that the truck travels approximately five miles per day, for each day used, with a 
fuel consumption of five miles per gallon at a fuel cost of $1.15 per gallon. The truck is assumed to operate 50% of the hours required for 
compaction. The daily water volume used is assumed to be 10,000 gallons, at a cost of $2 per 1,000 gallons. The annual cost associated with 
ash management is estimated as follows: 

Annual Cost = 

 

(tons/yr)(2,000 lb/MT)(16.02 kg/m3 / lb/cf)(0.5) * [(8hr/day)($31.50/hr) 

(1,190 kg/m3)(27 cf/cy)(1,300 cy/day) 
+ (5 mi/day)($1.15/gal)/(5 mi/gal) + (10,000 gal/day)($2/1,000 gal)] 

•  Covers on Trucks: 

Covers on hauling trucks as a fugitive dust control technology is an option for the compliance scenarios.  Capital costs for this dust control 
technology include the cost of the roll-on tarp mechanism and the installation of this mechanism.  Capital costs for covers on trucks are 
estimated as follows: Capital Cost = [(tons/year) x (2,000 lb/ton) x (16.02 kg/m3 / lb/cf) x (0.65 hr/load)] x ($4,800) 
Water truck capacity, refill time, and spray width were estimated by ICF in “Cost Functions for Alternative CKD Control Technologies” 
(Draft), dated July 19, 1996. 
(1,190 kg/m3)(0.80)(27 cf/cy)(9 cy/load)(2,400 hr/yr) 
Annual costs for this dust control technology include the cost of the tarps and the cost to replace the tarps. Tarps are estimated to be replaced 
every 150 loads. Replacement of a tarp is estimated to require 15 minutes. Annual costs for covers on trucks are estimated as follows: 

Annual Cost = 

 

(tons/yr)(2,000 lb/ton)(16.02 kg/m3 / lb/cf)($155/tarp + 0.25hr/tarp*$19/hr) 

•  Water Spray on Roads: 

(1,190 kg/m3)(0.80)(27 cf/cy)(9 cy/load)(150 load/tarp) 

Water spray on roads is required as a fugitive dust control technology for the compliance scenarios. A model assumption is that FFC plants 
currently have water trucks and use water spray on roads as a baseline management practice.  A model assumption is that dust control is 
required for a road length of 1.5 miles (3 miles roundtrip), with a road width of 10 meters. The water truck capacity is assumed to be 5,000 
gallons and requires approximately one hour to fill. The water truck can spray a width of five meters at an assumed speed of 10 miles per hour.  
For the baseline scenario, a model assumption is that the entire water volume (5,000 gallons) will be sprayed on each pass of the truck along 
one side of the road (i.e., 1.5 miles x 5 meters).  The resulting water volume per road area, averaged over the 1.25 hours required to spray the 
 

57 

road and refill the truck, is approximately 2.5 times that of the average hourly daytime evaporation rate. Therefore, water spray on roads will be 
required 3 times per day.  The water volume sprayed per road area is estimated as follows: 

Water per Area = 

(1.5 mi)(5,280 ft/mi)(0.3048 m/ft)(10 m)(5,000 gal)(3.785 L/gal) = 0.784 L/m2 

The time required for the water truck to be filled, spray along both sides of the road, and return for refilling is estimated as follows: 

Time =   

(1 hour) + (3 miles)/(10 miles/hour) = 1.3 hour 

Therefore, the total time for one pass is assumed to be 1 hour and 15 minutes. The average rate of water spray is estimated as follows: 

Spray Rate = 

(0.784 L/m2)(1,000 ml/L)(cm3/ml)(1,000 mm/m) = 0.6272 mm/hr 

 

 

(100 cm/m)3(1.25 hr) 

The average hourly daytime evaporation rate is approximately 0.25 mm/hr. Therefore, the water spray rate is approximately 2.5 times the 
evaporation rate. Since the total time required for water spray (1.25 hour) times 2.5 is approximately 3, a model assumption is that water spray 
on roads is required approximately every 3 hours. In order to coordinate the water truck use for road spray and ash compaction, it is assumed 
that the truck alternates between these two requirements during the day. Therefore, over a nine-hour day (eight working hours plus one hour for 
lunch), roads are sprayed 3 times, requiring a total of approximately 4 hours, or 50% of the operational day. Because it is assumed that FFC 
facilities currently spray water on roads for dust control, the incremental cost from the baseline to the compliance scenarios is zero. 
 
5.  Baseline rain and surface water run-on/run-off controls (landfills only) 
The cost estimates assume that stormwater run-on/run-off control is comprised of a ditch surrounding active area of landfill and an excavated 
bermed basin for water collection. 
 
6.  Baseline financial assurance for CCR disposal unit closure and post-closure care   
Financial assurance helps assure that the owners and operators of CCR landfills and impoundments have adequately planned for the future cost 
of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases, and to assure that adequate funds will be available when needed to cover 
these costs if the owner or operator is unwilling or unable to do so.  Financial assurance helps protect future generations from paying for 
damages caused by or the prevention of damages potentially created from current waste management activities.  Requiring provision of 
financial assurance during operation of landfills and impoundments places the cost burden on the current owner and consumer, and prevents 
costs from being passed from the current generation to future generations. 
 
The differences between RCRA Subtitle C and Subtitle D financial assurance mechanisms are not assessed.  This RIA assumes the same 
requirements for both landfills and impoundments: 

The cost estimate includes the costs for selecting a financial mechanism, establishing a financial test, and establishing a letter of credit.  

•  Capital cost includes selection of financial assurance mechanism, establishment of financial test, and establishment of letter of credit.  
The letter of credit is assumed to be most available to utilities and will be utilized in most circumstances.  This is amortized in the annual 
cost. 
•  Annual cost includes maintenance of financial test and maintenance of letter of credit.  Establishment and annual maintenance of the 
letter of credit is estimated to be 1% to 3% of the nominal value of the letter of credit (i.e., total cost of closure and post closure).   This RIA 
applied the 2% midpoint of this range.  Implementation costs are estimated on the assumption that an outside consulting firm and legal 
assistance will assist in obtaining and maintaining the letter of credit ($692 per year in 1995 dollars or $1,051 per year inflated to 2009 
dollars).  Estimate obtained from Mohammad Iqbal and John Collier, ICF, Inc., “Local Government Financial Test Economic Analysis,”

Economic Benefits of RCRA Noncompliance,” September 1997. 

 
7.  Baseline disposal unit location restrictions 
Baseline cost not estimated in this RIA. 
 
8.  Baseline closure capping to cover unit 
The cost estimate for this engineering control does not include the closure plan cost or closure certification costs.  Capping costs are a large 
capital expense.  So, if a unit is expected to close in one year the total capping cost is assigned to the last year in the life of the unit.  However, 
businesses are likely to borrow money from a bank for these large capital costs and annualize them over a set period of time, for example, 10 or 
20 years.  Incremental cost estimates in the cost model are overestimated for large capital expenditures applied to existing units that have been 
added over short time periods.  In addition, owners are likely to close these units prior to the proposed rule coming into effect if promulgated as 
a final rule.  This RIA assumes the same requirements for both landfills and impoundments: 
(cid:131)  Synthetic cap with drainage layer is comprised of a 60 mil HDPE synthetic liner, 1 foot sand, filter fabric, 1.5 foot slope and earth fill, 0.5 

foot topsoil, and vegetation.  It includes a perforated pipe for drainage collection. 

(cid:131)  Synthetic cap without drainage layer is comprised of a 60 mil HDPE synthetic liner, 1.5 foot slope and earth fill, 0.5 foot topsoil, and 

(cid:131)  Clay cap is comprised of 2 feet of off-site clay, 0.5 foot topsoil, and vegetation.  Cover costs would be lower if on-site clay is available. 
(cid:131)  Soil/clay cover is comprised of 0.5 foot clay, 0.5 foot earthfill, and 0.5 foot topsoil, and vegetation.  Cover costs would be lower if on-site 

vegetation. 

clay is available. 

(cid:131)  Soil cap is comprised of a 1.5 foot slope and earth fill, 0.5 foot topsoil, and vegetation.  The slope of the cap is assumed to be 0.02:1 (rise:run) 

with a cover toe slope of 4:1 (run:rise). 

 
9.  Baseline post-closure groundwater monitoring requirements 
(cid:131)  Same requirements for both landfills and impoundments 
(cid:131)  Baseline post-closure monitoring is assumed to comprise 30 years of groundwater monitoring and surface water monitoring on a semi-annual 

basis.  The physical parameters (i.e., point of compliance, number of wells, sets of chemical indicators and sets of chemical constituents 
monitored, and semi-annual frequency) and unit cost are assumed identical as defined in the baseline groundwater monitoring cost item 1 
above in this section of the RIA. 

(cid:131)  However, post-closure monitoring costs are estimated in this RIA assuming an annual sum is placed in a fund by affected entities (i.e., electric 
utility owners) during the assumed average 40-year operating life of the CCR disposal unit.  At the time of closure sufficient monies will be 
available in the fund to cover post-closure monitoring for the next 30 years beyond end-of-lifespan, assuming an annual interest rate of 7%. 

 
10.  Baseline storage tank/container design and operating standards

•  Baseline “Ancillary Costs” Estimates 

 
11.  Baseline offsite disposal 
The baseline cost for engineering controls at offsite CCR disposal sites (assumed in this RIA to be commercial Subtitle D landfills) is estimated 
using the same cost model as the engineering controls for onsite disposal units.  In addition, the offsite disposal baseline cost includes the cost 
for truck transport from the electric utility plant to the offsite landfill, calculated as follows: 
(cid:131)  Baseline Assumptions: 
o  12% (15 million tons/year) CCR currently trucked offsite to non-haz LFs (2005) 
o  6 miles average one-way trucking distance to offsite LFs50 
o  $0.10/ton/mile non-haz waste truck operating cost 
o  12 tons CCR per full truckload (source: Gambrills MD case study); (15 million tons/year) / (12 tons/load) = 1.25 million truckloads 

per year 

(cid:131)  Baseline Cost Calculations: 

o  Manifest cost: $0 
o  Trucking cost: (15 million tons/year) x (6 miles) x ($0.10/ton/mile truck operating cost for non hazmat) = $9.0 million/year 

 
12.  Baseline structural integrity inspections 
Assumptions: 
Baseline assumption is that 82% of CCR disposal units at electric utility plants are inspected (source: page 36 of joint DOE/EPA report “Coal 
Combustion Waste Management at Landfills and Surface Impoundments, 1994-2004”, report nr. DOE/PI-0004, Aug 2006 at: 
http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/dsp_detail.cfm?PubID=2008).  Per-plant cost for inspections estimated in Exhibit 3K below. 
Cost Calculation: 
Industry cost: ($10,829/year per facility) x (82% inspected) x (495 plants) = $4.40 million per year 
State government cost: ($599/year per facility) x (82% inspected) x (495 plants) = $0.24 million per year 

Total (industry + state) = $4.64 million per year

Baseline cost assumed to be $0 because this RIA assumes that all baseline CCR disposal units used by electric utility plants are not regulated 
under RCRA Subtitle C. 
 
14. Baseline facility-wide corrective action 
Because CCR is not regulated as Subtitle C hazardous waste, there are no existing facility-wide (i.e., CCR disposal units plus other waste units 
also located at the same plant) corrective action requirements, although some state governments have the following unit-specific corrective 
action requirements affecting CCR disposal units. 
State regulations for the top 25 coal usage states (for electricity) were reviewed for correction action requirements in 2000.  These regulations 
were not updated as part of this RIA.  Corrective action requirements were identified in 21 of the 25 states. 
•  Surface impoundments: 71% of CCR impoundments representing 67% of CCR impoundment annual tonnage have state government baseline 

corrective action requirements: 

regulations 

o AZ, IN, and IA establish a corrective action alert level and response action in site-specific state permits 
o CO requires corrective action for new units 
o 9 states (FL, GA, KY, MI, NC, ND, PA, UT, WI) require corrective action 
o IL, MN, TX, WV, WY do not allow groundwater degradation, but specific enforcement mechanisms are not specified in state 
o MO requires corrective action for units closed with waste in place, otherwise, corrective action may be established under a permit 
o NM requires an abatement plan. 
o AZ establishes corrective action alert level and response action in site-specific state permits 
o 15 states (CO, FL, GA, IL, KY, MI, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, UT, WV, WI, WY) require corrective action 
o MN, TX do not allow groundwater degradation, but, specific enforcement mechanisms are not specified in state regulations 
o MO, TN require assessment only 
o NM requires an abatement plan

•  Validity Check of Baseline Cost Estimate (2 Tests): 
 

o  Validity Test #1 of 2:  Comparison to ACAA Published Estimate of Average CCR Disposal Cost 

 
As displayed above in Exhibit 3L the estimated baseline (i.e., current) average annualized cost to the 495 coal-fired electric utility plants for 
disposal of CCR is $5.6 billion per year (2009$).  This annualized cost includes amortization of capital investment in construction of disposal 
units and associated equipment (i.e., in-plant equipment for extracting CCR from boilers, CCR storage equipment, CCR conveyance equipment 
such as slurry pipelines for wet CCR or trucks and mechanical conveyor belts for dry CCR, and the disposal units themselves), plus annual 
expenditures for operation, maintenance and replacement/expansion of this equipment and disposal units.  On a unitized cost-per-ton basis -- 
calculated by dividing the annualized baseline cost by the estimated 94.2  million tons per year (as of 2005) CCR disposed in (a) onsite landfills 
plus (b) offsite landfills plus (c) impoundments annually – the estimated baseline cost represents an average unitized cost of $59 per-ton. 
 
In comparison, the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) estimates that the average unit cost (per-ton) for baseline disposal of CCR by 
coal-fired electric utility plants ranges as low as $3 per-ton to higher than $40 per-ton: 
 

"As one can see, a variety of factors enter into determining disposal costs.  The lowest cost occurs when a disposal site is 
located near the power plant and the material being disposed can be easily handled.  If the material can be piped, rather than 
trucked, costs are usually lower.  In these types of situations, cost may be as low as $3 to $5 per ton. In other areas, when 
distance is far away and the [CCR] must be handled several times due to its moisture content or volume, costs could range from 
$20 to $40 per ton.  In some areas, the costs are even higher.  If new sites are required and extensive permitting processes take 
place, the total cost of the facility may be increased, resulting in higher disposal costs over time."52 

 
The reasons the average annualized and unitized baseline CCR disposal cost of $59 per-ton estimated in this RIA, is higher than the baseline 
cost range of $3 to over $40 per-ton reported by the ACAA, are: 
 

•  Low-end unitized cost:  The low-end of ACAA’s reported cost range is $3 to $5 per-ton.  Assuming the cheapest operating surface 
impoundment does not include a liner and leachate collection costs as estimated in this RIA for impoundments in states with such 
regulatory requirements, the baseline surface impoundment unitized cost may be as low as $2 per-ton based on the cost elements 
applied in this RIA.  This low-end unitized cost may be derived from the impoundment cost column of Exhibit 3L as follows: 

 

 

(Column total cost - Row 2 cost - Row 3 cost) / (22.4 million tons per year managed in impoundments) = 
($1,317 million/year - $1,219 million/year - $52.2 million/year) / (22.4 million tons per year) = $2.04 per-ton 

• High-end unitized cost:  The upper-end of ACAA’s reported cost range is $20 to $40 per ton, which applies to offsite disposal.  The 
cost estimation of this RIA incorporates off-site commercial disposal costs on a state-by-state specific basis according to electricity

power plant location, using commercial landfill tipping fees ($2009) for contaminated soil, which range widely from $11 per-ton to 
$135 per-ton, with a national average of $50 per-ton.  For example, commercial landfill tipping fees for contaminated soil for some of 
the high coal usage states are:  TN = $11.19/ton, IN = $32.73/ton, OH = $35.48/ton, and PA = $57.96/ton.  The baseline cost 
estimation method of this RIA then added a CCR offsite transportation and loading cost of approximately $33 per-ton based on the 
RACER cost estimation tool.  For the estimated 15.0 million tons per-year of CCR disposed in offsite landfills, the estimated baseline 
cost is $1,193 million per-year, which is equivalent to $79.53 per-ton over the 50-year time period of the RIA cost analysis which 
assumes increasing coal usage (0.73% per-year) by electric utilities and subsequent offsite landfill disposal over the 50 year time 
period.  It is unknown what cost elements are included in the high-end of the ACAA reported cost range (e.g., transportation cost 
and/or landfill tipping fee cost).  In addition, electric utility companies likely have annual or multi-year contracts with offsite landfill 
operators that offer lower tipping fees than the state-average off-site contaminated soil tipping fees used in this RIA. 

 
 

o  Validity Test #2 of 2:  Comparison to CCR Disposal Costs Contained in the EIA Form 767 Database 

 
The 2005 Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form 767 database (Schedule 3, Part B) indicates $5,890 million in annual capital and 
O&M cost reported by steam electric plants with nameplate capacity of 100 MW or greater, including (a) $0.314 million per year for water 
pollution controls, (b) $0.193 million per year for solid waste disposal, (c) $0.185 million per year for other pollution controls, (d) $3,627 
million per year capital expense for air pollution abatement, and (e) $1,546 million per year for collection and disposal O&M costs for fly ash, 
bottom ash, and FGD.  This last cost element --- $1,546 million per year for CCR disposal --- is only 28% of the $5,556 million per year 
estimate displayed in Exhibit 3L above.  However, the 2005 EIA Form 767 cost data are associated with only 179 coal-fired electric utility 
plants, which represent only 36% of the 495 coal-fired electric utility plants addressed by this RIA.  Therefore, to facilitate a direct comparison, 
the $1,546 million per year cost from the data in EIA Form 767 may be extrapolated to all 495 plants by multiplying by the factor 2.765 (i.e., 
495 / 179), which produces an estimated extrapolated cost for all 495 plants of $4,275 million per year (i.e., 2.765 x $1,546 million per year).  
This extrapolated cost is 23% lower than the $5,556 million per year baseline cost estimated in this RIA.  This comparison suggests the 
baseline cost estimated in this RIA may be an over-estimate, but it is not clear whether the cost data in the EIA Form 767 database include 
baseline costs to the electric utility plants for compliance with existing state government regulations concerning CCR disposal (e.g., the 
annualized cost for obtaining and maintaining state government disposal permits and the annualized cost for impoundment structural integrity 
inspections), as does this RIA.

Estimated Cost for RCRA Regulation of CCR Disposal 

Chapter 4 

 
 

Note:  EPA formulated cost estimates in this Chapter based on the October 2009 draft RIA regulatory options.  Because the 
high-end cost of those options (i.e., for the Subtitle C “hazardous waste” option) is larger than the high-end cost for the 2010 
regulatory options (i.e., for the Subtitle C “special waste” option), the costs in this Chapter are proportionately over-estimated.  
However, Section 6B of this RIA applies scaling factors to adjust the costs estimated in this Chapter to the 2010 options. 

 
 
4A.  EPA’s Prior Cost Estimates for Possible RCRA Regulation of CCR Disposal at Electric Utility Plants 
 
In prior studies, EPA’s Office of Solid Waste (which EPA renamed as the ORCR effective 18 January 2009), formulated the following industry 
compliance cost estimates for different RCRA-based regulatory approaches to CCR disposal by the electric utility industry: 
 
1988:  OSW's 1988 Report to Congress on CCR estimated $2.4 billion to $4.7 billion per year (1986$) in potential average annualized 

industry cost (514 plants in 1984) for compliance with technical standards contained in 40 CFR 264 RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste 
regulations. The range reflects different liner assumptions (i.e., single versus double liners) and whether only unlined CCR units close 
or all existing units close requiring construction of new units.  This cost includes closure costs but not a cost for corrective action 
excavating and removing CCR to Subtitle C facilities for closure of existing units.  This report separately estimated that corrective 
action “at a cost of about $2.0 billion per plant, industry-wide costs would exceed $1.0 trillion” lump-sum cost, which is equivalent to 
$43 billion annualized cost (discounted @3% over 40-years).  Source: EPA-OSWER report nr. EPA/530-SW-88-002, Feb 1988. 

1999:  OSW’s 1999 Report to Congress focused on the “co-management” (i.e., low-volume mixed with high-volume) subset of CCR units 

(i.e., 206 units at 353 plants in 1994), constituting 53 million tons (50%) of the 105 million total high-volume electric utility CCR 
generation in 1997.  This report estimated a range of $800 million to $900 million per year (1998$) in potential average annualized 
compliance cost to the electric utility industry to comply with technical standards similar to 40 CFR 258 RCRA Subtitle D non-
hazardous waste regulations. This cost estimate includes opening new CCR units to replace existing units that do not meet Subtitle D 
standards, including the following itemized costs: land purchase, site development, liner installation, leachate collection, groundwater 
wells & monitoring, closure costs, and post-closure costs.  This estimate accounted for state CCR management requirements as of 1997.  
Source: EPA OSWER report nr. EPA 530-R-99-010, March 1999. 

2005:  In a November 2005 report, an OSW contractor (DPRA Inc) estimated $304 million to $521 million per year (2005$) in potential 

average annualized cost for the electric utility industry (i.e., 470 units at 452 plants in 2003) to comply with regulatory options 
developed with reference to the “tailored standards” of EPA’s 1999 cement kiln dust proposed rule which based many elements on 40 
CFR 258 RCRA Subtitle D non-hazardous waste regulations. Cost elements in this report included (a) location standards, (b) operating 
criteria such as cover material, dust control, run-on/run-off control, (c) design criteria such as liner and leachate collection, (d) 
groundwater monitoring, (e) closure and post-closure standards, and (f) financial assurance for closure, post-closure and corrective

action. This estimate accounted for state CCR management requirements as of 2004, but did not include costs for corrective action.  
Source: EPA-OSWER document ID nr. EPA-HQ-RCRA-2006-0796-0469 at http://www.regulations.gov. 

 
These three prior RCRA regulatory cost estimates range from $304 million to $4.7 billion per year.  Even without updating these prior cost 
estimates to the current 2009 price level, all three prior cost estimates exceed the 1993 Executive Order 12866 Section 3(f)(1) “economically 
significant” $100 million annual effect threshold for Federal rulemakings. 
 
 
4B.  Regulatory Cost Estimation Algorithms & Results 
 
This section presents incremental cost estimates for each regulatory option, for both existing active (i.e., operating) and future new CCR 
landfills and impoundments, and by size/type of affected electric utility plant owner entity.  Incremental comparison of the estimated cost of 
each regulatory option to the baseline (as estimated in Chapter 3 of this RIA) is consistent with OMB’s 2003 “Circular A-4: Regulatory 
Analysis” best practices guidance to Federal agencies: 
 

“Identify a baseline.  Benefits and costs are defined in comparison with a clearly stated alternative.  This normally will be a “no 
action” baseline: what the world will be like if the proposed rule is not adopted.” 

 
As listed below, this RIA estimates 18 potential regulatory costs and the land disposal restriction (LDR) dewatering treatment standard, based 
on many of the same unit cost data sources and the same framework (i.e., 2009 price level, 50-year period of analysis, etc.), identified in the 
prior chapter of this RIA for baseline cost estimation.  According to three methodological groupings, this RIA estimates three categories of 
regulatory costs: 
 

A. Engineering controls for CCR disposal units – estimated using the cost model described in the prior chapter of this RIA: 
1.  Ground water monitoring 
2.  Bottom liners – for future new units only 
3.  Leachate collection system – for future new units only 
4.  Dust controls – applicable to landfills only 
5.  Rain and surface water run-on/run-off controls – applicable to landfills only 
6.  Financial assurance for disposal unit closure and post-closure 
7.  Disposal unit location restrictions (6 types: water tables, floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic zones, karst terrain) 
8.  Closure capping to cover unit 
9.  Post-closure monitoring requirements 
10. Temporary  storage  requirements  –  not  estimated  in  this  RIA  because  do  not  have  information  on  the  baseline  counts  or  physical 

conditions of CCR storage tanks and storage buildings at electric utility plants. 

 

68 

 
C. LDR cost for land disposal restriction dewatering treatment – Sections 3004(d) and (m) of the RCRA statute require treatment prior to 
land disposal for Subtitle C hazardous waste listings, but not for Subtitle D non-hazardous waste regulation.  The purpose of the treatment 
is to “substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the 
waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environment are minimized” (source: section 3004(m)): 

o  Dry CCR disposal (landfills): 
Moisture conditioning and compaction included in engineering control cost item 4. 
o  Wet CCR disposal (impoundments):  Estimated outside and separately of the engineering controls cost model in this RIA. 

 

B. Ancillary costs for CCR disposal – estimated outside of the engineering control cost model: 
11. Offsite disposal (hazmat trucking, RCRA manifesting, offsite RCRA TSDF permits) 
12. Structural integrity inspections – impoundments only 
13. RCRA facility-wide investigation (RFI) 
14. RCRA facility-wide corrective action 
15. RCRA TSDF hazardous waste disposal permits for onsite disposal 
16. RCRA enforcement inspection 
17. Cleanup remediation of future CCR impoundment failures as RCRA hazardous waste 
18. EPA administrative reporting & recordkeeping 

4B.1  Regulatory Cost to Industry for RCRA “Engineering Controls” 

 
This RIA does not include either qualitative or quantitative estimation of the potential effects of the proposed rule on economic productivity, 
economic growth, employment, job creation, or international economic competitiveness.  These potential effects are identified as factors in 
both the 1993 Executive Order “Regulatory Planning and Review” (section 3(f)(1)) and in the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (section 
202(a)(4)).  These other potential economic effects are excluded from this RIA because the upper-end of the range in average annualized 
regulatory cost across all regulatory options as estimated in this chapter below, does not exceed the 0.25% to 0.5% of Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) threshold identified in OMB’s 1995 guidance53 for attempting to measure such other economic effects for purpose of UMRA economic 
analysis compliance.  Based on the 2008 US GDP of $14.42 trillion,54 the 0.25% to 0.5% threshold is equal to $36 billion to $72 billion. 
 
 
 
 
This RIA assumes that that same set of RCRA 3004(x) custom-tailored engineering controls is required under each of the regulatory options, so 
the costs for engineering controls for all regulatory options are mostly, but not entirely, based on the same cost estimation formulae described 
above in Chapter 3 for estimation of baseline engineering control costs.  Furthermore, this RIA assumes that the engineering control costs are 
                                                 
53 Source: Section 4.B(3) of OMB’s 31 March 1995 guidance for implementing the UMRA state that “We would note that such macro-economic effects tend to be 
measurable, in nation-wide econometric models, only if the economic impact of the regulation reaches 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product.  A regulation 
with a smaller aggregate effect is highly unlikely to have any measurable impact in macro-economic terms unless it is highly focuses on a particular geographic region or 
economic sector.”

similarly specified in EPA’s cement kiln dust 20 August 1999 proposed rule.55  This assumption was required to launch this RIA in April 2009 
prior to the initial draft of the CCR proposed rule and its regulatory options.  This RIA assumes that liners and leachate collection systems 
requirements apply only to future new CCR landfills and impoundments.  Offsite disposal costs are assumed unaffected under all regulatory 
options because offsite CCR disposal units are assumed to be commercially-owned units (i.e., owned by the waste management industry) and 
assumed currently in compliance with the custom-tailored engineering controls.  For engineering controls added to existing units the costs are 
added to the remaining years of the lifespan of the landfill or impoundment. 
 
1.  Regulatory groundwater monitoring cost 
Same cost estimation formula applied above in Chapter 3 for baseline cost estimation. 
 
2.  Regulatory bottom liner cost 
Same cost estimation formula applied above in Chapter 3 for baseline cost estimation. 
 
3.  Regulatory leachate collection cost 
Same cost estimation formula applied above in Chapter 3 for baseline cost estimation. 
 
4.  Regulatory fugitive dust control cost 
Same cost estimation formula applied above in Chapter 3 for baseline cost estimation. 
 
5.  Regulatory financial assurance cost 
Same cost estimation formula applied above in Chapter 3 for baseline cost estimation. 
 
6.  Regulatory closure costs 
Same cost estimation formula applied above in Chapter 3 for baseline cost estimation. 
 
7.  Regulatory disposal unit location restriction costs 
This cost element is estimated outside of the engineering controls cost model, using the factors, data and calculations below. 

•  Count of Existing Electric Plants Which May be Affected by Location Restrictions 

To estimate the potential cost of location restrictions, this RIA conducted a GIS analysis to determine which facilities may be affected by 
location restrictions.  As summarized below, the GIS analysis was conducted for three of the six possible site restrictions (i.e., using three GIS-
based datasets pertaining to fault areas, seismic zones, and karst zones readily available to EPA-ORCR at the 2009 launch of this RIA).  This 
limitation potentially results in under-estimation in this RIA of the number or electric utility plants which may be affected and thus under-
estimation of regulatory location restriction costs.  On the other hand, the average per-plant cost of $4.1 million applied below for estimating 
the potential cost of this regulatory element is over five-times higher than the $0.75 million56 cost per-plant cost estimated by another study for

location restriction mitigation involving karst mitigation and floodplain/wetland mitigation; this probably overly offsets the possible cost 
underestimation in this RIA for this regulatory element. 

The GIS was based on the DOE-EIA eGRID database to identify the geographic coordinates for 491 of the 495 electric utility plants 

(disregarding four plants not present in the eGRID database).  Appendix I of this RIA presents site location data for each electric utility plant 
used in the GIS analysis.  In order to geographically capture both the facilities and their waste units, and to compensate for the fact that there 
exists uncertainty as to the exact facility location versus the reported geographic coordinates (i.e., depending on whether location was measured 
by plant centroid, street address, smokestack, etc.), this GIS analysis used both a 1-mile and a 3-mile buffer around the reported facility 
coordinates.  This RIA presumes these buffers are likely to ensure inclusion of the facility's onsite CCR disposal units, and account for 
uncertainty in the location data.  The 1-mile buffer should capture all impoundments; the 3-mile buffer represents an upper-bound to capture all 
landfills that could reasonably be considered on-site. 
1. Water table restrictions: GIS analysis not conducted for this site restriction 
2. Floodplain restrictions: GIS analysis not conducted for this site restriction 
3. Wetlands restrictions: GIS analysis not conducted for this site restriction 
4. Fault area restrictions 
To identify fault zones, used the USGS database, “Quarternary Fault and Fold Database for the United States,” which contains national scale 
location data on faults and associated folds.57  This analysis identified plants including their buffers which fall within 200 feet of fault lines that 
have exhibited movement in the Holocene era.  The USGS dataset includes fault lines that are believed to have been a source of earthquakes 
greater than magnitude 6 during the Quarternary (the past 1,600,000 years) and it defines “Holocene” as the past 15 thousand years.58,59 

•  1-mile buffer: 1 plant falls within 200 feet of a fault line. 
•  3-mile buffer: 3 plants fall within 200 feet of a fault line. (these three plants are located in NV and UT). 

It is important to note that this preliminary analysis has certain limitations and may not capture facilities in other areas of seismic risk.  
According to the USGS fault line database, no relevant faults are located in the central and eastern US.  The USGS states in its database 
description that this absence of identified faults with movement in the central and eastern US is partly a real phenomena, because the western 
US has more tectonic activity, but that it is partly a detection problem caused by geological characteristics present in the central and eastern 
US, such as glacial sediments, that conceal evidence of movement along faults.  For this reason, the analysis of seismic zones below, which 
are defined based on the likelihood of future seismic activity, may represent a more reliable estimate of the number of facilities potentially 
affected by fault area restrictions.60 

                                                 
57 US Geological Survey, 2006, “Quarternary Fault and Fold Database for the United States”  at: http//earthquakes.usgs.gov/regional/qfaults. File used: fitarc.shp 
58 RCRA defines “Holocene” as “the most recent epoch of the Quarternary period, extending from the end of the Pleistocene to the present” (40 CFR 264.18(a)(2)(iii)). 
59 Faults designated by the dataset as showing movement during the Holocene are not necessarily believed to have produced an earthquake of magnitude 6 or greater during 
the Holocene.  Rather, they are believed to have produced an earthquake of magnitude 6 or greater during the Quarternary, but their most recent suspected movement of any 
degree was during the Holocene. 
60 The USGS data layer used for this analysis indicates that faults with Holocene movement are located only in states in the West and Southwest regions of the US.  This 
appears generally consistent with a separate analysis in the RCRA Practice Manual (Garrett, Theodore L., 2004, published by American Bar Association), and the small 
number of plants affected is not unexpected given the relatively small number of plants in these regions.  However, the RCRA Practice Manual also notes that virtually all 
plants in CA and NV, and in parts of AK, AZ, CO, HI, ID, MT, NM, UT, WA, WY would be located within 200 feet of relevant faults.  This suggests an upper bound of 54 
plants (out of the 491 plants analyzed), if all facilities in the identified states may be affected by fault area restrictions.

151 plants fall within seismic zones 
152 plants fall within seismic zones 

5. Seismic zone restrictions: 
To identify seismic zones, USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps provide peak horizontal acceleration at different probabilities of exceedance 
in 50 years.61  Identified those facilities, including their buffers, which overlap with the seismic impact zones that have a 10% or greater 
probability of exceeding a maximum horizontal acceleration of 10% the force of gravity (i.e., 0.10 g) in 250 years.62  The USGS data gives 
probabilities of exceedance over 50 years; thus used a data layer presenting 2% probability of exceedance, and assumed that this equates to a 
10% probability of exceedance in 250 years. 
•  1-mile buffer: 
•  3-mile buffer: 
6. Karst zone restrictions: 
This analysis used two databases: (1) DOE-EIA’s eGRID database to identify the geographic coordinates of 491 of the 495 plants analyzed 
(disregarding four plants that were not present in the eGRID database), and (2) the USGS's GIS database "Engineering Aspects of Karst," 
which provides national-scale data on karst coverage.63  Four types of karst areas are identified in the dataset: (a) long karst features (fissures, 
tubes, and caves over 1000 feet long and 250 feet deep); (b) short karst (fissures, tubes, and caves less than 1000 feet long and 50 feet deep), 
(c) areas where karst features are generally absent but present in small isolated areas, and (d) pseudo-karst areas, which have features 
analogous to karst. 
•  1-mile buffer:  138 plants fall within karst zones 
•  3-mile buffer:  177 plants fall within karst zones 
These counts do not distinguish between the four different types of karst terrain identified in the data set; this analysis represents an initial 
upper bound of potentially affected facilities. 

•  Potential Cost for Existing & New Electric Plants to Meet Disposal Unit Location Restrictions 

According to the above findings for the three location criteria evaluated in this RIA (i.e., fault areas, seismic zones, karst zones), a maximum 
count of 177 plants could be affected (this is the upper-end of the affected plant counts across the three location evaluations).  The potential 
cost to these plants of the location restrictions is estimated in this RIA using the cost to retro-fit existing CCR disposal units and to protect 
new CCR disposal units with a berm (aka levee).  A berm is a type of engineering measure which may serve to demonstrate that engineering 
measures have been incorporated into disposal unit design to mitigate the potential adverse impacts disposal units may have on, or be caused 
by, these six location considerations. 

The cost to construct a berm is based on the cost to construct a 10-foot tall flood berm using US Army Corps of Engineers’ publication 
“Flood Proofing – How to Evaluate Your Options,” (July 1993), which provides unit costs in 1993 dollars to construct clay core flood control 
levees that are two, four, and six-feet high.  This RIA inflated these unit costs to 2009 dollars using the ENR Construction Cost Index, and 
conducted a regression analysis on the unit costs (i.e., extrapolated the cost based on the implied cost curve of the smaller berms) to estimate 
the cost to construct a 10-foot tall berm.  The estimated cost per linear foot to construct a 10-foot tall berm is $375.  It is assumed that this unit 
cost could apply to both existing and new units, and that the berm would be constructed physically separate from the disposal unit, not 
integral as “freeboard” to the disposal unit’s structure.

62  This threshold for seismic impact zones is consistent with RCRA’s municipal solid waste landfill location restrictions (40 CFR 258.14(a)(b)(1)).

o  Impoundment berms:  The average surface impoundment size for existing units in the cost model is 343 acres. Assuming a 

square impoundment and that the berm would be constructed on three sides of the impoundment the average berm length is 11,594 
feet.  Therefore, the cost to construct a berm around an average-size impoundment is $4.3 million.64 

o  Landfill berms:  Similarly, the average landfill size for existing units in the cost model is 278 acres.  Assuming a square landfill 
and that the berm would be constructed on three sides of the landfill (leaving one side open for truck access), the average berm 
length is 10,447 feet, and the cost to construct a berm surrounding an average-size landfill is $3.9 million. 

Using the 3-mile buffer karst zone finding of 177 plants, the potential cost for constructing berms at those plants plus future plants is: 

o  Existing units: 
o  New units:  Apply 0.73% average annual growth rate in future CCR generation (cited elsewhere in this RIA) to estimate the count

$53 million/year equivalent 

 

 

of future new or expanded disposal units over 50-years, and assume 36% (i.e., 177/495) will need berms: 

 
For estimating most of the “Other Ancillary Costs” in this section, this RIA distinguishes between RCRA Subtitle C and RCRA Subtitle D 
requirements according to the respective basis of each regulatory option, as well as between costs to electric utility plants and costs to state 
government RCRA-authorized regulatory programs. 
                                                 
64 For purpose of comparison to the $4.3 million (per impoundment) and $3.9 million (per landfill) location restriction mitigation cost estimates above, in 2005 the TVA 
estimated an “assumed”  cost of $500,000 for karst mitigation and $250,000 for floodplain mitigation for a potential new CCR disposal site involving 1,300 linear feet for 
mitigation.  Extrapolation of TVA’s $750,000 cost estimate to 11,594 feet (impoundment) yields $6.7 million (i.e., (11,594 feet / 1,300 feet) x ($750,000)), and to 10,447 
feet (landfill) yields $6.0 million (i.e., 10,447 feet / 1,300 feet) x ($750,000)).  Source for TVA cost estimate: page 10 of “Kingston Fossil Plant Decision Matrix: Pond or

4B.2  Ancillary Regulatory Requirement Costs 

 
11.  Regulatory offsite disposal costs (hazmat trucking, RCRA manifests, RCRA TSDF permits for offsite) 
EPA assumed that Subtitle C options add extra cost to (a) truck hauling to offsite disposal, and (b) all offsite landfills must become RCRA 
Subtitle C permitted.  This cost estimate does not include taxes/trans-state government fees associated with off-site disposal. 
 

11a & 11b. Added truck hauling cost (Subtitle C options) 

Assumptions: 

•  Affects the 12% (15 million tons per year) annual CCR generation currently trucked offsite to non-haz LFs (2005) 
•  6 miles average one-way trucking distance to offsite LFs65 
•  $0.19/ton/mile hazardous waste truck operating cost 
•  12 tons CCR per full truckload (source: Gambrills MD case study); (15 million tons/year) / (12 tons/load) = 1.25 million 
truckloads per year 

Cost Calculations: 

•  11a. RCRA manifest cost: (1.25 million truckloads) x ($53 per manifest per load average cost from EPA 2007 ICR 801.15) = 
$66 million per year 
•  11b. Trucking cost (distance + operating cost): (15 million tons/year) x (6 miles) x ($0.09/ton/mile added truck operating cost 
for hazardous waste loads) = $8.1 million per year 
•  Subtotal (11a manifest + 11b trucking): $74.1 million per year 

 
11c. Added cost for RCRA Subtitle C permits for all offsite CCR landfills under Subtitle C 

Assumptions: 
•  Added operating cost to offsite CCR landfills for meeting engineering control requirements under each of the regulatory options 

evaluated in this RIA are included in the “Engineering Control Costs” section above, so are not again calculated here to avoid 
double-counting.  Only the paperwork burden cost for obtaining a RCRA permit is estimated here. 

•  Industry average cost per waste disposal permit:

12.  Regulatory structural integrity inspection cost 

•  Assumptions: 

EPA assumed that the residual 18% of the non-inspected plants require inspection over the 82% baseline inspection coverage. 
The per-plant cost for inspections is estimated in the Chapter 3 baseline above. 

•  Cost Calculation: 

Industry cost: ($10,829/year per facility) x (18% not inspected) x (495 plants) = $0.96 million per year 
State government cost: ($599/year per facility) x (18% not inspected) x (495 plants) = $0.054 million per year 

•  State government average cost per waste disposal permit: 

Average cost for state government review of RCRA Subtitle C permits consists of four activities:68 
(1,215 pre-application activities) + ($27,063 application review) + ($26,846 permit issuance) + ($3,110 permit maintenance) = 
$58,200 per permit 

(149 offsite CCR landfills) x ($58,200 per Subtitle C permit) = $8.67 million 
Amortized state cost with a capital recovery factor of 0.07246 (@7% discount rate & 50-years) = $0.63 million/year 

 
 

•  Total Subtitle C permit cost (industry + state government) = $2.9 million per year 

 
 

 

Total (industry + state) = $1.01 million per year 

 
13.  Regulatory RCRA facility-wide investigation (RFI) cost 

Industry RFI cost: 

• 
•  As of 2008, state government corrective action covers 64% of electric utility industry impoundments and 78% of landfills.  Thus, 
assume that 57 plants with impoundments (i.e., 36% x 158 plants with impoundments) plus 74 plants with landfills (i.e., 22% x 337 plants 
with landfills) may require RFIs, for a total of 131 RFIs. 
•  The purpose of an RFI is to obtain information to fully characterize the nature, extent and rate of migration of releases of hazardous 
waste or constituents to determine whether interim corrective measures and/or a Corrective Measures Study may be necessary for other 
waste units at the facility (source: EPA 530/SW-89-031, May 1989, Vol.I).  RFIs may include: rapid field screening using portable field 
instruments, drilling in soils, excavating test pits, ground-water monitoring, waste testing, biomonitoring, and site surveying, site 
photography, site mapping. 
•  RFI average cost: 

$0.75 million average cost for RFIs involving captive industrial landfills

14.  Regulatory RCRA facility-wide corrective action cost 
Average annualized future potential cost was not estimated in this RIA because of a high degree of uncertainty.  Through a process called 
corrective action, RCRA Subtitle C requires RCRA-regulated facilities to investigate and clean-up releases of hazardous wastes or constituents 
to the environment identified in the RCRA facility-wide investigation (RFI).  After the RFI, if the need for cleanup is discovered, the RCRA-
regulated facility must perform a “Corrective Measures Study” (CMS) which may range in cost from $100,000 to $800,000 for such a study.70  
State government cost for corrective measures study & corrective action review, approval, oversight is $117,300 per case.71  The purpose of a 
CMS is to develop and evaluate the corrective action alternative(s) and to recommend the corrective measure(s) be taken at the facility.72 

As of 2008 the RCRA corrective action universe is about 3,800 sites nationwide.73  Relative to the RCRA-regulated universe of 

217,500 facilities (consisting of about 16,000 hazardous waste LQG “large quantity generators” plus about 200,000 hazardous waste SQG 
“small quantity generators” plus about 1,500 hazardous waste TSDF “treatment, storage, disposal facilities” as of 2008), the 3,800 corrective 
action universe implies a 1.75% relative incidence of occurrence (i.e., 3,800 / 217,500 = 1.75%).  Corrective action costs vary from facility-to-
facility depending on the number and types of waste management units and other industrial equipment/processes and wastes involved.  The

corrective action remedies usually involve mitigating damages to surface water and groundwater.  The General Accountability Office (GAO) 
reported74 that RCRA corrective action could cost 3,698 non-Federal hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities a total of about 
$16 billion (1996$) to clean up their properties contaminated by hazardous substances, representing an average $4.327 million corrective action 
cost per-facility.  Updated75 to 2009$ implies an average of $5.365 million RCRA corrective action cost per facility. 
 
15.  Regulatory RCRA TSDF waste disposal permit cost for onsite disposal 
RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste regulations require hazardous waste treatment, storage, disposal facilities (TSDFs) to obtain RCRA permits 
as described in 40 CFR 270 consisting of a two-part (i.e., Part A and Part B) application process.  The paperwork burden cost of this 
requirement is estimated below.  Furthermore, but not included in the cost estimate below, are separate, additional RCRA regulations 
containing “technical requirements” used by permit issuing authorities (e.g., RCRA-authorized state government waste programs or EPA 
Regional offices) to determine what technical requirements must be placed in permits.  The separate cost of technical requirements is estimated 
in the “Engineering Controls” regulatory cost section of this RIA above. 

•  Assumptions: 

o  Although 93% of CCR landfills have a state government non-hazardous waste disposal permit and 12% of CCR impoundments 
o  383 of the 495 total electric utility plants currently dispose onsite (i.e., 84 of the 495 plants solely dispose CCR offsite, plus 28 

have such state permits, assume CCR disposal units will need new RCRA disposal permits under Subtitle C options. 

plants solely supply CCR for beneficial uses). 

• 

Industry average cost per waste disposal permit: 

 

 

•  State government average cost per waste disposal permit: 

o  ($44076 average RCRA Part A permit application cost per-plant per-year) + ($68,96077 average RCRA Part B application cost 

per-facility per-year) = $69,400 per Subtitle C permit per year 
($69,400 per permit per year) x (3 years ICR annualization period) = $208,200 per permit 
(383 plants) x ($208,200 per permit) = $79.74 million 
Amortized industry cost with a capital recovery factor of 0.07246 (@7% discount rate & 50-years) = $5.8 million/year 

o  Build estimate based on the following four RCRA Subtitle C permit-related state government activities associated with RCRA 

Subtitle C waste disposal permits:78 
(1,215 pre-application activities) + ($27,063 application review) + ($26,846 permit issuance) + ($3,110 permit maintenance) = 
$58,200 average cost per Subtitle C waste disposal permit per year.

o  State Cost Calculation: 

 

 

(383 electricity plants dispose CCR onsite) x ($58,200 per Subtitle C permit per year) = $22.3 million per year 

•  Total Subtitle C permit cost (industry + state government) = $28.1 million per year 

 
16.  Regulatory RCRA enforcement inspection cost 

•  Assumptions: 

o  State government average cost = $7,900 per Subtitle C inspection (source: hazardous waste LQG large quantity generator 
average calculated by dividing the $1,517,357 annual enforcement inspection cost to 10 surveyed state governments by 192 
annual enforcement cases, from page 87 of the January 2007 ASTSWMO report “State RCRA Subtitle C Core Hazardous Waste 
Management Program Implementation Costs Final Report” 

o  1.6% average annual enforcement inspection frequency based on dividing the 11,965 LQG “large quantity generator” universe 

reported by 10 survey states by the 192 hazardous waste LQG enforcement cases reported in the January 2007 ASTSWMO 
report “State RCRA Subtitle C Core Hazardous Waste Management Program Implementation Costs Final Report” 

•  Cost calculation: 

($7,900 per LQG enforcement) x (495 electric utility plants) x (1.6% LQG enforcements annually) = $0.063 million per year 

 
17.  Regulatory future remediation added cost 
Potential $18.5 million to $376 million per case in added cleanup cost for future surface impoundment failures, if regulated under RCRA 
Subtitle C rather than Subtitle D, is based on the two example case studies summarized in Exhibit 4A below.

Baseline Cost Calculations: 

$15 million 

•  Trucking cost: (3.32 million tons) x (45 miles) x ($0.10/ton /mile) = 

per load) 

•  LF tipping fee: ($35/ton) x (3.32 million tons) = $116 million 
•  Manifest: $0 
•  Case #1 total = $131 million for event 

If cleanup as RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste 
Assumptions: 

•  3.32 million tons released

•  $80/ton Subtitle C tipping fee (source: TVA) 
•  154,000 truckloads (source: TVA assumes 21.6 tons ash per load) 

Cost Calculations: 

•  Trucking cost: (3.32 million tons) x (370 miles) x ($0.19/ton/mile 

truck operating cost) = $233 million 

•  LF tipping fee: ($80/ton) x (3.32 million tons) = $266 million 
•  Manifest: (154,000 truckloads) x ($53 manifest cost per load) = $8

Case Study #2: 

Constellation Energy Gambrills MD (2008) 

If cleanup as non-hazardous waste:  
Baseline Assumptions: 

•  0.25 million tons released 
•  $0.10/ton/mile truck operating cost (source: OSW-EMRAD) 
•  193 miles to Subtitle D LF (Constellation Energy’s mileage estimate

•  $35/ton tipping fee (source: 2005 Chartwell) 
•  20,833 truckloads (source: Constellation Energy assumes 12 tons ash 

 Baseline Cost Calculations:

•  Trucking cost: (0.25 million tons released) x (193 miles) x ($0.10/ton 

•  LF tipping fee: ($35/ton) x (0.25 million.tons) = $9 million 
•  Manifest: $0 

Case #2 total = $14 million for event 
If cleanup as RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste 
Assumptions: 

•  0.25 million tons released 
•  $0.19/ton/mile truck operating cost (from TVA) 
•  179 miles to Subtitle C LF (closest is Envirosafe OH with 0.9 million 

tons permitted capacity) 

•  $90/ton tipping fee (2004 ETC national median fee) 
•  20,833 truckloads (source: Constellation Energy assumes 12 tons ash 

per load) 

Cost Calculations: 

•  Trucking cost: (0.25 million tons) x (179 miles) x ($0.19/ton/mile 

truck operating cost) = $8.5 million 

•  LF tipping fee: ($90/ton) x (0.25 million tons) = $23 million 
•  Manifest: (20,833 truckloads) x ($53 manifest cost per load) = $1

•  Case #2 total = $32.5 million for event 

Case #2 incremental cost over non-hazardous: 

$18.5 million for cleanup event

18.  EPA administrative reporting and recordkeeping costs 
Three of the regulatory costs itemized above -- item 11 offsite disposal truck manifesting and offsite disposal hazardous waste permits, item 12 
structural integrity inspections, and item 13 RCRA facility-wide investigation (RFI) – include the cost of paperwork burden for those items.  In 
addition, certain features of the Subtitle C options of the proposed rule require four other paperwork burden activities: 
 
18a. Notice of Regulated Waste Activity & EPA ID Number                                                                                                                                                       
RCRA Subtitle C regulations for hazardous waste “generators” require generators to notify their facilities as such and obtain EPA identification 
numbers (40 CFR 262.12).  According to EPA’s most recent (2009) estimate, the average per-facility response burden is $162 per facility.79  
Applied to the 495 electric utility plants yields an estimated one-time notification cost of $80,190 (i.e., (495 electric utility plants) x ($162 per 
notification)).  Amortized with a capital recovery factor of 0.07246 (@7% discount rate & 50-years) = $5,800 per year average annual 
equivalent. 

o  Industry share of cost: 
(86%) x ($5,800/year) = $5,000/year 
o  State government share of cost:  (14%) x ($5,800/year) = $800/year 

 

 
18b. General Facility Standards for Hazardous Waste TSDFs 
This cost item represents a set of paperwork burden activities grouped under 40 CFR 264/265 Subpart B (i.e., 264.10 to 264.19 and 265.10 to 
265.19) and includes (1) maintaining records for hazardous waste that is stored, treated, and/or disposed onsite, (2) descriptions of location, 
design, construction, operating methods, techniques, and practices for onsite hazardous waste storage, treatment, and/or disposal, (3) 
contingency plans for unanticipated damages from hazardous waste onsite storage, treatment and/or disposal, (4) maintaining qualifications of 
facility ownership, (5) maintaining continuity and financial responsibility of facility operation, and (6) employee hazardous waste training.  
According to EPA’s most recent (2009) estimate the average per-facility paperwork burden is $27,350 per facility per year.80  Applied to the 
383 electric utility plants which currently dispose onsite (i.e., 84 of the 495 plants solely dispose CCR offsite with other companies, plus 28 
plants solely provide CCR for beneficial uses) yields an estimated cost of ($27,350 per facility pre year) x (383 plants which dispose CCR) = 
$10.48 million/year: 

o  Industry share of cost: 
(86%) x ($10.48 million/year) = $9.01 million/year 
o  State government share of cost:  (14%) x ($10.48 million/year) = $1.47 million/year 

 

 
18c. RCRA Hazardous Waste Biennial Report 
RCRA Subtitle C requires hazardous waste LQG large quantity generators (40 CFR 262.41) and hazardous waste TSDF treatment, storage, and 
disposal facilities (40 CFR 264.75 and 265.75) to submit “Hazardous Waste Report” information on a 2-year repeating cycle (aka “RCRA

Biennial Report”).  According to EPA’s most recent (2009) estimate, the average annualized per-facility response burden is $3,410 per year.81  
Extrapolated to 495 electric utility plants produces a cost estimate of $1.69 million per year. 

o  Industry share of cost: 
(86%) x ($1.69 million/year) = $1.45 million/year 
o  State government share of cost:  (14%) x ($1.69 million/year) = $0.24 million/year 

 

 
18d. CERCLA Reportable Quantity (RQ) Spill/Leak Reporting 
Section 103(a) of CERCLA requires facilities and vessels to immediately notify the National Response Center (NRC) of a hazardous substance 
release (e.g., spill, leak) into the environment if the amount of the release equals or exceeds the substance’s reportable quantity (RQ) limit.  In 
general there are five RQ categories (1, 10, 100, 1,000 or 5,000 pounds).  Subtitle C options may add CCR to the CERCLA list of hazardous 
substances and assign an RQ of one-pound, as well as allowing the use of concentrations to determine RQ thus resulting in a range of 1,294 
pounds to 10,000,000 pounds for 12 chemicals.  Using the total count of facilities (i.e., establishments) in the US manufacturing sector (NAICS 
31, 32, 33) plus the US waste management sector (NAICS 562) as rough indicators, there are 315,000 industrial facilities in the US which may 
handle RQ-listed hazardous substances.82  According to EPA’s most recent (2007) estimate, the average per-facility response burden is $122 
(i.e., 4.1 burden hours) per facility per response, based on an average annual 25,861 facilities at an annual paperwork burden cost of $3.161 
million.83  Relative to this 300,000 industrial facility universe, this annual count of RQ-reporting facilities represents an 8% fraction.  
Extrapolated to the 495 electric utility plants yields a rough estimate of 40 possible RQ reports per year, at a cost of $4,900 per year (i.e., (495 
electric utility plants) x (8% RQ reports per year) x ($122 per RQ report)). 

o  Industry share of cost: 
(86%) x ($4,900/year) = $4,200/year 
o  State government share of cost:  (14%) x ($4,900/year) = $700/year 

 

 
Sub-total cost item 17 (17a + 17b + 17c + 17d) = $12.94 million per year. 

o  Industry share of cost: 
(86%) x ($12.94 million/year) = $11.13 million/year 
o  State government share of cost:  (14%) x ($12.94 million/year) = $1.81 million/year

4B.3  Land Disposal Restriction Cost (for dewatering treatment of CCR) 

 
This element consists of two components: 
•  Dry CCR disposal (landfills): Moisture conditioning and compaction to 95% maximum dry density value according to ASTM D 698 or 

ASTM D 1557 test methods prior to disposal in landfills. 

•  Wet CCR disposal (impoundments): Dewatering to remove solids prior to disposal in impoundments within 5-years of rule’s effective date.  

The potential cost for this treatment standard is estimated below. 

 
However, only the potential cost for the wet CCR disposal dewatering treatment standard is estimated in this section of the RIA because the 
potential cost for meeting the dry CCR moisture conditioning and compaction requirements are already estimated in item 4 of the “engineering 
controls” in this chapter above: 
 

•  Examples of CCR Dewatering Methods 

 
Based on the following recent (1997-2009) example descriptions of dry CCR disposal practices at existing or planned coal-fired electric utility 
plants, dry CCR disposal may involve different methods for any given plant: 

1.  Tanks & chain drag:  As described in March 2009 by the Basin Electric Power Cooperative.84  Bottom ash will be dewatered in tanks 
and the water will be re-circulated to transport additional bottom ash.  Bottom ash will be removed using a chain drag.  The ash will 
then be hauled by truck to a lined landfill offsite.  The fly ash will be conveyed in a dry state. Both ashes will be disposed in a landfill 
close to the plant site. 

2.  Pressure squeeze conveyor: Another tank-based example apparently similar to the Basin Cooperative method is reported for dry 

disposal conversion by the coal mining industry, involving the Phoenix Process Equipment company supplier of alternative slurry 
processing equipment.  This second example involves a thickening tank, porous conveyor belt and pressure to squeeze water out of the 
coal washings, producing a semi-solid, 75% dewatered cake which is scraped off the conveyor belt and stacked like a pile of sand.  The 
cost for this process is reported at $0.50 per ton of coal waste processed.85 

3.  Horizontal belt filters: According to a May 2009 technical paper86, dewatering gypsum using horizontal belt filters is common in the 

electric utility industry, and a new modified horizontal belt filter method involving two feedboxes allows fly ash and FGD (gypsum) to 
be dewatered simultaneously. 

4.  Storage silos & rail system: As described June 200987 for a $10 million conversion project located at Detroit Edison’s Monroe 

Michigan Power Plant -- a four boiler unit, 3,200-megawatt power station originally constructed in 1974.  Installation of equipment to 
collect the coal ash in a dry state, plus dry ash storage facilities (storage silos), and truck/rail loading equipment for distribution of the 
dry ash to concrete producers in the Midwest United States and Eastern Canada.

about the 1997 dry fly ash system conversion of Northern Indiana Public Service Company’s Michigan City Plant. 

 
For this RIA, EPA ORCR identified four alternative existing studies with cost estimates (dated 1981, 1985, 2005, and 2009) comparing dry and 
wet CCR disposal at coal-fired electric utility plants.  The first three studies provided cost estimates on a per-plant basis, whereas the 2009 
study provided an extrapolated nationwide cost estimate.  However, only the 2005 study is used in this RIA as a basis for deriving a cost 
estimate for the wet CCR dewatering land disposal treatment, because the first two studies are over 25-years old (1981 and 1985), and the 2009 
study does not provide sufficient details for verification of data and calculations.  These three other studies are summarized below in this 
chapter to illustrate the magnitude of cost estimation uncertainty implied by the other studies, compared to the estimate derived below in this 
section of the RIA. 
 

•  Summary of 2005 TVA CCR Dry Disposal Cost Study 

•  In August 2009 TVA announced a proposed plan to convert its wet CCR disposal to dry disposal.  TVA’s CEO Tom Kilgore said before a 

28 July 2009 US Congressional subcommittee hearing that TVA has developed a 5-year plan to shift CCR disposal from wet 
impoundments to dry landfills.  TVA estimated it will cost between $1.5 billion to $2 billion over 8 to 10 years for its 11 coal-fired electric 
utility plants.89  Detailed or semi-detailed calculations of TVA’s 2009 cost estimate are not available for this RIA to use for extrapolation 
nationwide. 

•  However, a 2005 TVA cost estimate titled “Kingston Fossil Plant Decision Matrix: Pond or Peninsula?” provides detailed cost estimates for 

dry conversion of the TVA Kingston TN plant.90  The TVA cost study involves conversion of an existing impoundment currently used to 
dispose wet fly ash and wet bottom ash at the TVA Kingston TN electric utility plant, for future dry fly ash and dry bottom ash disposal.  
The FGD stream remains wet-sluiced before and after this hypothetical conversion in the cost study.  In addition to the cost of converting 
the electric plant boilers and the impoundment for dry ash disposal, the cost study also includes the cost for construction of a new storm 
water runoff management pond (Source: row item 68 of TVA’s “Appendix C Detailed Cost Sheets”, slide nr. TVA-00007403). 

•  TVA cost study involves conversion of 475,600 cubic yards of fly ash plus bottom ash per year; this RIA estimates this quantity is 

equivalent to 880,000 tons per year, assuming 1.85 tons per cubic yard multiplier.91

91 "Source: 1.85 tons per cubic yard multiplier represents the midpoint from the following 1.2 to 2.5 range:  According to EPA’s 1988 Report to Congress (“Wastes from the 
Combustion of Coal by Electric Utility Power Plants,”  page 3-14), the dry density of fly ash is 80-90 lbs/cubic ft which translates to a specific density of 1.4.  The Federal 
Highway Administration studied fly ash for use in highway construction and reported its specific gravity may be as low as 1.7 to as high as 3.0.  Conversion of this implied 
1.4 to 3.0 range in fly ash specific gravities to tons-per-cubic-yard as follows: 

(1.4 g/cm3) / (0.000001 m3/cm3) x (0.764 m3/yd3) / (1000 g/kg) x (2.204 lbs/kg) / (2000 lbs/short ton) = 1.2 short tons per cubic yard. 
(3.0 g/cm3) / (0.000001 m3/cm3) x (0.764 m3/yd3) / (1000 g/kg) x (2.204 lbs/kg) / (2000 lbs/short ton) = 2.5 short tons per cubic yard.

84 

•  The TVA cost study did not estimate the cost for dewatering FGD (gypsum) because FGD is already dewatered by most electric utility 

plants for beneficial uses, thus only four of the 495 electric utility plants (i.e., TVA Widows Creek plant, TVA Paradise plant, Louisville 
Gas & Electric Co Trimble County plant, and Northern Indiana Public Service Company R.M. Schafer plant) wet dispose 1.9 million tons 
FGD per year in impoundments as of 2005 (source: column B of Exhibit 3G of this RIA). 

•  Unit cost (i.e., average cost per ton) of conversion from wet to dry disposal estimated from the 2005 TVA cost analysis which provides cost 

estimates for converting from wet ash disposal to dry ash disposal: 

o  Capital cost 
 
o  Annual O&M cost  

TVA wet disposal 
$13.12 million PV 
$10.63 million PV 

TVA dry disposal 
$38.45 million PV  Cost not incremental  $43.7/ton per year (@20 years) 
$17.51 million PV 

Added cost for dry  Unitized dry cost 

$0.60/ton (@13 years) 

$6.88 million PV 

(Note: PV = present value for TVA’s 25-year period of analysis 2005-2029; TVA costs are in 2005$ prices) 

•  Cost estimate calculation under conversion to dry disposal scenario, calculated based on TVA’s per-ton cost extrapolation to 22.4 million 

tons per year baseline wet CCR (i.e., wet fly ash, wet bottom ash, wet FGD, wet gypsum, wet other CCR) disposal in impoundments at 158 
of the 495 electric utility plants: 
o  Capital cost: (22.4 million tons per year wet CCR disposal for conversion at 158 plants) x ($43.7/ton per year conversion capital 
cost) x (20 years capitalization period) x (1.174 price update multiplier92 to 2009$ price level) = $22,984 million undiscounted 
capital cost 
Annual equivalent capital: ($22,984 million) x (0.07246 capital recovery factor @7% & 50-years) = $1,665 million per year 
o  O&M cost: ($0.60/ton conversion O&M cost) x (22.4 million tons/year wet CCR disposal for conversion at 158 plants) x (45 
years future operational period 2017-2061 which assumed to begin 5 years after 2012 final rule promulgation) x (1.174 price 
update multiplier to 2009$ price level) = $710 million undiscounted total O&M 
PV present value discounted @7% over 50-years = $153 million PV present value O&M 
Annual equivalent O&M: ($153 million) x (0.07246 capital recovery factor @7% & 50-years) = $11 million per year 

o  Total annualized cost (capital + O&M) = ($1,665 million/year capital) + ($11 million/year O&M) = $1,676 million/year 

 

 

 
 

•  Uncertainty in Land Disposal Treatment Cost Estimate 

 
In addition to the 2005 Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) cost study referenced above, there are three other related cost studies (1981, 1985, 
and 2009) which are summarized below.  The first two studies provide cost estimates on a per-plant basis for a few plant sizes, and the 2009 
study provides a nationwide cost estimate.  This RIA did not apply these other studies because the first two are over 25-years old (i.e., 1981 and 
1985) and the third study does not provide sufficient details for verification of data and calculations.  These studies are summarized below and 
used as a basis for formulating alternative nationwide cost estimates for land disposal treatment, for the purpose of illustrating the potential 
magnitude of uncertainty in this RIA’s cost estimate in relation to these other studies.

•  Study #1 of 3: 

1981 TVA/EPA 

 
•  In January 1981, TVA’s Energy Demonstrations and Technology Office (Chattanooga TN) co-authored with EPA’s Industrial 

Environmental Research Laboratory (Research Triangle Park NC) a study titled “Economic Analysis of Wet Versus Dry Ash Disposal 
Systems,” Interagency Energy/Environment R&D Program Report, report no. TVA/OP/EDT-81/30 and EPA-600-7-81-013, 126 pages.93 

•  The study compares the relative costs of wet and dry methods of coal ash disposal for five electric plant power size categories (300 MW, 600 

MW, 900 MW, 1,300 MW, 2,600 MW) with annual coal ash generation ranging from 0.2 million to 1.7 million per year per plant. 

•  Per-plant capital and O&M costs estimated based on 35-year assumed plant lifespan in 1980$.  Capital costs for (a) in-plant coal ash 

handling systems, (b) conveyance/transport, and disposal units, were obtained from equipment suppliers. 

•  The study found (page 67) there is not a significant difference in ash system economics based on the method of analysis.  Present worth 

analysis “indicates that wet disposal is typically the least cost alternative.  However, various dry disposal options are within a 15 percent 
range of those costs.  The costs are, in fact, sensitive to spreading the dry disposal area capital costs over the life of the power station and 
the in-plant handling system cost.  Use of either the lower dilute phase transport system cost or the dense phase collection system cost results 
in the dry disposal system alternative become the least cost alternative.”  

•  The study also noted that staged construction may provide 30% saving in system total cost: “[T]he above analyses assumed construction of 
all the required facilities upon start-up.  In the case of dry disposal, this is a reasonable assumption although site preparation costs would 
proceed during the development of the site.  In the case of wet disposal, it may be economically sound to construct the embankment in stages, 
even if the amount of material to be placed or the engineering estimate is higher for staged construction.  This is due to the high cost of the 
dam or levee and the cost of money over the life of the project.  As an example… wet disposal area was analyzed for all construction 
occurring in 1980 and by a staged construction sequence (3 stages).  In this case, staged construction provided a 30 percent savings in the 
total cost of the system.” 

•  The 1981 study used two cost methods.  The “Present Worth” (aka present value PV) cost method findings (page 62) indicated the following 

comparative ranges in wet dry versus wet disposal costs: 

 

 

Disposal method

•  Using the EPA ORCR 2009$ updated unit cost midpoints displayed above yields the following rough cost estimate for the 158 electric 

utility plants with CCR impoundments: 

o  Capital cost: (22.4 million tons per year wet CCR disposal for conversion at 158 plants) x ($4.81 to $9.87 per ton dry disposal 

unitized present value cost) x (40.6% capital cost fraction) x (50 years period-of-analysis for this RIA) = $2,187 million to 
$4,488 million present value capital cost 
Annualized capital cost: ($2,187 million to $4,488 million) x (0.07246 capital recovery factor @7% & 50-years) = $158.5 
million to $325.2 million per year 

o  O&M cost95: (22.4 million tons per year wet CCR disposal for conversion at 158 plants) x [(($4.81 to $9.87 per ton dry disposal 
unitized present value cost) x (59.4% dry O&M fraction)) – (($4.08 to $12.46 per ton wet disposal unitized present value cost) x 
(31.6% wet O&M fraction))] x (45 years dry disposal operational period 2017-2061 which assumed to begin 5 years after 2012 
final rule promulgation) = $1,580.5 million to $1,941.4 million present value O&M 
Annualized O&M cost: ($1,580.5 million to $1,941.4 million) x (0.07246 capital recovery factor @7% & 50-years) = $114.5 
million to $140.7 million per year 

o  Total annualized cost (capital + O&M) = ($158.5 million to $325.2 million per year capital) + ($114.5 million to $140.7 million 

per year O&M) = $273 million to $466 million per year 

 

•  Study #2 of 3: 

1985 EPA 

 
•  EPA’s Air and Energy Engineering Research Laboratory (Research Triangle Park NC) published cost estimates for both wet and dry CCR 

disposal at coal-fired electric utility plants in the report “Full-Scale Field Evaluation of Waste Disposal from Coal-Fired Electric Generating 
Plants”, document nr. EPA/600/S7-85/028, August 1985, 12 pages.96 

•  This is a 3-year study of waste characterization, environmental data, engineering, and cost evaluations associated with disposal of coal ash 

and FGD waste by six coal-fired electricity plants ranging in nameplate capacity between 310 to 1,786 megawatts and located in FL, IL, MN, 
NC, PA, and WY.  EPA used this study to assist preparation of EPA’s 1988 “Report to Congress on Wastes from the Combustion of Coal by 
Electric Utility Power Plants” (report no. EPA530-SW-88-002, Feb 1988). 

•  This study developed “generic” capital and annual O&M costs for both wet CCR pond disposal and dry CCR landfill disposal methods 

involving fly ash, bottom ash, and FGD, based on specific costs for the six sites combined with cost estimates from other studies by TVA, 

                                                 
95 O&M cost extrapolation calculation in this RIA for the 1981 study applies two different O&M cost percentages based on the study’s 59.4% dry disposal O&M cost 
percentage derived from page B-10, and on the study’s 31.6% wet disposal O&M cost percentage derived from page C-11.

EPRI, and other organizations.  Exhibit 4C below displays the unitized capital costs and Exhibit 4D below displays the unitized O&M costs 
from the study updated for this RIA to 2009 price level. 

•  Using the 2009-updated mean unit capital and O&M cost estimates displayed in Exhibit 4C and Exhibit 4D, provides the following cost 

estimates for conversion to dry disposal, based on extrapolation to 22.4 million tons per year baseline wet CCR (i.e., wet fly ash, wet bottom 
ash, wet FGD, wet gypsum, wet other CCR) disposal in impoundments at 158 of the 495 electric utility plants which have a subtotal of 
180,901 MW nameplate total capacity: 

o  Capital cost: (180,901,000 kilowatt capacity for 158 electric utility plants with surface impoundments) x ($37.60 dry conversion 

capital cost per kilowatt capacity from Exhibit 4C) = $6,810 million capital cost 

Annual equivalent cost: ($6,810 million) x (0.07246 capital recovery factor @7% & 50-years) = $494 million/year 

o  O&M cost: (22.4 million tons per year wet CCR disposed in impoundments) x (-$17.40 cost savings per ton to manage for dry 
o  Total average annualized cost (capital + O&M) = ($494 million/year capital cost) – ($389 million/year O&M cost savings) = 

disposal from Exhibit 4D) = -$389 million per year O&M cost savings. 

$105 million per year dry conversion cost.

•  Study #3 of 3: 

2009 USWAG 

•  On 11 June 2009 the Utility Solid Waste Action Group (Jim Roewer, Executive Director) provided to EPA a 14-page cost study USWAG 

sponsored by the EOP Group Inc., containing an estimate of $39,000 million present value (PV) for conversion to dry disposal: “Cost 
Estimates for Closure of Ash Ponds at Fossil Fuel Power Generation Facilities”, prepared in 2009 by EOP Group Inc.  USWAG/EOP’s 
$39,000 million PV estimate uses a 3% discount rate over 20 years with a 10-year implementation period, and consists of: 

o  $12,900 million PV (33%) for fly ash and bottom ash conversion to dry disposal 
o  $2,500 million PV (6%) for foregone sunk cost in ponds 
o  $23,700 million PV (61%) for construction of new wastewater plants for other non-ash ancillary wastewaters (e.g., stormwater) 

which are currently co-mingled with the wet ash. 

•  For purpose of comparing this estimate with the other two cost studies above, the following rough calculations extend the O&M costs from 

the 20-year period from the USWAG/EOP study, to the 50-year period applied in this RIA: 

o  Dry management O&M cost = ($2.00 per ton higher cost than wet management) x (20.6 million tons per year in 

impoundments) x (40-years after 10-year impoundment phase-out) = $1,648 million (undiscounted). 

PV discounted @7% over 50-years = $279 million PV present value 

o  Waste water treatment plant (WWTP) O&M cost = ($525 million per year) x (40-years after 10-year impoundment phase-out) 

= $21,000 million (undiscounted). 

PV discounted @7% over 50-years = $3,558 million PV present value 

•  Substituting these 50-year based PV O&M cost estimates for the 20-year based PV O&M cost estimates into the USWAG/EOP 

$39,000 million 20-year PV total cost estimate produces the following 50-year based average annualized cost: 

o  Capital cost:($39,000 million PV total cost) – ($400 million 20-year PV dry management O&M) – ($5,200 million 20-year PV 

WWTP O&M) = $33,400 million PV capital cost 

Annual equivalent capital cost: ($33,400 million PV) x (0.07246 capital recovery factor @7% & 50-years) = $2,420 million per 
year annualized capital cost 
o  O&M cost: ($279 million 50-year PV dry management O&M) + ($3,558 million 50-year PV WWTP O&M) = $3,837 million 

PV present value O&M 

Annualized O&M cost: ($3,837 million PV) x (0.07246 capital recovery factor @7% & 50-years) = $278 million per year O&M 
o  Total annualized cost (capital + O&M) = $2,698 million per year 

 
Exhibit 4E below presents a summary of the extrapolated cost estimates based on the per-plant cost findings from these three alternative cost 
studies, compared to the cost estimate based on the 2005 TVA cost study applied in this RIA.

•  Update of Cost Estimate for Converting from Wet to Dry CCR Disposal 

o  Purpose of Dry Conversion Cost Estimate Update 

 
The purpose of this section is to update the initial estimate above in this RIA, of the cost of converting CCR disposal impoundments to dry 
disposal (i.e., landfills).  The initial $23.137 billion estimate (present value discounted at 7% over 50-years) presented in above in this section 
of the RIA is based on the 2005 universe of 158 coal-fired electric utility plants (classified in NAICS code 22) with active CCR impoundments 
addressed in EPA’s October 2009 draft RIA for the proposed rule.  Exhibit 4F below provides a summary of this initial cost estimate.97  As of 
February 2010, the 2005 universe is the latest available data from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) 
Form 767 database, because the EIA temporarily suspended its electric utility industry data collection survey questionnaire to revise it. 

                                                 
97 EPA’s 2009 draft RIA cost estimate was based on an extrapolation of a cost estimate developed in 2005 by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for converting its 
Kingston TN coal-fired electric plant to dry disposal of fly ash and bottom ash.  In the RIA, EPA (a) unitized TVA’s cost estimate on a cost-per-ton basis for both the 
capital cost and annual O&M cost components, and then (b) extrapolated the unit costs to the 2005 national universe of 22.4 million tons wet disposed CCR associated with 
the 158 electric utility plants with active CCR impoundments as of 2005.  Exhibit 4F below displays how the draft RIA timed the capital and O&M costs over the 50-year 
period of analysis applied in the RIA (2012 to 2061), and the result of discounting the 50-year cost stream at a 7% annual rate.

o  Recent Trend in CCR Impoundment Phase-Outs 

 
Since formulating the initial cost estimate above, EPA obtained new information which indicates that many electric utility plants have already 
closed or are planning to close CCR impoundments and convert to dry disposal (i.e., landfill disposal and/or sell and transport dry CCR offsite 
for beneficial use by other industries) for reasons independent of the CCR proposed rule.  As displayed below in Exhibit 4G, EIA’s historical 
data98 for the electric utility industry indicate that between 1996 and 2005, the tonnage of CCR disposed in impoundments has decreased by 
10% from 25.2 to 22.5 million tons despite total CCR generation at electric utility plants increasing 24% over that same period from 102.0 
million tons (1996) to 126.3 million tons (2005).  This represents an average annual CCR impoundment phase-out rate of 1.1% per year.

One important reason for this change is that dry systems allow plants more flexibility in the type of coal they use as fuel.  For example, as 
plants switched from bituminous to sub-bituminous coal, they also converted to dry fly ash handling systems because the ash from some sub-
bituminous coals has cementitious properties that can cause plugging and high maintenance costs for some wet ash disposal systems, thus 
necessitating dry ash systems.  Also, some types of sub-bituminous coal fly ash are in economic demand by the cement industry because of 
their low carbon content and need to be stored dry for transport.  EIA’s historical data for coal-fired electric plant fly ash disposal confirms this 
same trend away from wet disposal to dry disposal (and to beneficial reuse).  In 1996, 26% of fly ash was disposed of in ponds (aka 
“impoundments”).  This fly ash disposal method dropped to 21% in 2005. 
 

•  Possible Factors Behind this CCR Dry Disposal Conversion Trend 

 
In the next few years, there will be a number of factors that may affect the way coal-fired plants in the electric utility industry operate 
that may further encourage CCR dry disposal rather than wet disposal.  Five example factors are: 
 

1.  Federal regulations: EPA plans to issue a number of regulations that will affect electric utility plants under the Clean Air Act 

94 

and the Clean Water Act.  For example anticipated Clean Air Act regulations will likely lead to increased use of SO2 
controls on existing electric utility plants that will increase the tonnage of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) solids that must be 
processed (i.e., beneficially used or disposed) and is some cases add calcium derivatives to the existing fly ash (through use 
of dry scrubbers).  While the incremental costs of handling such additional materials are site specific, there are a number of 
factors that are likely to drive electric utility companies to give more consideration to dry CCR disposal.  While wet disposal 
was common on earlier generations of wet scrubbers, in recent cases, some electric utility companies have focused much 
more strongly on options to reduce costs by finding beneficial uses for CCR.  Furthermore, given the magnitude of the 
upcoming projects and growing public interest in how CCR are handled and disposed, expediting approval of the project 
may also drive towards consideration of dry disposal methods. 

2.  State regulations: A number of state governments are considering programs that may affect their respective state-wide 

economic demand for electricity. 

3.  Technology: New technologies for generation, transmission, and use of electricity are being introduced into the market. 
4.  Fuel cost: Spot markets for coal make it easy for plants to fuel switch or mix coal fuel types.  This means, among other 

things that wet CCR disposal systems, because they limit the types of coal that these plants can use, are likely to be further 
reduced. 

5.  Plant property:  As land availability constraints becomes more important to electric utility plants (e.g., some electric utility 
plants are located in riparian settings), on-site wet disposal areas become less important in favor of smaller footprint on-site 
dry disposal landfills and sending CCR off-site for disposal or beneficial use. 

 
As electric utility companies face this myriad of changes, they are likely to be reconsidering at a very detailed level how they are 
operating their plants.  In fact, this is evident in the fact that some electric utility companies have already announced actual or planned 
closures of a number of coal-fired electric generator units, while other companies have announced plans to switch some units or plants 
 

from coal to other fuels such as natural gas.  This consideration of the way electric utility plants will operate is likely to include a 
reconsideration of how the plants will handle and disposal CCR.   Furthermore, since future air pollution regulations are likely to cause 
more reassessment at electricity plants with older and less efficient air emission particulate control devices and air pollution scrubbers, 
air regulations themselves are likely to provide further inducement to reconsider CCR disposal practices at plants that are currently 
using wet disposal.  These actions in the near future also mean that the market and regulatory environment in which these plants operate 
will continue to be in flux and the ability to operate in a way that will make them able to respond quickly to changes will be important. 
 
Corroborating continuation of this historical phase-out trend are recent (2009) announcements by five electric utility companies (i.e., Tennessee 
Valley Authority (TVA), Duke Energy Company, Hoosier Energy REC Inc, Vectren Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company, and Westar 
Energy Company)99 that they plan to convert all or a significant portion of their CCR impoundments to dry management within the next 10 
years corroborates continuation of this recent impoundment phase-out trend.  These 18 plants alone comprise 17% of the annual 22.4 million 
tons CCR disposed annually in impoundments (as of 2005).  In addition, three companies have announced planned coal-fired electricity plant 
closures or planned switching from coal to other fuels.  These three plants comprise 3% of the annual CCR impoundment disposal tonnage.  
See Exhibit 4H below for a list of these companies, their plant names, and associated CCR impoundment disposal annual tonnages.  Future 
developments in the electric utility industry, including compliance with upcoming Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act regulations under 
development at EPA, will increase the dry disposal conversion trend.  It is inappropriate to assign the costs of these conversions to the CCR 
proposed rule, because they would happen anyway, in absence of the rule.  

                                                 
99 TVA’s 20 August 2009 news release “TVA Coal Combustion Products Remediation Plan Proposed” announced that TVA plans “to convert all TVA wet ash and gypsum 
storage to dry…over eight to 10 years.” .  Recent plans to convert from wet CCR impoundment disposal to dry landfill disposal for electric utility plants operated by the 
Duke Energy Company, the Hoosier Electric Cooperative, and Vectren Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company were reported 24 October 2009 by Mark Wilson of the 
Courier Press “Coal Ash Disposal Varies From Company to Company” at http://btop.courierpress.com/news/2009/oct/24/coal-ash-disposal-varies-from-company-to-
company/?print=1 
Westar Energy apparently converted to dry fly ash management by December 2006 according to “Coal Plant O&M: Retrofit Flyash-Handling System Pays Dividends,”

Notes: 
* EPA-ORCR identified the 18 plants with recent plans to convert from wet to dry CCR landfill disposal for electric utility plants operated by the Duke Energy 
Company, the Vectren Company, and the Hoosier Electric Cooperative, from the 24 October 2009 news report by Mark Wilson of the Courier Press “Coal Ash Disposal 
Varies From Company to Company.” . The Westar Energy plant was identified by an EPA-ORCR staff person based on knowledge of that specific plant or company. 
** EPA identified the 8 plants switching from coal from SourceWatch websites: http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Coal_plant_conversion_projects 
and http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Existing_U.S._Coal_Plants

o  Result of Dry Conversion Cost Update 

 
The result of this dry conversion cost update is displayed below in comparison to the initial conversion cost estimate.  The adjusted cost 
incorporates the average annual 1.1% decrease in CCR impoundment disposal tonnage calculated based on the 1996-2005 EIA data trend as 
presented in Exhibit 4G above, relative to the 2005 base year impoundment disposal tonnage of 22.4 million tons over the same 50-year period 
(i.e., 2012 to 2061) applied in the RIA.  This adjustment provides a declining future CCR impoundment tonnage trend which would be 
impacted by the CCR proposed rule when it is implemented, rather than simply assigning to the rule a dry conversion cost for the entire 2005 
impoundment tonnage (i.e., 22.4 million tons) as was done in the initial cost estimate.  The cost adjustment using this trend involved two steps: 
 

Step 1:  Assign a dry conversion cost to the extrapolation phase-out trend (i.e., 2006 to 2061) representing what the electric utility 
industry could be expected to incur in the future in absence of the CCR rule.  The results of this 1st step are displayed in columns A1 to 
A4 of Exhibit 4I below. 
 
Step 2:  Re-estimate the phase-out cost under this same industry trend but by adding the requirement under the CCR rule that all 
remaining CCR impoundment tonnage that is not projected to be voluntarily phased-out within 5-years of the final rule’s adoption must 
be phased-out.  This step incorporates three assumptions: (a) EPA promulgates the final rule at the start of 2012, (b) state governments 
adopt the final rule 2-years later at end of 2013, and (c) the final rule allows a 5-year phase-out period which spans 2014 to 2018.  The 
results of this 2nd step are displayed in columns B1 to B4 of Exhibit 4I below.

As summarized below in comparison to the initial cost estimate, the updated conversion cost is the difference in the step-1 cost to the electric 
utility industry for continuation of the phase-out trend without the CCR rule, compared to the step-2 cost for mandatory phase-out with the rule.

The updated cost is also presented below after integrating the updated dry conversion cost back into the overall cost of the CCR proposed rule 
which contains two other cost categories as estimated for the Subtitle C option (i.e., $491 million/year for engineering control costs + $107 
million/year for ancillary regulatory costs).

As shown above, the composite effect of the two cost update factors is they reduce the initial dry conversion cost estimate by 48%, and reduce 
by 35% the overall compliance cost estimate (i.e., dry conversion cost plus engineering control costs plus ancillary costs). 
 

o  Factors Which May Accelerate the CCR Impoundment Phase-Out Trend 

 
For the reasons described above, it is clear that there is a significant past and continuing trend toward CCR impoundment phase-out at electric 
utility plants, regardless of the CCR rule, and that this trend will continue.  Described below, EPA has identified seven factors which 
corroborate continuation of this impoundment phase-out trend, some of which have been quantified in the cost adjustment: 
 

1.  Industry conversions to dry CCR disposal:  This factor corroborates the phase-out trend applied in the cost update.  As discussed 
above, there is a documented over two-decade long trend 1996 to 2019 away from wet CCR disposal in the electric utility industry.  
This trend consists of two parts: (a) the 1996-2005 historical data period, plus (b) the more recent (2009) announcements of actual 
conversions which occurred between 2005 and 2009, and planned conversions to occur within the next 10 years (i.e., by 2019).  
According to one company (United Conveyor Corporation) who has been supplying dry disposal equipment and conversion services to 
the electric utility industry, the main historical drivers for this voluntary shift have been (1) generating dry fly ash as a saleable co-
product to other industries for beneficial uses, and (2) decreasing the volume of fly ash going to impoundments to provide greater 
capacity for bottom ash.  Since then, concern over possible future environmental release liabilities associated with CCR impoundments, 
and pressure from individual state governments, has led electric utility companies to consider dry conversion.  TVA is the most 
prominent example of this trend which publicly announced100 in 2009 it plans to convert its wet fly ash and wet bottom ash systems to

dry disposal within the next eight to 10 years (i.e. by 2019).  Conversions of this sort are a current trend, and they will definitely 
continue, even in the absence of the CCR proposed rule.  As summarized in Exhibit 4H above (columns A to D), EPA identified 18 
such plants constituting 17% of the industry-wide wet CCR disposal tonnage as of 2005.  It is inappropriate to attribute the wet disposal 
phase-out cost of the CCR proposed rule to plants independently moving to dry CCR disposal.  At this point, EPA expects that most 
plants will choose to move to dry disposal given the additional factors presented below. 

2.  Plants switching to other fuels:  EPA assumes this factor is reflected in the phase-out trend applied to the cost update.  Some coal-
fired electricity plants have since 2005 switched, or are planning to switch, some or all of their coal-fired boilers at certain plants, from 
coal to other fuels (e.g. natural gas) for reasons unrelated to the CCR proposed rule.  In such cases, the cost of closure of their CCR 
disposal impoundments should not be attributed to the cost of the proposed rule.  This factor decreases the estimated cost of the rule, 
and particularly EPA’s estimated future cost of phasing-out wet disposal attributable to the proposed rule.  For example, based on 
EPA’s recent internet search, as also displayed in Exhibit 4H above (columns E to H), EPA identified 8 coal-fired electric utility plants 
using impoundments (as of 2005) representing 3% of wet CCR disposal by the 158 plants, which have or plan to switch fuels at one or 
more of their coal-fired electricity generation boilers within one or more plants, or to close one or more of their coal-fired boilers or 
entire coal-fired plants. 

3.  Lifespan expiration of existing CCR impoundments:  This factor suggests a faster future phase-out trend than applied in the cost 
update, but is not applied in the cost update.  Another factor which corroborates the future continuation of the electric utility industry’s 
voluntary phase-out of CCR impoundments, is the fact that existing (i.e., active, operational) CCR impoundments have distinct 
operational lifespans.  When an impoundment reaches its end-of-lifespan, the electric utility plant must in that future year either add 
new impoundment capacity by installing another impoundment, or convert to dry disposal by installing a landfill (or providing their 
annual CCR for beneficial uses).  For purpose of estimating the “engineering cost” component (in Chapter 4 of this RIA), EPA 
assigned impoundment lifespan start years (i.e., year in which impoundment construction was completed and began receiving CCR), 
and future expected impoundment operational lifespan closure years, to each of the 158 coal-fired plants with operational CCR 
impoundments (as of 2005) identified in this RIA.  For the most part, the impoundment start years were based on actual industry-
reported data from the references cited in this RIA.  However, expected closure years were provided by industry for 78 of the 158 
plants; thus, EPA assigned expected closure years to the remainder 80 plants assuming a 40-year lifespan.  Exhibit 4J below presents a 
summary of the expected future closure years in relation to the remaining lifespan years and associated impoundment tonnages which 
are expected to reach end of operational lifespan in absence of the CCR rule.  This summary indicates that all existing CCR 
impoundments could be expected to reach end-of-lifespan by year 2051, and that 20% of impoundments will have reached end-of-
lifespan by year 2018.  According to the cost update assumptions discussed in the 2nd update steps of prior section above, year 2018 
represents the 5th year of the CCR final rule’s assumed 5-year phase-out period spanning 2014 to 2018, which also assumes the CCR 
final rule is promulgated by EPA at the start of 2012 and that state governments will adopt the rule 2-years later by the end of 2013.  
This lifespan expiration trend corroborates the assumed continuation of the phase-out trend depicted in Exhibit 4I (column A1) which 
indicates that 17% of CCR impoundment tonnage may be expected to have phased-out by year 2018 (i.e., 18.7 million tons remaining 
by 2018 compared to 22.5 million tons in the analysis base year 2005) in absence of the CCR rule.  In fact, given that end-of-lifespan 
provides companies with a low-cost opportunity to convert to dry disposal, the higher 20% end-of-lifespan percentage compared to the 
100 

 

 

 

17% phase-out trend suggest the future phase-out trend may be accelerated compared to the 1.1% annual phase-out assumed based on 
the 1996-2005 trend.  For example, this result suggests that by 2018 the annual phase-out rate in that year could be 1.3% (i.e., 
(20%/17%) x 1.1%)). 

4.  EPA’s Clean Air Act emissions standards:  This factor is not quantified in the cost update.  Where existing coal-fired electric 
utility plants put in new air emission scrubbing systems, EPA believes they will overwhelmingly rely on CCR management systems that 
do not require wet disposal impoundments.  Two of EPA’s upcoming Clean Air Act (CAA) air pollution regulations may lead some coal 
plants to begin using large amounts of reagent to capture SO2 from boiler flue gas: 
•  EPA’s Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) which was vacated by the DC Circuit Court in 2007 compels EPA under the CAA Section 

112 to issue maximum achievable control technology (MACT) regulations for coal- and oil-fired electric utility units: 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/utility/utilitypg.html 

•  EPA’s remanded Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was also vacated by the DC Circuit Court in 2007 but was later reinstated and 

remanded back to the Agency for further review/clarification: http://www.epa.gov/cair 

 
Such plants would likely experience a significant increase in the amount of fly ash or wet FGD waste tonnage to be disposed, because 
the reactants are either captured with the fly ash or with the wet FGD waste.  If these plants currently dispose of bottom ash, fly ash, or 
wet FGD waste in wet impoundments, the likelihood of significantly increased future disposal tonnages may prompt them to consider a 
switch to dry disposal.  Therefore, new CCR generated as a result of new Clean Air Act emissions requirements are very likely to cause 
plants to switch away from wet disposal independent from the CCR proposed rule.  EPA has not quantified this factor for purpose of 
updating the 2009 RIA regulatory cost estimate in this RIA. 

5.  EPA’s Clean Water Act effluent standards:  This factor is not quantified in the cost update.  EPA is currently developing new 
industrial wastewater effluent regulations for coal-fired electricity plants.  These new regulations are likely to tighten significantly 
existing effluent limits.  These new regulations will be one more factor likely to influence plants to switch to dry disposal systems. 

6.  State government implementation of rule:  This factor is quantified in the cost update.  It recognizes that states require two years 
for their state legislatures or environmental regulatory programs to adopt new RCRA regulations such as the CCR final rule, which is 
necessary for the rule to become federally enforceable.  In the initial cost estimate, EPA assumed that the CCR final rule would become 
effective (i.e., adopted by states) in year 2012 and that dry conversion capital costs would all be incurred in that single year.  In contrast 
to that simple cost estimation framework, this cost update factor pushes the dry conversion cost 2-years out into the future beginning in 
2014.  The 5-year allowed dry conversion (i.e., impoundment phase-out) period is thus 2014 to 2018.  In reality, there is a further 
distinction to be made.  For states which operate EPA-authorized RCRA regulatory programs (as of 2005, EPA-authorized states 
comprise 97% of the 22.4 million tons annual CCR impoundment disposal tonnage), they could have 2-years adoption period.  However, 
in non-authorized states (i.e., AK, IA), territories, and Indian country, the CCR rule becomes effective in 2012 by fact that EPA will 
implement it directly.  According to the 2005 EIA data, in this 2nd group there are four plants with impoundments in IA plus one plant 

101 

 

 

 

 

with impoundment(s) on tribal land totaling 3% of the 22.4 million tons impoundment disposal in 2005.101  Because this 2nd group only 
comprises a very small 3% fraction of the annual CCR impoundment disposal tonnage, and to avoid adding another layer of complexity 
to the cost update which would only result in a very small (i.e., <5%) difference in updated estimate, the cost update does not separately 
calculate costs for both groups addressing under this factor, but applies implementation year to the entire 22.4 million tonnage.  This 2-
year final rule adoption cost-timing adjustment factor is highlighted in Exhibit 4I above. 

7.  5-year impoundment phase-out period:  This factor is quantified in the cost update.  It recognizes that electric utility plants are 
likely to incur dry conversion capital costs spread across each of the years in the CCR rule’s 5-year mandated phase-out period, rather 
than incurring all dry conversion capital cost in one year as was simply assumed in the initial cost estimate.  This cost-timing adjustment 
factor is highlighted in Exhibit 4I above. 

 

                                                 
101 As of 2005, the four IA plants are the George Neal North plant (50,200 tons/year CCR impoundment disposal), the Lansing plant (24,000 tons/year), the Louisa plant 
(23,000 tons/year), and the Walter Scott Jr Energy Center plant (104,000 tons/year).  The one plant located on tribal land is the Four Corners plant in NM (501,400 
tons/year).

 4D.  Cost Estimation Uncertainty 
 
This section addresses OMB’s 2003 Circular A-4 “Regulatory Analysis” guidance (page 40) requirement for RIAs involving rules with 
expected annual economic effects of $1 billion or more, to present a formal quantitative analysis of the uncertainties about benefit and cost 
estimates.  This section only addresses uncertainties with respect to cost estimates for both baseline cost and incremental costs for the 
regulatory options.  This section first presents three specific examples of data quality uncertainty factors in this RIA, followed by an overall 
uncertainty factor to represent all such specific data quality uncertainty factors combined (the three factors below are not additive across their 
low- and high-end percentage range endpoints because such simple addition would represent unlikely compounding of these factors): 
 

•  Specific Examples of Data Quality Uncertainty Factors in This RIA 

1.  CCR tonnage data:The baseline and regulatory cost estimates in this RIA are based on the annual CCR disposal and beneficial use 

 

 

2.  Data sources: 

3.  Data years: 

tonnages reported by electric utility plants to the 2005 DOE-EIA Form 767 database.  However, the DOE-EIA 767 
data reporting form102 does not provide respondents with a definition for the “tons” collected in Schedule 3 of the 
data reporting form.  Because there are three numerical definitions of “ton” commonly used in the US (i.e., short-ton 
= 2,000 pounds, long-ton = 2,200 pounds; and metric ton = 2,205 pounds), this factor potentially introduces -20% to 
+20% uncertainty range.  For purpose of consistency with the use of short-tons in most EPA RCRA program 
reports,103 this RIA interprets CCR “tons” as short-tons. 
Also with respect to CCR tonnage data, this RIA cites multiple possible sources of data based on different published 
sources.  For example, as displayed in Exhibit 4D of this RIA, one source (American Coal Ash Association) 
provides an industry survey-based estimate of CCR generation by electric utility plants in 2005 of 123.1 million tons.  
Whereas this RIA estimates 141.2 million tons CCR generation in 2005 based on data from the 2005 DOE-EIA Form 
767 database for plants >100 MW in size and based on supplemental estimates made in this RIA for <100 MW size 
plants.  This data source inconsistency factor represents -13% to +15% uncertainty range. 
Information and data used to evaluate and estimate the cost of baseline CCR disposal practices are from various 
published sources dated 1995, 1996, and 2006.  Furthermore, unit costs for CCR disposal unit engineering controls 
applied in this RIA are from different published data years such as 2000, 2004, and 2007.  This RIA updated 
historical data to 2009 price levels using various indexes, some of which were specific to a particular type of unit 
cost, and other indexes were general (e.g., GDP Price Deflator).  The uncertainty in accuracy of unit costs introduced 
by use of historical data is not quantified. 

•  Overall Data Quality Uncertainty Range

A copy of the 2005 DOE-EIA 767 data reporting questionnaire (16 pages) is available at http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/forms/eia767/eia767.pdf 
103 One example of the standardized use of “short-tons” in EPA RCRA program reports is the RCRA Biennial Hazardous Waste Reports which are archived at 
http://www.epa.gov/waste/inforesources/data/biennialreport/index.htm 
 

107 

 
The method applied to characterize the overall level of quantitative uncertainty in the cost estimates of this RIA, is based on the 02 February 
2005 “Recommended Practice No. 18R-97: Cost Estimate Classification System as Applied in Engineering, Procurement, and Construction for 
the Process Industries”104.  This method is specifically applicable to cost estimates developed for mechanical and chemical process equipment 
used for engineering, procurement and construction across a wide variety of industries including the electric utility industry sector (i.e., NAICS 
code 22).  As summarized in Exhibit 4M below, this cost estimate classification system involves five estimation categories (i.e., Class 1, Class 
2, Class 3, Class 4, Class 5) reflecting different relative (a) levels of cost definition, (b) purposes and uses of cost estimates,  (c) cost estimation 
methodologies, (d) expected accuracy ranges, and (e) degrees of cost estimate preparation effort.

engineered process and equipment lists) for purpose of alternatives 
analysis, screening analysis, or demonstration of economic 
feasibility. 

10% to 40% complete, semi-detailed information (e.g., process 
flow diagrams, equipment diagrams, layout drawings, engineered 
process and equipment lists). 
30% to 70% complete, detailed information 
50% to 100% complete and full project definition (e.g., virtually all 
engineering and design documentation/plans) 

Data quality uncertainty range applied in this RIA (i.e., between Class 3 and Class 4) = 

May require up to nine months FTE to prepare the cost 
estimate. 

May require up to 1.5 years FTE to prepare the cost estimate. 
May require up to or over three years FTE to prepare the cost 
estimate. 

 
 
Because the bulk of the data collection and analysis presented in this RIA was executed in a relatively short time (i.e., five months) using semi-
detailed information for baseline CCR disposal conditions, disposal unit costs, and engineering control and ancillary costs for the regulatory 
options, the level of numerical uncertainty for the baseline cost and incremental costs for each of the regulatory options estimated in this RIA 
may be classified between a Class 3 and Class 4 type of estimate (i.e., -25% to +40%), as displayed below in Exhibit 4N.  These uncertainty 
ranges represent a probability distribution about the cost estimates, and may be interpreted as the expected values (i.e., best estimates) and low-
end and high-end ranges about each cost estimate.  Such quantitative indicators of uncertainty are identified in OMB’s Circular A-4 (pages 40, 
41) as acceptable for characterizing probability distributions for cost estimates involving major rules with possible annual economic effects of 
$1 billion or more for one or more regulatory options.

In contrast to the Exhibit 5A list of RCRA regulatory program benefits, because of time, data, and methodological limitations, the regulatory 
benefits estimated in this RIA do not represent a complete list of expected benefits of the CCR proposed rule.  For example, the benefits 
analysis in this Chapter of the RIA does not estimate benefits of (a) reducing cancer risks associated with preventing direct effluent discharges 
of CCR to surface waters, (b) ecological and ecosystem benefits, (c) off-site CCR disposal regulatory benefits, or (d) non-cancer human health 
protection benefits.  In contrast to this large number of possible benefit elements, this RIA monetizes only three benefit categories consisting of 
five sub-elements. 
 

1.  Groundwater Protection Benefits at CCR Disposal Sites 

a.  Human health protection benefits (i.e., benefit of preventing cancer from arsenic exposure) 
b.  Groundwater remediation costs avoided 

2.  CCR Impoundment Catastrophic Failure Benefits 

a.  Future cleanup costs avoided 

3.  Benefits from Increase in Future CCR Beneficial Uses 

a.  Direct market benefits (economic benefits) 
b.  Lifecycle social benefits (economic + environmental benefits) 

 
These monetized benefits are based on EPA’s initial analysis using existing information and analytical techniques.  EPA requests public 
comment on all data sources and analytical approaches used in estimating the benefits presented in this Chapter. 
 
 
5A.  Groundwater Protection Benefits (Avoided Future Cancer Risks & Groundwater Remediation Costs) 
This section estimates the potential future benefits of reduced human cancer risks and avoided groundwater contamination remediation costs 
associated with controlling arsenic from onsite CCR landfills and surface impoundments.  The estimates are based on EPA’s risk assessment, 
which predicts leaching behavior using SPLP and TCLP data.  Recent research and damage cases indicate that these leaching tests under-
estimate risks from dry disposal.105  Human cancer risks avoided are based on the individual “excess” lifetime cancer probabilities estimated 
below.  This estimation follows an 8-step method which begins by characterizing the cancer risks and expected number of future cancer risks 
from arsenic releases to groundwater from CCR landfills and surface impoundments in the absence of EPA or state action.  It then proceeds to 
monetize these cancers using accepted economic practices.  Next, a baseline is established for the operation of state regulatory and remedial 
                                                 
105 Recent EPA research demonstrates that CCR can leach significantly more aggressively under different pH conditions potentially present in disposal units.  In a 2009 
EPA study of 34 electric utility plants, CCR from 19 facilities exceeded at least one of the 40 CFR Toxicity Characteristic regulatory values for at least one type of CCR
(e.g., fly ash or FGD residue) at the self-generated pH of the material (source: EPA Office of Research & Development, “Characterization of Coal Combustion Residues 
from Electric Utilities – Leaching and Characterization Data,” EPA-600/R-09/151. Office of Research and Development, Air Pollution Control Division. Research Triangle 
Park, NC. December 2009).  This behavior likely explains the rapid migration of chemical constituents from CCR disposal sites like Chesapeake, VA and Gambrills, MD.

06/008. Office of Research and Development. Research Triangle Park, NC. January 2006; and EPA “Characterization of Coal Combustion Residues from Electric Utilities

programs. Groundwater remediation costs and cancer costs under the baseline and each regulatory option are then estimated.  Finally, the 
aggregate benefits from each regulatory option (incremental to the baseline) are estimated. 
 
Step 1.  Categorize CCR Disposal Units by Type 
 
This step begins with the baseline data on CCR disposal (i.e., disposal unit liner types, annual CCR disposal tonnages) contained in Appendix 
F of this RIA for the 495 coal-fired electric utility plants.  A subtotal 84 of the 495 plants dispose CCR offsite only, and thus, no liner type is 
assigned to these facilities in this benefits analysis.106  Some of the plants have multiple data entries because they were known to have multiple 
CCR disposal units on-site.  This estimation step assigned only the riskiest disposal unit type and liner type combinations of those listed for 
each such plant, which resulted in the six combinations displayed below in Exhibit 5A-1.107  This hierarchy was based on the 90th percentile, 
trivalent arsenic cancer risks in the EPA-ORCR 2009 CCR risk report as follows, with those units posing the greatest risk appearing first.  
Appendix K1 presents further information on CCR disposal unit liner types and associated data. 
 
These plants were then further divided by the type of waste disposed in the units; CCR only or co-managed wastes.  The ratio of facilities that 
only dispose CCR compared to facilities that co-manage CCR with coal refuse is displayed below in Exhibit 5A-1.  These ratios allowed EPA 
to model a single number of potential cancer cases as a best estimate.  The data used in the 2009 risk assessment108 were from a 1995 EPRI 
survey.  Thus, there is some uncertainty regarding the current accuracy of these ratios.  To account for this uncertainty, EPA also calculated a 
bounding range of cancers based on the assumption that all facilities would dispose of CCR only, and that all facilities would co-manage CCR 
with coal refuse only.

106 Note: 83 facilities in Exhibits E2 and E4 of the 2009 risk assessment are not assigned WMUs or liner types, 5 fewer than indicated in this RIA. 
107 Multiple CCR disposal units at a single industrial facility will all affect the same surrounding population.  To avoid duplication of population risks, the analysis used the 
simplifying assumption that the human health risks will be driven by the riskiest single WMU, when multiple waste management units are present, but populations around 
all WMUs are accounted for in Appendix K2 of this RIA.

Step 2.  Determine Potentially Affected Populations of Groundwater Drinkers 
 
With information on the universe of facilities, WMUs, and liners nearby groundwater-drinking populations were assigned.  To accomplish this, 
EPA first assigned latitude and longitude coordinates to the 495 sites based on its 2007 eGRID database.   Only a few sites were not in eGRID, 
and it is assumed that these sites were constructed since the 2007 eGRID data collection.  Once latitude and longitude data were assigned, EPA 
used GIS data to ascertain the location of private groundwater wells within a one-mile radius from the latitude and longitude coordinates, and 
then the number of individuals drinking from those wells.109,110  The data divide populations into adults (18 and older) and children, the same 
two populations examined in the 2009 risk assessment.  Once these data were attached to specific sites, they were aggregated based on the 
liner/WMU categories above.   
 
Aggregated data were then scaled to account for the missing population information and population growth.  First, the data was scaled up to 
account for the missing population data in the sites not identified in eGRID.  There were 5 unlined landfills, 1 clay-lined landfill, and 7 
composite-lined landfills that had onsite disposal but no eGRID data from which to determine the population.  All surface impoundments had 
the necessary eGRID data.  To account for these individuals, EPA made the assumption that these plants had populations similar to the plants 
EPA had data for, since EPA had no data to suggest otherwise.111  Thus, the population was scaled up by a scaling factor equal to the total 
number of plants divided by the number of plants for which EPA had population data as follows: 

 
The populations were then scaled up to current population levels based on Census data, resulting in a scaling factor of 1.093. 
 
Once these preliminary population estimates were produced, it was also necessary to account for the size of the waste management unit.  In the 
2009 risk assessment, WMUs were assumed to be square as a requirement of the model.  Using the same assumption here, the actual 1-mile 
radius around the square area of a WMU could be estimated by scaling the population density of the original 1-mile radius up to the area 1-mile 
around a square WMU of average size.  This led to scaling factors of 1.81 and 2.56 for landfills and surface impoundments, respectively.  
Further discussion of this area-based scaling can be found in Appendix K2. 
 
In addition to accounting for the increased area in the 1-mile radius, EPA assumed that half of the receptors would be up-gradient and half 
would be down-gradient of the WMU.  For the purposes of this assessment, populations were assumed to be equally distributed within the 
                                                 
109 This data was developed through the use of the 2000 census block data in combination with the 1990 census drinking water source data.  For a further discussion of 
population development, see Appendix K3 of this RIA. 
110 Municipal water systems using groundwater often rely on deeper aquifers, in which case they would be less susceptible to contamination from CCR releases.  Therefore, 
these systems were not included in the 2009 Risk Assessment or in this analysis.  However, exposure through this pathway is possible, which means that these population 
estimates could underestimate the population that is exposed to these wastes. 
111 EPA does not account for CCR disposed off-site as in the Gambrills MD and Chesapeake VA damage cases.

square whose center was the facility WMU.  This is illustrated in Exhibit 5A-2 below.  It was also assumed that only down-gradient 
populations would be affected (red rectangle), and no up-gradient populations would be affected.  This was accounted for by dividing the one-
mile population by two.  The issue of surface waterbodies is addressed below.  Appendix K3 provides a detailed explanation of the derivation 
of the exposed population by plant.  Overall, 715,855 individuals are potentially exposed to CCR.  Of this total, 34,533 use private drinking 
water wells.

Step 3.  Apply EPA-ORCR 2009 Arsenic Groundwater Risk Results 
 
This step involved determining the most appropriate individual risk factors for use in estimating arsenic cancer population risk for the estimated 
populations residing near the CCR disposal sites.  There are two sources of information on individual risks associated with arsenic exposure:   
 

IRIS 1998:  Based on skin cancer incidence, as data on skin cancer risks were available prior to the availability of quantitative data for 
internal cancers.  Skin cancer is a health endpoint associated with lower fatality risk than the internal cancers induced by 
arsenic.  The skin cancer based risk assessments no longer represent the current state of the science for health risk 
assessment for arsenic. This RIA presents these estimates below for informational purposes only.  This source describes a 
distribution of risks to a hypothetical individual who drinks water from a well located at a randomly selected point one mile 
down-gradient from the waste management unit edge.  The probabilistic risk estimates were “site-based” (that is, not site-
specific, but based roughly on 181 actual coal-fired power plants that were operating in 1995).  EPA has only the “peak” 
risks (i.e., those corresponding generally to the highest groundwater concentrations that are modeled to occur) available for 
analysis because computer modeling of peak risks contain gigabytes worth of information, and while EPA attempted to 
keep track of risks up to 10,000 years of the computer model run, the data in these large files became corrupted and are now 
unusable.  However, below in this RIA EPA does extrapolate population risks in other years.  These other years are the 
years between the cessation of operation of the landfill, or the years after the beginning of operation of the surface 
impoundment, leading up to the years in which the “peak” risks occur at half of the modeled facilities. 

 
NRC 2001:  The latest science on health risks associated with arsenic exposure is from the National Research Council (NRC) report 

“Arsenic in Drinking Water: 2001 Update”112 which reviewed the available toxicological, epidemiological, and risk 
assessment literature on the health effects of inorganic arsenic, building upon the NRC’s prior report, “Arsenic in Drinking 
Water” (1999).  The 2001 report, developed by an eminent committee of scientists with expertise in arsenic toxicology and 
risk assessment provides a scientifically sound and transparent assessment of cancer risks from inorganic arsenic.  EPA’s 
Science Advisory Board endorses these estimates and the IRIS estimates are currently being updated to reflect this latest 
science.  Therefore, while IRIS estimates exist, because the more recent NRC scientific information is available, this RIA 
relies on the NRC information for analysis of the cancer risks associated with CCR.  Appendix K4 provides more detailed 
information on how this NRC research was used. 

 
For the purposes of initially estimating the expected number of cancers (i.e., cancer risks) in Steps 3 and 4, this RIA applied risk results 
obtained with the latest (i.e., 1998) IRIS value.  However, in Step 5 below, the 2001 NRC research was used to update these cancer estimates.  
It should be noted that the 1998 IRIS skin cancer value does not examine bladder and lung cancer incidence, and therefore is not a substitute for 
the 2001 NRC cancer risk research in this area.  To the extent that the skin cancers estimated by the IRIS value are not accounted for, this RIA 
may underestimate total cancer incidence.

This RIA extracted only those results from the EPA 2009 risk assessment to either represent (a) conventional CCR (i.e., fly ash, bottom ash, 
boiler slag, and flue gas desulphurization waste managed in the landfill or impoundment without mixing with other materials), or (b) CCR co-
managed with coal refuse.113  Of these results, only those for trivalent arsenic were used.114  For the primary analysis, it was assumed that all 
arsenic was speciated in this manner.  As noted in the EPA source data, arsenic III and arsenic V cancer risk results for unlined surface 
impoundments that co-dispose CCR with coal refuse were not statistically different at the 90th percentile, and these risks are likely to drive the 
population risk estimates.  A sensitivity analysis was conducted where all arsenic was assumed to be speciated in the arsenic V state.  This 
analysis is presented in Appendix K5.  Finally, risks for both adult and child receptors were included so that each group would be accurately 
represented.  Once all of these data were collected they were sorted by CCR disposal unit and liner type. 
 
This analysis reflects possible groundwater and surface water interactions that could affect the population risk estimates.  In situations in which 
the modeled distance to a surface water body was less than the modeled distance to a drinking water well EPA assumed that the groundwater 
plume is fully intercepted by a surface waterbody.115  To this end, EPA extracted the model inputs for the distance to groundwater wells and the 
distance to surface waterbodies used in the EPA source, randomly selected from input distributions.116  These two were then compared using a 
logical test in Microsoft Excel.  This test returned a 0 if the surface waterbody was closer than the drinking water well and 1 if it was not.  
Thus, a 1 was a positive indication that the contaminant plume in that model run reached the groundwater well. 
 
Finally, EPA extracted the exposure durations used in each model run from the EPA-ORCR 2009 CCR risk report to capture the fraction of the 
individual’s lifetime risk that was experienced in a one-year period.  EPA accomplished this by matching the probabilistic exposure duration 
inputs, to their corresponding age category.  Then, each probabilistic run was sorted to return the exposure duration of the adult and child age 
category.  These Monte Carlo data constituted a weighted approach for estimating individual human cancer risks.  Population risk is typically 
calculated by multiplying risk results by the affected population.  Since there were thousands of equally valid model iterations, this RIA 
assigned each of these risks an equal weight in its final population risks by using the average of these individual risks.   
 
Individual risk estimation took into account the fact that the contaminant plumes might be intercepted by surface waterbodies by multiplying by 
either 0 or 1 as identified above. Each of these risks was then divided by exposure duration to estimate the yearly cancer risk.117  Once all of 
these risks were calculated for a given WMU/liner type they were summed and divided by the number of iterations to give the average one year 
increment of risk for that WMU/liner type at the peak risk.  Thus, the final equation that was used for calculating average risks can be stated as:

R. “Oxidation State of Arsenic in Coal Ash Leachate,” Environmental Science & Technology, Vol.15, Number 9, September 2001. 
115 Full interception will not occur in instances where the waterbody is shallow, the waterbody is man-made, or the facility is oriented perpendicular to the waterbody.  This 
simplifying assumption serves to minimize the influence of the model runs in which interception may have occurred, but was not reflected in EPA “Human and Ecological 
Risk Assessment of Coal Combustion Wastes,” Office of Resource Conservation & Recovery, August 2009.

Step 4.  Extrapolate Annual Cancer Risks from Peak Cancer Risks 
 
The peak risks that were calculated occur well after cancers can first materialize.  Thus, constraining the benefits to only the peak population 
risks significantly underestimates total cancers avoided.  To compensate for this shortfall, this RIA formulated an approach illustrated in 
Exhibit 5A-4 below.  The blue parabolic curve for population risk is based on the well concentrations over time in the results.  While EPA 
cannot reconstruct the exact curve due to data availability issues, a parabolic curve represents groundwater contamination.  From this shape it is 
clear that the peak population risks only capture a fraction of total population risks.  Using an assumption of linear increases to the peak and 
linear decreases from the peak, produced the simplified risk profile seen as a red line in Exhibit 5A-4.

Dividing peak risks (y-value) by the time to peak (x-value), the slope of the time line was determined for each WMU/liner type as displayed in

Multiplying this slope by the number of years elapsed yields the yearly increment of individual risk for that year.  Multiplying this average 
incremental individual risk by the population exposed in each year119 EPA estimated the number of cancers in each year.  While this under-
estimates cancer incidence by the difference between the blue and red profiles it is the best estimate based on currently available data. 
 
As displayed in Exhibit 5A-6 below, this approach results in an estimate between 45 and 196 potential cancer cases over 75 years120 as a result 
of arsenic consumed through contaminated groundwater using EPA’s 1995 cancer slope factor (1.5 mg/kg/d-1) for arsenic based on skin 
cancers.  Using the ratios of conventional CCR co-managed with coal refuse a best estimate within this range is 145 cancers.   

                                                 
118 Since these iterations were performed in later model runs they could not be tied to the specific model iterations used above.  67% of the model runs had the nearest 
groundwater well occurring beyond the nearest surface waterbody.  Since the longer arrival times occur with longer travel distances, and these iterations tended to be the 
iterations that were intercepted, assumed that the 33% of model runs that were not intercepted are also the 33% of model runs with the shortest arrival times (i.e., shortest 
distances).  Taking the midpoint of these arrival times yielded the 16.5th percentile. 
119 This RIA inflated the future population each year based on the future projections made by the US Census Bureau.  From that point on, this RIA assumed a constant 
annual growth rate equal to the growth rate in year 2050. 
120 Seventy-five years were used for the analysis based on the 78 year time to peak period, less two years states are allowed to adopt the rule’s provisions, and less an 
additional year for installing groundwater monitoring.  Seventy-eight years are the time at which the risks for typical unlined and clay-lined surface impoundments that are 
not intercepted by surface water will peak.  Cancers occurring after year 78, though potentially significant, are unlikely to play a significant role when monetized because 
under a 3% discount rate, benefits fall to ten percent of their value at year 78, and at a 7% discount rate, benefits fall to 0.5% of their value at year 78.  These future cancers 
will be further reduced by state regulations, detection of contamination, and a general trend away from wet handling.

Step 5.  Estimate Arsenic Cancer Risks Using Recent NRC Science for Arsenic 
 
Based on the NRC data source, lifetime exposure to 10 ug/L arsenic in drinking water would lead to 23 excess male bladder cancers and 14 
excess male lung cancers per 10,000 people.  Under the exposure factor assumptions used by the NRC the equivalent cancer slope factor (CSF) 
is 26 mg/kg/d-1.  For details of how this cancer slope factor was calculated, see Appendix K4 – Cancer Calculations.121  Exhibit 5A-7 below 
displays the population risk estimates for CCR disposal base on the NRC source.122  Using the NRC (2001) cancer slope factor one would 
expect between approximately 778 and 3,392 cancer cases over 75 years as a result of arsenic consumed through contaminated groundwater.  
Using the ratios of conventional CCR co-managed with coal refuse produces a best estimate within this range of 2,509 cancers.

121 EPA is currently in the process of revising the arsenic cancer slope factor in EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). 
122 EPA also conducted a sensitivity analysis assuming the female cancer slope factor in Appendix K5 of this RIA.   
 

120 

Step 6.  Monetize Future Avoided Cancer Risk Benefits 
Reflecting the best science available, EPA used a point estimate of cancer cases avoided to monetize cancer risks.  Appendix K4 provides 
further explanation as to why the NRC science is considered more appropriate than the older skin cancer research that the current IRIS value 
was derived from.  Because EPA has greater confidence in the NRC estimates, it chose to use the 2,509 cancers calculated above as the best 
estimate.  EPA also used the NRC ratio of 23 male bladder cancers to 14 male lung cancers to estimate how many of each type were likely to 
occur in each year.  That is, 62%, or 1,556 cancers, are assumed to be bladder cancers and 38% or 953 are assumed to be lung cancers.  
Appendix K7 shows the best estimate number of lung and bladder cancers in each year that was used in the remaining portions of this analysis. 
 
Since cancers are not all fatal, the next step was to estimate the number of cancers that are fatal and non-fatal.  This was done separately for 
each type of cancer using 5-year survival rates from the EPA-ORCR 2009 CCR risk report.  The 5-year survival rate used for bladder cancer is 
82% and the 5-year survival rate used for lung cancer is 14%.  Thus, 1,276 (82%) of bladder cancers are non-fatal and 280 (18%) are fatal.  For 
lung cancer, 133 (14%) are non-fatal and 820 (86%) are fatal.  Again, these cancers are spread over the 75 years of the analysis.  In order to 
monetize avoided cancer risks, this RIA applied the value of a statistical life (VSL) plus the cost of terminal cancer treatments displayed in 
Exhibit 5A-8 below.  To monetize avoided non-fatal cancer risks, this RIA used an estimate from Magat et al. (1996).123  This study shows that 
a typical individual’s assessment of a non-fatal lymphoma risk reduction was the equivalent of 58.3% of a fatal lymphoma risk reduction.124  
Therefore, this RIA assumed individuals value non-fatal bladder and lung cancer risk reduction in a similar manner.

future years are subject to income elasticity adjustments.  These represent changes in valuation in relation to changes in real income.  
For example, if, for every 1% increase in real income, a particular consumer’s willingness-to-pay for a particular item increases by 1%, 
this would be represented by an income elasticity of 1.0.  For most items, income elasticity values are actually less than 1, indicating 
that valuation of most items does not increase as fast as real income levels.  To do so, applied the change in Gross Domestic Product 
per-capita between the original dollar year of the estimates and 2008, and an income elasticity of 0.5 based on estimates from Viscusi, 
W. K. and Aldy, J. E. “The Value of a Statistical Life: A Critical Review of Market Estimates throughout the World,” Journal of Risk 
and Uncertainty, Vol.27, 2003, pp. 15–76.

bladder cancer among those who are diagnosed with the disease. 

•  Lung cancer costs are based on a 10 year time horizon during which most deaths are assumed to occur. 

The original figures in the 2001 EPA report are in 1996 dollars (source: EPA “The Cost of Illness Handbook,” Office of Pollution 
Prevention & Toxics, October 2001).  These costs are updated for this RIA to 2008 dollars using the Medical Care Component of the 
Consumer Price Index. 

 
 
These values are further adjusted for cessation lag and income as described in Appendix K8.  EPA used the cessation data of bladder cancers 
from arsenic in Chen and Gibb (2003)125 to construct a Weibull curve approximating the lag time between reduced arsenic exposure and 
reduced cancer outcomes.  Because this lag will reduce willingness to pay compared to an immediate risk reduction, the value of reduced 
statistical cancers are 83% and 67% of what they would be using an unadjusted VSL (at a 3% and 7% discount rate, respectively.)  This is 
described in more detail in Appendix K8.  For income, EPA projected per capita GDP, and used this combined with an income elasticity of 0.5 
income elasticity of 0.5 from Viscusi and Aldy (2003) to estimate the growth in VSL until the exposure year.  There has been economic debate 
over whether VSL should be adjusted to the year of exposure or the year of the cancer.  However, typically, it is not possible to know when the 
exposure occurred.  Because of the model used here, this RIA applied the VSL adjustment at the time of exposure.  The full table of VSL 
adjustment factors, as well as their derivation, is presented in more detail in Appendix K8. 
 
Applying these nominal dollar values to the number of fatal and non-fatal bladder and lung cancers in each year, a current year value for 
avoiding cancer risk was calculated for each of the 75 years.  These values can be seen in Appendix K7.  The present value (PV) of these 
values is approximately $4,696 million at a 3% discount rate and $885 million at a 7% discount rate.  This would reflect the value of avoiding 
future cancer risks assuming that no steps were taken to prevent contamination and the resulting cancers.  However, as discussed below, this is 
not realistic under baseline state regulatory controls. 
 
Step 7.  Account for Groundwater Remediation under the Baseline and Regulatory Options 
 
The results above assume that arsenic is released from existing impoundments and landfills, without any controls (beyond the liners taken into 
account in the model).  The benefits of regulatory options would be reflected by lower rates of cancer, resulting from the rule’s controls 
(including ground-water monitoring, permitting, corrective action, phase-out of surface impoundments, financial assurance, etc.).126  The rule 
will also have the benefits of reducing or eliminating groundwater remediation cost, because groundwater releases are eliminated through

126 The two Subtitle D Options evaluated were:  (1)  Subtitle D — regulation of landfills and surface impoundments, with liners required for existing and new surface 
impoundments, and new landfills and (2)  Subtitle “D Prime” — regulation of landfills and surface impoundments, with liners required only for new surface impoundments 
and landfills.

controls like surface-impoundment phase-out, or reduced because releases are caught earlier. These benefits, and how they relate, are described 
in the section below.  
 
First, even in the absence of federal regulations, CCR disposal units will not leach and cause cancers in all cases estimated through the 
evaluation above.  Even without federal regulation, there will be facilities that discover contamination and clean the contamination up before 
cancers occur, either due to state regulations or good practice.  Where exposures are identified, this RIA assumed that the pathway will be cut 
off (e.g., through provision of alternative water sources).   Even facilities that fail to prevent contamination may detect that contamination and 
clean it up at a later time, although after exposure has occurred.  This Step of the estimation attempted to account for these practices. 
 
To estimate the different speed and cost of groundwater remediation likely under the baseline and under the three regulatory scenarios (i.e., 
Subtitle C, Subtitle D and Subtitle D Prime), this RIA began by examining the differences across states in groundwater monitoring 
requirements pertaining to CCR disposal units, and focused on groundwater monitoring requirements because adequate monitoring is needed to 
determine whether a release has occurred.  This RIA assumes that, where releases of concern have been identified, and particularly where 
people may be at risk, drinking water pathways will be cut off and alternative drinking water will be provided.  Then calculated the percentage 
of CCR disposed by each state, and noted which of three levels of groundwater monitoring were required:   
 

1.  No monitoring requirements 
2.  Monitoring requirements for only future newly constructed CCR disposal units 
3.  Monitoring requirements for both future new and existing CCR disposal units 
 

Then EPA tracked the percentage of total waste that was discarded by facilities in states requiring each of these three monitoring scenarios.  
Exhibit 5A-9 below presents these percentages for states requiring at least some monitoring (categories 2 and 3 above) and states requiring 
monitoring at exiting facilities (category 3 above).  The first value in the table, 91%, is the percentage of CCR discarded in landfills that impose 
some form of monitoring requirements, whether for new landfills only, or for both new and existing landfills.  62% is the percent of CCR 
discarded in landfills that impose monitoring requirements on both new and existing CCR disposal units (a subset of the 91%).127  Percentages 
are also provided for CCR that are managed in surface impoundments.  Appendix K9 provides these data for each individual state. 

                                                 
127 Some states may require monitoring only for off-site units; however, in the absence of a specific breakdown, EPA made the assumption that on-site units would be 
monitored in all states that require monitoring.

These percentages helped to determine when releases will be identified, and the likely cost of cleanups or other remedies, when releases are 
identified, under the baseline and three regulatory scenarios.  Since all but 4 of the 2,509 cancers projected above result from surface 
impoundments, only surface impoundment monitoring data were used in the calculations.128  For the baseline scenario, it was assumed that 
states with the highest level of monitoring requirements (those requiring groundwater monitoring at both new and existing units) would 
generally find groundwater contamination relatively early and would require preventive measures that would avoid cancers (e.g., intercept the 
plume and/or put residents on municipal or bottled water).  Thus, 12% of contamination that could occur would have already been detected, 
and the resulting cancers prevented.   To the extent that cleanups and/or alternative water are required, that was considered part of the baseline. 

To model the Subtitle D option, EPA assumed that states with groundwater monitoring requirements at new units, or with some coverage of the 
units in question, would upgrade their existing programs to provide fuller coverage – because they already have a regulatory infrastructure – 
but other states with no program would not.  While states that do not currently regulate units would not change their practices simply because 
EPA issued national rules, EPA recognizes that facilities in these latter states will to a certain extent comply, to avoid citizens’ suits.  However, 
EPA’s and states’ experience in implementing the RCRA program demonstrates that self-implementing ground-water monitoring programs are 
of limited reliability.  Given these factors, the percentage of waste disposed of in states with some level of groundwater monitoring programs is 
a reasonable estimate of benefits for the subtitle D approach.  Under these assumptions, contamination in states with monitoring requirements 
for only new units, as well as contamination in states with monitoring requirements for new and existing units would be detected promptly.  
This leads to 48% of surface impoundment groundwater contamination being detected before extensive damage has occurred, and therefore 
48% of cancers being prevented.   

Since the Subtitle “D Prime” option does not require the retrofitting of existing units, unlined surface impoundments would remain a 
continuing source of release.  However, the presence of a new national rule accompanied by EPA support would lead at least some states to 
make such updates.  Since the potential risks will fall somewhere between the Subtitle D option and the baseline, the midpoint between 
baseline and the Subtitle D option (30%) was chosen as a best estimate.  This leads to 30% of contamination being immediately detected, and 
thus 30% of cancers being prevented.   

 

 

 

                                                 
128 Note, however, that considerable evidence indicates that releases from dry disposal can present significant risk as well, as demonstrated by EPA research on CCR leach 
rates at different pHs and the damage cases. 
 

124 

Finally, for Subtitle C, there would be federal oversight of the groundwater monitoring requirement, and therefore this RIA assumes 100% of 
facilities would have contamination detected early.  Looking forward, this would effectively prevent all cancers.129  In addition, the technical 
standards of the subtitle C rule would largely prevent future releases because surface impoundments would be phased-out, and because new 
landfills would require composite liners.  Similarly, closure requirements would largely prevent releases after closure of both types of units. 

Where releases of arsenic from disposal units occur in the future, they will be detected promptly after they occur under the proposed option, as 
well as under the other options where good monitoring programs are in place.  In these cases, there may be response costs, but no cancer risks.  
On the other hand, if facilities do not have adequate detection systems in place (and other adequate controls, e.g., liners, adequate closure, etc.), 
then detection will be delayed.  This RIA assumes that releases will eventually be discovered, but that detection may be on a delayed basis.  To 
quantify this assumed that contamination would be discovered consistently until it was all discovered.  Since the rate of discovery is 
unpredictable, further assumed detection would be at a constant rate, reaching 100% detection by the final year of the analysis.130  These 
discoveries were assumed not to start for six years because the first percentile of time duration until peak risks for unlined surface 
impoundments occurred.  Restated, this profile assumes that facilities in states that require groundwater monitoring for existing units would 
generally find contamination in the future soon after it occurred, reducing response costs, and preventing cancer risks.  But where monitoring 
and other controls were not adequate, releases would potentially go undetected for lengthy periods, causing cancers until the contamination was 
eventually detected and those residents switched to municipal or bottled drinking water.  In addition, response costs would be significantly 
increased.  The present value of avoiding all of the risks in the baseline case is the upper-bound on benefits, and this upper bound is reduced by 
detection and groundwater remediation as described in this section.  The risk reduction benefit for each regulatory option is the difference 
between baseline risks and remaining risks under that option.  These benefits, accounting for the detection and remediation, are presented in 
Exhibit 5A-10 below.  Baseline expected cancer risks are accounting for detection and remediation, compared to without taking these factor 
into account.  Further discussion of the cancer profile can be found in Appendix K7. 

 

 

This RIA projects a trend towards decreased management of CCR in surface impoundments.  Facilities with surface impoundments have been 
slowly moving from wet handling in impoundments to dry handling in landfills or to beneficial uses.  While this trend could affect the profile 
discussed above, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on risks for two reasons.  First, surface impoundments, to the extent they are closed, 
are typically closed with waste in place.  Thus, they are likely to continue to leach beyond the 75-year period modeled in the 2009 risk 
assessment; this is particularly true in situations where they are not lined (which are overwhelmingly the case) and where they are located in 
states without strong regulation.  In the latter case, closures are likely to be inadequate, leading to continued infiltration.  Second, the releases 
that occurred before the surface impoundments are closed will continue to migrate until they reach the groundwater wells or until they are 
intercepted by a surface waterbody (again particularly in states without strong programs).  Given the relatively very large size of the CCR 
impoundments, and the presence of a hydraulic head at least before closure, these historic releases have the potential to be significant.  Given 
these considerations, the closure of surface impoundments in states without regulations (e.g., corrective action, groundwater monitoring, etc.) 
would behave very similarly to active surface impoundments in terms of their risks to human health and the environment.  For this reason, the 
regulatory oversight in the options above was not modified for closed CCR disposal units. 
                                                 
129 Cancers from historic releases would not be affected, but the releases would be promptly identified and future exposures avoided. 
130 Some releases are likely to go entirely undetected in the absence of groundwater monitoring and other controls.  However, to put a reasonable limit around the analysis, 
this RIA assumed 100% detection.

The other major cost associated with groundwater contamination is that of remediation or other response.  To estimate that cost, EPA began by 
estimating the number of coal-fired electric utility plants that would require responses under various state environmental programs, based on 
the 2009 risk assessment.  In any particular situation, a state could require remediation of a site involving potential drinking water to 10-4, 10-5, 
or 10-6 levels.  In addition, states may choose to require groundwater remediation for groundwater that is not a likely drinking water source, 
because of ecological concerns.   Exhibit 5A-11 below shows the number of facilities potentially requiring cleanup.  Since each estimate is 
equally acceptable under current state programs, the average is believed to be a best estimate for how many electric utility plants will ultimately 
need groundwater remediation so as not to overestimate the number of remediation events.

These plant counts are based on the probabilistic model iterations from the 2009 risk assessment which were used to estimate what fraction of 
sites would leach at above various clean up levels.  Typically, solid waste cleanups can be conducted at either 10-4, 10-5, or 10-6 individual 
cancer risk levels.  Exhibit 5A-12 uses the PERCENTRANK function in Excel to estimate what percent of risk results fall at or below each 
clean up level.  For example, in the first cell of Exhibit 5A-12, the 78% means that 10-4 is higher than 78% of the probabilistic results for 
unlined landfills with conventional ash.

Model results equal to or above these percentiles would require a state or federal cleanup.  In other words, the percentage of sites above the 
cleanup level displayed in Exhibit 5A-13 can be derived by subtracting the percents in Exhibit 5A-12 above from 100%.  However, while 
states may require remediation of all groundwater, whether or not it is potable, they may also choose not to on a site by site basis.  As discussed 
in the EPA-ORCR 2009 CCR risk report, it is estimated that two-thirds of sites are located closer to a surface waterbody than to the nearest 
groundwater well.  Therefore, sites located on surface waterbodies may not be cleaned in some states.  This 2/3 decrease is accounted for in the 
second set of values in Exhibit 5A-13.

Multiplying the number of facilities in each category from Exhibit 5A-14 above by the percent of facilities requiring remediation in Exhibit

the number of facilities requiring cleanup does not account for any cleanups resulting from other constituents exceeding a hazard quotient of 1.  
Thus, this estimate may under-estimate the total number of cleanups.

With the number of units requiring remediation, EPA estimated the cost of groundwater remediation under the baseline and each regulatory 
option presented above.  Groundwater remediation costs were estimated in two steps.  First, EPA assumed contamination that might occur at 
sites in states with more stringent monitoring requirements, would be discovered promptly.  This suggests that there is likely to be less 
remediation required than at the typical site.  Thus, EPA assigned these sites the 25th percentile remediation costs displayed in Exhibit 5A-16 
below as the midpoint of the bottom half of costs.  These future remediation events were spread evenly across all 75 years of the analysis.

For the remaining sites expected to require remediation, but lacking groundwater monitoring requirements, EPA assumed discovery of 
contamination would take longer.  That is, CCR contamination would have migrated for some number of years, resulting in a larger 
groundwater plume to remediate, or more extensive remediation.  EPA assigned these sites the 75th percentile remediation costs as the midpoint 
of the top half of costs.  Since the first percentile time to peak results for unlined surface impoundments is six years, it is assumed that no 
discoveries and cleanups will be made in the first six years for these sites (three years once the two years for state adoption and one year for 
groundwater monitoring are considered).  The costs are thus spread evenly over the remaining 72 years.  The present value of these 
remediations, accounting for the slow, but continued discovery of contaminated sites, is presented in Exhibit 5A-17 below.  Further discussion 
of the discounted remediation costs for each year is presented in Appendix K10.

Step 8.  Characterize Cancer Risk Estimation Uncertainties 
 
There are a number of uncertainties associated with the annualized cancer estimates calculated in this RIA which are likely to under-estimate 
groundwater protection benefits: 

 

•  Estimates do not account for historic releases at operating plants.  These releases could lead to further migration and future cancer risks 

without proper regulatory actions like groundwater monitoring. 

•  A linear slope for individual cancer risk was used to approximate the increase in cancer risks instead of the parabolic curve. 
•  Approximately 18% of plants dispose of CCR off-site only.  Since these facilities were not accounted for, additional populations would be 

exposed to arsenic cancer risks from disposal as recently illustrated by the Gambrills, MD and Chesapeake, VA damage cases. 

•  Three new research studies131 (2006, 2008, 2009) from EPA’s Office of Research and Development, indicates that landfills may leach toxic 

metals much faster than originally believed.  The damage cases at Gambrills MD and Chesapeake VA resulted in groundwater 
contamination much more quickly than would be expected, and are therefore consistent with this research. 

                                                 
131 The three new EPA studies are:

Office of Research and Development. Research Triangle Park, NC. January 2006. 

130 

•  Multiple CCR disposal units at a single electric utility plant will all affect the same population.  The risk estimates do not account for any 

additive risks from multiple units.  However, the populations around these units are accounted for as described in Appendix K2. 

•  Multiple landfills could exist at some facilities.  While the area of multiple surface impoundments was considered, the area of multiple 

landfills was not considered because EPA did not have survey results for dry handling even though some facilities are known to have more 
than one CCR landfill onsite. 

•  Residents on municipal water systems were not included in the 2009 risk assessment or in this analysis.  However, exposure through this 

pathway is possible, which means this RIA likely under-estimated the human population that may be exposed to CCR.  

•  Populations that are farther than 1-mile that may be within the plume were not included. 
•  Some surface water bodies that this analysis assumes fully intercept the groundwater plume may in fact only partially intercept the plume, 
or not intercept it at all.  This situation would be more likely to occur when surface water bodies are small or shallow with low flow rates, 
relative to the size of the aquifer underneath the CCR disposal unit, or are oriented such that they would not likely intercept the 
groundwater plume. 

•  Potential cancer cases resulting from consumption of recreationally-caught fish (contaminated by direct surface impoundment discharges 

and leaching from groundwater to surface water) are not included in the calculations. 

•  According to the EPA-ORCR 2009 CCR risk study, cancers can continue well after the analysis ends, but these cancers were not calculated 

in the population risk estimates. 

•  The use of a 5-year survival rate does not take into account those who may die from the cancer after year 5.  Since some of the projected 5-

year cancer survivors would have died in later years, they are undervalued in this assessment. 

•  The estimated number of cleanups is based only on modeled arsenic contamination.  It does not account for cleanups based on hazard 

quotients over 1 for toxic constituents with non-cancer endpoints. 

 
The following are some uncertainties that are likely to cause over-estimation of groundwater protection benefits: 
 
•  Cancer risk estimates might include some individuals who are down-gradient, but are outside the plume. 
•  All arsenic was assumed to be present in the arsenic III state.  Appendix K5 contains an analysis in which all arsenic was assumed to be 

speciated in the arsenic V state, and EPA concluded that even if some portion of arsenic was speciated in the arsenic V state, the final 
results would not significantly change. 

•  The male CSF estimate from NRC (2001) was used instead of the female CSF.  Appendix K5 contains an analysis in which this female 

CSF was applied. 
It is possible that some states would choose not to remediate CCR contamination above cleanup levels once local residents were placed on

•  Willingness to pay estimates for non-fatal cancers has been assigned lower values in some research.  An alternative valuation for these 

cancers is presented in Appendix K5. 

•  Medical treatment costs for those dying of cancer would not occur until the cancer was first discovered. 

 

The following are some uncertainties that have an unknown effect on the benefits:   
 
•  This RIA assumed an evenly distributed population for establishing up-gradient and down-gradient populations, as well as for adjusting 

population for the WMU area. 

•  The latitude and longitude data of the WMU are uncertain. 
•  State programs serve as a proxy for units managed well and units managed poorly.  However, there could be some WMUs managed well in 

states without any program.  Conversely, there could be some WMUs managed poorly in states with an existing program. 

•  State regulatory programs affecting CCR disposal may be different than summarized in Appendix E of this RIA. 
•  Remediation costs are very site-specific, and the 25th and 75th percentile costs used here may overestimate or underestimate the true 

remediation costs of any particular cleanup.  For example, the cost of responses to new releases caught early will sometimes be below the 
estimated costs.  In other cases, even if contamination is identified early, those costs can exceed the 75th percentile estimates above.  
Responses at Gambrills MD and Chesapeake VA, two sites where CCR contamination was identified relatively early, are examples of sites 
where actual groundwater remediation responses will far exceed the cost estimates. 

•  This RIA assumed that discovery of CCR groundwater contamination and the resulting remediation costs would be incurred evenly over the 

75 year period for regulated facilities and evenly over the 72 years for unregulated facilities.  However, experience under the municipal 
solid waste program indicates that the incorporation of lined units could reduce contamination over time.

5B.  Benefit of Preventing Future CCR Impoundment Structural Failures (Avoided Cleanup Costs) 
 
In December 2008, a failure of a CCR impoundment at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Kingston Fossil Fuel Plant TN resulted in the 
environmental release of 5.4 million cubic yards of CCR.  This impoundment failure event illustrated the potential environmental damage 
severity of structural failures involving CCR impoundments.  This section of the RIA estimates future avoided impoundment failure cleanup 
costs as a potential benefit of the CCR proposed rule, according to the following 5-step method. 
 
 
Step 1.  Characterize CCR Impoundment Release Data 
 
EPA began by examining the CCR impoundment survey data collected in March and April 2009 by EPA under the authority of Section 104(e) 
of the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), from 162 individual electric utility plants and from 
61 electric utility corporate headquarters offices.  EPA obtained its list of facilities from a 2005 Department of Energy (DOE) Survey of coal 
burning electric utility facilities.  EPA used DOE’s 2005 Energy Information Agency F767 database, which provides information on the 
disposition of coal ash from coal burning electricity producers. The database included "steam-electric plants with a generator nameplate rating 
of 10 or more megawatts."  The term “generator,” means the actual electric generator, not the whole plant.  A plant typically will have one or 
more generators.  EPA also sent the letters to corporate offices of the electric utilities to make sure that all of their facilities were accounted for 
due to limitations in the DOE survey.  Based on information received in response to the initial letter to the utility corporate headquarters 
offices, on April 27, 2009, EPA sent information request letters to an additional 48 plants that had been identified by the corporate offices. 
 
Based EPA’s initial collation of the mail survey data, 42 CCR releases from impoundments were reported, all of which occurred within the last 
15 years (1995-2009), in response to Question 8 of the survey questionnaire which asked for electric power plants to report all CCR 
impoundment releases which occurred within the last 10 years (i.e., 1999 to 2008).  Exhibit 5B-1 below presents a summary of these 42 CCR 
impoundments release cases.  Appendix K11 provides additional information about these 42 release cases.

Item 2: $3.0 billion is EPA’s initial “social cost” estimate assigned in this RIA to the December 2008 TVA Kingston TN impoundment release event.  Social cost 
represents the opportunity costs incurred by society, not just the monetary costs for cleanup.  OMB's 2003 "Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis" (page 18) instructs 
Federal agencies to estimate "opportunity costs" for purpose of valuing benefits and costs in RIAs.  This $3.0 billion social cost estimate is larger than TVA’s $933 
million to $1.2 billion cleanup cost estimate (i.e., TVA’s estimate as of 03 Feb 2010), because EPA’s social cost estimate consists of three other social cost elements 
in addition to TVA’s cleanup cost estimate: (a) TVA cleanup cost, (b) response, oversight and ancillary costs associated with local, state, and other Federal agencies, 
(c) ecological damages, and (d) local (community) socio-economic damages.  Appendix Q to this RIA provides EPA's documentation and calculation of these four 
cost elements, which total $3.0 billion in social cost.  Appendix Q to this RIA also provides an alternative, lower estimate of social costs, based on different 
modeling assumptions for capturing such costs. This alternative analysis suggests that TVA’s cleanup costs alone may be close to the social costs associated with the 
Kingston impoundment failure.  EPA specifically requests comment on this social cost estimate, and will continue to develop this estimate for the final rule.

than occurred in December 2008 at TVA’s Kingston TN plant. 

2.  Significant failures: Involving between a million and a billion gallons.  These would be less than a complete failure, but still costly.  

TVA Widow’s Creek (6,100,000 gallons) and PPL Martin’s Creek (100,000,000 gallons) are the lowest and highest known releases in 
this category, respectively.  As an approximation, EPA assumes their costs should also bracket the costs of other significant 
releases.132  Thus, EPA estimates that the typical costs of a significant failure will be $23.1 million (the average of TVA Widow’s 
Creek and PPL Martin’s Creek). 

3.  Seepage failures:  Involving releases below one million gallons.  While these releases can still be significant and present risks to 
human health and the environment, this RIA does not include these in this analysis, which under-estimates total costs using this 
historical methodology.  These smaller seeps are common to earthen dams and are not necessarily a problem unless the seepage 
volume is increasing or the seepage becomes cloudy - indicating the possible transport of CCR through the embankment.   

Given this limited data, this RIA attempted to quantify the likelihood and costs of future releases using a historical methodology.  First, 
distinguished between three types of historical CCR impoundment structural failures (i.e., releases): 
 

1.  Catastrophic failures:  Involving a billion gallons or more.  These releases would have the potential to cause as much or more damage 

 
 
Step 2.  Fit a Distribution of Future Releases. 
 
For the two categories consisting of catastrophic and significant releases, this RIA estimates not only the cleanup costs of these events, but also 
their frequency.  Since relatively little data are available, this RIA applies a Poisson distribution.  The Poisson distribution is used when rare 
discrete events, and not continuous functions, are being modeled.  To be a Poisson process, the arrival of events must satisfy stationarity, non-
multiplicity, and independence.  Here, the events (releases) satisfy non-multiplicity because the probability of two or more events in a short 
period of time is very small.  They also satisfy independence because releases occurring in one time period are independent of releases in any 
other time period.  However, as these impoundments increase in age, it is quite likely that releases might increase over time, which would 
violate the stationarity requirement.  This potential problem is dealt with in Step 4 below. For the present, it will be assumed that releases occur 
at a constant rate in the future.  In general, a Poisson distribution can be represented by the equation: 
 

t

)

 

                                                 
132 This is a valid assumption if cleanup costs are closely correlated to tonnage released.  Since cost modeling software typically requires an input of gallons released, the 
correlation is likely strong.

Step 3.  Calculate Future Impoundment Failure Avoided Cleanup Cost Benefits 
 
After fitting a distribution of the number of releases likely to occur, EPA proceeded to combine these with the cost data presented in Step 1 
above.  This was done for the average case and three high-end cases (90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles).  For each case, the number of expected 
releases seen in Exhibit 5B-4 below was divided by 50 to get the expected number of releases per year.  These events were then multiplied by 
their respective costs, and the catastrophic and significant release values were summed in each year.

* Note: $3.0 billion is EPA’s initial “social cost” estimate assigned in this RIA to the December 2008 TVA Kingston 
TN impoundment release event.  Social cost represents the opportunity costs incurred by society, not just the monetary 
costs for cleanup.  OMB's 2003 "Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis" (page 18) instructs Federal agencies to estimate 
"opportunity costs" for purpose of valuing benefits and costs in RIAs.  This $3.0 billion social cost estimate is larger 
than TVA’s $933 million to $1.2 billion cleanup cost estimate (i.e., TVA’s estimate as of 03 Feb 2010), because 
EPA’s social cost estimate consists of three other social cost elements in addition to TVA’s cleanup cost estimate: (a) 
TVA cleanup cost, (b) response, oversight and ancillary costs associated with local, state, and other Federal agencies, 
(c) ecological damages, and (d) local (community) socio-economic damages.  Appendix Q to this RIA provides 
EPA's documentation and calculation of these four cost elements, which total $3.0 billion in social cost. Appendix Q 
to this RIA also provides an alternative, lower estimate of social costs, based on different modeling assumptions for 
capturing such costs. This alternative analysis suggests that TVA’s cleanup costs alone may be close to the social costs 
associated with the Kingston impoundment failure.  EPA specifically requests comment on this social cost estimate, 
and will continue to develop this estimate for the final rule. 

 
 
However, EIA data indicate that there is a current trend among coal-fired power plants to switch from wet handling to dry handling.  As seen 
below in Exhibit 5B-5, this will lead to a decrease of approximately 300,000 tons being disposed of in surface impoundments per year, or 
approximately 1.3% of the initial 22.5 million tons in 2005.  Since the tons disposed of (and similarly, the number of surface impoundments) 
likely relate to the number of releases, these decreases are accounted for by using 2005 wet tonnage as a benchmark and assuming the quantity 
of wet tonnage declines 300,000 tons per year.  The cost for each year is multiplied by the remaining percent still handled wet.

The final step in the calculation was to take the adjusted costs in each year and discount them by 3% and 7% to calculate the present value (PV) 
as displayed in Exhibit 5B-6 below.  A full table of year-by-year costs can be found in Appendix K11.  Approximately 97% of these costs 
result from catastrophic releases, and the remaining 3% result from significant releases.  It is important to note that no costs are attributed to 
2012-2014 as the rule will not be adopted and implemented until 2015.  However, all costs beginning in 2015 are assumed to be avoided under 
subtitle C.  Although facilities are given 5 years to phase out CCR impoundments under one of the proposed regulatory options, the other 
options require regular inspections of CCR impoundments to prevent catastrophic or significant releases.   
 
For a subtitle D approach, expect delayed compliance with the requirement that surface impoundments be lined and that existing unlined 
surface impoundments be closed if they aren’t lined when compared to compliance with the surface impoundment phaseout under subtitle C.  
Compliance will largely depend on the uncertainties of state regulations, the implementation of those regulations, and citizen suits. Also, since 
some facilities will line their surface impoundments instead of converting to dry handling, these facilities will continue to pose risks for 
catastrophic failure even though they may no longer require cleanup costs for groundwater contamination.  The percent of states with at least 
 

140 

some surface impoundment regulations, 48% as described in Appendix K9, is used as a proxy for the phase-out of existing impoundments.  
However, the 5.5% of those 48% that would retrofit with composite liners could still pose release risks.  This results in 45% of the subtitle C 
benefits being realized in subtitle D. 
 
For the subtitle D prime approach, existing impoundments will not need to be lined, but can continue to operate until they close.  Third-party 
inspections of surface impoundments would be required under this option, but it is difficult to predict the extent to which these inspections 
would actually occur and would decrease catastrophic failures.  In any case, the benefits of subtitle D prime would be less than those of subtitle 
D and greater than the baseline in terms of costs of catastrophic failures avoided.  Thus, EPA used the midpoint as a best-estimate of the 
effectiveness that these inspections would have, which results in 23% of the subtitle C benefits being realized in a subtitle D prime approach.

Step 4.  Account for Increasing CCR Impoundment Release Trend 
 
In Step 2 above, it was noted that the arrival rate of releases might violate the stationarity requirement for Poisson distributions.  This is due to 
the trend of increasing release frequency based on the aging structure of the earthen impoundments.  EPA attempted to discern whether a time 
trend was likely between releases and the average age of the surface impoundments.  First, EPA limited the universe to the 38 releases that had 
reported release dates within the past 15 years.  Next, the number of releases in 2009 was scaled up to account for the fact that the EPA mail 
survey questionnaires were returned by June of 2009.  Thus, the four releases in 2009 were scaled up by 12 months/6 months, or a factor of 2.  
Using commission age and only those releases for which a release year was known, EPA constructed the profile of releases in the years ranging 
from 1995 to 2009 displayed in Exhibit 5B-7 below.

As can be seen in the table above, both the absolute number of releases and the percent of units with releases have increased over the past 15 
years.  All five significant releases and the catastrophic release at TVA Kingston TN have happened since 2005.  To account for this potential 
lack of stationarity, EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis with alternate values of λ.  Instead of looking at the last 15 years, EPA assumed that 
the previous 5-year period best reflects impoundment releases.  Thus, in place of the earlier calculated lambda values (0.067 and 0.333) derived 
by dividing the number of catastrophic and significant failures between 1995 and 2009 by 15, EPA calculated higher lambdas (0.2 and 1) by 
dividing the catastrophic and significant failures between 2005 and 2009 by 5.  Using these new lambda values, but keeping the same 50-year 
forecast period, EPA derived the Poisson distribution seen in the two figures below.  The probability of a specific number of catastrophic or 
significant releases is illustrated in Exhibit 5B-8 and Exhibit 5B-9 (cumulative distribution) below.

With these new distributions, EPA performed the same calculations as described in Step 3.  The expected number of releases in Exhibit 5B-10 
below was divided by 50 to get releases per year; these releases were multiplied by the cost per release; an adjustment was made to account for 
voluntary switching to dry handling; and yearly values were discounted.  A full exhibit of year-by-year costs can be found in Appendix K11.

* Note: $3.0 billion is EPA’s initial “social cost” estimate assigned in this RIA to the December 2008 TVA Kingston 
TN impoundment release event.  Social cost represents the opportunity costs incurred by society, not just the 
monetary costs for cleanup.  OMB's 2003 "Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis" (page 18) instructs Federal agencies 
to estimate "opportunity costs" for purpose of valuing benefits and costs in RIAs.  This $3.0 billion social cost 
estimate is larger than TVA’s $933 million to $1.2 billion cleanup cost estimate (i.e., TVA’s estimate as of 03 Feb 
2010), because EPA’s social cost estimate consists of three other social cost elements in addition to TVA’s cleanup 
cost estimate: (a) TVA cleanup cost, (b) response, oversight and ancillary costs associated with local, state, and other 
Federal agencies, (c) ecological damages, and (d) local (community) socio-economic damages.  Appendix Q to this 
RIA provides EPA's documentation and calculation of these four cost elements, which total $3.0 billion in social 
cost.  Appendix Q to this RIA also provides an alternative, lower estimate of social costs, based on different 
modeling assumptions for capturing such costs. This alternative analysis suggests that TVA’s cleanup costs alone 
may be close to the social costs associated with the Kingston impoundment failure.  EPA specifically requests 
comment on this social cost estimate, and will continue to develop this estimate for the final rule. 

 
 
EPA estimated subtitle C (special waste) costs avoided that were between two and three times the costs predicted in Step 3.  This difference 
helps to explain how significant the assumption of lambda, and the potential non-stationarity of the data, can have on the final results.  
Sensitivity results were also calculated for subtitle D (version 2) and subtitle “D prime” approaches.  As assumed above for the subtitle D 
(version 2) option, EPA expects delayed compliance with the requirement that surface impoundments be lined and that existing unlined surface 
impoundments be closed if they are not lined when compared to compliance with the surface impoundment phaseout under subtitle C.  
Compliance will largely depend on the uncertainties of state regulations, the implementation of those regulations, and citizen suits. Also, since 
some facilities will line their surface impoundments instead of converting to dry handling, these facilities will continue to pose risks for 
catastrophic failure even though they may no longer require cleanup costs for groundwater contamination.  The percent of states with at least 
some surface impoundment regulations, 48% as described in Appendix K9, is used as a proxy for the phase-out of existing impoundments.  
However, the 5.5% of those 48% that would retrofit with composite liners could still pose release risks.  This results in 45% of the subtitle C 
(special waste) benefits being realized in Subtitle D (version 2). 
 

 

145 

For the subtitle “D prime” approach, existing impoundments will not need to be lined, but can continue to operate until they close.  Third-party 
inspections of surface impoundments would be required under this option, but it is difficult to predict the extent to which these inspections 
would actually occur and would decrease catastrophic failures.  In any case, the benefits of subtitle “D prime” would be less than those of 
subtitle D (version 2) and greater than the baseline in terms of costs of catastrophic failures avoided.  Thus, this RIA used the midpoint as a 
best-estimate of the effectiveness that these inspections would have.  This results in 23% of the subtitle C (special waste) benefits being 
realized in a subtitle “D prime” approach.  Exhibit 5B-11 below presents the avoided cleanup cost estimates for the three regulatory options 
(i.e., Subtitle C special waste, Subtitle D version 2, and Subtitle “D prime”).

Step 5.  Estimate Future Avoided Cleanup Costs for Two Alternative Impoundment Failure Scenarios (Scenario #2 & #3) 
 
Not all of these releases are likely to pose the type of catastrophic risks that were seen at TVA’s Kingston, TN plant.  Catastrophic releases are 
more likely where there is a high potential for impoundment materials to disperse over large areas.  This is most likely to occur at tall 
impoundments.  Thus, this RIA presents an alternative assumption that the Kinston-like catastrophic releases would only occur at these tall 
impoundments.  In addition, as age appears to be a driving factor in releases, this analysis also assumed that Kingston-like catastrophic releases 
would occur at older impoundments.  Particularly, 96 impoundments of the 584 covered in the 2009 EPA mail survey were at least 40 feet tall 
and at least 25 years old.  The analysis below assumes that 10% - 20% of these impoundments could fail within the next 20 years.  This is 
equivalent to the upper percentiles of failures predicted in Steps 3 and 4 above; however it moves the costs forward in time, to show the 
sensitivity of the benefits with respect to time.

Given the costs above, the total benefits of a Subtitle C phase out over 5 years would be the difference between the potential catastrophic 
failure costs under C and the catastrophic failure costs under the baseline.  For the 20% “Scenario #3”, this figure is double, as displayed below 
in Exhibit 5B-13.  For Subtitle D, it is assumed that the 48% of states (by tonnage, as described in Appendix K9) that have at least some 
regulatory oversight currently, would enforce the retrofitting requirement.  However, since 5.5% of impoundments already have composite 
liners, these units would not be expected to close.  Thus 94.5% times 48% leads to an approximately 45% of the Subtitle C benefits.  For 
Subtitle D prime, the requirement of dam safety inspections would be likely to result in some amount catastrophic failure reduction between the 
baseline and the Subtitle D approach.  This RIA uses the midpoint, a 23% reduction, as a best estimate.  While these estimates are likely much 
higher than the actual benefits from preventing catastrophic failures, they do help to define the upper bound of what is possible under current 
practices of mismanagement.

Induced Effect of RCRA Regulation on CCR Beneficial Use 

5C. 
This section assesses the potential effects of the different regulatory options for disposal of CCR on the future annual quantities of CCR 
beneficially used.  It also estimates the values of social and economic impacts associated with baseline and different levels of beneficial use.  It 
estimates the expected increase in beneficial use from increased cost of disposal of CCR and evaluates future changes in the beneficial use of 
coal combustion residuals (CCR) as a result of a potential “stigma” effect. 
 
 

5C1.  Baseline Environmental & Economic Benefits of CCR Beneficial Use by Other Industries 

 
According to CCR beneficial use market data compiled for year 2005 as displayed below in Exhibit 5C-1, and extrapolated in this RIA to 2009 
as displayed in Exhibit 5C-2 below, 62 million tons of annual CCR generated by 272 of the 495 electric utility plants is not disposed, but is 
beneficially used as material substitutes in at least 14 industrial applications.  The purpose of this section is to provide estimates of two 
categories of baseline benefits associated with baseline CCR beneficial use, consisting of five sub-elements (i.e., 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2c): 
 

Economic benefits estimated in this section are based on recent market prices and include: 
a.  Annual cost savings to over 14 CCR beneficial use industries in the form of reduced industrial raw and 

intermediate materials purchase prices relative to purchasing higher-priced substitute materials, compared 
to paying electric utility plants lower prices for buying and using CCR as an industrial material. 

b.  Cost savings to electric utility plants for avoiding the cost of disposing CCR which is beneficially used. 

Lifecycle benefits as quantified in this RIA are based on market or social values assigned to the relative 
physical consequences of using CCR compared to substitute industrial materials, through the entire “materials 
flow” chain of the national economy which consists of five basic stages (1. raw materials extraction, 2. 
materials processing, 3. industrial manufacturing, 4. product use, 5. product end-of-lifespan 
disposal/recycling).  Three lifecycle physical consequences are quantified in this RIA but not all monetized: 
a.  Lifecycle resource consumption savings (water & energy consumption) 
b.  Lifecycle air pollution emissions (GHG, CO, NOx, SOx, PM, Hg, Pb) 
c.  Lifecycle wastes (wastewaters and solid wastes) 
Lifecycle benefits in this RIA are only based on three categories of CCR beneficial uses (i.e., concrete, 
cement, and wallboard representing a sub-total of 58% of all CCR beneficial uses) which were addressed in 
the prior 2008 study134 used as a reference for this section of the RIA.

Lifecycle benefits encompass economic benefits so these two categories are not additive but duplicative.  Lifecycle benefits in this RIA are 
based on “lifecycle analysis” (LCA), a method which involves estimating both internalized (e.g., market priced) and externalized (e.g., costs 
not captured in market prices) material flow consequences: 
 

“Life cycle analysis depicts the production of materials in a system of complex physical outcomes, and can predict the 
incremental physical consequences of a change in material inputs, technology, waste management practices, or price incentives.  
In LCA, as in reality, one change in the physical system, such as the substitution of fly ash for virgin Portland cement, leads to a 
corresponding cascade of economy-wide impacts and shifts.  As inputs are substituted, technologies, physical outputs, and 
exposure pathways change.  Using a range of modeling platforms and life cycle inventories to calculate the outputs associated 
with each incremental change, LCA calculates the net result of all of these interactions, capturing the total incremental effect of 
a change in operations on physical environmental impacts such as air emissions, and energy and water use.” 

 
 

•  Economic Benefits of CCR Beneficial Use 

 
As estimated in Exhibit 5C-1 below (Column F), CCR used for beneficial use applications has an estimated annual US market value of $177 
million per-year based on annual CCR sales revenue data supplied by 233 electric utility plants to the 2005 EIA-767 database, updated in this 
RIA to 2009.  Based on comparison with the average higher prices for substitute industrial materials, using lower-priced CCR provides the US 
national economy with $2,300 million in annual net cost savings compared to the higher $2,477 million annual cost of substitute materials in 
these 14 industrial applications (see Column I of Exhibit 5C-1).

•  Lifecycle Benefits Associated with CCR Beneficial Use 

 
The baseline (2005) material cost savings estimate displayed in Exhibit 5C-1 above is adjusted below to exclude the mining applications use, 
because mine-filling is not covered in the proposed rule.135  As displayed in Exhibit 5C-4 below, subtracting 2.3% of the mining applications 
beneficial use category decreased the baseline CCR beneficial use from 49.6 million tons to 48.5 million tons (relative to 2005).

From a materials lifecycle analysis perspective, CCR beneficial use generates net environmental benefits.  Based on a 2008 life cycle study136 
of two of the 14 CCR beneficial use industrial applications (i.e., concrete and wallboard) there are 12 environmental benefit categories with the 
annual magnitudes estimated below in Exhibit 5C-5.  This estimate of environmental benefits is based on only 47% (i.e., 23.2 million tons) of 
the 49.62 million tons for the 2005 CCR beneficial use market as reported in that 2008 study.  Thus, these estimates may understate annual 
environmental benefits of CCR beneficial uses.  These net benefits are not additive to the economic benefits, but encompass them. 
 

                                                 
135 As noted in the Federal Register notice of EPA’s proposed CCR rule, minefilling will be addressed in an alternate rulemaking. 
136 Source: Exhibit 5-3 of “Waste and Materials-Flow Benchmark Sector Report: Beneficial Use of Secondary Materials – Coal Combustion Products,” prepared by 
Industrial Economics Inc for the EPA Office of Solid Waste, 12 Feb 2008, 95 pages at http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/c2p2/pubs/benuse07.pdf

To avoid double-counting of economic and social benefits, EPA evaluated the monetization of the energy, water, and air pollution-related 
impacts for any such double counting.  Based on this evaluation, this RIA concludes that each of the individual monetized estimates for these 
impacts are fully additive and do not double count benefits, with one exception regarding partial overlap between energy cost savings and the 
value of avoided SOx air emissions.  For SOx, where there exists a cap and trade permit program, firms must pay to emit SOx.  A portion of the 
SOx emissions avoided from beneficially using CCR is from the energy sector.  Under the presumption that the marginal costs of abatement 
equal the value of marginal damages, the value of the portion of SOx emissions from the energy sector will be reflected in the energy cost 
savings.  The portion of avoided SOx emissions that comes from sectors other than energy is not reflected in energy cost savings and thus 
should be retained.   However, separately adding a value for reduced SOx emissions likely represents some amount of double counting.   

 

Unlike the SOx permit program, most regulation of NOx and particulate matter (PM) does not require firms to purchase permits to pollute.  
Thus there is little to no overlap between the external costs of these air pollutants and energy costs.  In addition, aside from limited state 
programs, GHG damages are not currently regulated and would not be reflected in the market price for energy.  Thus, the benefits from NOx, 
particulates and GHG reductions are fully additive to private energy cost savings.  Furthermore, for water use, the only benefits included are 
the direct cost savings, and because the water savings in these cases are not associated with energy production, these savings are not being 
captured elsewhere.  Reduced water use in the production process is a real cost savings that should be a component of total benefits. 
 
Therefore, this RIA concludes that there is only a partial double counting between energy cost savings and the savings associated with reduced 
SOx emissions.  No other beneficial use benefits categories are affected by this double counting issue.  Thus, Exhibit 5C-5 below has 
subtracted the $1,491 million benefits attributable to SOx reductions from the environmental benefits estimate, resulting in an environmental 
estimate of $22,980 million per year, or $474 per ton average lifecycle benefit, assigning zero values to tonnage other than concrete and 
wallboard.  In addition to baseline lifecycle benefits, there are an estimated $2,927 million per year in baseline avoided disposal cost benefits 
to the electric utility industry (i.e., (49.61 million tons CCR beneficial use in 2005) x ($59 per ton average baseline disposal cost estimated in 
Exhibit 3L of this RIA)), which constitutes a total of $25,907 million per year (relative to 2005 CCR beneficial use tonnage), which is an 
average of $533 per ton nationwide baseline social benefits from CCR beneficial use.

5C2.  Potential Effect of RCRA Regulation of CCR Disposal on CCR Beneficial Use 

 
Under the proposed regulation, the Bevill exemption still applies to quantities of CCR directed to certain beneficial uses so that these quantities 
do not face increased disposal costs associated with Subtitle C or D regulation of disposed CCR.  The increased costs of disposal of CCR as a 
result of their regulation under RCRA subtitle C will create a strong economic and regulatory incentive for increased beneficial uses of CCR.  
In fact, EPA concludes that the increased costs of disposal of CCR under subtitle C of RCRA, but not the beneficial use of CCR, will actually 
increase their usage in non-regulated beneficial uses, simply as a result of the economics of supply and demand.  The economic driver - 
availability of a low-cost, functionally equivalent or often superior substitute for other raw materials - will continue to make CCR an 
increasingly desirable product.  Furthermore, it has been EPA’s experience in the RCRA hazardous waste regulations and elsewhere that 
material inevitably flows to less regulated applications. 
 
On the other hand, industry and state government stakeholders have asserted in letters to EPA, that regulation of CCR as a RCRA “hazardous 
waste” will impose a “stigma” on CCR beneficial use which will significantly curtail these uses.  In their view, even an action that regulates 
only the disposal of CCR in landfills or surface impoundments as hazardous waste, but retains the Bevill exemption for beneficial uses, would 
have this effect.  Also, the states particularly have argued that, by operation of state law, the beneficial use of CCR would be prohibited under 
many states’ beneficial use programs, if EPA were to designate CCR as a hazardous waste when disposed. 
 
The purpose of this section of the RIA is to quantify both possibilities – i.e., an induced increase (Scenario #1) and an induced decrease 
(Scenario #2) -- in future CCR beneficial use, and to explain the basis for this RIA selecting the former (Scenario #1) as the “base case.” 
 

•  Examples of Hazardous Waste Recycling Success Not “Stigma” 

 
EPA’s past experiences with the impacts of RCRA regulation, and with how RCRA industrial hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials 
are used and recycled, suggests that a “hazardous waste” designation of industrial secondary materials and wastes, does not impose a 
significant barrier to its beneficial use (e.g., recycling), and that non-regulated uses generally increase as the costs of regulated disposal 
increase.  As summarized below, EPA’s experience has shown that the economic incentive of a high disposal cost has outweighed any 
hypothetical stigma effect in case after case of hazardous waste recycling.  Six examples listed below illustrate the point that a RCRA 
“hazardous waste” designation does not stand in the way of a material’s (or waste’s) subsequent industrial recycling or reuse as a raw or 
intermediate material: 
 

1.  Electric arc furnace dust:  RCRA hazardous waste (waste code = K061), and yet it is a highly recycled material.  Specifically, between 

2001 and 2007, approximately 42% to 51% of K061 was recycled as evidenced by Biennial Reporting System (BRS) data.  Both 
currently and historically, K061 has been used as an ingredient in fertilizer, an input in making steel, and in the production of zinc 
products, including pharmaceutical materials.   Slag from the smelting of K061 is in high demand for use in road construction.  The use 
of slag is regulated under Pennsylvania’s beneficial use program, despite the fact that it is derived from a listed hazardous waste.  In 
fact, there is little doubt that, without its regulation as a hazardous waste, a significantly greater amount of K061 would be diverted 
from recycling to disposal in non-hazardous landfills. 

 

157 

2.  Electroplating wastewater sludge:  Listed hazardous waste (F006) that is recycled for its copper, zinc, and nickel content for use in the 
commercial market.  In 2007, approximately 35% of F006 material was recycled according to BRS data.  These materials are clearly in 
no way stigmatized in the marketplace. 

3.  Chat:  Superfund cleanup waste with lead contamination is used in road construction in Oklahoma and the surrounding areas.  In this 
case, the very waste that has triggered an expensive Superfund cleanup is successfully offered in the marketplace as a raw material in 
road building.  The alternative costs of disposal in this case are a significant driver in the beneficial use of this material, and the 
Superfund origin of the material has not prevented its use. 

4.  Used oil:  Frequently a hazardous waste if disposed of, and is regulated under the RCRA subtitle C standards.   While used oil that is 

recycled is subject to a separate set of standards under subtitle C (and is not identified as a hazardous waste), “stigma” does not prevent 
home do-it-yourselfers from collecting used oil, or automotive shops from accepting it and sending it on for recovery.  Collected used 
oil may be re-refined, reused, or used as a fuel in boilers, often at the site where it is collected.   One large commercial used oil handler 
reports managing 500 million gallons of used oil a year. 

5.  Spent etchants:  Directly used as ingredients in the production of a copper micronutrient for livestock. 
6.  Spent solvents:  Generated from metals parts washing are directly used in the production of roofing shingles. 

 
And in all such cases, these materials are generally RCRA hazardous wastes before reclamation.  Many materials widely used in homes today 
can be classified as “hazardous” materials, and many come with warning labels.  For example, motor oil comes with warning labels.  Gasoline 
would be a characteristic hazardous waste if disposed of, as would many common drain cleaners and household cleaners.  Cathode ray tube 
monitors for TVs and computers, as well as many fluorescent lamps are all hazardous wastes if disposed of.  Fluorescent lamps (and CFLs) are 
potentially hazardous when disposed of because of mercury.  Mercury is an indispensable resource, and virtually all of the mercury used for 
lamps and other uses in the U.S. is derived from discarded mercury or mercury products – that is, from hazardous waste.  Even products as 
unlikely as nicotine gum or dental amalgam would be a hazardous waste when disposed of.  Consumers are generally comfortable with these 
products, and their regulatory status does not discourage their use. 
 

•  Differing Views About Prospect of Future “Stigma” 

 
Stakeholders have also expressed the concern that standards-setting organizations might prohibit the use of CCR in specific products or 
materials in their voluntary standards.  Recently, the American Standards and Testing Materials (ASTM) International Committee C09, and its 
subcommittee, C09.24, in a December 23, 2009 letter to EPA indicated that ASTM would remove fly ash from the project specifications in its 
concrete standard if EPA determined that CCR were a hazardous waste.  However, ASTM standards are developed through an open consensus 
process, and current standards cover the use of numerous hazardous materials in construction and other activities.  For example, ASTM 
provides specifications for the reuse of solvents and thus, by implication, does not appear to take issue with the use of these recycled wastes, 
despite their classification as hazardous wastes.137 
 

                                                 
137 For example, see ASTM Volume 15.05, Engine Coolants, Halogenated Organic Solvents and Fire Extinguishing Agents; Industrial and Specialty Chemicals, at  or 
ASTM D5396 - 04 Standard Specification for Reclaimed Perchloroethylene. 
 

158 

Others take a different view on how standard-setting organizations will react.  Most notably, a US Green Building Council representative has 
been quoted in the New York Times as saying that LEED incentives for using fly ash in concrete would remain in place, even under an EPA 
hazardous determination.  If the Green Building Council (along with EPA) continues to recognize fly ash as an environmentally beneficial 
substitute for Portland cement, EPA believes that the use of this material is unlikely to decrease solely because of “stigma” concerns.   

 

 

In addition, Congress directed government agencies to increase their purchase of recycled-content products.  Specifically, section 6002 of 
RCRA requires EPA to designate products that can be made with recovered materials and to recommend practices for buying these products.  
Once a product is designated, “procuring agencies” 138 are required to purchase it with the highest recovered material content level practicable 
if they spend more than $10,000 a year on that item.  EPA’s federal Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPG), requiring the use of fly ash 
in cement for federally funded projects, would remain in place.  Thus, any federal, state, or local agency carrying out federally funded 
construction projects would continue to be required to give a preference to fly ash as a Portland cement replacement.  

Finally, many state governments have argued that their statutes or regulations prohibit the use of hazardous wastes in their state beneficial use 
programs, and therefore that, if EPA lists CCR as a hazardous waste (even if only for disposal), their use would be precluded in those states.  
EPA has reviewed the regulations of 10 states with the highest consumption of fly ash and/or cement and concluded that while these states do 
not allow the use of hazardous waste in their beneficial use programs, CCR that are beneficially reused will remain Bevill-exempt solid wastes, 
or in some cases, would not be considered wastes at all and thus, the continued use of CCR under these programs should not be affected by the 
proposed CCR rule.  For EPA’s summary of 10 state government CCR beneficial use regulations, see Appendix K12.  For the above reasons, 
this RIA presents the increased future CCR beneficial use (Scenario #1) as the “base case.”  However, this RIA monetizes both scenarios (i.e., 
induced increase and induced “stigma” decrease) using the following 10-step method. 
 
Step 1.  Project Future Annual Tonnage CCR Generation 
 
To estimate the levels of CCR beneficial use, the first task was to project the future annual tonnage of CCR generated by the electric utility 
industry.  The amount of CCR is likely to increase proportionally, as utilities comply with new Clean Air Act requirements.  Not reflecting this 
proportional increase, this RIA relied on the EIA future forecast for coal burned by the electric utility industry.139  As displayed in Exhibit 5C-
6 below, the EIA data extends out to the year 2035.  However, to remain consistent with the other cost and benefit estimates, this RIA extended 
this trend out to the year 2061 based on regression-fit extrapolation using the following first-order regression of coal burned as dependent 
variable against year as independent variable: 

                                                 
138 Procuring agencies include all federal agencies, and any state or local agency or government contractor that uses appropriated federal funds. 
139 Source: Based on 2007 to 2035 annual short tons coal consumption by electric power sector forecast data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), “Year-by-
Year Reference Case Tables (2008-2035): Table 15 Coal Supply, Disposition, and Prices” from the report “Annual Energy Outlook 2010 Early Release,” December 14, 
2009 at http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo.  The EIA report presents a midterm projection and analysis of US energy supply, demand, and prices through 2035, based on the 
EIA’s National Energy Modeling System.  Further information on the EIA’s projections is available at

Based on the most recent CCR beneficial use data from ACAA, EPA estimated the average tons of CCR generated for every ton of coal burned 
by electric utility plants.  For this calculation, this RIA only used the most recent data year (2008) to estimate a conversion rate because over 
time, the quantities of CCR generated per ton of coal combusted has steadily increased.  Thus an average of recent years would not reflect this 
trend.  The steady increase over time is due to tightening of industrial air pollution regulations.  This trend would likely continue in the future 
as further facilities undergo new source review, or implement new Clean Air Act requirements under upcoming EPA rules like the Clean Air 
Interstate Rule (CAIR) and the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR).  Thus, the future annual tonnages of CCR estimated in this RIA are likely 
under-estimates.  Dividing the 2008 tons of CCR generated (136 million tons) by the 2008 tons of coal burned by the electric power sector 
(1,042 million tons), EPA produced a CCR-to-coal relationship factor of 0.131.  Applying this factor to the extrapolated coal consumption 
projection produced the future CCR generation scenario displayed below in Exhibit 5C-9.

Appendix K5 to this RIA presents alternative estimates of future CCR generation.  These estimates take into account the recent increasing 
trend in the ratio of tons CCR generated to the tons coal combustion.  For example, in year 2035 the constant ratio projection above yields a 
value of 153 million tons CCR generated whereas the increasing ratio projection in Appendix K5 yields a value of 191 million tons of CCR 
generated.  While the exact magnitude of such an increase is uncertain, there would be at least some increase as a result of increased air 
pollution controls.  These include future changes due to EPA’s New Source Review (NSR), EPA’s Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), and 
EPA’s Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR).

Step 2.  Project Future Baseline Annual Tonnage CCR Beneficial Use (Without RCRA Regulation) 
 
This step involves projecting the extent to which CCR would be beneficially used in the absence of the proposed RCRA regulation of CCR 
disposal (i.e., future baseline CCR beneficial use).  Exhibit 5C-10 below displays the recent (i.e., 2001 to 2008) trend in annual tonnage of 
CCR beneficial use, and as a percentage relative to annual CCR generation by the electric utility industry.

If the recent trends in CCR generation and CCR beneficial use continued in a linear fashion, more than 100% of CCR would be beneficially 
used before year 2061.  Furthermore, a linear extrapolation for beneficial use would not be appropriate because as more and more CCR is used, 
it would likely become increasingly difficult to use the remaining CCR due to saturation of local markets, competition between CCR 
generators, and other factors, depending on overall macro-economic factors.  Thus, for purpose of extrapolation to the 50-year period-of-
analysis (2012 to 2061), this RIA instead modeled the recent trend data as an asymptotic, exponential function of the form:

Beneficial uses of CCR have been consistently growing in the recent past.  Since the percent of CCR beneficially used has been growing, EPA 
sought to characterize that trend so that the future percent beneficially used could be applied to the future tons of CCR.  The ACAA data from 
2001 to 2008 indicate that this trend was increasing.  After running several regressions, EPA disposed of the typical trend fits for various 
reasons.  A first-order (linear) trend line was abandoned because it would have led to beneficial use above 100% well within the time-frame of 
the analysis.  Higher order regressions led to oddities where beneficial use would trend away from 100% at some point in time.  Once typical 
fits were ruled out, EPA assumed that CCR beneficial use would not exceed 100% of CCR generated.140  Instead, it would potentially become 
more and more difficult to use CCR as a higher percent went to beneficial uses, because of market limitations.  Thus, it made sense to use an 
exponential curve that approached, but never crossed an asymptote of 100% beneficial use. 

To fit an exponential curve to the 2001 to 2008 CCR beneficial use data, a spreadsheet calculation solver was programmed to minimize the 
residual sum of squares between the actual and projected percent of CCR beneficial use by changing the regression equation variables B, C, 
and D.  From solver result, B was set to 1.021, C was set to 1.369, and D was set to 13.99.  Using these values, the future CCR beneficial use 
projection as measured on a percentage basis relative to CCR generation were estimated, as displayed in Exhibit 5C-11 and Exhibit 5C-12 
below.  The percentage of CCR beneficially used under the baseline (i.e., without RCRA regulation) is expected to gradually approach, but 
never reach 100% of CCR generation.  By 2061 at the end of the 50-year period-of-analysis, 88% of CCR would be beneficially used under this 
projection.  While this is a relatively high number, current experiences in at least one US state and in at least 16 other countries (i.e., 15 
European countries + Japan), already demonstrate that very high CCR beneficial use rates of 90% and above are achievable: 
 

1.  Wisconsin:  Several companies are developing technologies to convert CCR into bricks used in construction, and one such technology 
was recently commercialized in Wisconsin.141  Some of these technologies have the potential for using 100% CCR (fly ash) in brick 
production, as opposed to the conventional 30%-50% limit for replacing Portland cement in concrete. 

2.  Europe:  As of 2007, 15 European countries reported a CCR beneficial use rate of 89% (i.e., 55.449 million metric tons beneficially 

used in 2007 in 24 industrial applications, out of the 62.094 million metric tons generated in 2007).142 

3.  Japan:  As of 2006, Japan reported a CCR beneficial use rate of 97% (i.e., 10.657 million tons used in Japan in 2006 for 3 cement 

applications, 6 civil engineering applications, 3 construction applications, 2 agriculture/forestry/fisheries applications, and at least three 
other miscellaneous applications, out of the 10.969 million tons CCR generated in Japan in 2006).143 

                                                 
140 The fact that some electric utility plants currently excavate previously disposed CCR for supplying to beneficial use markets suggests this may be a limiting assumption 
which could underestimate future potential growth of CCR beneficial use.  For example, one electric utility company reported a 106% CCR beneficial use rate in 2006 for 
its four electricity plants because it recovered CCR that it had previously disposed.

Step 3.  Estimate Potential Induced Effect of RCRA Regulation on CCR Beneficial Use 
 
After establishing a future baseline of CCR beneficial use annual tonnage, this step involved formulating three alternative scenarios whereby 
future CCR beneficial use under RCRA regulation of CCR disposal could either: 
 

o  Scenario #1: Increase in beneficial use 
o  Scenario #2: Decrease 
o  Scenario #3: Remain unchanged from baseline 

 

 

Increases due to increased disposal costs were estimated first and constitute the “base case” of this RIA.  By increasing disposal costs, electric 
utility plants face an “avoided disposal cost incentive” to ship their CCR farther for beneficial uses by other industries; that is, utilities would be 
willing to pay more transportation costs to avoid the higher disposal costs.  Thus, RCRA regulation of CCR disposal would likely open new 
markets at farther transport distances, or increase purchases by existing markets.  The effect of this stimulus would be to increase CCR 
beneficial use.  The concept of “avoided disposal cost incentive” is recognized and defined by the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) on 
its website as follows: 
 

“If a [coal-fired electric utility] plant markets its [CCR] into commercial applications, then disposal of this [CCR] is not 
required.  Not only is a revenue stream created for the [coal-fired electricity plant] but also the need to dispose of the [CCR] is 
avoided.  As discussed above, disposal is not just the transportation and placement of [CCR] in a disposal site.  The need for 
future space is a concern.  If [CCR is] marketed, then the need to develop future [CCR disposal] sites (including land 
acquisition, permitting, design and construction costs) is avoided ….  It is not uncommon for a company to help offset the costs 
of transportation or placement at construction sites by providing the contractor or trucking firm a payment of some sort.  For 
example, if the cost of disposal at a plant is normally four dollars a ton, then the company may arrange a payment of four 
dollars or less to the contractors to cover transportation and placement costs.  The difference between the amount of this 
payment and the cost of disposal is also referred to as “avoided disposal costs.”  Source: ACAA Frequently Asked Question nr. 
14 webpage at: http://acaa.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=5#Q14 

 
On the other hand, some stakeholders have claimed that a Subtitle C “hazardous waste” approach would have a “stigma” effect on CCR, 
reducing their use.  That is, due to the label of “hazardous waste,” some purchasers of CCR might opt to turn down the CCR for more 
expensive substitutes in fear that the CCR might either harm their sales or create liability, and generators might be reluctant to provide the 
material to users because of liability concerns.  The final alternative, that beneficial use quantities remain the same, results in no net costs or 
benefits for the Subtitle C approach because it is assumed that the baseline trend plays out the same as it would absent a rule.  Thus, no further 
analysis of this option was necessary. 

 

The two alternative Scenario analyses (i.e., Scenario #1, Scenario #2) in this section build upon the ACAA’s historical CCR beneficial use 
data.144  ACAA data on the beneficial use was modified to remove the use of CCR in minefilling applications because the proposed rule does 
not address minefilling operations.  Excluding 100% of the ACAA reported quantity of CCR used in minefilling results in a reduction of 1.13 
million tons per year in the amount beneficially used.  As a result, the 2005 quantity of beneficial use relied upon for our analyses is 48.5 
million tons per year of CCR, rather than the original 49.6 million tons per year reported by ACAA.

4th MFL stage:  Recycling, waste management 
 

Step 4:  Estimate Potential Induced Increase in Future CCR Beneficial Use (Scenario #1) 
 
Under the assumptions and numerical framework described below, this RIA estimates that the Subtitle C option would initially induce an 
increase of 28% in CCR beneficial uses.  This growth estimate is a generalized, aggregate estimate across all 15 existing CCR beneficial use 
markets.  Due to a lack of available data (i.e., market location, elasticity, cross-elasticity, etc.), this estimate does not take into account unique 
economic supply or economic demand conditions in any single market or for any particular beneficial use, relative to the generalized aggregate 
estimate.  However, key uses, such as use of fly ash as a Portland cement replacement, have great opportunity for increased use, far above 28% 
in the initial year.  For example, if fly ash use in concrete increased to a 30% replacement rate for Portland cement (a very reasonable 
replacement rate, consistent with current specifications), fly ash usage could increase by more than 100% from the 14 million tons used 
annually at current replacement rates of 10% to 12%.  One of the main barriers to this increase usage is transportation costs.  Because EPA did 
not have specific data on this market, this RIA does not specifically quantify it; however, it is exactly the type of use that increased disposal 
costs could foster. 

The method presented below may be characterized as a "Raw Material Cost Method" which represents the 1st stage of the generalized 4-stage 
materials flow lifecycle (MFL) through the economy.  This 4-stage MFL conceptual framework has been integrated into existing cost modeling 
software systems145 used by government agencies and the private sector, and consists of the following four material flow cradle-to-grave or 
cradle-to-cradle stages: 

This method evaluates the difference in raw material acquisition cost under two alternative conditions.  The first condition (Baseline) represents 
current conditions without RCRA regulation of CCR disposal.  The second condition (Subtitle C) represents future conditions with RCRA 
regulation for CCR disposed by electric utilities. 
 
The economic mechanism in this estimation method, which affects different raw material acquisition costs under the two alternative conditions, 
is the “avoided disposal cost incentive” described above.  In other words, it is the avoided disposal cost under RCRA regulation compared to 
the industry’s baseline disposal cost.  This difference in cost is an incremental cost relative to baseline.  From an economic standpoint, this 
represents an incremental economic incentive to electric utility plants to reduce or eliminate CCR disposal, thereby reducing or avoiding new 
regulatory compliance costs by increasing their future annual supply of CCR to beneficial use markets.  This “avoided disposal cost incentive” 
induced by RCRA regulation has already been anticipated in 2009 by at least one CCR beneficial use industry (bold face added for emphasis):

“Using [coal] fly ash in building materials is nothing new, as it’s already incorporated in products including Portland cement 
and asphalt concrete. However, it’s estimated that 65 percent of fly ash from coal-fired power plants worldwide goes to 
landfills, with the U.S. reporting a slightly lower 57 percent, according to the American Coal Ash Association.  Kane said the 
key to CalStar’s products is that they offer the same performance as aesthetics as traditional bricks, but without the energy use. 
Currently, the cost to buy a ton of fly ash in the U.S. ranges from about $5 to $30, but that could change as fly ash disposal 
faces tighter government restrictions, he said. “The cost to send fly ash to landfills will go up, and utilities will be faced with 
finding the most beneficial use,” Kane said.”146 

 
The baseline average “raw material acquisition cost” is $94.50/ton, consisting of CCR price, CCR disposal cost, and CCR transportation cost: 
 

1.  CCR price:  Price paid to electric utility plants by beneficial use industries for the purchase of CCR.  ACAA identifies 15 industrial 

beneficial use markets involving the beneficial use of CCR, many of which involve the construction industry.147  The average price paid 
by these industries to electric utility plants is $3.00 per ton, across a reported range of $0 to $45 per ton.148 

2.  CCR disposal cost:  Cost to the electric utility industry for disposing CCR.  This factor also represents the “avoided disposal cost 

incentive” in the sense that this is an “avoided cost” to the electric utility industry for CCR tonnages beneficially used by other 
industries.  A unitized “total cost” ($ per ton) for CCR disposal consisting of both a 50-year amortized capital cost for CCR disposal 
units plus a 50-year amortized O&M costs for CCR disposal is used to monetize this cost factor.149  The average baseline CCR disposal 
cost is $59/ton (source: Exhibit 3L).  This is additive to the “CCR price” element because it represents a subsidy by electricity plants. 

3.  CCR transport cost:  Average one-way CCR transport distance between electric utility plants and their CCR beneficial use customer 

industries.  This method does not explicitly distinguish whether the transport cost is paid by the electric utility plants or by the 
beneficial use industries.150  Average CCR transport cost from electric utility plants to beneficial use sites is estimated at 
($0.26/mile/ton)151 x (125 miles)152 = $32.50/ton.

147 ACAA lists 15 beneficial use markets: concrete, cement, flowable fill, structural fill/embankments, road base/sub-base, soil modification, mineral filler in asphalt, 
snow/ice control, blasting grit/roofing granules, mining applications, gypsum panel products, waste stabilization/solidification, agriculture, construction aggregate, and 
miscellaneous uses. 
148 $3 per-ton CCR price is from Column E of Exhibit 5C-1; this price represents the tonnage-weighted average across a reported price range of $0 to $45 per ton CCR. 
149 Although in the short-run (< 3 years), marginal business decisions may be made relative to short-term O&M costs, long-term (> 3 years) business decisions usually 
consider both amortized capital costs and O&M costs. 
150 The CCR price data used to monetize the CCR price factor above are reportedly based on “FOB” prices which may include some portion of transport cost (e.g., transport 
vehicle loading to a trans-shipment location).

Beneficial Use of Fly Ash as a Substitute for Portland Cement in Ready-Mix Concrete Production,” EPA Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR), 19 June 
2009, page 11.

In comparison to these baseline “raw materials acquisition cost” elements, CCR disposal costs are estimated to be $83/ton for the Subtitle C 
option (source: Exhibit 4K).  While this represents a 44% increase ($26/ton) over the baseline disposal cost of $59/ton, this ignores the CCR 
price and the transportation cost elements.  Factoring these components in, the $26/ton increase represents a 28% increase above the total 
baseline raw material cost of $94.50/ton.  This RIA applies this 28% growth factor to represent demand elasticity153 assumptions of: 
 

+0.64 with respect to the CCR “avoided disposal cost incentive” factor (i.e., +28%/+44%). 
+1.00 with respect to total “raw material acquisition cost” consisting of all three cost factors included (i.e., +28%/+28%). 

 
This RIA applies the elasticity estimate of 1.0 in reference to the “raw material acquisition cost” to represent the potential increase in CCR 
beneficial use by 28% over the baseline under the Subtitle C option.  The other regulatory options are proportionately adjusted below.  In 
comparison to historical annual percentage changes in CCR beneficial use tonnages, this 28% increase is a reasonable assumption as it falls 
between the -22.6% decrease and +55.2% increase min-max range (annual mean = +8.2% increase) over the 43 year period 1966 to 2008,154 as 
displayed in Exhibit 5C-14 below.

153 In economics, the elasticity of supply indicates the responsiveness of the quantity of a product or service supplied to the market relative to a change in its price (i.e., (% 
change in quantity supplied) / (% change in its price)).  Similarly, the elasticity of demand indicates the responsiveness of the quantity of market demand for a product or 
service relative to a change in its price (i.e., (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in its price)).

This is a limiting analysis because it does not include other developments that may be expected increasingly to push CCR to beneficial use: 
 

1.  Aspects of the proposed CCR rule: This analysis does not take into account that some RCRA regulatory options for CCR disposal 
require electricity plants to move to dry management of CCR, either through changes to air pollution control strategies or through 
drying of CCR after they have been generated.  This will make the material more amenable to beneficial uses. 

2.  The analysis is based on current market conditions: It does not take into account new technologies and products now being developed, 
for example, involving the use of CCR in brick construction.155   An increased “avoided disposal cost incentive” could be a great boon 
to such new beneficial use technologies, applications, and products. 

 
 

•  Comparison of “Raw Materials Acquisition Cost Method” to “Travel Cost Method” 

 
The method applied above involved three cost components of the “raw material acquisition cost,” not just in relation to the transportation cost 
component, which is relatively narrower approach that can be called a “Transportation Cost Method.”  Compared to this other method, the raw 
material acquisition cost method provides a smaller estimate of effect because the incremental cost is evaluated relative to a broader set of costs 
thereby translating numerically into a smaller percentage change, rather than relative to only one cost factor which would translate into a 
relatively larger percentage change.  This methodological difference may be illustrated by using the calculation numbers applied above, to only 
the transportation cost factor.  Using a simplistic transportation distance model which uses the CCR disposal unit cost ($ per ton) to determine 
the average circular radius of a CCR transportation market between electricity utility plant suppliers of CCR and their beneficial users 
customers, the increase in transport distance would be calculated as follows (relative to the 2005 49.6 million tons CCR beneficially used as 
reported by the ACAA): 
 

•  Baseline transportation cost (without CCR rule) 

($0.26/mile/ton) x (125 miles one-way average CCR transport distance) x (49.6 million tons/year beneficial use in 2005) = $1,612 
million/year transport cost 

•  Hypothetical new transportation cost (with rule) 

Transport subsidy equivalency = ($85/ton avoided disposal cost under rule) – ($59/ton avoided disposal cost without rule) = $26/ton 
subsidy equivalency 
(49.6 million tons/year beneficial use) x ($26/ton subsidy equivalency) = $1,290 million per year subsidy equivalency 

•  Hypothetical new transport distance: 

[($1,612 million/year) + ($1,290 million/year)] / (49.6 million tons per year beneficial use) / ($0.26/mile/ton) = 225 miles 
Percentage increase in transport distance: 
[(225 miles) – (125 miles)] / (125 miles) = 80% increase in radial transport distance 

                                                 
155 Several companies are developing technologies to convert CCR into bricks used in construction, and one such technology was recently commercialized at a power plant 
in Wisconsin.  Some of these technologies have the potential for using 100% CCR (fly ash) in brick production, as opposed to the conventional 30%-50% limit for 
replacing Portland cement in concrete. 
 

174 

•  Hypothetical expansion of CCR customer delivery area: 

Baseline customer area @125 miles radial transport distance = (3.1415 x (125 miles)^2) = 
Expanded customer area @225 miles radial transport distance = (3.1415 x (225 miles)^2) = 
Incremental increase in customer area = (159,000 – 49,100 sq. miles) / (49,100 sq.miles) = 

49,100 square miles 
159,000 square miles 
124% increase in delivery area 

 
 
Step 5:  Estimate Hypothetical “Stigma” Decrease in Future CCR Beneficial Use (Scenario #2) 
 
A number of industry and state government stakeholders have asserted to the EPA, that designating CCR as a hazardous waste (even if the 
designation is only applicable to those CCR that are disposed of) would create a “stigma” that would reduce or curtail or eliminate the 
beneficial use of CCR.   This RIA presents an alternative stigma effect scenario in an effort to evaluate what countervailing impact that 
“stigma” may have on the increased beneficial use of CCR estimated in this RIA above.  This potential reduction scenario assumes different 
potential impacts in three categories of beneficial CCR usage (uses covered in the CPGs, consolidated uses, and unconsolidated uses).  For 
documentation of the calculations discussed in this section, see Appendix K13. 

 
•  “Stigma” on CCR in Consolidated Uses Specified in Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines 
 

First, some uses for CCR involve the production of specific products that are expressly covered by the federal Comprehensive Procurement 
Guidelines (CPGs), which require procuring agencies that spend more than $10,000 a year on an item to buy products containing recovered 
materials.  Procuring agencies are federal, state, and local agencies, and their contractors, that use appropriated federal funds. For example, if a 
county agency spends more than $10,000 a year on an EPA-designated item and part of that money is from appropriated federal funds, then the 
agency must purchase that item made from recovered materials.156  As such, if there were any impacts due to stigma, EPA believes that the 
markets for these uses are less likely to be affected by a hazardous waste label for CCR.  CCR categories currently covered under the CPGs 
include concrete/concrete products/grout, flowable fill, and blasting grit/roofing granules. 

 

 

According to U.S. Census data, the public portion of total construction spending equaled 20.7% in 2005, 21.4% in 2006, 24.6% in 2007, and 
had swelled to 35.4% by Nov. 2009 (likely in direct relationship to the current state of the economy and current federal stimulus spending).  
Similarly, U.S. EPA (2008d) estimates that for concrete projects, the cement demand attributable to federal concrete projects reflects 
approximately 20% of the annual total demand.  EPA then apportioned the amounts of CCR usage into a public construction vs. a private 
construction split.  Based on the Census Bureau and EPA data,157 EPA established a 25% / 75% split of the totals for these products, such that 
25% of the total usage is recognized as accruing to public construction and 75 % to private construction. 

                                                 
156 Agencies may elect not to purchase designated items when the cost is unreasonable; inadequate competition exists; items are not available within a reasonable period of 
time; or items do not meet the agency's reasonable performance specifications.

Not all consolidated uses of CCR are covered under federal CPGs.  Thus, this scenario also estimated the potential impacts on the use of CCR 
in non-CPG, consolidated uses.  These CCR categories include blended cement/raw feed for clinker, mineral filler in asphalt, gypsum panel 
products, waste stabilization/solidification, and miscellaneous/other.  In the case of CCR used in blended cement, mineral filler – asphalt, 
gypsum for wallboard, and miscellaneous/other applications, this RIA assumed that 50% of these uses will be reduced.  Thus, the potential 
reductions in this category will total 6.8 million tons per year.   

For the use of CCR in waste stabilization/solidification applications, this RIA assumed that stigma will not have a negative impact.  For this 
use, the CCR are already being used in a waste management context.  The CCR are used in secure landfills to immobilize wastes typically more 
hazardous than the CCR themselves.  Therefore, this RIA projects no reduction in the future annual tonnage of CCR used for this purpose. 
 

Given that the public procurement of these products should continue because of their CPG designation, this RIA assumed that there will be no 
negative impact on the public portion of CCR usage.  That is, the demand for CPG products made from CCR will be the same as it currently is 
for the public portion of the construction market.  However, this RIA assumes a 50% reduction of total private uses.158  This results in an 
estimated 6.8 million tons per year reduction in CCR use for this category of beneficial uses.  
 

•  “Stigma” for CCR in Other Consolidated Uses  

•  “Stigma” for Unconsolidated Uses 
 

In addition to the consolidated uses of CCR discussed above, CCR can be employed in unconsolidated uses.  For some of these uses, the CCR 
products may be more similar to the disposed material proposed to be regulated.  In addition, they have typically not been chemically fixed 
within a product.  As a result, stigma concerns may be more plausible.  Markets that involve unconsolidated uses of CCR include structural 
fill/embankments, road base/sub-base, soil modification/stabilization, snow/ice control, aggregate, agriculture, and miscellaneous/other.  For 
purpose of the sensitivity analysis, this RIA assumed a potential reduction of 80%.159  This results in an additional 11.1 million tons per year 
reduction of beneficially used CCR.  By adding the 6.8 million tons from CPG consolidated uses, to the 6.8 million tons from non-CPG 
consolidated uses, plus the 11.1 million tons from unconsolidated uses, this RIA estimates that a severe stigma effect would lead to a 51% 
reduction of beneficial use. 
 
                                                 
158 The 50% reduction is considered a worst-case assumption because these materials provide significant value at competitive costs – for example, concrete that includes fly 
ash typically performs better than non-CCR concrete, and is likely to retain favorable treatment under Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).  In 
addition, academic studies of “stigma” associated with products rarely leads to decreased usage to this extent. 
159 EPA has assumed this high “stigma” effect because a number of the uses may appear close to the disposal scenario, e.g., structural fills.  Also, it is widely recognized 
that CCR in unconsolidated uses may present risks, if used in the wrong conditions. (Indeed, EPA takes comment on unconsolidated uses in the preamble to the CCR 
proposed rule due to the increased potential for risks.)  Some of these uses are likely to be particularly sensitive to public concerns and liability concerns.  These include 
agricultural uses and dispersive uses, like use of bottom ash or boiler slag for ice and snow control.  Therefore, if stigma does have a role to play, EPA believes it is 
reasonable to assume it will be significant for unconsolidated uses.  Even for the purposes of a worst-case sensitivity analysis, however, EPA believes that, given the 
success of many of these uses in states with rigorous beneficial use programs, “stigma” will not completely eliminate such uses; therefore, it has estimated a decrease of 
80%.

Step 6:  Apply Estimated Induced Effect Scenarios to Baseline CCR Beneficial Use 
 
Applying the first effect (increase in the sale of CCR due to a decrease in price), EPA noted that a 28% increase with an elasticity of 1.0 would 
makes sense when there is ample room for growth.  But as the market becomes more and more saturated, it is less and less likely that unit 
elasticity would apply.  Instead, the elasticity is likely to decrease with increasing saturation.  To account for this, the beneficial use increase 
was set to 28% of either the existing beneficial use tonnage, or to 28% of the remaining CCR tonnage, whichever was less.  In other words, 
once beneficial use was greater than 50% of total CCR, the increase would be constrained to 28% of what was left over after beneficial use was 
accounted for.  EPA also accounted for the fact that the price change would not fully affect the market until the rule (and therefore the costs) 
had been phased in.  Full implementation was assumed to occur by 2019.  However, industry would undoubtedly likely attempt to prepare for 
these increased costs as soon as a final rule was passed, and therefore the beneficial use increases were assumed to linearly approach 28% by 
2019.  The projected tons of beneficial use under Subtitle C are shown in Exhibit 28 below. 

As seen below, subtitle C in EPA’s analysis would drive more CCR toward beneficial use due to the increased costs of disposal.  However, as 
discussed in Step 4 above, there is also the possibility that there would be a stigma associated with the “hazardous waste” designation.  Here the 
beneficial use of CCR would be 49% of the baseline due to stigma.  Since the maximum CCR beneficially used is less than 50% of all CCR, 
the constraint imposed on the straight 28% increase would not be necessary.  Thus, once the full 51% decrease and 28% increase are accounted 
for, the future CCR beneficial use annual tonnages are calculated as displayed below in Exhibit 5C-15.

Two Alternative Scenarios of Projected Future CCR Beneficial Use 2012-2061 

 
 
 
Step 7:   Estimate Potential Induced Effects on Future Annual Tonnages of CCR Beneficial Use 
  
Exhibit 5C-16 below shows beneficial use projected under Subtitle C.  Beneficial use under the increasing disposal cost scenario would lead to 
an increase of 28% above the baseline estimate.  However, as the market becomes more and more saturated, it will likely become harder to 
increase beneficial use.  Thus, the increase is constrained to 28% of the remaining unused CCR.  The elasticity column represents the effective 
percent change in quantity for each percent change in price once this constraint has been accounted for.  While the elasticity is assumed to 
initially be 1.0, the effect of market saturation drives that elasticity towards zero over time as seen below.

Exhibit 5C-16 

 
 
Exhibit 5C-17 below shows beneficial use projected under Subtitle C with a worst-case stigma assumption.  Increased beneficial use under the 
increasing disposal costs of a Subtitle C rule are not accounted for.  However, as soon as the rule becomes effective in 2012, the Scenario #2 of 
this RIA simulates a stigma effect which decreases the tons beneficially used by 51%.  Once the disposal cost effect is fully captured by 2019, 
and the market has adjusted to stigma, beneficial use is assumed to grow at the same rate it would have otherwise.

Exhibit 5C-18 below shows the projected future annual CCR generation and three trends in beneficial use (i.e., scenario #1 increase without 
stigma, scenario #2 decrease with stigma, and scenario #3 no change in relation to the increasing baseline trend).  Scenario #1 assumes that the 
increased cost of disposal from regulation will induce the electric utility industry to seek out additional CCR beneficial use markets thereby 
increasing future annual beneficial use of CCR above the increasing baseline trend.  Experiences with the EPA RCRA Subtitle C hazardous 
waste program indicate that industry often increases annual recycling and materials recovery rates after RCRA regulation (e.g., after EPA has 
listed certain types and sources of secondary industrial materials as RCRA “hazardous wastes”).  Thus, EPA regards the increased beneficial 
use Scenario #1 as the most likely outcome.  A second curve in the Exhibit below displays the Scenario #2 decreased CCR beneficial use 
stigma effect under the Subtitle C regulatory option (this RIA does not apply scenario #2 under the Subtitle D options).  The Exhibit also 
presents Scenario #3 in which future annual CCR beneficial use is projected to continue on its recent upwardly increasing trendline without any 
induced future change as a result of the CCR rule.  The future annual beneficial use tonnages for both scenario #1 and scenario #2 are estimated 
in this RIA incrementally relative to the scenario #3 baseline trend.

Step 8:  Monetize Potential Induced Effects on Future CCR Beneficial Use 
 
Based on multiplying a unitized average monetized social benefit value of $559 per ton consisting of (a) the $474 per ton unitized lifecycle 
benefit value, plus the (b) $85 per ton average avoided disposal cost estimated for the subtitle C option, to the 50-year (i.e., 2012 to 2061) 
projected future baseline tonnage displayed in Exhibit 5C-18 above, produces an estimated future baseline social benefit value from CCR 
beneficial use of: 
 

Future baseline economic value: 
 
Future baseline lifecycle social value*: 
(* Includes avoided CCR disposal cost to electric utility industry)

•  Monetization of Scenario #1 (Induced Increase in CCR Beneficial Use) 

 
Exhibit 5C-19 below provides an estimate of the potential increase in future annual tonnage and economic and social benefits associated with 
CCR beneficial uses (not including minefilling) that could occur as a result of the CCR proposed rule. This quantity is incrementally calculated 
each year as the quantity projected under the Subtitle C option (without stigma), less the quantity projected under the baseline.

•  Monetization of Potential “Stigma” Decrease in CCR Beneficial Use (Scenario #2) 

 
The $559 per ton social benefit value estimated above is the proper estimate for increased beneficial use because this RIA assumes that all 
beneficial uses will increase in equal proportions.  However, it would not be appropriate to apply this same dollar estimate to decreased 
beneficial use from stigma because different uses decrease by different amounts, and therefore the decrease in benefits would not necessarily 
equal the 51% decrease in tons.  Based on the breakdown of beneficial uses displayed below in Exhibit 5C-20, these individual use category 
losses were summed to create a weighted average benefit reduction of 42%.  However, on a tonnage basis 51% of beneficial use tons are 
reduced.  Dividing the weighted value by the unweighted value for each ton lost, the benefits decreased by only 82% of the average $559/ton, 
or $458/ton.  This average unitized social benefits value is used to monetize the estimated tons lost from the stigma Scenario #2.

Step 9:  Estimate Potential Induced Effect on CCR Beneficial Use of the Other RCRA Regulatory Options 
 
The analysis above demonstrates the valuation of beneficial use effects using only the subtitle C option.  However, the results may be 
extrapolated to the other regulatory options.  Exhibit 5C-22 below displays the beneficial use effect scenarios linearly extrapolated in relation 
to the result of subtitle C based on the potential increase in CCR disposal cost.  In other words, the ratio of the disposal cost estimated under 
those other scenarios to the subtitle C disposal cost can be applied to the beneficial use benefits under those alternative options.

Step 10:  Quantify Potential Capacity Impacts on Commercial Subtitle C Waste Landfills (Under Scenario #2) 
 
For Scenario #2 estimated above involving a potential future reduction in annual CCR beneficial use, such loss would require additional 
disposal of 33.3 million tons CCR annually (source: Exhibit 5C-16) which will likely create four future industrial waste disposal problems: 
 

1.  Annual disposal rate exceedance:  Relative to the 33.3 million lost beneficial use annnual tonnages, there is a much smaller quantity of 
2 million tons per year of RCRA-regulated hazardous waste which is currently disposed in RCRA Subtitle C permitted onsite (captive) 
and offsite (commercial) landfills in the US.160  This implies a potential 1,665% annual increase (i.e., 16.65 times larger) in demand for 
hazardous waste landfill capacity. 

2.  Limited geographic availability:  There are currently 19 to 24 commercial hazardous waste landfills operating in 15 to 17 states. 161  

However, the CCR which is currently beneficially used is generated by 272 electric utility plants located in 41 states.162  Thus disposal 
at commercial hazardous waste landfills would require out-of-state shipment involving at least 24 to 26 states which do not have 
commercial hazardous waste landfills. 

3.  Remaining disposal capacity exceedance: The 19 to 24 commercial hazardous waste landfills have an available total remaining capacity 

of 21.7 million to 25.4 million tons hazardous waste.163  The additional 33.3 million tons per year of CCR beneficial use needing 
disposal under the Scenario #2 will consume this entire remaining total capacity within less than one year. 

4.  Increase landfill prices: In addition, such a large increase in nationwide economic demand for commercial hazardous waste landfills 

could drive-up landfill tipping fees which recently (2004) ranged between $61 and $139 per ton nationwide ($90 per ton national 
average).164  As verification of this potential effect on landfill prices, a recent (August 2009) market study165 of the US commercial 

                                                 
160 Source: 2 million tons per year is based on the annual average of landfill tonnages reported for years 2001 (2.09 million tons), 2003 (1.68 million tons), 2005 (2.04 
million tons), and 2007 (1.94 million tons) in EPA’s “RCRA National Analysis Biennial Hazardous Waste Report” at 
http://www.epa.gov/waste/inforesources/data/biennialreport/index.htm 
161 Source: These two ranges (i.e., 19 to 24 commercial haz waste landfill counts and 15 to 17 states) are from two alternative data sources: 

•  Source #1 of 2: 24 commercial RCRA-permitted hazardous waste landfill count and 17 state identities as listed in the Hazardous Waste Consultant “2007 Directory of 
US Commercial Hazardous Waste Management Facilities,” Vol.25, Issue 1, 2007, pp.4.1 to 4.44.  The 17 states are AL, AR, CA, CO, ID, IL, IN, LA, MI, NV, NJ, NY, 
OH, OK, OR, TX, UT. 

•  Source #2 of 2:  As compiled 02 Oct 2009 by EPA OSWER-ORCR staff (Cpan Lee, Environmental Scientist), this available remaining capacity estimate is based on 
three sources: (a) actual capacity estimates provided to OSWER-ORCR by facilities in April-Sept 2009, (b) information provided to OSWER-ORCR by EPA Regions 
and States in April/May 2009, and (c) capacity estimates developed by OSWER-ORCR using 1995-2007 RCRA Biennial Report data.  The 15 States are AL, CA, CO, 
ID, IL, IN, LA, MI, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, TX, and UT. 

162 The 41 states are AL, AR, AZ, CO, DE, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, ,OH, OK, OR, SC,

hazardous waste industry, provides the following empirical evidence of price increases by commercial hazardous waste landfills in 
response to annual increases in landfill disposal tonnage: 

“On average, the number of surveyed landfill firms that increased prices exceeds the number that received higher 
volumes in 2008.  Volumes increased for 50 percent of respondents and decreased for 42 percent, but 67 percent raised 
prices and 33 percent left prices unchanged.  The survey did not ask how much, if any, of the reported price increase was 
due to fuel surcharges.  The survey did determine that 92 percent of respondents applied fuel surcharges, but fuel 
surcharges cannot account for all of the price increases because the surcharges cover increased costs, and 77 percent of 
respondents reported increased [profit] margins.”

Comparison of Regulatory Benefits to Costs 

Chapter 6 

 
 
Section 6A of this Chapter presents a series of exhibits which summarize and compare the results of the cost and benefit estimates presented in 
Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, respectively, scaled to the three 2010 regulatory options.  Section 6B of this Chapter provides explanation of the 
scaling method and factors applied. 
 
 
6A.  Comparison of Regulatory Benefits to Costs Based on Alternative Discount Rates 
 
The series of six Exhibits 6A to 6F below summarize cost and benefits according to the three alternative beneficial use scenarios (i.e., induced 
increase, induced decrease, and no change), and according to the two OMB-prescribed alternative discount rates of 7% and 3% for use in RIAs: 
The 7% discount rate as a “base case” to represent the financial opportunity cost (i.e., borrowing cost) to affected 
businesses, which is consistent with OMB’s 2003 Circular A-4 guidance166 (page 33), and with OMB’s 1992 
Circular A-94 guidance167 (page 8) which indicate that a 7% discount rate “base case” should be used for 
regulatory analyses when regulation is expected to primarily and directly affect businesses and industries. 
This is a second mandatory discount rate specified in OMB’s 2003 Circular A-4 guidance (page 34). 

3% discount rate: 

7% discount rate: 

 
In these six summary exhibits below, the comparison of regulatory benefits to costs involves two numerical comparisons: 

1.  Net benefits (i.e., benefits minus costs) 
2.  Benefit/cost ratios (i.e., benefits divided by costs)

6B.  Factors Applied for Scaling Benefits and Costs to the Three 2010 Regulatory Options 
 
The regulatory compliance cost estimation presented in Chapter 4 of this RIA was initially formulated with reference to the October 2009 
draft RIA regulatory options.  Furthermore, the regulatory benefits evaluation in Chapter 5 of this RIA was based only on the 2010 regulatory 
options.  To resolve this inconsistency in scope between the two different sets of regulatory options evaluated for costs and for benefits, 
respectively, this RIA applies the scaling factors (i.e., percentage extrapolation multipliers) displayed below in Exhibit 6F. 
 
The cost analysis presented in Chapter 4 of this RIA is built upon a detailed (i.e., plant-by-plant for all 495 coal-fired electric utility plants) 
engineering cost model which estimated "engineering control" costs associated with the RCRA 3004(x) custom-tailored technical standards of 
the 2009 regulatory options (i.e., Subtitle C "hazardous waste" option, Subtitle D non-hazardous waste option requiring composite liners for 
new CCR disposal units, and a "hybrid" C/D option).  Although the engineering control costs were the same for each of the three October 2009 
options, "ancillary costs" differed according to whether an option was formulated in reference to Subtitle C or to Subtitle D authority.  For 
example, only the Subtitle C "hazardous waste" option and the Subtitle C component of the "Hybrid C/D" option required the cost associated 
with manifesting offsite shipments of CCR between coal-fired electric utility plants and offsite CCR disposal locations.  The October 2009 
draft RIA presented the "dry conversion cost" element as a separable "sub-option" for both the Subtitle C and Subtitle D options. 
 
However, in 2010 EPA identified a different set of three regulatory options to describe in the proposed rule and evaluate in RIA (i.e., Subtitle C 
"special waste" option with wet disposal phase-out, Subtitle D option which in effect would phase-out wet CCR disposal by requiring 
retrofitting existing impoundments with composite liners, and a Subtitle "D prime" option requiring liners only for new disposal units).  In 
order to meet EPA’s end-of-March 2010 internal deadline for completing the 2nd draft of this RIA, EPA did not revised the Chapter 4 cost 
analysis or the Chapter 7 supplemental analyses, but applied scaling factors for bridging the cost estimates to the 2010 options.  Numerically, 
the scaling factors represent alternative compliance rate assumptions in relation to the 2009 draft RIA’s Subtitle C "hazardous waste" option as 
a reference case for both cost and benefit estimate scaling to the three 2010 regulatory options.  The scaling factors assume less compliance 
under the non-Federally enforceable Subtitle D based options compared to the Federally-enforceable Subtitle C option.  Section 6B of this RIA 
provides the numerical values assigned to the scaling factors on an itemized basis according to the separate cost element and benefit element 
categories, for each of the three 2010 regulatory options.

o  Engineering control costs: For both RCRA subtitle C and subtitle D, the engineering control costs would be identical under both 
options.  However, state governments are not required to develop comparable programs under RCRA Subtitle D rules, and states 
cannot enforce Federal subtitle D rules.  In addition, because of the nature of subtitle D authority, individual requirements (e.g., 
groundwater monitoring, impoundment closure) will be more generic, allowing industry great latitude in complying.  Thus, 
actual costs under Subtitle D options will be lower than under Subtitle C, because facilities would not be expected to comply to 
the same extent.  In estimating future annual tons of CCR that might be managed under new standards, and the extent to which 
they would be similar under the Subtitle C option, this RIA applies the percentage of tons of CCR disposed in states with 
groundwater monitoring requirements as a way to estimate the likely costs incurred by industry for the other options.  Although 
the engineering control cost category consists of 10 cost elements as defined in this RIA, the percentage of states with 
groundwater monitoring programs is a reasonable surrogate indicator because states imposing groundwater monitoring 
requirements indicates which states will generally address specific units, and which are likely to upgrade their programs under 
subtitle D, if EPA were to issue a national subtitle D rule.  In those states, management standards may significantly improve, 
although not to the level of subtitle C for the reasons discussed above.  On the other hand, certainly some facilities in states 
without programs will choose to comply with the national regulation (taking full advantage of the more generic nature of the 
federal D standards).  Taking these two factors together, using the percentage of CCR disposed in states with groundwater 
monitoring programs provides a reasonable estimate of the extent to which facilities will take steps to comply with the national 
standards, and therefore of the costs of compliance. For the federally-enforceable subtitle C option, the cost recognizes that all 
states (100%) will be required by the CCR rule to install groundwater monitoring (and all other engineering controls).  For both 
the non-federally enforceable subtitle D and the “D prime” options, the cost estimates assume that the 48% of waste disposed of 
in states that currently require surface impoundments to have groundwater monitoring (either for new units only or for new and 
199 

existing units) will generally upgrade their programs, improving compliance, and that a modest number of facilities in other 
states would independently make efforts to comply – giving an overall estimate of 48%.  This 48% is applied as a scaling factor 
multiplier to estimate engineering control costs for both the Subtitle D and “D prime” in relation to the Subtitle C engineering 
cost estimate. 

o  Ancillary costs:  The RIA separately estimated “ancillary” costs under both Subtitle C and Subtitle D assuming 100% 
nationwide adoption.  For the Subtitle D or “D prime” options, the cost estimate only includes inspections of surface 
impoundments by qualified engineers.  The same logic applies to this requirement as it does to the engineering controls, and 
therefore this RIA applied the same 48% scaling factor multiplier relative to the Subtitle D ancillary cost estimates. 

o  Dry conversion costs: For the dry conversion cost, 40% is only applied as a scaling multiplier under the Subtitle D option 
because the “D prime” option does not require dry conversion.  The 40% value is calculated in Exhibit 6G below, which is 
based in part on assuming that the cost for retrofitting or building new impoundments is 63% of the cost of dry conversion under 
Subtitle C as calculated in Exhibit 6H below.

Source:  Based on cost data for an example 2600 megawatt (MW) nameplate capacity electric utility plant from pages B-8 (dry) and C-9 (wet) of the 
EPA/TVA joint study “Economic Analysis of Wet Versus Dry Ash Disposal Systems: Interagency Energy/Environment R&D Program Report,” report nr. 
EPA-600/7-81-013, January 1981: http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20006ORT.txt 
* EPA estimated the capital and annual O&M costs for the Subtitle D requirement for either retrofitting or building new CCR impoundments with 
composite liners, by assuming that the cost for those requirements are 63% of the $23.167 billion present value cost for dry conversion under the Subtitle C 
option.  This 63% cost scaling factor is calculated in this exhibit. 

6B.2  Regulatory Benefits Scaling Factors 
 

o  Groundwater contamination benefits:  Percentages are based on an examination of state programs related to groundwater 

monitoring requirements as described in Chapter 5 of this RIA.  The percentages given in Exhibit 6F above refer only to the 
input values to the estimation of groundwater protection benefits presented in Chapter 5 of this RIA.  For the Subtitle C option, 
all states will be required by the rule to have groundwater monitoring in place so that 100% of facilities over the baseline would 
202 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

detect contamination early and thus human cancers would be prevented.  For the Subtitle D option, 48% of CCR are placed in 
surface impoundments in states with groundwater monitoring in place for new units only (or for new and existing units).  It is 
likely that these states with some level of attention to groundwater monitoring would increase their attention (e.g., because they 
already have a RCRA program infrastructure) to groundwater monitoring, providing for much more effective systems, while 
other states would tend not to (although some individual facilities within those states would upgrade groundwater monitoring to 
some extent).  Thus, this RIA estimates that overall, the new regulation would result in 48% of facilities detecting contamination 
early and 48% of cancers would be prevented.  For the Subtitle D prime option, retrofitting existing units would not be required, 
and therefore existing and future releases would continue to occur from unlined surfaced impoundments.  Currently 12% of 
CCR are placed in surface impoundments in states with groundwater monitoring.  Some of these states would certainly upgrade 
their regulations, but given that surface impoundments would remain a potential source of release in all states, the Subtitle D 
prime option is less protective of groundwater than the Subtitle D option. Since this fraction is likely to fall between 48% and 
12%, the mid-point of 30% was chosen as a best estimate for the D prime option. 
o  Impoundment structural failure cleanup costs avoided:  This factor is not based on estimates of percentages of states likely to 
implement the new requirements (which for subtitle D would require liners for existing surface impoundments); it is unlikely 
that many states will choose to implement this requirement.  Instead, compliance will not be enforceable, and will be left up to 
self-imposed schedules of industry or citizens suits.  While most impoundments may eventually close, it will be a lengthy 
process.   As a general estimate, through delaying closures and lengthening the process, industry may be able to reduce costs by 
50%.  In addition, since 5.5% of surface impoundments have composite liners already, they would remain in place, and therefore 
would not incur costs.  Taking these figures together, this RIA applies a 45% scaling factor for this benefit. 

o  Induced impact on CCR beneficial uses: 

(cid:131)  Under Scenario #1 induced increase in beneficial use, beneficial uses are assumed to be linear with respect to total costs 
because increases in usage are directly proportional to the cost of the regulatory options.  Therefore, under the Subtitle D 
option, the net reduction in total costs compared to the Subtitle C option is 40%.  Under the Subtitle “D prime” option, 
since the dry conversion costs are 0%, a net result of 16% was applied.  This percentage was derived by dividing the 
Subtitle “D prime” option cost by the total cost of Subtitle C. 

(cid:131)  Under Scenario #2 induced decrease in beneficial use, for the reasons described in Section 5C of this RIA, this RIA 

assumes that potential induced future decrease on beneficial use only applies to the Subtitle C regulatory option, not to 
the Subtitle D-based options. 

(cid:131)  Under Scenario #3 no change in beneficial use (relative to baseline), there is no impacts under any of the regulatory 

options, so no scaling assumptions are applied.

Supplemental Analyses Required by Congressional Statutes or White House Executive Orders 

 

Chapter 7 

 
 

Note:  The computations presented in this Chapter are based on the cost estimates for the October 2009 draft RIA regulatory 
options using the larger dry conversion cost estimate prior to its update in Chapter 4.  Because the high-end cost of the October 
2009 draft RIA regulatory options (i.e., for the Subtitle C “hazardous waste” option) is larger than the high-end cost for the 2010 
options (i.e., for the Subtitle C “special waste” option), the effects estimated in this Chapter are proportionately over-estimated. 

 
 
7A.  Electricity Price Impact (Executive Order 13211) 
 
The 2001 Executive Order 13211168 “Actions Concerning Regulations that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use” requires 
Federal agencies to evaluate and prepare a statement on any potential adverse effects of economically-significant rulemakings on energy 
supply, distribution or use, including: 
 

•  Shortfall in energy supply 
•  Energy price increases 
•  Increased use of foreign energy supplies 

 
The OMB’s 13 July 2001 Memorandum M-01-27169 guidance for implementing this Executive Order identifies nine numerical indicators 
(thresholds) of potential adverse energy effects, three of which are relevant for evaluation in this RIA: 
 

•  Increases in the cost of energy production in excess of 1% 
•  Increases in the cost of energy distribution in excess of 1% 
•  Other similarly adverse outcomes. 
 
Because this RIA did not collect and analyze data on energy production cost or energy distribution cost, this RIA evaluated the potential impact 
of the CCR regulatory options on electricity prices relative to the 1% threshold of both indicators as an indicator of “other similarly adverse 
outcome”.  This RIA calculated the potential increase in statewide electricity prices that the industry compliance costs might induce under each 
CCR regulatory option.  This calculation involved plant-by-plant annual revenue estimates and annualized compliance cost estimates, and 
respective statewide average electricity prices for the 495 electric utility plants, according to the following four steps.

Downloaded the annual million megawatt capacity data for each of the 495 plants from the DOE-EIA website (2007), and 

estimated annual electricity output for each plant, by multiplying the capacity data by three factors: 

•  Step 1: 
o 
o 
o 

365 operating days per year 
24 operating hours per day 
86.8% capacity utilization per year170 

•  Step 2: 

Estimated the annual electricity sales revenue for each plant by multiplying the estimated annual electricity output sold by each 
plant (from Step 1), by the respective statewide average retail price (May 2009) of electricity for all sectors (i.e., residential, commercial, 
industrial, transportation) from DOE-EIA at http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_6_a.html 

•  Step 3: 

Added the estimated incremental regulatory costs on a plant-by-plant basis, to the estimated annual electricity sales revenue for 

each plant, to obtain a hypothetical future annual revenue target, which represents a 100% cost pass-thru scenario.  This simple scenario 
represents an upper-bound case of potential electricity price increase.  Furthermore, if this 100% cost pass-thru is averaged over the entire 
electricity supply in each state, not just averaged over the 495 coal-fired electricity plants as done in this RIA, the potential percentage 
increase in electricity price would be less than this upper-bound case presented in this RIA. 

•  Step 4: 

Divided the hypothetical future annual revenue target by the estimated annual electricity output for each plant, to obtain a 

hypothetical future (higher) target price for each plant, which incorporates the added regulatory cost.  Compared the higher target price to 
the current price to calculate the potential price increase on a percentage basis for each of the 495 plants. 

 
Exhibit 7A below presents the findings of this energy price evaluation on a state-by-state basis.  As displayed in the bottom row of Exhibit 
7A, none of the options have an expected nationwide average energy price increase >1%.  Appendix L presents the plant-by-plant calculation 
spreadsheet used for this electricity price impact analysis.

Because this price analysis is based only on the 495 potentially affected coal-fired electric utility plants (with 333,500 megawatts nameplate 
capacity) rather than on all electric utility and independent electricity producer plants in each state using other fuels such as natural gas, 
nuclear, hydroelectric, etc. (with 678,200 megawatts nameplate capacity), these price effects are higher than would be if the regulatory costs 
were averaged over the entire electric utility and independent electricity producer supply (totaling 1,011,700 megawatts, not counting the 
76,100 megawatts of combined heat and electricity producers).171 
 

•  Electricity Impact Findings 

 
On a nationwide basis for all 495 plants, compared to the estimated average electricity price of $0.0884 per kilowatt-hour across the 495 plants, 
the 100% regulatory cost pass-thru scenario may increase prices for the 495 plants by 0.172% to 0.795% across the regulatory options.  None 
of the regulatory options exceed the 1% threshold of EO 13211, thus this RIA does not include a “Statement of Energy Effect” as would be 
required by Section 1 of EO 13211 if the price impact indicator as estimated in this RIA exceeded 1%.

7B.  Small Business Impact Analysis (RFA/SBREFA) 
 
According to the requirements of the 1980 Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) as amended by the 1996 Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act (SBREFA), Federal regulatory agencies are required to make initial determinations if proposed regulatory actions may have a 
“significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities” (SISNOSE).  Small entities include small businesses, small 
organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.  Agencies are required to conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Screening Analysis (RFSA) to 
make this determination.  This section of the RIA presents the methodology and findings for the RFSA conducted for the proposed rule. 
 
Unless Agencies are able to certify that a particular regulatory action is not expected to have a SISNOSE, the RFA/SBREFA requires a formal 
analysis of the potential adverse economic impacts on small entities, completion of a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel (proposed rule 
stage), preparation of a Small Entity Compliance Guide (final rule stage), and Agency review of the rule within 10 years of promulgation. 
 
The small business impact analysis of this RIA follows the four analytic steps described in EPA’s RFA/SBREFA analysis guidance172: 
 

Step 1:  Determine which small entities are subject to the rule’s requirements 
Step 2:  Select appropriate measures for determining economic impacts on these small entities and estimate those impacts 
Step 3:  Determine whether the rule may be certified as not having a significant impact on small entities (SISNOSE) 
Step 4:   Document the screening analysis and include the appropriate RFA statements in the preamble 

 
 

•  Step 1: 

Identification of Small Entities 

 
The scope of entities addressed by this analysis includes the affected coal-fired electric utility plants in NAICS code 221112.  Not included in 
the scope of this RFA/SBREFA analysis are offsite commercial landfills which currently receive and dispose CCR generated by electric utility 
plants.  EPA’s RCRA statute does not provide EPA with authority to collect information from solid waste facilities; it only provides EPA with 
authority to collect information from RCRA-regulated hazardous waste management facilities (via the RCRA biennial report).  EPA does not 
know the identity, company size, or other information about the offsite landfills currently used by the electric utility industry.  Therefore, this 
RFA/SBREFA analysis is limited to only electric utility plants.  Consistent with EPA’s RFA/SBREFA guidance (page 15), this RIA applies the 
following small size definitions for owner entities of electric utility plants: 
 

Small company: 

Based  on  the  US  Small  Business  size  standard  for  NAICS  code  221112  (fossil  fuel  electric  utility  plants):  a 
company which generates less than 4 million megawatt-hours electricity output per year.

Small government:  Based  on  the  RFA/SBREFA’s  definition  (5  US  Code  section  601(5))  of  small  government  jurisdiction  as  the 
government of a city, county, town, township, village, school district, or special district with population <50,000. 

 
Based on the nameplate megawatt (MW) capacity for all electricity generating units (including those powered by non-coal fuel types) at each 
electricity plant from the 2007 DOE-EIA 860 database, this RIA estimated annual megawatt-hours electricity generation capacity by 
multiplying the nameplate capacity by (a) 365 days per year, and (b) 24 hours per day to calculate each owner entity’s annual electricity 
capacity.  Appendix D of this RIA indicates the assigned size of the owner company or city government for each electric utility plant according 
to two size categories: “Small” or “Non-small”.173  Exhibit 7B below presents the resultant count and summary of the characteristics of the 
small electric utility entities as estimated in this RIA. 
 
 

Notes: 
* Annual electricity generation capacity based on all electric plants and types of electric generation units (e.g. coal-fired, oil-fired, hydropower, nuclear, 
wind, biomass, etc.) owned by these companies, not just coal-fired electricity generation capacity. 
** $423.6 billion per year annual electricity sales estimated in this RIA is 73% of the $581.6 billion per year total revenues reported for NAICS code 22 
(Utilities sector) in the 2007 Economic Census at: http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IBQTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=D&-ds_name=EC0700A1&-_lang=en 

                                                 
173 It should be noted that some of the companies identified as small using the SBA size standard for NAICS 22 and the utility code specification in the 2007 EIA 860 
database to identify each corporate entity may be subsidiaries of a larger holding company (classified under a different NAICS) rather than a larger power company.  In 
addition some of these power companies may have merged.  For example, State Line is owned by Dominion Resources of Virginia, Northeastern Power is owned by Suez 
Energy North America, Inc. (SEGNA), Rio Bravo Poso and Rio Bravo Jasmin are owned by the North American Power Group, Ltd (NAPG), TES Filer City Station LP is 
owned by TONDU, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) and Excelon are merged. This approach likely overstates the number of small entities. 
 

209 

•  Step 2:  Measures for Determining Economic Impacts on Small Entities 

 
According to Exhibit 1 of EPA’s 2006 RFA/SBREFA small business impact analytic guidance, there are the following suggested tests that may 
be used to determine if small entities may be significantly impacted by a proposed rule: 
 

•  Small business impact tests: 

o  Sales test: 
o  Cash flow test:Debt-financed capital compliance costs relative to current cash flow 
o  Profit test: 

Annualized compliance costs as a percentage of profits 

Annualized compliance costs as a percentage of sales 

 

•  Small government impact tests: 

o  Revenue test:  Annualized compliance costs as a percentage of annual government revenues 
o  Income test:  Annualized compliance costs to household (per capita) as a percentage of median household (per capita) income 

 
Based on annual electricity generation data for the small owner entities in the electric utility industry identified in Appendix D of this RIA, the 
annual sales/annual revenue test was used for this analysis.  As itemized and estimated for each owner entity in the spreadsheets presented as 
Appendix M to this RIA, for each small entity EPA computed the respective sales revenue test percentages by the equation below: 
 

(AEGC x 1,000) x (ASP) x (CU) = annual $sales or $revenues per small entity 

Where: 
 

AEGC = 

ASP = 

CU = 

Annual electricity generation capacity per-entity in annual million megawatts (per-entity megawatt data is displayed in 
Appendix D).  This estimate involved downloading the annual million megawatt capacity data for each of the 495 
electricity plants from the DOE-EIA website (2007), and then multiplying the capacity data by two factors: 

o  365 operating days per year 
o  24 operating hours per day 

February 2009 average statewide retail price to ultimate consumers for electricity (i.e., cents per kilowatt-hour) for the 
relevant state or states applicable to the location of electric plants owned by each company; electricity price reflects the 
composite price charged to residential, commercial, industry and transportation sectors174

industrial, transportation) and on a composite basis at: http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_6_a.html 
 

210 

•  Step 3 & Step 4:  Determine and document whether the proposed rule may be certified as having “No SISNOSE” 

 
EPA determined whether each regulatory option may have a “significant impact on a substantial number of small entities” (i.e., SISNOSE) 
which may become subject to the requirements of the proposed rule.  This determination involved comparing the estimated regulatory 
compliance costs for each entity as displayed in Appendix J of this RIA and as summarized in Exhibit 7C below (small entity row items 6, 7, 
8, 9), to the respective annual sales and revenues for each entity estimated in Step 2 above.  Numerically, this comparison involved calculating 
the percentage of regulatory compliance costs relative to annual sales and revenues for each company for each of the regulatory options.  Then 
compared the percentage results for each small entity to the following three impact thresholds defined in Table 2 of EPA’s RFA/SBREFA 
analytic guidance.  Exhibit 7D below displays the numerical results of this analysis and the suggested RFA/SBREFA impact interpretation 
according to the three thresholds. 
 

<1% threshold: 
 
1% or more threshold:  
3% or more threshold:  

Annualized regulatory costs may be less then 1% of annual sales or revenues for small entities 
Annualized regulatory costs may be 1% or more of annual sales or revenues for affected small entities 
Annualized regulatory costs may be 3% or more of annual sales or revenues for affected small entities

•  Limitations of RFA/SBREFA Determination 
 
Not included in the RFA/SBREFA analysis of this RIA are two factors unique to the electric utility industry, which may reduce the small 
entity impacts relative to the estimates above in this RIA: 

 

•  Factor #1 of 2:  According to the 2007 DOE-EIA database on electric utility plants, two-thirds of the coal-fired electricity generation 

units at electric utility plants owned by small entities can switch to at least one of six other fuels: 

1.  Agricultural byproducts (database code = AB) 
2.  Distillate fuel oil (DFO) 
3.  Natural gas (NG) 
4.  Petroleum coke (PC) 
5.  Propane (PG) 
6.  Wood & wood waste solids (WDS) 

212 

•  Factor #2 of 2:  The small business impact analysis in this RIA applies the full industry compliance cost to the revenue and sales tests.  

However, because consumer demand for electricity is (a) highly price-inelastic and (b) projected go grow by 30% by year 2025175, 
electric utility plants may be expected to pass-thru much, if not all, of their regulatory costs (pending state government utility rate 
hike approval).  The next section of this RIA evaluates the possibility of regulatory compliance cost pass-thru. 

 
•  Compliance Cost Pass-Thru Analysis 
 

o  Ability to Raise Electricity Prices 

 
Traditionally, the electric utility industry has functioned as a regulated monopoly, providing essential electrical services under an exclusive 
franchise in exchange for having rates closely regulated by State public utility commissions (PUCs; sometimes called PSC public service 
commissions) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).   The FERC regulates rates charged for sales of bulk power between 
utilities, even if they are in the same state. It also regulates the pricing and use of transmission for wheeling, and asset transfers, including 
mergers.  In most states (California de-regulated electricity in 1998), the PUCs/PSCs set allowable rates upon application by the utility, with 
other affected parties allowed to present testimony. By law the utility must recover its cost of service, which includes "prudently" incurred 
expenses and a "fair" return on equity.176 
 
Based on the electricity ratemaking process described by the Pennsylvania PUC177as a case example, when an electric utility company seeks a 
price increase (aka rate hike), it must file a request with the PUC showing the proposed new rates and effective date, and must prove that the 
increase is needed.  The utility also must notify customers at least 60 days in advance.  The notice must include the amount of the proposed rate 
increase, the proposed effective date, and how much more the ratepayer can expect to pay.  Under the law, the utility is entitled to recovery of 
its reasonably incurred expenses and a fair return on its investment.  The PUC evaluates each utility’s request for a rate increase based on those 
criteria.  During the investigation, hearings are held before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at which the evidence in support of the rate 
increase is examined and expert witnesses testify. In addition, consumers are offered an opportunity to voice their opinions and give testimony. 
Briefs may be submitted by the formal parties.  A recommendation to the PUC is made by the ALJ.  Finally, the matter is brought before the 
Commissioners for a vote and final decision.  Together with the 60-day notice period, the rate increase process takes about nine months.  
Recent (2008) examples of requested or PUC-approved electricity rate hikes are summarized in Exhibit 7E below:178

Some state governments have deregulated the electric utility industry, thereby allowing multiple electric suppliers, not just a monopoly 
electricity supplier, to compete and set their own retail prices in those state markets.  As of 2003, 18 states have deregulated and six states may 
soon deregulate:179 
 

•  Deregulated states (18):  

•  May soon deregulate (6): 

AZ, CT, DE, DC, IL, ME, MD, MA, MI, NH, NJ, NY, OH, OR, PA, RI, TX, VA 
(11 of these states no longer have a price cap) 
AR, MT, NM, NV, OK, WV (note: CA deregulated in 1998 but has suspended) 

 
While average prices rose 21% in regulated states from 2002 to 2006, prices increased 36% during that period in 11 of the 18 deregulated states 
where rate caps expired, suggesting greater pricing flexibility in deregulated states.180 
 

o  Inelastic Demand for Electricity 

 
At the wholesale level, as a result of technological and regulatory barriers, the majority of electricity pricing plans do not allow end users to see 
and react to the actual market value of their electricity consumption/ conservation.  Since end-users do not face the real-time market price in 
making their consumption decisions, there is little demand reaction to changes in real time wholesale electricity prices.181  At the retail level, 
consumer demand for electricity has been largely inelastic.  The lack of real time metering at the retail level means that consumers don't know

how much they use or indeed how much electricity costs until after the fact.  Thus consumers cannot react to high prices easily by cutting 
consumption.182 
 

o  Cost Pass-Thru Conclusion 

 
Based on the above three cost pass-thru factors consisting of (a) 20 examples of recent (2008) PUC-regulated rate hikes which average almost 
19% per company which far exceeds the 1% and 3% SISNOSE screening analysis thresholds defined by EPA’s guidance, (b) 11 of the 18 
deregulated states which have de-regulated the price of electricity, and (c) the fact that consumer demand for electricity has been relatively 
inelastic, this RIA concludes that it is likely that electric utility suppliers could pass-thru all, or nearly all, of the future average annual 
regulatory compliance costs for the CCR proposed rule such that a significant impact on small entities and non-small entities would not occur.

7C.  Minority & Low-Income Population Statistics (Executive Order 12898) 
 
Under the 1994 Executive Order (EO) 12898183 it is the responsibility of Federal agencies to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by 
law, and consistent with the principles set forth in the report on the National Performance Review, each Federal agency shall make achieving 
environmental justice (EJ) part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health 
or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on (a) minority populations and (b) low-income populations.  Although not 
defined in EO 12898, for purpose of this RIA the following definitions are applied: 
 

•  Minority population: 
 
•  Low-income population: 

Numerically measured according to Census Bureau “non-white” statistics (does not include Hispanics). 
Numerically measured according to Census Bureau “individuals below poverty184 level.” 

 
Furthermore, section 3-302(b) of EO 12898 provides a trigger which indicates that Federal agencies shall collect and evaluate EJ data for any 
facilities or sites expected to have “substantial environmental, human health, or economic effect” when such facilities or sites become subject 
to “substantial” Federal environmental action: 
 

“In connection with the development and implementation of agency strategies in section 1-103 of this order, each Federal 
agency, whenever practicable and appropriate, shall collect, maintain and analyze information on the race, national origin, 
income level, and other readily accessible and appropriate information for areas surrounding facilities or sites expected to have 
substantial environmental, human health, or economic effect on the surrounding populations, when such facilities or sites 
become the subject of a substantial Federal environmental administrative or judicial action. Such information shall be made 
available to the public unless prohibited by law.” 

 
The EO 12898 does not establish quantitative thresholds for “substantial effect” on the surrounding populations, nor does this RIA formulate a 
quantitative threshold.  This RIA uses the (1) CCR disposal baseline environmental and human health hazards (e.g., damage cases), and (2) the 
environmental and human health protection objectives described in the CCR proposed rule, as indicators of “substantial effect”.  For that 
reason, this section of the RIA presents an EJ data collection and analysis involving a 5-step process to compare minority and low-income 
population data for each electric utility plant location, to respective statewide population data, to identify whether these two population sub-
groups disproportionately reside in geographic areas where electric utility plants are located.  In addition, this RIA identifies two other possible 
affects of the CCR proposed rule on (a) environmental justice populations surrounding offsite landfills which may receive CCR, and (b) 
environmental justice populations within electric utility plant customer service areas. 

                                                 
183 Source: 1994 Executive Order 12898 is available at: http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/eo/eo12898.htm 
184 The US Census Bureau defines “poverty”  following the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical Policy Directive 14.  The Census Bureau uses a set of 
money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty.  If a family’s total income is less than the family’s threshold, then that 
family and every individual in it is considered in poverty.  Poverty income thresholds are available at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/thresh08.html 
 

216 

•  Collection of Minority & Low-Income Demographic Data 

 
Step 1: Plant address 5-digit “Zip Code Tabulation Areas” (ZCTAs) formed the geographic basis for this EJ population data collection.  

Because ZCTAs represent irregularly shaped geographic areas, this ZCTA based data collection may be considered a “screening level” 
analysis.  The US Bureau of Census uses over 33,000 ZCTA for its Census counts of population and other demographic statistics based 
on the US Postal Service’s over 42,000 nationwide ZCTAs.185  Currently, there are no size restrictions limiting how large or small a 
ZCTA can be in terms of either a minimum/maximum number of housing units or geographic area.  Any particular ZCTA may be as 
small as a few city blocks or may cover many square miles.  Many ZCTAs are for villages, census-designated places, portions of cities, 
or other entities that are not municipalities.  The nationwide average ZCTA population is about 7,200 persons (i.e., (306.6 million mid-
2009 US population) / (42,500 ZCTAs)).  The nationwide average ZCTA area is about 83 square miles (i.e., (3,536,278 square miles 
total US land and water area) / (42,500 ZCTAs)), which is a land area equivalent to a five-mile radial distance (i.e., ((83 square miles) / 
(3.1416))^0.5).  In comparison, the radial area monitored for contamination in response to the December 2009 TVA Kingston TN 
electric plant CCR spill is reportedly four miles,186and this average four-mile ZCTA radial distance falls between the 1-mile to 15-mile 
radial distances used by EPA’s Superfund “Hazard Ranking System” (HRS) to define affected populations of sites having either (a) soil 
contamination only (1-mile), (b) groundwater and/or airborne contamination (4-miles), or (c) surface water contamination (15-miles 
downstream).  More information about EPA’s HRS is available at http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/npl_hrs/hrsint.htm. 

 

Using the Census search engine Factfinder (http:factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html?_lang=en), EPA retrieved population 
statistics for 464 (94%) of the 495 electric utility plants.  For 42 plants (8%) there was no ZCTA Census data because the plants did not 
have complete address data from DOE, or because the Census search engine did not have data for the ZCTA. 

 
Step 2: EPA collected statewide percentage data for minority and low-income subgroups for purpose of benchmark comparison to the 

plant-by-plant sub-group population statistics. 

o  EPA collected low-income population statewide percentages (3-year averages for 1998 to 2000) from the following 
o  EPA collected statewide percentages for white population sub-group (data year 2000) from the Census Bureau website: .  

Census Bureau website: http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/poverty00/tabled.pdf 

EPA then subtracted the percentage of white population in each state from 100% to produce the respective minority 
percentage for each state.  For data year 2000, the Census Bureau expanded the white population classification by 
collecting both data for people who claimed to be “white-only” and for people who claimed to be “mixed white”.  Since 
the purpose of the EJ analysis is to evaluate all minorities, this step involved collecting the “white-only” data in order to 
calculate the minority percentage which includes people who reported to be of mixed race.  Exhibit 7F below displays 
the statewide Census data for low-income and minority sub-populations.

•  Comparison of Minority & Low-Income Populations Surrounding Electric Utility Plants to Statewide Benchmarks 

 
Step 3, Step 4 and Step 5 of this evaluation described below involved three complementary levels of data comparisons.  All three comparisons 
also involved two complementary numerical comparisons, one based on calculating numerical percentages and the other on numerical ratios: 
 

1.  Plant level: 
2.  State level: 
3.  Nationwide level: 

 
 

Plant-by-plant disaggregated data comparison to statewide benchmarks 
State-by-state aggregated plant data comparison to statewide benchmarks 
Nationwide aggregated plant data comparison to nationwide benchmarks 

•  Calculation of Three Alternative Demographic Statistics Comparison Methods 

 
Step 3: On a plant-by-plant basis, EPA compared the plant ZCTA percentage minority and percentage low-income population data, to the 

respective statewide average percentages for each sub-group.  This constituted the 1st level of data comparison. 

 
Step 4: For purpose of summary, EPA aggregated the plant level population comparison data for each state as displayed in Exhibit 7G below.  

This constituted the 2nd level of data comparison.  There are no data displayed for DC, ID, RI or VT because there are no coal-fired 
electric utility plants in those states.  Appendix N of this RIA presents the plant-by-plant Census data on which this Exhibit is based.  
This step also involved aggregating the data across all 495 plants for comparison with the nationwide aggregate minority and low-
income percentage benchmarks.  This constituted the 3rd level of data comparison.

Step 5: Ratios:  EPA compared the percentages of minority and low-income populations surrounding the plants to their respective statewide 

benchmark percentages and to the nationwide percentages of these populations as calculated in Step 4, by calculating numerical ratios 
between the plant ZCTA group populations compared to statewide and nationwide percentages of minority and low-income 
populations.  The purpose of these ratios is to indicate the relative degree by which the percentages are below or above the statewide 
percentages.  Exhibit 7H below displays the results.

•  Minority & Low-Income Demographic Findings 

 
Below is a summary of the three alternative but complementary comparison approaches based on the same minority and low-income population 
data: (a) itemized plant-by-plant basis, (b) nationwide aggregation basis, and (c) state-by-state aggregation basis.  For purpose of determining the 
relative degree by which either group living near the 495 plants may exceed their respective statewide population percentages, the percentages 
are compared as a numerical ratio whereby a ratio of 1.00 indicates that the group population percentage living near a plant is equal to the 
statewide average, a ratio greater than 1.00 indicates the group population percentage near the plant is higher than the statewide population, and a 
ratio less than 1.00 indicates the group population is less than the respective statewide average. 

 

•  General population findings:

Plant level results: 

 
Using the plant-by-plant (i.e., itemized ZCTA) basis, 138 plants (28%) have surrounding minority populations which exceed their statewide 
minority benchmark percentages, whereas 357 plants (72%) have minority populations below their statewide benchmarks, which represents a 
plant ZCTA ratio of 0.39 (i.e., 138/357).  Because this ratio is 61% less than 1.00 (i.e., 1.00 minus 0.39), this finding indicates that only a 
relatively small count of plants have surrounding minority population percentages which disproportionately exceed their statewide benchmarks.  
Also on a plant-by-plant ZCTA basis, 256 plants (52%) have surrounding low-income populations which exceed their respective statewide 
benchmarks, whereas 239 plants (48%) have surrounding low-income populations below their statewide benchmarks, which represents a plant 
ZCTA ratio of 1.07 (i.e., 256/239).  Because this ratio is only slightly (7%) above 1.00, it indicates that a slightly disproportionate count of plants 
have surrounding low-income population percentages which exceed their statewide benchmarks.

State level results: 

 
Using the state-by-state aggregation basis, the percentages of minority and low-income populations surrounding the plants were compared to 
their respective statewide population benchmarks.   From this, state ratios revealed that 24 of the 47 states (51%) have higher minority 
percentages, and 29 of the 47 states (62%) have higher low-income percentages surrounding the 495 plants, suggesting a slightly disproportionate 
higher minority surrounding population and a relatively large disproportionate, higher low-income surrounding population.  However, in 
comparison to the other two numerical comparisons, this state-by-state count approach does not include numerically-weighting of state plant 
counts or state surrounding populations, which explains why this comparison method yields a different numerical result.  This method illustrates 
how population comparison results may be sensitive to the comparison method.

• 

Nationwide results: 

 
Using the nationwide aggregation basis across all 495 plants in all 47 states where the plants are located, 6.08 million people live in ZCTA 
surrounding the plants, which include a sub-total of 1.32 million (21.7%) minority and a sub-total of 0.8 million (12.9%) low-income population 
groups.  A comparison of these percentages to the national benchmark averages across all states of 24.9% minority and 11.9% low-income, 
represents a minority ratio of 0.87 (i.e., 21.7%/24.9%) and a low-income ratio of 1.08 (i.e., 12.9%/11.9%).  These nationwide aggregate ratios 
indicate a slightly lower disproportionate minority population surrounding the 495 plants, and a slightly higher disproportionate low-income 
population surrounding the plants.  Comparison of nationwide population sub-totals for all plants for each demographic group compared to the 
expected value based on statewide averages, reveals that: 
o  +18.9% additional low-income residents near the plants compared to the expected low-income population based on statewide 

averages (i.e., 783,062 low-income population for all 464 plants compared to 658,336 expected count if based on statewide 
averages.) 

o  -5.8% less minority residents near the plants compared to the expected minority population based on statewide averages (i.e., 

1,317,896 minority population for all 464 plants compared to 1,241,382 expected count if based on statewide averages). 

 
These three alternative comparisons indicate that the current (baseline) environmental and human health hazards and risks from electric utility 
CCR disposal units, and the expected future benefits of the regulatory options, may have a disproportionately lower effect on minority 
populations and may have a disproportionately higher effect on low-income populations. 
 
 

•  Other Potentially Affected Minority & Low-Income Populations 

 
There are two other potential differential effects of the regulatory options on two other population groups: (a) populations surrounding offsite 
CCR landfills, and (b) populations within the customer service areas of the 495 electric utility plants. 
 

o  Offsite CCR Landfills 

 
The potential effect on offsite landfills involves the RCRA Subtitle C based regulatory options whereby four different fractions of CCR 
generation may be required to be disposed in RCRA Subtitle C permitted landfills rather than in non-RCRA permitted waste landfills: 
 

•  CCR fraction #1:  Electric utility plants may switch the management of CCR, in whole or in part, from current onsite disposal to offsite 

commercial RCRA-permitted hazardous waste landfills (56.8 million is disposed in onsite landfills, and 22.4 million is 
disposed in onsite impoundments, totaling 79.2 million tons disposed onsite). 

•  CCR fraction #2:  Some or all of the CCR which is currently disposed in offsite landfills that do not have RCRA Subtitle C permits may 

also switch to RCRA-permitted commercial hazardous waste landfills if the current receiving landfills do not obtain 
RCRA Subtitle C permits (15.0 million tons is disposed offsite). 

 

226 

•  CCR fraction #3:  Annual CCR generation which is currently supplied for industrial beneficial use applications could also switch to 

offsite commercial RCRA Subtitle C permitted landfills if such use becomes curtailed in part or in whole from either 
state government regulations or from market stigma (47.0 million tons is beneficially used). 

•  CCR fraction #4:  Future cleanup of CCR disposal unit failures (e.g., impoundment collapse) would require disposal in RCRA Subtitle-
permitted waste landfills (the two CCR impoundment release case studies in Exhibit 4A of this RIA represent a range 
of 0.25 million to 3.3 million tons per failure event). 

 
One or more of these four potential shifts of CCR disposal from current non-hazardous landfills to hazardous waste landfills, could have a 
disproportionate effect on populations surrounding these locations, and in particular, minority and low-income populations surrounding 
commercial hazardous waste facilities, if current landfills operated by electric utility plants do not obtain future Subtitle C permits (Option 1).  
A recent (2007) study determined that minority and low-income populations disproportionately live near commercial hazardous waste 
facilities, although the study included other types of commercial hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities in addition to commercial 
hazardous waste landfills.187  An example of such potential EJ concerns is a 2009 US national news item involving the decision made by the 
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to train transport 3 million tons of the TVA’s (Kingston TN electricity plant) December 2008 CCR 
impoundment collapse site cleanup waste, 350 miles away to a landfill in a rural Alabama county which reportedly has about 70% minority 
(African American) and 33% low-income residents.188  However, this example serves to illustrate that EJ concerns are not necessarily 
conclusive or shared by all affected EJ populations, as evidenced by the following remarks made to news reporters by the Alabama county 
government officials and county residents:189 
 

“To county leaders, the train’s loads, which will total three million cubic yards of coal ash from a massive spill at a power plant 
in east Tennessee last December [2008], are a tremendous financial windfall.  A per-ton “host fee” that the landfill operators 
pay the county will add more than $3 million to the county’s budget of about $4.5 million.  The ash has created more than 30 
jobs for local residents in a county where the unemployment rate is 17 percent and a third of all households are below the 
poverty line.  A sign on the door of the landfill’s scale house says job applications are no longer being accepted — 1,000 were 
more than enough.  But some residents worry that their leaders are taking a short-term view, and that their community has been 
too easily persuaded to take on a wealthier, whiter community’s problem…. County leaders, who are mostly black, bristle at 
accusations of environmental injustice, saying that the ash is perfectly safe and that criticism has been fostered by outsiders, or 
even competitors who wanted the ash disposal contract for themselves…..  Bob Deacy, vice president of clean strategies and 

                                                 
187 Source: United Church of Christ, “Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty 1987-2007”, March 2007. . This study evaluated and made findings on minority and low-income 
population data within a 1.8-mile radius “host neighborhood” of 413 commercial hazardous waste facilities, compared to “non-host” areas.  The study (page x) found that 
“Host neighborhoods of commercial hazardous waste facilities are 56% people of color whereas non-host areas are 30% of color…  Poverty rates in the host neighborhoods 
are 1.5 times greater than non-host areas (18% vs. 12%).”

o  Electricity Service Area Customers 

project development for the Tennessee Valley Authority, whose Kingston Fossil Plant was the site of the ash spill that covered 
almost 300 acres of land and waterways, said Arrowhead [Alabama landfill] was chosen because it was reachable by train 
instead of truck, because it underbid other sites and because, unlike closer landfills, it had the capacity to handle all the ash.” 

 
A third potential effect of the regulatory options described in today’s notice is the price of electricity supplied by some or all of the affected 495 
electric utility plants could increase to cover the cost of regulatory compliance.  Thus customers in electric utility service areas could 
experience price increases, although the RIA estimates that future potential price increases could be expected to be below 1% increase relative 
to the $0.0900 per kilowatt hour national average price (February 2009) for all four customer sectors (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial, 
and transportation).  The RIA for today’s action did not evaluate the customer service area populations for the 495 plants.

Under Executive Order (EO) 13045 of 21 April 1997, Federal Agencies shall make it a high priority (a) to identify and assess environmental 
health and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children, and (b) shall ensure that its policies, programs, activities, and standards 
address disproportionate risks to children that result from environmental health or safety risks.  Although the EO does not define children, the 
US Census Bureau defines “children” as follows190: 
 

Children: The term "children"…  are all persons under 18 years, excluding people who maintain households, families, or 
subfamilies as a reference person or spouse. 

 
The purpose of this section is not to evaluate children risks, but to evaluate whether disproportionate percentages of children live near electric 
utility plants.  This analysis involves a 5-step process for comparing children population data for each electric utility plant location, to statewide 
children population data to identify whether children disproportionately reside in geographic areas where electric utility plants are located. 
 

•  Collection of Child Demographic Data 

7D.   Child Population Statistics (Executive Order 13045) 
 

•  Purpose of Child Population Data Analysis 

 
Step 1:Plant address 5-digit “Zip Code Tabulation Areas” (ZCTAs) formed the geographic basis for this child population data collection.  

Because ZCTAs represent irregularly shaped geographic areas, this ZCTA based data collection may be considered a “screening level” 
analysis.  The US Bureau of Census uses over 33,000 ZCTAs for its Census counts of population and other demographic statistics based 
on the US Postal Service’s over 42,000 nationwide ZCTAs.191  Currently, there are no size restrictions limiting how large or small a 
ZCTA can be in terms of either a minimum/maximum number of housing units or geographic area.  Any particular ZCTA may be as 
small as a few city blocks or may cover many square miles.  Many ZCTAs are for villages, census-designated places, portions of cities, 
or other entities that are not municipalities.  The nationwide average ZCTA population is about 7,200 persons (i.e., (306.6 million mid-
2009 US population) / (42,500 ZCTAs)).  The nationwide average ZCTA area is about 83 square miles (i.e., (3,536,278 square miles 
total US land and water area) / (42,500 ZCTAs)), which is a land area equivalent to a 5-mile radial distance (i.e., ((83 square miles) / 
(3.1416))^0.5).  In comparison, the radial area monitored for contamination in response to the December 2009 TVA Kingston TN 
electric plant CCR spill is reportedly four miles,192 and this average 5-mile ZCTA radial distance falls between the 1-mile to 15-mile 
radial distances used by EPA’s Superfund “Hazard Ranking System” (HRS)193 to define affected populations of sites having either (a) 
soil contamination only (1-mile), (b) groundwater and/or airborne contamination (4-miles), or (c) surface water contamination (15-miles 

                                                 
190 The US Census Bureau definition of “children” is from its “Current Population Survey (CPS) - Definitions and Explanations” website at: 
http://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html 
191 Source: US Census Bureau ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)  Frequently Asked Questions.:   Nationwide total ZCTA count is from the US Postal Service’s FAQ

downstream).  Using the Census search engine Factfinder (http:factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html?_lang=en), EPA retrieved 
total population and people 18 and over for 464 (94%) of the 495 electric utility plants.  For 42 plants (8%) there was no ZCTA Census 
data because the plants did not have complete address data from DOE or because the Census search engine did not have data for the 
ZCTA. 

 
Step 2: EPA collected 3-year (2005 to 2007) average statewide percentages for people 18 and older data as displayed in Exhibit 7I below.

•  Comparison of Child Populations Living Near Electric Utility Plants to Statewide Benchmarks 

 
Step 3, Step 4 and Step 5 of this evaluation described below involved three complementary levels of data comparisons.  All three comparisons 
also involved two complementary numerical comparisons, one based on calculating numerical percentages and the other based on calculating 
numerical ratios: 
 

1.  Plant level: 
 
2.  State level: 
 
3.  National level:  

Plant-by-plant disaggregated data comparison to statewide benchmarks 
State-by-state aggregated plant data comparison to statewide benchmarks 
National aggregated plant data comparison to statewide benchmarks 

 
Step 3: On a plant-by-plant basis, EPA compared the plant ZCTA percentage children, to the respective statewide average percentage children. 
 
Step 4: For purpose of summary, EPA aggregated the plant level children population comparison data for each state as displayed in Exhibit 7J 

below.  There are no data displayed for DC, ID, RI or VT because there are no coal-fired electric utility plants in those states.  
Appendix O of this RIA presents the plant-by-plant Census data on which this Exhibit is based.

•  Child Population Data Findings 

 
Below is a summary of the three alternative but complementary comparison approaches based on the same children population data: (a) plant-
by-plant (i.e., itemized ZCTA) basis, (b) nationwide aggregation basis, and (c) state-by-state aggregation basis.  For purpose of determining the 
relative degree by which children may exceed these statewide percentages, the percentages are compared as a numerical ratio whereby a ratio 
of 1.00 indicates that the child population percentage living near a plant is equal to the statewide average, a ratio greater than 1.00 indicates the 
child population percentage near the plant is higher than the statewide population, and a ratio less than 1.00 indicates the child population is 
less than the respective statewide average. 
 

•  General population findings 

o  464 plants (i.e., 94% of the 495 universe) for which Census plant address ZCTA data are located in 47 states. 
o  The plant address ZCTA population surrounding these plants is 6.08 million, which is an average of 13,091 surrounding 

population per plant. 

•  Child population findings 

 
 

 

 

the national average of the child population in the US is 24.7%. 

o  The sub-total number of children surrounding these 464 plants is 1.54 million (i.e., 25.4% of 6.08 million).  In comparison, 
o  The ratios of the children population percentages surrounding these plants range from 0.79 to 1.53, and the average of the 
o  27 of the 47 states (57%) have disproportionately high percentages of children within the plant address ZCTAs compared to 
o  States with the largest difference in the children population between the ZCTAs where the plants are located compared to

the statewide percentages. 

the statewide percentages are as follows: 

1.  Oregon (36% vs. 23%) 

235 

2.  Hawaii (33% vs. 22%) 
3.  New Mexico (32% vs. 26%) 
4.  Arizona (33% vs. 26%) 
5.  California (32% vs. 26%) 

o  A sub-total of 291 plants (63%) have surrounding children populations which exceed their respective statewide percentage. 

 

•  Plant level results: 

 
Using the plant-by-plant (i.e. itemized ZCTA) basis, 310 plants (63%) have surrounding child populations which exceed their statewide 
children benchmark percentages, whereas 185 plants (37%) have children populations below their statewide benchmarks, which represents a 
plant ZCTA ratio of 1.68 (i.e., 310/185).  Since this ratio is much greater than 1.00, this finding indicates that a highly disproportionate count of 
plants have surrounding child population percentages which exceed their statewide benchmark. 
 

•  State level results: 

 
Using the state-by-state aggregation basis, the percentage of child populations surrounding the plants were compared to their respective 
statewide population benchmarks.  The state-by-state ratios revealed that approximately 27 of the 47 states (57%) have disproportionate 
percentages of children within the plant address ZCTA compared to the rest of the state suggesting a disproportionate surrounding child 
population.  However, in comparison to the other two numerical comparisons above, this state-by-state count approach does not include 
numerically-weighting of state plant counts or state surrounding populations, which explains why this comparison method yields a different 
numerical result.  This method illustrates how population comparison results may be sensitive to the comparison method. 
 

•  Nationwide results: 

 
Using the nationwide aggregation basis across all 495 plants in all 47 states where the plants are located, 6.08 million people live in ZCTAs 
surrounding the plants, which include a sub-total of 1.54 million children (25.4%).  Comparison of this percentage to the national aggregate 
benchmark across all states of 24.7% children yields a ratio of 1.03 (i.e., 25.4%/24.7%).  This ratio indicates a slightly higher disproportionate 
child population surrounding the 495 plants.  Comparison of the nationwide child population sub-total for all plants reveals that +4.1% 
additional children reside near the plants, compared to the expected child population if based on state averages (i.e., 1,541,854 children living 
near the 464 plants compared to 1,480,831 expected children count). 
 
These three alternative comparisons indicate that the current (baseline) environmental and human health hazards and risks from electric utility 
CCR disposal units, and the expected future benefits of the regulatory options, may have a disproportionately higher effect on child 
populations.

7E.  Unfunded Mandates (UMRA) & Federalism Implications Analysis (Executive Order 13132) 
 

•  UMRA 

 
Among its other purposes and Federal agency rulemaking requirements, Title II of the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA; 2 
U.S.C. 1531-1538), requires Federal agencies, unless otherwise prohibited by law, to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, 
local, and tribal governments and on the private sector, to determine whether any proposed rulemaking: 
 

 “…is likely to result in promulgation of any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, 
local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year.” 

 
Section 202 of UMRA requires Federal agencies which propose rules that are likely to exceed this $100 million expenditure threshold on either 
the private sector or on state/local/tribal governments, to prepare a “Written Statement” containing the following five components, and supply 
the Written Statement to OMB as well as summarize it in the Federal Register notice (aka “preamble”) for the proposed rule: 
 

1.  Identification of the applicable authorizing Federal law 
2.  Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the rule including the costs and benefits to State, local, 

and tribal governments or the private sector, and an analysis of whether Federal resources may be available to pay these costs 

3.  Estimates of future compliance costs and any disproportionate budgetary effects 
4.  Estimates of effects on the national economy such as productivity, economic growth, employment, job creation, international 

competitiveness 

5.  Description and summary of agency’s prior consultation with elected representatives of the affected State, local and tribal governments. 

 
Section 202 of UMRA allows Federal agencies to prepare the “Written Statement “in conjunction with or as a part of any other statement or 
analysis.  Accordingly, the purpose of this section of the RIA is to determine whether the regulatory options evaluated in this RIA exceed this 
UMRA direct cost threshold. 
 
Findings: 

The private sector and the state/local government shares of direct compliance costs under each option are displayed below in 
Exhibit 7L, which indicates that: 

(cid:131)  Private sector cost test: All of the regulatory options are expected to result in expenditures of $100 million or more in the 

aggregate for the private sector, in any one year (i.e., 139 companies and cooperatives of the total 200 owner entities). 

(cid:131)  State/local/tribal government cost test: None of the regulatory options are expected to result in expenditures of $100 

million or more for State, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate in any one year (there are 60 state/local 
government owner entities identified in Exhibit 7M below, no known tribal owner entities, plus one Federal owner). 

 
According to the private sector test finding, EPA has prepared an “UMRA Written Statement” which is attached to this RIA as Appendix P. 
 
 

237 

•  Federalism (Executive Order 13132) 

 
The 1999 Federalism Executive Order 13132 (Federal Register, Vol.64, No. 153, 10 Aug 1999) furthers the policies of the 1995 Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) by establishing federalism principles, federalism policymaking criteria, and a state/local government 
consultation process for the development of Federal regulations that have federalism implications.  Federalism implications refers to 
regulations and other Federal policies and actions that have substantial direct effects on states, on the relationship between the Federal 
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
 
For purpose of complying with the Section 6 consultation process of EO 13132, this section of the RIA evaluates whether the CCR regulatory 
options may “impose substantial direct compliance costs” on state/local governments.  As summarized in Exhibit 7L, the proposed rule might 
impose four types of direct costs on the 60 state/local government owner entities identified in Exhibit 7M below: 
 

•  State/local government owned electric utility plants: 

1.  Engineering control costs for CCR disposal units located at electric utility plants owned by state/local governments. 
2.  Ancillary costs for CCR disposal units located at electric utility plants owned by state/local governments. 
3.  Conversion to dry disposal costs for CCR disposal units located at electricity utility plants owned by state/local governments. 

•  State government environmental agencies: 

4.  Regulatory implementation, administration, and enforcement costs to RCRA-authorized state government programs/agencies. 

 
Consistent with the “direct cost” scope of EO 13132, not included in Exhibit 7L are potential indirect costs in the form of potential lost annual 
revenues to electricity plants associated with potential reductions in CCR sold by plants for beneficial use under the three Subtitle C options for 
which such an possible indirect effect is estimated in this RIA. 
 
EPA’s 2008 guidance194 for compliance with EO 13132 describes two numerical methods (i.e., numerical tests) for evaluating whether an EPA 
rule may have federalism implications with respect to “substantial direct compliance costs”: 
 

1.  $25 million test: Annualized direct compliance cost expenditures to state/local governments in aggregate of $25 million or more195 
2.  1% test: Annualized direct compliance costs faced by state/local governments is likely to equal or exceed 1% of their annual revenues* 
[* Note: Page 29 of “Attachment A: Guidance for Implementing the Federalism 1% Test” to EPA’s Nov 2008 “Guidance on Executive 
Order 13132: Federalism” defines small government “general revenue” as “made up of intergovernmental revenue plus revenue from 
their own sources and excludes utility, liquor store and employee retirement revenue.”  However, given that the CCR proposed rule 
affects electric utility industry, this RIA applies the “1% Test” in relation to only State/local government electric utility annual revenue.] 

 
                                                 
194 The two methods are from page 6 of “EPA’s Action Development Process -- Guidance on Executive Order 13132: Federalism,” OPEI Regulatory Development Series, 
Nov 2008, 62 pages at http://intranet.epa.gov/adplibrary/documents/federalismguide11-00-08.pdf 
195 Although one of the stated purposes of EO 13132 in its first paragraph is “to further the policies of the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), EPA’s $25 
million annual direct cost trigger is 75% lower than the $100 million annual direct cost trigger prescribed in Section 202 of UMRA. 
 

238 

•  Findings for UMRA Impact and Federalism Implication Tests 
 
Based on estimated regulatory costs on state/local governments displayed in Exhibit 4B of this RIA for each regulatory option, Exhibit 7L 
below displays whether the costs potentially exceed the UMRA and Federalism thresholds defined above. 
 

o  UMRA finding: 
 
o  Federalism finding: 

All options >$100 million private sector test; all options <$100 million state/local government test 
All options >$25 million state/local government test; all options <1% state/local government test 

 
However, for consistency with the RFA/SBREFA small business impact analysis presented in a separate section above in this RIA, this RIA 
estimates it is highly likely that the direct compliance costs under each option may be passed-thru to electricity plant customers in the form of 
higher electricity prices.  The feasibility of such a compliance cost pass-thru scenario is evaluated and confirmed by the information presented 
in the RFA/SBREFA small business impact section of this RIA.

1. $25 million threshold test: sub-total State/Local govt cost 
2. 1% Test: State/local govt cost as percentage of State/Local

* Note: 
Remainder Federal government costs represent costs associated with Federally-owned electric utility plants (i.e., Tennessee Valley Authority) which are not 
subject to either the UMRA or Federalism tests.  Therefore, the sub-total private sector direct cost plus the state/local government direct cost does not add-up 
to the total annual cost estimate under each option; the remainder cost is for the Federally-owned plants.

Footnotes: 
* NAICS code 22 electric “utility” generator plants listed in EIA’s 2007 data source at: 
http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia860.html 
**Type of owner entity assigned by EPA ORCR based on business type disclosed in owner name or plant-by-plant internet research on 
type of ownership.  Size class determined according to the following numerical criteria consistent with EPA’s Nov 2006 guidance for 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) compliance: 

• Small non-government = Based on the US Small Business Administration NAICS code 221112 small business size standard of 
<4 million megawatt hours per year total annual electricity generation by all plants owned by the entity. 
• Non-small non-government = Entity’s total annual electricity generation >4 million megawatt hours per year. 
• Small government = Based on the RFA’s definition (5 US Code section 601(5)) of “small government jurisdiction” as the 
government of a city, county, town, township, village, school district, or special district with a population less than 50,000. 
• Non-small government = Entity’s jurisdiction population with more than 50,000 people.
