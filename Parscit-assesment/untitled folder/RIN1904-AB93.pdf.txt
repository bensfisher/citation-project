I. Summary of the Proposed Rule 

The Energy Policy and Conservation 

Act 1 (EPCA), as amended, provides that 
any amended energy conservation 
standard DOE prescribes, including 
those for CCWs, shall be designed to 
‘‘achieve the maximum improvement in 
energy efficiency * * * which the 
Secretary determines is technologically 
feasible and economically justified.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A) and 6316(a)) 
Furthermore, any new or amended 
standard must ‘‘result in significant 
conservation of energy.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)(B) and 6316(a)) In accordance 
with these and other statutory criteria 
discussed in this notice, DOE proposes 
in today’s SNOPR to amend the energy 
conservation standards for CCWs and 
raise efficiency levels as shown in Table 
I.1. The standards would apply to all 
CCWs manufactured in, or imported 
into, the United States 3 years after the 
publication of the final rule in the 
Federal Register.

DOE estimates that the energy 

conservation standards proposed in 
today’s SNOPR would save a significant 
amount of energy—an estimated 0.10 
quadrillion British thermal units (Btu), 
or quads, of cumulative energy over 30 
years (2013–2043). This amount is 
equivalent to 2 days of U.S. gasoline 
use. In addition, today’s proposed 
standards for CCWs save over 143 
billion gallons of cumulative water 
consumption over 30 years (2013–2043). 

The cumulative national net present 

value (NPV) of total consumer costs and 
savings of today’s proposed standards 
from 2013 to 2043, in 2008 dollars 
(2008$), ranges from $0.4 billion (7- 
percent discount rate) to $0.9 billion (3- 
percent discount rate). This is the 
estimated total value of future 
operating-cost savings minus the 
estimated increased equipment costs, 
discounted to the present year (2009). 
DOE estimates the CCW industry net 
present value (INPV) to be 
approximately $62 million in 2008$. If

DOE adopts today’s proposed standards, 
manufacturers expect a decline of 
between 7.8 percent and 11.4 percent of 
the INPV, which is approximately $5 to 
$7 million. However, the NPV for 
consumers (at the 7-percent discount 
rate) would exceed industry losses due 
to energy efficiency standards by at least 
80 times. 

DOE believes that the impacts of 
standards on consumers would be 
positive for CCWs, even though the 
standards may increase some initial 
costs. DOE estimates that today’s 
proposed modified energy factor (MEF) 
and water factor (WF) standards for 
CCWs would increase the retail price by 
$214 per unit for top-loading washers 
and $23 for front-loading washers, but 
the operating cost savings outweigh 
these price increases, resulting in 
positive economic impacts to CCW 
consumers. 

DOE’s analyses indicate that the 

energy savings resulting from today’s 
proposed standards would have benefits 

to utilities and to the environment. The 
energy saved is in the form of electricity 
and natural gas, and DOE expects the 
energy savings from today’s proposed 
standards to eliminate the need for 
approximately 18 megawatts (MW) of 
generating capacity by 2043. This result 
reflects DOE’s use of energy price 
projections from the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA)’s 
April 2009 release of the Annual Energy 
Outlook 2009 (AEO 2009) reflecting 
provisions of the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA 
2009; Pub. L. 111–5). DOE intends to 
use the most recently available version 
of EIA’s AEO to generate the results for 
the final rule. 

In addition, today’s proposed 

standards would have environmental 
benefits, which would be estimated to 
result in cumulative (undiscounted) 
greenhouse gas emission reductions of 
5.1 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) from 2013 to 2043. DOE estimates 
that the range of the monetized value of

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

CO2 emission reductions based on 
global estimates of the value of CO2 is 
$13 million to $140 million at a 7- 
percent discount rate and $28 million to 
$303 million at a 3-percent discount 
rate. The standards for CCWs would 
also result in 3.04 kilotons (kt) of 
nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions 
reductions from 2013 to 2043. The 
standards for CCWs would also possibly 
result in power plant mercury (Hg) 
emissions reductions of up to 0.03 t 
from 2013 to 2043. 

The benefits and costs of today’s 

proposed standards can also be 
expressed in terms of annualized 
(2008$) values from 2013–2043. 
Estimates of annualized values are 
shown in Table I.2. The annualized 
monetary values are the sum of the 
annualized national economic value of 
operating savings benefits (energy, 
maintenance and repair), expressed in 
2008$, plus the monetary values of the 
benefits of carbon dioxide emission 
reductions, otherwise known as the 
Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) expressed 
as $19 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, 

in 2007$. The $19 value is a central 
interim value from a recent interagency 
process. Although this $19 value 
represents emissions that are valued in 
2007$, the monetary benefits of 
cumulative emissions reductions are 
reported in 2008$ so that they can be 
compared with the other costs and 
benefits in the same dollar units. The 
derivation of this value is discussed in 
section V.B.6. Although summing the 
value of operating savings to the values 
of CO2 reductions provides a valuable 
perspective, please note the following: 
1) the national operating savings are 
domestic U.S. consumer monetary 
savings found in market transactions 
while the CO2 value is based on a range 
of estimates of imputed marginal social 
cost of carbon from $5 to $55 per metric 
ton (2007$), which are meant to reflect 
the global benefits of carbon dioxide 
reductions; and 2) the assessments of 
operating savings and CO2 savings are 
performed with different computer 
models, leading to different time frames 
for analysis. The present value of 
national operating savings is measured 

for the period 2013–2065 (31 years from 
2013 to 2043 inclusive, plus the lifetime 
of the longest-lived equipment shipped 
in the 31st year), then converted the 
annualized equivalent for the 31 years. 
The value of CO2, on the other hand is 
meant to reflect the present value of all 
future climate related impacts, even 
those beyond 2065. 

Using a 7-percent discount rate for the 
annualized cost analysis, the combined 
cost of the standards established in 
today’s notice for CCWs is $23.4 million 
per year in increased equipment and 
installation costs, while the annualized 
benefits are $60.6 million per year in 
reduced equipment operating costs and 
$5.1 million in CO2 reductions, for a net 
benefit of $42.2 million per year. Using 
a 3-percent discount rate, the cost of the 
standards established in today’s final 
rule is $22.7 million per year in 
increased equipment and installation 
costs, while the benefits of today’s 
standards are $72.8 million per year in 
reduced operating costs and $5.9 
million in CO2 reductions, for a net 
benefit of $56.0 million per year.

57741 

In sum, today’s proposed standards 

represent the maximum improvement in 
energy and water efficiency that is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified. DOE found that 
the benefits of today’s proposed 
standards (energy and water savings, 
consumer average life-cycle cost (LCC) 
savings, national NPV increase, and 
emissions reductions) outweigh the 
costs (loss of INPV and LCC increases 
for some consumers). DOE has 
concluded that the standards proposed 
in today’s SNOPR are economically 
justified and technologically feasible, 
particularly since units achieving these 
standard levels are already 
commercially available. DOE notes that 
it considered higher efficiency levels as 
trial standard levels (TSLs), and is still 
considering them in this rulemaking; 
however, DOE tentatively believes that 
the burdens of the higher efficiency 
levels (loss of INPV and LCC increases 
for some consumers) outweigh the 
benefits (energy savings, LCC savings for 
some consumers, national NPV increase, 
and emissions reductions). After 
reviewing public comments on this 
SNOPR, DOE may ultimately decide to 
adopt one of the other TSLs or another 
value in between. 
II. Introduction 
A. Consumer Overview 

DOE is proposing in today’s SNOPR 
energy conservation standard levels for 
CCWs as shown in Table I.1 above. 
These proposed standards would apply 
to equipment manufactured or imported 
3 years after the date the final rule is 
published in the Federal Register.2 

DOE research suggests that 

commercial consumers will see benefits 
from today’s proposed standards even 
though DOE expects the purchase price 
of the high efficiency CCWs to increase 
(by 2 to 28 percent) from the average 
price of this equipment today. However, 
the energy efficiency gains are expected 
to result in lower energy and water 
costs, saving consumers $53 to $103 per 
year on their energy and water bills, 
again depending on the equipment 
class. When these savings are summed 
over the lifetime of the equipment, 
consumers are expected to save an 
average of $20 to $190, depending on 
the equipment class, utility costs, and 
other factors. DOE estimates that the 
payback period for the more efficient, 
higher-priced equipment will range 

2 DOE anticipates publishing a final rule for 

commercial clothes washer energy conservation 
standards by January 1, 2010, pursuant to the 
requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 
(EPACT 2005; Pub. L. 109–058), which would make 
any amended standards effective on January 1, 
2013.

from 0.2 to 5.6 years, depending on the 
equipment class. 
B. Authority 

Title III of EPCA sets forth a variety 

of provisions designed to improve 
energy efficiency. Part A–1 of Title III 
(42 U.S.C. 6311–6317) establishes an 
energy conservation program for 
‘‘Certain Industrial Equipment,’’ which 
deals with a variety of commercial and 
industrial equipment (referred to 
hereafter as ‘‘covered equipment’’) 
including CCWs. (42 U.S.C. 6312; 
6313(e)) EPCA sets both energy and 
water efficiency standards for CCWs, 
and authorizes DOE to amend both. (42 
U.S.C. 6313(e)) 

Section 136(a) and (e) of the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005; Pub. 
L. 109–058) added CCWs as equipment 
covered under EPCA and established 
standards for such equipment that is 
manufactured on or after January 1, 
2007.3 (42 U.S.C. 6311(1) and 6313(e)) 
These amendments to EPCA also require 
that DOE issue a final rule by January 
1, 2010, to determine whether these 
standards should be amended. (EPACT 
2005, section 136(e); 42 U.S.C. 6313(e)) 
If amended standards are justified, they 
would become effective no later than 
January 1, 2013. (Id.) 

It is pursuant to the authority set forth 

above that DOE is conducting the 
present rulemaking for CCWs. The 
following discusses some of the key 
provisions of EPCA relevant to this 
standards-setting rulemaking. 

Under EPCA, the overall program 

consists of the following core elements: 
(1) Testing; (2) labeling; and (3) Federal 
energy conservation standards. The 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is 
responsible for labeling equipment 
covered by part A, and DOE implements 
the remainder of the program. Under 42 
U.S.C. 6293 and 6314, EPCA authorizes 
DOE, subject to certain criteria and 
conditions, to develop test procedures 
to measure the energy efficiency, energy 
use, or estimated annual operating cost 
of covered equipment. The test 
procedures for CCWs appear at 10 CFR 
part 430, subpart B, appendix J1 
(pursuant to 10 CFR 431.154). 

EPCA provides criteria for prescribing 

new or amended standards for covered 
products and equipment.4 As indicated 

3 Under the statute, a CCW must have a modified 

energy factor (MEF) of at least 1.26 and a water 
factor (WF) of not more than 9.5. 

4 The EPCA provisions discussed in the 

remainder of this subsection directly apply to 
covered products, and also apply to certain covered 
equipment, such as CCWs, by virtue of 42 U.S.C. 
6316(a). Note that the term ‘‘product’’ is used 
generally to refer to consumer appliances, while 
‘‘equipment’’ is used generally to refer to 
commercial units. 

above, any new or amended standard 
must be designed to achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A) and 6316(a)) The 
statute also provides that, in deciding 
whether a standard is economically 
justified, DOE must, after receiving 
comments on the proposed standard, 
determine whether the benefits of the 
standard exceed its burdens by 
considering, to the greatest extent 
practicable, the following seven factors: 

(1) The economic impact of the 

standard on manufacturers and 
consumers of the products or equipment 
subject to the standard; 

(2) The savings in operating costs 

throughout the estimated average life of 
the covered products or equipment in 
the type (or class) compared to any 
increase in the price, initial charges, or 
maintenance expenses for the covered 
products that are likely to result from 
the imposition of the standard; 

(3) The total projected amount of 

energy (or, as applicable, water) savings 
likely to result directly from the 
imposition of the standard; 

(4) Any lessening of the utility or the 
performance of the covered products or 
equipment likely to result from the 
imposition of the standard; 

(5) The impact of any lessening of 

competition, as determined in writing 
by the Attorney General, that is likely to 
result from the imposition of the 
standard; 

(6) The need for national energy and 

water conservation; and 

(7) Other factors the Secretary 

considers relevant. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 6316(a)) 

Furthermore, EPCA contains what is 

commonly known as an ‘‘anti- 
backsliding’’ provision. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(1)) This provision prohibits the 
Secretary from prescribing any amended 
standard that either increases the 
maximum allowable energy use or 
decreases the minimum required energy 
efficiency of a covered product or 
equipment. Also, the Secretary may not 
prescribe an amended or a new standard 
if the Secretary finds that interested 
persons have established by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the 
standard is likely to result in the 
unavailability in the United States of 
any product type (or class) with 
performance characteristics, features, 
sizes, capacities, and volume that are 
substantially the same as those generally 
available in the United States at the time 
of the Secretary’s finding. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(4)) 

In addition, EPCA, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)), establishes a

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

rebuttable presumption that a standard 
is economically justified if the Secretary 
finds that ‘‘the additional cost to the 
consumer of purchasing a product 
complying with an energy conservation 
standard level will be less than three 
times the value of the energy (and as 
applicable, water) savings during the 
first year that the consumer will receive 
as a result of the standard,’’ as 
calculated under the test procedure in 
place for that standard. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) See Section II.G.2. 

In promulgating a standard for a type 

or class of covered product or 
equipment that has two or more 
subcategories, DOE must specify a 
different standard level from that which 
applies generally to such type or class 
of products or equipment ‘‘for any group 
of covered products which have the 
same function or intended use, if * * * 
covered products within such group— 
(A) consume a different kind of energy 
from that consumed by other covered 
products within such type (or class); or 
(B) have a capacity or other 
performance-related feature which other 
products within such type (or class) do 
not have and such feature justifies a 
higher or lower standard’’ than applies 
or will apply to the other products. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(q)(1)) In determining 
whether a performance-related feature 
justifies such a different standard for a 
group of equipment, DOE must consider 
‘‘such factors as the utility to the 
consumer of such a feature’’ and other 
factors DOE deems appropriate. Id. Any 
rule prescribing such a standard must 
include an explanation of the basis on 
which such higher or lower level was 
established. (42 U.S.C. 6295(q)(2)) 

Federal energy conservation 

requirements generally supersede State 
laws or regulations concerning energy 
conservation testing, labeling, and 
standards. (42 U.S.C. 6297(a)–(c)) DOE 
can, however, grant waivers of Federal 
preemption for particular State laws or 
regulations, in accordance with the 
procedures and other provisions of 
EPCA found in 42 U.S.C. 6297(d). 
Specifically, States that regulate an 
energy conservation standard for a type 
of covered product for which there is a 
Federal energy conservation standard 
may petition the Secretary for a DOE 
rule that allows the State regulation to 
become effective with respect to such 
covered product. (42 U.S.C. 
6297(d)(1)(A)) DOE must prescribe a 
rule granting the petition if the 
Secretary finds that the State has 

established by a preponderance of the 
evidence that its regulation is needed to 
meet ‘‘unusual and compelling State or 
local energy * * * interests.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6297(d)(1)(B)) 
C. Background 
1. Current Standards 

EPCA, as amended by EPACT 2005, 

prescribes energy conservation 
standards for CCWs manufactured on or 
after January 1, 2007. (42 U.S.C. 6313(e)) 
These standards require that CCWs have 
an MEF of at least 1.26 cubic feet of 
capacity (ft3) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) 
and a WF of not more than 9.5 gallons 
of water (gal) per ft3. (Id.; 10 CFR 
431.156) 
2. History of Standards Rulemaking 

To initiate the current rulemaking to 

consider energy conservation standards, 
on March 15, 2006, DOE published on 
its Web site a document titled, 
Rulemaking Framework for Commercial 
Clothes Washers and Residential 
Dishwashers, Dehumidifiers, and 
Cooking Products (Framework 
Document).5 71 FR 15059 (March 27, 
2006). The Framework Document 
described the procedural and analytical 
approaches that DOE anticipated using 
to evaluate energy conservation 
standards for these products, and 
identified various issues to be resolved 
in conducting the rulemaking. DOE held 
a public meeting on April 27, 2006, to 
present the Framework Document, to 
describe the analyses it planned to 
conduct during the rulemaking, to 
receive comments from interested 
parties, and to inform and facilitate 
interested parties’ involvement in the 
rulemaking. DOE received 11 written 
comments in response to the Framework 
Document after the public meeting. 

On December 4, 2006, DOE posted 

two spreadsheet tools for this 
rulemaking on its Web site.6 The first 
tool calculates LCC and payback periods 
(PBPs) and included spreadsheets for: 
(1) Dishwashers; (2) dehumidifiers; (3) 
cooktops; (4) ovens; (5) microwave 
ovens; and (6) CCWs. The second tool— 
the national impact analysis (NIA) 
spreadsheets—calculate the impacts on 
shipments and the national energy

savings (NES) and NPV at various 
candidate standard levels for: (1) 
Dishwashers; (2) dehumidifiers; (3) 
cooktops and ovens; (4) microwave 
ovens; and (5) CCWs. 

DOE published the advance notice of 
proposed rulemaking (ANOPR) for this 
rulemaking on November 15, 2007 
(November 2007 ANOPR) (72 FR 
64432), and held a public meeting on 
December 13, 2007, to present and seek 
comment on the November 2007 
ANOPR analytical methodology and 
results. The November 2007 ANOPR 
included background information on the 
history and conduct of this rulemaking. 
72 FR 64432, 64438–39 (Nov. 15, 2007) 
In the November 2007 ANOPR, DOE 
described and sought further comment 
on the analytical framework, models, 
and tools (e.g., LCC and NIA 
spreadsheets) it was using to analyze the 
impacts of energy conservation 
standards for these products. In 
conjunction with the November 2007 
ANOPR, DOE also posted on its Web 
site the complete November 2007 
ANOPR technical support document 
(TSD). The TSD included the results of 
a number of DOE’s preliminary 
analyses, including: (1) The market and 
technology assessment; (2) screening 
analysis; (3) engineering analysis; (4) 
energy and water use determination; (5) 
markups analysis to determine 
equipment price; (6) LCC and PBP 
analyses; (7) shipments analysis; (8) 
NIA; and (9) manufacturer impact 
analysis (MIA). In the November 2007 
ANOPR and at the public meeting, DOE 
invited comment in particular on the 
following issues concerning CCWs: (1) 
Product classes; (2) horizontal-axis 
designs; (3) technologies unable to be 
analyzed and exempted product classes, 
including potential limitations of 
existing test procedures; (4) per-cycle 
energy consumption; (5) consumer 
prices; (6) repair and maintenance costs; 
(7) efficiency distributions in the base 
case; (8) shipments forecasts; (9) base- 
case and standards-case forecasted 
efficiencies; and (10) TSLs. 72 FR 
64432, 64512–14 (Nov. 15, 2007). 

On October 17, 2008, DOE published 

a NOPR (October 2008 NOPR) in the 
Federal Register, in which it proposed 
amended energy conservation standards 
for certain products and equipment, 
including CCWs. 73 FR 62034. The 
energy conservation standards proposed 
in the October 2008 NOPR for CCWs are 
shown in Table II.1.

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

described and sought further comment 
on the analytical framework, models, 
and tools (e.g., LCC and NIA 
spreadsheets) it was using to analyze the 
impacts of energy conservation 
standards for this equipment. In 
conjunction with the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE also posted on its Web site 
the complete technical support 
document (TSD), which along with the 
October 2008 NOPR, is available at 
http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ 
appliance_standards/. The TSD 
included the results of a number of 
DOE’s analyses, including: (1) The 
market and technology assessment; (2) 
screening analysis; (3) engineering 
analysis; (4) energy and water use 
determination; (5) markups analysis to 
determine equipment price; (6) LCC and 
PBP analyses; (7) shipments analysis; (8) 
NES and national impact analyses; and 
(9) MIA. In the October 2008 NOPR and 
at the public meeting held on November 
13, 2008 (referred to as the ‘‘November 
2008 public meeting’’), DOE invited 
comment in particular on the following 
issues concerning CCWs: (1) The 
efficiency levels; (2) DOE’s 
determination of the maximum 
technologically feasible (max-tech) 
efficiency levels for top-loading and 
front-loading CCWs; (3) the magnitude 
of possible equipment class shifting to 
front-loading CCWs; (4) the analysis and 
data relevant to the price elasticity of 
demand for calculating the anticipated 
energy and water savings at different 
TSLs; (5) the analysis of consumer 
knowledge of the Federal ENERGY 
STAR program and its potential as a 
resource for increasing knowledge of the 
availability and benefits of energy 
efficient appliances in the home 
appliance consumer market; (6) 
discount rates other than 7 percent and 
3 percent real to discount future 
emissions reductions; (7) data that 
might enable DOE to test for market 
failures or other specific problems for 
CCWs; and (8) the determination of 
anticipated environmental impacts of 
the standards proposed in the October 
2008 NOPR, particularly with respect to 
the methods for valuing the expected 
CO2 and NOX emissions savings. 73 FR 
62034, 62133 (Oct. 17, 2008).

The October 2008 NOPR also 

included background information, in 
addition to that set forth above, on the 
history and conduct of this rulemaking. 
73 FR 62034, 62040–62041 (Oct. 17, 
2008). DOE presented the 
methodologies and results for the 
October 2008 NOPR analyses at the 
November 2008 public meeting. 
Comments presented by interested 
parties during this meeting and 
submitted in response to the October 
2008 NOPR concerning the accuracy of 
the stated max-tech CCW efficiency 
level led to a thorough investigation of 
CCW efficiencies and today’s SNOPR. 
DOE subsequently tested the max-tech 
unit at an independent test facility, 
revised the max-tech level, updated the 
analysis, and is publishing the SNOPR 
to allow interested parties to comment 
on the revised efficiency level 
proposals. 

DOE expects to issue a final rule in 

this rulemaking no later than January 1, 
2010, as required by EPCA, as amended 
by EPACT 2005 (42 U.S.C. 6313(e)). 
Based on this schedule, the estimated 
effective date of any amended energy 
conservation standards for this 
equipment would be January 1, 2013, 3 
years after the final rule is published in 
the Federal Register. 
D. Test Procedures 

EPCA directs DOE to use the same test 

procedures for CCWs as those 
established by DOE for residential 
clothes washers (RCWs). (42 U.S.C. 
6314(a)(8)) 73 FR 62034, 62043–62044 
(Oct. 17, 2008). While DOE believes 
commercial laundry practices likely 
differ from residential practices,7 DOE 
concluded in the October 2008 NOPR 
that the existing clothes washer test 
procedure (at 10 CFR part 430, subpart 
B, appendix J1) adequately accounts for 
the efficiency rating of CCWs, and that 
DOE’s methods for characterizing 
energy and water use in the October 
2008 NOPR analyses adequately 
accounted for the consumer usage 
patterns specific to CCWs. 

In response to the October 2008 
NOPR, Alliance Laundry Systems 
(Alliance), GE Consumer & Industrial 

7 CCWs are typically used more frequently and 

filled with a larger load than RCWs. 

(GE), and AHAM agreed with DOE’s 
conclusion that the DOE clothes washer 
test procedure is adequate for rating 
CCWs. (Alliance, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 22; Alliance, 
No. 45 at p. 1; GE, No. 48 at p. 4; 
AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at pp. 26–27; AHAM, No. 47 at 
p.4) 8 DOE did not receive any 
comments objecting to the use of the 
DOE clothes washer test procedure for 
CCWs. Therefore DOE continues to 
consider the existing DOE test 
procedure adequate to measure energy 
and water consumption of CCWs. 
E. Technological Feasibility 
1. General 

DOE considers a design option to be 

technologically feasible if it is in use by 
the respective industry or if research has 
progressed to the development of a 
working prototype. Therefore, in each 
standards rulemaking, DOE conducts a 
screening analysis, based on 
information it has gathered regarding 
existing technology options and 
prototype designs. In consultation with 
manufacturers, design engineers, and 
other interested parties, DOE develops a 
list of design options for consideration 
in the rulemaking. Once DOE has 
determined that a particular design 
option is technologically feasible, it 
further evaluates each design option in 
light of the following three additional 
criteria: (a) Practicability to 
manufacture, install, and service; (b) 
adverse impacts on product utility or 
availability; or (c) adverse impacts on 
health or safety. 10 CFR part 430, 
subpart C, appendix A, section 4(a)(3) 
and (4). All design options that pass 
these screening criteria are candidates 
for further assessment in the 
engineering and subsequent analyses in 
the NOPR (or SNOPR) stage. 

DOE published a list of evaluated 
CCW technologies in the November 
2007 ANOPR. 72 FR 64432, 64458 (Nov. 
15, 2007). For the reasons described in 

8 A notation in the form ‘‘Alliance, No. 45 at p. 

1’’ identifies a written comment (1) made by 
Alliance Laundry Systems (Alliance), (2) recorded 
in document number 45 that is filed in the docket 
of this rulemaking (Docket No. EE–2006–STD– 
0127), maintained in the Resource Room of the 
Building Technologies Program, and (3) which 
appears on page 1 of document number 45.

57744 

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

the November 2007 ANOPR and in 
chapter 4 of the SNOPR TSD, DOE is not 
considering the following design 
options, as they do not meet one or 
more of the screening criteria: bubble 
action, electrolytic disassociation of 
water, ozonated laundering, reduced 
thermal mass, suds saving, and 
ultrasonic washing. In this 
supplemental notice, DOE has not 
screened out any additional technology 
options that were retained in the 
October 2008 NOPR analyses. No 
comments were received objecting to 
the technology options which were 
screened out in the October 2008 NOPR. 
73 FR 62034, 62052 (Oct. 17, 2008). 
Therefore, DOE believes all of the 

efficiency levels evaluated in this 
notice, which are based upon the 
retained design options, are 
technologically feasible. For more detail 
on DOE’s method for developing CCW 
technology options and the process for 
screening these options, refer to the 
chapters 3 and 4 of the SNOPR TSD. 
2. Maximum Technologically Feasible 
Levels 

When DOE considers an amended or 

new standard for a type (or class) of 
equipment such as front-loading or top- 
loading CCWs, it must ‘‘determine the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency or maximum reduction in 
energy use that is technologically 
feasible’’ for such equipment. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(p)(2) and 6316(a)) For the October 
2008 NOPR, DOE determined the max- 
tech efficiency levels for front-loading 
and top-loading CCWs in the 
engineering analysis, based on 
published MEF and WF values of 
commercially available equipment. (See 
chapter 5 in the NOPR TSD.) In 
proposing these max-tech levels, DOE 
noted that some CCWs exceed the max- 
tech MEF or WF levels, but not both. 
For example, two front-loading models 
exceed the max-tech MEF—they are 
rated at 2.45 and 2.68 MEF, 
respectively, in the Consortium for 
Energy Efficiency (CEE) qualifying 
product list for its Commercial, Family- 
Sized Washer Initiative—but don’t 
achieve a max-tech WF level—they are 
rated at 5.69 and 5.47 WF, respectively. 
In the California Energy Commission 
(CEC) equipment database for CCWs, 
DOE found one top-loading model that 
exceeds the max-tech WF—it is rated at 
7.3 WF—but not the max-tech MEF 
level—it is rated at 1.32 WF. This model 
has been discontinued, as discussed in 
the November 2007 ANOPR and the 
October 2008 NOPR TSD. The max-tech 
efficiency levels proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR were selected to 
represent the best available 

combinations of high MEF and low WF 
for each equipment class. 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

proposed the max-tech levels shown in 
Table II.2. 73 FR 62034, 62036 (Oct. 17, 
2008).

According to the CEE database, three 

front-loading CCWs rated at the max- 
tech efficiency level are on the market 
in the United States. One model listed 
in the database which exceeds the max- 
tech level is rated at (2.84 MEF/3.68 
WF), but DOE determined this CCW has 
yet to be sold in the United States. The 
front-loading max-tech level was based 
on a single model listed in the CEC 
database. 

The max-tech top-loading CCW 

efficiency rating in the October 2008 
NOPR was questioned by Alliance at the 
November 2008 NOPR meeting. 
(Alliance, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at pp. 90–92) In response, DOE 
contracted an independent testing 
laboratory to verify the performance 
ratings for the max-tech top-loading 
CCW. The laboratory results (based on 
a 3-unit sample) suggest that the unit 
achieves 1.63 MEF/8.4 WF. Based on 
this information, for the SNOPR 
analysis, DOE revised the max-tech top- 
loading CCW level downward to 1.60 
MEF/8.5 WF, a level proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR as a ‘‘gap-fill’’ level 
and one which DOE concludes is 
attainable by the max-tech CCW model. 
For more details on this selection of 
max-tech levels for the SNOPR, see 
section III.C.1 of today’s supplemental 
notice. 

In sum, Table II.3 lists the max-tech 

levels that DOE is proposing for today’s 
SNOPR. Today’s proposed front-loading 
max-tech level is the same as in the 
October 2008 NOPR, whereas today’s 
proposed top-loading max-tech level has 
been revised based on the independent 
test results.

F. Energy Savings 
1. Determination of Savings 

DOE used its NIA spreadsheet tool to 
estimate energy savings from amended 
standards for CCWs. (Section III.E of 
today’s supplemental notice and chapter 
11 of the SNOPR TSD describe the NIA 
spreadsheet model.) DOE forecasted 
energy savings over the period of 
analysis (beginning in 2013, the year 
that amended standards would go into 
effect, and ending in 2043) for each TSL, 
relative to the base case, which 
represents the forecast of energy 
consumption in the absence of amended 
energy conservation standards. DOE 
quantified the energy savings 
attributable to amended energy 
conservation standards as the difference 
in energy consumption between the 
standards case and the base case. The 
base case represents the forecast of 
energy consumption in the absence of 
amended energy conservation 
standards. The base case considers 
market demand for more efficient 
equipment. 

The NIA spreadsheet tool calculates 
the electricity savings in ‘‘site energy’’ 
expressed in kWh. Site energy is the 
energy directly consumed on location 
by an individual equipment. DOE 
reports national energy savings on an 
annual basis in terms of the aggregated 
source energy savings, which is the 
savings of energy that is used to 
generate and transmit the energy 
consumed at the site. To convert site 
energy to source energy, DOE derived 
conversion factors, which change with 
time, from the March 2009 release of the 
AEO 2009. (See TSD chapter 11 
accompanying today’s supplemental 
notice for further details.) 
2. Significance of Savings 

EPCA, as amended, prohibits DOE 

from adopting a standard for a product 
if that standard would not result in 
‘‘significant’’ energy savings. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)(B)) While the Act does not 
define the term ‘‘significant,’’ the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia, in Natural Resources Defense 
Council v. Herrington, 768 F.2d 1355,

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

57745 

1373 (D.C. Cir. 1985), indicated that 
Congress intended ‘‘significant’’ energy 
savings in this context to be savings that 
were not ‘‘genuinely trivial.’’ The energy 
savings for energy conservation 
standards at each of the TSLs 
considered in this rulemaking are 
nontrivial, and, therefore, DOE 
considers them ‘‘significant’’ within the 
meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B). 
G. Economic Justification 
1. Specific Criteria 

As noted earlier, EPCA provides 

seven factors to be evaluated in 
determining whether an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)). The 
following sections discuss how DOE has 
addressed each of those seven factors in 
this rulemaking. 
a. Economic Impact on Manufacturers 
and Consumers 

DOE uses an annual-cash-flow 

approach in determining the 
quantitative impacts of a new or 
amended standard on manufacturers. 
This includes both a short-term 
assessment, based on the cost and 
capital requirements during the period 
between the announcement of a 
regulation and the time when the 
regulation becomes effective, and a 
long-term assessment. The impacts 
analyzed include INPV (which values 
the industry on the basis of expected 
future cash flows), cash flows by year, 
changes in revenue and income, and 
other measures of impact, as 
appropriate. Second, DOE analyzes and 
reports the impacts on different types of 
manufacturers, with particular attention 
to impacts on small manufacturers. 
Third, DOE considers the impact of 
standards on domestic manufacturer 
employment, manufacturing capacity, 
plant closures, and loss of capital 
investment. DOE also takes into account 
cumulative impacts of different 
regulations on manufacturers. For more 
details on this analysis, see section III.G. 
For commercial consumers, measures 
of economic impact include the changes 
in LCC and payback period for the 
equipment at each TSL. Under EPCA, 
the LCC is one of the seven factors to be 
considered in determining economic 
justification. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(II)) It is discussed in 
detail in the section below. 
b. Life-Cycle Costs 

The LCC is the sum of the purchase 

price of equipment (including the 
installation) and the operating expense 
(including energy and maintenance 

expenditures), discounted over the 
lifetime of the equipment. 

In this rulemaking, DOE calculated 
both LCC and LCC savings for various 
CCW efficiency levels. DOE established 
the variability and uncertainty in energy 
and water use by defining the 
uncertainty and variability in the use 
(cycles per day) of the equipment. The 
variability in energy and water pricing 
were characterized by regional 
differences in energy and water prices. 
To account for uncertainty and 
variability in other inputs, such as 
equipment lifetime and discount rate, 
DOE used a distribution of values with 
probabilities attached to each value. For 
each consumer with a CCW, DOE 
sampled the values of these inputs from 
the probability distributions. As a result, 
the analysis produced a range of LCCs. 
This approach permits DOE to identify 
the percentage of consumers achieving 
LCC savings or attaining certain payback 
values due to an increased energy 
conservation standard, in addition to 
the average LCC savings or average 
payback for that standard. DOE presents 
the LCC savings as a distribution, with 
a mean value and a range. In the 
analysis prepared for the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE assumed that the consumer 
will purchase the equipment in 2012. 
For today’s SNOPR, that assumption has 
been changed to 2013 due to the 
expected effective date of any amended 
standards. See section III.D for more 
details on the analysis. 
c. Energy Savings 

While significant conservation of 

energy is a separate statutory 
requirement for imposing an energy 
conservation standard, EPCA requires 
DOE, in determining the economic 
justification of a proposed standard, to 
consider the total projected energy 
savings that are expected to result 
directly from the standard. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(III)) As in the October 
2008 NOPR, DOE used the NIA 
spreadsheet results in its consideration 
of total projected savings expected to be 
directly attributable to the considered 
standard levels. See section III.E for 
more details on this analysis. 
d. Lessening of Utility or Performance of 
Equipment 

In establishing classes of equipment, 
DOE considered whether the evaluated 
design options would likely lessen the 
utility or performance of CCWs. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV)) In the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE determined 
that none of the considered TSLs would 
reduce the utility or performance of the 
equipment under consideration in the 
rulemaking. Specifically, the standards 

proposed in the October 2008 NOPR 
would maintain the consumer utility of 
washing clothes in a washer with either 
top or front access. 73 FR 62034, 62047 
(Oct. 17, 2008). This conclusion remains 
the same for the proposed standards in 
today’s SNOPR. As in the October 2008 
NOPR, the efficiency levels considered 
in today’s SNOPR for both equipment 
classes require no changes in equipment 
design or unusual installation 
requirements that could reduce the 
utility or performance of CCWs. 
e. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 

EPCA directs DOE to consider any 

lessening of competition that is likely to 
result from standards. It directs the 
Attorney General to determine the 
impact, if any, of any lessening of 
competition likely to result from a 
proposed standard and to transmit such 
determination to the Secretary, not later 
than 60 days after the publication of a 
proposed rule, together with an analysis 
of the nature and extent of such impact. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and 
(B)(ii)). DOE received the Attorney 
General’s determination dated 
December 16, 2008. It is discussed in 
section V.B.5 below, and is reprinted at 
the end of this SNOPR. Impacts on 
manufacturers are also discussed in 
section III.G below. 
f. Need of the Nation To Conserve 
Energy 

The non-monetary benefits of today’s 

proposed standards are likely to be 
reflected in improvements to the 
security and reliability of the Nation’s 
energy system–namely, reductions in 
the overall demand for energy will 
result in reduced costs for maintaining 
reliability of the Nation’s electricity 
system. DOE conducts a utility impact 
analysis to estimate how standards may 
impact the Nation’s needed power 
generation capacity. This analysis 
captures the effects of efficiency 
improvements on electricity 
consumption by the equipment which is 
the subject of this rulemaking. 

Today’s proposed standards also are 
likely to result in improvements to the 
environment. In quantifying these 
improvements, DOE has defined a range 
of primary energy conversion factors 
and associated emissions reductions 
based on the estimated level of power 
generation displaced by energy 
conservation standards. DOE reports the 
environmental effects from each TSL in 
an environmental assessment in chapter 
16 of the SNOPR TSD. (42. U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 6316(a)) See 
section III.J for more details on this 
analysis.

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

g. Other Factors 

The Secretary, in determining 

whether a standard is economically 
justified, may consider other factors that 
the Secretary deems to be relevant. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII)) In 
considering amended standards for 
today’s SNOPR, the Secretary found no 
relevant factors other than those 
identified elsewhere in today’s SNOPR. 
2. Rebuttable Presumption 

As set forth under 42 U.S.C. 

6295(o)(2)(B)(iii), there is a rebuttable 
presumption that an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified if the increased installed cost 
for equipment that meets the standard is 
less than three times the value of the 
first-year energy savings resulting from 
the standard (and water savings in the 
case of a water efficiency standard). 
DOE’s LCC and PBP analyses generate 
values that calculate the payback period 
for consumers of equipment meeting 
potential energy conservation standards, 
which includes, but is not limited to, 
the 3-year payback period contemplated 
under the rebuttable presumption test 
discussed above. (See chapter 8 of the 
TSD that accompanies this notice.) 
However, DOE routinely conducts a full 
economic analysis that considers the 
full range of impacts, including those to 
the consumer, manufacturer, Nation, 
and environment, as required under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i). The results of 
this analysis serve as the basis for DOE 
to definitively evaluate the economic 
justification for a potential standard 
level (thereby supporting or rebutting 
the results of any preliminary 
determination of economic 
justification). Section III.D.13 of today’s 
supplemental notice addresses the 
rebuttable-presumption payback 
calculation. 
III. Methodology and Revisions to the 
Analyses Employed in the October 2008 
Proposed Rule 

DOE used economic models to 

estimate the impacts of the TSLs used 
in weighing the benefits and burdens of 
amended standards for the equipment 
that is the subject of this rulemaking. 
Specifically, DOE developed the 
relationship between cost and efficiency 
for this equipment, and calculated the 
simple payback period for the purposes 
of addressing the rebuttable 
presumption that a standard with a 
payback period of less than 3 years is 
economically justified. The LCC 
spreadsheet calculates the consumer 
benefits and payback periods for 
amended energy conservation 
standards. The NIA spreadsheet

provides shipments forecasts and then 
calculates NES and NPV impacts of 
potential amended energy conservation 
standards. DOE also assessed 
manufacturer impacts, largely through 
use of the Government Regulatory 
Impact Model (GRIM). 

Additionally, DOE estimated the 

impacts of energy conservation 
standards due to equipment on utilities 
and the environment. DOE used a 
version of EIA’s National Energy 
Modeling System (NEMS) for the utility 
and environmental analyses. The NEMS 
model simulates the energy economy of 
the United States and has been 
developed over several years by the EIA 
primarily for the purpose of preparing 
the AEO. The NEMS produces forecasts 
for the United States that are available 
in the public domain. The version of 
NEMS used for appliance standards 
analysis is called NEMS–BT and is 
primarily based on the AEO 2009 April 
Release with minor modifications.9 The 
NEMS–BT offers a sophisticated picture 
of the effect of standards, since it 
accounts for the interactions between 
the various energy supply and demand 
sectors and the economy as a whole. 
A. Equipment Classes 

In general, when evaluating and 

establishing energy conservation 
standards, DOE divides covered 
products or equipment into classes by 
the type of energy used, capacity, or 
other performance-related features that 
affect consumer utility and efficiency. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(q); 6316(a)) Different 
energy conservation standards may 
apply to different equipment classes. Id. 

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

proposed separate equipment classes 
and accompanying standards for top- 
loading and front-loading CCWs with 
separate standards for each class. 73 FR 
62034, 62036 (Oct. 17, 2008). Thus the 
October 2008 NOPR represented a 
change from the November 2007 
ANOPR and from EPACT 2005 10, which 
placed all CCWs into a single equipment 
class with a single energy efficiency and 
water efficiency standard. The October 
2008 NOPR stated that DOE believes it 
has the authority to establish additional 

9 The EIA approves the use of the name NEMS to 
describe only an AEO version of the model without 
any modification to code or data. Because the 
present analysis entails some minor code 
modifications and runs the model under various 
policy scenarios that deviate from AEO 
assumptions, the name NEMS–BT refers to the 
model as used here. (‘‘BT’’ stands for DOE’s 
Building Technologies Program.) For more 
information on NEMS, refer to The National Energy 
Modeling System: An Overview, DOE/EIA–0581 (98) 
(Feb. 1998)(available at: http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ 
FTPROOT/forecasting/058198.pdf). 

10 42 U.S.C. 6313(e); codified at 10 CFR 431.156. 

equipment classes within an equipment 
category, if warranted. DOE determined 
in the October 2008 NOPR that two 
equipment classes are warranted 
because an amended standard would set 
MEF for all CCWs at a level significantly 
higher than what the max-tech for top- 
loading machines can attain today, and 
effectively eliminate top-loading CCWs 
from the market. Id. 

DOE explained the basis of its 

authority to establish separate classes, 
and noted that it had previously 
established and used classes for 
residential clothes washers (RCW) in 
previous rulemakings and had cited the 
likely elimination of one of these classes 
as one of several reasons for denying the 
California Energy Commission’s (CEC) 
petition for waiver from Federal 
preemption of its RCW regulation. DOE 
then concluded that, ‘‘Given the 
similarities in technologies and design 
and operating characteristics between 
RCWs and CCWs, * * * the axis of 
access must be accorded similar 
treatment in the context of the current 
CCW rulemaking.’’ DOE also asserted 
that, ‘‘If DOE were to propose an 
amended standard for CCWs under the 
statutory criteria set forth in EPCA 
based upon a single product class, the 
result would be a standard that would 
effectively eliminate top-loading CCW’s 
from the market * * *;’’

(Whirlpool), and AHAM supported the 
two equipment classes as proposed in

machines. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at pp.

that a horizontal-axis CCW, like some 
horizontal-axis residential models, 
could be designed with top-loading 
access through a hatch. (EJ, Public

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

57747 

The Joint Comment stated that the 
ability to load a CCW from the front is 
substantially the same as the ability to 
load from the top. (Joint Comment, No. 
44 at appendix A, pp. 1–4) Thus, the 
unavailability of top-loading CCWs 
would have no effect on equipment 
utility. 

In response to the EarthJustice, DOE 

examined the potential use of top- 
loading, horizontal-axis machines in the 
CCW market. While a top-loading 
horizontal-axis design can provide 
access similar to traditional vertical-axis 
clothes washers, the consumer utility of 
a top-loading, horizontal-axis clothes 
washer may not be sufficiently 
comparable to that of a top-loading, 
vertical-axis clothes washer, since users 
of top-loading horizontal-axis units 
must perform multiple actions to undo 
and re-secure the hatch every time they 
access the inside of the wash basket. 
DOE research suggests that the added 
complication in loading and unloading 
such a clothes washer appears to be 
more relevant in a shared laundry and 
laundromat setting and less relevant in 
an institutional setting due to consumer 
education issues. In any case, DOE 
knows of no top-loading, horizontal-axis 
machines in the U.S. market for CCWs. 

As discussed in the October 2008 

NOPR, DOE concluded that the method 
of ‘‘loading’’ clothes (i.e., the axis of 
access) is a ‘‘feature’’ of RCWs within 
the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(4). 
Due to similarities in technologies and 
in design and operating characteristics 
between RCWs and CCWs, the axis of 
access may also be considered a feature 
in the context of this CCW rulemaking. 
Therefore, DOE tentatively concludes 
that top-loading, vertical-axis CCWs 
provide unique utility, and that, as 
determined in the October 2008 NOPR, 
axis of access is a feature pursuant to 
EPCA. Thus, DOE is retaining the two 
proposed equipment classes from the 
October 2008 NOPR in today’s SNOPR. 
DOE seeks comment as to whether the 
method of ‘‘loading’’ clothes washers, or 
any other characteristic commonly 
associated with traditional ‘‘top- 
loading’’ or ‘‘front-loading’’ clothes 
washers are ‘‘features’’ within the 
meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(4) in 
EPCA and whether the availability of 
such feature(s) would likely be affected 
by eliminating the separate classes for 
these equipment types previously 
established by DOE. This is identified as 
Issue 1 in section VII.E of today’s 
supplemental notice (Issues on Which 
DOE Seeks Comment.) 

As noted above, in the October 2008 

NOPR, DOE took the position that EPCA 
does not permit adoption of a standard 
that would eliminate top-loading CCWs 

because the method of loading is a 
‘‘feature.’’ 73 FR 62034, 62049–50. 
Furthermore, in DOE’s denial of the 
CEC’s petition for waiver from Federal 
preemption (71 FR 78157 (December 28, 
2006)) and the ensuing litigation, 
California Energy Commission v. DOE, 
Case. No. 07–71576 (9th Cir.), DOE took 
the position that it could not waive 
Federal preemption, in part because the 
proposed California regulation of 
residential clothes washer water usage 
would result in the unavailability of 
top-loading residential clothes washers 
in the California market, based on DOE’s 
evaluation of the clothes washer market 
in 2006. 

DOE is willing to reconsider its 

previous conclusions as part of this 
rulemaking. More specifically, DOE is 
soliciting public comments on whether 
one or more of the characteristics 
commonly associated with different 
types of clothes washers, such as 
method of loading, presence or absence 
of agitators, ability to interrupt cycles, 
and possibly others, provide consumer 
utility that should, under existing law, 
be recognized and protected by DOE 
through the maintenance or 
establishment of separate equipment 
classes. DOE also seeks comments as to 
whether, as a consequence of market 
and technology developments, it should 
maintain the same equipment classes for 
commercial clothes washers as it does 
for residential clothes washers. 

DOE notes that, if warranted by the 

public comments received and its 
further consideration of this issue, it 
were to establish a single equipment 
class in setting standards for CCWs, 
DOE intends to give considerable weight 
to the potential adverse effects of a 
single equipment class efficiency 
standard on competition in the CCW 
market. That is, DOE does not intend to 
set a standard that would produce 
significant adverse impacts on 
competition in this market. 
B. Technology Assessment 

For the technology assessment in the 

October 2008 NOPR analyses, DOE 
considered all RCW and CCW 
technology options that it is aware are 
or have been incorporated into working 
prototypes or commercially available 
clothes washers at the time of the 
analysis. ASAP stated that DOE should 
give more serious consideration to 
innovations currently in production on 
the RCW market. (ASAP, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 33–34) DOE 
did not receive information on specific 
technologies for RCWs that it did not 
consider. Further, DOE notes that it 
considered as design options many 
technologies that are found in both 

RCWs and CCWs. Of the technology 
options screened out, only suds 
saving 11 has appeared previously as a 
feature in commercially available RCWs. 
DOE research suggests that clothes 
washers incorporating a suds-saving 
feature have not been available on the 
market since 2005, and further DOE 
research suggests that suds saving 
would be impractical to install in a 
commercial setting for reasons such as 
space limitations, questionable energy 
savings, incompatibility with CCW 
usage patterns, and lack of consumer 
acceptance. Therefore, DOE concludes 
that suds-savings is an RCW feature that 
was appropriately screened out for the 
CCW SNOPR analysis. 

In addition, DOE has gathered and 

analyzed data published by CEC, CEE, 
and the ENERGY STAR Program to 
provide an overview of the energy 
efficiency levels achieved in today’s 
CCWs and RCWs. Certain information 
about technologies associated with high- 
efficiency clothes washers can be 
determined by evaluating the models in 
these databases. DOE found that all 
front-loading CCWs on the market today 
are more efficient than top-loading CCW 
models. No top-loading CCW listed in 
these databases has an MEF greater than 
1.76, whereas the majority of front- 
loading CCWs are listed as having MEFs 
greater than 2.0. Similarly, no top- 
loading CCW is rated as having a WF 
below 8.0, whereas the majority of front- 
loading CCWs have rated WFs below 
7.0. In contrast, DOE research suggests 
that the most efficient vertical-axis 
RCWs achieve efficiency levels 
comparable to some horizontal-axis 
CCWs on the market today.12 High 
efficiency, vertical-axis platforms that 
do not employ an agitator have been 
sold into the RCW market for several 

11 A suds-saving feature allows water from one 

wash cycle to be reused in the next wash cycle. 
After agitation, sudsy wash water is pumped into 
a separate storage tub, remaining there until the 
next wash cycle. While the water is stored, soil 
settles to the bottom of the tub. During the next 
wash cycle, all but an inch of the water is pumped 
back into the washer tub for use again. Clothes 
washers with the suds-saving feature must be larger 
than typical clothes washers in order to 
accommodate the additional storage tub. 

12 Typically, vertical-axis clothes washers are 

accessed from the top (also known as ‘‘top- 
loaders’’), while horizontal-axis clothes washers are 
accessed from the front (also known as ‘‘front- 
loaders’’). However, a limited number of residential 
horizontal-axis clothes washers which are 
accessible from the top (using a hatch in the wash 
basket) are currently available, although DOE is 
unaware of any such CCWs on the market. For the 
purposes of this analysis, the terms ‘‘vertical-axis’’ 
and ‘‘top-loading’’ will be used interchangeably, as 
will the terms ‘‘horizontal-axis’’ and ‘‘front- 
loading.’’ Additionally, clothes washers that have a 
wash basket whose axis of rotation is tilted from 
horizontal are considered to be horizontal-axis 
machines.

years, but have yet to be released in a 
CCW form. DOE expects manufacturers 
will continue to introduce new features 
first in the higher-volume residential 
markets before transitioning them to 
commercial applications. At this time, 
however, DOE is not aware of such 
technologies being incorporated in 
either commercially available CCWs or 
working CCW prototypes, and therefore 
did not consider them in the SNOPR 
analyses. 

Whirlpool stated that there are 

considerable differences between RCWs 
and CCWs, including, but not limited to 
heavier duty components and a smaller 
basket utilized in CCW’s. According to 
Whirlpool, the smaller basket is 
required by CCW customers, and it is 
inherently more difficult to achieve high 
efficiency with smaller baskets. 
(Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 3) 

For these reasons, DOE believes it has 

adequately considered RCW 
technologies that may be applicable to 
CCWs in its technology assessment. See 
chapter 3 of the SNOPR TSD for more 
information on the technologies 
considered. 

C. Engineering Analysis 

The purpose of the engineering 

analysis is to characterize the 
relationship between the incremental 
manufacturing cost and efficiency 
improvements of CCWs. DOE used this 
cost-efficiency relationship as input to 
the PBP, LCC, and NES analyses. 

To estimate incremental 

manufacturing costs, DOE has identified 
three basic methodologies: (1) The 
design-option approach, which provides 
the incremental costs of adding to a 
baseline model design options that will 
improve its efficiency; (2) the efficiency- 
level approach, which provides the 
incremental costs of moving to higher 
energy efficiency levels, without regard 
to the particular design option(s) used to 
achieve such increases; and (3) the cost- 
assessment (or reverse-engineering) 
approach, which provides ‘‘bottom-up’’ 
manufacturing cost assessments for 
achieving various levels of increased 
efficiency, based on detailed data on 
costs for parts and material, labor, 
shipping/packaging, and investment for 
models that operate at particular 
efficiency levels. DOE conducted the 

engineering analysis for this rulemaking 
using the efficiency-level approach. For 
this analysis, DOE relied upon 
efficiency data published in multiple 
databases, including those published by 
CEC, CEE and ENERGY STAR, which 
were supplemented with limited 
laboratory testing, data gained through 
reverse-engineering analysis, and 
primary and secondary research. 
1. Efficiency Levels 

The efficiency levels for CCWs are 
defined by two factors normalized by 
wash basket volume—MEF and WF. 
These two variables are only directly 
related to each other via the average hot 
water usage by a clothes washer, as 
measured by the DOE test procedure. 
Other measured parameters affect only 
one variable or the other. For example, 
cold water consumption only affects the 
WF, while remaining moisture content 
(RMC) only affects the MEF. (See 
chapter 5 of the SNOPR TSD for further 
explanation.) 

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

proposed the following efficiency levels 
for CCWs.

a. Revised Efficiency Levels 

In response to the October 2008 

NOPR, Alliance disputed DOE’s finding 
that the proposed max-tech level for 
top-loading CCWs is technically 
feasible, based on Alliance’s internal 
testing of one max-tech unit. Alliance 
stated that there were numerous 
inconsistencies related to the stated 
efficiencies of the max-tech top-loading 
CCW, the GE WNRD2050G, in databases 
such as those published by the CEC and 
ENERGY STAR. (Alliance, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 22– 
24 and 90–92) According to Alliance, its 
own tests for the same model did not 
achieve the published efficiency levels 
of 1.76 MEF/8.3 WF. Alliance suggested 
that DOE should test and confirm the 
max-tech model’s efficiency before 
continuing to use it as the basis for the 
max-tech efficiency levels proposed in 
the October 2008 NOPR. (Alliance, No. 
45 at Attachment 2, pp. 4–5) 

GE responded in its written comments 

that there was indeed a transposition 
error, which led to the inconsistencies 
noted by Alliance. GE stated that the 
equipment label indicated an energy 
rating of 472 kWh per year, equaling 
1.204 kWh per cycle, meaning that 
consumers were getting a more efficient 
product than the energy rating 
contained on the label. GE stated that it 
takes any labeling error very seriously, 
and corrected the issue immediately 
upon its discovery. (GE, No. 48 at pp. 
4–5). DOE review of present and past 
ENERGY STAR databases for CCWs 
failed to find an entry for the 
WNRD2050G. Based on market research 
and the CEC addition of the unit in 
December 2007, it appears that the 
WNRD2050G was released into 
production in December 2007. Thus, 
because the model’s stated WF (8.3) was 
above the cutoff for ENERGY STAR 
eligibility (8.0) at that time, DOE 
concludes that the WNRD2050G was 

never listed in the ENERGY STAR 
database for CCWs. 

In response to comments about the 
validity of published CCW data, the 
DOE rulemaking team purchased three 
nominally identical max-tech top- 
loading CCWs, and hired an 
independent test facility to determine 
their average efficiency rating per the 
DOE test procedure.13 The test results 
suggest that the max-tech CCW achieves 
a 1.63 MEF/8.4 WF efficiency rating 
instead of 1.76 MEF/8.3 WF as stated. 
Even at this lower max-tech level, the 
unit identified as the max-tech top- 
loading CCW model for the October 
2008 NOPR continues to be the max- 

13 A minimum of three washers are required to be 

tested per the DOE test procedure (10 CFR 430 
subpart B, appendix J1) to give test results some 
statistical certainty. If variability in the test results 
for the three washers is too high, an additional three 
units must be tested. For the DOE testing, no 
additional test units were required because the 
initial results had sufficiently low variability to be 
statistically valid.

tech top-loading CCW for the SNOPR 
analyses. However, as the tested values 
do not agree with the MEF and WF 
ratings in the CEC database on which 
the October 2008 NOPR analyses were 
based, and because this model was the 
only top-loading CCW stated to meet the 
(1.76 MEF/8.3 WF) max-tech level 
defined in the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
elected to eliminate that efficiency level 
from the top-loading CCW analysis in 
the SNOPR. 

Accordingly, DOE is proposing (1.60 

MEF/8.5 WF) for today’s max-tech level. 
Originally included based upon the 
CEE’s Tier 2 qualifying criteria for 
CCWs effective between January 1, 
2004, and January 1, 2007, 1.6 MEF/8.5 
WF is an efficiency level for which DOE 
had previously solicited feedback from 
interested parties and which is also very 
close to the tested results for the max- 
tech CCW. The max-tech model uses 
many standard top-loader components 
and materials; hence, DOE research 
suggests that no CCW manufacturer 

would suffer material harm since they 
all should be able to produce top- 
loading machines that meet the max- 
tech efficiency level without technical 
difficulty. 

ASAP stated that DOE should review 
current and upcoming ENERGY STAR 
efficiency levels for RCWs and 
subsequently revise efficiency levels 
under consideration for CCWs. ASAP 
noted that there are vertical-axis RCWs 
with agitators on the market that exceed 
the max-tech CCW level (i.e., that 
impeller-type clothes washers are not 
necessary to exceed the current max- 
tech CCW efficiency level as implied by 
some manufacturers). (ASAP, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 202– 
203) DOE is aware of the clothes 
washers referenced by ASAP and notes 
that they are only sold into the RCW 
market. Thus, it is not possible to assess 
whether these washers would be able to 
stand up to the rigors of operating in the 
CCW market. DOE research suggests that 
these washers are heavily patented, 

possibly preventing competitors such as 
the LVM from developing similar 
appliances. DOE research also suggests 
that some of the means by which these 
washers achieve their high efficiency 
levels (such as adaptive fill, a high 
number of wash programs, etc.) would 
yield few savings in a CCW setting, 
where washers are typically only 
washed with full loads and a limited 
number of wash programs are desired to 
limit consumer education needs. For 
these reasons, DOE did not consider 
these clothes washers in determining 
revised efficiency levels for the CCW 
analysis. 

Thus, for today’s SNOPR, DOE has 

proposed revised top-loading CCW 
efficiency levels shown in Table III.2, in 
which the max-tech top-loading level is 
now efficiency level 2 (1.60 MEF/8.5 
WF). No changes have been made to the 
efficiency levels proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR for front-loading 
CCWs in today’s supplemental notice.

DOE seeks comment on the revised 

efficiency levels for top-loading CCWs. 
This is identified as Issue 2 in section 
VII.E of today’s supplemental notice 
(Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment). 
b. Technological Feasibility of the 
Revised Top-Loading Max-Tech Level 

DOE also received numerous 

comments regarding the viability in 
commercial settings of the max-tech top- 
loading CCW evaluated in the October 
2008 NOPR. Alliance and GE 
commented that the commercial 
acceptance of the technology behind the 
max-tech vertical-axis CCW is as yet 
unknown because the GE model was 
introduced only recently and because 
the max-tech unit is currently only sold 
into the on-premise laundry market 
segment, where the frequency of user 
abuse such as overloading is lower than 
in other commercial segments 
(laundromats, multi-family housing, 
etc.). (Alliance, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 23; GE, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 173– 
174; GE, No. 48 at p.4;) Whirlpool 
suggested that the practice of 

overloading impairs top-loading CCWs 
more than front-loading machines, and, 
thus, inherently limits the efficiency 
levels that top-loading CCWs can 
achieve. Whirlpool also stated that 
CCWs are more prone to user abuse, 
such as extreme overloading, than 
RCWs. Whirlpool noted that certain 
residential platforms are not able to 
achieve proper clothes roll-over and, 
hence, cleaning when overfilled. 
(Whirlpool, No. 50 at pp. 2–3) The Joint 
Comment stated that on-premise 
laundry is served primarily by larger 
capacity equipment than is covered by 
this rulemaking. (Joint Comment, No. 44 
at pp. 4–5) Conversely, Alliance stated 
that the max-tech vertical-axis CCW is 
based on a lightweight RCW platform 
that is poorly suited to commercial 
usage. (Alliance, No. 45 at Attachment 
2, p. 7) 

DOE recognizes that the max-tech top- 
loading CCW is currently marketed only 
to on-premise laundry facilities and is 
not yet offered with a coin-box or smart 
card reader option for laundromat or 
multi-housing laundry use. DOE 
research indicates that the max-tech 

CCW is based on a standard vertical-axis 
RCW platform (i.e., one with an agitator) 
with selective upgrades, including spray 
rinse, four water-level settings, 
additional low-temperature wash 
programs, a low-standby power supply, 
and an electronic control board/user 
interface/drive system that is 
customized for its intended use. No 
proprietary technologies were observed, 
and, thus, DOE believes that all CCW 
manufacturers could market vertical- 
axis clothes washers with similar 
performance in time for the effective 
date of today’s proposed rule. The unit 
shares many characteristics with CCWs 
from the same manufacturer marketed 
towards laundromat and multi-unit 
housing applications, including an 
industry-standard 25-minute wash 
cycle. In its teardown analysis, DOE 
observed that the max-tech top-loading 
CCW appears to be built with similar 
construction and components as similar 
CCW models marketed to commercial 
laundromats, which are also largely 
based on an existing RCW platform. 
Thus, DOE believes that the max-tech 
CCW is equally rugged and durable as

other units on the market. Further, DOE 
believes that applicable payment-system 
interfaces could be incorporated in time 
for the effective date of today’s proposed 
standards. 

DOE research also suggests that 

commercial acceptance depends on 
wash performance. Multiple comments 
from interested parties were received 
concerning wash performance of high- 
efficiency clothes washers. The Multi- 
Housing Laundry Association (MLA) 
and Alliance commented that the top- 
loading CCW standard proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR could result in 
reduced equipment quality and clothes 
washing and rinsing performance. 
Alliance stated that the required 
reductions in water consumption and 
and/or low wash temperature to meet 
the standard proposed in the October 
2008 NOPR would negatively affect 
consumer utility. Alliance stated that 
the max-tech vertical-axis CCW, when 
used with common clothes washing 
detergents, may not provide adequate 
clothes washing performance. (Alliance, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 23–24 and p. 202; Alliance No. 45 
at p. 1 and Attachment 2, p. 14; MLA 
No. 49 at pp. 3–4) DOE recognizes that 
any amended energy efficiency standard 
could result in a lessening of certain 
equipment utility and hence interviews 
interested parties to better understand 
the potential impacts of energy 
efficiency strategies that manufacturers 
might employ in their equipment. 
Although interested parties have 
suggested that the max-tech model does 
not provide acceptable washing and 
rinsing performance targets, especially 
when overloaded, they have yet to 
submit evidence of such performance 
degradation. Furthermore, DOE is not 
aware of any widely accepted, 
quantitative measures associated with 
clothes washing performance. While 
DOE research uncovered a rinse- 
performance standard that was 
developed by Australian clothes washer 
manufacturers, this rinse test has yet to 
find acceptance in the U.S. market. 
DOE also received comments on 
whether the max-tech vertical-axis 
efficiency level could be achieved by 
multiple CCW models. Alliance stated 
that it would be unwise to set a standard 
close to the max-tech level, since it 
could eliminate all but the max-tech 
model from the market. (Alliance, No. 
45 at Attachment 2, p. 13) Alliance 
believes a properly functioning top- 
loading CCW market requires a range of 
models to serve all users. (Alliance, No. 
45 at Attachment 2, p. 13) DOE notes 
that the MEF/WF combination for 
vertical-axis CCWs proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR as TSL 2 and 

currently proposed in today’s SNOPR as 
the max-tech level is not based on either 
the stated or the tested max-tech 
vertical-axis unit. Rather, the 
combination of MEF and WF proposed 
is set at a level slightly below the 
measured max-tech values, and is a 
level for which DOE had previously 
collected manufacturing, capital 
expenditure, product development, and 
other costs. For today’s supplemental 
notice, DOE revised the max-tech level 
to the values at TSL 2 proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR—1.60 MEF/8.5 WF 
—based on its independent testing. 
Compared to the top-loading max-tech 
level and proposed standard of 1.76 
MEF/8.3 WF published in the October 
2008 NOPR, the revised level is slightly 
less stringent (see section III.C.1 for a 
complete discussion of this change) and 
may allow manufacturers to field units 
with higher tested efficiencies in the 
future. For example, the max-tech unit 
may be revised to achieve its stated 
efficiency level. DOE believes that this 
revision of the proposed max-tech level 
for today’s SNOPR should help alleviate 
some manufacturers’ concerns regarding 
the technological feasibility and 
commercial acceptance of a max-tech 
top-loading CCW. 

Alliance commented that front- 

loading CCWs with electric heaters have 
an MEF of 1.96, which would not meet 
the front-loading standards proposed in 
the October 2008 NOPR. According to 
Alliance, customers in some parts of the 
northern United States need such 
heaters to supplement their hot water 
supply in order to maintain proper wash 
temperatures despite very cold water 
supply temperatures. (Alliance, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 22) 
DOE has received no data on the extent 
or size of this impact or of the affected 
population. Hence, DOE invites 
comment, including population and 
efficiency impact data, to describe this 
issue. 

DOE also invites further comment and 

information on the technological 
feasibility of the proposed max-tech 
CCW, including washing and rinsing 
performance measures for CCWs and 
population data for water heating CCWs. 
This is identified as Issue 3 in section 
VII.E of today’s supplemental notice 
(Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment). 
2. Manufacturing Costs 

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

presented manufacturing cost estimates 
based on the November 2007 ANOPR 
analysis, revised in response to detailed 
CCW manufacturer feedback obtained at 
the NOPR stage for equipment at each 
efficiency level. 73 FR 62034, 62055– 
62056 (Oct. 17, 2008). These 

manufacturing costs were the basis of 
inputs for a number of other analyses in 
this rulemaking, including the LCC, 
national impact, and GRIM analyses. 

As described in the October 2008 

NOPR, DOE found that a low-volume 
manufacturer (LVM) operates in both 
the residential and CCW markets. DOE 
considers this manufacturer to be low- 
volume because its annual shipments in 
the combined RCW and CCW market are 
significantly lower than those of its 
larger competitors. However, unlike its 
larger rivals, most of the LVM’s unit 
shipments are in the CCW market, 
where the LVM has significant market 
share. Also unlike its diversified 
competitors, this company exclusively 
manufactures laundry equipment. A 
review of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) 10–K documents 
filed by the LVM revealed that, as of 
2005, this company derived 22 percent 
of its total revenue from the sale of 
front- and top-loading clothes washers 
and 87 percent of that income was from 
the commercial market.14 As a result, 
the LVM could be affected 
disproportionately by any rulemaking 
concerning CCWs compared to its 
competitors, for whom CCWs represent 
less than 2 percent of total clothes 
washer sales. Alliance stated that it is 
the LVM and that it has neither the 
purchasing power nor the funding to 
support wide-ranging research and 
development programs like those of its 
larger, more diverse rivals. (Alliance, 
No. 45 at Attachment 2, p. 8) As a result, 
the manufacturing costs for Alliance are 
inherently higher compared to those of 
its rivals. Alliance believes that the cost 
of compliance with the top-loading 
CCW standard proposed in the October 
2008 NOPR would be especially high if 
Alliance were required to introduce 
non-traditional agitator designs to meet 
it. (Alliance, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at p. 23 and p. 202) DOE 
research suggests that this efficiency 
level for vertical-axis clothes washers 
can be met with conventional, non- 
proprietary technology that is on the 
market today. Since the October 17, 
2008 NOPR meeting, DOE has received 
no further comments on the 
manufacturing cost curves. Thus, for 
today’s SNOPR, DOE has retained all 
cost estimates presented in the October 
2008 NOPR at the retained efficiency 
levels, though each value was scaled by 
the Producer Price Index (PPI) 
multiplier for the commercial laundry 
equipment industry (NAICS 333312) 

14 SEC documents pertaining to the LVM are 

available online at: http://sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse- 
idea?action=getcompany&CIK=0001063697&owner

Analysis 

In response to the requirements of 

section 325(o)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, DOE 
conducted LCC and PBP analyses to 
evaluate the economic impacts of 
possible amended energy conservation 
standards for owners of CCWs. This 
section of the notice describes these 
analyses. DOE conducted the analysis 
using a spreadsheet model developed in 
Microsoft (MS) Excel for Windows 2007. 
(See the SNOPR TSD, chapter 8). 
The LCC is the total consumer 

expense over the life of the equipment, 
including purchase and installation 
expense and operating costs (energy and 
water expenditures, repair costs, and 
maintenance costs). The PBP is the 
number of years it would take for the 
consumer to recover the increased costs 
of a higher-efficiency equipment 
through energy savings. To calculate the 
LCC, DOE discounted future operating 
costs to the time of purchase and 

summed them over the lifetime of the 
equipment. DOE measured the change 
in LCC and the change in PBP 
associated with a given efficiency level 
relative to a base case forecast of 
equipment efficiency. The base case 
forecast reflects the market in the 
absence of amended mandatory energy 
conservation standards. As part of the 
LCC and PBP analyses, DOE developed 
data that it used to establish equipment 
prices, installation costs, annual energy 
consumption, energy and water prices, 
maintenance and repair costs, 
equipment lifetime, and discount rates. 

DOE was unable to develop a 

consumer sample for CCWs because 
EIA’s Commercial Building Energy 
Consumption Survey (CBECS) does not 
provide the necessary data to develop 
one.16 Instead, DOE established the 
variability and uncertainty in energy 
and water use by defining the 
uncertainty and variability in the use 
(cycles per day) of the equipment. The 

variability in energy and water pricing 
was characterized by regional 
differences in energy and water prices. 
DOE calculated the LCC associated with 
a baseline CCW. To calculate the LCC 
savings and PBP associated with 
equipment meeting higher efficiency 
standards, DOE substituted the baseline 
unit with a more efficient design. 

Table III.4 summarizes the approaches 

and data DOE used to derive the inputs 
to the LCC and PBP calculations for the 
October 2008 NOPR, and the changes it 
made for today’s SNOPR. DOE did not 
introduce changes to the LCC and PBP 
analyses methodology described in the 
October 2008 NOPR. However, as the 
following sections discuss in more 
detail, DOE revised some of the inputs 
to the analysis. Chapter 8 of the TSD 
accompanying this notice contains 
detailed discussion of the methodology 
utilized for the LCC and PBP analyses 
as well as the inputs developed for the 
analyses.

1. Equipment Prices 

2. Installation Cost 

To calculate the equipment prices 

faced by CCW purchasers, DOE 
multiplied the manufacturing costs 
developed from the engineering analysis 
by the supply chain markups it 
developed (along with sales taxes). DOE 
used the same supply chain markups for 
today’s SNOPR that were developed for 
the October 2008 NOPR. See chapter 7 
of the TSD accompanying this notice for 
additional information. To calculate the 
final installed prices, DOE added 
installation cost to the equipment 
prices. 

17 Please see the following Web site for further 

information: http://www.mla-online.com/. 

18 Please see the following Web site for further 

information: http://www.coinlaundry.org/. 

Installation costs include labor, 
overhead, and any miscellaneous 
materials and parts. For the October 
2008 NOPR and today’s SNOPR, DOE 
used data from the RS Means 
Mechanical Cost Data, 2008 on labor 
requirements to estimate installation 
costs for CCWs.20 DOE estimates that 
installation costs do not increase with 
equipment efficiency. 
3. Annual Energy Consumption 

DOE determined the annual energy 

and water consumption of CCWs by 
multiplying the per-cycle energy and 
water use by the estimated number of 
cycles per year. In the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE concluded that the use of 
the existing RCW test procedure 

provides a representative basis for rating 
and estimating the per-cycle energy use 
of CCWs. For today’s SNOPR, DOE 
maintained the above approach. 
4. Energy and Water Prices 
a. Energy Prices 

DOE derived average electricity and 

natural gas prices for 13 geographic 
areas consisting of the nine U.S. Census 
divisions, with four large States (New 
York, Florida, Texas, and California) 
treated separately. 

DOE estimated commercial electricity 

prices for each of the 13 geographic 
areas based on data from EIA Form 861, 
Annual Electric Power Industry 
Report.21 DOE calculated an average 
commercial electricity price by first 
estimating an average commercial price

for each utility, and then calculated a 
regional average price by weighting each 
utility with customers in a region by the 
number of commercial customers served 
in that region. The calculations for 
today’s SNOPR used the most recent 
available data from 2007. 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

estimated average commercial natural 
gas prices in each of the 13 geographic 
areas based on 2006 data from the EIA 
publication Natural Gas Monthly.22 
DOE calculated an average natural gas 
price for each area by first calculating 
the average prices for each State, and 
then calculating a regional price by 
weighting each State in a region by its 
population. For today’s SNOPR, DOE 
used 2007 data from the same source. 
To estimate the trends in electricity 
and natural gas prices for the October 
2008 NOPR, DOE used the price 
forecasts in the AEO 2008.23 To arrive 
at prices in future years, DOE multiplied 
the average prices described above by 
the forecast of annual average price 
changes in AEO 2008. For today’s 
supplemental notice, DOE updated its 
energy price forecasts using those in the 
AEO 2009 April Release. Because the 
AEO forecasts prices only to 2030, DOE 
followed past guidelines provided to the 
Federal Energy Management Program by 
EIA and used the average rate of change 
during 2020–2030 to estimate the price 
trends beyond 2030. 

The spreadsheet tools used to conduct 
the LCC and PBP analysis allow users to 
select either the AEO’s high-growth case 
or low-growth case price forecasts to 
estimate the sensitivity of the LCC and 
PBP to different energy price forecasts. 
The AEO 2009 April Release provides 
only forecasts for the Reference Case. 
Therefore, for today’s supplemental 
notice, DOE used the AEO 2009 March 
Release high-growth case or low-growth 
forecasts to estimate high-growth and 
low-growth price trends. 

DOE received comment regarding the 

inputs into the energy price forecasts. 
The Joint Comment recommended that 
DOE conduct a sensitivity analysis 
using a basket of other forecasts besides 
the AEO. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 
11) As mentioned above, DOE 
considered the AEO’s high-growth case 
and low-growth case price forecasts to 
estimate the sensitivity of the LCC and 
PBP results to different energy price 
forecasts. The AEO alternative forecasts 
provide a suitable range to examine the 
sensitivity of LCC and PBP results to 
different energy price forecasts. 

22 Available online at: http://www.eia.doe.gov/ 

oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/ 
natural_gas_monthly/ngm.html. 

23 All AEO publications are available online at: 

http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/. 

Interested parties also recommended 
DOE consider pending legislation that 
could influence future energy prices. 
The Joint Comment stated that to 
realistically depict energy prices in the 
future, DOE must consider the impact of 
carbon control legislation, since such 
legislation is very likely. It also noted 
that there are regional cap and trade 
programs that are in effect in the 
Northeast (Regional Greenhouse Gas 
Initiative (RGG)) and the West (Western 
Climate Initiative (WCI)) that will 
impact the price of electricity and are 
not reflected in the AEO energy price 
forecasts. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 
12) EJ stated that caps will likely be in 
place by the time new standards become 
effective, so DOE should increase its 
electricity prices to reflect the cost of 
complying with emission caps. (EJ, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 105–106) The shape of Federal 
carbon control legislation, and the 
ensuing cost of carbon mitigation to 
electricity generators, is as yet too 
uncertain to incorporate into the energy 
price forecasts that DOE uses. The costs 
of carbon mitigation to electricity 
generators resulting from the regional 
programs are also very uncertain over 
the forecast period for this rulemaking. 
Even so, EIA did include the effect of 
the RGGI in its AEO 2009 April Release 
energy price forecasts. (WCI did not 
provide sufficient detail to EIA in order 
for them to model the impact of the WCI 
on energy price forecasts.) Therefore, 
the energy price forecasts used in 
today’s supplemental notice do include 
the impact of one of the two regional 
cap and trade programs in the United 
States. 
b. Water and Wastewater Prices 

DOE obtained commercial water and 

wastewater price data from the Water 
and Wastewater Rate Survey conducted 
by Raftelis Financial Consultants (RFC) 
and the American Water Works 
Association (AWWA). For the October 
2008 NOPR and today’s SNOPR, DOE 
used the 2006 Water and Wastewater 
Rate Survey.24 The survey covers 
approximately 300 water utilities and 
200 wastewater utilities, with each 
industry analyzed separately. DOE 
calculated values at the Census region 
level (Northeast, South, Midwest, and 
West). Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 
questioned why water and wastewater 
prices were not developed at the Census 
division level. (EEI, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5, p. 103 and p. 178) 

24 Raftelis Financial Consultants, Inc., 2006 RFC/ 
AWWA Water and Wastewater Rate Survey, 2006, 
(2006). This document is available at: http:// 
www.raftelis.com/ratessurvey.html. 

The samples that DOE obtained of 200– 
300 utilities are not large enough to 
calculate regional prices for all U.S. 
Census divisions and large States. 
Hence, DOE was only able to capture 
the variability of water and wastewater 
prices at the Census region level. 

To estimate the future trend for water 

and wastewater prices, DOE used data 
on the historic trend in the national 
water price index (U.S. city average) 
provided by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS). For the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE extrapolated a future trend 
based on the linear growth from 1970 to 
2007. The Joint Comment stated that (1) 
the trend line for water and wastewater 
prices developed by DOE begins with an 
anomalous dip of over seven percent in 
costs for 2008, rather than the likely 
increase of 2 percent or more; and (2) 
DOE’s trend forecast understates the 
future cost of water and wastewater 
service by some ten percent. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at pp. 3–4) For today’s 
SNOPR, DOE modified its future trends 
of water and wastewater prices based on 
some of the Joint Comment’s 
suggestions. DOE continued to the use 
the BLS historical data, which now 
provides data for the year 2008, and 
extrapolated the future trend based on 
the linear growth from 1970 to 2008. But 
rather than use the extrapolated trend to 
forecast the prices for the four years 
after 2008, DOE pinned the annual price 
to the value in 2008. Otherwise, 
forecasted prices for this 4-year time 
period would have been up to 8 percent 
lower than the price in 2008. Estimating 
prices in this manner is appropriate 
because it is consistent with the 
historical trend that demonstrates that 
prices do not decrease over time. 
Estimating prices in this manner also 
prevents the anomalous dip noted by 
the Joint Comment. Beyond the 4-year 
time period, DOE used the extrapolated 
trend to forecast prices out to the year 
2043. 
5. Repair and Maintenance Costs 
Repair costs are associated with 

repairing or replacing components that 
have failed in the appliance, whereas 
maintenance costs are associated with 
maintaining the operation of the 
equipment. For the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE included increased repair costs 
based on an algorithm developed by 
DOE for central air conditioners and 
heat pumps and which was also used 
for residential furnaces and boilers.25

57754 

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

This algorithm calculates annualized 
repair costs by dividing half of the 
equipment retail price over the 
equipment lifetime. Whirlpool agreed 
with the assumptions DOE used to 
estimate CCW repair costs in the 
October 2008 NOPR. (Whirlpool, No. 50 
at p. 3) MLA stated that more efficient 
CCWs incur higher maintenance costs. 
(MLA, No. 49 at p. 4) ASAP asked 
whether DOE had gathered empirical 
data to estimate CCW repair and 
maintenance costs. (ASAP, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 110– 
111) DOE was unable to gather any 
empirical data specific to CCWs to 
estimate repair and maintenance cost. In 
the absence of better data, DOE retained 
its approach from the October 2008 
NOPR for today’s SNOPR. 
6. Equipment Lifetime 

For the October 2008 NOPR and 

today’s SNOPR, DOE used a variety of 
sources to establish low, average, and 
high estimates for equipment lifetime. 
The average CCW lifetime was 11.3 
years for multi-family applications, and 
7.1 years in laundromat applications. 
DOE characterized CCW lifetimes with 
Weibull probability distributions. 
7. Discount Rates 

To establish discount rates for CCWs 
for the October 2008 NOPR and today’s 
SNOPR, DOE estimated the cost of 
capital of publicly traded firms in the 
sectors that purchase CCWs as the 
weighted average of the cost of equity 
financing and the cost of debt financing. 
DOE identified the following sectors 
purchasing CCWs: (1) Educational 
services; (2) hotels; (3) real estate 
investment trusts; and (4) personal 
services. DOE estimated the weighted- 
average cost of capital (WACC) using the 

respective shares of equity and debt 
financing for each sector that purchases 
CCWs. It calculated the real WACC by 
adjusting the cost of capital by the 
expected rate of inflation. To obtain an 
average discount rate value, DOE used 
additional data on the number of CCWs 
in use in various sectors. DOE estimated 
the average discount rate for companies 
that purchase CCWs at 5.7 percent. DOE 
received comment on the discount rates 
from Alliance, who suggested that the 
discount rates used in LCC and PBP 
analyses should be updated to reflect 
current financial market conditions. 
(Alliance, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at pp. 115–116) DOE used the 
most recent available data (from 2006) 
from Damodaran Online and Ibbotson 
Associates to estimate its discount rates 
for CCWs. Damodaran Online is a 
widely used source of information about 
company debt and equity financing for 
most types of firms. Ibbotson Associates 
is a leading authority on asset allocation 
with expertise in capital market 
expectations and portfolio 
implementation. DOE believes that the 
data it used are representative of 
conditions that may apply when the 
first purchases impacted by standards 
would be made. Therefore, DOE 
continued to use these sources for 
today’s SNOPR and will determine if 
the data used from both sources needs 
to be updated for the final rule. 
8. Effective Date of the Amended 
Standards 

The compliance date is the future date 
when parties subject to the requirements 
of a new standard must begin 
compliance. For the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE assumed that any new 
energy efficiency standards adopted in 
this rulemaking would require 

compliance in March 2012, 3 years after 
the final rule was expected to be 
published in the Federal Register. For 
today’s SNOPR, DOE expects that the 
final rule will be published by January 
1, 2010, as required by EPACT 2005, 
with compliance with new standards 
required by January 1, 2013. DOE 
calculated the LCC for the appliance 
consumers as if they would purchase 
new equipment in the year after the 
standard takes effect. 
9. Equipment Energy Efficiency in the 
Base Case 

For the LCC and PBP analysis, DOE 

analyzes higher efficiency levels relative 
to a baseline efficiency level. However, 
some consumers may already purchase 
equipment with efficiencies greater than 
the baseline equipment levels. Thus, to 
accurately estimate the percentage of 
consumers that would be affected by a 
particular standard level, DOE estimates 
the distribution of equipment 
efficiencies that consumers are expected 
to purchase under the base case (i.e., the 
case without new energy efficiency 
standards). DOE refers to this 
distribution of equipment energy 
efficiencies as a base-case efficiency 
distribution. As discussed previously in 
section III.A, DOE decided to analyze 
CCWs with two equipment classes—top- 
loading CCWs and front-loading CCWs. 
For the October 2008 NOPR and today’s 
SNOPR, DOE used the number of 
available models within each equipment 
class to establish the base-case 
efficiency distributions. Table III.5 
presents the market shares of the 
efficiency levels in the base case for 
CCWs. See chapter 8 of the TSD 
accompanying this notice for further 
details on the development of CCW 
base-case market shares.

10. CCW Split Incentive 

Under a split incentive situation, the 

party purchasing more efficient and 
presumably more expensive equipment 

(referred to as ‘‘consumers’’ in this 
notice) may not realize the operating 
cost savings from that equipment, 
because another party may pay the 
utility bill. For the October 2008 NOPR, 

DOE evaluated the ability of CCW 
owners to pass on the higher purchase 
costs of more expensive CCWs in return 
for lower operational costs. DOE 
concluded that few route operators

would allow themselves to be held to a 
lease agreement which would prevent 
them from recovering the cost of more 
efficient CCW equipment. The Joint 
Comment stated that contracts between 
route operators are multi-housing 
property owners are subject to revision 
and renewal, and that the division of 
coin-box revenue may be negotiated as 
a result of cost-effective efficiency 
improvements in CCWs. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 6) Because DOE 
received only supportive comments 
regarding its assessment of the potential 
of a split incentive in the CCW market, 
DOE continues to conclude for today’s 
SNOPR that new CCW efficiency 
standards are unlikely to lead to split 
incentives in the CCW market. 
11. Rebound Effect 

The rebound effect occurs when a 

piece of equipment, made more efficient 
and used more intensively, does not 
yield the expected energy savings from 
the efficiency improvement. In the case 
of more efficient clothes washers, 
limited research has been conducted to 
show that there is no rebound effect for 
home appliances, although the 
consumer may choose to purchase larger 
models with more features that would 
result in higher energy use.26 DOE did 
not receive any comments from 
interested parties on the issue of the 
rebound effect for CCWs. Based on the 
limited research showing no rebound 
effect for home appliances, DOE did not 
include a rebound effect in its analysis 
of CCW standards. 
12. Inputs to Payback Period Analysis 

The PBP is the amount of time 

(expressed in years) it takes the 
consumer to recover the additional 
installed cost of more efficient 
equipment through operating cost 
savings, compared to baseline 
equipment. The simple PBP does not 
account for changes in operating 
expense over time or the time value of 
money. The inputs to the PBP 
calculation are the total installed cost of 
the equipment to the customer for each 
efficiency level and the annual (first- 
year) operating expenditures for each 
efficiency level. For the October 2008 
NOPR and today’s SNOPR, the PBP 
calculation uses the same inputs as the 
LCC analysis, except that energy price 
trends and discount rates are not 
needed.

13. Rebuttable-Presumption Payback 
Period 

As noted above, EPCA, as amended 

(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii) and 
6316(a)), establishes a rebuttable 
presumption that a standard is 
economically justified if the Secretary 
finds that ‘‘the additional cost to the 
consumer of purchasing a product 
complying with an energy conservation 
standard level will be less than three 
times the value of the energy (and as 
applicable, water) savings during the 
first year that the consumer will receive 
as a result of the standard,’’ as 
calculated under the test procedure in 
place for that standard. For each TSL, 
DOE determined the value of the first 
year’s energy savings by calculating the 
quantity of those savings in accordance 
with DOE’s test procedure, and 
multiplying that amount by the average 
energy price forecast for the year in 
which a new standard would be first 
effective—in this case, 2013. 

DOE received comments addressing 

the topic of using a rebuttable 
presumption payback period to 
establish the economic justification of 
an energy conservation standard level. 
The Joint Comment and EJ stated that 
DOE’s view that consideration of a full 
range of impacts is necessary because 
the rebuttable presumption payback 
period criterion is not sufficient for 
determining economic justification does 
not reflect the extent to which the 
rebuttable presumption analysis 
constrains DOE’s authority to reject 
standards based on economic impacts. 
(Joint Comment, No. 44 at appendix B, 
p. 1; EJ, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at p. 130) The Joint Comment 
stated that in 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii), Congress erected a 
significant barrier to DOE’s rejection, on 
the basis of economic justifiability, of 
standard levels to which the rebuttable 
presumption applies. Further, EJ and 
the Joint Comment stated DOE 
preference to proceed under the seven- 
factor test contained in 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i) is not pertinent. 

The Joint Comment agreed with DOE 
that analysis under the seven-factor test 
is necessary and has typically supported 
standards with paybacks longer than 3 
years. However, the Joint Comment 
stated that DOE’s decision-making must 
reflect the expressed intent of Congress 
that the highest standard level resulting 
in cost recovery within 3 years 
constitutes the presumptive lowest 
standard level that DOE must adopt. 
(Joint Comment, No. 44 at appendix B, 
pp. 1–2) 

DOE does consider both the rebuttable 
presumption payback criteria, as well as 

a full analysis including all seven 
relevant statutory criteria under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i) when examining 
potential standard levels. However, DOE 
believes that the interested parties are 
misinterpreting the statutory provision 
in question. The Joint Comment and EJ 
present one possible reading of an 
ambiguous provision (i.e., that DOE 
need not look beyond the results of the 
rebuttable presumption inquiry), but 
DOE believes that such an approach is 
neither required nor appropriate, 
because it would ask the agency to 
potentially ignore other relevant 
information that would bear on the 
selection of the most stringent standard 
level that meets all applicable statutory 
criteria. The interested parties’ 
interpretation would essentially restrict 
DOE from being able to rebut the 
findings of the preliminary presumptive 
analysis. 

The statute contains no such 

restriction, and such an approach would 
hinder DOE’s efforts to base its 
regulations on the best available 
information. Similarly, DOE believes 
that the Joint Comment misreads the 
statute in calling for a level that meets 
the rebuttable presumption test to serve 
as a minimum level when setting the 
final energy conservation standard. To 
do so would not only eliminate the 
‘‘rebuttable’’ aspect of the presumption 
but would also lock in place a level that 
may not be economically justified based 
upon the full review of statutory 
criteria. DOE is already obligated under 
EPCA to select the most stringent 
standard level that meets the applicable 
statutory criteria, so there is no need to 
tie the same requirement to the 
rebuttable presumption. 
E. National Impact Analysis—National 
Energy Savings and Net Present Value 
Analysis 
1. General 

DOE’s NIA assesses the national 

energy savings, as well as the national 
NPV of total consumer costs and 
savings, expected to result from new 
standards at specific efficiency levels. 
DOE applied the NIA spreadsheet to 
perform calculations of energy savings 
and NPV, using the annual energy 
consumption and total installed cost 
data from the LCC analysis. DOE 
forecasted the energy savings, energy 
cost savings, equipment costs, and NPV 
for each equipment class from 2013 to 
2043. The forecasts provide annual and 
cumulative values for all four 
parameters. In addition, DOE 
incorporated into its NIA spreadsheet 
the capability to analyze sensitivity of 
the results to forecasted energy prices

2. Shipments 

The shipments portion of the NIA 

Spreadsheet is a Shipments Model that 
uses historical data as a basis for 
projecting future shipments of the 
equipment that are the subject of this 
rulemaking. In projecting CCW 
shipments, DOE accounted for three 
market segments: (1) New construction; 
(2) existing buildings (i.e., replacing 
failed equipment); and (3) retired units 
not replaced. DOE used the non- 
replacement market segment to calibrate 
the Shipments Model to historical 
shipments data. For purposes of 
estimating the impacts of prospective 
standards on equipment shipments (i.e., 
forecasting standards-case shipments) 
DOE considered the combined effects of 
changes in purchase price, annual 
operating cost, and household income 
on the magnitude of shipments. 

Table III.7 summarizes the approach 
and data DOE used to derive the inputs 
to the shipments analysis for the 
October 2008 NOPR, and the changes it 
made for today’s SNOPR. The general 
approach for forecasting CCW 
shipments for today’s SNOPR remains 
unchanged from the October 2008 
NOPR. That is, all CCW shipments (for 
both equipment classes) were estimated 
for the new construction, replacement 
and non-replacement markets. DOE then 
allocated shipments to each of the two 
equipment classes based on the market 
share of each class. Based on data 
provided by AHAM for the November 
2007 ANOPR, DOE estimated that top- 
loading washers comprise 80 percent of 
the market while front-loading washers 
comprise 20 percent. DOE estimated 
that the equipment class market shares 
would remain unchanged over the time 
period 2005–2042. A discussion of the 
inputs and the changes follows below. 

The Joint Comment suggested that 

DOE update its equipment class market 
shares to reflect the impacts of the 2006 
Federal tax incentives for CCWs. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 5) The Joint 
Comment noted that the increased 
production of front-loading washers in 
the base-case would in turn lead to 
lower conversion costs for 
manufacturers and, therefore, make it 
less costly to meet higher CCW 
efficiency standards. For today’s 
supplemental notice, DOE reviewed the 
SEC 10K report of the LVM of CCWs 
and determined that manufacturer tax 
credits in recent Federal legislation have 
resulted in significantly increased sales 
of the front-loading washers for the 
LVM. When accounting for the LVM’s 
market share, the increase in front- 
loading sales results in a current market 
share of 30 percent for front-loading 
washers. Although tax credits are set to 
expire after 2010, DOE believes that the

costs and manufacturing infrastructure 
such that front-loading washers would 

continue to comprise 30 percent of the 
market over the entire forecast period.

chosen for the Shipments Analysis in 
today’s supplemental notice.

Used  purchase  price  and  efficiency  data  specific  to

washers  between  1980  and  2002  to  determine  a 
‘‘relative price’’ elasticity of demand, of ¥0.34.

Fuel Switching ...................... Not applicable ................................................................. No change. 

DOE based its Shipments Model on 

the following three assumptions: (1) All 
equipment shipments for new 
construction are driven by the new 
multi-family housing market, (2) the 
relative market shares of the two 
equipment applications, laundromats 
and common-area laundry facilities in 
multi-family housing, are constant over 
time at 15 and 85 percent, respectively, 
and (3) the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
quantity index data can be used to 
validate the shipments trend observed 
in the historical data. The Joint 
Comment stated that DOE’s assumed 85 
percent to 15 percent split between sales 
for multi-family applications and sales 
for laundromat applications is not based 
on robust or current data. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 5) It cited 
information from Alliance Laundry that 
suggests that the ratio of multi-family to 
laundromat shipments is about 36 
percent to 64 percent. DOE based its 
market information on a report from the 

CEE,27 which gathered information from 
several sources. Therefore, DOE 
concluded that this source is more 
reliable than information from a single 
manufacturer, and it continued to apply 
the same multi-family/laundromat sales 
split used in the October 2008 NOPR for 
today’s SNOPR. 

DOE received comments regarding the 

impacts of impending amended energy 
conservation standards for CCWs on 
unit sales. Alliance suggested that 
impacts to the CCW market would 
encourage customers to stock up on less 
efficient top-loading CCWs before the 
implementation date, and keep older 
machines in operation longer. These 
effects would undermine the 
effectiveness of the standards proposed 
in the October 2008 NOPR. (Alliance, 
No. 45 at Attachment 2, p. 10) As 

27 Consortium for Energy Efficiency, Commercial 
Family-Sized Washers: An Initiative Description of 
the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (1998). This 
document is available at: http://www.cee1.org/com/ 
cwsh/cwsh-main.php3. 

discussed below in section III.E.2.c, 
DOE’s shipments model uses a 
‘‘relative’’ purchase price elasticity to 
determine the drop in shipments as a 
function of increased purchase price 
and operating cost savings. The model 
does forecast a drop in new shipments 
due to a high standard on top-loading 
CCWs, which is expected to result in 
purchase of used CCWs. DOE did not 
have sufficient information to account 
for possible stocking up on less efficient 
top-loading CCWs before the 
implementation date. 
a. New Construction Shipments 

To determine new construction 

shipments, DOE used a forecast of new 
housing coupled with equipment 
market saturation data for new housing. 
For new housing completions and 
mobile home placements, DOE adopted 
the projections from EIA’s AEO 2008 
through 2030 for the October 2008 
NOPR. For today’s SNOPR, DOE used 
the projections from EIA’s AEO 2009

April Release Reference Case. For 
CCWs, DOE relied on new construction 
market saturation data from the above- 
mentioned CEE report. 
b. Replacements and Non-Replacements 

DOE estimated replacements using 

equipment retirement functions 
developed from equipment lifetimes. 
For the October 2008 NOPR and today’s 
SNOPR, DOE used retirement functions 
based on Weibull distributions. For the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE determined 
that the growth of in-unit washer 
saturations in the multi-family stock 
over the last 10 years was likely caused 
by conversions of rental property to 
condominiums, resulting in the gradual 
phase-out or non-replacement of failed 
CCWs in common-area laundry 
facilities. As a result, DOE used the 
average percent of non-replacements 
over the period between 1999 and 2005 
(18 percent) and maintained it over the 
entire forecast period (2006 to 2042 for 
the October 2008 NOPR and 2007 to 
2043 for today’s SNOPR). The effect of 
maintaining non-replacements at 18 
percent results in forecasted CCW 
shipments staying relatively flat during 
the forecast period. 

Multiple interested parties 

commented on the shipment forecasts 
used by DOE in the October 2008 NOPR. 
Alliance agreed with the relatively flat 
shipment forecast. (Alliance, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 22; 
Alliance, No. 45 at p. 1) AHAM and 
Whirlpool stated that the October 2008 
NOPR estimates of future shipments for 
CCWs were much more realistic than 
those used in the November 2007 
ANOPR. (AHAM, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 27; AHAM, 
No. 47 at p. 4; Whirlpool, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No 40.5 at p. 28; 
Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 3) The Joint 
Comment questioned DOE’s forecast of 
reduced shipments for new and 
replacement CCWs, citing Alliance’s 
SEC filing which projected ‘‘modest 
growth’’ in the installed base of 
commercial laundry equipment, 
estimated by Alliance to have grown at 
0.9 percent annually since 1997. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 5) DOE believes 
that the information it used to forecast 
CCW shipments for the October 2008 
NOPR is more reliable than the limited 
information provided by the Joint 
Comment on one manufacturer’s 
statement in a single SEC filing; thus 
DOE maintained the approach used in 
the October 2008 NOPR for today’s 
SNOPR.

c. Purchase Price, Operating Cost, and 
Income Impacts 

To estimate the combined effects on 

CCW shipments from increases in 
equipment purchase price and decreases 
in equipment operating costs due to 
amended efficiency standards, DOE 
conducted a literature review and a 
statistical analysis on a limited set of 
appliance price, efficiency, and 
shipments data for the October 2008 
NOPR. DOE used purchase price and 
efficiency data specific to residential 
refrigerators, clothes washers, and 
dishwashers between 1980 and 2002 to 
conduct regression analyses. DOE’s 
analysis suggests that the ‘‘relative’’ 
short-run price elasticity of demand, 
averaged over the three appliances, is 
¥0.34. Because DOE’s forecast of 
shipments and national impacts due to 
standards spans over 30 years, DOE also 
considered how the relative price 
elasticity is affected once a new 
standard takes effect. Past analyses of 
consumer purchase decisions for 
automobiles suggest that after the initial 
purchase price change, price elasticity 
becomes more inelastic over the years 
until it reaches a terminal value. See 
appendix 10A of the SNOPR TSD for 
more details on the development of the 
short-run price elasticity of demand and 
the long-run effects on the elasticity. 
For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

incorporated a relative price elasticity 
change that resulted in a terminal value 
of approximately one-third of the short- 
run elasticity. In other words, DOE 
estimated that consumer purchase 
decisions, in time, become less sensitive 
to the initial change in the equipment’s 
relative price. MLA commented that if 
the standards result in a substantial 
increase in the use of front-loading 
CCWs and a reduction or elimination in 
that of top-loading CCWs, consumers 
would see resulting price increases 
driven by higher purchase price and 
higher maintenance, service, and 
operating cost for front-loading CCWs 
compared to top-loaders. (MLA, No. 49 
at pp. 3–4) In addition, ASAP 
questioned DOE’s conclusion that 
standards more aggressive than the ones 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR for 
front-loading CCWs could lead to 
significant recapture of the CCW market 
by top-loading machines. (ASAP, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 34– 
35 and pp. 160–161) For its October 
2008 NOPR as well as today’s SNOPR, 
DOE estimated that price increases 
would lead to reductions in unit 
shipments for both top-loading and 
front-loading CCWs. DOE analyzed the 
impacts of increased purchase prices for 
each equipment class independently of 

the other. DOE was not able to estimate 
the cross price elasticity of demand 
between the two equipment classes to 
determine whether consumers would 
switch from one type of CCW to the 
other. But because the price impacts for 
more efficient top-loaders are higher 
than those for more efficient front- 
loaders, DOE estimated that top-loading 
CCW sales would decrease more rapidly 
than for front-loaders. As a result, DOE 
estimated that front-loading CCWs 
would gain an additional market share 
of only about 2 percent. In addition, 
DOE estimated that those consumers 
forgoing the purchase of new top- 
loading CCWs would instead purchase 
used top-loading CCWs with efficiencies 
equal to baseline top-loader levels. DOE 
received no additional comments on its 
analysis to estimate the combined 
effects of increases in equipment 
purchase price and decreases in 
operating costs on CCW shipments and, 
therefore, retained the approach for 
today’s SNOPR. 

Although DOE retained its approach 

from the October 2008 NOPR to estimate 
the impacts from changes in purchase 
price and operating cost, DOE has 
concerns over specific aspects of its 
analysis. First, because purchase price 
and efficiency data for residential 
appliances were used to develop the 
‘‘relative’’ short-run price elasticity of 
demand, DOE is uncertain how 
applicable the price elasticity is to the 
commercial clothes washing market. 
Second, because estimates of the long- 
run price elasticity of demand were 
derived from consumer automobile 
purchase decisions, DOE is uncertain 
whether it can be inferred that the 
initial CCW price elasticity of demand 
would become more inelastic over time. 
Third, although a cross price elasticity 
of demand between top-loading and 
front-loading CCWs could not be 
developed due to the lack of specific 
data, DOE still has concern over the 
price interactions between the two types 
of CCWs, especially under those 
circumstances where the purchase price 
increase for one CCW equipment class 
is more significant than for the other. 
Finally, DOE is concerned over its 
assumption that consumers forgoing a 
top-loader CCW purchase due to a price 
increase caused by standards would 
instead acquire used top-loading 
washers. For example, those consumers 
forgoing a top-loading CCW purchase 
may instead purchase a new front- 
loading CCW. To understand the 
interactions between the used CCW 
market and the new front-loading CCW 
market, the development of a cross price

elasticity between these two markets 
would be ideal. 

Due to the lack of data and 

information to develop both short- and 
long-run price elasticities of demand 
specific to CCWs as well as cross price 
elasticities between top-loading and 
front-loading CCWs and used and front- 
loading CCWs, DOE is seeking input 
and any data from interested parties that 
may assist in the development of price 
elasiticies specific to any or all of the 
items discussed above. This is identified 
as Issue 4 in section VII.E of today’s 
supplemental notice (Issues on Which 
DOE Seeks Comment). 
3. Other Inputs 
a. Base-Case Forecasted Efficiencies 

A key input to the calculations of NES 
and NPV are the energy efficiencies that 
DOE forecasts for the base case (without 
new standards). The forecasted 
efficiencies represent the annual 
shipment-weighted energy efficiency 
(SWEF) of the equipment under 
consideration over the forecast period 
(i.e., from the estimated effective date of 
a new standard to 30 years after that 
date). 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE first 

determined the distribution of 
equipment efficiencies currently in the 
marketplace to develop a SWEF for each 
equipment class for 2005. Using the 
SWEF as a starting point, DOE 
developed base-case efficiencies based 
on estimates of future efficiency 
increase. From 2005 to 2013 (2013 being 
the estimated effective date of a new 
standard), DOE estimated that there 
would be no change in the SWEF (i.e., 
no change in the distribution of 
equipment efficiencies). Because there 
are no historical data to indicate how 
equipment efficiencies have changed 
over time, DOE estimated that 
forecasted efficiencies would remain at 
the 2013 level until the end of the 
forecast period. DOE recognizes the 
possibility that equipment efficiencies 
may change over time (e.g., due to 
voluntary efficiency programs such as 
ENERGY STAR). But without historical 
information, DOE had no basis for 
estimating how much the equipment 
efficiencies may change. For today’s 
supplemental notice, DOE maintained 
its estimate that the SWEF would 
remain constant from 2005 through the 
end of the forecast period. 
b. Standards-Case Forecasted 
Efficiencies 

For its determination of each of the 
cases with alternative standard levels 
(‘‘standards cases’’), DOE used a ‘‘roll- 
up’’ scenario in the October 2008 NOPR

to establish the SWEF for 2013. In a roll- 
up scenario, equipment efficiencies in 
the base case which do not meet the 
standard level under consideration are 
projected to roll-up to meet the new 
standard level. Further, all equipment 
efficiencies in the base case that are 
above the standard level under 
consideration are not affected by the 
standard. The same scenario is used for 
the forecasted standards-case 
efficiencies as for the base-case 
efficiencies, namely, that forecasted 
efficiencies remained at the 2013 
efficiency level until the end of the 
forecast period, as DOE has no data to 
reasonably estimate how such efficiency 
levels might change over the next 30 
years. By maintaining the same rate of 
increase for forecasted efficiencies in 
the standards case as in the base case 
(i.e., no change), DOE retained a 
constant efficiency difference between 
the two cases over the forecast period. 
Although the no-change trends may not 
reflect what would happen to base-case 
and standards-case equipment 
efficiencies in the future, DOE believes 
that maintaining a constant efficiency 
difference between the base case and 
standards case provides a reasonable 
estimate of the impact that standards 
have on equipment efficiency. It is more 
important to accurately estimate the 
efficiency difference between the 
standards case and base case, than to 
accurately estimate the actual 
equipment efficiencies in the standards 
and base cases. DOE retained the 
approach used in the October 2008 
NOPR for today’s SNOPR. But because 
the effective date of the standard is now 
assumed to be 2013, DOE applied the 
‘‘roll-up’’ scenario in the year 2013 to 
establish the SWEF for each of the 
standards cases. 
c. Annual Energy Consumption 

The annual energy consumption per 

unit depends directly on equipment 
efficiency. For the October 2008 NOPR 
and today’s SNOPR, DOE used the 
SWEFs associated with the base case 
and each standards case, in combination 
with the annual energy data, to estimate 
the shipment-weighted average annual 
per-unit energy consumption under the 
base case and standards cases. The 
national energy consumption is the 
product of the annual energy 
consumption per unit and the number 
of units of each vintage, which depends 
on shipments. 

As noted above in section III.D, DOE 

used a relative price elasticity to 
estimate standards-case shipments for 
CCWs. As a result, shipments forecasted 
under the standards cases are lower 
than under the base case. To avoid the 

inclusion of energy savings from 
reduced shipments, DOE used the 
standards-case shipments projection 
and the standards-case stock to calculate 
the annual energy consumption in the 
base case. For CCWs, any drop in 
shipments caused by standards is 
estimated to result in the purchase of 
used machines. As a result, the 
standards-case forecast explicitly 
accounted for the energy and water 
consumption of new standard- 
compliant CCWs and also used 
machines coming into the market due to 
the drop in new equipment shipments. 
DOE retained the use of the base-case 

shipments to determine the annual 
energy consumption in the base case 
and the approach used in the October 
2008 NOPR for today’s SNOPR. 
d. Site-to-Source Conversion 

To estimate the national energy 
savings expected from appliance 
standards, DOE uses a multiplicative 
factor to convert site energy 
consumption (energy use at the location 
where the appliance is operated) into 
primary or source energy consumption 
(the energy required to deliver the site 
energy). For the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE used annual site-to-source 
conversion factors based on the version 
of NEMS that corresponds to AEO 2008. 
For today’s SNOPR, DOE updated these 
conversion factors based on the AEO 
2009 March Release version of NEMS. 
These conversion factors account for 
natural gas losses from pipeline leakage 
and natural gas used for pumping 
energy and transportation fuel. For 
electricity, the conversion factors vary 
over time due to projected changes in 
generation sources (i.e., the power plant 
types projected to provide electricity to 
the country). Since the AEO does not 
provide energy forecasts that go beyond 
2030, DOE used conversion factors that 
remain constant at the 2030 values 
throughout the remainder of the 
forecast. 

In response to a request from the DOE, 

Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy (EERE), the National 
Research Council (NRC) appointed a 
committee on ‘‘Point-of-Use and Full- 
Fuel-Cycle Measurement Approaches to 
Energy Efficiency Standards’’ to conduct 
a study called for in Section 1802 of 
EPACT 2005.28 The fundamental task 
before the committee was to evaluate 
the methodology used for setting energy

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

efficiency standards and to comment on 
whether site (point-of-use) or source 
(full-fuel-cycle) measures of energy 
efficiency better support rulemaking to 
achieve energy conservation goals. The 
NRC committee defined site (point-of- 
use) energy consumption as reflecting 
the use of electricity, natural gas, 
propane, and/or fuel oil by an appliance 
at the site where the appliance is 
operated, based on specified test 
procedures. Full-fuel-cycle energy 
consumption was defined as including, 
in addition to site energy use, the energy 
consumed in the extraction, processing, 
and transport of primary fuels such as 
coal, oil, and natural gas; energy losses 
in thermal combustion in power- 
generation plants; and energy losses in 
transmission and distribution to homes 
and commercial buildings. 

In evaluating the merits of using 

point-of-use and full-fuel-cycle 
measures, the NRC committee noted 
that DOE uses what the committee 
referred to as ‘‘extended site’’ energy 
consumption to assess the impact of 
energy use on the economy, energy 
security, and environmental quality. 
The extended site measure of energy 
consumption includes the generation, 
transmission, and distribution but, 
unlike the full-fuel-cycle measure, does 
not include the energy consumed in 
extracting, processing, and transporting 
primary fuels. A majority of members on 
the NRC committee believe that 
extended site energy consumption 
understates the total energy consumed 
to make an appliance operational at the 
site. As a result, the NRC committee’s 
primary general recommendation is for 
DOE to consider moving over time to 
use of a full-fuel-cycle measure of 
energy consumption for assessment of 
national and environmental impacts, 
especially levels of greenhouse gas 
emissions, and to providing more 
comprehensive information to the 
public through labels and other means, 
such as an enhanced Web site. For those 
appliances that use multiple fuels (e.g., 
water heaters), the NRC committee 
believes that measuring full-fuel-cycle 
energy consumption would provide a 
more complete picture of energy used, 
allowing comparison across many 
different appliances as well as an 
improved assessment of impacts. The 
NRC committee also acknowledged the 
complexities inherent in developing a 
full-fuel-cycle measure of energy use 
and stated that a majority of the 
committee recommended a gradual 
transition to that expanded measure and 
eventual replacement of the currently 
used extended site measure. To improve 
consumers’ understanding, the 

committee recommended that DOE and 
the Federal Trade Commission could 
evaluate potential indices of energy use 
and its impacts and could explore 
various options for label design and 
content using established consumer 
research methods. 

DOE acknowledges that its site-to- 

source conversion factors do not capture 
the energy consumed in extracting, 
processing, and transporting primary 
fuels. DOE also agrees with the NRC 
committee’s conclusion that developing 
site-to-source conversion factors that 
capture the energy associated with the 
extraction, processing, and 
transportation of primary fuels is 
inherently complex and difficult. As a 
result, DOE will evaluate whether 
moving to a full-fuel-cycle measure will 
enhance its ability to set energy- 
efficiency standards. 

DOE also notes that the NRC 

committee’s recommendation to use a 
full-fuel-cycle measure was especially 
focused on appliances using multiple 
fuels. For single-fuel appliances, the 
committee recommended that the 
current practice of basing energy 
efficiency requirements on the site 
measure of energy consumption should 
be retained. Although CCWs utilize 
heated water from both electric and 
natural gas water heaters and are 
credited with improved performance by 
reducing the energy used in electric and 
gas clothes dryers, the energy efficiency 
metric with which they are regulated, 
the MEF, is expressed in terms of 
electrical energy usage (cubic feet per 
kWh). As a result, for labeling and 
enforcement purposes, CCWs are a 
single-fuel appliance. Therefore, 
although a full-fuel-cycle measure may 
provide a better assessment of national 
and environmental impacts, it is not 
necessary for providing energy use 
comparisons among CCW models. 
e. Energy Used in Water and Wastewater 
Treatment and Delivery 

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE did 

not include the energy required for 
water treatment and delivery. It stated 
that EPCA defines ‘‘energy use’’ to be 
‘‘the quantity of energy directly 
consumed by a consumer product at 
point of use, determined in accordance 
with test procedures under section 6293 
of [42 U.S.C.].’’ (42 U.S.C. 6291(4)) 
Based on the definition of ‘‘energy use,’’ 
DOE does not believe it has the 
authority to consider embedded energy 
(i.e., the energy required for water 
treatment and delivery) in the analysis. 
Furthermore, even if DOE had the 
authority, it does not believe adequate 

analytical tools exist to conduct such an 
evaluation.29 

The Joint Comment stated that DOE’s 
purported legal justification ignores that 
EPCA not only provides ample authority 
for DOE to consider this impact, but 
actually commands its consideration in 
weighing the economic justification for 
efficiency standards. (Joint Comment, 
No. 44, pp. 12–13) It said that DOE’s 
position that it lacks the authority to 
consider the energy embedded in water 
is untenable in light of 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII), which provides 
that in assessing the economic 
justification for a standard, DOE may 
consider any factors it concludes are 
relevant. It added that 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(III) directs DOE to 
consider, to the greatest extent 
practicable, ‘‘the total projected amount 
of energy * * * savings likely to result 
directly from the imposition of such 
standard.’’ It also stated that the plain 
language of EPCA thus commands that 
DOE assess the ‘‘energy saving’’ 
resulting from the standard, not simply 
the ‘‘energy use’’ of the covered 
products or equipment. Moreover, 
though the statute concerns those 
energy savings likely to ‘‘result directly’’ 
from the standard, that language merely 
requires DOE to isolate the standard’s 
impact from other energy saving 
initiatives for purposes of the economic 
justification analysis. (Joint Comment, 
No. 44 at p. 12–13) Pacific Gas & 
Electric Company (PG&E) stated that 
because of the preciousness of water in 
California and the embodied energy in 
it, a higher standard for CCWs is 
merited. (PG&E, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 136–137 and 
p. 181) Furthermore, PG&E commented 
that failing to consider energy in water 
due to the lack of an analytical tool is 
not acceptable. (PG&E, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 178–179 and 
p. 183) Additional comments submitted 
by EJ, ASAP, and ACEEE, suggested that 
the energy embedded in the delivery 
and treatment of water and wastewater 
should be included in the determination 
of national energy savings from the 
standards proposed in the October 2008 
NOPR. (EJ, Public Meeting Transcript, 

29 An analytical tool equivalent to EIA’s NEMS 

would be needed to properly account for embedded 
energy impacts on a national scale, including the 
embedded energy due to water and wastewater 
savings. This new version of NEMS would need to 
analyze spending and energy use in dozens, if not 
hundreds, of economic sectors. This version of 
NEMS also would need to account for shifts in 
spending in these various sectors to account for the 
marginal embedded energy differences among these 
sectors. 72 FR 64432, 64498–99 (Nov. 15, 2007). 
DOE does not have access to such a tool or other 
means to accurately estimate the source energy 
savings impacts of decreased water or wastewater 
consumption and expenditures.

Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 182) 

DOE continues to maintain that it 

only has the authority to consider the 
quantity of energy directly consumed by 
the equipment at point of use, and the 
energy consumed in production and 
delivery of that energy, in determining 
the total projected amount of energy 
savings likely to result directly from the 
imposition of a standard. Although DOE 
does agree with the Joint Comment that 
energy is consumed in providing water 
and wastewater service, this energy is 
not directly consumed by the equipment 
or in production and delivery of the 
energy. Inclusion of the embedded 
energy associated with water and 
wastewater service, would, for 
completeness, also require inclusion of 
the energy associated with all other 
aspects of the installation and operation 
of the equipment, e.g. the manufacture, 
distribution, and installation of the 
equipment. Furthermore, since water 
districts charge all costs related to 
transporting, treating, and distributing 
water to their consumers, the embedded 
energy is already accounted for in the 
LCC analysis. Thus, while DOE could go 
through the theoretical exercise of 
disaggegrating energy costs from total 
water costs, the LCC results would not 
change since the total cost of operating 
equipment would not change. 
f. Total Installed Costs and Operating 
Costs 

The increase in total annual installed 
cost is equal to the difference in the per- 
unit total installed cost between the 
base case and standards case, multiplied 
by the shipments forecasted in the 
standards case. The annual operating 
cost savings per unit includes changes 
in energy, water, repair, and 
maintenance costs. DOE forecasted 
energy prices for the October 2008 
NOPR based on AEO 2008; it updated 
the forecasts for today’s SNOPR using 
data from AEO 2009 April Release. For 
today’s SNOPR, DOE maintained the 
accounting system it used to develop 
repair and maintenance costs for more 
efficient CCWs in the October 2008 
NOPR. 
g. Discount Rates 

DOE multiplies monetary values in 
future years by the discount factor to 
determine the present value. DOE 
estimated national impacts using both a 
3-percent and a 7-percent real discount 
rate, in accordance with guidance 
provided by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) to Federal agencies 
on the development of regulatory

analysis (OMB Circular A–4 (Sept.17, 
2003), section E, ‘‘Identifying and 
Measuring Benefits and Costs’’).30 The 
Joint Comment stated that DOE should 
use a 2 to 3 percent real discount rate 
for national impact analyses. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 11) It noted that 
societal discount rates are the subject of 
extensive academic research, and the 
weight of academic opinion is that the 
appropriate societal discount rate is 3 
percent or less. It urged DOE to give 
primary weight to results based on the 
lower of the discount rates 
recommended by OMB. OMB Circular 
A–4 references an earlier Circular A–94, 
which states that a real discount rate of 
7 percent should be used as a base case 
for regulatory analysis. The 7 percent 
rate is an estimate of the average before- 
tax rate of return to private capital in the 
U.S. economy. It approximates the 
opportunity cost of capital, and, 
according to Circular A–94, it is the 
appropriate discount rate whenever the 
main effect of a regulation is to displace 
or alter the use of capital in the private 
sector. OMB later found that the average 
rate of return to capital remains near the 
7-percent rate estimated in 1992. 
Circular A–4 also states that when 
regulation primarily and directly affects 
private consumption, a lower discount 
rate is appropriate. ‘‘The alternative 
most often used is sometimes called the 
social rate of time preference * * * the 
rate at which ‘‘society’’ discounts future 
consumption flows to their present 
value.’’ It suggests that the real rate of 
return on long-term government debt 
may provide a fair approximation of the 
social rate of time preference, and states 
that over the last 30 years, this rate has 
averaged around 3 percent in real terms 
on a pre-tax basis. It concludes that ‘‘for 
regulatory analysis, [agencies] should 
provide estimates of net benefits using 
both 3 percent and 7 percent.’’ 
Consistent with OMB’s guidance, DOE 
did not give primary weight to results 
derived using a 3-percent discount rate. 

DOE also received comments 

regarding the discounting of emissions. 
The Joint Comment stated that DOE 
should not apply a discount rate to 
physical units of measure, such as tons 
of emissions or quads of energy. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 11) Consistent 
with Executive Order 12866, 
‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review,’’ 58 
FR 51737 (Oct. 4, 1993), DOE follows 
the guidance of OMB regarding 
methodologies and procedures for 
regulatory impact analysis that affect 
more than one agency. Regarding energy 
and environmental benefits from energy

conservation standards, DOE reported 
both discounted and undiscounted 
values. DOE retained the approach used 
in the October 2008 NOPR for today’s 
SNOPR. 
h. Effects of Standards on Energy Prices 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

conducted an analysis of the impact of 
reduced energy demand associated with 
possible standards on CCWs on prices of 
natural gas and electricity. The Joint 
Comment stated that the electricity 
price mitigation effects of the standard 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR 
should be documented and the value of 
reduced electricity bills to all 
consumers quantified as a benefit. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 11) The DOE 
analysis found that gas and electric 
demand reductions resulting from max- 
tech standards for CCWs would have no 
detectable change on the U.S. average 
wellhead natural gas price or the 
average user price of electricity. DOE 
concluded that CCW standards will not 
provide additional economic benefits 
resulting from lower energy prices. 
Thus, for today’s SNOPR DOE has made 
no change to its assumptions about the 
effects of standards on energy prices. 
See chapter 11 of the SNOPR TSD for 
more details. 
F. Consumer Subgroup Analysis 

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

analyzed the potential effects of CCW 
standards on two subgroups: (1) 
Consumers not served by municipal 
water and sewer providers, and (2) 
small businesses. For consumers not 
served by water and sewer, DOE 
analyzed the potential impacts of 
standards by conducting the analysis 
with well and septic system prices, 
rather than water and wastewater prices 
based on RFC/AWWA data. For small 
CCW businesses, DOE analyzed the 
potential impacts of standards by 
conducting the analysis with different 
discount rates, because small businesses 
do not have the same access to capital 
as larger businesses. DOE estimated that 
for businesses purchasing CCWs, the 
average discount rate for small 
companies is 3.5 percent higher than the 
industry average. Due to the higher costs 
of conducting business, as evidenced by 
their higher discount rates, the benefits 
of CCW standards for small businesses 
will be lower than for the general 
population of CCW owners. For today’s 
SNOPR DOE has made no changes to its 
assumptions about benefits of CCW 
standards to small businesses. 

DOE received comments regarding the 

economic impacts of higher initial 
clothes washer costs. Alliance and MLA 
stated that the standards proposed in

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

the October 2008 NOPR would result in 
substantial price increases for customers 
of central area laundry rooms, especially 
for elderly, low-income, college 
students, and disabled end-users. MLA 
stated that a majority of the 35–50 
million CCW customers are low- or low- 
to-middle income people, many of 
whom are elderly or who suffer 
disabilities. (Alliance, No. 45 at p. 1 and 
Attachment 2, p. 12; MLA, No. 49 at pp. 
1–4) PG&E commented that lower- 
income consumers may pay higher 
energy costs in laundry rooms using 
older machines than those who have 
access to new machines. (PG&E, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 25) 
DOE research suggests that the end- 
users of CCWs are unlikely to be the 
owners of the equipment. Although low- 
income end-users do utilize CCWs, it is 
unknown to what affect more efficient 
CCWs will impact their cost of using the 
equipment. If the price of operating a 
CCW to an end-user does increase, DOE 
estimates that such an increase would 
occur only if the CCW owner needed to 
increase the price of operation to 
recover or capture its increased costs of 
providing more efficient equipment 
while not benefitting from the lower 
utility consumption. Although DOE 
does recognize that this could occur, it 
is equally likely that the price of 
operation to end-users would not 
increase as the increased expense to the 
CCW owner of providing more efficient 
CCWs is more than offset by lifetime 
utility bill savings from the more- 
efficient CCW. More details on the 
consumer subgroup analysis can be 
found in chapter 12 of the SNOPR TSD. 
G. Manufacturer Impact Analysis 

DOE performed an MIA to estimate 

the financial impact of amended energy 
conservation standards on CCW 
manufacturers, and to calculate the 
impact of such standards on domestic 
manufacturing employment and 
capacity. The MIA has both quantitative 
and qualitative aspects. The quantitative 
part of the MIA primarily relies on the 
GRIM—an industry-cash-flow model 
customized for this rulemaking. The 
GRIM inputs are data characterizing the 
industry cost structure, shipments, and 
revenues. The key output is the INPV. 
Different sets of assumptions (scenarios) 
will produce different results. The 
qualitative part of the MIA addresses 
factors such as equipment 
characteristics, characteristics of 
particular firms, and market and 
equipment trends, and it also includes 
an assessment of the impacts of 
standards on subgroups of 
manufacturers. DOE outlined its 
methodology for the MIA in the October

2008 NOPR. 73 FR 62034, 62075–81 
(Oct. 17, 2008). The complete MIA for 
the October 2008 NOPR is presented in 
chapter 13 of the NOPR TSD. 

For today’s supplemental notice, DOE 

updated the MIA results based on 
several changes to other analyses that 
impact the MIA. The total shipments 
and efficiency distributions were 
updated using the new estimates 
outlined in the SNOPR NIA. The MIA 
also uses the new analysis period in the 
NIA (2013–2043) and has updated the 
base year to 2009. As discussed in 
section III.C.2, DOE updated the 
manufacturer production costs and the 
capital and equipment conversion costs 
to 2008$ using the producer price index 
for commercial laundry equipment 
manufacturing (NAICS 333312). DOE 
updated the GRIM to allow the 
inclusion of Federal production tax 
credits. DOE discusses the assumptions 
and methodology used to calculate the 
Federal production tax in appendix 13C 
and in the section below. For details of 
the MIA, see chapter 13 of the SNOPR 
TSD. 

DOE also received a number of 

comments from interested parties in 
response to the MIA analysis presented 
in the October 2008 NOPR. Alliance 
stated that the top-loading CCW energy 
conservation standard proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR would eliminate 
Alliance from the CCW market, and 
eliminate top-loading CCWs from the 
market as well. (Alliance, No. 45 at 
Attachment 2, p. 3) Alliance stated that, 
if it were to exit the CCW market, the 
CCW market would suffer significant 
competitive harm. Alliance also stated 
that more than 20 route operators and 
the MLA are opposed to the standard 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR 
because it would result in a loss of 
competition. (Alliance, No. 45 at p. 1 
and Attachment 2, pp. 6–12) Alliance 
stated that the lower CCW market 
competition could lead to price 
increases from Alliance’s competitors, 
such as the combined Whirlpool and 
Maytag entities, which currently control 
72 percent of the RCW market. Alliance 
predicted that these manufacturers 
would control about 90 percent of the 
CCW market if Alliance were to stop 
making CCWs. Alliance sees this 
outcome as a monopoly for Whirlpool. 
(Alliance, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at p. 24) 

Alliance stated that it cannot justify 

the investment necessary to develop the 
technology required to reach the top- 
loading energy conservation standard 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR. 
Alliance cited a lack of resources as the 
LVM to justify an investment in a ‘‘non- 
traditional’’ top-loader with unknown 

market acceptance (Alliance, No. 45 at 
Attachment 2, p. 8). Alliance stated that 
the top-loading standard proposed in 
the October 2008 NOPR would likely 
result in significant, detrimental 
impacts to the LVM, as Alliance does 
not have the resources for research and 
development, re-configuring production 
lines, or licensing the advanced 
technology required to meet the 
standard. (Alliance, Public Meeting 
Transcript, pp. 23–24) Alliance believes 
that a top-loading energy conservation 
standard set at 1.42 MEF/9.5 WF would 
lessen these impacts. Alliance suggested 
that the top-loading CCW energy 
conservation standard proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR would force 
Alliance to cease production of CCWs 
due to the high investment costs 
required to design and manufacture the 
technology to meet the standard. 
(Alliance, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 40.5 at pp. 22–24 and p. 202; 
Alliance, No. 45 at Attachment 2, pp. 7– 
8) Alliance estimates these costs based 
on its belief that non-traditional 
technology will be required to meet the 
standard with wash performance that 
would be acceptable for commercial 
laundromat use. 

MLA commented that the top-loading 
CCW standard proposed in the October 
2008 NOPR would most likely result in 
the elimination of all but one 
manufacturer of top-loading CCWs 
(Whirlpool) as well as the elimination of 
many route operators due to higher 
equipment costs resulting from reduced 
competition. (MLA, No. 49 at pp. 1–3) 
Finally, EEI suggested that DOE create a 
standard that will save energy and be 
market neutral, such that multiple 
manufacturers could meet it. (EEI, No. 
56 at pp. 2–3) 

EPCA directs DOE to consider any 

lessening of competition that is likely to 
result from standards. It directs the 
Attorney General to determine the 
impact, if any, of any lessening of 
competition likely to result from a 
proposed standard and to transmit such 
determination to the Secretary, not later 
than 60 days after the publication of a 
proposed rule, together with an analysis 
of the nature and extent of such impact. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and 
(B)(ii)). DOE received a response from 
the Acting Assistant Attorney General 
on December 16, 2008. The letter stated 
that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is 
not in a position to judge whether CCW 
manufacturers will be able to meet the 
standards proposed in the October 2008 
NOPR. Nevertheless, DOJ found a ‘‘real 
risk that one or more of these 
manufacturers cannot meet the 
proposed standard’’ for top-loading 
CCWs published in the October 2008

NOPR. (Attorney General, No. 53 at p. 
2) 

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

noted the concerns regarding the 
proposed conservation standards for 
top-loading CCWs in particular. 73 FR 
62034, 62103–104 (Oct. 17, 2008). DOE 
also included a section in chapter 13 of 
the TSD that estimated likely financial 
impacts for the LVM to meet the 
efficiency standards proposed in the 
2008 NOPR. DOE continues to offer a 
sub-group assessment of the differential 
impacts on the LVM in chapter 13. 

In response to concerns raised by DOJ 
and other concerns raised by interested 
parties, DOE is proposing in today’s 
SNOPR a 1.60 MEF/8.5 WF standard for 
top-loading CCWs. DOE believes that 
this proposed energy conservation 
standard will greatly ease the 
competitive concerns of Alliance, GE, 
MLA, and DOJ. DOE research suggests 
that today’s proposed standard is within 
reach of all competitors in the market, 
since the max-tech unit is based on a 
standard RCW top-loading platform (i.e. 
one with an agitator) and that no 
proprietary technologies were used. 
DOE research suggests that Alliance 
currently produces a model with 1.5 
MEF/8.8 WF that DOE believes can be 
modified to meet today’s proposed 
standard. As such, a dramatic decline in 
competition in the CCW industry does 
not seem likely since all manufacturers 
should be able to release a washer with 
similar technology at the present 
efficiency level. DOE requests comment 
on competitive concerns at today’s 
proposed standard. 

Alliance and GE commented that the 

top-loading standard proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR would have a 
detrimental impact on the CCW 
industry and labor force. (Alliance, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at 
pp. 23–24; Alliance, No. 45 at 
Attachment 2, p. 3; GE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 31–32) 
Furthermore, Alliance stated that no 
manufacturer will be willing to use an 
unproven non-traditional design in the 
commercial market, resulting in the 
elimination of top-loading CCW 
production. With manufacturers like 
Alliance exiting the business, over 1,000 
jobs would be lost. Alliance also stated 
that there could be spillover harm 
because Alliance could also exit other 
laundry market segments. (Alliance, No. 
45 at Attachment 2, p. 17)

calculated the direct employment 
impacts using the GRIM and 
information gathered from interviews 
with manufacturers. In the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE estimated that there would 
be positive employment impacts among 

domestic commercial clothes washer 
manufacturers for TSL 1 through TSL 5. 
Because production labor expenditures 
are assumed to be a fixed percentage of 
the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and the 
Manufacturing Product Costs (MPCs) 
increase with more efficient equipment, 
labor tracks the increased prices in the 
GRIM. The GRIM predicts a steady level 
of domestic employment after standards 
at a level based on the increase in 
relative price. Because the LVM had 
previously stated it would be eliminated 
from the commercial market, DOE also 
specifically investigated the LVM 
employment using its commercial 
washer revenues and additional 
employment estimates. DOE’s scenarios 
included one in which the LVM ceased 
to produce soft-mount washers or 
standard dryers and a scenario with a 
complete closure of the LVM’s domestic 
manufacturing plant. DOE estimated 
that the LVM’s ceasing to produce soft- 
mount dryers and CCWs would result in 
292 lost production jobs and that a 
complete closure of the facility would 
result in the dismissal of approximately 
600 factory employees. 73 FR 60234, 
62102–3 (Oct. 17, 2008). DOE believes 
that the energy conservation standard 
proposed in today’s notice will allow 
the LVM to continue to produce top- 
loading CCWs, mitigating any potential 
closure of its domestic manufacturing 
facility. Further discussion of the LVM 
and the potential impacts on direct 
employment for the CCW industry is 
presented in chapter 13 of the TSD. 

DOE received comments on the likely 
benefits of Federal producer tax credits 
for which some CCW manufacturers 
could be eligible. Such credits accrue to 
manufacturers on the basis of appliance 
or equipment efficiencies as well as 
other eligibility requirements. The Joint 
Comment stated that DOE did not 
account for Federal production tax 
credits for efficient appliances produced 
after 2007 in the MIA and that the LVM 
is likely to disproportionately benefit 
from these Federal production tax 
incentives. According to the Joint 
Comment, the Federal production tax 
credits should substantially off-set 
conversion capital requirements and 
equipment conversion expenses, 
mitigating the financial impacts of 
higher efficiency levels. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at pp. 7–10) 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE did 
not fully account for the impacts of the 
Federal production tax credits updated 
by The Energy Improvement and 
Extension Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110–343; 
EIEA 2008). However, DOE research 
suggests that the Joint Comment 
overstates the potential benefits that 
CCW manufacturers would accumulate 

through the tax credits found in EIEA 
2008. A key assumption in the Joint 
Comment analysis is that all major CCW 
manufacturers indentified for this 
rulemaking would be able to benefit 
from the tax credit (Joint Comment, No. 
44 at pp. 8–9). According to the title III, 
section 305 (b)(2) from EIEA 2008, and 
title I section 1334 (c)(1)(B) from EPACT 
2005, the tax credit is only awarded for 
equipment produced in the United 
States. Using market research and 
interviews with manufacturers, DOE 
believes that only the LVM produces 
qualifying CCWs. Other manufacturers 
offer washers that meet the MEFs and 
WF requirements, but these washers are 
either made outside the United States or 
are sourced from other domestic 
manufacturers, or are not sold in the 
commercial market. See appendix 13C 
of the SNOPR TSD for further 
discussion of the Federal production tax 
credit. 

According to the Joint Comment, the 
Federal production tax credit could be 
used by the industry to offset the 
conversion costs necessary to comply 
with the energy conservation standards 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR. 
(Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 7) In its 
analysis, the Joint Comment does not 
account for any conversion costs 
associated with a complete production 
transfer of top-load to front-load 
washers. The equipment conversion and 
capital conversion cost shown in the 
GRIM and chapter 13 take all existing 
front-loading washers into 
consideration, including those that 
qualify for the Federal production tax 
credit. In its calculation of the 
equipment and capital conversion costs, 
DOE considered that the LVM already 
had qualifying washers at both 2.0 MEF/ 
6.0 WF and 2.2 MEF/4.5 WF levels; 
hence, no additional product 
development appeared necessary to 
achieve these efficiency levels. 
Therefore, DOE did not include any 
capital or product conversion costs in 
the GRIM for the LVM at a 2.0 MEF 
level. However, DOE research suggested 
that the LVM would have some capital 
conversion costs if the front-loading 
efficiency level were raised to 2.2 MEF, 
because the production levels of such 
washers would have to dramatically 
increase from present shipment levels. 
DOE acknowledges that the Federal 

production tax credit could have 
mitigating effects in lessening the 
impacts due to energy conservation 
standards. However, as described above 
and in appendix 13C, DOE estimates the 
benefits of Federal production tax 
credits for CCW manufacturers will not 
greatly mitigate the impacts due 
amended energy conservation

standards. In the GRIM, DOE accounts 
for the Federal tax credit as a direct cash 
benefit in the base and standards cases 
that increases the INPV. This increase in 
industry value lessens the impacts on 
manufacturers due to amended energy 
conservation standards. However, 
because the benefit of the Federal 
production tax credit is less significant 
than calculated in the Joint Comment 
and mostly occurs outside the analysis 
period, the benefits do not substantially 
impact the INPV calculated by DOE. 

Because only the LVM produces 

qualifying CCWs, DOE based its 
estimates of the potential benefits to the 
CCW industry by estimating the 
potential Federal production tax credits 
that the LVM could receive. Using 
publically available information, recent 
SEC filings, and the information 
published in chapter 13 and appendix 
13A of the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
estimated the LVM’s front-loading CCW 
shipment projections to 2010. These 
estimates suggest that the LVM could 
collect $2.8 million in Federal 
production tax credits from 2008–2010 
from the provisions updated by EIEA 
2008 and $4.1 million from the program 
from 2007 to 2010. Based on its 
calculations, the LVM received the 
biggest benefit from the tax credit in 
2008. According to the ENERGY STAR 
database,31 the LVM released a model 
that qualified for the $250 Federal 
production tax credit on September 26, 
2008, shortly before EIEA 2008 was 
enacted. Because the higher tax credits 
were retroactive for all of 2008, the LVM 
received a $2.4 million Federal tax 
credit in 2008 because it had 
substantially increased production of 
qualifying front-loading CCWs. Using 
the LVM’s SEC Form 10–Q for the 
quarter ending March 31, 2009,32 DOE 
estimates that in 2009 the LVM will 
receive $385,000 in Federal production 
tax credits. DOE estimates that the LVM 
is unlikely to qualify for any additional 
Federal production tax credit in 2010 
even if the volume of qualifying washers 
increases. DOE has a more extensive 
explanation of its calculations of the 
Federal production tax credits in 
appendix 13C of the SNOPR TSD. 

The Joint Comment bases its analysis 

on manufacturers completely shifting 
production to front-loading washers. 
However, DOE believes that it is 
unlikely all manufacturers would shift 
production to exclusively front-loading

washers in response to the Federal 
production tax credits or the energy 
conservation standards proposed in 
today’s rule. As discussed in section 
III.E, in response to the Federal 
production tax credit, DOE estimates 
that the tax credits would permanently 
transform the market so that front- 
loading washers would continue to 
comprise 30 percent of the market over 
the entire forecast period. This shift 
towards front-loading washers has 
mitigating effects on the impacts on 
manufacturers due to energy 
conservation standards. However, the 
shift is not great enough to significantly 
decrease the impacts as the Joint 
Comment suggests. Using the same 
assumptions used for calculations found 
in appendix 13A, DOE estimates that 
the LVM increased the production of 
front-loading washers by approximately 
10,000 washers in 2007 and 2008. 
Though the estimates show that there 
were significant increases in front- 
loading shipments for the LVM in 2007 
and 2008, shipments for fiscal year 2009 
are projected to decrease and hence 
reduce the Federal production tax 
credits. 

The Joint Comment acknowledges but 
does not account for factors that would 
offset the benefits from the Federal 
production tax credit that would accrue 
to CCW manufacturers. In its LVM 
analysis for the October 2008 NOPR, 
DOE examined the capital costs that 
would be required to create a front- 
loading washer facility for 100,000 
annual unit shipments. DOE estimated 
that a green-field facility with all 
production equipment would cost the 
LVM approximately $54 million. In that 
same analysis, DOE estimated that the 
total tooling required would cost 
approximately $18 million. If the LVM 
had to invest to exclusively offer front- 
loading washers, these investments 
would more than offset the benefit 
calculated in the Joint Comment for all 
CCW manufacturers. In fact, the tooling 
alone would more than eliminate the 
benefit calculated for the entire CCW 
industry in the Joint Comment. The 
Joint Comment states that the LVM is in 
a position to disproportionately benefit 
from the Federal production tax credit. 
(Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 8) While 
DOE acknowledges that the LVM is the 
only manufacturer eligible to receive a 
Federal production tax credit in the 
CCW market, DOE research suggests that 
the LVM would not disproportionately 
benefit because the costs to upgrade its 
production facilities for higher-volume 
front-loading washer manufacturing, in 
addition to necessary redesigns of its 
existing front-loading washers, are 

estimated to be multiples of the tax 
credit. For further information, see 
appendix 13C of the SNOPR TSD. The 
Joint Comment also states that part of 
the Federal production tax credit will 
need to be shared with distributors and 
customers to stimulate growth. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 9) However, the 
Joint Comment does not reduce the 
benefit to the CCW industry that would 
occur if manufacturers did not keep all 
of the tax credit. 

DOE received comment regarding its 
characterization of CCW manufacturers 
and the LVM in particular. The Joint 
Comment argued that DOE should not 
characterize Alliance as an LVM, as the 
LVM reported revenues equivalent to 
approximately half of the total CCW 
revenue and claims to be the leading 
manufacturer of stand-alone commercial 
laundry equipment in North America. 
(Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 7) For the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE presented a 
separate analysis of the LVM. 73 FR 
62034, 62103–104 (Oct. 17, 2008). 
Although DOE agrees with the Joint 
Comment that the LVM has a significant 
share of the CCW industry based on 
revenues in reports filed with the SEC, 
DOE believes that the LVM does not 
have the same overall clothes washer 
manufacturing scale as its competitors 
(for both residential products and 
commercial equipment) and should be 
characterized as an LVM. 

In the LVM analysis, DOE notes that 

most CCWs on the market in the United 
States are based largely on RCW 
platforms that are upgraded selectively. 
Some investments (such as the 
controllers) are CCW-specific but only 
make up part of the total unit cost. The 
majority of capital expenditures related 
to tooling, equipment, and other 
machinery in a plant can usually be 
applied to the residential as well as the 
commercial market. Thus, overall (both 
RCW and CCW) manufacturing scale has 
a significant impact on the cost- 
effectiveness of potential upgrades. A 
manufacturer with a high-volume 
residential line can cost justify much 
more capital-intensive solutions if they 
are applicable in both markets, in 
contrast to an LVM which lacks the 
scale to make the investments 
worthwhile. Thus, an LVM may be 
required to purchase upgrade options 
from third-party vendors instead of 
developing in-house solutions that 
reduce costs at higher volumes. In the 
clothes washer market, the most direct 
CCW competitor has over 60 times the 
overall shipment volumes of the LVM. 
This scale difference also relates to 
purchasing power. A large, diversified 
appliance manufacturer can use its 
production scale to achieve better prices

for raw materials and commonly 
purchased components like controllers, 
motors, belts, switches, sensors, and 
wiring harnesses. Even if a large 
company purchases fewer items of a 
certain component, its overall revenue 
relationship with a supplier may still 
enable it to achieve better pricing than 
a smaller competitor, even if that 
competitor buys certain components in 
higher quantities. Lastly, high-volume 
manufacturers benefit from being able to 
source their components through 
sophisticated supply chains on a 
worldwide basis. A low-volume 
manufacturer is unlikely to be able to 
compete solely on manufacturing cost. 

DOE seeks comment on the 

determination of manufacturer impacts, 
including the effects of manufacturer tax 
credits and competitive concerns. This 
is identified as Issue 5 in section VII.E 
of today’s supplemental notice (Issues 
on Which DOE Seeks Comment.) 
H. Employment Impact Analysis 

DOE considers employment impacts 
in the domestic economy as one factor 
in selecting a proposed standard. 
Employment impacts include direct and 
indirect impacts. Direct employment 
impacts are changes in the number of 
employees for manufacturers of 
equipment subject to standards, their 
suppliers, and related service firms. The 
MIA addresses these impacts. 

Indirect employment impacts from 

standards consist of the net jobs created 
or eliminated in the national economy, 
other than in the manufacturing sector 
being regulated, due to: (1) Reduced 
spending by end users on energy 
(electricity, gas (including liquefied 
petroleum gas), and oil); (2) reduced 
spending on new energy supply by the 
utility industry; (3) increased spending 
on the purchase price of new 
equipment; and (4) the effects of those 
three factors throughout the economy. 
DOE expects the net monetary savings 
from standards to be redirected to other 
forms of economic activity. DOE also 
expects these shifts in spending and 
economic activity to affect the demand 
for labor in the short term, as explained 
below. 

One method for assessing the possible 

effects on the demand for labor of such 
shifts in economic activity is to compare 
sectoral employment statistics 
developed by the BLS. The BLS 
regularly publishes its estimates of the 
number of jobs per million dollars of 
economic activity in different sectors of 
the economy, as well as the jobs created 
elsewhere in the economy by this same 
economic activity. Data from BLS 
indicate that expenditures in the utility 
sector generally create fewer jobs (both

directly and indirectly) than 
expenditures in other sectors of the 
economy. There are many reasons for 
these differences, including wage 
differences and the fact that the utility 
sector is more capital intensive and less 
labor intensive than other sectors. (See 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional 
Multipliers: A User Handbook for the 
Regional Input-Output Modeling System 
(RIMS II), Washington, DC, U.S. 
Department of Commerce (1992).) 
Efficiency standards have the effect of 
reducing consumer utility bills. Because 
reduced consumer expenditures for 
energy likely lead to increased 
expenditures in other sectors of the 
economy, the general effect of efficiency 
standards is to shift economic activity 
from a less labor-intensive sector (i.e., 
the utility sector) to more labor- 
intensive sectors (e.g., the retail and 
manufacturing sectors). Thus, based on 
the BLS data alone, DOE believes net 
national employment will increase due 
to shifts in economic activity resulting 
from standards for CCWs. 

In developing the October 2008 NOPR 

and today’s SNOPR, DOE estimated 
indirect national employment impacts 
using an input/output model of the U.S. 
economy called Impact of Sector Energy 
Technologies (ImSET).33 ImSET is a 
special-purpose version of the ‘‘U.S. 
Benchmark National Input-Output’’ 
(I–O) model designed to estimate the 
national employment and income 
effects of energy-saving technologies. 
The ImSET software includes a 
computer-based I–O model with 
structural coefficients to characterize 
economic flows among 188 sectors most 
relevant to industrial, commercial, and 
residential building energy use. The 
Joint Comment stated that DOE must 
consider its projections that an increase 
in employment will result from the 
adoption of standards in weighing the 
economic costs and benefits of strong 
efficiency standards. (Joint Comment, 
No. 44 at p. 13) As described in section 
V.B.3 below, DOE takes into 
consideration the indirect employment 
impacts estimated using ImSET when 
evaluating alternative standard levels. 
Direct employment impacts on the 
manufacturers that produce CCWs are 
analyzed in the MIA, as discussed in 
section III.G. For today’s SNOPR, DOE 
has made no change to its method for 
estimating employment impacts. For 
further details, see chapter 15 of the 
SNOPR TSD. 

33 More information regarding ImSET is available 

online at: http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/ 
external/technical_reports/PNNL-15273.pdf. 

I. Utility Impact Analysis 

The utility impact analysis estimates 

the change in the forecasted power 
generation capacity for the Nation, 
which would be expected to result from 
adoption of new standards. This 
analysis separately determines the 
changes to supply and demand as a 
result of natural gas, fuel oil, liquefied 
petroleum gas, or electricity residential 
consumption savings due to the 
standard. For the October 2008 NOPR 
and today’s SNOPR, DOE calculated this 
change using the NEMS–BT computer 
model. NEMS–BT models certain policy 
scenarios such as the effect of reduced 
energy consumption per TSL by fuel 
type. The analysis output provides a 
forecast for the needed generation 
capacities at each TSL. The estimated 
net benefit of the standard for today’s 
SNOPR is the difference between the 
forecasted generation capacities by 
NEMS–BT and the AEO 2009 April 
Release Reference Case. DOE obtained 
the energy savings inputs associated 
with electricity and natural gas 
consumption savings from the NIA. 
These inputs reflect the effects of 
efficiency improvement on CCW energy 
consumption, both fuel (natural gas) and 
electricity. Chapter 14 of the SNOPR 
TSD presents results of the utility 
impact analysis. 

In its October 2008 NOPR, DOE did 

not estimate impacts on water and 
wastewater utilities because the water 
and wastewater utility sector is more 
complicated than either the electric 
utility or gas utility sectors, with a high 
degree of geographic variability 
produced by a large diversity of water 
resource availability, institutional 
history, and regulatory context. 73 FR 
62034, 62082 (Oct. 17, 2008). For 
today’s SNOPR, for the reasons cited 
above, DOE did not estimate impacts to 
the water and wastewater utility sector. 
J. Environmental Assessment 

Pursuant to the National 

Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI), DOE 
prepared a draft environmental 
assessment (EA) of the potential impacts 
of the proposed standards for CCWs it 
considered for today’s supplemental 
notice which it has included as chapter 
16 of the TSD for the SNOPR. DOE 
found the environmental effects 
associated with the standards for CCWs 
to be insignificant. Therefore, DOE is 
issuing a Finding of No Significant 
Impact (FONSI), pursuant to NEPA, the 
regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 
1500–1508), and DOE’s regulations for

57766 

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

compliance with NEPA (10 CFR part 
1021). The FONSI is available in the 
docket for this rulemaking. 

In the EA, DOE estimated the 

reduction in power sector emissions of 
CO2 and NOX using the NEMS–BT 
computer model. DOE also calculated a 
range of estimates for reduction in Hg 
emissions using power sector emission 
rates. The EA does not include the 
estimated reduction in power sector 
impacts of sulfur dioxide (SO2), because 
DOE has determined that any such 
reduction resulting from an energy 
conservation standard would not affect 
the overall level of SO2 emissions in the 
United States due to the presence of 
national caps on SO2 emissions. These 
topics are addressed further below; see 
chapter 16 of the TSD for additional 
detail. 

NEMS–BT is run similarly to the AEO 

2009 April Release NEMS, except that 
CCW energy use is reduced by the 
amount of energy saved (by fuel type) 
due to the TSLs. The inputs of national 
energy savings come from the NIA 
analysis. For the EA, the output is the 
forecasted physical emissions. The net 
benefit of a standard is the difference 
between emissions estimated by NEMS– 
BT and the AEO 2009 April Release 
Reference Case. The NEMS–BT tracks 
CO2 emissions using a detailed module 
that provides results with broad 
coverage of all sectors and inclusion of 
interactive effects. 

Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets an 

annual emissions cap on SO2 for all 
electric generating units. The attainment 
of the emissions cap is flexible among 
generators and is enforced through the 
use of emissions allowances and 
tradable permits. In other words, with or 
without a standard, total cumulative 
SO2 emissions will always be at or near 
the ceiling, while there may be some 
timing differences between year-by-year 
forecast. Thus, it is unlikely that there 
will be reduced SO2 emissions from 
standards as long as there is 
enforcement of the emissions ceilings. 
Although there may not be an actual 
reduction in SO2 emissions, there still 
may be an economic benefit from 
reduced demand for SO2 emission 
allowances. Electricity savings decrease 
the generation of SO2 emissions from 
power production, which can lessen the 
need to purchase SO2 emissions 
allowance credits, and thereby decrease 
the costs of complying with regulatory 
caps on emissions. 

NOX emissions from 28 eastern States 

and the District of Columbia (D.C.) are 
limited under the Clean Air Interstate 
Rule (CAIR), published in the Federal 

Register on May 12, 2005.34 Although 
CAIR has been remanded to EPA by the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit), it will 
remain in effect until it is replaced by 
a rule consistent with the Court’s July 
11, 2008 opinion in North Carolina v. 
EPA.35 Because all States covered by 
CAIR opted to reduce NOX emissions 
through participation in cap and trade 
programs for electric generating units, 
emissions from these sources are capped 
across the CAIR region. 

For the 28 eastern States and D.C. 

where CAIR is in effect, no NOX 
emissions reductions will occur due to 
the permanent cap. Under caps, 
physical emissions reductions in those 
States would not result from the energy 
conservation standards under 
consideration by DOE, but standards 
might have produced an 
environmentally related economic 
impact in the form of lower prices for 
emissions allowance credits, if they 
were large enough. However, DOE 
determined that in the present case, 
such standards would not produce an 
environmentally related economic 
impact in the form of lower prices for 
emissions allowance credits, because 
the estimated reduction in NOX 
emissions or the corresponding 
allowance credits in States covered by 
the CAIR cap would be too small to 
affect allowance prices for NOX under 
the CAIR. In contrast, new or amended 
energy conservation standards would 
reduce NOX emissions in those 22 States 
that are not affected by CAIR. As a 
result, the NEMS–BT does forecast 
emission reductions from the CCW 
standards considered in today’s 
supplemental notice. 

In the October 2008 NOPR, however, 

DOE provided a different estimate of 
NOX reductions, because DOE assumed 
that the CAIR had been vacated. 74 FR 
16920, 17009–14 (April 13, 2009). This 
is because the CAIR was vacated by the 
D.C. Circuit in its July 11, 2008 decision 
in North Carolina v. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 531 F.3d 896 (D.C. 
Cir. 2008). Thus, for the October 2008 
NOPR, DOE established a range of NOX 
reductions based on low and high 
emissions rates (in kt of NOX emitted 
per terawatt-hour (TWh) of electricity 
generated) derived from the AEO 2008. 
DOE anticipated that, in the absence of 
the CAIR’s trading program, the new or 
amended energy conservation standards 
would reduce NOX emissions 
nationwide, not just in 22 States. 

34 70 FR 25162 (May 12, 2005). 
35 531 F.3d 896 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see also North 
Carolina v. EPA, 550 F.3d 1176 (D.C. Cir. 2008).

Similar to SO2 and NOX, future 
emissions of Hg would have been 
subject to emissions caps under Clean 
Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) [70 FR 28606 
(May 18, 2005)], which would have 
permanently capped emissions of Hg for 
new and existing coal-fired plants in all 
States by 2010, but the CAMR was 
vacated by the D.C. Circuit in its 
decision in New Jersey v. Environmental 
Protection Agency prior to the 
publication of the October 2008 NOPR. 
517 F.3d 574 (D.C. Cir. 2008). However, 
the NEMS–BT model DOE initially used 
to estimate the changes in emissions for 
the proposed rule assumed that Hg 
emissions would be subject to CAMR 
emission caps. 

After CAMR was vacated, DOE was 
unable to use the NEMS–BT model to 
estimate any changes in the physical 
quantity of Hg emissions (anywhere in 
the country) that would result from 
standard levels it considered in the 
October 2008 NOPR. Instead, DOE used 
an Hg emission rate (in metric tons of 
Hg per energy produced) based on the 
AEO 2008. Because virtually all Hg 
emitted from electricity generation is 
from coal-fired power plants, DOE based 
the emission rate on the metric tons of 
Hg emitted per TWh of coal-generated 
electricity. To estimate the reduction in 
Hg emissions, DOE multiplied the 
emission rate by the reduction in coal- 
generated electricity associated with 
standards considered. Because the 
CAMR is still vacated, DOE continued 
to use the approach utilized for the 
October 2008 NOPR, updated for the 
AEO 2009 April Release to estimate the 
Hg emission reductions due to 
standards for today’s SNOPR. 

In addition to electricity, the 

operation of gas-fired CCWs results in 
emissions of CO2 and NOX at the sites 
where the appliances are used. NEMS– 
BT provides no means for estimating 
such emissions. Therefore, DOE 
calculated separate estimates of the 
effect of the potential standards on site 
emissions of CO2 and NOX based on 
emissions factors derived from the 
literature. Because natural gas 
combustion does not yield SO2 
emissions, DOE did not report in either 
the October 2008 NOPR or today’s 
SNOPR the effect of the proposed 
standards on site emissions of SO2. 
K. Monetizing Carbon Dioxide and 
Other Emissions Impacts 

DOE also calculated the possible 

monetary benefit of CO2, NOX, and Hg 
reductions. Cumulative monetary 
benefits were determined using 
discount rates of 3 and 7 percent. DOE 
monetized reductions in CO2 emissions 
due to standards in this proposed rule

based on a range of monetary values 
drawn from studies that attempt to 
estimate the present value of the 
marginal economic benefits (based on 
the avoided marginal social costs of 
carbon) likely to result from reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. The marginal 
social cost of carbon is an estimate of 
the monetary value to society of the 
environmental damages of CO2 
emissions. 

Several parties provided comments 

regarding the economic valuation of CO2 
for the October 2008 NOPR. Whirlpool 
does not support an attempt to value 
those emissions as part of this 
rulemaking. (Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 8) 
EEI stated that utilities have embedded 
the cost of complying with existing 
environmental legislation in their price 
for electricity, and a similar approach 
may be reasonable for valuing reduced 
CO2 emissions. (EEI, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 194–195) The 
Joint Comment stated that DOE’s 
valuation of avoided CO2 emissions 
should utilize EIA’s analysis of the 
Climate Security Act. The core scenario 
of this analysis yields a $17 price per 
ton of CO2, with an annual 7.4 percent 
increase. (Joint Comment, No. 44 at p. 
12) As discussed in section V.B.6, DOE 
has updated the approach described in 
the October 2008 NOPR (73 FR 62034, 
62107 (Oct. 17, 2008)) for its 
monetization of environmental 
emissions reductions for today’s 
SNOPR. 

Although this rulemaking does not 

affect SO2 emissions or NOX emissions 
in the 28 eastern States and D.C. where 
CAIR is in effect, there are markets for 
SO2 and NOX emissions allowances. 
The market clearing price of SO2 and 
NOX emissions allowances is roughly 
the marginal cost of meeting the 
regulatory cap, not the marginal value of 
the cap itself. Further, because national 
SO2 and NOX emissions are regulated by 
a cap and trade system, the cost of 
meeting these caps is included in the 
price of energy. Thus, the value of 
energy savings already includes the 
value of SO2 and NOX control for those 
consumers experiencing energy savings. 
The economic cost savings associated 
with SO2 and NOX emissions caps is 
approximately equal to the change in 
the price of traded allowances resulting 
from energy savings multiplied by the 
number of allowances that would be 
issued each year. That calculation is 
uncertain because the energy savings 
from new or amended standards for 
CCWs would be so small relative to the 
entire electricity generation market that 
the resulting emissions savings would 
have almost no impact on price 
formation in the allowances market.

These savings would most likely be 
outweighed by uncertainties in the 
marginal costs of compliance with SO2 
and NOX emissions caps. 

As reported above in section III.D.4.a, 

the Joint Comment stated that to 
realistically depict energy prices in the 
future, DOE must consider the impact of 
carbon control legislation, since such 
legislation is very likely. The Joint 
Comment also noted that there are 
regional cap and trade programs that are 
in effect in the Northeast (Regional 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)) and 
the West (Western Climate Initiative 
(WCI)) that will impact the price of 
electricity and are not reflected in the 
AEO energy price forecasts. (Joint 
Comment, No. 44 at p. 12) EJ stated that 
caps will likely be in place by the time 
new standards become effective, so DOE 
should increase its electricity prices to 
reflect the cost of complying with 
emission caps. (EJ, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 105–106) 

In response, DOE incorporated 
current trends in its analysis, but 
expressly did not include possible 
future legislation in this rulemaking. 
The current NEMS–BT model used in 
projecting the environmental impacts 
includes the CAIR rule, as described 
above, which is projected to reduce SO2 
and NOX emissions. NEMS–BT also 
takes into account the current set of 
State-level renewable portfolio 
standards, the effect of the RGGI, and 
utility investor reactions to the 
possibility of future CO2 cap and trade 
programs, all of which impact electricity 
prices and reduce the projected carbon 
intensity of generation. The most recent 
Reference Case, AEO 2009, is available 
at http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ 
servicerpt/stimulus/index.html, and 
documentation of the AEO 2009 
assumptions is available at http:// 
www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/assumption/ 
index.html. 

In its October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

conducted a separate analysis of 
wastewater discharge impacts as part of 
the environmental assessment for 
commercial clothes washers. 73 FR 
62034, 62112–3 (Oct. 17, 2008). For 
today’s supplemental proposed rule, 
DOE retained the same analysis method 
for estimating wastewater discharge 
impacts. The results are presented 
below in section V.B.6. 

DOE seeks comment on the 

determination of environmental 
impacts. This is identified as Issue 6 in 
section VII.E of today’s supplemental 
notice (Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment). 

IV. Discussion of Other Comments 
A. Proposed TSLs for Commercial 
Clothes Washers 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
based the TSLs on efficiency levels 
explored in the November 2007 ANOPR, 
and selected the TSLs on consideration 
of economic factors and current market 
conditions. ASAP suggested that DOE 
set TSLs based upon industry 
benchmarks such as current and 
forthcoming ENERGY STAR 
qualification levels and pending Federal 
tax incentive performance levels. 
(ASAP, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at p. 33 and pp. 148–149) EIEA 
2008 provided an Energy Efficient 
Appliance Credit to manufacturers for 
any RCW or CCW (front-loading or top- 
loading) produced domestically through 
2010 with an efficiency level of at least 
2.0 MEF/6.0 WF, or a larger credit for 
one that achieves 2.2 MEF/4.5 WF. The 
legislation also provides a separate tax 
credit for any top-loading RCW that 
achieves an efficiency level of at least 
1.72 MEF/8.0 WF or a larger credit for 
one that exceeds 1.8 MEF/7.5 WF. DOE 
considered the impacts of these tax 
credits on the CCW industry in detail as 
part of the MIA. DOE accounts for the 
Federal tax credit as a direct cash 
benefit in the base and standards cases 
that increases the INPV. See section 
III.G of today’s supplemental notice and 
appendix 13C of the SNOPR TSD for 
further discussion of this issue. 
B. Proposed Standards for Commercial 
Clothes Washers 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 
made the preliminary determination 
that the standards for top-loading and 
front-loading CCWs listed in Table II.1 
are technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and invited 
comment on these proposed standard 
levels. 

In response, Alliance stated that it 
would likely exit the clothes washer 
market if standards based on a single 
CCW equipment class were enacted, 
which would result in domestic job 
losses, a CCW market disruption, 
and/or loss of competition in the CCW 
market. (Alliance, No. 45 at Attachment 
2, pp. 6–12) Alliance and GE urged DOE 
to consider TSL 1 from the October 2008 
NOPR (1.42 MEF/9.5 WF) as the 
appropriate standard for top-loading 
CCWs. (Alliance, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 23–24; GE 
No. 48 at p. 5) Alliance believes that 
TSL 1 would result in energy savings 
while being technically feasible and 
economically justified. Alliance also 
stated standards at TSL 1 would avoid 
or lessen harm to Alliance and, hence,

loading CCWs using spray rinse 
technology to meet the standard; and 
durability and resistance to breakage 
under overloading conditions. 
(Whirlpool, No. 50 at p. 3) 

PG&E and EJ stated that adopting a 

reduce significant consumer impacts 
that would be associated with Alliance 
likely ceasing production. (Alliance, No. 
45 at Attachment 2, p. 18) 

GE opposed the top-loading standard 

proposed in the October 2008 NOPR 
due to small market size (1.3 percent) 
for coin-operated, top-loading CCWs 
and the potential 31-percent decrease in 
industry cash flows due to the proposed 
standards. GE commented that adoption 
of the standards would essentially 
regulate the top-loading equipment class 
out of the marketplace. GE also stated 
that the max-tech level for top-loading 
CCWs is not yet justified as being 
sustainable in the harsher consumer 
environment of laundromats, where 
units are subject to much tougher 
conditions such as overloading. GE 
agreed with Alliance’s proposed 
standards for top-loaders of TSL 1 from 
the October 2008 NOPR (1.42 MEF/9.5 
WF), which would also make the CCW 
WF consistent with the EISA 2007 
standards for RCWs. (GE, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 31– 
32; GE, No. 48 at pp. 4–5) MLA opposed 
the proposed October 2008 NOPR 
standard for top-loading CCWs, because 
there is currently no commercially 
acceptable top-loading CCW that can 
meet it. MLA believes the only way to 
comply with the top-loading CCW 
standard proposed in the October 2008 
NOPR is to produce machines with poor 
washing and rinsing performance, high 
maintenance costs, and increased 
manufacturing costs. (MLA, No. 49 at 
pp.1 and 4) 

Whirlpool commented that it supports 

both the proposed top-loading and 
front-loading standards in the October 
2008 NOPR, though it acknowledged 
industry support is not consistent. Both 
standards, it said, are technologically 
feasible and enable substantial water 
and energy savings, although it agreed 
with DOE that front-loading CCWs can 
reach efficiency levels generally not 
attainable by top-loaders. Whirlpool 
stated that it has yet to field a top- 
loading CCW that can meet the 
proposed October 2008 NOPR standard, 
but that it believes technology exists to 
develop such equipment by early 2012 
without violating intellectual property, 
provided that engineering and capital 
resources are available. (Whirlpool, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 
28; Whirlpool, No. 50 at pp. 2–3) 
Whirlpool identified risks associated 
with the standards proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR, including higher 
unit, capital, and development costs; 
lower reliability or perceived reliability 
due to the complexity of the technology 
needed to meet the standard; lack of 
market acceptance for lid locks on top-

approach and results for proposed 
standard levels for today’s SNOPR in 
section V. 
V. Analytical Results 
A. Trial Standard Levels 

DOE analyzed the benefits and 

burdens of a number of TSLs for the 
CCWs that are the subject of today’s 
supplemental proposed rule. As 
discussed in section IV.A, for the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE based the 
TSLs on efficiency levels explored in 
the November 2007 ANOPR, and 
selected the TSLs on consideration of 
economic factors and current market 
conditions. As also discussed 
previously in section III.C.1.a, DOE 
eliminated the maximum 
technologically efficiency level of 1.76 
MEF/8.3 WF for the top-loading 
equipment class. Accordingly, for 
today’s supplemental proposed rule, 
DOE modified the TSLs it considered 
for the October 2008 NOPR. 

Table V.1 shows the TSLs for CCWs. 
TSLs consist of a combination of MEF 
and WF for each equipment class. In all, 
DOE has considered five TSLs. TSL 1 
corresponds to the first candidate 
standard level from each equipment 
class and represents the efficiency level 
for each class with the least significant 
design change. TSL 2 represents the 
second candidate standard level for 
front-loading washers while keeping 
top-loading washers at its first candidate 
standard level. Over 96 percent of the 
front-loading CCW equipment Stock 
Keeping Units (SKUs) currently on the 
market either meets or exceeds the 
second candidate standard level for 
front-loading washers. In the case of the 
second candidate standard level for top- 
loading washers, a significant percent of 
the market, over 35 percent, also meets 
or exceeds this efficiency level. 
Therefore, TSL 2 corresponds to the 
candidate standard levels for each 
equipment class that still represent a 
significant share of the market. TSL 3 
represents the second candidate 
standard level for top-loading washers 
(the maximum efficiency level for this 
class), and keeps front-loading washers 
at the second candidate standard level. 
For TSL 3, front-loading washers were 
held to the second candidate standard 
level in order to minimize the 
equipment price difference between the 
two equipment classes. For TSL 4, top- 
loading washers are retained at their 
maximum efficiency level while front- 
loading washers are incremented to 
their third candidate standard level. 
Finally, TSL 5 corresponds to the 
maximum technologically feasible level 
for each equipment class. In progressing 

single standard for all CCW classes 
would result in the largest potential 
savings for consumers. (EJ, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at p. 200; 
PG&E, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
40.5 at p. 201) The Joint Comment 
suggested that a single standard based 
on efficiency achieved by front loaders 
available in the market today would 
achieve 32 percent more energy savings, 
192 percent more water savings, and 78 
percent more consumer savings in 
present value terms than the standards 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR 
that treat top-loading and front-loading 
CCWs separately. (Joint Comment, No. 
44 at p. 1) 

ASAP commented that the previous 

analyses leading up to the October 2008 
NOPR [the analyses in the November 
2007 ANOPR] clearly indicated that 
there are tremendous life-cycle cost 
savings presented by high-efficiency 
CCWs, and those are available to all 
sectors of the market. ASAP believes 
that, for what appears to be a lack of a 
relatively small amount of capital, 
recognizing that amount of capital is 
significant for one manufacturer, 
hundreds of millions of dollars of 
consumer savings are going to be 
foregone. ASAP also commented that 
DOE did not substantiate its concerns 
about potential recapture of market 
share by less efficient top-loaders when 
reducing the proposed standard for 
front-loading CCWs from the level that 
would maximize life-cycle cost savings 
to the standards proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR. (ASAP, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 40.5 at pp. 34– 
35) 

In considering standards for today’s 
supplemental notice, DOE first notes 
that it has retained separate equipment 
classes for top-loading and front-loading 
CCWs, for reasons discussed in section 
III.A. For top-loading CCW standards, 
DOE has revised its analysis due to a re- 
evaluation of the max-tech efficiency 
level, which resulted in the max-tech 
level from the October 2008 NOPR being 
eliminated from consideration as an 
efficiency level for today’s supplemental 
notice (see section III.C.1.a.) DOE did 
not change the engineering analysis for 
front-loading CCWs from those 
presented in the October 2008 NOPR. 
DOE has thus evaluated standards for 
both equipment classes, including 
impacts to the consumer, manufacturer, 
and Nation, based on the analyses 
outlined in section III, and presents the

B. Economic Justification and Energy 
Savings 
1. Economic Impacts on Consumers 
a. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 

To evaluate the net economic impact 

of standards on consumers, DOE 
conducted LCC and PBP analyses for 
each TSL. In general, higher efficiency 
equipment would affect consumers in 
two ways: (1) Annual operating expense 
would decrease; and (2) purchase price 
would increase. Section III.D of this 
notice discusses the inputs DOE used 
for calculating the LCC and PBP. 

The key outputs of the LCC analysis 
are a mean LCC savings relative to the 
baseline equipment design, as well as a 
probability distribution or likelihood of 
LCC reduction or increase, for each TSL 
and equipment class. The LCC analysis 

also estimates the fraction of consumers 
for which the LCC will decrease (net 
benefit), increase (net cost), or exhibit 
no change (no impact) relative to the 
base-case equipment forecast. No 
impacts occur when the equipment 
efficiencies of the base-case forecast 
already equal or exceed the considered 
TSL efficiency. 

Table V.2 and Table V.3 show the 
LCC and PBP results for both CCW 
equipment applications for the top- 
loading class while Table V.4 and Table 
V.5 show the LCC and PPB results for 
the front-loading equipment class. For 
example, in the case of the multi-family 
application for front-loading washers 
(Table V.4), TSL 2 (2.00 MEF/5.50 WF) 
shows an average LCC savings of $19. 
Note that for TSL 2, 96.3 percent of 
consumers in 2013 are assumed to 
already be using a front-loading CCW in 

the base case at TSL 2 and, thus, have 
zero savings due to the standard. If one 
compares the LCC of the baseline at 1.72 
MEF/8.00 WF ($4220) to TSL 2 ($3690), 
then the difference in the LCCs is $530. 
However, since the base case includes a 
significant number of consumers that 
are not impacted by the standard, the 
average savings over all of the 
consumers is actually $19, not $530. 
DOE determined the median and 
average values of the PBPs shown below 
by excluding the percentage of 
households not impacted by the 
standard. For example, in the case of 
TSL 2 for front-loading washers in a 
multi-family application, 96.3 percent of 
the consumers did not factor into the 
calculation of the median and average 
PBP.

b. Consumer Subgroup Analysis 

Using the LCC spreadsheet model, 

DOE determined the impact of the 
standards on the following CCW 
consumer subgroups: small business 
owners and consumers without 
municipal water and sewer. 

The results for consumers without 

municipal water and sewer indicate that 
the LCC impacts and payback periods 
for this subgroup are similar to the LCC 
impacts and payback periods on the full 
sample of CCW consumers. But for 
small business owners, the LCC impacts 
and payback periods are different from 
those associated with the general 
population. For the top-loading 
equipment class, Table V.6 and Table 

V.7 show the LCC impacts and payback 
periods for small multi-family property 
owners and small laundromats, 
respectively, while Table V.8 and Table 
V.9 show the same but for the front- 
loading equipment class. For all TSLs 
for both equipment classes, both sets of 
small business owners, on average, 
realize LCC savings similar to the 
general population. The difference 
between the small business population 
and the general population occurs in the 
percentage of each population that 
realizes LCC savings from standards. 
With the exception of TSL 1 for top- 
loading washers, an overwhelming 
majority of the small business and 
general populations benefit from 
standards at each TSL. But for both 

equipment classes, a larger percentage 
of the general population benefits from 
standards than small business owners. 
This occurs because small businesses do 
not have the same access to capital as 
larger businesses. As a result, smaller 
businesses have a higher average 
discount rate than the industry average. 
Because of the higher discount rates, 
smaller businesses do not value future 
operating costs savings from more 
efficient CCWs as much as the general 
population. But to emphasize, in spite 
of the higher discount rates, a majority 
of small businesses still benefit from 
higher CCW standards at all TSLs, with 
the exception of TSL 1 for the top- 
loading equipment class.

c. Rebuttable-Presumption Payback 

As discussed above, EPCA establishes 
a rebuttable presumption that an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified if the increased purchase cost 
for equipment that meets the standard is 

less than three times the value of the 
first-year energy savings resulting from 
the standard. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) DOE calculated a 
rebuttable-presumption payback period 
for each TSL to determine whether DOE 
could presume that a standard at that 
level is economically justified. Table 

V.10 shows the rebuttable-presumption 
payback periods for CCWs. Because 
only a single, average value is necessary 
for establishing the rebuttable- 
presumption payback period, rather 
than using distributions for input 
values, DOE used discrete values. As 
required by EPCA, DOE based the

calculation on the assumptions in the 
DOE test procedures for CCWs. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) As a result, 

DOE calculated a single rebuttable- 
presumption payback value, and not a 

distribution of payback periods, for each 
TSL.

market responses. Each scenario results 
in a unique set of cash flows and 
corresponding industry value at each 
TSL. These steps allowed DOE to 
compare the potential impacts on the 
industry as a function of TSLs in the 
GRIM. The difference in INPV between 
the base case and the standards case is 
an estimate of the economic impacts 
that implementing that standard level 
would have on the entire industry. For 
today’s supplemental notice, DOE 
continues to use the above methodology 
and presents the results in the 
subsequent sections. See chapter 13 for 
additional information on MIA 
methodology and results. 
a. Industry Cash-Flow Analysis Results 

The major source of uncertainty 

voiced by all manufacturers during MIA 
interviews is the impact of higher 
standards on the number of CCWs sold. 
Future equipment sales are particularly 
important considering the high capital 
costs (particularly design, tooling, and 
product verification costs) on the basis 
of the low volumes of equipment sold. 
In light of the concern over future 
shipments, DOE modeled two MIA 
scenarios, based on two shipment 
projections from the NIA. 

To assess the lower end of the range 

of the potential impacts on the CCW 
industry, DOE considered a scenario in 
which total CCW shipments will not be 
negatively impacted at higher energy 
conservation standards; this scenario is 
called the base-case shipments scenario. 
To assess the higher end of the range of 
potential impacts for the CCW industry, 
DOE considered a scenario in which 

With the exception of TSLs 1 to 3 for 
front-loading CCWs, the TSLs in Table 
V.10 do not have rebuttable- 
presumption payback periods of less 
than 3 years. As stated above, in 
addition to calculating the rebuttable- 
presumption payback period DOE 
routinely conducts a thorough economic 
analysis that considers the full range of 
impacts, including those to consumers, 
manufacturers, the Nation, and the 
environment, as required under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i). The results of 
this full analysis serve as the basis for 
DOE to definitively determine the 
economic justification for a potential 
standard level (thereby supporting or 
rebutting the results of any preliminary 
determination of economic 
justification). Section V.C provides a 
complete discussion of how DOE 
considered the range of impacts to select 
the standards proposed in today’s 
SNOPR. 
2. Economic Impacts on Manufacturers 

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

used the INPV in the MIA to compare 
the financial impacts of different TSLs 
on CCW manufacturers. 73 FR 62034, 
62099–104 (Oct. 17, 2008). The INPV is 
the sum of all net cash flows discounted 
by the industry’s cost of capital 
(discount rate). DOE used the GRIM to 
compare the INPV of the base case (no 
new energy conservation standards) to 
that of each TSL for the CCW industry. 
To evaluate the range of cash-flow 
impacts on the CCW industry, DOE 
constructed different scenarios using 
different assumptions for shipments that 
correspond to the range of anticipated

total industry shipments would 
decrease due to the combined effects of 
increases in purchase price and 
decreases in operating costs due to new 
energy conservation standards; this 
scenario is called the price elasticity of 
demand scenario. In both scenarios, it is 
assumed that manufacturers will be able 
maintain the same gross margins (as a 
percentage of revenues) that are 
currently obtained in the base case. 

As discussed in section III.G of 

today’s supplemental notice, DOE also 
considered the impact of Federal 
production tax credits on the CCW 
industry. DOE does not include the 
benefit of these tax credits in its results 
shown below. DOE includes these 
results in appendix 13C of the TSD. 
DOE estimated that the total benefit of 
these Federal production tax credits to 
the CCW industry from 2007 through 
2010 would be approximately $4.1 
million. Because DOE discounts the 
industry cash flows to the 2009 base 
year, in this scenario the base case INPV 
increases by approximately $400,000 if 
the benefit from the Federal production 
tax credits are included. As previously 
stated, although the base-case and 
standards-case INPV increase as a result 
of Federal production tax credits, the 
benefits do not significantly mitigate 
possible impacts due to standards. For 
additional information on the 
assumptions and calculations of Federal 
production tax credits for CCWs, see 
appendix 13C of the TSD. 

Table V.11 and Table V.12 show the 

MIA results for each TSL using both 
shipment scenarios described above for 
CCW manufacturers.

At TSL 1, the impact on INPV and 

cash flow varies depending on the 
manufacturers’ ability to maintain 
revenues as shipments decrease due to 
the price elasticity. DOE estimated the 
impacts in INPV at TSL 1 to range from 
positive $3.7 million to positive $2.8 
million, or a change in INPV of 5.97 
percent to 4.50 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow does not decrease 
from the base-case value of $3.8 million 
in the year leading up to the standards. 
Since all manufacturers currently make 
or source top-loading and front-loading 
CCWs with efficiency levels above this 
level, DOE assumed that there would be 
no equipment or capital conversion 
costs. 

At TSL 2, DOE estimated the impacts 

in INPV to range from positive $1.4 
million to positive $0.5 million, or a 
change in INPV of 2.24 percent to 0.76 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow decreases by approximately 27.7 
percent, to $2.8 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $3.8 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
Since all manufacturers of top-loading 
washers already sell equipment that 
exceeds the efficiency requirements 
proposed at this TSL, DOE assumed that 
there would be no equipment or capital 
conversion costs for top-loading 

washers at this TSL. Over 95 percent of 
all currently-sold front-loading CCW 
SKUs have efficiency levels that achieve 
or exceed this level and all 
manufacturers sell front-loading 
washers that achieve or exceed this 
level. Accordingly, DOE estimated that 
the industry would incur relatively 
small equipment and capital conversion 
costs at this TSL. 

At TSL 3, DOE estimated the impacts 
in INPV to range from ¥$4.8 million to 
¥$7.0 million, or a change in INPV of 
¥7.81 percent to ¥11.39 percent. At 
this level, the industry cash flow 
decreases by approximately 158 percent, 
to ¥$2.2 million, compared to the base 
case value of $3.8 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. Only one 
manufacturer currently markets a single 
top-loading CCW SKU at this TSL. DOE 
estimates that at least one manufacturer 
will need to redesign and retool a line 
of top-loading CCWs to meet the 
efficiency requirements of TSL 3. For 
top-loading CCWs, multiple 
manufacturers stated that customers 
could see a reduction in wash quality or 
reject new designs based on a perceived 
reduction in wash quality or rinse 
performance at TSL 3. Over 95 percent 
of currently-sold front-loading CCW 
SKUs have efficiency ratings that meet 

or exceed this level. Hence, DOE 
estimated relatively small equipment 
and capital conversion costs for these 
washers. 

At TSL 4, DOE estimated the impacts 

in INPV at TSL 4 to range from ¥$7.8 
million to ¥$10.2 million, or a change 
in INPV of ¥12.73 percent to ¥16.57 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow decreases by approximately 206 
percent, to ¥$4.1 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $3.8 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. As 
with TSL 3, the top-loading standard 
remains at max-tech at TSL 4, and the 
impacts previously stated for this 
equipment class remain. Currently, 77 
percent of front-loading washers 
shipped do not meet TSL 4, resulting in 
multiple manufacturers having to 
redesign existing front-loading 
equipment to conform cost-effectively to 
the standard. The $8.4 million in 
equipment and capital conversion costs 
estimated for this TSL to redesign and 
retool for the front-loading standard, 
while not appearing substantial on a 
nominal basis, are significant for 
manufacturers due to low volumes of 
front-loading washers. Adjusting for 
shipment volumes, investing $8.4 
million in front-loading washers is 
equivalent to investing over $18.5

million in top-loading washers. These 
investment costs are also high compared 
to the industry value of $29 million for 
front-loading washers. Consequently, it 
could be difficult for manufacturers to 
justify the investments necessary to 
reach TSL 4 for front-loading washers. 
At TSL 5, DOE estimated the impacts 

in INPV to range from ¥$20.4 million 
to ¥$23.0 million, or a change in INPV 
of ¥33.09 percent to ¥37.30 percent. 
At this level, the industry cash flow 
decreases by approximately 371 percent, 
to ¥$10.3 million, compared to the 
base-case value of $3.8 million in the 
year leading up to the standards. The 
top-loading standard remains at max- 
tech at TSL 5. DOE estimates for TSL 5 
that manufacturers would have to invest 
$24.4 million in front-loading washer in 
an industry valued at $29 million. It 
likely would be difficult for 
manufacturers to justify the investments 
necessary to reach max-tech for both 
top-loading and front-loading washers. 
b. Impacts on Employment 

To quantitatively assess the impacts 

of energy conservation standards on 
CCW manufacturing employment, DOE 
used the GRIM to estimate the domestic 
labor expenditures and number of 
employees in the base case and at each 
TSL from 2009 through 2043 for the 
CCW industry. DOE used statistical data 
from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2006 
Annual Survey of Manufactures 36 (2006 

ASM) and 2006 Current Industry 
Report 37 (2006 CIR), the results of the 
engineering analysis, and interviews 
with manufacturers to estimate the 
inputs necessary to calculate industry- 
wide labor expenditures and domestic 
employment levels. Labor expenditures 
are a function of the labor intensity of 
the equipment, the sales volume, and an 
implicit assumption that wages remain 
fixed in real terms over time. DOE notes 
that the MIA’s analysis detailing 
impacts on employment focuses 
specifically on the production workers 
manufacturing the covered products or 
equipment, rather than a manufacturer’s 
broader operations. Thus, the estimated 
number of impacted employees in the 
MIA is separate and distinct from the 
total number of employees used to 
determine whether a manufacturer is a 
small business for purposes of analysis 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

The estimates of production workers 
in this section only cover workers up to 
and including the line-supervisor level 
that are directly involved in fabricating 
and assembling equipment within the 
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
facility. In addition, workers that 
perform services that are closely 
associated with production operations 
are included. Employees above the 
working-supervisor level are excluded 
from the count of production workers. 
Thus, the labor associated with non- 
production functions (e.g., 

advertisement, sales) is explicitly not 
covered.38 In addition, DOE’s estimates 
only account for production workers 
that manufacture the specific equipment 
covered by this rulemaking. For 
example, a worker on a clothes dryer 
production line would not be included 
in the estimate of the number of CCW 
production workers. Finally, this 
analysis also does not factor in the 
dependence by some manufacturers on 
production volume to make their 
operations viable. For example, should 
a major line of business cease to operate 
or move to a geographic region, a 
production facility may no longer have 
the manufacturing scale to obtain 
volume discounts on its purchases nor 
be able to justify maintaining major 
capital equipment. Thus, the impact on 
a manufacturing facility due to a line 
closure may affect more employees than 
just the production workers, but again 
this analysis focuses on the production 
workers directly impacted. 

Using the GRIM, DOE calculates that 
there are 188 U.S. production workers 
in the CCW industry. Using the CIR 
data, DOE estimates that approximately 
81 percent of CCWs sold in the United 
States are manufactured domestically. 
Today’s supplemental notice estimates 
the impacts on U.S. production workers 
in the CCW industry impacted by 
energy conservation standards as shown 
in Table V.13.

DOE expects that there would be 

positive employment impacts among 
domestic CCW manufacturers for TSL 1 
through TSL 5. Because production 
employment expenditures are assumed 
to be a fixed percentage of COGS and 
the MPCs increase with more efficient 
equipment, labor tracks the increased 
prices in the GRIM. The GRIM predicts 
a steady level of domestic employment 
after standards at a level based on the 
increase in relative price. 

DOE reached this conclusion 

independent of the employment impacts 
from the broader U.S. economy, which 

are documented in chapter 15 of the 
TSD accompanying this notice. The 
employment conclusions do not account 
for the possible relocation of domestic 
jobs to lower-labor-cost countries 
because the potential relocation of U.S. 
jobs is uncertain and highly speculative. 
The GRIM shows the employment levels 
rising at higher TSLs. If all standards- 
compliant CCWs are produced in the 
United States, the employment levels 
would be expected to be reasonably 
accurate, as more efficient washers are 
more complex and require more labor. 

The actual impacts on domestic 

employment after standards depend on 
whether any U.S. manufacturer decided 
to shift more U.S. production to lower- 
cost countries. Due to the uncertainty in 
the business decisions of where to 
manufacture washers after standards, 
DOE presents a range of potential 
employment impacts if the potential for 
relocation is considered. Today’s 
proposed standards could result in 
adding 33 production workers (if all 
manufacturers continue to produce 
washers in their existing U.S. facilities) 
to losing 188 production workers (if all

packing, warehousing, shipping (but not 
delivering), maintenance, repair, janitorial and 

guard services, product development, auxiliary 
production for plant’s own use (e.g., power plant), 
recordkeeping, and other services closely associated 
with these production operations at the 
establishment covered by the report. Employees 
above the working-supervisor level are excluded 
from this item.’’

U.S. manufacturers source or shift 
standards-compliant washers 
production abroad). 

Based on the CCW revenues reported 

in appendix 13A and using the 
employment assumptions in section 
III.H, DOE estimates there are 
approximately 150 production workers 
at the LVM manufacturing equipment 
directly covered by this rulemaking. 
DOE estimates that there are an 
additional 20 non-production 
employees attributable to CCWs at the 
facility. The domestic facility also 
manufactures residential top-loading 
washers, standard dryers, front-loading 
residential washers, washer-extractors, 
and tumbler dryers. If the LVM decided 
to no longer produce any soft-mount 
washers or standard dryers at the 
facility because it could not sell dryers 
without selling washers, approximately 
292 production and 40 non-production 
jobs would be lost. Including all 
production workers involved in covered 
and non-covered equipment, the closure 
of the LVM domestic manufacturing 
plant would equate to a loss of 
approximately 600 factory employees. 
A further discussion of the LVM and 

the potential impacts of relocation on 
employment for the CCW industry at 
other TSLs are presented in chapter 13 
of the TSD. 
c. Impacts on Manufacturing Capacity 

According to the majority of CCW 

manufacturers, new energy conservation 
standards could potentially impact 
manufacturers’ production capacity 
depending on the efficiency level 
required. Necessary redesigns of front- 
loading and top-loading CCWs will not 
change the fundamental assembly of the 
equipment or cause a drastic increase in 
the volume requirements of front- 
loading washers. Thus, DOE believes 
manufacturers will be able to maintain 
manufacturing capacity levels and 
continue to meet market demand under 
new energy conservation standards as 
long as manufacturers continue to offer 
top-loading and front-loading washers. 

However, a very high efficiency 

standard for top-loading clothes washers 
could potentially cause one or more 
manufacturer(s) to abandon further 
manufacture of top-loading clothes 
washers after the effective date (due to 
concerns about wash quality, for 
example). Instead of manufacturing top- 
loading clothes washers, manufacturers 
could elect to switch their entire 
production over to front-loading clothes 
washers. Since top-loading and front- 
loading clothes washers share few, if 
any parts, are built on completely 
separate assembly lines, and are built at 
very different production volumes, a 

manufacturer may not be able to make 
a platform switch from top-loading to 
front-loading washers without 
significant impacts on equipment 
development and capital expenses, 
along with capacity constraints. 
However, DOE believes that the energy 
conservation standard proposed in 
today’s supplemental notice for top- 
loading CCWs mitigates much of that 
risk. 

Multiple manufacturers stated during 

interviews that front-loading CCWs 
represent a relatively small segment of 
their total production volumes. 
Depending on the manufacturer, front- 
loading production capacity may need 
to be substantially expanded to meet the 
demand that top-loading production 
lines currently meet. This expansion 
could possibly affect capacity until new 
production lines come on-line to service 
demand. In addition, manufacturers 
stated that the higher prices of front- 
loading washers could lead to a 
decrease in shipments. This could lead 
to a permanently lower production 
capacity as machines are repaired and 
the equipment lifetime of existing 
washers is extended. DOE research 
suggests that the proposed efficiency 
standards can be achieved by all 
manufacturers using existing platforms 
and technologies; hence, there appears 
little reason for the market to wholly 
transition to front-loading CCWs. 
d. Impacts on Subgroups of 
Manufacturers 

Using average cost assumptions to 

develop an industry cash flow estimate 
is not adequate for assessing differential 
impacts among subgroups of 
manufacturers. Lower-volume 
manufacturers, niche players, or 
manufacturers exhibiting a cost 
structure that differs significantly from 
the industry average could be affected 
differently than their competitors. DOE 
used the results of the industry 
characterization to group manufacturers 
exhibiting similar characteristics. 
As outlined earlier, an LVM that 

concentrates on building laundry 
equipment will be affected 
disproportionately by any energy 
efficiency regulation regarding CCWs. 
This business is focused on the 
commercial laundry market segment 
and its total production volume is many 
times lower than its diversified 
competitors. Due to this combination of 
market concentration and size, it is at 
risk of material harm to its business, 
depending on the TSL chosen. 

The LVM indicated that it could not 
manufacture top-loading CCWs above 
an MEF of 1.42 (TSL 1). If DOE sets a 
standard above TSL 1, the LVM would 

be forced to design a new top-loading 
washer, offer only front-loading 
washers, or choose to exit the CCW 
market altogether. Due to its small size, 
the investment required for the LVM to 
design a more efficient top-loading 
washer would put the company at a 
competitive disadvantage. If the LVM no 
longer were to offer a top-loading 
washer and would have to expand its 
front-loading production lines, it would 
likely cease CCW production altogether, 
resulting in significant impacts to the 
industry. Currently, the LVM’s top- 
loading washers account for 70 percent 
of its CCW shipments. Shifting all top- 
loading CCWs to front-loading washers 
at current production volumes would 
require substantial investments that the 
company may not be able to justify. In 
addition, the LVM historically derived 
over 85 percent of its total clothes 
washer revenue from CCWs, so its sales 
in the RCW market would be too low to 
justify continuing any top-loading 
clothes washer manufacturing. While 
the LVM currently manufactures a front- 
loading clothes washer, it does so at a 
cost disadvantage compared to its 
competitors. The potential investment 
and risk required to develop a cost- 
competitive clothes washer that deviates 
significantly from its traditional top- 
loader agitator design could be too great 
for the LVM’s current owners. The LVM 
could decide to exit the market rather 
than take this risk, which could cause 
employment impacts in the CCW 
industry. As stated in section III.G, DOE 
reevaluated the CCW energy 
conservation standards proposed in the 
October 2008 NOPR in response to 
comments received from interested 
parties. DOE believes that the energy 
conservation standards proposed in 
today’ supplemental notice greatly 
lessens the potential disadvantages 
faced by the LVM. Further details of the 
separate analysis of the impacts on the 
LVM are found in chapter 13 of the TSD 
accompanying this supplemental notice. 
3. National Impact Analysis 
a. Significance of Energy Savings 
To estimate the energy savings 

through 2043 that would be expected to 
result from amended energy 
conservation standards, DOE compared 
the energy consumption of equipment 
under the base case to energy 
consumption of this equipment under 
the TSLs. Table V.14 shows the 
forecasted national energy savings at 
each TSL for CCWs. Summing the 
energy savings for all equipment classes 
across each TSL considered in this 
rulemaking would result in significant 
energy and water savings, with the

amount of savings increasing with

of the TSD accompanying this 
supplemental notice provides additional 
details on the NES values reported 

below, as well as discounted NES 
results (and discounted national water 
savings results) based on discount rates 
of 3 and 7 percent. DOE reports both 
undiscounted and discounted values of 

energy savings. Discounted energy 
savings represent a policy perspective 
wherein energy savings farther in the 
future are less significant than energy 
savings closer to the present.39

b. Net Present Value 

The NPV analysis is a measure of the 

cumulative benefit or cost of energy 
conservation standards to the Nation. In 
accordance with the OMB’s guidelines 
on regulatory analysis (OMB Circular 
A–4, section E, Sept. 17, 2003), DOE 
calculated NPV using both a 7-percent 
and a 3-percent real discount rate. The 
7-percent rate is an estimate of the 
average before-tax rate of return on 
private capital in the U.S. economy, and 

reflects the returns on real estate and 
small business capital as well as 
corporate capital. DOE used this 
discount rate to approximate the 
opportunity cost of capital in the private 
sector, since recent OMB analysis has 
found the average rate of return to 
capital to be near this rate. DOE also 
used the 3-percent rate to capture the 
potential effects of standards on private 
consumption (e.g., through higher prices 
for equipment and the purchase of 

reduced amounts of energy). This rate 
represents the rate at which society 
discounts future consumption flows to 
their present value. This rate can be 
approximated by the real rate of return 
on long-term government debt (i.e., 
yield on Treasury notes minus annual 
rate of change in the Consumer Price 
Index), which has averaged about 3 
percent on a pre-tax basis for the last 30 
years. Table V.15 shows the forecasted 
NPV at each TSL for CCWs.

c. Impacts on Employment 
In addition to considering the direct 

employment impacts for the 
manufacturers of equipment covered by 
this rulemaking (discussed above), DOE 
develops estimates of the indirect 
employment impacts of proposed 
standards in the economy in general. As 
noted previously, DOE expects energy 
conservation standards for equipment 
subject of this rulemaking to reduce 
energy bills for consumers, with the 
resulting net savings being redirected to 
other forms of economic activity. DOE 

also realizes that these shifts in 
spending and economic activity could 
affect the demand for labor. To estimate 
these effects, DOE used an input/output 
model of the U.S. economy using BLS 
data (described in section III.H). (See the 
TSD accompanying this supplemental 
notice, chapter 15.) 

of the jobs. As Table V.16 shows, DOE 
estimates that net indirect employment 
impacts from today’s proposed 
standards are likely to be small. The net 
increase in jobs is so small that it would 
be imperceptible in national labor 
statistics and might be offset by other, 
unanticipated effects on employment. 

This input/output model suggests 

today’s proposed standards are likely to 
slightly increase the net demand for 
labor in the economy. Neither the BLS 
data nor the input/output model DOE 
uses includes the quality or wage level 

39 Consistent with Executive Order 12866, 

‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review,’’ 58 FR 51735 
(Oct. 4, 1993), DOE follows the guidance of OMB 

regarding methodologies and procedures for 
regulatory impact analysis that affect more than one 
agency. In reporting energy and environmental 

benefits from energy conservation standards, DOE 
will report both discounted and undiscounted (i.e., 
zero discount-rate) values.

4. Impact on Utility or Performance of 
Equipment 

For the reasons stated above in 

section II.G.1.d, DOE believes that for 
purposes of 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV), none of the 
efficiency levels considered in this 
notice reduces the utility or 
performance of equipment under 
consideration in this rulemaking. 
5. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 

In weighing the promulgation of any 
proposed standards, DOE is required to 
consider any lessening of competition 
that is likely to result from the adoption 
of those standards. The determination of 
the likely competitive impacts 
stemming from a proposed standard is 
made by the Attorney General, who 

transmits this determination, along with 
an analysis of the nature and extent of 
the impact, to the Secretary of Energy. 
(See 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 
(B)(ii).) 

DOE carefully considered the 

determination received from DOJ in 
response to the October 2008 NOPR, 
and accordingly chose efficiency levels 
for this SNOPR that appear achievable 
by all CCW manufacturers using 
existing equipment platforms and 
technologies. As such, there should be 
minimal impact on the CCW market and 
hence its manufacturers. To assist the 
Attorney General in making a 
determination for this SNOPR, DOE has 
provided DOJ with copies of this notice 
and the TSD for review. DOE will 
consider DOJ’s comments on today’s 
SNOPR in preparing the final rule. 

DOE notes that if, based on the public 

comments received and its further 
consideration of this issue, it were to 
establish a single equipment class in 
setting standards for CCWs, DOE 
intends to give considerable weight to 
the potential adverse effects of a single 
equipment class efficiency standard on 
competition in the CCW market. That is, 
DOE does not intend to set a standard 
that produced significant adverse 
impacts on competition in this market. 

6. Need of the Nation To Conserve 
Energy 

Improving the energy efficiency of 
CCWs, where economically justified, 
would likely improve the security of the 
Nation’s energy system by reducing 
overall demand for energy. Reduced 
electricity demand may also improve 
the reliability of the electricity system. 
As a measure of this reduced demand, 
DOE expects the energy savings from 
the adopted standards to eliminate the 
need for approximately 0.010 gigawatts 
(GW) of generating capacity by 2043. 

Enhanced energy savings from higher 

standards for CCWs also produces 
environmental benefits in the form of 
reduced emissions of air pollutants and 
greenhouse gases associated with energy 
production, and with building use of 
fossil fuels at sites where CCWs are 
used. Table V.17 provides DOE’s 
estimate of cumulative CO2, NOX, and 
Hg emissions reductions that would 
result from the TSLs considered in this 
rulemaking. The expected energy 
savings from new standards for CCWs 
may also reduce the cost of maintaining 
nationwide emissions standards and 
constraints. In the environmental 
assessment (chapter 16 of the TSD 
accompanying this supplemental 
notice), DOE reports estimated annual 
changes in CO2, NOX, and Hg emissions 
attributable to each TSL.

As discussed in section III.J of this 

supplemental notice, DOE does not 
report SO2 emissions reductions from 
power plants because reductions from 
an energy conservation standard would 
not affect the overall level of SO2 
emissions in the United States due to 
the emissions caps for SO2. 

NOX emissions from 28 eastern States 

and D.C. are limited under CAIR, 
Although CAIR has been remanded to 
EPA by the D.C. Circuit, it will remain 
in effect until it is replaced by a rule 
consistent with the Court’s December 
23, 2008, opinion in North Carolina v. 
EPA. North Carolina v. EPA, 550 F.3d 
1176 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Because all States 
covered by CAIR opted to reduce NOX 

emissions through participation in cap 
and trade programs for electric 
generating units, emissions from these 
sources are capped across the CAIR 
region. 

For the 28 eastern States and D.C. 

where CAIR is in effect, no NOX 
emissions reductions will occur due to 
the permanent cap. Under caps, 
physical emissions reductions in those 
States would not result from the energy 
conservation standards under 
consideration by DOE, but standards 
might have produced an 
environmentally related economic 
impact in the form of lower prices for 
emissions allowance credits, if large 
enough. However, DOE determined that 

in the present case, such standards 
would not produce an environmentally 
related economic impact in the form of 
lower prices for emissions allowance 
credits, because the estimated reduction 
in NOX emissions or the corresponding 
allowance credits in States covered by 
the CAIR cap would be too small to 
affect allowance prices for NOX under 
the CAIR. In contrast, new or amended 
energy conservation standards would 
reduce NOX emissions in those 22 States 
that are not affected by CAIR. As a 
result, the NEMS–BT does forecast NOX 
emissions reductions from energy 
sources in those 22 States from the CCW 
standards considered in today’s SNOPR.

Federal  Register / Vol.  74,  No.  215 / Monday,  November  9,  2009 / Proposed  Rules 

In the October 2008 NOPR, however, 

DOE provided a different estimate of 
NOX reductions because DOE assumed 
that the CAIR rule had been vacated. 
This is because the CAIR rule was 
vacated by the D.C. Circuit in its July 11, 
2008 decision in North Carolina v. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 531 
F.3d 896 (D.C. Cir. 2008). As noted 
above, the D.C. Circuit, in a December 
23, 2008, opinion, decided to allow the 
CAIR rule to remain in effect until it is 
replaced by a rule consistent with the 
court’s earlier opinion, but this decision 
came well after the publish date of the 
October 2008 NOPR..Thus, for the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE established a 
range of NOX reductions based on low 
and high emission rates (in kt of NOX 
emitted per TWh of electricity 
generated) derived from the AEO 2008. 
DOE anticipated that, in the absence of 
the CAIR’s trading program, the new or 
amended conservation standards would 
reduce NOX emissions nationwide, not 
just in 22 States. 

As noted in section III.J, DOE was able 
to estimate the changes in Hg emissions 
associated with an energy conservation 
standard as follows. DOE notes that the 
NEMS–BT model used as an integral 
part of today’s rulemaking does not 
estimate Hg emissions reductions due to 
new energy conservation standards, as it 
assumed that Hg emissions would be 
subject to EPA’s CAMR. 70 FR 28606 
(May 18, 2005). CAMR would have 
permanently capped emissions of 
mercury for new and existing coal-fired 
plants in all States by 2010. As with SO2 
and NOX, DOE assumed that under such 
a system, energy conservation standards 
would have resulted in no physical 
effect on these emissions, but might 
have resulted in an environmentally 
related economic benefit in the form of 
a lower price for emissions allowance 
credits if those credits were large 
enough. DOE estimated that the change 
in the Hg emissions from energy 
conservation standards would not be 
large enough to influence allowance 
prices under CAMR. 

On February 8, 2008, the D.C. Circuit 

issued its decision in New Jersey v. 
Environmental Protection Agency to 
vacate CAMR. 517 F.3d 574 (D.C. Cir. 
2008). In light of this development and 
because the NEMS–BT model could not 
be used to directly calculate Hg 
emissions reductions, DOE used the Hg 
emission rates discussed below to 
calculate emissions reductions in the 
October 2008 NOPR. This same 
methodology is used for today’s SNOPR 
as well due to the continued fluid 
environment ‘‘* * * with many States 
planning to enact new laws or make 
existing laws more stringent.’’ EIA AEO

2009 (March 2009), p. 18. The NEMS– 
BT has only rough estimates of Hg 
emissions, and it was felt that the range 
of emissions used in the NOPR remain 
appropriate given these circumstances. 

Therefore, rather than using the 

NEMS–BT model, DOE established a 
range of Hg rates to estimate the Hg 
emissions that could be reduced 
through standards. DOE’s low estimate 
assumed that future standards would 
displace electrical generation only from 
natural gas-fired power plants, thereby 
resulting in an effective emission rate of 
zero. (Under this scenario, coal-fired 
power plant generation would remain 
unaffected.) The low-end emission rate 
is zero because natural gas-fired power 
plants have virtually zero Hg emissions 
associated with their operation. 

DOE’s high estimate, which assumed 

that standards would displace only coal- 
fired power plants, was based on a 
nationwide Hg emission rate from AEO 
2008 for the October 2008 NOPR. 
(Under this scenario, gas-fired power 
plant generation would remain 
unaffected and that no future reductions 
in the rate of Hg emissions from such 
sources would occur.) Because power 
plant emission rates are a function of 
local regulation, scrubbers, and the Hg 
content of coal, it is extremely difficult 
to identify a precise high-end emission 
rate. Therefore, the most reasonable 
estimate is based on the assumption that 
all displaced coal generation would 
have been emitting at the average 
emission rate for coal generation as 
specified by the April update to AEO 
2009. As noted previously, because 
virtually all Hg emitted from electricity 
generation is from coal-fired power 
plants, DOE based the emission rate on 
the tons of Hg emitted per TWh of coal- 
generated electricity. Based on the 
emission rate for 2006, DOE derived a 
high-end emission rate of 0.0255 tons 
per TWh. To estimate the reduction in 
Hg emissions, DOE multiplied the 
emission rate by the reduction in coal- 
generated electricity due to the 
standards considered in the utility 
impact analysis. These changes in Hg 
emissions are extremely small, ranging 
from 0.03 to 0.27 percent of the national 
base-case emissions forecast by NEMS– 
BT, depending on the TSL. 

In the October 2008 NOPR, DOE 

proposed accounting for the monetary 
value of CO2 emission reductions 
associated with standards. DOE 
proposed to use the range $0 to $20 per 
ton for reductions in the year 2007 in 
2007$. 73 FR 62034, 62110 (Oct. 17, 
2008). These estimates were intended to 
represent the lower and upper bounds 
of the costs and benefits likely to be 
experienced in the United States. The 

lower bound was based on an 
assumption of no benefit and the upper 
bound was based on an estimate of the 
mean value of worldwide impacts due 
to climate change that was reported by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) in its ‘‘Fourth 
Assessment Report.’’ 

For today’s SNOPR, DOE is relying on 

a new set of values recently developed 
by an interagency process that 
conducted a thorough review of existing 
estimates of the social cost of carbon 
(SCC). The SCC is intended to be a 
monetary measure of the incremental 
damage resulting from greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, including, but not 
limited to, net agricultural productivity 
loss, human health effects, property 
damages from sea level rise, and 
changes in ecosystem services. Any 
effort to quantify and to monetize the 
harms associated with climate change 
will raise serious questions of science, 
economics, and ethics. But with full 
regard for the limits of both 
quantification and monetization, the 
SCC can be used to provide estimates of 
the social benefits of reductions in GHG 
emissions. 

For at least three reasons, any single 
estimate of the SCC will be contestable. 
First, scientific and economic 
knowledge about the impacts of climate 
change continues to grow. With new 
and better information about relevant 
questions, including the cost, burdens, 
and possibility of adaptation, current 
estimates will inevitably change over 
time. Second, some of the likely and 
potential damages from climate 
change—for example, the value society 
places on adverse impacts on 
endangered species—are not included 
in all of the existing economic analyses. 
These omissions may mean that the best 
current estimates are too low. Third, 
controversial ethical judgments, 
including those involving the treatment 
of future generations, play a role in 
judgments about the SCC (see in 
particular the discussion of the discount 
rate, below). 

To date, regulations have used a range 

of values for the SCC. For example, a 
regulation proposed by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) in 
2008 assumed a value of $7 per ton CO2 
(2006$) for 2011 emission reductions 
(with a range of $0–14 for sensitivity 
analysis). Regulation finalized by DOE 
used a range of $0–$20 (2007$). Both of 
these ranges were designed to reflect the 
value of damages to the United States 
resulting from carbon emissions, or the 
‘‘domestic’’ SCC. In the final Model 
Year 2011 Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy rule, DOT used both a 
domestic SCC value of $2/t CO2 and a

global SCC value of $33/t CO2 (with 
sensitivity analysis at $80/tCO2), 
increasing at 2.4 percent per year 
thereafter. 

In recent months, a variety of agencies 

have worked to develop an objective 
methodology for selecting a range of 
interim SCC estimates to use in 
regulatory analyses until improved SCC 
estimates are developed. The following 
summary reflects the initial results of 
these efforts and proposes ranges and 
values for interim social costs of carbon 
used in this rule. It should be 
emphasized that the analysis described 
below is preliminary. These complex 
issues are of course undergoing a 
process of continuing review. Relevant 
agencies will be evaluating and seeking 
comment on all of the scientific, 
economic, and ethical issues before 
establishing final estimates for use in 
future rulemakings. 

The interim judgments resulting from 

the recent interagency review process 
can be summarized as follows: (a) DOE 
and other Federal agencies should 
consider the global benefits associated 
with the reductions of CO2 emissions 
resulting from efficiency standards and 
other similar rulemakings, rather 
continuing the previous focus on 
domestic benefits; (b) these global 
benefits should be based on SCC 
estimates (in 2007$) of $55, $33, $19, 
$10, and $5 per ton of CO2 equivalent 
emitted (or avoided) in 2007; (c) the 
SCC value of emissions that occur (or 
are avoided) in future years should be 
escalated using an annual growth rate of 
3 percent from the current values); and 
(d) domestic benefits are estimated to be 
approximately 6 percent of the global 
values. These interim judgments are 
based on the following considerations. 
1. Global and domestic estimates of 

SCC. Because of the distinctive nature of 
the climate change problem, estimates 
of both global and domestic SCC values 
should be considered, but the global 
measure should be ‘‘primary.’’ This 
approach represents a departure from 
past practices, which relied, for the 
most part, on measures of only domestic 
impacts. As a matter of law, both global 
and domestic values are permissible; the 
relevant statutory provisions are 
ambiguous and allow the agency to 
choose either measure. (It is true that 
Federal statutes are presumed not to 
have extraterritorial effect, in part to 
ensure that the laws of the United States 
respect the interests of foreign 
sovereigns. But use of a global measure 
for the SCC does not give extraterritorial 
effect to Federal law and hence does not 
intrude on such interests.) 

It is true that under OMB guidance, 

analysis from the domestic perspective

is required, while analysis from the 
international perspective is optional. 
The domestic decisions of one nation 
are not typically based on a judgment 
about the effects of those decisions on 
other nations. But the climate change 
problem is highly unusual in the sense 
that it involves (a) a global public good 
in which (b) the emissions of one nation 
may inflict significant damages on other 
nations and (c) the United States is 
actively engaged in promoting an 
international agreement to reduce 
worldwide emissions. 

In these circumstances, the global 
measure is preferred. Use of a global 
measure reflects the reality of the 
problem and is expected to contribute to 
the continuing efforts of the United 
States to ensure that emission 
reductions occur in many nations. 

Domestic SCC values are also 
presented. The development of a 
domestic SCC is greatly complicated by 
the relatively few region- or country- 
specific estimates of the SCC in the 
literature. One potential estimate comes 
from the DICE (Dynamic Integrated 
Climate Economy, William Nordhaus) 
model. In an unpublished paper, 
Nordhaus (2007) produced 
disaggregated SCC estimates using a 
regional version of the DICE model. He 
reported a U.S. estimate of $1/tCO2 
(2007 value, 2007$), which is roughly 
11 percent of the global value. 

An alternative source of estimates 
comes from a recent EPA modeling 
effort using the FUND (Climate 
Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation 
and Distribution, Center for Integrated 
Study of the Human Dimensions of 
Global Change) model. The resulting 
estimates suggest that the ratio of 
domestic to global benefits varies with 
key parameter assumptions. With a 3- 
percent discount rate, for example, the 
U.S. benefit is about 6 percent of the 
global benefit for the ‘‘central’’ (mean) 
FUND results, while, for the 
corresponding ‘‘high’’ estimates 
associated with a higher climate 
sensitivity and lower global economic 
growth, the U.S. benefit is less than 4 
percent of the global benefit. With a 2- 
percent discount rate, the U.S. share is 
about 2 to 5 percent of the global 
estimate. 

Based on this available evidence, a 

domestic SCC value equal to 6 percent 
of the global damages is used in this 
rulemaking. This figure is in the middle 
of the range of available estimates from 
the literature. It is recognized that the 6 
percent figure is approximate and 
highly speculative and alternative 
approaches will be explored before 
establishing final values for future 
rulemakings. 

2. Filtering existing analyses. There 

are numerous SCC estimates in the 
existing literature, and it is legitimate to 
make use of those estimates to produce 
a figure for current use. A reasonable 
starting point is provided by the meta- 
analysis in Richard Tol, ‘‘The Social 
Cost of Carbon: Trends, Outliers, and 
Catastrophes, Economics: The Open- 
Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal,’’ 
Vol. 2, 2008–25. http://www.economics- 
ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/ 
2008–25 (2008). With that starting point, 
it is proposed to ‘‘filter’’ existing SCC 
estimates by using those that (1) are 
derived from peer-reviewed studies; (2) 
do not weight the monetized damages to 
one country more than those in other 
countries; (3) use a ‘‘business as usual’’ 
climate scenario; and (4) are based on 
the most recent published version of 
each of the three major integrated 
assessment models (IAMs): FUND, DICE 
and PAGE (Policy Analysis of the 
Greenhouse Effect). 

Proposal (1) is based on the view that 
those studies that have been subject to 
peer review are more likely to be 
reliable than those that have not been. 
Proposal (2) is based on a principle of 
neutrality and simplicity; it does not 
treat the citizens of one nation 
differently on the basis of speculative or 
controversial considerations. Proposal 
(3) stems from the judgment that as a 
general rule, the proper way to assess a 
policy decision is by comparing the 
implementation of the policy against a 
counterfactual state where the policy is 
not implemented. A departure from this 
approach would be to consider a more 
dynamic setting in which other 
countries might implement policies to 
reduce GHG emissions at an unknown 
future date, and the United States could 
choose to implement such a policy now 
or in the future. 

Proposal (4) is based on three 

complementary judgments. First, the 
FUND, PAGE, and DICE models now 
stand as the most comprehensive and 
reliable efforts to measure the damages 
from climate change. Second, the latest 
versions of the three IAMs are likely to 
reflect the most recent evidence and 
learning, and hence they are presumed 
to be superior to those that preceded 
them. It is acknowledged that earlier 
versions may contain information that is 
missing from the latest versions. Third, 
any effort to choose among them, or to 
reject one in favor of the others, would 
be difficult to defend at this time. In the 
absence of a clear reason to choose 
among them, it is reasonable to base the 
SCC on all of them. 

The agency is keenly aware that the 

current IAMs fail to include all relevant 
information about the likely impacts

from greenhouse gas emissions. For 
example, ecosystem impacts, including 
species loss, do not appear to be 
included in at least two of the models. 
Some human health impacts, including 
increases in food-borne illnesses and in 
the quantity and toxicity of airborne 
allergens, also appear to be excluded. In 
addition, there has been considerable 
recent discussion of the risk of 
catastrophe and of how best to account 
for worst-case scenarios. It is not clear 
whether the three IAMs take adequate 
account of these potential effects. 

3. Use a model-weighted average of 
the estimates at each discount rate. At 
this time, there appears to be no 
scientifically valid reason to prefer any 
of the three major IAMs (FUND, PAGE, 
and DICE). Consequently, the estimates 
are based on an equal weighting of 
estimates from each of the models. 
Among estimates that remain after 
applying the filter, the average of all 
estimates within a model is derived. 
The estimated SCC is then calculated as 
the average of the three model-specific 
averages. This approach ensures that the 
interim estimate is not biased towards 
specific models or more prolific authors. 

4. Apply a 3-percent annual growth 
rate to the chosen SCC values. SCC is 
assumed to increase over time, because 
future emissions are expected to 
produce larger incremental damages as 
physical and economic systems become 
more stressed as the magnitude of 
climate change increases. Indeed, an 
implied growth rate in the SCC is 
produced by most studies that estimate 
economic damages caused by increased 
GHG emissions in future years. But 
neither the rate itself nor the 
information necessary to derive its 
implied value is commonly reported. In 
light of the limited amount of debate 
thus far about the appropriate growth 
rate of the SCC, applying a rate of 3 
percent per year seems appropriate at 
this stage. This value is consistent with 
the range recommended by IPCC (2007) 
and close to the latest published 
estimate (Hope, 2008). 

For climate change, one of the most 

complex issues involves the appropriate 
discount rate. OMB’s current guidance 
offers a detailed discussion of the 
relevant issues and calls for discount 
rates of 3 percent and 7 percent. It also 
permits a sensitivity analysis with low 
rates for intergenerational problems. (‘‘If 
your rule will have important 
intergenerational benefits or costs you 
might consider a further sensitivity 
analysis using a lower but positive 
discount rate in addition to calculating 
net benefits using discount rates of 3 
and 7 percent.’’) The SCC is being

developed within the general context of 
the current guidance. 

The choice of a discount rate, 

especially over long periods of time, 
raises highly contested and exceedingly 
difficult questions of science, 
economics, philosophy, and law. See, 
e.g., William Nordhaus, ‘‘The Challenge 
of Global Warming (2008); Nicholas 
Stern, The Economics of Climate 
Change’’ (2007); ‘‘Discounting and 
Intergenerational Equity’’ (Paul Portney 
and John Weyant, eds., 1999). Under 
imaginable assumptions, decisions 
based on cost-benefit analysis with high 
discount rates might harm future 
generations—at least if investments are 
not made for the benefit of those 
generations. (See Robert Lind, ‘‘Analysis 
for Intergenerational Discounting,’’ id. at 
173, 176–177.) At the same time, use of 
low discount rates for particular projects 
might itself harm future generations, by 
ensuring that resources are not used in 
a way that would greatly benefit them. 
In the context of climate change, 
questions of intergenerational equity are 
especially important. 

Reasonable arguments support the use 

of a 3-percent discount rate. First, that 
rate is among the two figures suggested 
by OMB guidance, and hence it fits with 
existing National policy. Second, it is 
standard to base the discount rate on the 
compensation that people receive for 
delaying consumption, and the 3- 
percent rate is close to the risk-free rate 
of return, proxied by the return on long 
term inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury 
Bonds. (In the context of climate 
change, it is possible to object to this 
standard method for deriving the 
discount rate.) Although these rates are 
currently closer to 2.5 percent, the use 
of 3 percent provides an adjustment for 
the liquidity premium that is reflected 
in these bonds’ returns. 

At the same time, other arguments 

support use of a 5-percent discount rate. 
First, that rate can also be justified by 
reference to the level of compensation 
for delaying consumption, because it fits 
with market behavior with respect to 
individuals’ willingness to trade off 
consumption across periods as 
measured by the estimated post-tax 
average real returns to private 
investment (e.g., the S&P 500). In the 
climate setting, the 5-percent discount 
rate may be preferable to the riskless 
rate because it is based on risky 
investments and the return to projects to 
mitigate climate change is also risky. In 
contrast, the 3-percent riskless rate may 
be a more appropriate discount rate for 
projects where the return is known with 
a high degree of confidence (e.g., 
highway guardrails). 

Second, 5 percent, and not 3 percent, 

is roughly consistent with estimates 
implied by reasonable inputs to the 
theoretically derived Ramsey equation, 
which specifies the optimal time path 
for consumption. That equation 
specifies the optimal discount rate as 
the sum of two components. The first 
reflects the fact that consumption in the 
future is likely to be higher than 
consumption today (even accounting for 
climate impacts), so diminishing 
marginal utility implies that the same 
monetary damage will cause a smaller 
reduction of utility in the future. 
Standard estimates of this term from the 
economics literature are in the range of 
3 to 5 percent. The second component 
reflects the possibility that a lower 
weight should be placed on utility in 
the future, to account for social 
impatience or extinction risk, which is 
specified by a pure rate of time 
preference (PRTP). A conventional 
estimate of the PRTP is 2 percent. (Some 
observers believe that a principle of 
intergenerational equity suggests that 
the PRTP should be close to zero.) It 
follows that discount rate of 5 percent 
is within the range of values which are 
able to be derived from the Ramsey 
equation, albeit at the low end of the 
range of estimates usually associated 
with Ramsey discounting. 

It is recognized that the arguments 

above—for use of market behavior and 
the Ramsey equation—face objections in 
the context of climate change, and of 
course there are alternative approaches. 
In light of climate change, it is possible 
that consumption in the future will not 
be higher than consumption today, and 
if so, the Ramsey equation will suggest 
a lower figure. Some people have 
suggested that a very low discount rate, 
below 3 percent, is justified in light of 
the ethical considerations calling for a 
principle of intergenerational neutrality. 
See Nicholas Stern, ‘‘The Economics of 
Climate Change’’ (2007); for contrary 
views, see William Nordhaus, The A 
Question of Balance (2008); Martin 
Weitzman, ‘‘Review of the Stern Review 
on the Economics of Climate Change.’’ 
Journal of Economic Literature, 45(3): 
703–724 (2007). Additionally, some 
analyses attempt to deal with 
uncertainty with respect to interest rates 
over time; a possible approach enabling 
the consideration of such uncertainties 
is discussed below. Richard Newell and 
William Pizer, ‘‘Discounting the Distant 
Future: How Much do Uncertain Rates 
Increase Valuations?’’ J. Environ. Econ. 
Manage. 46 (2003) 52–71. 

The application of the methodology 
outlined above yields estimates of the 
SCC that are reported in Table V18.

* The sample includes all peer reviewed, non-equity-weighted estimates included in Tol (2008), Nordhaus (2008), Hope (2008), and Anthoff et 
al. (2009), that are based on the most recent published version of FUND, PAGE, or DICE and use business-as-usual climate scenarios. All val-
ues are based on the best available information from the underlying studies about the base year and year dollars, rather than the Tol (2008) as-
sumption  that  all  estimates  included  in  his  review  are  1995  values  in  1995$.  All  values  were  updated  to  2007  using  a  3-percent  annual  growth 
rate in the SCC, and adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator. 

DOE has conducted analyses at $33 
and $5 per ton as these represent the 
estimates associated with the 3 percent 
and 5 percent discount rates, 
respectively. The 3 percent and 5 
percent estimates have independent 
appeal and at this time a clear 
preference for one over the other is not 
warranted. Thus, DOE has also 
included—and centered its current 
attention on—the average of the 
estimates associated with these discount 
rates, which is $19. (Based on the $19 
global value, the domestic value would 
be $1.14 per ton of CO2 equivalent.) 
It is true that there is uncertainty 
about interest rates over long time 
horizons. Recognizing that point, 

Newell and Pizer have made a careful 
effort to adjust for that uncertainty. See 
Newell and Pizer, supra. This is a 
relatively recent contribution to the 
literature. 

There are several concerns with using 

this approach in this context. First, it 
would be a departure from current OMB 
guidance. Second, an approach that 
would average what emerges from 
discount rates of 3 percent and 5 
percent reflects uncertainty about the 
discount rate, but based on a different 
model of uncertainty. The Newell-Pizer 
approach models discount rate 
uncertainty as something that evolves 
over time; in contrast, one alternative 
approach would assume that there is a 

single discount rate with equal 
probability of 3 percent and 5 percent. 
Table V.19 reports on the application 

of the Newell-Pizer adjustments. The 
precise numbers depend on the 
assumptions about the data generating 
process that governs interest rates. 
Columns (1a) and (1b) assume that 
‘‘random walk’’ model best describes 
the data and uses 3-percent and 5- 
percent discount rates, respectively. 
Columns (2a) and (2b) repeat this, 
except that it assumes a ‘‘mean- 
reverting’’ process. As Newell and Pizer 
report, there is stronger empirical 
support for the random walk model.

al. (2009), that are based on the most recent published version of FUND, PAGE, or DICE and use business-as-usual climate scenarios. All val-

rate in the SCC, and adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator. 

** Assumes a starting discount rate of 3 percent. Newell and Pizer (2003) based adjustment factors are not applied to estimates from Guo et 

al. (2006) that use a different approach to account for discount rate uncertainty (rows 7–8). 

The resulting estimates of the social 
cost of carbon are necessarily greater. 
When the adjustments from the random 
walk model are applied, the estimates of 
the social cost of carbon are $10 and 
$55, with the 3 percent and 5 percent 
discount rates, respectively. The 
application of the mean-reverting 
adjustment yields estimates of $6 and 
$36. Since the random walk model has 
greater support from the data, DOE also 

conducted analyses with the value of 
the SCC set at $10 and $55. 

In summary, DOE considered in its 

decision process for this notice of 
proposed rulemaking the potential 
global benefits resulting from reduced 
CO2 emissions valued at $5, $10, $19, 
$30 and $55 per metric ton, and has also 
presented the domestic benefits derived 
using a value of $1.14 per metric ton. 
All of these unit values represent 

emissions that are valued in 2007$. The 
final net present values for cumulative 
emissions reductions are reported in 
2008$ so that they can be compared 
with other rulemaking analyses in the 
same dollar units. 

Table V. and Table V.21 present the 

resulting estimates of the potential range 
of NPV benefits associated with 
reducing CO2 emissions.

DOE is well aware that scientific and 

economic knowledge about the 
contribution of CO2 and other GHG 
emissions to changes in the future 
global climate and the potential 
resulting damages to the world economy 
continues to evolve rapidly. Thus, any 
value placed in this rulemaking on 

reducing CO2 emissions is subject to 
likely change. 

DOE, together with other Federal 

agencies, is reviewing various 
methodologies for estimating the 
monetary value of reductions in CO2 
and other GHG emissions. This review 
will consider the comments on this 
subject that are part of the public record 

for this and other rulemakings, as well 
as other methodological assumptions 
and issues, such as whether the 
appropriate values should represent 
domestic U.S. benefits, as well as global 
benefits (and costs). Given the 
complexity of the many issues involved, 
this review is ongoing. However, 
consistent with DOE’s legal obligations,

and taking into account the uncertainty 
involved with this particular issue, DOE 
has included in today’s SNOPR the most 
recent values and analyses employed in 
a rulemaking by another Federal agency. 

DOE also investigated the potential 
monetary benefit of reduced NOX and 
Hg emissions from the TSLs it 
considered. As previously stated, DOE’s 
initial analysis assumed the presence of 
nationwide emission caps on SO2 and 
Hg, and caps on NOX emissions in the 
28 States covered by CAIR. In the 
presence of these caps, DOE concluded 
that negligible physical reductions in 
power sector emissions would occur, 
but that the standards could put 
downward pressure on the prices of 
emissions allowances in cap and trade 
markets. Estimating this effect is very 
difficult because of factors such as 
credit banking, which can change the 
trajectory of prices. DOE has concluded 
that the effect from energy conservation 
standards on SO2 allowance prices is 
likely to be negligible, based on runs of 
the NEMS–BT model. See chapter 16 of 
the SNOPR TSD for further details. 

As noted above, standards would not 

produce an economic impact in the 
form of lower prices for NOX emissions 
allowance credits in the 28 eastern 
States and D.C. covered by the CAIR 

cap. However, new or amended energy 
conservation standards would reduce 
NOX emissions in those 22 States that 
are not affected by CAIR. DOE estimated 
the monetized value of NOX emissions 
reductions resulting from each of the 
TSLs considered for today’s SNOPR 
based on environmental damage 
estimates from the literature. Available 
estimates suggest a very wide range of 
monetary values for NOX emissions, 
ranging from $370 per ton to $3,800 per 
ton of NOX from stationary sources, 
measured in 2001$ (equivalent to a 
range of $432 per ton to $4,441 per ton 
in 2007$). Refer to the OMB, Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
‘‘2006 Report to Congress on the Costs 
and Benefits of Federal Regulations and 
Unfunded Mandates on State, Local, 
and Tribal Entities,’’ Washington, DC, 
for additional information. 

For Hg emissions reductions, DOE 

estimated the national monetized values 
resulting from the TSLs considered for 
today’s SNOPR based on environmental 
damage estimates from the literature. 
DOE determined that the impact of Hg 
emissions from power plants on humans 
is considered highly uncertain. 
However, DOE identified two estimates 
of the environmental damage of Hg 

based on two estimates of the adverse 
impact of childhood exposure to methyl 
mercury on IQ for American children, 
and subsequent loss of lifetime 
economic productivity resulting from 
these IQ losses. The high-end estimate 
is based on an estimate of the current 
aggregate cost of the loss of IQ in 
American children that results from 
exposure to Hg of U.S. power plant 
origin ($1.3 billion per year in year 
2000$), which works out to $32.6 
million per ton emitted per year 
(2007$).40 The low-end estimate is $0.66 
million per ton emitted (in 2004$) or 
$0.73 million per ton in 2007$. DOE 
derived this estimate from an evaluation 
of mercury control that used different 
methods and assumptions from the first 
study but was also based on the present 
value of the lifetime earnings of 
children exposed.41 

Table V.22 and Table V.23 present the 
resulting estimates of the potential range 
of present value benefits associated with 
reduced national NOX and Hg emissions 
from the TSLs DOE considered. The 
final net present values for cumulative 
emissions reductions are reported in 
2008$ so that they can be compared 
with other rulemaking analyses in the 
same dollar units.

Although comparing the value of 

consumer savings to the values of 
emission reductions provides a valuable 
perspective, please note the following: 
(1) The national consumer savings are 
domestic U.S. consumer monetary 
savings found in market transactions 
while the values of emission reductions 
are based on ranges of estimates of 
imputed marginal social costs, which, in 
the case of CO2, are meant to reflect 
global benefits; and (2) the assessments 
of consumer savings and emission- 
related benefits are performed with 
different computer models, leading to 
different time frames for the analyses. 
The present value of national consumer 
savings is measured for the period 
2015–2065 (31 years from 2015 to 2045 
inclusive, plus the longest lifetime of 
the equipment shipped in the 31st year). 
However, the timeframes of the benefits 
associated with the emission reductions 

differ. For example, the value of CO2 
emission reductions is meant to reflect 
the present value of all future climate 
related impacts, even those beyond 
2065. 

DOE seeks comment on the above 

presentation of NPV values and on the 
consideration of GHG emissions in 
future energy efficiency standards 
rulemakings, including alternative 
methodological approaches to including 
GHG emissions in its analysis. More 
specifically, DOE seeks comment on 
both how it integrates monetized GHG 
emissions or Social Cost of Carbon 
values, as well as other monetized 
benefits or costs, into its analysis and 
models, and also on suggested 
alternatives to the current approach. 
Table V.26 presents the estimated 

wastewater discharge reductions due to 
the TSLs for CCWs. In chapter 16 of the 
TSD accompanying this notice, DOE 
reports annual changes in wastewater 
discharge attributable to each TSL. 

The NPV of the monetized benefits 
associated with emissions reductions 
can be viewed as a complement to the 
NPV of the consumer savings calculated 
for each TSL considered in this 
rulemaking. Table V.24 presents the 
NPV values for CCWs that would result 
if DOE were to apply the low- and high- 
end estimates of the potential benefits 
resulting from reduced CO2, NOX and 
Hg emissions to the NPV of consumer 
savings calculated for each TSL 
considered in this rulemaking, at both a 
7- and 3-percent discount rate. Table 
V.24 presents the NPV values for CCWs 
that would result if DOE were to apply 
the low- and high-end estimates of the 
potential global benefits resulting from 
reduced CO2 emissions only to the NPV 
of consumer savings calculated for each 
TSL considered in this rulemaking, at 
both a 7- and 3-percent discount rate. 
For CO2, only the range of global benefit 
values are used, $5 and $55 in 2007$,

likely to result directly from the

(4) Any lessening of the utility or the 
performance of the covered products or 
equipment likely to result from the 
imposition of the standard; 

(5) The impact of any lessening of 

competition, as determined in writing 
by the Attorney General, that is likely to 
result from the imposition of the 
standard; 

(6) The need for national energy and 

water conservation; and 

(7) Other factors the Secretary 

considers relevant.

The new or amended standard also 

must ‘‘result in significant conservation 
of energy.’’ 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B) and 6316(a)) 

In selecting the proposed energy 

conservation standards for CCWs for 
consideration in today’s SNOPR, DOE 
started by examining the maximum 
technologically feasible levels, and 
determined whether those levels were 
economically justified. If DOE 
determined that the maximum 
technologically feasible level was not 
justified, DOE then analyzed the next 
lower TSL to determine whether that 
level was economically justified. DOE 
repeated this procedure until it 

identified an economically justified 
TSL. 

To aid the reader in understanding 

the benefits and/or burdens of each TSL, 
the following tables summarize the 
quantitative analytical results for each 
TSL, based on the assumptions and 
methodology discussed above. These 
tables present the results—or, in some 
cases, a range of results—for each TSL. 
The range of values reported in these 
tables for industry impacts represents 
the results for the different markup 
scenarios that DOE used to estimate 
manufacturer impacts. 

In addition to the quantitative results, 

DOE also considers other burdens and 
benefits that affect economic 
justification. 

In sum, today’s proposed standard 

levels for the equipment that is the 
subject of this rulemaking reflect DOE’s 
careful balancing of the relevant 
statutory factors under EPCA. After 
considering public comments on this 
SNOPR, DOE will publish a final rule 
that either adopts the proposed TSL, 
one of the higher or lower TSLs, or some 
value in between.

Table V.27 presents a summary of the 
quantitative results for each CCW TSL.

C. Proposed Standards 
1. Overview 

Under 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A) and 

6316(a), EPCA requires that any new or 
amended energy conservation standard 
for any type (or class) of covered 
product or equipment be designed to 
achieve the maximum improvement in 
energy efficiency that the Secretary 
determines is technologically feasible 
and economically justified. In 
determining whether a standard is 
economically justified, the Secretary 
must determine whether the benefits of 
the standard exceed its burdens to the 
greatest extent practicable, in light of 
the following seven factors: 

(1) The economic impact of the 

standard on manufacturers and 
consumers of the products or equipment 
subject to the standard; 

(2) The savings in operating costs 

throughout the estimated average life of 
the covered products or equipment in 
the type (or class) compared to any 
increase in the price, initial charges, or 
maintenance expenses for the covered 
products or equipment that are likely to 
result from the imposition of the 
standard; 

(3) The total projected amount of 

energy (or, as applicable, water) savings

considers significant. For the Nation as 
a whole, DOE projects that TSL 5 would 
result in a net increase of $0.51 billion 
in NPV, using a discount rate of 7 
percent. The emissions reductions at 
TSL 5 are 6.11 Mt of CO2, 3.66 kt of 
NOX, and 0 t to 0.03 t of Hg. At TSL 5, 
the estimated benefit of reducing CO2 
emissions based on global estimates of 
the value of CO2 ranges from $15 
million to $168 million at a 7-percent 
discount rate and $33 million to $364 
million at a 3-percent discount rate. 
Total generating capacity in 2043 is 
estimated to decrease compared to the 
reference case by 0.012 GW under TSL 
5. 

At TSL 5, DOE projects that the 

average top-loading CCW consumer 
would experience a decrease in LCC of 
$179 in multi-family applications and 
$190 in laundromats. DOE also 
estimates an LCC decrease for an 
overwhelming majority of consumers in 
the Nation that purchase top-loading 
CCWs—85 percent of consumers in 
multi-family applications and 96 
percent of consumers in laundromats. 
The median payback period of the 
average consumer at TSL 5 in multi- 
family applications and in laundromats 
is projected to be 4.6 years and 2.8 
years, respectively. 

At TSL 5, DOE projects that the 

average front-loading CCW consumer 
would experience a decrease in LCC of 
$203 in multi-family applications and 
$216 in laundromats. DOE also 
estimates an LCC decrease for an 
overwhelming majority of consumers 
that purchase front-loading CCWs—99 
percent of consumers in multi-family 
applications and 100 percent of 
consumers in laundromats. The median 
payback period of the average consumer 
at TSL 5 in multi-family applications 
and in laundromats is projected to be 
2.9 years and 1.6 years, respectively. 

At TSL 5, DOE estimated the 

projected change in INPV ranges from a 
total decrease of $20.4 million for both 
equipment classes to a total decrease of 
$23.0 million. At TSL 5, DOE recognizes 
the risk of very large negative impacts 
if manufacturers’ expectations about 
reduced shipments are realized. TSL 5 
could result in a net loss as high as 37.3 
percent in INPV to CCW manufacturers. 
Also, DOE is especially sensitive to the 
potentially severe impacts to the LVM of 
CCWs. Because the LVM’s clothes 
washer revenue is so dependent on 
CCW sales, DOE is concerned that TSL 
5 will cause material harm to the LVM. 

Although DOE recognizes the 

increased economic benefits that could 
result from TSL 5, DOE has tentatively 
concluded that the benefits of a Federal 
standard at TSL 5 would be outweighed 

by the potential for disincentivizing 
consumers from purchasing more 
efficient front-loading CCWs. At TSL 5, 
front-loading CCWs are highly efficient 
but have a purchase price estimated to 
be $497 more expensive than top- 
loading CCWs. With such a large price 
differential between the two types of 
CCWs, and with less than 2 percent of 
the front-loading market at TSL 5, DOE 
is concerned that significant numbers of 
potential consumers of front-loading 
CCWs would choose to purchase a less 
efficient top-loading unit. 

As described in section III.E.2.c, DOE 

did analyze the impacts of increased 
purchase prices for each equipment 
class but independently of the other. 
Because the price impacts for more 
efficient top-loaders are higher than 
those for more efficient front-loaders, 
DOE estimated that top-loading CCW 
sales would decrease slightly more 
rapidly than for front-loaders. But DOE 
was not able to estimate the cross price 
elasticity of demand between the two 
equipment classes to determine whether 
consumers of front-loading CCWs would 
switch to less expensive top-loaders. 

If potential front-loading CCW 

consumers did decide to switch to less 
expensive top-loading washers, the NES 
and NPV realized from TSL 5 would be 
diminished. DOE notes that in 
developing the energy savings and water 
savings estimates for TSL 5, the agency 
effectively held constant the ratio of 
front-loading to top-loading CCW 
shipments across the various TSLs. 
Particularly at TSL 3 to TSL 5, the 
differences in these estimates are small, 
especially at a 7-percent discount rate. 
DOE requests comment as to whether it 
should account for the cross price 
elasticity of demand between the two 
equipment classes when calculating the 
anticipated energy and water savings at 
the different TSLs. DOE also seeks 
relevant data or other information on 
this topic. DOE believes that the values 
currently in Table V.27 represent the 
high end of the potential energy and 
water savings for these TSLs. Taking 
into account price elasticity of demand 
could affect the anticipated energy and 
water savings of the various TSLs, and 
it could potentially result in a change in 
the TSL with the highest projected 
energy/water savings level. 

In addition, TSL 5 would adversely 

impact manufacturers’ INPV to a 
significant extent. Not only does the 
industry face a potential, significant loss 
in industry INPV, but manufacturers 
would also need to make significant 
capital investments for both types of 
CCWs in order to produce both top- 
loading and front-loading washers at the 
maximum technologically feasible 

levels. After carefully considering the 
analysis and weighing the benefits and 
burdens of TSL 5, the Secretary has 
reached the following initial conclusion: 
At TSL 5, the benefits of energy savings, 
economic benefit, and emissions 
reductions would be outweighed by the 
potential for giving consumers less 
incentive to purchase high efficiency 
front-loading CCWs and the large capital 
conversion costs that could result in a 
substantial reduction in INPV for 
manufacturers. 

Next, DOE considered TSL 4. TSL 4 
would likely save 0.11 quads of energy 
and 0.16 trillion gallons of water 
through 2043, an amount DOE considers 
significant. For the Nation as a whole, 
DOE projects that TSL 4 would result in 
a net increase of $0.41 billion in NPV, 
using a discount rate of 7 percent. The 
emissions reductions at TSL 4 are 5.66 
Mt of CO2, 3.39 kt of NOX, and 0 t to 
0.03 t of Hg. At TSL 4, the estimated 
benefits of reducing CO2 emissions 
based on global estimates of the value of 
CO2 ranges from $14 million to $156 
million at a 7-percent discount rate and 
$31 million to $337 million at a 3- 
percent discount rate. Total generating 
capacity in 2043 is estimated to 
decrease compared to the reference case 
by 0.011 GW under TSL 4. 

At TSL 4, top-loading CCWs have the 
same efficiency as at TSL 5. Therefore, 
top-loading CCW consumers will 
experience the same LCC impacts and 
payback periods as TSL 5. At TSL 4 for 
front-loading CCWs, DOE projects that 
the average front-loading CCW 
consumer would experience a decrease 
in LCC of $91 in multi-family 
applications and $93 in laundromats. 
DOE also estimates an LCC decrease for 
an overwhelming majority of consumers 
that purchase front-loading CCWs—76 
percent of consumers in multi-family 
applications and 77 percent of 
consumers in laundromats. The median 
payback period of the average consumer 
at TSL 4 in multi-family applications 
and in laundromats is projected to be 
3.0 years and 1.8 years, respectively. 

DOE estimated the projected change 
in INPV ranges from a decrease of $7.8 
million to a decrease of $10.2 million. 
At TSL 4, DOE recognizes the risk of 
very large negative impacts if 
manufacturers’ expectations about 
reduced shipments are realized. TSL 4 
could result in a net loss as high as 16.6 
percent in INPV to CCW manufacturers. 
Also, DOE is especially sensitive to the 
potentially severe impacts to the LVM. 
Since the LVM’s clothes washer revenue 
is so dependent on CCW sales, DOE is 
concerned that TSL 4 will materially 
harm the LVM.

Although DOE recognizes the 

increased economic benefits that could 
result from TSL 4, DOE has the same 
concerns regarding TSL 4 as for TSL 5. 
Namely, DOE has concerns as to the 
potential of TSL 4 to give consumers 
less incentive to purchase more efficient 
front-loading washers. At TSL 4, front- 
loading CCWs are highly efficient but 
have a purchase price estimated to be 
$454 more expensive than top-loading 
washers. With such a price differential 
between the two types of CCWs, and 
with less than 4 percent of the front- 
loading market currently meeting TSL 4, 
DOE is concerned that a significant 
number of potential consumers of front- 
loading CCWs would be more likely 
choose to purchase a top-loading CCW, 
which is less efficient. If potential front- 
loading CCW consumers did decide to 
switch to top-loading models, the NES 
and NPV realized from TSL 4 would be 
diminished. In addition, TSL 4 would 
adversely impact manufacturers’ INPV 
to a significant extent. Not only does the 
industry face a potential loss in industry 
INPV, but manufacturers would also 
need to make significant capital 
investments for both types of CCWs in 
order to produce both top-loading 
washers at the maximum 
technologically feasible level and front- 
loading washers at a level which only 3 
percent of the market currently meets. 
After carefully considering the analysis 
and weighing the benefits and burdens 
of TSL 4, the Secretary has reached the 
following initial conclusion: At TSL 4, 
the benefits of energy savings, economic 
benefit, and emissions reductions would 
be outweighed by the potential for 
giving consumers less incentive to 
purchase high efficiency front-loading 
CCWs and the large capital conversion 
costs that could result in a substantial 
reduction in INPV for manufacturers. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 3. TSL 3 
would likely save 0.10 quads of energy 
and 0.14 trillion gallons of water 
through 2043, an amount DOE considers 
significant. For the Nation as a whole, 
DOE projects that TSL 3 would result in 
a net increase of $0.36 billion in NPV, 
using a discount rate of 7 percent. The 
emissions reductions at TSL 3 are 5.07 
Mt of CO2, 3.04 kt of NOX, and 0 t to 
0.03 t of Hg. The estimated benefits of 
reducing CO2 emissions based on global 
estimates of the value of CO2 ranges 
from $13 million to $140 million at a 7- 
percent discount rate and $28 million to 
$303 million at a 3-percent discount 
rate. Total generating capacity in 2043 is 
estimated to decrease compared to the 
reference case by 0.010 GW under TSL 
3.

At TSL 3, top-loading CCWs have the 
same efficiency as at TSL 5. Therefore, 
top-loading CCW consumers would 
experience the same LCC impacts and 
payback periods as TSL 5. At TSL 3 for 
front-loading CCWs, DOE projects that 
the average front-loading CCW 
consumer would experience a decrease 
in LCC of $19 in multi-family 
applications and $22 in laundromats. 
DOE also estimates an LCC decrease for 
all consumers that do not already 
purchase front-loading CCWs with an 
efficiency meeting TSL 3. The median 
payback period of the average consumer 
at TSL 3 in multi-family applications 
and in laundromats is projected to be 
0.4 years and 0.2 years, respectively. 

DOE estimated the projected change 
in INPV ranges from a decrease of $4.8 
million to a decrease of $7.0 million. At 
TSL 3, DOE recognizes the risk of very 
large negative impacts if manufacturers’ 
expectations about reduced shipments 
are realized. In TSL 3 could result in a 
net loss as high as 11.4 percent in INPV 
to CCW manufacturers. Also, DOE is 
especially sensitive to the potential 
adverse impacts to the LVM. Since the 
LVM’s clothes washer revenue is so 
dependent on CCW sales, DOE is 
concerned that TSL 3 could 
disproportionately impact the LVM. 

DOE recognizes the increased 

economic benefits that could result from 
TSL 3. DOE still has concerns of the 
potential for giving consumers less 
incentive to purchase more efficient 
front-loading washers, but at TSL 3, the 
price difference between front-loading 
and top-loading CCWs drops to $414. 
However, given that DOE projects that 
the average front-loading CCW 
consumer would experience an LCC 
savings at TSL 3, DOE believes that 
most front-loading CCW consumers not 
already purchasing washers at TSL 3 
would likely continue to purchase a 
front-loading unit if standards are set at 
TSL 3. DOE notes that TSL 3 adversely 
impacts manufacturers’ INPV, but 
because such a large percent of the 
front-loading market is at TSL 3, 
manufacturers would likely not need to 
make significant capital investments for 
front-loading CCWs. Product 
development and conversion expenses 
and capital investments would only be 
required in order to produce higher 
efficiency top-loading washers at TSL 3. 

After considering the analysis and 

weighing the benefits and the burdens, 
DOE has tentatively concluded that the 
benefits of a TSL 3 standard outweigh 
the burdens. In particular, the Secretary 
has tentatively concluded that TSL 3 
saves a significant amount of energy and 

is technologically feasible and 
economically justified. Therefore, DOE 
today proposes to adopt the energy 
conservation standards for CCWs at TSL 
3. Table V.28 lists today’s proposed 
energy conservation standards for 
CCWs. DOE’s proposal to amend energy 
conservation standards for CCWs at TSL 
3 reflects its tentative conclusion that 
this standard level would minimize the 
potential adverse impacts on the LVM 
and, therefore, would also minimize the 
adverse impacts on CCW market 
competition. However, DOE will 
carefully consider DOJ’s review of 
today’s proposed standards for CCWs 
and any public comment received on 
these impacts before issuing its final 
rule for this equipment. It is DOE’s 
intent to set a standard that will not 
produce significant adverse impacts on 
competition in this market. In proposing 
the standards in today’s notice, DOE has 
also taken into consideration DOJ’s 
determination on the standards 
proposed in the October 2008 NOPR.

DOE seeks comment on the proposed 
standards. This is identified as Issue 7 
in section VII.E of today’s supplemental 
notice (Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment.) 

DOE also calculated the annualized 
values for certain benefits and costs at 
the various TSLs. Table V.29 shows the 
annualized values. DOE used a two-step 
calculation process to convert the time- 
series of costs and benefits into 
annualized values. First, DOE calculated 
a present value for the time-series of 
costs and benefits using a discount rate 
of either three or seven percent. From 
the present value, DOE then calculated 
the fixed annual payment over the 
analysis time period (2013 to 2043) that 
yielded the same present value. The 
fixed annual payment is the annualized 
value. Although DOE calculated 
annualized values, this does not imply 
that the time-series of cost and benefits 
from which the annualized values were 
determined are a steady stream of 
payments.

57793 

BILLING  CODE  6450–01–C 
VI. Procedural Issues and Regulatory 
Review 
A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 

Today’s regulatory action has been 

determined to be a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ under section 3(f)(1) 
of Executive Order 12866, ‘‘Regulatory 
Planning and Review.’’ 58 FR 51735 
(Oct. 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action 
was subject to review under the 
Executive Order by the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) in the Office of Management and 
Budget. 

The Executive Order requires each 

agency to identify the problem the 
agency intends to address that warrants 
new agency action (including, where 
applicable, the failures of private 

markets or public institutions), as well 
as to assess the significance of that 
problem in evaluating whether any new 
regulation is warranted. E.O. 12866, 
section 1(b)(1). 

The October 2008 NOPR evaluated 

the market failure that the proposed rule 
would address. 73 FR 62034, 62122–23 
(Oct. 17, 2008). DOE’s analysis for 
CCWs explicitly quantifies and accounts 
for the percentage of consumers that 
already purchase more efficient 
equipment and takes these consumers 
into account when determining the 
national energy savings associated with 
various TSLs. The analysis suggests that 
accounting for the market value of 
energy savings alone (i.e., excluding any 
possible additional ‘‘externality’’ 
benefits such as those noted below) 
would produce enough benefits to yield 

net benefits across a wide array of 
equipment and circumstances. In the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE requested 
additional data (including the 
percentage of consumers purchasing 
more efficient CCWs and the extent to 
which consumers will continue to 
purchase more efficient equipment), in 
order to test the existence and extent of 
these consumer actions. 73 FR 62034, 
62123 (Oct. 17, 2008). DOE received no 
such data from interested parties in 
response to the October 2008 NOPR. 
DOE believes that there is a lack of 

consumer information and/or 
information processing capability about 
energy efficiency opportunities in the 
home appliance market. If this is the 
case, DOE would expect the energy 
efficiency for CCWs to be randomly 
distributed across key variables such as

energy prices and usage levels. DOE has 
estimated the percentage of consumers 
that already purchase more efficient 
CCWs. However, DOE does not correlate 
the consumer’s usage pattern and energy 
price with the efficiency of the 
purchased equipment. In the October 
2008 NOPR, DOE sought data on the 
efficiency levels of existing CCWs by 
how often they are used (e.g., how many 
times or hours the equipment is used) 
and their associated energy prices (and/ 
or geographic regions of the country). Id. 
DOE received no such data from 
interested parties in response to the 
October 2008 NOPR. Therefore, DOE 
was unable to test for today’s 
supplemental rule the extent to which 
purchasers of CCWs behave as if they 
are unaware of the costs associated with 
their energy consumption. 

A related issue is asymmetric 

information (one party to a transaction 
has more and better information than 
the other) and/or high transactions costs 
(costs of gathering information and 
effecting exchanges of goods and 
services). In many instances, the party 
responsible for an appliance purchase 
may not be the one who pays the cost 
to operate it. For example, home 
builders in large-scale developments 
often make decisions about appliances 
without input from home buyers and do 
not offer options to upgrade those 
appliances. Also, apartment owners 
normally make decisions about 
appliances, but renters often pay the 
utility bills. If there were no 
transactions costs, it would be in the 
home builders’ and apartment owners’ 
interest to install appliances that buyers 
and renters would choose. For example, 
one would expect that a renter who 
knowingly faces higher utility bills from 
low efficiency appliances would be 
willing to pay less in rent, and the 
apartment owner would indirectly bear 
the higher utility cost. However, this 
information is not readily available, and 
it may not be in the renter’s interest to 
take the time to develop it, or, in the 
case of the landlord who installs a high 
efficiency appliance, to convey that 
information to the renter. 

To the extent that asymmetric 

information and/or high transactions 
costs are problems, one would expect to 
find certain outcomes for appliance 
energy efficiency. For example, all 
things being equal, one would not 
expect to see higher rents for apartments 
with high efficiency appliances. 
Conversely, if there were symmetric 

information, one would expect 
appliances with higher energy efficiency 
in rental units where the rent includes 
utilities compared to those where the 
renter pays the utility bills separately. 
Similarly, for single-family homes, one 
would expect higher energy efficiency 
levels for replacement units than for 
appliances installed in new 
construction. Within the new 
construction market, one would expect 
to see appliances with higher energy 
efficiency levels in custom-built homes 
(where the buyer has more say in 
appliance choices) than in comparable 
homes built in large-scale 
developments. 

The above issues pertaining to 

asymmetric information and/or high 
transaction costs seem to be less 
relevant to the CCW market. For 
example, as discussed in section 
III.D.10, DOE concluded that a split 
incentive is unlikely between route 
operators and multi-family property 
owners. Because split incentives are 
likely not applicable to the CCW market, 
the probability that asymmetric 
information exists where one party (e.g., 
a route operator) has more and better 
information than the other (e.g., a multi- 
family property owner) is low. Further, 
because DOE received no data from 
interested parties in response to the 
October 2008 NOPR on the issue of 
asymmetric information and/or high 
transactions costs, DOE was unable to 
conclusively determine for today’s 
supplemental notice the extent to which 
asymmetric information and/or high 
transaction costs are a market failure in 
the CCW market. 

In addition, this rulemaking is likely 

to yield certain external benefits 
resulting from improved energy 
efficiency of CCWs that are not captured 
by the users of such equipment. These 
benefits include externalities related to 
environmental protection and energy 
security that are not reflected in energy 
prices, such as reduced emissions of 
greenhouse gases. The TSLs which DOE 
evaluated resulted in CO2, NOX, and Hg 
emissions reductions. DOE also 
determined a range of possible monetary 
benefits associated with the emissions 
reductions. DOE considered both the 
emissions reductions and their possible 
monetary benefit in determining the 
economic feasibility of the TSLs. 

DOE conducted a regulatory impact 
analysis (RIA) for review by the Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) at OMB. DOE presented to OIRA

the draft supplemental notice and other 
documents prepared for this 
rulemaking, including the RIA, and has 
included these documents in the 
rulemaking record. They are available 
for public review in the Resource Room 
of the Building Technologies Program, 
950 L’Enfant Plaza, SW., 6th Floor, 
Washington, DC 20024, (202) 586–9127, 
between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., 
Monday through Friday, except Federal 
holidays. 

The RIA is contained as chapter 17 in 

the TSD prepared for the rulemaking. 
The RIA consists of (1) a statement of 
the problem addressed by this 
regulation, and the mandate for 
government action; (2) a description and 
analysis of the feasible policy 
alternatives to this regulation; (3) a 
quantitative comparison of the impacts 
of the alternatives; and (4) the national 
economic impacts of today’s proposed 
standards. DOE performed an RIA solely 
for CCWs for today’s supplemental 
notice. 

The RIA calculates the effects of 

feasible policy alternatives to energy 
conservation standards for CCWs and 
provides a quantitative comparison of 
the impacts of the alternatives. DOE 
evaluated each alternative in terms of its 
ability to achieve significant energy 
savings at reasonable costs, and 
compared it to the effectiveness of 
today’s proposed standards. DOE 
analyzed these alternatives using a 
series of regulatory scenarios as input to 
the NIA spreadsheets for the two 
equipment classes, which it modified to 
allow inputs for voluntary measures. 
For more details on how DOE modified 
the NIA spreadsheets to determine the 
impacts due to the various non- 
regulatory alternatives to standards, 
refer to chapter 17 of the TSD 
accompanying this notice. 

As shown in Table VI.1 below, DOE 
identified the following major policy 
alternatives for achieving increased 
energy efficiency in conventional CCWs: 

(1) No new regulatory action; 
(2) Financial incentives; 
(3) Consumer rebates; 
(4) Consumer tax credits; 
(5) Manufacturer tax credits; 
(6) Voluntary energy efficiency 

targets; 

(7) Bulk government purchases; 
(8) Early replacement; and 
(9) Today’s proposed approach 

(national performance and prescriptive 
standards).

* Energy savings are in source quads. 
** Net  present  value  is  the  value  in  the  present  of  a  time  series  of  costs  and  savings.  DOE  determined  the  net  present  value  from  2013  to 

2043 in billions of 2008 dollars. 

*** Voluntary energy efficiency target and bulk government purchase alternatives are not considered for front-loading washers because the per-

centage of the market at TSL 3 (today’s proposed standard) is well over the market adoption target level that each alternative strives to attain. 

The net present value amounts shown 

in Table VI.1 refer to the NPV for 
consumers. The costs to the government 
of each policy (such as rebates or tax 
credits) are not included in the costs for 
the NPV since, on balance, consumers 
would be both paying for (through 
taxes) and receiving the benefits of the 
payments. The following paragraphs 
discuss each of the policy alternatives 
listed in Table VI.1. (See the chapter 17 
of the SNOPR TSD.) 

No New Regulatory Action. The case 
in which no regulatory action is taken 
with regard to CCWs constitutes the 
‘‘base case’’ (or ‘‘No Action’’) scenario. 
In this case, between 2013 and 2043, 
CCWs are expected to use 0.97 quads of 
primary energy along with 2.2 trillion 
gallons of water. Since this is the base 
case, energy savings and NPV are zero 
by definition. 

Consumer Rebates. Consumer rebates 

cover a portion of the incremental 
installed cost difference between 
equipment meeting baseline efficiency 
levels and those meeting higher 
efficiency levels, which generally result 
in a higher percentage of consumers 
purchasing more efficient models. DOE 
utilized market penetration curves from 
a study that analyzed the potential of 
energy efficiency in California.42 The 
penetration curves are a function of 
benefit-cost ratio (i.e., lifetime operating 
costs savings divided by increased total 
installed costs) to estimate the increased 
market share of more efficient 
equipment given incentives by a rebate 
program. Using specific rebate amounts, 
DOE calculated, for the considered 
equipment, the benefit-cost ratio of the 
more efficient appliance with and

Energy Surplus: The Potential for Energy Efficiency

Hewlett Foundation by Xenergy, Inc.) (2002). 

without the rebate to project the 
increased market penetration of the 
equipment due to a rebate program. 

For CCWs meeting TSL 3, DOE 

estimated that the percentage of 
consumers purchasing the more 
efficient equipment due to consumer 
rebates would increase annually by 49.0 
percent for top-loading washers and 4.0 
percent for front-loading washers. DOE 
selected the rebate amount using data 
from rebate programs for CCWs 
conducted by 24 gas, electric, and water 
utilities and other agencies. DOE 
estimated that the impact of this policy 
would be to permanently transform the 
market so that the increased market 
share seen in the first year of the 
program would be maintained 
throughout the forecast period. At the 
estimated participation rates, consumer 
rebates would be expected to provide 
0.06 quads of national energy savings, 
74 billion gallons of national water 
savings, and an NPV of $0.18 billion (at 
a 7-percent discount rate). 

Although DOE estimated that 
consumer rebates would provide 
national benefits for CCW consumers, 
these benefits would be smaller than the 
benefits resulting from national 
performance standards at today’s 
proposed levels. Thus, DOE rejected 
consumer rebates as a policy alternative 
to national performance standards. 

Consumer Tax Credits. Consumer tax 

credits cover a percentage of the 
incremental installed cost difference 
between equipment meeting baseline 
efficiency levels and those with higher 
efficiencies. Consumer tax credits are 
considered a viable non-regulatory 
market transformation program as 
evidenced by the inclusion of Federal 
consumer tax credits in EPACT 2005 for 
various residential appliances. (Section 
1333 of EPACT 2005; codified at 26 
U.S.C. 25C) DOE reviewed the market 

impact of tax credits offered by the 
Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) 
(ODOE, No. 35 at p. 1) and Montana 
Department of Revenue (MDR) (MDR, 
No. 36 at p. 1) to estimate the effect of 
a national tax credit program. To help 
estimate the impacts from such a 
program, DOE also reviewed analyses 
prepared for the California Public 
Utilities Commission,43 the Northwest 
Energy Efficiency Alliance,44 and the 
Energy Foundation/Hewlett 
Foundation.45 For each the equipment 
considered for this rulemaking, DOE 
estimated that the market effect of a tax 
credit program would gradually increase 
over a time period until it reached its 
maximum impact. Once the tax credit 
program attained its maximum effect, 
DOE assumed the impact of the policy 
would be to permanently transform the 
market at this level. 

For CCWs, DOE estimated that 

consumer tax credits would induce an 
increase of 1.3 percent in 2013 in the 
purchase of equipment meeting TSL 3 
and eventually increase to a maximum 
of 5.8 percent in 2020 for both top- 
loading and front-loading washers.46 At 
the estimated participation rates, 
consumer tax credits would be expected 
to provide 0.01 quads of national energy

46 Because DOE was not able to identify consumer 

tax credit programs specific to CCWs, increased 
market penetrations for residential clothes washers 
were used to estimate the impact from a tax credit 
program providing incentives for more efficient 
CCWs.

savings, 13 billion gallons of national 
water savings, and an NPV of $0.03 
billion (at a 7-percent discount rate). 

DOE estimated that while consumer 

tax credits would yield national benefits 
for CCW consumers, these benefits 
would be much smaller than the 
benefits from today’s proposed national 
performance standards. Thus, DOE 
rejected consumer tax credits as a policy 
alternative to national performance 
standards. 

Manufacturer Tax Credits. 

Manufacturer tax credits are considered 
a viable non-regulatory market 
transformation program as evidenced by 
the inclusion of Federal tax credits in 
EPACT 2005 for manufacturers of 
residential appliances. (Section 1334 of 
EPACT 2005; codified at 26 U.S.C. 45M) 
Similar to consumer tax credits, 
manufacturer tax credits would 
effectively result in lower equipment 
prices to consumers by an amount that 
covered part of the incremental price 
difference between equipment meeting 
baseline efficiency levels and those 
meeting higher efficiency levels. 
Because these tax credits go to 
manufacturers instead of consumers, 
research indicates that fewer consumers 
would be affected by a manufacturer tax 
credit program than by consumer tax 
credits.47 48 Although consumers would 
benefit from price reductions passed 
through to them by the manufacturers, 
research demonstrates that 
approximately half the consumers who 
would benefit from a consumer tax 
credit program would be aware of the 
economic benefits of more efficient 
technologies included in an appliance 
manufacturer tax credit program. In 
other words, research estimates that half 
of the effect from a consumer tax credit 
program is due to publicly available 
information or promotions announcing 
the benefits of the program. This effect, 
referred to as the ‘‘announcement 
effect,’’ is not part of a manufacturer tax 
credit program. Therefore, DOE 
estimated that the effect of a 
manufacturer tax credit program would 
be only half of the maximum impact of 
a consumer tax credit program. 

As described earlier in section III.E.2 
on the NIA, DOE analyzed the impact of 
recent Federal manufacturer tax credits 
on increased sales of high efficiency

Use Forecasting Group. Analysis of Tax Credits for 
Efficient Equipment (1997). Available at http:// 
enduse.lbl.gov/Projects/TaxCredits.html. (Last 
accessed April 24, 2008.) 

CCWs. DOE determined that the tax 
credits have increased the market share 
of front-loading washers from 
approximately 20 percent in the year 
2005 to its current market share of 30 
percent. For purposes of conducting the 
NIA, DOE estimated that the tax credits 
would permanently transform the 
market so that front-loading washers 
would continue to comprise 30 percent 
of the market over the entire forecast 
period, even though the tax credits are 
set to expire after 2010. For purposes of 
analyzing the impact of manufacturer 
tax credits for the RIA, DOE estimated 
the percentage of consumers purchasing 
equipment at TSL 3 would be expected 
to increase by 2.9 percent for both top- 
loading and front-loading washers. This 
additional increase of 2.9 percent is 
relative to the base case (i.e., the case 
without new efficiency standards) 
which is comprised of a 30 percent 
market share of front-loading washers 
and a 70 percent market share of top- 
loading washers. DOE assumed that the 
impact of the manufacturer tax credit 
policy would be to permanently 
transform the market so that the 
increased market share seen in the first 
year of the program would be 
maintained throughout the forecast 
period. 

At the above estimated participation 
rates, manufacturer tax credits would 
provide 0.005 quads of national energy 
savings, 9 billion gallons of national 
water savings, and an NPV of $0.02 
billion (at a 7-percent discount rate) for 
CCWs. 

DOE estimated that while 

manufacturer tax credits would yield 
national benefits for CCW consumers, 
these benefits would be much smaller 
than the benefits from national 
performance standards. Thus, DOE 
rejected manufacturer tax credits as a 
policy alternative to today’s proposed 
national performance standards. 

Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targets. 
DOE estimated the impact of voluntary 
energy efficiency targets by reviewing 
the historical and projected market 
transformation performance of past and 
current ENERGY STAR programs. 
To estimate the impacts from a 

voluntary energy efficiency program 
targeting the adoption of top-loading 
CCWs meeting TSL 3, DOE evaluated 
the potential impacts of expanding the 
Federal government’s existing ENERGY 
STAR program for CCWs. DOE modeled 
the voluntary efficiency program based 
on the ENERGY STAR program’s 
experience with RCWs.49 50 Over the 

49 Data were not available on the market impacts 

of the CCW program. 

50 Sanchez et al., op. cit. 

period spanning 2007–2025, ENERGY 
STAR projected that the market share of 
RCWs meeting target efficiency levels 
due to ENERGY STAR will increase to 
a maximum of 28 percent. DOE 
estimated that an expanded voluntary 
program would increase their market 
share by half of these projected annual 
amounts for the existing ENERGY STAR 
program, reaching a maximum of 14 
percent increased market share. For 
CCWs, DOE assumed that the impacts of 
the existing ENERGY STAR program 
were already incorporated in the base 
case, and applied the same pattern of 
market share increase from an expanded 
voluntary program to CCWs beginning 
in 2013. After attaining its maximum 
market share of 14 percent in the year 
2030, DOE’s analysis maintained that 
market share throughout the remainder 
of the forecast period. DOE estimated 
that an expanded program of voluntary 
energy efficiency targets would be 
expected to provide 0.02 quads of 
national energy savings, 24 billion 
gallons of national water savings, and an 
NPV of $0.06 billion (at a 7-percent 
discount rate). Although this program 
would provide national benefits, they 
were estimated to be smaller than the 
benefits resulting from today’s proposed 
national performance standards. Thus, 
DOE rejected the use of voluntary 
energy efficiency targets as a policy 
alternative to national performance 
standards. 

DOE did not analyze the potential 

impacts of voluntary energy efficiency 
targets for front-loading CCWs because a 
vast majority of equipment already 
meets today’s proposed standards. In 
the case of front-loading CCWs, over 96 
percent of the market meets TSL 3. The 
ENERGY STAR program typically 
targets equipment where a maximum of 
approximately 25 percent of the existing 
market meets the target efficiency 
level.51 Since the market for front- 
loading CCWs is well above the 25 
percent threshold, DOE did not consider 
this approach for this equipment class. 

Early Replacement. The early 

replacement policy alternative envisions 
a program to replace old, inefficient 
units with models meeting efficiency 
levels higher than baseline equipment. 
Under an early replacement program, 
State governments or electric and gas 
utilities would provide financial 
incentives to consumers to retire the 
appliance early in order to hasten the 
adoption of more efficient equipment. 
For all of the considered equipment,

57797 

DOE modeled this policy by applying a 
4-percent increase in the replacement 
rate above the natural rate of 
replacement for failed equipment. DOE 
based this percentage increase on 
program experience with the early 
replacement of appliances in the State 
of Connecticut.52 DOE assumed the 
program would continue for as long as 
it would take to ensure that the eligible 
existing stock in the year that the 
program began (2013) was completely 
replaced. 

For CCWs, this policy alternative 
would replace old, inefficient top- 
loading and front-loading units with 
models meeting the efficiency levels in 
TSL 3. DOE estimated that such an early 
replacement program would be 
expected to provide 0.01 quads of 
national energy savings, 9 billion 
gallons of national water savings, and an 
NPV of $0.11 billion (at a 7-percent 
discount rate). 

Although DOE estimated that the 

above early replacement programs for 
CCWs would provide national benefits, 
they would be much smaller than the 
benefits resulting from national 
performance standards. Thus, DOE 
rejected early replacement incentives as 
a policy alternative to national 
performance standards. 

Bulk Government Purchases. Under 
this policy alternative, the government 
sector would be encouraged to shift 
their purchases to equipment that meets 
the target efficiency levels above 
baseline levels. Aggregating public 
sector demand could provide a market 
signal to manufacturers and vendors 
that some of their largest customers 
sought suppliers with equipment that 
met an efficiency target at favorable 
prices. This program also could induce 
‘‘market pull’’ impacts through 
manufacturers and vendors achieving 
economies of scale for high-efficiency 
equipment. Under such a program, DOE 
would assume that Federal, State, and 
local government agencies would 
administer it. At the Federal level, such 
a program would add more efficient 
equipment for which the Federal Energy 
Management Program (FEMP) has 
energy efficient procurement 
specifications.

For CCWs, this program would 

encourage the government sector to shift 
its purchases to top-loading units that 
meet the efficiency levels in TSL 3. DOE 
estimated that this policy would apply 
to multi-family buildings that are 
government-owned. Based on a 
technology review prepared for FEMP 
by Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory (PNNL), approximately 7000 
CCWs (representing a 3.2 percent 
market share) were purchased in the 
year 2000 for Federal buildings.53 Based 
on research of the effectiveness of bulk 
government purchasing programs, DOE 
estimated that the market share of more 
efficient CCWs in Federally owned 
multi-family buildings would increase 
at a rate of 8 percent per year over a 10- 
year period (2013–2022) and remain at 
the 2022 level for the remainder of the 
forecast period. DOE estimated that bulk 
government purchases would be 
expected to provide 0.003 quads of 
national energy savings, 7 billion 
gallons of national water savings, and an 
NPV of $0.02 billion (at a 7-percent 
discount rate), benefits which would be 
much smaller than those estimated for 
today’s proposed national performance 
standards. Thus, DOE rejected bulk 
government purchases as a policy 
alternative to national performance 
standards. 

DOE did not analyze the potential 

impacts of bulk government purchases 
for front-loading CCWs because the vast 
majority of equipment already meets 
today’s proposed standards. In the case 
of front-loading CCWs, over 96 percent 
of the market meets TSL 3. FEMP 
procurement specifications typically 
promote equipment in the top 25 
percent of the existing equipment 
offerings in terms of efficiency. Since 
most of the front-loading CCWs sold in 
the base case already comply with such 
specifications, DOE was not able to 
consider this program as a source of 
data for top-loading CCWs. 

National Performance Standards (TSL 

3). As indicated in the paragraphs 
above, none of the alternatives DOE 
examined would save as much energy as 
today’s proposed energy conservation 
standards. Therefore, DOE will adopt 
the efficiency levels listed in section 
V.C.

B. Review Under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 

U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires preparation 
of an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis for any rule that by law must 
be proposed for public comment, unless 
the agency certifies that the rule, if 
promulgated, will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. As required by 
Executive Order 13272, Proper 
Consideration of Small Entities in 
Agency Rulemaking, 67 FR 53461 (Aug. 
16, 2002), DOE published procedures 
and policies on February 19, 2003, to 
ensure that the potential impacts of its 
rules on small entities are properly 
considered during the rulemaking 
process. 68 FR 7990. DOE has made its 
procedures and policies available on the 
Office of General Counsel’s Web site: 
http://www.gc.doe.gov. 

DOE reviewed today’s supplemental 

notice under the provisions of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act and the 
procedures and policies published on 
February 19, 2003. 68 FR 7990. A 
regulatory flexibility analysis examines 
the impact of the rule on small entities 
and considers alternative ways of 
reducing negative impacts. DOE 
identified producers of all equipment 
covered by this rulemaking that have 
manufacturing facilities located within 
the United States. DOE then looked at 
publicly available data and contacted 
manufacturers, where needed, to 
determine if they meet the SBA’s 
definition of a small manufacturing 
facility. 

For the manufacturers of equipment 

covered by this rulemaking, the SBA has 
set two size thresholds that define 
which entities are ‘‘small businesses’’ 
for the purposes of the statute. See 
http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/ 
documents/sba_homepage/ 
serv_sstd_tablepdf. Because all CCW 
manufacturers also produce RCWs, 
limits for both categories are presented 
in Table VI.2. DOE used these small 
business definitions to determine 
whether any small entities would be 
required to comply with the rule. (65 FR 
30836, 30848 (May 15, 2000), as 
amended at 65 FR 53533, 53544 
(September 5, 2000) and codified at 13 
CFR part 121.) The size standards are 
listed by NAICS code and industry 
description.

The CCW industry consists of three 

principal competitors that make up 
almost 100 percent of the market share. 
Two of them are high-volume, 
diversified appliance manufacturers, 
while the third is a focused laundry 
equipment manufacturer. Before issuing 
this SNOPR, DOE interviewed all major 
CCW manufacturers. Because all CCW 
manufacturers also make RCWs, DOE 
also considered whether a CCW 
manufacturer could be considered a 
small business entity in that industry. 
None of the CCW manufacturers fall 
into any small business category. As a 
result, DOE certifies that today’s SNOPR 
would not have a significant impact on 
a substantial number of small entities 
and that a regulatory flexibility analysis 
is not required. 
C. Review Under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act 

DOE stated in the October 2008 NOPR 

that this rulemaking would impose no 
new information and recordkeeping 
requirements, and that OMB clearance 
is not required under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 
73 FR 62034, 62130 (Oct. 17, 2008). 
DOE received no comments on this in 
response to the October 2008 NOPR. 
Therefore, for today’s supplemental 
notice DOE has concluded that Office of 
Management and Budget clearance is 
not required under the PRA. 
D. Review Under the National 
Environmental Policy Act 

DOE has prepared a draft 

environmental assessment (EA) of the 
impacts of the supplemental notice 
pursuant to the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.), the regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 
1500–1508), and DOE’s regulations for 
compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act (10 CFR part 
1021). This assessment includes an 
examination of the potential effects of 
emission reductions likely to result from 
the rule in the context of global climate 
change, as well as other types of 
environmental impacts. The draft EA 
has been incorporated into the TSD; the 
environmental impact analyses are 
contained primarily in chapter 16 of 
that document. Before issuing a final 
rule for CCWs, DOE will consider public 
comments and, as appropriate, 

determine whether to issue a finding of 
no significant impact as part of a final 
EA or to prepare an environmental 
impact statement (EIS) for this 
rulemaking. 
E. Review Under Executive Order 13132 
Executive Order 13132, ‘‘Federalism,’’ 

64 FR 43255 (Aug. 4, 1999) imposes 
certain requirements on agencies 
formulating and implementing policies 
or regulations that preempt State law or 
that have Federalism implications. The 
Executive Order requires agencies to 
examine the constitutional and statutory 
authority supporting any action that 
would limit the policymaking discretion 
of the States and to carefully assess the 
necessity for such actions. The 
Executive Order also requires agencies 
to have an accountable process to 
ensure meaningful and timely input by 
State and local officials in the 
development of regulatory policies that 
have Federalism implications. On 
March 14, 2000, DOE published a 
statement of policy describing the 
intergovernmental consultation process 
it will follow in the development of 
such regulations. 65 FR 13735. DOE has 
examined today’s supplemental notice 
and has determined that it would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. EPCA governs and 
prescribes Federal preemption of State 
regulations as to energy conservation for 
the equipment that is the subject of 
today’s supplemental notice. States can 
petition DOE for exemption from such 
preemption to the extent, and based on 
criteria, set forth in EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 
6297(d) and 6316(b)(2)(D)) No further 
action is required by Executive Order 
13132. 
F. Review Under Executive Order 12988 
With respect to the review of existing 

regulations and the promulgation of 
new regulations, section 3(a) of 
Executive Order 12988, ‘‘Civil Justice 
Reform’’ (61 FR 4729 (Feb. 7, 1996)) 
imposes on Federal agencies the general 
duty to adhere to the following 
requirements: (1) Eliminate drafting 
errors and ambiguity; (2) write 
regulations to minimize litigation; and 
(3) provide a clear legal standard for 

affected conduct rather than a general 
standard and promote simplification 
and burden reduction. Section 3(b) of 
Executive Order 12988 specifically 
requires that Executive agencies make 
every reasonable effort to ensure that the 
regulation: (1) Clearly specifies the 
preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly 
specifies any effect on existing Federal 
law or regulation; (3) provides a clear 
legal standard for affected conduct 
while promoting simplification and 
burden reduction; (4) specifies the 
retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately 
defines key terms; and (6) addresses 
other important issues affecting clarity 
and general draftsmanship under any 
guidelines issued by the Attorney 
General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 
12988 requires Executive agencies to 
review regulations in light of applicable 
standards in section 3(a) and section 
3(b) to determine whether they are met 
or it is unreasonable to meet one or 
more of them. DOE has completed the 
required review and determined that, to 
the extent permitted by law, today’s 
supplemental notice meets the relevant 
standards of Executive Order 12988. 
G. Review Under the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 

DOE reviewed this regulatory action 

under title II of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4) 
(UMRA), which requires each Federal 
agency to assess the effects of Federal 
regulatory actions on State, local and 
Tribal governments and the private 
sector. For a proposed regulatory action 
likely to result in a rule that may cause 
the expenditure by State, local, and 
Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or 
by the private sector of $100 million or 
more in any one year (adjusted for 
inflation), section 202 of UMRA requires 
an agency to publish a written statement 
assessing the costs, benefits, and other 
effects of the rule on the national 
economy. (2 U.S.C. 1532(a), (b)) The 
UMRA also requires a Federal agency to 
develop an effective process to permit 
timely input by elected officers of State, 
local, and Tribal governments on a 
proposed ‘‘significant intergovernmental 
mandate,’’ and requires an agency plan 
for giving notice and opportunity for 
timely input to potentially affected 
small governments before establishing 
any requirements that might 
significantly or uniquely affect small

governments. On March 18, 1997, DOE 
published a statement of policy on its 
process for intergovernmental 
consultation under UMRA (62 FR 
12820) (also available at http:// 
www.gc.doe.gov). Although today’s 
supplemental notice does not contain a 
Federal intergovernmental mandate, it 
may impose expenditures of $100 
million or more on the private sector, 
although DOE believes such 
expenditures are likely to be less than 
$50 million. 

Section 202 of UMRA authorizes an 

agency to respond to the content 
requirements of UMRA in any other 
statement or analysis that accompanies 
the supplemental notice. 2 U.S.C. 
1532(c). The content requirements of 
section 202(b) of UMRA relevant to a 
private sector mandate substantially 
overlap the economic analysis 
requirements that apply under section 
325(o) of EPCA and Executive Order 
12866. The Supplementary Information 
section of this supplemental notice and 
the ‘‘Regulatory Impact Analysis’’ 
section of the SNOPR TSD respond to 
those requirements. 

Under section 205 of UMRA, DOE is 

obligated to identify and consider a 
reasonable number of regulatory 
alternatives before promulgating a rule 
for which a written statement under 
section 202 is required. DOE is required 
to select from those alternatives the 
most cost-effective and least 
burdensome alternative that achieves 
the objectives of the rule unless DOE 
publishes an explanation for doing 
otherwise or the selection of such an 
alternative is inconsistent with law. As 
required by 42 U.S.C. 6295(h) and (o), 
6313(e), and 6316(a), today’s 
supplemental notice would establish 
energy conservation standards for CCWs 
that are designed to achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that DOE has determined to 
be both technologically feasible and 
economically justified. A full discussion 
of the alternatives considered by DOE is 
presented in the ‘‘Regulatory Impact 
Analysis’’ section of the TSD for today’s 
supplemental notice. 
H. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 1999 

DOE determined that, for this 

rulemaking, it need not prepare a 
Family Policymaking Assessment under 
section 654 of the Treasury and General 
Government Appropriations Act, 1999 
(Pub. L. 105–277). Id. DOE received no 
comments concerning section 654 in 
response to the October 2008 NOPR, 
and, therefore, takes no further action in 

today’s supplemental notice with 
respect to this provision. 
I. Review Under Executive Order 12630 

DOE determined, under Executive 
Order 12630, ‘‘Governmental Actions 
and Interference with Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights,’’ 53 FR 8859 
(March 18, 1988), that the October 2008 
NOPR would not result in any takings 
which might require compensation 
under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. 73 FR 62034, 62131 (Oct. 
17, 2008). DOE received no comments 
concerning Executive Order 12630 in 
response to the October 2008 NOPR, 
and, today’s supplemental notice, which 
adopts no new requirements, also would 
not result in any takings which might 
require compensation under the Fifth 
Amendment. Therefore, DOE takes no 
further action in today’s supplemental 
notice with respect to this Executive 
Order. 
J. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2001 

Section 515 of the Treasury and 

General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516 note) provides 
for agencies to review most 
disseminations of information to the 
public under guidelines established by 
each agency pursuant to general 
guidelines issued by OMB. The OMB 
guidelines were published at 67 FR 
8452 (Feb. 22, 2002), and DOE’s 
guidelines were published at 67 FR 
62446 (Oct. 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed 
this notice under the OMB and DOE 
guidelines and has concluded that it is 
consistent with applicable policies in 
those guidelines. 
K. Review Under Executive Order 13211 

Executive Order 13211, ‘‘Actions 

Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use,’’ 66 FR 28355 (May 
22, 2001) requires Federal agencies to 
prepare and submit to the OIRA a 
Statement of Energy Effects for any 
significant energy action. For the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE determined 
that the proposed rule, which set energy 
conservation standards for commercial 
clothes washers, was not a ‘‘significant 
energy action’’ within the meaning of 
Executive Order 13211. 73 FR 62034, 
62132 (Oct. 17, 2008). The rule was also 
not designated as such by OIRA. 
Accordingly, it did not prepare a 
Statement of Energy Effects on that 
proposed rule. DOE received no 
comments on this issue in response to 
the October 2008 NOPR. As with the 
October 2008 NOPR, DOE has 
concluded that today’s supplemental

notice is not a significant energy action 
within the meaning of Executive Order 
13211, and OIRA has not designated the 
rule as such. As a result, DOE has not 
prepared a Statement of Energy Effects 
on the rule. 
L. Review Under the Information 
Quality Bulletin for Peer Review 

On December 16, 2004, the OMB, in 
consultation with the Office of Science 
and Technology, issued its Final 
Information Quality Bulletin for Peer 
Review (the Bulletin). 70 FR 2664 (Jan. 
14, 2005). The purpose of the Bulletin 
is to enhance the quality and credibility 
of the Government’s scientific 
information. The Bulletin establishes 
that certain scientific information shall 
be peer reviewed by qualified specialists 
before it is disseminated by the Federal 
Government. As indicated in the 
October 2008 NOPR, this includes 
influential scientific information related 
to agency regulatory actions, such as the 
analyses in this rulemaking. 73 FR 
62034, 62132 (Oct. 17, 2008). 

As more fully set forth in the October 

2008 NOPR, DOE held formal in- 
progress peer reviews of the types of 
analyses and processes that DOE has 
used to develop the energy conservation 
standards in today’s supplemental 
notice, and issued a report on these peer 
reviews. Id. 
VII. Public Participation 
A. Attendance at Public Meeting 

DOE will hold a public meeting on 

November 16, 2009 from 9 a.m. until 5

and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, 
except Federal holidays. Requests may 
also be sent by mail or e-mail to: 
Brenda.Edwards@ee.doe.gov. 

Persons requesting to speak should 

briefly describe the nature of their 
interest in this rulemaking and provide 
a telephone number for contact. DOE 
requests persons scheduled to be heard 
to submit an advance copy of their 
statements at least two weeks before the 
public meeting. At its discretion, DOE 
may permit any person who cannot 
supply an advance copy of their 
statement to participate, if that person 
has made advance alternative 
arrangements with the Building 
Technologies Program. The request to 
give an oral presentation should ask for 
such alternative arrangements. 
C. Conduct of Public Meeting 

DOE will designate a DOE official to 
preside at the public meeting and may 
also use a professional facilitator to aid 
discussion. The meeting will not be a 
judicial or evidentiary-type public 
hearing, but DOE will conduct it in 
accordance with section 336 of EPCA, 
42 U.S.C. 6306. A court reporter will be 
present to record the proceedings and 
prepare a transcript. DOE reserves the 
right to schedule the order of 
presentations and to establish the 
procedures governing the conduct of the 
public meeting. After the public 
meeting, interested parties may submit 
further comments on the proceedings as 
well as on any aspect of the rulemaking 
until the end of the comment period. 

The public meeting will be conducted 

in an informal, conference style. DOE 
will present summaries of comments 
received before the public meeting, 
allow time for presentations by 
participants, and encourage all 
interested parties to share their views on 
issues affecting this rulemaking. Each 
participant will be allowed to make a 
prepared general statement (within time 
limits determined by DOE), before the 
discussion of specific topics. DOE will 
permit other participants to comment 
briefly on any general statements. 

At the end of all prepared statements 
on a topic, DOE will permit participants 
to clarify their statements briefly and 
comment on statements made by others. 
Participants should be prepared to 
answer questions by DOE and by other 
participants concerning these issues. 
DOE representatives may also ask 
questions of participants concerning 
other matters relevant to this 
rulemaking. The official conducting the 
public meeting will accept additional 
comments or questions from those

public meeting. 

DOE will make the entire record of 

this proposed rulemaking, including the 
transcript from the public meeting, 
available for inspection at the U.S. 
Department of Energy, Resource Room 
of the Building Technologies Program, 
950 L’Enfant Plaza, SW., Suite 600,

transcript from the transcribing reporter. 
D. Submission of Comments 

DOE will accept comments, data, and 
information regarding the proposed rule 
before or after the public meeting, but 
no later than the date provided at the 
beginning of this SNOPR. Information 
submitted should be identified by 
docket number EE–2006–STD–0127 
and/or RIN 1904–AB93. Comments, 
data, and information submitted to 
DOE’s e-mail address for this 
rulemaking should be provided in 
WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, PDF, or 
text (ASCII) file format. Interested 
parties should avoid the use of special 
characters or any form of encryption 
and, wherever possible, comments 
should carry the electronic signature of 
the author. Comments, data, and 
information submitted to DOE via mail 
or hand delivery/courier should include 
one signed original paper copy. No 
telefacsimiles (faxes) will be accepted. 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 1004.11, any 

person submitting information that he 
or she believes to be confidential and 
exempt by law from public disclosure 
should submit two copies: One copy of 
the document including all the 
information believed to be confidential, 
and one copy of the document with the 
information believed to be confidential 
deleted. DOE will make its own 
determination about the confidential 
status of the information and treat it 
according to its determination. 

Factors of interest to DOE when 

evaluating requests to treat submitted 
information as confidential include: (1) 
A description of the items; (2) whether 
and why such items are customarily 
treated as confidential within the 
industry; (3) whether the information is 
generally known by or available from 
other sources; (4) whether the 
information has previously been made 
available to others without obligation 
concerning its confidentiality; (5) an 
explanation of the competitive injury to 
the submitting person which would 

result from public disclosure; (6) when 
such information might lose its 
confidential character due to the 
passage of time; and (7) why disclosure 
of the information would be contrary to 
the public interest. 
E. Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment 

DOE is particularly interested in 
receiving comments and views of 
interested parties concerning: 

(1) Whether the method of ‘‘loading’’ 

clothes washers, or any other 
characteristic commonly associated 
with traditional ‘‘top-loading’’ or ‘‘front- 
loading’’ clothes washers, are ‘‘features’’ 
within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(4) in EPCA and whether the 
availability of such feature(s) would 
likely be affected by eliminating the 
separate classes for these equipment 
types previously established by DOE; 

(2) The revised efficiency levels, 

including the revised max-tech level for 
top-loading CCWs; 

(3) Technological feasibility of the 
proposed max-tech CCW, including 
washing and rinsing performance 
measures for CCWs and population data 
for water heating CCWs; 

(4) The determination of short- and 
long-run price elasticities of demand 
and cross price elasticities for top- 
loading vs. front-loading CCWs and 
used vs. front-loading CCWs; 

(5) The determination of manufacturer 

impacts, including the effects of 
manufacturer tax credits and 
competitive concerns; 

(6) The determination of 

environmental impacts; and 

(7) The newly proposed energy 

conservation standards. 
VIII. Approval of the Office of the 
Secretary 

The Secretary of Energy has approved 

publication of this proposed rule.
