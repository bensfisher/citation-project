Energy Conservation Program: Energy 
Conservation Standards for General 
Service Fluorescent Lamps and 
Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy, Department of 
Energy. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. 
SUMMARY: The Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act (EPCA) prescribes 
energy conservation standards for 
various consumer products and 
commercial and industrial equipment, 
including general service fluorescent 
lamps (GSFL) and incandescent 
reflector lamps (IRL), and the statute 
also requires the Department of Energy 
(DOE) to subsequently determine 
whether more stringent, amended 
standards for GSFL and IRL would be 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and would save 
a significant amount of energy. In 
addition, EPCA directs DOE to consider 
adoption of standards for additional 
GSFL not already covered by EPCA- 
prescribed standards. In this notice, 
DOE proposes amended energy 
conservation standards for certain GSFL 
and IRL and new energy conservation 
standards for certain additional GSFL 
not currently covered by standards. 
DATES: DOE held a public meeting on 
Tuesday, February 3, 2009 in 
Washington, DC. DOE began accepting 
comments, data, and information 
regarding this notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NOPR) at the public 
meeting, and will continue to accept 
comments until no later than June 12, 
2009. See section VIII, ‘‘Public

I. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
The Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (EPCA or the Act) (42 U.S.C. 6291 
et seq.), as amended, requires DOE to 
consider whether to amend the existing 
energy conservation standards for GSFL 
and IRL, and to also consider whether 
to adopt new energy conservation 
standards for additional types of GSFL 
beyond those already covered by EPCA- 
prescribed standards. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(3)–(5)) The Act also specifies 
that any new or amended energy 
conservation standard DOE prescribes 
for certain consumer and/or commercial 
products, such as GSFL and IRL, shall 
be designed to ‘‘achieve the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency * * * 
which the Secretary determines is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A); 6316(a)) Furthermore, the 
new or amended standard must ‘‘result 
in significant conservation of energy.’’ 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B); 6316(a)) In 
accordance with these and other 
statutory provisions discussed in this 
notice, DOE proposes new and amended 
energy conservation standards for GSFL 
and IRL, as shown in Table I.1 and 
Table I.2. The proposed standards 
would apply to all products listed in 
Table I.1 and Table I.2 that are 
manufactured in or imported into the 
United States on or after June 30, 2012.

Note: P is equal to the rated lamp wattage, in watts. 
DOE’s analyses indicate that the 
proposed standards would save a 
significant amount of energy—an 
estimated 3.2 to 7.3 quads (for GSFL) 
and 1.3 to 2.3 quads (for IRL) of 
cumulative energy over 31 years (2012– 
2042). The economic impacts on most 
GSFL and all IRL individual and 
commercial consumers (i.e., the average 
life-cycle cost (LCC) savings) are 
positive. 
The cumulative national net present 
value (NPV) of total consumer costs and 
savings of the proposed standards from 
2012 to 2042 in 2007$ ranges from $3.2 
billion (at a 7-percent discount rate) to 
$25.7 billion (at a 3-percent discount 
rate) for GSFL. For IRL, the NPV from 
2012 to 2042 in 2007$ ranges from $3.7 
billion (at a 7-percent discount rate) to 
$14.0 billion (at a 3-percent discount 
rate). This is the estimated total value of 
future operating-cost savings minus the 
estimated increased product costs, 
discounted to 2007. DOE estimates the 
GSFL industry net present value (INPV) 
to currently be $575–602 million in 
2007$. If DOE were to adopt the 
proposed standards, it expects that 
manufacturers may lose up to 24 
percent of their INPV, which is 
approximately $139 million. The NPV 
of the proposed standards for GSFL 
consumers (at least $3.2 billion at the 7- 
percent discount rate) would exceed 
anticipated industry losses by at least 23 
times. DOE estimates the IRL industry 
net present value to be $207–267 
million in 2007$. If DOE were to adopt 
the proposed standards, it expects that 
manufacturers may lose 29–46 percent 
of their INPV, which is approximately 
$77–94 million. The NPV of the 
proposed standards for IRL consumers 
(at least $3.7 billion at the 7-percent 
discount rate) would exceed anticipated 
industry losses by at least 39 times. 
In addition, the proposed standards 
would have significant environmental 
benefits. All of the energy saved would 
be in the form of electricity, and DOE 
expects the energy savings from the 
proposed standards to eliminate the 
need for approximately 1100 to 3400 
megawatts (MW) of generating capacity 
for GSFL and up to 450 MW for IRL by 
2042. This would result in cumulative 
(undiscounted) greenhouse gas emission 
reductions of 184 to 395 million metric 
tons (MMT) of carbon dioxide (CO2) for 
GSFL and 59 to 114 MMT for IRL from 
2012 to 2042. During this same period, 
the standard would result in power 
plant emission reductions of 12 to 623 
kilotons (kt) of nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
for GSFL and 4 to 181 kt NOX for IRL. 
Mercury (Hg) emission reductions 
would be up to 6.9 tons for GFSL and 
up to 1.7 tons avoided for IRL. 
DOE has tentatively concluded that 
the proposed standards represent the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified, and 
would result in significant conservation 
of energy. DOE further notes that 
products achieving these standard levels 
are already commercially available. 
Based upon the rulemaking analyses 
culminating in this proposal, DOE 
found that the benefits (energy savings, 
consumer LCC savings, national NPV 
increase, and emission reductions) to 
the Nation of the proposed standards 
outweigh the burdens (INPV decrease 
and LCC increases for some lamp users). 
DOE considered higher efficacy levels 
(ELs) as trial standard levels (TSLs), and 
is still considering them in this 
rulemaking; however, DOE has 
tentatively concluded that the burdens 
of the higher efficiency levels outweigh 
the benefits. Based upon consideration 
of public comments and related 
information, DOE may adopt either 
higher or lower ELs presented in this 
proposal or some level in between. 
II. Introduction 
A. Consumer Overview 
EPCA currently prescribes efficacy 
standards for certain IRL and GSFL. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)) DOE proposes to raise 
these standards and to set efficacy 
standards for certain other GSFL, as 
shown in Table I.1 and Table I.2 above. 
The proposed standards would apply to 
products manufactured in the United 
States, or imported to it, three years 
after the final rule is published in the 
Federal Register.1 Table I.1 and Table 
I.2 also show the percentage 
improvement in efficacy that each 
standard level represents, relative to the 
current standard levels or to products 
typically on the market today. The 
proposed standards represent an overall 
improvement of approximately 4 to 22 
percent and 7 to 100 percent in the 
efficacies of the GSFL and IRL baselines, 
respectively, covered by the standards. 
DOE’s analyses suggest that 
residential and commercial consumers 
would see benefits from the proposed 
standards. Although DOE expects that 
under the proposed standards, the 
purchase price of high-efficacy GSFL 
would be higher (up to three times 
higher) than the average price of these 
products today, but that the energy 
efficiency gains would result in lower 
energy costs that more than offset such 
higher costs. When the potential savings 
due to efficiency gains are summed over 
the lifetime of the high-efficacy 
products, consumers would be expected 
to save up to $56.60 (depending on the 
lamp type), on average, compared to 
their expenditures on today’s baseline 
GSFL. 
The results of DOE’s analyses for IRL 
follow a similar pattern. Although DOE 
expects the purchase price of the high- 
efficacy IRL would be higher (ranging 
from 56 to 63 percent) than the average 
price of these products today, the energy 
efficiency gains would result in lower 
energy costs that more than offset the 
higher costs. When these potential

efficacy IRL, it is estimated that 
consumers would save between $1.62

B. Authority 
Title III of EPCA sets forth a variety 
of provisions designed to improve 
energy efficiency. Part A 2 of Title III (42 
U.S.C. 6291–6309) established the 
‘‘Energy Conservation Program for 
Consumer Products Other Than 
Automobiles.’’ The program covers 
consumer products and certain 
commercial products (referred to 
hereafter as ‘‘covered products’’), 
including GSFL and IRL. (42 U.S.C. 
6292(a)(14) and 6295(i)) EPCA 
prescribes energy conservation 
standards for certain GSFL and IRL. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)) The statute further 
directs DOE to determine whether the 
existing standards for fluorescent and 
incandescent lamps should be amended 
and whether to adopt standards for 
additional GSFL. (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(3)– 
(5)) This rulemaking represents the first 
round of amendments to the GSFL and 
IRL energy conservation standards as 
directed by 42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(3). 
The scope of coverage for these 
requirements for GSFL and IRL is 
dictated by EPCA’s definitions of these 
and related terms, as explained below. 
EPCA defines ‘‘general service 
fluorescent lamp’’ as follows: * * * 
[F]luorescent lamps which can be used 
to satisfy the majority of fluorescent 
applications, but does not include any 
lamp designed and marketed for the 
following nongeneral lighting 
applications: (i) Fluorescent lamps 
designed to promote plant growth. (ii) 
Fluorescent lamps specifically designed 
for cold temperature installations. (iii) 
Colored fluorescent lamps. (iv) Impact- 
resistant fluorescent lamps. (v) 
Reflectorized or aperture lamps. (vi) 
Fluorescent lamps designed for use in 
reprographic equipment. (vii) Lamps 
primarily designed to produce radiation 
in the ultra-violet region of the 
spectrum. (viii) Lamps with a color 
rendering index of 87 or greater. (42 
U.S.C. 6291(30)(B)) 
EPCA defines ‘‘incandescent reflector 
lamp’’ as follows: * * * [A] lamp in 
which light is produced by a filament 
heated to incandescence by an electric 
current * * * [and] (commonly referred 
to as a reflector lamp) which is not 
colored or designed for rough or 
vibration service applications, that 
contains an inner reflective coating on 
the outer bulb to direct the light, an R, 
PAR, ER, BR, BPAR, or similar bulb 
shapes with E26 medium screw bases, a 
rated voltage or voltage range that lies 
at least partially within 115 and 130 
volts, a diameter which exceeds 2.25 
inches, and has a rated wattage that is 
40 watts or higher. 
(42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(C), (C)(ii) and (F)) 
EPCA further clarifies this definition 
of IRL by defining the lamp types 
excluded from the definition: The term 
‘‘rough service lamp’’ means a lamp 
that—(i) has a minimum of 5 supports 
with filament configurations that are C– 
7A, C–11, C–17, and C–22 as listed in 
Figure 6–12 of the 9th edition of the 
IESNA Lighting handbook, or similar 
configurations where lead wires are not 
counted as supports; and (ii) is 
designated and marketed specifically for 
‘rough service’ applications, with (I) the 
designation appearing on the lamp 
packaging; and (II) marketing materials 
that identify the lamp as being for rough 
service. (42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(X)) 
The term ‘‘vibration service lamp’’ 
means a lamp that—(i) has filament 
configurations that are C–5, C–7A, or C– 
9, as listed in Figure 6–12 of the 9th 
Edition of the IESNA Lighting 
Handbook or similar configurations; (ii) 
has a maximum wattage of 60 watts; (iii) 
is sold at retail in packages of 2 lamps 
or less; and (iv) is designated and 
marketed specifically for vibration 
service or vibration-resistant 
applications, with—(I) the designation 
appearing on the lamp packaging; and 
(II) marketing materials that identify the 
lamp as being vibration service only. (42 
U.S.C. 6291(30)(AA)) 
The term ‘‘colored incandescent 
lamp’’ means an incandescent lamp 
designated and marketed as a colored 
lamp that has—(i) a color rendering 
index of less than 50, as determined 
according to the test method given in 
C.I.E. publication 13.3–1995; or (ii) a 
correlated color temperature of less than 
2,500K, or greater than 4,600K, where 
correlated temperature is computed 
according to the Journal of Optical 
Society of America, Vol. 58, pages 
1528–1595 (1986). (42 U.S.C. 
6291(30)(EE)) 3 
The advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking (ANOPR) in this proceeding 
(73 FR 13620, 13622, 13625, 13628–29 
(March 13, 2008)), as well as subsection 
II.C and section III below, provide 
additional detail on the nature and 
statutory history of EPCA’s 
requirements for GSFL and IRL. 
Under the Act, DOE’s energy 
conservation program for covered 
products consists essentially of four 
parts: (1) Testing; (2) labeling; (3) 
Federal energy conservation standards, 
and (4) certification and enforcement 
procedures. The Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) is responsible for 
labeling, and DOE implements the 
remainder of the program. Section 323 
of the Act authorizes DOE, subject to 
certain criteria and conditions, to 
develop test procedures to measure the 
energy efficiency, energy use, or 
estimated annual operating cost of each 
covered product. (42 U.S.C. 6293) The 
test procedures for GSFL and IRL appear 
at title 10 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) part 430, subpart B, appendix R. 
EPCA provides criteria for prescribing 
new or amended energy conservation 
standards for covered products. As 
indicated above, any new or amended 
standard for a covered product under 
Part A must be designed to achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A)), although EPCA 
precludes DOE from adopting any 
standard that would not result in 
significant conservation of energy. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) Moreover, DOE 
may not prescribe a standard: (1) For 
certain products, including GSFL and 
IRL, if no test procedure has been 
established for that type (or class) of 
product, or (2) if DOE determines by 
rule that the standard would not result 
in significant conservation of energy or 
is not technologically feasible or 
economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)) The Act also provides that, 
in deciding whether a standard is 
economically justified, DOE must 
determine whether the benefits of the 
standard exceed its burdens. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) DOE must do so after 
receiving comments on the proposed 
standard and by considering, to the 
greatest extent practicable, the following 
seven factors: 
(1) The economic impact of the 
standard on manufacturers and 
consumers of the products subject to the 
standard; 
(2) The savings in operating costs 
throughout the estimated average life of 
the covered products in the type (or 
class) compared to any increase in the 
price, initial charges, or maintenance 
expenses for the covered products that 
are likely to result from the imposition 
of the standard;

published in May 2006 is available at: http://www/

residential/pdfs/lamps_framework.pdf. 
(3) The total projected amount of 
energy savings likely to result directly 
from the imposition of the standard; 
(4) Any lessening of the utility or the 
performance of the covered products 
likely to result from the imposition of 
the standard; 
(5) The impact of any lessening of 
competition, as determined in writing 
by the Attorney General, that is likely to 
result from the imposition of the 
standard; 
(6) The need for national energy 
conservation; and 
(7) Other factors the Secretary 
considers relevant. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(I)–(VII)) 
Furthermore, EPCA contains what is 
commonly known as an ‘‘anti- 
backsliding’’ provision, which mandates 
that the Secretary not prescribe any 
amended standard that either increases 
the maximum allowable energy use or 
decreases the minimum required energy 
efficiency of a covered product. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(1)) Also, the Secretary 
may not prescribe an amended or new 
standard if interested persons have 
established by a preponderance of 
evidence that the standard is likely to 
result in the unavailability in the United 
States of any covered product type (or 
class) with performance characteristics 
(including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as those generally 
available in the United States. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(4)) 
Under 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(b)(iii), 
EPCA establishes a rebuttable 
presumption that a standard is 
economically justified if the Secretary 
finds that ‘‘the additional cost to the 
consumer of purchasing a product 
complying with an energy conservation 
standard level will be less than three 
times the value of the energy, and as 
applicable, water, savings during the 
first year that the consumer will receive 
as a result of the standard, as calculated 
under the applicable test procedure. 
* * *’’ 
Under 42 U.S.C. 6295(q)(1), EPCA sets 
forth additional requirements applicable 
to promulgating a standard for a type or 
class of covered product that has two or 
more subcategories. DOE must specify a 
different standard level than that which 
applies generally to such type or class 
of products ‘‘for any group of covered 
products which have the same function 
or intended use, if * * * products 
within such group—(A) consume a 
different kind of energy from that 
consumed by other covered products 
within such type (or class); or (B) have 
a capacity or other performance-related 
feature which other products within 
such type (or class) do not have and 
such feature justifies a higher or lower 
standard’’ than applies or will apply to 
the other products. Id. In determining 
whether a performance-related feature 
justifies such a different standard for a 
group of products, DOE must ‘‘consider 
such factors as the utility to the 
consumer of such a feature’’ and other 
factors DOE deems appropriate. Id. Any 
rule prescribing such a standard must 
include an explanation of the basis on 
which such higher or lower level was 
established. (42 U.S.C. 6295(q)(2)) 
Federal energy efficiency 
requirements generally supersede State 
laws or regulations concerning energy 
conservation testing, labeling, and 
standards. (42 U.S.C. 6297(a)–(c)) DOE 
can, however, grant waivers of Federal 
preemption for particular State laws or 
regulations, in accordance with the 
procedures and other provisions of 
section 327(d) of the Act. (42 U.S.C. 
6297(d)) 
C. Background 
1. Current Standards 
EPCA prescribes the energy 
conservation standards that are 
currently applicable to specified types 
of GSFL and IRL. More specifically, the 
standards set efficacy levels and color 
rendering index (CRI) levels for certain 
GSFL, and efficacy standards for certain 
IRL. (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(1); 10 CFR 
430.32(n)) These statutory standard 
levels are set forth in Table II.1 and 
Table II.2 below.

2. History of Standards Rulemaking for 
General Service Fluorescent Lamps, 
Incandescent Reflector Lamps, and 
General Service Incandescent Lamps 
As stated above, EPCA established 
energy conservation standards for 
certain types of GSFL and IRL. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)) EPCA also requires 
that DOE conduct two cycles of 
rulemakings to determine whether to 
amend these standards, and that DOE 
initiate a rulemaking to determine 
whether to adopt standards for 
additional types of GSFL. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(3)–(5)) This rulemaking 
addresses both the amendment of 
existing GSFL and IRL standards, and 
the adoption of standards for additional 
GSFL. 
DOE initiated this rulemaking on May 
31, 2006, by publishing on its Web site 
its ‘‘Rulemaking Framework Document 
for General Service Fluorescent Lamps, 
Incandescent Reflector Lamps, and 
General Service Incandescent Lamps.’’ 4 
DOE also published a notice in the 
Federal Register announcing the 
availability of the framework document

7 A notation in the form ‘‘DOE, No. 27 ’’ identifies 
a written comment that DOE has received and has 
included in the docket of this rulemaking or a 
written docket submission. This particular notation 
refers to a comment: (1) Submitted by DOE; and (2) 
in document number 27 in the docket of this 
rulemaking. 
and a public meeting on the document, 
which requested public comments on 
the matters raised in the framework 
document. 71 FR 30834 (May 31, 2006). 
The framework document described the 
procedural and analytical approaches 
that DOE anticipated using to evaluate 
energy conservation standards for the 
products covered by this rulemaking, 
and it identified various issues to be 
resolved in conducting the rulemaking. 
DOE held the public meeting on June 
15, 2006, to present the framework 
document, describe the analyses it 
planned to conduct during the 
rulemaking, seek comments from 
stakeholders on these subjects, and 
inform stakeholders about and facilitate 
their involvement in the rulemaking. At 
the public meeting and during the 
comment period, DOE received many 
comments that both addressed issues 
raised in the framework document and 
identified additional issues relevant to 
this rulemaking. 
As the title of the framework 
document indicates, DOE initially 
included general service incandescent 
lamps (GSIL) in this rulemaking. This 
was done to address the requirement 
then present in section 325(i)(5) of 
EPCA that DOE consider energy 
conservation standards for additional 
GSIL. (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(5)) However, 
section 321(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Energy 
Independence and Security Act of 
2007,5 (EISA 2007) amended EPCA to 
remove this requirement, thereby 
eliminating DOE’s authority to regulate 
additional GSIL. Instead, section 
321(a)(3)(A)(ii) of EISA 2007 amended 
EPCA to prescribe energy conservation 
standards for GSIL. Therefore, this 
rulemaking no longer addresses GSIL. 
DOE issued the ANOPR for this 
rulemaking on February 21, 2008 and 
published it in the Federal Register on 
March 13, 2008. 73 FR 13620. On 
February 22, 2008, DOE posted the 
ANOPR, as well as the complete 
ANOPR technical support document 
(TSD), on its Web site.6 The TSD 
includes the results of the following 
DOE preliminary analyses: (1) Market 
and technology assessment; (2) 
screening analysis; (3) engineering 
analysis; (4) energy use characterization; 
(5) product price determinations; (6) 
life-cycle cost (LCC) and pay back 
period (PBP) analyses; (7) shipments 
analysis; and (8) national impact 
analysis (NIA). 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
invited comment in particular on the 
following issues: (1) Consideration of 
additional GSFL; (2) amended 
definitions; (3) product classes; (4) 
scaling to product classes not analyzed; 
(5) screening of design options; (6) lamp 
operating hours; (7) energy consumption 
of GSFL; (8) LCC calculation; (9) 
installation costs; (10) base-case market- 
share matrices; (11) shipment forecasts; 
(12) base-case and standards-case 
forecasted efficiencies; (13) trial 
standard levels; and (14) period for 
lamp production equipment conversion. 
73 FR 13620, 13686–88 (March 13, 
2008). 
In the ANOPR, DOE described and 
sought comment on the analytical 
framework, models, and tools (e.g., LCC 
and national energy savings (NES) 
spreadsheets) DOE was using to analyze 
the impacts of energy conservation 
standards for GSFL and IRL. DOE held 
a public meeting in Washington, DC, on 
March 10, 2008, to present the 
methodologies and results for the March 
2008 ANOPR analyses. At this meeting, 
stakeholders recommended that DOE 
revise certain analyses in the energy 
conservation standard ANOPR and the 
scope of covered products. DOE later 
received written comments from the 
National Electrical Manufacturers 
Association (NEMA). In addition, DOE 
received a joint comment from several 
stakeholders. The Joint Comment was 
submitted by the American Council for 
an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE), 
Alliance to Save Energy (ASE), 
Appliance Standards Awareness Project 
(ASAP), National Consumer Law Center, 
National Grid, Natural Resources 
Defense Council (NRDC), Northeast 
Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP), 
Northwest Power and Conservation 
Council (NPCC), Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company (PG&E), and Vermont Energy 
Investment Corporation. The comments 
received since publication of the March 
2008 ANOPR and during the March 10, 
2008 public meeting have contributed to 
DOE’s proposed resolution of the issues 
in this rulemaking. This NOPR quotes, 
summarizes, and responds to the issues 
raised in these public comments. (A 
parenthetical reference at the end of a 
quotation or paraphrase provides the 
location of the item in the public 
record.) 
Subsequent to the public meeting and 
at NEMA’s request, DOE and NEMA met 
on June 26, 2008 to discuss appropriate 
lumens per watt (lm/W) standards for 
high correlated color temperature (CCT) 
fluorescent lamps. (DOE, No. 27) 7 
NEMA subsequently submitted a 
written comment documenting its 
presentation at this meeting (hereafter 
the ‘‘June 2008 NEMA meeting’’). 
(NEMA, No. 26) Topics covered at this 
meeting included the expected market 
share of high-CCT fluorescent lamps, 
appropriate efficacy standard scaling 
factors for GSFL with a CCT greater than 
4,500K but less than or equal to 7,000K, 
and coverage of GSFL with a CCT 
greater than 7,000K. See sections III.C.2, 
V.A.1.c, and V.C.7.a.i of this notice for 
a more detailed discussion of NEMA’s 
comments at this meeting, as well as 
DOE’s responses. 
III. Issues Affecting the Scope of This 
Rulemaking 
A. Additional General Service 
Fluorescent Lamps for Which DOE Is 
Proposing Standards 
1. Scope of EPCA Requirement That 
DOE Consider Standards for Additional 
Lamps 
As discussed above, EPCA established 
energy conservation standards for 
certain general service fluorescent 
lamps, (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)) and 
directed the Secretary to ‘‘initiate a 
rulemaking procedure to determine if 
the standards in effect for fluorescent 
lamps * * * should be amended so that 
they would be applicable to additional 
general service fluorescent [lamps]. 
* * *’’ (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(5)) Thus, DOE 
must consider whether to adopt energy 
efficacy standards for additional GSFL 
beyond those already covered by the 
statutorily-prescribed standards. 
The March 2008 ANOPR notes that a 
wide variety of GSFL are not currently 
covered by energy conservation 
standards, and they are potential 
candidates for coverage under 42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(5). 73 FR 13620, 13628–29 
(March 13, 2008). However, the 
requirement that DOE consider 
additional GSFL appears to conflict 
with EPCA’s definitions of key terms, 
which it might be argued would 
preclude coverage of additional GSFL. 
As explained below, DOE has carefully 
considered these statutory provisions 
and is interpreting them in a manner so 
as to give effect to the requirement to 
consider additional GSFL. 
Specifically, the conflict is centered 
on the statutory definition of ‘‘general 
service fluorescent lamp.’’ As set forth 
above and repeated here for purposes of 
this discussion, ‘‘general service 
fluorescent lamp’’ is defined in 42 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2

11 T5, T8, T10, and T12 are nomenclature used to 
refer to tubular fluorescent lamps with diameters of 
0.625, 1, 1.25, and 1.5 inches, respectively. 
U.S.C. 6291(30)(B) to mean: ‘‘fluorescent 
lamps which can be used to satisfy the 
majority of fluorescent lamp 
applications, but does not include any 
lamp designed and marketed for the 
following nongeneral lighting 
applications: [list of eight exclusions not 
relevant to the present issue].’’ 
As such, the term ‘‘general service 
fluorescent lamp’’ appears to be defined 
by reference to the term ‘‘fluorescent 
lamp,’’ which is also defined under the 
statute as follows: ‘‘Except as provided 
in subparagraph (E), the term 
‘fluorescent lamp’ means a low pressure 
mercury electric-discharge source in 
which a fluorescing coating transforms 
some of the ultraviolet energy generated 
by the mercury discharge into light, 
including only the following: (i) Any 
straight-shaped lamp (commonly 
referred to as 4-foot medium bi-pin 
lamps) with medium bi-pin bases of 
nominal overall length of 48 inches and 
rated wattage of 28 or more. (ii) Any U- 
shaped lamp (commonly referred to as 
2-foot U-shaped lamps) with medium 
bi-pin bases of nominal overall length 
between 22 and 25 inches and rated 
wattage of 28 or more. (iii) Any rapid 
start lamp (commonly referred to as 8- 
foot high output lamps) with recessed 
double contact bases of nominal overall 
length of 96 inches and 0.800 nominal 
amperes, as defined in ANSI C78.1– 
1978 and related supplements. (iv) Any 
instant start lamp (commonly referred to 
as 8-foot slimline lamps) with single pin 
bases of nominal overall length of 96 
inches and rated wattage of 52 or more, 
as defined in ANSI C78.3–1978 (R1984) 
and related supplement ANSI C78.3a– 
1985.’’ 42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(A) (Emphasis 
added). 
The term ‘‘fluorescent lamp’’ is, by its 
terms, limited to four enumerated types 
of lamps. Further, the four types of 
lamps set forth in the definition of 
‘‘fluorescent lamp’’ have corresponding 
energy conservation standards 
prescribed under the statute at 42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(1)(B). Given that the statutory 
definition of ‘‘fluorescent lamp’’ is 
limited to four specified types of lamps 
and that the statute prescribes standards 
for those four lamps, it is not possible 
to give effect to the congressional 
directive to consider establishing 
standards for additional GSFL if the 
term ‘‘general service fluorescent lamp’’ 
is limited by the definition of 
‘‘fluorescent lamp.’’ 
Given this identified conflict, DOE 
has determined that there is an inherent 
ambiguity in the statute in terms of how 
these provisions are to be implemented. 
In order to move forward with this 
standards rulemaking, DOE must 
resolve this legal conundrum. 
Although there is no legislative 
history to clarify this point, there are a 
number of reasons to believe that 
Congress did not intend to strictly limit 
consideration of ‘‘additional’’ GSFL. 
First, Congress adopted both the 
relevant statutory definitions and the 
‘‘additional’’ lamps requirement as part 
of Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 
1992; Pub. L. 102–486). DOE does not 
believe Congress would intentionally 
insert a legislative provision that, when 
read in conjunction with a 
simultaneously added provision, 
amounts to a nullity. Second, reading 
the definition to preclude consideration 
of additional GSFL would run counter 
to the energy-saving purposes of EPCA. 
It is reasonable to assume that Congress 
would not have intended to limit energy 
conservation standards to only those 
technologies available in 1992, but 
would instead cast a broader net that 
would achieve energy efficiency 
improvements in lighting products 
incorporating newer technologies. 
Consequently, DOE interprets these 
statutory provisions such that, in 
defining ‘‘general service fluorescent 
lamp,’’ Congress intended to incorporate 
the term ‘‘fluorescent lamp’’ in a 
broader, more generic sense. DOE 
understands that the industry routinely 
refers to ‘‘fluorescent lamps’’ as 
including products in addition to the 
four enumerated in the statutory 
definition of that term. In fact, in the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE presented its 
plan for including additional GSFL for 
coverage, and did not receive adverse 
comment. Thus, DOE has determined to 
read the statutory definition of ‘‘general 
service fluorescent lamp’’ in this 
broader context. 
For these reasons, and for the 
additional reasons set forth in the March 
2008 ANOPR,8 DOE views ‘‘additional’’ 
GSFL, as that term is used in 42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(5), as lamps that: (1) Meet the 
technical portion of the statutory 
definition of ‘‘fluorescent lamp’’ (i.e., a 
low-pressure mercury electric-discharge 
source in which a fluorescing coating 
transforms some of the ultraviolet 
energy generated by the mercury 
discharge into light) (42 U.S.C. 
6291(30)(A)) without restriction to the 
four specified lamp types in that 
definition; (2) can be used to satisfy the 
majority of fluorescent lighting 
applications (42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(B)); (3) 
are not within the exclusions from the 
definition of GSFL specified in 42 
U.S.C. 6291(30)(B); and (4) are ones for 
which EPCA does not prescribe 
standards. Such an interpretation does 
not alter the existing statutory provision 
or standards for ‘‘fluorescent lamps,’’ 
but it does permit DOE to give effect to 
section 6295(i)(5) of EPCA by expanding 
the universe of GSFL open to potential 
regulation. The scope of coverage 
reflected in this NOPR is in keeping 
with the interpretation outlined above. 
2. Identification of the Additional 
Lamps for Which DOE Proposes 
Standards 
As set forth more fully in the March 
2008 ANOPR, DOE took the following 
three steps in terms of identifying 
additional GSFL for which standard 
setting might be appropriate. DOE first 
conducted a comprehensive review of 
the fluorescent lighting market in order 
to identify particular types of lamps that 
meet the four criteria above to 
determine the additional GSFL for 
which DOE would consider adopting 
standards. Second, DOE examined each 
lamp type to determine potential energy 
savings that energy conservation 
standards would bring for that lamp. 
Third, DOE further evaluated selected 
lamps to determine if such standards 
would be technologically feasible and 
economically justified. In carrying out 
these steps before issuance of the March 
2008 ANOPR, DOE considered 
comments on these issues that it had 
received previously. 73 FR 13620, 
13629–30 (March 13, 2008). 
In implementing the first of these 
three steps, DOE identified the 
following categories of GSFL as meeting 
the four criteria for consideration as 
‘‘additional’’ GSFL under 42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(5): 
• 4-foot, medium bipin (MBP), 
straight-shaped lamps, rated wattage of 
< 28W; 
• 2-foot, medium bipin, U-shaped 
lamps, rated wattage of < 28W; 
• 8-foot, recessed double contact 
(RDC), rapid start, high output (HO) 
lamps not defined in ANSI Standard 
C78.1–1991 9 or with current other than 
0.800 nominal amperes; 
• 8-foot single pin (SP), instant start, 
slimline lamps with a rated wattage ≥ 
52, not defined in ANSI Standard 
C78.3–1991 10; 
• Very high output (VHO) straight- 
shaped lamps; 
• T5 11 miniature bipin (MiniBP) 
straight-shaped lamps; 
• Additional straight-shaped and U- 
shaped lamps other than those listed

12 ANSI Standard C78.1–1991 has been updated 
and replaced by ANSI Standard C78.81–2005, ‘‘for 
Electric Lamps—Double Capped Fluorescent 
Lamps—Electrical and Dimensional 
Characteristics.’’ 
above (e.g., alternate lengths, diameters, 
or bases); and 
• Additional fluorescent lamps with 
alternate shapes (e.g., circline, pin-based 
compact fluorescent lamps (CFL)). 
73 FR 13620, 13630 (March 13, 2008). 
DOE then assessed the potential 
energy savings of standards for these 
GSFL (second step) and whether 
candidate standards for those GSFL 
would be technologically feasible and 
economically justified (third step), in 
order to determine which GSFL to 
analyze in depth regarding whether, and 
at what levels, standards would be 
warranted under the EPCA criteria in 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o). DOE’s analytical process 
related to these additional GSFL 
categories is discussed generally below. 
In a review of 4-foot medium bipin 
lamps, DOE found that the current 
market lacked any products with a rated 
wattage below 25W. Therefore, in the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE preliminarily 
decided not to extend coverage to 4-foot 
medium bipin lamps below 25W. In the 
following section, DOE discusses its 
consideration in the March 2008 
ANOPR of possibly regulating lamps 
with rated wattages less than 28W and 
greater than or equal to 25W. 
Similar to the 4-foot medium bipin 
lamps, in the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
investigated the potential for regulating 
2-foot U-shaped lamps less than 28W. A 
review of available manufacturer 
catalogs found no commercially- 
available products in that category. 
Therefore, DOE concluded that lowering 
the minimum wattage threshold of 2- 
foot U-shaped lamps would likely not 
result in substantial energy savings and 
preliminarily decided not to expand 
coverage to these lamps. 
DOE also considered whether to 
expand coverage to include VHO 
fluorescent lamps. While VHO lamps 
consume large amounts of energy, they 
are commonly used in outdoor 
applications where high-intensity 
discharge (HID) lamps are rapidly 
gaining market share. Further research 
indicated that shipments of VHO T12 
lamps are declining rapidly. Although 
individually these products have greater 
per-lamp energy savings than high 
output or standard output lamps, the 
total energy savings resulting from 
regulation would be small and would be 
expected to decrease over time as these 
lamps disappear from the market. 
Therefore, DOE preliminarily decided 
not to extend coverage to VHO lamps. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE also 
preliminarily decided not to expand 
coverage to T5 fluorescent lamps. DOE’s 
initial analysis showed that T5 lamps 
currently have a relatively small share 
of the GSFL market, and, therefore, have 
limited potential to contribute to total 
energy savings. Although T5 lamps can 
serve as a substitute for T8 or T12 
lamps, DOE found that T5 lamps tend 
to have higher efficacy. Research 
showed that the highest efficacy 32W 4- 
foot medium bipin T8 lamp is 95 lm/W, 
compared to 104 lm/W for a standard 
output 4-foot miniature bipin T5 lamps. 
Thus, DOE stated that excluding T5 
lamps from this rulemaking would be 
unlikely to undermine any energy 
savings that would result from a T12 
and T8 standard, even if the standard 
caused increased sales of T5 systems 
Lastly, DOE preliminarily decided not 
to extend coverage to fluorescent lamps 
that had alternate lengths, diameters, 
bases, or shapes (or a combination 
thereof) than the lamps specifically 
mentioned. DOE reasoned that the 
products it had already selected for 
coverage represented the significant 
majority of the GSFL market, and, thus, 
the bulk of the potential energy savings. 
Furthermore, DOE tentatively 
concluded there was limited potential 
for lamps with miscellaneous lengths 
and bases to grow in market share, given 
the constraint of fixture lengths and 
socket compatibility. 
After eliminating the lamps 
aforementioned lamps from further 
consideration for the reasons cited 
above, DOE was left with the following 
additional GSFL to consider evaluating 
in depth for potential standards: 
• 4-foot, medium bipin lamps with 
wattages ≥ 25 and < 28; 
• 8-foot, recessed double contact 
(RDC), rapid start, high output (HO) 
lamps not defined in ANSI Standard 
C78.1–1991 or with current other than 
0.800 nominal amperes; 
• 8-foot single pin (SP), instant start, 
slimline lamps with a rated wattage ≥ 
52, not defined in ANSI Standard 
C78.3–1991; 
73 FR 13620, 13632 (March 13, 2008). 
As mentioned in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE explored extending 
coverage to 4-foot medium bipin lamps 
with wattages less than 28W. A product 
review found that manufacturers 
marketed and sold 25W 4-foot medium 
bipin T8 fluorescent lamps as 
replacements for higher wattage 4-foot 
medium bipin T8 fluorescent lamps. 
Thus, DOE concluded that lowering the 
minimum wattage threshold to include 
these lamps would mitigate the risk of 
25W lamps becoming a loophole and 
would maximize potential energy 
savings. In addition, as the technology 
and incremental costs associated with 
increased efficacy of 25W lamps are 
similar to their already regulated 28W 
counterparts, DOE tentatively 
concluded that standards for these 
lamps would be technologically feasible 
and economically justified. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE also 
preliminarily decided to extend 
coverage to 8-foot recessed double 
contact, rapid start, HO lamps not 
defined in ANSI Standard C78.1–1991. 
Due to the ampere specification in the 
definition, the statutory standards 
covered only T12 8-foot recessed double 
contact HO lamps, but none of the T8 
8-foot recessed double contact HO 
lamps (which usually have 0.400 
nominal amperes). Since the T8 8-foot 
lamps serve as substitutes for their T12 
counterparts, DOE risked losing 
potential energy savings unless such 
lamps are also covered by energy 
conservation standards. Consequently, 
DOE preliminarily extended coverage to 
T8, 8-foot recessed double contact HO 
lamps, thereby adding lamps previously 
restricted by the 0.800 nominal ampere 
limitation in the definition of ‘‘general 
service fluorescent lamp.’’ 
Furthermore, DOE planned to expand 
coverage to 8-foot recessed double 
contact, rapid start, high output 
fluorescent lamps not listed in ANSI 
Standard C78.1–1991. DOE made this 
decision because the ANSI standards 
referenced in DOE regulations were 
outdated.12 As new lamps are 
introduced to the market, it is likely 
they would not be covered by the 1991 
ANSI standard and potentially even the 
currently most up-to-date standard. Any 
of these lamps could serve as substitutes 
for regulated lamps. To maximize 
energy savings from these standards, 
DOE extended coverage to 8-foot 
recessed double contact, rapid start, 
high output fluorescent lamps not listed 
in ANSI Standard C78.1–1991. 
Because the technologies of T8, 8-foot 
recessed double contact HO lamps and 
the 8-foot recessed double contact HO 
lamps not listed in the ANSI Standard 
C78.1–1991 were similar to the 
technologies of their already-regulated 
T12 counterparts, DOE tentatively 
concluded that standards for these 
lamps would meet the statutory 
criterion of technological feasibility. 
Preliminary analysis of these lamps in 
the LCC and NIA demonstrated 
substantial economic savings. Therefore, 
DOE tentatively concluded that energy 
conservation standards for these lamps 
would be expected to be economically 
justified.

16929 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
13 A notation in the form ‘‘Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 71–72’’ identifies a written 
comment that DOE has received and has included 
in the docket of this rulemaking. This particular 
notation refers to a comment: (1) Submitted during 
the public meeting on March 10–11, 2008; (2) in 
document number 21 in the docket of this 
rulemaking; and (3) appearing on pages 71 through 
72 of the transcript. 
Similar to 8-foot recessed double 
contact HO lamps, in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE considered extending 
coverage to 8-foot, single pin, instant 
start, slimline lamps not included in 
ANSI Standard C78.3–1991 (which 
includes T8 lamps as well). DOE’s 
preliminary analysis indicated that 
regulation of these lamps has the 
potential to achieve substantial energy 
savings. Therefore, DOE preliminarily 
decided to expand the scope of energy 
conservation standard coverage to 8-foot 
single pin slimline lamps with a rated 
wattage greater than or equal to 52W not 
listed in ANSI Standard C78.3–1991. 
Since the technologies of T8, 8-foot 
single pin slimline lamps and the 8-foot 
single pin slimline lamps not listed in 
ANSI Standard C78.3–1991 are similar 
to the technologies of their already- 
regulated counterparts, DOE tentatively 
concluded that standards for these 
lamps would be expected to meet the 
statutory criterion of technological 
feasibility. Analyses in the LCC and NIA 
confirmed the potential for substantial 
economic savings associated with 
regulation of these lamp types. As a 
result, in the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
tentatively concluded that energy 
conservation standards for these lamps 
would be economically justified. 
During and after the public meeting, 
DOE received numerous verbal and 
written comments regarding the lamps 
included in or excluded from coverage 
in the March 2008 ANOPR. As a general 
matter, commenters supported DOE’s 
approach for consideration of additional 
GSFL for coverage by energy 
conservation standards. However, 
commenters urged DOE to consider 
changes in its approach in two areas, 
specifically coverage of T5 lamps and 
extension of lamp wattage ranges. 
Sections III.A.2.a and III.A.2.b of this 
notice immediately below discuss the 
submitted comments and DOE’s 
responses. 
a. Coverage of T5 Lamps 
At the March 2008 ANOPR public 
meeting, NEMA announced that it was 
considering supporting coverage of T5 
lamps to prevent the introduction of 
less-efficient T5 lamps into the market, 
particularly those containing 
halophosphors. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 71–72) 13 
ACEEE likewise suggested that DOE 
should analyze opportunities involving 
regulation of T5 lamps. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at p. 73) In its written 
comments, NEMA stated that it would 
not oppose covering newer T5 
fluorescent lamp technology (e.g., 28W 
4-foot T5 lamps), but would not 
recommend covering older technology 
(i.e., T5 preheat fluorescent lamps). 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 3) In addition, the 
Joint Comment stated that DOE should 
extend coverage to T5 lamps. These 
organizations argued that if only T8 and 
T12 lamps are covered by the standard, 
it could possibly spur market 
introduction of less-efficient 
halophosphor T5 lamps with a lower 
first cost. Such a development would 
increase the overall market share of T5 
lamps and decrease the potential energy 
savings associated with this rulemaking. 
(Joint Comment, No. 23 at pp. 2–5) 
DOE agrees with these comments. 
While most T5 lamps are currently more 
efficient than the T8 and T12 lamps for 
which they can be substituted, 
excluding them from energy 
conservation standards could provide 
an incentive for less-efficient T5 lamps 
to enter the market. Such trend would 
result in increased market share of less- 
efficient products, thereby creating the 
potential for significant energy savings 
losses unless these lamps are regulated. 
Because this potential substitution effect 
is a primary criterion which DOE uses 
to determine coverage for additional 
GSFL, DOE is proposing in this NOPR 
to extend coverage to T5 miniature 
bipin lamps. 
DOE researched the market and 
product availability of T5 lamps and 
found they exist in a variety of lengths 
and wattages. Standard T5 lamps 
include wattages ranging from 14W to 
80W, and lengths ranging from 
nominally 2 feet to 6 feet. DOE’s 
research indicates that the primary 
driver of T5 market share growth is 
substitution for currently regulated 4- 
foot MBP lamps. Therefore, DOE 
proposes to cover only the nominally 4- 
foot lengths of T5 miniature bipin 
lamps. DOE believes that alternate 
lengths of T5 lamps are not likely to 
gain significant market share as they are 
not easily substitutable for 4-foot MBP 
systems which represent the majority of 
the total fluorescent market. In addition, 
interviews with manufacturers and a 
review of product literature indicate 
that standard-output (approximately 
28W) and high-output (approximately 
54W) lamps are the highest volume T5 
miniature bipin lamps. In addition to 
the full-wattage versions of these lamps, 
DOE has found that reduced-wattage 
versions of the standard- and high- 
output T5 lamp (26W and 51W 
respectively) are available. Therefore, in 
this NOPR, DOE proposes to extend 
coverage to 4-foot nominal, straight- 
shaped, T5 miniature bipin standard 
output lamps with rated wattages ≥ 26W 
and to 4-foot nominal, straight-shaped, 
T5 miniature bipin high output lamps 
with rated wattages ≥ 51W, as they 
present the greatest potential for energy 
savings. DOE estimates potential energy 
savings from these lamps of up to 2.05 
quads over the analysis period (2012 to 
2042). Because higher-efficacy versions 
of some of these lamps are already 
present in the market, DOE tentatively 
concludes that standards for these 
lamps are technologically feasible. 
Based on DOE’s LCC and NIA 
analyses, coverage of the T5 lamps 
discussed above would be economically 
justified. These analyses show that T5 
lamp coverage has the potential to 
achieve on average $47.03 per standard- 
output lamp system and $56.60 per 
high-output lamp system in LCC 
savings. In addition, DOE’s NIA 
indicates that regulating these lamps 
could result in an NPV of up to $6.84 
billion to the Nation (discounted at 3 
percent). See section VI.B.1.a.i and 
section VI.B.3 of this document and 
chapters 8 and 11 of the TSD for more 
details on these results. 
b. Extension of Lamp Wattage Ranges 
Regarding fluorescent lamp coverage, 
the Joint Comment suggested that DOE 
should extend wattage ranges to cover 
lower-wattage products. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 4) In relevant 
part, section 123 of EPACT 1992 
amended EPCA to establish standards 
for 4-foot medium bipin lamps of 28W 
or more. The Joint Comment notes that 
since that law took effect, ‘‘new 
products continue to be introduced, and 
there is an incentive to circumvent 
standards by producing lamps just 
outside of the watt range (e.g. the 
current 25W residential lamp).’’ Id. 
NEMA commented that while current 
standards cover 2-foot U-shaped 
medium bipin lamps greater than or 
equal to 28W, new products have been 
introduced at 25W. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at p. 73) To prevent 
this trend from continuing, the Joint 
Comment recommended substantially 
lowering watt ranges for GSFL product 
classes to protect the energy savings that 
would be accomplished by this rule. If 
niche products exist in the new range, 
the Joint Comment expressed a 
preference for using narrowly drawn 
exemptions rather than limiting the 
covered watt range. (Joint Comment, No. 
23 at p. 4) 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16930 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
DOE agrees with the Joint Comment 
regarding the appropriateness of 
extending wattage ranges when 
commercially-available products exist. 
As discussed in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE proposed to extend 
coverage to 4-foot medium bipin 
fluorescent lamps with wattages 
between 25W and 28W. DOE discovered 
these lamps were being marketed as 
substitutes for currently regulated lamps 
subject to the current and amended 
standards (proposed in this NOPR) on 4- 
foot medium bipin lamps. Therefore, 
consistent with that approach, in this 
NOPR, DOE proposes to extend 
coverage to 2-foot U-shaped lamps with 
wattages greater than 25W. 
The Joint Comment expressed 
concern that substitutable products 
outside the range of covered wattages 
will emerge in other product classes. It 
suggested a proactive approach of 
lowering the watt ranges even further, 
although no products may currently 
exist in that range. (Joint Comment, No. 
23 at p. 4) While DOE understands the 
Joint Comment’s concern, DOE 
disagrees with this approach. DOE is 
required to consider energy 
conservation standards that are 
technologically feasible. If a lower 
wattage lamp does not yet exist, DOE 
cannot confirm that it would be 
technologically feasible or economically 
justified for such a lamp to meet a set 
energy conservation standard. In 
addition, lower wattage lamps may 
provide different lumen outputs, and 
thereby different utility. Therefore, if 
DOE were to include these lamps in its 
coverage without determining if the set 
energy conservation standard is 
technologically feasible, DOE could be 
reducing the utility of covered product 
or precluding its development entirely. 
Further, DOE encourages the 
introduction of lamps at lower wattages. 
Thus, DOE will only propose to extend 
wattage ranges for 4-foot medium bipin 
lamps and 2-foot medium bipin U- 
shaped lamps to the extent specified in 
this NOPR. 
3. Summary GSFL Lamps to Which DOE 
Proposes To Extend Coverage 
With the exception of the above- 
discussed comments, DOE received no 
other input related to coverage of GSFL. 
In addition, DOE’s revised analyses 
indicate that energy conservation 
standards for the lamps which DOE 
preliminarily decided to extend 
coverage in the March 2008 ANOPR are 
still expected to be technologically 
feasible, economically justified, and 
would result in significant energy 
savings. Therefore, in summary, DOE is 
proposing to cover the following 
additional GSFL: 
• 2-foot, medium bipin U-shaped 
lamps with a rated wattage ≥ 25 and less 
than < 28; 
• 4-foot, medium bipin lamps with a 
rated wattage ≥ 25 and less than 28; 
• 4-foot T5, miniature bipin, straight- 
shaped, standard output lamps with 
rated wattage ≥ 26; 
• 4-foot T5, miniature bipin, straight- 
shaped, high output lamps with rated 
wattage ≥ 51; 
• 8-foot recessed double contact, 
rapid start, HO lamps other than those 
defined in ANSI Standard C78.1–1991; 
• 8-foot recessed double contact, 
rapid start, HO lamps (other than 0.800 
nominal amperes) defined in ANSI 
Standard C78.1–1991; and 
• 8-foot single pin instant start 
slimline lamps, with a rated wattage ≥ 
52, not defined in ANSI Standard 
C78.3–1991. 
B. Exempted Incandescent Reflector 
Lamps 
Section 322(a)(1) of EISA 2007 
amended section 321(30)(C)(ii) of EPCA 
to expand the portion of the definition 
of ‘‘incandescent lamp’’ applicable to 
incandescent reflector lamps to include 
lamps with a diameter between 2.25 and 
2.75 inches, as well as ER, BR, BPAR, 
or similar bulb shapes. (42 U.S.C. 
6291(30)(C)(ii)) Furthermore, section 
322(b) of EISA 2007 incorporates several 
new exemptions to the IRL standards in 
the new section 325(i)(1)(C) of EPCA. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)(C)) These 
exemptions are as follows: (1) Lamps 
rated 50 watts or less that are ER30, 
BR30, BR40, or ER40; (2) lamps rated 65 
watts that are BR30, BR40, or ER40 
lamps; and (3) R20 incandescent 
reflector lamps rated 45 watts or less. 
At the ANOPR stage, DOE concluded 
that it does not have the authority to set 
standards for these lamps, for the 
following reasons. Although Congress 
included ER, BR, and small-diameter 
(less than 2.75 inches) lamps in the 
definition of an ‘‘incandescent lamp,’’ it 
specifically exempted certain wattages 
and diameters from the prescribed 
efficacy standards, thereby indicating 
Congress’s intent not to set standards for 
those products. Furthermore, DOE’s 
reading of 42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(3), which 
directs DOE to amend the standards in 
paragraph (1), led it to believe that 
DOE’s authority to amend the standards 
does not include the authority to amend 
the exemptions. Specifically, under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)(C), ‘‘Exemptions,’’ the 
statute refers to ‘‘the standards specified 
in subparagraph (B),’’ whose title is 
‘‘Minimum Standards.’’ Therefore, in 
amending the standards in paragraph 
(1), under 42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(3), DOE 
reasoned that it had the authority to 
change the efficacy values but not the 
exemptions. Accordingly, DOE 
conducted its ANOPR analyses under 
the premise that it could not extend 
coverage to these statutorily-exempted 
products. 
The Joint Comment argued that by 
covering these products in EISA 2007, 
Congress effectively brought them into 
the Federal standards program and, 
thus, granted DOE the authority to 
regulate them. The Joint Comment 
recommended extending coverage to 65- 
watt ER and BR lamps. In addition, it 
encouraged DOE to evaluate standards 
for ER and BR lamps less than 65 watts 
and for R20 lamps less than 45 watts. 
The Joint Comment further contended 
that by failing to extend coverage to 
these lamps, DOE is not meeting its 
obligation to maximize energy savings. 
The Joint Comment argued that the 
exempted lamps represent a large, 
growing market share and are a 
substitute for products that DOE plans 
to regulate. The Joint Comment stated 
that because 65-watt BR lamps represent 
a low-cost, low-efficacy alternative to 
the more-efficient products covered by 
the standards, continued exemptions 
could decrease the potentially 
significant energy savings associated 
with the present rulemaking. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 12–14) 
Accompanying the Joint Comment 
were two legal memoranda from the 
National Consumer Law Center (NCLC), 
maintaining that not only does DOE 
have the authority to regulate ER and BR 
lamps, but that DOE is obligated to 
regulate them. NCLC pointed out that 
with the passage of EISA 2007, Congress 
included BR and ER lamps that have a 
‘‘rated wattage that is 40 watts or 
higher’’ within the definition of 
‘‘incandescent lamp’’ [EISA 2007, 
section 322(a), amending 42 U.S.C. 
6291(30)(C)] and, thus, included these 
BR and ER lamps as covered products 
under 42 U.S.C. 6291(2) and 
6292(a)(14). NCLC further contended 
that the only explanation for Congress 
adding ER and BR lamps to the 
definition was to include them among 
the covered products. (Joint Comment, 
No. 23 at p. 27) NCLC cited the 
rulemaking for microwave and electric 
ovens as an example of a rulemaking in 
which DOE is considering applying 
standards to products for which no 
prescriptive efficiency standards exist. 
(Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 28) 
Through the initial drafting of this 
NOPR, DOE adhered to its earlier 
conclusion that it lacked authority to 
consider standards for ER, BR, and 
small-diameter lamps that had been

16931 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
specifically exempted by Congress. 
However, after carefully considering the 
testimony of the February 3, 2009 NOPR 
public meeting and reexamining the 
ANOPR public comments on this issue, 
DOE reexamined its authority under 
EPCA to amend standards for ER, BR, 
and small-diameter lamps and has 
concluded that its earlier view may have 
been in error. DOE is further 
considering if it has authority to 
consider energy conservation standards 
for ER, BR, and small-diameter lamps 
for the reasons that follow. 
DOE agrees with the Joint Comment, 
that prior to enactment of EISA 2007 on 
December 19, 2007, ER, BR, and small- 
diameter lamps were by definition 
excluded from coverage under EPCA; 
however, once EISA 2007 amended the 
definition of ‘‘incandescent lamp,’’ ER, 
BR, and small-diameter lamps become 
products by the new definition. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 27) Congress 
proceeded to expressly exempt certain 
types of ER, BR, and small-diameter 
lamps from the statutorily-set IRL 
standards established by EISA 2007. 
However, given that these expressly 
exempted lamp types constitute the 
overwhelming majority of the ER, BR, 
and small-diameter lamps market, 
DOE’s original construction of the 
relevant statutory provisions (as 
expressed in the ANOPR) would have 
the effect of once again moving most ER, 
BR, and small-diameter lamps beyond 
the reach of energy conservation 
standards. Accordingly, DOE is 
reconsidering whether, under 42 U.S.C 
6295(i)(3), the directive to amend the 
standards in paragraph (1) encompasses 
both the statutory levels and the 
exemptions to those standards. 
As a practical matter, if DOE does 
conclude that it has authority to 
establish standards for ER, BR, and 
small-diameter lamps, it cannot 
consider such lamps as part of the 
present rulemaking because it has not 
conducted the requisite analyses to 
propose appropriate standard levels. At 
the same time, DOE does not wish to 
delay the present rulemaking (and the 
accompanying energy savings to the 
Nation) for the sole reason of 
considering this subset of ER, BR, and 
small-diameter lamps. The analyses to 
consider standards for ER, BR, and 
small-diameter lamps are severable from 
the analyses underlying the present 
rulemaking, so separate treatment 
would not impact the outcomes for any 
of the lamp types under consideration 
in this NOPR. Therefore, DOE has 
decided to proceed with setting energy 
conservation standards for the lamps 
that are the subject of the present 
rulemaking and to commence a separate 
rulemaking for ER, BR, and small- 
diameter lamps. DOE believes that 
much of the analytical work for the 
current rulemaking will benefit the ER, 
BR, and small diameter lamps 
rulemaking, thereby permitting issuance 
of a new NOPR and final rule on an 
accelerated basis, if it determined that it 
has the authority to do so. 
For the purposes of the present NOPR, 
however, DOE notes that the balance of 
this notice (analyses and related 
discussions) assumes that the exempted 
ER, BR, and small-diameter lamps 
remain unregulated by energy 
conservation standards. DOE 
acknowledges that while such an 
assumption has no impact on the 
engineering and life-cycle cost analyses, 
the regulation of these exempted IRL 
may affect the future shipment of IRL 
and thereby the national impact and 
other downstream analyses. However, 
DOE believes that its analysis of 
multiple shipment scenarios (as 
discussed in section V.E.5) captures the 
broad range of possible impacts were 
these exempted lamps to be regulated in 
the future. Therefore DOE’s assumption 
does not impact the standards proposed 
in this rulemaking or DOE’s 
reconsideration of its authority, nor 
does it otherwise constrain DOE’s 
ability to conduct further analyses in a 
separate rulemaking. 
C. Amended Definitions 
To clarify the scope of EPCA’s 
coverage of GSFL, IRL, and the recently 
adopted standards for GSIL, DOE 
proposes to revise its existing 
definitions of ‘‘rated wattage’’ and 
‘‘colored fluorescent lamp.’’ These 
definitional changes are discussed 
below. 
1. ‘‘Rated Wattage’’ 
One element of EPCA’s definitions for 
‘‘fluorescent lamp’’ and ‘‘incandescent 
reflector lamp’’ is a lamp’s rated 
wattage, which helps delineate the 
lamps for which the statute sets 
standards. (42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(A), (C)(ii) 
and (F), and 6295(i)). In addition, 
section 321(a)(3) of EISA 2007 amended 
EPCA to prescribe energy conservation 
standards for GSIL, requiring lamps of 
particular lumen outputs to have certain 
maximum rated wattages. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)) However, EPCA does not define 
the term ‘‘rated wattage.’’ 
DOE has defined ‘‘rated wattage’’ in 
its regulations, but only for 4-foot 
medium bipin T8, T10, and T12 
fluorescent lamps. 10 CFR 430.2. This 
definition references ANSI Standard 
C78.1–1991, ‘‘for Fluorescent Lamps— 
Rapid-Start Types—Dimensional and 
Electrical Characteristics.’’ Id. Although 
EPCA also uses the term ‘‘rated wattage’’ 
to delineate 2-foot U-shaped lamps (42 
U.S.C. 6291(30)(A)(ii)), 8-foot slimline 
lamps, (42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(A)(iv)), and 
IRL (42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(C)), DOE has 
not defined ‘‘rated wattage’’ for these 
lamps. In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
considered revising and updating the 
definition of ‘‘rated wattage’’ to cite the 
current version of ANSI Standard 
C78.1–1991, clarify and improve the 
definition, and apply the revised 
definition to those lamps for which 
rated wattage is a key characteristic but 
is not currently defined by DOE. In 
response to the March 2008 ANOPR, 
DOE received one comment regarding 
the definition of ‘‘rated wattage.’’ NEMA 
commented that it agrees with DOE’s 
revised definition. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 
4). 
Therefore, DOE proposes the 
following definition for ‘‘rated wattage’’: 
Rated wattage means: 
(1) With respect to fluorescent lamps 
and general service fluorescent lamps: 
(i) If the lamp is listed in ANSI 
C78.81–2005 or ANSI C78.901–2005, 
the rated wattage of a lamp determined 
by the lamp designation of Clause 11.1 
of ANSI C78.81–2005 or ANSI C78.901– 
2005; 
(ii) If the lamp is a residential straight- 
shaped lamp, and not listed in ANSI 
C78.81–2005, the wattage of a lamp 
when operated on a reference ballast for 
which the lamp is designed; or 
(iii) If the lamp is neither listed in one 
of the ANSI guides referenced in (1)(i) 
nor a residential straight-shaped lamp, 
the wattage of a lamp when measured 
according to the test procedures 
outlined in Appendix R to subpart B of 
this part. 
(2) With respect to general service 
incandescent lamps and incandescent 
reflector lamps, the wattage measured 
according to the test procedures 
outlined in Appendix R to subpart B of 
this part. 
2. ‘‘Colored Fluorescent Lamp’’ 
Colored fluorescent lamps are 
excluded from EPCA’s definition of 
‘‘general service fluorescent lamp.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6291 (30)(B)(iii)) However, EPCA 
does not define the term ‘‘colored 
fluorescent lamp.’’ In order to fully 
define the scope of EPCA’s definition of 
GSFL, DOE currently defines ‘‘colored 
fluorescent lamp’’ as follows: 
‘‘Colored fluorescent lamp’’ means a 
fluorescent lamp designated and marketed as 
a colored lamp, and with either of the 
following characteristics: a CRI less than 40, 
as determined according to the method given 
in CIE Publication 13.2 (10 CFR 430.3), or a 
correlated color temperature less than 2,500K 
or greater than 6,600K.

16932 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
14 Ex parte communication with Edward Yandek 
of General Electric Company (Dec. 8, 2008) (DOE, 
No. 29). 
10 CFR 430.2. Because these lamps are 
not GSFL under EPCA, they are not 
covered by the standards applicable to 
GSFL. 
The central element of EPCA’s 
definition of ‘‘general service 
fluorescent lamp’’ is that they are 
fluorescent lamps ‘‘which can be used 
to satisfy the majority of lighting 
applications.’’ (42 U.S.C. 6291(30)(B)) 
The exclusions, such as the one for 
colored lamps, are for lamps designed 
and marketed for ‘‘non-general lighting 
applications.’’ Id. As detailed in the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE became 
aware of a lamp on the European market 
that meets the above definition of 
‘‘colored fluorescent lamp’’ and that is 
intended for general illumination 
applications. 73 FR 13620, 13634 
(March 13, 2008). Although DOE is 
unaware of any similar general purpose 
fluorescent lamps being introduced into 
the U.S. market, the availability of the 
European lamp demonstrates the 
potential for DOE’s definition of 
‘‘colored fluorescent lamp’’ to exclude 
new products with general service 
applications from the definition of 
‘‘general service fluorescent lamp,’’ and 
thereby from the coverage of standards 
applicable to GSFL. For this reason, in 
the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE proposed 
to revise its definition of ‘‘colored 
fluorescent lamp’’ by adding the 
following phrase after the words 
‘‘colored lamp’’: ‘‘and not designed or 
marketed for general illumination 
applications.’’ Id. 
In submitted written comments on the 
ANOPR, NEMA agreed with the 
proposed revised definition of ‘‘colored 
fluorescent lamp,’’ while noting that 
DOE will need to give additional 
consideration to general illumination 
fluorescent lamps with higher color 
temperatures. NEMA cited an example 
of a lamp with a CCT of 8,000K that 
could be used for both general 
illumination and specialty applications 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 9). NEMA 
requested a meeting to discuss this 
matter in greater detail, since it was 
performing research related to this 
topic. (DOE, No. 27) This meeting is 
subsequently discussed in section II.C.2 
of this NOPR. 
At the June 2008 NEMA meeting and 
in its written comments, NEMA 
recommended that the range of GSFL 
affected by standards should be 
increased to 7,000K from the current 
coverage, which extends to only 6,600K. 
NEMA believes that lamps with a CCT 
between 4,500K and 7,000K are growing 
in popularity and, therefore, energy 
conservation standards within that 
range are justifiable (NEMA, No. 26 at 
pp. 3–4). 
NEMA also stated that an efficacy 
standard would be inappropriate for 
GSFL with a CCT greater than 7,000K. 
Because very few GSFL with a CCT 
greater than 7,000K are commercially 
available, NEMA argued that it would 
be impossible to determine whether 
there would be an appropriate efficacy 
standard for these lamps that would be 
technologically feasible. (NEMA, No. 26 
at pp. 5–6) NEMA also stated that it is 
unlikely that exempting these high CCT 
lamps would increase their sales after a 
standard, as these lamps are often too 
‘‘blue’’ for typical consumers. Therefore, 
NEMA urged DOE to exempt all lamps 
with a CCT greater than 7,000K from 
energy conservation standards (NEMA, 
No. 26 at pp. 3–4). 
DOE considered NEMA’s input and 
agrees that because so few of these 
products with a CCT greater than 
7,000K exist in the market, there is not 
enough information to reliably analyze 
the performance of currently-available 
products or the expected performance of 
emerging products. Manufacturing 
lamps with CCTs greater than 7,000K 
would likely require the use of new 
materials not currently utilized in 
commonly sold lamps today. In 
addition, manufacturers may encounter 
different design trade-offs when 
developing their products Therefore, 
DOE is unable to determine whether a 
particular standard level would be 
technologically feasible for these lamps. 
DOE also agrees that it is appropriate 
to raise the 6,600K limit to 7,000K in the 
definition of ‘‘colored fluorescent 
lamp.’’ DOE believes that this 
amendment would further the statutory 
objective of maintaining the coverage of 
GSFL serving general application 
purposes under DOE’s energy 
conservation standards. Although lamps 
with CCTs greater than 6,600K and less 
than 7,000K are not prevalent in the 
market, DOE’s research14 indicates that 
manufacturers would likely be able to 
produce a lamp at 7,000K using the 
same materials as a 6,500K lamp (a 
commonly sold lamp). In consideration 
of the technological similarity between 
6,500K and 7,000K lamps, DOE believes 
that it would be possible to establish 
technologically feasible efficacy levels 
for 7,000K lamps. 
Therefore, DOE proposes to modify 
the definition of ‘‘colored fluorescent 
lamp’’ so as to include lamps with CCT 
less than or equal to 7,000K exclude all 
lamps with a CCT greater than 7,000K 
from energy conservation standards. 
However, DOE notes that NEMA has 
offered to track the sales of GSFL with 
a CCT greater than 7,000K in order to 
determine in the future if energy 
conservation standards are necessary for 
these products. (NEMA, No. 26 at p. 4) 
If these lamp sales show significant 
growth, and thus the potential for 
significant energy savings, DOE may 
consider amending the definition of 
‘‘colored fluorescent lamp’’ to provide 
for coverage of these lamps and setting 
an appropriate energy conservation 
standard for them in a future 
rulemaking. 
As discussed in the March 2008 
ANOPR, the discovery of a fluorescent 
lamp in the European market with a 
CCT of 17,000K being marketed for 
general illumination applications 
prompted DOE to consider actions to 
prevent such lamps from becoming a 
potential loophole to the GSFL energy 
conservation standard. However, the 
inherently ‘‘blue’’ color of these lamps 
may prevent widespread adoption as 
substitutes for standard CCT lamps (e.g., 
4,100K). Therefore, DOE no longer 
considers these lamps to be a potential 
loophole to standards set forth by this 
rulemaking. For this reason and because 
DOE is unable to determine a 
technologically feasible standard for 
these lamps, DOE believes that the 
addition of the phrase ‘‘and not 
designed or marketed for general 
illumination applications’’ with respect 
lamps with a CCT greater than 7,000K 
is no longer necessary. 
After incorporating the changes 
discussed above, DOE proposes the 
following definition of ‘‘colored 
fluorescent lamp’’ for this notice: 
Colored fluorescent lamp means either: (1) 
A fluorescent lamp designated and marketed 
as a colored lamp with a CRI less than 40, 
as determined according to the method set 
forth in CIE Publication 13.2 (10 CFR 430.3); 
(2) a fluorescent lamp designed and marketed 
as a colored lamp with a correlated color 
temperature (CCT) less than 2,500K; or (3) a 
fluorescent lamp with a CCT greater than 
7,000K. 
D. Off Mode and Standby Mode Energy 
Consumption Standards 
Section 310(3) of EISA 2007 amended 
EPCA to require future energy 
conservation standards to address 
standby mode and off mode energy use. 
Specifically, EPCA, as amended, now 
requires that, when DOE adopts 
standards for a covered product after 
July 1, 2010, DOE must, if justified by 
the criteria for adoption of standards in 
42 U.S.C. 6295(o), incorporate standby 
mode and off mode energy use into the 
standard, if feasible, or adopt a separate 
standard for such energy use for that 
product. (42 U.S.C. 6295(gg)(3)) DOE 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2

15 ‘‘Uniform Test Method for Measuring Average 
Lamp Efficiency (LE) and Color Rendering Index 
(CRI) of Electric Lamps.’’ 
16 This written comment was submitted to the 
docket of the test procedure rulemaking (Docket No. 
EERE–2007–BT–TP–0013; RIN number 1904– 
AB72). 
17 DOE’s regulations set forth the following 
definition of ‘‘technological feasibility’’: 
‘‘Technologies incorporated in commercially 
available products or in working prototypes will be 
considered technologically feasible.’’ 10 CFR 430, 
subpart C, appendix A, section 4(a)(4)(i). 
notes that although the final rule in this 
standards rulemaking is scheduled for 
publication by June 2009 (i.e., before the 
statutory deadline above), DOE 
nonetheless undertook a preliminary 
analysis of the potential for energy 
savings associated with the regulation of 
standby mode and off mode in covered 
lamps. DOE has tentatively determined 
that current technologies for the GSFL 
and IRL that are the subjects of this 
rulemaking do not use a standby mode 
or off mode, so a determination of the 
energy consumption of such features is 
inapplicable. 
Given EISA 2007’s definitions of 
‘‘active mode,’’ ‘‘off mode,’’ and 
‘‘standby mode’’ applicable to both 
GSFL and IRL, in order to meet the 
definition of ‘‘off-mode’’ or ‘‘standby 
mode,’’ the lamp must not be providing 
any active mode function (i.e., emit 
light). However, to reach such a state, 
the lamp must be entirely disconnected 
from the main power source (i.e., the 
lamp is switched off), thereby not 
satisfying the requirements of operating 
in off mode. In addition, DOE believes 
that all covered products that meet the 
definitions of ‘‘general service 
fluorescent lamp’’ and ‘‘incandescent 
reflector lamp’’ are single-function 
products and do not offer any secondary 
user-oriented or protective functions. 
Thus, GSFL and IRL do not satisfy the 
definition for ‘‘standby mode.’’ DOE 
received comments from NEMA in 
response to the March 2008 ANOPR 
supporting this characterization of off 
mode and standby mode energy 
consumption for these products. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 1) Therefore, DOE 
maintains that it is not feasible to 
incorporate off mode or standby mode 
energy use into the energy conservation 
standards for GSFL and IRL and is not 
proposing amendments to the standard 
to address lamp operation in such 
modes. The March 2008 ANOPR 
provides additional details that support 
this conclusion. 73 FR 13620, 13627 
(March 13, 2008). 
E. Color Rendering Index Standards for 
General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
Existing EPCA standards specify both 
lumens per watt and CRI levels that 
products must comply with before 
entering the market. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(1)) At the public meeting and in 
written comments, NEMA and the Joint 
Comment suggested that it may be 
necessary to amend the minimum CRI 
requirements to prevent the possible 
emergence of loopholes in the product 
classes structure and standards levels 
considered in the March 2008 ANOPR. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at 
pp. 82–84, 92, 94; Joint Comment, No. 
23 at p. 6; NEMA, No. 22 at p. 4–5) 
However, because CRI is not a 
measure of energy consumption or 
efficacy, but rather a measure of the 
color quality of the light, DOE has 
concluded that it does not have the 
authority to change the CRI standard, for 
the reasons that follow. According to 42 
U.S.C. 6291(6), ‘‘energy conservation 
standard’’ means either: (1) A 
performance standard which prescribes 
a minimum level of energy efficiency or 
a maximum quantity of energy use; or 
(2) a design requirement (only for 
specifically enumerated products). 
Although CRI is a performance 
requirement, it is not an energy 
performance requirement within the 
meaning of the term ‘‘energy 
conservation standard.’’ Because, in the 
case of GSFL, DOE has the authority to 
regulate only energy conservation 
standards (i.e., energy performance 
requirements), DOE is not proposing to 
amend the existing minimum CRI 
requirements. 
IV. General Discussion 
A. Test Procedures 
DOE’s test procedures for fluorescent 
and incandescent lamps are set forth at 
10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix 
R.15 These test procedures provide 
detailed instructions for measuring 
GSFL and IRL performance, as well as 
performance attributes of GSIL, largely 
by incorporating several industry 
standards. Prompted by an earlier 
NEMA comment (NEMA, No. 12, pp. 2– 
4) at the Framework stage of the energy 
conservation standards rulemaking, 
DOE examined these test procedures 
and decided to initiate a rulemaking, in 
parallel with this standards rulemaking, 
to revise its test procedures for GSFL, 
IRL, and GSIL (even though, as 
explained above, GSIL are no longer 
part of this standards rulemaking). 
These revisions consist largely of: (1) 
Referencing the most current versions of 
several lighting industry standards 
incorporated by reference; (2) adopting 
certain technical changes and 
clarifications; (3) expanding the test 
procedures to accommodate new classes 
of lamps subject to extended coverage 
by either EISA 2007 or this energy 
conservation standards rulemaking; and 
(4) addressing standby mode and off 
mode energy consumption (which were 
found not to apply to GSFL and IRL), as 
mandated by EISA 2007. 
To this end, DOE published a NOPR 
that proposed to update the current test 
procedure’s references to industry 
standards for fluorescent and 
incandescent lamps. 73 FR 13465 
(March 13, 2008) (the test procedure 
NOPR). The test procedure NOPR also 
proposed the following: (1) A small 
number of definitional and procedural 
modifications to the test procedure to 
accommodate technological migrations 
in the GSFL market and approaches 
DOE is considering in this standards 
rulemaking (73 FR 13465, 13472–73 
(March 13, 2008)); (2) revision of the 
reporting requirements for GSFL, such 
that all covered lamp efficacies would 
be reported with an accuracy to the 
tenths decimal place (73 FR 13465, 
13473 (March 13, 2008)); and (3) 
adoption of a testing and calculation 
method for measuring the CCT of 
fluorescent and incandescent lamps (73 
FR 13465, 13473–74 (March 13, 2008)). 
Please see the March 2008 ANOPR (73 
FR 13620, 13627–28 (March 13, 2008)) 
and the March 2008 test procedure 
NOPR (73 FR 13465, 13472–74 (March 
13, 2008)) for a detailed discussion of 
these proposals and related matters. 
The public meeting for the March 
2008 ANOPR also served as a public 
meeting to present and receive 
comments on the test procedure NOPR. 
DOE later received written remarks from 
NEMA responding to the proposals 
contained in the test procedure NOPR. 
(NEMA, No. 16) 16 DOE is considering 
these comments, and will be publishing 
a final rule in the near future. 
B. Technological Feasibility 
1. General 
In each standards rulemaking, DOE 
conducts a screening analysis, which it 
bases on information it has gathered on 
all current technology options and 
prototype designs that could improve 
the efficiency of the product or 
equipment that is the subject of the 
rulemaking. DOE considers a design 
option to be ‘‘technologically 
feasible’’ 17 if it is in the marketplace or 
if research has progressed to the 
development of a working prototype. 
In consultation with manufacturers, 
design engineers, and other interested 
parties, DOE develops a list of design 
options for consideration in the 
rulemaking. In the context of the present 
rulemaking, when determining

16934 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
18 As discussed in section V.C, due to scheduling 
and resource constraints, DOE did not analyze all 
GSFL and IRL product classes. Instead, DOE chose 
representative product classes to directly analyze 
and scaled analytical results to the remaining 
product classes. Table IV.1 and Table IV.2 present 
max-tech levels for only analyzed product classes. 
Classes not analyzed include the 2-foot U-shaped 
and high-CCT product classes (for GSFL) and the 
modified spectrum, ≥ 125 volts, and ≤ 2.5 inches 
diameter product classes (for IRL). 
proposed efficacy levels for GSFL, DOE 
only considered commercially-available 
products that can meet or exceed each 
level. For IRL, trial standard levels 2, 3, 
4, and 5 are based on commercially- 
available products. Although TSL1 is 
not based on product currently sold in 
the marketplace, DOE has used a design 
option (i.e., higher-efficiency gas fills) to 
model the performance of a higher- 
efficacy lamp that meets TSL1. DOE 
received input from manufacturers 
during interviews to verify that such a 
design option is technologically 
feasible. Therefore, DOE has concluded 
that the all design options to achieve the 
proposed efficacy levels are 
technologically feasible. 
Once DOE has determined that 
particular design options are 
technologically feasible, it evaluates 
each design option in light of the 
following criteria: (1) Practicability to 
manufacture, install, or service; (2) 
adverse impacts on product utility or 
availability; and (3) adverse impacts on 
health or safety. Chapter 4 of the TSD 
accompanying this notice contains a 
description of the screening analysis for 
this rulemaking. Also, see section 0 of 
this notice for a discussion of the design 
options DOE considered. 
2. Maximum Technologically Feasible 
Levels 
When DOE proposes to adopt or to 
decline to adopt an amended or new 
standard for a type (or class) of covered 
product, as part of the rulemaking 
process, DOE must ‘‘determine the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency or maximum reduction in 
energy use that is technologically 
feasible’’ for the product. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(p)(1)) In response to the ANOPR, 
stakeholders commented that 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o) requires that DOE evaluate the 
maximum technologically feasible, or 
‘‘max-tech,’’ potential standard 
efficiency levels. They assert that 
because DOE has gathered only 
technical information based on products 
available on the market today, it may 
not have considered those products that 
are technically feasible but not yet 
marketed. If such options are available, 
stakeholders believe DOE should model 
them as the max-tech efficiency levels. 
(Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 19) 
DOE researched whether any 
technologies could improve the efficacy 
of GSFL lamps currently marketed. DOE 
found that higher efficacy GSFL could 
be achieved but require the use of a 
higher efficiency fill gas composition. 
More efficient fill gases often include 
higher molecular weight gases (e.g., 
krypton) to increase ultraviolet light 
output, and, thus, visible light output. 
However, the use of these heavier gases 
can cause lamp instability, resulting in 
striations or flickering. Evidence of this 
effect can be seen with reduced-wattage 
lamps, which generally incorporate a 
mixture of krypton and argon gases, 
versus full-wattage lamps which 
primarily use only argon. Reduced- 
wattage lamps are often marketed with 
several application-limiting 
performance notes. For example, NEMA 
stated reduced-wattage lamps can have 
performance issues in low-temperature 
applications or when operated on rapid 
start or dimming ballasts. (NEMA, No. 
21 at p. 10) Therefore, DOE did not 
consider efficacy levels for GSFL that 
would require the use of higher- 
efficiency fill gases that would result in 
reduced utility. DOE was unable to find 
any higher-efficacy prototypes or 
commercially-available lamps that 
provide the same utility and 
performance required of GSFL. 
Therefore, DOE has concluded that 
TSL5 was the maximum technologically 
feasible level for GSFL. 
For IRL, DOE determined that the 
maximum technologically feasible 
efficacy level incorporates the highest 
technologically feasible efficiency 
reflector, halogen infrared coating, and 
filament design. From its research, DOE 
believes that the highest efficiency 
reflector employs silver, a technology 
that DOE understands to be proprietary. 
From discussions with developers of IR 
coating technology, DOE understands 
that by modifying the coating pattern 
and materials used, varying degrees of 
IR coating efficiencies can be achieved. 
Finally, altering filament design to 
obtain the highest temperature filament 
operation, while maintaining a lifetime 
similar to the baseline lamp (3,000 
hours), would result in the most 
efficacious filament. Combining all 
three of these highest efficiency 
technologies simultaneously results in 
the maximum technologically feasible 
level; however, this level is dependent 
on the use of a proprietary technology 
(the silver reflector). Because DOE is 
unaware of any alternate technology 
pathways to achieve this efficacy level, 
DOE did not consider it in its analysis. 
Instead, DOE based the highest efficacy 
level analyzed for IRL on a 
commercially-available IRL which 
employs a silver reflector, an improved 
(but not most efficient) IR coating, and 
a filament design that results in a 
lifetime of 4,200 hours. Although, this 
commercially-available lamp uses silver 
technology, DOE believes that there are 
alternate pathways to achieve this level. 
A combination of redesigning the 
filament to achieve higher temperature 
operation (and thus reducing lifetime to 
3,000 hours), employing other non- 
proprietary high-efficiency reflectors, or 
applying higher-efficiency IR coatings 
has the potential to result in an IRL that 
meets an equivalent efficacy level. For 
more information regarding these 
technologies, see chapter 3 of the TSD. 
Therefore, DOE has concluded that 
TSL5 is the maximum technologically 
feasible level for IRL that is not 
dependent on the use of a proprietary 
technology. 
Table IV.1 and Table IV.2 list the 
max-tech levels (TSL5 for GSFL and 
TSL5 for IRL) that DOE determined for

C. Energy Savings 
1. Determination of Savings 
DOE used its NIA spreadsheets to 
estimate energy savings from amended 
standards for the lamps currently 
covered by standards and from new 
standards for the remaining additional 
lamps that are the subject of this 
rulemaking. (The NIA spreadsheet 
models are described in section V.E of 
this notice and in chapter 11 of the 
TSD.) DOE forecasted energy savings 
over the period of analysis (beginning in 
2012, the year that amended standards 
would go into effect, and ending in 
2042) for each TSL. It quantified the 
energy savings attributable to amended 
and new energy conservation standards 
(i.e., to each TSL) as the difference in 
energy consumption between the 
standards case and the base case. The 
base case represents the forecast of 
energy consumption in the absence of 
amended and new mandatory energy 
conservation standards. The base case 
considers market demand for more- 
efficient products. For example, for both 
GSFL and IRL, DOE models a shift in 
the base case from covered GSFL and 
IRL toward emerging technologies such 
as light emitting diodes (LED). In 
addition, consistent with current GSFL 
market trends, DOE models a shift from 
T12 lamps to higher-efficacy T8 and T5 
lamps. For IRL in the commercial sector, 
the base-case shipments forecast also 
considers a migration from halogen IRL 
to higher-efficacy halogen infrared (HIR) 
lamps. See section 0 of this notice and 
chapter 10 of the TSD for details. 
The NIA spreadsheet models calculate 
the energy savings in site energy 
expressed in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Site 
energy is the energy directly consumed 
at building sites by GSFL or IRL. DOE 
reports national energy savings in terms 
of the source energy savings, which is 
the savings in the energy that is used to 
generate and transmit the energy 
consumed at the site. To convert site 
energy to source energy, DOE uses 
annual site-to-source conversion factors 
based on the version of the National 
Energy Modeling System (NEMS) that 
corresponds to Annual Energy Outlook 
2008 (AEO2008). The conversion factors 
vary over time because of projected 
changes in the nation’s portfolio of 
generation sources. DOE estimated that 
conversion factors remain constant at 
2030 values throughout the remainder 
of the forecast. See chapter 11 of the 
TSD for details. 
2. Significance of Savings 
Section 325 of EPCA prohibits DOE 
from adopting a standard for a covered 
product if that standard would not 
result in ‘‘significant’’ energy savings. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) While the term 
‘‘significant’’ is not defined in EPCA, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals, in Natural 
Resources Defense Council v. 
Herrington, 768 F.2d 1355, 1373 (DC 
Cir. 1985), indicated that Congress 
intended ‘‘significant’’ energy savings in 
this context to be savings that were not 
‘‘genuinely trivial.’’ The energy savings 
for all of the TSLs considered in this 
rulemaking are nontrivial, and therefore, 
DOE considers them ‘‘significant’’ 
within the meaning of section 325 of 
EPCA. 
D. Economic Justification 
1. Specific Criteria 
As noted earlier, EPCA provides 
seven factors to be evaluated in 
determining whether an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)). The 
following sections discuss how DOE has 
addressed each of those seven factors in 
this rulemaking. 
a. Economic Impact on Manufacturers 
and Consumers 
To determine the quantitative impacts 
of a new or amended standard on 
manufacturers, the economic impact 
analysis is based on an annual-cash- 
flow approach. This includes both a 
short-term assessment—based on the 
cost and capital requirements during the 
period between the announcement of a 
regulation and the regulation’s effective 
start date—and a long-term assessment. 
The impacts analyzed include INPV 
(which values the industry on the basis 
of expected future cash flows), cash 
flows by year, changes in revenue and 
income, and other appropriate measures 
of impact. Second, DOE analyzes and 
reports the impacts on different types of 
manufacturers, with particular attention 
to impacts on small manufacturers. 
Third, DOE considers the impact of 
standards on domestic manufacturer 
employment, manufacturing capacity, 
plant closures, and loss of capital 
investment. Finally, DOE takes into 
account cumulative impacts of different 
DOE and other regulations on 
manufacturers. 
For consumers, measures of economic 
impact include the changes in price, 
LCC, and payback period for each trial 
standard level. The LCC is one of the 
seven factors to be considered in 
determining the economic justification 
for a new or amended standard. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(II)) 
b. Life-Cycle Costs 
The LCC is the sum of the purchase 
price of a product (including its 
installation) and the operating expense 
(including energy and maintenance 
expenditures) discounted over the 
lifetime of the product. For each GSFL 
and IRL product class, DOE calculated 
both LCC and LCC savings for various 
efficacy levels. The LCC analysis 
required a variety of inputs, such as 
product prices, installation labor costs, 
electricity prices, annual operating 
hours, product energy consumption 
rates, and discount rates. 
To characterize variability in 
electricity pricing, DOE established 
regional differences in electricity prices. 
To account for uncertainty and 
variability in other inputs, such as 
annual operating hours and discount 
rates, DOE used a distribution of values 
with probabilities assigned to each 
value. Then for each consumer, DOE 
sampled the values of these inputs from 
the probability distributions. The 
analysis produced a range of LCCs. A 
distinct advantage of this approach is 
that DOE can identify the percentage of 
consumers achieving LCC savings due 
to an increased energy conservation 
standard, in addition to the average LCC 
savings. DOE presents only average LCC 
savings in this NOPR; however, 
additional details showing the 
distribution of results can be found in 
chapter 8 and appendix 8B of the TSD. 
In the LCC analysis, DOE also 
considered several events that would 
prompt a consumer to purchase a lamp. 
For GSFL, DOE calculated LCCs for five 
lamp purchasing events: (1) Lamp 
failure; (2) standards-induced retrofit; 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16936 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
(3) ballast failure; (4) ballast retrofit; and 
(5) new construction/renovation. For 
IRL, DOE calculated LCCs for the lamp 
failure and new construction/renovation 
events, as these were the only lamp 
purchase events deemed applicable to 
this product type. Because each event 
may present the consumer with 
different lamp (or lamp-and-ballast) 
options and economics, DOE presents 
the LCC results for several events for 
each product class in this NOPR. DOE 
assumed that the consumer purchases 
the product in 2012 (the effective start 
date of the standard). For further detail 
regarding lamp purchasing events and 
related LCC calculations, see section 
V.D and chapter 8 of the TSD. 
c. Energy Savings 
While significant conservation of 
energy is a separate statutory 
requirement for adopting an energy 
conservation standard, EPCA requires 
DOE, in determining the economic 
justification of a standard, to consider 
the total projected energy savings that 
are expected to result directly from the 
standard. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(III)) 
DOE used the NES spreadsheet results 
in its consideration of total projected 
savings. 
d. Lessening of Utility or Performance of 
Products 
In establishing classes of products, 
and in evaluating design options and 
the impact of potential standard levels, 
DOE aimed to develop standards for 
GSFL and IRL that would not lessen the 
utility or performance of these products. 
None of the considered trial standard 
levels would reduce the utility or 
performance of the GSFL and IRL under 
consideration in the rulemaking. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV)) 
Since all standard levels for GSFL use 
full-wattage lamps, rather than requiring 
a shift to higher-efficacy reduced- 
wattage lamps (which may have 
application restrictions), no GSFL 
efficacy levels reduce the utility or 
performance of the covered products. 
For IRL, for all standard levels, there are 
commercially available IRL with the 
same utility and performance as the 
baseline lamps. Therefore, DOE believes 
that none of the considered trial 
standard levels would reduce the utility 
or performance of the IRL under 
consideration in this rulemaking. 
e. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 
EPCA directs DOE to consider any 
lessening of competition likely to result 
from standards. It directs the Attorney 
General to determine the impact, if any, 
of any lessening of competition likely to 
result from a proposed standard and to 
transmit such determination to the 
Secretary no later than 60 days after the 
publication of a proposed rule, together 
with an analysis of the nature and 
extent of such impact. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and (B)(ii)) DOE has 
transmitted a copy of today’s proposed 
rule to the Attorney General and has 
requested that the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) provide its determination on this 
issue. DOE will address the Attorney 
General’s determination in the final 
rule. 
f. Need of the Nation To Conserve 
Energy 
The non-monetary benefits of the 
proposed standard are likely to be 
reflected in improvements to the 
security and reliability of the Nation’s 
energy system—namely, reductions in 
the overall demand for energy will 
result in reduced costs for maintaining 
the Nation’s electricity system. DOE 
conducts a utility impact analysis to 
estimate how standards may affect the 
Nation’s needed power generation 
capacity. This analysis captures the 
effects of efficiency improvements on 
electricity consumption by the covered 
products that are the subject of this 
rulemaking. 
The proposed standard also is likely 
to result in improvements to the 
environment. In quantifying these 
improvements, DOE has defined a range 
of primary energy conversion factors 
and associated emission reductions 
based on the estimated level of power 
generation displaced by energy 
conservation standards. DOE reports the 
environmental effects from each TSL for 
this equipment in the environmental 
assessment in the TSD. (42. U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 6316(a)) 
g. Other Factors 
EPCA allows the Secretary of Energy, 
in determining whether a standard is 
economically justified, to consider any 
other factors that the Secretary deems to 
be relevant. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII)) Under this 
provision, DOE considered subgroups of 
consumers that may be adversely 
affected by the standards proposed in 
this rule. Specifically, DOE assessed the 
impact of standards on low-income 
consumers, institutions of religious 
worship, historical facilities, and 
institutions that serve low-income 
populations. In considering these 
subgroups, DOE analyzed variations on 
electricity prices, operating hours, 
discount rates, and baseline lamps. See 
section 0 of this notice for further detail. 
2. Rebuttable Presumption 
As set forth in section 325(o)(2)(B)(iii) 
of EPCA, there is a rebuttable 
presumption that an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified if the additional cost to the 
consumer of a product that meets the 
standard level is less than three times 
the value of the first-year energy (and, 
as applicable, water) savings resulting 
from the standard, as calculated under 
the applicable DOE test procedure. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii) and 42 U.S.C. 
6316(e)(1)) DOE’s LCC and PBP analyses 
generate values that calculate the 
payback period for consumers of 
potential energy conservation standards, 
which includes, but is not limited to, 
the three-year payback period 
contemplated under the rebuttable 
presumption test discussed above. 
However, DOE routinely conducts a full 
economic analysis that considers the 
full range of impacts, including those to 
the consumer, manufacturer, Nation, 
and environment, as required under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 42 U.S.C. 
6316(e)(1)). The results of this analysis 
serve as the basis for DOE to definitively 
evaluate the economic justification for a 
potential standard level (thereby 
supporting or rebutting the results of 
any preliminary determination of 
economic justification). Section 0 of this 
notice addresses the rebuttable- 
presumption payback calculation. 
V. Methodology and Discussion of 
Comments 
A. Product Classes 
In general, in evaluating and 
establishing energy conservation 
standards, DOE divides covered 
products into classes by the type of 
energy used, capacity, or other 
performance-related features that affect 
efficiency, and factors such as the utility 
of the product to users. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(q)) DOE normally establishes 
different energy conservation standards 
for different product classes based on 
these criteria. 
1. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
proposed to establish product classes for 
GSFL based on the following three 
attributes that have differential utility 
and affect efficacy: (1) Physical 
constraints of lamps (i.e., lamp shape 
and length); (2) lumen package (i.e., 
standard versus high output); and (3) 
correlated color temperature. 73 FR 
13620, 13636 (March 13, 2008). The 
following sections summarize and 
address comments DOE received in 
response to the GSFL product classes it 
considered for the March 2008 ANOPR. 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16937 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
DOE received comments related to 
product classes on three major topics: 
T12 and T8 lamps, T5 lamps, and 
correlated color temperature. 
a. T12 and T8 Lamps 
The physical constraints of the lamp 
relate to the shape of the lamp (e.g., U- 
shaped versus linear) and the fact that 
these lamps could not be substitutes for 
each other, unless the entire fixture is 
changed. The lamp shapes provide 
unique utility because the shapes of 
these lamps prevent them from being 
used as replacements, even with a 
ballast replacement, in a given fixture. 
However, the shape and geometry of a 
lamp also impact its efficacy. In the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
acknowledged that a lamp’s diameter 
can affect its efficacy. However, because 
the utility provided to the end-user is a 
function of the light output in lumens 
(which is comparable between T12 and 
T8 lamps) and not diameter of the bulb, 
DOE decided not to establish separate 
product classes for T12 and T8 lamps. 
At the public meeting and in its 
written comments, NEMA stated that 
separate product classes might be 
necessary for T8 and T12 lamps. Both 
NEMA and General Electric (GE) noted 
that DOE used the 10-percent efficacy 
differential between 8-foot slimline and 
8-foot high output lamps as one reason 
for establishing their separate product 
classes. They reasoned that because T8 
lamps are at least 10 percent more 
efficient that T12 lamps, DOE should 
also split T8 and T12 lamps into 
separate classes. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 82–86; NEMA, 
No. 22 at p. 5) GE emphasized that 
because T8 and T12 lamps require 
different ballasts and because a growing 
number of new T8 fixtures will not fit 
T12 lamps, the two are not always 
suitable replacements and should 
therefore have separate product classes. 
GE also expressed concern that it would 
be impossible to set a single efficacy 
standard using a lumen-per-watt metric 
that would be suitable for both T8 and 
T12 lamps. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at pp. 88–89) 
Conversely, the Joint Comment 
strongly supported combining T8 and 
T12 lamps under one product class 
because the lamps are the same length, 
use the same lamp holders, and provide 
the same utility (as measured by lumen 
package). At the public meeting, ACEEE 
emphasized that the two lamps compete 
directly in the marketplace because of 
their similar performance features. 
ACEEE also expressed concern that 
setting product classes based on efficacy 
could lead to separate standards for any 
inefficient product. (ACEEE, No. 22 at p. 
91) The Joint Comment also stated that 
the fact that the two lamps use different 
ballasts is an economic issue, not a 
utility issue. The Joint Comment noted 
that large energy savings would be lost 
if DOE used separate classes because 
consumers would not migrate to the 
more efficient T8 lamps—a factor DOE 
must consider, given its obligation to set 
standards at the ‘‘maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency’’ that 
is ‘‘technologically feasible and 
economically justified.’’ (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at pp. 4–5) 
DOE research shows that T8 lamps are 
commonly used to replace T12 lamps; 
this implies that, in this case, lamp 
diameter does not significantly affect 
lamp utility. It also illustrates that the 
lamps share performance features and 
compete directly in the market. While 
DOE recognizes that lamp diameter can 
affect efficacy, lamp efficacy alone is not 
a criterion DOE uses to establish 
product classes; to warrant a separate 
product class, a unique utility feature 
must be present. As DOE has not 
identified a unique utility feature of T12 
lamps, DOE has decided to combine 
both T8 and T12 lamps into one product 
class for each lamp type. However, in 
response to GE’s comment, DOE 
recognizes that T8 and T12 lamps 
usually operate on different ballasts. 
Thus, DOE has structured its analytical 
tools to consider the impact of standards 
on consumers of both lamp types. That 
is, DOE takes the economics of 
purchasing another ballast into account 
in its LCC and NIA analyses. 
b. T5 Lamps 
The Joint Comment stated that T5 
lamps (in this rulemaking, referred to as 
4-foot miniature bipin lamps) should 
probably be in the same product class as 
T8 and T12 lamps because they compete 
against them in the market. The 
advocates noted the existence of 
retrofitting kits for installing T5 lamps 
into T8 and T12 fixtures, but 
acknowledged T5 lamps require 
different lamp holders and are ‘‘too 
bright to use in direct lighting fixtures.’’ 
The Joint Comment asked DOE to 
research the pros and cons of including 
T5 lamps with T8 and T12 lamps. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 5) 
Based on its research and 
consideration of the above comments, 
DOE has decided to establish a separate 
product class for 4-foot miniature bipin 
lamps because their physical constraints 
prevent them from being used as direct 
replacements for T8 and T12 lamps in 
many applications. For example, 
applications in which consumers cannot 
change the lamp fixture (from a 4-foot 
MBP to a 4-foot MiniBP) may not be 
appropriate for retrofitting to the 4-foot 
MiniBP system type. As the Joint 
Comment noted, these lamps require 
different lamp holders (due to 
differences in length and base type), and 
thereby qualify for a separate product 
class under the previously established 
‘‘physical constraints of lamps’’ class- 
setting criteria. 
In addition, a lamp’s lumen package 
may result in certain application 
constraints. Because 4-foot T5 MiniBP 
lamps have similar total lumen output 
as 4-foot T8 and T12 MBP lamps over 
a significantly smaller surface area, T5 
lamps are often marketed as too bright 
for use in direct lighting fixtures. If 4- 
foot T5 MiniBP lamps were regulated in 
the same product class as 4-foot MBP 
lamps, the standard could effectively 
mandate the use of T5 lamps. To 
prevent eliminating lamps appropriate 
for direct lighting applications, DOE 
believes that 4-foot miniature bipin 
lamps (T5 lamps) warrant a separate 
product class from 4-foot medium bipin 
lamps (primarily T8 and T12 lamps). 
In researching these lamp types, DOE 
found that the high output lamp is rated 
to emit more than one and a half times 
the number of lumens as the standard 
output lamp, also potentially affecting 
utility. In general, lamps that have high 
lumen output may be installed in 
certain high-ceiling or outdoor 
installations, where large quantities of 
light are needed. Lamps that have 
standard levels of light output might be 
installed in lower-ceiling installations 
such as offices or hospitals, where 
distance between the light source and 
the illuminated surfaces is not as large. 
DOE also found that this significant 
lumen output differential in standard 
output and high output T5 lamps is 
accompanied by an efficacy difference. 
Considering the differences in utility 
(light output and their applicability in 
direct lighting fixtures) and efficacy, 
and consistent with DOE’s approach in 
the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE is 
proposing separate product classes for 
standard output 4-foot miniature bipin 
lamps and high output 4-foot miniature 
bipin lamps. 
c. Correlated Color Temperature 
Correlated color temperature is a 
measure of the perceived color of the 
white light emitted from a lamp, which 
DOE believes affects lamp utility. 
Generally, as CCT increases, efficacy of 
the bulb decreases. The measured 
efficacy of lamps with different CCT is 
different because efficacy is measured in 
lumens per watt, and light emitted 
across the visible spectrum is not given 
equal weighting under this metric. 
Lumens are determined using the

16938 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
19 DOE has conducted several studies on SEL 
examining whether a significant amount of energy 
can be saved by using lamps that have less light 
output, but higher CCT. Lamps with higher CCT 
appear brighter than those with lower CCT, so the 
actual light output of higher-CCT lamps can be 
decreased, while maintaining equivalent perceived 
brightness and visual acuity. More information on 
spectrally enhanced lighting is available at:

spectrally_enhanced.html. 
20 ‘‘Full Spectrum Q&A,’’ National Lighting 
Product Information Program, Vol. 7 Issue 5 (March 
2005). Available at: http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/ 
programs/nlpip/lightingAnswers/fullSpectrum. 
human eye’s sensitivity function, and 
due to the fact that the human eye is less 
responsive to blue light, those 
fluorescent lamps that shift their 
spectral emission profiles to contain 
more blue light will have lower 
efficacies. In the March 2008 ANOPR, 
DOE established two product classes for 
GSFL based on CCT: one for high-color- 
temperature lamps greater than 4,500K, 
and another for lamps less than 4,500K. 
At the public meeting and in its 
written comments, NEMA agreed with 
DOE’s decision to establish two product 
classes based on CCT. However, at the 
public meeting NEMA noted additional 
divisions may be necessary at higher 
CCT levels because these lamps—NEMA 
specifically noted an 8,000K lamp—are 
capturing an increasing market share of 
general service applications. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 95–97) 
Industrial Ecology stated that lamps 
around 6,500K, which were once 
reserved for specialty applications, are 
increasingly being used in general 
service applications. Industrial Ecology 
argued that such a trend supports the 
idea of another product class above the 
4,500K division. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 97–98). 
At the June 2008 NEMA meeting and 
in a written comment, NEMA 
commented that growth in higher CCT 
lamps would likely come at the 5,000K 
level, although they would remain a 
relatively small portion of the general 
service market for the foreseeable future. 
Lamps with CCTs greater than 7,000K 
represent a very small portion of the 
general service market because most 
consumers consider their light to be too 
blue. Given the small market for lamps 
above 7,000K, NEMA stated it had very 
little practical production data related to 
efficacies and costs. Therefore, NEMA 
argued, lamps above 7,000K should be 
exempt from standards, especially 
considering that the current energy 
savings potential from their coverage is 
very small and unlikely to grow anytime 
soon. (NEMA, No. 26 at pp. 3–4) 
NEMA also commented that an 
equation using a continuous function 
(without discontinuities) is 
inappropriate when developing an 
efficacy standard for GSFL based on 
CCT. According to NEMA, practical 
lamp designs used to develop higher 
CCT lamps—such as phosphor design, 
weight and coating formulation, and 
coating adherence—do not provide for a 
general physical equation that yields an 
optimum lumens-per-watt standard. 
Instead, NEMA stated that successive 
step function factors need to be applied 
as CCT continues to increase. (NEMA, 
No. 26 at p. 5) The Joint Comment said 
that DOE should design CCT product 
class divisions carefully to prevent 
‘‘gaming.’’ The advocates preferred a 
continuous function to multiple product 
class divisions because the latter would 
encourage products to migrate to the 
lowest CCT value in each product class. 
If a continuous function were not 
possible, the Joint Comment strongly 
recommended raising the 4,500K 
division to 4,900K. Additionally, the 
Joint Comment stated, if DOE does set 
a product class aimed at regulating the 
8,000K lamps, the boundary should be 
approximately 7,900K. (Joint Comment, 
No. 23 at pp. 5–6) 
As noted above, DOE believes CCT 
affects consumer utility. For example, a 
lighting designer would likely consider 
the bluish color of higher color 
temperature lamps when specifying a 
luminaire for a particular application. In 
addition, as NEMA stated, higher CCT 
lamps are sometimes used for 
spectrally-enhanced lighting (SEL).19 
Advocates of spectrally-enhanced 
lighting believe that lamps with a higher 
CCT can help save energy and may also 
have health benefits. (NEMA, No. 26 at 
pp. 2–3) However, DOE notes that 
although spectrally-enhanced lighting 
has benefits, higher CCT lamps do emit 
a different color light that may not be 
appropriate for all applications. Given 
the effect on utility and the fact that 
lamp efficacy usually decreases with 
higher color temperatures, it is 
appropriate to establish different 
product classes based on CCT. 
DOE agrees that a continuous function 
is not possible because increasing the 
CCT does not lead to proportional 
reductions in lumens per watt. This 
occurs because design factors that do 
not have a linear relationship with 
lumens per watt, such as rare earth 
phosphor mix and reformulation, must 
be employed to maintain efficacy, 
particularly as CCT increases. 
DOE disagrees that a 4,900K division 
should be used rather than the proposed 
4,500K division. If DOE were to use a 
4,900K division and manufacturers 
introduced a 4,850K lamp to the market, 
it would be subject to standards based 
on the performance of a 4,100k lamp, 
which might be difficult to meet, as 
4,100K lamps are generally more 
efficacious than their higher CCT 
counterparts. Likewise, if DOE used a 
4,200K division and manufacturers 
developed a 4,300K lamp for 
commercial use, it would be subject to 
potentially lower standards based on the 
performance of a 5,000k lamp. This may 
result in a significant loss in potential 
energy savings. Instead, DOE proposes 
to use a 4,500K division, which 
effectively represents the midpoint 
between the most common 
commercially available ‘‘warmer’’ and 
‘‘cooler’’ lamps at 4,100K and 5,000K, 
respectively. By establishing the 
product class division at the midpoint, 
DOE ensures that it is establishing a 
structure that will not subject lamps to 
inappropriately high standards and also 
not result in the loss of potential energy 
savings. 
DOE also disagrees with the Joint 
Comment’s argument for a third product 
class division around 7,900K aimed at 
8,000K lamps. As discussed in section 
III.C.2, DOE is amending its definition 
of ‘‘colored fluorescent lamp,’’ such that 
these lamps above 7,000K would be 
excluded from coverage by energy 
conservation standards. In consideration 
of this exclusion, DOE feels that is 
unnecessary to establish a third product 
class for lamps with a CCT greater than 
7,900K. 
2. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
considered product classes for IRL 
based on the standard-spectrum and 
modified-spectrum of the lamp. DOE 
received numerous comments regarding 
establishing separate product classes 
for: (1) Modified-spectrum lamps; (2) 
long-life lamps; (3) lamp diameter; and 
(4) voltage. The following sections 
summarize and address these 
comments. 
a. Modified-Spectrum Lamps 
Modified-spectrum lamps provide a 
unique performance-related feature to 
consumers, in that they offer a different 
spectrum of light from the typical 
incandescent lamp, much like two 
fluorescent lamps with different CCT 
values. These lamps offer the same 
benefits as fluorescent lamps with 
‘‘cooler’’ CCTs, in that they may ensure 
better color discrimination and often 
appear more similar to natural daylight, 
possibly resulting in psychological 
benefits.20 In addition to providing a 
unique performance feature, DOE also 
understands that the technologies that 
modify the spectral emission from these 
lamps also decrease their efficacy 
because a portion of the light emission 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16939 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
is absorbed by the coating. NEMA and 
GE supported establishing separate 
product classes for modified-spectrum 
lamps. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
21 at p. 105; NEMA, No. 22 at p. 6). 
However, the Joint Comment stated 
that separate product classes are 
unnecessary because modified-spectrum 
products which meet all efficacy levels 
DOE considered in the ANOPR already 
exist in the market place. The Joint 
Comment further argued that additive 
methods, used for some non-IRL 
technologies, boost particular visible 
wavelengths of light to achieve a 
modified spectrum. These methods 
represent a more efficient way to 
achieve a modified spectrum than 
subtractive methods commonly used for 
IRL, which filter particular visible 
wavelengths of light. Therefore, 
according to the Joint Comment, 
establishing a separate product class 
could reduce energy savings because 
modified-spectrum technology would be 
subject to a needlessly lower standard. 
The Joint Comment contended that such 
a situation would run counter to the 
rulemaking’s goals. (Joint Comment, No. 
23 at pp. 14–15) At the public meeting, 
ACEEE and PG&E questioned whether 
consumers receive additional utility 
from modified-spectrum lamps, and, if 
they do, whether it is sufficient to 
warrant a separate product class. ACEEE 
and PG&E suggested DOE analyze the 
energy savings that could be lost with a 
separate product class. PG&E further 
noted that consumers could obtain any 
additional utility that modified- 
spectrum lamps provide from other 
available light sources. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 101–103) PG&E 
commented that modified-spectrum 
lamps occupy significant retail shelf 
space, which suggests they have a 
significant market share, and therefore, 
present a significant energy savings 
opportunity. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at p. 104) 
DOE maintains that modified- 
spectrum lamps provide a unique 
performance-related feature (a different 
spectrum of light from the typical 
incandescent lamp) that standard 
spectrum lamps do not provide. 
However, the coatings used for 
modified-spectrum IRL absorb light 
output, thus reducing the lamps’ 
efficacies. Given the reduction in 
efficacy, DOE believes that some 
modified-spectrum lamps may not be 
able to meet standards if subjected to 
the same levels as standard-spectrum 
lamps. That, in turn, could cause the 
unavailability of such products, thereby 
eliminating this performance-related 
feature from the IRL market. DOE notes 
that the statute directs DOE to maintain 
performance-related features for a 
covered product type. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(4)) 
Regarding the Joint Comment’s 
argument that higher-efficiency, 
additive technologies may be 
substituted for subtractive technologies 
currently used in modified-spectrum 
IRL lamps, DOE is unaware of any 
commercially-available IRL or working 
IRL prototype that employs these 
additive technologies. Although 
modified-spectrum LED products may 
be available, because DOE has 
determined that modified-spectrum 
lamps provide a unique performance- 
related feature, it is unable to subject 
them to standards that would result in 
the elimination of such IRL products 
from the market. Thus, DOE believes it 
is appropriate to establish a separate 
product class for modified-spectrum 
lamps based on their unique 
performance feature and the impact of 
this performance feature on product 
efficacy. 
b. Long-Life Lamps 
DOE received several comments 
regarding IRL with long lifetimes. At the 
public meeting, NEMA commented that 
lamp life is a top consideration for the 
lighting industry’s customers, 
particularly large retailers. NEMA stated 
in its written comments that the current 
long-life lamps on the market might be 
jeopardized by the proposed standard 
levels, which could cause 
manufacturers to reduce lamp life to 
increase efficacy—a scenario not 
necessarily in the market’s interest. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at 
pp. 177–178; NEMA, No. 22 at p. 17) 
Although NEMA did not explicitly 
request a separate product class, the 
Joint Comment argued that DOE should 
not establish a separate product class for 
long-life lamps, noting that other 
existing lamp types, including halogen 
infrared reflector lamps and CFLs, could 
adequately serve long-life applications. 
In support of their position, the 
advocates stated further that Congress 
did not establish a separate class for 
‘‘long life’’ general service incandescent 
lamps. (Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 15) 
DOE considers lifetime an economic 
issue rather than a utility issue, and 
accounts for lifetime in its LCC and NPV 
calculations. Lifetime is not considered 
a utility issue because it does not 
change the light output of the lamp. As 
such, DOE did not establish a separate 
product class based on lamp lifetime. 
For more details, see the engineering 
analysis in section V.C.4.b and chapter 
5 of the TSD. 
c. Lamp Diameter 
In its written comments, NEMA noted 
that smaller diameter lamps— 
specifically, PAR20 lamps—are 
inherently less efficient than larger 
diameter IRL. Manufacturing PAR20 
lamps to be compliant with the same 
efficacy standards as larger lamps would 
be very difficult. NEMA also 
commented that the technology options 
available to larger lamps are not 
necessarily applicable to PAR20 lamps. 
For example, the most efficient double- 
ended infrared halogen burner is 
difficult to use in PAR20 lamps because 
of mounting considerations. (NEMA, 
No. 22 at p. 17) 
In response, DOE believes that the IRL 
diameter provides a distinct utility to 
the consumer (such as the ability of 
reduced diameter lamps to be installed 
in smaller fixtures) and recognizes that 
efficacy declines with a smaller lamp 
diameter. A smaller diameter lamp has 
an inherently lower optical efficiency 
than a larger diameter lamp given a 
similar filament size. Therefore, DOE is 
proposing to establish separate product 
classes for lamps with a diameter of 2.5 
inches or less and lamps with a 
diameter greater than 2.5 inches. 
d. Voltage 
In its written comments, NEMA 
mentioned that DOE’s proposed product 
classes and standards do not address 
how the market actually uses 130 volt 
(V) lamps, which represent a sizable 
portion of standard halogen product 
sales. NEMA stated that customers 
almost always operate these 130V lamps 
at 120V (normal line voltage), which 
doubles their lifetime but reduces their 
efficacy below standard levels. (NEMA, 
No. 22 at p. 16) 
DOE agrees with NEMA and is 
concerned that the operation of 130V 
lamps at 120V has the potential to 
significantly affect energy savings. 
When operated under 120V conditions, 
lamps rated at 130V in compliance with 
existing IRL efficacy standards are 
generally less efficacious than lamps 
using equivalent technology rated at 
120V. Because of this inherent 
difference in efficacy, it may be less 
costly to manufacture a lamp rated at 
130V and tested at 130V that complies 
with a standard than a similar 120V 
lamp complying with the same 
standard. For example, if DOE were to 
adopt a minimum efficacy requirement 
that would effectively require HIR 
technology for 120V lamps, due to 
differences in the test procedures for 
lamps rated at 130V, a 130V lamp may 
only need to employ an improved 
halogen technology, which would be 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2

21 ‘‘Quantum efficiency,’’ in this context, is used 
to quantify the percentage of ultraviolet photons 
absorbed by the phosphor that are then reemitted 
as visible photons. 
less costly. If DOE does not establish a 
separate standard for lamps rated at 
130V, more consumers may purchase 
130V lamps because they are less 
expensive. When consumers operate 
these lamps at 120V, in order to obtain 
sufficient light output, they may use 
more energy than standards-compliant 
120V lamps. This practice would 
increase energy consumption and result 
in lamps operating with a lower efficacy 
than any cost-justified standard level. 
Therefore, to preserve the energy 
savings intended by these standards, 
DOE is proposing to establish two 
separate product classes: (1) Lamps with 
a rated voltage less than 125V, and (2) 
lamps with a rated voltage greater than 
or equal to 125V. 
DOE recognizes that there are other 
possible approaches for addressing this 
issue of the operational efficacy of 130V 
lamps. One alternative approach would 
be that DOE could require all IRL to be 
tested at 120V, the most common 
application voltage in the market. DOE 
requests comment on this issue. 
B. Screening Analysis 
DOE uses the following four screening 
criteria to determine which design 
options are unsuitable for further 
consideration in the rulemaking: 
(1) Technological Feasibility. DOE 
will consider technologies incorporated 
in commercial products or in working 
prototypes to be technologically 
feasible. 
(2) Practicability to Manufacture, 
Install, and Service. If mass production 
and reliable installation and servicing of 
a technology in commercial products 
could be achieved on the scale 
necessary to serve the relevant market at 
the time the standard comes into effect, 
then DOE will consider that technology 
practicable to manufacture, install, and 
service. 
(3) Adverse Impacts on Product Utility 
or Product Availability. If DOE 
determines a technology would have 
significant adverse impact on the utility 
of the product to significant subgroups 
of consumers, or would result in the 
unavailability of any covered product 
type with performance characteristics 
(including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as products 
generally available in the United States 
at the time, it will not consider this 
technology further. 
(4) Adverse Impacts on Health or 
Safety. If DOE determines that a 
technology will have significant adverse 
impacts on health or safety, it will not 
consider this technology further. 
10 CFR part 430, subpart C, appendix A, 
(4)(a)(4) and (5)(b). 
Considering these criteria, DOE 
compiled a list of design options in the 
March 2008 ANOPR that could be used 
to increase the efficacy of GSFL and IRL 
lamps (Table V.1). 73 FR 13620, 13644 
(March 13, 2008). 
TABLE V.1—GSFL AND IRL DESIGN OPTIONS 
GSFL design options IRL design options 
Highly emissive electrode coatings Higher temperature operation. 
Higher efficiency lamp fill gas composition Thinner filaments. 
Higher efficiency phosphors Efficient filament coiling. 
Glass coatings Efficient filament orientation. 
Higher efficiency lamp diameter Higher efficiency inert fill gas. 
Tungsten-halogen lamps. 
Higher pressure tungsten-halogen lamps. 
Infrared glass coatings. 
Higher efficiency reflector coatings. 
Efficient filament placement. 
DOE received a number of comments 
in response to its list of proposed design 
options, as discussed below. 
1. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
NEMA generally agreed with the list 
of design options, but mentioned that 
for GSFL, further efficacy improvement 
will likely come from improved system 
(lamp-ballast-luminaire) combinations, 
and urged DOE to aim in future 
rulemakings to improve overall systems. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 9; Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 108–109) 
DOE understands that the fluorescent 
lamp is only one part of a fluorescent 
lamp system, which also includes 
ballasts and fixtures. However, DOE 
does not have the authority to regulate 
a fluorescent lamp system. EPCA 
prescribes energy conservation 
standards for certain GSFL (42 U.S.C. 
6295(i)(1)(B)) and fluorescent lamp 
ballasts. (42 U.S.C. 6295(g)(7)) EPCA 
does not contain any standards for 
fluorescent lamp systems. Since EPCA 
directs DOE to amend only the existing 
standards for GSFL and fluorescent 
lamp ballasts, DOE has concluded that 
it does not have the authority to set 
energy conservation standards for 
fluorescent lamp systems. DOE believes 
other approaches, such as building 
codes, are more appropriate for 
regulating a fluorescent lamp system. 
a. Higher-Efficiency Lamp Fill Gas 
Composition 
NEMA commented that fill gas mixes 
are already in use in both T12 and T8 
reduced-wattage energy savings lamps. 
NEMA stated that lamps could be 
manufactured using even higher 
efficiency fill gas compositions; 
however, the actual achieved lumen 
levels may be unacceptable to the 
market. NEMA also commented that 
most manufacturers identify several 
application-limiting issues for both T8 
and T12 reduced-wattage energy saving 
lamps. (NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 7, 11–12) 
DOE agrees that using fill gas 
composition in reduced-wattage lamps 
can lead to lamps with limited utility. 
For example, when marketed, many 
reduced wattage lamps are not 
recommended to be used under low 
lamp ambient temperatures or in drafty 
locations and on dimming ballasts. 
These situations could result in lamp 
starting or stabilization problems, 
striation (alternating light and dark 
bands), pulsing or a reduction in light 
output. Therefore, although DOE 
incorporates reduced-wattage lamps 
into the LCC and NIA (as they are viable 
and likely choices for most GSFL 
applications), DOE does not consider 
any efficacy level that would force 
consumers to purchase these lamps. See 
section V.C.4.a for details. 
b. Higher-Efficiency Phosphors 
NEMA commented that rare earth 
phosphors are already at nearly 100 
percent quantum efficiency.21 While 
slight improvements in efficacy are 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16941 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
possible with a thicker phosphor 
coating, NEMA argued that using this 
option will disproportionately increase 
lamp costs vis-à-vis the performance 
improvement. NEMA stated that the 
opportunities for performance 
improvement using phosphors ‘‘lie in 
tailoring phosphor blends and color 
temperatures to optimize appropriate 
light sources for specific applications.’’ 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 7) 
While DOE agrees that thicker 
phosphor coats may increase cost, DOE 
does not consider increased costs in the 
screening analysis. DOE considers 
potential cost increases in its economic 
analyses. In addition, many higher- 
efficiency GSFL incorporate varying 
thicknesses of rare earth phosphors, or 
blends of halophosphors and rare earth 
phosphors. These lamps, more 
efficacious than their pure 
halophosphor counterparts, show that 
using higher-efficiency phosphors is a 
valid design option that meets all of the 
screening criteria. Therefore, DOE 
believes there is room for significant 
efficacy improvement potential with 
this design option and, thus, continued 
to carry it forward in its analyses. 
c. Glass Coating 
NEMA commented that higher- 
efficiency lamps already use glass 
coatings. NEMA also stated that while 
opportunities exist to improve this 
technology, manufacturers need to 
balance costs and performance. (NEMA, 
No. 22 at p. 7) DOE recognizes that costs 
may increase with this technology 
option, but as stated earlier, DOE does 
not consider the impacts of cost in its 
screening analysis. Therefore, DOE has 
included glass coatings as a design 
option for GSFL, where prototypes or 
commercially-available products exist. 
d. Lamp Diameter 
NEMA commented that lamp 
diameter is already used to optimize 
luminaire optics and system efficacy, 
but not to improve lamp efficacy. 
According to NEMA, further 
improvements in performance can come 
from new luminaire designs based on 
different diameter lamps, but will be 
limited by lumen packages and the 
distance between the light source and 
the luminaire surfaces. (NEMA, No. 22 
at p. 7) 
In response to this comment, DOE 
only considered lamp diameter as a 
design option in the migration from T12 
to T8 lamps. DOE’s research indicates 
that T8 lamps are common replacements 
for T12 lamps. Although the total lumen 
output of T8 lamps is often lower than 
that of T12 lamps, these differences in 
lumen outputs (on the order of 10 
percent) do not seem to be significant 
enough to affect consumer utility. 
Conversely, although the total lumen 
output of 4-foot T5 MiniBP lamps can 
be similar to 4-foot T8 MBP and 4-foot 
T12 MBP lamps, the lumen output is 
emitted from a more concentrated light 
source. DOE’s research indicates that T5 
lamps’ higher light concentrations (and 
therefore brightness) may require greater 
distances between the light source and 
illuminated surfaces. Due to this 
limitation in utility, DOE did not 
consider migration to a lamp diameter 
associated with T5 lamps to be a design 
option to improve the efficacy of T8 and 
T12 lamps. 
e. Multi-Photon Phosphors 
NEMA commented that although 
commercial multi-photon phosphors are 
theoretically possible, they have yet to 
be developed, despite 30 to 40 years of 
research. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 7) As 
explained in chapter 3 of the TSD, 
because multi-photon phosphors emit 
more than one visible photon for each 
incident ultraviolet photon, a lamp 
would be able to emit more light for the 
same amount of power, thereby 
increasing efficacy. DOE agrees that this 
technology is not sufficiently mature as 
to warrant further analysis, so DOE has 
screened out this technology option in 
the March 2008 ANOPR. 
2. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
NEMA does not believe that xenon, a 
higher-efficiency inert fill gas, should be 
considered a design option because 
there is a limited supply of this gas and 
prices are increasing rapidly. (NEMA, 
No. 22 at p. 8; Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 108–109) 
Although price is not considered in 
the screening criteria, DOE did conduct 
an in-depth market assessment of the 
supply of xenon, and the potential 
impact of xenon supply limitations on 
IRL standard levels. DOE determined 
that although xenon is a rare gas, its 
supply is sufficiently large to 
incorporate into all IRL and that the 
xenon supply would not affect IRL 
product availability. A more detailed 
analysis of xenon and its availability 
can be found in appendix 3B of the 
TSD. 
C. Engineering Analysis 
For each product class, the 
engineering analysis identifies potential, 
increasing efficacy levels above the level 
of the baseline model. Those 
technologies not eliminated in the 
screening analysis (design options) are 
inputs to this process. Design options 
consist of discrete technologies (e.g., 
infrared reflective coatings, rare-earth 
phosphor mixes). As detailed in the 
March 2008 ANOPR, to ensure that 
efficacy levels analyzed are 
technologically feasible, DOE 
concentrated its efforts on developing 
product efficacy levels associated with 
‘‘lamp designs,’’ based upon 
commercially-available lamps that 
incorporate a range of design options in 
the engineering analysis. 73 FR 13620, 
13645 (March 13, 2008). However, when 
necessary, DOE supplemented 
commercially available product 
information with an examination of the 
improved performance attributable to 
discrete technologies so that a substitute 
lamp at each efficacy level would be 
available for each baseline lamp. 
In energy conservation standard 
rulemakings for other products, DOE 
often develops cost-efficiency 
relationships in the engineering 
analysis. However, for this lamps 
rulemaking, DOE derived efficacy levels 
in the engineering analysis and end-user 
prices in the product price 
determination. By combining the results 
of the engineering analysis and the 
product price determination, DOE 
derived typical inputs for use in the 
LCC and NIA. See the chapter 7 of the 
TSD for further details on the product 
price determination. 
1. Approach 
For the NOPR, DOE is using the same 
methodology for the engineering 
analysis that was detailed in the March 
2008 ANOPR. 73 FR 13620, 13645–46 
(March 13, 2008). The following is a 
summary of the steps taken in the 
engineering analysis: 
• Step 1: Select Representative Product 
Classes 
• Step 2: Select Baseline Lamps 
• Step 3: Identify Lamp or Lamp-and- 
Ballast Designs 
• Step 4: Develop Efficiency Levels. 
A more detailed discussion of the 
methodology DOE followed to perform 
the engineering analysis can be found in 
the engineering analysis chapter of the 
TSD (chapter 5). 
2. Representative Product Classes 
As discussed in section 0 of this 
notice, DOE proposes establishing 
several product classes for GSFL and 
IRL. DOE proposes eight product classes 
across the range of covered GSFL based 
on utility and performance features, 
such as: (1) Physical constraints of 
lamps (i.e., lamp shape and length); (2) 
lumen package (i.e., standard versus 
high output); and (3) correlated color 
temperature. For IRL, DOE proposes 
eight product classes based on 
spectrum, lamp diameter, and rated

voltage. As detailed in the March 2008 
ANOPR, due to scheduling and resource 
constraints, DOE was not able to analyze 
each and every product class. 73 FR 
13620, 13646 (March 13, 2008). Instead, 
DOE carefully selected certain product 
classes to analyze, and then scaled its 
analytical findings for those 
representative product classes to other 
product classes that were not analyzed. 
73 FR 13620, 13652 (March 13, 2008). 
While DOE received several stakeholder 
comments regarding methods of scaling 
to product classes not analyzed 
(discussed in section V.C.7), DOE did 
not receive objections to the decision to 
scale to certain product classes and the 
representative product classes chosen in 
the March 2008 ANOPR. 
For the NOPR, similar to its approach 
in the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
continued to analyze 4-foot medium 
bipin, 8-foot single pin slimline, and 8- 
foot recessed double-contact high 
output GSFL product classes with CCTs 
less than or equal to 4,500K. DOE did 
not explicitly analyze U-shaped lamps, 
but instead scaled the results of the 4- 
foot medium bipin class analysis. In 
addition, DOE has decided to analyze 4- 
foot T5 miniature bipin standard output 
lamps and 4-foot T5 miniature bipin 
high output lamps with CCTs less than 
or equal to 4,500K as representative 
product classes. 
As discussed in section A.2, DOE 
chose to subdivide IRL into eight 
product classes with three subdivisions: 
(1) High versus low voltage; (2) large 
versus small diameter lamps; and (3) 
modified spectrum versus standard 
spectrum. As detailed in the March 
2008 ANOPR, DOE chose to analyze the 
standard-spectrum incandescent 
reflector product class because 
standard-spectrum lamps are more 
common than modified-spectrum 
lamps. 73 FR 13620, 13648 (March 13, 
2008). After analyzing catalog data and 
talking to industry experts, DOE found 
that lamps with a diameter greater than 
2.5 inches are more common than lamps 
of smaller diameters. Lamps with 
voltage ratings less than 125V also are 
more common than lamps with higher 
voltage ratings. Therefore, for the NOPR, 
DOE proposes to analyze the product 
class characterized by standard 
spectrum, voltage less than 125V, and 
diameter greater than 2.5 inches. For 
further information on representative 
product classes, see chapter 5 of the 
TSD. 
3. Baseline Lamps and Systems 
Once DOE identified the 
representative product classes for 
analysis, DOE selected the 
representative units for analysis (i.e., 
baseline lamps) from within each 
product class. These representative 
units are generally what DOE believes to 
be the most common, least efficacious 
lamps in their respective product 
classes. DOE chose multiple baseline 
lamps because DOE found that the 
market for each product class is 
segmented into multiple submarkets for 
lamps with slightly different consumer 
utilities. For example, the 40W T12, 
34W T12, and 32W T8 lamps are the 
most common lamps in the commercial 
four-foot medium bipin product class. 
The 34W T12 is a reduced wattage lamp 
that is not as versatile as the 40W T12, 
however, and consumers switching from 
a T12 to a T8 lamp must purchase a new 
ballast. Thus, these lamps are not 
entirely substitutable, so DOE has 
chosen to analyze them as separate 
baselines. DOE’s selection of baseline 
lamps is discussed in further detail 
below. 
a. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
As described in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE took a systems approach 
to its GSFL analysis. 73 FR 13620, 
13649 (March 13, 2008). In this 
approach, DOE selected typical ballasts 
(which provide current to the lamps) to 
pair with each baseline lamp and 
higher-efficacy lamp. Though DOE did 
not consider the ballast as directly 
affecting lamp efficacy, the ballast 
selection does affect the overall system 
efficacy (system input power and total 
lumen output), thereby having a 
significant impact on LCC and NIA 
results. For this reason, DOE considered 
a variety of ballast types (e.g., electronic 
and magnetic) and ballast factors in its 
analysis. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
chose three baseline lamps for 4-foot 
medium bipins less than or equal to 
4,500K (installed on T8 electronic and 
T12 magnetic ballasts), three baseline 
lamps for 8-foot single pin slimlines less 
than or equal to 4,500K (installed on T8 
electronic and T12 magnetic ballasts), 
and two baseline lamps for 8-foot 
recessed double-contact HOs less than 
or equal to 4,500K (installed on T8 
magnetic and T12 magnetic ballasts). 73 
FR 13620, 13647 (March 13, 2008). DOE 
did not receive any comments on 
baseline lamps for the commercial and 
industrial sectors and thus has retained 
all baseline lamps from the March 2008 
ANOPR. However, as discussed below, 
DOE did receive comments regarding 
additional sectors to analyze and the 
ballast selected to pair with the 8-foot 
RDC HO baseline lamps. In addition, 
DOE developed baseline lamp-and- 
ballast systems for the 4-foot T5 MiniBP 
SO and HO product classes. 
Regarding GSFL operating in the 
residential sector, several stakeholders 
commented that residential T12 ballasts 
will continue to be sold past 2009 and 
that the residential applications of these 
ballasts represent a large portion of the 
remaining market for these lamps. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 20, 25; Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 276– 
277) PG&E stated that T12 lamps on 
magnetic ballasts continue to exist in 
the residential sector in California. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 
279) The Joint Comment also stated that 
residential applications need to be 
factored into the analysis, but because 
the same lamps can be used in all 
sectors, a separate analysis is not 
needed for the residential sector. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 10) 
In response, in this NOPR, DOE has 
analyzed GSFL in the residential sector. 
In interviews with manufacturers and 
by reviewing manufacturer product 
catalogs, DOE found that a significant 
portion of T12 4-foot medium bipin 
lamps operate in the residential sector. 
DOE is maintaining the same standards 
case lamps used in the commercial and 
industrial sectors for 4-foot medium 
bipins in the residential sector because, 
as the Joint Comment stated, the same 
lamps can be used in all sectors. 
However, DOE is choosing a separate 
baseline lamp for the residential 4-foot 
medium bipin analysis. Conversations 
with industry experts and a published 
study prepared for PG&E 22 have 
revealed that residential consumers are 
more likely to buy 40W T12 lamps 
because 32W T8 lamps and 34W T12 
lamps are less common. Therefore, in 
the residential sector, DOE is only 
analyzing the 40W T12 lamp as a 
baseline lamp. In addition, reviewing 
available catalog information, DOE has 
found that the most common 40W T12 
lamp sold in the residential sector is 
different from the 40W T12 baseline 
lamp presented in the March 2008 
ANOPR for the commercial and 
industrial sectors. 73 FR 13620, 13647 
(March 13, 2008). Therefore, in the 
NOPR, DOE has chosen a 40W T12 
baseline lamp for the residential sector 
that has a slightly lower efficacy (76.8 
lm/W) and shorter lifetime (15,000 
hours) than the typical 40W T12 lamp 
sold in the commercial sector.

(Jan. 2000). Available at: http:// 
www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/
appliance_standards/residential/
gs_fluorescent_0100_r.html. 
After reviewing manufacturer 
literature and the study prepared for 
PG&E on fixtures in the residential 
sector,23 DOE found that the most 
common residential sector ballast is a 
low-power-factor 2-lamp magnetic T12 
system with a ballast factor of 0.68. 
Therefore, for the NOPR, DOE paired 
the baseline lamp with this ballast for 
the residential sector analysis. 
Because DOE has decided to cover 
and analyze 4-foot T5 miniature bipin 
standard output and 4-foot T5 miniature 
bipin high output lamps in this 
rulemaking (section 0 of this notice), 
DOE established baseline lamps for 
these two product classes. NEMA and 
the Joint Comment both stated that if 
DOE does not cover T5 lamps, then less 
efficient, halophosphor T5 lamps may 
enter the market place. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 71–72; Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 3) Because these 
less efficient halophosphor T5 lamps are 
not on the market today, DOE developed 
model T5 halophosphor lamps in its 
engineering analysis. To create these 
model T5 lamps, DOE used efficacy data 
from short halophosphor fluorescent T5 
lamps currently available and 
developed a relationship between length 
and efficacy. DOE validated this 
relationship by comparing it to previous 
industry research. DOE then used this 
relationship to determine the efficacies 
of a halophosphor 4-foot T5 miniature 
bipin standard output lamp and a 
halophosphor 4-foot halophosphor T5 
miniature bipin HO lamps. Specifically, 
the baseline 4-foot miniature bipin 
standard output lamp is 28W with an 
efficacy of 86 lm/W and a lifetime of 
20,000 hours. The baseline 4-foot 
miniature bipin high output lamp is 
54W with an efficacy of 77 lm/W and a 
lifetime of 20,000 hours. DOE used 
these lamps as baseline lamps to 
establish the economic impacts of a 
standard that would eliminate such 
lamps. For more information about 
these and other baseline lamps, see 
chapter 5 and appendix 5B of the TSD. 
In its review of manufacturer 
literature, DOE found that a range of 
ballast factors are available for the 4-foot 
T5 product classes, and the most 
common ballast is a 2-lamp electronic 
ballast. DOE attempts to compare lamp- 
and-ballast systems with similar light 
output so that consumers switching to 
more efficient systems will be able to 
preserve lumen output. In order for the 
halophosphor baseline T5 lamps to 
produce light output similar to the 
standards-case T5 lamps, they must be 
paired with the highest ballast factor 
ballasts available on the market today. 
Therefore, in the NOPR, DOE is pairing 
its baseline 4-foot T5 SO miniature 
bipin lamp with a 1.15 ballast factor 
ballast, and its baseline 4-foot T5 
miniature bipin HO lamp with a 1.0 
ballast factor ballast. For further detail 
on the baseline lamps and ballasts 
selected for the 4-foot T5 product 
classes, see chapter 5 of the TSD. 
DOE proposed in the March 2008 
ANOPR that the most common ballast in 
use for the 8-foot T12 recessed double- 
contact, high-output product class is an 
electronic rapid-start ballast. (March 
2008 ANOPR TSD chapter 5). Several 
stakeholders commented at the public 
meeting that the majority of 8-foot T12 
high-output ballasts installed today are 
magnetic. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at pp. 124–125; Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at p. 126) NEMA and 
the Joint Comment also commented that 
magnetic T12 high-output ballasts are 
allowed under current regulations and, 
therefore, will continue to be sold past 
2009. (Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 7; 
NEMA, No. 22 at p. 25) Because the 
majority of the installed base is 
magnetic, DOE is revising its baseline 
T12 high-output ballast to be magnetic 
for the life-cycle cost analysis. However, 
DOE recognizes that historical 
shipments from the 2000 rulemaking on 
GSFL ballasts (hereafter ‘‘2000 Ballast 
Rule’’) (62 FR 56740 (Sept. 19, 2000)) 
indicate that T12 electronic high-output 
ballasts are also increasingly being 
shipped.24 Therefore, in the national 
impacts analysis, DOE modeled the 
installed base on magnetic ballasts, and 
forecasted shipments of T12 high-output 
lamps operating on both electronic and 
magnetic ballasts in the national 
impacts analysis. For further detail 
regarding the revised baseline lamps 
and systems for the 8-foot RDC HO 
product class, see chapter 5 of the TSD. 
DOE reviewed the remaining baseline 
lamp-and-ballast systems discussed in 
the March 2008 ANOPR and believes 
they are still appropriate, as DOE 
received no comments concerning these 
systems. Therefore, DOE maintained the 
same number of lamps per system and 
ballasts discussed in the March 2008 
ANOPR for the 4-foot medium bipin and 
8-foot single pin slimline product 
classes analyzed in the commercial and 
industrial sectors. 73 FR 13620, 13647 
(March 13, 2008). 
b. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
proposed three baseline lamps for the 
IRL representative product class. 73 FR 
13620, 13648 (March 13, 2008). These 
baseline lamps, all parabolic reflector 
(PAR) halogen baseline lamps, are 
regulated by EPCA and meet the EPCA 
standard. (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)) NEMA 
commented that because BR lamps 
remain on the market due to a Federal 
exemption and because they are 
commonly used in consumer 
applications, the BR lamp should be the 
baseline lamp instead of the halogen 
PAR. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 
at p. 162; NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 10, 16, 
and 18) NEMA also contends that 
because DOE selected halogen PAR 
lamps as the baseline, DOE is losing the 
opportunity to show additional energy 
savings. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 16) 
In response, although BR lamps are a 
common incandescent reflector lamp on 
the market today, DOE believes they 
should not be selected as baseline lamps 
in the engineering analysis of this 
rulemaking for the reasons that follow. 
The baseline lamp should be typical of 
covered lamps within a certain product 
class. The most common BR lamp is the 
65W BR lamp, which remains on the 
market due to Federal exemptions. 
Because the 65W BR lamp is not 
covered in this rulemaking, it cannot be 
a baseline lamp. In addition, consumers 
purchasing the 65W BR lamp would not 
be affected by the amended standards 
proposed in this NOPR. Therefore, DOE 
would not be able to demonstrate 
additional energy savings for those 
consumers purchasing the 65W BR lamp 
even if it were able to select that lamp 
as a baseline lamp. 
Although certain BR lamps are 
covered in this rulemaking, DOE 
predicts that the most typical lamp sold 
on the market in 2012 will continue to 
be the halogen PAR lamp. EISA 2007 
required that all non-exempted BR 
lamps meet EPCA standards by January 
1, 2008. Because these lamps are similar 
in efficacy and price to the halogen 
PAR, the most common reflector lamps 
meeting the EPCA standard in 2007, 
DOE is continuing to choose halogen 
PAR lamps as the baseline lamp for the 
NOPR. 
NEMA commented that current PAR 
baseline lamps have higher efficacy than 
the lamps sold in 1992 (when EPACT 
1992 prescribed IRL standards), due to 
optical improvements. (NEMA, No. 22 
at p. 16) However, because DOE prefers 
that the baseline lamp be typical of 
lamps sold on the market today, DOE is 
maintaining the same 90W PAR baseline 
lamp and 75W PAR baseline lamp used 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16944 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
in the March 2008 ANOPR. 73 FR 
13620, 13648 (March 13, 2008). DOE 
now believes that the 50W PAR30 
baseline lamp with a lifetime of 3,000 
hours and an efficacy of 11.6 lm/W 
presented in the March 2008 ANOPR is 
not typical of lamps sold on the market 
today. 73 FR 13620, 13648 (March 13, 
2008). Therefore, for this notice, DOE is 
choosing a 50W PAR30 lamp with an 
efficacy of 14.2 lm/W and a lifetime of 
3,000 hours. Based on an examination of 
manufacturer product catalogs, DOE 
believes that this lamp is a higher- 
volume product than the baseline lamp 
presented in the March 2008 ANOPR. 
The lamp choice is consistent with 
advice DOE received from GE to use 
lamps from major manufacturers in the 
IRL analysis for modified-spectrum 
lamps. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
21 at p. 170) For further detail on IRL 
baseline lamps, see chapter 5 of the 
TSD. 
4. Lamp and Lamp-and-Ballast Designs 
As described in the March 2008 
ANOPR, in the engineering analysis, 
DOE considered only ‘‘design 
options’’—technology options used to 
improve lamp efficacy that were not 
eliminated in the screening analysis. 73 
FR 13620, 13644 (March 13, 2008). 
DOE’s selection of design options 
guided its selection of lamp and lamp- 
and-ballast designs and efficacy levels. 
For example, for GSFL, DOE noted 
groupings around the types of phosphor 
used and the wall thickness of those 
phosphors. Regarding IRL, DOE 
identified natural ‘‘technology-based’’ 
divisions in the market around the type 
of incandescent technology (i.e., 
halogen or HIR) used. DOE also 
identified certain technology options 
and created model lamps to represent 
the efficacy those technology options 
could achieve. 
As described in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE also accounted for lumen 
output when DOE established lamp 
designs for its analyses. 73 FR 13620, 
13648 (March 13, 2008). For the LCC 
analysis, DOE considered those lamps 
(or lamp-and-ballast systems) that: (1) 
Emit lumens equal to the lumen output 
of the baseline lamp or lamp-and-ballast 
system, or below that lamp by no more 
than 10 percent; and (2) result in energy 
savings. DOE took this approach in 
order to accurately characterize the cost- 
effectiveness of a particular efficacy 
level if a consumer makes an informed 
decision that maintains light output. 
However, as DOE recognizes that all 
consumers may not make such 
decisions, lamp or lamp-and-ballast 
designs that under-illuminate, over- 
illuminate, or do not result in energy 
savings are considered in the NIA. 
a. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
As described in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE used a systems approach 
for the fluorescent lamp analysis, 
because DOE recognizes that both lamps 
and ballasts determine a system’s energy 
use and the overall system lumen 
output. 73 FR 13620, 13649 (March 13, 
2008). This approach allows DOE to 
select a variety of lamp-and-ballast 
designs that meet a given efficacy level. 
Generally, DOE chose its potential 
design options by selecting 
commercially-available fluorescent 
lamps at higher efficacies than the 
baseline lamps. These higher efficacies 
are achieved through the design options 
described in the screening analysis. 
After selecting these higher-efficacy 
lamps, DOE selected lamp-and-ballast 
combinations for the LCC that both save 
energy and maintain comparable lumen 
output. For instances when the 
consumer is replacing only the lamp, 
DOE selected a reduced-wattage, higher- 
efficacy lamp for use on the existing 
ballast. For instances when the 
consumer is replacing both the lamp 
and the ballast, DOE was able to obtain 
energy savings and maintain 
comparable lumen output using a 
variety of lamp-and-ballast 
combinations. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
stated that it was not able to identify 
any application restrictions on using 
reduced-wattage fluorescent lamps, so 
therefore, DOE included reduced- 
wattage lamps as design options in the 
ANOPR. 73 FR 13620, 13650 (March 13, 
2008). NEMA responded that most 
manufacturers identify several 
application issues for these lamps. For 
example, NEMA stated that reduced- 
wattage T8 lamps cannot be used with 
certain rapid-start circuits, at 
temperatures below 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit (°F) (or 70 °F for the 25W 
lamp), in drafty locations, in air- 
handling fixtures, on low-power-factor 
ballasts, on dimming ballasts, or on an 
inverter-operated emergency lighting 
system, unless the equipment is 
specifically listed for use with the 
reduced-wattage lamp in question. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 10) NEMA also 
stated that reduced-wattage T12 lamps 
cannot be used at temperatures below 
60 °F, in drafty locations, on low-power- 
factor ballasts, on reduced-light-output 
ballasts, on dimming ballasts, or on 
inverter-operated emergency lighting 
systems unless the equipment is 
specifically listed for use with the 
reduced-wattage lamp in question. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 11) 
In response, DOE recognizes that 
reduced-wattage lamps cannot be used 
in certain applications and that 
consumers should not be subject to any 
decrease in utility and performance due 
to an amended energy conservation 
standard. However, because consumers 
have the opportunity to purchase at 
least one full-wattage T12 or T8 lamp at 
each efficacy level, consumer utility 
will not be reduced by amending the 
existing energy conservation standard. 
There are many applications where 
reduced-wattage lamps are appropriate. 
Therefore, DOE is modeling reduced- 
wattage lamps in the engineering 
analysis. In the NIA, DOE did not shift 
all consumers to reduced-wattage lamps 
in response to an energy conservation 
standard, because reduced-wattage 
lamps cannot be used in certain 
applications. Specifically, the majority 
of residential consumers have low- 
power-factor ballasts not designed to 
operate 34W T12 lamps. These 
assumptions are displayed in the NIA 
market-share matrices described in 
chapter 10 of the TSD. 
b. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
selected lamp designs and candidate 
standard levels (CSLs) by observing 
natural efficacy divisions in the 
marketplace that correspond to the use 
of technologies (e.g., halogen capsules, 
HIR technology, and improved reflector 
coatings) to increase lamp efficacy. 73 
FR 13620, 13650 (March 13, 2008). 
CSL1, as set forth in the March 2008 
ANOPR, could be met with a halogen 
lamp using a silverized reflector coating. 
CSL2 could be met with a 3,000-hour 
halogen infrared (IR) lamp. CSL3 could 
be met with an improved 4,000-hour 
halogen infrared lamp. CSL3 could also 
be achieved by using design options like 
a silverized reflector coating with a 
halogen infrared burner, or improved 
filament placement and higher 
efficiency inert fill gases in conjunction 
with a halogen infrared burner. 
At the public meeting and through 
written comments, NEMA proposed 
several changes to the lamp designs and 
efficacy levels DOE identified for the 
IRL engineering analysis. NEMA 
suggested that DOE should analyze four 
efficacy levels, beginning with one 
slightly above EPCA and ending with 
the max-tech candidate standard level 
analyzed in the March 2008 ANOPR. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 17) However, the 
efficacies of the baseline lamps chosen 
in the engineering analysis are above the 
lowest NEMA-proposed efficacy level. 
Therefore, because NEMA’s lowest 
proposed efficacy level would not raise 
the efficacies of the most common

25 DOE notes that it would clearly be 
technologically feasible for manufacturers to adopt 
a product design that surpasses the levels specified 
in CSL1 (e.g., using technologies that meet CSL2) 
and also avoids use of the proprietary technology 
in question. However, if DOE were to adopt CSL1, 
as presented in the March 2008 ANOPR, such 
manufacturers would be at a competitive 
disadvantage as compared to manufacturers who 
are able to access the patented technology.

Energy Efficient Lamp,’’ U.S. Patent 6,773,141 
(August 10, 2004). 
reflector lamps on the market today, 
DOE did not consider it in this NOPR. 
NEMA commented that DOE should 
also consider in its NOPR an efficacy 
level that can be met with non-standard 
halogen or infrared halogen lamps. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 18) This standard 
level would lie between the first efficacy 
level proposed by NEMA and the first 
candidate standard level (CSL1) 
proposed by DOE in the March 2008 
ANOPR. 73 FR 13620, 13651 (March 13, 
2008). To model the technologies that 
meet this efficacy level, DOE modeled 
an improved halogen lamp that uses 
xenon, a higher efficiency inert fill gas. 
NEMA commented that DOE should 
not analyze CSL1 presented in the 
March 2008 ANOPR because that level 
is based on the silverized reflector 
coating, a patented technology.25 
(NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 16–17; Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 157– 
158) Other stakeholders commented that 
DOE should research when the patent 
on the silver technology expires, 
because the standard does not go into 
effect until 2012. (Joint Comment, No. 
23 at p. 15) The Joint Comment stated 
that DOE should research viable 
alternatives that can be used to reach 
the first CSL if the silverized reflector 
coating is indeed patented. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 15) 
In response to these stakeholder 
comments, DOE researched the 
silverized reflector technology and 
found that the patent for that technology 
expires in December 2019.26 Therefore, 
for the purpose of this rulemaking, DOE 
considers the silverized reflector coating 
a proprietary technology. As discussed 
during the Framework stage of this 
rulemaking, DOE only considers 
proprietary designs in its engineering 
analysis if there are other technology 
pathways to meet that efficacy level. 
DOE researched possible lamp designs 
for the March 2008 ANOPR’s first CSL 
and found that a halogen lamp with a 
silverized reflector coating is the only 
improved halogen technology that can 
meet the March 2008 ANOPR CSL1. 
However, a slightly lower level can be 
achieved with an HIR lamp that has a 
6,000-hour lifetime. Therefore, DOE is 
considering a slightly lower level that 
can be met by both long-life HIR lamp 
designs and silverized reflector coating 
lamp designs in the NOPR. In its 
analysis of this level, DOE considers 
both lamp designs as viable consumer 
options. 
NEMA commented that DOE should 
lower CSL2, because longer life lamps 
would be in jeopardy of being 
eliminated from the marketplace. 
Because longer life products typically 
have lower efficacies, manufacturers 
may need to reduce lamp life to meet a 
particular efficacy level. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 177–178; 
NEMA, No. 22 at p. 16; Joint Comment, 
No. 23 at p. 15) Although increased 
lifetime reduces a lamp’s efficacy, DOE 
believes that lifetime is a consumer 
economic issue rather than a utility 
issue. In addition, the IRL at each 
standard level can be manufactured 
with lifetimes equal to or greater than 
the lifetimes of the baseline lamp. 
Therefore, consumers who are 
purchasing the baseline lamp will 
continue to be able to purchase a lamp 
with a similar lifetime in the standards 
case. Finally, DOE has conducted an 
analysis to assess the impact of 
standards on longer lifetime lamps. 
Based on this analysis, documented in 
appendix 5D of the TSD, DOE is 
reasonably certain that even under the 
highest efficacy level analyzed in this 
NOPR, 6,000 hour lifetime lamps are 
technologically feasible. For all of these 
reasons, DOE maintained the lamp 
designs and efficacy level for CSL2 
described in the March 2008 ANOPR. 
Similar to its comments related to 
CSL1, NEMA commented that CSL3 is 
problematic because it is also based on 
the silverized reflector coating, a 
patented technology. (NEMA, No. 22 at 
p. 17; Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 
at pp. 157–158) 
In its conversations with 
manufacturers and review of 
manufacturer catalogs, DOE found that 
CSL3 is achievable using technologies 
other than a silverized reflector coating. 
For example, other non-patented types 
of improved reflectors and higher- 
efficiency IR coatings can be used to 
reach this level. In fact, all major 
manufacturers produce two or more 
lamps that exceed this level, some of 
which are not dependent on the 
proprietary silverized reflector. 
Therefore, because there are alternate 
technology pathways to this level, DOE 
maintained the March 2008 ANOPR 
CSL3 as efficacy level 4 in the NOPR. 
This efficacy level is consistent with 
CSL4 proposed by NEMA in its 
comment. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 17) 
Finally, DOE conducted additional 
market research and discovered that IRL 
with efficacies significantly higher than 
the ANOPR CSL3 (or NOPR EL4) are 
being sold by one major manufacturer. 
These IRL are marketed as halogen 
infrared lamps with a silverized 
reflector, improved IR coating, and a 
lifetime of 4,200 hours. Therefore, in 
order to meet the requirement to analyze 
the highest technologically feasible 
level, for the NOPR, DOE has added a 
fifth efficacy level (EL5) based on these 
high-efficacy lamps. Although, to DOE’s 
knowledge, there are no commercially- 
available IRL that do not use the 
patented silverized reflector and are 
equivalent in efficacy, DOE’s research 
indicates that that are alternate, non- 
proprietary technology pathways to 
meet this efficacy level. In particular, 
DOE has extensively researched one 
particular advanced IR coating 
technology. Through interviews with 
manufacturers of this technology and 
through independent testing, DOE has 
preliminarily concluded that by using 
this advanced IR coating technology 
with a standard aluminum reflector, 
manufacturers can produce an IRL with 
an efficacy that exceeds EL5. For further 
detail on DOE’s research on this 
technology, see appendix 5D of the TSD. 
In summary, EL1 is based on an 
improved halogen lamp that uses xenon, 
a higher-efficiency inert fill gas. EL2 is 
based on a halogen infrared lamp with 
a lifetime of 6,000 hours; a halogen 
lamp using a silverized reflector coating 
could also meet this EL. EL3 is 
associated with a 3,000-hour halogen 
infrared lamp; this EL is more efficient 
than EL2 due to higher temperature 
operation of the filament. EL4 is based 
on a 4,000-hour improved halogen 
infrared lamp; improvements in the 
halogen infrared lamp could be made by 
using a double-ended halogen infrared 
burner, higher-efficiency inert fill gases, 
and efficient filament orientation. EL5 is 
based on a 4,200-hour halogen infrared 
lamps (even further improved); these 
further improvements include an 
improved reflector, IR coating, or 
filament design that produces higher- 
temperature operation (and may reduce 
lifetime to 3,000 hours). 
5. Efficiency Levels 
a. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
i. Revisions to ANOPR Efficiency Levels 
For the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
developed CSLs for GSFL by dividing 
initial lumen output by the ANSI rated 
wattages of commercially-available 
lamps, resulting in rated lamp efficacies. 
In response to the potential GSFL 
efficacy levels presented in the March 
2008 ANOPR, NEMA commented on 
several reasons why the association 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16946 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
believes that the efficacy levels need to 
be revised. NEMA’s comments regarding 
the efficacy levels considered in the 
March 2008 ANOPR can be divided into 
five categories: (1) The appropriateness 
of using ANSI rated wattages in the 
calculation of lumens per watt; (2) 
consideration of variability in 
production of GSFL; (3) manufacturing 
process limitations related to specialty 
products; (4) consideration of 
adjustments to photometry calibrations; 
and (5) the appropriateness of 
establishing efficacy levels to the 
nearest tenth of a lumen per watt. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 13–14) In 
consideration of the above issues, 
NEMA suggested revised efficacy levels 
that could achieve the same results as 
the efficacy levels considered in the 
March 2008 ANOPR. 
First, in support of lowering the 
March 2008 ANOPR efficacy levels, 
NEMA argued that ANSI rated wattages 
of GSFL are not necessarily 
representative of long-term reference 
watts. NEMA further stated that in many 
cases the actual lamp reference watts are 
greater than the ANSI designated value. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 14) Second, NEMA 
commented on production variability 
and its impact on the resulting 
measured lamp efficacies. NEMA stated 
that DOE should not use nominal 
catalog initial lumen values when 
developing efficacy levels, as they do 
not reflect statistical lot-to-lot 
production variation. It also argued that 
as lamp lumens per watt is not a 
controlled process element in 
production or a product rating, larger 
tolerances may be required. NEMA 
further stated that lumens per watt is 
actually a calculation based on two 
primary process control elements: (1) 
Watts and (2) lumens. When practical 
production variation in lamp wattage 
(above ANSI-designated values) and 
lamp lumens (below catalog initial 
lumens) combine, the resulting variation 
in lumens per watt may be larger than 
expected. NEMA stated that DOE’s 
proposed efficacy levels should be 
lowered to account for these tolerances. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 14) 
In consultation with the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST), DOE has investigated this issue 
thoroughly, and DOE agrees with NEMA 
on several points. By analyzing 
manufacturer compliance reports 
(submitted to DOE for existing GSFL 
energy conservation standards), DOE 
found that efficacies of lamps when 
reported for the purpose of compliance 
often vary from catalog-rated values. 
Specifically, DOE agrees that ANSI 
designated rated wattages may not be 
appropriate in calculating efficacy. In 
fact, the test procedures for GSFL 
incorporate a tolerance factor comparing 
measured lamp wattage to ANSI-rated 
wattage. DOE acknowledges that this 
tolerance factor could in fact 
significantly alter the measured efficacy 
of the lamps from the rated efficacy. In 
addition, DOE agrees that using rated 
lamp efficacy does not sufficiently 
account for lot-to-lot production 
variability. For this reason, to establish 
revised GSFL efficacy levels, DOE 
proposes to use lamp efficacy values 
submitted to DOE over the past 10 years 
for the purpose of compliance with 
existing energy conservation standards. 
Using compliance reports as a basis for 
efficacy standards should ensure that 
DOE is accurately characterizing the 
tested performance of GSFL, accounting 
for the measured wattage effects and 
wattage and lumen output variability as 
discussed above. 
Further remarking on the effects of 
production variability, NEMA argued 
that it is inappropriate to use a small 
number of test samples to calculate a 
lumen-per-watt efficacy level. NEMA 
stated that its suggested levels 
incorporate a safety factor to take into 
account manufacturer process 
variations. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 14) 
While DOE appreciates NEMA’s input, 
it disagrees that the sample size is 
inappropriate. At NEMA’s suggestion, a 
sample size of 21 lamps was originally 
established for reporting requirements 
in the 1997 test procedure rulemaking. 
62 FR 29222, 29229 (May 29, 1997). The 
reported efficacy values are obtained by 
testing at least three lamps 
manufactured each month for at least 7 
months out of a 12-month period. Upon 
receiving NEMA’s comment, DOE 
consulted with NIST and has tentatively 
concluded that the minimum of 21 
samples is sufficiently large sample size, 
assuming a normal distribution. In 
addition, by using the compliance 
report efficacies, DOE believes that it is 
accounting for statistical variations due 
to differences in production. The 
efficacy reported for compliance is 
related to the lower limit of the 95- 
percent confidence interval. This 
interval represents variation over the 
whole population of production, not 
only the sample size. 62 FR 29222, 
29230 (May 29, 1997). 
Third, NEMA commented that the 
proposed efficacy levels should be 
lowered to account for realistic 
production and manufacturing process 
limitations. NEMA argued that it may 
not be possible to apply the highest 
efficacy levels to some specialty 
products because they do not use high- 
speed production methods. (NEMA, No. 
22 at p. 14) DOE is unaware of specialty 
products that meet the definition of 
GSFL and would be unable to meet the 
proposed standards. Therefore, DOE 
cannot appropriately quantify the 
reduction in efficacy level necessary if 
such situation in fact exists. DOE 
requests further comment and detail on 
this topic. 
Fourth, NEMA claims that because 
the National Voluntary Laboratory 
Accreditation Program (NVLAP) has 
made adjustments to photometry 
calibrations since 1997, the lumens for 
some products have actually been 
reduced. These adjustments would 
thereby merit a reduction in DOE’s 
GSFL efficacy levels. (NEMA, No. 22 at 
p. 14) In response, DOE consulted with 
NIST, which is unaware of any such 
adjustments in photometry calibrations 
since 1997. The lumen scale has not 
changed more than 0.2 percent as a 
result of changes to calibration systems. 
Furthermore, the formula used in the 
compliance reports contains a 2-percent 
de-rate factor to allow for testing 
variations. Therefore, DOE disagrees 
with NEMA’s assertion that the efficacy 
levels should be further lowered to 
account for these adjustments. 
Finally, NEMA maintained that if 
DOE uses lumens per watt as the 
efficacy level measurement, then the 
numbers should be rounded to the 
nearest whole number, rather than 
carried out to the tenths decimal place. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
considered efficacy levels that were 
specified to the nearest tenths lumen 
per watt. NEMA asserts that lamp 
testing and production variation does 
not allow for establishing minimum 
lumens per watt levels to the tenth 
place. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 12) While 
DOE appreciates NEMA’s comment, 
after consulting with NIST, DOE 
disagrees that lamp production variation 
would prohibit the regulation of GSFL 
to the nearest tenth decimal place of 
lumens per watt. If DOE were able to set 
minimum efficacy requirements to the 
nearest tenth of a decimal place, the 
higher-accuracy measurements and 
compliance could result in increased 
energy savings. However, in 
consideration of DOE’s approach to 
establish efficacy levels and conduct 
subsequent analyses based on 
certification and compliance reports 
submitted by manufacturers, DOE now 
believes that maintaining the current 
rounding procedure (i.e., to the nearest 
whole lumen per watt) is more 
appropriate. Because manufacturer 
compliance reports round numbers to 
the nearest lumen per watt, DOE 
believes that the data would not support 
establishment of an energy conservation 
standard for GSFL to the nearest tenth 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16947 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
of a lumen per watt. Therefore, in this 
NOPR, DOE is proposing to establish 
efficacy levels as whole lumen per watt 
numbers. 
DOE presents revised GSFL efficacy 
levels in section VI.A.1 of this NOPR. 
ii. Four-Foot T5 Miniature Bipin 
Efficiency Levels 
Because DOE proposes to cover 4-foot 
T5 miniature bipin lamps and 4-foot T5 
miniature bipin HO lamps, DOE 
developed efficacy levels for these two 
product classes. In its review of 
manufacturer literature, DOE identified 
the most common 4-foot T5 miniature 
bipin standard output lamps on the 
market (which based on product 
catalogs, DOE believes accounts for the 
majority of the 4-foot T5 SO market). 
The first efficacy level for this product 
class is based on these lamps, which use 
800-series phosphors and have a rated 
catalog efficacy (initial lamp lumens 
divided by ANSI rated wattage) of 104 
lm/W. In its research, DOE also noted 
higher efficacy 4-foot T5 miniature 
bipin standard output lamps that use 
improved 800-series phosphors. 
Specifically, there is a reduced-wattage 
(26W) 4-foot T5 miniature bipin lamp 
(with a rated efficacy of 112 lm/w) and 
a full-wattage (28W) lamp (with a rated 
efficacy of 110 lm/w). EL2, the second 
efficacy level for this product class, is 
based on these higher-efficacy lamps. 
Therefore, DOE analyzed two efficacy 
levels for this product class. The first 
efficacy level prevents the introduction 
of less-efficacious halophosphor lamps 
on the market, while the second efficacy 
level raises the efficacy of the current 
highest volume 4-foot T5 miniature 
bipin lamps on the market. In order to 
account for manufacturer variation, DOE 
used the average reductions in efficacy 
values due to manufacturer variation 
calculated for the highest efficacy 4-foot 
T8 medium bipin lamps, and applied 
those same reductions to the 4-foot 
miniature bipin rated efficacy values. 
For the 4-foot T5 miniature bipin HO 
product class, DOE found that higher- 
efficacy full-wattage lamps do not exist 
on the market today. DOE did identify 
a higher-efficacy reduced-wattage lamp 
for this product class. However, because 
reduced-wattage lamps have a limited 
utility, DOE is choosing to base its 
efficacy levels on full-wattage lamps. In 
this way, consumers are not forced to 
purchase a lamp with limited utility 
under energy conservation standards. 
Therefore, for this product class, DOE is 
analyzing one efficacy level, which 
prevents the introduction of less- 
efficacious halophosphor lamps on the 
market. For more information on GSFL 
efficacy levels, see chapter 5 of the TSD. 
b. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
As wattage increases for incandescent 
lamps, efficacy generally increases. 
Therefore, so that the efficacy levels 
reflected the performance of these 
lamps, DOE proposed in the ANOPR 
that the efficacy requirement for IRL 
vary according to the following 
equation: a*P0.27, where ‘‘a’’ is a 
constant specifying the technology level 
and ‘‘P’’ is the wattage of the lamp. 73 
FR 13620, 13645 (March 13, 2008). At 
the public meeting, NEMA commented 
that the smooth form of the candidate 
standard levels for IRL was appropriate. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at 
pp. 100–101, 156) Several other 
stakeholders also commented that they 
support the continuous function for IRL. 
These stakeholders noted that 
continuous functions more closely 
follow theoretical equations predicting 
the level of efficacy possible for any 
given desired level of light output and 
thus maximize energy savings. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 15) DOE agrees 
with these comments and is proposing 
to maintain the continuous function for 
IRL in the same equation form proposed 
in the ANOPR. 
As described in section V.C.4.b, DOE 
is proposing five efficacy levels in this 
NOPR. EL1 is based on an improved 
halogen lamp that uses xenon, a higher- 
efficiency inert fill gas. EL2 is based on 
a halogen infrared lamp with a lifetime 
of 6,000 hours. A halogen lamp using a 
silverized reflector coating also meets 
this EL. EL3 is based on the 3,000-hour 
HIR lamp. EL4 is based on a 4,000-hour 
improved HIR lamp. EL5 is based on a 
4,200-hour improved HIR lamp. 
6. Engineering Analysis Results 
a. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
In chapter 5 of the March 2008 
ANOPR TSD, DOE presented lifetime, 
rated wattage, and rated efficacy results 
for all lamp-and-ballast designs. NEMA 
commented that the lifetime rating for 
the reduced-wattage 30W T8 lamp 
should be 20,000 hours instead of 
18,000 hours. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 18) 
DOE reviewed catalog data and agrees 
that 20,000 hours is the appropriate 
lifetime for the 30W T8 lamp. DOE also 
reviewed catalog data for other reduced- 
wattage lamps. DOE found several 25W 
T8 lamps that were introduced on the 
market after it completed the ANOPR 
GSFL engineering analysis. Therefore, 
DOE updated the 25W T8 reduced- 
wattage lamp to have a slightly higher 
lumen output and longer lifetime to 
reflect the more common 25W T8 lamps 
sold on the market today. 
Through interviews with lamp 
manufacturers, DOE found that several 
of the rated wattages DOE used in its 
ANOPR for the 4-foot medium bipin 
product class were not accurate. For the 
NOPR, DOE updated the rated wattage 
of the nominally 40W T12 from 40 to 41 
watts. DOE also updated the rated 
wattage of the 30W T8, 28W T8, and 
25W T8 lamp from 30 to 30.4 watts, 28 
to 28.4 watts, and 25 to 26.6 watts, 
respectively. Due to these updates (and 
because the rated wattage affects the 
rated lamp efficacy), two 40W T12 
lamps and the 25W T8 lamp have lower 
efficiencies than as they were analyzed 
in the March 2008 ANOPR. For further 
detail associated with these revisions, 
see chapter 5 of the TSD. 
In addition to updating lamp efficacy, 
DOE revised the 8-foot T12 high output 
engineering analysis to reflect the 
purchase of a magnetic ballast in both 
the base case and standards case. As 
discussed in section V.C.4.a of this 
notice, DOE recognizes that a typical 8- 
foot T12 high output system uses a 
magnetic ballast. In addition, as the 
2000 ballast rule does not require that 
these systems be electronic, consumers 
will be able to purchase a magnetic 8- 
foot T12 high output system in the 
future. 
DOE also created a separate 
residential engineering analysis. In this 
engineering analysis, DOE assumes that 
the most typical installed fluorescent 
system in a residential household is a 
40W T12 magnetic system. However, 
DOE recognizes that T8 systems are 
gaining in market share in the 
residential market. Therefore, DOE 
assumes that the majority of fluorescent 
systems installed for new construction 
and renovation in the residential sector 
are T8 systems. DOE discusses this 
assumption further in section V.D and 
V.E, as it primarily affects the LCC and 
NIA. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
considered using two low ballast factor 
(BF) ballasts for 4-foot T8s, a 0.75 BF 
and a 0.78 BF. ACEEE stated that 
manufacturers are now selling ballasts 
for 4-foot T8 lamps with a ballast factor 
between 0.68–0.7 and that DOE should 
consider this ballast in the engineering 
analysis. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at p. 262) After reviewing catalog 
data for fluorescent lamp ballasts, DOE 
decided to add a ballast with a 0.71 BF 
in its engineering analysis as a system 
option that attains energy savings while 
maintaining light output. By including 
this low-BF ballast, DOE is able to more 
thoroughly characterize all consumer 
purchase options in the LCC and NIA. 
b. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE also 
presented engineering analysis results

16948 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
for IRL. NEMA generally agreed with 
the efficacy values in the table. (NEMA, 
No. 22 at p. 18) Thus, DOE is 
maintaining this approach with one 
exception. Specifically, DOE is revising 
the efficacy values it used for the 50W 
PAR30 baseline lamps and is creating 
several additional model lamps for the 
efficacy levels not analyzed in the 
March 2008 ANOPR. Because the 
revised baseline model exhibits a 
slightly different lumen package than 
the baseline model analyzed in the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE has created

to match the lumen package of the 
baseline lamp. For more information on 
the revised baseline model, see section 
V.C.3.b. For more information about 
lamp designs used in the IRL 
engineering analysis, see chapter 5 of 
the TSD. 
7. Scaling to Product Classes Not 
Analyzed 
As discussed above, DOE identified 
and selected certain product classes as 
‘‘representative’’ product classes where 
DOE would concentrate its analytical 
effort. DOE chose these representative 
product classes primarily because of 
their high market volumes. The 
following section discusses how DOE 
scaled efficacy standards from those 
product classes it analyzed to those it 
did not. 
a. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
In the engineering analysis for GSFL, 
DOE decided not to analyze the 2-foot 
U-shaped product class and the product 
classes with a CCT greater than 4,500K, 
due to the small market share of these 
classes. Instead, DOE is scaling the 
efficacy standards for the product 
classes analyzed to these product 
classes. The following sections discuss 
DOE’s approaches to scaling to product 
classes not directly analyzed. 
i. Correlated Color Temperature 
Regarding the CCT product class 
division, DOE found in the March 2008 
ANOPR that the reduction in efficacy 
between 4,100K and 6,500K lamps was 
between 4 percent and 7 percent. To 
avoid subjecting certain products to 
inappropriately high standards, DOE 
considered a single 7-percent reduction 
(from the efficacy levels for lamps with 
CCT less than or equal to 4,500K (low 
CCT)) for product classes greater than 
4,500K (high CCT). 73 FR 13620, 13653 
(March 13, 2008). 
NEMA disagreed with DOE’s use of a 
single 7-percent reduction for all GSFL 
lamps with a CCT greater than 4,500K. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 18) NEMA 
submitted a written comment 
recommending an individualized 
reduction for each efficacy level and 
each product class for products with a 
CCT between 4,500K and 7,000K. 
NEMA’s reductions ranged from 2.6 
percent to 7.2 percent, depending on the 
efficacy level and product class. 
(NEMA, No. 26 at pp. 4, 6–7) 
The Joint Comment also disagreed 
with the 7-percent reduction DOE 
employed. Looking at catalog data for 
the greater-than-4,500K product classes, 
the Joint Comment noted that the 
reduction in efficacy when moving from 
low-CCT to high-CCT lamps or from 4- 
foot MBP to 2-foot U-shaped lamps 
varies by efficacy level. For example, at 
CSL1 in the 4-foot medium bipin 
product class, the Joint Comment found 
that no reduction in the efficacy 
standard was necessary because high- 
CCT and 2-foot U-shaped T8 lamps are 
able to meet that level. At CSL3, the 
Joint Comment found a 5-percent 
reduction was appropriate; at CSL4 and 
CSL5, the Joint Comment found a 3- 
percent reduction was appropriate. 
Based on this data, the Joint Comment 
stated that the commenters would 
accept a 5-percent reduction for both the 
2-foot U-shaped and greater-than-4,500K 
product classes. (Joint Comment, No. 23 
at pp. 9–10) 
Through an examination of the 
comments and a further inspection of 
manufacturer catalog data, DOE now 
recognizes that a single efficacy 
reduction of 7 percent for each efficacy 
level and each product class is not 
always appropriate when trying to 
establish efficacy levels for lamps with 
greater than 4,500K CCT. Therefore, for 
this NOPR, DOE proposes to establish a 
separate scaling factor for each EL and 
product class. DOE’s intention in 
developing scaling factors for this NOPR 
was to establish high-CCT efficacy 
levels that mimic the same 
technological effects as the low-CCT 
efficacy levels. For example, if EL3 for 
the low-CCT 4-foot MBP product class 
eliminates all but the highest-efficacy, 
low-CCT T12 lamps, DOE established a 
high-CCT EL3 that attempted to 
eliminate all but the highest-efficacy, 
high-CCT, T12 lamps as well. Because 
the NEMA technical committee 
analyzed all efficacy levels for all 
product classes with a similar intention 
and because DOE found that this range 
is consistent with the range of 
reductions found in manufacturer 
literature, DOE proposes to adopt the 
percentage reduction for each EL 
suggested by NEMA. In order to 
establish efficacy levels for high CCT 
lamps, DOE then applied these 
percentage reductions to the efficacy 
levels (discussed in sectionV.C.5.a) for 
the representative product classes. For 
more information on the efficacy levels 
for product classes with a CCT greater 
than 4,500K, see chapter 5 of the TSD. 
ii. U-Shaped Lamps 
Regarding the 2-foot U-shaped 
product classes, in March 2008 ANOPR, 
DOE found that when comparing catalog 
efficacies of 2-foot U-shaped lamps to 4- 
foot MBP lamps, efficacy scaling factors 
varied depending on whether one was 
comparing T12 lamps or T8 lamps. 
Specifically, DOE had initially 
determined that a 3-percent reduction 
was appropriate for T8 lamps, and a 6- 
percent reduction was appropriate for 
T12 lamps. To avoid subjecting certain 
products to inappropriately high 
standards, DOE stated that it was 
considering to apply a single 6-percent 
reduction from the five 4-foot medium 
bipin efficacy levels to obtain five 2-foot 
U-shaped efficacy levels. 73 FR 13620, 
13653 (March 13, 2008). 
In response to the ANOPR, NEMA 
commented that only three ELs for the 
2-foot U-shaped product class were 
appropriate. These ELs recommended 
by NEMA were based on the same 
technology options for the 4-foot 
medium bipin product class: (1) 
NEMA’s EL1 would remove all 
halophosphor T12 lamps; (2) NEMA’s 
EL2 would remove all 700-series T12 U- 
lamps; and (3) NEMA’s EL3 would 
remove all T12 U-lamps. (NEMA, No. 22 
at p. 15) Each EL recommended by 
NEMA represented an approximately 9- 
percent to 10-percent reduction from 
ELs in the 4-foot medium bipin product 
class. As discussed above, the Joint 
Comment recommended that DOE use a 
single 5-percent reduction when scaling 
from the 4-foot medium bipin product 
class to the 2-foot U-shaped product 
class. However, the Joint Comment also 
found that the reduction varied by CSL. 
(Joint Comment, No. 23 at pp. 9–10) 
Similar to its analysis regarding 
scaling to high-CCT product classes, 
DOE recognizes that a single reduction 
in efficacy may not be appropriate for 
all efficacy levels for the U-shaped 
product classes. Therefore, similar to 
NEMA’s suggestion, DOE is proposing a 
separate reduction for each efficacy 
level based on similar technology steps 
seen for the 4-foot medium bipin 
product class. However, after examining 
commercially-available product DOE 
believes that five, not three, efficacy 
levels are appropriate for the 2-foot U- 
shaped product class. DOE assessed 
manufacturer catalogs containing 
commercially-available U-shaped lamps 
to develop standard levels with a 
similar technology impact at each EL as 
4-foot linear medium bipin lamps. DOE

supplemented this analysis with 
compliance report data for U-shaped 
lamps to verify that the established 
efficacy levels coincide with the 
technological goals and actual 
performance of products on the market. 
For specific scaling factors for the 
proposed 2-foot U-shaped efficacy levels 
and a more detailed discussion of DOE’s 
methodology, see chapter 5 of the TSD. 
b. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
i. Modified-Spectrum IRL 
At the ANOPR public meeting, DOE 
stated that the average reduction in 
efficacy of modified-spectrum lamps (as 
compared to standard spectrum lamps) 
was between 2 percent and 25 percent, 
with an average reduction of 15 percent. 
DOE acknowledged the range of 
spectrum modification and its effects on 
utility, and aimed to establish a 
standard that would not eliminate 
modified-spectrum lamps. Therefore, in 
the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
considered a minimum efficacy 
requirement for each modified-spectrum 
lamp that would be dependent on the 
testing of a equivalent standard- 
spectrum lamp. More specifically, the 
efficacy requirement for the modified- 
spectrum lamp would be determined on 
a per-lamp basis by measuring the 
lumen output of both the modified- 
spectrum lamp and the equivalent 
standard-spectrum reference lamp; 
manufacturers would then multiply the 
ratio of lumen outputs (i.e., the lumen 
output of the modified-spectrum lamp 
divided by the lumen output of the 
standard-spectrum reference lamp) by 
the efficacy requirement for the 
standard-spectrum reference lamp to 
obtain the efficacy requirement for that 
modified-spectrum lamp. 73 FR 
13620,13653 (March 13, 2008). 
GE commented that this approach 
may be reasonable as long as DOE gave 
this reduction to true modified- 
spectrum lamps, rather than lamps 
marketed as having modified spectrums, 
but which in fact do not meet the 
requirements of that term. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 168) 
NEMA commented that DOE’s proposal 
for establishing an efficacy standard for 
modified-spectrum IRL is complicated, 
difficult to enforce, and non-verifiable. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 19) In addition, 
NEMA expressed concern that the 
responsibility of establishing the 
efficacy for the equivalent standard- 
spectrum lamp would fall on the 
manufacturer. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 100–101) Also, 
the Joint Comment disagreed with an 
approach that would allow modified- 
spectrum technologies a variable 
reduction in efficacy (depending on 
their degree of spectrum modification 
and the method with which it is 
reached). (Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 
16) In response to those comments, DOE 
recognizes the drawbacks to the 
approach considered in the ANOPR and 
instead in the NOPR is proposing a 
single efficacy requirement (irrespective 
of the degree or method of spectrum 
modification) for each modified- 
spectrum IRL product class. 
GE and NEMA suggested that the 25- 
percent reduction for A-line modified- 
spectrum lamps enacted by EISA 2007 
standards for general service 
incandescent lamps (GSIL) and 
modified-spectrum GSIL may be 
appropriate for modified-spectrum IRL. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at 
pp. 169–170; NEMA, No. 22 at p. 19) 
The Joint Comment expressed an 
opposing viewpoint, arguing that the 25- 
percent reduction specified in EISA 
2007 was based on a political 
compromise, not technical research. The 
Joint Comment also mentions that Ecos 
Consulting, on behalf of PG&E, tested a 
variety of modified-spectrum general 
service incandescent lamps. Their 
researchers estimated a total light 
output reduction of 11 to 18 percent due 
to the modified spectrum. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 16) 
DOE agrees with the Joint Comment 
that the reduction in efficacy for general 
service incandescent lamps used in 
EISA 2007 may not be appropriate for 
IRL. Instead, DOE based its reduction 
for the modified-spectrum product 
classes on independent testing and 
research of commercially-available 
modified-spectrum and standard- 
spectrum IRL. 
Several stakeholders commented that 
the range of lumen reduction (2 percent 
to 29 percent) found among 
commercially-available modified- 
spectrum IRL may be attributable to 
lamps that do not meet the statutory 
definition of ‘‘modified spectrum,’’ 
which would make the stated average 
too high. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 19; Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 164– 
167) These stakeholders suggested that 
DOE should only use lamps that meet 
the definition of ‘‘modified spectrum’’ 
when determining an appropriate 
scaling factor. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at p. 167–168) GE 
suggested that lamps sold by major 
manufacturers will meet the statutory 
definition of ‘‘modified spectrum’’ 
because NEMA manufacturers offered 
input into the legislative process that 
created this definition. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at p. 171) 
In addition, the Joint Comment noted 
that when determining the modified- 
spectrum scaling factor, DOE should 
base its analysis on HIR IRL sources 
rather than conventional incandescent 
or conventional halogen IRL. The Joint 
Comment further stated that the spectral 
distribution of the HIR sources have 
reduced output in the red region of the 
spectrum compared to conventional 
incandescent lamp. The comment 
argued because this red region is the 
portion of the spectrum modified- 
spectrum lamps are often trying to 
suppress, a lower and more accurate 
scaling factor could be calculated by 
considering only HIR lamps. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 16) 
DOE agrees with stakeholders 
regarding the need to determine 
appropriate scaling factors and tested 
several modified-spectrum lamps from 
major manufacturers to determine 
whether they qualify as modified 
spectrum under the statutory definition. 
DOE only used the IRL that qualify as 
modified spectrum under the statutory 
definition to determine an appropriate 
scaling factor. In addition, DOE 
acknowledges that the spectral power 
distributions of incandescent (non- 
halogen), halogen, and HIR IRL are 
different over the electromagnetic 
spectrum. However, DOE does not 
believe that the reduced light output in 
the red region of the spectrum of HIR 
sources significantly affects the 
resulting scaling factor. This high 
wavelength red region of the spectrum 
is not weighted heavily when 
calculating the lumens emitted by the 
lamp. Therefore, any spectral 
differences in the infrared regions 
between the halogen IRL compared to 
the halogen infrared IRL would produce 
only minor differences in the reduction 
in efficacy for modified-spectrum 
lamps. Therefore, DOE tested both HIR 
and conventional halogen lamps in 
determining an appropriate scaling 
factor for modified spectrum. 
However, as non-halogen (or 
conventional incandescent) IRL have 
significantly different radiation spectra 
over wavelengths contributing to the 
calculation of lumens (in general their 
light outputs are shifted toward lower 
wavelengths), it is likely that the 
resulting scaling factor based on these 
lamps would be significantly different 
than for halogen sources. Because non- 
halogen IRL (representing the IRL lamp 
types exempted from standards) are not 
regulated in this rulemaking, DOE 
believes that it would be inappropriate 
to include such lamps in its scaling 
factor analysis. Therefore, DOE 
considered only halogen and HIR IRL 
for the computation of the modified- 
spectrum IRL scaling factor.

fire.nist.gov/fire/firedocs/build96/PDF/b96121.pdf. 
To determine the scaling factor, DOE 
tested seven pairs (each pair consisting 
of one standard-spectrum lamp and one 
lamp marketed as modified-spectrum or 
a similar designation) of halogen IRL 
and one pair of HIR IRL made by major 
manufacturers. Though many of the 
lamps did not qualify as modified- 
spectrum under the statutory definition, 
for those that did qualify, DOE 
determined that the difference in light 
output and efficacy due to the modified- 
spectrum coating was 19 percent for 
both the halogen and IR halogen lamps. 
Therefore, DOE proposes to use a 19 
percent reduction as the scaling factor 
for modified-spectrum IRL. For further 
details on scaling to modified-spectrum 
lamps, see chapter 5 and appendix 5C 
of the TSD. 
ii. Lamp Diameter 
As discussed in section V.A.2.c, in 
this NOPR, DOE has established 
separate product classes for IRL with a 
diameter of 2.5 inches or less based on 
their decreased efficacy associated with 
the unique utility that they provide (e.g., 
ability of reduced diameter lamps to be 
installed in smaller fixtures). NEMA 
commented that a percentage reduction 
should be applied to the PAR30/PAR38 
CSL so as not to eliminate PAR20 lamps 
(with diameters of 2.5 inches) at the 
highest CSLs set forth in the ANOPR. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at 
pp. 158–159) NEMA explained that the 
PAR20 lamp optical system is 
inherently less efficient than the PAR30 
and PAR38 optical systems. In addition, 
it is difficult to implement the most 
efficient double-ended HIR burner in 
the PAR20 lamps. Therefore, NEMA 
suggests a reduction in the lumen per 
watt standards by 12 percent. (NEMA, 
No. 22 at pp. 17–18) In the Joint 
Comment, stakeholders stated that they 
were not opposed to a reduction in the 
efficacy standard as long as data 
supports manufacturer claims. (Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 15–16) 
DOE understands that PAR20 lamps 
are inherently less efficient than PAR30 
and PAR38 lamps. To determine an 
appropriate scaling factor, DOE 
examined the inherent efficacy 
differences between the PAR20 lamp 
and its PAR30 or PAR38 counterpart by 
comparing catalog efficacy data of each 
lamp type from several lamp 
manufacturers. In general, DOE’s 
analysis is consistent with NEMA’s 
suggestion. Therefore, DOE proposes 
applying a 12-percent reduction from 
the efficacy requirement of the PAR30/ 
PAR38 product class to determine the 
efficacy requirement for the PAR20 
product class. For further details 
regarding the scaling to smaller lamp 
diameters, see chapter 5 of the TSD. 
iii. Voltage 
DOE also conducted an analysis to 
determine how to scale from the less 
than 125 volt product class to the 
greater or equal to 125 volt product 
class. NEMA commented that lamps 
rated at 130V are almost always used by 
customers to achieve ‘‘double life’’ by 
operating them at 120V, which results 
in performance below EPACT 1992 
efficacy levels. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 16) 
In consideration of the different test 
procedures for IRL rated at 130V than 
those rated at 120V, and by using 
equations from the IESNA Lighting 
Handbook,27 DOE derived an efficacy 
scaling factor which would result in 
equivalent performance of both classes 
of IRL when operating under the same 
voltage conditions (as NEMA suggests 
they most often are). DOE determined 
that a higher standard for lamps equal 
to or greater than 125V would result in 
similar technological requirements and 
operational efficacies for lamps rated at 
all voltages. Using published 
manufacturer literature and the IESNA 
Lighting Handbook, DOE determined 
that there should be a 15-percent 
increase in the efficacy standard for 
lamps rated at 125V or greater. See 
chapter 5 of the TSD for details of the 
results and methodology used in the 
scaling analysis and other aspects of the 
engineering analysis. 
D. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 
Analyses 
This section describes the LCC and 
payback period analyses and the 
spreadsheet model DOE used for 
analyzing the economic impacts of 
possible standards on individual 
consumers. Details of the spreadsheet 
model, and of all the inputs to the LCC 
and PBP analyses, are contained in 
chapter 8 and appendix 8A of the TSD. 
DOE conducted the LCC and PBP 
analyses using a spreadsheet model 
developed in Microsoft Excel. When 
combined with Crystal Ball (a 
commercially-available software 
program), the LCC and PBP model 
generates a Monte Carlo simulation 28 to 
perform the analysis by incorporating 
uncertainty and variability 
considerations. 
The LCC analysis estimates the 
impact of a standard on consumers by 
calculating the net cost of a lamp (or 
lamp-and-ballast system) under a base- 
case scenario (in which no new energy 
conservation standard is in effect) and 
under a standards-case scenario (in 
which the proposed energy conservation 
regulation is applied). As detailed in the 
March 2008 ANOPR, the life-cycle cost 
of a particular lamp design is composed 
of the total installed cost (which 
includes manufacturer selling price, 
sales taxes, distribution chain mark-ups, 
and any installation cost), operating 
expenses (energy, repair, and 
maintenance costs), product lifetime, 
and discount rate. 73 FR 13620, 13659 
(March 13, 2008). As noted in the March 
2008 ANOPR, DOE also incorporated a 
residual value calculation to account for 
any remaining lifetime of lamps (or 
ballasts) at the end of the analysis 
period. 73 FR 13620, 13659 (March 13, 
2008). The residual value is an estimate 
of the product’s value to the consumer 
at the end of the life-cycle cost analysis 
period. In addition, this residual value 
must recognize that a lamp system 
continues to function beyond the end of 
the analysis period. DOE calculates the 
residual value by linearly prorating the 
product’s initial cost consistent with the 
methodology described in the Life-Cycle 
Costing Manual for the Federal Energy 
Management Program.29 
The payback period is the change in 
purchase expense due to an increased 
energy conservation standard, divided 
by the change in annual operating cost 
that results from the standard. Stated 
more simply, the payback period is the 
time period it takes to recoup the 
increased purchase cost (including 
installation) of a more-efficient product 
through energy savings. DOE expresses 
this period in years. 
The Joint Comment stated that given 
the inherent uncertainty in the LCC 
methodology, DOE should recognize 
that LCC results within a certain range 
can be considered essentially 
equivalent. The Joint Comment 
emphasized that recognizing this 
uncertainty is especially important if 
other aspects of the analysis (e.g., energy 
savings) show large differences for 
standard levels with LCC results that, 
given uncertainty in the analysis, are 
essentially the same. (Joint Comment, 
No. 23 at p. 22) DOE agrees that there 
are inherent sources of uncertainty in

16951 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
the results of the LCC analysis due to 
the need to forecast certain inputs (e.g., 
future electricity prices). In addition, 
DOE recognizes that inputs such as sales 
tax, operating hours, and discount rates 
may introduce variability in LCC 
results. However, as explained below, 
DOE’s analyses are structured so as to 
address such uncertainties. As stated 
earlier, to properly characterize the LCC 
results, DOE performed probability 
analyses via Monte Carlo simulations by 
utilizing Microsoft Excel in combination 
with Crystal Ball. The Monte Carlo 
approach allowed DOE to determine 
average LCC savings and payback 
periods, as well as the proportion of 
lamp installations achieving LCC 
savings or attaining certain payback 
values. To fully consider the range of 
LCC results that may occur due to a 
standard, DOE also performed several 
sensitivity analyses on inputs such as 
operating hours, electricity price 
forecasts, and product prices. Based on 
these analyses, DOE believes that it can 
characterize the LCC and PBP for these 
products with a reasonable degree of 
certainty. See the TSD appendix 8B for 
further details, where probable ranges of 
LCC results are presented. 
Table V.2 summarizes the approach 
and data that DOE used to derive the 
inputs to the LCC and PBP calculations 
for the March 2008 ANOPR and the 
changes made for today’s proposed rule. 
The following sections discuss these 
inputs and comments DOE received 
regarding its presentation of the LCC 
and PBP analyses in the March 2008 
ANOPR, as well as DOE’s responses 
thereto.

TABLE V.2—SUMMARY OF INPUTS AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ANOPR AND NOPR LCC ANALYSES— 
Continued 
Inputs March 2008 ANOPR Changes for the Proposed Rule 
Discount Rate ...................... Residential: Approach based on the finance cost of 
raising funds to purchase lamps either through the fi-
nancial cost of any debt incurred to purchase product 
or the opportunity cost of any equity used to pur-
chase equipment, based on the Federal Reserve’s 
Survey of Consumer Finances data 12 for 1989, 
1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004.
Commercial and industrial: Derived discount rates using 
the cost of capital of publicly-traded firms in the sec-
tors that purchase lamps, based on data in the 2003 
CBECS,13 Damodaran Online,14 Ibbotson’s Associ-
ates,15 the 2007 Value Line Investment survey,16 Of-
fice of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. 
A–94,17 2008 State and local bond interest rates,18 
and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.19 
DOE updated the commercial and industrial discount 
rates using the latest versions of the sources used in 
the March 2008 ANOPR. 
Analysis Period .................... Based on the longest baseline lamp life in a product 
class divided by the annual operating hours of that 
lamp.
Commercial and industrial GSFL: No Change. 
Residential GSFL: Analysis period is based on the use-
ful lifetime of the baseline lamp. 
IRL: No Change. 
Lamp Purchasing Events ..... DOE assessed five events: Lamp failure, standards-in-
duced retrofit, ballast failure (GSFL only), ballast ret-
rofit (GSFL only), and new construction/renovation.
GSFL: DOE assumed that HO lamps used magnetic 
ballasts in the base case. DOE added lamp failure, 
ballast failure/fixture failure, and new construction 
events for 4-foot medium bipin systems in the resi-
dential sector, where DOE also assumed the usage 
of magnetic ballasts in the base case. 
IRL: No change.

1. Consumer Product Price 
As in the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
used a variety of sources to develop 
consumer equipment prices, including 
lamp and ballast prices in 
manufacturers’ suggested retail price 
lists (‘‘blue books’’), State procurement 
contracts, large electrical supply 
distributors, hardware and home 
improvement stores, Internet retailers, 
and other similar sources. DOE then 
developed low, medium, and high 
prices based on its findings. 
For the NOPR, DOE added several 
new lamps and ballasts to its analyses. 
Accordingly, DOE developed prices for 
4-foot medium bipin GSFL systems in

the residential sector, the 8-foot HO 
magnetic ballast, and commercially- 
available 4-foot T5 miniature bipin 
standard output and high-output lamps 
and ballasts using the same 
methodology applied in the March 2008 
ANOPR. However, not all lamps 
assessed for this rulemaking are 
commercially available. In particular, 
DOE developed model halophosphor T5 
standard-output and high-output lamps 
as baselines for these product classes. 
To establish prices for these baseline 
lamps, DOE calculated the price 
differential between a halophosphor 4- 
foot MBP lamp and the highest-efficacy 
32W 4-foot MBP lamp. DOE then used 
this relationship to scale prices from the 
commercially-available T5 standard- 
output and high-output lamps to 
establish the halophosphor lamp prices. 
DOE also developed a model IRL for 
EL1 based on the incorporation of xenon 
gas into the lamps. To determine the 
price of these lamps, DOE interviewed 
manufacturers and conducted its own 
research on the cost of xenon 30 to 
develop a manufacturer cost increase 
over the baseline lamp in a product 
class, and then applied a markup to 
represent consumer prices. See the 
engineering analysis in section V.C.4.b 
for further information on the model IRL 
lamp. 
DOE also developed a price for the 
6,000-hour HIR IRL for the NOPR. After 
reviewing data in manufacturer catalogs 
and interviewing manufacturers, DOE 
determined that the manufacturing costs 
for the 6,000-hour HIR lamp are the 
same as the manufacturing costs for the 
3,000-hour HIR lamps that meet EL3. 
Therefore, for the NOPR, the 
commoditized retail prices for the long- 
life HIR lamps are the same as for the 
IRL that meet EL3. 
Lastly, because DOE did not have 
manufacturer suggested retail price list 
data for the EL5 (HIR Plus) IRL, DOE 
used prices offered by Internet retailers 
to establish prices for these lamps. 
Specifically, DOE calculated individual 
retailers’ discounts on blue book prices 
for EL4 (Improved HIR) lamps. DOE 
applied these same discounts to 
establish average blue book prices for 
EL5 lamps across all Internet retailers 
found to sell both EL4 and EL5 lamps. 
Using these approximate blue-book 
prices, DOE then followed the same 
methodology applied in the March 2008 
ANOPR to establish low, medium and 
high lamp prices. 
2. Sales Tax 
As in the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
obtained State and local sales tax data 
from the Sales Tax Clearinghouse. 
(March 2008 ANOPR TSD chapter 7) 
The data represented weighted averages 
that include county and city rates. DOE 
used the data to compute population- 
weighted average tax values for each 
Census division and four large States 
(New York, California, Texas, and 
Florida). For the NOPR, DOE retained 
this methodology and used updated 
sales tax data from the Sales Tax 
Clearinghouse 31 and updated 
population estimates from the U.S. 
Census Bureau.32 
3. Installation Costs 
As detailed in the ANOPR, DOE 
considered the total installed cost of a 
lamp or lamp-and-ballast system to be 
the consumer product price (including 
sales taxes) plus the installation cost. 73 
FR 13620, 13660 (March 13, 2008). For 
the commercial and industrial sectors, 
DOE assumed an installation cost that 
was the product of the average labor rate 
and the time needed to install a lamp or 
lamp and ballast. In the residential 
sector, DOE assumed that consumers 
must pay for the installation of a lamp 
and ballast system. Therefore, the 
installation cost assumed was the 
product of the average labor rate and the 
time needed to install the lamp and 
ballast system. However, DOE assumed 
that consumers would install their own 
replacement lamps and, thus, would 
incur no installation cost when 
replacing their own lamp. 
DOE received multiple comments on 
the average labor rates DOE used in the 
March 2008 ANOPR: $65.35 per hour 
for an electrician and $42.40 per hour 
for an electrician’s helper. (March 2008 
ANOPR TSD chapter 8). DOE assumed 
that the lamp-and-ballast hourly labor 
rate is 50 percent of an electrician’s rate 
and 50 percent of the helper’s rate, for 
a total labor rate of $53.88 based on ‘‘RS 
Means Electrical Cost Data, 2007’’ (RS 
Means).33 NEMA commented that 
$53.88 per hour is approximately 10 
percent lower than the current labor rate 
including benefits, while the Joint 
Comment stated that $54 per hour for 
ballast change-outs is reasonable only 
for residential and small commercial 
customers, and is too high for large 
commercial customers, who will have a 
full-time electrician or non-electrician 
maintenance person on staff for 
installations. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 22; 
Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 10) ACEEE 
also commented that large companies 
may have electricians on staff and 
encouraged DOE to research labor rates 
for these workers. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 216–217) 
DOE understands that there may be a 
range of labor rates in the market for 
installations and also clarifies that the 
March 2008 ANOPR labor rate of $53.88 
per hour is for the installation of lamps 
and ballasts, not only ballasts, as stated 
in the Joint Comment. ACEEE and the 
Joint Comment requested that DOE 
lower the labor rate, while NEMA 
commented that DOE should raise the 
labor rate; none of the comments 
provided DOE with supporting 
references. DOE uses ‘‘RS Means 
Electrical Cost Data, 2007,’’ because 
labor costs in RS Means are based on 
labor union agreements and 
construction wages, as well as actual 
working conditions in 30 major U.S. 
cities. Productivity data in RS Means 
represents an extended period of 
observations. For this reason, DOE 
chose to retain for the NOPR the RS 
Means methodology used for the March 
2008 ANOPR. Based on inflation 
estimates derived from consumer price 
index data from the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, DOE estimated that this 
rate in 2007 dollars is $55.41 per hour. 
DOE also updated the lamp replacement 
labor rate to be $15.94 per hour in 2007 
dollars. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE used 
several installation times for lamps and 
ballasts in the commercial and 
industrial sector analyses, such as the 
lower bound installation time of 30 
minutes for 2-lamp 4-foot medium bipin 
fixtures, and the upper bound 
installation time of 60 minutes for 2- 
lamp 8-foot recessed double contact 
high-output fixtures. (March 2008 
ANOPR TSD chapter 8) These times 
were obtained from the 2000 Ballast 
Rule TSD.34 
DOE received several comments 
addressing these installation times. GE 
commented that the 2005 National 
Electric Code requirements for 
disconnecting luminaires before they 
are serviced for lamp or ballast

replacements and installing luminaire 
disconnects for new construction or 
major retrofits will necessitate 
additional labor time. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 218–219; 
NEMA, No. 22 at p. 22) NEMA 
recommended that DOE use an 
installation time of approximately 2 to 
3 minutes for luminaire disconnects. 
Industrial Ecology commented on 
average installation times during the 
recent relamping of a school in Atlantic 
City, NJ, in which an electrician 
changed ballasts and lamps for 4-lamp 
and 2-lamp fixtures at the rate of 
approximately 3 fixtures per hour. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 
220) 
DOE agrees that extra time will be 
needed when a luminaire disconnect 
must be installed. Because DOE has not 
received detailed data on other 
installation times apart from the ones 
used in the 2000 Ballast Rule, DOE 
revised the ANOPR installation times 
specifically to address the time added 
by the installation of luminaire 
disconnects. For the NOPR analysis, 
DOE added 2.5 minutes to the ANOPR 
installation times for new construction, 
major retrofits, and renovation, events 
in which DOE assumed that a luminaire 
disconnect must be installed. 
Additional details on installation costs 
are available in chapter 8 of the NOPR 
TSD. 
4. Disposal Costs 
DOE did not consider disposal costs 
in the March 2008 ANOPR. Industrial 
Ecology commented that recycling costs 
should be considered in the LCC 
analysis for GSFL and that such costs 
range from 5 cents to 10 cents per foot. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 
212) In response, DOE researched 
recycling costs for GSFL and found an 
average cost of 10 cents per linear foot.35 
DOE also explored the prevalence of 
recycling in the commercial, industrial, 
and residential sectors. A report 
released by the Association of Lighting 
and Mercury Recyclers in 2004 noted 
that approximately 30 percent of lamps 
used by businesses and 2 percent of 
lamps in the residential sector are 
recycled nationwide.36 DOE considers 
the 30 percent commercial and 
industrial recycling rate to be significant 
and, thus, incorporates recycling costs 
into its main analysis. DOE applied a 
cost of 10 cents per linear foot in the 
commercial and industrial sectors every 
time a lamp is replaced during the LCC 
analysis period. Due to discounting, the 
inclusion of recycling costs affects the 
LCC savings of lamps with different 
lifetimes than the baseline lamps that 
they are compared to. The recycling cost 
also affects the residual value of lamps 
that operate beyond the end of the 
analysis period. In the Monte Carlo 
analysis, DOE assumes that commercial 
and industrial consumers pay recycling 
costs in approximately 30 percent of 
lamp failures. DOE does not expect the 
2 percent residential recycling rate to 
affect the residential sector LCC 
substantially, however, and thus did not 
apply the recycling costs to this sector. 
5. Annual Operating Hours 
DOE developed annual operating 
hours for IRL and GSFL in the March 
2008 ANOPR by combining building 
type-specific operating hours data in the 
2002 U.S. Lighting Market 
Characterization (LMC) 37 with data in 
the 2003 Commercial Building Energy 
Consumption Survey (CBECS),38 the 
2001 Residential Energy Consumption 
Survey (RECS),39 and the 2002 
Manufacturing Energy Consumption 
Survey (MECS),40 which describe the 
probability that a particular building 
type exists in a particular region. (March 
2008 ANOPR TSD chapter 6) DOE 
received comments on three areas 
related to the operating hours used for 
the LCC analysis: (1) Sectors analyzed; 
(2) regional variations; and (3) building 
types. These comments are discussed 
below. For further details regarding the 
annual operating hours used in the 
analyses, see chapter 6 of the TSD. 
a. Sectors Analyzed 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
analyzed GSFL in the commercial and 
industrial sectors; DOE did not analyze 
the usage of GSFL in the residential 
sector because it believed it was a 
relatively small portion of GSFL sales. 
The Joint Comment requested that DOE 
perform an LCC analysis of GSFL in the 
residential sector, because lamps in the 
residential sector are replaced 
infrequently due to lower operating 
hours compared to the commercial and 
industrial sectors. (Joint Comment, No. 
23 at p. 10) Similarly, NEMA 
commented that DOE should assess 
GSFL in the residential sector, because 
certain ELs may eliminate T12 lamp 
types, requiring many residential 
consumers to install new lamp fixtures. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 32) 
In response, DOE assessed the 
installed stock of lamps using the LMC, 
which stated that approximately 25 
percent of linear fluorescent lamps exist 
in the residential sector. DOE considers 
this proportion to be significant and, 
thus, supports the recommendation to 
perform a residential LCC analysis of 
GSFL. DOE developed residential 
operating hours for GSFL by using data 
in the 2002 LMC and the 2001 RECS. 
However, DOE only performed an LCC 
analysis of 4-foot medium bipin lamps 
in the residential sector, because 
marketing literature indicates that 8-foot 
single pin slimline lamps and 8-foot 
recessed double contact HO lamps are 
not prevalent in residential settings. 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
analyzed IRL in the commercial, 
residential, and industrial sectors. 
(March 2008 ANOPR TSD chapter 6) 
NEMA commented that IRL should be 
removed from the industrial sector LCC 
analysis because they are rarely used in 
industrial settings. The Joint Comment 
emphasized the importance of analyzing 
IRL in the residential sector due to 
lower operating hours and higher 
electricity prices for residences 
compared to prices in the commercial 
sector. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 20; Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 17) 
The LMC indicates that less than 1 
percent of IRL were found in the 
industrial sector. Based on this data, 
DOE agrees with both comments and 
has removed IRL from the industrial 
sector in terms of its analyses. 
Consistent with the March 2008 ANORP 
LCC analysis, DOE also continued to 
perform a residential sector LCC 
analysis of IRL for the NOPR.

index.html. 
Energy commented that the LMC, which 
DOE used during the LCC analysis, may 
underestimate energy usage in the 
residential sector because operating 
hours may vary regionally (e.g., by 
latitude), even for the same building 
types. (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
21 at pp. 197–198) In contrast, the 
Northwest Power and Conservation 
Council responded that there was a 
variation of a tenth of an hour per day 
in operating hours between a study 
completed in Tacoma, Washington, and 
a study of California. Therefore, the 
Council suggested that differences in 
latitude and weather do not 
significantly affect operating hours. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 
199) 
DOE found no conclusive evidence 
that would suggest that geographic 
location has a significant impact on 
operating hours for a given building 
type. However, DOE found evidence of 
regional differences in the proportions 
of different building types (e.g., number 
of mobile homes versus number of 
multi-family dwellings) as the probable 
source of regional variation in operating 
hours.41 As detailed in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE captured this regional 
variation by using the RECS, CBECS, 
and MECS to determine the probability 
that a particular building type exists in 
a particular region. 73 FR 13620, 13654 
(March 13, 2008). For this reason, DOE 
has not revised its analysis for the 
NOPR to specifically address latitude, 
weather, or other regional factors apart 
from building type proportions. 
c. Building Type 
NEMA requested a confirmation that 
DOE has included retail facilities in its 
consideration of operating hours, 
because retail facilities have more 
operating hours compared to other 
commercial facilities. (NEMA, No. 22 at 
p. 20) DOE is aware that different 
commercial building types have 
different average operating hours and, 
thus, considered a variety of commercial 
building types, including retail 
facilities, in its analysis. Operating 
hours were determined using the LMC 
study. DOE assessed the operating hours 
for retail facilities for the March 2008 
ANOPR (ANOPR chapter 6 of the TSD) 
and retained the assessment of 
commercial retail facility operating 
hours for the NOPR analysis. 
6. Product Energy Consumption Rate 
As in the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
determined lamp input power (or lamp- 
and-ballast system input power for 
GSFL) based on published manufacturer 
literature. (March 2008 ANOPR TSD 
chapter 5) For GSFL, DOE assessed a 
variety of lamp-and-ballast 
combinations by establishing a 
correlation between ballast factor and 
system input power. This allowed DOE 
to derive GSFL system power (in watts) 
for all of the lamp and ballast 
combinations used in the analysis. The 
rated system power was then multiplied 
by the annual operating hours of the 
system to determine the annual energy 
consumption. DOE retained this 
methodology for this notice. 
For this NOPR, DOE updated system 
input power ratings for certain lamp- 
and-ballast combinations, and 
developed new system-input powers for 
other lamp-and-ballast combinations not 
considered in the March 2008 ANOPR. 
Specifically, DOE obtained additional 
system power ratings for 4-foot T8 
ballasts from recently released 
manufacturer literature and updated 
these system input power ratings for the 
NOPR. DOE also developed new system 
input power ratings for magnetic 
residential 4-foot T12 systems, magnetic 
8-foot HO systems, 4-foot T5 miniature 
bipin systems, and 4-foot T5 miniature 
bipin HO systems. 
7. Electricity Prices 
DOE determined energy prices by 
deriving regional average prices for 13 
geographic areas consisting of the nine 
U.S. Census divisions, with four large 
states (New York, Florida, Texas, and 
California) treated separately. The 
derivation of prices was based on data 
in EIA’s Form EIA–861. DOE received 
three comments on the regional 
electricity prices that it used for the 
ANOPR LCC. PG&E commented that the 
California residential electricity price of 
9.9 cents per kWh (ANOPR TSD chapter 
8) was lower than what appears to be an 
average of 14 cents per kWh in the State. 
ACEEE and the Joint Comment 
recommended that DOE use EIA’s 
publication ‘‘Electric Power Monthly’’— 
as a source of recent electricity prices 
instead of Form EIA–861. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 223– 
224; Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 18) 
In response, DOE notes that it uses 
Form EIA–861 for two reasons. First, it 
allows for the creation of regional 
average electricity prices weighted by 
the number of customers each electric 
utility serves. DOE prefers to use 
customer-weighted average electricity 
prices so that prices are not skewed by 
utilities serving small numbers of very 
large electricity consumers. Electricity 
sales are not well correlated with the 
number of consumers in the commercial 
sector, and the usage of customer- 
weighted averages more heavily weights 
the utilities that serve larger numbers of 
consumers. Second, ‘‘Electric Power 
Monthly’’ does not report customer- 
weighted prices. DOE appreciates the 
comments related to electricity prices, 
and for the NOPR analysis, DOE 
updated its electricity prices by using 
the latest version of Form EIA–861 
(2006).42 DOE notes that the latest 
Form’s updated residential electricity 
price for California is 14.7 cents per 
kWh which is consistent with PG&E’s 
assessment that the average residential 
electricity price in California is around 
14 cents per kWh. 
8. Electricity Price Trends 
To project electricity prices to the end 
of the LCC analysis period in the March 
2008 ANOPR, DOE used the reference, 
low-economic-growth, and high- 
economic-growth projections in EIA’s 
AEO2007.43 73 FR 13620, 13660 (March 
13, 2008). DOE received several 
comments on the resulting electricity 
price trends that it used in the LCC 
calculation. PG&E commented that 
DOE’s forecasted electricity prices do 
not increase in real terms in the next 20 
years, which the commenter argued is 
unrealistic. ACEEE and the Joint 
Comment both stated that DOE should 
use the most recent AEO forecasts along 
with a collection of other electricity 
price forecasts. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 224–225; Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 18) 
DOE supports the suggestion that it 
should use the most recent electricity 
price forecasts. DOE uses EIA’s AEO 
because it is publicly available and has 
been widely reviewed. The latest AEO 
contains a table of comparisons to three 
other electricity forecasts; the only 
forecast that included prices (from 
Global Insight, Inc.) showed electricity 
prices very similar to the prices in the 
AEO2008 reference case. Also, a 
conversion of the AEO2008 forecast into 
real dollars reveals that AEO’s 
forecasted electricity prices do increase 
in real terms. For these reasons, DOE 
chose to continue using the AEO and

9. Lifetime 
a. Ballast Lifetime 
In chapter 8 of the March 2008 
ANOPR TSD, DOE stated that it used 
49,054 hours as the estimated ballast 
lifetime based on findings in the 2000 
Ballast Rule. The Joint Comment 
suggested three reasons why ballast 
lifetimes are actually longer than the 
lifetime used in the 2000 Ballast Rule. 
The Joint Comment stated that, on 
average, ballasts operate below their life 
rating temperature. In addition, 
manufacturer estimates exceed the DOE 
lifetime even at rated conditions. The 
commenter also argued that market data 
of historical shipments of ballasts sold 
to new construction versus retrofit and 
replacement suggest that the average 
ballast life is longer than suggested. The 
Joint Comment contends that, in 
addition to considering the above points 
generally, DOE should specifically 
study these shipments to establish 
ballast lifetime. (Joint Comment, No. 23 
at pp. 7–9) 
Based on the Joint Comment’s 
suggestions, DOE investigated several 
different ways of measuring a ballast’s 
useful lifetime in commercial and 
residential buildings. DOE does not 
believe that using the rated temperature 
of ballasts is an appropriate way to 
measure a ballast’s lifetime. For 
example, a building renovation or a 
lighting retrofit may cause buildings or 
homeowners to replace a ballast before 
it fails. DOE also believes that 
examining historical sales data of 
ballasts sold to new construction versus 
replacement and retrofit to estimate 
ballast lifetime would involve too many 
assumptions to provide a useful 
measure of lifetime. For example, DOE 
would need to estimate an appropriate 
distribution of ballast lifetimes in the 
field because ballasts are replaced at 
various points in their useful life due to 
different operating hours, failure rates, 
and time periods between initial 
building construction and the first 
lighting retrofit. 
In its investigation of ballast lifetime, 
DOE encountered several studies that 
establish the ‘‘measure life’’ (i.e., the 
true service life of a ballast in the field) 
of ballasts in both the commercial and 
residential sectors. One study 
comparing the results of several 
‘‘measure life’’ reports found that the 
average ballast lifetime after a retrofit in 
the commercial sector is 13 years, and 
the average ballast lifetime after new 
construction is 15 years.45 Using DOE’s 
estimate of 49,054 hours and average 
operating hours for GSFL in the 
commercial sector, the lifetime of an 
average ballast is approximately 14.2 
years. Because this lifetime is consistent 
with several measure life reports, DOE 
maintains the same ballast lifetime of 
49,054 hours in its NOPR analysis. DOE 
also found in a separate measure life 
report that the average fixture and 
ballast in the residential sector lasts for 
15 years. Therefore, in its residential 
sector analysis for GSFL, DOE 
established 15 years as the average 
ballast lifetime in the residential 
sector,46 and an average annual 
operating lifetime of 789 hours. The 
ballast’s average hours of operation over 
its service lifetime is therefore 11,835 
hours in the residential sector. 
b. Lamp Lifetime 
When possible, DOE used 
manufacturer literature to measure lamp 
lifetimes, as in the March 2008 ANOPR. 
73 FR 13620, 13662 (March 13, 2008). 
When published manufacturer literature 
was not available (as for some IRL), DOE 
derived lamp lifetimes as part of the 
engineering analysis (section V.C.4.b). 
DOE based its calculations of GSFL 
lifetime for the base and standards cases 
on lamp operating times of 3 hours per 
start in the March 2008 ANOPR LCC 
analysis. 73 FR 13620, 13662 (March 13, 
2008). In comments, NEMA supported 
the 3 hours per start operating time for 
both the base and standards cases, but 
also argued that while lamps are started 
every 12 hours in commercial and 
industrial applications, the increasing 
use of occupancy sensors is leading to 
shorter start cycles. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 
23) DOE did not receive any other 
comments about using a GSFL operating 
time of 3 hours per start. Therefore, DOE 
retained the assumption of 3 hours per 
start in the NOPR LCC analysis for both 
the base and standards cases. In 
addition, DOE researched the impact of 
occupancy sensors on start cycle 
lengths. However, DOE was unable to 
obtain significant information with 
which it could quantify this effect. 
As in the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
also considered in the NOPR analysis 
the impact of group re-lamping practices 
on GSFL lifetime in the commercial and 
industrial sectors. 73 FR 13620, 13662 
(March 13, 2008). DOE assumed that a 
lamp subject to group re-lamping 
operates for 75 percent of its rated 
lifetime, an estimate obtained from the 
2000 Ballast Rule.47 By considering 
lamp rated lifetimes and the prevalence 
of group versus spot re-lamping 
practices, DOE derived an average 
lifetime for a GSFL. This ranged from 91 
percent of rated lifetime for 8-foot single 
pin slimline lamps to 94 percent of 
rated lifetime for 4-foot medium bipin 
lamps. See chapter 8 of the TSD for 
further details. 
As stated above, DOE is using 15 
years as the estimated fixture and ballast 
lifetime in the residential sector for 
purposes of its analyses. If one 
calculates the lifetime of the baseline 
GSFL lamp in the residential sector by 
dividing the life in hours by the average 
operating hours of a GSFL in the 
residential sector (789 hours), one finds 
that the baseline lamp should live for 19 
years. Because the lifetime of the 
baseline lamp is longer than the average 
lifetime of a fixture and ballast, DOE 
assumes that the ballast or fixture 
lifetime limits the lifetime of an average 
lamp in the residential sector. DOE is 
aware that there are certain rooms in 
residential buildings where GSFL are 
operated for much longer than 789 
hours per year; in particular, GSFL are 
operated for approximately 1,210 hours 
per year in kitchens of single-family 
detached households. Therefore, DOE 
has conducted the residential sector 
analysis under average operating hours 
and high operating hours. Under 
average operating hours (789 hours per 
year), DOE assumes that lamp lifetime 
of the baseline-case and standards-case 
lamps is limited to 11,835 hours or 15 
years, due to a ballast or fixture failure. 
Thus, in this situation, the lamp failure 
event does not occur; only the ballast 
failure event occurs. See section V.D.14 
for a description of lamp purchase 
events. 
DOE recognizes that although some 
consumers do not experience a lamp 
failure in the residential sector, 
consumers whose operating hours yield 
a lamp lifetime that is shorter than that 
of the fixture or ballast do need to 
replace their lamp occasionally. DOE 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16957 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
48 http://www.federalreserve.gov/PUBS/oss/oss2/ 
2007/scf2007home_modify.html. 
assumes the shortest lifetime of the 
baseline lamp, using the highest 
operating hours for GSFL in the LMC of 
1,210 hours per year (as in kitchens), is 
approximately 12.5 years. When a 
baseline lamp is replaced at 12.5 years, 
the fixture and ballast have another 2.5 
years of life remaining. DOE assumes 
that when fixtures or ballasts are 
discarded, their associated lamps are 
also discarded at the same time. 
Therefore, for GSFL in the residential 
sector, the longest useful life of the 
baseline replacement lamp would be 2.5 
years or 1,972 hours. At the end of this 
lifetime, the ballast and fixture are 
replaced. Therefore, for the lamp 
replacement event for a GSFL in the 
residential sector in a high operating 
hours scenario (1,210 hours per year), 
the lifetime of the baseline lamp is 
assumed to be 1,972 hours or 2.5 years, 
and DOE assumes that the ballast failure 
event does not occur. DOE requests 
comment on the typical service life of a 
GSFL in the residential sector. 
10. Discount Rates 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
derived residential discount rates by 
identifying all possible debt or asset 
classes that might be used to purchase 
replacement products, including 
household assets that might be affected 
indirectly. 73 FR 13620, 13663 (March 
13, 2008). DOE estimated the average 
shares of the various debt and equity 
classes in the average U.S. household 
equity and debt portfolios using data 
from the SCFs from 1989 to 2004. DOE 
used the mean share of each class across 
the six sample years as a basis for 
estimating the effective financing rate 
for replacement equipment. DOE 
estimated interest or return rates 
associated with each type of equity and 
debt using SCF data and other sources. 
The mean real effective rate across the 
classes of household debt and equity, 
weighted by the shares of each class, is 
5.6 percent. 
For the commercial sector and 
industrial sector, DOE derived the 
discount rate from the cost of capital of 
publicly-traded firms in the sectors that 
purchase lamps. To obtain an average 
discount rate value for the commercial 
sector, DOE used data from CBECS 
2003, which provides market-share data 
by type of owner. Weighting each 
ownership type by its market share, 
DOE estimated the average discount rate 
for the commercial sector to be 6.2 
percent. Similarly, the industrial sector 
discount rate was derived to be 7.5 
percent. 73 FR 13620, 13663 (March 13, 
2008). 
The Joint Comment stated that, in the 
past, NRDC has argued that a 2 to 3 
percent real discount rate should be 
used in the LCC. (Joint Comment, No. 23 
at p. 22) It also stated that ACEEE and 
others have supported the weighted 
average cost of capital approach. In 
general, the Joint Comment stated that if 
DOE continues with using the weighted 
cost of capital approach, the agency 
should make sure its calculations are 
updated, as current economic 
conditions will influence agency 
estimates for discount rates over the 
analysis period. (Joint Comment, No. 23 
at p. 22) In consideration of the above 
comments (and absent any evidence to 
the contrary), DOE agrees with ACEEE 
and others in the Joint Comment that 
the weighted average cost of capital 
approach described above is the most 
accurate way of establishing an 
appropriate consumer discount rate for 
the LCC analysis. For this NOPR, DOE 
was not able to use the most up-to-date 
information to update the residential 
discount rate, because the 2007 SCF 
survey was not available at the time of 
publication. However, because the rates 
for various forms of credit carried by 
households in these years were 
established over a range of time, DOE 
believes they are representative of rates 
that may be in effect in 2012. DOE is not 
aware of any other nationally 
representative data source that provides 
interest rates from a statistically valid 
sample. Therefore, DOE continued to 
use the above approach and results for 
today’s proposed rule. According to the 
Federal Reserve Board Web site, the 
2007 SCF survey may be available in the 
first quarter of 2009.48 Contingent on 
this data’s release in a timely manner, 
DOE will attempt to incorporate the 
2007 SCF survey in the final rule of this 
rulemaking. 
Despite the limitations associated 
with its residential analysis, DOE was 
able to update certain sources used to 
compute the commercial and industrial 
sector discount rates. Specifically, DOE 
applied the 2008 Damodaran Online 
Data, the 2008 implicit price deflators 
from the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
the 2007 Value Line Investment Survey 
data, information from the 2008 OMB 
Circular No. A–94, and 2008 State and 
local bond interest rates. However, DOE 
continued to use data from CBECS 2003, 
which provides market-share data by 
type of owner to obtain an average 
discount rate value for the commercial 
sector. DOE is not aware of any other 
nationally representative data source 
that provides market-share data by type 
of owner and, therefore, is continuing to 
use this source of data in today’s 
proposed rule. DOE computed the new 
discount rates to be 7.0 percent in the 
commercial sector and 7.6 percent in 
the industrial sector. For further details 
on discount rates, see chapter 8 and 
appendix 8C of the TSD. 
11. Analysis Period 
The analysis period is the span of 
time over which the LCC is calculated. 
For the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE used 
the longest baseline lamp life in a 
product class divided by the annual 
operating hours of that lamp as the 
analysis period. 73 FR 13620, 13663 
(March 13, 2008). During Monte Carlo 
simulations for the LCC analysis, DOE 
selected the analysis period based on 
the longest baseline lamp life divided by 
the annual operating hours chosen by 
Crystal Ball. For the NOPR analysis, 
DOE retained this methodology for IRL 
and GSFL in the commercial and 
industrial sectors. However, for GSFL in 
the residential sector, the analysis 
period is based on the useful life of the 
baseline lamp for a specific event. 
Specifically, for the lamp replacement 
event, the analysis period is 2.5 years, 
and for the lamp and ballast 
replacement and new construction 
event, the analysis period is 15 years. 
DOE requests comment on the analysis 
period used for the residential sector 
analysis. See section V.D.9.a of this 
notice for more information on the 
useful life of the baseline lamp in all 
residential sector purchase events. 
12. Effective Date 
For purposes of DOE’s analyses, the 
effective date is the date when a new 
standard becomes operative. DOE 
intends to publish the final rule for this 
rulemaking in June 2009. 73 FR 13620, 
13663 (March 13, 2008). In accordance 
with sections 325(i)(3) and (i)(5) of 
EPCA, the effective date of any new or 
amended energy conservation standard 
for these lamps shall be 3 years after the 
final rule is published, which would be 
June 2012 for this rulemaking. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(i)(3) and (i)(5)) DOE 
performed its LCC analysis based upon 
an assumption that each consumer 
would purchase a new product in the 
year that the standard takes effect. 
13. Payback Period Inputs 
The payback period (PBP) is the 
amount of time a consumer needs to 
recover the assumed additional costs of 
a more-efficient product through lower 
operating costs. As in the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE used a ‘‘simple’’ PBP for 
the NOPR, because the PBP does not 
take into account other changes in 
operating expenses over time or the time 
value of money. 73 FR 13620, 13663 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16958 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
(March 13, 2008). As inputs to the PBP 
analysis, DOE used the total installed 
cost of the product to the consumer for 
each efficacy level, as well as the first 
year annual operating costs for each 
efficacy level. The calculation requires 
the same inputs as the LCC, except for 
energy price trends and discount rates; 
only energy prices for the year the 
standard takes effect (2012 in this case) 
are needed. 73 FR 13620, 13663 (March 
13, 2008). 
14. Lamp Purchase Events 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
described five types of events that 
would prompt a consumer to purchase 
a lamp. 73 FR 13620, 13664 (March 13, 
2008). These events are described below 
along with changes for the NOPR 
analysis. Of particular note, DOE 
conducted a number of new analyses for 
the NOPR which assessed lamp failure, 
ballast failure, and new construction 
events for residential sector GSFL. In 
addition, though described primarily in 
the context of GSFL, lamp purchase 
events can be applied to IRL as well. 
However, considering that IRL are 
generally not used with a ballast the 
only lamp purchase events applicable 
are lamp failure (event I) and new 
construction and renovation (event V). 
• Lamp Failure (Event I): This event 
reflects a scenario in which a lamp has 
failed (spot relamping) or is about to fail 
(group re-lamping). In the base case, 
identical lamps are installed as 
replacements. In the standards case, the 
consumer installs a standards-compliant 
lamp that is compatible with the 
existing ballast. When a standards- 
compliant lamp for that ballast is not 
available, the consumer purchases a 
new lamp and ballast. For the NOPR, 
DOE added a residential sector GSFL 
lamp failure event. 
• Standards-Induced Retrofit (Event 
II): This event occurs when a consumer 
realizes that its T12 lamp will fail in the 
near future and installs a standards- 
compliant lamp and ballast. In the base 
case, the consumer would have installed 
only a new lamp. This event applies 
only to T12 commercial and industrial 
users because there are certain lamp 
standard levels that a T12 cannot meet. 
This event does not apply to T12 
residential users because these users 
would not proactively replace their T12 
system before the T12 lamp fails. 
• Ballast Failure (Event III): In the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE assumed that 
failed ballasts would be replaced with 
electronic ballasts because standards set 
by the 2000 Ballast Rule and EPACT 
2005 ban the sale of magnetic 4-foot 
medium bipin and 8-foot single pin 
slimline ballasts beginning in 2010. 73 
FR 13620, 13664 (March 13, 2008). 
NEMA commented that the 2000 Ballast 
Rule allows the continued sale of 
residential magnetic ballasts as well as 
magnetic cold-temperature ballasts, 
which operate a large portion of the 
installed base of T12 recessed double 
contact high-output lamps. (NEMA, No. 
22 at p. 20) In response, DOE has 
assumed that failed magnetic HO 
ballasts would be replaced with 
magnetic ballasts in the base case for the 
NOPR analysis. DOE also assumed that 
magnetic ballasts would be purchased 
in the event of a ballast or fixture failure 
in the residential sector base case for the 
NOPR analysis because residential 
systems are commonly T12 magnetic 
systems currently. In addition, 
standards established in the 2000 
Ballast Rule and the Energy Policy Act 
of 2005 (EPACT 2005, Pub. L. 109–58) 
will allow magnetic ballasts to continue 
to be sold in the residential sector after 
2010. See the engineering analysis 
(section V.C) for further details. 
• Ballast Retrofit (Event IV): This 
event applies only to T12 users because, 
according to industry experts, the 
majority of ballast retrofits occur for 
consumers with T12 systems. 
Consumers retrofitting their ballasts 
commonly do so to save energy, and T8 
systems are generally more efficacious 
than T12 systems. 
• New Construction and Renovation 
(Event V): This event encompasses all 
fixture installations where the lighting 
design will be completely new or can be 
completely changed. The scenario 
applies only to baseline lamps that are 
usually used in new construction and 
renovation (4-foot T8 lamps, 4-foot T12 
lamps in the residential sector, 8-foot 
single pin slimline T8 lamps, and 8-foot 
recessed double contact HO T12 lamps). 
For the NOPR analysis, DOE assumed 
that 4-foot T8 lamps with electronic 
ballasts would be chosen during the 
new construction and renovation event 
for the 4-foot T12 residential baseline. 
E. National Impact Analysis—National 
Energy Savings and Net Present Value 
Analysis 
1. General 
DOE’s NIA assesses the national 
energy savings (NES) and the national 
net present value (NPV) of total 
customer costs and savings that would 
be expected to result from new 
standards at specific efficacy levels. 
DOE uses the NIA spreadsheets to 
calculate energy savings and NPV based 
on the annual energy consumption and 
total installed cost data employed in the 
LCC analysis. DOE forecasts the energy 
savings, energy cost savings, equipment 
costs, and NPV for each product class 
from 2012 through 2042. The forecasts 
provide annual and cumulative values 
for all four output parameters. DOE also 
examines impact sensitivities by 
analyzing various lamp shipment 
scenarios (such as Roll-up and Shift). 
DOE develops a base-case forecast for 
each analyzed lamp type which 
characterizes energy use and consumer 
costs (lamp purchase and operation) in 
the absence of new or revised energy 
conservation standards. To evaluate the 
impacts of such standards on these 
lamps, DOE compares the estimated 
base-case projection with projections 
characterizing the market if DOE did 
promulgate new or amended standards 
(i.e., the standards case). In 
characterizing the base and standards 
cases, DOE considers historical 
shipments, the mix of efficacies sold in 
the absence of any new standards, and 
how that mix might change over time. 
Inputs and issues associated with the 
NIA are discussed immediately below. 
a. Overview of NIA Changes in This 
Notice 
Based on the comments it received on 
the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE made a

2. Shipments Analysis 
Lamp shipments are an important 
input to the NIA. In the March 2008 
ANOPR, DOE followed a four-step 
approach to forecast shipments for 
GSFL and IRL. 73 FR 13620, 13668 
(March 13, 2008). First, DOE used 
NEMA’s historical shipment data from 
2001 to 2005 to estimate total historical 
(NEMA members and non-NEMA 
members) shipments of each analyzed 
lamp type in the commercial, industrial, 
and residential sectors. Second, using 
these historical shipments, DOE linearly 
extrapolated shipments to 2011. Then, 
based on average service lifetimes, DOE 
estimated a stock of lamps in 2011 for 
each lamp type. Next, DOE forecasted 
lamp (and ballast for GSFL) shipments 
from 2012 to 2042 (the NIA analysis 
period) based on four market events: (1) 
New construction; (2) ballast failure 
(GSFL only); (3) lamp replacement; and 
(4) standards-induced retrofit (for the 
standards case). Lastly, because these 
shipments depend on lamp and lamp- 
system properties (e.g., lifetime and 
lumen output), DOE developed base- 
case and standards-case market-share 
matrices. These matrices determine the 
forecasted technology mixes in the lamp 
stock and shipments. 
Table V.4 and Table V.5 summarize 
the approach and data DOE used for 
GSFL and IRL, respectively, to derive 
the inputs to the shipments analysis for 
the March 2008 ANOPR, as well as the 
changes DOE made for the NOPR. A 
discussion of the inputs and the changes 
follows.

a. Lamp Inventory 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
linearly extrapolated NEMA’s historical 
lamp shipments from 2005 to 2011 to 
establish a 2011 installed stock of GSFL 
and IRL using each lamp’s average 
service lifetime. In its written 
comments, NEMA argued that DOE’s 
linear extrapolation approach does not 
account for market dynamics and is 
vulnerable to certain temporal biases 
inherent in NEMA’s historical data. For 
example, if a new product was 
introduced and rapidly gained market 
share during this historical shipment 
period, a linear extrapolation based on 
this data could exaggerate the growth 
rate of this product in future years. 
Likewise, any new products introduced 
would be excluded from the future 
results. For example, Philips noted at 
the public meeting that because DOE 
extrapolated shipment data from 2001 to 
2005 to establish its lamp stocks, it may 
have discounted migration to T5 lamps, 
which have only started to grow in the 
last couple of years. Thus, the 
commenter argued that DOE may have 
overstated the 2011 stock of some types 
of lamps (e.g., T8 lamps), while 
understating others (e.g., T5 lamps). 
(NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 23–25, 31; Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 246) 
On the other hand, NEMA suggested 
that a linear extrapolation is sometimes 
appropriate for lamps with small and 
stable market shares, such as 8-foot T8 
recessed double contact HO lamps. 
However, for large and variable product 
classes, NEMA urged DOE to model 
lamp types against specific economic 
factors and technical relationships. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 24) 
DOE agrees that a linear extrapolation 
may generally be too limited in its 
application, and that lamp shipment 
forecasts from 2006 to 2011 should 
incorporate both market dynamics and 
macroeconomic factors. Therefore, DOE 
is no longer using a linear extrapolation

from historical data. Instead, for this 
NOPR, DOE calculated an installed 
stock of lamps in 2005 and applied 
growth, replacement rate, and emerging 
technologies assumptions to develop 
shipments estimates from 2006 to 2042. 
In addition, DOE received confidential 
shipment information from NEMA for 
2006 and 2007, and, when possible, 
calibrated the shipments model to 
match that information. The 
assumptions used to develop shipment 
forecasts are discussed in the following 
sections. 
b. Shipments Growth 
To develop the shipments models for 
both GSFL and IRL, DOE applied 
several growth rate assumptions. In the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE modeled 
GSFL shipments from 2012 to 2042 by 
projecting lumen growth based on 
lumen demand serviced by each lamp 
type in the commercial and industrial 
sectors. For IRL, DOE projected 
shipments through 2042 based on 
growth in the number of sockets using 
IRL in the commercial and residential 
sectors. DOE based forecasted lumen 
and socket growth for GSFL and IRL on 
historical residential building growth 
from RECS and historical commercial 
and industrial floor space growth from 
CBECS and MECS. 
DOE received a number of comments 
in response to its growth rate 
methodology. The majority of these 
comments fell into three categories: (1) 
The limits of basing lamp stock growth 
on historical floor space growth; (2) the 
increasing number of lamps per 
household; and (3) the wider spacing of 
more-efficient light fixtures. Below is a 
discussion of those comments. For 
further details regarding GSFL and IRL 
growth rate assumptions, see TSD 
chapter 10. 
i. Floor Space and Building Growth 
NEMA stated that the commercial and 
residential growth rates DOE used in the 
March 2008 ANOPR (based on total 
floor space from CBECS in RECS) have 
likely led to an overstatement of lamp 
shipments and stock, given the 
deteriorating economy. (NEMA, No. 22 
at pp. 23–24) DOE understands NEMA’s 
concerns and no longer establishes its 
commercial and residential growth from 
historical floor space growth. Instead, 
for this NOPR, DOE modeled 
commercial floor space and residential 
buildings growth based on AEO2008, 
which estimates year-to-year 
commercial floor space and residential 
building growth. Because AEO2008 
takes into account future trends in 
economic growth, DOE was able to 
incorporate forecasts of macroeconomic 
conditions in its growth forecast. 
However, because AEO does not 
provide industrial floor space forecasts, 
DOE used historical MECS floor space 
values to establish a growth rate for the 
industrial sector. 
ii. Lamps per Household 
The Joint Comment stated that DOE’s 
growth forecasts omitted an important 
factor driving IRL sales: a trend toward 
an increasing number of recessed 
fixtures per home in new construction 
and existing home renovation. Because 
this trend is excluded from DOE’s 
analysis, which assumed growth based 
on floor space growth, the Joint 
Comment argued that IRL shipments are 
likely understated. NEMA also stated 
that it has seen a trend toward 
increasing light points per home. To 
address this development, the Joint 
Comment recommended DOE obtain 
additional data on sales trends of these 
lamps and not assume recessed socket 
growth was directly proportional to 
floor space growth. The Joint Comment, 
PG&E, and ACEEE cited several studies 
supporting this claim. (Joint Comment, 
No. 23 at p. 17; Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 287–288; 
NEMA, No. 22 at p. 31) 
DOE agrees with the Joint Comment 
that the increasing popularity of 
recessed fixtures in new homes will 
drive IRL sales growth faster in the 
residential sector. New homes are likely 
to install more IRL than those installed 
in older homes, and older homes may be 
renovated to include more recessed cans 
and, thus, more reflector lamps. 
Therefore, DOE conducted an analysis 
that estimated the average number of 
recessed cans in homes between 2005 
and 2042. Using California data 49 on 
recessed cans per home broken out by 
home age, DOE assumed new homes 
constructed after 2005 would install the 
same number of recessed cans as homes 
constructed between 2001 and 2005. 
DOE also assumed that half of the 
homes constructed before 2001 would 
be renovated by 2042 to have an equal 
number of recessed cans as newly 
constructed homes. DOE estimated the 
distribution of homes by age using U.S. 
Census data 50 on new building starts in 
the residential sector. DOE estimated 
new construction and the number of 
future homes constructed in each year 
from AEO2008. Using this data, DOE 
estimated that the average number of 
recessed cans per home in 2005 was 
4.82, and the average number of 
recessed cans per home in 2042 will be 
8.52. As noted above, DOE also agrees 
with NEMA that growth rates should 
include forecasts of economic 
conditions. Therefore, to estimate the 
growth rate in each year, DOE 
multiplied the number of recessed cans 
in homes by the projected stock of 
homes according to AEO2008. 
Combining these two sources, DOE 
predicts an average growth rate of 
sockets of 2.6 percent between 2006 and 
2042, compared to the 1.6 percent DOE 
estimated in the March 2008 ANOPR. 
DOE estimated the GSFL growth rate 
in the residential sector using a 
methodology similar to that which it 
employed for IRL in the residential 
sector. Instead of using the number of 
recessed cans per home by home age, 
DOE used the number of T8 and T12 
lamps by home age. Again, DOE 
assumed that the same number of T8 
and T12 lamps per home would be 
installed in new homes as those 
installed between 2001 and 2005, and 
that half of homes built before 2001 
would be renovated by 2042 to have the 
same number of T8 and T12 lamps as 
newly constructed homes. DOE 
estimated that the average number of T8 
and T12 lamps per home in 2005 was 
4.5, and the average number in 2042 
will be 4.7. Combining this growth 
estimate with AEO2008’s projected 
growth in the residential home stock 
yields an average growth rate of 1 
percent between 2006 and 2042 for 
GSFL in the residential sector. 
Compared to IRL, the lower GSFL 
growth rate reflects the lower growth 
rate of T8 and T12 lamps per home 
versus recessed cans. (In the March 
2008 ANOPR, DOE did not consider the 
residential sector for GSFL.) 
iii. Wider Spacing of More-Efficient 
Fixtures 
In its written comments, NEMA 
suggested that DOE should assume a 
slower growth rate in the commercial 
building IRL socket base to account for 
wider spacing of lighting fixtures and/ 
or greater use of high-output systems. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 31) While DOE 
appreciates NEMA’s comment, it was 
unable to find (and the commenter did 
not provide) any information related to 
wider spacing between fixtures, and, 
therefore, DOE did not change growth 
estimates to account for this potential 
effect.

c. Base-Case Scenarios: Emerging 
Technologies and Existing Technologies 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
estimated that by 2042 R–CFL and 
emerging technologies, (e.g., such as 
LED lamps, and ceramic metal halide 
(CMH) lamps) would compose 50 
percent of IRL sockets in the installed 
base. 73 FR 13620, 13670 (March 13, 
2008). For IRL, DOE accounted for the 
impact of emerging technologies by 
deducting their market share in each 
year over the analysis period from the 
installed base of lamps, effectively 
reducing the size of the market affected 
by the standards proposed in this 
rulemaking. In the March 2008 ANOPR, 
DOE did not account for any penetration 
of emerging technologies into the GSFL 
market, and requested comment on if 
and how it should incorporate their 
effects into its analyses. 
DOE received several comments on its 
consideration of emerging technologies. 
NEMA argued that the performance 
improvements of CMH will drive the 
technology’s market penetration into the 
GSFL market. NEMA also asserted that 
LED lamps could displace GSFL 
shipments to some extent by 2042. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 24–26) As for 
emerging technologies in the IRL 
market, NEMA commented that LED 
lamps could also displace shipments of 
IRL to some extent by 2042, particularly 
in the residential sector. NEMA stated 
that the shift from halogen IRL to CMH 
is already occurring in the retail market. 
Industrial Ecology stated that an 
integrated PAR CMH lamp would be 
expected to replace other IRL PAR 
lamps in the commercial retail market. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 24–26; Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 307– 
309) NEMA argued that these emerging 
technologies will significantly affect 
future lamp shipments and reduce the 
NPV results of standards for both GSFL 
and IRL. To more accurately forecast the 
impact of emerging technologies, NEMA 
suggested that DOE should examine 
historical price and performance points 
of R–CFL, as well as product cycles for 
other advanced technology equipment. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at pp. 24–26) Industrial 
Ecology suggested that DOE should use 
semiconductor industry data to assess 
the manufacturing capacity for solid 
state lamps. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at p. 311–312) 
DOE agrees that emerging 
technologies could penetrate GSFL and 
IRL markets and significantly affect 
shipment forecasts and NIA results. 
Therefore, for the NOPR, DOE has 
revised its analysis of emerging 
technologies within the IRL market and 
now accounts for emerging technologies 
within the GSFL market as well. These 
emerging technologies already are, or 
eventually will likely be, significantly 
more efficacious and longer lasting than 
the lamps they replace. However, to 
calculate the energy savings and NPV 
benefits due to the penetration of an 
emerging technology, DOE must 
accurately forecast the anticipated price 
and performance points of the 
individual technologies—a difficult and 
highly speculative task. Forecasts 
related to emerging technologies are 
inherently uncertain because they 
depend upon assumptions about future 
price, efficacy, and utility, none of 
which can be verified. Therefore, for the 
NOPR, DOE has chosen to analyze two 
base-case scenarios for both GSFL and 
IRL: (1) Existing Technologies, and (2) 
Emerging Technologies. DOE believes 
evaluating two base-case scenarios more 
completely characterizes the inherent 
uncertainty of the market penetration of 
the technologies and the consequent 
impact on NPV and NES. Incorporating 
emerging technologies in the base case 
does not affect the relative benefits of 
each TSL and prevents uncertain 
projections of market share, price, or 
performance from obscuring the benefits 
derived from more-efficient GSFL and 
IRL alone. 
For these base-case scenarios, DOE 
estimated the market penetration of 
three specific technologies into the 
projected installed stock: (1) LED lamps; 
(2) CMH lamps; and (3) reflector CFL. In 
general, the Existing Technologies 
scenario only considers the market 
penetration of technologies that are 
currently readily available and have 
reached maturation in terms of price 
and efficacy. Specifically, DOE 
considers R–CFL in the Existing 
Technologies scenario within the IRL 
market. For GSFL, no technologies other 
than those covered by this rulemaking 
were analyzed in the Existing 
Technologies scenario. (DOE considers 
the migration to T5 lamps, a covered 
product, separately, as discussed in 
section V.E.2.d.) 
In the Emerging Technologies 
scenario, DOE attempts to forecast the 
market penetration of mature 
technologies and those technologies that 
are still undergoing significant changes 
in price and efficacy. Specifically, DOE 
considered the market penetration of R– 
CFL, LED lamps, and CMH lamps in the 
Emerging Technologies scenario. 
DOE generally followed a 5-step 
process for each scenario to estimate the 
market penetration of the analyzed 
technologies and account for their 
impact on NES and NPV. (Sector- and 
technology-specific aspects of DOE’s 
methodology are described below and in 
TSD chapter 10.) 
First, DOE developed price, 
performance, and efficacy forecasts for 
each of the analyzed technologies. 
DOE’s methodology in generating these 
forecasts for each analyzed technology 
is described below. Second, using those 
estimates, DOE calculated the payback 
period (PBP) of each technology in the 
relevant sector using the difference 
between its purchase price, annual 
electricity cost, and annual lamp 
replacement cost relative to the lamp it 
replaces. (See TSD chapter 10 for further 
details.) Third, DOE used a relationship 
between PBP and market penetration to 
predict the market penetration of each 
technology in the relevant sector in 
every year from 2006 to 2042. Generally, 
lower PBP of a given lamp technology 
results in a greater predicted market 
penetration of that technology. DOE 
used a 5-year average of the market 
penetrations predicted by the 
relationship as its final market 
penetration. The 5-year average 
represents the time DOE assumed it 
takes products with lower PBPs to 
penetrate the market. Fourth, when 
necessary, DOE applied a scaling factor 
to the predicted market penetration to 
account for observed market trends. 
Fifth, DOE reduced the projected 
installed stock of covered products in 
each year by the value that 
corresponded to the highest level of 
market penetration achieved in each 
year by one of the analyzed 
technologies. Thus, the inclusion of R– 
CFL and other lamps using emerging 
technologies in the base case have the 
effect of lowering the energy savings of 
a potential new standard. For those 
covered lamps remaining, the cost- 
effectiveness of LCC savings and, thus, 
the relative cost effectiveness of each 
TSL is not affected. 
Because the lamps employing 
emerging technologies are beyond the 
scope of the rulemaking, they are not 
considered design options to improving 
IRL or GSFL efficacy, but rather they 
may substitutes for the lamps covered in 
this rulemaking. In the Emerging 
Technologies base case, DOE uses its 
prices projections effectively as inputs 
into its shipments forecasts of its 
covered products, rather than forecasts 
of shipments of lamps employing the 
emerging technologies themselves. In 
this way, the price projections of the 
analyzed lamps using emerging 
technologies indirectly affect the NPV of 
the present rulemaking, despite not 
being a direct input into equipment 
prices. As stated previously, to 
acknowledge the uncertainty of price 
forecasts for lamps using emerging

State Lighting Research and Development (March

52 Because they are based on an existing LED 
retrofit kit, DOE’s projections did not consider 
innovations in form factor on OLED tyechnology 
which could improve the possible payback period 
for solid-state lighting technologies. 
technologies, DOE models two base-case 
scenarios. 
i. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
For the Existing Technologies 
scenario, DOE believes that no mature 
technologies in the current market show 
the potential to significantly penetrate 
the GSFL market. (T5 lamps, previously 
considered an emerging technology, are 
now a covered product class.) Therefore, 
for the Existing Technologies scenario, 
DOE considered only the fluorescent 
technologies already covered by this 
rulemaking. Thus, except for the 
addition of T5 lamps, the Existing 
Technologies base case in this NOPR is 
the same as the base case in the March 
2008 ANOPR. 
In the GSFL Emerging Technology 
scenario, however, DOE separately 
considered the potential market 
penetration of two technologies: (1) 
LEDs (into the commercial, residential, 
and industrial sectors); and (2) CMH 
(into the commercial and industrial 
sectors). 
For its analysis of LED market 
penetration, DOE found a commercially- 
available retrofit kit that included a LED 
replacement for a 4-foot medium bipin 
system. DOE used the retrofit kit as a 
current baseline from which to project 
future cost, efficacy, and price points. 
DOE interviewed an integrated circuit 
manufacturer to develop cost estimates 
for LED driver circuits. For cost 
estimates of other components, DOE 
used prices of existing LED products 
already on the market, which it 
modified in accordance with cost data 
and efficacy projections from DOE’s 
Solid State Lighting Multi-Year Program 
Plan.51 Lastly, using markup based on 
currently-available LED lamps, DOE was 
able to develop price and efficacy 
projections for the LED luminaire in the 
retrofit kit.52 Following the 5-step 
process described above, DOE 
calculated a 41 percent market 
penetration rate of LED lamps into the 
4-foot GSFL commercial sector by 2042. 
DOE assumed LED lamps penetrated 
only the new construction, renovation, 
and fixture replacement markets 
because these lamps would require their 
own specific fixtures. In the residential 
sector, the LED option did not have a 
low enough payback period to result in 
any market penetration. 
DOE also analyzed the potential 
penetration of CMH into the GSFL 
market. DOE first estimated current 
CMH prices using a methodology 
similar to the methodology it used to 
estimate GSFL and IRL prices, as 
described in the product price 
determination. (See TSD chapter 7.) 
Industry experts informed DOE that 
CMH efficacies and lifetimes would 
increase over the next several years 
while prices would remain constant. 
Applying these lifetime and efficacy 
projections DOE compared CMH 
replacements to GSFL systems. As a 
result, DOE assumed no market 
penetration of CMH because it found 
that T5 lamp systems (standard output 
and high output) would always be less 
costly and more efficacious than 
projected CMH replacements. Given this 
information, DOE believes that it is 
likely that migration to CMH (from the 
GSFL market) will be dominated by the 
migration to standard-output and high- 
output T5 lamps. 
ii. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
As with GSFL, DOE considered two 
base case scenarios for IRL: Existing 
Technologies and Emerging 
Technologies. Because DOE believes 
that R–CFL is a mature technology with 
relatively stable price points and 
efficacies, DOE considered R–CFL 
penetration into the residential market 
in the Existing Technologies scenario. In 
contrast, for the Emerging Technologies 
scenario, DOE considered the market 
penetration of R–CFL, LED, and CMH 
lamps in both the residential and 
commercial sectors. DOE separately 
calculated the penetration of each 
technology into the IRL stock by using 
the 5-step process described above. 
For R–CFL, DOE developed price 
forecasts based on historical pricing 
trends of CFL and R–CFL, using a 
methodology similar to the methodology 
DOE used to estimate GSFL and IRL 
prices, as described in the product price 
determination. (See TSD chapter 7.) 
DOE assumed no future change in 
efficacy. Using this data, DOE found the 
market penetration predicted by the PBP 
relationship. However, PG&E argued 
that R–CFL are not always suitable 
substitutes for IRL because they lack 
dimming capabilities and their beam 
width is too broad. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 289, 321) 
Industrial Ecology commented that 
dimmable R–CFL do in fact exist, while 
PG&E noted that these lamps have little 
market share. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 291, 321) DOE 
agrees that R–CFL may not always be 
appropriate substitutes for IRL, due to 
differences in form factor, beam spread, 
color quality, size and dimming 
capability. DOE observed that the actual 
market penetration of CFL replacements 
for A-line incandescent lamps thus far 
has been approximately 40 percent of 
the penetration predicted by the PBP- 
penetration relationship. Therefore, 
DOE applied these same scaling-factor 
reductions of 40 percent and 36 percent 
in calculating the market penetration of 
R–CFL into the IRL market for the 
residential and commercial sectors, 
respectively. 
For LED and CMH lamps in the IRL 
market, DOE developed price and 
efficacy forecasts using a methodology 
similar to the one described above for 
GSFL. DOE did not apply the scaling 
factor reduction to the predicted LED 
and CMH market penetration rates that 
it used for the R–CFL analysis. DOE 
believes the substitutability problems 
that arise when R–CFL replace IRL do 
not apply when LED and CMH replace 
IRL. 
By the methodology described, DOE 
arrived at market penetration values 
(and market size reductions) for each 
base-case scenario. For the Existing 
Technology scenario, 2042 R–CFL 
penetration reached 38 percent in the 
residential sector and 20 percent in the 
commercial sector. (This was the 
highest market penetration because it 
was the only technology analyzed for 
the scenario.) For the Emerging 
Technology scenario, LED reached the 
highest market penetration of any 
analyzed technology in both the 
residential sector and the commercial 
sector. DOE’s analysis found LED lamps 
could penetrate 40 percent and 82 
percent of the IRL installed stock by 
2042 in the residential and commercial 
sector, respectively. DOE’s results 
support a comment by Industrial 
Ecology stating that emerging 
technologies will enter the commercial 
market first. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at p. 308) This effect occurs 
because there are higher installation and 
operating costs in the commercial sector 
relative to the residential sector, 
resulting in lower PBPs and faster 
migration to emerging technologies. 
Again, DOE used these results to 
effectively reduce the size of the IRL 
market for its analysis. 
d. Fluorescent Market Sectors Analyzed 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
modeled both the commercial and 
industrial market sectors to generate 
GSFL shipments forecasts. DOE 
received several comments on its 
decision not to model the residential 
sector. 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16964 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
GE commented that DOE should 
model the residential sector because it 
makes substantial use of less-efficacious 
T12 lamps, which could be effectively 
eliminated by new standards. GE 
estimated that by 2012, roughly 20 
percent of GSFL shipments will be T12 
lamps, and more than half of those will 
go to residential consumers. PG&E 
stated that California codes only 
recently required higher-efficacy lamps 
in new construction; therefore, 4-foot 
T12 lamps with magnetic ballasts 
remain a large part of the residential 
installed stock. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 276–279) 
The Joint Comment asserted that a 
separate analysis for the residential 
sector is unnecessary; however, the Joint 
Comment recommended that residential 
applications should be accounted for in 
DOE’s LCC analysis based on the 
proportion of lamp sales, operating 
hours, and electric rates. The Joint 
Comment stated DOE should use 
caution in apportioning all sales 
through do-it-yourself (DIY) stores, such 
as Home Depot and Lowe’s, to the 
residential sector. (Joint Comment, No. 
23 at p. 10) PG&E and NEMA 
commented that approximately 20 
percent of DIY business is commercial. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 30; Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at p. 290) 
DOE agrees that it should model the 
residential sector to more accurately 
capture overall consumer behavior and 
the market impact of standards. DOE 
calculated the initial residential stock of 
4-foot medium bipin T12 lamps using 
the lamps sold through the DIY 
distribution chain, which accounted for 
approximately 25 percent of NEMA’s 
historical shipments. Next, DOE 
assumed 20 percent of those DIY sales 
went to small commercial consumers, 
with the remaining 80 percent 
apportioned to the residential sector. As 
a result, DOE assumed 20 percent of all 
4-foot medium bipin shipments went to 
the residential sector and all of those 
were T12 lamps. 
From those shipments, DOE 
calculated the residential installed stock 
and then modeled new construction, 
renovation, and fixture/ballast 
replacement in the same manner 
described in section 0. DOE assumed 
that in the base case, a portion of 
consumers will continue to purchase 4- 
foot T12 magnetic systems, while the 
remaining consumers will choose to 
purchase higher-efficacy 4-foot T8 and 
4-foot T12 electronic systems. Overall, 
the number of 4-foot T12 systems 
installed in the residential sectors is 
relatively constant over the analysis 
period. For more details regarding 
DOE’s assumptions in the residential 
sector, please see chapter 10 of the TSD. 
e. GSFL Product Migration 
DOE received many comments on its 
assumptions characterizing how 
consumers will migrate among different 
GSFL products. These comments were 
primarily focused on the movement 
away from T12 systems and the 
migration toward T5 systems, topics 
discussed in detail below. 
i. Ballast Rule Effective Start Date 
NEMA commented that the 2000 
Ballast Rule does not ban T12 magnetic 
ballasts in the commercial sector until 
June 2010. This means these ballasts 
will be available through the end of 
2010, and not 2009 as DOE’s model had 
assumed, because some T12s will 
remain in the distribution chain for a 
period of months after the rule takes 
effect. Therefore, NEMA argued, DOE 
should expect T12 lamps to continue to 
be shipped beyond 2022, the year DOE 
projected the lamps will phase out. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 25, 28) DOE agrees 
with NEMA that commercial sector 
magnetic ballasts will continue to be 
available through 2010 and has revised 
its model accordingly to better reflect 
the timing of the 2000 Ballast Rule’s 
effective start date of amended 
standards. According to the revised 
model, DOE estimates that the majority 
of banned magnetic T12 ballasts will be 
eliminated from the installed stock by 
2025. However, as discussed below, the 
inclusion of T12 electronic ballasts 
results in T12 lamps being shipped 
throughout the analysis period. 
ii. Four-Foot Medium Bipin T12 Lamp 
Replacements 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
assumed that 100 percent of 4-foot T12 
systems would be replaced by 4-foot T8 
systems upon ballast failure. This 
assumption was made in consideration 
of the 2000 Ballast Rule, which 
effectively banned most 4-foot T12 
medium bipin magnetic ballasts. 10 CFR 
part 430.32(m)(5) DOE received several 
comments related to this assumption 
and the implications for DOE’s GSFL 
shipments analysis. 
Stakeholders generally agreed that 
DOE’s base-case assumption was too 
optimistic in terms of the migration 
from 4-foot T12 to 4-foot T8 systems. 
The comments provided two reasons 
why consumers would be expected to 
maintain T12 electronic ballasts and not 
migrate to T8 lamps. First, because the 
installed stock is dominated by T12 
lamps, it is unlikely all consumers 
would switch to T8 lamps upon 
repurchase, especially when spot re- 
ballasting. Some commercial sector 
consumers would be expected to use 
another T12 lamp and ballast to 
maintain visual consistency with other 
lamps in a room. Second, the Joint 
Comment noted that residential low- 
power-factor ballasts are not subject to 
the 2000 Ballast Rule, meaning legal 
ballasts compatible with T12 lamps will 
continue to exist. 10 CFR part 
430.32(m)(7)(iii). Similarly, Osram 
Sylvania made the same point and 
commented that 4-foot T12 medium 
bipin magnetic ballast systems are 
common in the residential sector. Osram 
Sylvania added that some fixtures 
include electronic ballasts and are 
marketed as being capable of operating 
T12 lamps, which could perpetuate T12 
usage. NEMA added that cold 
temperature ballasts for 8-foot T12 RDC 
high output lamps are still allowed 
under the rule as well. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 248–251, 276, 
281; NEMA, No. at pp. 25, 28; Joint 
Comment, No. 23 at p. 7) 
The stakeholders did differ slightly on 
the appropriate replacement rates that 
DOE should assume. The Joint 
Comment recommended DOE assume 5 
to 10 percent of the commercial market 
and a higher proportion of the 
residential market will purchase T12 
lamp and ballast systems upon ballast 
failure, with the remainder migrating to 
T8 systems. (Joint Comment, No. 23 at 
p. 7) GE estimated that about 20 percent 
of the currently installed base of T12 
lamps will be replaced by T12 lamps, 
while the other 80 percent will migrate 
to T8 lamps. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at pp. 250–252) NEMA suggested 
that DOE should assume that in 2022, 
T12 lamps will compose at least 10 
percent of the 4-foot lamp market, 40 
percent of the 8-foot single pin slimline 
market, and over 90 percent of the RDC 
HO market. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 28) 
After careful consideration of these 
comments, DOE has decided to modify 
its assumption regarding the rate of 
migration from T12 to T8 lamps. 
Accordingly, DOE is using NEMA’s 
estimates to recalibrate its shipment 
forecasts. DOE now agrees that not all 4- 
foot T12 lamps would be replaced by T8 
systems upon ballast failure. Thus, for 
this NOPR, DOE assumed 90 percent 
(down from 100 percent) of 4-foot T12 
systems will be replaced with T8 
systems and 10 percent with T12 
systems. According to DOE’s estimates 
in 2022, T12 lamps will comprise nearly 
20 percent of the 4-foot medium bipin 
market, 25 percent of the 8-foot single 
pin slimline market, and 93 percent of 
the 8-foot recessed double contact HO 
market. (See TSD chapter 10.) DOE 
notes that these estimates do not exactly

53 As discussed earlier, DOE models two base- 
case shipment scenarios: Existing Technologies and 
Emerging Technologies. Because the Emerging 
Technologies scenario models the potential 
substitution of GSFL systems with lamps that 
incorporate emerging technologies (such as LED), 
the Emerging Technologies scenario generally 
results in fewer shipments of GSFL. However, based 
on price and technology advancement projections, 
DOE estimated that these emerging technologies 
will not likely significantly penetrate the GSFL 
market until after 2012. 
54 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, ‘‘Energy 
Conservation Program for Commercial and 
Industrial Equipment: High-Intensity Discharge 
Lamps Analysis of Potential Energy Savings’’ (Dec. 
2004). Available at: http://www1.eere.energy.gov/ 
buildings/appliance_standards/commercial/pdfs/ 
hid_energy_savings_report.pdf. 
align with NEMA’s suggestions, because 
they incorporate several other 
phenomena in addition to the migration 
to T12 electronic systems (e.g., growth 
rate, emerging technologies, T5 
penetration, 8-foot SP slimline to 4-foot 
MBP conversions). 
iii. Eight-Foot Single Pin Slimline T12 
Lamp Replacements 
For its shipments forecasts in the 
March 2008 ANOPR, DOE assumed that 
90 percent of the 8-foot T12 single pin 
systems would be replaced with two 4- 
foot T8 systems, and 10 percent would 
be replaced by 8-foot single pin T8 
systems. In its written comments, 
NEMA generally agreed with DOE’s 
assumption but provided slightly 
different replacement rate: NEMA 
suggested that DOE should assume 80 
percent of the 8-foot T12 single pin 
lamps would be replaced by two 4-foot 
T8 lamps and 20 percent by 8-foot T8 
lamps. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 28) ACEEE 
and the Joint Comment argued that 
DOE’s assumption that 90 percent of the 
8-foot market would switch to 4-foot 
lamps is much too high, particularly 
because the current stock is dominated 
by T12. The Joint Comment also stated 
that DOE should include some 
electronic T12 system ballast purchases, 
as in the case of 4-foot T12 lamps. 
(Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at 
pp. 254–255; Joint Comment, No. 23 at 
p. 7) 
Based on its consideration of the 
above comments, DOE revised its 
estimated conversion rates for 8-foot 
single pin slimline systems in this 
NOPR. In line with the Joint Comment 
and NEMA’s recommendations, DOE 
lowered its conversion rates to 4-foot 
MBP systems. In addition, consistent 
with NEMA’s suggestion, DOE has 
included a conversion to electronic 8- 
foot T12 SP slimline systems. DOE now 
assumes 80 percent of the 8-foot T12 
single pin lamps would be replaced by 
two 4-foot MBP T8 systems, with the 
remaining 20 percent split evenly 
between 8-foot T8 and electronic 8-foot 
T12 SP slimline systems. 
iv. Four-Foot T5 Lamps 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE did 
not analyze 4-foot miniature bipin T5 
standard output (SO) and high output 
(HO) lamps as covered product classes. 
As discussed in section A.1.b above, for 
this NOPR, DOE is proposing to cover 
both T5 SO and T5 HO lamps as 
additional, distinct product classes. The 
following describes the methodology 
DOE used to generate shipments of 
these lamps. 
To establish the 2005 installed stock 
of T5 lamps, DOE first estimated 2001- 
to-2005 shipments based on 
assumptions derived from its market 
research and supported by manufacturer 
interviews. Market literature indicated 
that T5 lamps represented 2 percent of 
the 2004 GSFL market, a figure DOE 
assumed for its analysis. DOE’s research 
also indicated that the combined market 
share of T5 SO and HO lamps was 
growing as a percentage of the overall 
GSFL market. Additionally, in 
interviews, manufacturers provided 
insight on the proportions of T5 lamp 
sales that are standard output and high 
output. Using these assumptions, DOE 
generated historical shipment estimates 
for 2001 to 2005, which it used to 
calculate the initial stock of SO and HO 
lamps in the same manner it does for all 
other GSFL product classes. Finally, 
DOE received confidential aggregated 
(both SO and HO) T5 lamp shipment 
data from NEMA for 2001 to 2007. DOE 
used this data to validate its installed 
stock estimates. 
In general, after establishing the 2005 
T5 SO and HO installed stocks, DOE 
modeled shipment growth based on a 
migration from other product classes. 
For T5 SO lamps specifically, DOE’s 
research indicated that shipment growth 
of these lamps is primarily driven by a 
migration from the 4-foot MBP market. 
In addition, because 4-foot T5 MiniBP 
SO systems require a different fixture 
than 4-foot MBP systems, T5 systems 
would be unlikely to penetrate the 
ballast-only replacement market. 
Therefore, to establish T5 standard 
output shipments, DOE allotted a 
portion of the 4-foot MBP fixture 
replacement, renovation, and new 
construction markets to 4-foot T5 
MiniBP systems. To do this, DOE first 
calculated the size of this potential 
market for new T5 SO systems in each 
year. DOE then determined the portion 
of this market that would actually be 
serviced by T5 SO lamps by calculating 
the share that resulted in T5 shipments 
consistent with 2006 and 2007 historical 
data. DOE held the resulting percentage 
(approximately 12.5 percent) constant 
throughout the analysis period. As a 
result of the inclusion of 4-foot T5 
MiniBP lamps eroding part of the 4-foot 
MBP market, estimates of total 4-foot 
MBP lamp shipments are lower in the 
NOPR than in the ANOPR. Using this 
methodology, in the base case Emerging 
Technologies scenario, DOE forecasts T5 
SO shipments of 15.0 million in 2008, 
24.2 million in 2012, and 47.4 million 
in 2025 (56.2 million in 2025 in the 
base-case Existing Technologies 
scenario).53 
For T5 HO lamps, after establishing 
the installed stock in 2005 in the same 
manner as with T5 SO lamps, DOE 
developed 4-foot T5 MiniBP HO lamp 
shipments by modeling a migration 
from two different lighting markets. 
Marketing literature indicated, similar 
to 8-foot RDC HO systems, a large 
portion of 4-foot MiniBP T5 HO systems 
serve high-bay (ceilings higher than 20- 
feet high) applications due to their 
highly-concentrated light output. 
Historical shipment data for 8-foot RDC 
HO lamps showed substantial declines 
in 2006 and 2007, indicating T5 HO 
lamps may be rapidly displacing them. 
In addition, DOE’s research indicated 
that a significant portion of 4-foot T5 
HO growth can be attributed to a 
penetration into the high intensity 
discharge (HID) lamp high-bay and low- 
bay markets. Therefore, to calculate the 
growth in 4-foot MiniBP T5 HO lamp 
shipments, DOE assumed that these 
systems were penetrating both the 8-foot 
RDC HO and HID markets. Similar to its 
analysis for T5 SO systems, DOE 
established that the fixture replacement, 
renovation, and new construction 
market segments represent the available 
market for T5 HO systems. DOE 
obtained HID shipment data from the 
2004 HID determination,54 from which 
DOE calculated the total lumens 
servicing low-bay and high-bay 
applications. Then, consistent with 
historical T5 and 8-foot RDC HO 
shipments, DOE assumed T5 HO would 
fully penetrate the 8-foot RDC HO new 
construction, renovation, and fixture 
replacement markets, as well as the HID 
new construction and renovation 
market. Using this methodology, DOE 
forecasts T5 HO shipments of 14.0 
million in 2008, 23.6 million in 2012, 
and 46.1 million in 2025. 
For further details on shipment 
forecasts of 4-foot T5 lamps, see chapter 
10 of the TSD. DOE seeks public 
comment on its analysis of the 4-foot T5 
SO and HO markets, as well as its 
shipment results.

3. Base-Case Market-Share Matrices 
DOE’s market-share matrices are 
another important input into the 
shipments analysis and NIA. Within 
each product class, DOE considers the 
mix of technologies from which 
consumers can choose. These choices 
are represented in market-share 
matrices, which apportion market share 
for lamp stocks (in 2012) or lamp 
shipments (after 2012). Because 
shipments depend on lamp lifetime and 
system lumen output assumptions, 
among other inputs, DOE allocated 
market shares to each of the lamp 
technologies for the base case and 
standards case. The matrices enable the 
shipment model to capture a migration 
to different lamps, or, for GSFL, lamp- 
and-ballast designs, over time in both 
the base and standards cases. Issues 
related to these market-share matrices 
are discussed below. 
a. General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
A ballast factor measures the actual 
lumen output of a lamp-and-ballast 
system relative to a reference system. A 
lower ballast factor will, all else equal, 
lead to lower lumen output, and 
proportionally less energy consumption 
than the reference system. ACEEE 
commented that the ballast factor of 
0.75 that DOE used in the market 
matrices is fairly uncommon and that 
manufacturers are now marketing lower 
ballast factors, including 0.7, 0.69, and 
0.68. Therefore, ACEEE expects a bigger 
jump from normal to low ballast factor 
than the 0.78–0.75 jump that DOE 
assumes in its market-share matrices 
presented in the ANOPR. The Joint 
Comment noted that 0.71 represents the 
mid-point of very low ballast factors on 
the market. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at pp. 262–263; Joint Comment, 
No. 21 at p. 10) Consistent with changes 
incorporated in the engineering 
analysis, DOE incorporated a 0.71 
ballast factor ballast option in the NIA. 
In sum, DOE attempts to match as 
closely as possible the lumen output of 
the retiring system and the replacement 
system. To the extent that a lower 
ballast factor can achieve the 
appropriate lumen output, it is 
incorporated into the technology 
choices facing consumers. 
Regarding the base-case 4-foot T8 
medium bipin market-share matrix, 
Industrial Ecology commented that DOE 
was incorrect to assume 0 percent 
market share for the 25W lamp in 2012. 
Because thousands of these lamps are 
being sold in 2008, that estimate should 
be much greater than zero. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 261) 
The Joint Comment stated that 30W 
lamps are being displaced by 25W and 
28W options. Therefore, DOE’s 30W 
market share assumptions—4 percent in 
2012 and 15 percent in 2042—are too 
large. The Joint Comment suggested that 
DOE should substantially reduce the 
market share of 30W lamps and split 
those sales between 25W and 28W 
lamps. (Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 10) 
NEMA commented on the same 
market-share matrix, stating that the 
market share for T8 lamps in the 2042 
base case should be less than 30 percent 
for 32W lamps and greater than 30 
percent for 25W lamps, with the rest of 
the market composed of 28W and 30W 
lamps. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 28) 
DOE considered the submitted 
comments and modified its base-case 4- 
foot T8 medium bipin market-share 
matrix accordingly. Based on a 
confidential NEMA survey of market 
shares of 4-foot medium bipin lamps, in 
2012, DOE allocated 4 percent, 4 
percent, and 2 percent of the 4-foot T8 
market share to 25W, 28W, and 30W 
lamps, respectively, for the revised 
NOPR base-case market-share matrices. 
In 2042, DOE allocated 32 percent, 27 
percent, and 14 percent market to 25W, 
28W, and 30W lamps, respectively. See 
chapter 10 of the NOPR TSD for the full 
market-share matrices in 2012 and 2042. 
b. Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
presented market-share matrices for 
both residential and commercial IRL. 
For the commercial sector, the base-case 
IRL market-share matrix apportioned 
market share of the stock to only 
halogen and the standard HIR (currently 
EL2) lamps. Although DOE received no 
comments from stakeholders, DOE 
modified these matrices for the NOPR to 
reflect changes made in the engineering 
analysis. For the NOPR, the base case 
market-share matrix for commercial IRL 
now allocates market share to all 
currently commercially-available lamp 
technologies, including improved 
halogen, long-life HIR, and the 
silverized reflector technology. DOE 
believes this revised distribution better 
reflects product availability and 
consumer purchasing trends because 
they include all covered lamp 
technologies currently being sold. 
4. GSFL Standards-Case Shipment 
Scenarios and Forecasts 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
modified its base-case market-share 
matrices to account for two standards- 
case scenarios and to generate shipment 
forecasts. DOE considered a Roll-up 
scenario and a Shift scenario, described 
below. DOE also introduced voluntary 
standards-induced retrofits in the 
standards case. DOE received several 
comments on the scenarios it analyzed 
and its rate of voluntary retrofits. In 
response to those and related comments, 
DOE is modifying its Shift and Roll-up 
scenarios and introducing new 
standards-case scenarios. These 
scenarios are discussed in detail below 
and in TSD chapter 10. 
a. Shift/Roll-Up Scenarios 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
modeled lower-bound and upper-bound 
energy conservation scenarios for the 
GSFL standards-case NIA to 
characterize the range of energy savings 
that may result from standards. 73 FR 
13620, 13671 (March 13, 2008). In the 
standards-case NIA for GSFL and 
commercial IRL, DOE first modeled a 
lower-bound energy conservation 
scenario called the Roll-up scenario. 73 
FR 13620, 13671 (March 13, 2008). This 
scenario assumes that consumers 
owning lamps or systems that do not 
meet the new standards will ‘‘roll up’’ 
to the lowest first-cost option available 
(preserving lumen output if possible) 
when purchasing standards-compliant 
lamps. (March 2008 ANOPR TSD 
chapter 9) The Roll-up scenario also 
assumes that consumers already owning 
standards-compliant lamps or systems 
will continue to purchase those lamps 
or systems. 
DOE also modeled a Shift scenario in 
the March 2008 ANOPR for the GSFL 
NIA, in which DOE assumed that 
consumers are driven by both lamps 
cost and energy savings. In this case, 
consumers may purchase a variety of 
lamps or systems that are more 
efficacious than their base case systems. 
(73 FR 13620, 13671 (March 13, 2008); 
March 2008 ANOPR TSD chapter 9) 
Specifically, consumers who purchase 
products in the base case at above- 
minimum standard levels will ‘‘shift 
up’’ to even higher efficacy standard 
levels in the Shift scenario. DOE used 
this scenario to illustrate upper-bound 
energy savings. 
The Joint Comment argued that both 
the Roll-up and Shift scenarios 
understate standards-case energy 
savings, but the Roll-up scenario is more 
unrealistic because standards change 
the relative economics of more-efficient 
products. (Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 
11) In other words, standards would 
eliminate the least-efficacious lamps 
(which usually have the lowest first 
costs), thereby reducing the cost 
premium of high-efficacy lamps relative 
to the lowest first-cost available lamp. 
According to the commenter, that would 
encourage some consumers to purchase 
lamps above the standards. The Joint 
Comment also argued that new 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 19:12 Apr 10, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\13APP2.SGM 13APP2
16967 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
standards would encourage 
manufacturers to promote more 
efficacious products, a market dynamic 
not sufficiently captured by either 
scenario. (Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 
11) 
The Joint Comment further stated that 
the Shift scenario reflects a more 
realistic consumer response to standards 
than the Roll-up scenario. Historically, 
for example, some consumers have 
purchased systems that are more 
efficacious than minimum standards. 
Still, the Joint Comment argued, the 
Shift scenario does not fully capture the 
spread of efficiencies in a standards- 
compliant market and fails to 
characterize manufacturer efforts to 
hasten development of more-efficient 
lamps and systems. The Joint Comment 
argued that DOE’s scenarios should 
anticipate voluntary programs and 
manufacturer interest in establishing 
more-efficient product lines in the 
standards case. (Joint Comment, No. 23 
at pp. 11, 22) 
Regarding the comment about the 
relative economics of lamp purchases, 
DOE agrees that the relative first-costs 
change in the standards case (i.e., the 
up-front cost differential between the 
least-cost, standards-compliant lamp 
and a more-efficient lamp) is less than 
in the base case. This effect is one of the 
reasons DOE models a Shift scenario. 
Still, DOE does not believe that this 
effect implies that the Shift scenario is 
necessarily more viable than the Roll-up 
scenario. Although the relative up-front 
economics change between cost and 
efficacy, they may not change between 
cost and income, meaning some 
consumers—particularly those not 
concerned about energy savings—may 
focus on the absolute costs at the time 
of purchase. A consumer’s lighting 
budget, for example, will not necessarily 
increase simply because there is a 
smaller cost premium for a more- 
efficacious lamp. In sum, DOE cannot be 
certain which scenario is more likely, 
and, thus, continues to model both 
scenarios. 
However, DOE agrees that revisions to 
the Shift scenario may better capture the 
spread of efficiencies in the market. 
Therefore, DOE revised its Shift 
scenario for the NOPR to more closely 
retain the existing (baseline) efficacy 
distribution in the standards case. (See 
TSD chapter 11 for the revised Shift 
scenario efficacy distribution results.) 
However, as the standard becomes more 
stringent, DOE has maintained its 
approach of incrementally accumulating 
market share of the lamp stock at TSL5 
and not projecting some to move beyond 
what now characterizes the maximum 
technologically feasible standard level 
(‘‘max-tech’’). It is not possible for DOE 
to model a spread of efficiencies above 
max-tech levels. DOE has interviewed 
manufacturers and concluded it cannot 
reasonably predict future price and 
performance points of technologies yet 
to be developed for the market. DOE 
seeks comment and supporting data on 
whether the Roll-up or Shift scenario is 
more appropriate. 
b. Lighting Expertise Scenarios 
In its written comments, NEMA stated 
that it considers the Shift scenario 
implausible because the scenario 
assumes consumers will ‘‘aggressively’’ 
migrate to lower-ballast-factor ballasts. 
NEMA strongly disagreed with DOE’s 
assumption that more-stringent efficacy 
standards are significantly correlated 
with lower GSFL ballast factors 
(particularly at CSLs 3, 4, and 5), and 
NEMA argued that it had seen no direct 
and demonstrated causal relationship 
between them in its experience. Further, 
NEMA argued that there is no proven 
correlation between new potential GSFL 
standards and the future mix of ballast 
factor values that will occur; therefore, 
NEMA reasoned that DOE should not 
apply such a correlation in its 
standards-case market-share matrices. 
NEMA also commented that new 
standards-compliant GSFL and their 
ballasts would have to be interoperable 
across manufacturers and with a wide 
range of existing ballasts and 
luminaires. Therefore, more-stringent 
efficacy standards would mostly yield 
greater lumen output, rather than 
decreasing lamp wattage. As such, 
NEMA argued, DOE has overreached in 
building a case for standards set at 
higher efficacy levels by inappropriately 
and arbitrarily assuming a strong 
correlation between increasing efficacy 
and decreasing ballast factor views. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 26, 27) 
NEMA also commented that the most 
direct way to use the efficacy 
improvements imposed by the standards 
is to use fewer luminaires to attain the 
same delivered light level on the work 
surface while reducing the total wattage. 
However, NEMA maintains that this is 
not a practical possibility because, even 
for new construction or major 
renovation projects, the spacing of 
luminaires is dictated by a building and 
ceiling system grid. Thus, there is no 
opportunity to take advantage of 
additional lumens that might result 
from standards by re-spacing existing 
luminaires, which must continue to 
operate on high-volume ballast designs. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 26) Based on these 
arguments, NEMA strongly asserted that 
moving beyond CSL1 and CSL2 for a 
lamp-only rulemaking is ill-advised. 
(NEMA, No. 22 at p. 26, 27) 
DOE has carefully considered 
NEMA’s comments on DOE’s 
assumption of a general trend toward 
lower-BF ballasts over the analysis 
period. In response, DOE undertook an 
extensive literature review and 
analysis—discussed below—to better 
characterize the likelihood of consumers 
migrating to lower-BF ballast systems if 
higher efficacy standards are required. 
DOE assessed the lighting expertise of 
groups of consumers, described below, 
who make lighting purchase decisions. 
DOE assumes that consumers with 
‘‘high’’ lighting expertise will be 
sufficiently educated about ballast 
factors and lamp efficacy to migrate to 
lower-ballast-factor ballasts when lower 
wattage lamps are not available in the 
standards case. That is, these consumers 
will seek to maintain light output in the 
replacement purchase. 
To analyze this issue, DOE first 
characterized the lighting market supply 
chain in the commercial and residential 
sectors and identified the decision 
makers within each one (e.g., 
contractors, homeowners). DOE broke 
down each sector by the principal 
events that prompt lamp purchases: (1) 
Ballast failure; (2) retrofit; (3) fixture 
replacement; (4) renovation; and (5) new 
construction. DOE assigned 
probabilities reflecting each decision 
maker’s likelihood of making the 
lighting purchase decision given the 
purchase event. For example, in 
purchase events driven by new 
construction, DOE assumed lighting 
designers, architects, and electrical 
engineers make 70 percent of the 
decisions, owners make 20 percent, and 
electrical contractors make the 
remaining 10 percent. DOE then 
analyzed the likelihood of each decision 
maker choosing to run a lamp on a 
lower BF ballast if forced by standards 
to purchase a more-efficacious lamp. 
DOE described that likelihood with a 
probability that was based on the 
technical expertise and motivation of 
the decision maker. Within each 
purchase event, DOE multiplied the 
likelihood of each market actor making 
the decision by the likelihood of that 
actor choosing a lower-BF ballast. In 
this way, DOE derived an estimate for 
the likelihood of a lower-BF ballast 
being selected for each event in each 
sector in the standards case. 
DOE assumed the commercial and 
industrial sectors behave similarly with 
respect to ballast factor choices, and no 
distinction was made between them in 
this analysis. Additionally, decision 
makers in the large-commercial sector 
can be different agents making different

16968 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 69 / Monday, April 13, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
decisions than those in the small- 
commercial sector. In the market 
segments (purchase events) where DOE 
found consumer behavior to be 
substantially different between these 
subsectors, DOE weighted the relative 
impact of each subsector when 
characterizing the overall commercial 
market. Table V.6 presents the results of 
DOE’s analysis for the commercial and 
residential sectors. The values depict 
the probability that lamps purchased in 
each event will be matched with lower- 
ballast-factor ballasts, if necessary, to 
maintain lumen output. For example, 78 
percent of lamps purchased in new 
construction in the commercial sector 
will be paired with lower-ballast-factor 
ballasts, if no reduced-wattage lamps are 
available in the standards case,

Ballast Replacement ................................................................................................................................................ 8 0 
Fixture Replacement ................................................................................................................................................ 34 0 
In light of NEMA’s comments and 
DOE’s analysis, DOE used these results 
to add a second set of standards-case 
scenarios to characterize ballast factor 
migration in the GSFL NIA. DOE now 
also analyzes a High Lighting Expertise 
scenario and a Market Segment-Based 
Lighting Expertise scenario. These 
scenarios characterize consumers’ 
decisions (or lack thereof) when 
purchasing a more-efficient lamp to 
either maintain previous lumen output 
or accept higher lighting levels. For its 
part, the High Lighting Expertise 
scenario uses the same methodology as 
DOE used in the ANOPR. The High 
Lighting Expertise scenario generally 
characterizes more sophisticated 
lighting decisions in which consistent 
lighting levels and/or energy savings 
play a determining role in consumer 
behavior. In this scenario, consumers 
are more likely to choose a lower- 
ballast-factor ballast to pair with higher- 
efficacy lamps. Conversely, in the 
Market Segment-Based scenario, DOE 
assumed consumers often accept higher 
lighting levels as a consequence of 
higher-efficacy lamps. As a 
consequence, these consumers do not 
achieve the same energy savings as 
would be possible by migrating to 
lower-ballast-factor ballasts. DOE used 
this analysis, and the results shown in 
Table V.6, to characterize the Market 
Segment-Based expertise scenario. On 
the other hand, in the High Lighting 
Expertise scenario, DOE assumes all 
consumers (100 percent) migrate to 
lower-ballast-factor ballasts when 
appropriate. Please see TSD appendix 
10B for more details. 
c. Voluntary Retrofits 
In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE 
assumed that more-stringent efficacy 
standards would lead to higher T12 
lamp prices, and, in turn, higher rates of 
voluntary retrofits from T12 to more- 
efficacious T8 lamps. For example, DOE 
assumed that CSL1 would drive an 
additional 10 percent of the T12 market 
to voluntarily migrate to T8 lamps, that 
CSL2 would drive an additional 20 
percent, that CSL3 would drive an 
additional 30 percent, and so on. These 
commercial standards-induced retrofits 
involve consumers voluntarily 
discarding their functioning T12 
ballasts, and purchasing new T8 ballasts 
in the standards case. In contrast, in the 
base case, these consumers would have 
utilized the entirety of their T12 ballast 
lifetime. 
At the public meeting, ACEEE agreed 
with DOE’s assumption that standards 
will accelerate voluntary retrofits, but 
argued that DOE’s retrofit rate was too 
aggressive. ACEEE specifically stated 
that the 50-percent retrofit rate per year 
at CSL5 was too high and suggested a 
rate of roughly half that level. (Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at p. 282) GE 
agreed that DOE’s retrofit rates were too 
high, suggesting that 10 percent at CSL1 
is an appropriate starting point, but 25 
percent should probably be the 
maximum assumed retrofit rate at CSL5. 
Using those rates as the minimum and 
maximum, GE said DOE could scale the 
rate for the other CSLs. (Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 282–283) In its 
written comments, NEMA similarly 
stated that DOE’s conversion rate for 
consumers voluntarily retrofitting from 
T12 to T8 systems is likely overstated. 
NEMA suggested that DOE should use a 
voluntary retrofit rate of 20 to 25 
percent for CSL5 and recommended that 
other rates be adjusted based on that 
percentage. (NEMA, No. 22 at p. 28) 
At the public meeting, Philips also 
commented that it would expect 
utilities to be more aggressive with their 
rebate programs in the standards case 
than they would be in the base case. 
PG&E stated that voluntary retrofits are 
driven by many factors, including 
attention to global climate change, 
increased product availability, and other 
factors, not necessarily utility rebate 
programs. (Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 21 at pp. 273–275) 
DOE considered these comments and 
maintains that these standards-induced 
retrofits are a likely phenomenon and 
important to model in the NIA. DOE 
agrees that its initial retrofit 
assumptions were likely too high, 
particularly for the higher efficacy 
levels. For the NOPR, consistent with 
comments received, in the commercial 
sector DOE continued to assume that 
EL1 would drive an additional 10 
percent of the T12 market per year to 
voluntary retrofit to T8 lamps. DOE also 
assumed a 25-percent retrofit rate at EL4 
and EL5, levels at which all T12 lamps 
are effectively eliminated from the 
market. For TSL1, TSL2, and TSL3, DOE 
changed the standards-induced retrofit 
rates to 10 percent, 15 percent, and 20 
percent, respectively. 
Similar to DOE’s approach in the 
commercial sector, DOE also included 
increased migration of residential 
consumers from 4-foot medium bipin 
T12 systems to T8 systems. As 
discussed in chapter 10 of TSD, DOE 
assumed in the base case that residential 
consumers replacing their T12 fixture 
(either due to fixture failure or ballast 
failure) would purchase another T12 
system. In contrast, in the commercial 
sector, DOE assumes 90 percent of 4- 
foot MBP consumer replace their T12 
ballasts with T8 ballast upon fixture or 
ballast failure in the base case. In 
addition, while in the commercial sector 
DOE assumed, under amended energy 
conservation standards, some 
consumers would retrofit their working 
T12 ballast systems before end of ballast 
life, DOE assumed residential
