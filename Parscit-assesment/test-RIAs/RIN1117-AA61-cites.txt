The rule as proposed could reduce the number of cases and, therefore, reduce the costs to governments at all levels. A reduction in forgeries would also benefit practitioners who would be less likely to be at risk of being accused of diverting controlled substances and of then having to prove that they were not responsible. 42 Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2003: Area Profiles of Drug-Related Mortality, SAMHSA March 2005. 43 The DAWN Report – Emergency Department Visits Involving Non-medical Use of Selected Pharmaceuticals.

April 2008 42 Creating an electronic prescription takes more time than writing a paper prescription and handing it to a patient. The electronic prescription system shifts some responsibility from the pharmacy to the practitioners. At present, it is the pharmacy that checks to see if a particular drug is covered by the patient’s insurance and that checks for drug interactions by examining other medications the patient is taking. With electronic prescriptions, all of these checks may occur before the practitioner signs the prescription. While this process may significantly reduce pr</context>

To estimate the part of these benefits that may accrue to the proposed rule, DEA estimated the number of controlled substance prescriptions that may require callbacks. Although there are widely varying estimates for callbacks, the best available data, based on the operation of the two largest mail order prescription pharmacies, support an estimate of 30 percent of original prescriptions.32 DrugTopics.com surveys of pharmacists in 199633 and 199934 indicated th</context>
