1.0 Intended Use of this Document 
This report has been prepared for explicit use during the comment period for the “45 CFR Part 
162 Health Insurance Reform; Modifications to the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) Electronic Transaction Standards; Proposed Rule” published to the 
Federal Register/Vol. 73 No. 164 on Friday, August 22nd, 2008.  The information provided in this 
report is intended only to supplement the proposed rule and provide additional clarity regarding 
the Version 5010 Impact Analysis.  This report also does not include any of the analysis 
pertaining to Version D.0 (pharmacy) or Version 3.0 (Medicaid subrogation), as those analyses 
were conducted separately. This report is for instructive purposes only to help provide additional 
context and explanation for the calculations set forth in the proposed rule.  The content of this 
report is not meant for comment. Any comments that might stem from this document should be 
directed to the specific section and language provided in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 
(NPRM) and should be provided through the designated channel.

2.0 Cost Benefit Analysis Methodology 
In preparing the 5010 Regulatory Impact Analysis, a detailed Cost-Benefit study was conducted 
to examine the impact of this change across the industry.  As part of this endeavor, a 
methodology was developed to identify the individual segments across the full spectrum of 
health care and to evaluate each segment from a cost-benefit perspective.    
The segments and sub segments that were identified included: 
Table 1. Healthcare Segments 
Segments Sub Segments 
Providers 
• Hospitals 
• Physicians 
• Dentists 
• Pharmacies 
Health Plans 
• Health Plans  
• Government Plans and 
Programs 
Clearinghouses and 
Vendors 
• Clearinghouses 
• Vendors 
 
Based on this segmentation strategy, select individuals with representative perspectives from 
each of these segments were identified and interviewed.  These individuals represented both 
the business and technical areas for their respective organizations and were capable of 
articulating the potential cost-benefit of changes to their existing systems and processes.  In 
addition to these interviews, secondary research was conducted to better assess the current 
usage and industry patterns for each of the HIPAA transactions and to complement data 
brought forth through the primary research.  This secondary research included data collection 
from leading associations and other constituencies that represented one or more of the 
segments identified (e.g. MGMA, HIMSS, BCBSA, etc.).  Throughout this process, sources were 
cited and assumptions were tested and verified where possible.   
All of the input from this research was used to construct a Cost-Benefit model that synthesized 
the findings from the interviews as well as the inputs from the secondary research.  This model 
was constructed in order to estimate the net impact of 5010 across the entire health care 
spectrum inclusive of all of the individual segments.  Quality Assurance reviews were conducted 
throughout the process and multiple iterations of the model were reviewed before the final 
product was baselined.  The Quality Assurance process included multiple stages of validation, 
sensitivity testing, and peer review with Internal and External Subject Matter Experts.  Figure 1 
below depicts the process by which this cost-benefit model was constructed.

The result of this cost-benefit analysis and the cost-benefit model were then used to help form 
the basis for the Regulatory Impact Analysis section of the proposed rule.  As a result of these 
exhaustive efforts, estimates were arrived at that can reasonably be assumed to be 
representative of the expected impact across the industry. 
The remainder of this document will provide additional context behind the cost-benefit model 
and should be considered a supplement to the proposed rule. 
3.0 Key Assumptions 
The following are the key assumptions used in developing the cost benefit analysis: 
3.1 Model Assumptions 
The cost benefit analysis was developed for a ten (10) year period.  
3.2 Cost Analysis Assumptions 
The majority of costs incurred for the Version 5010 HIPAA regulation are related to System 
Implementation Costs. These costs are assumed to be incurred over a two (2) year period as 
follows: 
• System Implementation costs are distributed evenly between years one (1) and two 
(2) 
• System Implementation costs vary by segment 
• Transition costs begin in year three (3) 
3.3 Benefit Analysis Assumptions 
The benefits are not realized until one year after the implementation compliance date.  The

4.0 Costs Overview 
4.1 Summary 
HIPAA systems implementation costs form the majority of costs associated with the HIPAA 
Version 5010 proposed rule. The following table summarizes the cost categories and an 
estimate of each category as a percentage of total costs incurred. The major cost item is the 
testing costs—these costs on average are estimated to account for 60% to 70% of the total 
costs that will be incurred.

Each interview participant was asked to estimate the costs for Version 5010 implementation on 
their respective organizations. Interview participants were able to provide an estimate based on 
their experience in implementing Version 4010/4010A transactions. Interview participants 
provided a historical estimate on the costs incurred for implementing Version 4010/4010A 
transactions as well as their projections on what percentage of those costs would be incurred to 
upgrade to Version 5010. The slate of interview participants estimated their organizations costs 
to implement 5010 would be between 20% and 40% of the costs they incurred to implement 
Version 4010/4010A in their respective organizations.  
The following table summarizes the total estimated costs to move to Version 5010 across the 
healthcare industry (excluding Clearinghouses) as a result of the proposed rule:

4.2 Cost Analysis Methodology 
4.2.1 Cost Calculations Overview 
The next sections use the following pattern in providing the costs calculations. First the key 
assumptions are stated. Second, the formula that uses the key assumptions is outlined. Finally, 
the results from the calculations are documented in the summary section.  This section 4.2, and 
the following section, 5.2, are explanatory only.  The actual data and formulas are provided in 
Section 6 – the impact analysis by segment.  A list of all of the assumptions provided in these 
methodology sections is provided in Attachment 1 and may be used as a side-by-side guide 
while reviewing section 6.   
4.2.2 Cost Calculations 
The following assumptions are used in the cost calculations: 
Cost Assumption 1: For each Healthcare segment, there was a determination of how many 
entities would be impacted.  For example, The Healthcare providers segment is broken down 
into three sub-segments: 400+ bed, 100-400 beds and < 100 beds. The costs were different for 
each segment and sub-segment.  Costs varied by each sub-segment based on a variety of 
factors such as current configuration of systems, complexity of testing with trading partners, and 
transaction volumes.  
Cost Assumption 2: Developed an estimate of Version 4010/4010A implementation costs 
incurred by each type of healthcare organization or entity in the sub-segment. The estimate is 
based on data gathered from primary research and secondary research. 
Cost Assumption 3: The Version 5010 implementation costs were estimated to be 20% to 40% 
of Version 4010/4010A implementation costs. This range was established by the interviewees 
for each respective sub-segment. 
The costs are calculated for each Healthcare sub segment based on the following formula:  
Costs incurred by each sub segment = Cost Assumption 1 X Cost Assumption 2 X Cost 
Assumption 3 
The costs incurred by each sub-segment are aggregated to develop the total costs incurred by 
the Healthcare industry.  Again, the detailed data for each formula is provided in Section 6, and 
                                                
1 - This total costs does not include the estimates gathered for Clearinghouses.

Attachment 1 includes all of the assumptions, and a reference to the tables to which they 
pertain. 
5.0 Benefits Overview 
5.1 Summary 
A number of benefits were articulated during the interviews.  These benefits were evaluated, 
prioritized and quantified where possible.  The quantifiable benefits fall into three major 
categories and are discussed at length in the proposed rule.  They include: 
I. Operational savings due to better standards for claims transactions: The deficiencies in 
Version 4010/4010A specifications have caused much of the industry to rely on 
“companion guides” created by health plans to address areas of Version 4010/4010A 
that are not specific enough or require work-around solutions to address business 
needs. These companion guides are unique, plan-specific implementation instructions 
for the situational use of certain fields and/or data elements that are needed to support 
current business operations. Increased standardization will reduce the reliance on 
“companion guides” and potentially increase automation of claims transactions 
processing increasing the operational savings for healthcare industry.  
II. Cost savings due to an increase in EDI for claims transactions by more covered entities: 
Providers and Clearinghouses/Vendors maintain multiple connections (a connection 
represents a specific implementation specific to Health plan) for claims processing. 
Increased standardization potentially reduces the incremental costs to implement 
additional connections increasing the uptake in EDI transactions. The table below 
reflects the estimated current and projected adoption rates for each of the HIPAA 
standards. We assumed that acceptance rates would gradually increase in the first 5 
years after implementation, through 2016, and after that time the rates would remain 
level.

HIPAA standards across all covered entities-over 10 years

276/277-claims status request &

834-enrollment/disenrollment 3% 0% 0% 
820-premium 2% 0% 0% 
** minimal use – while there is not zero percent uptake, the use of this transaction is so 
minimal, it does not register on any scale;  therefore, we state its current acceptance 
rate as negligible.

III. Operational savings due to increased use of auxiliary (non-claims transactions such as 
eligibility and referral requests and responses) transactions through EDI: Better 
standardization for the auxiliary transactions will increase uptake in Electronic EDI for 
these transactions increasing the operational benefits

5.2 Benefit Analysis Methodology 
5.2.1 Benefit Calculations Overview 
The next sections use the following pattern in providing the benefits calculations. First the key 
assumptions are stated. Second, the formula that uses the key assumptions is outlined. Finally, 
the results from the calculations are documented in summary section.  Attachment 1 is a list of 
all of the assumptions, and a reference to the tables to which they pertain within this document.   
5.2.2 Operational savings due to better standards for claims transactions 
The following assumptions are used in the calculations: 
CMS 5010 Regulatory Impact Analysis Supplement  
 
 
 
 
Page 8 
Benefit Assumption 1: Based on the data provided in a recent AHIP report2 the percentage of 
pended claims was assumed to be 14% of total claims.  
Benefit Assumption 2: Pended claims will be reduced by 0.28% (minimum) to 0.7% 
(maximum). Using the research and interviews, it was assumed that the pended claim 
percentage, currently 14% (Benefit Assumption 1), would be reduced through standardization.  
Benefit Assumption 3: Reduced manual intervention will reduce the costs for providers by 
$3.20 per call and for plans by $1.60 per call. Manual intervention is required to resolve pended 
claims and both Healthcare providers and Health Plans incur these operational costs. On an 
average, the following was assumed as the time spent and cost per minute and per call by the 
customer service representatives to resolve the pended claims: 
 
Table 6. Time incurred to resolve Pended Claims 
 Time 
Cost Per 
Minute 
Cost Per 
Call 
Time taken by a provider agent to process 
manual intervention for a pended claim 10 minutes $0.32 $3.20 
Time taken by a plan claims processor to 
process manual intervention for a pended 
claim 
5 minutes $0.32 $1.60 
 
Benefit Assumption 4:  Based on the AHIP report3 assumed the percentage of non auto-
adjudicated claims is 29% of total claims.  
Benefit Assumption 5: Non auto-adjudicated claims will be reduced by 1.45% (minimum) to 
2.9% (maximum). Using the research and interviews, it was assumed that the non auto-
adjudicated claims, currently 29% (Benefit Assumption 4), would be reduced through 
standardization. 
Benefit Assumption 6: Reduced manual intervention will reduce the costs for providers by 
$2.88 per call and for plans by $2.40 per call. Manual intervention is required to resolve the non 
auto-adjudicated claims—Healthcare providers and Health Plans both incur these operational 
costs. On an average, the following was assumed as the time spent and cost per minute and 
per call by the by customer service representatives to resolve the Non Auto-Adjudicated claims: 
Table 7. Time incurred to resolve Non Auto-Adjudicated Claims 
 Time

The Operational savings due to better standards are calculated based on the following formula:  
Benefits =Σ (Benefit Assumption 2 X Benefit Assumption 3 X Total claim transactions for each 
year) + Σ  (Benefit Assumption 5 X Benefit Assumption 6 X Total claim transactions for each 
year) 
5.2.3 Cost savings due to an increase in EDI for claims transactions by more 
covered entities 
The following assumptions are used in the calculations: 
Benefit Assumption 7: Cost savings for Healthcare Provider segment is $0.55 and cost 
savings for Health Plan is $0.18. According to AHIP report1 the cost savings from using an 
electronic transaction versus using paper transaction is $0.73.  This estimate is used as the 
basis for cost savings due to increase in EDI for claims transactions and $0.55 cost savings is 
allocated for Healthcare Provider and $0.18 cost savings is allocated for Health Plan 
Benefit Assumption 8: The uptake of the electronic claim transactions based on proposed rule 
is assumed between 2% (minimum) and 5% (maximum) 
The cost savings due to an increase in EDI are calculated based on the following formula:  
Benefits = Σ (Benefit Assumption 7 X Benefit Assumption 8 X Total claim transactions for each 
year) 
5.2.4 Operational savings due to increased use of auxiliary transactions 
through EDI 
The following assumptions are used in the calculations: 
Benefit Assumption 9: The following uptake of auxiliary electronic claim transactions is 
assumed: 
• 278 (Referral request & response) between 10% (minimum) and 20% (maximum) 
• 276/277 (Claims status request & response) between 10% (minimum) and 20% (maximum) 
• 270/271 (Eligibility request and response) between 10% (minimum) and 20% (maximum) 
Benefit Assumption 10: Reduced manual intervention will reduce the costs for providers and 
plans by the amounts noted below for calls required to get additional information to support 
claim processing.  On average, the following is the time spent by customer service 
representatives to get additional information:

Hospital Size 
Costs (in 
Millions) 
400+ Bed $1.900 
100-400 Bed $0.950 
Fewer than 100 Bed $0.475 
 
Cost Assumption 3: The costs incurred for system implementations for Version 5010 is 20% to 
40% of the total costs of implementing Version 4010/4010A. 
The costs incurred by this Healthcare segment can be computed using the formula: Cost 
Assumption 1 X Cost Assumption 2 X Cost Assumption 3.   
For example, in the case of the sub-segment of 400+ bed hospitals the calculation was derived 
by multiplying 521 X 1.9 X .20 to calculate the low end of the cost range for this segment as 
$198 million.  The high end of the cost range would be calculated the same way with the 
exception that Cost Assumption 3 would use the 40%, or .4, as the multiplier resulting in a total 
of $396 million in estimated costs.  
6.2.2 Benefit Calculations Overview 
6.2.2.1 Operational savings due to better standards for claims transactions 
Benefit Assumption 11: The following table outlines the total transactions by year.  This 
information can be found in Table 2 on page 49762 in the proposed rule.

Source:  Claims Attachments Regulation: Federal Register 45 CFR Part 162, Published: September 23, 
2005. The claims are extrapolated to increase by 4% per year 
Note: The benefits are not realized until post implementation and hence benefits for years 2010 and 2011 
are not calculated 
 
Benefits = Σ (Benefit Assumption 2 X Benefit Assumption 3 X Benefit Assumption 11) + Σ 
(Benefit Assumption 5 X Benefit Assumption 6 X Benefit Assumption 11). 
Please note, to use these formulas, several iterations of the calculations will have to be made in 
order to calculate the year by year cost or benefit, and then to sum those figures together for a 
total ten year cost benefit picture.

traditional hospitals such as Long Term Care facilities.

6.2.2.2 Cost savings due to an increase in EDI for claims transactions by more 
covered entities 
Benefits = Σ (Benefit Assumption 7 X Benefit Assumption 8 X Benefit Assumption 11)  
For the purpose of providing an example of the benefits calculation, this could be calculated by 
multiplying $0.55 (Assumed cost reduction for use of EDI for claims transactions) X 2% 
(minimum uptake in % of electronic claims) X 861 million (estimated minimum number of claims 
for segment in 2012).  This same logic could be carried through for each subsequent year 
based on the estimated claims for those years.  Also, the maximum could be calculated both by 
using the high end of the uptake % as well as the maximum number of claims by year. 
6.2.2.3 Operational savings due to increased use of auxiliary transactions 
through EDI 
Benefits = Σ  (Benefit Assumption 9 X Benefit Assumption 10 X Benefit Assumption 11)

6.5 Pharmacy  
6.5.1 Overview 
As stated in the proposed rule on page 49770, Pharmacies are using two of the Version 
4010/4010A standards, but largely use Version 5.1 for their EDI transactions.  We are proposing 
to adopt Version D.0, which will directly affect the pharmacy sector.  The impact analysis for 
pharmacies is included in the D.0 portion of the proposed rule so we did not provide analytical 
information in the Version 5010 section, and therefore do not provide any additional 
assumptions here.

Attachment 1 – Listing of Assumptions  
 
Cost Assumptions 
 
Cost Assumption 1:  For each Healthcare segment, there was a determination of how many 
entities would be impacted.  For example, The Healthcare providers segment is broken down 
into three sub-segments: 400+ bed, 100-400 beds and < 100 beds. The costs were different for 
each segment and sub-segment.  Costs varied by each sub-segment based on a variety of 
different factors such as current configuration of systems, complexity of testing with trading 
partners, and transaction volumes.  
Cost Assumption 2:  Developed an estimate of Version 4010/4010A implementation costs 
incurred by each Healthcare entity in the sub-segment. The estimate is based on data gathered 
from primary research and secondary research. 
Cost Assumption 3:  The Version 5010 implementation costs were estimated to be 20% to 40% 
of Version 4010/4010A implementation costs. This range was established by the interviewees 
for each respective sub-segment. 
Cost Assumption 4:  Table 29 outlines average costs incurred by Medicare to implement the 
5010 proposed rule. The estimate is based on data gathered from primary research.  
Cost Assumption 5:  Table 30 outlines average costs incurred by Other Government Programs 
(DoD, VA etc.) to implement the 5010 proposed rule. The estimate is based on data gathered 
from primary research and secondary research. 
Cost Assumption 6:  Table 32 outlines total costs incurred by clearinghouses for implementing 
Version 4010/4010A.  
 
Benefit Assumptions 
 
Benefit Assumption 1:  Based on the data provided in a recent AHIP report5 the percentage of 
pended claims was assumed to be 14% of total claims.  
Benefit Assumption 2:  Pended claims will be reduced by 0.28% (minimum) to 0.7% (maximum). 
Using the research and interviews, it was assumed that the pended claim percentage, currently 
14% (Benefit Assumption 1), would be reduced through standardization.  
Benefit Assumption 3:  As illustrated in Table 6, it is assumed that the cost for manual 
intervention will be reduced for providers and for plans by the designated amounts per call. 
Manual intervention is required to resolve pended claims and both Healthcare providers and 
Health Plans incur these operational costs. 
Benefit Assumption 4:  Based on the AHIP report assumed the percentage of non auto-
adjudicated claims is 29% of total claims.  
                                                
5 AHIP Report: An Updated Survey of Health Care Claims Receipt and Processing Times, May 2006 is 
available at http://www.ahipresearch.org/pdfs/PromptPayFinalDraft.pdf

Benefit Assumption 5:  Non auto-adjudicated claims will be reduced by 1.45% (minimum) to 
2.9% (maximum). Using the research and interviews, it was assumed that the non auto-
adjudicated claims, currently 29% (Benefit Assumption 4), would be reduced through 
standardization. 
Benefit Assumption 6:  As illustrated in Table 7, it is assumed that the cost for manual 
intervention will be reduced for providers and for plans by the designated amounts per call.  
Manual intervention is required to resolve the non auto-adjudicated claims—Healthcare 
providers and Health Plans both incur these operational costs.  
Benefit Assumption 7:  Cost savings for Healthcare Provider segment is $0.55 and cost savings 
for Health Plan is $0.18. According to AHIP report1 the cost savings from using an electronic 
transaction versus using paper transaction is $0.73.  This estimate is used as the basis for cost 
savings due to increase in EDI for claims transactions and $0.55 cost savings is allocated for 
Healthcare Provider and $0.18 cost savings is allocated for Health Plan 
Benefit Assumption 8:  The uptake of the electronic claim transactions based on proposed rule 
is assumed between 2% (minimum) and 5% (maximum). 
Benefit Assumption 9:  The following uptake of auxiliary electronic claim transactions is 
assumed: 
• 278 (Referral request & response) between 10% (minimum) and 20% (maximum) 
• 276/277 (Claims status request & response) between 10% (minimum) and 20% 
(maximum) 
• 270/271 (Eligibility request and response) between 10% (minimum) and 20% 
(maximum) 
Benefit Assumption 10:  As illustrated in Tables 8 and 9, it is assumed that the cost for manual 
intervention related to supporting claim processing will be reduced for providers and for plans by 
the designated amounts per call 
Benefit Assumption 11:  Table 12 outlines the total estimated claims by year for Hospitals.   
Benefit Assumption 12:  Table 16 outlines the total estimated claims by year for Physicians.   
Benefit Assumption 13:  Table 20 outlines the total estimated claims by year for Dentists. 
Benefit Assumption 14:  Table 24 outlines the total estimated claims by year for Institutions, 
Physicians, & Dentists. 
Benefit Assumption 15:  Table 25 outlines the benefit allocation for Private and Government 
Health Plans based on the % claims handled by each sub-segment.
