AGENCY: Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS), HHS. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: We are proposing to revise the 
Medicare hospital inpatient prospective 
payment systems (IPPS) for operating 
and capital-related costs to implement 
changes arising from our continuing 
experience with these systems, and to 
implement certain provisions made by 
the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the 
Medicare Improvements and Extension 
Act, Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief 
and Health Care Act of 2006, and the 
TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI 
Programs Extension Act of 2007. In 
addition, in the Addendum to this 
proposed rule, we describe the proposed 
changes to the amounts and factors used 
to determine the rates for Medicare 
hospital inpatient services for operating 
costs and capital-related costs. These 
proposed changes would be applicable 
to discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 2008. We also are setting 
forth the proposed update to the rate-of- 
increase limits for certain hospitals and 
hospital units excluded from the IPPS 
that are paid on a reasonable cost basis 
subject to these limits. The proposed 
updated rate-of-increase limits would be 
effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2008. 
Among the other policy decisions and 
changes that we are proposing to make 
are changes related to: Limited proposed 
revisions of the classification of cases to 
Medicare severity diagnosis-related 
groups (MS–DRGs), proposals to address 
charge compression issues in the 
calculation of MS–DRG relative weights, 
the proposed revisions to the 
classifications and relative weights for 
the Medicare severity long-term care 
diagnosis-related groups (MS–LTC– 
DRGs); applications for new medical 
services and technologies add-on 
payments; wage index reform changes 
and the wage data, including the 
occupational mix data, used to compute 
the proposed FY 2009 wage indices; 
submission of hospital quality data; 
proposed changes to the postacute care 
transfer policy relating to transfers to 
home for the furnishing of home health 
services; and proposed policy changes 
relating to the requirements for 
furnishing hospital emergency services 
under the Emergency Medical 
Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 
(EMTALA). 
In addition, we are proposing policy 
changes relating to disclosure to 
patients of physician ownership or 
investment interests in hospitals and 
soliciting public comments on a 
proposed collection of information 
regarding financial relationships 
between hospitals and physicians. We 
are also proposing changes or soliciting 
comments on issues relating to policies 
on physician self-referrals.

I. Background 
A. Summary 
1. Acute Care Hospital Inpatient 
Prospective Payment System (IPPS) 
Section 1886(d) of the Social Security 
Act (the Act) sets forth a system of 
payment for the operating costs of acute 
care hospital inpatient stays under 
Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) 
based on prospectively set rates. Section 
1886(g) of the Act requires the Secretary 
to pay for the capital-related costs of 
hospital inpatient stays under a 
prospective payment system (PPS). 
Under these PPSs, Medicare payment 
for hospital inpatient operating and 
capital-related costs is made at 
predetermined, specific rates for each 
hospital discharge. Discharges are 
classified according to a list of 
diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). 
The base payment rate is comprised of 
a standardized amount that is divided 
into a labor-related share and a 
nonlabor-related share. The labor- 
related share is adjusted by the wage 
index applicable to the area where the 
hospital is located. If the hospital is 
located in Alaska or Hawaii, the 
nonlabor-related share is adjusted by a 
cost-of-living adjustment factor. This 
base payment rate is multiplied by the 
DRG relative weight. 
If the hospital treats a high percentage 
of low-income patients, it receives a 
percentage add-on payment applied to 
the DRG-adjusted base payment rate. 
This add-on payment, known as the 
disproportionate share hospital (DSH) 
adjustment, provides for a percentage 
increase in Medicare payments to 
hospitals that qualify under either of 
two statutory formulas designed to 
identify hospitals that serve a 
disproportionate share of low-income 
patients. For qualifying hospitals, the 
amount of this adjustment may vary 
based on the outcome of the statutory 
calculations. 
If the hospital is an approved teaching 
hospital, it receives a percentage add-on 
payment for each case paid under the 
IPPS, known as the indirect medical 
education (IME) adjustment. This 
percentage varies, depending on the 
ratio of residents to beds. 
Additional payments may be made for 
cases that involve new technologies or 
medical services that have been 
approved for special add-on payments. 
To qualify, a new technology or medical 
service must demonstrate that it is a 
substantial clinical improvement over 
technologies or services otherwise 
available, and that, absent an add-on

payment, it would be inadequately paid 
under the regular DRG payment. 
The costs incurred by the hospital for 
a case are evaluated to determine 
whether the hospital is eligible for an 
additional payment as an outlier case. 
This additional payment is designed to 
protect the hospital from large financial 
losses due to unusually expensive cases. 
Any outlier payment due is added to the 
DRG-adjusted base payment rate, plus 
any DSH, IME, and new technology or 
medical service add-on adjustments. 
Although payments to most hospitals 
under the IPPS are made on the basis of 
the standardized amounts, some 
categories of hospitals are paid in whole 
or in part based on their hospital- 
specific rate based on their costs in a 
base year. For example, sole community 
hospitals (SCHs) receive the higher of a 
hospital-specific rate based on their 
costs in a base year (the higher of FY 
1982, FY 1987, or FY 1996) or the IPPS 
rate based on the standardized amount. 
Until FY 2007, a Medicare-dependent, 
small rural hospital (MDH) has received 
the IPPS rate plus 50 percent of the 
difference between the IPPS rate and its 
hospital-specific rate if the hospital- 
specific rate based on their costs in a 
base year (the higher of FY 1982, FY 
1987, or FY 2002) is higher than the 
IPPS rate. As discussed below, for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2007, but before October 1, 2011, an 
MDH will receive the IPPS rate plus 75 
percent of the difference between the 
IPPS rate and its hospital-specific rate, 
if the hospital-specific rate is higher 
than the IPPS rate. SCHs are the sole 
source of care in their areas, and MDHs 
are a major source of care for Medicare 
beneficiaries in their areas. Both of these 
categories of hospitals are afforded this 
special payment protection in order to 
maintain access to services for 
beneficiaries. 
Section 1886(g) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to pay for the capital-related 
costs of inpatient hospital services ‘‘in 
accordance with a prospective payment 
system established by the Secretary.’’ 
The basic methodology for determining 
capital prospective payments is set forth 
in our regulations at 42 CFR 412.308 
and 412.312. Under the capital IPPS, 
payments are adjusted by the same DRG 
for the case as they are under the 
operating IPPS. Capital IPPS payments 
are also adjusted for IME and DSH, 
similar to the adjustments made under 
the operating IPPS. However, as 
discussed in section V.B.2. of this 
preamble, we are phasing out the IME 
adjustment beginning with FY 2008. In 
addition, hospitals may receive outlier 
payments for those cases that have 
unusually high costs. 
The existing regulations governing 
payments to hospitals under the IPPS 
are located in 42 CFR Part 412, Subparts 
A through M. 
2. Hospitals and Hospital Units 
Excluded From the IPPS 
Under section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the 
Act, as amended, certain specialty 
hospitals and hospital units are 
excluded from the IPPS. These hospitals 
and units are: Rehabilitation hospitals 
and units; long-term care hospitals 
(LTCHs); psychiatric hospitals and 
units; children’s hospitals; and cancer 
hospitals. Religious nonmedical health 
care institutions (RNHCIs) are also 
excluded from the IPPS. Various 
sections of the Balanced Budget Act of 
1997 (Pub. L. 105–33), the Medicare, 
Medicaid and SCHIP [State Children’s 
Health Insurance Program] Balanced 
Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 
106–113), and the Medicare, Medicaid, 
and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and 
Protection Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106–554) 
provide for the implementation of PPSs 
for rehabilitation hospitals and units 
(referred to as inpatient rehabilitation 
facilities (IRFs)), LTCHs, and psychiatric 
hospitals and units (referred to as 
inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs)), as 
discussed below. Children’s hospitals, 
cancer hospitals, and RNHCIs continue 
to be paid solely under a reasonable 
cost-based system. 
The existing regulations governing 
payments to excluded hospitals and 
hospital units are located in 42 CFR 
Parts 412 and 413. 
a. Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities 
(IRFs) 
Under section 1886(j) of the Act, as 
amended, rehabilitation hospitals and 
units (IRFs) have been transitioned from 
payment based on a blend of reasonable 
cost reimbursement subject to a 
hospital-specific annual limit under 
section 1886(b) of the Act and the 
adjusted facility Federal prospective 
payment rate for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2002 
through September 30, 2002, to payment 
at 100 percent of the Federal rate 
effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002. 
IRFs subject to the blend were also 
permitted to elect payment based on 100 
percent of the Federal rate. The existing 
regulations governing payments under 
the IRF PPS are located in 42 CFR Part 
412, Subpart P. 
b. Long-Term Care Hospitals (LTCHs) 
Under the authority of sections 123(a) 
and (c) of Pub. L. 106–113 and section 
307(b)(1) of Pub. L. 106–554, the LTCH 
PPS was effective for a LTCH’s first cost 
reporting period beginning on or after 
October 1, 2002. LTCHs that do not 
meet the definition of ‘‘new’’ under 
§ 412.23(e)(4) are paid, during a 5-year 
transition period, a LTCH prospective 
payment that is comprised of an 
increasing proportion of the LTCH 
Federal rate and a decreasing proportion 
based on reasonable cost principles. 
Those LTCHs that did not meet the 
definition of ‘‘new’’ under § 412.23(e)(4) 
could elect to be paid based on 100 
percent of the Federal prospective 
payment rate instead of a blended 
payment in any year during the 5-year 
transition. For cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2006, 
all LTCHs are paid 100 percent of the 
Federal rate. The existing regulations 
governing payment under the LTCH PPS 
are located in 42 CFR Part 412, Subpart 
O. 
c. Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPFs) 
Under the authority of sections 124(a) 
and (c) of Pub. L. 106–113, inpatient 
psychiatric facilities (IPFs) (formerly 
psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric 
units of acute care hospitals) are paid 
under the IPF PPS. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2008, all IPFs are paid 100 percent of 
the Federal per diem payment amount 
established under the IPF PPS. (For cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2005, and ending on or before 
December 31, 2007, some IPFs received 
transitioned payments for inpatient 
hospital services based on a blend of 
reasonable cost-based payment and a 
Federal per diem payment rate.) The 
existing regulations governing payment 
under the IPF PPS are located in 42 CFR 
part 412, Subpart N. 
3. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) 
Under sections 1814, 1820, and 
1834(g) of the Act, payments are made 
to critical access hospitals (CAHs) (that 
is, rural hospitals or facilities that meet 
certain statutory requirements) for 
inpatient and outpatient services are 
based on 101 percent of reasonable cost. 
Reasonable cost is determined under the 
provisions of section 1861(v)(1)(A) of 
the Act and existing regulations under 
42 CFR Parts 413 and 415. 
4. Payments for Graduate Medical 
Education (GME) 
Under section 1886(a)(4) of the Act, 
costs of approved educational activities 
are excluded from the operating costs of 
inpatient hospital services. Hospitals 
with approved graduate medical 
education (GME) programs are paid for 
the direct costs of GME in accordance 
with section 1886(h) of the Act. The 
amount of payment for direct GME costs

for a cost reporting period is based on 
the hospital’s number of residents in 
that period and the hospital’s costs per 
resident in a base year. The existing 
regulations governing payments to the 
various types of hospitals are located in 
42 CFR Part 413. 
B. Provisions of the Deficit Reduction 
Act of 2005 (DRA) 
Section 5001(b) of the Deficit 
Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), Pub. L. 
109–171, requires the Secretary to 
develop a plan to implement, beginning 
with FY 2009, a value-based purchasing 
plan for section 1886(d) hospitals 
defined in the Act. In section IV.C. of 
the preamble of this proposed rule, we 
discuss the report to Congress on the 
Medicare value-based purchasing plan 
and the current testing of the plan. 
C. Provisions of the Medicare 
Improvements and Extension Act Under 
Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and 
Health Care Act of 2006 (MIEA–TRHCA) 
Section 106(b)(2) of the MIEA– 
TRHCA instructs the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services to include in the 
FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule one or 
more proposals to revise the wage index 
adjustment applied under section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act for purposes of 
the IPPS. The Secretary was also 
instructed to consider MedPAC’s 
recommendations on the Medicare wage 
index classification system in 
developing these proposals. In section 
III. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule, we discuss MedPAC’s 
recommendations in a report to 
Congress and present our proposed 
changes to the FY 2009 wage index in 
response to those recommendations. 
D. Provision of the TMA, Abstinence 
Education, and QI Programs Extension 
Act of 2007 
Section 7 of the TMA [Transitional 
Medical Assistance], Abstinence 
Education, and QI [Qualifying 
Individuals] Programs Extension Act of 
2007 (Pub. L. 110–90) provides for a 0.9 
percent prospective documentation and 
coding adjustment in the determination 
of standardized amounts under the IPPS 
(except for MDHs and SCHs) for 
discharges occurring during FY 2009. 
The prospective documentation and 
coding adjustment was established in 
FY 2008 in response to the 
implementation of an MS–DRG system 
under the IPPS that resulted in changes 
in coding and classification that did not 
reflect real changes in case-mix under 
section 1886(d) of the Act. We discuss 
our proposed implementation of this 
provision in section II.D. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule and in 
the Addendum and in Appendix A to 
this proposed rule. 
E. Major Contents of This Proposed Rule 
In this proposed rule, we are setting 
forth proposed changes to the Medicare 
IPPS for operating costs and for capital- 
related costs in FY 2009. We also are 
setting forth proposed changes relating 
to payments for IME costs and payments 
to certain hospitals and units that 
continue to be excluded from the IPPS 
and paid on a reasonable cost basis. In 
addition, we are presenting proposed 
changes relating to disclosure to 
patients of physician ownership and 
investment interests in hospitals, 
proposed changes to our physician self- 
referral regulations, and a solicitation of 
public comments on a proposed 
collection of information regarding 
financial relationships between 
hospitals and physicians. 
The following is a summary of the 
major changes that we are proposing to 
make: 
1. Proposed Changes to MS–DRG 
Classifications and Recalibrations of 
Relative Weights 
In section II. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we are including— 
• Proposed changes to MS–DRG 
reclassifications based on our yearly 
review. 
• Proposed application of the 
documentation and coding adjustment 
to hospital-specific rates resulting from 
implementation of the MS–DRG system. 
• Proposed changes to address the 
RTI reporting recommendations on 
charge compression. 
• Proposed recalibrations of the MS– 
DRG relative weights. 
We also are proposing to refine the 
hospital cost reports so that charges for 
relatively inexpensive medical supplies 
are reported separately from the costs 
and charges for more expensive medical 
devices. This proposal would be applied 
to the determination of both the IPPS 
and the OPPS relative weights as well 
as the calculation of the ambulatory 
surgical center payment rates. 
We are presenting a listing and 
discussion of additional hospital- 
acquired conditions (HACs), including 
infections, that are being proposed to be 
subject to the statutorily required 
quality adjustment in MS–DRG 
payments for FY 2009. 
We are presenting our evaluation and 
analysis of the FY 2009 applicants for 
add-on payments for high-cost new 
medical services and technologies 
(including public input, as directed by 
Pub. L. 108–173, obtained in a town hall 
meeting). 
We are proposing the annual update 
of the MS–LTC–DRG classifications and 
relative weights for use under the LTCH 
PPS for FY 2009. 
2. Proposed Changes to the Hospital 
Wage Index 
In section III. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we are proposing 
revisions to the wage index and the 
annual update of the wage data. Specific 
issues addressed include the following: 
• Proposed wage index reform 
changes in response to 
recommendations made to Congress as a 
result of the wage index study required 
under Pub. L. 109–432. We discuss 
changes related to reclassifications 
criteria, application of budget neutrality 
in reclassifications, and the rural floor 
and imputed floor budget neutrality at 
the State level. 
• Changes to the CBSA designations. 
• The methodology for computing the 
proposed FY 2009 wage index. 
• The proposed FY 2009 wage index 
update, using wage data from cost 
reporting periods that began during FY 
2006. 
• Analysis and implementation of the 
proposed FY 2009 occupational mix 
adjustment to the wage index. 
• Proposed revisions to the wage 
index based on hospital redesignations 
and reclassifications. 
• The proposed adjustment to the 
wage index for FY 2009 based on 
commuting patterns of hospital 
employees who reside in a county and 
work in a different area with a higher 
wage index. 
• The timetable for reviewing and 
verifying the wage data used to compute 
the proposed FY 2009 wage index. 
• The proposed labor-related share 
for the FY 2009 wage index, including 
the labor-related share for Puerto Rico. 
3. Other Decisions and Proposed 
Changes to the IPPS for Operating Costs 
and GME Costs 
In section IV. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we discuss a number of 
the provisions of the regulations in 42 
CFR Parts 412, 413, and 489, including 
the following: 
• Proposed changes to the postacute 
care transfer policy as it relates to 
transfers to home with the provision of 
home health services. 
• The reporting of hospital quality 
data as a condition for receiving the full 
annual payment update increase. 
• Proposed changes in the collection 
of Medicare Advantage (MA) encounter 
data that are used for computing the risk 
payment adjustment made to MA 
organizations. 
• Discussion of the report to Congress 
on the Medicare value-based purchasing

• Discussion of the fifth year of 
implementation of the Rural 
Community Hospital Demonstration 
Program. 
4. Proposed Changes to the IPPS for 
Capital-Related Costs 
In section V. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we discuss the payment 
policy requirements for capital-related 
costs and capital payments to hospitals. 
We acknowledge the public comments 
that we received on the phase-out of the 
capital teaching adjustment included in 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, and again are 
soliciting public comments on this 
phase-out in this proposed rule. 
5. Proposed Changes to the Payment 
Rates for Excluded Hospitals and 
Hospital Units: Rate-of-Increase 
Percentages 
In section VI. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we discuss proposed 
changes to payments to excluded 
hospitals and hospital units, proposed 
changes for determining LTCH CCRs 
under the LTCH PPS, including a 
discussion regarding changing the 
annual payment rate update schedule 
for the LTCH PPS, and proposed 
changes to the regulations on hospitals- 
within-hospitals. 
6. Proposed Changes Relating to 
Disclosure of Physician Ownership in 
Hospitals 
In section VII. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we present proposed 
changes to the regulations relating to the 
disclosure to patients of physician 
ownership or investment interests in 
hospitals. 
7. Proposed Changes and Solicitation of 
Comments on Physician Self-Referrals 
Provisions 
In section VIII. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we present proposed 
changes to the policies on physician 
self-referrals relating to the ‘‘Stand in 
Shoes’’ provision, In addition, we solicit 
public comments regarding physician- 
owned implant companies and 
gainsharing arrangements. 
8. Proposed Collection of Information 
Regarding Financial Relationships 
Between Hospitals and Physicians 
In section IX. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we solicit public 
comments on our proposed collection of 
information regarding financial 
relationships between hospitals and 
physicians. 
9. Determining Proposed Prospective 
Payment Operating and Capital Rates 
and Rate-of-Increase Limits 
In the Addendum to this proposed 
rule, we set forth proposed changes to 
the amounts and factors for determining 
the FY 2009 prospective payment rates 
for operating costs and capital-related 
costs. We also establish the proposed 
threshold amounts for outlier cases. In 
addition, we address the proposed 
update factors for determining the rate- 
of-increase limits for cost reporting 
periods beginning in FY 2009 for 
hospitals and hospital units excluded 
from the PPS. 
10. Impact Analysis 
In Appendix A of this proposed rule, 
we set forth an analysis of the impact 
that the proposed changes would have 
on affected hospitals. 
11. Recommendation of Update Factors 
for Operating Cost Rates of Payment for 
Inpatient Hospital Services 
In Appendix B of this proposed rule, 
as required by sections 1886(e)(4) and 
(e)(5) of the Act, we provided our 
recommendations of the appropriate 
percentage changes for FY 2009 for the 
following: 
• A single average standardized 
amount for all areas for hospital 
inpatient services paid under the IPPS 
for operating costs (and hospital-specific 
rates applicable to SCHs and MDHs). 
• Target rate-of-increase limits to the 
allowable operating costs of hospital 
inpatient services furnished by hospitals 
and hospital units excluded from the 
IPPS. 
12. Disclosure of Financial 
Relationships Report (DFRR) Form 
In Appendix C of this proposed rule, 
we present the reporting form that we 
are proposing to use for the proposed 
collection of information on financial 
relationships between hospitals and 
physicians discussed in section IX, of 
the preamble of this proposed rule. 
13. Discussion of Medicare Payment 
Advisory Commission 
Recommendations 
Under section 1805(b) of the Act, 
MedPAC is required to submit a report 
to Congress, no later than March 1 of 
each year, in which MedPAC reviews 
and makes recommendations on 
Medicare payment policies. MedPAC’s 
March 2008 recommendations 
concerning hospital inpatient payment 
policies address the update factor for 
inpatient hospital operating costs and 
capital-related costs under the IPPS and 
for hospitals and distinct part hospital 
units excluded from the IPPS. We 
address these recommendations in 
Appendix B of this proposed rule. For 
further information relating specifically 
to the MedPAC March 2008 reports or 
to obtain a copy of the reports, contact 
MedPAC at (202) 220–3700 or visit 
MedPAC’s Web site at: 
www.medpac.gov. 
F. Public Comments Received on Issues 
in Related Rules 
1. Comments on Phase-Out of the 
Capital Teaching Adjustment Under the 
IPPS Included in the FY 2008 IPPS 
Final Rule With Comment Period 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we solicited public 
comments on our policy changes related 
to phase-out of the capital teaching 
adjustment to the capital payment 
update under the IPPS (72 FR 47401). 
We received approximately 90 timely 
pieces of correspondence in response to 
our solicitation. (These public 
comments may be viewed on the 
following Web site: http://

address these public comments in the 
FY 2009 IPPS final rule, which is 
scheduled to be published in August 
2008. 
II. Proposed Changes to Medicare 
Severity DRG (MS–DRG) Classifications 
and Relative Weights 
A. Background 
Section 1886(d) of the Act specifies 
that the Secretary shall establish a 
classification system (referred to as 
DRGs) for inpatient discharges and 
adjust payments under the IPPS based 
on appropriate weighting factors 
assigned to each DRG. Therefore, under 
the IPPS, we pay for inpatient hospital 
services on a rate per discharge basis 
that varies according to the DRG to 
which a beneficiary’s stay is assigned. 
The formula used to calculate payment 
for a specific case multiplies an 
individual hospital’s payment rate per 
case by the weight of the DRG to which 
the case is assigned. Each DRG weight 
represents the average resources 
required to care for cases in that 
particular DRG, relative to the average 
resources used to treat cases in all 
DRGs. 
Congress recognized that it would be 
necessary to recalculate the DRG 
relative weights periodically to account 
for changes in resource consumption. 
Accordingly, section 1886(d)(4)(C) of 
the Act requires that the Secretary 
adjust the DRG classifications and 
relative weights at least annually. These 
adjustments are made to reflect changes 
in treatment patterns, technology, and 
any other factors that may change the 
relative use of hospital resources. 
B. MS–DRG Reclassifications 
1. General 
As discussed in the preamble to the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 47138), we focused our 
efforts in FY 2008 on making significant 
reforms to the IPPS consistent with the 
recommendations made by MedPAC in 
its ‘‘Report to the Congress, Physician- 
Owned Specialty Hospitals’’ in March 
2005. MedPAC recommended that the 
Secretary refine the entire DRG system 
by taking into account severity of illness 
and applying hospital-specific relative 
value (HSRV) weights to DRGs.1 We 
began this reform process by adopting 
cost-based weights over a 3-year 
transition period beginning in FY 2007 
and making interim changes to the DRG 
system for FY 2007 by creating 20 new 
CMS DRGs and modifying 32 others 
across 13 different clinical areas 
involving nearly 1.7 million cases. As 
described below in more detail, these 
refinements were intermediate steps 
towards comprehensive reform of both 
the relative weights and the DRG system 
that is occurring as we undertook 
further study. For FY 2008, we adopted 
745 new Medicare Severity DRGs (MS– 
DRGs) to replace the CMS DRGs. We 
refer readers to section II.D. of the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period for a full detailed discussion of 
how the MS–DRG system was 
established based on severity levels of 
illness (72 FR 47141). 
Currently, cases are classified into 
MS–DRGs for payment under the IPPS 
based on the principal diagnosis, up to 
eight additional diagnoses, and up to six 
procedures performed during the stay. 
In a small number of MS–DRGs, 
classification is also based on the age, 
sex, and discharge status of the patient. 
The diagnosis and procedure 
information is reported by the hospital 
using codes from the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD–9– 
CM). 
The process of forming the MS–DRGs 
was begun by dividing all possible 
principal diagnoses into mutually 
exclusive principal diagnosis areas, 
referred to as Major Diagnostic 
Categories (MDCs). The MDCs were 
formed by physician panels to ensure 
that the DRGs would be clinically 
coherent. The diagnoses in each MDC 
correspond to a single organ system or 
etiology and, in general, are associated 
with a particular medical specialty. 
Thus, in order to maintain the 
requirement of clinical coherence, no 
final MS–DRG could contain patients in 
different MDCs. Most MDCs are based 
on a particular organ system of the 
body. For example, MDC 6 is Diseases 
and Disorders of the Digestive System. 
This approach is used because clinical 
care is generally organized in 
accordance with the organ system 
affected. However, some MDCs are not 
constructed on this basis because they 
involve multiple organ systems (for 
example, MDC 22 (Burns)). For FY 2008, 
cases are assigned to one of 745 MS– 
DRGs in 25 MDCs. The table below lists 
the 25 MDCs. 
MAJOR DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES 
(MDCS) 
1 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Nervous System. 
2 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Eye. 
3 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Ear, Nose, Mouth, and Throat. 
4 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Respiratory System. 
5 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Circulatory System. 
6 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the Di-
gestive System. 
7 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Hepatobiliary System and Pan-
creas. 
8 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Musculoskeletal System and 
Connective Tissue. 
9 ............. Diseases and Disorders of the 
Skin, Subcutaneous Tissue and 
Breast. 
10 ........... Endocrine, Nutritional and Meta-
bolic Diseases and Disorders. 
11 ........... Diseases and Disorders of the 
Kidney and Urinary Tract. 
12 ........... Diseases and Disorders of the 
Male Reproductive System. 
13 ........... Diseases and Disorders of the 
Female Reproductive System. 
14 ........... Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the 
Puerperium. 
15 ........... Newborns and Other Neonates 
with Conditions Originating in 
the Perinatal Period. 
16 ........... Diseases and Disorders of the 
Blood and Blood Forming Or-
gans and Immunological Dis-
orders. 
17 ........... Myeloproliferative Diseases and 
Disorders and Poorly Differen-
tiated Neoplasms. 
18 ........... Infectious and Parasitic Diseases 
(Systemic or Unspecified 
Sites). 
19 ........... Mental Diseases and Disorders. 
20 ........... Alcohol/Drug Use and Alcohol/ 
Drug Induced Organic Mental 
Disorders. 
21 ........... Injuries, Poisonings, and Toxic 
Effects of Drugs. 
22 ........... Burns. 
23 ........... Factors Influencing Health Status 
and Other Contacts with Health 
Services. 
24 ........... Multiple Significant Trauma. 
25 ........... Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
Infections. 
In general, cases are assigned to an 
MDC based on the patient’s principal 
diagnosis before assignment to an MS– 
DRG. However, under the most recent 
version of the Medicare GROUPER 
(Version 26.0), there are 9 MS–DRGs to

which cases are directly assigned on the 
basis of ICD–9–CM procedure codes. 
These MS–DRGs are for heart transplant 
or implant of heart assist systems, liver 
and/or intestinal transplants, bone 
marrow transplants, lung transplants, 
simultaneous pancreas/kidney 
transplants, pancreas transplants, and 
for tracheostomies. Cases are assigned to 
these MS–DRGs before they are 
classified to an MDC. The table below 
lists the nine current pre-MDCs.

Once the MDCs were defined, each 
MDC was evaluated to identify those 
additional patient characteristics that 
would have a consistent effect on the 
consumption of hospital resources. 
Because the presence of a surgical 
procedure that required the use of the 
operating room would have a significant 
effect on the type of hospital resources 
used by a patient, most MDCs were 
initially divided into surgical DRGs and 
medical DRGs. Surgical DRGs are based 
on a hierarchy that orders operating 
room (O.R.) procedures or groups of 
O.R. procedures by resource intensity. 
Medical DRGs generally are 
differentiated on the basis of diagnosis 
and age (0 to 17 years of age or greater 
than 17 years of age). Some surgical and 
medical DRGs are further differentiated 
based on the presence or absence of a 
complication or comorbidity (CC) or a 
major complication or comorbidity 
(MCC). 
Generally, nonsurgical procedures 
and minor surgical procedures that are 
not usually performed in an operating 
room are not treated as O.R. procedures. 
However, there are a few non-O.R. 
procedures that do affect MS–DRG 
assignment for certain principal 
diagnoses. An example is extracorporeal 
shock wave lithotripsy for patients with 
a principal diagnosis of urinary stones. 
Lithotripsy procedures are not routinely 
performed in an operating room. 
Therefore, lithotripsy codes are not 
classified as O.R. procedures. However, 
our clinical advisors believe that 
patients with urinary stones who 
undergo extracorporeal shock wave 
lithotripsy should be considered similar 
to other patients who undergo O.R. 
procedures. Therefore, we treat this 
group of patients similar to patients 
undergoing O.R. procedures. 
Once the medical and surgical classes 
for an MDC were formed, each diagnosis 
class was evaluated to determine if 
complications or comorbidities would 
consistently affect the consumption of 
hospital resources. Each diagnosis was 
categorized into one of three severity 
levels. These three levels include a 
major complication or comorbidity 
(MCC), a complication or comorbidity 
(CC), or a non-CC. Physician panels 
classified each diagnosis code based on 
a highly iterative process involving a 
combination of statistical results from 
test data as well as clinical judgment. As 
stated earlier, we refer readers to section 
II.D. of the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period for a full detailed 
discussion of how the MS–DRG system 
was established based on severity levels 
of illness (72 FR 47141). 
A patient’s diagnosis, procedure, 
discharge status, and demographic 
information is entered into the Medicare 
claims processing systems and subjected 
to a series of automated screens called 
the Medicare Code Editor (MCE). The 
MCE screens are designed to identify 
cases that require further review before 
classification into an MS–DRG. 
After patient information is screened 
through the MCE and any further 
development of the claim is conducted, 
the cases are classified into the 
appropriate MS–DRG by the Medicare 
GROUPER software program. The 
GROUPER program was developed as a 
means of classifying each case into an 
MS–DRG on the basis of the diagnosis 
and procedure codes and, for a limited 
number of MS–DRGs, demographic 
information (that is, sex, age, and 
discharge status). 
After cases are screened through the 
MCE and assigned to an MS–DRG by the 
GROUPER, the PRICER software 
calculates a base MS–DRG payment. 
The PRICER calculates the payment for 
each case covered by the IPPS based on 
the MS–DRG relative weight and 
additional factors associated with each 
hospital, such as IME and DSH payment 
adjustments. These additional factors 
increase the payment amount to 
hospitals above the base MS–DRG 
payment. 
The records for all Medicare hospital 
inpatient discharges are maintained in 
the Medicare Provider Analysis and 
Review (MedPAR) file. The data in this 
file are used to evaluate possible MS– 
DRG classification changes and to 
recalibrate the MS–DRG weights. 
However, in the FY 2000 IPPS final rule 
(64 FR 41500), we discussed a process 
for considering non-MedPAR data in the 
recalibration process. In order for us to 
consider using particular non-MedPAR 
data, we must have sufficient time to 
evaluate and test the data. The time 
necessary to do so depends upon the 
nature and quality of the non-MedPAR 
data submitted. Generally, however, a 
significant sample of the non-MedPAR 
data should be submitted by mid- 
October for consideration in 
conjunction with the next year’s 
proposed rule. This date allows us time 
to test the data and make a preliminary 
assessment as to the feasibility of using 
the data. Subsequently, a complete 
database should be submitted by early 
December for consideration in 
conjunction with the next year’s 
proposed rule. 
As we indicated above, for FY 2008, 
we made significant improvement in the 
DRG system to recognize severity of 
illness and resource usage by adopting 
MS–DRGs. The changes we adopted 
were reflected in the FY 2008 
GROUPER, Version 25.0, and were 
effective for discharges occurring on or 
after October 1, 2007. Our DRG analysis 
for the FY 2008 final rule with comment 
period was based on data from the 
March 2007 update of the FY 2006 
MedPAR file, which contained hospital 
bills received through March 31, 2007, 
for discharges occurring through 
September 30, 2006. For this proposed 
rule, for FY 2009, our DRG analysis is 
based on data from the September 2007 
update of the FY 2007 MedPAR file, 
which contains hospital bills received 
through September 30, 2007, for 
discharges through September 30, 2007. 
2. Yearly Review for Making MS–DRG 
Changes 
Many of the changes to the MS–DRG 
classifications we make annually are the 
result of specific issues brought to our 
attention by interested parties. We 
encourage individuals with concerns 
about MS–DRG classifications to bring 
those concerns to our attention in a 
timely manner so they can be carefully 
considered for possible inclusion in the 
annual proposed rule and, if included, 
may be subjected to public review and 
comment. Therefore, similar to the

timetable for interested parties to submit 
non-MedPAR data for consideration in 
the MS–DRG recalibration process, 
concerns about MS–DRG classification 
issues should be brought to our 
attention no later than early December 
in order to be considered and possibly 
included in the next annual proposed 
rule updating the IPPS. 
The actual process of forming the 
MS–DRGs was, and will likely continue 
to be, highly iterative, involving a 
combination of statistical results from 
test data combined with clinical 
judgment. In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
(72 FR 47140 through 47189), we 
described in detail the process we used 
to develop the MS–DRGs that we 
adopted for FY 2008. In addition, in 
deciding whether to make further 
modification to the MS–DRGs for 
particular circumstances brought to our 
attention, we considered whether the 
resource consumption and clinical 
characteristics of the patients with a 
given set of conditions are significantly 
different than the remaining patients in 
the MS–DRG. We evaluated patient care 
costs using average charges and lengths 
of stay as proxies for costs and relied on 
the judgment of our medical advisors to 
decide whether patients are clinically 
distinct or similar to other patients in 
the MS–DRG. In evaluating resource 
costs, we considered both the absolute 
and percentage differences in average 
charges between the cases we selected 
for review and the remainder of cases in 
the MS–DRG. We also considered 
variation in charges within these 
groups; that is, whether observed 
average differences were consistent 
across patients or attributable to cases 
that were extreme in terms of charges or 
length of stay, or both. Further, we 
considered the number of patients who 
will have a given set of characteristics 
and generally preferred not to create a 
new MS–DRG unless it would include 
a substantial number of cases. 
C. Adoption of the MS–DRGs in FY 2008 
In the FY 2006, FY 2007, and FY 2008 
IPPS final rules, we discussed a number 
of recommendations made by MedPAC 
regarding revisions to the DRG system 
used under the IPPS (70 FR 47473 
through 47482; 71 FR 47881 through 
47939; and 72 FR 47140 through 47189). 
As we noted in the FY 2006 IPPS final 
rule, we had insufficient time to 
complete a thorough evaluation of these 
recommendations for full 
implementation in FY 2006. However, 
we did adopt severity-weighted cardiac 
DRGs in FY 2006 to address public 
comments on this issue and the specific 
concerns of MedPAC regarding cardiac 
surgery DRGs. We also indicated that we 
planned to further consider all of 
MedPAC’s recommendations and 
thoroughly analyze options and their 
impacts on the various types of 
hospitals in the FY 2007 IPPS proposed 
rule. 
For FY 2007, we began this process. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS proposed rule, we 
proposed to adopt Consolidated 
Severity DRGs (CS DRGs) for FY 2008 (if 
not earlier). However, based on public 
comments received on the FY 2007 IPPS 
proposed rule, we decided not to adopt 
the CS DRGs. Rather, we decided to 
make interim changes to the existing 
DRGs for FY 2007 by creating 20 new 
DRGs involving 13 different clinical 
areas that would significantly improve 
the CMS DRG system’s recognition of 
severity of illness. We also modified 32 
DRGs to better capture differences in 
severity. The new and revised DRGs 
were selected from 40 existing CMS 
DRGs that contained 1,666,476 cases 
and represent a number of body 
systems. In creating these 20 new DRGs, 
we deleted 8 and modified 32 existing 
DRGs. We indicated that these interim 
steps for FY 2007 were being taken as 
a prelude to more comprehensive 
changes to better account for severity in 
the DRG system by FY 2008. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule, we 
indicated our intent to pursue further 
DRG reform through two initiatives. 
First, we announced that we were in the 
process of engaging a contractor to assist 
us with evaluating alternative DRG 
systems that were raised as potential 
alternatives to the CMS DRGs in the 
public comments. Second, we indicated 
our intent to review over 13,000 ICD–9– 
CM diagnosis codes as part of making 
further refinements to the current CMS 
DRGs to better recognize severity of 
illness based on the work that CMS 
(then HCFA) did in the mid-1990’s in 
connection with adopting severity 
DRGs. We describe below the progress 
we have made on these two initiatives, 
our actions for FY 2008, and our 
proposals for FY 2009 based on our 
continued analysis of reform of the DRG 
system. We note that the adoption of the 
MS–DRGs to better recognize severity of 
illness has implications for the outlier 
threshold, the application of the 
postacute care transfer policy, the 
measurement of real case-mix versus 
apparent case-mix, and the IME and 
DSH payment adjustments. We discuss 
these implications for FY 2009 in other 
sections of this preamble and in the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS proposed rule, 
we discussed MedPAC’s 
recommendations to move to a cost- 
based HSRV weighting methodology 
using HSRVs beginning with the FY 
2007 IPPS proposed rule for 
determining the DRG relative weights. 
Although we proposed to adopt the 
HSRV weighting methodology for FY 
2007, we decided not to adopt the 
proposed methodology in the final rule 
after considering the public comments 
we received on the proposal. Instead, in 
the FY 2007 IPPS final rule, we adopted 
a cost-based weighting methodology 
without the HSRV portion of the 
proposed methodology. The cost-based 
weights are being adopted over a 3-year 
transition period in 1⁄3 increments 
between FY 2007 and FY 2009. In 
addition, in the FY 2007 IPPS final rule, 
we indicated our intent to further study 
the HSRV-based methodology as well as 
other issues brought to our attention 
related to the cost-based weighting 
methodology adopted in the FY 2007 
final rule. There was significant concern 
in the public comments that our cost- 
based weighting methodology does not 
adequately account for charge 
compression—the practice of applying a 
higher percentage charge markup over 
costs to lower cost items and services 
and a lower percentage charge markup 
over costs to higher cost items and 
services. Further, public commenters 
expressed concern about potential 
inconsistencies between how costs and 
charges are reported on the Medicare 
cost reports and charges on the 
Medicare claims. In the FY 2007 IPPS 
final rule, we used costs and charges 
from the cost report to determine 
departmental level cost-to-charge ratios 
(CCRs) which we then applied to 
charges on the Medicare claims to 
determine the cost-based weights. The 
commenters were concerned about 
potential distortions to the cost-based 
weights that would result from 
inconsistent reporting between the cost 
reports and the Medicare claims. After 
publication of the FY 2007 IPPS final 
rule, we entered into a contract with RTI 
International (RTI) to study both charge 
compression and to what extent our 
methodology for calculating DRG 
relative weights is affected by 
inconsistencies between how hospitals 
report costs and charges on the cost 
reports and how hospitals report 
charges on individual claims. Further, 
as part of its study of alternative DRG 
systems, the RAND Corporation 
analyzed the HSRV cost-weighting 
methodology. We refer readers to 
section II.E. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule for our proposals for 
addressing the issue of charge 
compression and the HSRV cost- 
weighting methodology for FY 2009. 
We believe that revisions to the DRG 
system to better recognize severity of

illness and changes to the relative 
weights based on costs rather than 
charges are improving the accuracy of 
the payment rates in the IPPS. We agree 
with MedPAC that these refinements 
should be pursued. Although we 
continue to caution that any prospective 
payment system based on grouping 
cases will always present some 
opportunities for providers to specialize 
in cases they believe have higher 
margins, we believe that the changes we 
have adopted and the continuing 
reforms we are proposing in this 
proposed rule for FY 2009 will improve 
payment accuracy and reduce financial 
incentives to create specialty hospitals. 
We refer readers to section II.D. of the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period for a full discussion of how the 
MS–DRG system was established based 
on severity levels of illness (72 FR 
47141). 
D. MS–DRG Documentation and Coding 
Adjustment, Including the Applicability 
to the Hospital-Specific Rates and the 
Puerto Rico-Specific Standardized 
Amount 
1. MS–DRG Documentation and Coding 
Adjustment 
As stated above, we adopted the new 
MS–DRG patient classification system 
for the IPPS, effective October 1, 2007, 
to better recognize severity of illness in 
Medicare payment rates. Adoption of 
the MS–DRGs resulted in the expansion 
of the number of DRGs from 538 in FY 
2007 to 745 in FY 2008. By increasing 
the number of DRGs and more fully 
taking into account severity of illness in 
Medicare payment rates, the MS–DRGs 
encourage hospitals to improve their 
documentation and coding of patient 
diagnoses. In the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 47175 
through 47186), which appeared in the 
Federal Register on August 22, 2007, we 
indicated that we believe the adoption 
of the MS–DRGs had the potential to 
lead to increases in aggregate payments 
without a corresponding increase in 
actual patient severity of illness due to 
the incentives for improved 
documentation and coding. In that final 
rule with comment period, using the 
Secretary’s authority under section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act to maintain 
budget neutrality by adjusting the 
standardized amount to eliminate the 
effect of changes in coding or 
classification that do not reflect real 
change in case-mix, we established 
prospective documentation and coding 
adjustments of ¥1.2 percent for FY 
2008, ¥1.8 percent for FY 2009, and 
¥1.8 percent for FY 2010. 
On September 29, 2007, the TMA, 
Abstinence Education, and QI Programs 
Extension Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110–90, 
was enacted. Section 7 of Pub. L. 110– 
90 included a provision that reduces the 
documentation and coding adjustment 
for the MS–DRG system that we adopted 
in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period to ¥0.6 percent for FY 
2008 and ¥0.9 percent for FY 2009. To 
comply with the provision of section 7 
of Pub. L. 110–90, in a final rule that 
appeared in the Federal Register on 
November 27, 2007 (72 FR 66886), we 
changed the IPPS documentation and 
coding adjustment for FY 2008 to ¥0.6 
percent, and revised the FY 2008 
payment rates, factors, and thresholds 
accordingly, with these revisions 
effective October 1, 2007. 
For FY 2009, Pub. L. 110–90 requires 
a documentation and coding adjustment 
of ¥0.9 percent instead of the ¥1.8 
percent adjustment specified in the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period. As required by statute, we are 
applying a documentation and coding 
adjustment of ¥0.9 percent to the FY 
2009 IPPS national standardized 
amounts. The documentation and 
coding adjustments established in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period are cumulative. As a result, the 
¥0.9 percent documentation and 
coding adjustment in FY 2009 is in 
addition to the ¥0.6 percent adjustment 
in FY 2008, yielding a combined effect 
of ¥1.5 percent. 
2. Application of the Documentation 
and Coding Adjustment to the Hospital- 
Specific Rates 
Under section 1886(d)(5)(D)(i) of the 
Act, SCHs are paid based on whichever 
of the following rates yields the greatest 
aggregate payment: The Federal national 
rate; the updated hospital-specific rate 
based on FY 1982 costs per discharge; 
the updated hospital-specific rate based 
on FY 1987 costs per discharge; or the 
updated hospital-specific rate based on 
FY 1996 costs per discharge. Under 
section 1886(d)(5)(G) of the Act, MDHs 
are paid based on the Federal national 
rate or, if higher, the Federal national 
rate plus 75 percent of the difference 
between the Federal national rate and 
the updated hospital-specific rate based 
on the greater of either the FY 1982, 
1987, or 2002 costs per discharge. In the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period, we established a policy of 
applying the documentation and coding 
adjustment to the hospital-specific rates. 
In that rule, we indicated that because 
SCHs and MDHs use the same DRG 
system as all other hospitals, we believe 
they should be equally subject to the 
budget neutrality adjustment that we are 
applying for adoption of the MS–DRGs 
to all other hospitals. In establishing 
this policy, we cited our authority under 
section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act, 
which provides the authority to adjust 
‘‘the standardized amount’’ to eliminate 
the effect of changes in coding or 
classification that do not reflect real 
change in case-mix. However, in a final 
rule that appeared in the Federal 
Register on November 27, 2007 (72 FR 
66886), we rescinded the application of 
the documentation and coding 
adjustment to the hospital-specific rates 
retroactive to October 1, 2007. In that 
final rule, we indicated that, while we 
still believe it would be appropriate to 
apply the documentation and coding 
adjustment to the hospital-specific rates, 
upon further review we decided that 
application of the documentation and 
coding adjustment to the hospital- 
specific rates is not consistent with the 
plain meaning of section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act, which only 
mentions adjusting ‘‘the standardized 
amount’’ and does not mention 
adjusting the hospital-specific rates. 
We continue to have concerns about 
this issue. Because hospitals paid based 
on the hospital-specific rate use the 
same MS–DRG system as other 
hospitals, we believe they have the 
potential to realize increased payments 
from coding improvements that do not 
reflect real increases in patients’ 
severity of illness. In section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act, Congress 
stipulated that hospitals paid based on 
the standardized amount should not 
receive additional payments based on 
the effect of documentation and coding 
changes that do not reflect real changes 
in case-mix. Similarly, we believe that 
hospitals paid based on the hospital- 
specific rate should not have the 
potential to realize increased payments 
due to documentation and coding 
improvements that do not reflect real 
increases in patients’ severity of illness. 
While we continue to believe that 
section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act does 
not provide explicit authority for 
application of the documentation and 
coding adjustment to the hospital- 
specific rates, we believe that we have 
the authority to apply the 
documentation and coding adjustment 
to the hospital-specific rates using our 
special exceptions and adjustment 
authority under section 1886(d)(5)(I)(i) 
of the Act. The special exceptions and 
adjustment authority authorizes us to 
provide ‘‘for such other exceptions and 
adjustments to [IPPS] payment amounts 
* * * as the Secretary deems 
appropriate.’’ In light of this authority, 
for the FY 2010 rulemaking, we plan to

23541 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
examine our FY 2008 claims data for 
hospitals paid based on the hospital- 
specific rate. If we find evidence of 
significant increases in case-mix for 
patients treated in these hospitals, we 
would consider proposing application 
of the documentation and coding 
adjustments to the FY 2010 hospital- 
specific rates under our authority in 
section 1886(d)(5)(I)(i) of the Act. As 
noted previously, the documentation 
and coding adjustments established in 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period are cumulative. For 
example, the ¥0.9 percent 
documentation and coding adjustment 
to the national standardized amount in 
FY 2009 is in addition to the ¥0.6 
percent adjustment made in FY 2008, 
yielding a combined effect of ¥1.5 
percent in FY 2009. Given the 
cumulative nature of the documentation 
and coding adjustments, if we were to 
propose to apply the documentation and 
coding adjustment to the FY 2010 
hospital-specific rates, it may involve 
applying the FY 2008 and FY 2009 
documentation and coding adjustments 
(¥1.5 percent combined) plus the FY 
2010 documentation and coding 
adjustment, discussed in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period, to 
the FY 2010 hospital-specific rates. 
3. Application of the Documentation 
and Coding Adjustment to the Puerto 
Rico-Specific Standardized Amount 
Puerto Rico hospitals are paid based 
on 75 percent of the national 
standardized amount and 25 percent of 
the Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount. As noted previously, the 
documentation and coding adjustment 
we adopted in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period relied upon 
our authority under section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act, which 
provides the authority to adjust ‘‘the 
standardized amounts computed under 
this paragraph’’ to eliminate the effect of 
changes in coding or classification that 
do not reflect real change in case-mix. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act 
applies to the national standardized 
amounts computed under section 
1886(d)(3) of the Act, but does not apply 
to the Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount computed under section 
1886(d)(9)(C) of the Act. In calculating 
the FY 2008 payment rates, we made an 
inadvertent error and applied the FY 
2008 ¥0.6 percent documentation and 
coding adjustment to the Puerto Rico- 
specific standardized amount, relying 
on our authority under section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act. We are 
currently in the process of developing a 
Federal Register notice to correct that 
error in the Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount for FY 2008 
retroactive to October 1, 2007. 
While section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the 
Act is not applicable to the Puerto Rico- 
specific standardized amount, we 
believe that we have the authority to 
apply the documentation and coding 
adjustment to the Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount using our special 
exceptions and adjustment authority 
under section 1886(d)(5)(I)(i) of the Act. 
Similar to SCHs and MDHs that are paid 
based on the hospital-specific rate, 
discussed in section II.D.2. of this 
preamble, we believe that Puerto Rico 
hospitals that are paid based on the 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount should not have the potential to 
realize increased payments due to 
documentation and coding 
improvements that do not reflect real 
increases in patients’ severity of illness. 
Consistent with the approach described 
for SCHs and MDHs in section II.D.2. of 
the preamble of this proposed rule, for 
the FY 2010 rulemaking, we plan to 
examine our FY 2008 claims data for 
hospitals in Puerto Rico. If we find 
evidence of significant increases in case- 
mix for patients treated in these 
hospitals, we would consider proposing 
application of the documentation and 
coding adjustments to the FY 2010 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount under our authority in section 
1886(d)(5)(I)(i) of the Act. As noted 
previously, the documentation and 
coding adjustments established in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period are cumulative. Given the 
cumulative nature of the documentation 
and coding adjustments, if we were to 
propose to apply the documentation and 
coding adjustment to the FY 2010 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount, it may involve applying the FY 
2008 and FY 2009 documentation and 
coding adjustments (¥1.5 percent 
combined) plus the FY 2010 
documentation and coding adjustment, 
discussed in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period, to the FY 2010 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount. 
4. Potential Additional Payment 
Adjustments in FYs 2010 Through 2012 
Section 7 of Pub. L.110–90 also 
provides for payment adjustments in 
FYs 2010 through 2012 based upon a 
retrospective evaluation of claims data 
from the implementation of the MS– 
DRG system. If, based on this 
retrospective evaluation, the Secretary 
finds that in FY 2008 and FY 2009, the 
actual amount of change in case-mix 
that does not reflect real change in 
underlying patient severity differs from 
the statutorily mandated documentation 
and coding adjustments implemented in 
those years, the law requires the 
Secretary to adjust payments for 
discharges occurring in FYs 2010 
through 2012 to offset the estimated 
amount of increase or decrease in 
aggregate payments that occurred in FY 
2008 and FY 2009 as a result of that 
difference, in addition to making an 
appropriate adjustment to the 
standardized amount under section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act. 
In order to implement these 
requirements of section 7 of Pub. L. 
110–90, we are planning a thorough 
retrospective evaluation of our claims 
data. Results of this evaluation would be 
used by our actuaries to determine any 
necessary payment adjustments in FYs 
2010 through 2012 to ensure the budget 
neutrality of the MS–DRG 
implementation for FY 2008 and FY 
2009, as required by law. We are 
currently developing our analysis plans 
for this effort. 
We intend to measure and corroborate 
the extent of the overall national average 
changes in case-mix for FY 2008 and FY 
2009. We expect part of this overall 
national average change would be 
attributable to underlying changes in 
actual patient severity and part would 
be attributable to documentation and 
coding improvements under the MS– 
DRG system. In order to separate the 
two effects, we plan to isolate the effect 
of shifts in cases among base DRGs from 
the effect of shifts in the types of cases 
within base DRGs. The shifts among 
base DRGs are the result of changes in 
principal diagnoses while the shifts 
within base DRGs are the result of 
changes in secondary diagnoses. 
Because we expect most of the 
documentation and coding 
improvements under the MS–DRG 
system will occur in the secondary 
diagnoses, the shifts among base DRGs 
are less likely to be the result of the MS– 
DRG system and the shifts within base 
DRGs are more likely to be the result of 
the MS–DRG system. We also anticipate 
evaluating data to identify the specific 
MS–DRGs and diagnoses that 
contributed significantly to the 
improved documentation and coding 
payment effect and to quantify their 
impact. This step would entail analysis 
of the secondary diagnoses driving the 
shifts in severity within specific base 
DRGs. 
While we believe that the data 
analysis plan described previously will 
produce an appropriate estimate of the 
extent of case-mix changes resulting 
from documentation and coding 
improvements, we may also decide, if 
feasible, to use historical data from our 
Hospital Payment Monitoring Program

23542 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
(HPMP) to corroborate the within base 
DRG shift analysis. The HPMP is 
supported by the Medicare Clinical Data 
Abstraction Center (CDAC). From 1999 
to 2007, the CDAC obtained medical 
records for a sample of discharges as 
part of our hospital monitoring 
activities. These data were collected on 
a random sample of between 30,000 to 
50,000 hospital discharges per year. The 
historical CDAC data could be used to 
develop an upper bound estimate of the 
trend in real case-mix growth (that is, 
real change in underlying patient 
severity) prior to implementation of the 
MS–DRGs. 
We welcome public comments on our 
analysis plans, as well as suggestions on 
other possible approaches for 
conducting a retrospective analysis to 
identify the amount of case-mix changes 
that occurred in FY 2008 and FY 2009 
that did not reflect real increases in 
patients’ severity of illness. Our 
analysis, findings, and any resulting 
proposals to adjust payments for 
discharges occurring in FYs 2010 
through 2012 to offset the estimated 
amount of increase or decrease in 
aggregate payments that occurred in FY 
2008 and FY 2009 will be discussed in 
future years’ rulemakings. 
E. Refinement of the MS–DRG Relative 
Weight Calculation 
1. Background 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47188), we 
continued to implement significant 
revisions to Medicare’s inpatient 
hospital rates by basing relative weights 
on hospitals’ estimated costs rather than 
on charges. We continued our 3-year 
transition from charge-based relative 
weights to cost-based relative weights. 
Beginning in FY 2007, we implemented 
relative weights based on cost report 
data instead of based on charge 
information. We had initially proposed 
to develop cost-based relative weights 
using the hospital-specific relative value 
cost center (HSRVcc) methodology as 
recommended by MedPAC. However, 
after considering concerns raised in the 
public comments, we modified 
MedPAC’s methodology to exclude the 
hospital-specific relative weight feature. 
Instead, we developed national CCRs 
based on distinct hospital departments 
and engaged a contractor to evaluate the 
HSRVcc methodology for future 
consideration. To mitigate payment 
instability due to the adoption of cost- 
based relative weights, we decided to 
transition cost-based weights over 3 
years by blending them with charge- 
based weights beginning in FY 2007. In 
FY 2008, we continued our transition by 
blending the relative weights with one- 
third charge-based weights and two- 
thirds cost-based weights. 
Also, in FY 2008, we adopted 
severity-based MS–DRGs, which 
increased the number of DRGs from 538 
to 745. Many commenters raised 
concerns as to how the transition from 
charge-based weights to cost-based 
weights would continue with the 
introduction of new MS–DRGs. We 
decided to implement a 2-year 
transition for the MS–DRGs to coincide 
with the remainder of the transition to 
cost-based relative weights. In FY 2008, 
50 percent of the relative weight for 
each DRG was based on the CMS DRG 
relative weight and 50 percent was 
based on the MS–DRG relative weight. 
We refer readers to the FY 2007 IPPS 
final rule (71 FR 47882) for more detail 
on our final policy for calculating the 
cost-based DRG relative weights and to 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47199) for 
information on how we blended relative 
weights based on the CMS DRGs and 
MS–DRGs. 
As we transitioned to cost-based 
relative weights, some commenters 
raised concerns about potential bias in 
the weights due to ‘‘charge 
compression,’’ which is the practice of 
applying a higher percentage charge 
markup over costs to lower cost items 
and services, and a lower percentage 
charge markup over costs to higher cost 
items and services. As a result, the cost- 
based weights would undervalue high 
cost items and overvalue low cost items 
if a single CCR is applied to items of 
widely varying costs in the same cost 
center. To address this concern, in 
August 2006, we awarded a contract to 
RTI to study the effects of charge 
compression in calculating the relative 
weights and to consider methods to 
reduce the variation in the CCRs across 
services within cost centers. RTI issued 
an interim draft report in March 2007 
which was posted on the CMS Web site 
with its findings on charge compression. 
In that report, RTI found that a number 
of factors contribute to charge 
compression and affect the accuracy of 
the relative weights. RTI found 
inconsistent matching of charges in the 
Medicare cost report and their 
corresponding charges in the MedPAR 
claims for certain cost centers. In 
addition, there was inconsistent 
reporting of costs and charges among 
hospitals. For example, some hospitals 
would report costs and charges for 
devices and medical supplies in the 
Medical Supplies Charged to Patients 
cost center, while other hospitals would 
report those costs and charges in their 
related ancillary departments such as 
Operating Room or Radiology. RTI also 
found evidence that certain revenue 
codes within the same cost center had 
significantly different markup rates. For 
example, within the Medicare Supplies 
Charged to Patients cost center, revenue 
codes for devices, implantables, and 
prosthetics had different markup rates 
than the other medical supplies in that 
cost center. RTI’s findings demonstrated 
that charge compression exists in 
several CCRs, most notably in the 
Medical Supplies and Equipment CCR. 
RTI offered short-term, medium-term, 
and long-term recommendations to 
mitigate the effects of charge 
compression. RTI’s short-term 
recommendations included expanding 
the distinct hospital CCRs to 19 by 
disaggregating the ‘‘Emergency Room’’ 
and ‘‘Blood and Blood Products’’ from 
the Other Services cost center and by 
estimating regression-based CCRs to 
disaggregate Medical Supplies, Drugs, 
and Radiology cost centers. RTI 
recommended, for the medium-term, to 
expand the MedPAR file to include 
separate fields that disaggregate several 
existing charge departments. In 
addition, RTI recommended improving 
hospital cost reporting instructions so 
that hospitals can properly report costs 
in the appropriate cost centers. RTI’s 
long-term recommendations included 
adding new cost centers to the Medicare 
cost report, such as adding a ‘‘Devices, 
Implants and Prosthetics’’ line under 
‘‘Medical Supplies Charged to Patients’’ 
and a ‘‘CT Scanning and MRI’’ 
subscripted line under ‘‘Radiology- 
Diagnostics’’. 
Among RTI’s short-term 
recommendations, for FY 2008, we 
expanded the number of distinct 
hospital department CCRs from 13 to 15 
by disaggregating ‘‘Emergency Room’’ 
and ‘‘Blood and Blood Products’’ from 
the Other Services cost center as these 
lines already exist on the hospital cost 
report. Furthermore, in an effort to 
improve consistency between costs and 
their corresponding charges in the 
MedPAR file, we moved the costs for 
cases involving electroencephalography 
(EEG) from the Cardiology cost center to 
the Laboratory cost center group which 
corresponds with the EEG MedPAR 
claims categorized under the Laboratory 
charges. We also agreed with RTI’s 
recommendations to revise the Medicare 
cost report and the MedPAR file as a 
long-term solution for charge 
compression. We stated that, in the 
upcoming year, we would consider 
additional lines to the cost report and 
additional revenue codes for the 
MedPAR file. 
We did not adopt RTI’s short-term 
recommendation to create four

additional regression-based CCRs for 
several reasons, even though we had 
received comments in support of the 
regression-based CCRs as a means to 
immediately resolve the problem of 
charge compression, particularly within 
the Medical Supplies and Equipment 
CCR. We were concerned that RTI’s 
analysis was limited to charges on 
hospital inpatient claims while typically 
hospital cost report CCRs combine both 
inpatient and outpatient services. 
Further, because both the IPPS and 
OPPS rely on cost-based weights, we 
preferred to introduce any 
methodological adjustments to both 
payment systems at the same time. We 
have since expanded RTI’s analysis of 
charge compression to incorporate 
outpatient services. RTI has been 
evaluating the cost estimation process 
for the OPPS cost-based weights, 
including a reassessment of the 
regression-based CCR models using both 
outpatient and inpatient charge data. 
The RTI report was finalized at the 
conclusion of our proposed rule 
development process and is expected to 
be posted on the CMS Web site in the 
near future. We welcome comments on 
this report. 
A second reason that we did not 
implement regression-based CCRs at the 
time of the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period was our inability to 
investigate how regression-based CCRs 
would interact with the implementation 
of MS–DRGs. We stated that we would 
consider the results of the second phase 
of the RAND study as we prepared for 
the FY 2009 IPPS rulemaking process. 
The purpose of the RAND study was to 
analyze how the relative weights would 
change if we were to adopt regression- 
based CCRs to address charge 
compression while simultaneously 
adopting an HSRV methodology using 
fully phased-in MS–DRGs. We had 
intended to include a detailed 
discussion of RAND’s study in this FY 
2009 IPPS proposed rule. However, due 
to some delays in releasing identifiable 
data to the contractor under revised data 
security rules, the report on this second 
stage of RAND’s analysis was not 
completed in time for the development 
of this proposed rule. Therefore, we 
continue to have the same concerns 
with respect to uncertainty about how 
regression-based CCRs would interact 
with the MS–DRGs or an HSRV 
methodology. Therefore, we are not 
proposing to adopt the regression-based 
CCRs or an HSRV methodology in this 
FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule. 
Nevertheless, we welcome public 
comments on our proposals not to adopt 
regression-based CCRs or an HSRV 
methodology at this time or in the 
future. The RAND report on regression- 
based CCRs and the HSRV methodology 
was finalized at the conclusion of our 
proposed rule development process and 
is expected to be posted on the CMS 
Web site in the near future. Although 
we are unable to include a discussion of 
the results of the RAND study in this 
proposed rule, we welcome public 
comment on the report. 
Finally, we received public comments 
on the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule 
raising concerns on the accuracy of 
using regression-based CCR estimates to 
determine the relative weights rather 
than the Medicare cost report. 
Commenters noted that regression-based 
CCRs would not fix the underlying 
mismatch of hospital reporting of costs 
and charges. Instead, the commenters 
suggested that the impact of charge 
compression might be mitigated through 
an educational initiative that would 
encourage hospitals to improve their 
cost reporting. Commenters 
recommended that hospitals be 
educated to report costs and charges in 
a way that is consistent with how 
charges are grouped in the MedPAR file. 
In an effort to achieve this goal, hospital 
associations have launched an 
educational campaign to encourage 
consistent reporting, which would 
result in consistent groupings of the cost 
centers used to establish the cost-based 
relative weights. The commenters 
requested that CMS communicate to the 
fiscal intermediaries/MACs that such 
action is appropriate. In the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period, 
we stated that we were supportive of the 
educational initiative of the industry, 
and we encouraged hospitals to report 
costs and charges consistently with how 
the data are used to determine relative 
weights (72 FR 47196). We would also 
like to affirm that the longstanding 
Medicare principles of cost 
apportionment at 42 CFR 413.53 convey 
that, under the departmental method of 
apportionment, the cost of each 
ancillary department is to be 
apportioned separately rather than being 
combined with another ancillary 
department (for example, combining the 
cost of Medical Supplies Charged to 
Patients with the costs of Operating 
Room or any other ancillary cost center. 
(We note that, effective for cost 
reporting periods starting on or after 
January 1, 1979, the departmental 
method of apportionment replaced the 
combination method of apportionment 
where all the ancillary departments 
were apportioned in the aggregate 
(Section 2200.3 of the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Part I).) 
Furthermore, longstanding Medicare 
cost reporting policy has been that 
hospitals must include the cost and 
charges of separately ‘‘chargeable 
medical supplies’’ in the Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients cost center 
(line 55 of Worksheet A), rather than in 
the Operating Room, Emergency Room, 
or other ancillary cost centers. Routine 
services, which can include ‘‘minor 
medical and surgical supplies’’ (Section 
2202.6 of the PRM, Part 1), and items for 
which a separate charge is not 
customarily made, may be directly 
assigned through the hospital’s 
accounting system to the department in 
which they were used, or they may be 
included in the Central Services and 
Supply cost center (line 15 of Worksheet 
A). Conversely, the separately 
chargeable medical supplies should be 
assigned to the Medical Supplies 
Charged to Patients cost center on line 
55. 
We note that not only is accurate cost 
reporting important for IPPS hospitals to 
ensure that accurate relative weights are 
computed, but hospitals that are still 
paid on the basis of cost, such as CAHs 
and cancer hospitals, and SCHs and 
MDHs must adhere to Medicare cost 
reporting principles as well. 
The CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 66601) 
also discussed the issue of charge 
compression and regression-based 
CCRs, and noted that RTI is currently 
evaluating the cost estimation process 
underpinning the OPPS cost-based 
weights, including a reassessment of the 
regression models using both outpatient 
and inpatient charges, rather than 
inpatient charges only. In responding to 
comments in the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC 
final rule with comment period, we 
emphasized that we ‘‘fully support’’ the 
educational initiatives of the industry 
and that we would ‘‘examine whether 
the educational activities being 
undertaken by the hospital community 
to improve cost reporting accuracy 
under the IPPS would help to mitigate 
charge compression under the OPPS, 
either as an adjunct to the application 
of regression-based CCRs or in lieu of 
such an adjustment’’ (72 FR 66601). 
However, as we stated in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period 
that we would consider the results of 
the RAND study before considering 
whether to adopt regression-based 
CCRs, in the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final 
rule with comment period, we stated 
that we would determine whether 
refinements should be proposed, after 
reviewing the results of the RTI study. 
On February 29, 2008, we issued 
Transmittal 321, Change Request 5928, 
to inform the fiscal intermediaries/

MACs of the hospital associations’ 
initiative to encourage hospitals to 
modify their cost reporting practices 
with respect to costs and charges in a 
manner that is consistent with how 
charges are grouped in the MedPAR file. 
We noted that the hospital cost reports 
submitted for FY 2008 may have costs 
and charges grouped differently than in 
prior years, which is allowable as long 
as the costs and charges are properly 
matched and the Medicare cost 
reporting instructions are followed. 
Furthermore, we recommended that 
fiscal intermediaries/MACs remain 
vigilant to ensure that the costs of items 
and services are not moved from one 
cost center to another without moving 
their corresponding charges. Due to a 
time lag in submittal of cost reporting 
data, the impact of changes in providers’ 
cost reporting practices occurring 
during FY 2008 would be reflected in 
the FY 2011 IPPS relative weights. 
2. Refining the Medicare Cost Report 
In developing this FY 2009 proposed 
rule, we considered whether there were 
concrete steps we could take to mitigate 
the bias introduced by charge 
compression in both the IPPS and OPPS 
relative weights in a way that balance 
hospitals’ desire to focus on improving 
the cost reporting process through 
educational initiatives with device 
industry interest in adopting regression- 
adjusted CCRs. Although RTI 
recommended adopting regression- 
based CCRs, particularly for medical 
supplies and devices, as a short-term 
solution to address charge compression, 
RTI also recommended refinements to 
the cost report as a long-term solution. 
RTI’s draft interim March 2007 report 
discussed a number of options that 
could improve the accuracy and 
precision of the CCRs currently being 
derived from the Medicare cost report 
and also reduce the need for 
statistically-based adjustments. As 
mentioned in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
47193), we believe that RTI and many 
of the public commenters on the FY 
2008 IPPS proposed rule concluded 
that, ultimately, improved and more 
precise cost reporting is the best way to 
minimize charge compression and 
improve the accuracy of cost weights. 
Therefore, in this proposed rule, we are 
proposing to begin making cost report 
changes geared to improving the 
accuracy of the IPPS and OPPS relative 
weights. However, we also received 
comments last year asking that we 
proceed cautiously with changing the 
Medicare cost report to avoid 
unintended consequences for hospitals 
that are paid on a cost basis (such as 
CAHs and, to some extent, SCHs and 
MDHs), and to consider the 
administrative burden associated with 
adapting to new cost reporting forms 
and instructions. Accordingly, we are 
proposing to focus at this time on the 
CCR for Medical Supplies and 
Equipment because RTI found that the 
largest impact on the relative weights 
could result from correcting charge 
compression for devices and implants. 
When examining markup differences 
within the Medical Supplies Charged to 
Patients cost center, RTI found that its 
‘‘regression results provide solid 
evidence that if there were distinct cost 
centers for items, cost ratios for devices 
and implants would average about 17 
points higher than the ratios for other 
medical supplies’’ (January 2007 RTI 
report, page 59). This suggests that 
much of the charge compression within 
the Medical Supplies CCR results from 
inclusion of medical devices that have 
significantly different markups than the 
other supplies in that CCR. 
Furthermore, in the FY 2007 final rule 
and FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, the Medical Supplies 
and Equipment CCR received significant 
attention by the public commenters. 
Although we are proposing to make 
improvements to lessen the effects of 
charge compression only on the Medical 
Supplies and Equipment CCR as a first 
step, we are inviting public comments 
as to whether to make other changes to 
the Medicare cost report to refine other 
CCRs. In addition, we are open to 
making further refinements to other 
CCRs in the future. Therefore, we are 
proposing at this time to add only one 
cost center to the cost report, such that, 
in general, the costs and charges for 
relatively inexpensive medical supplies 
would be reported separately from the 
costs and charges of more expensive 
devices (such as pacemakers and other 
implantable devices). We will consider 
public comments submitted on this 
proposed rule for purposes of both the 
IPPS and the OPPS relative weights and, 
by extension, the calculation of the 
ambulatory surgical center (ASC) 
payment rates. 
Under the IPPS for FY 2007 and FY 
2008, the aggregate CCR for supplies 
and equipment was computed based on 
line 55 for Medical Supplies Charged to 
Patients and lines 66 and 67 for DME 
Rented and DME Sold, respectively. To 
compute the 15 national CCRs used in 
developing the cost-based weights 
under the IPPS (explained in more 
detail under section II.H. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule), we take 
the costs and charges for the 15 cost 
groups from Worksheet C, Part I of the 
Medicare cost report for all hospital 
patients and multiply each of these 15 
CCRs by the Medicare charges on 
Worksheet D–4 for those same cost 
centers to impute the Medicare cost for 
each of the 15 cost groups. Under this 
proposal, the goal would be to split the 
current CCR for Medical Supplies and 
Equipment into one CCR for medical 
supplies, and another CCR for devices 
and DME Rented and DME Sold. 
In considering how to instruct 
hospitals on what to report in the cost 
center for supplies and the cost center 
for devices, we looked at the existing 
criteria for what type of device qualifies 
for payment as a transitional pass- 
through device category in the OPPS. 
(There are no such existing criteria for 
devices under the IPPS.) The provisions 
of the regulations under § 419.66(b) state 
that for a medical device to be eligible 
for pass-through payment under the 
OPPS, the medical device must meet the 
following criteria: 
a. If required by the FDA, the device 
must have received FDA approval or 
clearance (except for a device that has 
received an FDA investigational device 
exemption (IDE) and has been classified 
as a Category B device by the FDA in 
accordance with §§ 405.203 through 
405.207 and 405.211 through 405.215 of 
the regulations) or another appropriate 
FDA exemption. 
b. The device is determined to be 
reasonable and necessary for the 
diagnosis or treatment of an illness or 
injury or to improve the functioning of 
a malformed body part (as required by 
section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act). 
c. The device is an integral and 
subordinate part of the service 
furnished, is used for one patient only, 
comes in contact with human tissues, 
and is surgically implanted or inserted 
whether or not it remains with the 
patient when the patient is released 
from the hospital. 
d. The device is not any of the 
following: 
• Equipment, an instrument, 
apparatus, implement, or item of this 
type for which depreciation and 
financing expenses are recovered as 
depreciable assets as defined in Chapter 
1 of the Medicare Provider 
Reimbursement Manual (CMS Pub. 15– 
1). 
• A material or supply furnished 
incident to a service (for example, a 
suture, customized surgical kit, or clip, 
other than a radiological site marker). 
• Material that may be used to replace 
human skin (for example, a biological or 
synthetic material). 
These requirements are the OPPS 
criteria used to define a device for pass- 
through payment purposes and do not 
include additional criteria that are used

under the OPPS to determine if a 
candidate device is new and represents 
a substantial clinical improvement, two 
other requirements for qualifying for 
pass-through payment. 
For purposes of applying the 
eligibility criteria, we interpret ‘‘surgical 
insertion or implantation’’ to include 
devices that are surgically inserted or 
implanted via a natural or surgically 
created orifice as well as those devices 
that are inserted or implanted via a 
surgically created incision (70 FR 
68630). 
In proposing to modify the cost report 
to have one cost center for medical 
supplies and one cost center for devices, 
we are proposing that hospitals would 
determine what should be reported in 
the Medical Supplies cost center and 
what should be reported in the Medical 
Devices cost center using criteria 
consistent with those listed above that 
are included under § 419.66(b), with 
some modification. Specifically, for 
purposes of the cost reporting 
instructions, we are proposing that an 
item would be reported in the device 
cost center if it meets the following 
criteria: 
a. If required by the FDA, the device 
must have received FDA approval or 
clearance (except for a device that has 
received an FDA investigational device 
exemption (IDE) and has been classified 
as a Category B device by the FDA in

necessary for the diagnosis or treatment 
of an illness or injury or to improve the 
functioning of a malformed body part 
(as required by section 1862(a)(1)(A) of 
the Act). 
c. The device is an integral and 
subordinate part of the service 
furnished, is used for one patient only, 
comes in contact with human tissue, is 
surgically implanted or inserted through 
a natural or surgically created orifice or 
surgical incision in the body, and 
remains in the patient when the patient 
is discharged from the hospital. 
d. The device is not any of the 
following: 
• Equipment, an instrument, 
apparatus, implement, or item of this 
type for which depreciation and 
financing expenses are recovered as 
depreciable assets as defined in Chapter 
1 of the Medicare Provider 
Reimbursement Manual (CMS Pub. 15– 
1). 
• A material or supply furnished 
incident to a service (for example, a 
surgical staple, a suture, customized 
surgical kit, or clip, other than a 
radiological site marker). 
• Material that may be used to replace 
human skin (for example, a biological or 
synthetic material). 
• A medical device that is used 
during a procedure or service and does 
not remain in the patient when the 
patient is released from the hospital. 
We are proposing to select the 
existing criteria for what type of device 
qualifies for payment as a transitional 
pass-through device under the OPPS as 
a basis for instructing hospitals on what 
to report in the cost center for Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients or the cost 
center for Medical Devices Charged to 
Patients because these criteria are 
concrete and already familiar to the 
hospital community. However, the key 
difference between the existing criteria 
for devices that are eligible for pass- 
through payment under the OPPS at 
§ 419.66(b) and our proposed criteria 
stated above to be used for cost 
reporting purposes is that the device 
that is implanted remains in the patient 
when the patient is discharged from the 
hospital. Essentially, we are proposing 
to instruct hospitals to report only 
implantable devices that remain in the 
patient at discharge in the cost center 
for devices. All other devices and non- 
routine supplies which are separately 
chargeable would be reported in the 
medical supplies cost center. We believe 
that defining a device for cost reporting 
purposes based on criteria that specify 
implantation and adding that the device 
must remain in the patient upon 
discharge would have the benefit of 
capturing virtually all costly 
implantable devices (for example, 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators 
(ICDs), pacemakers, and cochlear 
implants) for which charge compression 
is a significant concern. 
However, we acknowledge that a 
definition of device based on whether 
an item is implantable and remains in 
the patient could, in some cases, 
include items that are relatively 
inexpensive (for example, urinary 
catheters, fiducial markers, vascular 
catheters, and drainage tubes), and 
which many would consider to be 
supplies. Thus, some modest amount of 
charge compression could still be 
present in the cost center for devices if 
the hospital does not have a uniform 
markup policy. In addition, requiring as 
a cost reporting criterion that the device 
is to remain in the patient at discharge 
could exclude certain technologies that 
are moderately expensive (for example, 
cryoablation probes, angioplasty 
catheters, and cardiac echocardiography 
catheters, which do not remain in the 
patient upon discharge). Therefore, 
some charge compression could 
continue for these technologies. We 
believe this limited presence of charge 
compression is acceptable, given that 
the proposed definition of device for 
cost reporting purposes would isolate 
virtually all of the expensive items, 
allowing them to be separately reported 
from most inexpensive supplies. 
The criteria we are proposing above 
for instructing hospitals as to what to 
report in the device cost center specify 
that a device is not a material or supply 
furnished incident to a service (for 
example, a surgical staple, a suture, 
customized surgical kit, or clip, other 
than a radiological site marker) 
(emphasis added). We understand that 
hospitals may sometimes receive 
surgical kits from device manufacturers 
that consist of a high-cost primary 
implantable device, external supplies 
required for operation of the device, and 
other disposable surgical supplies 
required for successful device 
implantation. Often the device and the 
attending supplies are included on a 
single invoice from the manufacturer, 
making it difficult for the hospital to 
determine the cost of each item in the 
kit. In addition, manufacturers 
sometimes include with the primary 
device other free or ‘‘bonus’’ items or 
supplies that are not an integral and 
necessary part of the device (that is, not 
actually required for the safe surgical 
implantation and subsequent operation 
of that device). (We note that 
arrangements involving free or bonus 
items or supplies may implicate the 
Federal anti-kickback statue, depending 
on the circumstances.) One option is for 
the hospital to split the total combined 
charge on the invoice in a manner that 
the hospital believes best identifies the 
cost of the device alone. However, 
because it may be difficult for hospitals 
to determine the respective costs of the 
actual device and the attending supplies 
(whether they are required for the safe 
surgical implantation and subsequent 
operation of that device or not), we are 
soliciting comments with respect to how 
supplies, disposable or otherwise, that 
are part of surgical kits should be 
reported. We are distinguishing between 
such supplies that are an integral and 
necessary part of the primary device 
(that is, required for the safe surgical 
implantation and subsequent operation 
of that device) from other supplies that 
are not directly related to the 
implantation of that device, but may be 
included by the device manufacturer 
with or without charge as ‘‘perks’’ along 
with the kit. If it is difficult to break out 
the costs and charges of these lower cost 
items that are an integral and necessary

part of the primary device, we would 
consider allowing hospitals to report the 
costs and charges of these lower cost 
supplies along with the costs and 
charges of the more expensive primary 
device in the cost report cost center for 
implantable devices. However, to the 
extent that device manufacturers could 
be encouraged to refine their invoicing 
practices to break out the charges and 
costs for the lower cost supplies and the 
higher cost primary device separately, 
so that hospitals need not ‘‘guesstimate’’ 
the cost of the device, this would 
facilitate more accurate cost reporting 
and, therefore, the calculation of more 
accurate cost-based weights. Under 
either scenario, even for an aggregated 
invoice that contains an expensive 
device, we believe that RTI’s findings of 
significant differences in supply CCRs 
for hospitals with a greater percentage of 
charges in device revenue codes 
demonstrate that breaking the Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients cost center 
into two cost centers and using 
appropriate revenue codes for devices, 
and walking those costs to the new 
Implantable Devices Charged to Patients 
cost center, will result in an increase in 
estimated device costs. 
In summary, we are proposing to 
modify the cost report to have one cost 
center for Medical Supplies Charged to 
Patients and one cost center for 
Implantable Devices Charged to 
Patients. We are proposing to instruct 
hospitals to report only devices that 
meet the four criteria listed above 
(specifically including that the device is 
implantable and remains in the patient 
at discharge) in the cost center for 
Implantable Devices Charged to 
Patients. All other devices and 
nonchargeable supplies would be 
reported in the Medical Supplies cost 
center. This would allow for two 
distinct CCRs, one for medical supplies 
and one for implantable devices and 
DME rented and DME sold. 
However, we are also soliciting 
comments on alternative approaches 
that could be used in conjunction with 
or in lieu of the four proposed criteria 
for distinguishing between what should 
be reported in the cost center for 
Implantable Devices and Medical 
Supplies, respectively. Another option 
we are considering would distinguish 
between high-cost and low-cost items 
based on a cost threshold. Under this 
methodology, we would also have one 
cost center for Medical Supplies and 
one cost center for Devices, but we 
would instruct hospitals to report items 
that are not movable equipment or a 
capital expense but are above a certain 
cost threshold in the cost center for 
Devices. Items costing below that 
threshold would be reported in the cost 
center for Medical Supplies. 
Establishing a cost threshold for cost 
reporting purposes would directly 
address the problem of charge 
compression and would enable 
hospitals to easily determine whether an 
item should be reported in the supply 
or the device cost center. A cost 
threshold would also potentially allow 
a broader variety of expensive, single 
use devices that do not remain in the 
patient at discharge to be reported in the 
device cost center (such as specialized 
catheters or ablation probes). While we 
have a number of concerns with the cost 
threshold approach, we are nevertheless 
soliciting public comments on whether 
such an approach would be worthwhile 
to pursue. Specifically, we are 
concerned that establishing a single cost 
threshold for pricing devices could 
possibly be inaccurate across hospitals. 
Establishing a threshold would require 
identifying a cost at which hospitals 
would begin applying reduced markup 
policies. Currently, we do not have data 
from which to derive a threshold. We 
have anecdotal reports that hospitals 
change their markup thresholds 
between $15,000 and $20,000 in 
acquisition costs. Recent research on 
this issue indicated that hospitals with 
average inpatient discharges in DRGs 
with supply charges greater than 
$15,000, $20,000, and $30,000 have 
higher supply CCRs (Advamed March 
2006). 
Furthermore, although a cost 
threshold directly addresses charge 
compression, it may not eliminate all 
charge compression from the device cost 
center because a fixed cost threshold 
may not accurately capture differential 
markup policies for an individual 
hospital. At the same time, we are also 
concerned that establishing a cost 
threshold may interfere with the pricing 
practices of device manufacturers in 
that the prices for certain devices or 
surgical kits could be inflated to ensure 
that the devices met the cost threshold. 
We believe our proposed approach of 
identifying a group of items that are 
relatively expensive based on the 
existing criteria for OPPS device pass- 
through payment status, rather than 
adopting a cost threshold, would not 
influence pricing by the device 
industry. In addition, if a cost threshold 
were adopted for distinguishing 
between high-cost devices and low-cost 
supplies on the cost report, we would 
need to periodically reassess the 
threshold for changes in markup 
policies and price inflation over time. 
Another option for distinguishing 
between high-cost and low-cost items 
for purposes of the cost report would be 
to divide the Medical Supplies cost 
center based on markup policies by 
placing items with lower than average 
markups in a separate cost center. This 
approach would center on 
documentation requirements for 
differential charging practices that 
would lead hospitals to distinguish 
between the reporting of supplies and 
devices on different cost report lines. 
That is, because charge compression 
results from the different markup 
policies that hospitals apply to the 
supplies and devices they use based on 
the estimated costs of those supplies 
and devices, isolating supplies and 
devices with different markup policies 
mitigates aggregation in markup policies 
that cause charge compression and is 
specific to a hospital’s internal 
accounting and pricing practices. If 
requested by the fiscal intermediaries/ 
MACs at audit, hospitals could be 
required to submit documentation of 
their markup policies to justify the way 
they have reported relatively 
inexpensive supplies on one line and 
more expensive devices on the other 
line. We believe that it should not be too 
difficult for hospitals to document their 
markup practices because, as was 
pointed out by many commenters since 
the implementation of cost-based 
weights, the source of charge 
compression is varying markup 
practices. Greater knowledge of the 
specifics of hospital markup practices 
may allow ultimately for development 
of standard cost reporting instructions 
that instruct hospitals to report an item 
as a device or a supply based on the 
type of markup applied to that item. 
This option related to markup practices, 
the proposal to define devices based on 
four specific criteria, and the third 
alternative that would establish a cost 
threshold for purposes of distinguishing 
between high-cost and low-cost items, 
could be utilized separately or in some 
combination for purposes of cost report 
modification. Again, we are soliciting 
comments on these alternative 
approaches. We are also interested in 
other recommendations for appropriate 
cost reporting improvements that 
address charge compression. 
3. Timeline for Revising the Medicare 
Cost Report 
As mentioned in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47198), we have begun a comprehensive 
review of the Medicare hospital cost 
report, and the proposed splitting of the 
current cost center for Medical Supplies 
Charged to Patients into one line for 
Medical Supplies Charged to Patients 
and another line for Implantable 
Devices Charged to Patients, is part of

23547 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
our initiative to update and revise the 
hospital cost report. Under an effort 
initiated by CMS to update the Medicare 
hospital cost report to eliminate 
outdated requirements in conjunction 
with the Paperwork Reduction Act, we 
plan to propose the actual changes to 
the cost reporting form, the attending 
cost reporting software, and the cost 
report instructions in Chapter 36 of the 
Medicare Provider Reimbursement 
Manual (PRM), Part II. We expect the 
proposed revision to the Medicare 
hospital cost report to be issued after 
publication of this IPPS proposed rule. 
If we were to adopt as final our proposal 
to create one cost center for Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients and one 
cost center for Implantable Devices 
Charged to Patients in the FY 2009 IPPS 
final rule, the cost report forms and 
instructions would reflect those 
changes. We expect the revised cost 
report would be available for hospitals 
to use when submitting cost reports 
during FY 2009 (that is, for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 2008). Because there is 
approximately a 3-year lag between the 
availability of cost report data for IPPS 
and OPPS ratesetting purposes and a 
given fiscal year, we may be able to 
derive two distinct CCRs, one for 
medical supplies and one for devices, 
for use in calculating the FY 2012 IPPS 
relative weights and the CY 2012 OPPS 
relative weights. 
4. Revenue Codes Used in the MedPAR 
File 
An important first step in RTI’s study 
(as explained in its draft interim March 
2007 report) was determining how well 
the cost report charges used to compute 
CCRs matched to the charges in the 
MedPAR file. This match (or lack 
thereof) directly affects the accuracy of 
the DRG cost estimates because 
MedPAR charges are multiplied by 
CCRs to estimate cost. RTI found 
inconsistent reporting between the cost 
reports and the claims data for charges 
in several ancillary departments 
(Medical Supplies, Operating Room, 
Cardiology, and Radiology). For 
example, the data suggested that some 
hospitals often include costs and 
charges for devices and other medical 
supplies within the Medicare cost report 
cost centers for Operating Room, 
Radiology, or Cardiology, while other 
hospitals include them in the Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients cost 
center. While the educational initiative 
undertaken by the national hospital 
associations is encouraging hospitals to 
consistently report costs and charges for 
devices and other medical supplies only 
in the Medical Supplies Charged to 
Patients cost center, equal attention 
must be paid to the way in which 
charges are grouped by hospitals in the 
MedPAR file. Several commenters on 
the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule 
supported RTI’s recommendation of 
including additional fields in the 
MedPAR file to disaggregate certain cost 
centers. One commenter stated that the 
assignment of revenue codes and 
charges to revenue centers in the 
MedPAR file should be reviewed and 
changed to better reflect hospital 
accounting practices as reflected on the 
cost report (72 FR 47198). 
In an effort to improve the match 
between the costs and charges included 
on the cost report and the charges in the 
MedPAR file, we are recommending that 
certain revenue codes be used for items 
reported in the proposed Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients cost center 
and the proposed Implantable Devices 
Charged to Patients cost center, 
respectively. Specifically, under the 
proposal to create a cost center for 
implantable devices that remain in the 
patient upon discharge, revenue codes 
0275 (Pacemaker), 0276 (Intraocular 
Lens), and 0278 (Other Implants) would 
correspond to implantable devices 
reported in the proposed Implantable 
Devices Charged to Patients cost center. 
Items for which a hospital may have 
previously used revenue code 0270 
(General Classification), but actually 
meet the proposed definition of an 
implantable device that remains in the 
patient upon discharge should instead 
be billed with the 0278 revenue code. 
Conversely, relatively inexpensive items 
and supplies that are not implantable 
and do not remain in the patient at 
discharge would be reported in the 
proposed Medical Supplies Charged to 
Patients cost center on the cost report, 
and should be billed with revenue codes 
0271 (nonsterile supply), 0272 (sterile 
supply), and 0273 (take-home supplies), 
as appropriate. Revenue code 0274 
(Prosthetic/Orthotic devices) and 
revenue code 0277 (Oxygen—Take 
Home) should be associated with the 
costs reported on lines 66 and 67 for 
DME—Rented and DME—Sold on the 
cost report. Charges associated with 
supplies used incident to radiology or to 
other diagnostic services (revenue codes 
0621 and 0622 respectively) should 
match those items used incident to 
those services on the Medical Supplies 
Charged to Patients cost center of the 
cost report, because, under this 
proposal, supplies furnished incident to 
a service would be reported in the 
Medical Supplies Charged to Patients 
cost center (see item b. listed above, in 
the proposed definition of a device). A 
revenue code of 0623 for surgical 
dressings would similarly be associated 
with the costs and charges of items 
reported in the proposed Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients cost 
center, while a revenue code of 0624 for 
FDA investigational device, if that 
device does not remain in the patient 
upon discharge, could be associated 
with items reported on the Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients cost center 
as well. 
In general, if an item is reported as an 
implantable device on the cost report, 
the associated charges should be 
recorded in the MedPAR file with either 
revenue codes 0275 (Pacemaker), 0276 
(Intraocular Lens), or 0278 (Other 
Implants). Likewise, items reported as 
Medical Supplies should receive an 
appropriate revenue code indicative of 
supplies. We understand that many of 
these revenue codes have been in 
existence for many years and have been 
added for purposes unrelated to the goal 
of refining the calculation of cost-based 
weights. Accordingly, we acknowledge 
that additional instructions relating to 
the appropriate use of these revenue 
codes may need to be issued. In 
addition, CMS or the hospital 
associations may need to request new 
revenue codes from the National 
Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC). In 
either case, we do not believe either 
should delay use of the new Medical 
Supplies and Implantable Devices CCRs 
in setting payment rates. However, in 
light of our proposal to create two 
separate cost centers for Medical 
Supplies Charged to Patients and 
Implantable Devices Charged to 
Patients, respectively, we are soliciting 
comments on how the existing revenue 
codes or additional revenue codes could 
best be used in conjunction with the 
revised cost centers on the cost report. 
F. Preventable Hospital-Acquired 
Conditions (HACs), Including Infections 
1. General 
In its landmark 1999 report ‘‘To Err is 
Human: Building a Safer Health 
System,’’ the Institute of Medicine 
found that medical errors, particularly 
hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) 
caused by medical errors, are a leading 
cause of morbidity and mortality in the 
United States. The report noted that the 
number of Americans who die each year 
as a result of medical errors that occur 
in hospitals may be as high as 98,000. 
The cost burden of HACs is also high. 
Total national costs of these errors due 
to lost productivity, disability, and 
health care costs were estimated at $17

billion to $29 billion.2 In 2000, the CDC 
estimated that hospital-acquired 
infections added nearly $5 billion to 
U.S. health care costs every year.3 A 
2007 study found that, in 2002, 1.7 
million hospital-acquired infections 
were associated with 99,000 deaths4 
Research has also shown that hospitals 
are not following recommended 
guidelines to avoid preventable 
hospital-acquired infections. A 2007 
Leapfrog Group survey of 1,256 
hospitals found that 87 percent of those 
hospitals do not follow 
recommendations to prevent many of 
the most common hospital-acquired 
infections.5 
As one approach to combating HACs, 
including infections, in 2005 Congress 
authorized CMS to adjust for Medicare 
IPPS hospital payments to encourage 
the prevention of these conditions. The 
preventable HAC provision at section 
1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act is part of an 
array of Medicare value-based 
purchasing (VBP) tools that CMS is 
using to promote increased quality and 
efficiency of care. Those tools include 
measuring performance, using payment 
incentives, publicly reporting 
performance results, applying national 
and local coverage policy decisions, 
enforcing conditions of participation, 
and providing direct support for 
providers through Quality Improvement 
Organization (QIO) activities. CMS’ 
application of VBP tools through 
various initiatives, such as this HAC 
provision, is transforming Medicare 
from a passive payer to an active 
purchaser of higher value health care 
services. We are applying these 
strategies for inpatient hospital care and 
across the continuum of care for 
Medicare beneficiaries. 
The President’s FY 2009 Budget 
outlines another approach for 
addressing serious preventable adverse 
events (‘‘never events’’), including 
HACs. The President’s Budget proposal 
would: (1) Prohibit hospitals from 
billing the Medicare program for ‘‘never 
events’’ and prohibit Medicare payment 
for these events; and (2) require 
hospitals to report occurrence of these 
events or receive a reduced annual 
payment update. 
Medicare’s IPPS encourages hospitals 
to treat patients efficiently. Hospitals 
receive the same DRG payment for stays 
that vary in length and in the services 
provided, which gives hospitals an 
incentive to avoid unnecessary costs in 
the delivery of care. In many cases, 
complications acquired in the hospital 
do not generate higher payments than 
the hospital would otherwise receive for 
uncomplicated cases paid under the 
same DRG. To this extent, the IPPS 
encourages hospitals to avoid 
complications. However, complications, 
such as infections, acquired in the 
hospital can generate higher Medicare 
payments in two ways. First, the 
treatment of complications can increase 
the cost of a hospital stay enough to 
generate an outlier payment. However, 
the outlier payment methodology 
requires that a hospital experience a 
large loss on an outlier case, which 
serves as an incentive for hospitals to 
prevent outliers. Second, under the MS– 
DRGs that took effect in FY 2008, there 
are currently 258 sets of MS–DRGs that 
are split into 2 or 3 subgroups based on 
the presence or absence of a CC or an 
MCC. If a condition acquired during a 
hospital stay is one of the conditions on 
the CC or MCC list, the hospital 
currently receives a higher payment 
under the MS–DRGs (prior to the 
October 1, 2008 effective date of the 
HAC payment provision). (We refer 
readers to section II.D. of the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period for 
a discussion of DRG reforms (72 FR 
47141).) The following is an example of 
how an MS–DRG may be paid.

2. Statutory Authority 
Section 1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act 
required the Secretary to select at least 
two conditions by October 1, 2007, that 
are: (a) High cost, high volume, or both; 
(b) assigned to a higher paying DRG 
when present as a secondary diagnosis; 
and (c) could reasonably have been 
prevented through the application of 
evidence-based guidelines. Beginning

23549 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
6 For this FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule, the DRG 
analysis is based on data from the September 2007 
update of the FY 2007 MedPAR file, which contains 
hospital bills received through September 30, 2007, 
for discharges through September 30, 2007. 
a higher paying MS–DRG if a selected 
HAC was not present on admission. 
That is, the case will be paid as though 
the secondary diagnosis was not 
present. (Medicare will continue to 
assign a discharge to a higher paying 
MS–DRG if the selected condition was 
present on admission.) Section 
1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act provides that 
the list of conditions can be revised 
from time to time, as long as the list 
contains at least two conditions. 
Beginning October 1, 2007, we required 
hospitals to begin submitting 
information on Medicare claims 
specifying whether diagnoses were 
present on admission (POA). 
The POA indicator reporting 
requirement and the HACs payment 
provision apply to IPPS hospitals only. 
At this time, non-IPPS hospitals such as 
CAHs, LTCHs, IRFs, and hospitals in 
Maryland operating under waivers, 
among others, are exempt from POA 
reporting and the HAC payment 
provision. Throughout this section, 
‘‘hospital’’ refers to IPPS hospitals. 
3. Public Input 
In the FY 2007 IPPS proposed rule (71 
FR 24100), we sought public input 
regarding conditions with evidence- 
based prevention guidelines that should 
be selected in implementing section 
1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act. The public 
comments we received were 
summarized in the FY 2007 IPPS final 
rule (71 FR 48051 through 48053). In the 
FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule (72 FR 
24716), we again sought formal public 
comment on conditions that we 
proposed to select. In the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47200 through 47218), we summarized 
the public comments we received on the 
FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule, presented 
our responses, selected eight conditions 
to which the HAC provision will 
initially apply, and noted that we would 
be seeking comments on additional 
HAC candidates in this proposed rule. 
4. Collaborative Process 
CMS experts worked with public 
health and infectious disease 
professionals from the CDC to identify 
the candidate preventable HACs. CMS 
and CDC staff also collaborated on the 
process for hospitals to submit a POA 
indicator for each diagnosis listed on 
IPPS hospital Medicare claims. 
On December 17, 2007, CMS and CDC 
hosted a jointly sponsored HAC and 
POA Listening Session to receive input 
from interested organizations and 
individuals. The agenda, presentations, 
audio file, and written transcript of the 
listening session are available on the 
Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
HospitalAcqCond/ 
07_EducationalResources.asp. CMS and 
CDC also received informal comments 
during the listening session and 
subsequently received numerous 
written comments. 
5. Selection Criteria for HACs 
CMS and CDC staff evaluated each 
candidate condition against the criteria 
established by section 1886(d)(4)(D)(iv) 
of the Act. 
• Cost or Volume—Medicare data 6 
must support that the selected 
conditions are high cost, high volume, 
or both. At this point, there are no 
Medicare claims data indicating which 
secondary diagnoses were POA because 
POA indicator reporting began only 
recently; therefore, the currently 
available data for candidate conditions 
includes all secondary diagnoses. 
• Complicating Condition (CC) or 
Major Complicating Condition (MCC)— 
Selected conditions must be represented 
by ICD–9-CM diagnosis codes that 
clearly identify the condition, are 
designated as a CC or an MCC, and 
result in the assignment of the case to 
an MS-DRG that has a higher payment 
when the code is reported as a 
secondary diagnosis. That is, selected 
conditions must be a CC or an MCC that 
would, in the absence of this provision, 
result in assignment to a higher paying 
MS-DRG. 
• Evidence-Based Guidelines— 
Selected conditions must be reasonably 
preventable through the application of 
evidence-based guidelines. By 
reviewing guidelines from professional 
organizations, academic institutions, 
and entities such as the Healthcare 
Infection Control Practices Advisory 
Committee (HICPAC), we evaluated 
whether guidelines are available that 
hospitals should follow to prevent the 
condition from occurring in the 
hospital. 
• Reasonably Preventable—Selected 
conditions must be reasonably 
preventable through the application of 
evidence-based guidelines. 
6. HACs Selected in FY 2008 and 
Proposed Changes to Certain Codes 
The HACs that were selected for the 
HAC payment provision through the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period are listed below. The payment 
provision for these selected HACs will 
take effect on October 1, 2008. We refer 
readers to section II.F.6. of the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47202 through 47218) for a detailed 
analysis supporting the selection of each 
of these HACs.

23552 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
We are seeking public comments on 
the following refinements to two of the 
previously selected HACs: 
a. Foreign Object Retained After 
Surgery: Proposed Inclusion of ICD–9– 
CM Code 998.7 (CC) 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47206), we 
indicated that a foreign body 
accidentally left in the patient during a 
procedure (ICD–9–CM code 998.4) was 
one of the conditions selected. It has 
come to our attention that ICD–9–CM 
diagnosis code 998.7 (Acute reaction to 
foreign substance accidentally left 
during a procedure) should also be 
included. ICD–9–CM code 998.7 
describes instances in which a patient 
developed an acute reaction due to a 
retained foreign substance. Therefore, 
we are proposing to make this code 
subject to the HAC payment provision. 
b. Pressure Ulcers: Proposed Changes in 
Code Assignments 
As discussed in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47205–47206), we referred the need for 
more detailed ICD–9–CM pressure ulcer 
codes to the CDC. The topic of 
expanding pressure ulcer codes to 
capture the stage of the ulcer was 
addressed at the September 27–28, 
2007, meeting of the ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee. A summary report of this 
meeting is available on the Web site at: 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/ 
otheract/icd9/maint/maint.htm. 
Numerous wound care professionals 
supported modifying the pressure ulcer 
codes to capture staging information. 
The stage of the pressure ulcer is a 
powerful predictor of severity and 
resource utilization. At its September 
27–28, 2007 meeting, the ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee discussed the creation of 
pressure ulcer codes to capture this 
information. The new codes, along with 
their proposed CC/MCC classifications, 
are shown in Table 6A of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. The 
new codes are as follows: 
• 707.20 (Pressure ulcer, unspecified 
stage). 
• 707.21 (Pressure ulcer stage I). 
• 707.22 (Pressure ulcer stage II). 
• 707.23 (Pressure ulcer stage III). 
• 707.24 (Pressure ulcer stage IV). 
While the code titles are final, we are 
soliciting comment on the proposed 
MS–DRG classifications of these codes, 
as indicated in Table 6A of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. We 
are proposing to remove the CC/MCC 
classifications from the current pressure 
ulcer codes that show the site of the 
ulcer (ICD–9–CM codes 707.00 through 
707.09). Therefore, the following codes 
would no longer be a CC: 
• 707.00 (Decubitus ulcer, 
unspecified site). 
• 707.01 (Decubitus ulcer, elbow). 
• 707.09 (Decubitus ulcer, other site). 
The following codes would no longer be 
an MCC: 
• 707.02 (Decubitus ulcer, upper 
back). 
• 707.03 (Decubitus ulcer, lower 
back). 
• 707.04 (Decubitus ulcer, hip). 
• 707.05 (Decubitus ulcer, buttock). 
• 707.06 (Decubitus ulcer, ankle). 
• 707.07 (Decubitus ulcer, heel). 
We are proposing to instead assign the 
CC/MCC classifications to the stage of 
the pressure ulcer as shown in Table 6A 
of the Addendum to this proposed rule. 
We are proposing to classify ICD–9–CM 
codes 707.23 and 707.24 as MCCs. We 
are proposing to classify codes 707.20, 
707.21, and 707.22 as non-CCs. 
Therefore, we are proposing that, 
beginning October 1, 2008, the codes 
used to make MS–DRG adjustments for 
pressure ulcers under the HAC 
provision would include the proposed 
MCC codes 707.23 and 707.24. 
7. HACs Under Consideration as 
Additional Candidates 
CMS and CDC have diligently worked 
together and with other stakeholders to 
identify additional HACs that might 
appropriately be subject to the HAC 
payment provision. If the additional 
candidate HACs are selected in the FY 
2009 IPPS final rule, the payment 
provision will take effect for these 
candidate HACS on October 1, 2008. 
The statutory criteria for each HAC 
candidate are presented in tabular 
format. Each table contains the 
following: 
• HAC Candidate—We are seeking 
public comment on all HAC candidates. 
• Medicare Data—We are seeking 
public comment on the statutory 
criterion of high cost, high volume, or 
both as it applies to the HAC candidate. 
• CC/MCC—We are seeking public 
comment on the statutory criterion that 
an ICD–9–CM diagnosis code(s) clearly 
identifies the HAC candidate. 
• Selected Evidence-Based 
Guidelines—We are seeking public 
comment on the degree to which the 
HAC candidate is reasonably 
preventable through the application of 
the identified evidence-based 
guidelines. 
a. Surgical Site Infections Following 
Elective Surgeries

23553 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47213), surgical 
site infections were identified as a broad 
category for consideration, and we 
selected mediastinitis after coronary 
artery bypass graft (CABG) as one of the 
initial eight HACs for implementation. 
We are now considering the addition of 
other surgical site infections, 
particularly those following elective 
procedures. In most cases, patients 
selected as candidates for elective 
surgeries should have a relatively low- 
risk profile for surgical site infections. 
The following elective surgical 
procedures are under consideration: 
• Total Knee Replacement (81.54): 
ICD–9–CM codes 996.66 (CC) and 
998.59 (CC) 
• Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass (44.38) 
and Laparoscopic Gastroenterostomy 
(44.39): ICD–9–CM code 998.59 (CC) 
• Ligation and Stripping of Varicose 
Veins (38.50 through 38.53, 38.55, 
38.57, and 38.59): ICD–9–CM code 
998.59 (CC) 
Evidence-based guidelines for 
preventing surgical site infections 
emphasize the importance of 
appropriately using prophylactic 
antibiotics, using clippers rather than 
razors for hair removal and tightly 
controlling postoperative glucose. 
While we are seeking public 
comments on the applicability of each 
of the statutory criteria to surgical site 
infections following elective 
procedures, we are particularly 
interested in receiving comments on the 
degree of preventability of surgical site 
infections following elective procedures 
generally, as well as specifically for 
those listed above. We also are seeking 
public comments on additional elective 
surgical procedures that would qualify 
for the HAC provision by meeting all of 
the statutory criteria. Based on the 
public comments we receive, we may 
select some combination of the four 
procedures presented here along with 
additional conditions that qualify and 
are supported by the comments. 
b. Legionnaires’ Disease 
We discussed Legionnaires’ Disease in 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47216). 
Legionnaires’ Disease is a type of 
pneumonia caused by the bacterium 
Legionella pneumophila. It is contracted

by inhaling contaminated water vapor 
or droplets. It is not spread person to 
person. Individuals at risk include those 
who are elderly, immunocompromised, 
smokers, or persons with underlying 
lung disease. The bacterium thrives in 
warm aquatic environments and 
infections have been linked to large 
industrial water systems, including 
hospital water systems such as air 
conditioning cooling towers and potable 
water plumbing systems. Prevention 
depends primarily on regular 
monitoring and decontamination of 
these water systems. While we are 
seeking public comments regarding the 
applicability of each of the statutory 
criteria to Legionnaires’ Disease, we are 
particularly interested in receiving 
comments on the degree of 
preventability of Legionnaires’ Disease 
through the application of hospital 
water system maintenance guidelines. 
Legionnaires’ Disease is typically 
acquired outside of the hospital setting 
and may be difficult to diagnose as 
present on admission. We are seeking 
comments on the degree to which 
hospital-acquired Legionnaires’ Disease 
can be distinguished from community- 
acquired cases. 
We also are seeking public comments 
on additional water-borne pathogens 
that would qualify for the HAC 
provision by meeting the statutory 
criteria. Based on the public comments 
we receive, we may finalize some 
combination of Legionnaires’ Disease 
and additional conditions that qualify 
and are supported by the public 
comments. 
c. Glycemic Control 
During the December 17, 2007 HAC 
and POA Listening Session, one of the 
commenters suggested that we explore 
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia as 
HACs for selection. NQF’s list of Serious 
Reportable Adverse Events includes 
death or serious disability associated 
with hypoglycemia that occurs during 
hospitalization. 
Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are 
extremely common laboratory findings 
in hospitalized patients and can be 
complicating features of underlying 
diseases and some therapies. However, 
we believe that extreme forms of poor 
glycemic control should not occur while 
under medical care in the hospital 
setting. Thus, we are considering 
whether the following forms of extreme 
glucose derangement should be subject 
to the HAC payment provision: 
• Diabetic Ketoacidosis: ICD–9–CM 
codes 250.10–250.13 (CC) 
• Nonketotic Hyperosmolar Coma: 
ICD–9–CM code 251.0 (CC) 
• Diabetic Coma: ICD–9–CM codes 
250.30–250.33 (CC) 
• Hypoglycemic Coma: ICD–9–CM 
codes 250.30–251.0 (CC) 
While we are seeking public 
comments regarding the applicability of 
each of the statutory criteria to these 
extreme aberrations in glycemic control, 
we are particularly interested in 
receiving comments on the degree to 
which these extreme aberrations in 
glycemic control are reasonably 
preventable, in the hospital setting, 
through the application of evidence- 
based guidelines. Based on the public 
comments we receive, we may select 
some combination of these glycemic 
control-related conditions as HACs. 
d. Iatrogenic Pneumothorax 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 19:42 Apr 29, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\30APP2.SGM 30APP2 EP

23555 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Iatrogenic pneumothorax refers to the 
accidental introduction of air into the 
pleural space, which is the space 
between the lung and the chest wall. 
When air is introduced into this space 
it partially or completely collapses the 
lung. Iatrogenic pneumothorax can 
occur during any procedure where there 
is the possibility of air entering pleural 
space, including needle biopsy of the 
lung, thoracentesis, central venous 
catheter placement, pleural biopsy, 
tracheostomy, and liver biopsy. 
Iatrogenic pneumothorax can occur 
secondary to positive pressure 
mechanical ventilation when an air sac 
in the lung ruptures allowing air into 
the pleural space. 
While we are seeking public 
comments on the applicability of each 
of the statutory criteria to iatrogenic 
pneumothorax, we are particularly 
interested in receiving comments on the 
degree to which iatrogenic 
pneumothorax is reasonably preventable 
through the application of evidence- 
based guidelines. Based on the public 
comments we receive, we may select 
iatrogenic pneumothorax as an HAC. 
e. Delirium 
Delirium is a relatively abrupt 
deterioration in a patient’s ability to 
sustain attention, learn, or reason. 
Delirium is strongly associated with 
aging and treatment of illnesses that are 
associated with hospitalizations. 
Delirium affects nearly half of hospital 
patient days for individuals age 65 and 
older, and approximately three-quarters 
of elderly individuals in intensive care 
units have delirium. About 14 to 24 
percent of hospitalized elderly 
individuals have delirium at the time of 
admission. Having delirium is a very 
serious risk factor, with 1-year mortality 
of 35 to 40 percent, a rate as high as 
those associated with heart attacks and 
sepsis. The adverse effects of delirium 
routinely last for months. Delirium is a 
clinical diagnosis, commonly assisted 
by screening tests such as the Confusion 
Assessment Method. 
Well-established practices, such as 
reducing certain medications, 
reorienting the patient, assuring sensory 
input and sleep, and avoiding 
malnutrition and dehydration, prevent 
30 to 40 percent of the possible cases. 
While we are seeking public comments 
on the applicability of each of the 
statutory criteria to delirium, we are 
particularly interested in receiving 
comments on the degree to which 
delirium is reasonably preventable 
through the application of evidence- 
based guidelines. Based upon the public 
comments we receive, we may select 
delirium as an HAC. 
f. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia 
(VAP)

7 American Association for Respiratory Care 
Clinical Practice: Guideline: Care of the Ventilator 
Circuit and Its Relation to Ventilator Associated 
Pneumonia. Available at the Web site: http:// 
www.rcjournal.com/cpgs/09.03.0869.html. 
8 Ramirez et al.: Prevention Measures for 
Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: A New Focus on 
the Endotracheal Tube. Current Opinion in 
Infectious Disease, April 2007, Vol.20 (2), pp. 190– 
197. 
9 Safdar et al.: The Pathogenesis of Ventilator- 
Associated Pneumonia: Its Relevance to Developing 
Effective Strategies for Prevention. Respiratory 
Care, June 2005, Vol. 50, No. 6, pp.725–741. 
We discussed ventilator-associated 
pneumonia (VAP) in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47209–47210). VAP is a serious 
hospital-acquired infection associated 
with high mortality, significantly 
increased hospital length of stay, and 
high cost. It is typically caused by the 
aspiration of contaminated gastric and/ 
or oropharyngeal secretions. The 
presence of an endotracheal tube 
facilitates both the contamination of 
secretions as well as aspiration. 
During the past year, the ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee discussed the creation of a 
new ICD–9–CM code 997.31 to identify 
VAP. This new code is shown in Table 
6A of the Addendum to this proposed 
rule. The lack of a specific code was one 
of the barriers to including VAP as an 
HAC that we discussed in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period. 
We also discussed the degree to which 
VAP may be reasonably preventable 
through the application of evidence- 
based guidelines. Specifically, the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period referenced the American 
Association for Respiratory Care’s 
Clinical Practice Guidelines at the Web 
site: http://www.rcjournal.com/cpgs/ 
09.03.0869.html. 
To further investigate the extent to 
which VAP is reasonably preventable, 
we reviewed published clinical 
research. The literature, including 
recommendations by CDC and the 
HICPAC, from 2003 shows numerous 
prevention guidelines that can 
significantly reduce the incidence of 
VAP in the hospital setting. These 
guidelines include interventions such as 
educating staff, hand washing, using 
gowns and gloves, properly positioning 
the patient, elevating the head of the 
bed, changing ventilator tubing, 
sterilizing reusable equipment, applying 
chlorhexadine solution for oral 
decontamination, monitoring sedation 
daily, administering stress ulcer 
prophylaxis, and administering 
pneumococcal vaccinations. Further 
review of the literature, specifically 
regarding the proportion of VAP cases 
that might be preventable, revealed two 
large-scale analyses that were completed 
recently. One study concluded that an 
estimated 40 percent of VAP cases are 
preventable. A second study concluded 
that at least 20 percent of nosocomial 
infections in general (not just VAP) are 
preventable.7 
During the December 17, 2007 HAC 
and POA Listing Session, we also 
received comments on evidence-based 
guidelines for preventing VAP. 
Commenters referenced two articles 8 9 
that both state there is a high degree of 
risk associated with endotracheal tube 
insertions, suggesting that VAP may not 
always be preventable. 
While we are seeking public 
comments on the applicability of each 
of the statutory criteria to VAP, we are 
particularly interested in receiving 
comment on the degree to which VAP

is reasonably preventable through the 
application of evidence-based 
guidelines. Based on the public 
comments we receive, we may select 
VAP as an HAC. 
g. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/ 
Pulmonary Embolism (PE) 
We discussed deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47215). DVT 
and PE are common events. DVT occurs 
when a blood clot forms in the deep 
veins of the leg and causes local 
swelling and inflammation. PE occurs 
when a clot or a piece of a clot migrates 
from its original site into the lungs, 
causing the death of lung tissue, which 
can be fatal. Risk factors for DVTs and 
PEs include inactivity, smoking, use of 
oral contraceptives, prolonged bed rest, 
prolonged sitting with bent knees, 
certain types of cancer and other disease 
states, certain blood clotting disorders, 
and certain types of orthopedic and 
other surgical procedures. DVT is not 
always clinically apparent because the 
manifestations of pain, redness, and 
swelling may develop some time after 
the venous clot forms. 
As we discussed in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period, DVTs 
and PEs may be preventable in certain 
circumstances, but it is possible that a 
patient may have a DVT that is difficult 
to detect on admission. We also 
received comments during the 
December 17, 2007 HAC and POA 
Listening Session reiterating that not all 
cases of DVTs and PEs are preventable. 
For example, common patient 
characteristics such as immobility, 
obesity, severe vessel trauma, and 
venous stasis put certain trauma and 
joint replacement surgery patients at 
high risk for these conditions. 
In our review of the literature, we 
found that there are definite 
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic 
interventions that may reduce the 
likelihood of developing DVTs and PEs, 
including exercise, compression 
stockings, intermittent pneumatic boots, 
aspirin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, heparin, 
coumadin, clopidogrel, and 
fondaparinux. However, the 
evidenceπbased guidelines indicate that 
some patients may still develop clots 
despite these therapies. 
While we are seeking public 
comments on the applicability of each 
of the statutory criteria to DVTs and 
PEs, we are particularly interested in 
receiving comments on the degree of 
preventability of DVTs and PEs. We are 
also interested in comments on 
determining the presence of DVT and 
PE at admission. Based on the public 
comments we receive, we may select 
DVTs and PEs as HACs.

23558 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
10 Jensen, A.G. Importance of Focus Identification 
in the Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus 
Bacteremia. 2002. Vol. 52, pp. 29–36. 
We discuss Staphylococcus aureus 
Septicemia in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
47208). Staphylococcus aureus is a 
bacterium that lives in the nose and on 
the skin of a large percentage of the 
population. It usually does not cause 
physical illness, but it can cause 
infections ranging from superficial boils 
to cellulitis to pneumonia to life 
threatening bloodstream infections 
(septicemia). It usually enters the body 
through traumatized tissue, such as cuts 
or abrasions, or at the time of invasive 
procedures. Staphylococcus aureus 
Septicemia can also be a late effect of an 
injury or a surgical procedure. Risk 
factors for developing Staphylococcus 
aureus Septicemia include advanced 
age, debilitated state, 
immunocompromised status, and a 
history of an invasive medical 
procedure. 
CDC has developed evidence-based 
guidelines for the prevention of the 
Staphylococcus aureus Septicemia. 
Most preventable cases of septicemia are 
primarily related to the presence of a 
central venous or vascular catheter. 
During the December 17, 2007 HAC and 
POA Listening Session, commenters 
noted that intravascular catheter- 
associated infections are only one cause 
of septicemia. Therefore, catheter- 
oriented evidence-based guidelines 
would not cover all cases of 
Staphylococcus aureus Septicemia.10 
We identified evidence-based 
guidelines that suggest Staphylococcus 
aureus Septicemia is reasonably 
preventable. These guidelines 
emphasize the importance of effective 
and fastidious hand washing by both 
staff and visitors, using gloves and 
gowns where appropriate, applying 
proper decontamination techniques, and 
exercising contact isolation where 
clinically indicated. 
While we are seeking public 
comments on the applicability of each 
of the statutory criteria to 
Staphylococcus aureus infections 
generally, we are particularly interested 
in receiving comments on the degree of 
preventability of Staphylococcus aureus 
infections generally, and specifically 
Staphylococcus aureus Septicemia. 
Based on the public comments we 
receive, we may select Staphylococcus 
aureus Septicemia as an HAC. 
i. Clostridium Difficile-Associated 
Disease (CDAD) 
We discussed Clostridium difficile- 
associated disease (CDAD) in the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period. Clostridium difficile is a 
bacterium that colonizes the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract of a certain 
number of healthy people. Under 
conditions where the normal flora of the 
gastrointestinal tract is altered, 
Clostridium difficile can flourish and 
release large enough amounts of a toxin 
to cause severe diarrhea or even life 
threatening colitis. Risk factors for 
CDAD include prolonged use of broad 
spectrum antibiotics, gastrointestinal 
surgery, prolonged nasogastric tube 
insertion, and repeated enemas. CDAD 
can be acquired in the hospital or in the 
community. Its spores can live outside 
of the body for months and thus can be 
spread to other patients in the absence 
of meticulous hand washing by care 
providers and others who contact the 
infected patient. 
We continue to receive strong support 
in favor of selecting CDAD as an HAC. 
During the December 17, 2007 HAC and 
POA Listening Session, representatives 
of consumers and purchasers advocated 
to include CDAD as an HAC. 
The evidence-based guidelines for 
CDAD prevention emphasize that hand 
washing by staff and visitors and 
effective decontamination of 
environmental surfaces prevent the 
spread of Clostridium difficile. While 
we are seeking public comments on the 
applicability of each of the statutory 
criteria to CDADs, we are particularly 
interested in receiving comments on the 
degree of preventability of CDAD. Based 
on the public comments we receive, we 
may select CDAD as an HAC.

aureus (MRSA)

23559 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
11 Kuehnert, M.J., et al.: Prevalence of 
Staphylococcusa aureus Nasal Colonization in the 
United States, 2001-2002. The Journal of Infectious 
Disease, January 15, 2006; Vol. 193. 
We discussed the special case of 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47212). In October 2007, the CDC 
published in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association an 
article citing high mortality rates from 
MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant 
‘‘superbug.’’ The article estimates 
19,000 people died from MRSA 
infections in the United States in 2005. 
The majority of invasive MRSA cases 
are health care-related—contracted in 
hospitals or nursing homes—though 
community-acquired MRSA also poses a 
significant public health concern. 
Hospitals have been focused for years 
on controlling MRSA through the 
application of CDC’s evidence-based 
guidelines outlining best practices for 
combating the bacterium in that setting. 
MRSA is currently addressed by the 
HAC payment provision. For every 
infectious condition selected, MRSA 
could be the etiology of that infection. 
For example, if MRSA were the cause of 
a vascular catheter-associated infection 
(one of the eight conditions selected in 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period), the HAC payment 
provision would apply to that MRSA 
infection. 
As we noted in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period, colonization 
by MRSA is not a reasonably 
preventable HAC according to the 
current evidence-based guidelines; 
therefore, MRSA does not meet the 
reasonably preventable statutory 
criterion for an HAC. An estimated 32.4 
percent of Americans are colonized with 
MRSA, which may reside in the nose or 
on the skin of asymptomatic carriers.11 
In addition, in last year’s final rule with 
comment period, we noted that there is 
no CC/MCC code available for MRSA, 
and therefore it also does not meet the 
codeable CC/MCC statutory criterion for 
an HAC. Only when MRSA causes an 
infection does a codeable condition 
occur. However, we referenced the 
possibility that new codes for MRSA 
were being considered by the ICD–9– 
CM Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee. The creation of unique 
codes to capture MRSA was discussed 
during the March 19–20, 2008 
Committee meeting. While these codes 
will enhance the data available and our 
understanding of MRSA, the availability 
and use of these codes will not change 
the fact that the mere presence of MRSA 
as a colonizing bacterium does not 
constitute an HAC. 
Because MRSA as a bacterium does 
not meet two of our statutory criteria, 
codeable CC/MCC and reasonably 
preventable through evidence-based 
guidelines, we are not proposing MRSA 
as an HAC. However, we recognize the 
significant public health concerns that 
were raised by representatives of 
consumers and purchasers at the HAC 
and POA Listening Session, and we are 
committed to reducing the spread of 
multi-drug resistant organisms, such as 
MRSA. 
In addition, we are pursuing 
collaborative efforts with other HHS 
agencies to combat MRSA. The Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality 
(AHRQ) has launched a new initiative 
in collaboration with CDC and CMS to 
identify and suppress the spread of 
MRSA and related infections. In support 
of this work, Congress has appropriated 
$5 million to fund research, 
implementation, management, and 
evaluation practices that mitigate such 
infections. 
CDC has carried out extensive 
research on the epidemiology of MRSA 
and effective techniques that could be 
used to treat the infection and reduce its 
spread. The following Web sites contain 
information that reflect CDC’s 
commitment: (1) http://www.cdc.gov/ 
ncidod/dhqp/ar_mrsa.html (health care- 
associated MRSA); (2) http:// 
www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ 
ar_mrsa_ca_public.html (community- 
acquired MRSA); (3) http:// 
www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/ 
mmwrhtml/mm4908a1.htm; and (4) 
http://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/. 
AHRQ has made previous 
investments in systems research to help 
monitor MRSA and related infections in 
hospital settings, as reflected in material 
on the Web site at: http:// 
www.guideline.gov/browse/ 
guideline_index.aspx and http:// 
www.ahrq.gov/clinic/ptsafety/pdf/ 
ptsafety.pdf. 
8. Present on Admission (POA) 
Indicator Reporting 
POA indicator information is 
necessary to identify which conditions 
were acquired during hospitalization for 
the HAC payment provision and for 
broader public health uses of Medicare 
data. Through Change Request No. 5679 
(released June 20, 2007), CMS issued 
instructions requiring IPPS hospitals to 
submit the POA indicator data for all 
diagnosis codes on Medicare claims. 
Specific instructions on how to select 
the correct POA indicator for each 
diagnosis code are included in the ICD– 
9–CM Official Guidelines for Coding 
and Reporting, available at the Web site: 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/datawh/

reporting guidelines begin on page 92). 
Additional instructions, including 
information regarding CMS’s phased 
implementation of POA indicator 
reporting and application of the POA 
reporting options, are available at the 
Web site: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
HospitalAcqCond. 
There are five POA indicator 
reporting options: ‘‘Y,’’ ‘‘N,’’ ‘‘W,’’ ‘‘U,’’ 
and ‘‘1.’’ Under the HAC payment 
provision, we are proposing to pay the 
CC/MCC MS–DRGs only for those HACs 
coded as ‘‘Y’’ and ‘‘W’’ indicators. The 
‘‘Y’’ option indicates that the condition 
was present on admission. The ‘‘W’’ 
indicator affirms that the provider has 
determined, based on data and clinical 
judgment, that it is not possible to 
document when the onset of the 
condition occurred. We expect that this 
approach will encourage better 
documentation and promote the public 
health goals of POA reporting by 
providing more accurate data about the 
occurrence of HACs in the Medicare 
population. We anticipate that true 
clinical uncertainty will occur in only a 
very small number of cases. We plan to 
analyze how frequently the ‘‘W’’ 
indicator is used, and we leave open the 
possibility of proposing in future IPPS 
rulemaking not paying the CC/MCC 
MS–DRGs for HACs coded with the 
‘‘W’’ indicator. In addition, we plan to 
analyze whether both the ‘‘Y’’ and ‘‘W’’ 
indicators are being used appropriately. 
Medicare program integrity initiatives 
closely monitor for inaccurate coding 
and coding that is inconsistent with 
medical record documentation. We are 
seeking public comments regarding the 
proposed treatment of the ‘‘Y’’ and ‘‘W’’ 
POA reporting options under the HAC 
payment provision. 
We are proposing to not pay the CC/ 
MMC MS–DRGs for HACs coded with 
the ‘‘N’’ indicator. The ‘‘N’’ option 
indicates that the condition was not 
present on admission. We are also 
proposing to not pay the CC/MCC MS– 
DRGs for HACs coded with the ‘‘U’’ 
indicator. The ‘‘U’’ option indicates that 
the medical record documentation is 
insufficient to determine whether the 
condition was present at the time of 
admission. Not paying for the CC/MCC 
MS–DRGs for HACs that are coded with 
the ‘‘U’’ indicator is expected to foster 
better medical record documentation. 
Although we are proposing not paying 
the CC/MCC MS–DRG for HACs coded 
with the ‘‘U’’ indicator, we do recognize 
there may be some exceptional 
circumstances under which payment 
might be made. Death, elopement 
(leaving against medical advice), and 
transfers out of a hospital may preclude 
making an informed determination of 
whether an HAC was present on 
admission. We are seeking public 
comments on the potential use of the 
following current patient discharge 
status codes to identify the exceptional 
circumstances: 
PATIENT DISCHARGE STATUS CODES 
Form locator code Code descriptor 
Exception for Patient Death 
20 ............................... Expired. 
Exception for Patient Elopement (Leaving Against Medical Device) 
7 ................................. Left against medical advice or discontinued care. 
Exception for Transfer 
02 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a short-term general hospital for inpatient care. 
03 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) with Medicare certification in anticipation of skilled care. 
04 ............................... Discharged/transferred to an intermediate care facility (ICF). 
05 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a designated cancer center or children’s hospital. 
06 ............................... Discharged/transferred to home under care of organized home health service organization. 
43 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a Federal health care facility. 
50 ............................... Hospice-home. 
51 ............................... Hospice-medical facility (certified) providing hospice level of care. 
61 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a hospital-based Medicare approved swing bed. 
62 ............................... Discharged/transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) including rehabilitation distinct part units of a hospital. 
63 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a Medicare certified long term care hospital (LTCH). 
64 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a nursing facility certified under Medicaid but not certified under Medicare. 
65 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric distinct part unit of a hospital. 
66 ............................... Discharged/transferred to a critical access hospital (CAH). 
70 ............................... Discharged/transferred to another type of health care institution not otherwise defined in this code list. 
We plan to analyze whether both the 
‘‘N’’ and ‘‘U’’ POA reporting options are 
being used appropriately. The American 
Health Information Management 
Association (AHIMA) has promulgated 
Standards of Ethical Coding that require 
accurate coding regardless of the 
payment implications of the diagnoses. 
That is, diagnoses must be reported 
accurately regardless of their effect on 
payment. Medicare program integrity 
initiatives closely monitor for inaccurate 
coding and coding inconsistent with 
medical record documentation. We are 
seeking public comments regarding the 
proposal to not pay the CC/MCC MS– 
DRGs for HACs coded with ‘‘N’’ and 
‘‘U’’ indicators. 
9. Enhancement and Future Issues 
The preventable HAC payment 
provision is one of CMS’ VBP 
initiatives, as noted earlier in this 
section. VBP ties payment to 
performance through the use of 
incentives based on quality measures 
and cost of care. The implementation of 
VBP is rapidly transforming CMS from 
being a passive payer of claims to an 
active purchaser of higher quality, more 
efficient health care for Medicare 
beneficiaries. Other VBP initiatives 
include hospital pay for reporting (the 
RHQDAPU program discussed in 
section IV.B. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule), physician pay for 
reporting (the Physician Quality 
Reporting Initiative), home health pay 
for reporting, the Hospital VBP Plan 
Report to Congress (discussed in section 
IV.C. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule), and various VBP demonstration

programs across payment settings, 
including the Premier Hospital Quality 
Incentive Demonstration and the 
Physician Group Practice 
Demonstration. 
The success of CMS’ VBP initiatives 
depends in large part on the validity of 
the performance measures and on the 
effectiveness of incentives in driving 
desired changes in behavior that will 
result in greater quality and efficiency. 
We are committed to enhancing the 
Medicare VBP programs, in close 
collaboration with stakeholders, to 
fulfill VBP’s potential to promise of 
promoting higher value health care for 
Medicare beneficiaries. It is in this spirit 
that we seek public comment on 
enhancements to the preventable HACs 
payment policy and to concomitant 
POA indicator reporting. 
We welcome all public comments 
presenting ideas and models for 
combating preventable HACs through 
the application of VBP principles. To 
stimulate reflection and creativity, we 
present several options: 
• Risk adjustment could be applied to 
make the HAC payment provision more 
precise. 
• Rates of HACs could be collected to 
obtain a more robust longitudinal 
measure of a hospital’s incidence of 
these conditions. 
• POA information could be used in 
various ways to decrease the incidence 
of preventable HACs. 
• The adoption of ICD–10–PCS could 
facilitate more precise identification of 
HACs. 
• The principle behind the HAC 
payment provision (Medicare not 
paying more for preventable HACs) 
could be applied to Medicare payments 
in settings of care other than the IPPS. 
• CMS is using authority other than 
the HAC payment provision to address 
other events on the NQF’s list of Serious 
Reportable Adverse Events. 
We note that we are not proposing 
new Medicare policy in this 
Enhancements and Future Issues 
discussion, as some of these approaches 
may require new statutory authority. 
a. Risk Adjustment 
To make the HAC payment provision 
more precise, the adjustments to 
payment made when one of the selected 
HACs occurs during the hospitalization 
could be further adjusted to account for 
patient-specific risk factors. The 
expected occurrence of an HAC may be 
greater or lesser depending on the 
health status of the patient, as reflected 
by severity of illness, presence of 
comorbidities, or other factors. Rather 
than not paying any additional amount 
for the complication, the additional 
payment for the complication could 
range from zero for the lowest risk 
patient to the full amount for the highest 
risk patient. An option may be 
individualized adjustment for every 
hospitalization based on the patient’s 
unique characteristics, but state-of-the- 
art risk adjustment currently precludes 
such individualized adjustment. 
b. Rates of HACs 
Given our limited capability at 
present for precise patient-level risk 
adjustment, adding a consideration of 
risk to the criteria for selecting HACs 
could be an alternative. If primarily 
high-risk patients are acquiring a certain 
condition during hospitalization, that 
condition could be considered a less-fit 
candidate for selection. Other 
alternatives to precise individualized 
risk adjustment could be adjustment for 
overall facility case mix or facility case- 
mix by condition. At the highest level, 
national Medicare program data could 
be used to make adjustments to the 
payment implications for the selected 
HACs based on expected rates of 
complications. Another option could be 
to designate certain patient risk factors 
as exemptions that would prohibit or 
mitigate the application of the HAC 
payment policy to the claims of patients 
with those risk factors. 
The Medicare Hospital VBP Plan was 
submitted in a Report to Congress on 
November 21, 2007. The plan includes 
a performance assessment model that 
scores a hospital’s attainment or 
improvement on various measures. The 
scores for each measure would be 
summed within each domain, such as 
the clinical process of care domain or 
the patient experience domain, and then 
the domains would be weighted and 
summed to yield a total performance 
score. The total performance score 
would then be translated into an 
incentive payment, proposed to be a 
certain percentage of each MS–DRG 
payment, using an exchange function. 
The plan also calls for public reporting 
of hospitals’ performance scores by 
domain and in total. (Section IV.C. of 
this preamble included a related 
discussion of the Hospital VBP Plan 
Report to Congress.) 
In accordance with this hospital VBP 
model, a hospital’s rates of HACs could 
be included as a domain within each 
hospital’s total performance score. The 
measurement of rates over time could be 
a more meaningful, actionable, and fair 
way to adjust a hospital’s MS–DRG 
payments for the incidence of HACs. 
The consequence of a higher incidence 
of measured conditions would be a 
lower VBP incentive payment. Public 
reporting of the measured rates of HACs 
would give hospitals an additional, 
nonfinancial incentive to prevent 
occurrence of the conditions to avoid 
lower public ratings. 
c. Use of POA Information 
Information obtained from hospitals’ 
reporting of POA data could be used in 
various ways to better understand and 
prevent the occurrence of HACs. The 
POA information could be provided to 
health services researchers to analyze 
factors that lead to HACs and 
disseminate the best practices for 
prevention of HACs. At least two states, 
New York and California, already 
collect POA data from their hospitals. 
Comparison of the State POA data with 
the Medicare data could fill in gaps in 
the databases and yield valuable 
insights about POA data validity. 
POA data could also be used to 
calculate the incidence of HACs by 
hospital. This application of the POA 
data would be particularly powerful if 
the Medicare POA data were combined 
with state or private sector payer POA 
data. The Medicare-only or combined 
quality of care information could be 
initially shared with hospitals and 
thereafter publicly reported to support 
better healthcare decision making by 
Medicare beneficiaries, other health care 
consumers, professionals, and 
caregivers. 
d. Transition to ICD–10–PCS 
Accurate identification of HACs 
requires unambiguous and precise 
diagnosis codes. The current ICD–9–CM 
diagnosis coding system is three 
decades old. It is outdated and contains 
numerous instances of broad and vague 
codes. Attempts to add necessary detail 
to the ICD–9–CM system are inhibited 
by lack of expansion capacity. These 
factors negatively affect CMS’ attempts 
to identify HAC cases. 
ICD–10–PCS codes are more precise 
and capture information using more 
current medical terminology. For 
example, ICD–9–CM codes for pressure 
ulcers do not provide information about 
the size, depth, or exact location of the 
ulcer, while ICD–10–PCS has 60 codes 
to capture this information. ICD–10– 
PCS would also provide codes, beyond 
the current ICD–9–CM codes, that 
would enable the selection of additional 
surgical complications and adverse drug 
events. 
e. Application of Nonpayment for HACs 
to Other Settings 
The broad principle of Medicare not 
paying for preventable health care- 
associated conditions could potentially 
be applied to Medicare payment settings 
other than IPPS hospitals. Other

possible settings of care might include 
hospital outpatient departments, SNFs, 
HHAs, end-stage renal disease facilities, 
and physician practices. The 
implications would be different for each 
setting, as each payment system is 
different and the reasonable 
preventability through the application 
of evidence-based guidelines would 
vary for candidate conditions over the 
different settings. However, alignment 
of incentives across settings of care is an 
important goal for all of CMS’ VBP 
initiatives, including the HAC 
provision. 
A related application of the broad 
principle behind the HAC payment 
could be accomplished through 
modification to the Medicare secondary 
payer policy which would allow us to 
directly recoup from the provider that 
failed to prevent the occurrence of a 
preventable condition in one setting to 
pay for all or part of the necessary 
followup care in a second setting. This 
would help shield the Medicare 
program from inappropriately paying for 
the downstream effects of a preventable 
condition acquired in the first setting 
but treated in the second setting. 
f. Relationship to NQF’s Serious 
Reportable Adverse Events 
CMS is applying its authority to 
address the events on the NQF’s list of 
Serious Reportable Adverse Events (also 
known as ‘‘never events’’). In May 2006 
testimony before the Senate Finance 
Committee, the CMS Administrator 
noted that paying hospitals for serious 
preventable events is contrary to the 
promise that hospital payments should 
support higher quality and efficiency. 
There is growing consensus that health 
care purchasers should not be paying for 
these events when they occur during a 
hospitalization. In January 2005, 
HealthPartners, a Minnesota-based not- 
for-profit HMO, announced that it 
would no longer reimburse hospitals for 
services associated with events 
enumerated in the Minnesota Adverse 
Health Care Events Reporting Act 
(essentially the NQF’s list of Serious 
Reportable Adverse Events). Further, 
HealthPartners’ contracts preclude 
hospitals from seeking reimbursement 
from the patient for these costs. During 
2007, several State hospital associations 
adopted policies stating that their 
members will not bill payers or patients 
when these events occur in their 
hospitals. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we adopted several 
items from the NQF’s list of events as 
HACs, including retained foreign object 
after surgery, air embolism, blood 
incompatibility, stage III and IV 
pressure ulcers, falls, electric shock, and 
burns. In this proposed rule, we are 
seeking public comments regarding 
adding hypoglycemic coma, which is 
closely related to NQF’s listing of death 
or serious disability associated with 
hypoglycemia. However, as we 
discussed in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period, the HAC 
payment provision is not ideally suited 
to address every condition on the NQF’s 
list of Serious Reportable Adverse 
Events. To address the events on the 
NQF’s list beyond the effect of the HAC 
policy, CMS is exploring the application 
of Medicare authority, including other 
payment provisions, coverage policy, 
conditions of participation, and Quality 
Improvement Organization (QIO) 
retrospective review. 
We note that we are not proposing 
new Medicare policy in this discussion 
of the HAC payment provision for IPPS 
hospitals, as some of these approaches 
may require new statutory authority. We 
are seeking public comments on these 
and other options for enhancing the 
preventable HACs payment provision 
and maximizing the use of POA 
indicator reporting data. We look 
forward to working with stakeholders in 
the fight against HACs. 
G. Proposed Changes to Specific MS– 
DRG Classifications 
1. Pre-MDCs: Artificial Heart Devices 
Heart failure affects more than 5 
million patients in the United States 
with 550,000 new cases each year, and 
causes more than 55,000 deaths 
annually. It is a progressive disease that 
is medically managed at all stages, but 
over time leads to continued 
deterioration of the heart’s ability to 
pump sufficient amounts of adequately 
oxygenated blood throughout the body. 
When medical management becomes 
inadequate to continue to support the 
patient, the patient’s heart failure would 
be considered to be the end stage of the 
disease. At this point, the only 
remaining treatment options are a heart 
transplant or mechanical circulatory 
support. A device termed an artificial 
heart has been used only for severe 
failure of both the right and left 
ventricles, also known as biventricular 
failure. Relatively small numbers of 
patients suffer from biventricular 
failure, but the exact numbers are 
unknown. There are about 4,000 
patients approved and waiting to 
receive heart transplants in the United 
States at any given time, but only about 
2,000 hearts per year are transplanted 
due to a scarcity of donated organs. 
There are a number of mechanical 
devices that may be used to support the 
ventricles of a failing heart on either a 
temporary or permanent basis. When it 
is apparent that a patient will require 
long-term support, a ventricular support 
device is generally implanted and may 
be considered either as a bridge to 
recovery or a bridge to transplantation. 
Sometimes a patient’s prognosis is 
uncertain, and with device support the 
native heart may recover its function. 
However when recovery is not likely, 
the patient may qualify as a transplant 
candidate and require mechanical 
circulatory support until a donor heart 
becomes available. This type of support 
is commonly supplied by ventricular 
assist devices, (VADs), which are 
surgically attached to the native 
ventricles but do not replace them. 
Devices commonly called artificial 
hearts are biventricular heart 
replacement systems that differ from 
VADs in that a substantial part of the 
native heart, including both ventricles, 
is removed. When the heart remains 
intact, it remains possible for the native 
heart to recover its function after being 
assisted by a VAD. However, because 
the artificial heart device requires the 
resection of the ventricles, the native 
heart is no longer intact and such 
recovery is not possible. The 
designation ‘‘artificial heart’’ is 
somewhat of a misnomer because some 
portion of the native heart remains and 
there is no current mechanical device 
that fully replaces all four chambers of 
the heart. Over time, better descriptive 
language for these devices may be 
adopted. 
In 1986, CMS made a determination 
that the use of artificial hearts was not 
covered under the Medicare program. 
To conform to that decision, we placed 
ICD–9–CM procedure code 37.52 
(Implantation of total replacement heart 
system) on the GROUPER program’s 
MCE in the noncovered procedure list. 
On August 1, 2007, CMS began a 
national coverage determination process 
for artificial hearts. SynCardia Systems, 
Inc. submitted a request for 
reconsideration of the longstanding 
noncoverage policy when its device, the 
CardioWest Temporary Total Artificial 
Heart (TAH–t) System, is used for 
‘‘bridge to transplantation’’ in 
accordance with the FDA-labeled 
indication for the device. ‘‘Bridge to 
transplantation’’ is a phrase meaning 
that a patient in end-stage heart failure 
may qualify as a heart transplant 
candidate, but will require mechanical 
circulatory support until a donor heart 
becomes available. The CardioWest 
TAH–t System is indicated for use as a 
bridge to transplantation in cardiac 
transplant-eligible candidates at risk of 
imminent death from biventricular

failure. The system is intended for use 
inside the hospital as the patient awaits 
a donor heart. The ultimate desired 
outcome for insertion of the TAH–t is a 
successful heart transplant, along with 
the potential that offers for cure from 
heart failure. 
CMS determined that a broader 
analysis of artificial heart coverage was 
deemed appropriate, as another 
manufacturer, Abiomed, Inc. has 
developed an artificial heart device, 
AbioCor Implantable Replacement 
Heart Device, with different indications. 
SynCardia Systems, Inc has received 
approval of its device from the FDA for 
humanitarian use as destination therapy 
for patients in end-stage biventricular 
failure who cannot qualify as transplant 
candidates. The AbioCor Implantable 
Replacement Heart Device is indicated 
for use in severe biventricular end-stage 
heart disease patients who are not 
cardiac transplant candidates and who 
are less than 75 years old, who require 
multiple inotropic support, who are not 
treatable by VAD destination therapy, 
and who cannot be weaned from 
biventricular support if they are on such 
support. The desired outcome for this 
device is prolongation of life and 
discharge to home. 
On February 1, 2008, CMS published 
a proposed coverage decision 
memorandum for artificial hearts which 
stated, in part, that while the evidence 
is inadequate to conclude that the use 
of an artificial heart is reasonable and 
necessary for Medicare beneficiaries, the 
evidence is promising for the uses of 
artificial heart devices as described 
above. CMS supports additional 
research for these devices, and therefore 
proposed that the artificial heart will be 
covered by Medicare when performed 
under the auspices of a clinical study. 
The study must meet all of the criteria 
listed in the proposed decision 
memorandum. This proposed coverage 
decision memorandum may be found on 
the CMS Web site at: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/ 
viewdraftdecisionmemo.asp?id=211. 
Following consideration of the public 
comments received, CMS expects to 
make a final decision on or about May 
1, 2008. 
The topic of coding of artificial heart 
devices was discussed at the September 
27–28, 2007 ICD–9–CM Coordination 
and Maintenance Committee meeting 
held at CMS in Baltimore, MD. We note 
that this topic was placed on the 
Committee’s agenda because any 
proposed changes to the ICD–9–CM 
coding system must be discussed at a 
Committee meeting, with opportunity 
for comment from the public. At the 
September 2007 Committee meeting, the 
Committee accepted oral comments 
from participants and encouraged 
attendees or anyone with an interest in 
the topic to comment on proposed 
changes to the code, inclusion terms, or 
exclusion terms. We accepted written 
comments until October 12, 2007. As a 
result of discussion and comment from 
the Committee meeting, the Committee 
revised the title of procedure code 37.52 
for artificial hearts to read 
‘‘Implantation of internal biventricular 
heart replacement system.’’ In addition, 
the Committee created new code 37.55 
(Removal of internal biventricular heart 
replacement system) to identify 
explantation of the artificial heart prior 
to heart transplantation. 
To make conforming changes to the 
IPPS system with regard to the proposed 
revision to the coverage decision for 
artificial hearts, in this proposed rule, 
we are proposing to remove procedure 
code 37.52 from MS–DRG 215 (Other 
Heart Assist System Implant) and assign 
it to MS–DRG 001 (Heart Transplant or 
Implant of Heart Assist System with 
Major Comorbidity or Complication 
(MCC)) and MS–DRG 002 (Heart 
Transplant or Implant of Heart Assist 
System without Major Comorbidity or 
Complication (MCC)). In addition, we 
are proposing to remove procedure code 
37.52 from the MCE ‘‘Non-Covered 
Procedure’’ edit and assign it to the 
‘‘Limited Coverage’’ edit. We are 
proposing to include in this proposed 
edit the requirement that ICD–9–CM 
diagnosis code V70.7 (Examination of 
participant in clinical trial) also be 
present on the claim. We are proposing 
that claims submitted without both 
procedure code 37.52 and diagnosis 
code V70.7 would be denied because 
they would not be in compliance with 
the proposed coverage policy. 
During FY 2008, we are making mid- 
year changes to portions of the 
GROUPER program that do not affect 
MS–DRG assignment or ICD–9–CM 
coding. However, as the proposed 
coverage decision memorandum for 
artificial hearts was published after the 
CMS contractor’s testing and release of 
the mid-year product, the above 
proposed changes to the MCE will not 
be included in that revision of the 
GROUPER Version 25.0. GROUPER 
Version 26.0, which will be in use for 
FY 2009, will contain the proposed 
changes if they are approved. If the 
proposed revisions to the MCE are 
accepted, the edits in the MCE Version 
25.0 will be effective retroactive to May 
1, 2008. (To reduce confusion, we note 
that the version number of the MCE is 
one digit lower than the current 
GROUPER version number; that is, 
Version 26.0 of the GROUPER uses 
Version 25.0 of the MCE.) 
2. MDC 1 (Diseases and Disorders of the 
Nervous System) 
a. Transferred Stroke Patients Receiving 
Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) 
In 1996, the FDA approved the use of 
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), one 
type of thrombolytic agent that dissolves 
blood clots. In 1998, the ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee created code 99.10 (Injection 
or infusion of thrombolytic agent) in 
order to be able to uniquely identify the 
administration of these agents. Studies 
have shown that tPA can be effective in 
reducing the amount of damage the 
brain sustains during an ischemic 
stroke, which is caused by blood clots 
that block blood flow to the brain. tPA 
is approved for patients who have blood 
clots in the brain, but not for patients 
who have a bleeding or hemorrhagic 
stroke. Thrombolytic therapy has been 
shown to be most effective when used 
within the first 3 hours after the onset 
of an embolic stroke, but it is 
contraindicated in hemorrhagic strokes. 
For FY 2006, we modified the 
structure of CMS DRGs 14 (Intracranial 
Hemorrhage or Cerebral Infarction) and 
15 (Nonspecific CVA and Precerebral 
Occlusion without Infarction) by 
removing the diagnostic ischemic 
(embolic) stroke codes. We created a 
new CMS DRG 559 (Acute Ischemic 
Stroke with Use of Thrombolytic Agent) 
which increased reimbursement for 
patients who sustained an ischemic or 
embolic stroke and who also had 
administration of tPA. The intent of this 
DRG was not to award higher payment 
for a specific drug but to recognize the 
need for better overall care for this 
group of patients. Even though tPA is 
indicated only for a small proportion of 
stroke patients, that is, those patients 
experiencing ischemic strokes treated 
within 3 hours of the onset of 
symptoms, our data suggested that there 
was a sufficient quantity of patients to 
support the DRG change. While our goal 
is to make payment relate more closely 
to resource use, we also note that use of 
tPA in a carefully selected patient 
population may lead to better outcomes 
and overall care and may lessen the 
need for postacute care. 
For FY 2008, with the adoption of 
MS–DRGs, CMS DRG 559 became MS– 
DRGs 061 (Acute Ischemic Stroke with 
Use of Thrombolytic Agent with MCC), 
062 (Acute Ischemic Stroke with Use of 
Thrombolytic Agent with CC), and 063 
(Acute Ischemic Stroke with Use of 
Thrombolytic Agent without CC/MCC).

agent was administered were grouped to 
MS–DRGs 064 (Intracranial Hemorrhage 
or Cerebral Infarction with MCC), 065 
(Intracranial Hemorrhage or Cerebral 
Infarction with CC), or 066 (Intracranial 
Hemorrhage or Cerebral Infarction 
without CC/MCC). The MS–DRGs that 
reflect use of a thrombolytic agent, that 
is, MS–DRGs 061, 062, and 063, have 
higher relative weights than the 
hemorrhagic or cerebral infarction MS– 
DRGs 064, 065, and 066. 
The American Society of 
Interventional and Therapeutic 
Neuroradiology (ASITN) has made us 
aware of a treatment issue that is of 
concern to the stroke provider’s 
community. In some instances, patients 
suffering an embolytic or thrombolytic 
stroke are evaluated and given tPA in a 
community hospital’s emergency 
department, and then are transferred to 
a larger facility’s stroke center that is 
able to provide the level of services 
required by the increased severity of 
these cases. The facility providing the 
administration of tPA in its emergency 
department does not realize increased 
reimbursement, as the patient is often 
transferred as soon a possible to a stroke 
center. The facility to which the patient 
is transferred does not realize increased 
reimbursement, as the tPA was not 
administered there. The ASITN has 
requested that CMS give permission to 
code the administration of tPA as if it 
had been given in the receiving facility. 
This would result in the receiving 
facility being paid the higher weighted 
MS–DRGs 061, 062, or 063 instead of 
MS–DRGs 064, 065, or 066. The 
ASITN’s rationale is that the patients 
who received tPA in another facility 
(even though administration of tPA may 
have alleviated some of the worst 
consequences of their strokes) are still 
extremely compromised and require 
increased health care services that are 
much more resource consumptive than 
patients with less severe types of stroke. 
We have advised the ASITN that 
hospitals may not report services that 
were not performed in their facility. 
We recognize that the ASITN’s 
concerns potentially have merit but the 
quantification of the increased resource 
consumption of these patients is not 
currently possible in the existing ICD– 
9–CM coding system. Without specific 
length of stay and average charges data, 
we are unable to determine an 
appropriate MS–DRG for these cases. 
Therefore, we have advised the ASITN 
to present a request at the diagnostic 
portion of the ICD–9–CM Coordination 
and Maintenance Committee meeting on 
March 20, 2008, for a code that would 
recognize the fact that the patient had 
received a thrombolytic agent for 
treatment of the current stroke. If this 
request is presented at the March 20, 
2008 meeting, it will not be approved in 
time to be published as a final code in 
this proposed rule. However, if a 
diagnosis code is created by the 
National Centers for Health Statistics as 
a result of that meeting, it can be added 
to the list of codes published in the FY 
2009 IPPS final rule that will go into 
effect on October 1, 2008. With such 
information appearing on subsequent 
claims, we will have a better idea of 
how to classify these cases within the 
MS–DRGs. Therefore, because we lack 
the data to identify these patients, we 
are not proposing an MS–DRG 
modification for the stroke patients 
receiving tPA in one facility prior to 
being transferred to another facility. 
b. Intractable Epilepsy With Video 
Electroencephalogram (EEG) 
As we did for FY 2008, we received 
a request from an individual 
representing the National Association of 
Epilepsy Centers to consider further 
refinements to the MS–DRGs describing 
seizures. Specifically, the representative 
recommended that a new MS–DRG be 
established for patients with intractable 
epilepsy who receive an 
electroencephalogram with video 
monitoring (vEEG) during their hospital 
stay. Similar to the initial 
recommendation, the representative 
stated that patients who suffer from 
uncontrolled seizures or intractable 
epilepsy are admitted to an epilepsy 
center for a comprehensive evaluation 
to identify the epilepsy seizure type, the 
cause of the seizure, and the location of 
the seizure. These patients are admitted 
to the hospital for 4 to 6 days with 24- 
hour monitoring that includes the use of 
EEG video monitoring along with 
cognitive testing and brain imaging 
procedures. 
Effective October 1, 2007, MS–DRG 
100 (Seizures with MCC) and MS–DRG 
101 (Seizures without MCC) were 
implemented as a result of refinements 
to the DRG system to better recognize 
severity of illness and resource 
utilization. Once again, the 
representative applauded CMS for 
making changes in the DRG structure to 
better recognize differences in patient 
severity. However, the representative 
stated that a subset of patients in MS– 
DRG 101 who have a primary diagnosis 
of intractable epilepsy and are treated 
with vEEG are substantially more costly 
to treat than other patients in this MS– 
DRG and represent the majority of 
patients being evaluated by specialized 
epilepsy centers. Alternatively, the 
representative stated that he was not 
requesting any change in the structure 
of MS–DRG 100. According to the 
representative, the number of cases that 
would fall into this category is not 
significant. The representative further 
noted that this is a change from last 
year’s request. 
Epilepsy is currently identified by 
ICD–9–CM diagnosis codes 345.0x 
through 345.9x. There are two fifth 
digits that may be assigned to a subset 
of the epilepsy codes depending on the 
physician documentation: 
• ‘‘0’’ for without mention of 
intractable epilepsy. 
• ‘‘1’’ for with intractable epilepsy. 
With the assistance of an outside 
reviewer, the representative analyzed 
cost data for MS–DRGs 100 and 101, 
which focused on three subsets of 
patients identified with a primary 
diagnosis of epilepsy or convulsions 
who also received vEEG (procedure 
code 89.19): 
• Patients with a primary diagnosis of 
epilepsy with intractability specified 
(codes 345.01 through 345.91). 
• Patients with a primary diagnosis of 
epilepsy without intractability specified 
(codes 345.00 through 345.90). 
• Patients with a primary diagnosis of 
convulsions (codes 780.39). 
The representative acknowledged that 
the association did not include any 
secondary diagnoses in its analyses. 
Based on its results, the representative 
recommended that CMS further refine 
MS–DRG 101 by subdividing cases with 
a primary diagnosis of intractable 
epilepsy (codes 345.01 through 345.91) 
when vEEG (code 89.19) is also 
performed into a separate MS–DRG that 
would be defined as ‘‘MS–DRG XXX’’ 
(Epilepsy Evaluation without MCC). 
According to the representative, these 
cases are substantially more costly than 
the other cases within MS–DRG 101 and 
are consistent with the criteria for 
dividing MS–DRGs on the basis of CCs 
and MCCs. In addition, the 
representative stated that the request 
would have a minimal impact on most 
hospitals but would substantially 
improve the accuracy of payment to 
hospitals specializing in epilepsy care. 
We performed an analysis using FY 
2007 MedPAR data. As shown in the 
table below, we found a total of 54,060 
cases in MS–DRG 101 with average 
charges of $14,508 and an average 
length of stay of 3.69 days. There were 
879 cases with intractable epilepsy and 
vEEG with average charges of $19,227 
and an average length of stay of 5 days.

In applying the criteria to establish 
subgroups, the data do not support the 
creation of a new subdivision for MS– 
DRG 101 for cases with intractable 
epilepsy and vEEG nor does the data 
support moving the 879 cases from MS– 
DRG 101 to MS–DRG 100. Moving the 
879 cases to MS–DRG 100 would mean 
moving cases with average charges of 
approximately $19,000 into an MS–DRG 
with average charges of $28,000. 
Therefore, we are not proposing to 
refine MS–DRG 101 by subdividing 
cases with a primary diagnosis of 
intractable epilepsy (codes 345.01 
through 345.91) when vEEG (code 
89.19) is also performed into a separate 
MS–DRG. 
3. MDC 5 (Diseases and Disorders of the 
Circulatory System) 
a. Automatic Implantable Cardioverter- 
Defibrillators (AICD) Lead and 
Generator Procedures 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47257), we 
created a separate, stand alone DRG for 
automatic implantable cardioverter- 
defibrillator (AICD) generator 
replacements and defibrillator lead 
replacements. The new MS–DRG 245 
(AICD lead and generator procedures) 
contains the following codes: 
• 00.52, Implantation or replacement 
of transvenous lead [electrode] into left 
ventricular coronary venous system. 
• 00.54, Implantation or replacement 
of cardiac resynchronization 
defibrillator pulse generator device only 
[CRT–D]. 
• 37.95, Implantation of automatic 
cardioverter/defibrillator leads(s) only. 
• 37.96, Implantation of automatic 
cardioverter/defibrillator pulse 
generator only. 
• 37.97, Replacement of automatic 
cardioverter/defibrillator leads(s) only. 
• 37.98, Replacement of automatic 
cardioverter/defibrillator pulse 
generator only. 
Commenters on the FY 2008 IPPS 
proposed rule supported this new MS– 
DRG, which recognizes the distinct 
differences in resource utilization 
between pacemaker and defibrillator 
generators and leads, but suggested that 
CMS should consider additional 
refinements for the defibrillator 
generator and leads. In reviewing the 
standardized charges for the AICD leads, 
the commenter believed that the leads 
may be more appropriately assigned to 
another DRG such as MS–DRG 243 
(Permanent Cardiac Pacemaker Implant 
with CC) or MS–DRG 258 (Cardiac 
Pacemaker Device Replacement with 
MCC). The commenter recommended 
that CMS consider moving the 
defibrillator leads back into a pacemaker 
DRG, either MS–DRG 243 or MS–DRG 
258. 
In response to the commenters, we 
indicated that the data supported 
separate DRGs for these very different 
devices (72 FR 47257). We indicated 
that moving the defibrillator leads back 
into a pacemaker MS–DRG defeated the 
purpose of creating separate MS–DRGs 
for defibrillators and pacemakers. 
Therefore, we finalized MS–DRG 245 as 
proposed with the leads and generator 
codes listed above. 
After publication of the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period, we 
received a request from a manufacturer 
that recommended a subdivision for 
MS–DRG 245 (AICD Lead and Generator 
Procedures). The requestor suggested 
creating a new MS–DRG to separate the 
implantation or replacement of the 
AICD leads from the implantation or 
replacement of the AICD pulse 
generators to better recognize the 
differences in resource utilization for 
these distinct procedures. 
The requestor applauded CMS’ 
decision to create separate MS–DRGs for 
the pacemaker device procedures from 
the AICD procedures in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule (72 FR 47257). The 
requestor further acknowledged its 
support of the clinically distinct MS– 
DRGs for pacemaker devices. Currently, 
MS–DRGs 258 and 259 (Cardiac 
Pacemaker Device Replacement with 
MCC and without MCC, respectively) 
describe the implantation or 
replacement of pacemaker generators 
while MS–DRGs 260, 261, and 262 
(Cardiac Pacemaker Revision Except 
Device Replacement with MCC, with 
CC, without CC/MCC, respectively) 
describe the insertion or replacement of 
pacemaker leads. 
The requestor believed that the IPPS 
‘‘needs to continue to evolve to 
accurately reflect clinical differences 
and costs of services.’’ As such, the 
requestor recommended that CMS 
follow the same structure as it did with 
the pacemaker MS–DRGs for MS–DRG 
245 to separately identify the 
implantation or replacement of the 
defibrillator leads (codes 37.95, 37.97, 
and 00.52) from the implantation or 
replacement of the pulse generators 
(codes 37.96, 37.98, 00.54). 
In our analysis of the FY 2007 
MedPAR data, we found a total of 5,546 
cases in MS–DRG 245 with average 
charges of $62,631 and an average 
length of stay of 3.3 days. We found 
1,894 cases with implantation or 
replacement of the defibrillator leads 
(codes 37.95, 37.97, and 00.52) with 
average charges of $42, 896 and an 
average length of stay of 3.4 days. We 
also found a total of 3,652 cases with 
implantation or replacement of the 
pulse generator (codes 37.96, 37.98, 
00.54) with average charges of $72, 866 
and an average length of stay of 3.2 
days. 
We agree with the requestor that the 
IPPS should accurately recognize 
differences in resource utilization for 
clinically distinct procedures. As the 
data demonstrate, average charges for 
the implantation or replacement of the 
AICD pulse generators are significantly 
higher than for the implantation or 
replacement of the AICD leads. 
Therefore, we are proposing to create a 
new MS–DRG 265 to separately identify 
these distinct procedures. The proposed 
new MS–DRG 265 would be titled 
‘‘AICD Lead Procedures’’ and would 
include procedure codes that identify 
the AICD leads (codes 37.95, 37.97 and 
00.52). The title for MS–DRG 245 would 
be revised to ‘‘AICD Generator 
Procedures’’ and include procedure 
codes 37.96, 37.98, 00.54. We believe 
these changes would better reflect the 
clinical differences and resources 
utilized for these distinct procedures.

b. Left Atrial Appendage Device 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the primary 
cardiac abnormality associated with 
ischemic or embolytic stroke. Most 
ischemic strokes associated with AF are 
possibly due to an embolism or 
thrombus that has formed in the left 
atrial appendage. Evidence from studies 
such as transesophageal 
echocardiography shows left atrial 
thrombi to be more frequent in AF 
patients with ischemic stroke as 
compared to AF patients without stroke. 
While anticoagulation medication can 
be efficient in ischemic stroke 
prevention, there can be problems of 
safety and tolerability in many patients, 
especially those older than 75 years. 
Chronic warfarin therapy has been 
proven to reduce the risk of embolism 
but there can be difficulties concerning 
its administration. Frequent blood tests 
to monitor warfarin INR are required at 
some cost and patient inconvenience. In 
addition, because warfarin INR is 
affected by a large number of drug and 
dietary interactions, it can be 
unpredictable in some patients and 
difficult to manage. The efficacy of 
aspirin for stroke prevention in AF 
patients is less clear and remains 
controversial. With the known disutility 
of warfarin and the questionable 
effectiveness of aspirin, a device-based 
solution may provide added protection 
against thromboembolism in certain 
patients with AF. 
At the April 1, 2004 ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee meeting, a proposal was 
presented for the creation of a unique 
procedure code describing insertion of 
the left atrial appendage filter system. 
Subsequently, ICD–9–CM code 37.90 
(Insertion of left atrial appendage 
device) was created for use beginning 
October 1, 2004. This code was 
designated as a non-operating room 
(non-O.R.) procedure, and had an effect 
only on cases in MDC 5, CMS DRG 518 
(Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure 
without Coronary Artery Stent or Acute 
Myocardial Infarction). With the 
adoption of MS–DRGs in FY 2008, CMS 
DRG 518 was divided into MS–DRGs 
250 and 251 (Percutaneous 
Cardiovascular Procedure without 
Coronary Artery Stent or AMI with 
MCC, and without MCC, respectively). 
We have reviewed the data 
concerning this procedure code 
annually. Using FY 2005 MedPAR data 
for the FY 2007 IPPS final rule, 24 cases 
were reported, and the average charges 
($27,620) closely mimicked the average 
charges of the other 22,479 cases in 
CMS DRG 518 ($28,444). As the charges 
were comparable, we made no 
recommendations to change the CMS 
DRG assignment for FY 2007. 
Using FY 2006 MedPAR data for the 
FY 2008 final rule with comment 
period, we divided CMS DRG 518 into 
the cases that would be reflected in the 
MS–DRG configuration; that is, we 
divided the cases based on the presence 
or absence of an MCC. There were 35 
cases without an MCC with average 
charges of $24,436, again mimicking the 
38,002 cases with average charges of 
$32,546. There were 3 cases with MCC 
with average charges of $62,337, 
compared to the 5,458 cases also with 
an MCC with average charges of 
$53,864. Again it was deemed that cases 
with code 37.90 were comparable to the 
rest of the cases in CMS DRG 518, and 
the decision was made not to make any 
changes in the DRG assignment for this 
procedure code. As noted above, CMS 
DRG 518 became MS–DRGs 250 and 251 
in FY 2008. 
We have received a request regarding 
code 37.90, and its placement within 
the MS–DRG system for FY 2009. The 
requestor asked for either the 
reassignment of code 37.90 to an MS– 
DRG that would adequately cover the 
costs associated with the complete 
procedure or the creation of a new MS– 
DRG that would reimburse hospitals 
adequately for the cost of the device. 
The requestor, a manufacturer’s 
representative, reported that the 
device’s IDE clinical trial is nearing 
completion, with the conclusion of 
study enrollment in May 2008. The 
requestor will continue to enroll 
patients in a Continued Use Registry 
following completion of the trial. The 
requestor reported that it did not charge 
hospitals for the atrial appendage 
device, estimated to cost $6,000, during 
the trial period, but it will begin to 
charge hospitals upon the completion of 
the trial in May. The requestor provided 
us with its data showing what it 
believed to be a differential of $107 
more per case than the payment average 
for MS–DRG 250, and a shortfall of 
$3,808 per case than the payment 
average for MS–DRG 251. 
The requestor pointed out that code 
37.90 is assigned to both MS–DRGs 250 
and 251, but stated that the final MS– 
DRG assignment would be MS–DRG 251 
when the patient has a principal 
diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (code 
427.31) because AF is not presently 
listed as a CC or an MCC. We would 
take this opportunity to note that the 
principal diagnosis is used to determine 
assignment of a case to the correct MDC. 
Secondary or additional diagnosis codes 
are the only codes that can be used to 
determine the presence of a CC or an 
MCC. 
With regard to the request to create a 
specific DRG for the insertion of this 
device entitled ‘‘Percutaneous 
Cardiovascular Procedures with 
Implantation of a Left Atrial Appendage 
Device without CC/MCC’’, we would 
point out that the payments under a 
prospective payment system are 
predicated on averages. The device is 
already assigned to MS–DRGs 
containing other percutaneous 
cardiovascular devices; to create a new 
MS–DRG specific to this device would 
be to remove all other percutaneously 
inserted devices and base the MS–DRG 
assignment solely on the presence of 
code 37.90. This approach negates our 
longstanding method of grouping like 
procedures, and removes the concept of 
averaging. Further, to ignore the 
structure of the MS–DRG system solely 
for the purpose of increasing payment 
for one device would set an unwelcome 
precedent for defining all of the other 
MS–DRGs in the system. We would also 
point out that the final rule establishing 
the MS–DRGs set forth five criteria, all 
five of which are required to be met, in 
order to warrant creation of a CC or an 
MCC subgroup within a base MS–DRG. 
The criteria can be found in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47169). One of the criteria specifies 
that there will be at least 500 cases in 
the CC or MCC subgroup. To date, there 
are not enough cases of code 37.90 
reported within the MedPAR data. 
Using FY 2007 MedPAR data, for this 
FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule, we 
reviewed MS–DRGs 250 and 251 for the 
presence of the left atrial appendage 
device. The following table displays our 
results:

There were a total of 105 cases with 
code 37.90 reported for Medicare 
beneficiaries in the 2007 MedPAR data. 
There are 4 cases with an atrial 
appendage device in MS–DRG 250 that 
have higher average charges than the 
other 6,420 cases in the MS–DRG, and 
that have slightly shorter lengths of stay 
by 1.25 days. However, the more telling 
data are located in MS–DRG 251, which 
shows that the 101 cases in which an 
atrial appendage device was implanted 
have much lower average charges 
($20,846.09) than the other 39,355 cases 
in the MS–DRG, with average charges of 
$35,758.98. The difference in the 
average charges is approximately 
$14,912, so even when the manufacturer 
begins charging the hospitals the 
estimated $6,000 for the device, there is 
still a difference of approximately 
$8,912 in average charges based on the 
comparison within the total MS–DRG 
251. Interestingly, the 101 cases also 
have an average length of stay of less 
than half of the average length of stay 
compared to the other cases assigned to 
that MS–DRG. 
Because the data do not support either 
the creation of a unique MS–DRG or the 
assignment of procedure code 37.90 to 
another higher-weighted MS–DRG, we 
are not proposing any change to MS– 
DRGs 250 and 251, or to code 37.90 for 
FY 2009. We believe, based on the past 
3 year’s comparisons, that this code is 
appropriately located within the MS– 
DRG structure. 
4. MDC 8 (Diseases and Disorders of the 
Musculoskeletal System and Connective 
Tissue): Hip and Knee Replacements 
and Revisions 
For FY 2009, we again received a 
request from the American Association 
of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS), a 
specialty group within the American 
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons 
(AAOS), concerning modifications of 
the lower joint procedure MS–DRGs. 
The request is similar, in some respects, 
to the AAHKS’s request in FY 2008, 
particularly as it relates to separating 
routine and complex procedures. For 
the benefit of the reader, we are 
republishing a history of the 
development of DRGs for hip and knee 
replacements and a summary of the 
AAHKS FY 2008 request that were 
included in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47222 
through 47224) before we discuss the 
AAHKS’s more recent request. 
a. Brief History of Development of Hip 
and Knee Replacement Codes 
In the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 FR 
47303), we deleted CMS DRG 209 
(Major Joint and Limb Reattachment 
Procedures of Lower Extremity) and 
created two new CMS DRGs: 544 (Major 
Joint Replacement or Reattachment of 
Lower Extremity) and 545 (Revision of 
Hip or Knee Replacement). The two new 
CMS DRGs were created because 
revisions of joint replacement 
procedures are significantly more 
resource intensive than original hip and 
knee replacements procedures. CMS 
DRG 544 included the following 
procedure code assignments: 
• 81.51, Total hip replacement. 
• 81.52, Partial hip replacement. 
• 81.54, Total knee replacement. 
• 81.56, Total ankle replacement. 
• 84.26, Foot reattachment. 
• 84.27, Lower leg or ankle 
reattachment. 
• 84.28, Thigh reattachment. 
CMS DRG 545 included the following 
procedure code assignments: 
• 00.70, Revision of hip replacement, 
both acetabular and femoral 
components. 
• 00.71, Revision of hip replacement, 
acetabular component. 
• 00.72, Revision of hip replacement, 
femoral component. 
• 00.73, Revision of hip replacement, 
acetabular liner and/or femoral head 
only. 
• 00.80, Revision of knee replacement, 
total (all components). 
• 00.81, Revision of knee replacement, 
tibial component. 
• 00.82, Revision of knee replacement, 
femoral component. 
• 00.83, Revision of knee replacement, 
patellar component. 
• 00.84, Revision of knee replacement, 
tibial insert (liner). 
• 81.53, Revision of hip replacement, 
not otherwise specified 
• 81.55, Revision of knee 
replacement, not otherwise specified 
Further, we created a number of new 
ICD–9–CM procedure codes effective 
October 1, 2005, that better distinguish 
the many different types of joint 
replacement procedures that are being 
performed. In the FY 2006 IPPS final 
rule (70 FR 47305), we indicated a 
commenter had requested that, once we 
receive claims data using the new 
procedure codes, we closely examine 
data from the use of the codes under the 
two new CMS DRGs to determine if 
future additional DRG modifications are 
needed. 
b. Prior Recommendations of the 
AAHKS 
Prior to this year, the AAHKS had 
recommended that we make further 
refinements to the CMS DRGs for knee 
and hip arthroplasty procedures. The 
AAHKS previously presented data to 
CMS on the important differences in 
clinical characteristics and resource 
utilization between primary and 
revision total joint arthroplasty 
procedures. The AAHKS stated that 
CMS’s decision to create a separate DRG 
for revision of total joint arthroplasty 
(TJA) in October 2005 resulted in more 
equitable reimbursement for hospitals 
that perform a disproportionate share of 
complex revision of TJA procedures, 
recognizing the higher resource 
utilization associated with these cases. 
The AAHKS stated that this important 
payment policy change led to increased 
access to care for patients with failed 
total joint arthroplasties, and ensured 
that high volume TJA centers could 
continue to provide a high standard of 
care for these challenging patients. 
The AAHKS further stated that the 
addition of new, more descriptive ICD– 
9–CM diagnosis and procedure codes 
for TJA in October 2005 gave it the 
opportunity to further analyze 
differences in clinical characteristics 
and resource intensity among TJA 
patients and procedures. Inclusive of 
the preparatory work to submit its 
recommendations, the AAHKS 
compiled, analyzed, and reviewed 
detailed clinical and resource utilization 
data from over 6,000 primary and 
revision TJA procedure codes from 4 
high volume joint arthroplasty centers 
located within different geographic 
regions of the United States: University 
of California, San Francisco, CA; Mayo 
Clinic, Rochester, MN; Massachusetts 
General Hospital, Boston, MA; and the 
Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, 
NY. Based on its analysis, the AAHKS 
recommended that CMS examine 
Medicare claims data and consider the 
creation of separate DRGs for total hip 
and total knee arthroplasty procedures. 
The AAHKS stated that based on the 
differences between patient

characteristics, procedure 
characteristics, resource utilization, and 
procedure code payment rates between 
total hip and total knee replacements, 
separate DRGs were warranted. 
Furthermore, the AAHKS recommended 
that CMS create separate base DRGs for 
routine versus complex joint revision or 
replacement procedures as shown 
below. 
Routine Hip Replacements 
• 00.73, Revision of hip replacement, 
acetabular liner and/or femoral head 
only. 
• 00.85, Resurfacing hip, total, 
acetabulum and femoral head. 
• 00.86, Resurfacing hip, partial, 
femoral head. 
• 00.87, Resurfacing hip, partial, 
acetabulum. 
• 81.51, Total hip replacement. 
• 81.52, Partial hip replacement. 
• 81.53, Revision of hip replacement, 
not otherwise specified. 
Complex Hip Replacements 
• 00.70, Revision of hip replacement, 
both acetabular and femoral 
components. 
• 00.71, Revision of hip replacement, 
acetabular component. 
• 00.72, Revision of hip replacement, 
femoral component. 
Routine Knee Replacements and Ankle 
Procedures 
• 00.83, Revision of knee 
replacement, patellar component. 
• 00.84, Revision of knee 
replacement, tibial insert (liner). 
• 81.54, Revision of knee 
replacement, not otherwise specified. 
• 81.55, Revision of knee 
replacement, not otherwise specified. 
• 81.56, Total ankle replacement. 
Complex Knee Replacements and Other 
Reattachments 
• 00.80, Revision of knee 
replacement, total (all components). 
• 00.81, Revision of knee 
replacement, tibial component. 
• 00.82, Revision of knee 
replacement, femoral component. 
• 84.26, Foot reattachment. 
• 84.27, Lower leg or ankle 
reattachment. 
• 84.28, Thigh reattachment. 
The AAHKS also recommended the 
continuation of CMS DRG 471 (Bilateral 
or Multiple Major Joint Procedures of 
Lower Extremity) without 
modifications. CMS DRG 471 included 
any combination of two or more of the 
following procedure codes: 
• 00.70, Revision of hip replacement, 
both acetabular and femoral 
components. 
• 00.80, Revision of knee 
replacement, total (all components). 
• 00.85, Resurfacing hip, total, 
acetabulum and femoral head. 
• 00.86, Resurfacing hip, partial, 
femoral head. 
• 00.87, Resurfacing hip, partial, 
acetabulum. 
• 81.51, Total hip replacement. 
• 81.52, Partial hip replacement. 
• 81.54, Total knee replacement. 
• 81.56, Total ankle replacement. 
c. Adoption of MS–DRGs for Hip and 
Knee Replacements for FY 2008 and 
AAHKS’s Recommendations 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47222 through 
47226), we adopted MS–DRGs to better 
recognize severity of illness for FY 2008. 
The MS–DRGs include two new severity 
of illness levels under the then current 
base DRG 544. We also added three new 
severity of illness levels to the base DRG 
for Revision of Hip or Knee 
Replacement. The new MS–DRGs are as 
follows: 
• MS–DRG 466 (Revision of Hip or 
Knee Replacement with MCC) 
• MS–DRG 467 (Revision of Hip or 
Knee Replacement with CC) 
• MS–DRG 468 (Revision of Hip or 
Knee Replacement without CC/MCC) 
• MS–DRG 469 (Major Joint 
Replacement or Reattachment of Lower 
Extremity with MCC) 
• MS–DRG 470 (Major Joint 
Replacement or Reattachment of Lower 
Extremity without MCC) 
We found that the MS–DRGs greatly 
improved our ability to identify joint 
procedures with higher resource costs. 
In the final rule, we presented data 
indicating the average charges for each 
new MS–DRG for the joint procedures. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we acknowledged the 
valuable assistance the AAHKS had 
provided to CMS in creating the new 
joint replacement procedure codes and 
modifying the joint replacement DRGs 
beginning in FY 2006. These efforts 
greatly improved our ability to 
categorize significantly different groups 
of patients according to severity of 
illness. Commenters on the FY 2008 
proposed rule had encouraged CMS to 
continue working with the orthopedic 
community, including the AAHKS, to 
monitor the need for additional new 
DRGs. The commenters stated that MS– 
DRGs 466 through 470 are a good first 
step. However, they stated that CMS 
should continue to evaluate the data for 
these procedures and consider 
additional refinements to the MS–DRGs, 
including the need for additional 
severity levels. AAHKS stated that its 
data suggest that all three base DRGs 
(primary replacement, revision of major 
joint replacement, and bilateral joint 
replacement) should be separated into 
three severity levels (that is, MCC, CC, 
and non-CC). (We had proposed three 
severity levels for revision of hip and 
knee replacement (MS–DRGs 466, 467, 
and 468), and AAHKS agreed with this 
3-level subdivision.) 
The AAHKS recommended that the 
base DRG for the proposed two severity 
subdivision MS–DRGs for major joint 
replacement or reattachment of lower 
extremity with and without CC/MCC 
(MS–DRGs 483 and 484) be subdivided 
into three severity levels, as was the 
case for the revision of hip and knee 
replacement MS–DRGs. AAHKS also 
recommended that the two severity 
subdivision MS–DRGs for bilateral or 
multiple major joint procedures of lower 
extremity with and without MCC (MS– 
DRGs 461 and 462) be subdivided three 
ways for this base DRG. AAHKS 
acknowledged that the three way split 
would not meet all five of the criteria for 
establishing a subgroup, and stated that 
these criteria were too restrictive, lack 
face validity, and create perverse 
admission selection incentives for 
hospitals by significantly overpaying for 
cases without a CC and underpaying for 
cases with a CC. It recommended that 
the existing five criteria be modified for 
low volume subgroups to assure 
materiality. For higher volume MS–DRG 
subgroups, the AAHKS recommended 
that two other criteria be considered, 
particularly for nonemergency, elective 
admissions: 
• Is the per-case underpayment 
amount significant enough to affect 
admission vs. referral decisions on a 
case-by-case basis? 
• Is the total level of underpayments 
sufficient to encourage systematic 
admission vs. referral policies, 
procedures, and marketing strategies? 
The AAHKS also recommended 
refining the five existing criteria for 
MCC/CC/without subgroups as follows: 
• Create subgroups if they meet the 
five existing criteria, with cost 
difference between subgroups ($1,350) 
substituted for charge difference 
between subgroups ($4,000); 
• If a proposed subgroup meets 
criteria number 2 and 3 (at least 5 
percent and at least 500 cases) but fails 
one of the others, then create the 
subgroup if either of the following 
criteria are met: 
b At least $1,000 cost difference per 
case between subgroups; or 
b At least $1 million overall cost 
should be shifted to cases with a CC (or 
MCC) within the base DRG for payment 
weight calculations.

23569 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
In response, we indicated that we did 
not believe it was appropriate to modify 
our five criteria for creating severity 
subgroups. Our data did not support 
creating additional subdivisions based 
on the criteria. At that time, we believed 
the criteria we established to create 
subdivisions within a base DRG were 
reasonable and establish the appropriate 
balance between better recognition of 
severity of illness, sufficient differences 
between the groups, and a reasonable 
number of cases in each subgroup. 
However, we indicated that we may 
consider further modifications to the 
criteria at a later date once we have had 
some experience with MS–DRGs created 
using the proposed criteria. 
The AAHKS indicated in its response 
to the FY 2008 proposed rule that it 
continued to support the separation of 
routine and complex joint procedures. It 
believed that certain joint replacement 
procedures have significantly lower 
average charges than do other joint 
replacements. The AAKHS’s data 
suggest that more routine joint 
replacements are associated with 
substantially less resource utilization 
than other more complex revision 
procedures. The AAHKS stated that 
leaving these procedures in the revision 
MS–DRGs results in substantial 
overpayment for these relatively simple, 
less costly revision procedures, which 
in turn results in a relative 
underpayment for the more complex 
revision procedures. 
In response, we examined data on this 
issue and identified two procedure 
codes for partial knee revisions that had 
significantly lower average charges than 
did other joint revisions. The two codes 
are as follows: 
• 00.83 Revision of knee replacement, 
patellar component 
• 00.84 Revision of total knee 
replacement, tibial insert (liner) 
The data suggest that these less 
complex partial knee revisions are less 
resource intensive than other cases 
assigned to MS–DRGs 466, 467, or 468. 
We examined other orthopedic DRGs to 
which these two codes could be 
assigned. We found that these cases 
have very similar average charges to 
those in MS–DRG 485 (Knee Procedures 
with Principal Diagnosis of Infection 
with MCC), MS–DRG 486 (Knee 
Procedures with Principal Diagnosis of 
Infection with CC), MS–DRG 487 (Knee 
Procedures with Principal Diagnosis of 
Infection without CC), MS–DRG 488 
(Knee Procedures without Principal 
Diagnosis of Infection with CC or MCC), 
and MS–DRG 489 (Knee Procedures 
without Principal Diagnosis of Infection 
without CC). 
Given the very similar resource 
requirements of MS–DRG 485 and the 
fact that these DRGs also contain knee 
procedures, we moved codes 00.83 and 
00.84 out of MS–DRGs 466, 467, and 
468 and into MS–DRGs 485, 486, 487, 
488, and 489. We also indicated that we 
would continue to monitor the revision 
DRGs to determine if additional 
modifications are needed. 
d. AAHKS’ Recommendations for FY 
2009 
The AAHKS’ current request involves 
the following recommendations: 
• That CMS consolidate and reassign 
certain joint procedures that have a 
diagnosis of an infection or malignancy 
into MS–DRGs that are similar in terms 
of clinical characteristics and resource 
utilization. The AAKHS further 
identifies groups called Stage 1 and 2 
procedures that it believes require 
significant differences in resource 
utilization. 
• That CMS reclassify certain specific 
joint procedures, which AAHKS refers 
to as ‘‘routine,’’ out of their current MS– 
DRG assignments. The three joint 
procedures that AAHKS classifies as 
‘‘routine’’ are codes 00.73 (Revision of 
hip replacement, acetabular liner and/or 
femoral head only), 00.83 (Revision of 
knee replacement, patellar component), 
and 00.84 (Revision of total knee 
replacement, tibial insert (liner)). The 
AAHKS advocated removing these three 
‘‘routine’’ procedures from the following 
DRGs: MS–DRGs 466, 467, and 468, 
MS–DRGs 485, 486, and 487, and MS– 
DRGs 488 and 489. The AAHKS refers 
to MS–DRGs 466, 467, and 468 as 
‘‘complex’’ revision DRGs, and 
recommended that the three ‘‘routine’’ 
procedures be moved out of MS–DRGs 
466, 467, and 468 and MS–DRGs 485, 
486, and 489 and into MS–DRGs 469 
and 470 (Major Joint Replacement or 
Reattachment of Lower Extremity with 
and without MCC, respectively). The 
AAHKS contended that the three 
‘‘routine’’ procedures have similar 
clinical characteristics and resource 
utilization to those in MS–DRGs 469. 
The recommendations suggested by 
AAHKS are quite complex and involve 
a number of specific code lists and MS– 
DRG assignment changes. We discuss 
each of these requests in detail below. 
(1) AAHKS Recommendation 1: 
Consolidate and reassign patients with 
hip and knee prosthesis related 
infections or malignancies. 
The AAHKS pointed out that deep 
infection is one of the most devastating 
complications associated with hip and 
knee replacements. These infections 
have been reported to occur in 
approximately 0.5 percent to 3 percent 
of primary and 4 percent to 6 percent of 
revision total joint replacement 
procedures. These infections often 
result in the need for multiple 
reoperations, prolonged use of 
intravenous and oral antibiotics, 
extended inpatient and outpatient 
rehabilitation, and frequent followup 
visits. Furthermore, clinical outcomes 
following single- and two-stage revision 
total joint arthroplasty procedures have 
been less favorable than revision for 
other causes of failure not associated 
with infection. 
In addition to the clinical impact, the 
AAHKS stated that infected total joint 
replacement procedures also have 
substantial economic implications for 
patients, payers, hospitals, physicians, 
and society in terms of direct medical 
costs, resource utilization, and the 
indirect costs associated with lost wages 
and productivity. The AAHKS stated 
that the considerable resources required 
to care for these patients has resulted in 
a strong financial disincentive for 
physicians and hospitals to provide care 
for patients with infected total joint 
replacements, an increased economic 
burden on the high volume tertiary care 
referral centers where patients with 
infected hip replacement procedures are 
frequently referred for definitive 
management. The AAHKS further stated 
that, in some cases, there are 
compromised patient outcomes due to 
treatment delays as patients with 
infected joint replacements seek 
providers who are willing to care for 
them. 
Once a deep infection of a total joint 
prosthesis is identified, the first stage of 
treatment involves a hospital admission 
for removal of the infected prosthesis 
and debridement of the involved bone 
and surrounding tissue. During the same 
procedure, an antibiotic-impregnated 
cement spacer is typically inserted to 
maintain alignment of the limb during 
the course of antibiotic therapy. The 
patient is then discharged to a 
rehabilitation facility/nursing home (or 
to home if intravenous therapy can be 
safely arranged for the patient) for a 6- 
week course of IV antibiotic treatment 
until the infection has cleared. 
After the completion of antibiotic 
therapy, the hip or knee may be 
reaspirated to look for evidence of 
persistent infection or eradication of 
infection. A second stage procedure is 
then undertaken, where the patient is 
readmitted, the hip or knee is 
reexplored, and the cement spacer 
removed. If there are no signs of 
persistent infection, a hip or knee 
prosthesis is reimplanted, often using 
bone graft and costly revision implants 
in order to address extensive bone loss

and distorted anatomy. Thus, the entire 
course of treatment for patients with 
infected joint replacements is 4 to 6 
months, with an additional 6 to 12 
months of rehabilitation. Furthermore, 
clinical outcomes following revision for 
infection are poor relative to outcomes 
following revision for other, aseptic 
causes. The AAHKS noted that patients 
with bone malignancy have a similar 
treatment focus—surgery to remove 
diseased tissue, chemotherapy to treat 
the malignancy, and implantation of the 
new prosthesis. They also have similar 
resource use. For simplicity, the 
AAHKS’ discussion focused on infected 
joint prostheses, but it suggested that 
the issues it raises would apply to 
patients with a malignancy as well. 
The AAHKS stated that these patients 
are currently grouped in multiple MS– 
DRGs, and the cases are often ‘‘outliers’’ 
in each one. AAHKS proposed to 
consolidate these patients with similar 
clinical characteristics and treatment 
into MS–DRGs reflective of their 
resource utilization. 
The AAHKS states that these more 
severe patients are currently classified 
into the following MS–DRGs: 
• MS–DRGs 463, 463, and 465 
(Wound Debridement and Skin Graft 
Excluding Hand, for Musculoskeletal- 
Connective Tissue Disease with MCC, 
with CC, without CC/MCC, 
respectively). 
• MS–DRGs 480, 481, and 482 (Hip 
and Femur Procedures Except Major 
Joint with MCC, with CC, without CC/ 
MCC, respectively). 
• MS–DRGs 485, 486, and 487 (Knee 
Procedures with Principal Diagnosis of 
Infection and with MCC, with CC, and 
without CC/MCC, respectively). 
• MS–DRGs 488 and 489 (Knee 
Procedures without Principal Diagnosis 
of Infection and with CC/MCC and 
without CC/MCC, respectively). 
• MS–DRGs 495, 496, and 497 (Local 
Excision and Removal of Internal 
Fixation Devices Except Hip and Femur 
with MCC, with CC, and without CC/ 
MCC, respectively). 
• Other MS–DRGs (The AAHKS did 
not specify what these other MS–DRGs 
were.). 
The AAHKS indicated that cases with 
the severe diagnoses of infections, 
neoplasms, and structural defects have 
similarities. These similarities are due 
to an overlap of a severe diagnosis 
(including a principal diagnosis of code 
996.66 (Infected joint prosthesis) and 
the resulting need for more extensive 
surgical procedures. The AAHKS stated 
that currently these patients are grouped 
into MS–DRGs by major procedure 
alone. AAHKS recommended that these 
cases be grouped into what it refers to 
as Stages 1 and 2 as follows: 
• Stage 1 would include the removal 
of an infected prosthesis and includes 
cases in MS–DRGs 463, 464, and 465, 
480, 481, and 482, 485 through 489, and 
495, 496, and 497. Stage 1 joint 
procedure codes would include codes 
80.05 (Arthrotomy for removal of 
prosthesis, hip), 80.06 (Arthrotomy for 
removal of prosthesis, knee), 00.73 
(Revision of hip replacement, acetabular 
liner and/or femoral head only), and 
00.84 (Revision of knee replacement, 
tibial insert (liner)). 
• Stage 2 would include the implant 
of a new prosthesis and includes cases 
in MS–DRGs 461 and 462, 463, 464, and 
465, 466, 467, and 468, and 469 and 
470. Stage 2 joint procedure codes 
would include codes 00.70 (Revision of 
hip replacement, both acetabular and 
femoral components), 00.71 (Revision of 
hip replacement, acetabular 
component), 00.72 (Revision of hip 
replacement, femoral component), 00.80 
(Revision of knee replacement, total (all 
components)), 00.81 (Revision of knee 
replacement, tibial component), 00.82 
(Revision of knee replacement, femoral 
component), 00.85 (Resurfacing hip, 
total, acetabulum and femoral head), 
00.86 (Resurfacing hip, partial, femoral 
head), 00.87 (Resurfacing hip, partial, 
acetabulum), 81.51 (Total hip 
replacement), 81.52 (Partial hip 
replacement), 81.53 (Revise hip 
replacement), 81.54 (Total knee 
replacement), 81.55 (Revise knee 
replacement), and 81.56 (Total ankle 
replacement). 
As stated earlier, the AAHKS 
recommended patients with certain 
more severe diagnoses be grouped into 
a higher severity level. While most of 
AAHKS’ comments focused on joint 
replacement patients with infections, 
the AAHKS also believed that patients 
with certain neoplasms require greater 
resources. To this group of infections 
and neoplasms, the AAHKS 
recommended the addition of four codes 
that capture acquired deformities. The 
AAHKS believed that these codes would 
capture admissions for the second stage 
of the treatment for an infected joint. 
The AAHKS stated that the significance 
of these diagnoses when they are 
reported as the principal code position 
was significant in predicting resource 
utilization. However, the impact was 
not as significant when the diagnosis 
was reported as a secondary diagnosis. 
The AAHKS recommended that patients 
with one of the following infection/ 
neoplasm/defect principal diagnosis 
codes be segregated into a higher 
severity level. 
Stage 1 Infection/Neoplasm/Defect 
Principal Diagnosis Codes 
• 170.7 (Malignant neoplasm of long 
bones of lower limb). 
• 171.3 (Malignant neoplasm of soft 
tissue, lower limb, including hip). 
• 711.05 (Pyogenic arthritis, pelvic 
region and thigh). 
• 711.06 (Pyogenic arthritis, lower 
leg). 
• 730.05 (Acute osteomyelitis, pelvic 
region and thigh). 
• 730.06 (Acute osteomyelitis, lower 
leg). 
• 730.15 (Chronic osteomyelitis, 
pelvic region and thigh). 
• 730.16 (Chronic osteomyelitis, 
lower leg). 
• 730.25 (Unspecified osteomyelitis, 
pelvic region and thigh). 
• 730.26 (Unspecified osteomyelitis, 
lower leg). 
• 996.66 (Infection and inflammatory 
reaction due to internal joint 
prosthesis). 
• 996.67 (Infection and inflammatory 
reaction due to other internal 
orthopedic device, implant, and graft). 
Stage 2 Infection/Neoplasm/Defect 
Principal Diagnosis Codes (an Asterisk * 
Shows the Diagnoses Included in Stage 
2 That Were Not Listed in Stage 1) 
• 170.7 (Malignant neoplasm of long 
bones of lower limb). 
• 171.3 (Malignant neoplasm of soft 
tissue, lower limb, including hip). 
• 198.5 (Secondary malignant 
neoplasm of bone and bone marrow) .* 
• 711.05 (Pyogenic arthritis, pelvic 
region and thigh). 
• 711.06 (Pyogenic arthritis, lower 
leg). 
• 730.05 (Acute osteomyelitis, pelvic

For the Stage 2 procedures, AAHKS 
also suggested the use of the following 
secondary diagnosis codes to assign the 
cases to a higher severity level. These 
conditions would not be the reason the 
patient was admitted to the hospital. 
They would instead represent secondary 
conditions that were also present on 
admission or conditions that were 
diagnosed after admission. 
Stage 2 Infection/Neoplasm/Defect 
Secondary Diagnosis Codes 
• 170.7 (Malignant neoplasm of long 
bones of lower limb). 
• 171.3 (Malignant neoplasm of soft 
tissue, lower limb, including hip). 
• 711.05 (Pyogenic arthritis, pelvic

• 711.06 (Pyogenic arthritis, lower

• 996.66 (Infection and inflammatory 
reaction due to internal joint 
prosthesis). 
• 996.67 (Infection and inflammatory 
reaction due to other internal 
orthopedic device, implant, and graft). 
(2) AAHKS Recommendation 2: 
Reclassify certain specific joint 
procedures. 
The AAHKS suggested that cases with 
the infection/neoplasm/defect diagnoses 
listed above be segregated according to 
the Stage 1 and 2 groups listed above. 
The AAHKS made one final 
recommendation concerning joint 
procedure cases with infections. It 
identified a subset of patients who had 
a principal diagnosis of 996.66 
(Infection and inflammatory reaction 
due to internal joint prosthesis) and 
who also had a secondary diagnosis of 
sepsis or septicemia. The AAHKS 
believed that these patients are for the 
most part admitted with both the joint 
infection and sepsis/septicemia present 
at the time of admission. The codes for 
sepsis/septicemia are classified as MCCs 
under MS–DRGs. The AAHKS believed 
it is inappropriate to count the 
secondary diagnosis of sepsis/ 
septicemia as a MCC when it is reported 
with code 996.66. The AAHKS believed 
that counting sepsis and septicemia as 
a MCC results in double counting the 
infections. It believed that the joint 
infection and septicemia are the same 
infection. The AAHKS recommended 
that the following sepsis and septicemia 
codes not count as a MCC when 
reported with code 996.66: 
• 038.0 (Streptococcal septicemia). 
• 038.10 (Staphylococcal septicemia, 
unspecified). 
• 038.11 (Staphylococcal aureus 
septicemia). 
• 038.19 (Other staphylococcal 
septicemia). 
• 038.2 (Pneumococcal septicemia 
[streptococcus pneumonia septicemia]). 
• 038.3 (Septicemia due anaerobes). 
• 038.40 (Septicemia due to gram- 
negative organisms). 
• 038.41 (Hemophilus influenzae [H. 
Influenzae]). 
• 038.42 (Escherichia coli [E. Coli]). 
• 038.43 (Pseudomonas). 
• 038.44 (Serratia). 
• 038.49 (Other septicemia due to 
gram-negative organisms). 
• 038.8 (Other specified septicemias). 
• 038.9 (Unspecified septicemia). 
• 995.91 (Sepsis). 
• 995.92 (Severe sepsis). 
e. CMS’ Response to AAHKS’ 
Recommendations 
The MS–DRG modifications proposed 
by the AAHKS are quite complex and 
have many separate parts. We made 
changes to the MS-DRGs in FY 2008 as 
a result of a request by the AAHKS as 
discussed above, to recognize two types 
of partial knee replacements as less 
complex procedures. We have no data 
on how effective the new MS–DRGs for 
joint procedures are in differentiating 
patients with varying degrees of 
severity. Therefore, we analyzed data 
reported prior to the adoption of MS– 
DRGs to analyze each of the 
recommendations made. We begin our 
analysis by focusing first on the more 
simple aspects of the recommendations 
made by the AAHKS. 
(1) Changing the MS–DRG Assignment 
for Codes 00.73, 00.83, and 00.84 
As discussed previously, in FY 2008, 
the AAHKS recommended that CMS 
classify certain joint procedures as 
either routine or complex. We examined 
the data for these cases and found that 
the following two codes had 
significantly lower charges than the 
other joint revisions: 00.83 (Revision of 
knee replacement, patellar component) 
and 00.84 (Revision of knee 
replacement, tibial insert (liner)). 
Therefore, we moved these two codes to 
MS–DRGs 485, 486, and 487, and MS– 
DRGs 488 and 489. 
As a result of AAHKS’ most recent 
recommendations, we once again 
examined claims data for these two knee 
procedures (codes 00.83 and 00.84) as 
well as its request that we move code 
00.73 (Revision of hip replacement, 
acetabular liner and/or femoral head 
only). Code 00.73 is assigned to MS– 
DRGs 466, 467, and 468. The following 
tables show our findings.

467—Cases without Code 00.73 ................................................................................................. 12,484 5.47 54,284.13 
468—All Cases ............................................................................................................................ 19,917 3.94 44,055.62 
468—Cases with Code 00.73 ...................................................................................................... 1,688 3.93 33,449.22 
468—Cases without Code 00.73 ................................................................................................. 18,232 3.94 45,037.09 
469—All Cases ............................................................................................................................ 29,030 8.17 56,681.64 
470—All Cases ............................................................................................................................ 385,123 3.93 36,126.23 
The tables show that codes 00.73, 
00.83, and 00.84 are appropriately 
assigned to their current MS–DRGs. The 
data do not support moving these three 
codes to MS–DRGs 469 and 470. 
Therefore, we are not proposing a 
change of MS–DRG assignment for 
codes 00.73, 00.83, and 00.84. 
(2) Excluding Sepsis and Septicemia 
From Being a MCC With Code 996.66 
There are cases where a patient may 
be admitted with an infection of a joint 
prosthesis (code 996.66) and also have 
sepsis. In these cases, it may be possible 
to perform joint procedures as suggested 
by AAHKS. However, in other cases, a 
patient may be admitted with an 
infection of a joint prosthesis and then 
develop sepsis during the stay. Because 
our current data do not indicate whether 
a condition is present on admission, we 
could not determine whether or not the 
sepsis occurred after admission. Our 
data have consistently shown that cases 
of sepsis and septicemia require 
significant resources. Therefore, we 
classified the sepsis and septicemia 
codes as MCCs. Our clinical advisors do 
not believe it is appropriate to exclude 
all cases of sepsis and septicemia that 
are reported as a secondary diagnosis 
with code 996.66 from being classified 
as a MCC. We discuss septicemia as part 
of hospital acquired conditions 
provision under section II.F. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule. For the 
purposes of classifying sepsis and 
septicemia as non-CCs when reported 
with code 996.66, we do not support 
this recommendation. Therefore, we are 
not proposing that the sepsis and 
septicemia codes be added to the CC 
exclusion list for code 996.66. 
(3) Differences Between Stage 1 and 2 
Cases With Severe Diagnoses 
We next examined data on AAHKS’ 
suggestion that there are significantly 
differences in resource utilization for 
cases they refer to as Stage 1 and 2. 
AAHKS stated that this is particularly 
true for those with infections, 
neoplasms, or structural defects. We 
used the list of procedure codes listed 
above that AAHKS describes as Stage 1 
and 2 procedures. We also used 
AAHKS’ designated lists of Stage 1 and 
2 principal diagnosis codes to examine 
this proposal. This proposal entails 
moving cases with a Stage 1 or 2 
principal diagnosis and procedure out 
of their current MS–DRG assignment in 
the following 19 MS–DRGs and into a 
newly consolidated set of MS–DRGs: 
MS–DRGs 463, 464, and 465, 480, 481, 
and 482, 485 through 489, and 495, 496, 
and 497. 
As can be seen from the information 
below, there was not a significant 
difference in average charges between 
these Stage 1 and Stage 2 cases that have 
an MCC. 
STAGE 1.—CASES WITH INFECTION, NEOPLASM, OR STRUCTURAL DEFECT 
Stage 1 Total cases Average length of stay 
Average 
charges 
With MCC .................................................................................................................................... 1,306 14.1 $79,232 
Without MCC ............................................................................................................................... 4,115 7.6 44,716 
STAGE 2.—CASES WITH INFECTION, NEOPLASM, OR STRUCTURAL DEFECT 
Stage 2 Total cases Average length of stay 
Average 
charges 
With MCC .................................................................................................................................... 1,072 10.9 $80,781 
Without MCC ............................................................................................................................... 5,413 6.0 57,355 
Average charges for Stage 1 cases with 
an MCC was $79,232 compared to 
$80,781 for Stage 2. Stage 1 cases 
without an MCC had average charges of 
$44,716 compared to $57,355. These 
data do not support reconfiguring the 
current MS–DRGs based on this new 
subdivision. 
(4) Moving Joint Procedure Cases to 
New MS–DRGs Based on Secondary 
Diagnoses of Infection 
We examined AAHKS’ 
recommendation that Stage 2 joint cases 
with specific secondary diagnoses of 
infection or neoplasm be moved out of 
their current MS–DRG assignments and 
into a newly constructed MS–DRG. 
We are reluctant to make this type of 
significant DRG change to the joint MS– 
DRGs based on the presence of a 
secondary diagnosis. This results in the 
movement of cases out of MS–DRGs 
which were configured based on the 
reason for the admission (for example, 
principal diagnosis) and surgery. The 
cases would instead be assigned based 
on conditions that are reported as 
secondary diagnoses. In some cases, the 
infection may have developed or be 
diagnosed during the admission. This 
would be a significant logic change to 
the MS–DRGs for joint procedures. We 
have not had an opportunity to examine

claims data based on hospital discharges 
under the MS–DRGs which began 
October 1, 2008. Our clinical advisors 
believe it would be more appropriate to 
wait for data under the new MS–DRG 
system to determine how well the new 
severity levels are addressing accurate 
payment for these cases before 
considering this approach to assigning 
cases to a MS–DRG. 
(5) Moving Cases With Infection, 
Neoplasms, or Structural Defects Out of 
19 MS–DRGs and Into Two Newly 
Developed MS–DRGs 
The last recommended by AAHKS 
that we considered was moving cases 
with a principal diagnosis of infection, 
neoplasm, or structural defect from their 
list of Stage 1 and 2 diagnoses and 
consolidated them into newly 
constructed and modified MS–DRGs. 
AAHKS could not identify an existing 
set of MS–DRGs with similar resource 
utilizations into which the Stage 1 cases 
could be assigned. Therefore, the 
AAHKS recommended that CMS create 
three new MS–DRGs for Stage 1 cases 
with infections, neoplasms and 
structural defects which would be titled 
‘‘Arthrotomy/Removal/Component 
exchange of Infected Hip or Knee 
Prosthesis with MCC, with CC, and 
without CC/MCC’’, respectively. 
The AAHKS recommended moving 
Stage 2 cases out of MS–DRGs 466, 467, 
and 468, and 469 and 470 and into MS– 
DRGs 461 and 462. AAHKS 
recommended that MS–DRGs 461 and 
462 be renamed ‘‘Major Joint Procedures 
of Lower Extremity—Bilateral/Multiple/ 
Infection/Malignancy’’. 
In reviewing these proposed changes, 
we had a number of concerns. The first 
concern was that these proposed 
changes would result in the removal of 
cases with varying average charges from 
19 current MS–DRGs and consolidating 
them into two separate sets of MS– 
DRGs. As the data below indicate, the 
average charges vary from as low as 
$29,181 in MS–DRG 487 to $81,089 in 
MS–DRG 463. Furthermore, the average 
charges for these infection/neoplasm/ 
structural defect cases are very similar 
to other cases in their respective MS– 
DRG assignments for many of these MS– 
DRGs. There are cases where the average 
charges are higher. In MS–DRG 469 and 
470, the infection/neoplasm/structural 
defect cases are significantly higher. 
However, there are only 136 cases in 
MS–DRG 469 out of a total of 29,030 
cases with these diagnoses. There are 
only 673 cases in MS–DRG 470 out of 
a total of 385,123 cases with one of 
these diagnoses. The table below clearly 
demonstrates the wide variety of 
charges for cases with these diagnoses.

Given the wide variety of charges and 
the small number of cases where there 
are differences in charges, we do not 
believe the data support the AAHKS’ 
recommendations. The data do not 
support removing these cases from the 
19 MS–DRGs above and consolidating 
them into a new set of MS–DRGs, either 
newly created, or by adding them to

MS–DRG 461 or 462, which have 
average charges of $80,718 and $57,355, 
respectively. 
A second major concern involves 
redefining MS–DRGs 461 and 462 is that 
these MS–DRG currently captures 
bilateral and multiple joint procedures. 
These MS–DRGs were specifically 
created to capture a unique set of 
patients who undergo procedures on 
more than one lower joint. Redefining 
these MS–DRGs to include both single 
and multiple joints undermines the 
clinical coherence of this MS–DRG. It 
would create a widely diverse group of 
patients based on either a list of specific 
diagnoses or the fact that the patient had 
multiple lower joint procedures. 
f. Conclusion 
The AAHKS recommended a number 
of complicated, interrelated MS–DRG 
changes to the joint procedure MS– 
DRGs. We have not yet had the 
opportunity to review data for these 
cases under the new MS–DRGs. We did 
analyze the impact of these 
recommendations using cases prior to 
the implementation of MS–DRGs. The 
recommendations were difficult to 
analyze because there were so many 
separate logic changes that impacted a 
number of MS–DRGs. We did examine 
each major suggestion separately, and 
found that our data and clinical analysis 
did not support making these changes. 
Therefore, we are not proposing any 
revisions to the joint procedure MS– 
DRGs for FY 2009. We look forward to 
examining these issues once we receive 
data under the MS–DRG system. We 
also welcome additional 
recommendations from the AAHKS and 
others on a more incremental approach 
to resolving its concerns about the 
ability of the current MS–DRGs to 
adequately capture differences in 
severity levels for joint procedure 
patients. 
5. MDC 18 (Infections and Parasitic 
Diseases (Systemic or Unspecified 
Sites)): Severe Sepsis 
We received a request from a 
manufacturer to modify the titles for 
three MS–DRGs with the most 
significant concentration of severe 
sepsis patients. The manufacturer stated 
that modification of the titles will assist 
in quality improvement efforts and 
provide a better reflection on the types 
of patients included in these MS–DRGs. 
Specifically, the manufacturer urged 
CMS to incorporate the term ‘‘severe 
sepsis’’ into the titles of the following 
MS–DRGs that became effective October 
1, 2007 (FY 2008) 
• MS–DRG 870 (Septicemia with 
Mechanical Ventilation 96+ Hours). 
• MS–DRG 871 (Septicemia without 
Mechanical Ventilation 96+ Hours with 
MCC). 
• MS–DRG 872 (Septicemia without 
Mechanical Ventilation 96+ Hours 
without MCC). 
These MS–DRGs were created to 
better recognize severity of illness 
among patients diagnosed with 
conditions including septicemia, severe 
sepsis, septic shock, and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) 
who are also treated with mechanical 
ventilation for a specified duration of 
time. 
According to the manufacturer, 
‘‘severe sepsis is a common, deadly and 
costly disease, yet the number of 
patients impacted and the outcomes 
associated with their care remain largely 
hidden within the administrative data 
set.’’ The manufacturer further noted 
that, although improvements have been 
made in the ICD–9–CM coding of severe 
sepsis (diagnosis code 995.92) and 
septic shock (diagnosis code 785.52), 
results of an analysis demonstrated an 
unacceptably high mortality rate for 
patients reported to have those 
conditions. The manufacturer believed 
that revising the titles to incorporate 
‘‘severe sepsis’’ will provide various 
clinicians and researchers the 
opportunity to improve outcomes for 
these patients. Therefore, the 
manufacturer recommended revising the 
current MS–DRG titles as follows: 
• Proposed Revised MS–DRG 870 
(Septicemia or Severe Sepsis with 
Mechanical Ventilation 96+ Hours). 
• Proposed Revised MS–DRG 871 
(Septicemia or Severe Sepsis without 
Mechanical Ventilation 96+ Hours with 
MCC). 
• Proposed Revised MS–DRG 872 
(Septicemia or Severe Sepsis without 
Mechanical Ventilation 96+ Hours 
without MCC). 
We agree with the manufacturer that 
revising the current MS–DRG titles to 
include the term ‘‘severe sepsis’’ would 
better assist in the recognition and 
identification of this disease, which 
could lead to better clinical outcomes 
and quality improvement efforts. In 
addition, both severe sepsis (diagnosis 
code 995.92) and septic shock 
(diagnosis code 785.52) are currently 
already assigned to these three MS– 
DRGs. Therefore, we are proposing to 
revise the titles of MS–DRGs 870, 871, 
and 872 to reflect severe sepsis in the 
titles as suggested by the manufacturer 
and listed above for FY 2009. 
6. MDC 21 (Injuries, Poisonings and 
Toxic Effects of Drugs): Traumatic 
Compartment Syndrome 
Traumatic compartment syndrome is 
a condition in which increased pressure 
within a confined anatomical space that 
contains blood vessels, muscles, nerves, 
and bones causes a decrease in blood 
flow and may lead to tissue necrosis. 
There are five ICD–9–CM diagnosis 
codes that were created effective 
October 1, 2006, to identify traumatic 
compartment syndrome of various sites. 
• 958.90 (Compartment syndrome, 
unspecified). 
• 958.91 (Traumatic compartment 
syndrome of upper extremity). 
• 958.92 (Traumatic compartment 
syndrome of lower extremity). 
• 958.93 (Traumatic compartment 
syndrome of abdomen). 
• 958.99 (Traumatic compartment 
syndrome of other sites) . 
Cases with one of the diagnosis codes 
listed above reported as the principal 
diagnosis and no operating room 
procedure are assigned to either MS– 
DRG 922 (Other Injury, Poisoning and 
Toxic Effect Diagnosis with MCC) or 
MS–DRG 923 (Other Injury, Poisoning 
and Toxic Effect Diagnosis without 
MCC) in MDC 21. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period when we adopted the 
MS–DRGs, we inadvertently omitted the 
addition of these traumatic 
compartment syndrome codes 958.90 
through 958.99 to the multiple trauma 
MS–DRGs 963 (Other Multiple 
Significant Trauma with MCC), MS– 
DRG 964 (Other Multiple Significant 
Trauma with CC), and MS–DRG 965 
(Other Multiple Significant Trauma 
without CC/MCC) in MDC 24 (Multiple 
Significant Trauma). Cases are assigned 
to MDC 24 based on the principal 
diagnosis of trauma and at least two 
significant trauma diagnosis codes 
(either as principal or secondary 
diagnoses) from different body site 
categories. There are eight different 
body site categories as follows: 
• Significant head trauma. 
• Significant chest trauma. 
• Significant abdominal trauma. 
• Significant kidney trauma. 
• Significant trauma of the urinary 
system. 
• Significant trauma of the pelvis or 
spine. 
• Significant trauma of the upper 
limb. 
• Significant trauma of the lower 
limb. 
Therefore, we are proposing to add 
traumatic compartment syndrome codes 
958.90 through 958.99 to MS–DRGs 963 
and MS–DRG 965 in MDC 24. Under

7. Medicare Code Editor (MCE) Changes 
As explained under section II.B.1. of 
the preamble of this proposed rule, the 
Medicare Code Editor (MCE) is a 
software program that detects and 
reports errors in the coding of Medicare 
claims data. Patient diagnoses, 
procedure(s), and demographic 
information are entered into the 
Medicare claims processing systems and 
are subjected to a series of automated 
screens. The MCE screens are designed 
to identify cases that require further 
review before classification into a DRG. 
For FY 2009, we are proposing to make 
the following changes to the MCE edits: 
a. List of Unacceptable Principal 
Diagnoses in MCE 
Diagnosis code V62.84 (Suicidal 
ideation) was created for use beginning 
October 1, 2005. At the time the 
diagnosis code was created, it was not 
clear that the creation of this code was 
requested in order to describe the 
principal reason for admission to a 
facility or the principal reason for 
treatment. The NCHS Official ICD–9– 
CM Coding Guidelines therefore 
categorized the group of codes in V62.X 
for use only as additional or secondary 
diagnoses. It has been brought to the 
government’s attention that the use of 
this code is hampered by its designation 
as an additional-only diagnosis. NCHS 
has therefore modified the Official 
Coding Guidelines for FY 2009 by 
making this code acceptable as a 
principal diagnosis as well as an 
additional diagnosis. In order to 
conform to this change by NCHS, we are 
proposing to remove code V62.84 from 
the MCE list of ‘‘Unacceptable Principal 
Diagnoses’’ for FY 2009. 
b. Diagnoses Allowed for Males Only 
Edit 
There are four diagnosis codes that 
were inadvertently left off of the MCE 
edit titled ‘‘Diagnoses Allowed for 
Males Only.’’ These codes are located in 
the chapter of the ICD–9–CM diagnosis 
codes entitled ‘‘Diseases of Male Genital 
Organs.’’ We are proposing to add the 
following four codes to this MCE edit: 
603.0 (Encysted hydrocele), 603.1 
(Infected hydrocele), 603.8 (Other 
specified types of hydrocele), and 603.9 
(Hydrocele, unspecified). We have had 
no reported problems or confusion with 
the omission of these codes from this 
section of the MCE, but in order to have 
an accurate product, we are proposing 
that these codes be added for FY 2009. 
c. Limited Coverage Edit 
As explained in section II.G.1. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, we are 
proposing to remove procedure code 
37.52 (Implantation of internal 
biventricular heart replacement system) 
from the MCE ‘‘Non-Covered 
Procedure’’ edit and to assign it to the 
‘‘Limited Coverage’’ edit. We are 
proposing to include in this proposed 
edit the requirement that ICD–9–CM 
diagnosis code V70.7 (Examination of 
participant in clinical trial) also be 
present on the claim. We are proposing 
that claims submitted without both 
procedure code 37.52 and diagnosis 
code V70.7 would be denied because 
they would not be in compliance with 
the proposed coverage policy explained 
in section II.G.1. of this preamble. 
8. Surgical Hierarchies 
Some inpatient stays entail multiple 
surgical procedures, each one of which, 
occurring by itself, could result in 
assignment of the case to a different 
MS–DRG within the MDC to which the 
principal diagnosis is assigned. 
Therefore, it is necessary to have a 
decision rule within the GROUPER by 
which these cases are assigned to a 
single MS–DRG. The surgical hierarchy, 
an ordering of surgical classes from 
most resource-intensive to least 
resource-intensive, performs that 
function. Application of this hierarchy 
ensures that cases involving multiple 
surgical procedures are assigned to the 
MS–DRG associated with the most 
resource-intensive surgical class. 
Because the relative resource intensity 
of surgical classes can shift as a function 
of MS–DRG reclassification and 
recalibrations, we reviewed the surgical 
hierarchy of each MDC, as we have for 
previous reclassifications and 
recalibrations, to determine if the 
ordering of classes coincides with the 
intensity of resource utilization. 
A surgical class can be composed of 
one or more MS–DRGs. For example, in 
MDC 11, the surgical class ‘‘kidney 
transplant’’ consists of a single MS–DRG 
(MS–DRG 652) and the class ‘‘kidney, 
ureter and major bladder procedures’’ 
consists of three MS–DRGs (MS–DRGs 
653, 654, and 655). Consequently, in 
many cases, the surgical hierarchy has 
an impact on more than one MS–DRG. 
The methodology for determining the 
most resource-intensive surgical class 
involves weighting the average 
resources for each MS–DRG by 
frequency to determine the weighted 
average resources for each surgical class. 
For example, assume surgical class A 
includes MS–DRGs 1 and 2 and surgical 
class B includes MS–DRGs 3, 4, and 5. 
Assume also that the average charge of 
MS–DRG 1 is higher than that of MS– 
DRG 3, but the average charges of MS– 
DRGs 4 and 5 are higher than the 
average charge of MS–DRG 2. To 
determine whether surgical class A 
should be higher or lower than surgical 
class B in the surgical hierarchy, we 
would weight the average charge of each 
MS–DRG in the class by frequency (that 
is, by the number of cases in the MS– 
DRG) to determine average resource 
consumption for the surgical class. The 
surgical classes would then be ordered 
from the class with the highest average 
resource utilization to that with the 
lowest, with the exception of ‘‘other 
O.R. procedures’’ as discussed below. 
This methodology may occasionally 
result in assignment of a case involving 
multiple procedures to the lower- 
weighted MS–DRG (in the highest, most 
resource-intensive surgical class) of the 
available alternatives. However, given 
that the logic underlying the surgical 
hierarchy provides that the GROUPER 
search for the procedure in the most 
resource-intensive surgical class, in 
cases involving multiple procedures, 
this result is sometimes unavoidable. 
We note that, notwithstanding the 
foregoing discussion, there are a few 
instances when a surgical class with a 
lower average charge is ordered above a 
surgical class with a higher average 
charge. For example, the ‘‘other O.R. 
procedures’’ surgical class is uniformly 
ordered last in the surgical hierarchy of 
each MDC in which it occurs, regardless 
of the fact that the average charge for the 
MS–DRG or MS–DRGs in that surgical 
class may be higher than that for other 
surgical classes in the MDC. The ‘‘other 
O.R. procedures’’ class is a group of 
procedures that are only infrequently 
related to the diagnoses in the MDC, but 
are still occasionally performed on 
patients in the MDC with these 
diagnoses. Therefore, assignment to 
these surgical classes should only occur 
if no other surgical class more closely 
related to the diagnoses in the MDC is 
appropriate. 
A second example occurs when the 
difference between the average charges 
for two surgical classes is very small. 
We have found that small differences 
generally do not warrant reordering of 
the hierarchy because, as a result of 
reassigning cases on the basis of the 
hierarchy change, the average charges 
are likely to shift such that the higher- 
ordered surgical class has a lower

average charge than the class ordered 
below it. 
For FY 2009, we are proposing a 
revision of the surgical hierarchy for 
MDC 5 (Diseases and Disorders of the 
Circulatory System) by placing MS–DRG 
245 (AICD Generator Procedures) above 
proposed new MS–DRG 265 (AICD Lead 
Procedures). 
9. CC Exclusions List 
a. Background 
As indicated earlier in the preamble 
of this proposed rule, under the IPPS 
DRG classification system, we have 
developed a standard list of diagnoses 
that are considered CCs. Historically, we 
developed this list using physician 
panels that classified each diagnosis 
code based on whether the diagnosis, 
when present as a secondary condition, 
would be considered a substantial 
complication or comorbidity. A 
substantial complication or comorbidity 
was defined as a condition that, because 
of its presence with a specific principal 
diagnosis, would cause an increase in 
the length of stay by at least 1 day in 
at least 75 percent of the patients. We 
refer readers to section II.D.2. and 3. of 
the preamble of the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period for a 
discussion of the refinement of CCs in 
relation to the MS–DRGs we adopted for 
FY–2008 (72 FR 47152 through 47121). 
b. CC Exclusions List for FY 2009 
In the September 1, 1987 final notice 
(52–FR–33143) concerning changes to 
the DRG classification system, we 
modified the GROUPER logic so that 
certain diagnoses included on the 
standard list of CCs would not be 
considered valid CCs in combination 
with a particular principal diagnosis. 
We created the CC Exclusions List for 
the following reasons: (1) To preclude 
coding of CCs for closely related 
conditions; (2) to preclude duplicative 
or inconsistent coding from being 
treated as CCs; and (3) to ensure that 
cases are appropriately classified 
between the complicated and 
uncomplicated DRGs in a pair. As we 
indicated above, we developed a list of 
diagnoses, using physician panels, to 
include those diagnoses that, when 
present as a secondary condition, would 
be considered a substantial 
complication or comorbidity. In 
previous years, we have made changes 
to the list of CCs, either by adding new 
CCs or deleting CCs already on the list. 
In the May 19, 1987 proposed notice 
(52 FR 18877) and the September 1, 
1987 final notice (52 FR 33154), we 
explained that the excluded secondary 
diagnoses were established using the 
following five principles: 
• Chronic and acute manifestations of 
the same condition should not be 
considered CCs for one another. 
• Specific and nonspecific (that is, 
not otherwise specified (NOS)) 
diagnosis codes for the same condition 
should not be considered CCs for one 
another. 
• Codes for the same condition that 
cannot coexist, such as partial/total, 
unilateral/bilateral, obstructed/ 
unobstructed, and benign/malignant, 
should not be considered CCs for one 
another. 
• Codes for the same condition in 
anatomically proximal sites should not 
be considered CCs for one another. 
• Closely related conditions should 
not be considered CCs for one another. 
The creation of the CC Exclusions List 
was a major project involving hundreds 
of codes. We have continued to review 
the remaining CCs to identify additional 
exclusions and to remove diagnoses 
from the master list that have been 
shown not to meet the definition of a 
CC.12 
For FY 2009, we are proposing to 
make limited revisions to the CC 
Exclusions List to take into account the 
changes that will be made in the ICD– 
9–CM diagnosis coding system effective 
October 1, 2008. (See section II.G.11. of 
the preamble of this proposed rule with 
comment period for a discussion of 
ICD–9–CM changes.) We are proposing 
to make these changes in accordance 
with the principles established when we 
created the CC Exclusions List in 1987. 
In addition, as discussed in section 
II.D.3. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule, we are indicating on the CC 
exclusion list some updates to reflect 
the exclusion of a few codes from being 
an MCC under the MS–DRG system that 
we adopted for FY 2008. 
Tables 6G and 6H, Additions to and 
Deletions from the CC Exclusion List, 
respectively, which will be effective for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2008, are not being published in this 
proposed rule because of the length of 
the two tables. Instead, we are making 
them available through the Internet on 
the CMS Web site at: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/AcuteInpatientPPS. 
Each of these principal diagnoses for 
which there is a CC exclusion is shown 
in Tables 6G and 6H with an asterisk, 
and the conditions that will not count 
as a CC, are provided in an indented 
column immediately following the 
affected principal diagnosis. 
A complete updated MCC, CC, and 
Non-CC Exclusions List is also available 
through the Internet on the CMS Web 
site at: http:/www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
AcuteInpatientPPS. Beginning with 
discharges on or after October 1, 2008, 
the indented diagnoses will not be 
recognized by the GROUPER as valid 
CCs for the asterisked principal 
diagnosis. 
To assist readers in the review of 
changes to the MCC and CC lists that 
occurred as a result of updates to the 
ICD–9–CM codes, as described in Tables 
6A, 6C, and 6E, we are providing the 
following summaries of those MCC and 
CC changes.

13 The original list of the ICD–9–CM procedure 
codes for the procedures we consider nonextensive 
procedures, if performed with an unrelated 
principal diagnosis, was published in Table 6C in 
section IV. of the Addendum to the FY 1989 final 
rule (53 FR 38591). As part of the FY 1991 final rule 
(55 FR 36135), the FY 1992 final rule (56 FR 43212), 
the FY 1993 final rule (57 FR 23625), the FY 1994 
final rule (58 FR 46279), the FY 1995 final rule (59 
FR 45336), the FY 1996 final rule (60 FR 45783), 
the FY 1997 final rule (61 FR 46173), and the FY 
1998 final rule (62 FR 45981), we moved several 
other procedures from DRG 468 to DRG 477, and 
some procedures from DRG 477 to DRG 468. No 
procedures were moved in FY 1999, as noted in the 
final rule (63 FR 40962); in FY 2000 (64 FR 41496); 
in FY 2001 (65 FR 47064); or in FY 2002 (66 FR 
39852). In the FY 2003 final rule (67 FR 49999) we 
did not move any procedures from DRG 477. 
However, we did move procedure codes from DRG 
468 and placed them in more clinically coherent 
DRGs. In the FY 2004 final rule (68 FR 45365), we 
moved several procedures from DRG 468 to DRGs 
476 and 477 because the procedures are 
nonextensive. In the FY 2005 final rule (69 FR 
48950), we moved one procedure from DRG 468 to 
477. In addition, we added several existing 
procedures to DRGs 476 and 477. In the FY 2006 
(70 FR 47317), we moved one procedure from DRG 
468 and assigned it to DRG 477. In FY 2007, we 
moved one procedure from DRG 468 and assigned 
it to DRGs 479, 553, and 554. In FY 2008, no 
procedures were moved, as noted in the final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 46241). 
these CMS DRGs. Under the MS–DRGs 
that we adopted for FY 2008, CMS DRG 
468 was split three ways and became 
MS–DRGs 981, 982, and 983 (Extensive 
O.R. Procedure Unrelated to Principal 
Diagnosis with MCC, with CC, and 
without CC/MCC). CMS DRG 476 
became MS–DRGs 984, 985, and 986 
(Prostatic O.R. Procedure Unrelated to 
Principal Diagnosis with MCC, with CC, 
and without CC/MCC). CMS DRG 477 
became MS–DRGs 987, 988, and 989 
(Nonextensive O.R. Procedure Unrelated 
to Principal Diagnosis with MCC, with 
CC, and without CC/MCC). 
MS–DRGs 981 through 983, 984 
through 986, and 987 through 989 
(formerly CMS DRGs 468, 476, and 477, 
respectively) are reserved for those cases 
in which none of the O.R. procedures 
performed are related to the principal 
diagnosis. These DRGs are intended to 
capture atypical cases, that is, those 
cases not occurring with sufficient 
frequency to represent a distinct, 
recognizable clinical group. MS–DRGs 
984 through 986 (previously CMS DRG 
476) are assigned to those discharges in 
which one or more of the following 
prostatic procedures are performed and 
are unrelated to the principal diagnosis: 
• 60.0, Incision of prostate. 
• 60.12, Open biopsy of prostate. 
• 60.15, Biopsy of periprostatic 
tissue. 
• 60.18, Other diagnostic procedures 
on prostate and periprostatic tissue. 
• 60.21, Transurethral prostatectomy. 
• 60.29, Other transurethral 
prostatectomy. 
• 60.61, Local excision of lesion of 
prostate. 
• 60.69, Prostatectomy, not elsewhere 
classified. 
• 60.81, Incision of periprostatic 
tissue. 
• 60.82, Excision of periprostatic 
tissue. 
• 60.93, Repair of prostate. 
• 60.94, Control of (postoperative) 
hemorrhage of prostate. 
• 60.95, Transurethral balloon 
dilation of the prostatic urethra. 
• 60.96, Transurethral destruction of 
prostate tissue by microwave 
thermotherapy. 
• 60.97, Other transurethral 
destruction of prostate tissue by other 
thermotherapy. 
• 60.99, Other operations on prostate. 
All remaining O.R. procedures are 
assigned to MS–DRGs 981 through 983 
and 987 through 989, with MS–DRGs 
987 through 989 assigned to those 
discharges in which the only procedures 
performed are nonextensive procedures 
that are unrelated to the principal 
diagnosis.13 
For FY 2009, we are not proposing to 
change the procedures assigned among 
these DRGs. 
a. Moving Procedure Codes From MS– 
DRGs 981 Through 983 or MS–DRGs 
987 Through 989 to MDCs 
We annually conduct a review of 
procedures producing assignment to 
MS–DRGs 981 through 983 (formerly 
CMS DRG 468) or MS–DRGs 987 
through 989 (formerly CMS DRG 477) 
on the basis of volume, by procedure, to 
see if it would be appropriate to move 
procedure codes out of these DRGs into 
one of the surgical DRGs for the MDC 
into which the principal diagnosis falls. 
The data are arrayed in two ways for 
comparison purposes. We look at a 
frequency count of each major operative 
procedure code. We also compare 
procedures across MDCs by volume of 
procedure codes within each MDC. 
We identify those procedures 
occurring in conjunction with certain 
principal diagnoses with sufficient 
frequency to justify adding them to one 
of the surgical DRGs for the MDC in 
which the diagnosis falls. For FY 2009, 
we are not proposing to remove any 
procedures from MS–DRGs 981 through 
983 or MS–DRGs 987 through 989. 
b. Reassignment of Procedures Among 
MS–DRGs 981 Through 983, 984 
Through 986, and 987 Through 989) 
We also annually review the list of 
ICD–9–CM procedures that, when in 
combination with their principal 
diagnosis code, result in assignment to 
MS–DRGs 981 through 983, 984 through 
986, and 987 through 989 (formerly, 
CMS DRGs 468, 476, and 477, 
respectively), to ascertain whether any 
of those procedures should be 
reassigned from one of these three DRGs 
to another of the three DRGs based on 
average charges and the length of stay. 
We look at the data for trends such as 
shifts in treatment practice or reporting 
practice that would make the resulting 
DRG assignment illogical. If we find 
these shifts, we would propose to move 
cases to keep the DRGs clinically similar 
or to provide payment for the cases in 
a similar manner. Generally, we move 
only those procedures for which we 
have an adequate number of discharges 
to analyze the data. 
For FY 2009, we are not proposing to 
move any procedure codes among these 
DRGs. 
c. Adding Diagnosis or Procedure Codes 
to MDCs 
Based on our review this year, we are 
not proposing to add any diagnosis 
codes to MDCs for FY 2009. 
11. Changes to the ICD–9–CM Coding 
System 
As described in section II.B.1. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, the ICD– 
9–CM is a coding system used for the 
reporting of diagnoses and procedures 
performed on a patient. In September 
1985, the ICD–9–CM Coordination and 
Maintenance Committee was formed. 
This is a Federal interdepartmental 
committee, co-chaired by the National 
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and CMS, charged with 
maintaining and updating the ICD–9– 
CM system. The Committee is jointly 
responsible for approving coding 
changes, and developing errata, 
addenda, and other modifications to the 
ICD–9–CM to reflect newly developed 
procedures and technologies and newly 
identified diseases. The Committee is 
also responsible for promoting the use 
of Federal and non-Federal educational 
programs and other communication 
techniques with a view toward 
standardizing coding applications and 
upgrading the quality of the 
classification system. 
The Official Version of the ICD–9–CM 
contains the list of valid diagnosis and 
procedure codes. (The Official Version 
of the ICD–9–CM is available from the 
Government Printing Office on CD– 
ROM for $27.00 by calling (202) 512– 
1800.) Complete information on 
ordering the CD–ROM is also available 
at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/

Version of the ICD–9–CM is no longer 
available in printed manual form from 
the Federal Government; it is only 
available on CD–ROM. Users who need 
a paper version are referred to one of the 
many products available from 
publishing houses. 
The NCHS has lead responsibility for 
the ICD–9–CM diagnosis codes included 
in the Tabular List and Alphabetic 
Index for Diseases, while CMS has lead 
responsibility for the ICD–9–CM 
procedure codes included in the 
Tabular List and Alphabetic Index for 
Procedures. 
The Committee encourages 
participation in the above process by 
health-related organizations. In this 
regard, the Committee holds public 
meetings for discussion of educational 
issues and proposed coding changes. 
These meetings provide an opportunity 
for representatives of recognized 
organizations in the coding field, such 
as the American Health Information 
Management Association (AHIMA), the 
American Hospital Association (AHA), 
and various physician specialty groups, 
as well as individual physicians, health 
information management professionals, 
and other members of the public, to 
contribute ideas on coding matters. 
After considering the opinions 
expressed at the public meetings and in 
writing, the Committee formulates 
recommendations, which then must be 
approved by the agencies. 
The Committee presented proposals 
for coding changes for implementation 
in FY 2009 at a public meeting held on 
September 27–28, 2007 and finalized 
the coding changes after consideration 
of comments received at the meetings 
and in writing by December 3, 2007. 
Those coding changes are announced in 
Tables 6A through 6F in the Addendum 
to this proposed rule. The Committee 
held its 2008 meeting on March 19–20, 
2008. Proposed new codes for which 
there was a consensus of public support 
and for which complete tabular and 
indexing changes can be made by May 
2008 will be included in the October 1, 
2008 update to ICD–9–CM. Code 
revisions that were discussed at the 
March 19–20, 2008 Committee meeting 
but that could not be finalized in time 
to include them in the Addendum to 
this proposed rule are not included in 
Tables 6A through 6F. These additional 
codes will be included in Tables 6A 
through 6F of the final rule with 
comment period and are marked with 
an asterisk (*). 
Copies of the minutes of the 
procedure codes discussions at the 
Committee’s September 27–28, 2007 
meeting can be obtained from the CMS 
Web site at: http://cms.hhs.gov/ 
ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/ 
03_meetings.asp. The minutes of the 
diagnosis codes discussions at the 
September 27–28, 2007 meeting are 
found at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ 
icd9.htm. Paper copies of these minutes 
are no longer available and the mailing 
list has been discontinued. These Web 
sites also provide detailed information 
about the Committee, including 
information on requesting a new code, 
attending a Committee meeting, and 
timeline requirements and meeting 
dates. 
We encourage commenters to address 
suggestions on coding issues involving 
diagnosis codes to: Donna Pickett, Co- 
Chairperson, ICD–9–CM Coordination 
and Maintenance Committee, NCHS, 
Room 2402, 3311 Toledo Road, 
Hyattsville, MD 20782. Comments may 
be sent by E-mail to: dfp4@cdc.gov. 
Questions and comments concerning 
the procedure codes should be 
addressed to: Patricia E. Brooks, Co- 
Chairperson, ICD–9–CM Coordination 
and Maintenance Committee, CMS, 
Center for Medicare Management, 
Hospital and Ambulatory Policy Group, 
Division of Acute Care, C4–08–06, 7500 
Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 
21244–1850. Comments may be sent by 
E-mail to: 
patricia.brooks2@cms.hhs.gov. 
The ICD–9–CM code changes that 
have been approved will become 
effective October 1, 2008. The new ICD– 
9–CM codes are listed, along with their 
DRG classifications, in Tables 6A and 
6B (New Diagnosis Codes and New 
Procedure Codes, respectively) in the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. As we 
stated above, the code numbers and 
their titles were presented for public 
comment at the ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee meetings. Both oral and 
written comments were considered 
before the codes were approved. In this 
proposed rule, we are only soliciting 
comments on the proposed 
classification of these new codes. 
For codes that have been replaced by 
new or expanded codes, and the 
corresponding new or expanded 
diagnosis codes are included in Table 
6A. New procedure codes are shown in 
Table 6B. Diagnosis codes that have 
been replaced by expanded codes or 
other codes or have been deleted are in 
Table 6C (Invalid Diagnosis Codes). 
These invalid diagnosis codes will not 
be recognized by the GROUPER 
beginning with discharges occurring on 
or after October 1, 2008. Table 6D 
contains invalid procedure codes. These 
invalid procedure codes will not be 
recognized by the GROUPER beginning 
with discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 2008. Revisions to diagnosis 
code titles are in Table 6E (Revised 
Diagnosis Code Titles), which also 
includes the MS–DRG assignments for 
these revised codes. Table 6F includes 
revised procedure code titles for FY 
2009. 
In the September 7, 2001 final rule 
implementing the IPPS new technology 
add-on payments (66 FR 46906), we 
indicated we would attempt to include 
proposals for procedure codes that 
would describe new technology 
discussed and approved at the Spring 
meeting as part of the code revisions 
effective the following October. As 
stated previously, ICD–9–CM codes 
discussed at the March 19–20, 2008 
Committee meeting that received 
consensus and that are finalized by May 
2008, will be included in Tables 6A 
through 6F of the Addendum to the 
final rule. 
Section 503(a) of Pub. L. 108–173 
included a requirement for updating 
ICD–9–CM codes twice a year instead of 
a single update on October 1 of each 
year. This requirement was included as 
part of the amendments to the Act 
relating to recognition of new 
technology under the IPPS. Section 
503(a) amended section 1886(d)(5)(K) of 
the Act by adding a clause (vii) which 
states that the ‘‘Secretary shall provide 
for the addition of new diagnosis and 
procedure codes on April 1 of each year, 
but the addition of such codes shall not 
require the Secretary to adjust the 
payment (or diagnosis-related group 
classification) * * * until the fiscal year 
that begins after such date.’’ This 
requirement improves the recognition of 
new technologies under the IPPS system 
by providing information on these new 
technologies at an earlier date. Data will 
be available 6 months earlier than 
would be possible with updates 
occurring only once a year on October 
1. 
While section 1886(d)(5)(K)(vii) of the 
Act states that the addition of new 
diagnosis and procedure codes on April 
1 of each year shall not require the 
Secretary to adjust the payment, or DRG 
classification, under section 1886(d) of 
the Act until the fiscal year that begins 
after such date, we have to update the 
DRG software and other systems in 
order to recognize and accept the new 
codes. We also publicize the code 
changes and the need for a mid-year 
systems update by providers to identify 
the new codes. Hospitals also have to 
obtain the new code books and encoder 
updates, and make other system changes 
in order to identify and report the new 
codes.

Maintenance Committee holds its

23581 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
meetings in the spring and fall in order 
to update the codes and the applicable 
payment and reporting systems by 
October 1 of each year. Items are placed 
on the agenda for the ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee meeting if the request is 
received at least 2 months prior to the 
meeting. This requirement allows time 
for staff to review and research the 
coding issues and prepare material for 
discussion at the meeting. It also allows 
time for the topic to be publicized in 
meeting announcements in the Federal 
Register as well as on the CMS Web site. 
The public decides whether or not to 
attend the meeting based on the topics 
listed on the agenda. Final decisions on 
code title revisions are currently made 
by March 1 so that these titles can be 
included in the IPPS proposed rule. A 
complete addendum describing details 
of all changes to ICD–9–CM, both 
tabular and index, is published on the 
CMS and NCHS Web sites in May of 
each year. Publishers of coding books 
and software use this information to 
modify their products that are used by 
health care providers. This 5-month 
time period has proved to be necessary 
for hospitals and other providers to 
update their systems. 
A discussion of this timeline and the 
need for changes are included in the 
December 4–5, 2005 ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee minutes. The public agreed 
that there was a need to hold the fall 
meetings earlier, in September or 
October, in order to meet the new 
implementation dates. The public 
provided comment that additional time 
would be needed to update hospital 
systems and obtain new code books and 
coding software. There was considerable 
concern expressed about the impact this 
new April update would have on 
providers. 
In the FY 2005 IPPS final rule, we 
implemented section 1886(d)(5)(K)(vii) 
of the Act, as added by section 503(a) 
of Pub. L. 108–173, by developing a 
mechanism for approving, in time for 
the April update, diagnosis and 
procedure code revisions needed to 
describe new technologies and medical 
services for purposes of the new 
technology add-on payment process. We 
also established the following process 
for making these determinations. Topics 
considered during the Fall ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee meeting are considered for 
an April 1 update if a strong and 
convincing case is made by the 
requester at the Committee’s public 
meeting. The request must identify the 
reason why a new code is needed in 
April for purposes of the new 
technology process. The participants at 
the meeting and those reviewing the 
Committee meeting summary report are 
provided the opportunity to comment 
on this expedited request. All other 
topics are considered for the October 1 
update. Participants at the Committee 
meeting are encouraged to comment on 
all such requests. There were no 
requests approved for an expedited 
April l, 2008 implementation of an ICD– 
9–CM code at the September 27–28, 
2007 Committee meeting. Therefore, 
there were no new ICD–9–CM codes 
implemented on April 1, 2008. 
We believe that this process captures 
the intent of section 1886(d)(5)(K)(vii) of 
the Act. This requirement was included 
in the provision revising the standards 
and process for recognizing new 
technology under the IPPS. In addition, 
the need for approval of new codes 
outside the existing cycle (October 1) 
arises most frequently and most acutely 
where the new codes will identify new 
technologies that are (or will be) under 
consideration for new technology add- 
on payments. Thus, we believe this 
provision was intended to expedite data 
collection through the assignment of 
new ICD–9–CM codes for new 
technologies seeking higher payments. 
Current addendum and code title 
information is published on the CMS 
Web site at: www.cms.hhs.gov/
icd9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/ 
01_overview.asp#TopofPage. 
Information on ICD–9–CM diagnosis 
codes, along with the Official ICD–9– 
CM Coding Guidelines, can be found on 
the Web site at: www.cdc.gov/nchs/ 
icd9.htm. Information on new, revised, 
and deleted ICD–9–CM codes is also 
provided to the AHA for publication in 
the Coding Clinic for ICD–9–CM. AHA 
also distributes information to 
publishers and software vendors. 
CMS also sends copies of all ICD–9– 
CM coding changes to its contractors for 
use in updating their systems and 
providing education to providers. 
These same means of disseminating 
information on new, revised, and 
deleted ICD–9–CM codes will be used to 
notify providers, publishers, software 
vendors, contractors, and others of any 
changes to the ICD–9–CM codes that are 
implemented in April. The code titles 
are adopted as part of the ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee process. Thus, although we 
publish the code titles in the IPPS 
proposed and final rules, they are not 
subject to comment in the proposed or 
final rules. We will continue to publish 
the October code updates in this manner 
within the IPPS proposed and final 
rules. For codes that are implemented in 
April, we will assign the new procedure 
code to the same DRG in which its 
predecessor code was assigned so there 
will be no DRG impact as far as DRG 
assignment. Any midyear coding 
updates will be available through the 
Web sites indicated above and through 
the Coding Clinic for ICD–9–CM. 
Publishers and software vendors 
currently obtain code changes through 
these sources in order to update their 
code books and software systems. We 
will strive to have the April 1 updates 
available through these Web sites 5 
months prior to implementation (that is, 
early November of the previous year), as 
is the case for the October 1 updates. 
H. Recalibration of MS–DRG Weights 
In section II.E. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we state that we are 
proposing to fully implement the cost- 
based DRG relative weights for FY 2009, 
which is the third year in the 3-year 
transition period to calculate the 
relative weights at 100 percent based on 
costs. In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47267), as 
recommended by RTI, for FY 2008, we 
added two new CCRs for a total of 15 
CCRs: one for ‘‘Emergency Room’’ and 
one for ‘‘Blood and Blood Products,’’ 
both of which can be derived directly 
from the Medicare cost report. 
In developing the FY 2009 proposed 
system of weights, we used two data 
sources: claims data and cost report 
data. As in previous years, the claims 
data source is the MedPAR file. This file 
is based on fully coded diagnostic and 
procedure data for all Medicare 
inpatient hospital bills. The FY 2007 
MedPAR data used in this proposed rule 
include discharges occurring on October 
1, 2006, through September 30, 2007, 
based on bills received by CMS through 
December 2007, from all hospitals 
subject to the IPPS and short-term, acute 
care hospitals in Maryland (which are 
under a waiver from the IPPS under 
section 1814(b)(3) of the Act). The FY 
2007 MedPAR file used in calculating 
the relative weights includes data for 
approximately 11,433,806 Medicare 
discharges from IPPS providers. 
Discharges for Medicare beneficiaries 
enrolled in a Medicare Advantage 
managed care plan are excluded from 
this analysis. The data exclude CAHs, 
including hospitals that subsequently 
became CAHs after the period from 
which the data were taken. The second 
data source used in the cost-based 
relative weighting methodology is the 
FY 2006 Medicare cost report data files 
from HCRIS (that is, cost reports 
beginning on or after October 1, 2005, 
and before October 1, 2006), which 
represents the most recent full set of 
cost report data available. We used the

23582 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
December 31, 2007 update of the HCRIS 
cost report files for FY 2006 in setting 
the relative cost-based weights. 
The methodology we used to calculate 
the DRG cost-based relative weights 
from the FY 2007 MedPAR claims data 
and FY 2006 Medicare cost report data 
is as follows: 
• To the extent possible, all the 
claims were regrouped using the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–DRG 
classifications discussed in sections II.B. 
and G. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule. 
• The transplant cases that were used 
to establish the relative weights for heart 
and heart-lung, liver and/or intestinal, 
and lung transplants (MS–DRGs 001, 
002, 005, 006, and 007, respectively) 
were limited to those Medicare- 
approved transplant centers that have 
cases in the FY 2007 MedPAR file. 
(Medicare coverage for heart, heart-lung, 
liver and/or intestinal, and lung 
transplants is limited to those facilities 
that have received approval from CMS 
as transplant centers.) 
• Organ acquisition costs for kidney, 
heart, heart-lung, liver, lung, pancreas, 
and intestinal (or multivisceral organs) 
transplants continue to be paid on a 
reasonable cost basis. Because these 
acquisition costs are paid separately 
from the prospective payment rate, it is 
necessary to subtract the acquisition 
charges from the total charges on each 
transplant bill that showed acquisition 
charges before computing the average 
cost for each DRG and before 
eliminating statistical outliers. 
• Claims with total charges or total 
length of stay less than or equal to zero 
were deleted. Claims that had an 
amount in the total charge field that 
differed by more than $10.00 from the 
sum of the routine day charges, 
intensive care charges, pharmacy 
charges, special equipment charges, 
therapy services charges, operating 
room charges, cardiology charges, 
laboratory charges, radiology charges, 
other service charges, labor and delivery 
charges, inhalation therapy charges, 
emergency room charges, blood charges, 
and anesthesia charges were also 
deleted. 
• At least 96.1 percent of the 
providers in the MedPAR file had 
charges for 10 of the 15 cost centers. 
Claims for providers that did not have 
charges greater than zero for at least 10 
of the 15 cost centers were deleted. 
• Statistical outliers were eliminated 
by removing all cases that were beyond 
3.0 standard deviations from the mean 
of the log distribution of both the total 
charges per case and the total charges 
per day for each DRG. 
Once the MedPAR data were trimmed 
and the statistical outliers were 
removed, the charges for each of the 15 
cost groups for each claim were 
standardized to remove the effects of 
differences in area wage levels, IME and 
DSH payments, and for hospitals in 
Alaska and Hawaii, the applicable cost- 
of-living adjustment. Because hospital 
charges include charges for both 
operating and capital costs, we 
standardized total charges to remove the 
effects of differences in geographic 
adjustment factors, cost-of-living 
adjustments, DSH payments, and IME 
adjustments under the capital IPPS as 
well. Charges were then summed by 
DRG for each of the 15 cost groups so 
that each DRG had 15 standardized 
charge totals. These charges were then 
adjusted to cost by applying the national 
average CCRs developed from the FY 
2006 cost report data. 
The 15 cost centers that we used in 
the relative weight calculation are 
shown in the following table. The table 
shows the lines on the cost report and 
the corresponding revenue codes that 
we used to create the 15 national cost 
center CCRs.

BILLING CODE 4120–01–C 
We developed the national average 
CCRs as follows: 
Taking the FY 2006 cost report data, 
we removed CAHs, Indian Health 
Service hospitals, all-inclusive rate 
hospitals, and cost reports that 
represented time periods of less than 1 
year (365 days). We included hospitals 
located in Maryland as we are including 
their charges in our claims database. We 
then created CCRs for each provider for 
each cost center (see prior table for line 
items used in the calculations) and 
removed any CCRs that were greater 
than 10 or less than 0.01. We 
normalized the departmental CCRs by 
dividing the CCR for each department 
by the total CCR for the hospital for the 
purpose of trimming the data. We then 
took the logs of the normalized cost 
center CCRs and removed any cost

center CCRs where the log of the cost 
center CCR was greater or less than the 
mean log plus/minus 3 times the 
standard deviation for the log of that 
cost center CCR. Once the cost report 
data were trimmed, we calculated a 
Medicare-specific CCR. The Medicare- 
specific CCR was determined by taking 
the Medicare charges for each line item 
from Worksheet D–4 and deriving the 
Medicare-specific costs by applying the 
hospital-specific departmental CCRs to 
the Medicare-specific charges for each 
line item from Worksheet D–4. Once 
each hospital’s Medicare-specific costs 
were established, we summed the total 
Medicare-specific costs and divided by 
the sum of the total Medicare-specific 
charges to produce national average, 
charge-weighted CCRs. 
After we multiplied the total charges 
for each DRG in each of the 15 cost 
centers by the corresponding national 
average CCR, we summed the 15 ‘‘costs’’ 
across each DRG to produce a total 
standardized cost for the DRG. The 
average standardized cost for each DRG 
was then computed as the total 
standardized cost for the DRG divided 
by the transfer-adjusted case count for 
the DRG. The average cost for each DRG 
was then divided by the national 
average standardized cost per case to 
determine the relative weight. 
The new cost-based relative weights 
were then normalized by an adjustment 
factor of 1.50612 so that the average case 
weight after recalibration was equal to 
the average case weight before 
recalibration. The normalization 
adjustment is intended to ensure that 
recalibration by itself neither increases 
nor decreases total payments under the 
IPPS, as required by section 
1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act. 
The 15 proposed national average 
CCRs for FY 2009 are as follows: 
Group CCR 
Routine Days .................................. 0.527 
Intensive Days ................................ 0.476 
Drugs .............................................. 0.205 
Supplies & Equipment .................... 0.341 
Therapy Services ............................ 0.419 
Laboratory ....................................... 0.166 
Operating Room ............................. 0.293

Other Services ................................ 0.419 
Labor & Delivery ............................. 0.482 
Inhalation Therapy .......................... 0.198 
Anesthesia ...................................... 0.150 
As we explained in section II.E. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, we are 
proposing to complete our 2-year 
transition to the MS–DRGs. For FY 
2008, the first year of the transition, 50 
percent of the relative weight for an 
MS–DRG was based on the two-thirds 
cost-based weight/one-third charge- 
based weight calculated using FY 2006 
MedPAR data grouped to the Version 
24.0 (FY 2007) DRGs. The remaining 50 
percent of the FY 2008 relative weight 
for an MS–DRG was based on the two- 
thirds cost-based weight/one-third 
charge-based weight calculated using 
FY 2006 MedPAR grouped to the 
Version 25.0 (FY 2008) MS–DRGs. In FY 
2009, we are proposing that the relative 
weights will be based on 100 percent 
cost weights computed using the 
Version 26.0 (FY 2009) MS–DRGs. 
When we recalibrated the DRG 
weights for previous years, we set a 
threshold of 10 cases as the minimum 
number of cases required to compute a 
reasonable weight. We are proposing to 
use that same case threshold in 
recalibrating the MS–DRG weights for 
FY 2009. Using the FY 2007 MedPAR 
data set, there are 8 MS–DRGs that 
contain fewer than 10 cases. Under the 
MS–DRGs, we have fewer low-volume 
DRGs than under the CMS DRGs 
because we no longer have separate 
DRGs for patients age 0 to 17 years. 
With the exception of newborns, we 
previously separated some DRGs based 
on whether the patient was age 0 to 17 
years or age 17 years and older. Other 
than the age split, cases grouping to 
these DRGs are identical. The DRGs for 
patients age 0 to 17 years generally have 
very low volumes because children are 
typically ineligible for Medicare. In the 
past, we have found that the low 
volume of cases for the pediatric DRGs 
could lead to significant year-to-year 
instability in their relative weights. 
Although we have always encouraged 
non-Medicare payers to develop weights 
applicable to their own patient 
populations, we have heard frequent 
complaints from providers about the use 
of the Medicare relative weights in the 
pediatric population. We believe that 
eliminating this age split in the MS– 
DRGs will provide more stable payment 
for pediatric cases by determining their 
payment using adult cases that are 
much higher in total volume. All of the 
low-volume MS–DRGs listed below are 
for newborns. Newborns are unique and 
require separate DRGs that are not 
mirrored in the adult population. 
Therefore, it remains necessary to retain 
separate DRGs for newborns. In FY 
2009, because we do not have sufficient 
MedPAR data to set accurate and stable 
cost weights for these low-volume MS– 
DRGs, we are proposing to compute 
weights for the low-volume MS–DRGs 
by adjusting their FY 2008 weights by 
the percentage change in the average 
weight of the cases in other MS–DRGs. 
The crosswalk table is shown below:

I. Proposed Medicare Severity Long- 
Term Care (MS–LTC–DRG) 
Reclassifications and Relative Weights 
for LTCHs for FY 2009 
1. Background 
Section 123 of the BBRA requires that 
the Secretary implement a PPS for 
LTCHs (that is, a per discharge system 
with a diagnosis-related group (DRG)- 
based patient classification system 
reflecting the differences in patient 
resources and costs). Section 307(b)(1) 
of the BIPA modified the requirements 
of section 123 of the BBRA by requiring 
that the Secretary examine ‘‘the 
feasibility and the impact of basing 
payment under such a system [the long- 
term care hospital (LTCH) PPS] on the 
use of existing (or refined) hospital 
DRGs that have been modified to 
account for different resource use of 
LTCH patients, as well as the use of the 
most recently available hospital 
discharge data.’’ 
When the LTCH PPS was 
implemented for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002, 
we adopted the same DRG patient 
classification system (that is, the CMS 
DRGs) that was utilized at that time 
under the IPPS. As a component of the 
LTCH PPS, we refer to the patient 
classification system as the ‘‘long-term 
care diagnosis-related groups (LTC– 
DRGs).’’ As discussed in greater detail 
below, although the patient 
classification system used under both 
the LTCH PPS and the IPPS are the 
same, the relative weights are different. 
The established relative weight 
methodology and data used under the 
LTCH PPS result in LTC–DRG relative 
weights that reflect ‘‘the differences in 
patient resource use * * *’’ of LTCH 
patients (section 123(a)(1) of the BBRA 
(Pub. L. 106–113). As part of our efforts 
to better recognize severity of illness 
among patients, in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47130), the MS–DRGs and the Medicare 
severity long-term care diagnosis related 
groups (MS–LTC–DRGs) were adopted 
for the IPPS and the LTCH PPS, 
respectively, effective October 1, 2007 
(FY 2008). For a full description of the 
development and implementation of the 
MS–DRGs and MS–LTC–DRGs, we refer 
readers to the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47141 
through 47175 and 47277 through 
47299). (We note that, in that same final 
rule, we revised the regulations at 
§ 412.503 to specify that for LTCH 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2007, when applying the provisions 
of 42 CFR Part 412, Subpart O 
applicable to LTCHs for policy 
descriptions and payment calculations, 
all references to LTC–DRGs would be 
considered a reference to MS–LTC– 
DRGs. For the remainder of this section, 
we present the discussion in terms of 
the current MS–LTC–DRG patient 
classification unless specifically 
referring to the previous LTC–DRG 
patient classification system (that was in 
effect before October 1, 2007).) We 
believe the MS–DRGs (and by extension, 
the MS–LTC–DRGs) represent a 
substantial improvement over the 
previous CMS DRGs in their ability to 
differentiate cases based on severity of 
illness and resource consumption. 
The MS–DRGs represent an increase 
in the number of DRGs by 207 (that is, 
from 538 to 745) (72 FR 47171). In 
addition to improving the DRG system’s 
recognition of severity of illness, we 
believe the MS–DRGs are responsive to 
the public comments that were made on 
the FY 2007 IPPS proposed rule with 
respect to how we should undertake 
further DRG reform. The MS–DRGs use 
the CMS DRGs as the starting point for 
revising the DRG system to better 
recognize resource complexity and 
severity of illness. We have generally 
retained all of the refinements and 
improvements that have been made to 
the base DRGs over the years that 
recognize the significant advancements 
in medical technology and changes to 
medical practice. 
Consistent with section 123 of the 
BBRA as amended by section 307(b)(1) 
of the BIPA and § 412.515, we use 
information derived from LTCH PPS 
patient records to classify LTCH 
discharges into distinct MS–LTC–DRGs 
based on clinical characteristics and 
estimated resource needs. We then 
assign an appropriate weight to the MS– 
LTC–DRGs to account for the difference 
in resource use by patients exhibiting 
the case complexity and multiple 
medical problems characteristic of 
LTCHs. 
Generally, under the LTCH PPS, a 
Medicare payment is made at a 
predetermined specific rate for each 
discharge; and that payment varies by 
the MS–LTC–DRG to which a 
beneficiary’s stay is assigned. Cases are 
classified into MS–LTC–DRGs for 
payment based on the following six data 
elements: 
• Principal diagnosis. 
• Up to eight additional diagnoses. 
• Up to six procedures performed. 
• Age. 
• Sex. 
• Discharge status of the patient. 
Upon the discharge of the patient 
from a LTCH, the LTCH must assign 
appropriate diagnosis and procedure 
codes from the most current version of 
the International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD–9–CM). HIPAA 
Transactions and Code Sets Standards 
regulations at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 162 
require that no later than October 16, 
2003, all covered entities must comply 
with the applicable requirements of 
Subparts A and I through R of Part 162. 
Among other requirements, those 
provisions direct covered entities to use 
the ASC X12N 837 Health Care Claim: 
Institutional, Volumes 1 and 2, Version 
4010, and the applicable standard 
medical data code sets for the 
institutional health care claim or 
equivalent encounter information 
transaction (see 45 CFR 162.1002 and 45 
CFR 162.1102). For additional 
information on the ICD–9–CM Coding 
System, we refer readers to the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47241 through 47243 and 47277 
through 47281). We also refer readers to 
the detailed discussion on correct 
coding practices in the August 30, 2002 
LTCH PPS final rule (67 FR 55981 
through 55983). Additional coding 
instructions and examples are published 
in the Coding Clinic for ICD–9–CM, a 
product of the American Hospital 
Association. 
Medicare contractors (that is, fiscal 
intermediaries or MACs) enter the 
clinical and demographic information 
into their claims processing systems and 
subject this information to a series of 
automated screening processes called 
the Medicare Code Editor (MCE). These 
screens are designed to identify cases 
that require further review before 
assignment into a MS–LTC–DRG can be 
made. During this process, the following 
types of cases are selected for further 
development: 
• Cases that are improperly coded. 
(For example, diagnoses are shown that 
are inappropriate, given the sex of the 
patient. Code 68.69 (Other and 
unspecified radical abdominal 
hysterectomy) would be an 
inappropriate code for a male.) 
• Cases including surgical procedures 
not covered under Medicare. (For 
example, organ transplant in a 
nonapproved transplant center.) 
• Cases requiring more information. 
(For example, ICD–9–CM codes are 
required to be entered at their highest 
level of specificity. There are valid 3- 
digit, 4-digit, and 5-digit codes. That is, 
code 262 (Other severe protein-calorie 
malnutrition) contains all appropriate 
digits, but if it is reported with either 
fewer or more than 3 digits, the claim 
will be rejected by the MCE as invalid.) 
After screening through the MCE, 
each claim is classified into the 
appropriate MS–LTC–DRG by the 
Medicare LTCH GROUPER software.

The Medicare GROUPER software, 
which is used under the LTCH PPS, is 
specialized computer software, and is 
the same GROUPER software program 
used under the IPPS. The GROUPER 
software was developed as a means of 
classifying each case into a MS–LTC– 
DRG on the basis of diagnosis and 
procedure codes and other demographic 
information (age, sex, and discharge 
status). Following the MS–LTC–DRG 
assignment, the Medicare contractor 
determines the prospective payment 
amount by using the Medicare PRICER 
program, which accounts for hospital- 
specific adjustments. Under the LTCH 
PPS, we provide an opportunity for the 
LTCH to review the MS–LTC–DRG 
assignments made by the Medicare 
contractor and to submit additional 
information within a specified 
timeframe as specified in § 412.513(c). 
The GROUPER software is used both 
to classify past cases to measure relative 
hospital resource consumption to 
establish the DRG weights and to 
classify current cases for purposes of 
determining payment. The records for 
all Medicare hospital inpatient 
discharges are maintained in the 
MedPAR file. The data in this file are 
used to evaluate possible MS–DRG 
classification changes and to recalibrate 
the MS–DRG and MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights during our annual update under 
both the IPPS (§ 412.60(e)) and the 
LTCH PPS (§ 412.517), respectively. 
In the June 6, 2003 LTCH PPS final 
rule (68 FR 34122), we changed the 
LTCH PPS annual payment rate update 
cycle to be effective July 1 through June 
30 instead of October 1 through 
September 30. In addition, because the 
patient classification system utilized 
under the LTCH PPS uses the same 
DRGs as those used under the IPPS for 
acute care hospitals, in that same final 
rule, we explained that the annual 
update of the LTC–DRG classifications 
and relative weights will continue to 
remain linked to the annual 
reclassification and recalibration of the 
DRGs used under the IPPS. Therefore, 
we specified that we will continue to 
update the LTC–DRG classifications and 
relative weights to be effective for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1 through September 30 each year. We 
further stated that we will publish the 
annual proposed and final update of the 
LTC–DRGs in same notice as the 
proposed and final update for the IPPS 
(69 FR 34125). 
In the RY 2009 LTCH PPS proposed 
rule (73 FR 5351–5352), due to 
administrative considerations as well as 
in response to numerous comments 
urging CMS to establish one rulemaking 
cycle that would encompass the update 
of the LTCH PPS payment rates 
(currently updated on a rate year basis, 
effective July 1) as well as the 
development of the LTC–DRG weights 
(currently updated on a fiscal year basis, 
effective October 1), we proposed to 
amend the regulations at § 412.535 in 
order to consolidate the rate year and 
fiscal year rulemaking cycles. 
Specifically, we proposed that the 
annual update of the LTCH PPS 
payment rates (and description of the 
methodology and data used to calculate 
these payment rates) and the annual 
update of the MS–LTC–DRG 
classifications and associated weighting 
factors for LTCHs would be effective on 
October 1 each Federal fiscal year. In 
order to revise the payment rate update 
(currently on a rate year cycle of July 1 
through June 30) to an October 1 
through September 30 cycle, we 
proposed to extend the 2009 rate period 
to September 30, 2009, so that RY 2009 
would be 15 months. This proposed 15- 
month rate period would extend from 
July 1, 2008, through September 30, 
2009. We believe that extending RY 
2009 by 3 months (July, August, and 
September) would provide for a smooth 
transition to a consolidated annual 
update for both the LTCH PPS payment 
rates and the LTCH PPS MS–LTC–DRG 
classifications and weighting factors. 
(We believe that proposing to shorten 
the 2009 rate year period to an October 
1 through September 30 period so that 
RY 2009 would only be 3 months (that 
is, July 1, 2008 through September 30, 
2008) would exacerbate the current 
time-consuming, biannual update 
process by resulting in two payment rate 
changes within a very short period of 
time.) Consequently, under the proposal 
to extend RY 2009 to a 15-month rate 
period, after September 30, 2009, when 
the RY 2009 cycle ends, the LTCH PPS 
payment rates and other policy changes 
would subsequently be updated on an 
October 1 through September 30 cycle 
in conjunction with the annual update 
to the MS–LTC–DRG classifications and 
relative weights. Accordingly, the next 
update to the LTCH PPS payment rates, 
after the proposed 15-month RY 2009, 
would begin October 1, 2009, coinciding 
with the 2010 Federal fiscal year. 
In the past, the annual update to the 
DRGs used under the IPPS has been 
based on the annual revisions to the 
ICD–9–CM codes and was effective each 
October 1. As discussed in the RY 2009 
LTCH PPS proposed rule (73 FR 5348– 
5349), with the implementation of 
section 503(a) of Pub. L. 108–173, there 
is the possibility that one feature of the 
GROUPER software program may be 
updated twice during a Federal fiscal 
year (October 1 and April 1) as required 
by the statute for the IPPS. Section 
503(a) of Pub. L. 108–173 amended 
section 1886(d)(5)(K) of the Act by 
adding a new clause (vii) which states 
that ‘‘the Secretary shall provide for the 
addition of new diagnosis and 
procedure codes in [sic] April 1 of each 
year, but the addition of such codes 
shall not require the Secretary to adjust 
the payment (or diagnosis-related group 
classification) * * * until the fiscal year 
that begins after such date.’’ This 
requirement improves the recognition of 
new technologies under the IPPS by 
accounting for those ICD–9–CM codes 
in the MedPAR claims data earlier than 
the agency had accounted for new 
technology in the past. In implementing 
the statutory change, the agency has 
provided that ICD–9–CM diagnosis and 
procedure codes for new medical 
technology may be created and assigned 
to existing DRGs in the middle of the 
Federal fiscal year, on April 1. However, 
this policy change will not impact the 
DRG relative weights in effect for that 
year, which will continue to be updated 
only once a year (October 1). The use of 
the ICD–9–CM code set is also 
compliant with the current 
requirements of the Transactions and 
Code Sets Standards regulations at 45 
CFR Parts 160 and 162, promulgated in 
accordance with HIPAA. 
As noted above, the patient 
classification system used under the 
LTCH PPS is the same patient 
classification system that is used under 
the IPPS. Therefore, the ICD–9–CM 
codes currently used under both the 
IPPS and the LTCH PPS have the 
potential of being updated twice a year. 
This requirement is included as part of 
the amendments to the Act relating to 
recognition of new medical technology 
under the IPPS. 
Because we do not publish a midyear 
IPPS rule, any April 1 ICD–9–CM 
coding update will not be published in 
the Federal Register. Rather, we will 
assign any new diagnosis or procedure 
codes to the same DRG in which its 
predecessor code was assigned, so that 
there will be no impact on the DRG 
assignments (as also discussed in 
section II.G.11. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule). Any coding updates will 
be available through the Web sites 
provided in section II.G.11. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule and 
through the Coding Clinic for ICD–9– 
CM. Publishers and software vendors 
currently obtain code changes through 
these sources in order to update their 
code books and software system. If new 
codes are implemented on April 1, 
revised code books and software 
systems, including the GROUPER

software program, will be necessary 
because the most current ICD–9–CM 
codes must be reported. Therefore, for 
purposes of the LTCH PPS, because 
each ICD–9–CM code must be included 
in the GROUPER algorithm to classify 
each case under the correct LTCH PPS, 
the GROUPER software program used 
under the LTCH PPS would need to be 
revised to accommodate any new codes. 
In implementing section 503(a) of 
Pub. L. 108–173, there will only be an 
April 1 update if new technology 
diagnosis and procedure code revisions 
are requested and approved. We note 
that any new codes created for April 1 
implementation will be limited to those 
primarily needed to describe new 
technologies and medical services. 
However, we reiterate that the process 
of discussing updates to the ICD–9–CM 
is an open process through the ICD–9– 
CM Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee. Requestors will be given the 
opportunity to present the merits for a 
new code and to make a clear and 
convincing case for the need to update 
ICD–9–CM codes for purposes of the 
IPPS new technology add-on payment 
process through an April 1 update (as 
also discussed in section II.G.11. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule). 
At the September 27, 2007 ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee meeting, there were no 
requests for an April 1, 2008 
implementation of ICD–9–CM codes. 
Therefore, the next update to the ICD– 
9–CM coding system will occur on 
October 1, 2008 (FY 2009). Because 
there were no coding changes suggested 
for an April 1, 2008 update, the ICD–9– 
CM coding set implemented on October 
1, 2008, will continue through 
September 30, 2009 (FY 2009). The 
update to the ICD–9–CM coding system 
for FY 2009 is discussed in section 
II.G.11. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule. Accordingly, in this proposed rule, 
as discussed in greater detail below, we 
are proposing to modify and revise the 
MS–LTC–DRG classifications and 
relative weights to be effective October 
1, 2008 through September 30, 2009 (FY 
2009). As discussed in greater detail 
below, the MS–LTC–DRGs for FY 2009 
in this proposed rule are the same as the 
MS–DRGs proposed for the IPPS for FY 
2009 (GROUPER Version 26.0) 
discussed in section II.B. of the 
preamble to this proposed rule. 
2. Proposed Changes in the MS–LTC– 
DRG Classifications 
a. Background 
As discussed earlier, section 123 of 
Pub. L. 106–113 specifically requires 
that the agency implement a PPS for 
LTCHs that is a per discharge system 
with a DRG-based patient classification 
system reflecting the differences in 
patient resources and costs in LTCHs. 
Section 307(b)(1) of Pub. L. 106–554 
modified the requirements of section 
123 of Pub. L. 106–113 by specifically 
requiring that the Secretary examine 
‘‘the feasibility and the impact of basing 
payment under such a system [the 
LTCH PPS] on the use of existing (or 
refined) hospital diagnosis-related 
groups (DRGs) that have been modified 
to account for different resource use of 
long-term care hospital patients as well 
as the use of the most recently available 
hospital discharge data.’’ 
Consistent with section 123 of Pub. L. 
106–113 as amended by section 
307(b)(1) of Pub. L. 106–554 and 
§ 412.515 of our existing regulations, the 
LTCH PPS uses information from LTCH 
patient records to classify patient cases 
into distinct LTC–DRGs based on 
clinical characteristics and expected 
resource needs. As described in section 
II.D. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule, for FY 2008, we adopted MS–DRGs 
under the IPPS because we believe that 
this system results in a significant 
improvement in the DRG system’s 
recognition of severity of illness and 
resource usage. We stated that we 
believe these improvements in the DRG 
system are equally applicable to the 
LTCH PPS. The changes we are 
proposing to make for the FY 2009 IPPS 
are reflected in the proposed FY 2009 
GROUPER, Version 26.0, that would be 
effective for discharges occurring on or 
after October 1, 2008 through September 
30, 2009. 
Consistent with our historical practice 
of having LTC–DRGs correspond to the 
DRGs applicable under the IPPS, under 
the broad authority of section 123(a) of 
Pub. L. 106–113, as modified by section 
307(b) of Pub. L. 106–554, under the 
LTCH PPS for FY 2008, we adopted the 
use of MS–LTC–DRGs, which 
correspond to the MS–DRGs we adopted 
under the IPPS. In addition, as stated 
above, we are proposing to use the FY 
2009 GROUPER Version 26.0 to classify 
cases effective for LTCH discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 2008, 
through September 30, 2009. The 
changes to the MS–DRG classification 
system that we are proposing to use 
under the IPPS for FY 2009 (GROUPER 
Version 26.0) are discussed in section 
II.B. of the preamble to this proposed 
rule. 
Under the LTCH PPS, as described in 
greater detail below, we determine 
relative weights for each of the MS– 
LTC–DRGs to account for the difference 
in resource use by patients exhibiting 
the case complexity and multiple 
medical problems characteristic of 
LTCH patients. (Unless otherwise noted 
in this proposed rule, our MS–LTC– 
DRG analysis is based on LTCH data 
from the December 2007 update of the 
FY 2007 MedPAR file, which contains 
hospital bills received through 
December 31, 2007, for discharges 
occurring in FY 2007.) 
LTCHs do not typically treat the full 
range of diagnoses as do acute care 
hospitals. Therefore, as we discussed in 
the August 30, 2002 LTCH PPS final 
rule (67 FR 55985), which implemented 
the LTCH PPS, and the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47283), we use low-volume quintiles in 
determining the DRG relative weights 
for DRGs with less than 25 LTCH cases 
(low-volume MS–LTC–DRGs). 
Specifically, we group those low- 
volume DRGs into 5 quintiles based on 
average charges per discharge. (A listing 
of the composition of low-volume 
quintiles for the FY 2008 MS–LTC– 
DRGs (based on FY 2006 MedPAR data) 
appears in section II.I.3. of the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47281 through 47288).) We also 
adjust for cases in which the stay at the 
LTCH is less than or equal to five-sixths 
of the geometric average length of stay; 
that is, short-stay outlier cases, as 
discussed below in section II.I.4. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule. 
b. Patient Classifications Into MS–LTC– 
DRGs 
Generally, under the LTCH PPS, 
Medicare payment is made at a 
predetermined specific rate for each 
discharge; that is, payment varies by the 
DRG to which a beneficiary’s stay is 
assigned. Just as cases have been 
classified into the MS–DRGs for acute 
care hospitals under the IPPS (section 
II.B. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule), cases have been classified into 
MS–LTC–DRGs for payment under the 
LTCH PPS based on the principal 
diagnosis, up to eight additional 
diagnoses, and up to six procedures 
performed during the stay, as well as 
demographic information about the 
patient. The diagnosis and procedure 
information is reported by the hospital 
using the ICD–9–CM coding system. 
Under the MS–DRGs for the IPPS and 
the MS–LTC–DRGs for the LTCH PPS, 
these factors will not change. 
Section II.B. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule discusses the 
organization of the existing MS–DRGs, 
which we are maintaining under the 
MS–LTC–DRG system. As noted above, 
the patient classification system for the 
LTCH PPS is derived from the IPPS 
DRGs and is similarly organized into 25 
major diagnostic categories (MDCs).

Most of these MDCs are based on a 
particular organ system of the body and 
the remainder involves multiple organ 
systems (such as MDC 22, Burns). 
Accordingly, the principal diagnosis 
determines MDC assignment. Within 
most MDCs, cases are then divided into 
surgical DRGs and medical DRGs. Under 
the MS–DRGs, some surgical and 
medical DRGs are further defined for 
severity purposes based on the presence 
or absence of MCCs or CCs. The existing 
MS–LTC–DRGs are similarly 
categorized. (We refer readers to section 
II.B. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule for further discussion of surgical 
DRGs and medical DRGs.) 
Therefore, consistent with the MS– 
DRGs, a base MS–LTC–DRG may be 
subdivided according to three 
alternatives. The first alternative 
includes division of the DRG into one, 
two, or three severity levels. The most 
severe level has cases with at least one 
code that is a major CC, referred to as 
‘‘with MCC’’. The next lower severity 
level contains cases with at least one 
CC, referred to as ‘‘with CC’’. Those 
DRGs without an MCC or a CC are 
referred to as ‘‘without CC/MCC’’. When 
data do not support the creation of three 
severity levels, the base DRG is divided 
into either two levels or the base is not 
subdivided. 
The two-level subdivisions consist of 
one of the following subdivisions: ‘‘with 
CC/MCC’’ or ‘‘without CC/MCC.’’ In this 
type of subdivision, cases with at least 
one code that is on the CC or MCC list 
are assigned to the ‘‘ CC/MCC’’ DRG. 
Cases without a CC or an MCC are 
assigned to the ‘‘without CC/MCC’’ 
DRG. 
The other type of two-level 
subdivision is as follows: ‘‘with MCC’’ 
and ‘‘without MCC.’’ In this type of 
subdivision, cases with at least one code 
that is on the MCC list are assigned to 
the ‘‘with MCC’’ DRG. Cases that do not 
have an MCC are assigned to the 
‘‘without MCC’’ DRG. This type of 
subdivision could include cases with a 
CC code, but no MCC. 
3. Development of the Proposed FY 
2009 MS–LTC–DRG Relative Weights 
a. General Overview of Development of 
the MS–LTC–DRG Relative Weights 
As we stated in the August 30, 2002 
LTCH PPS final rule (67 FR 55981), one 
of the primary goals for the 
implementation of the LTCH PPS is to 
pay each LTCH an appropriate amount 
for the efficient delivery of medical care 
to Medicare patients. The system must 
be able to account adequately for each 
LTCH’s case-mix in order to ensure both 
fair distribution of Medicare payments 
and access to adequate care for those 
Medicare patients whose care is more 
costly. To accomplish these goals, we 
have annually adjusted the LTCH PPS 
standard Federal prospective payment 
system rate by the applicable relative 
weight in determining payment to 
LTCHs for each case. (As we have noted 
above, in last year’s final rule, we 
adopted the MS–LTC–DRGs for the 
LTCH PPS beginning in FY 2008. 
However, this change in the patient 
classification system does not affect the 
basic principles of the development of 
relative weights under a DRG-based 
prospective payment system. 
Although the adoption of the MS– 
LTC–DRGs resulted in some 
modifications of existing procedures for 
assigning weights in cases of zero 
volume and/or nonmonotonicity, as 
discussed in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47289 
through 47295) and discussed in detail 
in the following sections, the basic 
methodology for developing the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in this proposed rule 
continue to be determined in 
accordance with the general 
methodology established in the August 
30, 2002 LTCH PPS final rule (67 FR 
55989 through 55991). Under the LTCH 
PPS, relative weights for each MS–LTC– 
DRG are a primary element used to 
account for the variations in cost per 
discharge and resource utilization 
among the payment groups (§ 412.515). 
To ensure that Medicare patients 
classified to each MS–LTC–DRG have 
access to an appropriate level of services 
and to encourage efficiency, we 
calculate a relative weight for each MS– 
LTC–DRG that represents the resources 
needed by an average inpatient LTCH 
case in that MS–LTC–DRG. For 
example, cases in an MS–LTC–DRG 
with a relative weight of 2 will, on 
average, cost twice as much to treat as 
cases in an MS–LTC–DRG with a weight 
of 1. 
b. Data 
To calculate the proposed MS–LTC– 
DRG relative weights for FY 2009, we 
obtained total Medicare allowable 
charges from FY 2007 Medicare LTCH 
bill data from the December 2007 
update of the MedPAR file, which are 
the best available data at this time, and 
we used the proposed Version 26.0 of 
the CMS GROUPER that is also 
proposed for use under the IPPS to 
classify cases for FY 2009. We also are 
proposing that if more recent data are 
available, we will use those data and the 
finalized Version 26.0 of the CMS 
GROUPER in establishing the FY 2009 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weights in the 
final rule. 
Consistent with our historical 
methodology, we have excluded the 
data from LTCHs that are all-inclusive 
rate providers and LTCHs that are 
reimbursed in accordance with 
demonstration projects authorized 
under section 402(a) of Pub. L. 90–248 
or section 222(a) of Pub. L. 92–603 (We 
refer readers to the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
47282)). Therefore, in the development 
of the proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in this proposed rule, 
we have excluded the data of the 17 all- 
inclusive rate providers and the 2 
LTCHs that are paid in accordance with 
demonstration projects that had claims 
in the FY 2007 MedPAR file. 
c. Hospital-Specific Relative Value 
(HSRV) Methodology 
By nature, LTCHs often specialize in 
certain areas, such as ventilator- 
dependent patients and rehabilitation 
and wound care. Some case types 
(DRGs) may be treated, to a large extent, 
in hospitals that have, from a 
perspective of charges, relatively high 
(or low) charges. This nonarbitrary 
distribution of cases with relatively high 
(or low) charges in specific MS–LTC– 
DRGs has the potential to 
inappropriately distort the measure of 
average charges. To account for the fact 
that cases may not be randomly 
distributed across LTCHs, we are 
proposing to use a hospital-specific 
relative value (HSRV) methodology to 
calculate the MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights instead of the methodology 
used to determine the MS–DRG relative 
weights under the IPPS described in 
section II.H. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule. We believe this method 
will remove this hospital-specific source 
of bias in measuring LTCH average 
charges. Specifically, we are proposing 
to reduce the impact of the variation in 
charges across providers on any 
particular MS–LTC–DRG relative weight 
by converting each LTCH’s charge for a 
case to a relative value based on that 
LTCH’s average charge. 
Under the HSRV methodology, we 
standardize charges for each LTCH by 
converting its charges for each case to 
hospital-specific relative charge values 
and then adjusting those values for the 
LTCH’s case-mix. The adjustment for 
case-mix is needed to rescale the 
hospital-specific relative charge values 
(which, by definition, average 1.0 for 
each LTCH). The average relative weight 
for a LTCH is its case-mix, so it is 
reasonable to scale each LTCH’s average 
relative charge value by its case-mix. In 
this way, each LTCH’s relative charge 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 19:42 Apr 29, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\30APP2.SGM 30APP2jle

value is adjusted by its case-mix to an 
average that reflects the complexity of 
the cases it treats relative to the 
complexity of the cases treated by all 
other LTCHs (the average case-mix of all 
LTCHs). 
In accordance with the methodology 
established in the August 30, 2002 
LTCH PPS final rule (67 FR 55989 
through 55991), we continue to 
standardize charges for each case by 
first dividing the adjusted charge for the 
case (adjusted for short-stay outliers 
under § 412.529 as described in section 
II.I.4. (step 3) of the preamble of this 
proposed rule) by the average adjusted 
charge for all cases at the LTCH in 
which the case was treated. Short-stay 
outliers are cases with a length of stay 
that is less than or equal to five-sixths 
the average length of stay of the MS– 
LTC–DRG (§ 412.529 and § 412.503). 
The average adjusted charge reflects the 
average intensity of the health care 
services delivered by a particular LTCH 
and the average cost level of that LTCH. 
The resulting ratio is multiplied by that 
LTCH’s case-mix index to determine the 
standardized charge for the case. 
Multiplying by the LTCH’s case-mix 
index accounts for the fact that the same 
relative charges are given greater weight 
at a LTCH with higher average costs 
than they would at a LTCH with low 
average costs, which is needed to adjust 
each LTCH’s relative charge value to 
reflect its case-mix relative to the 
average case-mix for all LTCHs. Because 
we standardize charges in this manner, 
we count charges for a Medicare patient 
at a LTCH with high average charges as 
less resource intensive than they would 
be at a LTCH with low average charges. 
For example, a $10,000 charge for a case 
at a LTCH with an average adjusted 
charge of $17,500 reflects a higher level 
of relative resource use than a $10,000 
charge for a case at a LTCH with the 
same case-mix, but an average adjusted 
charge of $35,000. We believe that the 
adjusted charge of an individual case 
more accurately reflects actual resource 
use for an individual LTCH because the 
variation in charges due to systematic 
differences in the markup of charges 
among LTCHs is taken into account. 
d. Treatment of Severity Levels in 
Developing Proposed Relative Weights 
Under the proposed MS–LTC–DRGs, 
for purposes of the proposed setting of 
the relative weights, there would be 
three different categories of DRGs based 
on volume of cases within specific MS– 
LTC–DRGs. MS–LTC–DRGs with at least 
25 cases are each assigned a unique 
relative weight; low-volume MS–LTC– 
DRGs (that is, MS–LTC–DRGs that 
contain between one and 24 cases 
annually) are grouped into quintiles 
(described below) and assigned the 
weight of the quintile. No-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs (that is, no cases in the 
database were assigned to those MS– 
LTC–DRGs) are crosswalked to other 
MS–LTC–DRGs based on the clinical 
similarities and assigned the relative 
weight of the crosswalked MS–LTC– 
DRG. (We provide in-depth discussions 
of our proposed policy regarding weight 
setting for low-volume MS–LTC–DRGs 
in section II.I.3.e. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule and for no-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs, under Step 5 in section 
II.I.4. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule.) 
As described above, in response to the 
need to account for severity and pay 
appropriately for cases, we developed a 
severity-adjusted patient classification 
system which we adopted for both the 
IPPS and the LTCH PPS in FY 2008. As 
described in greater detail above, the 
MS–LTC–DRG system can accommodate 
three severity levels: ‘‘with MCC’’ (most 
severe); ‘‘with CC,’’ and ‘‘without CC/ 
MCC’’ (the least severe) with each level 
assigned an individual MS–LTC–DRG 
number. In cases with two subdivisions, 
the levels are either ‘‘with CC/MCC’’ 
and ‘‘without CC/MCC’’ or ‘‘with MCC’’ 
and ‘‘without MCC’’. For example, 
under the MS–LTC–DRG system, 
multiple sclerosis and cerebellar ataxia 
with MCC is MS–LTC–DRG 58; multiple 
sclerosis and cerebellar ataxia with CC 
is MS–LTC–DRG 59; and multiple 
sclerosis and cerebellar ataxia without 
CC/MCC is MS–LTC–DRG 60. For 
purposes of discussion in this section, 
the term ‘‘base DRG’’ is used to refer to 
the DRG category that encompasses all 
levels of severity for that DRG. For 
example, when referring to the entire 
DRG category for multiple sclerosis and 
cerebellar ataxia, which includes the 
above three severity levels, we would 
use the term ‘‘base-DRG.’’ 
As noted above, while the LTCH PPS 
and the IPPS use the same patient 
classification system, the methodology 
that is used to set the DRG weights for 
use in each payment system differs 
because the overall volume of cases in 
the LTCH PPS is much less than in the 
IPPS. As a general rule, consistent with 
the methodology we used when we 
adopted the MS–LTC–DRGs in the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 47278 through 47281), we 
are proposing to determine the FY 2009 
relative weights for the MS–LTC–DRGs 
using the following steps: (1) if an MS– 
LTC–DRG has at least 25 cases, it is 
assigned its own relative weight; (2) if 
an MS–LTC–DRG has between 1 and 24 
cases, it is assigned to a quintile for 
which we will compute a relative 
weight; and (3) if an MS–LTC–DRG has 
no cases, it is crosswalked to another 
MS–LTC–DRG based upon clinical 
similarities to assign an appropriate 
relative weight (as described below in 
detail in Step 5 of the Steps for 
Determining the proposed FY 2009 MS– 
LTC–DRG Relative Weights). 
Furthermore, in determining the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights, when necessary, we are 
proposing to make adjustments to 
account for nonmonotonicity, as 
explained below. 
Theoretically, cases under the MS– 
LTC–DRG system that are more severe 
require greater expenditure of medical 
care resources and will result in higher 
average charges. Therefore, in the three 
severity levels, weights should increase 
with severity, from lowest to highest. If 
the weights do not increase (that is, if 
based on the relative weight 
methodology outlined above, the MS– 
LTC–DRG with MCC would have a 
lower relative weight than one with CC, 
or the MS–LTC–DRG without CC/MCC 
would have a higher relative weight 
than either of the others), there is a 
problem with monotonicity. Since the 
start of the LTCH PPS for FY 2003 (67 
FR 55990), we have adjusted the setting 
of the LTC–DRG relative weights in 
order to maintain monotonicity by 
grouping both sets of cases together and 
establishing a new relative weight for 
both LTC–DRGs. We continue to believe 
that utilizing nonmonotonic relative 
weights to adjust Medicare payments 
would result in inappropriate payments 
because, in a nonmonotonic system, 
cases that are more severe and require 
greater expenditure of medical care 
resources would be paid based on a 
lower relative weight than cases that are 
less severe and require lower resource 
use. The procedure for dealing with 
nonmonotonicity under the MS–LTC– 
DRG classification system is discussed 
in greater detail below in section II.I.4. 
(Step 6) of the preamble of this 
proposed rule. 
e. Proposed Low-Volume MS–LTC– 
DRGs 
In order to account for MS–LTC– 
DRGs with low volume (that is, with 
fewer than 25 LTCH cases), consistent 
with the methodology we established 
when we implemented the LTCH PPS 
(August 30, 2002; 67 FR 55984 through 
55995), we group those ‘‘low-volume 
MS–LTC–DRGs’’ (that is, MS–LTC– 
DRGs that contained between 1 and 24 
cases annually) into one of five 
categories (quintiles) based on average 
charges, for the purposes of determining 
relative weights (72 FR 47283 through 
47288). In determining the proposed FY

2009 MS–LTC–DRG relative weights in 
this proposed rule, we are proposing to 
continue to employ this quintile 
methodology for proposed low-volume 
MS–LTC–DRGs. In addition, in cases 
where the initial assignment of a low- 
volume MS–LTC–DRG to quintiles 
results in nonmonotonicity within a 
base DRG, in order to ensure 
appropriate Medicare payments, 
consistent with our historical 
methodology, we are proposing to make 
adjustments to the treatment of low- 
volume MS–LTC–DRGs to preserve 
monotonicity, as discussed in detail 
below in section II.I.4 (Step 6 of the 
methodology for determining the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights). In this proposed rule, 
using LTCH cases from the December 
2007 update of the FY 2007 MedPAR 
file, we identified 290 MS–LTC–DRGs 
that contained between 1 and 24 cases. 
This list of proposed MS–LTC–DRGs 
was then divided into one of the 
proposed 5 low-volume quintiles, each 
containing 58 MS–LTC–DRGs (290/5 = 
58). We are proposing to make the 
assignment of a low-volume MS–LTC– 
DRG to a specific low-volume quintile 
by sorting the proposed low-volume 
MS–LTC–DRGs in ascending order by 
average charge in accordance with our 
established methodology. Specifically, 
for this proposed rule, the 290 proposed 
low-volume MS–LTC–DRGs are sorted 
by ascending order by average charge 
and assigned to a specific proposed low- 
volume quintile (as described below). 
After sorting the 290 proposed low- 
volume MS–LTC–DRGs by average 
charge in ascending order, we are 
proposing to group the first fifth (1st 
through 58th) of proposed low-volume 
MS–LTC–DRGs (with the lowest average 
charge) into Quintile 1. This process is 
repeated through the remaining 
proposed low-volume MS–LTC–DRGs 
so that each of the 5 proposed low- 
volume quintiles contains 58 proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs. The highest average 
charge cases would be grouped into 
Quintile 5. (We note that, consistent 
with our historical methodology, if the 
number of proposed low-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs had not been evenly 
divisible by 5, we would have used the 
average charge of the proposed low- 
volume MS–LTC–DRG to determine 
which proposed low-volume quintile 
would have received the additional 
proposed low-volume MS–LTC–DRG.) 
Accordingly, in order to determine 
the proposed relative weights for the 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs with low- 
volume for FY 2009, we are proposing 
to use the five low-volume quintiles 
described above. The composition of 
each of the proposed five low-volume 
quintiles shown in the chart below was 
used in determining the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights for FY 2009 
(Table 11 of the Addendum of this 
proposed rule). We would determine a 
proposed relative weight and 
(geometric) average length of stay for 
each of the proposed five low-volume 
quintiles using the methodology that we 
are proposing to apply to the regular 
MS–LTC–DRGs (25 or more cases), as 
described in section II.I.4. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule. We are 
proposing to assign the same relative 
weight and average length of stay to 
each of the proposed low-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs that make up an individual 
low-volume quintile. We note that, as 
this system is dynamic, it is possible 
that the number and specific type of 
MS–LTC–DRGs with a low volume of 
LTCH cases will vary in the future. We 
use the best available claims data in the 
MedPAR file to identify low-volume 
MS–LTC–DRGs and to calculate the 
relative weights based on our 
methodology.

proposed low-volume quintile in addressing nonmonotonicity (refer to step 6 in section II.I.4. of the preamble of this proposed rule). 
We note that we will continue to 
monitor the volume (that is, the number 
of LTCH cases) in the low-volume 
quintiles to ensure that our proposed 
quintile assignment results in 
appropriate payment for such cases and 
does not result in an unintended 
financial incentive for LTCHs to 
inappropriately admit these types of 
cases. 
4. Steps for Determining the Proposed 
FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG Relative 
Weights 
In general, the proposed FY 2009 MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights in this 
proposed rule were determined based 
on the methodology established in the 
August 30, 2002 LTCH PPS final rule 
(67 FR 55989 through 55991). In 
summary, for FY 2009, we are proposing 
to group LTCH cases to the appropriate 
proposed MS–LTC–DRG, while taking 
into account the proposed low-volume 
MS–LTC–DRGs (as described above), 
before the proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC– 
DRG relative weights are determined. 
After grouping the cases to the 
appropriate proposed MS–LTC–DRG (or 
proposed low-volume quintile), we 
would calculate the proposed relative 
weights for FY 2009 by first removing 
statistical outliers and cases with a 
length of stay of 7 days or less (as 
discussed in greater detail below). Next, 
we would adjust the number of cases in 
each proposed MS–LTC–DRG (or 
proposed low-volume quintile) for the 
effect of short-stay outlier cases (as also 
discussed in greater detail below). The 
short-stay adjusted discharges and 
corresponding charges are used to 
calculate ‘‘relative adjusted weights’’ in 
each proposed MS–LTC–DRG (or 
proposed low-volume quintile) using 
the HSRV method (described above). In 
general, to determine the proposed FY 
2009 MS–LTC–DRG relative weights in 
this proposed rule, we are proposing to 
use the same methodology we used in 
determining the FY 2008 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47281 through 47299). However, we are 
proposing to make a modification to our 
methodology for determining proposed 
relative weights for MS–LTC–DRGs with 
no LTCH cases (as discussed in greater 
detail in Step 5 below). Also, we note 
that, although we are generally 
proposing to use the same methodology 
in this proposed rule (with the 
exception noted above) as the 
methodology used in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment, the discussion 
presented below of the steps for 
determining the proposed FY 2009 MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights varies 
slightly from the discussion of the steps 
for determining the FY 2008 MS–LTC– 
DRG relative weights (presented in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment) 
because we are taking this opportunity 
to refine our description to more 
precisely explain our methodology for 
determining the MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights. 
As discussed in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment when we 
adopted the MS–LTC–DRGs, the 
adoption of the MS–LTC–DRGs with 
either two or three severity levels 
resulted in some slight modifications of 
procedures for assigning relative 
weights in cases of zero volume and/or 
nonmonotonicity (described in detail 
below) from the methodology we 
established when we implemented the 
LTCH PPS in the August 30, 2002 LTCH 
PPS final rule. As also discussed in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
when we adopted the MS–LTC–DRGs, 
we implemented the MS–LTC–DRGs 
with a 2-year transition beginning in FY 
2008. For FY 2008, the first year of the 
transition, 50 percent of the relative 
weight for a MS–LTC–DRG was based 
on the average LTC–DRG relative weight 
under Version 24.0 of the LTC–DRG 
GROUPER. The remaining 50 percent of 
the relative weight was based on the 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weight under 
Version 25.0 of the MS–LTC–DRG 
GROUPER. In FY 2009, the MS–LTC– 
DRG relative weights are based on 100 
percent of the MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights. Accordingly, in determining 
the proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in this proposed rule, 
there is no longer a need to include a 
step to calculate MS–LTC–DRG 
transition blended relative weights (see 
Step 7 in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47295)). 
Therefore, in this proposed rule, we 
determined the proposed FY 2009 MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights based solely 
on the proposed MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weight under proposed Version 26.0 of 
the MS–LTC–DRG GROUPER, which is 
discussed in section II.B. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule. 
Furthermore, we are proposing that we 
would determine the final FY 2009 MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights in the final 
rule based on the final Version 26.0 of 
the MS–LTC–DRG GROUPER that will 
be presented in that same final rule. 
Below we discuss in detail the steps 
for calculating the proposed FY 2009 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weights. We note 
that, as we stated above in section 
II.I.3.b. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule, we have excluded the data of all- 
inclusive rate LTCHs and LTCHs that

are paid in accordance with 
demonstration projects that had claims 
in the FY 2007 MedPAR file. 
Step 1—Remove statistical outliers. 
The first step in the calculation of the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights is to remove statistical 
outlier cases. Consistent with our 
historical relative weight methodology, 
we are proposing to continue to define 
statistical outliers as cases that are 
outside of 3.0 standard deviations from 
the mean of the log distribution of both 
charges per case and the charges per day 
for each proposed MS–LTC–DRG. These 
statistical outliers are removed prior to 
calculating the proposed relative 
weights because we believe that they 
may represent aberrations in the data 
that distort the measure of average 
resource use. Including those LTCH 
cases in the calculation of the proposed 
relative weights could result in an 
inaccurate proposed relative weight that 
does not truly reflect relative resource 
use among the proposed MS–LTC– 
DRGs. 
Step 2—Remove cases with a length 
of stay of 7 days or less. 
The MS–LTC–DRG relative weights 
reflect the average of resources used on 
representative cases of a specific type. 
Generally, cases with a length of stay of 
7 days or less do not belong in a LTCH 
because these stays do not fully receive 
or benefit from treatment that is typical 
in a LTCH stay, and full resources are 
often not used in the earlier stages of 
admission to a LTCH. If we were to 
include stays of 7 days or less in the 
computation of the proposed FY 2009 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weights, the 
value of many relative weights would 
decrease and, therefore, payments 
would decrease to a level that may no 
longer be appropriate. We do not believe 
that it would be appropriate to 
compromise the integrity of the 
payment determination for those LTCH 
cases that actually benefit from and 
receive a full course of treatment at a 
LTCH, by including data from these 
very short-stays. Therefore, consistent 
with our historical relative weight 
methodology, in determining the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights, we are proposing to 
remove LTCH cases with a length of stay 
of 7 days or less. 
Step 3—Adjust charges for the effects 
of short-stay outliers. 
After removing cases with a length of 
stay of 7 days or less, we are left with 
cases that have a length of stay of greater 
than or equal to 8 days. As the next step 
in the calculation of the proposed FY 
2009 MS–LTC–DRG relative weights, 
consistent with our historical relative 
weight methodology, we are proposing 
to adjust each LTCH’s charges per 
discharge for those remaining cases for 
the effects of short-stay outliers (as 
defined in § 412.529(a) in conjunction 
with § 412.503 for LTCH discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 2008). 
(We note that even if a case was 
removed in Step 2 (that is, cases with a 
length of stay of 7 days or less), it was 
paid as a short-stay outlier if its length 
of stay was less than or equal to five- 
sixths of the average length of stay of the 
MS–LTC–DRG.) 
We would make this adjustment by 
counting a short-stay outlier as a 
fraction of a discharge based on the ratio 
of the length of stay of the case to the 
average length of stay for the proposed 
MS–LTC–DRG for nonshort-stay outlier 
cases. This has the effect of 
proportionately reducing the impact of 
the lower charges for the short-stay 
outlier cases in calculating the average 
charge for the proposed MS–LTC–DRG. 
This process produces the same result 
as if the actual charges per discharge of 
a short-stay outlier case were adjusted to 
what they would have been had the 
patient’s length of stay been equal to the 
average length of stay of the proposed 
MS–LTC–DRG. 
Counting short-stay outlier cases as 
full discharges with no adjustment in 
determining the proposed FY 2009 MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights would lower 
the proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weight for affected proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs because the relatively 
lower charges of the short-stay outlier 
cases would bring down the average 
charge for all cases within a proposed 
MS–LTC–DRG. This would result in an 
‘‘underpayment’’ for nonshort-stay 
outlier cases and an ‘‘overpayment’’ for 
short-stay outlier cases. Therefore, we 
are proposing to adjust for short-stay 
outlier cases under § 412.529 in this 
manner because it results in more 
appropriate payments for all LTCH 
cases. 
Step 4—Calculate the proposed FY 
2009 MS–LTC–DRG relative weights on 
an iterative basis. 
Consistent with our historical relative 
weight methodology, we are proposing 
to calculate the proposed MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights using the HSRV 
methodology, which is an iterative 
process. First, for each LTCH case, we 
calculate a hospital-specific relative 
charge value by dividing the short-stay 
outlier adjusted charge per discharge 
(see step 3) of the LTCH case (after 
removing the statistical outliers (see 
step 1)) and LTCH cases with a length 
of stay of 7 days or less (see step 2) by 
the average charge per discharge for the 
LTCH in which the case occurred. The 
resulting ratio is then multiplied by the 
LTCH’s case-mix index to produce an 
adjusted hospital-specific relative 
charge value for the case. An initial 
case-mix index value of 1.0 is used for 
each LTCH. 
For each proposed MS–LTC–DRG, the 
proposed FY 2009 relative weight is 
calculated by dividing the average of the 
adjusted hospital-specific relative 
charge values (from above) for the MS– 
LTC–DRG by the overall average 
hospital-specific relative charge value 
across all cases for all LTCHs. Using 
these recalculated MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights, each LTCH’s average 
relative weight for all of its cases (that 
is, its case-mix) is calculated by 
dividing the sum of all the LTCH’s MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights by its total 
number of cases. The LTCH’s hospital- 
specific relative charge values above are 
multiplied by these hospital-specific 
case-mix indexes. These hospital- 
specific case-mix adjusted relative 
charge values are then used to calculate 
a new set of MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights across all LTCHs. This iterative 
process is continued until there is 
convergence between the weights 
produced at adjacent steps, for example, 
when the maximum difference is less 
than 0.0001. 
Step 5—Determine a proposed FY 
2009 relative weight for proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs with no LTCH cases. 
As we stated above, we determine the 
proposed FY 2009 relative weight for 
each proposed MS–LTC–DRG using 
total Medicare allowable charges 
reported in the best available LTCH 
claims data (that is, the December 2007 
update of the FY 2007 MedPAR file for 
this proposed rule). Of the proposed FY 
2009 MS–LTC–DRGs, we identified a 
number of proposed MS–LTC–DRGs for 
which there were no LTCH cases in the 
database. That is, based on data from the 
FY 2007 MedPAR file used for this 
proposed rule, no patients who would 
have been classified to those proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs were treated in LTCHs 
during FY 2007 and, therefore, no 
charge data are available for those 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs. Thus, in the 
process of determining the proposed 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weights, we are 
unable to calculate proposed relative 
weights for these proposed MS–LTC– 
DRGs with no LTCH cases using the 
methodology described in Steps 1 
through 4 above. However, because 
patients with a number of the diagnoses 
under these proposed MS–LTC–DRGs 
may be treated at LTCHs, consistent 
with our historical methodology, we are 
proposing to assign relative weights to 
each of the proposed no-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs based on clinical similarity 
and relative costliness (with the

exception of proposed ‘‘transplant’’ MS– 
LTC–DRGs and proposed ‘‘error’’ MS– 
LTC–DRGs as discussed below). In 
general, we are proposing to determine 
proposed FY 2009 relative weights for 
the proposed MS–LTC–DRGs with no 
LTCH cases in the FY 2007 MedPAR file 
used in this proposed rule (that is, 
proposed ‘‘no-volume MS–LTC–DRGs) 
by cross-walking each proposed no- 
volume MS–LTC–DRG to another 
proposed MS–LTC–DRG with a 
proposed relative weight (determined in 
accordance with the proposed 
methodology described above). Then, 
under our proposed methodology 
presented in this proposed rule, the 
proposed ‘‘no-volume’’ MS–LTC–DRG 
would be assigned the same proposed 
relative weight of the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRG to which it would be cross- 
walked (as described in greater detail 
below). As noted above, we are 
proposing to make a modification to our 
methodology for determining proposed 
relative weights for MS–LTC–DRGs with 
no LTCH cases in this proposed rule, 
which is discussed in greater detail 
below. As also noted above, even where 
we are not proposing changes to our 
existing methodology, we are taking this 
opportunity to refine our description to 
more precisely explain our proposed 
methodology for determining the MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights in this 
proposed rule. 
Specifically, in this proposed rule, we 
are proposing to determine the relative 
weight for each proposed MS–LTC–DRG 
using total Medicare allowable charges 
reported in the December 2007 update 
of the FY 2007 MedPAR file. Of the 746 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs for FY 2009, 
we identified 203 proposed MS–LTC– 
DRGs for which there were no LTCH 
cases in the database (including the 8 
proposed ‘‘transplant’’ MS–LTC–DRGs 
and 2 proposed ‘‘error’’ MS–LTC– 
DRGs). For this proposed rule, as noted 
above, we are proposing to assign 
proposed relative weights for each of the 
203 proposed no-volume MS–LTC– 
DRGs (with the exception of the 8 
proposed ‘‘transplant’’ proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs and the 2 proposed ‘‘error’’ 
MS–LTC–DRGs, which are discussed 
below) based on clinical similarity and 
relative costliness to one of the 
remaining 543 (746 ¥ 203 = 543) 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs for which we 
are able to determine relative weights, 
based on FY 2007 LTCH claims data. 
(For the remainder of this discussion, 
we refer to one of the 543 proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs for which we are able to 
determine relative weight as the 
proposed ‘‘cross-walked’’ MS–LTC– 
DRG.) Then we are proposing to assign 
the proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRG 
the proposed relative weight of the 
proposed cross-walked MS–LTC–DRG. 
This proposed approach differs from the 
one we used to determine the FY 2008 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weights when 
there were no LTCH cases (see 72 FR 
47290). Specifically, in determining the 
FY 2008 MS–LTC–DRG relative weights 
in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, if the no volume MS– 
LTC–DRG was cross-walked to a MS– 
LTC–DRG that had 25 or more cases 
and, therefore, was not in a low-volume 
quintile, we assigned the relative weight 
of a quintile to a no-volume MS–LTC– 
DRG (rather than assigning the relative 
weight of the cross-walked MS–LTC– 
DRG). While we believe this approach 
would result in appropriate LTCH PPS 
payments (because it is consistent with 
our methodology for determining 
relative weights for MS–LTC–DRGs that 
have a low volume of LTCH cases 
(which is discussed above in section 
II.I.3.e. of this preamble)), upon further 
review during the development of the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in this proposed rule, 
we now believe that proposing to assign 
the proposed relative weight of the 
proposed cross-walked MS–LTC–DRG 
to the proposed no-volume MS–LTC– 
DRG would result in more appropriate 
LTCH PPS payments because those 
cases generally require equivalent 
relative resource (and therefore should 
generally have the same LTCH PPS 
payment). The relative weight of each 
MS–LTC–DRG should reflect relative 
resource of the LTCH cases grouped to 
that MS–LTC–DRG. Because the 
proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRGs 
would be cross-walked to other 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs based on 
clinical similarity and relative 
costliness, which usually require 
equivalent relative resource use, we 
believe that assigning the proposed no- 
volume MS–LTC–DRG the proposed 
relative weight of the proposed cross- 
walked MS–LTC–DRG would result in 
appropriate LTCH PPS payments. (As 
explained below in Step 6, when 
necessary, we are proposing to make 
adjustments to account for 
nonmonotonicity.) 
Our proposed methodology for 
determining the proposed relative 
weights for the proposed no-volume 
MS–LTC–DRGs is as follows: We cross- 
walk the proposed no-volume MS–LTC– 
DRG to a proposed MS–LTC–DRG for 
which there are LTCH cases in the FY 
2007 MedPAR file and to which it is 
similar clinically in intensity of use of 
resources and relative costliness as 
determined by criteria such as care 
provided during the period of time 
surrounding surgery, surgical approach 
(if applicable), length of time of surgical 
procedure, postoperative care, and 
length of stay. We then assign the 
proposed relative weight of the 
proposed cross-walked MS–LTC–DRG 
as the proposed relative weight for the 
proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRG 
such that both of these proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs (that is, the proposed no- 
volume MS–LTC–DRG and the 
proposed cross-walked MS–LTC–DRG) 
would have the same proposed relative 
weight. We note that if the proposed 
cross-walked MS–LTC–DRG had 25 
cases or more, its proposed relative 
weight, which was calculated using the 
proposed methodology described in 
steps 1 through 4 above, would be 
assigned to the proposed no-volume 
MS–LTC–DRG as well. Similarly, if the 
proposed MS–LTC–DRG to which the 
proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRG is 
cross-walked has 24 or less cases, and 
therefore was designated to one of the 
proposed low-volume quintiles for 
purposes of determining the proposed 
relative weights, we would assign the 
proposed relative weight of the 
applicable proposed low-volume 
quintile to the proposed no-volume MS– 
LTC–DRG such that both of these 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs (that is, the 
proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRG and 
the proposed cross-walked MS–LTC– 
DRG) would have the same proposed 
relative weight. (As we noted above, in 
the infrequent case where 
nonmonotonicity involving a proposed 
no-volume MS–LTC–DRG results, 
additional measures as described in 
Step 6 would be required in order to 
maintain monotonically increasing 
relative weights.) 
For this proposed rule, a list of the 
proposed no-volume FY 2009 MS–LTC– 
DRGs and the proposed FY 2009 MS– 
LTC–DRG to which it is cross-walked 
(that is, the proposed cross-walked MS– 
LTC–DRG) is shown in the chart below.

To illustrate this methodology for 
determining the proposed relative 
weights for the proposed MS–LTC– 
DRGs with no LTCH cases, we are 
providing the following example, which 
refers to the proposed no-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs crosswalk information for 
FY 2009 provided in the chart above. 
Example: There were no cases in the 
FY 2007 MedPAR file used for this 
proposed rule for proposed MS–LTC– 
DRG 61 (Acute ischemic stroke w use of 
thrombolytic agent w MCC). We 
determined that MS–LTC–DRG 70 
(Nonspecific cebrovascular disorders w 
MCC) is similar clinically and based on 
resource use to proposed MS–LTC–DRG 
61. Therefore, we are proposing to 
assign the same proposed relative 
weight of proposed MS–LTC–DRG 70 of 
0.8718 for FY 2009 to proposed MS– 
LTC–DRG 61 (Table 11 of the 
Addendum of this proposed rule). 
Furthermore, for FY 2009, consistent 
with our historical relative weight 
methodology, we are proposing to 
establish MS–LTC–DRG relative weights 
of 0.0000 for the following proposed 
transplant MS–LTC–DRGs: Heart 
Transplant or Implant of Heart Assist 
System with MCC (MS–LTC–DRG 1); 
Heart Transplant or Implant of Heart 
Assist System without MCC (MS–LTC– 
DRG 2); Liver Transplant with MCC or 
Intestinal Transplant (MS–LTC–DRG 5);

23606 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Liver Transplant without MCC (MS– 
LTC–DRG 6); Lung Transplant (MS– 
LTC–DRG 7); Simultaneous Pancreas/ 
Kidney Transplant (MS–LTC–DRG 8); 
Pancreas Transplant (MS–LTC–DRG 10); 
and Kidney Transplant (MS–LTC–DRG 
652). This is because Medicare will only 
cover these procedures if they are 
performed at a hospital that has been 
certified for the specific procedures by 
Medicare and presently no LTCH has 
been so certified. Based on our research, 
we found that most LTCHs only perform 
minor surgeries, such as minor small 
and large bowel procedures, to the 
extent any surgeries are performed at 
all. Given the extensive criteria that 
must be met to become certified as a 
transplant center for Medicare, we 
believe it is unlikely that any LTCHs 
will become certified as a transplant 
center. In fact, in the more than 20 years 
since the implementation of the IPPS, 
there has never been a LTCH that even 
expressed an interest in becoming a 
transplant center. 
If in the future a LTCH applies for 
certification as a Medicare-approved 
transplant center, we believe that the 
application and approval procedure 
would allow sufficient time for us to 
determine appropriate weights for the 
MS–LTC–DRGs affected. At the present 
time, we would only include these eight 
proposed transplant MS–LTC–DRGs in 
the GROUPER program for 
administrative purposes only. Because 
we use the same GROUPER program for 
LTCHs as is used under the IPPS, 
removing these proposed MS–LTC– 
DRGs would be administratively 
burdensome. 
Again, we note that, as this system is 
dynamic, it is entirely possible that the 
number of proposed MS–LTC–DRGs 
with no volume of LTCH cases based on 
the system will vary in the future. We 
used the most recent available claims 
data in the MedPAR file to identify no- 
volume proposed MS–LTC–DRGs and to 
determine the proposed relative weights 
in this proposed rule. 
Step 6—Adjust the proposed FY 2009 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weights to 
account for nonmonotonically 
increasing relative weights. 
As discussed in section II.B. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, the MS– 
DRGs (used under the IPPS) on which 
the MS–LTC–DRGs are based provide a 
significant improvement in the DRG 
system’s recognition of severity of 
illness and resource usage. The 
proposed MS–DRGs contain base DRGs 
that have been subdivided into one, 
two, or three severity levels. Where 
there are three severity levels, the most 
severe level has at least one code that is 
referred to as an MCC. The next lower 
severity level contains cases with at 
least one code that is a CC. Those cases 
without a MCC or a CC are referred to 
as without CC/MCC. When data did not 
support the creation of three severity 
levels, the base was divided into either 
two levels or the base was not 
subdivided. The two-level subdivisions 
could consist of the CC/MCC and the 
without CC/MCC. Alternatively, the 
other type of two level subdivision 
could consist of the MCC and without 
MCC. 
In those base MS–LTC–DRGs that are 
split into either two or three severity 
levels, cases classified into the ‘‘without 
CC/MCC’’ MS–LTC–DRG are expected 
to have a lower resource use (and lower 
costs) than the ‘‘with CC/MCC’’ MS– 
LTC–DRG (in the case of a two-level 
split) or the ‘‘with CC’’ and ‘‘with MCC’’ 
MS–LTC–DRGs (in the case of a three- 
level split). That is, theoretically, cases 
that are more severe typically require 
greater expenditure of medical care 
resources and will result in higher 
average charges. Therefore, in the three 
severity levels, relative weights should 
increase by severity, from lowest to 
highest. If the relative weights do not 
increase (that is, if within a base MS– 
LTC–DRG, a MS–LTC–DRG with MCC 
has a lower relative weight than one 
with CC, or the MS–LTC–DRG without 
CC/MCC has a higher relative weight 
than either of the others, they are 
nonmonotonic). We continue to believe 
that utilizing nonmonotonic relative 
weights to adjust Medicare payments 
would result in inappropriate payments. 
Consequently, in general, we are 
proposing to combine proposed MS– 
LTC–DRG severity levels within a base 
MS–LTC–DRG for the purpose of 
computing a relative weight when 
necessary to ensure that monotonicity is 
maintained. In determining the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in this proposed rule, in 
general, we are proposing to use the 
same methodology to adjust for 
nonmonotonicity that we used to 
determine the FY 2008 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment (72 FR 47293 
through 47295). However, as noted 
above, we are taking this opportunity to 
refine our description to more precisely 
explain our methodology for 
determining the MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights in this proposed rule. 
Specifically, in determining the 
proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights in this proposed rule, 
under each of the example scenarios 
provided below, we would combine 
severity levels within a base MS–LTC– 
DRG as follows: 
The first example of 
nonmonotonically increasing relative 
weights for a MS–LTC–DRG pertains to 
a base MS–LTC–DRG with a three-level 
split and each of the three levels has 25 
or more LTCH cases and, therefore, 
none of those MS–LTC–DRGs is 
assigned to one of the five low-volume 
quintiles. In this proposed rule, if 
nonmonotonicity is detected in the 
proposed relative weights of the 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs in adjacent 
severity levels (for example, the 
proposed relative weight of the ‘‘with 
MCC’’ (the highest severity level) is less 
than the ‘‘with CC’’ (the middle level), 
or the ‘‘with CC’’ is less than the 
‘‘without CC/MCC’’), we would combine 
the nonmonotonic adjacent proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs and re-determine a 
proposed relative weight based on the 
case-weighted average of the combined 
LTCH cases of the nonmonotonic 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs. The case- 
weighted average charge is calculated by 
dividing the total charges for all LTCH 
cases in both severity levels by the total 
number of LTCH cases for both 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs. The same 
proposed relative weight would be 
assigned to both affected levels of the 
base MS–LTC–DRG. If nonmonotonicity 
remains an issue because the above 
process results in a proposed relative 
weight that is still nonmonotonic to the 
remaining proposed MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weight within the base MS– 
LTC–DRG, we would combine all three 
of the severity levels to redetermine the 
proposed relative weights based on the 
case-weighted average charge of the 
combined severity levels. This same 
proposed relative weight is then 
assigned to each of the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs in that base MS–LTC–DRG. 
A second example of 
nonmonotonically increasing relative 
weights for a base MS–LTC–DRG 
pertains to the situation where there are 
three severity levels and one or more of 
the severity levels within a base MS– 
LTC–DRG has less than 25 LTCH cases 
(that is, low-volume). In this proposed 
rule, if nonmonotonicity occurs in the 
case where either the highest or lowest 
severity level (‘‘with MCC’’ or ‘‘without 
CC/MCC’’) has 25 LTCH cases or more 
and the other two severity levels are 
low-volume (and therefore the other two 
severity levels would otherwise be 
assigned the proposed relative weight of 
the applicable proposed low-volume 
quintile(s)), we would combine the data 
for the cases in the two adjacent 
proposed low-volume MS–LTC–DRGs 
for the purpose of determining a 
proposed relative weight. If the 
combination results in at least 25 cases,

we re-determine one proposed relative 
weight based on the case-weighted 
average charge of the combined severity 
levels and assign this same proposed 
relative weight to each of the severity 
levels. If the combination results in less 
than 25 cases, based on the case- 
weighted average charge of the 
combined proposed low-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs, both proposed MS–LTC– 
DRGs would be assigned to the 
appropriate proposed low-volume 
quintile (discussed above in section 
II.I.3.e. of this preamble) based on the 
case-weighted average charge of the 
combined proposed low-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs. Then the proposed relative 
weight of the affected proposed low- 
volume quintile would be redetermined 
and that proposed relative weight would 
be assigned to each of the affected 
severity levels (and all of the proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs in the affected proposed 
low-volume quintile). If 
nonmonotonicity persists, we would 
combine all three severity levels and 
redetermine one proposed relative 
weight based on the case-weighted 
average charge of the combined severity 
levels and this same proposed relative 
weight would be assigned to each of the 
three levels. 
Similarly, in nonmonotonic cases 
where the middle level has 25 cases or 
more but either or both of the lowest or 
highest severity level has less than 25 
cases (that is, low volume), we would 
combine the nonmonotonic proposed 
low-volume MS–LTC–DRG with the 
middle level proposed MS–LTC–DRG of 
the base MS–LTC–DRG. We would 
redetermine one proposed relative 
weight based on the case-weighted 
average charge of the combined severity 
levels and assign this same proposed 
relative weight to each of the affected 
proposed MS–LTC–DRGs. If 
nonmonotonicity persists, we would 
combine all three levels for the purpose 
of redetermining a proposed relative 
weight based on the case-weighted 
average charge of the combined severity 
levels, and assign that proposed relative 
weight to each of the three severity 
levels. 
In the case where all three severity 
levels in the base MS–LTC–DRGs are 
proposed low-volume MS–LTC–DRGs 
and two of the severity levels are 
nonmonotonic in relation to each other, 
we would combine the two adjacent 
nonmonotonic severity levels. If that 
combination results in less than 25 
cases, both proposed low-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs would be assigned to the 
appropriate proposed low-volume 
quintile (discussed above in section 
II.I.3.e. of this preamble) based on the 
case-weighted average charge of the 
combined proposed low-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs. Then the proposed relative 
weight of the affected proposed low- 
volume quintile would be redetermined 
and that proposed relative weight would 
be assigned to each of the affected 
severity levels (and all of the proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs in the affected proposed 
low-volume quintile). If the 
nonmonotonicity persists, we would 
combine all three levels of that base 
MS–LTC–DRG for the purpose of 
redetermining a proposed relative 
weight based on the case-weighted 
average charge of the combined severity 
levels, and assign that proposed relative 
weight to each of the three severity 
levels. If that combination of all three 
severity levels results in less than 25 
cases, we would assign that ‘‘combined’’ 
base MS–LTC–DRG to the appropriate 
proposed low-volume quintile based on 
the case-weighted average charge of the 
combined proposed low-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs. Then the proposed relative 
weight of the affected proposed low- 
volume quintile would be redetermined 
and that proposed relative weight would 
be assigned to each of the affected 
severity levels (and all of the proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs in the affected proposed 
low-volume quintile). 
Another example of nonmonotonicity 
involves a base MS–LTC–DRG with 
three severity levels where at least one 
of the severity levels has no cases. As 
discussed above in greater detail in Step 
5, based on resource use intensity and 
clinical similarity, we propose to cross- 
walk a proposed no-volume MS–LTC– 
DRG to a proposed MS–LTC–DRG that 
has at least one case. Under our 
proposed methodology for the treatment 
of proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRGs, 
the proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRG 
would be assigned the same proposed 
relative weight as the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRG to which the proposed no- 
volume MS–LTC–DRG is cross-walked. 
For many proposed no-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs, as shown in the chart above 
in Step 5, the application of our 
proposed methodology results in a 
proposed cross-walk MS–LTC–DRG that 
is the adjacent severity level in the same 
base MS–LTC–DRG. Consequently, in 
most instances, the proposed no-volume 
MS–LTC–DRG and the adjacent 
proposed MS–LTC–DRG to which it is 
cross-walked would not result in 
nonmonotonicity because both of these 
severity levels would have the same 
proposed relative weight. (In this 
proposed rule, under our proposed 
methodology for the treatment of 
proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRGs, in 
the case where the proposed no-volume 
MS–LTC–DRG is either the highest or 
lowest severity level, the proposed 
cross-walk MS–LTC–DRG would be the 
middle level (‘‘with CC’’) within the 
same base MS–LTC–DRG, and therefore 
the proposed no-volume MS–LTC–DRG 
(either the ‘‘with MCC’’ or the ‘‘without 
CC/MCC’’) and the proposed cross-walk 
MS–LTC–DRG (the ‘‘with CC’’) would 
have the same proposed relative weight. 
Consequently, no adjustment for 
monotonicity would be necessary.) 
However, if our proposed methodology 
for determining proposed relative 
weights for proposed no-volume MS– 
LTC–DRGs results in nonmonotonicity 
with the third severity level in the base- 
MS–LTC–DRG, all three severity levels 
would be combined for the purpose of 
redetermining one proposed relative 
weight based on the case-weighted 
average charge of the combined severity 
levels. This same proposed relative 
weight would be assigned to each of the 
three severity levels in the base MS– 
LTC–DRG. 
Thus far in the discussion, we have 
presented examples of nonmonotonicity 
in a base MS–LTC–DRG that has three 
severity levels. We would apply the 
same process where the base MS–LTC– 
DRG contains only two severity levels. 
For example, if nonmonotonicity occurs 
in a base MS–LTC–DRG with two 
severity levels (that is, the proposed 
relative weight of the higher severity 
level is less than the lower severity 
level), where both of the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs have at least 25 cases or 
where one or both of the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs is low volume (that is, less 
than 25 cases), we would combine the 
two proposed MS–LTC–DRGs of that 
base MS–LTC–DRG for the purpose of 
redetermining a proposed relative 
weight based on the combined case- 
weighted average charge for both 
severity levels. This same proposed 
relative weight would be assigned to 
each of the two severity levels in the 
base MS–LTC–DRG. Specifically, if the 
combination of the two severity levels 
would result in at least 25 cases, we 
would redetermine one proposed 
relative weight based on the case- 
weighted average charge and assign that 
proposed relative weight to each of the 
two proposed MS–LTC–DRGs. If the 
combination results in less than 25 
cases, we would assign both proposed 
MS–LTC–DRGs to the appropriate 
proposed low-volume quintile 
(discussed above in section II.I.3.e. of 
this preamble) based on their combined 
case-weighted average charge. Then the 
proposed relative weight of the affected 
proposed low-volume quintile would be 
redetermined and that proposed relative

weight would be assigned to each of the 
affected severity levels. 
Step 7—Calculate the proposed FY 
2009 budget neutrality factor. 
As we established in the RY 2008 
LTCH PPS final rule (72 FR 26882), 
under the broad authority conferred 
upon the Secretary under section 123 of 
Pub. L. 106–113 as amended by section 
307(b) of Pub. L. 106–554 to develop the 
LTCH PPS, beginning with the MS– 
LTC–DRG update for FY 2008, the 
annual update to the MS–LTC–DRG 
classifications and relative weights will 
be done in a budget neutral manner 
such that estimated aggregate LTCH PPS 
payments would be unaffected, that is, 
would be neither greater than nor less 
than the estimated aggregate LTCH PPS 
payments that would have been made 
without the MS–LTC–DRG classification 
and relative weight changes. 
Specifically, in that same final rule, we 
established under § 412.517(b) that the 
annual update to the MS–LTC–DRG 
classifications and relative weights be 
done in a budget neutral manner. For a 
detailed discussion on the 
establishment of the requirement to 
update the MS–LTC–DRG classifications 
and relative weights in a budget neutral 
manner, we refer readers to the RY 2008 
LTCH PPS final rule (72 FR 26880 
through 26884). Updating the MS–LTC– 
DRGs in a budget neutral manner results 
in an annual update to the individual 
MS–LTC–DRG classifications and 
relative weights based on the most 
recent available data to reflect changes 
in relative LTCH resource use. To 
accomplish this, the MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights are uniformly adjusted 
to ensure that estimated aggregate 
payments under the LTCH PPS would 
not be affected (that is, decreased or 
increased). Consistent with that 
provision, we are proposing to update 
the MS–LTC–DRG classifications and 
relative weights for FY 2009 based on 
the most recent available data and 
include a proposed budget neutrality 
adjustment that would be applied in 
determining the proposed MS–LTC– 
DRG relative weights. 
To ensure budget neutrality in 
updating the proposed MS–LTC–DRG 
classifications and proposed relative 
weights under § 412.517(b), consistent 
with the budget neutrality methodology 
we established in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 47295 
through 47296), in determining the 
proposed budget neutrality adjustment 
for FY 2009 in this proposed rule, we 
are proposing to use a method that is 
similar to the methodology used under 
the IPPS. Specifically, for FY 2009, after 
recalibrating the proposed MS–LTC– 
DRG relative weights as we do under the 
methodology as described in detail in 
Steps 1 through 6 above, we would 
calculate and apply a normalization 
factor to those relative weights to ensure 
that estimated payments are not 
influenced by changes in the 
composition of case types or the 
changes being proposed to the 
classification system. That is, the 
proposed normalization adjustment is 
intended to ensure that the recalibration 
of the proposed MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights (that is, the process itself) 
neither increases nor decreases total 
estimated payments. 
To calculate the proposed 
normalization factor for FY 2009, we 
would use the following steps: (1) We 
use the most recent available claims 
data (FY 2007) and the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights (determined 
above in Steps 1 through 6 above) to 
calculate the average CMI; (2) we group 
the same claims data (FY 2007) using 
the FY 2008 GROUPER (Version 25.0) 
and FY 2008 relative weights 
(established in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 47295 
through 47296)) and calculate the 
average CMI; and (3), we compute the 
ratio of these average CMIs by dividing 
the average CMI determined in step (2) 
by the average CMI determined in step 
(1). In determining the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRG relative weights for FY 2009, 
based on the latest available LTCH 
claims data, the normalization factor is 
estimated as 1.038266, which would be 
applied in determining each proposed 
MS–LTC–DRG relative weight. That is, 
each proposed MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weight would be multiplied by 1.038266 
in the first step of the budget neutrality 
process. Accordingly, the proposed 
relative weights in Table 11 in the 
Addendum of this proposed rule reflect 
this proposed normalization factor. We 
also ensure that estimated aggregate 
LTCH PPS payments (based on the most 
recent available LTCH claims data) after 
reclassification and recalibration (the 
new proposed FY 2009 MS–LTC–DRG 
classifications and relative weights) are 
equal to estimated aggregate LTCH PPS 
payments (for the same most recent 
available LTCH claims data) before 
reclassification and recalibration (the 
existing FY 2008 MS–DRG 
classifications and relative weights). 
Therefore, we would calculate the 
proposed budget neutrality adjustment 
factor by simulating estimated total 
payments under both sets of GROUPERs 
and relative weights using current LTCH 
PPS payment policies (RY 2008) and the 
most recent available claims data (from 
the FY 2007 MedPAR file). 
Accordingly, we are proposing to use 
RY 2008 LTCH PPS rates and policies in 
determining the proposed FY 2009 
budget neutrality adjustment in this 
proposed rule, using the following 
steps: (1) We simulate estimated total 
payments using the normalized 
proposed relative weights under 
GROUPER Version 26.0 (as described 
above); (2) we simulate estimated total 
payments using the FY 2008 GROUPER 
(Version 25.0) and FY 2008 MS–LTC– 
DRG relative weights (as established in 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule (72 FR 
47295 through 47296)); (3) we calculate 
the ratio of these estimated total 
payments by dividing the estimated 
total payments determined in step (2) by 
the estimated total payments 
determined in step (1). Then, each of the 
normalized proposed relative weights is 
multiplied by the proposed budget 
neutrality factor to determine the budget 
neutral proposed relative weight for 
each proposed MS–LTC–DRG. 
Accordingly, in determining the 
proposed MS–LTC–DRG relative 
weights for FY 2009 in this proposed 
rule, based on the most recent available 
LTCH claims data, we are proposing a 
budget neutrality factor of 0.99965, 
which would be applied to the 
normalized proposed relative weights 
(described above). The proposed FY 
2009 MS–LTC–DRG relative weights in 
Table 11 in the Addendum of this 
proposed rule reflect this proposed 
budget neutrality factor. Furthermore, 
we expect that we will have established 
payments rates and policies for RY 2009 
prior to the development of the FY 2009 
IPPS final rule. Therefore, for purposes 
of determining the FY 2009 budget 
neutrality factor in the final rule, we are 
proposing that we would simulate 
estimated total payments using the most 
recent LTCH PPS payment policies and 
LTCH claims data that are available at 
that time. 
Table 11 in the Addendum to this 
proposed rule lists the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs and their respective 
proposed budget neutral relative 
weights, geometric mean length of stay, 
and five-sixths of the geometric mean 
length of stay (used in the determination 
of short-stay outlier payments under 
§ 412.529) for FY 2009. 
J. Proposed Add-On Payments for New 
Services and Technologies 
1. Background 
Sections 1886(d)(5)(K) and (L) of the 
Act establish a process of identifying 
and ensuring adequate payment for new 
medical services and technologies 
(sometimes collectively referred to in 
this section as ‘‘new technologies’’) 
under the IPPS. Section 
1886(d)(5)(K)(vi) of the Act specifies

23609 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
that a medical service or technology will 
be considered new if it meets criteria 
established by the Secretary after notice 
and opportunity for public comment. 
Section 1886(d)(5)(K)(ii)(I) of the Act 
specifies that the process must apply to 
a new medical service or technology if, 
‘‘based on the estimated costs incurred 
with respect to discharges involving 
such service or technology, the DRG 
prospective payment rate otherwise 
applicable to such discharges under this 
subsection is inadequate.’’ 
The regulations implementing this 
provision establish three criteria for new 
medical services and technologies to 
receive an additional payment. First, 
42CFR412.87(b)(2) states that a specific 
medical service or technology will be 
considered new for purposes of new 
medical service or technology add-on 
payments until such time as Medicare 
data are available to fully reflect the cost 
of the technology in the DRG weights 
through recalibration. Typically, there is 
a lag of 2 to 3 years from the point a new 
medical service or technology is first 
introduced on the market (generally on 
the date that the technology receives 
FDA approval/clearance) and when data 
reflecting the use of the medical service 
or technology are used to calculate the 
DRG weights. For example, data from 
discharges occurring during FY 2007 are 
used to calculate the FY 2009 DRG 
weights in this proposed rule. Section 
412.87(b)(2) of our existing regulations 
provides that ‘‘a medical service or 
technology may be considered new 
within 2 or 3 years after the point at 
which data begin to become available 
reflecting the ICD–9–CM code assigned 
to the new medical service or 
technology (depending on when a new 
code is assigned and data on the new 
medical service or technology become 
available for DRG recalibration). After 
CMS has recalibrated the DRGs based on 
available data to reflect the costs of an 
otherwise new medical service or 
technology, the medical service or 
technology will no longer be considered 
‘‘new’’ under the criterion for this 
section.’’ 
The 2-year to 3-year period during 
which a medical service or technology 
can be considered new would ordinarily 
begin on the date on which the medical 
service or technology received FDA 
approval or clearance. (We note that, for 
purposes of this section of the proposed 
rule, we refer to both FDA approval and 
FDA clearance as FDA ‘‘approval.’’) 
However, in some cases, initially there 
may be no Medicare data available for 
the new service or technology following 
FDA approval. For example, the 
newness period could extend beyond 
the 2-year to 3-year period after FDA 
approval is received in cases where the 
product initially was generally 
unavailable to Medicare patients 
following FDA approval, such as in the 
case of a national noncoverage 
determination, or if there was some 
documented delay in bringing the 
product onto the market after that 
approval (for instance, component 
production or drug production has been 
postponed following FDA approval due 
to shelf life concerns or manufacturing 
issues). After the DRGs have been 
recalibrated to reflect the costs of an 
otherwise new medical service or 
technology, the medical service or 
technology is no longer eligible for 
special add-on payment for new 
medical services or technologies 
(§ 412.87(b)(2)). For example, an 
approved new technology that received 
FDA approval in October 2007 and 
entered the market at that time may be 
eligible to receive add-on payments as a 
new technology for discharges occurring 
before October 1, 2010 (the start of FY 
2011). Because the FY 2011 DRG 
weights would be calculated using FY 
2009 MedPAR data, the costs of such a 
new technology would be fully reflected 
in the FY 2011 DRG weights. Therefore, 
the new technology would no longer be 
eligible to receive add-on payments as a 
new technology for discharges occurring 
in FY 2011 and thereafter. 
Section 412.87(b)(3) further provides 
that, to be eligible for the add-on 
payment for new medical services or 
technologies, the DRG prospective 
payment rate otherwise applicable to 
the discharge involving the new medical 
services or technologies must be 
assessed for adequacy. Under the cost 
criterion, to assess whether a new 
technology would be inadequately paid 
under the applicable DRG-prospective 
payment rate, we evaluate whether the 
charges for cases involving the new 
technology exceed certain threshold 
amounts. In the FY 2004 IPPS final rule 
(68 FR 45385), we established the 
threshold at the geometric mean 
standardized charge for all cases in the 
DRG plus 75 percent of 1 standard 
deviation above the geometric mean 
standardized charge (based on the 
logarithmic values of the charges and 
converted back to charges) for all cases 
in the DRG to which the new medical 
service or technology is assigned (or the 
case-weighted average of all relevant 
DRGs, if the new medical service or 
technology occurs in more than one 
DRG). 
However, section 503(b)(1) of Pub. L. 
108–173 amended section 
1886(d)(5)(K)(ii)(I) of the Act to provide 
that, beginning in FY 2005, CMS will 
apply ‘‘a threshold * * * that is the 
lesser of 75 percent of the standardized 
amount (increased to reflect the 
difference between cost and charges) or 
75 percent of one standard deviation for 
the diagnosis-related group involved.’’ 
(We refer readers to section IV.D. of the 
preamble to the FY 2005 IPPS final rule 
(69 FR 49084) for a discussion of the 
revision of the regulations to 
incorporate the change made by section 
503(b)(1) of Pub. L. 108–173.) Table 10 
in section XIX. of the interim final rule 
with comment period published in the 
Federal Register on November 27, 2007, 
contained the final thresholds that are 
being used to evaluate applications for 
new technology add-on payments for FY 
2009 (72 FR 66888 through 66892). An 
applicant must demonstrate that the 
cost threshold is met using information 
from inpatient hospital claims. 
With regard to the issue of whether 
the HIPAA Privacy Rule at 45 CFR Parts 
160 and 164 applies to claims 
information that providers submit with 
applications for new technology add-on 
payments, we addressed this issue in 
the September 7, 2001 final rule that 
established the new technology add-on 
payment regulations (66 FR 46917). In 
the preamble to that final rule, we 
explained that health plans, including 
Medicare, and providers that conduct 
certain transactions electronically, 
including the hospitals that would be 
receiving payment under the FY 2001 
IPPS final rule, are required to comply 
with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We 
further explained how such entities 
could meet the applicable HIPAA 
requirements by discussing how the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule permitted 
providers to share with health plans 
information needed to ensure correct 
payment, if they had obtained consent 
from the patient to use that patient’s 
data for treatment, payment, or health 
care operations. We also explained that 
because the information to be provided 
within applications for new technology 
add-on payment would be needed to 
ensure correct payment, no additional 
consent would be required. The HHS 
Office of Civil Rights has since amended 
the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but the results 
remain. The HIPAA Privacy Rule no 
longer requires covered entities to 
obtain consent from patients to use or 
disclose protected health information 
for treatment, payment, or health care 
operations, and expressly permits such 
entities to use or to disclose protected 
health information for any of these 
purposes. (We refer readers to 45 CFR 
164.502(a)(1)(ii), and 164.506(c)(1) and 
(c)(3), and the Standards for Privacy of 
Individually Identifiable Health

23610 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Register on August 14, 2002, for a full 
discussion of changes in consent 
requirements.) 
Section 412.87(b)(1) of our existing 
regulations provides that a new 
technology is an appropriate candidate 
for an additional payment when it 
represents ‘‘an advance that 
substantially improves, relative to 
technologies previously available, the 
diagnosis or treatment of Medicare 
beneficiaries.’’ For example, a new 
technology represents a substantial 
clinical improvement when it reduces 
mortality, decreases the number of 
hospitalizations or physician visits, or 
reduces recovery time compared to the 
technologies previously available. (We 
refer readers to the September 7, 2001 
final rule for a complete discussion of 
this criterion (66 FR 46902).) 
The new medical service or 
technology add-on payment policy 
under the IPPS provides additional 
payments for cases with relatively high 
costs involving eligible new medical 
services or technologies while 
preserving some of the incentives 
inherent under an average-based 
prospective payment system. The 
payment mechanism is based on the 
cost to hospitals for the new medical 
service or technology. Under § 412.88, if 
the costs of the discharge (determined 
by applying CCRs as described in 
§ 412.84(h)) exceed the full DRG 
payment, Medicare will make an add-on 
payment equal to the lesser of: (1) 50 
percent of the estimated costs of the 
new technology (if the estimated costs 
for the case including the new 
technology exceed Medicare’s payment) 
or (2) 50 percent of the difference 
between the full DRG payment and the 
hospital’s estimated cost for the case. If 
the amount by which the actual costs of 
a new medical service or technology 
case exceeds the full DRG payment 
(including payments for IME and DSH, 
but excluding outlier payments) by 
more than the 50-percent marginal cost 
factor, Medicare payment is limited to 
the full DRG payment plus 50 percent 
of the estimated costs of the new 
technology. 
Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act 
requires that the adjustments to annual 
DRG classifications and relative weights 
must be made in a manner that ensures 
that aggregate payments to hospitals are 
not affected. Therefore, in the past, we 
accounted for projected payments under 
the new medical service and technology 
provision during the upcoming fiscal 
year at the same time we estimated the 
payment effect of changes to the DRG 
classifications and recalibration. The 
impact of additional payments under 
this provision was then included in the 
budget neutrality factor, which was 
applied to the standardized amounts 
and the hospital-specific amounts. 
However, section 503(d)(2) of Pub. L. 
108–173 provides that there shall be no 
reduction or adjustment in aggregate 
payments under the IPPS due to add-on 
payments for new medical services and 
technologies. Therefore, add-on 
payments for new medical services or 
technologies for FY 2005 and later years 
have not been budget neutral. 
Applicants for add-on payments for 
new medical services or technologies for 
FY 2010 must submit a formal request, 
including a full description of the 
clinical applications of the medical 
service or technology and the results of 
any clinical evaluations demonstrating 
that the new medical service or 
technology represents a substantial 
clinical improvement, along with a 
significant sample of data to 
demonstrate the medical service or 
technology meets the high-cost 
threshold. Complete application 
information, along with final deadlines 
for submitting a full application, will be 
available on our Web site at: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/AcuteInpatientPPS/ 
08_newtech.asp#TopOfPage. To allow 
interested parties to identify the new 
medical services or technologies under 
review before the publication of the 
proposed rule for FY 2010, the Web site 
will also list the tracking forms 
completed by each applicant. 
The Council on Technology and 
Innovation (CTI) at CMS oversees the 
agency’s cross-cutting priority on 
coordinating coverage, coding and 
payment processes for Medicare with 
respect to new technologies and 
procedures, including new drug 
therapies, as well as promoting the 
exchange of information on new 
technologies between CMS and other 
entities. The CTI, composed of senior 
CMS staff and clinicians, was 
established under section 942(a) of Pub. 
L. 108–173. It is co-chaired by the 
Director of the Center for Medicare 
Management (CMM), who is also 
designated as the CTI’s Executive 
Coordinator, and the Director of the 
Office of Clinical Standards and Quality 
(OCSQ). 
The specific processes for coverage, 
coding, and payment are implemented 
by CMM, OCSQ, and the local claims- 
payment contractors (in the case of local 
coverage and payment decisions). The 
CTI supplements rather than replaces 
these processes by working to assure 
that all of these activities reflect the 
agency-wide priority to promote high- 
quality, innovative care, and at the same 
time to streamline, accelerate, and 
improve coordination of these processes 
to ensure that they remain up to date as 
new issues arise. To achieve its goals, 
the CTI works to streamline and create 
a more transparent coding and payment 
process, improve the quality of medical 
decisions, and speed patient access to 
effective new treatments. It is also 
dedicated to supporting better decisions 
by patients and doctors in using 
Medicare-covered services through the 
promotion of better evidence 
development, which is critical for 
improving the quality of care for 
Medicare beneficiaries. 
The agency plans to continue its Open 
Door forums with stakeholders who are 
interested in CTI’s initiatives. In 
addition, to improve understanding of 
CMS processes for coverage, coding, and 
payment and how to access them, the 
CTI is developing an ‘‘innovator’s 
guide’’ to these processes. This guide 
will, for example, outline regulation 
cycles and application deadlines. The 
intent is to consolidate this information, 
much of which is already available in a 
variety of CMS documents and in 
various places on CMS’s Web site, in a 
user-friendly format. In the meantime, 
we invite any product developers with 
specific issues involving the agency to 
contact us early in the process of 
product development if they have 
questions or concerns about the 
evidence that would be needed later in 
the development process for the 
agency’s coverage decisions for 
Medicare. 
The CTI aims to provide information 
on CTI activities to stakeholders, 
including Medicare beneficiaries, 
advocates, medical product 
manufacturers, providers, and health 
policy experts, and other stakeholders 
with useful information on CTI 
initiatives. Stakeholders with further 
questions about Medicare’s coverage, 
coding, and payment processes, or who 
want further guidance about how they 
can navigate these processes, can 
contact the CTI at CTI@cms.hhs.gov or 
from the ‘‘Contact Us’’ section of the CTI 
home page (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/
CouncilonTechInnov/). 
2. Public Input Before Publication of a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Add- 
On Payments 
Section 1886(d)(5)(K)(viii) of the Act, 
as amended by section 503(b)(2) of Pub. 
L. 108–173, provides for a mechanism 
for public input before publication of a 
notice of proposed rulemaking regarding 
whether a medical service or technology 
represents a substantial clinical 
improvement or advancement. The 
process for evaluating new medical 
service and technology applications 
requires the Secretary to—

23611 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
• Provide, before publication of a 
proposed rule, for public input 
regarding whether a new service or 
technology represents an advance in 
medical technology that substantially 
improves the diagnosis or treatment of 
Medicare beneficiaries; 
• Make public and periodically 
update a list of the services and 
technologies for which applications for 
add-on payments are pending; 
• Accept comments, 
recommendations, and data from the 
public regarding whether a service or 
technology represents a substantial 
clinical improvement; and 
• Provide, before publication of a 
proposed rule, for a meeting at which 
organizations representing hospitals, 
physicians, manufacturers, and any 
other interested party may present 
comments, recommendations, and data 
regarding whether a new medical 
service or technology represents a 
substantial clinical improvement to the 
clinical staff of CMS. 
In order to provide an opportunity for 
public input regarding add-on payments 
for new medical services and 
technologies for FY 2009 before 
publication of the FY 2009 IPPS 
proposed rule, we published a notice in 
the Federal Register on December 28, 
2007 (72 FR 73845 through 73847), and 
held a town hall meeting at the CMS 
Headquarters Office in Baltimore, MD, 
on February 21, 2008. In the 
announcement notice for the meeting, 
we stated that the opinions and 
alternatives provided during the 
meeting would assist us in our 
evaluations of applications by allowing 
public discussion of the substantial 
clinical improvement criterion for each 
of the FY 2009 new medical service and 
technology add-on payment 
applications before the publication of 
the FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule. 
Approximately 70 individuals 
attended the town hall meeting in 
person, while approximately 20 
additional participants listened over an 
open telephone line. Each of the four FY 
2009 applicants presented information 
on its technology, including a focused 
discussion of data reflecting the 
substantial clinical improvement aspect 
of the technology. We received two 
comments during the town hall meeting, 
which are summarized below. We 
considered each applicant’s 
presentation made at the town hall 
meeting, as well as written comments 
submitted on each applicant’s 
application, in our evaluation of the 
new technology add-on applications for 
FY 2009 in this proposed rule. We have 
summarized these comments below or, 
if applicable, indicated that no 
comments were received at the end of 
the discussion of each application. 
Comment: One commenter addressed 
the substantial clinical improvement 
criterion. A medical device association 
stated that CMS’ interpretation of the 
statutory criteria for new technology 
add-on payments is narrow and makes 
it difficult for potential applicants, 
especially small manufacturing 
companies, to qualify for new 
technology add-on payments. The 
commenter urged CMS to ‘‘deem a 
device to satisfy the substantial clinical 
improvement criteria if it was granted a 
humanitarian device exemption or 
priority review based on the fact that it 
represents breakthrough technologies, 
which offer significant advantages over 
existing approved alternatives, for 
which no alternatives exist, or the 
availability of which is in the best 
interests of the patients.’’ In addition, 
the commenter remarked that this 
process would simplify CMS’ evaluation 
of applications for new technology add- 
on payments and would promote access 
to innovative treatments, as intended by 
Congress. Although the commenter also 
made remarks that were unrelated to 
substantial clinical improvement, 
because the purpose of the town hall 
meeting was specifically to discuss 
substantial clinical improvement of 
pending new technology applications, 
those comments are not summarized in 
this proposed rule. 
Response: With respect to the 
comment that CMS has a narrow 
interpretation of the statute that makes 
it difficult for applicants to meet the 
statutory criteria for a new technology 
add-on payment, we note that we have 
already specifically addressed the issue 
in the past (71 FR 47997 and 72 FR 
47301). In addition, we addressed the 
comment concerning automatically 
deeming technologies granted a 
humanitarian device exemption (HDE) 
at 72 FR 47302. Further, because the 
purpose of the new technology town 
hall meeting was to discuss substantial 
clinical improvement of pending 
applications, we are not providing a 
response to the unrelated comments in 
this proposed rule. 
Comment: One commenter, a medical 
technology association, submitted 
comments in reference to the MS–DRGs 
and the need to account for complexity 
as well as severity in making 
refinements to the DRG classification 
system. The commenter also made the 
following comments: CMS should raise 
the new technology marginal cost factor, 
adjust the newness policy to begin with 
the issuance of an ICD–9–CM code 
instead of the FDA approval date, 
provide access to the quarterly MedPAR 
updates, and allow for the use of 
external data for determining new 
technology payments (when CMS 
determines that the external data are 
unbiased and valid). 
Response: Section 1886(d)(5)(K)(viii) 
of the Act requires that CMS accept 
comments, recommendations, and data 
from the public regarding whether a 
service or technology represents a 
substantial clinical improvement. 
Because the comments above are not 
related to the substantial clinical 
improvement criterion of pending 
applications, we are not providing a 
response to them in this proposed rule. 
3. FY 2009 Status of Technologies 
Approved for FY 2008 Add-On 
Payments 
We did not approve any applications 
for new technology add-on payments for 
FY 2008. For additional information, 
refer to the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47305 through 
47307). 
4. FY 2009 Applications for New 
Technology Add-On Payments 
We received four applications to be 
considered for new technology add-on 
payment for FY 2009. A discussion of 
each of these applications is presented 
below. We note that, in the past, we 
have considered applications that had 
not yet received FDA approval, but were 
anticipating FDA approval prior to 
publication of the IPPS final rule. In 
such cases, we generally provide a more 
limited discussion of those technologies 
in the proposed rule because it is not 
known if these technologies will meet 
the newness criterion in time for us to 
conduct a complete analysis in the final 
rule. This year, three out of four 
applicants do not yet have FDA 
approval. Consequently, we have 
presented a limited analysis of them in 
this proposed rule. 
a. CardioWestTM Temporary Total 
Artificial Heart System (CardioWestTM 
TAH–t) 
SynCardia Systems, Inc. submitted an 
application for approval of the 
CardioWestTM temporary Total Artificial 
Heart system (TAH–t) for new 
technology add-on payments for FY 
2009. The TAH–t is a technology that is 
used as a bridge to heart transplant 
device for heart transplant-eligible 
patients with end-stage biventricular 
failure. The TAH–t pumps up to 9.5 
liters of blood per minute. This high 
level of perfusion helps improve 
hemodynamic function in patients, thus 
making them better heart transplant 
candidates.

23612 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
The TAH–t was approved by the FDA 
on October 15, 2004, for use as a bridge 
to transplant device in cardiac 
transplant-eligible candidates at risk of 
imminent death from biventricular 
failure. The TAH–t is intended to be 
used in hospital inpatients. Some of the 
FDA’s post-approval requirements 
include that the manufacturer agree to 
provide a post-approval study 
demonstrating that the success of the 
device at one center can be reproduced 
at other centers. The study was to 
include at least 50 patients who will be 
followed up to 1 year, including (but not 
limited to) the following endpoints; 
survival to transplant, adverse events, 
and device malfunction. 
Presently, Medicare does not cover 
artificial heart devices, including the 
TAH–t. However, on February 01, 2008, 
CMS proposed to reverse a national 
noncoverage determination that would 
extend coverage to this technology 
within the confines of an FDA-approved 
clinical study. (To view the proposed 
National Coverage Determination (NCD), 
we refer readers to the CMS Web site at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/viewdraft
decisionmemo.asp?from2=
viewdraftdecisionmemo.asp&id=211&.) 
Should this proposal be finalized, it 
would become effective on May 01, 
2008. Because Medicare’s existing 
coverage policy with respect to this 
device has precluded it from being paid 
for by Medicare, we would not expect 
the costs associated with this 
technology to be currently reflected in 
the data used to determine MS–DRGs 
relative weights. As we have indicated 
in the past, although we generally 
believe that the newness period would 
begin on the date that FDA approval 
was granted, in cases where the 
applicant can demonstrate a 
documented delay in market availability 
subsequent to FDA approval, we would 
consider delaying the start of the 
newness period. This technology’s 
situation represents one such case. We 
also note that section 
1886(d)(5)(K)(ii)(II) of the Act requires 
that we provide for the collection of cost 
data for a new medical service or 
technology for a period of at least 2 
years and no more than 3 years 
‘‘beginning on the date on which an 
inpatient hospital code is issued with 
respect to the service or technology.’’ 
Furthermore, the statute specifies that 
the term ‘‘inpatient hospital code’’ 
means any code that is used with 
respect to inpatient hospital services for 
which payment may be made under the 
IPPS and includes ICD–9–CM codes and 
any subsequent revisions. Although the 
TAH–t has been described by the ICD– 
9–CM code(s) (described below in the 
cost threshold discussion) since the 
time of its FDA approval, because the 
TAH–t has not been covered under the 
Medicare program (and, therefore, no 
Medicare payment has been made for 
this technology), this code is not ‘‘used 
with respect to inpatient hospital 
services for which payment’’ is made 
under the IPPS, and thus we assume 
that none of the costs associated with 
this technology would be reflected in 
the Medicare claims data used to 
recalibrate the MS–DRG weights. For 
this reason, despite its FDA approval 
date, it appears that this technology 
would still be eligible to be considered 
‘‘new’’ for purposes of the new 
technology add-on payment if and when 
the proposal to reverse the national 
noncoverage determination concerning 
this technology is finalized. Therefore, 
based on this information, it appears 
that the TAH–t would meet the newness 
criterion on the date that Medicare 
coverage begins, should the proposed 
NCD be finalized. 
In an effort to demonstrate that TAH– 
t would meet the cost criterion, the 
applicant submitted data based on 28 
actual cases of the TAH–t. The data 
included 6 cases (or 21.4 percent of 
cases) from 2005, 13 cases (or 46.5 
percent of cases) from 2006, 7 cases (or 
25 percent of cases) from 2007, and 2 
cases (or 7.1 percent of cases) from 
2008. Currently, cases involving the 
TAH–t are assigned to MS–DRG 215 
(Other Heart Assist System Implant). As 
discussed below in this section, we are 
proposing to remove the TAH–t from 
MS–DRG 215 and reassign the TAH–t to 
MS–DRGs 001 (Heart Transplant or 
Implant of Heart Assist System with 
MCC) and 002 (Heart Transplant or 
Implant of Heart Assist System without 
MCC). Therefore, to determine if the 
technology meets the cost criterion, it is 
appropriate to compare the average 
standardized charge per case to the 
thresholds for MS–DRGs 001, 002, and 
215 included in Table 10 of the 
November 27, 2007 interim final rule 
(72 FR 66888 through 66889). The 
thresholds for MS–DRGs 001, 002, and 
215 from Table 10 are $345,031, 
$178,142, and $151,824, respectively. 
Based on the 28 cases the applicant 
submitted, the average standardized 
charge per case was $731,632. Because 
the average standardized charge per case 
is much greater than the thresholds 
cited above for MS–DRG 215 (and MS– 
DRGs 001 and 002, should the proposal 
to reassign the TAH–t be finalized), the 
applicant asserted that the TAH–t meets 
the cost criterion whether or not the 
costs were analyzed by using either a 
case-weighted threshold or case- 
weighted standardized charge per case. 
In addition to analyzing the costs of 
actual cases involving the TAH–t, the 
applicant searched the FY 2006 
MedPAR file to identify cases involving 
patients who would have potentially 
been eligible to receive the TAH–t. The 
applicant submitted three different 
MedPAR analyses. The first MedPAR 
analysis involved a search for cases 
using ICD–9–CM diagnosis code 428.0 
(Congestive heart failure) in 
combination with ICD–9–CM procedure 
code 37.66 (Insertion of implantable 
heart assist system), and an inpatient 
hospital length of stay greater than or 
equal to 60 days. The applicant found 
two cases that met this criterion, which 
had an average standardized charge per 
case of $821,522. The second MedPAR 
analysis searched for cases with ICD–9– 
CM diagnosis code 428.0 (Congestive 
heart failure) and one or more of the 
following ICD–9–CM procedure codes: 
37.51 (Heart transplant), 37.52 
(Implantation of total heart replacement 
system), 37.64 (Removal of heart assist 
system), 37.66 (Insertion of implantable 
heart assist system), or 37.68 (Insertion 
of percutaneous external heart assist 
device), and a length of stay greater than 
or equal to 60 days. The applicant found 
144 cases that met this criterion, which 
had an average standardized charge per 
case of $841,827. The final MedPAR 
analysis searched for cases with ICD–9– 
CM procedure code 37.51 (Heart 
transplant) in combination with one of 
the following ICD–9–CM procedure 
codes: 37.52 (Implantation of total heart 
replacement system), 37.65 
(Implantation of external heart system), 
or 37.66 (Insertion of implantable heart 
assist system). The applicant found 37 
cases that met this criterion, which had 
an average standardized charge per case 
of $896,601. Because only two cases met 
the criterion for the first analysis, 
consistent with historical practice, we 
would not consider it to be of statistical 
significance and, therefore, would not 
rely upon it to demonstrate whether the 
TAH–t would meet the cost threshold. 
However, both of the additional 
analyses seem to provide an adequate 
number of cases to demonstrate whether 
the TAH–t would meet the cost 
threshold. We assume that none of the 
costs associated with this technology 
would be reflected in the MedPAR 
analyses that the applicant used to 
demonstrate that the technology would 
meet the cost criterion. We note that, 
under all three of the analyses the 
applicant performed, it identified cases 
that would have been eligible for the 
TAH–t, but did not remove charges that

were unrelated to the TAH–t, nor did 
the applicant insert a proxy of charges 
related to the TAH–t. However, as stated 
above, the average standardized charge 
per case is much greater than any of the 
thresholds for MS–DRGs 001, 002, and 
215. Therefore, even if the applicant 
were to approximate what the costs of 
cases eligible to receive the TAH–t 
would have been by removing non- 
TAH–t associated charges and inserting 
charges related to the TAH–t, it appears 
that the average standardized charges 
per case for cases eligible for the TAH– 
t would exceed the relevant thresholds 
from Table 10 (as discussed above) and 
would therefore appear to meet the cost 
criterion. We invite public comment on 
whether TAH–t meets the cost criterion. 
As noted in section II.G. of this 
preamble, we are proposing to remove 
the TAH–t from MS–DRG 215 and 
reassign the TAH–t to MS–DRGs 001 
and 002. As stated earlier, CMS is 
proposing to reverse a national 
noncoverage determination that would 
extend coverage to artificial heart 
devices within the confines of an FDA- 
approved clinical study, effective May 
1, 2008. If this proposal is finalized, the 
MCE will require both the procedure 
code 37.52 (Implantation of total 
replacement heart system) and the 
diagnosis code reflecting clinical trial— 
V70.7 (Examination of participant in 
clinical trial). As we have previously 
mentioned, the TAH–t appears to meet 
the cost thresholds for MS–DRGs 001, 
002, and 215. Therefore, its proposed 
reassignment from MS–DRG 215 to MS– 
DRGs 001 and 002 should have no 
material effect on meeting the cost 
thresholds in MS–DRGs 001 and 002 
should the reassignment proposal be 
finalized. 
The manufacturer states that the 
TAH–t is the only mechanical 
circulatory support device intended as a 
bridge-to-transplant for patients with 
irreversible biventricular failure. It also 
asserts that the TAH–t improves clinical 
outcomes because it has been shown to 
reduce mortality in patients who are 
otherwise in end-stage heart failure. In 
addition, the manufacturer claims that 
the TAH–t provides greater 
hemodynamic stability and end-organ 
perfusion, thus making patients who 
receive it better candidates for eventual 
heart transplant. We welcome 
comments from the public regarding 
whether the TAH–t represents a 
substantial clinical improvement. 
We did not receive any written 
comments or public comments at the 
town hall meeting regarding the 
substantial clinical improvement 
aspects of this technology. 
b. Emphasys Medical Zephyr 
Endobronchial Valve (Zephyr EBV) 
Emphasys Medical submitted an 
application for new technology add-on 
payments for FY 2009 for the Emphasys 
Medical Zephyr Endobronchial Valve 
(Zephyr EBV). The Zephyr EBV is 
intended to treat patients with 
emphysema by reducing volume in the 
diseased, hyperinflated portion of the 
emphysematous lung with fewer risks 
and complications than with more 
invasive surgical alternatives. Zephyr 
EBV therapy involves placing small, 
one-way valves in the patients’ airways 
to allow air to flow out of, but not into, 
the diseased portions of the lung thus 
reducing the hyperinflation. A typical 
procedure involves placing three to four 
valves in the target lobe using a 
bronchoscope, and the procedure takes 
approximately 20 to 40 minutes to 
complete. The Zephyr EBVs are 
designed to be relatively easy to place, 
and are intended to be removable so 
that, unlike more risky surgical 
alternatives such as Lung Volume 
Reduction Surgery (LVRS) or Lung 
Transplant, the procedure has the 
potential to be fully reversible. 
Currently, the Zephyr EBV has yet 
to receive approval from the FDA, but 
the manufacturer indicated to CMS that 
it expects to receive its FDA approval in 
the second or third quarter of 2008. 
Because the technology is not yet 
approved by the FDA, we will limit our 
discussion of this technology to data 
that the applicant submitted, rather than 
make specific proposals with respect to 
whether the device would meet the new 
technology add-on criteria. 
In an effort to demonstrate that the 
Zephyr EBV would meet the cost 
criterion, the applicant searched the FY 
2006 MedPAR file for cases with one of 
the following ICD–9–CM diagnosis 
codes: 492.0 (Emphysematous bleb), 
492.8 (Other emphysema, NEC), or 496 
(Chronic airway obstruction, NEC). 
Based on the diagnosis codes searched 
by the applicant, cases of the Zephyr 
EBV would be most prevalent in MS– 
DRGs 190 (Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease with MCC), 191 
(Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
with CC), and 192 (Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease without CC/MCC). 
The applicant found 1,869 cases (or 12.8 
percent of cases) in MS–DRG 190, 5,789 
cases (or 39.5 percent of cases) in MS– 
DRG 191, and 6,995 cases (or 47.7 
percent of cases) in MS–DRG 192 
(which equals a total of 14,653 cases). 
The average standardized charge per 
case was $21,567 for MS–DRG 190, 
$15,494 for MS–DRG 191, and $11,826 
for MS–DRG 192. The average 
standardized charge per case does not 
include charges related to the Zephyr 
EBV; therefore, it is necessary to add the 
charges related to the device to the 
average standardized charge per case in 
evaluating the cost threshold criteria. 
Although the applicant submitted data 
related to the estimated cost of the 
Zephyr EBV per case, the applicant 
noted that the cost of the device was 
proprietary information because the 
device is not yet available on the open 
market. The applicant estimates $23,920 
in charges related to the Zephyr EBV 
(based on a 100 percent charge markup 
of the cost of the device). In addition to 
case-weighting the data based on the 
amount of cases that the applicant 
found in the FY 2006 MedPAR file, the 
applicant case-weighted the data based 
on its own projections of how many 
Medicare cases it would expect to map 
to MS–DRGs 190, 191, and 192 in FY 
2009. The applicant projects that, 5 
percent of the cases would map to MS– 
DRG 190, 15 percent of the cases would 
map to MS–DRG 191, and 80 percent of 
the cases would map to MS–DRG 192. 
Adding the charges related to the device 
to the average standardized charge per 
case (based on the applicant’s projected 
case distribution) resulted in a case- 
weighted average standardized charge 
per case of $36,782 ($12,862 plus 
$23,920). Using the thresholds 
published in Table 10 (72 FR 66889), 
the case-weighted threshold for MS– 
DRGs 190, 191, and 192 was $18,394. 
Because the case-weighted average 
standardized charge per case for the 
applicable MS–DRGs exceed the case- 
weighted threshold amount, the 
applicant maintains that the Zephyr 
EBV would meet the cost criterion. As 
noted above, the applicant also 
performed a case-weighted analysis of 
the data based on the 14,653 cases the 
applicant found in the FY 2006 
MedPAR file. Based on this analysis, the 
applicant found that the case-weighted 
average standardized charge per case 
($38,441 based on the 14,653 cases) 
exceeded the case-weighted threshold 
($20,606 based on the 14,653 cases). 
Based on both analyses described above, 
it appears that the applicant would meet 
the cost criterion. We invite public 
comment on whether Zephyr EBV 
meets the cost criterion. 
The applicant asserts that the 
Zephyr EBV is a substantial clinical 
improvement because it provides a new 
therapy along the continuum of care for 
patients with emphysema that offers 
improvement in lung function over 
standard medical therapy while 
incurring significantly less risk than 
more invasive treatments such as LVRS

14 Strange, Charlie., et al., design of the 
Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation trial 
(VENT): A Nonsurgical Method of Lung Volume 
Reduction, BMC Pulmonary Medicine. 2007; 7:10. 
and lung transplant. Specifically, the 
applicant submitted data from the 
ongoing pivotal Endobronchial Valve for 
Emphysema Palliation (VENT) trial,14 
which compared 220 patients who 
received EBV treatment to 101 patients 
who received standard medical therapy, 
including bronchodilators, steroids, 
mucolytics, and supplemental oxygen. 
At 6 months, patients who received the 
Zephyr EBV had an average of 7.2 
percent and 5.8 percent improvement 
(compared to standard medical therapy) 
in the primary effectiveness endpoints 
of the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 
second test (FEV1), and the 6 Minute 
Walk Test (6MWT), respectively. Both 
results were determined by the 
applicant to be statistically significant. 
The FEV1 results were determined 
using the t-test parametric confidence 
intervals (the p value determined using 
the one-side t-test adjusted for unequal 
variance) and the 6MWT results were 
determined using the Mann-Whitney 
nonparametric confidence intervals (the 
p value was calculated using the one- 
sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). 
However, the data also showed that 
patients who received the Zephyr EBV 
experienced a number of adverse events, 
including hemoptyis, pneumonia, 
respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and 
COPD exacerbations, as well as valve 
migrations and expectorations that, in 
some cases, required repeat 
bronchoscopy. The manufacturer also 
submitted the VENT pivotal trial 1-year 
follow-up data, but has requested that 
the data not be disclosed because it has 
not yet been presented publicly nor 
published in a peer-reviewed journal. 
While CMS recognizes that the 
Zephyr EBV therapy is significantly 
less risky than LVRS and lung 
transplant, we are concerned that the 
benefits as shown in the VENT pivotal 
trial may not outweigh the risks when 
compared with medical therapy alone. 
Further, we note that, according to the 
applicant, the Zephyr EBV is intended 
for use in many patients who are 
ineligible for LVRS and/or lung 
transplant (including those too sick to 
undergo more invasive surgery and 
those with lower lobe predominant 
disease distribution), but that certain 
patients (that is, those with upper lobe 
predominant disease distribution) could 
be eligible for either surgery or the 
Zephyr EBV. We welcome comments 
from the public on both the patient 
population who would be eligible for 
the technology, and whether the 
Zephyr EBV represents a substantial 
clinical improvement in the treatment of 
patients with emphysema. 
We received written comments from 
the manufacturer and its presenters at 
the town hall meeting clarifying some 
questions that were raised at the town 
hall meeting. Specifically, these 
commenters explained that, in general, 
the target population for the Zephyr 
EBV device was the same population 
that could benefit from LVRS, and also 
includes some patients who were too 
sick to undergo surgery. The 
commenters also explained that patients 
with emphysema with more 
heterogeneous lung damage were more 
likely to benefit from the device. 
We welcome public comments 
regarding where exactly this technology 
falls in the continuum of care of patients 
with emphysema, and for whom the 
risk/benefit ratio is most favorable. 
c. Oxiplex 
FzioMed, Inc. submitted an 
application for new technology add-on 
payments for FY 2009 for Oxiplex. 
Oxiplex is an absorbable, viscoelastic 
gel made of carboxymethylcellulose 
(CMC) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) 
that is intended to be surgically 
implanted during a posterior 
discectomy, laminotomy, or 
laminectomy. The manufacturer asserts 
that the gel reduces the potential for 
inflammatory mediators that injure, 
tether, or antagonize the nerve root in 
the epidural space by creating an 
acquiescent, semi-permeable 
environment to protect against localized 
debris. These proinflammatory 
mediators (phospholipase A and nitric 
oxide), induced or extruded by 
intervertebral discs, may be responsible 
for increased pain during these 
procedures. The manufacturer also 
asserts that Oxiplex is a unique 
material in that it coats tissue, such as 
the nerve root in the epidural space, to 
protect the nerve root from the effects of 
inflammatory mediators originating 
from either the nucleus pulposus, from 
blood derived inflammatory cells, or 
cytokines during the healing process. 
Oxiplex is expecting to receive 
premarket approval from the FDA by 
June 2008. Because the technology is 
not yet approved by the FDA, we will 
limit our discussion of this technology 
to data that the applicant submitted, 
rather than make specific proposals 
with respect to whether the device 
would meet the new technology add-on 
payment criteria. 
With regard to the newness criterion, 
we are concerned that Oxiplex may be 
substantially similar to adhesion 
barriers that have been on the market for 
several years. We also note that 
Oxiplex has been marketed as an 
adhesion barrier in other countries 
outside of the United States. The 
manufacturer maintains that Oxiplex 
is different from adhesion barriers in 
several ways, including chemical 
composition, method of action, surgical 
application (that is, it is applied 
liberally to the nerve root and 
surrounding neural tissues as opposed 
to minimally only to nerve elements), 
and tissue response (noninflammatory 
as opposed to inflammatory). We 
welcome comments from the public on 
this issue. 
In an effort to demonstrate that the 
technology meets the cost criterion, the 
applicant searched the FY 2006 
MedPAR file for cases with ICD–9–CM 
procedure codes 03.09 (Other 
exploration and decompression of 
spinal canal) or 80.51 (Excision of 
interveterbral disc) that mapped to CMS 
DRGs 499 and 500 (CMS DRGs 499 and 
500 are crosswalked to MS–DRGs 490 
and 491 (Back and Neck Procedures 
except Spinal Fusion with or without 
CC)). Because these cases do not include 
charges associated with the technology, 
the applicant determined it was 
necessary to add an additional $7,143 in 
charges to the average standardized 
charge per case of cases that map to 
MS–DRGs 490 and 491. (To do this, the 
applicant used a methodology of 
inflating the costs of the technology by 
the average CCR computed by using the 
average costs and charges for supplies 
for cases with ICD–9–CM procedure 
codes 03.09 and 80.51 that map to MS– 
DRGs 490 and 491). Of the 221,505 
cases the applicant found, 95,340 cases 
(or 43 percent of cases) would map to 
MS–DRG 490, which has an average 
standardized charge of $60,301, and 
126,165 cases (or 57 percent of cases) 
would map to MS–DRG 491, which has 
an average standardized charge per case 
of $43,888. This resulted in a case- 
weighted average standardized charge 
per case of $50,952. The case-weighted 
threshold for MS–DRGs 490 and 491 
was $27,481. Because the case-weighted 
average standardized charge per case 
exceeds the case-weighted threshold in 
MS–DRGs 490 and 491, the applicant 
maintains that Oxiplex would meet 
the cost criterion. We invite public 
comment on whether Oxiplex meets 
the cost criterion. 
The manufacturer maintains that 
Oxiplex is a substantial clinical 
improvement because it ‘‘creates a 
protective environment around the 
neural tissue that limits nerve root 
exposure to post-surgical irritants and 
damage and thus reduces adverse 
outcomes associated with Failed Back

Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) following 
surgery.’’ The manufacturer also claims 
that the Oxiplex gel reduces leg and 
back pain after discectomy, 
laminectomy, and laminotomy. The 
manufacturer also asserts that the use of 
Oxiplex is consistent with fewer 
revision surgeries. (During the FDA 
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) 
trial, one Oxiplex patient required 
revision surgery compared to six control 
patients.) However, as we noted 
previously in this section, we are 
concerned that Oxiplex may be 
substantially similar to adhesion 
barriers that have been on the market for 
several years. We are also concerned 
that even if we were to determine that 
Oxiplex is not substantially similar to 
existing adhesion barriers, there may 
still be insufficient evidence to support 
the manufacturer’s claims that Oxiplex 
reduces pain associated with spinal 
surgery. In addition, we have found no 
evidence to support the manufacturer’s 
claims regarding mode of action, degree 
of dural healing, degree of wound 
healing, and local tissue response such 
as might be shown in animal studies. 
We welcome comments from the public 
regarding whether Oxiplex represents 
a substantial clinical improvement. 
We did not receive any written 
comments or public comments at the 
town hall meeting regarding the 
substantial clinical improvement 
aspects of this technology. 
d. TherOx Downstream System 
TherOx, Inc. submitted an application 
for new technology add-on payments for 
FY 2009 for the TherOx Downstream 
System (Downstream System). The 
Downstream System uses 
SuperSaturatedOxygen Therapy (SSO2) 
that is designed to limit myocardial 
necrosis by minimizing microvascular 
damage in acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) patients following intervention 
with Percutaneous Transluminal 
Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA), and 
coronary stent placement by perfusing 
the affected myocardium with blood 
that has been supersaturated with 
oxygen. SSO2 therapy refers to the 
delivery of superoxygenated arterial 
blood directly to areas of myocardial 
tissue that have been reperfused using 
PTCA and stent placement, but which 
may still be at risk. The desired effect 
of SSO2 therapy is to reduce infarct size 
and thus preserve heart muscle and 
function. The DownStream System is 
the console portion of a disposable 
cartridge-based system that withdraws a 
small amount of the patient’s arterial 
blood, mixes it with a small amount of 
saline, and supersaturates it with 
oxygen to create highly oxygen-enriched 
blood. The superoxygenated blood is 
delivered directly to the infarct-related 
artery via the TherOx infusion catheter. 
SSO2 therapy is a catheter laboratory- 
based procedure. Additional time in the 
catheter lab area is an average of 100 
minutes. The manufacturer claims that 
the SSO2 therapy duration lasts 90 
minutes and requires an additional 10 
minutes post-procedure preparation for 
transfer time. The TherOx 
Downstream System is currently not 
FDA approved; however, the 
manufacturer states that it expects to 
receive FDA approval in the second 
quarter of 2008. Because the technology 
is not yet approved by the FDA, we will 
limit our discussion of this technology 
to data that the applicant submitted, 
rather than make specific proposals 
with respect to whether the device 
would meet the new technology add-on 
criteria. 
In an effort to demonstrate that it 
would meet the cost criterion, the 
applicant submitted two analyses. The 
applicant believes that cases that would 
be eligible for the Downstream System 
would most frequently group to MS– 
DRGs 246 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular 
Procedure with Drug-Eluting Stent with 
MCC or 4+Vessels/Stents), 247 
(Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure 
with Drug-Eluting Stent without MCC), 
248 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular 
Procedure with Non-Drug-Eluting Stent 
with MCC or 4+Vessels/Stents), and 249 
(Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure 
with Non-Drug-Eluting Stent without 
MCC). The first analysis used data based 
on 83 clinical trial patients from 10 
clinical sites. Of the 83 cases, 78 were 
assigned to MS–DRGs 246, 247, 248, or 
249. The data showed that 32 of these 
patients were 65 years old or older. 
There were 12 cases (or 15.4 percent of 
cases) in MS–DRG 246, 56 cases (or 71.8 
percent of cases) in MS–DRG 247, 2 
cases (or 2.6 percent of cases) in MS– 
DRG 248, and 8 cases (or 10.3 percent 
of cases) in MS–DRG 249. (The 
remaining five cases grouped to MS– 
DRGs that the technology would not 
frequently group to and therefore are not 
included in this analysis.) The average 
standardized charge per case for MS– 
DRGs 246, 247, 248, and 249 was 
$66,730, $53,963, $54,977, and $41,594, 
respectively. The case-weighted average 
standardized charge per case for the four 
MS–DRGs listed above is $54,665. Based 
on the threshold from Table 10 (72 FR 
66890), the case-weighted threshold for 
the four MS–DRGs listed above was 
$49,303. The applicant also searched 
the FY 2006 MedPAR file to identify 
cases that would be eligible for the 
Downstream System. The applicant 
specifically searched for cases with 
primary ICD–9–CM diagnosis code 
410.00 (Acute myocardial infarction of 
anterolateral wall with episode of care 
unspecified), 410.01 (Acute myocardial 
infarction of anterolateral wall with 
initial episode of care), 410.10 (Acute 
myocardial infarction of other anterior 
wall with episode of care unspecified), 
or 410.11 (Acute myocardial infarction 
of other anterior wall with initial 
episode of care) in combination with 
ICD–9–CM procedure code of 36.06 
(Insertion of non-drug-eluting coronary 
artery stent(s)) or 36.07 (Insertion of 
drug-eluting coronary artery stent(s)). 
The applicant’s search found 13,527 
cases within MS–DRGs 246, 247, 248, 
and 249 distributed as follows: 2,287 
cases (or 16.9 percent of cases) in MS– 
DRG 246; 9,691 cases (or 71.6 percent of 
cases) in MS–DRG 247; 402 cases (or 3 
percent of cases) in MS–DRG 248; and 
1,147 cases (or 8.5 percent of cases) in 
MS–DRG 249. Not including the charges 
associated with the technology, the 
geometric mean standardized charge per 
case for MS–DRGs 246, 247, 248, and 
249 was $59,631, $42,357, $49,718 and 
$37,446, respectively. Therefore, based 
on this analysis, the total case-weighted 
geometric mean standardized charge per 
case across these MS–DRGs was 
$45,080. The applicant estimated that it 
was necessary to add an additional 
$21,620 in charges to the total case- 
weighted geometric mean standardized 
charge per case. The applicant included 
charges for supplies and tests related to 
the technology, charges for 100 minutes 
of additional procedure time in the 
catheter laboratory and charges for the 
technology itself in the additional 
charge amount referenced above. The 
inclusion of these charges would result 
in a total case-weighted geometric mean 
standardized charge per case of $66,700. 
The case-weighted threshold for MS– 
DRGs 246, 247, 248, and 249 (from 
Table 10 (72 FR 66889)) was $49,714. 
Because the total case-weighted average 
standardized charge per case from the 
first analysis and the case-weighted 
geometric mean standardized charge per 
case from the second analysis exceeds 
the applicable case-weighted threshold, 
the applicant maintains the 
Downstream System would meet the 
cost criterion. We invite public 
comment on whether Downstream 
System meets the cost criterion. 
The applicant asserts that the 
Downstream System is a substantial 
clinical improvement because it reduces 
infarct size in acute AMI where PTCA 
and stent placement have also been 
performed. Data was submitted from the

15 Oneill, WW., et al., Acute Myocardial 
Infarction with Hyperoxemic Therapy (AMIHOT): A 
Prospective Randomized Trial of Intracoronary 
Hyperoxemic Reperfusion after Percutaneous 
Coronary Intervention. Journal of the American 
College of Cardiology, Vol. 50, No. 5, 2007, pp. 397– 
405. 
Oxygen Treatment (AMIHOT) II trial, 
which was presented at the October 
2007 Transcatheter Cardiovascular 
Therapeutics conference, but has not 
been published in peer reviewed 
literature, that showed an average of 6.5 
percent reduction in infarct size as 
measured with Tc–99m Sestamibi 
imaging in patients who received 
supersaturated oxygen therapy. We note 
that those patients also showed a 
significantly higher incidence of 
bleeding complications. While we 
recognize that a reduction of infarct size 
may correlate with improved clinical 
outcomes, we question whether the 
degree of infarct size reduction found in 
the trial represents a substantial clinical 
improvement, particularly in light of the 
apparent increase in bleeding 
complications. We welcome comments 
from the public on this matter. 
We received one written comment 
from the manufacturer clarifying 
questions that were raised at the town 
hall meeting. Specifically, the 
commenter explained the methodology 
of Tc–99m Sestamibi scanning and 
interpretation in the AMIHOT II trial. In 
addition, the commenter explained that 
the AMIHOT 15 and AMIHOT II trials 
did not attempt to measure differences 
in heart failure outcomes nor mortality 
outcomes. 
5. Proposed Regulatory Change 
Section 1886(d)(5)(K)(i) of the Act 
directs us to establish a mechanism to 
recognize the cost of new medical 
services and technologies under the 
IPPS, with such mechanism established 
after notice and opportunity for public 
comment. In accordance with this 
authority, we established at § 412.87(b) 
of our regulations criteria that a medical 
service or technology must meet in 
order to qualify for the additional 
payment for new medical services and 
technologies. Specifically, we evaluate 
applications for new medical service or 
technology add-on payment by 
determining whether they meet the 
criteria of newness, adequacy of 
payment, and substantial clinical 
improvement. 
As stated in section III.J.1. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, 
§ 412.87(b)(2) of our existing regulations 
provides that a specific medical service 
or technology will be considered new 
for purposes of new medical service or 
technology add-on payments after the 
point at which data begin to become 
available reflecting the ICD–9–CM code 
assigned to the new service or 
technology. The point at which these 
data become available typically begins 
when the new medical service or 
technology is first introduced on the 
market, generally on the date that the 
medical service or technology receives 
FDA approval. Accordingly, for 
purposes of the new medical service or 
technology add-on payment, a medical 
service or technology cannot be 
considered new prior to the date on 
which FDA approval is granted. 
In addition, as stated in section III.J.1. 
of the preamble of this proposed rule, 
§ 412.87(b)(3) of our existing regulations 
provides that, to be eligible for the add- 
on payment for new medical services or 
technologies, the DRG prospective 
payment rate otherwise applicable to 
the discharge involving the new medical 
service or technology must be assessed 
for adequacy. Under the cost criterion, 
to assess the adequacy of payment for a 
new medical service or technology paid 
under the applicable DRG prospective 
payment rate, we evaluate whether the 
charges for cases involving the new 
medical service or technology exceed 
certain threshold amounts. 
Section 412.87(b)(1) of our existing 
regulations provides that, to be eligible 
for the add-on payment for new medical 
services or technologies, the new 
medical service or technology must 
represent an advance that substantially 
improves, relative to technologies 
previously available, the diagnosis or 
treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. In 
addition, § 412.87(b)(1) states that CMS 
will announce its determination as to 
whether a new medical service or 
technology meets the substantial 
clinical improvement criteria in the 
Federal Register as part of the annual 
updates and changes to the IPPS. 
Since the implementation of the 
policy on add-on payments for new 
medical services and technologies, we 
accept applications for add-on payments 
for new medical services and 
technologies on an annual basis by a 
specified deadline. For example, 
applications for FY 2009 were 
submitted in November 2007. After 
accepting applications, CMS then 
evaluates them in the annual IPPS 
proposed and final rules to determine 
whether the medical service or 
technology is eligible for the new 
medical service or technology add-on 
payment. If an application meets each of 
the eligibility criteria, the medical 
service or technology is eligible for new 
medical service or technology add-on 
payments beginning on the first day of 
the new fiscal year (that is, October 1). 
We have advised prior and potential 
applicants that we evaluate whether a 
medical service or technology is eligible 
for the new medical service or 
technology add-on payments prior to 
publication of the final rule setting forth 
the annual updates and changes to the 
IPPS, with the results of our 
determination announced in the final 
rule. We announce our results in the 
final rule for each fiscal year because we 
believe predictability is an important 
aspect of the IPPS and that it is 
important to apply a consistent payment 
methodology for new medical services 
or technologies throughout the entire 
fiscal year. For example, hospitals must 
train their billing and other staff after 
publication of the final rule to properly 
implement the coding and payment 
changes for the upcoming fiscal year set 
forth in the final rule. In addition, 
hospitals’ budgetary process and 
clinical decisions regarding whether to 
utilize new technologies are based in 
part on the applicable payment rates 
under the IPPS for the upcoming fiscal 
year, including whether the new 
medical services or technologies qualify 
for the new medical service or 
technology add-on payment. If CMS 
were to make multiple payment changes 
under the IPPS during a fiscal year, 
these changes could adversely affect the 
decisions hospitals implement at the 
beginning of the fiscal year. For these 
reasons, we believe applications for new 
medical service or technology add-on 
payments should be evaluated prior to 
publication of the final IPPS rule for 
each fiscal year. Therefore, if an 
application does not meet the new 
medical service or technology add-on 
payment criteria prior to publication of 
the final rule, it will not be eligible for 
the new medical service or technology 
add-on payments for the fiscal year for 
which it applied for the add-on 
payments. 
Because we make our determination 
regarding whether a medical service or 
technology meets the eligibility criteria 
for the new medical service or 
technology add-on payments prior to 
publication of the final rule, we have 
advised both past and potential 
applicants that their medical service or 
technology must receive FDA approval 
early enough in the IPPS rulemaking 
cycle to allow CMS enough time to fully 
evaluate the application prior to the 
publication of the IPPS final rule. 
Moreover, because new medical services 
or technologies that have not received 
FDA approval do not meet the newness 
criterion, it would not be necessary or 
prudent for us to make a final 
determination regarding whether a new

medical service or technology meets the 
cost threshold and substantial clinical 
improvement criteria prior to the 
medical service or technology receiving 
FDA approval. In addition, we do not 
believe it is appropriate for CMS to 
determine whether a medical service or 
technology represents a substantial 
clinical improvement over existing 
technologies before the FDA makes a 
determination as to whether the medical 
service or technology is safe and 
effective. For these reasons, we first 
determine whether a medical service or 
technology meets the newness criteria, 
and only if so, do we then make a 
determination as to whether the 
technology meets the cost threshold and 
represents a substantial clinical 
improvement over existing medical 
services or technologies. For example, 
even if an application has FDA 
approval, if the medical service or 
technology is beyond the timeline of 2– 
3 years to be considered new, in the past 
we have not made a determination on 
the cost threshold and substantial 
clinical improvement. Further, as we 
have discussed in prior final rules (69 
FR 49018–49019 and 70 FR 47344), it is 
our past and present practice to analyze 
the new medical service or technology 
add-on payment criteria in the following 
sequence: Newness, cost threshold, and 
finally substantial clinical 
improvement. Under our proposal in 
this proposed rule, we would continue 
this practice of analyzing the eligibility 
criteria in this sequence and announce 
in the annual Federal Register as part of 
the annual updates and changes to the 
IPPS our determination on whether a 
medical service or technology meets the 
eligibility criteria in § 412.87(b). 
In the interest of more clearly defining 
the parameters under which CMS can 
fully and completely evaluate new 
medical service or technology add-on 
payment applications, we are proposing 
to amend the regulations at § 412.87 by 
adding a new paragraph (c) to codify our 
current policy and specify that CMS 
will consider whether a new medical 
service or technology meets the 
eligibility criteria in § 412.87(b) and 
announce the results in the Federal 
Register as part of the annual updates 
and changes to the IPPS. As a result, we 
are proposing to remove the duplicative 
text in § 412.87(b)(1) that specifies that 
CMS will determine whether a new 
medical service or technology meets the 
substantial clinical improvement 
criteria and announce the results of its 
determination in the Federal Register as 
part of the annual updates and changes 
to the IPPS. We note that this proposal 
is not a change to our current policy, as 
we have always given consideration to 
whether an application meets the new 
medical service or technology eligibility 
criteria in the annual IPPS proposed and 
final rules. Rather, this proposal simply 
codifies our current practice of fully 
evaluating new medical service or 
technology add-on payment 
applications prior to publication of the 
final rule in order to maintain 
predictability within the IPPS for the 
upcoming fiscal year. 
In addition, we are proposing in new 
paragraph (c) of § 412.87 to set July 1 of 
each year as the deadline by which IPPS 
new medical service or technology add- 
on payment applications must receive 
FDA approval. This proposed deadline 
should provide us with enough time to 
fully consider all of the new medical 
service or technology add-on payment 
criteria for each application and 
maintain predictability in the IPPS for 
the coming fiscal year. 
Finally, under this proposal, 
applications that have not received FDA 
approval by July 1 would not be 
considered in the final rule, even if they 
were summarized in the corresponding 
IPPS proposed rule. However, 
applications that receive FDA approval 
of the medical service or technology 
after July 1 would be able to reapply for 
the new medical service or technology 
add-on payment the following year (at 
which time they would be given full 
consideration in both the IPPS proposed 
and final rules). 
In summary, for the reasons cited 
above, we are proposing to revise 
§ 412.87 to remove the second sentence 
of (b)(1) and add a new paragraph (c) to 
codify our current practice of how CMS 
evaluates new medical service or 
technology add-on payment 
applications and establish in paragraph 
(c) a deadline of July 1 of each year as 
the deadline by which IPPS new 
medical service or technology add-on 
payment applications must receive FDA 
approval in order to be fully evaluated 
in the applicable IPPS final rule each 
year. 
III. Proposed Changes to the Hospital 
Wage Index 
A. Background 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act 
requires that, as part of the methodology 
for determining prospective payments to 
hospitals, the Secretary must adjust the 
standardized amounts ‘‘for area 
differences in hospital wage levels by a 
factor (established by the Secretary) 
reflecting the relative hospital wage 
level in the geographic area of the 
hospital compared to the national 
average hospital wage level.’’ In 
accordance with the broad discretion 
conferred under the Act, we currently 
define hospital labor market areas based 
on the definitions of statistical areas 
established by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB). A discussion of the 
proposed FY 2009 hospital wage index 
based on the statistical areas, including 
OMB’s revised definitions of 
Metropolitan Areas, appears under 
section III.C. of this preamble. 
Beginning October 1, 1993, section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that we 
update the wage index annually. 
Furthermore, this section provides that 
the Secretary base the update on a 
survey of wages and wage-related costs 
of short-term, acute care hospitals. The 
survey must exclude the wages and 
wage-related costs incurred in 
furnishing skilled nursing services. This 
provision also requires us to make any 
updates or adjustments to the wage 
index in a manner that ensures that 
aggregate payments to hospitals are not 
affected by the change in the wage 
index. The proposed adjustment for FY 
2009 is discussed in section II.B. of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. 
As discussed below in section III.I. of 
this preamble, we also take into account 
the geographic reclassification of 
hospitals in accordance with sections 
1886(d)(8)(B) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act 
when calculating IPPS payment 
amounts. Under section 1886(d)(8)(D) of 
the Act, the Secretary is required to 
adjust the standardized amounts so as to 
ensure that aggregate payments under 
the IPPS after implementation of the 
provisions of sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and 
(C) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act are equal 
to the aggregate prospective payments 
that would have been made absent these 
provisions. The proposed budget 
neutrality adjustment for FY 2009 is 
discussed in section II.A.4.b. of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act also 
provides for the collection of data every 
3 years on the occupational mix of 
employees for short-term, acute care 
hospitals participating in the Medicare 
program, in order to construct an 
occupational mix adjustment to the 
wage index. A discussion of the 
occupational mix adjustment that we 
are proposing to apply beginning 
October 1, 2008 (the FY 2009 wage 
index) appears under section III.D. of 
this preamble.

MIEA–TRHCA

23618 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
MedPAC to submit to Congress, not later 
than June 30, 2007, a report on the 
Medicare wage index classification 
system applied under the Medicare 
IPPS. Section 106(b) of MIEA–TRHCA 
required the report to include any 
alternatives that MedPAC recommends 
to the method to compute the wage 
index under section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the 
Act. 
In addition, section 106(b)(2) of the 
MIEA–TRHCA instructed the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services, taking 
into account MedPAC’s 
recommendations on the Medicare wage 
index classification system, to include 
in this FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule one 
or more proposals to revise the wage 
index adjustment applied under section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act for purposes of 
the IPPS. The proposal (or proposals) 
must consider each of the following: 
• Problems associated with the 
definition of labor markets for the wage 
index adjustment. 
• The modification or elimination of 
geographic reclassifications and other 
adjustments. 
• The use of Bureau of Labor of 
Statistics data or other data or 
methodologies to calculate relative 
wages for each geographic area. 
• Minimizing variations in wage 
index adjustments between and within 
MSAs and statewide rural areas. 
• The feasibility of applying all 
components of CMS’ proposal to other 
settings. 
• Methods to minimize the volatility 
of wage index adjustments while 
maintaining the principle of budget 
neutrality. 
• The effect that the implementation 
of the proposal would have on health 
care providers on each region of the 
country. 
• Methods for implementing the 
proposal(s) including methods to phase 
in such implementations. 
• Issues relating to occupational mix 
such as staffing practices and any 
evidence on quality of care and patient 
safety including any recommendation 
for alternative calculations to the 
occupational mix. 
In its June 2007 Report to Congress, 
‘‘Report to the Congress: Promoting 
Greater Efficiency in Medicare’’ 
(Chapter 6 with Appendix), MedPAC 
made three broad recommendations 
regarding the wage index: 
(1) Congress should repeal the 
existing hospital wage index statute, 
including reclassifications and 
exceptions, and give the Secretary 
authority to establish a new wage index 
system; 
(2) The Secretary should establish a 
hospital compensation index that— 
• Uses wage data from all employers 
and industry-specific occupational 
weights; 
• Is adjusted for geographic 
differences in the ratio of benefits to 
wages; 
• Is adjusted at the county level and 
smoothes large differences between 
counties; and 
• Is implemented so that large 
changes in wage index values are 
phased in over a transition period; and 
(3) The Secretary should use the 
hospital compensation index for the 
home health and skilled nursing facility 
prospective payment systems and 
evaluate its use in the other Medicare 
fee-for-service prospective payment 
systems. 
The full June 2007 Report to Congress 
is available at the Web site: http:// 
www.medpac.gov/documents/ 
Jun07_EntireReport.pdf). 
In the presentation and analysis of its 
alternative wage index system, MedPAC 
addressed almost all of the nine points 
for consideration under section 
106(b)(2) of Pub. L. 109–432. Following 
are the highlights of the alternative wage 
index system recommended by 
MedPAC: 
• Although the MedPAC 
recommended wage index generally 
retains the current labor market 
definitions, it supplements the 
metropolitan areas with county-level 
adjustments and eliminates single wage 
index values for rural areas. 
• In the MedPAC recommended 
wage index, the county-level 
adjustments, together with a smoothing 
process that constrains the magnitude of 
differences between and within 
contiguous wage areas, serve as a 
replacement for geographical 
reclassifications. 
• The MedPAC recommended wage 
index uses BLS data instead of the CMS 
hospital wage data collected on the 
Medicare cost report. MedPAC adjusts 
the BLS data for geographic differences 
in the ratio of benefits to wages using 
Medicare cost report data. 
• The BLS data are collected from a 
sample of all types of employers, not 
just hospitals. The MedPAC 
recommended wage index could be 
adapted to other providers such as 
HHAs and SNFs by replacing hospital 
occupational weights with occupational 
weights appropriate for other types of 
providers. 
• In the MedPAC recommended 
wage index, volatility over time is 
addressed by the use of BLS data, which 
is based on a 3-year rolling sample 
design. 
• MedPAC recommends a phased 
implementation for its recommended 
wage index in order to cushion the 
effect of large wage index changes on 
individual hospitals. 
• MedPAC suggests that using BLS 
data automatically addresses 
occupational mix differences, because 
the BLS data are specific to health care 
occupations, and national industry-wide 
occupational weights are applied to all 
geographic areas. 
• The MedPAC report does not 
provide any evidence of the impact of 
its wage index on staffing practices or 
the quality of care and patient safety. 
To assist CMS in meeting the 
requirements of section 106(b)(2) of Pub. 
L. 109–432, in February 2008, CMS 
awarded a Task Order under its 
Expedited Research and Demonstration 
Contract, to Acumen, LLC. The two 
general responsibilities of the Task 
Order are to (1) conduct a detailed 
impact analysis that compares the 
effects of MedPAC’s wage and hospital 
compensation indexes with the CMS 
wage index and (2) assist CMS in 
developing a proposal (or proposals) 
that addresses the nine points for 
consideration under section 106(b)(2) of 
Pub. L. 109–432. Specifically, the tasks 
under the Task Order include, but are 
not limited to, an evaluation of whether 
differences between the two types of 
wage data (that is, CMS cost report and 
occupational mix data and BLS data) 
produce significant differences in wage 
index values among labor market areas, 
a consideration of alternative methods 
of incorporating benefit costs into the 
construction of the wage index, a review 
of past and current research on 
alternative labor market area definitions, 
and a consideration of how aspects of 
the MedPAC recommended wage index 
can be applied to the CMS wage data in 
constructing a new methodology for the 
wage index. We will present any 
analyses and proposals resulting from 
this Task Order in the FY 2009 IPPS 
final rule or in a special Federal 
Register notice issued after the final rule 
is published. 
2. CMS Proposals in Response to 
Requirements Under Section 106(b) of 
the MIEA–TRHCA 
As discussed in section III.A. of this 
preamble, the purpose of the hospital 
wage index is to adjust the IPPS 
standardized payment to reflect labor 
market area differences in wage levels. 
The geographic reclassification system 
exists in order to assist ‘‘hospitals which 
are disadvantaged by their current 
geographic classification because they 
compete with hospitals that are located 
in the geographic area to which they 
seek to be reclassified’’ (56 FR 25469). 
Geographic reclassification is

23619 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
established under section 1886(d)(10) of 
the Act and is implemented through 42 
CFR Part 412, Subpart L. (We refer 
readers to section III.I. of this preamble 
for a detailed discussion of the 
geographic reclassification system and 
other area wage index exceptions.) 
In its June 2007 Report to Congress, 
MedPAC discussed its findings that 
geographic reclassification, and 
numerous other area wage index 
exceptions added to the system over the 
years, have created major complexities 
and ‘‘troubling anomalies’’ in the 
hospital wage index. A review of the 
IPPS final rules reveals a long history of 
legislative changes that have permitted 
certain hospitals, that otherwise would 
not be able to reclassify under section 
1886(d)(10) of the Act, to receive a 
higher wage index than calculated for 
their geographic area. MedPAC reports 
that more than one-third of hospitals 
now receive a higher wage index due to 
geographic reclassification or other 
wage index exceptions. We are 
concerned about the integrity of the 
current system, and agree with MedPAC 
that the process has become 
burdensome. 
As noted above, MedPAC 
recommended the elimination of 
geographic reclassification and other 
wage index exceptions. In addition, the 
President’s FY 2009 Budget included a 
proposal to apply the geographic 
reclassification budget neutrality 
requirement at the State level rather 
than by adjusting the standardized rate 
for hospitals nationwide. Given the 
language in section 1886(d)(10) of the 
Act establishing the MGCRB, we believe 
a statutory change would be required to 
make these changes. However, we do 
have the authority to make some 
regulatory changes to the 
reclassification system as discussed 
below. We note that these proposals do 
not preclude future consideration of 
MedPAC’s recommendations that could 
be implemented through additional 
changes to our regulations, once our 
analysis of those recommendations is 
complete (after the publication of the FY 
2009 IPPS proposed rule). 
a. Proposed Revision of the 
Reclassification Average Hourly Wage 
Comparison Criteria 
Regulations at 42 CFR 413.230(d)(1) 
set forth the average hourly wage 
comparison criteria that an individual 
hospital must meet in order for the 
MGCRB to approve a geographic 
reclassification application. Our current 
criteria (requiring an urban hospital to 
demonstrate that its average hourly 
wage is at least 108 percent of the 
average hourly wage of hospitals in the 
area in which the hospital is located and 
at least 84 percent of the average hourly 
wage of hospitals in the area to which 
it seeks redesignation) were adopted in 
the FY 1993 IPPS final rule (57 FR 
39825). In that final rule, we explained 
that the 108 percent threshold ‘‘is based 
on the national average hospital wage as 
a percentage of its area wage (96 
percent) plus one standard deviation (12 
percent).’’ We also explained that we 
would use the 84-percent threshold to 
reflect the average hospital wage of the 
hospital as a percentage of its area wage 
less one standard deviation. We stated 
that ‘‘to qualify for a wage index 
reclassification, a hospital must have an 
average hourly wage that is more than 
one national standard deviation above 
its original labor market area and not 
less than one national standard 
deviation below its new labor market 
area’’ (57 FR 39770). In response to 
numerous public comments we 
received, we expressed our policy and 
legal justifications for adopting the 
specific thresholds. Among other things, 
we stated that geographic 
reclassifications must be viewed not just 
in terms of those hospitals that are 
reclassifying, but also in terms of the 
nonreclassifying hospitals that, through 
a budget neutrality adjustment, are 
required to bear a financial burden 
associated with the higher wage indices 
received by those hospitals that 
reclassify. We also indicated that the 
Secretary has ample legal authority 
under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act to 
set the wage comparison thresholds and 
to revise such thresholds upon further 
review. We refer readers to that final 
rule for a full discussion of our 
justifications for the standards. 
In the FY 2000 IPPS final rule (65 FR 
47089 through 47090), the wage 
comparison criteria for rural hospitals 
seeking individual hospital 
reclassifications were reduced to 82 
percent and 106 percent to compensate 
for the historic economic 
underperformance of rural hospitals. 
The 2-percent drop in both thresholds 
was determined to allow a significant 
benefit to some hospitals that were close 
to meeting the existing criteria but 
would not make the reclassification 
standards overly liberal for rural 
hospitals. 
CMS has not evaluated or recalibrated 
the average hourly wage criteria for 
geographic reclassification since they 
were established in FY 1993. In 
consideration of the MIEA–TRHCA 
requirements and MedPAC’s finding 
that over one-third of hospitals are 
receiving a reclassified wage index or 
other wage index adjustment, we 
decided to reevaluate the average hourly 
wage criteria for geographic 
reclassification. We ran simulations 
with more recent wage data to 
determine what would be the 
appropriate average hourly wage 
criteria. We found that the average 
hospital average hourly wage as a 
percentage of its area’s wage has 
increased from approximately 96 
percent in FY 1993 to closer to 98 
percent over FYs 2006, 2007, and 2008 
(97.8, 98.2, and 98 percent, 
respectively). We also determined that 
the standard deviation has been reduced 
from approximately 12 percent in FY 
1993 to closer to 10 percent over the 
same 3-year period (10.7, 10.4, and 10.4 
percent, respectively); that is, assuming 
normal distributions, approximately 68 
percent of all hospitals would have an 
average hourly wage that deviates less 
than 10 percentage points above or 
below the mean. This assessment 
indicates that the new baseline criteria 
for reclassification should be set to 88/ 
108 percent. While the 108 criterion 
appears not to require adjustment, the 
current 84 percent standard appears to 
be too low a threshold to serve the 
purpose of establishing wage 
comparability with a proximate labor 
market area. 
To assess the impact that these 
changes would have had on hospitals 
that reclassified in FY 2008, we ran 
models that set urban individual 
reclassification standards to 88/108 
percent and the county group 
reclassification standard to 88 percent. 
We retained the 2-percent benefit for 
rural hospitals by setting an 86/106 
percent standard. We used 3-year 
average hourly wage figures from the 
2005, 2006, and 2007 wage surveys and 
compared them to 3-year average hourly 
wage figures for CBSAs over the same 3- 
year period. 
Of the 295 hospitals that applied for 
and received individual reclassifications 
in FY 2008, 45 of them (15.3 percent) 
would not meet the proposed 88/86 
percent threshold. Of the 66 hospitals 
that applied for and received county 
group reclassification in FY 2008, 6 
hospitals (9.1 percent) in 3 groups 
would not have qualified with the new 
standards. We also ran comparisons for 
hospitals that reclassified in FY 2006 
and FY 2007 to determine if they would 
have been able to reclassify in FY 2008, 
using 3-year averages available in FY 
2008. We found that, of all hospitals 
that were reclassified in FY 2008 (that 
is, applications approved for FYs 2006 
through 2008), 14.7 percent of 
individual reclassifications and 8.5 
percent of county group reclassification 
would not have qualified to reclassify in 
FY 2008.

23620 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Section 106 of MIEA–TRHCA requires 
us to propose revisions to the hospital 
wage index system after considering the 
recommendations of MedPAC. To 
address this requirement, we are 
proposing that the 84/108 criteria for 
urban hospital reclassifications and the 
82/106 criteria for rural hospital 
reclassifications be recalibrated using 
the methodology published in the FY 
1993 final rule and more recent wage 
data (that is, data used in computing the 
FYs 2006, 2007, 2008 wage indices). We 
believe that hospitals that are seeking to 
reclassify to another area should be 
required to demonstrate more similarity 
to the area than the current criteria 
permit, and our recent analysis 
demonstrates that those criteria are no 
longer appropriate. Therefore, we are 
proposing to change the criterion for the 
comparison of a hospital’s average 
hourly wage to that of the area to which 
the hospital seeks reclassification to 88 
percent for urban hospitals and 86 
percent for rural hospitals for new 
reclassifications beginning with the FY 
2010 wage index and, accordingly, 
revise our regulations at 42 CFR 412.230 
to reflect these changes. The criterion 
for the comparison of a hospital’s 
average hourly wage to that of its 
geographic area would be unchanged 
(108 percent for urban hospitals and 106 
percent for rural hospitals). We also are 
proposing that, when there are 
significant changes in labor market area 
definitions, such as CMS’ adoption of 
new OMB CBSA definitions based upon 
the decennial census (69 FR 49027), we 
would again reevaluate and, if 
warranted, recalibrate these criteria. 
This would allow CMS to consider the 
effects of periodic changes in labor 
market boundaries and provide a regular 
timeline for updating and validating the 
reclassification criteria. Finally, we are 
proposing to adjust the 85 percent 
criterion for both urban and rural 
county group reclassifications to be 
equal to the proposed 88 percent 
standard for urban reclassifications, and 
to revise the regulations at 42 CFR 
412.232 and 412.234 to reflect the 
change. The urban and rural county 
group average hourly wage standard has 
always been equivalent for both urban 
and rural county groups and has always 
been 1 percent higher than the 84 
percent urban area individual 
reclassification standard. We would 
continue the policy of having an 
equivalent wage comparison criterion 
for both urban and rural county groups, 
as these groups have always used the 
same wage comparison criteria. We also 
would use the individual urban hospital 
reclassification standard of 88 percent 
because this threshold would ensure 
that the hospitals in the county group 
are at least as comparable to the 
proximate area as are individual 
hospitals within their own areas. Also, 
we do not believe it would be 
appropriate to have a group 
reclassification standard lower than the 
individual reclassification standards, 
thus potentially creating a situation 
where all of the hospitals in a county 
could reclassify, even though no single 
hospital within such county would be 
able to meet any average hourly wage- 
related comparisons for an individual 
reclassification. 
We considered raising the group 
reclassification criterion to 89 percent in 
order to preserve the historical policy of 
the standard being set at 1 percent 
higher than the individual 
reclassification standard. However, we 
determined that making the group 
standard equal to the individual 
standard would adequately address our 
stated concerns. 
We note that the proposed changes in 
the reclassification criteria apply only to 
new reclassifications beginning with the 
FY 2010 wage index. Any hospital or 
county group that is in the midst of a 
3-year reclassification in FY 2010 will 
not be affected by the proposed criteria 
change until they reapply for a 
geographic reclassification. Therefore, 
we are proposing the effective date for 
these changes would be September 1, 
2008, the deadline for hospitals to 
submit applications for reclassification 
for the FY 2010 wage index. 
b. Within-State Budget Neutrality 
Adjustment for the Rural and Imputed 
Floors 
Section 4410 of the Balanced Budget 
Act of 1997 (BBA) established the rural 
floor by requiring that the wage index 
for a hospital in an urban area of a State 
cannot be less than the area wage index 
determined for that State’s rural area. 
Section 4410(b) of the BBA imposed the 
budget neutrality requirement and 
stated that the Secretary shall ‘‘adjust 
the area wage index referred to in 
subsection (a) for hospitals not 
described in such subsection.’’ 
Therefore, in order to compensate for 
the increased wage indices of urban 
hospitals receiving the rural floor, a 
nationwide budget neutrality 
adjustment is applied to the wage index 
to account for the additional payment to 
these hospitals. As a result, urban 
hospitals that qualify for their State’s 
rural floor wage index receive enhanced 
payments at the expense of all rural 
hospitals nationwide and all other 
urban hospitals that do not receive their 
State’s rural floor. In the FY 2009 
proposed wage index, 266 hospitals in 
27 States benefit from the rural floor. 
The first chart below lists the percentage 
of total payments each State either 
received or contributed to fund the 
current rural floor and imputed floor 
provisions with national budget 
neutrality adjustments (as indicated in 
the discussion of the imputed floor 
below in this section III.B.2.b.). The 
second chart below provides a graphical 
depiction of the proposed FY 2009 
impacts.

23622 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
The above charts demonstrate how, at 
a State-by-State level, the rural floor is 
creating a benefit for a minority of States 
that is then funded by a majority of 
States, including States that are 
overwhelmingly rural in character. The 
intent behind the rural floor seems to 
have been to address anomalous 
occurrences where certain urban areas 
in a State have unusually depressed 
wages when compared to the State’s 
rural areas. However, because these 
comparisons occur at the State level, we 
believe it also would be sound policy to 
make the budget neutrality adjustment 
specific to the State, redistributing 
payments among hospitals within the 
State, rather than adjusting payments to 
hospitals in other States. 
In addition, a statewide budget 
neutrality adjustment would address the 
situation we discussed in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47324) in which rural CAHs were 
converting to IPPS status, apparently to 
raise the State’s rural wage index to a 
level whereby all urban hospitals in the 
State would receive the rural floor. 
Medicare payments to CAHs are based 
on 101 percent of reasonable costs while 
the IPPS pays hospitals a fixed rate per 
discharge. In addition, as a CAH, a 
hospital is guaranteed to recover its 
costs, while an IPPS hospital is 
provided with incentives to increase 
efficiency to cover its costs. Thus, we 
stated that the identified CAHs were 
converting back to IPPS, even though 
the conversion would not directly 
benefit them. Because these hospitals’ 
wage levels are higher than most, if not 
all, of the urban hospitals in the State, 
the wage indices for most, if not all, of 
the State’s urban hospitals would 
increase as a result of the rural floor 
provision if the CAHs convert to IPPS 
status. In simulating the effect of the 
hospitals setting the State’s rural floor, 
we estimated that payment to hospitals 
in the State would increase in excess of 
$220 million in a single year. The 
MedPAC, in its June 2007 Report to the 
Congress stated, ‘‘The fact that the 
movement of one or two CAHs in or out 
of the [I]PPS system can increase (or 
decrease) Medicare payments by $220 
million suggests there is a flaw in the 
design of the wage index system.’’ (We 
refer readers to page 131 of the report.) 
For the above reasons, we are 
proposing to apply a State level rural 
floor budget neutrality adjustment to the 
wage index beginning in FY 2009. States 
that have no hospitals receiving a rural 
floor wage index would no longer have 
a negative budget neutrality adjustment 
applied to their wage indices. 
Conversely, hospitals in States with 
hospitals receiving a rural floor would

23623 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
have their wage indices downwardly 
adjusted to achieve budget neutrality 
within the State. All hospitals within 
each State would, in effect, be 
responsible for funding the rural floor 
adjustment applicable within that 
specific State. 
In the FY 2005 IPPS final rule and the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (69 FR 49109 and 72 FR 47321, 
respectively), we temporarily adopted 
an ‘‘imputed’’ floor measure to address 
a concern by some individuals that 
hospitals in all-urban States were 
disadvantaged by the absence of rural 
hospitals. Because no rural wage index 
could be calculated, no rural floor could 
be applied within such States. We 
originally limited application of the 
policy to FYs 2005 through 2007 and 
then extended it one additional year, 
through FY 2008. We are proposing to 
extend the imputed floor for 3 
additional years, through FY 2011, and 
to revise the introductory text of 
§ 412.64(h)(4) of our regulations to 
reflect this extension. For FY 2009, 26 
hospitals in New Jersey (33.8 percent) 
would receive the imputed floor. Rhode 
Island, the only other all-urban State, 
has no hospitals that would receive the 
imputed floor. In past years, we applied 
a national budget neutrality adjustment 
to the standardized amount to ensure 
that payments remained constant to 
payments that would have occurred in 
the absence of the imputed floor policy. 
As a result, payments to all other 
hospitals in the Nation were adjusted 
downward to subsidize the higher 
payments to New Jersey hospitals 
receiving the imputed floor. As the 
intent of the imputed floor is to create 
a protection to all-urban States similar 
to the protection offered to urban-rural 
mixed States by the rural floor, and the 
effect of the measure is also State- 
specific like the rural floor, we believe 
that the budget neutrality adjustments 
for the imputed floor and the rural floor 
should be applied in the same manner. 
Therefore, beginning with FY 2009, we 
are also proposing to apply the imputed 
floor budget neutrality adjustment to the 
wage index and at the State level. 
Based on our impact analysis of these 
proposals for FY 2009, of the 49 States 
(Maryland is excluded because it is 
under a State waiver), the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 39 would 
see either no change or an increase in 
total Medicare payments as a result of 
applying a budget neutrality adjustment 
to the wage index for the rural and 
imputed floors at the State level rather 
than the national level. The total 
payments of the remaining 12 States 
would decrease 0.1 percent to 3.4 
percent compared to continuing our 
prior national adjustment policy. The 
full impact analysis is reflected in the 
two charts presented earlier in this 
section III.B.2.b. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule. Tables 4D–1 and 4D–2 in 
the Addendum to this proposed rule 
reflect the proposed FY 2009 State level 
budget neutrality adjustments for the 
rural and imputed floors. We are 
specifically requesting public comments 
from national and State hospital 
associations regarding these proposals, 
particularly the national associations, as 
they represent member hospitals that 
are both positively and negatively 
affected by our proposed policies, and 
are, therefore, in the best position to 
comment on the policy merits of these 
proposals. We will view the absence of 
any comments from the national 
hospital associations as a sign that they 
do not object to our proposed policies. 
c. Within-State Budget Neutrality 
Adjustment for Geographic 
Reclassification 
Currently, section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the 
Act requires us to adjust the 
standardized amount to ensure that the 
effects of geographic reclassification do 
not increase aggregate IPPS payments. 
This means that, in the case of a 
reclassification, budget neutrality is 
achieved by reducing the standardized 
amount for all hospitals nationwide. 
The FY 2009 President’s Budget 
includes a legislative proposal to apply 
geographic reclassification budget 
neutrality at the State level (available at 
the Web site: www.hhs.gov/budget/ 
09budget/2009BudgetInBrief.pdf under 
FY 2009 Medicare Proposals, page 54). 
If this proposal is enacted by the 
Congress, budget neutrality would be 
achieved by adjusting the wage index 
for all hospitals within the State rather 
than reducing the standardized amount 
for all hospitals nationwide. 
As noted also in MedPAC’s June 2007 
Report to Congress, over the years, there 
have been many changes to the 
Medicare law that are intended to 
broaden the ability for a hospital to 
receive a wage index that is higher than 
the value that is calculated for its 
geographic area and not be subject to the 
proximity or wage level criteria for 
geographic reclassification established 
under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act. 
These more targeted geographic 
reclassification provisions are creating 
inequities in the wage index by 
sometimes allowing hospitals to be 
reclassified to areas where other 
hospitals that are closer in proximity are 
ineligible to reclassify. Applying budget 
neutrality at the State level would focus 
the costs of geographic reclassification 
closer to the areas where hospitals that 
benefit from the reclassification are 
located. We expect that a legislative 
provision on applying geographic 
reclassification budget neutrality at the 
State level would be applied to all 
reclassifications and wage index 
exceptions that are implemented 
through 42 CFR Part 412, Subpart L, and 
certain provisions of the Social Security 
Act that permit hospitals to receive a 
higher wage index than is calculated for 
their geographic area. (As discussed 
above, as a proposed regulatory matter, 
there also would be a separate within- 
State budget neutrality adjustment for 
the imputed and rural floors.) We expect 
that reclassification budget neutrality at 
the State level would operate through 
adjustments to the IPPS payments to 
hospitals in the State in which the 
reclassifying hospital is geographically 
located. 
We are seeking public comments 
regarding MedPAC’s recommendations 
for reforming the wage index, our plan 
for our contractor’s review of the wage 
index, and the regulatory proposals for 
modifying the current hospital wage 
index system. We also welcome 
additional suggestions for reforming the 
hospital wage index. 
C. Core-Based Statistical Areas for the 
Hospital Wage Index 
The wage index is calculated and 
assigned to hospitals on the basis of the 
labor market area in which the hospital 
is located. In accordance with the broad 
discretion under section 1886(d)(3)(E) of 
the Act, beginning with FY 2005, we 
define hospital labor market areas based 
on the Core-Based Statistical Areas 
(CBSAs) established by OMB and 
announced in December 2003 (69 FR 
49027). For a discussion of OMB’s 
revised definitions of CBSAs and our 
implementation of the CBSA 
definitions, we refer readers to the 
preamble of the FY 2005 IPPS final rule 
(69 FR 49026 through 49032). 
As with the FY 2008 final rule, for FY 
2009 we are proposing to provide that 
hospitals receive 100 percent of their 
wage index based upon the CBSA 
configurations. Specifically, for each 
hospital, we will determine a wage 
index for FY 2009 employing wage 
index data from FY 2005 hospital cost 
reports and using the CBSA labor 
market definitions. We consider CBSAs 
that are MSAs to be urban, and CBSAs 
that are Micropolitan Statistical Areas as 
well as areas outside of CBSAs to be 
rural. In addition, it has been our 
longstanding policy that where an MSA 
has been divided into Metropolitan 
Divisions, we consider the Metropolitan 
Division to comprise the labor market 
areas for purposes of calculating the

The OMB bulletin is available on the 
OMB Web site at https:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/OMB— go to 
‘‘Bulletins’’ or ‘‘Statistical Programs and 
Standards.’’ CMS will apply these 
changes to the IPPS beginning October 
1, 2008. 
D. Proposed Occupational Mix 
Adjustment to the Proposed FY 2009 
Wage Index 
As stated earlier, section 1886(d)(3)(E) 
of the Act provides for the collection of 
data every 3 years on the occupational 
mix of employees for each short-term, 
acute care hospital participating in the 
Medicare program, in order to construct 
an occupational mix adjustment to the 
wage index, for application beginning 
October 1, 2004 (the FY 2005 wage 
index). The purpose of the occupational 
mix adjustment is to control for the 
effect of hospitals’ employment choices 
on the wage index. For example, 
hospitals may choose to employ 
different combinations of registered 
nurses, licensed practical nurses, 
nursing aides, and medical assistants for 
the purpose of providing nursing care to 
their patients. The varying labor costs 
associated with these choices reflect 
hospital management decisions rather 
than geographic differences in the costs 
of labor. 
1. Development of Data for the Proposed 
FY 2009 Occupational Mix Adjustment 
On October 14, 2005, we published a 
notice in the Federal Register (70 FR 
60092) proposing to use a new survey, 
the 2006 Medicare Wage Index 
Occupational Mix Survey (the 2006 
survey) to apply an occupational mix 
adjustment to the FY 2008 wage index. 
In the proposed 2006 survey, we 
included several modifications based on 
the comments and recommendations we 
received on the 2003 survey, including 
(1) allowing hospitals to report their 
own average hourly wage rather than 
using BLS data; (2) extending the 
prospective survey period; and (3) 
reducing the number of occupational 
categories but refining the subcategories 
for registered nurses. 
We made the changes to the 
occupational categories in response to 
MedPAC comments to the FY 2005 IPPS 
final rule (69 FR 49036). Specifically, 
MedPAC recommended that CMS assess 
whether including subcategories of 
registered nurses would result in a more 
accurate occupational mix adjustment. 
MedPAC believed that including all 
registered nurses in a single category 
may obscure significant wage 
differences among the subcategories of 
registered nurses, for example, the 
wages of surgical registered nurses and 
floor registered nurses may differ. Also, 
to offset additional reporting burden for 
hospitals, MedPAC recommended that 
CMS should combine the general 
service categories that account for only 
a small percentage of a hospital’s total 
hours with the ‘‘all other occupations’’ 
category because most of the 
occupational mix adjustment is 
correlated with the nursing general 
service category. 
In addition, in response to the public 
comments on the October 14, 2005 
notice, we modified the 2006 survey. On 
February 10, 2006, we published a 
Federal Register notice (71 FR 7047) 
that solicited comments and announced 
our intent to seek OMB approval on the 
revised occupational mix survey (Form 
CMS–10079 (2006)). OMB approved the 
survey on April 25, 2006. 
The 2006 survey provides for the 
collection of hospital-specific wages and 
hours data, a 6-month prospective 
reporting period (that is, January 1, 
2006, through June 30, 2006), the 
transfer of each general service category 
that comprised less than 4 percent of 
total hospital employees in the 2003 
survey to the ‘‘all other occupations’’ 
category (the revised survey focuses 
only on the mix of nursing occupations), 
additional clarification of the 
definitions for the occupational 
categories, an expansion of the 
registered nurse category to include 
functional subcategories, and the 
exclusion of average hourly rate data 
associated with advance practice nurses. 
The 2006 survey included only two 
general occupational categories: nursing 
and ‘‘all other occupations.’’ The 
nursing category has four subcategories: 
Registered nurses, licensed practical 
nurses, aides, orderlies, attendants, and 
medical assistants. The registered nurse 
subcategory includes two functional 
subcategories: management personnel 
and staff nurses or clinicians. As 
indicated above, the 2006 survey 
provided for a 6-month data collection 
period, from January 1, 2006 through 
June 30, 2006. However, we allowed 
flexibility for the reporting period 
beginning and ending dates to 
accommodate some hospitals’ biweekly 
payroll and reporting systems. That is, 
the 6-month reporting period had to 
begin on or after December 25, 2005, 
and end before July 9, 2006. 
We are proposing to use the entire 6- 
month 2006 survey data to calculate the 
occupational mix adjustment for the FY 
2009 wage index. The original timelines 
for the collection, review, and 
correction of the 2006 occupational mix 
data were discussed in detail in the FY 
2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 48008). The 
revision and correction process for all of 
the data, including the 2006 
occupational mix survey data to be used 
for computing the FY 2009 wage index, 
is discussed in detail in section III.K. of 
the preamble of this proposed rule.

2. Calculation of the Proposed 
Occupational Mix Adjustment for FY 
2009 
For FY 2009 (as we did for FY 2008), 
we are proposing to calculate the 
occupational mix adjustment factor 
using the following steps: 
Step 1—For each hospital, determine 
the percentage of the total nursing 
category attributable to a nursing 
subcategory by dividing the nursing 
subcategory hours by the total nursing 
category’s hours (registered nurse 
management personnel and registered 
nurse staff nurses or clinicians are 
treated as separate nursing 
subcategories). Repeat this computation 
for each of the five nursing 
subcategories: registered nurse 
management personnel; registered nurse 
staff nurses or clinicians; licensed 
practical nurses; nursing aides, 
orderlies, and attendants; and medical 
assistants. 
Step 2—Determine a national average 
hourly rate for each nursing subcategory 
by dividing a subcategory’s total salaries 
for all hospitals in the occupational mix 
survey database by the subcategory’s 
total hours for all hospitals in the 
occupational mix survey database. 
Step 3—For each hospital, determine 
an adjusted average hourly rate for each 
nursing subcategory by multiplying the 
percentage of the total nursing category 
(from Step 1) by the national average 
hourly rate for that nursing subcategory 
(from Step 2). Repeat this calculation for 
each of the five nursing subcategories. 
Step 4—For each hospital, determine 
the adjusted average hourly rate for the 
total nursing category by summing the 
adjusted average hourly rate (from Step 
3) for each of the nursing subcategories. 
Step 5—Determine the national 
average hourly rate for the total nursing 
category by dividing total nursing 
category salaries for all hospitals in the 
occupational mix survey database by 
total nursing category hours for all 
hospitals in the occupational mix 
survey database. 
Step 6—For each hospital, compute 
the occupational mix adjustment factor 
for the total nursing category by 
dividing the national average hourly 
rate for the total nursing category (from 
Step 5) by the hospital’s adjusted 
average hourly rate for the total nursing 
category (from Step 4). 
If the hospital’s adjusted average 
hourly rate is less than the national 
average hourly rate (indicating the 
hospital employs a less costly mix of 
nursing employees), the occupational 
mix adjustment factor would be greater 
than 1.0000. If the hospital’s adjusted 
average hourly rate is greater than the 
national average hourly rate, the 
occupational mix adjustment factor 
would be less than 1.0000. 
Step 7—For each hospital, calculate 
the occupational mix adjusted salaries 
and wage-related costs for the total 
nursing category by multiplying the 
hospital’s total salaries and wage-related 
costs (from Step 5 of the unadjusted 
wage index calculation in section III.G. 
of this preamble) by the percentage of 
the hospital’s total workers attributable 
to the total nursing category (using the 
occupational mix survey data, this 
percentage is determined by dividing 
the hospital’s total nursing category 
salaries by the hospital’s total salaries 
for ‘‘nursing and all other’’) and by the 
total nursing category’s occupational 
mix adjustment factor (from Step 6 
above). 
The remaining portion of the 
hospital’s total salaries and wage-related 
costs that is attributable to all other 
employees of the hospital is not 
adjusted by the occupational mix. A 
hospital’s all other portion is 
determined by subtracting the hospital’s 
nursing category percentage from 100 
percent. 
Step 8—For each hospital, calculate 
the total occupational mix adjusted 
salaries and wage-related costs for a 
hospital by summing the occupational 
mix adjusted salaries and wage-related 
costs for the total nursing category (from 
Step 7) and the portion of the hospital’s 
salaries and wage-related costs for all 
other employees (from Step 7). 
To compute a hospital’s occupational 
mix adjusted average hourly wage, 
divide the hospital’s total occupational 
mix adjusted salaries and wage-related 
costs by the hospital’s total hours (from 
Step 4 of the unadjusted wage index 
calculation in section III.G. of this 
preamble). 
Step 9—To compute the occupational 
mix adjusted average hourly wage for an 
urban or rural area, sum the total 
occupational mix adjusted salaries and 
wage-related costs for all hospitals in 
the area, then sum the total hours for all 
hospitals in the area. Next, divide the 
area’s occupational mix adjusted 
salaries and wage-related costs by the 
area’s hours. 
Step 10—To compute the national 
occupational mix adjusted average 
hourly wage, sum the total occupational 
mix adjusted salaries and wage-related 
costs for all hospitals in the Nation, then 
sum the total hours for all hospitals in 
the Nation. Next, divide the national 
occupational mix adjusted salaries and 
wage-related costs by the national 
hours. The proposed FY 2009 
occupational mix adjusted national 
average hourly wage is $32.2252. 
Step 11—To compute the 
occupational mix adjusted wage index, 
divide each area’s occupational mix 
adjusted average hourly wage (Step 9) 
by the national occupational mix 
adjusted average hourly wage (Step 10). 
Step 12—To compute the Puerto Rico 
specific occupational mix adjusted wage 
index, follow Steps 1 through 11 above. 
The proposed FY 2009 occupational 
mix adjusted Puerto Rico specific 
average hourly wage is $13.7851. 
The table below is an illustrative 
example of the proposed occupational 
mix adjustment.

23628 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Because the occupational mix 
adjustment is required by statute, all 
hospitals that are subject to payments 
under the IPPS, or any hospital that 
would be subject to the IPPS if not 
granted a waiver, must complete the 
occupational mix survey, unless the 
hospital has no associated cost report 
wage data that are included in the 
proposed FY 2009 wage index. 
For the FY 2008 wage index, if a 
hospital did not respond to the 
occupational mix survey, or if we 
determined that a hospital’s submitted 
data were too erroneous to include in 
the wage index, we assigned the 
hospital the average occupational mix 
adjustment for the labor market area (72 
FR 47314). We believed this method had 
the least impact on the wage index for 
other hospitals in the area. For areas 
where no hospital submitted data for 
purposes of calculating the occupational 
mix adjustment, we applied the national 
occupational mix factor of 1.0000 in 
calculating the area’s FY 2008 
occupational mix adjusted wage index. 
We indicated in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule that we reserve the right to apply 
a different approach in future years, 
including potentially penalizing 
nonresponsive hospitals (72 FR 47314). 
For the FY 2009 wage index, we are 
proposing to handle the data for 
hospitals that did not respond to the 
occupational mix survey (neither the 1st 
quarter nor 2nd quarter data) in the 
same manner as discussed above for the 
FY 2008 wage index. In addition, if a 
hospital submits survey data for either 
the 1st quarter or 2nd quarter, but not 
for both quarters, we are proposing to 
use the data the hospital submitted for 
one quarter to calculate the hospital’s 
proposed FY 2009 occupational mix 
adjustment factor. Lastly, if a hospital 
submits a survey(s), but that survey data 
can not be used because we determine 
it to be aberrant, we will also assign the 
hospital the average occupational mix 
adjustment for its labor market area. For 
example, if a hospital’s individual nurse 
category average hourly wages are out of 
range (that is, unusually high or low), 
and the hospital does not provide 
sufficient documentation to explain the 
aberrancy, or the hospital does not 
submit any registered nurse staff salaries 
or hours data, we will assign the 
hospital the average occupational mix 
adjustment for the labor market area in 
which it is located. 
In calculating the average 
occupational mix adjustment factor for 
a labor market area, we replicated Steps 
1 through 6 of the calculation for the 
occupational mix adjustment. However, 
instead of performing these steps at the 
hospital level, we aggregated the data at 
the labor market area level. In following 
these steps, for example, for CBSAs that 
contain providers that did not submit 
occupational mix survey data, the 
occupational mix adjustment factor 
ranged from a low of 0.8968 (CBSA 
39820, Redding, CA), to a high of 1.0775 
(CBSA 43300, Sherman-Denison, TX). 
Also, in computing a hospital’s 
occupational mix adjusted salaries and 
wage-related costs for nursing 
employees (Step 7 of the calculation), in 
the absence of occupational mix survey 
data, we multiplied the hospital’s total 
salaries and wage-related costs by the 
percentage of the area’s total workers 
attributable to the area’s total nursing 
category. For FY 2009, there was one 
CBSA for which we did not have 
occupational mix data for any of its 
providers (CBSA 12020, Athens-Clark 
County, GA). In the absence of any data 
in this labor market area, we applied an 
occupational mix adjustment factor of 
1.0 to all provider(s). 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule, we 
also indicated that we would give 
serious consideration to applying a 
hospital-specific penalty if a hospital 
does not comply with regulations 
requiring submission of occupational 
mix survey data in future years. We 
stated that we believe that section 
1886(d)(5)(I)(i) of the Act provides us 
with the authority to penalize hospitals 
that do not submit occupational mix 
survey data. That section authorizes us 
to provide for exceptions and 
adjustments to the payment amounts 
under IPPS as the Secretary deems 
appropriate. We also indicated that we 
would address this issue in the FY 2008 
IPPS proposed rule. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule, 
we solicited comments and suggestions 
for a hospital-specific penalty for 
hospitals that do not submit 
occupational mix survey data. In 
response to the FY 2008 IPPS proposed 
rule, some commenters suggested a 1- 
percent to 2-percent reduction in the 
hospital’s wage index value or a set 
percentage of the standardized amount. 
We noted that any penalty that we 
would determine for nonresponsive 
hospitals would apply to a future wage 
index, not the FY 2008 wage index. 
In the FY 2008 final rule with 
comment period, we assigned 
nonresponsive hospitals the average 
occupational mix adjustment for the 
labor market area. For areas where no 
hospital submitted survey data, we 
applied the national occupational mix 
adjustment factor of 1.0000 in 
calculating the area’s FY 2008 
occupational mix adjusted wage index. 
We appreciate the suggestions we 
received regarding future penalties for 
hospitals that do not submit 
occupational mix survey data. We stated 
in the FY 2008 final rule with comment 
period that we may consider proposing 
a policy to penalize hospitals that do 
not submit occupational mix survey 
data for FY 2010, the first year of the 
application of the new 2007–2008 
occupational mix survey, and that we 
expected that any such penalty would 
be proposed in the FY 2009 IPPS 
proposed rule so hospitals would be 
aware of the policy before the deadline 
for submitting the data to the fiscal 
intermediaries/MAC. At this time, 
however, we are not proposing a penalty 
for FY 2010. Rather, we are reserving 
the right to propose a penalty in the FY 
2010 IPPS proposed rule, once we 
collect and analyze the FY 2007–2008 
occupational mix survey data. Hospitals 
are still on notice that any failure to 
submit occupational mix data for the FY 
2007–2008 survey year may result in a 
penalty in FY 2010, thus achieving our 
policy goal of ensuring that hospitals are 
aware of the consequences of failure to 
submit data in response to the most 
recent survey. 
3. 2007–2008 Occupational Mix Survey 
for the FY 2010 Wage Index 
As stated earlier, section 304(c) of 
Pub. L. 106–554 amended section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act to require CMS 
to collect data every 3 years on the 
occupational mix of employees for each 
short-term, acute care hospital 
participating in the Medicare program. 
We used occupational mix data 
collected on the 2006 survey to compute 
the proposed occupational mix 
adjustment for FY 2009. In the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47315), we discussed how we 
modified the occupational mix survey. 
The revised 2007–2008 occupational 
mix survey provides for the collection of 
hospital-specific wages and hours data 
for the 1-year period of July 1, 2007, 
through June 30, 2008, additional 
clarifications to the survey instructions, 
the elimination of the registered nurse 
subcategories, some refinements to the 
definitions of the occupational 
categories, and the inclusion of 
additional cost centers that typically 
provide nursing services. The revised 
2007–2008 occupational mix survey 
will be applied beginning with the FY 
2010 wage index. 
On February 2, 2007, we published in 
the Federal Register a notice soliciting 
comments on the proposed revisions to 
the occupational mix survey (72 FR 
5055). The comment period for the 
notice ended on April 3, 2007. After 
considering the comments we received, 
we made a few minor editorial changes

23629 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
and published the final 2007–2008 
occupational mix survey on September 
14, 2007 (72 FR 52568). OMB approved 
the survey without change on February 
1, 2008 (OMB Control Number 0938 
0907). The 2007–2008 Medicare 
occupational mix survey (Form CMS– 
10079 (2008)) is available on the CMS 
Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
AcuteInpatientPPS/WIFN/ 
list.asp#TopOfPage, and through the 
fiscal intermediaries/MAC. Hospitals 
must submit their completed surveys to 
their fiscal intermediaries/MAC by 
September 1, 2008. The preliminary, 
unaudited 2007–2008 occupational mix 
survey data will be released in early 
October 2008, along with the FY 2006 
Worksheet S–3 wage data, for the FY 
2010 wage index review and correction 
process. 
E. Worksheet S–3 Wage Data for the 
Proposed FY 2009 Wage Index 
The proposed FY 2009 wage index 
values (to be effective for hospital 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2008, and before October 1, 2009) in 
section II.B. of the Addendum to this 
proposed rule are based on the data 
collected from the Medicare cost reports 
submitted by hospitals for cost reporting 
periods beginning in FY 2005 (the FY 
2008 wage index was based on FY 2004 
wage data). 
1. Included Categories of Costs 
The proposed FY 2009 wage index 
includes the following categories of data 
associated with costs paid under the 
IPPS (as well as outpatient costs): 
• Salaries and hours from short-term, 
acute care hospitals (including paid 
lunch hours and hours associated with 
military leave and jury duty). 
• Home office costs and hours. 
• Certain contract labor costs and 
hours (which includes direct patient 
care, certain top management, 
pharmacy, laboratory, and nonteaching 
physician Part A services, and certain 
contract indirect patient care services 
(as discussed in the FY 2008 final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47315). 
• Wage-related costs, including 
pensions and other deferred 
compensation costs. We note that, on 
March 28, 2008, CMS published a 
technical clarification to the cost 
reporting instructions for pension and 
deferred compensation costs (sections 
2140 through 2142.7 of the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual, Part I). These 
instructions are used for developing 
pension and deferred compensation 
costs for purposes of the wage index, as 
discussed in the instructions for 
Worksheet S–3, Part II, Lines 13 through 
20 and in the FY 2006 final rule (70 FR 
47369). 
2. Excluded Categories of Costs 
Consistent with the wage index 
methodology for FY 2008, the proposed 
wage index for FY 2009 also excludes 
the direct and overhead salaries and 
hours for services not subject to IPPS 
payment, such as SNF services, home 
health services, costs related to GME 
(teaching physicians and residents) and 
certified registered nurse anesthetists 
(CRNAs), and other subprovider 
components that are not paid under the 
IPPS. The proposed FY 2009 wage index 
also excludes the salaries, hours, and 
wage-related costs of hospital-based 
rural health clinics (RHCs), and 
Federally qualified health centers 
(FQHCs) because Medicare pays for 
these costs outside of the IPPS (68 FR 
45395). In addition, salaries, hours, and 
wage-related costs of CAHs are excluded 
from the wage index, for the reasons 
explained in the FY 2004 IPPS final rule 
(68 FR 45397). 
3. Use of Wage Index Data by Providers 
Other Than Acute Care Hospitals Under 
the IPPS 
Data collected for the IPPS wage 
index are also currently used to 
calculate wage indices applicable to 
other providers, such as SNFs, home 
health agencies, and hospices. In 
addition, they are used for prospective 
payments to IRFs, IPFs, and LTCHs, and 
for hospital outpatient services. We note 
that, in the IPPS rules, we do not 
address comments pertaining to the 
wage indices for non-IPPS providers. 
Such comments should be made in 
response to separate proposed rules for 
those providers. 
F. Verification of Worksheet S–3 Wage 
Data 
The wage data for the proposed FY 
2009 wage index were obtained from 
Worksheet S–3, Parts II and III of the FY 
2005 Medicare cost reports. Instructions 
for completing Worksheet S–3, Parts II 
and III are in the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Part II, 
sections 3605.2 and 3605.3. The data 
file used to construct the proposed wage 
index includes FY 2005 data submitted 
to us as of February 29, 2008. As in past 
years, we performed an intensive review 
of the wage data, mostly through the use 
of edits designed to identify aberrant 
data. 
We asked our fiscal intermediaries/ 
MAC to revise or verify data elements 
that resulted in specific edit failures. 
For the proposed FY 2009 wage index, 
we identified and excluded 37 providers 
with data that was too aberrant to 
include in the proposed wage index, 
although if data elements for some of 
these providers are corrected, we intend 
to include some of these providers in 
the FY 2009 final wage index. We 
instructed fiscal intermediaries/MACs 
to complete their data verification of 
questionable data elements and to 
transmit any changes to the wage data 
no later than April 14, 2008. We believe 
all unresolved data elements will be 
resolved by the date the final rule is 
issued. The revised data will be 
reflected in the FY 2009 IPPS final rule. 
In constructing the proposed FY 2009 
wage index, we included the wage data 
for facilities that were IPPS hospitals in 
FY 2005; inclusive of those facilities 
that have since terminated their 
participation in the program as 
hospitals, as long as those data did not 
fail any of our edits for reasonableness. 
We believe that including the wage data 
for these hospitals is, in general, 
appropriate to reflect the economic 
conditions in the various labor market 
areas during the relevant past period 
and to ensure that the current wage 
index represents the labor market area’s 
current wages as compared to the 
national average of wages. However, we 
excluded the wage data for CAHs as 
discussed in the FY 2004 IPPS final rule 
(68 FR 45397). For this proposed rule, 
we removed 20 hospitals that converted 
to CAH status between February 16, 
2007, the cut-off date for CAH exclusion 
from the FY 2008 wage index, and 
February 18, 2008, the cut-off date for 
CAH exclusion from the FY 2009 wage 
index. After removing hospitals with 
aberrant data and hospitals that 
converted to CAH status, the proposed 
FY 2009 wage index is calculated based 
on 3,533 hospitals. 
1. Wage Data for Multicampus Hospitals 
In the FY 2008 final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47317), we 
discussed our policy for allocating a 
multicampus hospital’s wages and 
hours data, by full-time equivalent 
(FTE) staff, among the different labor 
market areas where its campuses are 
located. During the FY 2009 wage index 
desk review process, we requested fiscal 
intermediaries/MACs to contact 
multicampus hospitals that had 
campuses in different labor market areas 
to collect the data for the allocation. The 
proposed FY 2009 wage index in this 
proposed rule includes separate wage 
data for campuses of three multicampus 
hospitals. 
As with the FY 2008 wage index, we 
allowed hospitals the option of 
allocating their wages and hours for the 
FY 2009 wage index based on either 
FTE staff or discharge data. Again, we

are providing this option until a revised 
cost report is available that will allow a 
multicampus hospital to report the 
number of FTEs by location of its 
different campuses. Two of the three 
multicampus hospitals chose to have 
their wage data allocated by their 
Medicare discharge data. One of the 
hospitals provided FTE staff data for the 
allocation. The average hourly wage 
associated with each geographical 
location of a multicampus hospital is 
reflected in Table 2 of the Addendum to 
this proposed rule. 
2. New Orleans’ Post-Katrina Wage 
Index 
Since 2005 when Hurricane Katrina 
devastated the Gulf States, we have 
received numerous comments 
suggesting that current Medicare 
payments to hospitals in New Orleans, 
Louisiana are inadequate, and the wage 
index does not accurately reflect the 
increase in labor costs experienced by 
the city after the storm. The post-Katrina 
effects on the New Orleans wage index 
will not be realized in the wage index 
until FY 2010, when the wage index 
will be based on cost reporting periods 
beginning during FY 2006 (that is, 
beginning on or after October 1, 2005 
and before October 1, 2006). 
In responding to the health-related 
needs of people affected by the 
hurricane, the Federal Government, 
through the Deficit Reduction Act of 
2005 (DRA), appropriated $2 billion in 
FY 2006. These funds allowed the 
Secretary to make available $160 
million in February 2007 to Louisiana, 
Mississippi, and Alabama for payments 
to hospitals and skilled nursing 
facilities facing financial stress because 
of changing wage rates not yet reflected 
in Medicare payment methodologies. In 
March and May 2007, the Department 
provided two additional DRA grants of 
$15 million and $35 million, 
respectively, to Louisiana for 
professional health care workforce 
recruitment and sustainability in the 
greater New Orleans area, namely the 
Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard, and 
Plaquemines Parishes. In addition, the 
Department issued a supplemental 
award of $60 million in provider 
stabilization grant funding to Louisiana, 
Mississippi, and Alabama to continue to 
help health care providers meet 
changing wage rates not yet reflected by 
Medicare’s payment policies. On July 
23, 2007, HHS awarded to Louisiana a 
new $100 million Primary Care Grant to 
help increase access to primary care in 
the Greater New Orleans area. The 
resulting stabilization and expansion of 
the community based primary care 
infrastructure, post Katrina, helps 
provide a viable alternative to local 
hospital emergency rooms for all 
citizens of New Orleans, especially 
those who are poor and uninsured. In 
other Department efforts, the OIG has 
performed an in-depth review of the 
post-Katrina infrastructure of five New 
Orleans hospitals, including the 
hospitals’ staffing levels and wage costs. 
The OIG’s final reports and 
recommendations are scheduled to be 
published in Spring 2008. 
G. Method for Computing the Proposed 
FY 2009 Unadjusted Wage Index 
The method used to compute the 
proposed FY 2009 wage index without 
an occupational mix adjustment 
follows: 
Step 1—As noted above, we based the 
proposed FY 2009 wage index on wage 
data reported on the FY 2005 Medicare 
cost reports. We gathered data from each 
of the non-Federal, short-term, acute 
care hospitals for which data were 
reported on the Worksheet S–3, Parts II 
and III of the Medicare cost report for 
the hospital’s cost reporting period 
beginning on or after October 1, 2004, 
and before October 1, 2005. In addition, 
we included data from some hospitals 
that had cost reporting periods 
beginning before October 2004 and 
reported a cost reporting period 
covering all of FY 2004. These data are 
included because no other data from 
these hospitals would be available for 
the cost reporting period described 
above, and because particular labor 
market areas might be affected due to 
the omission of these hospitals. 
However, we generally describe these 
wage data as FY 2005 data. We note 
that, if a hospital had more than one 
cost reporting period beginning during 
FY 2005 (for example, a hospital had 
two short cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2004, 
and before October 1, 2005), we 
included wage data from only one of the 
cost reporting periods, the longer, in the 
wage index calculation. If there was 
more than one cost reporting period and 
the periods were equal in length, we 
included the wage data from the later 
period in the wage index calculation. 
Step 2—Salaries—The method used to 
compute a hospital’s average hourly 
wage excludes certain costs that are not 
paid under the IPPS. (We note that, 
beginning with FY 2008 (72 FR 47315), 
we include lines 22.01, 26.01, and 27.01 
of Worksheet S–3, Part II for overhead 
services in the wage index. However, we 
note that the wages and hours on these 
lines are not incorporated into line 101, 
column 1 of Worksheet A, which, 
through the electronic cost reporting 
software, flows directly to line 1 of 
Worksheet S–3, Part II. Therefore, the 
first step in the wage index calculation 
for FY 2009 is to compute a ‘‘revised’’ 
Line 1, by adding to the Line 1 on 
Worksheet S–3, Part II (for wages and 
hours respectively) the amounts on 
Lines 22.01, 26.01, and 27.01.) In 
calculating a hospital’s average salaries 
plus wage-related costs, we subtract 
from Line 1 (total salaries) the GME and 
CRNA costs reported on Lines 2, 4.01, 
6, and 6.01, the Part B salaries reported 
on Lines 3, 5 and 5.01, home office 
salaries reported on Line 7, and exclude 
salaries reported on Lines 8 and 8.01 
(that is, direct salaries attributable to 
SNF services, home health services, and 
other subprovider components not 
subject to the IPPS). We also subtract 
from Line 1 the salaries for which no 
hours were reported. To determine total 
salaries plus wage-related costs, we add 
to the net hospital salaries the costs of 
contract labor for direct patient care, 
certain top management, pharmacy, 
laboratory, and nonteaching physician 
Part A services (Lines 9 and 10), home 
office salaries and wage-related costs 
reported by the hospital on Lines 11 and 
12, and nonexcluded area wage-related 
costs (Lines 13, 14, and 18). 
We note that contract labor and home 
office salaries for which no 
corresponding hours are reported are 
not included. In addition, wage-related 
costs for nonteaching physician Part A 
employees (Line 18) are excluded if no 
corresponding salaries are reported for 
those employees on Line 4. 
Step 3—Hours—With the exception of 
wage-related costs, for which there are 
no associated hours, we compute total 
hours using the same methods as 
described for salaries in Step 2. 
Step 4—For each hospital reporting 
both total overhead salaries and total 
overhead hours greater than zero, we 
then allocate overhead costs to areas of 
the hospital excluded from the wage 
index calculation. First, we determine 
the ratio of excluded area hours (sum of 
Lines 8 and 8.01 of Worksheet S–3, Part 
II) to revised total hours (Line 1 minus 
the sum of Part II, Lines 2, 3, 4.01, 5, 
5.01, 6, 6.01, 7, and Part III, Line 13 of 
Worksheet S–3). We then compute the 
amounts of overhead salaries and hours 
to be allocated to excluded areas by 
multiplying the above ratio by the total 
overhead salaries and hours reported on 
Line 13 of Worksheet S–3, Part III. Next, 
we compute the amounts of overhead 
wage-related costs to be allocated to 
excluded areas using three steps: (1) We 
determine the ratio of overhead hours 
(Part III, Line 13 minus the sum of lines 
22.01, 26.01, and 27.01) to revised hours 
excluding the sum of lines 22.01, 26.01, 
and 27.01 (Line 1 minus the sum of

Lines 2, 3, 4.01, 5, 5.01, 6, 6.01, 7, 8, 
8.01, 22.01, 26.01, and 27.01). (We note 
that for the FY 2008 and subsequent 
wage index calculations, we are 
excluding the sum of lines 22.01, 26.01, 
and 27.01 from the determination of the 
ratio of overhead hours to revised hours, 
since hospitals typically do not provide 
fringe benefits (wage-related costs) to 
contract personnel. Therefore, it is not 
necessary for the wage index calculation 
to exclude overhead wage-related costs 
for contract personnel. Further, if a 
hospital does contribute to wage-related 
costs for contracted personnel, the 
instructions for lines 22.01, 26.01, and 
27.01 require that associated wage- 
related costs be combined with wages 
on the respective contract labor lines.); 
(2) we compute overhead wage-related 
costs by multiplying the overhead hours 
ratio by wage-related costs reported on 
Part II, Lines 13, 14, and 18; and (3) we 
multiply the computed overhead wage- 
related costs by the above excluded area 
hours ratio. Finally, we subtract the 
computed overhead salaries, wage- 
related costs, and hours associated with 
excluded areas from the total salaries 
(plus wage-related costs) and hours 
derived in Steps 2 and 3. 
Step 5—For each hospital, we adjust 
the total salaries plus wage-related costs 
to a common period to determine total 
adjusted salaries plus wage-related 
costs. To make the wage adjustment, we 
estimate the percentage change in the 
employment cost index (ECI) for 
compensation for each 30-day 
increment from October 14, 2003, 
through April 15, 2005, for private 
industry hospital workers from the BLS’ 
Compensation and Working Conditions. 
We use the ECI because it reflects the 
price increase associated with total 
compensation (salaries plus fringes) 
rather than just the increase in salaries. 
In addition, the ECI includes managers 
as well as other hospital workers. This 
methodology to compute the monthly 
update factors uses actual quarterly ECI 
data and assures that the update factors 
match the actual quarterly and annual 
percent changes. We also note that, 
since April 2006 with the publication of 
March 2006 data, the BLS’ ECI uses a 
different classification system, the North 
American Industrial Classification 
System (NAICS), instead of the Standard 
Industrial Codes (SICs), which no longer 
exist. We have consistently used the ECI 
as the data source for our wages and 
salaries and other price proxies in the 
IPPS market basket and are not 
proposing to make any changes to the 
usage at this time. The factors used to 
adjust the hospital’s data were based on 
the midpoint of the cost reporting 
period, as indicated below. 
MIDPOINT OF COST REPORTING PERIOD 
After Before Adjustment factor 
10/14/2004 ........ 11/15/2004 1.05390 
11/14/2004 ........ 12/15/2004 1.05035 
12/14/2004 ........ 01/15/2005 1.04690 
01/14/2005 ........ 02/15/2005 1.04342

06/14/2005 ........ 07/15/2005 1.02596 
07/14/2005 ........ 08/15/2005 1.02264 
08/14/2005 ........ 09/15/2005 1.01943 
09/14/2005 ........ 10/15/2005 1.01627 
10/14/2005 ........ 11/15/2005 1.01308 
11/14/2005 ........ 12/15/2005 1.00987 
12/14/2005 ........ 01/15/2006 1.00661 
01/14/2006 ........ 02/15/2006 1.00333 
02/14/2006 ........ 03/15/2006 1.00000 
03/14/2006 ........ 04/15/2006 0.99670 
For example, the midpoint of a cost 
reporting period beginning January 1, 
2005, and ending December 31, 2005, is 
June 30, 2005. An adjustment factor of 
1.02596 would be applied to the wages 
of a hospital with such a cost reporting 
period. In addition, for the data for any 
cost reporting period that began in FY 
2005 and covered a period of less than 
360 days or more than 370 days, we 
annualize the data to reflect a 1-year 
cost report. Dividing the data by the 
number of days in the cost report and 
then multiplying the results by 365 
accomplishes annualization. 
Step 6—Each hospital is assigned to 
its appropriate urban or rural labor 
market area before any reclassifications 
under section 1886(d)(8)(B), section 
1886(d)(8)(E), or section 1886(d)(10) of 
the Act. Within each urban or rural 
labor market area, we add the total 
adjusted salaries plus wage-related costs 
obtained in Step 5 for all hospitals in 
that area to determine the total adjusted 
salaries plus wage-related costs for the 
labor market area. 
Step 7—We divide the total adjusted 
salaries plus wage-related costs obtained 
under both methods in Step 6 by the 
sum of the corresponding total hours 
(from Step 4) for all hospitals in each 
labor market area to determine an 
average hourly wage for the area. 
Step 8—We add the total adjusted 
salaries plus wage-related costs obtained 
in Step5 for all hospitals in the Nation 
and then divide the sum by the national 
sum of total hours from Step 4 to arrive 
at a national average hourly wage. Using 
the data as described above, the 
proposed national average hourly wage 
(unadjusted for occupational mix) is 
$32.2489. 
Step 9—For each urban or rural labor 
market area, we calculate the hospital 
wage index value, unadjusted for 
occupational mix, by dividing the area 
average hourly wage obtained in Step 7 
by the national average hourly wage 
computed in Step 8. 
Step 10—Following the process set 
forth above, we develop a separate 
Puerto Rico-specific wage index for 
purposes of adjusting the Puerto Rico 
standardized amounts. (The national 
Puerto Rico standardized amount is 
adjusted by a wage index calculated for 
all Puerto Rico labor market areas based 
on the national average hourly wage as 
described above.) We add the total 
adjusted salaries plus wage-related costs 
(as calculated in Step 5) for all hospitals 
in Puerto Rico and divide the sum by 
the total hours for Puerto Rico (as 
calculated in Step 4) to arrive at an 
overall proposed average hourly wage 
(unadjusted for occupational mix) of 
$13.7956 for Puerto Rico. For each labor 
market area in Puerto Rico, we calculate 
the Puerto Rico-specific wage index 
value by dividing the area average 
hourly wage (as calculated in Step 7) by 
the overall Puerto Rico average hourly 
wage. 
Step 11—Section 4410 of Pub. L. 105– 
33 provides that, for discharges on or 
after October 1, 1997, the area wage 
index applicable to any hospital that is 
located in an urban area of a State may 
not be less than the area wage index 
applicable to hospitals located in rural 
areas in that State. For FY 2009, this 
proposed change would affect 266 
hospitals in 69 urban areas. The areas 
affected by this provision are identified 
by a footnote in Table 4A in the 
Addendum of this proposed rule. 
In the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 
49109), we adopted the ‘‘imputed’’ floor 
as a temporary 3-year measure to 
address a concern by some individuals 
that hospitals in all-urban States were 
disadvantaged by the absence of rural 
hospitals to set a wage index floor in 
those States. The imputed floor was 
originally set to expire in FY 2007, but 
we extended it an additional year in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72FR47321). As explained in 
section III.B.2.b. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we are proposing to 
extend the imputed floor for an 
additional 3 years, through FY 2011. 
H. Analysis and Implementation of the 
Proposed Occupational Mix Adjustment 
and the Proposed FY 2009 Occupational 
Mix Adjusted Wage Index 
As discussed in section III.D. of this 
preamble, for FY 2009, we are proposing 
to apply the occupational mix 
adjustment to 100 percent of the FY

2009 wage index. We calculated the 
occupational mix adjustment using data 
from the 2006 occupational mix survey 
data, using the methodology described 
in section III.D.3. of this preamble. 
Using the 1st and 2nd quarter 
occupational mix survey data and 
applying the occupational mix 
adjustment to 100 percent of the 
proposed FY2009 wage index results in 
a proposed national average hourly 
wage of $32.2252 and a proposed 
Puerto-Rico specific average hourly 
wage of $13.7851. After excluding data 
of hospitals that either submitted 
aberrant data that failed critical edits, or 
that do not have FY 2005 Worksheet S– 
3 cost report data for use in calculating 
the proposed FY2009 wage index, we 
calculated the proposed FY 2009 wage 
index using the occupational mix 
survey data from 3,364 hospitals. Using 
the Worksheet S–3 cost report data of 
3,533 hospitals and occupational mix 
1st and/or 2nd quarter survey data from 
3,364 hospitals represents a 95.2 percent 
survey response rate. The proposed 
FY2009 national average hourly wages 
for each occupational mix nursing 
subcategory as calculated in Step 2 of 
the occupational mix calculation are as 
follows: 
Occupational mix nursing sub-
category 
Average 
hourly wage 
National RN Management ........ $38.6341 
National RN Staff ...................... $33.4795 
National LPN ............................ $19.2316 
National Nurse Aides, Order-
lies, and Attendants .............. $13.6954 
National Medical Assistants ..... $15.7714 
National Nurse Category .......... $28.7291 
The proposed national average hourly 
wage for the entire nurse category as 
computed in Step 5 of the occupational 
mix calculation is $28.7291. Hospitals 
with a nurse category average hourly 
wage (as calculated in Step 4) of greater 
than the national nurse category average 
hourly wage receive an occupational 
mix adjustment factor (as calculated in 
Step 6) of less than 1.0. Hospitals with 
a nurse category average hourly wage (as 
calculated in Step 4) of less than the 
national nurse category average hourly 
wage receive an occupational mix 
adjustment factor (as calculated in Step 
6) of greater than 1.0. 
Based on the January through June 
2006 occupational mix survey data, we 
determined (in Step 7 of the 
occupational mix calculation) that the 
proposed national percentage of 
hospital employees in the Nurse 
category is 42.99 percent, and the 
proposed national percentage of 
hospital employees in the All Other 
Occupations category is 57.01 percent. 
At the CBSA level, the percentage of 
hospital employees in the Nurse 
category ranged from a low of 27.26 
percent in one CBSA, to a high of 85.30 
percent in another CBSA. 
The proposed wage index values for 
FY 2009 (except those for hospitals 
receiving wage index adjustments under 
section 1886(d)(13) of the Act) are 
shown in Tables 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4F in 
the Addendum to this proposed rule. 
Tables 3A and 3B in the Addendum 
to this proposed rule list the 3-year 
average hourly wage for each labor 
market area before the redesignation of 
hospitals based on FYs 2007, 2008, and 
2009 cost reporting periods. Table 3A 
lists these data for urban areas and 
Table 3B lists these data for rural areas. 
In addition, Table 2 in the Addendum 
to this proposed rule includes the 
adjusted average hourly wage for each 
hospital from the FY 2003 and FY 2004 
cost reporting periods, as well as the FY 
2005 period used to calculate the 
proposed FY 2009 wage index. The 3- 
year averages are calculated by dividing 
the sum of the dollars (adjusted to a 
common reporting period using the 
method described previously) across all 
3 years, by the sum of the hours. If a 
hospital is missing data for any of the 
previous years, its average hourly wage 
for the 3-year period is calculated based 
on the data available during that period. 
The proposed wage index values in 
Tables 2, 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4F and the 
average hourly wages in Tables 2, 3A, 
and 3B in the Addendum to this 
proposed rule include the proposed 
occupational mix adjustment. The 
proposed wage index values in Tables 2, 
4A, 4B, and 4C also include the 
proposed State-specific rural floor and 
imputed floor budget neutrality 
adjustments that are discussed in 
section III.B.2. of this preamble. The 
proposed State budget neutrality 
adjustments for the rural and imputed 
floors are included in Tables 4D–1 and 
4D–2 in the Addendum to this proposed 
rule. 
I. Proposed Revisions to the Wage Index 
Based on Hospital Redesignations 
1. General 
Under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act, 
the MGCRB considers applications by 
hospitals for geographic reclassification 
for purposes of payment under the IPPS. 
Hospitals must apply to the MGCRB to 
reclassify 13 months prior to the start of 
the fiscal year for which reclassification 
is sought (generally by September 1). 
Generally, hospitals must be proximate 
to the labor market area to which they 
are seeking reclassification and must 
demonstrate characteristics similar to 
hospitals located in that area. The 
MGCRB issues its decisions by the end 
of February for reclassifications that 
become effective for the following fiscal 
year (beginning October 1). The 
regulations applicable to 
reclassifications by the MGCRB are 
located in 42 CFR 412.230 through 
412.280. 
Section 1886(d)(10)(D)(v) of the Act 
provides that, beginning with FY 2001, 
a MGCRB decision on a hospital 
reclassification for purposes of the wage 
index is effective for 3 fiscal years, 
unless the hospital elects to terminate 
the reclassification. Section 
1886(d)(10)(D)(vi) of the Act provides 
that the MGCRB must use average 
hourly wage data from the 3 most 
recently published hospital wage 
surveys in evaluating a hospital’s 
reclassification application for FY 2003 
and any succeeding fiscal year. 
Section 304(b) of Pub. L. 106–554 
provides that the Secretary must 
establish a mechanism under which a 
statewide entity may apply to have all 
of the geographic areas in the State 
treated as a single geographic area for 
purposes of computing and applying a 
single wage index, for reclassifications 
beginning in FY 2003. The 
implementing regulations for this 
provision are located at 42 CFR 412.235. 
Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act 
requires the Secretary to treat a hospital 
located in a rural county adjacent to one 
or more urban areas as being located in 
the MSA to which the greatest number 
of workers in the county commute, if 
the rural county would otherwise be 
considered part of an urban area under 
the standards for designating MSAs and 
if the commuting rates used in 
determining outlying counties were 
determined on the basis of the aggregate 
number of resident workers who 
commute to (and, if applicable under 
the standards, from) the central county 
or counties of all contiguous MSAs. In 
light of the CBSA definitions and the 
Census 2000 data that we implemented 
for FY 2005 (69 FR 49027), we 
undertook to identify those counties 
meeting these criteria. Eligible counties 
are discussed and identified under 
section III.I.5. of this preamble. 
2. Effects of Reclassification/ 
Redesignation 
Section 1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act 
provides that the application of the 
wage index to redesignated hospitals is 
dependent on the hypothetical impact 
that the wage data from these hospitals 
would have on the wage index value for 
the area to which they have been 
redesignated. These requirements for 
determining the wage index values for

redesignated hospitals are applicable 
both to the hospitals deemed urban 
under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act 
and hospitals that were reclassified as a 
result of the MGCRB decisions under 
section 1886(d)(10) of the Act. 
Therefore, as provided in section 
1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act, the wage index 
values were determined by considering 
the following: 
• If including the wage data for the 
redesignated hospitals would reduce the 
wage index value for the area to which 
the hospitals are redesignated by 1 
percentage point or less, the area wage 
index value determined exclusive of the 
wage data for the redesignated hospitals 
applies to the redesignated hospitals. 
• If including the wage data for the 
redesignated hospitals reduces the wage 
index value for the area to which the 
hospitals are redesignated by more than 
1 percentage point, the area wage index 
determined inclusive of the wage data 
for the redesignated hospitals (the 
combined wage index value) applies to 
the redesignated hospitals. 
• If including the wage data for the 
redesignated hospitals increases the 
wage index value for the urban area to 
which the hospitals are redesignated, 
both the area and the redesignated 
hospitals receive the combined wage 
index value. Otherwise, the hospitals 
located in the urban area receive a wage 
index excluding the wage data of 
hospitals redesignated into the area. 
Rural areas whose wage index values 
would be reduced by excluding the 
wage data for hospitals that have been 
redesignated to another area continue to 
have their wage index values calculated 
as if no redesignation had occurred 
(otherwise, redesignated rural hospitals 
are excluded from the calculation of the 
rural wage index). The wage index value 
for a redesignated rural hospital cannot 
be reduced below the wage index value 
for the rural areas of the State in which 
the hospital is located. 
CMS has also adopted the following 
policies: 
• The wage data for a reclassified 
urban hospital is included in both the 
wage index calculation of the area to 
which the hospital is reclassified 
(subject to the rules described above) 
and the wage index calculation of the 
urban area where the hospital is 
physically located. 
• In cases where urban hospitals have 
reclassified to rural areas under 42 CFR 
412.103, the urban hospital wage data 
are: (a) Included in the rural wage index 
calculation, unless doing so would 
reduce the rural wage index; and (b) 
included in the urban area where the 
hospital is physically located. 
3. FY 2009 MGCRB Reclassifications 
Under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act, 
the MGCRB considers applications by 
hospitals for geographic reclassification 
for purposes of payment under the IPPS. 
The specific procedures and rules that 
apply to the geographic reclassification 
process are outlined in 42 CFR 412.230 
through 412.280. 
At the time this proposed rule was 
constructed, the MGCRB had completed 
its review of FY 2009 reclassification 
requests. There were 314 hospitals 
approved for wage index 
reclassifications by the MGCRB for FY 
2009. Because MGCRB wage index 
reclassifications are effective for 3 years, 
hospitals reclassified during FY 2007 or 
FY 2008 are eligible to continue to be 
reclassified based on prior 
reclassifications to current MSAs during 
FY 2009. There were 175 hospitals 
approved for wage index 
reclassifications in FY 2007 and 324 
hospitals approved for wage index 
reclassifications in FY 2008. Of all of 
the hospitals approved for 
reclassification for FY 2007, FY 2008, 
and FY 2009, 813 hospitals are in a 
reclassification status for FY 2009. 
Under 42 CFR 412.273, hospitals that 
have been reclassified by the MGCRB 
are permitted to withdraw their 
applications within 45 days of the 
publication of a proposed rule. The 
request for withdrawal of an application 
for reclassification or termination of an 
existing 3-year reclassification that 
would be effective in FY 2009 must be 
received by the MGCRB within 45 days 
of the publication of this proposed rule. 
If a hospital elects to withdraw its wage 
index application after the MGCRB has 
issued its decision, but within 45 days 
of publication of this proposed rule 
date, it may later cancel its withdrawal 
in a subsequent year and request the 
MGCRB to reinstate its wage index 
reclassification for the remaining fiscal 
year(s) of the 3-year period (42 CFR 
412.273(b)(2)(i)). The request to cancel a 
prior withdrawal or termination must be 
in writing to the MGCRB no later than 
the deadline for submitting 
reclassification applications for the 
following fiscal year (42 CFR 
412.273(d)). For further information 
about withdrawing, terminating, or 
canceling a previous withdrawal or 
termination of a 3-year reclassification 
for wage index purposes, we refer the 
reader to 42 CFR 412.273, as well as the 
August 1, 2002 IPPS final rule (67 FR 
50065), and the August 1, 2001 IPPS 
final rule (66 FR 39887). 
Changes to the wage index that result 
from withdrawals of requests for 
reclassification, wage index corrections, 
appeals, and the Administrator’s review 
process will be incorporated into the 
wage index values published in the FY 
2009 final rule. These changes may 
affect not only the wage index value for 
specific geographic areas, but also the 
wage index value redesignated hospitals 
receive; that is, whether they receive the 
wage index that includes the data for 
both the hospitals already in the area 
and the redesignated hospitals. Further, 
the wage index value for the area from 
which the hospitals are redesignated 
may be affected. 
Applications for FY 2010 
reclassifications are due to the MGCRB 
by September 2, 2008 (the first working 
day of September 2008). We note that 
this is also the deadline for canceling a 
previous wage index reclassification 
withdrawal or termination under 42 
CFR 412.273(d). Applications and other 
information about MGCRB 
reclassifications may be obtained, 
beginning in mid-July 2008, via the 
CMS Internet Web site at: http:// 
cms.hhs.gov/providers/prrb/
mgcinfo.asp, or by calling the MGCRB at 
(410) 786-1174. The mailing address of 
the MGCRB is: 2520 Lord Baltimore 
Drive, Suite L, Baltimore, MD 21244– 
2670. 
4. FY 2008 Policy Clarifications and 
Revisions 
We note below several policies related 
to geographic reclassification that were 
clarified or revised in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47333): 
• Reinstating Reclassifications—As 
provided for in 42 CFR 412.273(b)(2), 
once a hospital (or hospital group) 
accepts a newly approved 
reclassification, any previous 
reclassification is permanently 
terminated. 
• Geographic Reclassification for 
Multicampus Hospitals—Because 
campuses of a multicampus hospital can 
now have their wages and hours data 
allocated by FTEs or discharge data, a 
hospital campus located in a geographic 
area distinct from the geographic area 
associated with the provider number of 
the multicampus hospital will have 
official wage data to supplement an 
individual or group reclassification 
application (§ 412.230(d)(2)(v)). 
• New England Deemed Counties— 
Hospitals in New England deemed 
counties are treated the same as Lugar 
hospitals in calculating the wage index. 
That is, the area is considered rural, but 
the hospitals within the area are deemed 
to be urban (§ 412.64(b)(3)(ii)). 
• ‘‘Fallback’’ Reclassifications—A 
hospital will automatically be given its 
most recently approved reclassification

(thereby permanently terminating any 
previously approved reclassifications) 
unless it provides written notice to the 
MGCRB within 45 days of publication of 
the notice of proposed rulemaking that 
it wishes to withdraw its most recently 
approved reclassification and ‘‘fall 
back’’ to either its prior reclassification 
or its home area wage index for the 
following fiscal year. 
5. Redesignations of Hospitals Under 
Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act 
Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act 
requires us to treat a hospital located in 
a rural county adjacent to one or more 
urban areas as being located in the MSA 
if certain criteria are met. Effective 
beginning FY 2005, we use OMB’s 2000 
CBSA standards and the Census 2000 
data to identify counties in which 
hospitals qualify under section 
1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act to receive the 
wage index of the urban area. Hospitals 
located in these counties have been 
known as ‘‘Lugar’’ hospitals and the 
counties themselves are often referred to 
as ‘‘Lugar’’ counties. We provide the 
proposed FY 2009 chart below with the 
listing of the rural counties containing 
the hospitals designated as urban under 
section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act. For 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2008, hospitals located in the rural 
county in the first column of this chart 
will be redesignated for purposes of 
using the wage index of the urban area 
listed in the second column.

As in the past, hospitals redesignated 
under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act 
are also eligible to be reclassified to a 
different area by the MGCRB. Affected 
hospitals are permitted to compare the 
reclassified wage index for the labor 
market area in Table 4C in the 
Addendum to this proposed rule into 
which they have been reclassified by the 
MGCRB to the wage index for the area 
to which they are redesignated under 
section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act. 
Hospitals may withdraw from an 
MCGRB reclassification within 45 days 
of the publication of this proposed rule. 
6. Reclassifications Under Section 
1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act 
As discussed in last year’s FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47336–47337), Lugar hospitals are 
treated like reclassified hospitals for 
purposes of determining their 
applicable wage index and receive the 
reclassified wage index (Table 4C in the 
Addendum to this proposed rule) for the 
urban area to which they have been 
redesignated. Because Lugar hospitals 
are treated like reclassified hospitals, 
when they are seeking reclassification 
by the MCGRB, they are subject to the 
rural reclassification rules set forth at 42 
CFR 412.230. The procedural rules set 
forth at § 412.230 list the criteria that a 
hospital must meet in order to reclassify 
as a rural hospital. Lugar hospitals are 
subject to the proximity criteria and 
payment thresholds that apply to rural 
hospitals. Specifically, the hospital 
must be no more than 35 miles from the 
area to which it seeks reclassification 
(§ 412.230(b)(1)); and the hospital must 
show that its average hourly wage is at 
least 106 percent of the average hourly 
wage of all other hospitals in the area in 
which the hospital is located 
(§ 412.230(d)(1)(iii)(C)). Under current 
rules, the hospital must also 
demonstrate that its average hourly 
wage is equal to at least 82 percent of 
the average hourly wage of hospitals in 
the area to which it seeks redesignation 
(§ 412.230(d)(1)(iv)(C)). However, we are 
proposing to increase this threshold to 
86 percent (as discussed in section 
III.B.2.a. of this preamble). 
Hospitals not located in a Lugar 
County seeking reclassification to the 
urban area where the Lugar hospitals 
have been redesignated are not 
permitted to measure to the Lugar 
County to demonstrate proximity (no 
more than 15 miles for an urban

hospital, and no more than 35 miles for 
a rural hospital or the closest urban or 
rural area for RRCs or SCHs) in order to 
be reclassified to such urban area. These 
hospitals must measure to the urban 
area exclusive of the Lugar County to 
meet the proximity or nearest urban or 
rural area requirement. As discussed in 
the FY 2008 final rule with comment 
period, we treat New England deemed 
counties in a manner consistent with 
how we treat Lugar counties. (We refer 
readers to 72 FR 47337 for a discussion 
of this policy.) 
J. Proposed FY 2009 Wage Index 
Adjustment Based on Commuting 
Patterns of Hospital Employees 
In accordance with the broad 
discretion under section 1886(d)(13) of 
the Act, as added by section 505 of Pub. 
L. 108–173, beginning with FY 2005, we 
established a process to make 
adjustments to the hospital wage index 
based on commuting patterns of 
hospital employees (the ‘‘out-migration’’ 
adjustment). The process, outlined in 
the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 
49061), provides for an increase in the 
wage index for hospitals located in 
certain counties that have a relatively 
high percentage of hospital employees 
who reside in the county but work in a 
different county (or counties) with a 
higher wage index. Such adjustments to 
the wage index are effective for 3 years, 
unless a hospital requests to waive the 
application of the adjustment. A county 
will not lose its status as a qualifying 
county due to wage index changes 
during the 3-year period, and counties 
will receive the same wage index 
increase for those three years. However, 
a county that qualifies in any given year 
may no longer qualify after the 3-year 
period, or it may qualify but receive a 
different adjustment to the wage index 
level. Hospitals that receive this 
adjustment to their wage index are not 
eligible for reclassification under 
section 1886(d)(8) or section 1886(d)(10) 
of the Act. Adjustments under this 
provision are not subject to the budget 
neutrality requirements under section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act. 
Hospitals located in counties that 
qualify for the wage index adjustment 
are to receive an increase in the wage 
index that is equal to the average of the 
differences between the wage indices of 
the labor market area(s) with higher 
wage indices and the wage index of the 
resident county, weighted by the overall 
percentage of hospital workers residing 
in the qualifying county who are 
employed in any labor market area with 
a higher wage index. Beginning with the 
FY 2008 wage index, we use post- 
reclassified wage indices when 
determining the out-migration 
adjustment (72 FR 47339). 
For the proposed FY 2009 wage 
index, we calculated the out-migration 
adjustment using the same formula 
described in the FY 2005 IPPS final rule 
(69 FR 49064), with the addition of 
using the post-reclassified wage indices, 
to calculate the out-migration 
adjustment. This adjustment is 
calculated as follows: 
Step 1. Subtract the wage index for 
the qualifying county from the wage 
index of each of the higher wage area(s) 
to which hospital workers commute. 
Step 2. Divide the number of hospital 
employees residing in the qualifying 
county who are employed in such 
higher wage index area by the total 
number of hospital employees residing 
in the qualifying county who are 
employed in any higher wage index 
area. For each of the higher wage index 
areas, multiply this result by the result 
obtained in Step 1. 
Step 3. Sum the products resulting 
from Step 2 (if the qualifying county has 
workers commuting to more than one 
higher wage index area). 
Step 4. Multiply the result from Step 
3 by the percentage of hospital 
employees who are residing in the 
qualifying county and who are 
employed in any higher wage index 
area. 
These adjustments will be effective 
for each county for a period of 3 fiscal 
years. For example, hospitals that 
received the adjustment for the first 
time in FY 2008 will be eligible to retain 
the adjustment for FY 2009. For 
hospitals in newly qualified counties, 
adjustments to the wage index are 
effective for 3 years, beginning with 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2008. 
Hospitals receiving the wage index 
adjustment under section 1886(d)(13)(F) 
of the Act are not eligible for 
reclassification under sections 
1886(d)(8) or (d)(10) of the Act unless 
they waive the out-migration 
adjustment. Consistent with our FY 
2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 IPPS final 
rules, we are proposing that hospitals 
redesignated under section 1886(d)(8) of 
the Act or reclassified under section 
1886(d)(10) of the Act will be deemed 
to have chosen to retain their 
redesignation or reclassification. Section 
1886(d)(10) hospitals that wish to 
receive the out-migration adjustment, 
rather than their reclassification, should 
follow the termination/withdrawal 
procedures specified in 42 CFR 412.273 
and section III.I.3. of the preamble of 
this proposed rule. Otherwise, they will 
be deemed to have waived the out- 
migration adjustment. Hospitals 
redesignated under section 1886(d)(8) of 
the Act will be deemed to have waived 
the out-migration adjustment, unless 
they explicitly notify CMS within 45 
days from the publication of this 
proposed rule that they elect to receive 
the out-migration adjustment instead. 
These notifications should be sent to the 
following address: Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services, Center for 
Medicare Management, Attention: Wage 
Index Adjustment Waivers, Division of 
Acute Care, Room C4–08–06, 7500 
Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 
21244–1850. 
Table 4J in the Addendum to this 
proposed rule lists the proposed out- 
migration wage index adjustments for 
FY 2009. Hospitals that are not 
otherwise reclassified or redesignated 
under section 1886(d)(8) or section 
1886(d)(10) of the Act will 
automatically receive the listed 
adjustment. In accordance with the 
procedures discussed above, 
redesignated/reclassified hospitals 
would be deemed to have waived the 
out-migration adjustment unless CMS is 
otherwise notified. Hospitals that are 
eligible to receive the out-migration 
wage index adjustment and that 
withdraw their application for 
reclassification would automatically 
receive the wage index adjustment 
listed in Table 4J in the Addendum to 
this proposed rule. 
K. Process for Requests for Wage Index 
Data Corrections 
The preliminary, unaudited 
Worksheet S–3 wage data and 
occupational mix survey data files for 
the FY 2009 wage index were made 
available on October 5, 2007, through 
the Internet on the CMS Web site at: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
AcuteInpatientPPS/WIFN/ 
list.asp#TopOfPage. 
In the interest of meeting the data 
needs of the public, beginning with the 
proposed FY 2009 wage index, we 
posted an additional public use file on 
our Web site that reflects the actual data 
that are used in computing the proposed 
wage index. The release of this new file 
does not alter the current wage index 
process or schedule. We notified the 
hospital community of the availability 
of these data as we do with the current 
public use wage data files through our 
Hospital Open Door forum. We 
encourage hospitals to sign up for 
automatic notifications of information 
about hospital issues and the scheduling 
of the Hospital Open Door forums at: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
OpenDoorForums/. 
In a memorandum dated October 5, 
2007, we instructed all fiscal

intermediaries/MACs to inform the IPPS 
hospitals they service of the availability 
of the wage index data files and the 
process and timeframe for requesting 
revisions (including the specific 
deadlines listed below). We also 
instructed the fiscal intermediaries/ 
MACs to advise hospitals that these data 
were also made available directly 
through their representative hospital 
organizations. 
If a hospital wished to request a 
change to its data as shown in the 
October 5, 2007 wage and occupational 
mix data files, the hospital was to 
submit corrections along with complete, 
detailed supporting documentation to 
its fiscal intermediary/MAC by 
December 7, 2007. Hospitals were 
notified of this deadline and of all other 
possible deadlines and requirements, 
including the requirement to review and 
verify their data as posted on the 
preliminary wage index data files on the 
Internet, through the October 5, 2007 
memorandum referenced above. 
In the October 5, 2007 memorandum, 
we also specified that a hospital 
requesting revisions to its 1st and/or 
2nd quarter occupational mix survey 
data was to copy its record(s) from the 
CY 2006 occupational mix preliminary 
files posted to our Web site in October, 
highlight the revised cells on its 
spreadsheet, and submit its 
spreadsheet(s) and complete 
documentation to its fiscal 
intermediary/MAC no later than 
December 7, 2007. 
The fiscal intermediaries (or, if 
applicable, the MACs) notified the 
hospitals by mid-February 2008 of any 
changes to the wage index data as a 
result of the desk reviews and the 
resolution of the hospitals’ early- 
December revision requests. The fiscal 
intermediaries/MACs also submitted the 
revised data to CMS by mid-February 
2008. CMS published the proposed 
wage index public use files that 
included hospitals’ revised wage index 
data on February 25, 2008. In a 
memorandum also dated February 25, 
2008, we instructed fiscal 
intermediaries/MACs to notify all 
hospitals regarding the availability of 
the proposed wage index public use 
files and the criteria and process for 
requesting corrections and revisions to 
the wage index data. Hospitals had until 
March 11, 2008 to submit requests to the 
fiscal intermediaries/MACs for 
reconsideration of adjustments made by 
the fiscal intermediaries/MACs as a 
result of the desk review, and to correct 
errors due to CMS’s or the fiscal 
intermediary’s (or, if applicable, the 
MAC’s) mishandling of the wage index 
data. Hospitals were also required to 
submit sufficient documentation to 
support their requests. 
After reviewing requested changes 
submitted by hospitals, fiscal 
intermediaries/MACs are to transmit 
any additional revisions resulting from 
the hospitals’ reconsideration requests 
by April 14, 2008. The deadline for a 
hospital to request CMS intervention in 
cases where the hospital disagreed with 
the fiscal intermediary’s (or, if 
applicable, the MAC’s) policy 
interpretations is April 21, 2008. 
Hospitals should also examine Table 
2 in the Addendum to this proposed 
rule. Table 2 in the Addendum to this 
proposed rule contains each hospital’s 
adjusted average hourly wage used to 
construct the wage index values for the 
past 3 years, including the FY 2005 data 
used to construct the proposed FY 2009 
wage index. We note that the hospital 
average hourly wages shown in Table 2 
only reflect changes made to a hospital’s 
data and transmitted to CMS by 
February 29, 2008. 
We will release the final wage index 
data public use files in early May 2008 
on the Internet at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/AcuteInpatientPPS/ 
WIFN/list.asp#TopOfPage. The May 
2008 public use files will be made 
available solely for the limited purpose 
of identifying any potential errors made 
by CMS or the fiscal intermediary/MAC 
in the entry of the final wage index data 
that result from the correction process 
described above (revisions submitted to 
CMS by the fiscal intermediaries/MACs 
by April 14, 2008). If, after reviewing 
the May 2008 final files, a hospital 
believes that its wage or occupational 
mix data are incorrect due to a fiscal 
intermediary or MAC or CMS error in 
the entry or tabulation of the final data, 
the hospital should send a letter to both 
its fiscal intermediary or MAC and CMS 
that outlines why the hospital believes 
an error exists and to provide all 
supporting information, including 
relevant dates (for example, when it first 
became aware of the error). CMS and the 
fiscal intermediaries (or, if applicable, 
the MACs) must receive these requests 
no later than June 9, 2008. Requests 
mailed to CMS should be sent to: 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services, Center for Medicare 
Management, Attention: Wage Index 
Team, Division of Acute Care, C4–08– 
06, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, 
MD 21244–1850. 
Each request also must be sent to the 
fiscal intermediary or the MAC. The 
fiscal intermediary or the MAC will 
review requests upon receipt and 
contact CMS immediately to discuss its 
findings. 
At this point in the process, that is, 
after the release of the May 2008 wage 
index data files, changes to the wage 
and occupational mix data will only be 
made in those very limited situations 
involving an error by the fiscal 
intermediary or the MAC or CMS that 
the hospital could not have known 
about before its review of the final wage 
index data files. Specifically, neither the 
fiscal intermediary or the MAC nor CMS 
will approve the following types of 
requests: 
• Requests for wage index data 
corrections that were submitted too late 
to be included in the data transmitted to 
CMS by fiscal intermediaries or the 
MACs on or before April 21, 2008. 
• Requests for correction of errors 
that were not, but could have been, 
identified during the hospital’s review 
of the February 25, 2008 wage index 
public use files. 
• Requests to revisit factual 
determinations or policy interpretations 
made by the fiscal intermediary or the 
MAC or CMS during the wage index 
data correction process. 
Verified corrections to the wage index 
data received timely by CMS and the 
fiscal intermediaries or the MACs (that 
is, by June 9, 2008) will be incorporated 
into the final wage index in the FY 2009 
IPPS final rule, which will be effective 
October 1, 2008. 
We created the processes described 
above to resolve all substantive wage 
index data correction disputes before we 
finalize the wage and occupational mix 
data for the FY 2009 payment rates. 
Accordingly, hospitals that do not meet 
the procedural deadlines set forth above 
will not be afforded a later opportunity 
to submit wage index data corrections or 
to dispute the fiscal intermediary’s (or, 
if applicable the MAC’s) decision with 
respect to requested changes. 
Specifically, our policy is that hospitals 
that do not meet the procedural 
deadlines set forth above will not be 
permitted to challenge later, before the 
Provider Reimbursement Review Board, 
the failure of CMS to make a requested 
data revision. (See W. A. Foote 
Memorial Hospital v. Shalala, No. 99– 
CV–75202–DT (E.D. Mich. 2001) and 
Palisades General Hospital v. 
Thompson, No. 99–1230 (D.D.C. 2003).) 
We refer the reader also to the FY 2000 
final rule (64 FR 41513) for a discussion 
of the parameters for appealing to the 
PRRB for wage index data corrections. 
Again, we believe the wage index data 
correction process described above 
provides hospitals with sufficient 
opportunity to bring errors in their wage 
and occupational mix data to the fiscal 
intermediary’s (or, if applicable, the 
MAC’s) attention. Moreover, because

hospitals will have access to the final 
wage index data by early May 2008, 
they have the opportunity to detect any 
data entry or tabulation errors made by 
the fiscal intermediary or the MAC or 
CMS before the development and 
publication of the final FY 2009 wage 
index by August 1, 2008, and the 
implementation of the FY 2009 wage 
index on October 1, 2008. If hospitals 
availed themselves of the opportunities 
afforded to provide and make 
corrections to the wage and 
occupational mix data, the wage index 
implemented on October 1 should be 
accurate. Nevertheless, in the event that 
errors are identified by hospitals and 
brought to our attention after June 9, 
2008, we retain the right to make 
midyear changes to the wage index 
under very limited circumstances. 
Specifically, in accordance with 42 
CFR 412.64(k)(1) of our existing 
regulations, we make midyear 
corrections to the wage index for an area 
only if a hospital can show that: (1) The 
fiscal intermediary or the MAC or CMS 
made an error in tabulating its data; and 
(2) the requesting hospital could not 
have known about the error or did not 
have an opportunity to correct the error, 
before the beginning of the fiscal year. 
For purposes of this provision, ‘‘before 
the beginning of the fiscal year’’ means 
by the June deadline for making 
corrections to the wage data for the 
following fiscal year’s wage index. This 
provision is not available to a hospital 
seeking to revise another hospital’s data 
that may be affecting the requesting 
hospital’s wage index for the labor 
market area. As indicated earlier, since 
CMS makes the wage index data 
available to hospitals on the CMS Web 
site prior to publishing both the 
proposed and final IPPS rules, and the 
fiscal intermediaries or the MAC notify 
hospitals directly of any wage index 
data changes after completing their desk 
reviews, we do not expect that midyear 
corrections will be necessary. However, 
under our current policy, if the 
correction of a data error changes the 
wage index value for an area, the 
revised wage index value will be 
effective prospectively from the date the 
correction is made. 
In the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 FR 
47385), we revised 42 CFR 412.64(k)(2) 
to specify that, effective on October 1, 
2005, that is beginning with the FY 2006 
wage index, a change to the wage index 
can be made retroactive to the beginning 
of the Federal fiscal year only when: (1) 
The fiscal intermediary (or, if 
applicable, the MAC) or CMS made an 
error in tabulating data used for the 
wage index calculation; (2) the hospital 
knew about the error and requested that 
the fiscal intermediary (or if applicable 
the MAC) and CMS correct the error 
using the established process and 
within the established schedule for 
requesting corrections to the wage index 
data, before the beginning of the fiscal 
year for the applicable IPPS update (that 
is, by the June 9, 2008 deadline for the 
FY 2009 wage index); and (3) CMS 
agreed that the fiscal intermediary (or if 
applicable, the MAC) or CMS made an 
error in tabulating the hospital’s wage 
index data and the wage index should 
be corrected. 
In those circumstances where a 
hospital requested a correction to its 
wage index data before CMS calculates 
the final wage index (that is, by the June 
deadline), and CMS acknowledges that 
the error in the hospital’s wage index 
data was caused by CMS’s or the fiscal 
intermediary’s (or, if applicable, the 
MAC’s) mishandling of the data, we 
believe that the hospital should not be 
penalized by our delay in publishing or 
implementing the correction. As with 
our current policy, we indicated that the 
provision is not available to a hospital 
seeking to revise another hospital’s data. 
In addition, the provision cannot be 
used to correct prior years’ wage index 
data; it can only be used for the current 
Federal fiscal year. In other situations 
where our policies would allow midyear 
corrections, we continue to believe that 
it is appropriate to make prospective- 
only corrections to the wage index. 
We note that, as with prospective 
changes to the wage index, the final 
retroactive correction will be made 
irrespective of whether the change 
increases or decreases a hospital’s 
payment rate. In addition, we note that 
the policy of retroactive adjustment will 
still apply in those instances where a 
judicial decision reverses a CMS denial 
of a hospital’s wage index data revision 
request. 
L. Labor-Related Share for the Proposed 
Wage Index for FY 2009 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act 
directs the Secretary to adjust the 
proportion of the national prospective 
payment system base payment rates that 
are attributable to wages and wage- 
related costs by a factor that reflects the 
relative differences in labor costs among 
geographic areas. It also directs the 
Secretary to estimate from time to time 
the proportion of hospital costs that are 
labor-related: ‘‘The Secretary shall 
adjust the proportion (as estimated by 
the Secretary from time to time) of 
hospitals’ costs which are attributable to 
wages and wage-related costs of the 
DRG prospective payment rates * * *’’ 
We refer to the portion of hospital costs 
attributable to wages and wage-related 
costs as the labor-related share. The 
labor-related share of the prospective 
payment rate is adjusted by an index of 
relative labor costs, which is referred to 
as the wage index. 
Section 403 of Pub. L. 108–173 
amended section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the 
Act to provide that the Secretary must 
employ 62 percent as the labor-related 
share unless this ‘‘would result in lower 
payments to a hospital than would 
otherwise be made.’’ However, this 
provision of Pub. L. 108–173 did not 
change the legal requirement that the 
Secretary estimate ‘‘from time to time’’ 
the proportion of hospitals costs that are 
‘‘attributable to wages and wage-related 
costs.’’ We interpret this to mean that 
hospitals receive payment based on 
either a 62-percent labor-related share, 
or the labor-related share estimated from 
time to time by the Secretary, depending 
on which labor-related share resulted in 
a higher payment. 
We have continued our research into 
the assumptions employed in 
calculating the labor-related share. Our 
research involves analyzing the 
compensation share separately for urban 
and rural hospitals, using regression 
analysis to determine the proportion of 
costs influenced by the area wage index, 
and exploring alternative methodologies 
to determine whether all or only a 
portion of professional fees and 
nonlabor intensive services should be 
considered labor-related. 
In the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 FR 
47392), we presented our analysis and 
conclusions regarding the methodology 
for updating the labor-related share for 
FY 2006. We also recalculated a labor- 
related share of 69.731 percent, using 
the FY 2002-based PPS market basket 
for discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 2005. In addition, we 
implemented this revised and rebased 
labor-related share in a budget neutral 
manner, but consistent with section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act, we did not take 
into account the additional payments 
that would be made as a result of 
hospitals with a wage index less than or 
equal to 1.0 being paid using a labor- 
related share lower than the labor- 
related share of hospitals with a wage 
index greater than 1.0. 
The labor-related share is used to 
determine the proportion of the national 
PPS base payment rate to which the area 
wage index is applied. In this proposed 
rule, we are not proposing to make any 
changes to the national average 
proportion of operating costs that are 
attributable to wages and salaries, fringe 
benefits, professional fees, contract 
labor, and labor intensive services. 
Therefore, we are proposing to continue 
to use a labor-related share of 69.731

percent for discharges occurring on or 
after October 1, 2008. Tables 1A and 1B 
in the Addendum to this proposed rule 
reflect this proposed labor-related share. 
We note that section 403 of Pub. L. 108– 
173 amended sections 1886(d)(3)(E) and 
1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act to provide 
that the Secretary must employ 62 
percent as the labor-related share unless 
this employment ‘‘would result in lower 
payments to a hospital than would 
otherwise be made.’’ 
We also are proposing to continue to 
use a labor-related share for the Puerto 
Rico-specific standardized amounts of 
58.7 percent for discharges occurring on 
or after October 1, 2008. Consistent with 
our methodology for determining the 
national labor-related share, we added 
the Puerto Rico-specific relative weights 
for wages and salaries, fringe benefits, 
contract labor, nonmedical professional 
fees, and other labor-intensive services 
to determine the labor-related share. 
Puerto Rico hospitals are paid based on 
75 percent of the national standardized 
amounts and 25 percent of the Puerto 
Rico-specific standardized amounts. For 
Puerto Rico hospitals, the national 
labor-related share will always be 62 
percent because the wage index for all 
Puerto Rico hospitals is less than 1.0. A 
Puerto Rico-specific wage index is 
applied to the Puerto Rico-specific 
portion of payments to the hospitals. 
The labor-related share of a hospital’s 
Puerto Rico-specific rate will be either 
62 percent or the Puerto Rico-specific 
labor-related share depending on which 
results in higher payments to the 
hospital. If the hospital has a Puerto 
Rico-specific wage index of greater than 
1.0, we will set the hospital’s rates using 
a labor-related share of 62 percent for 
the 25 percent portion of the hospital’s 
payment determined by the Puerto Rico 
standardized amounts because this 
amount will result in higher payments. 
Conversely, a hospital with a Puerto 
Rico-specific wage index of less than 1.0 
will be paid using the Puerto Rico- 
specific labor-related share of 58.7 
percent of the Puerto Rico-specific rates 
because the lower labor-related share 
will result in higher payments. The 
proposed Puerto Rico labor-related 
share of 58.7 percent for FY 2008 is 
reflected in the Table 1C of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. 
IV. Other Decisions and Proposed 
Changes to the IPPS for Operating Costs 
and GME Costs 
A. Proposed Changes to the Postacute 
Care Transfer Policy (§ 412.4) 
1. Background 
Existing regulations at § 412.4(a) 
define discharges under the IPPS as 
situations in which a patient is formally 
released from an acute care hospital or 
dies in the hospital. Section 412.4(b) 
defines transfers from one acute care 
hospital to another. Section 412.4(c) 
establishes the conditions under which 
we consider a discharge to be a transfer 
for purposes of our postacute care 
transfer policy. In transfer situations, 
the transferring hospital is paid based 
on a per diem rate for each day of the 
stay, not to exceed the full MS–DRG 
payment that would have been made if 
the patient had been discharged without 
being transferred. 
The per diem rate paid to a 
transferring hospital is calculated by 
dividing the full MS–DRG payment by 
the geometric mean length of stay for 
the MS–DRG. Based on an analysis that 
showed that the first day of 
hospitalization is the most expensive 
(60 FR 5804), our policy generally 
provides for payment that is double the 
per diem amount for the first day, with 
each subsequent day paid at the per 
diem amount up to the full DRG 
payment (§ 412.4(f)(1)). Transfer cases 
are also eligible for outlier payments. 
The outlier threshold for transfer cases 
is equal to the fixed-loss outlier 
threshold for nontransfer cases (adjusted 
for geographic variations in costs), 
divided by the geometric mean length of 
stay for the MS–DRG, multiplied by the 
length of stay for the case plus one day. 
The purpose of the IPPS postacute care 
transfer payment policy is to avoid 
providing an incentive for a hospital to 
transfer patients to another hospital, a 
SNF, or home under a written plan of 
care for home health services early in 
the patients’’ stay in order to minimize 
costs while still receiving the full MS– 
DRG payment. The transfer policy 
adjusts the payments to approximate the 
reduced costs of transfer cases. 
Beginning with the FY 2006 IPPS, the 
regulations at § 412.4 specified that, 
effective October 1, 2005, a DRG would 
be subject to the postacute care transfer 
policy if, based on Version 23.0 of the 
DRG Definitions Manual (FY 2006), 
using data from the March 2005 update 
of FY 2004 MedPAR file, the DRG meets 
the following criteria: 
• The DRG had a geometric mean 
length of stay of at least 3 days; 
• The DRG had at least 2,050 
postacute care transfer cases; and 
• At least 5.5 percent of the cases in 
the DRG were discharged to postacute 
care prior to the geometric mean length 
of stay for the DRG. 
In addition, if the DRG was one of a 
paired set of DRGs based on the 
presence or absence of a CC or major 
cardiovascular condition (MCV), both 
paired DRGs would be included if either 
one met the three criteria above. 
If a DRG met the above criteria based 
on the Version 23.0 DRG Definitions 
Manual and FY 2004 MedPAR data, we 
made the DRG subject to the postacute 
care transfer policy. We noted in the FY 
2006 final rule that we would not revise 
the list of DRGs subject to the postacute 
care transfer policy annually unless we 
made a change to a specific CMS DRG. 
We established this policy to promote 
certainty and stability in the postacute 
care transfer payment policy. Annual 
reviews of the list of CMS DRGs subject 
to the policy would likely lead to great 
volatility in the payment methodology 
with certain DRGs qualifying for the 
policy in one year, deleted the next 
year, only to be reinstated the following 
year. However, we noted that, over time, 
as treatment practices change, it was 
possible that some CMS DRGs that 
qualified for the policy will no longer be 
discharged with great frequency to 
postacute care. Similarly, we explained 
that there may be other CMS DRGs that 
at that time had a low rate of discharges 
to postacute care, but which might have 
very high rates in the future. 
The regulations at § 412.4 further 
specify that if a DRG did not exist in 
Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions 
Manual or a DRG included in Version 
23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual is 
revised, the DRG will be a qualifying 
DRG if it meets the following criteria 
based on the version of the DRG 
Definitions Manual in use when the 
new or revised DRG first became 
effective, using the most recent 
complete year of MedPAR data: 
• The total number of discharges to 
postacute care in the DRG must equal or 
exceed the 55th percentile for all DRGs; 
and 
• The proportion of short-stay 
discharges to postacute care to total 
discharges in the DRG exceeds the 55th 
percentile for all DRGs. A short-stay 
discharge is a discharge before the 
geometric mean length of stay for the 
DRG. 
A DRG also is a qualifying DRG if it 
is paired with another DRG based on the 
presence or absence of a CC or MCV that 
meets either of the above two criteria. 
The MS–DRGs that we adopted for FY 
2008 were a significant revision to the 
CMS DRG system (72 FR 47141). 
Because the MS–DRGs were not 
reflected in Version 23.0 of the DRG 
Definitions Manual, consistent with 
§ 412.4, we established policy to 
recalculate the 55th percentile 
thresholds in order to determine which 
MS–DRGs would be subject to the 
postacute care transfer policy (72 FR 
47186 through 47188). Further, under

the MS–DRGs, the subdivisions within 
the base DRGs are different than those 
under the previous CMS DRGs. Unlike 
the CMS DRGs, the MS–DRGs are not 
divided based on the presence or 
absence of a CC or MCV. Rather, the 
MS–DRGs have up to three subdivisions 
based on: (1) The presence of a MCC; (2) 
the presence of a CC; or (3) the absence 
of either an MCC or CC. Consistent with 
our previous policy under which both 
CMS DRGs in a CC/non-CC pair were 
qualifying DRGs if one of the pair 
qualified, we established that each MS– 
DRG that shared a base MS–DRG will be 
a qualifying DRG if one of the MS–DRGs 
that shared the base DRG qualifies. We 
revised § 412.4(d)(3)(ii) to codify this 
policy. 
Similarly, the adoption of the MS– 
DRGs also necessitated a revision to one 
of the criteria used in § 412.4(f)(5) of the 
regulations to determine whether a DRG 
meets the criteria for payment under the 
‘‘special payment methodology.’’ Under 
the special payment methodology, a 
case subject to the special payment 
methodology that is transferred early to 
a postacute care setting will be paid 50 
percent of the total IPPS payment plus 
the average per diem for the first day of 
the stay. In addition, the hospital will 
receive 50 percent of the per diem 
amount for each subsequent day of the 
stay, up to the full MS–DRG payment 
amount. A CMS DRG was subject to the 
special payment methodology if it met 
the criteria of § 412.4(f)(5). Section 
412.4(f)(5)(iv) specifies that, for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2005, and prior to October 1, 2007, if 
a DRG meets the criteria specified under 
§ 412.4(f)(5)(i) through (f)(5)(iii), any 
DRG that is paired with it based on the 
presence or absence of a CC or MCV is 
also subject to the special payment 
methodology. Given that this criterion 
was no longer applicable under the MS– 
DRG system, in the FY 2008 final rule 
with comment period, we added a new 
§ 412.4(f)(6) (42 FR 47188 and 47410). 
Section 412.4(f)(6) provides that, for 
discharges on or after October 1, 2007, 
if an MS–DRG meets the criteria 
specified under §§ 412.4(f)(6)(i) through 
(f)(6)(iii), any other MS–DRG that is part 
of the same MS–DRG group is also 
subject to the special payment 
methodology. We updated this criterion 
so that it conformed to the changes 
associated with adopting MS–DRGs for 
FY 2008. The revision makes an MS– 
DRG subject to the special payment 
methodology if it shares a base MS–DRG 
with an MS–DRG that meets the criteria 
for receiving the special payment 
methodology. 
Section 1886(d)(5)(J) of the Act 
provides that, effective for discharges on 
or after October 1, 1998, a ‘‘qualified 
discharge’’ from one of DRGs selected 
by the Secretary to a postacute care 
provider would be treated as a transfer 
case. This section required the Secretary 
to define and pay as transfers all cases 
assigned to one of the DRGs selected by 
the Secretary, if the individuals are 
discharged to one of the following 
postacute care settings: 
• A hospital or hospital unit that is 
not a subsection 1886(d) hospital. 
(Section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act 
identifies the hospitals and hospital 
units that are excluded from the term 
‘‘subsection (d) hospital’’ as psychiatric 
hospitals and units, rehabilitation 
hospitals and units, children’s hospitals, 
long-term care hospitals, and cancer 
hospitals.) 
• A SNF (as defined at section1819(a) 
of the Act). 
• Home health services provided by a 
home health agency, if the services 
relate to the condition or diagnosis for 
which the individual received inpatient 
hospital services, and if the home health 
services are provided within an 
appropriate period (as determined by 
the Secretary). In the FY 1999 IPPS final 
rule (63 FR 40975 through 40976 and 
40979 through 40981), we specified that 
a patient discharged to home would be 
considered transferred to postacute care 
if the patient received home health 
services within 3 days after the date of 
discharge. In addition, in the FY 1999 
IPPS final rule, we did not include 
patients transferred to a swing-bed for 
skilled nursing care in the definition of 
postacute care transfer cases (63 FR 
40977). 
2. Proposed Policy Change Relating to 
Transfers to Home with a Written Plan 
for the Provision of Home Health 
Services 
As noted above, in the FY 1999 IPPS 
final rule (63 FR 40975 through 40976 
and 40979 through 40981), we 
determined that 3 days is an appropriate 
period within which home health 
services should begin following a 
beneficiary’s discharge to the home in 
order for the discharge to be considered 
a ‘‘qualified discharge’’ subject to the 
payment adjustment for postacute care 
transfer cases. In that same final rule, 
we noted that we would monitor 
whether 3 days would remain an 
appropriate timeframe. 
Section 1886(d)(5)(J)(ii)(III) of the Act 
provides that the discharge of an 
individual who receives home health 
services upon discharge will be treated 
as a transfer if ‘‘such services are 
provided within an appropriate period 
as determined by the Secretary * * *’’. 
The statute thus confers upon the 
Secretary the authority to determine an 
appropriate timeframe for the 
application of the postacute care 
transfer policy in cases where home 
health services commence subsequent to 
discharge from an acute care hospital. In 
the FY 1999 final IPPS rule, we 
established the policy that the postacute 
care transfer policy would apply to 
cases in which the home health care 
begins within 3 days of the discharge 
from an acute care policy. We noted in 
that rule that we did not believe that it 
was appropriate to limit the transfer 
definition to cases in which home 
health care begins on the same day as 
the patient is discharged from the 
hospital. We observed that data 
indicated that less than 8 percent of 
discharged patients who receive home 
health care begin receiving those 
services on the date of discharge. It is 
unreasonable to expect that patients 
who are discharged later in the day 
would receive a home health visit that 
same day. Furthermore, we believed 
that the financial incentive to delay 
needed home health care for only a 
matter of hours would be overwhelming 
if we limited the timeframe to one day. 
At the time of that final rule, we 
explained that we believed that 3 days 
would be a more appropriate timeframe 
because it would mitigate the incentive 
to delay home health services to avoid 
the application of the postacute care 
transfer policy, and because a 3-day 
timeframe was consistent with existing 
patterns of care. 
In that final rule, we also noted that 
a number of commenters had raised 
issues and questions concerning the 
proposal to adopt 3 days as the 
appropriate timeframe for the 
application of the postacute care 
transfer policy in these cases. While 
most of the commenters advocated 
shorter timeframes, on the grounds that 
postacute care beginning 3 days after a 
discharge should not be considered a 
substitute for inpatient hospital care, 
others suggested that a 3-day window 
might still allow for needlessly 
prolonged hospital care or delayed 
home health in order to avoid the 
application of the postacute care 
transfer policy. Although MedPAC 
agreed with the commenters who 
asserted that home health care services 
furnished after a delay of more than one 
day may not necessarily be regarded as 
substituting for inpatient acute care, 
they also noted that a 3-day window 
allows for the fact that most home 
health patients do not receive care every 
day, as well as for those occasions in 
which there may be a delay in arranging 
for the provision of planned care (for

23641 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
example, an intervening weekend). The 
commission also stated that a shorter 
period may create a stronger incentive 
to delay the provision of necessary care 
beyond the window so that the hospital 
will receive the full DRG payment. In 
the light of these comments and, in 
particular, of the concern that a 3-day 
timeframe still allowed for some 
incentive to delay necessary home 
health services in order to avoid the 
application of the postacute care 
transfer policy, we indicated that we 
would continue to monitor this policy 
in order to track any changes in 
practices that may indicate the need for 
revising the window. 
Since the adoption of this policy in 
FY 1999, we have continued to receive 
reports that some providers discharge 
patients prior to the geometric mean 
length of stay but intentionally delay 
home health services beyond 3 days 
after the acute hospital discharge in 
order to avoid the postacute care 
transfer payment adjustment policy. 
These reports, and the concerns 
expressed by some commenters in FY 
1999 about the adequacy of a 3-day 
window to reduce such incentives, have 
prompted us to examine the available 
data concerning the initiation and 
program payments for home health care 
subsequent to discharge from postacute 
care. 
We merged the FY 2004 MedPAR file 
with postacute care bill files matching 
beneficiary identification numbers and 
discharge and admission dates and 
looked at the 10 DRGs that were subject 
to the postacute care transfer policy 
from FYs 1999 through 2003 (DRG 14 
(Intracranial Hemorrhage and Stroke 
with Infarction (formerly ‘‘Specific 
Cerebrovascular Disorders Except 
Transient Ischemic Attack’’)); DRG 113 
(Amputation for Circulatory System 
Disorders Except Upper Limb and Toe); 
DRG 209 (Major Joint Limb 
Reattachment Procedures of Lower 
Extremity); DRG 210 (Hip and Femur 
Procedures Except Major Joint 
Procedures ≤17 with CC); DRG 211 (Hip 
and Femur Procedures Except Major 
Joint Procedures Age ≤17 without CC); 
DRG 236 (Fractures of Hip and Pelvis); 
DRG 263 (Skin Graft and/or 
Debridement for Skin Ulcer or Cellulitis 
with CC); DRG 264 (Skin Graft and/or 
Debridement for Skin Ulcer or Cellulitis 
without CC); DRG 429 (Organic 
Disturbances and Mental Retardation); 
and DRG 483 (Tracheostomy with 
Mechanical Ventiliation 96+ Hours or 
Principal Diagnosis Except Face, Mouth, 
and Neck Diagnoses (formerly 
‘‘Tracheostomy Except for Face, Mouth, 
and Neck Diagnoses’’)). We selected the 
original 10 ‘‘qualified DRGs’’ because 
they were the DRGs to which the 
postacute care transfer policy applied 
for FYs 1999 through 2003 and because 
we expect that trends that we found in 
the data with those DRGs would be 
likely to accurately reflect provider 
practices after the inception of the 
postacute care transfer policy. We 
expect that provider practices for the 
original 10 DRGs would be consistent 
even with the expansion of the DRGs 
that are subject to the postacute care 
transfer policy. We note that providers 
may have even a greater incentive to 
delay the initiation of home health care 
in an effort to avoid the postacute care 
transfer policy now that there are more 
DRGs to which the policy applies. We 
compared data on home health services 
provided to patients who were 
discharged prior to the geometric mean 
length of stay to patients who were 
discharged at or beyond the geometric 
mean length of stay. For purposes of this 
analysis, we assumed that home health 
was the first discharge designation from 
the acute care hospital setting. 
The data showed that, on average, the 
Medicare payment per home health visit 
was higher for patients who were 
discharged prior to the geometric mean 
length of stay (as compared to patients 
who were discharged at or beyond the 
geometric mean length of stay). 
Additionally, we found some evidence 
in the data suggesting that, for patients 
discharged prior to the geometric mean 
length of stay for many DRGs, hospitals 
may indeed be discharging patients 
earlier than advisable, providing less 
than the optimal amount of acute 
inpatient care, and are instead 
substituting home health care for 
inpatient services, resulting in higher 
home health care payments under the 
Medicare program. One generally would 
expect that patients discharged prior to 
the geometric mean length of stay are 
genuinely less severely ill than patients 
discharged at or after the geometric 
mean length of stay because patients in 
the former group are judged to be 
appropriate for discharge after less acute 
inpatient care. However, our data paint 
a different picture. For example, the 
data on the average per day Medicare 
payments for home health care for those 
patients who are discharged from the 
hospital prior to the geometric mean 
length of stay in the DRGs to which the 
postacute care transfer policy applies, as 
compared to Medicare payments for 
patients discharged from the hospital at 
or after the geometric mean length of 
stay, show patterns other than what 
might be expected if hospitals are 
generally discharging patients for home 
health care only after the full amount of 
acute inpatient care. Specifically, 
average Medicare payments per home 
health care visit are consistently higher 
for patients discharged prior to the 
geometric mean length of stay than for 
patients discharged at or after the 
geometric mean length of stay. The 
average home health care per visit 
payments for patients treated for the 
relevant DRGs and discharged before the 
geometric mean length of stay are $204 
when the initiation of home health care 
began on the second day after discharge, 
$199 on the third day, and $182 on the 
sixth day, compared to $177, $163, and 
$171, respectively for patients 
discharged on or after the geometric 
mean length of stay. Furthermore, the 
ratio of the payments for these two 
groups actually increases from 1.16 on 
the third day after discharge to 1.22 on 
the fourth day, before falling again to 
1.04, 1.07, and 1.08 on the fifth, sixth, 
and seventh days. This suggests the 
possibility that home health care for 
some relatively sicker patients is being 
delayed until just beyond the 3-day 
window during which the postacute 
care transfer policy applies. In the light 
of these data, we believe that it is 
appropriate to propose extending the 
applicable timeframe in order to reduce 
the incentive for providers to delay 
home health care when discharging 
patients from the acute care setting. 
Further examination of the data 
indicates that the average per day 
Medicare payments for home health 
care for those patients, in the DRGs to 
which the postacute care transfer policy 
applies, who are discharged from the 
hospital prior to the geometric mean 
length of stay, stabilizes at a somewhat 
lower amount when the initiation of 
home health visits begins on the seventh 
and subsequent days after discharge. 
Specifically, average payments per visit 
for this group fall from $182 when home 
health services began on the sixth day 
after the acute care hospital discharge to 
$174 on the seventh day, and then 
remain relatively steady at $171, $177, 
and $172 on the eighth, ninth, and tenth 
days. This suggests that a 7-day period 
would be an appropriate point at which 
to establish a new timeframe. The 
stabilization of average home health 
care visit payments at and after the 
seventh day suggests that this may be 
the point at which the incentives to 
delay the start of home health care in 
order to avoid the application of the 
postacute care transfer policy are 
reduced. As a consequence of this 
analysis, in this proposed rule, we are 
proposing to revise § 412.4(c)(3) to 
extend the timeframe to within 7 days 
of discharge to home under a written

23642 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
plan for the provision of home health 
services, effective October 1, 2008. We 
believe that extending the applicable 
timeframe will lessen the incentive for 
providers to delay the start of home 
health care after discharging patients 
from the acute care hospital setting. 
During the comment period on this 
proposed rule, we plan to continue to 
search our data on postacute care 
discharges to home health services. We 
welcome comments and suggestions on 
other data analyses that can be 
performed to determine an appropriate 
timeframe for which the postacute care 
transfer policy would apply. 
In addition to the reasons noted 
above, we believe that 7 days is 
currently an appropriate timeframe 
because we believe that accommodates 
current practices and it is sufficiently 
long enough to lessen the likelihood 
that providers would delay the 
initiation of necessary home health 
services. At the same time, we believe 
that 7 days is narrow enough that we 
would still expect the majority of the 
home health services to be related to the 
condition to which the acute inpatient 
hospital stay was necessary. Further, we 
note that there may be some cases for 
which it is not clinically appropriate to 
begin home health services immediately 
following an acute care discharge, and 
that even when home health services are 
clinically appropriate sooner than 
within 7 days of acute care discharge, 
home health services may not be 
immediately available. 
We note that, as we stated in the FY 
2000 IPPS final rule (65 FR 47081), if 
the hospital’s continuing care plan for 
the patient is not related to the purpose 
of the inpatient hospital admission, a 
condition code 42 must be entered on 
the claim. If the continuing care plan is 
related to the purpose of the inpatient 
hospital admission but begins after 7 
days (formerly after 3 days) of discharge, 
a condition code 43 must be entered on 
the claim. The presence of either of 
these condition codes in conjunction 
with patient status discharge code 06 
(Discharged/Transferred to Home under 
Care of Organized Home Health Service 
Organization in Anticipation of Covered 
Skilled Care) will result in full payment 
rather than the transfer payment 
amount. 
3. Evaluation of MS–DRGs Under 
Postacute Care Transfer Policy for FY 
2009 
For FY 2009, we are not proposing to 
make any changes to the criteria by 
which an MS–DRG would qualify for 
inclusion in the postacute care transfer 
policy. However, because we are 
proposing to revise some existing MS– 
DRGs and to add one new MS–DRG 
(discussed under section II.G. of this 
preamble), we are proposing to evaluate 
those MS–DRGs under our existing 
postacute care transfer criteria in order 
to determine whether any of the revised 
or new MS–DRGs will meet the 
postacute care transfer criteria for FY 
2009. Therefore, for 2009, we are 
evaluating MS–DRGs 001, 002, 215, 245, 
901 through 909, 913 through 923, 955 
through 959, and 963 through 965. Any 
revisions made would not constitute a 
change to the application of the 
postacute care transfer policy. A list 
indicating which MS–DRGs would be 
subject to the postacute care transfer 
policy for FY 2009 can be found in 
Table 5 in the Addendum to this 
proposed rule. 
B. Reporting of Hospital Quality Data 
for Annual Hospital Payment Update 
(§ 412.64(d)(2)) 
1. Background 
a. Overview 
CMS is transforming the Medicare 
program from a passive payer to an 
active purchaser of higher quality, more 
efficient health care. Such care will 
contribute to the sustainability of the 
Medicare program, encourage the 
delivery of high quality care while 
avoiding unnecessary costs, and help 
ensure high value for beneficiaries. To 
support this transformation, CMS has 
worked with stakeholders to develop 
and implement quality measures, make 
provider and plan performance public, 
link payment incentives to reporting on 
measures, and ultimately is working to 
link payment to actual performance on 
these measures. Commonly referred to 
as value-based purchasing, this policy 
aligns payment incentives with the 
quality of care as well as the resources 
used to deliver care to encourage the 
delivery of high-value health care. 
The success of this transformation is 
supported by and dependent upon an 
increasing number of widely-agreed 
upon quality measures. The Medicare 
program has defined measures of quality 
in almost every setting and measures 
some aspect of care for almost all 
Medicare beneficiaries. These measures 
include clinical processes, patient 
perception of their care experience, and, 
increasingly, outcomes. 
The Medicare program has 
established mechanisms for collecting 
information on these measures, such as 
QualityNet, an Internet-based process 
that hospitals use to report all-payer 
information. Initial voluntary efforts 
were supplemented beginning in FY 
2005 by a provision in the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Improvement and 
Modernization Act (MMA), which 
provided the full annual payment 
update only to ‘‘subsection (d) 
hospitals’’ (that is, hospitals paid under 
the IPPS) that successfully reported on 
a set of widely-agreed upon quality 
measures. Since FY 2007, as required by 
subsequent legislation (the Deficit 
Reduction Act (DRA)) the number of 
quality measures and the amount of the 
financial incentive have increased. 
As a result, the great majority of 
hospitals now report on quality 
measures for heart failure, heart disease, 
pneumonia, and surgical infection and 
received the full annual update for FY 
2008. The number of measures has 
continued to grow and the types of 
measures have grown as well, with the 
addition of outcomes measures, such as 
heart attack and heart failure mortality 
measures, and the HCAHPS measure of 
patient satisfaction. In section IV.B.2. of 
this preamble, we are seeking public 
comments on proposed additional 
quality measures. 
Reporting on these measures provides 
hospitals a greater awareness of the 
quality of care they provide and 
provides actionable information for 
consumers to make more informed 
decisions about their health care 
providers and treatments. 
Moving beyond reporting to 
performance, CMS has designed a 
Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Plan 
that would link hospital payments to 
their actual performance on quality 
measures. In accordance with the DRA, 
the Plan was submitted to Congress in 
November 2007. We discuss the Plan 
more fully in section IV.C. of this 
preamble. 
The ongoing CMS Premier Hospital 
Quality Incentive Demonstration project 
is another effort linking payments to 
quality performance. Launched in 2003, 
the Premier Hospital Quality Incentive 
Demonstration project promotes 
measurable improvements in the quality 
of care, examining whether economic 
incentives to hospitals are effective at 
improving the quality of care. Early 
evidence from the project indicates that 
linking payments to quality 
performance can be effective. 
As required by section 5001(c) the 
DRA, CMS also has implemented a 
program intended to encourage the 
prevention of certain avoidable or 
preventable hospital-acquired 
conditions (HACs), including infections, 
that may occur during a hospital stay. 
Beginning October 1, 2007, CMS 
required hospitals to begin reporting 
information on Medicare claims 
specifying whether certain diagnoses 
were present on admission (POA). 
Beginning October 1, 2008, CMS will no

longer pay hospitals for a DRG using the 
higher-paying CC or MCC associated 
with one or more of these conditions (if 
no other condition meeting the higher 
paying CC or MCC criteria is present) 
unless the condition was POA (that is, 
not acquired during the hospital stay). 
Linking a payment incentive to 
hospitals’ prevention of avoidable or 
preventable HACs is a strong approach 
for encouraging high quality care. 
Combating these HACs can reduce 
morbidity and mortality as well as 
reducing unnecessary costs. In the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 47217), CMS identified 
eight HACs. In section II.F. of this 
preamble, CMS is seeking comment on 
additional proposed conditions. 
CMS is committed to enhancing these 
value-based purchasing programs, in 
close collaboration with stakeholders, 
through the development and use of 
new measures for quality reporting, 
expanded public reporting, greater and 
more widespread incentives in the 
payment system for reporting on such 
measures, and ultimately performance 
on those measures. These initiatives 
hold the potential to transform the 
delivery of health care by rewarding 
quality of care and delivering higher 
value to Medicare beneficiaries. 
A critical element of value-based 
purchasing is well-accepted measures. 
Hospitals can then measure their 
performance relative to other hospitals. 
Further, this information can be posted 
for consumers to use to make more 
informed choices about their care. In 
this section IV.B. of this preamble, we 
describe past and current efforts to make 
this information available and proposals 
to expand these efforts and make even 
more useful hospital quality information 
available to the public. 
b. Voluntary Hospital Quality Data 
Reporting 
In December 2002, the Secretary 
announced a partnership with several 
collaborators intended to promote 
hospital quality improvement and 
public reporting of hospital quality 
information. These collaborators 
included the American Hospital 
Association (AHA), the Federation of 
American Hospitals (FAH), the 
Association of American Medical 
Colleges (AAMC), the Joint Commission 
on Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations (the Joint Commission), 
the National Quality Forum (NQF), the 
American Medical Association (AMA), 
the Consumer-Purchaser Disclosure 
Project, the American Association of 
Retired Persons (AARP), the American 
Federation of Labor-Congress of 
Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality (AHRQ), as well as CMS and 
others. In July 2003, CMS began the 
National Voluntary Hospital Reporting 
Initiative. This initiative is now known 
as the Hospital Quality Alliance: 
Improving Care through Information 
(HQA). 
We established the following ‘‘starter 
set’’ of 10 quality measures for 
voluntary reporting as of November 1, 
2003: 
Heart Attack (Acute Myocardial 
Infarction or AMI) 
• Was aspirin given to the patient 
upon arrival to the hospital? 
• Was aspirin prescribed when the 
patient was discharged? 
• Was a beta blocker given to the 
patient upon arrival to the hospital? 
• Was a beta blocker prescribed when 
the patient was discharged? 
• Was an Angiotensin Converting 
Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor given for the 
patient with heart failure? 
Heart Failure (HF) 
• Did the patient get an assessment of 
his or her heart function? 
• Was an Angiotensin Converting 
Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor given to the 
patient? 
Pneumonia (PN) 
• Was an antibiotic given to the 
patient in a timely way? 
• Had the patient received a 
pneumococcal vaccination? 
• Was the patient’s oxygen level 
assessed? 
This starter set of 10 quality measures 
was endorsed by the NQF. The NQF is 
a voluntary consensus standard-setting 
organization established to standardize 
health care quality measurement and 
reporting through its consensus 
development process. In addition, this 
starter set is a subset of measures 
currently collected for the Joint 
Commission as part of its hospital 
inpatient certification program. 
We chose these 10 quality measures 
in order to collect data that would: (1) 
Provide useful and valid information 
about hospital quality to the public; (2) 
provide hospitals with a sense of 
predictability about public reporting 
expectations; (3) begin to standardize 
data and data collection mechanisms; 
and (4) foster hospital quality 
improvement. 
Hospitals submit quality data through 
the QualityNet secure Web site 
(formerly known as QualityNet 
Exchange) (www.qualitynet.org). This 
Web site meets or exceeds all current 
Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act requirements for 
security of personal health information. 
Data from this initiative are used to 
populate the Hospital Compare Web 
site, www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov. 
This Web site assists beneficiaries and 
the general public by providing 
information on hospital quality of care 
for consumers who need to select a 
hospital. It further serves to encourage 
consumers to work with their doctors 
and hospitals to discuss the quality of 
care hospitals provide to patients, 
thereby providing an additional 
incentive to improve the quality of care 
that they furnish. 
c. Hospital Quality Data Reporting 
Under Section 501(b) of Pub. L. 108–173 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(vii) of the Act, 
as added by section 501(b) of Pub. L. 
108–173, revised the mechanism used to 
update the standardized amount of 
payment for inpatient hospital operating 
costs. Specifically, the statute provided 
for a reduction of 0.4 percentage points 
to the update percentage increase (also 
known as the market basket update) for 
each of FYs 2005 through 2007 for any 
subsection (d) hospital that does not 
submit data on a set of 10 quality 
indicators established by the Secretary 
as of November 1, 2003. The statute also 
provided that any reduction would 
apply only to the fiscal year involved, 
and would not be taken into account in 
computing the applicable percentage 
increase for a subsequent fiscal year. 
This measure established an incentive 
for IPPS hospitals to submit data on the 
quality measures established by the 
Secretary. 
We initially implemented section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(vii) of the Act in the FY 
2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49078). In 
addition, we established the Reporting 
Hospital Quality Data for Annual 
Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program 
and added 42 CFR 412.64(d)(2) to our 
regulations. We adopted additional 
requirements under the RHQDAPU 
program in the FY 2006 IPPS final rule 
(70 FR 47420). 
d. Hospital Quality Data Reporting 
Under Section 5001(a) of Pub. L. 109– 
171 
Section 5001(a) of the Deficit 
Reduction Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109–171 
(DRA), further amended section 
1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act to revise the 
mechanism used to update the 
standardized amount for payment for 
hospital inpatient operating costs. 
Specifically, sections 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(I) and (II) of the Act 
provide that the payment update for FY 
2007 and each subsequent fiscal year be 
reduced by 2.0 percentage points for any 
subsection (d) hospital that does not

16 Institute of Medicine, ‘‘Performance 
Measurement: Accelerating Improvement,’’ 
December 1, 2005, available at: www.iom.edu/CMS/ 
3809/19805/31310.aspx. 
submit certain quality data in a form 
and manner, and at a time, specified by 
the Secretary. Section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(III) of the Act requires 
that the Secretary expand the ‘‘starter 
set’’ of 10 quality measures that were 
established by the Secretary as of 
November 1, 2003, as the Secretary 
determines to be appropriate for the 
measurement of the quality of care 
furnished by a hospital in inpatient 
settings. In expanding this set of 
measures, section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(IV) 
of the Act requires that, effective for 
payments beginning with FY 2007, the 
Secretary begin to adopt the baseline set 
of performance measures as set forth in 
a December 2005 report issued by the 
Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the 
National Academy of Sciences under 
section 238(b) of the MMA.16 
The IOM measures include: 21 HQA 
quality measures (including the ‘‘starter 
set’’ of 10 quality measures); the 
HCAHPS patient experience of care 
survey; and 3 structural measures. The 
structural measures are: (1) 
Implementation of computerized 
provider order entry for prescriptions; 
(2) staffing of intensive care units with 
intensivists; and (3) evidence-based 
hospital referrals. These structural 
measures constitute the Leapfrog 
Group’s original ‘‘three leaps,’’ and are 
part of the NQF’s 30 Safe Practices for 
Better Healthcare. 
Sections 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(V) and 
(VI) of the Act require that, effective for 
payments beginning with FY 2008, the 
Secretary add other quality measures 
that reflect consensus among affected 
parties, and to the extent feasible and 
practicable, have been set forth by one 
or more national consensus building 
entities, and provide the Secretary with 
the discretion to replace any quality 
measures or indicators in appropriate 
cases, such as where all hospitals are 
effectively in compliance with a 
measure, or the measures or indicators 
have been subsequently shown to not 
represent the best clinical practice. 
Thus, the Secretary is granted broad 
discretion to replace measures that are 
no longer appropriate for the RHQDAPU 
program. 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(VII) of the 
Act requires that the Secretary establish 
procedures for making quality data 
available to the public after ensuring 
that a hospital would have the 
opportunity to review its data before 
these data are made public. In addition, 
this section requires that the Secretary 
report quality measures of process, 
structure, outcome, patients’ perspective 
of care, efficiency, and costs of care that 
relate to services furnished in inpatient 
settings on the CMS Web site. 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(I) of the 
Act also provides that any reduction in 
a hospital’s payment update will apply 
only with respect to the fiscal year 
involved, and will not be taken into 
account for computing the applicable 
percentage increase for a subsequent 
fiscal year. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 
48045), we amended our regulations at 
42 CFR 412.64(d)(2) to reflect the 2.0 
percentage point reduction in the 
payment update for FY 2007 and 
subsequent fiscal years for subsection 
(d) hospitals that do not comply with 
requirements for reporting quality data, 
as provided for under section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act. In the FY 
2007 IPPS final rule, we also added 11 
additional quality measures to the 10- 
measure starter set to establish an 
expanded set of 21 quality measures (71 
FR 48033 through 48037). 
Commenters on the FY 2007 IPPS 
proposed rule requested that we notify 
the public as far in advance as possible 
of any proposed expansions of the 
measure set and program procedures in 
order to encourage broad collaboration 
and to give hospitals time to prepare for 
any anticipated change. Taking these 
concerns into account, in the CY 2007 
OPPS/ASC final rule with comment 
period (71 FR 68201), we adopted six 
additional quality measures for the FY 
2008 IPPS update, for a total of 27 
measures. The measure set that we 
adopted for the FY 2008 payment 
determination was as follows: 
Topic Quality measure 
Heart Attack (Acute Myocardial Infarction). ............................................. • Aspirin at arrival.* 
• Aspirin prescribed at discharge.* 
• Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACE–I) or Angiotensin II 
Receptor Blocker (ARB) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction.* 
• Beta blocker at arrival.* 
• Beta blocker prescribed at discharge.* 
• Fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agent received within 30 minutes of hos-
pital arrival.** 
• Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) received within 120 min-
utes of hospital arrival.** 
• Adult smoking cessation advice/counseling.** 
Heart Failure (HF) .................................................................................... • Left ventricular function assessment.* 
• Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACE–I) or Angiotensin II 
Receptor Blocker (ARB) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 
• Discharge instructions.** 
• Adult smoking cessation advice/counseling.** 
Pneumonia (PN) ....................................................................................... • Initial antibiotic received within 4 hours of hospital arrival * 
• Oxygenation assessment.* 
• Pneumococcal vaccination status.* 
• Blood culture performed before first antibiotic received in hospital.** 
• Adult smoking cessation advice/counseling.** 
• Appropriate initial antibiotic selection.** 
• Influenza vaccination status.** 
Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP)—named SIP for discharges 
prior to July 2006 (3Q06).
• Prophylactic antibiotic received within 1 hour prior to surgical inci-
sion.** 
• Prophylactic antibiotics discontinued within 24 hours after surgery 
end time.**

• SCIP–VTE–2: VTE prophylaxis within 24 hours pre/post surgery.*** 
• SCIP Infection 2: Prophylactic antibiotic selection for surgical pa-
tients.*** 
Mortality Measures (Medicare patients) ................................................... • Acute Myocardial Infarction 30-day mortality Medicare patients*** 
• Heart Failure 30-day mortality Medicare patients.*** 
Patients’ Experience of Care. ................................................................... HCAHPS patient survey.*** 
*Measure included in 10 measure starter set. 
**Measure included in 21 measure expanded set. 
***Measure added in CY 2007 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (data submission required as of January 2007 for three additional 
SCIP measures). 
For FY 2008, hospitals were required 
to submit data on 25 of the 27 measures. 
No data submission was required for the 
two mortality outcome measures (30- 
Day Risk Standardized Mortality Rates 
for Heart Failure and AMI), because 
they were calculated using existing 
administrative Medicare claims data. 
The measures used for the payment 
determination included, for the first 
time, the HCAHPS patient experience of 
care survey as well as two outcome 
measures. These measures expanded the 
types of measures available for public 
reporting as required under section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act. In 
addition, the outcome measures, which 
are claims-based measures, did not 
increase the data submission 
requirements for hospitals, thereby 
reducing the burden associated with 
collection of data for quality reporting. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule (72 
FR 24805), we proposed to add 1 
outcome measure and 4 process 
measures to the existing 27-measure set 
to establish a new set of 32 quality 
measures to be used under the 
RHQDAPU program for the FY 2009 
IPPS annual payment determination. 
We proposed to add the following five 
measures for the FY 2009 IPPS annual 
payment determination: 
• PN 30-day mortality measure 
(Medicare patients) 
• SCIP Infection 4: Cardiac Surgery 
Patients with Controlled 6AM 
Postoperative 
Serum Glucose 
• SCIP Infection 6: Surgery Patients 
with Appropriate Hair Removal 
• SCIP Infection 7: Colorectal Patients 
with Immediate Postoperative 
Normothermia 
• SCIP Cardiovascular 2: Surgery 
Patients on a Beta Blocker Prior to 
Arrival Who Received a Beta Blocker 
During the Perioperative Period 
We stated that we planned to formally 
adopt these measures a year in advance 
in order to provide time for hospitals to 
prepare for changes related to the 
RHQDAPU program. We also stated that 
we anticipated that the proposed 
measures would be endorsed by the 
NQF, as a national consensus building 
entity. Finally, we stated that any 
proposed measure that was not 
endorsed by the NQF by the time that 
we published the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period would not be 
finalized in that final rule. 
At the time we published the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period, 
only the PN 30-day mortality measure 
had been endorsed by the NQF. 
Therefore, we finalized only that 
measure as part of the FY 2009 IPPS 
measure set and stated that we would 
further address adding additional 
measures in the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC 
final rule and, if necessary, in the FY 
2009 IPPS proposed and final rules. We 
also responded to comments we had 
received on the five proposed measures 
(72 FR 47348 through 47351). 
In the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 66875), we 
noted that the NQF had endorsed the 
following additional process measures 
that we had proposed to include in the 
FY 2009 RHQDAPU program measure 
set: 
• SCIP Infection 4: Cardiac Surgery 
Patients with Controlled 6AM 
Postoperative 
Serum Glucose 
• SCIP Infection 6: Surgery Patients 
with Appropriate Hair Removal 
As we stated in the FY 2008 IPPS 
proposed rule (72 FR 24805), these 
measures reflect our continuing 
commitment to quality improvement in 
both clinical care and quality. These 
quality measures reflect consensus 
among affected parties as demonstrated 
by endorsement by a national consensus 
building entity. The addition of these 
two measures for the FY 2009 measure 
set bring the total number of measures 
in that measure set to 30 (72 FR 66876). 
The measure set to be used for FY 
2009 annual payment determination is 
as follows: 
Topic Quality measure 
Heart Attack (Acute Myocardial Infarction) .............................................. • Aspirin at arrival*. 
• Aspirin prescribed at discharge*. 
• Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACE–I) or Angiotensin II 
Receptor Blocker (ARB) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction*. 
• Beta blocker at arrival*. 
• Beta blocker prescribed at discharge*. 
• Fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agent received within 30 minutes of hos-
pital arrival**. 
• Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) received within 
120 minutes of hospital arrival**. 
• Adult smoking cessation advice/counseling**. 
Heart Failure (HF) .................................................................................... • Left ventricular function assessment*.

**** Measure added in FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period. 
***** Measure added in CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (data submission required effective with discharges starting Janu-
ary 1, 2008). 
We also stated in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period and the 
CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with 
comment period that the RHQDAPU 
program participation requirements for 
the FY 2009 program would apply to 
additional measures we adopt for the FY 
2009 program (72 FR 47361; 72 FR 
66877). 
Therefore, hospitals are required to 
start submitting data for SCIP Infection 
4 and SCIP Infection 6 starting with first 
quarter calendar year 2008 discharges 
and subsequent quarters until further 
notice. Hospitals must submit their 
aggregate population and sample size 
counts for Medicare and non-Medicare 
patients. These requirements are 
consistent with the requirements for the 
other AMI, HF, PN, and SCIP process 
measures included in the FY 2009 
measure set. The complete list of 
procedures for participating in the 
RHQDAPU program for FY 2009 are 
provided in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47359 
through 47361). 
Because SCIP Cardiovascular 2 and 
SCIP Infection 7 had not been endorsed 
by a national consensus building entity 
by the publishing deadline for the CY 
2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with 
comment period, we did not adopt these 
measures as part of the FY 2009 IPPS 
measure set. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule, 
we also solicited public comments on 
18 measures and 8 measure sets that 
could be selected for future inclusion in 
the RHQDAPU program (72 FR 24805). 
These measures and measure sets 
highlight our interest in improving 
patient safety and outcomes of care, 
with a particular focus on the quality of 
surgical care and patient outcomes. In 
order to engender a broad review of 
potential performance measures, the list 
included measures that have not yet 
received endorsement by a national 
consensus review process for public 
reporting. The list also included 
measures developed by organizations 
other than CMS as well as measures that 
can be calculated using administrative 
data (such as claims). 
We solicited public comment not only 
on the measures and measure sets that 
were listed, but also on whether there 
were any critical gaps or ‘‘missing’’ 
measures or measure sets. We 
specifically requested input concerning 
the following issues: 
• Which of the measures or measure 
sets should be included in the FY 2009 
RHQDAPU program or in subsequent 
years? 
• What challenges for data collection 
and reporting are posed by the 
identified measures and measure sets? 
• What improvements could be made 
to data collection or reporting that might 
offset or otherwise address those 
challenges? 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47351), after 
consideration of the public comments 
received, we decided not to adopt any 
of these measures or measure sets for FY 
2009. We indicated that we will 
continue to consider some of these 
measures and measure sets for 
subsequent years.

Pneumonia, HCAHPS, and SCIP 
measures adopted for FY 2009. As noted 
above, the three outcome measures do 
not require hospitals to submit data. In 
addition, we are proposing to remove 
the Pneumonia Oxygenation 
Assessment measure from the 
RHQDAPU program measure set. We are 
proposing to discontinue requiring 
hospitals to submit data on the 
Pneumonia Oxygenation Assessment 
measure, effective with discharges 
beginning January 1, 2009. Section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(VI) of the Act 
provides the Secretary with the 
discretion to replace any quality 
measures or indicators in appropriate 
cases, such as where all hospitals are 
effectively in compliance with a 
measure. We interpret this to authorize 
the Secretary to remove or retire 
measures from the RHQDAPU program. 
In the case of the Pneumonia 
Oxygenation Assessment measure, the 
vast majority of hospitals are performing 
near 100 percent. In addition, 
oxygenation assessment is routinely 
performed by hospitals for admitted 
patients without regard to the specific 
diagnosis. Thus, the measure is topped 
out so completely across virtually all 
hospitals as to provide no significant 
opportunity for improvement. We 
believe that the burden to hospitals to 
abstract and report these data outweighs 
the benefit in publicly reporting 
hospital level data with very little 
variation among hospitals. We do not 
expect that the retirement of the 
Pneumonia Oxygenation Assessment 
measure will result in the deterioration 
of care. However, if we determine 
otherwise, we may seek to reintroduce 
the measure. 
The proposed removal of the 
Pneumonia Oxygenation Assessment 
measure for FY 2010 represents the first 
instance of retiring a measure. We 
intend to review other existing chart- 
abstracted measures recognizing the 
significant burden to hospitals that chart 
abstraction requires. In this way, we 
seek to maximize the value of the 
RHQDAPU program to promote quality 
improvement by hospitals and to report 
information that the public will find 
beneficial in choosing inpatient hospital 
services. We invite comment on the 
retirement of the Pneumonia 
Oxygenation Assessment measure. In 
addition, we invite comment on other 
measures that may be suitable for 
retirement from the RHQDAPU program 
measure set. Finally, we invite comment 
on the following general considerations 
relevant to retiring measures: 
• Should CMS retire a RHQDAPU 
program measure when hospital 
performance on the measure has 
reached a high threshold (that is, 
performance on the measure has topped 
out) even if the measure still reflects 
best practice? 
• Are there reasons to consider 
retiring a measure other than high 
overall performance? 
• When a measure is retired on the 
basis of substantially complete 
compliance by hospitals, should data 
collection on the measure again be 
required after 1 or 2 years to assure that 
a high compliance level remains, or 
should some other way of monitoring 
continued hospital compliance be used? 
The specifications for two of the 
existing measures have been updated by 
the NQF, effective May 2007, with 
respect to the applicable timing interval. 
For the measures previously identified 
as: 
• AMI—Primary Percutaneous 
Coronary Intervention (PCI) received 
within 120 minutes of hospital arrival, 
the NQF has revised its endorsement of 
the specifications to reflect that the 
timing interval has been changed to PCI 
within 90 minutes of arrival. 
• Pneumonia—Initial antibiotic 
received within 4 hours of hospital 
arrival, the NQF has revised its 
endorsement of the specifications to 
reflect that the initial antibiotic must be 
received within 6 hours of arrival. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, one commenter ‘‘urged 
CMS to develop a policy to harmonize 
measures that related to payment, such 
as the NQF’s move from a 4-hour 
timeframe for initial antibiotic 
administration for pneumonia patients 
to a 6-hour timeframe (72 FR 47357).’’ 
Another commenter raised the issue of 
the timing for PCI in the AMI topic (72 
FR 47347–8). In response to these 
comments, we responded that if we 
believe that a change is an appropriate 
change for the RHQDAPU program, we 
would expect to adopt it. 
Because the NQF is now endorsing 
different timing intervals with respect to 
these measures, we are proposing to also 
update these measures for the purposes 
of the FY 2010 RHQDAPU program. The 
updated measures are as follows: 
• AMI—Timing of Receipt of Primary 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 
(PCI); and 
• Pneumonia—Timing of receipt of 
initial antibiotic following hospital 
arrival. 
We note that the technical 
specifications for these measures will 
not change, and hospitals will continue 
to submit the same data that they 
currently submit. However, beginning 
with discharges on or after January 1, 
2009, CMS will calculate the measures 
using the updated timing intervals. 
The NQF updated these two measures 
to reflect the most current consensus 
standards effective May 2007. Because 
this was after we issued the FY 2008 
IPPS proposed rule, we could not adopt 
the updated measures in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period or 
CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with 
comment period. We also recognized 
that we did not have in place a 
subregulatory process that would have 
permitted us to update the measures. 
Therefore, we announced that hospitals 
could suppress the public reporting of 
the quality data for the two measures for 
hospital discharges starting with April 
1, 2007 discharges. We did this because 
we believe that hospitals should not be 
held to out-of-date consensus standards 
for public reporting pending the next 
regulatory cycle. 
We propose, in the future, to act on 
updates to existing RHQDAPU program 
measures made by a consensus building 
entity such as the NQF through a 
subregulatory process. This is necessary 
to be able to utilize the most up-to-date 
consensus standards in the RHQDAPU 
program, and recognizes that neither 
scientific advances nor consensus 
building entity standard updates are 
linked to the timing of regulatory 
actions. We propose to implement 
updates to existing RHQDAPU program 
measures and provide notification 
through the Qualitynet Web site, and 
additionally in the CMS/Joint 
Commission Specifications Manual for 
National Hospital Inpatient Quality 
Measures where data collection and 
measure specifications changes are 
necessary. We invite comment on this 
proposal. 
Under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(III) 
of the Act, the Secretary shall expand 
the RHQDAPU program measures 
beyond the measures specified as of 
November 1, 2003. Under section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(V) of the Act, these 
measures, to the extent feasible and 
practicable, shall include measures set 
forth by one or more national consensus 
building entities. 
We are proposing to add the following 
43 measures for the FY 2010 payment 
determination: a SCIP measure that we 
proposed last year; 4 nursing sensitive 
measures; 3 readmission measures; 6 
Venous Thromboembolism measures; 5 
stroke measures; 9 AHRQ measures; and 
15 cardiac surgery measures. 
We are proposing to add SCIP 
Cardiovascular 2, Surgery Patients on a 
Beta Blocker Prior to Arrival Who 
Received a Beta Blocker During the 
Perioperative Period. This measure was 
initially proposed last year in the FY 
2008 IPPS proposed rule, but because 
the NQF had not endorsed this measure

23648 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
at the time we issued the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period or the 
CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with 
comment period, we did not adopt it. 
For the purposes of proposing the FY 
2010 RHQDAPU program measure set, 
CMS believes that NQF endorsement of 
a measure represents a standard for 
consensus among affected parties as 
specified in section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(V) of the Act. The 
NQF is an independent health care 
quality endorsement organization with a 
diverse representation of consumer, 
purchaser, provider, academic, clinical, 
and other health care stakeholder 
organizations. 
In November 2007, the NQF endorsed 
SCIP Cardiovascular 2. CMS believes 
that this measure targets an important 
process of care, beta blocker 
administration for noncardiac surgery 
patients. Therefore, we are now 
proposing to add SCIP Cardiovascular 2 
to the RHQDAPU program measures for 
FY 2010. The specifications and data 
collection tools are currently available 
through the Qualitynet Web site and in 
the CMS/Joint Commission 
Specifications Manual for National 
Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures for 
hospitals to utilize and submit data for 
this measure. We are proposing that 
hospitals be required to submit data on 
this measure beginning with January 1, 
2009 discharges. 
We also are proposing to add four 
nursing sensitive measures to the 
RHQDAPU program measure set for FY 
2010. The four measures are: 
• Failure to Rescue 
• Pressure Ulcer Prevalence and 
Incidence by Severity (Joint 
Commission developed measure; all 
patient data from chart abstraction) 
• Patient Falls Prevalence 
• Patient Falls with Injury 
These measures broaden the ability of 
the RHQDAPU program measure set to 
assess care generally associated with 
nursing staff. In addition, these 
measures are directed toward outcomes 
that are underrepresented among the 
RHQDAPU program measures. These 
measures apply to the vast majority of 
inpatient stays and provide a great deal 
of critical information about hospital 
quality to consumers and stakeholders. 
The specifications and data collection 
tools are scheduled to be available in 
the specifications manual by December 
2008 for hospitals to utilize and submit 
data for these measures. We are 
proposing that hospitals be required to 
submit data on these four measures 
effective with discharges beginning 
April 1, 2009. While these measures are 
endorsed by NQF, the Joint Commission 
has initiated rigorous field testing of the 
measures, which may not be completed 
until late 2008. Therefore, it is possible 
that the endorsement status of these 
measures may change in the next 
several months. If this rigorous field 
testing results in uncertainty as to the 
NQF endorsement status at the time we 
issue the FY 2009 IPPS final rule, we 
will defer our final decision on whether 
to require these measures for the 
RHQDAPU program for FY 2010 until 
the time that we issue the CY 2009 
OPPS/ASC final rule with comment 
period. This deferral is consistent with 
our measure expansion during the past 
2 years, when we finalized some 
RHQDAPU program measures in the 
annual OPPS/ASC final rules. 
We are proposing to adopt three 
readmission measures for FY 2010 that 
will be calculated using Medicare 
administrative claims data. The 
proposed measures are: 
• Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Risk 
Standardized Readmission Measure 
(Medicare patients) 
• Heart Attack (AMI) 30-Day Risk 
Standardized Readmission Measure 
(Medicare patients) 
• Heart Failure (HF) 30-Day Risk 
Standardized Readmission Measure 
(Medicare patients) 
These readmission measures assess 
both quality of care and efficiency of 
care. They also promote coordination of 
care among hospitals and other 
providers. They compliment the 
existing 30-Day Risk Standardized 
Mortality Measures for Pneumonia, 
Heart Attack, and Heart Failure. These 
measures require no additional data 
collection from hospitals. The measures 
are risk adjusted to account for 
differences between hospitals in the 
characteristics of their patient 
populations. 
These three claims-based readmission 
measures are pending NQF 
endorsement. The NQF endorsement 
decision on these three measures is 
expected before we issue the FY 2009 
IPPS final rule. We are proposing to add 
these three measures contingent upon 
NQF endorsement. We are also 
proposing to defer our decision on 
whether to include these measures until 
we issue the CY 2009 OPPS/ASC final 
rule, in the event that NQF endorsement 
status is still pending when we issue the 
FY 2009 IPPS final rule. This deferral is 
consistent with our measure expansion 
during the past 2 years, when we 
finalized some RHQDAPU program 
measures in the annual OPPS/ASC final 
rules. 
We are also proposing to add six 
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) 
measures. These measures 
comprehensively address a major cause 
of morbidity and mortality among 
hospitalized patients. 
• VTE–1: VTE Prophylaxis 
• VTE–2: VTE Prophylaxis in the ICU 
• VTE–4: Patients with overlap in 
anticoagulation therapy 
• VTE–5/6: (as combined measure) 
Patients with UFH dosages who have 
platelet count monitoring and 
adjustment of medication per protocol 
or nomogram 
• VTE–7: Discharge instructions to 
address: follow-up monitoring, 
compliance, dietary restrictions and 
adverse drug reactions/interactions 
• VTE–8: Incidence of preventable 
VTE 
These VTE measures are pending 
NQF endorsement. The NQF 
endorsement decision on these 
measures is expected before we issue 
the FY 2009 IPPS final rule. We are 
proposing to add these measures 
contingent upon NQF endorsement. We 
also are proposing to defer our decision 
on whether to include these measures 
until we issue the CY 2009 OPPS/ASC 
final rule with comment period, in the 
event that NQF endorsement status is 
still pending when we issue the FY 
2009 IPPS final rule. This deferral is 
consistent with our measure expansion 
during the past 2 years, when we 
finalized some RHQDAPU program 
measures in the annual OPPS/ASC final 
rules. We are proposing that hospitals 
be required to submit data on these six 
measures effective with discharges 
beginning January 1, 2009. 
We also are proposing to add five 
Stroke measures that will apply only to 
certain identified groups under specific 
ICD–9–CM codes as specified in the 
specifications manual. These measures 
comprehensively address an important 
condition not currently covered by the 
RHQDAPU program that is associated 
with significant morbidity and 
mortality. 
• STK–1 DVT Prophylaxis 
• STK–2 Discharged on 
Antithrombotic Therapy 
• STK–3 Patients with Atrial 
Fibrillation Receiving Anticoagulation 
Therapy 
• STK–5 Antithrombotic Medication 
By End of Hospital Day Two 
• STK–7 Dysphasia Screening 
These Stroke measures are pending 
NQF endorsement. The NQF 
endorsement decision on these 
measures is expected before we issue 
the FY 2009 IPPS final rule. We are 
proposing to add these measures 
contingent upon NQF endorsement. We 
also are proposing to defer our adoption 
of these measures until we issue the CY 
2009 OPPS/ASC final rule with 
comment period in the event that NQF

endorsement status is still pending as of 
the time we issue the FY 2009 IPPS final 
rule. This approach is consistent with 
our measure expansion during the past 
2 years, when CMS finalized some 
RHQDAPU program measures in the 
annual OPPS/ASC final rules. We are 
proposing that hospitals be required to 
submit data on these five measures 
effective with discharges beginning July 
1, 2009. 
We also are proposing to add the 
following nine AHRQ Patient Safety 
Indicators (PSI) and Inpatient Quality 
Indicators (IQI) that have been endorsed 
by the NQF: 
• Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) 4— 
Death among surgical patients with 
treatable serious complications 
• PSI 6—Iatrogenic pneumothorax, 
adult 
• PSI 14—Postoperative wound 
dehiscence 
• PSI 15—Accidental puncture or 
laceration 
• Inpatient Quality Indicator (IQI) 4 
and 11—Abdominal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA) mortality rate (with or without 
volume) 
• IQI 19—Hip fracture morality rate 
• IQI Mortality for selected medical 
conditions (composite) 
• IQI Mortality for selected surgical 
procedures (composite) 
• IQI Complication/patient safety for 
selected indicators (composite) 
These are claims-based outcome 
measures. They are important additional 
measures that can be calculated for 
hospital inpatients without the burden 
of additional chart abstraction. 
Hospitals currently collect and submit 
these data to CMS and other insurers for 
reimbursement. These measures will be 
calculated using all-payer claims data 
that hospitals currently collect with 
respect to each patient discharge. We 
are proposing to require hospitals to 
submit to CMS the all-payer claims data 
that we specify in the technical 
specifications manual as necessary to 
calculate the AHRQ PSI/IQI measures. 
We are proposing that hospitals begin 
submitting data on a quarterly basis on 
these measures to CMS by April 1, 2010 
beginning with October 1, 2009 
discharges. 
However, we are aware that a large 
number of hospitals already submit 
these data on a voluntary basis to third 
party data aggregators such as State 
health agencies or State hospital 
associations. We seek comments on 
whether a hospital that already submits 
the data necessary to calculate these 
measures to such entities should be 
permitted to authorize such an entity to 
transmit these data to CMS, in 
accordance with applicable 
confidentiality laws, on their behalf. 
This would relieve the hospital of the 
burden of having to submit the same 
data directly to CMS via the QIO 
Clinical Warehouse. 
As an alternative to requiring that 
hospitals submit all-payer claims data 
for purposes of calculating the AHRQ 
PSI/IQI measures, CMS is considering 
whether it should initially calculate the 
AHRQ PSI/IQI measures using Medicare 
claims data only, and at a subsequent 
date require submission of all-payer 
claims data. We also seek comment on 
this alternative. 
We also are proposing to add 15 
cardiac surgery measures. Cardiac 
surgical procedures carry a significant 
risk of morbidity and mortality. We 
believe that the nationwide public 
reporting of these cardiac surgery 
measures would provide highly 
meaningful information for the public. 
Currently, over 85 percent of hospitals 
with a cardiac surgery program submit 
data on the proposed cardiac surgery 
measures listed below to the Society of 
Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Cardiac 
Surgery Clinical Data Registry. We are 
proposing to accept these data from the 
STS registry beginning on July 1, 2009, 
on a quarterly basis for discharges on or 
after January 1, 2009. Hospitals that 
participate in the RHQDAPU program, 
but that do not submit data on the 
proposed cardiac surgery measures to 
the STS registry for discharges on or 
after January 1, 2009, would need to 
submit such data to CMS. Although we 
would accept cardiac surgery data from 
other clinical data registries, we are 
unaware of any other registries that 
collect all of the data necessary to 
support calculation of the proposed 
cardiac surgery measures. Hospitals and 
CMS would need to establish 
appropriate legal arrangements, to the 
extent such arrangements are necessary, 
to ensure that the transfer of these data 
from the STS registry to CMS complies 
with all applicable laws. By accepting 
these registry-based data, only those 
hospitals with cardiac surgery programs 
that do not already collect such data to 
submit to the STS registry will have any 
additional data submission burden. All 
of the proposed measures are currently 
NQF-endorsed. We are proposing that 
hospitals begin submitting data by July 
1, 2009, on a quarterly basis on the 
following 15 cardiac surgery measures 
to the STS data registry or CMS for 1st 
quarter calendar year 2009 discharges: 
• Participation in a Systematic 
Database for Cardiac Surgery 
• Pre-Operative Beta Blockade 
• Prolonged Intubation 
• Deep Sternal Wound Infection Rate 
• Stroke/CVA 
• Post-Operative Renal Insufficiency 
• Surgical Reexploration 
• Anti-Platelet Medication at 
Discharge 
• Beta Blockade Therapy at Discharge 
• Anti-Lipid Treatment at Discharge 
• Risk-Adjusted Operative Mortality 
for CABG 
• Risk-Adjusted Operative Mortality 
for Aortic Valve Replacement 
• Risk-Adjusted Operative Mortality 
for Mitral Valve Replacement/Repair 
• Risk-Adjusted Mortality for Mitral 
Valve Replacement and CABG Surgery 
• Risk-Adjusted Mortality for Aortic 
Valve Replacement and CABG Surgery

In summary, we are proposing to 
increase the RHQDAPU program 
measures from 30 measures for FY 2009 
to a total of 72 measures for FY 2010. 
The following table lists the increase in 
the RHQDAPU program measure set 
since the program’s inception:

Topics covered 
2005–2006 ................................................................................................................... 10 AMI, HF, PN.

Nursing Sensitive, Readmission, VTE, 
Stroke, AHRQ IQI/PSI measures and 
composites, Cardiac Surgery. 
The above measures reflect our 
continuing commitment to quality 
improvement in both clinical care and 
patient safety. These additional 
measures also demonstrate our 
commitment to include in the 
RHQDAPU program only those quality 
measures that reflect consensus among 
the affected parties and that have been 
reviewed by a consensus building 
process. 
To the extent that the proposed 
measures have not already been 
endorsed by a consensus building entity 
such as the NQF, we anticipate that they 
will be endorsed prior to the time that 
we issue the FY 2009 IPPS final rule. 
We intend to finalize the FY 2010 
RHQDAPU program measure set in the 
FY 2009 IPPS final rule, contingent on 
the endorsement status of the proposed 
measures. However, to the extent that a 
measure has not received NQF 
endorsement by the time we issue the 
FY 2009 IPPS final rule, we intend to 
finalize that measure for the FY 2010 
RHQDAPU program measure set in the

b. Possible New Quality Measures, 
Measure Sets, and Program 
Requirements for FY 2011 and 
Subsequent Years 
The following table contains a list of 
59 measures and 4 measure sets from 
which additional quality measures 
could be selected for inclusion in the 
RHQDAPU program. It includes 
measures and measure sets that 
highlight CMS’ interest in improving 
patient safety and outcomes of care, 
with a particular focus on the quality of 
surgical care and patient outcomes. In 
order to engender a broad review of 
potential performance measures, the list 
includes measures that have not yet

been considered for approval by the 
HQA or endorsed by a consensus review 
process such as the NQF. It also 
includes measures developed by 
organizations other than CMS as well as 
measures that are to be derived from 
administrative data (such as claims) that 
may need to be modified for specific use 
by the Medicare program if 
implemented under the RHQDAPU 
program. 
We are seeking public comment on 
the measures and measure sets that are 
listed as well as any critical gaps or 
missing measures or measure sets. We 
specifically request input concerning 
the following: 
• Which of the measures or measure 
sets should be included in the 
RHQDAPU program for FY 2011 or in 
subsequent years? 
• What challenges for data collection 
and reporting are posed by the 
identified measures and measure sets? 
What improvements could be made to 
data collection or reporting that might 
offset or otherwise address those 
challenges? 
We are soliciting public comment on 
the following measure sets for 
consideration in FY 2011 and 
subsequent years:

c. Considerations in Expanding and 
Updating Quality Measures Under the 
RHQDAPU Program 
The RHQDAPU program has 
significantly expanded from an initial 
set of 10 measures to 30 measures for 
the FY 2009 payment determination. 
Initially, the conditions covered by the 
RHQDAPU program measures were 
limited to Acute Myocardial Infarction, 
Heart Failure, and Pneumonia, three 
high-cost and high-volume conditions. 
In expanding the process measures, 
Surgical Infection Prevention was the 
first additional focus, now 
supplemented by the two Venous 
Thromboembolism SCIP measures SCIP 
VTE–1 and SCIP VTE–2 for surgical 
patients. Of the 30 current measures, 27 
require data collection from chart 
abstraction and surveying patients and 
submission of detailed data elements. 
In looking forward to further 
expansion of the RHQDAPU program, 
we believe it is important to take several 
goals into consideration. These include: 
(a) Expanding the types of measures 
beyond process of care measures to 
include an increased number of 
outcome measures, efficiency measures, 
and experience-of-care measures; (b) 
expanding the scope of hospital services 
to which the measures apply; (c) 
considering the burden on hospitals in 
collecting chart-abstracted data; (d) 
harmonizing the measures used in the 
RHQDAPU program with other CMS 
quality programs to align incentives and 
promote coordinated efforts to improve 
quality; (e) seeking to use measures 
based on alternative sources of data that 
do not require chart abstraction or that 
utilize data already being broadly 
reported by hospitals, such as clinical 
data registries or all-payer claims data 
bases; and (f) weighing the 
meaningfulness and utility of the 
measures compared to the burden on 
hospitals in submitting data under the 
RHQDAPU program. 
We request comments on how to 
reduce burden on the hospitals 
participating in the RHQDAPU program. 
We realize that our proposal to expand 
the RHQDAPU program measure set 
from submission of 30 measures in FY 
2009 to 72 measures in FY 2010 is 
potentially burdensome. However, to 
minimize hospitals’ burden, the 
proposed expansion uses many existing

data sources, including Medicare claims 
and registry data. We also request 
comment about which measures would 
be most useful while minimizing 
burden. 
(1) Expanding the Types of Measures 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(III) of the 
Act requires the Secretary to add other 
quality measures that the Secretary 
determines to be appropriate for the 
measurement of the quality of care 
furnished by hospitals in inpatient 
settings. We intend to expand outcome 
measures such as mortality measures 
and measures of complications. For FY 
2010, the proposed measure set 
includes: 
• Patient Experience of Care. 
HCAHPS collects data regarding a 
patient’s experience of care in the 
hospital and provides a very meaningful 
perspective from the patient standpoint. 
• Efficiency. Efficiency is a Quality 
Domain, as defined by the IOM, that 
relates Quality and Cost. The three 
proposed readmission measures address 
hospital efficiency. These are 
considered efficiency measures because 
higher hospital readmission rates are 
linked to higher costs and also to lower 
quality of care received during 
hospitalization and after the initial 
hospital stay. We are also seeking 
additional ways in which to address 
efficiency. 
• Outcomes. The three 30-day 
mortality measures, the STS cardiac 
surgery measures, the AHRQ PSI/IQI 
measures, and the four outcome-related 
nursing sensitive measures represent 
significant expansion of the RHQDAPU 
program outcome measures. Additional 
outcome measures are provided in the 
list under consideration for inclusion in 
the RHQDAPU program for FY 2010 and 
beyond. 
(2) Expanding the Scope of Hospital 
Services To Which Measures Apply 
Many of the most common and high- 
cost Medicare DRGs were posted on the 
Hospital Compare Web site in March 
2008 as part of the President’s 
transparency initiative. We have 
assessed these DRGs and have found 
that the FY 2009 RHQDAPU program 
measure set does not capture data 
regarding care in important areas such 
as Inpatient Diabetes Care, Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), 
and Chest Pain. These are areas for 
which we currently do not have quality 
measures but which constitute a 
significant portion of the top paying 
DRGs for Medicare beneficiaries. We 
intend to develop measures in these 
areas in order to provide additional 
quality information on the most 
common and high-cost conditions that 
affect Medicare beneficiaries. In the 
proposed FY 2010 measure set, 
measures have been expanded to 
comprehensively address services 
related to preventing Venous 
Thromboembolism, treatment of stroke, 
and nursing services. 
(3) Considering the Burden on Hospitals 
in Collecting Chart-Abstracted Data for 
Measures 
Although we are proposing to add 
additional chart-abstracted measures for 
FY 2010, we also are proposing to 
stagger the dates for which data 
collection for these measures must 
begin, which we believe will lessen the 
burden on hospitals as they incorporate 
these new measures into their systems. 
We also intend to work to simplify the 
data abstraction specifications that add 
to the burden of data collection. 
(4) Harmonizing With Other CMS 
Programs 
We intend to harmonize measures 
across settings and other CMS programs 
as evidenced by the implementation of 
the readmission measures not only for 
the RHQDAPU program but also for the 
QIOs’ 9th Scope of Work (SOW) Patient 
Pathways/Care Transitions Theme, 
which also uses the 30-Day Readmission 
Measures and will provide assistance to 
engage hospitals in improving care. The 
9th SOW also focuses on disparities in 
health care, which is another important 
area of interest for CMS. We plan to 
analyze current RHQDAPU measures to 
identify particular RHQDAPU program 
measures needed to evaluate the 
existence of health care disparities, to 
require data elements that would 
support better identification of health 
care disparities, and to find more 
efficient ways to ascertain this 
information from claims data. In 
addition, at least some of the CY 2008 
Physician Quality Reporting Initiative 
(PQRI) measures align with the current 
RHQDAPU program AMI and SCIP 
measures reported starting with the FY 
2007 RHQDAPU measure set. In other 
words, there are financial incentives 
that cover the same clinical processes of 
care across different providers and 
settings. For example, Aspirin for Heart 
Attack corresponds to PQRI measure 
number 28, and Surgical Infection 
Antibiotic Timing corresponds to PQRI 
measure number 20. Outpatient quality 
measures under the Hospital Outpatient 
Data Quality Data Reporting Program 
(HOP QDRP) are also aligned with the 
RHQDAPU program measures. For 
example, the HOP QDRP addresses 
Acute Myocardial Infarction treatment 
for transferred patients and surgical 
infection prevention for outpatient 
surgery. 
(5) Using Alternative Data Sources Not 
Requiring Chart Abstraction 
We are actively pursuing alternative 
data sources, including data sources that 
are electronically maintained. 
Alternative data submission 
methodologies that we are proposing in 
this rule include: 
• Use of registry-collected clinical 
data for which there is broad existing 
hospital participation as previously 
described with the STS registry. 
• Use of data collected by State data 
organizations, State hospital 
associations, Federal entities such as 
AHRQ, and/or other data warehouses. 
In addition, we are considering 
adopting the following methods of data 
collection in the future and request 
comments on these methods: 
• Use of the CMS Continuity 
Assessment Record & Evaluation 
(CARE) tool, a standardized data 
collection instrument, which would 
allow data to be transmitted in ‘‘real 
time.’’ This recently developed, 
Internet-based, quality data collection 
tool was developed as a part of the Post 
Acute Care Reform Demonstration 
Program mandated by section 5008 of 
the DRA. The CARE tool consists of a 
core set of assessment items, common to 
all patients and all care settings 
(meeting criteria of being predictive of 
cost, utilization, outcomes, among 
others), organized under five major 
domains: Medical, Functional, Social, 
Environmental, and Cognitive— 
Continuity of Care. The Internet-based 
CARE tool will communicate critical 
information across settings accurately, 
quickly, and efficiently with reduced 
time burden to providers and is 
intended to enhance beneficiaries’ safe 
transitions between settings to prevent 
avoidable, costly events such as 
unnecessary rehospitalizations or 
medication errors. We believe that the 
CARE tool may provide a vehicle for 
collection of data elements to be used 
for calculating RHQDAPU program 
quality measures. CMS is considering 
utilizing the CARE tool in this manner. 
The Care tool is available at: 
www.cms.hhs.gov/PaperworkReduction
Actof1995/PRAL/list.asp#TopOfPage. 
(Viewers should select ‘‘Show only 
items with the word ‘‘10243’’, click on 
show items, select CMS–10243, click on 
downloads, and open Appendices A & 
B, pdf files.) 
We are particularly interested in 
receiving public comment on this tool. 
Our goal is to have a standardized, 
efficient, effective, interoperable, 
common assessment tool to capture key

patient characteristics that will help 
CMS capture information related to 
resource utilization; expected costs as 
well as clinical outcomes; and post- 
discharge disposition. The CARE tool 
will also be useful for guiding payment 
and quality policies. 
Specifically, we are interested in 
receiving public comments on how 
CARE might advance the use of health 
information technology in automating 
the process for collecting and 
submitting quality data. 
• Submission of data derived from 
electronic versions of laboratory test 
reports that are issued by the laboratory 
in accordance with CLIA to the ordering 
provider and maintained by the hospital 
as part of the patient’s medical record 
during and after the patient’s course of 
treatment at the hospital. We are 
considering using these data to support 
risk adjustment for claims-based 
outcome measures (for example, 
mortality measures) and to develop 
other outcomes measures. This would 
support use of electronically maintained 
data and our goal of reducing manual 
data collection burden on hospitals. 
• Submission of data currently being 
collected by clinical data registries in 
addition to the STS registry. This would 
support and leverage existing clinical 
data registries and existing voluntary 
clinical data collection efforts, such as: 
• American College of Cardiology 
(ACC) data registry for Cardiac 
Measures. 
• ACC data registry for ICD. 
• ACC data registry for Carotid Stents. 
• Vascular Surgery Registry for 
Vascular Surgical Procedures. 
• ACC-sponsored ‘‘Get with the 
Guidelines’’ registry for Stroke Care. 
(6) Weighing the Meaningfulness and 
Utility of the Measures Compared to the 
Burden on Hospitals in Submitting Data 
Under the RHQDAPU Program 
We are proposing to retire one 
measure from the RHQDAPU program 
for FY 2010 because we have 
determined that the burden on hospitals 
in abstracting the data outweighs the 
meaningful benefit that we can ascertain 
from the measure. As we explained 
more fully above, we are seeking 
comments on the applicability to the 
RHQDAPU program of criteria currently 
described in the Hospital VBP Issues 
Paper for inclusion and retirement of 
measures. The Hospital VBP Issues 
Paper is located on the CMS Web site at 
the following location: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/AcuteInpatientPPS/
downloads/hospital_VBP_plan_issues_
paper.pdf. 
3. Form and Manner and Timing of 
Quality Data Submission 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 
48031 through 48045), we set out 
RHQDAPU program procedures for data 
submission, program withdrawal, data 
validation, attestation, public display of 
hospitals’’ quality data, and 
reconsiderations. Section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(I) of the Act requires 
that subsection (d) hospitals submit data 
on measures selected under that clause 
with respect to the applicable fiscal 
year. In addition, section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(II) of the Act requires 
that each subsection (d) hospital submit 
data on measures selected under that 
clause to the Secretary in a form and 
manner, and at a time, specified by the 
Secretary. The technical specifications 
for each RHQDAPU program measure 
are listed in the CMS/Joint Commission 
Specifications Manual for National 
Inpatient Hospital Quality Measures 
(Specifications Manual). We update this 
manual semiannually or more 
frequently in unusual cases, and include 
detailed instructions and calculation 
algorithms for hospitals to collect and 
submit the data for the required 
measures. 
The maintenance of the specifications 
for the measures selected by the 
Secretary occurs through publication of 
the Specifications Manual. Thus, 
measure selection by the Secretary 
occurs through the rulemaking process; 
whereas the maintenance of the 
technical specifications for the selected 
measures occurs through a 
subregulatory process so as to best 
maintain the specifications consistent 
with current science and consensus. 
The data submission, Specifications 
Manual, and submission deadlines are 
posted on the QualityNet Web site at 
www.qualitynet.org. We require that 
hospitals submit data in accordance 
with the specifications for the 
appropriate discharge periods. When 
measure specifications are updated, we 
are proposing to require that hospitals 
submit all of the data required to 
calculate the required measures as 
outlined in the Specifications Manual 
current as of the patient discharge date. 
4. Current and Proposed RHQDAPU 
Program Procedures 
a. RHQDAPU Program Procedures for 
FY 2009 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we stated that the 
requirements for FY 2008 would 
continue to apply for FY 2009 (72 FR 
47361). The ‘‘Reporting Hospital Quality 
Data for Annual Payment Update 
Reference Checklist’’ section of the 
QualityNet Web site contains all of the 
forms to be completed by hospitals 
participating in the RHQDAPU program. 
Under these requirements hospitals 
must— 
• Register with QualityNet, before 
participating hospitals initially begin 
reporting data, regardless of the method 
used for submitting data. 
› Identify a QualityNet 
Administrator who follows the 
registration process located on the 
QualityNet Web site 
(www.qualitynet.org). 
› Complete the revised RHQDAPU 
program Notice of Participation form 
(only for hospitals that did not submit 
a form prior to August 15, 2007). For 
hospitals that share the same Medicare 
Provider Number (now CMS 
Certification Number (CCN)), report the 
name and address of each hospital on 
this form. 
› Collect and report data for each of 
the required measures except the 
Medicare mortality measures (AMI, HF, 
and PN 30-day Mortality for Medicare 
Patients). Hospitals must continuously 
report these data. Hospitals must submit 
the data to the QIO Clinical Warehouse 
using the CMS Abstraction & Reporting 
Tool (CART), The Joint Commission 
ORYX Core Measures Performance 
Measurement System, or another third- 
party vendor tool that has met the 
measurement specification requirements 
for data transmission to QualityNet. All 
submissions will be executed through 
QualityNet. Because the information in 
the QIO Clinical Warehouse is 
considered QIO information, it is 
subject to the stringent QIO 
confidentiality regulations in 42 CFR 
Part 480. The QIO Clinical Warehouse 
will submit the data to CMS on behalf 
of the hospitals. 
• Submit complete data regarding the 
quality measures in accordance with the 
joint CMS/Joint Commission sampling 
requirements located on the QualityNet 
Web site for each quality measure that 
requires hospitals to collect and report 
data. These requirements specify that 
hospitals must submit a random sample 
or complete population of cases for each 
of the topics covered by the quality 
measures. Hospitals must meet the 
sampling requirements for these quality 
measures for discharges in each quarter. 
• Submit to CMS on a quarterly basis 
aggregate population and sample size 
counts for Medicare and non-Medicare 
discharges for the four topic areas (AMI, 
HF, PN, and SCIP). 
• Continuously collect and submit 
HCAHPS data in accordance with the 
HCAHPS Quality Assurance Guidelines, 
Version 3.0, located at the Web site: 
www.hcahpsonline.org. The QIO

Clinical Warehouse has been modified 
to accept zero HCAHPS-eligible 
discharges. We remind the public to 
refer to the QualityNet Web site for any 
questions about how to submit ‘‘zero 
cases’’ information. 
For the AMI 30-day, HF 30-day, and 
PN 30-day mortality measures, CMS 
uses Part A and Part B claims for 
Medicare fee-for-service patients to 
calculate the mortality measures. For FY 
2009, hospital inpatient claims (Part A) 
from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, will 
be used to identify the relevant patients 
and the index hospitalizations. Inpatient 
claims for the index hospitalizations 
and Part A and Part B claims for all 
inpatient, outpatient, and physician 
services received one year prior to the 
index hospitalizations are used to 
determine patient comorbidity, which is 
used in the risk adjustment calculation 
(see the Web site: www.qualitynet.org/
dcs/ContentServer?cid=1163010398556
&pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2F
QnetTier2&c=Page). No other hospital 
data submission is required to calculate 
the mortality rates. 
b. Proposed RHQDAPU Program 
Procedures for FY 2010 
We are proposing to continue 
requiring the FY 2009 RHQDAPU 
program procedures for FY 2010 for 
hospitals participating in the RHQDAPU 
program, with the following 
modifications: 
• Notice of Participation. New 
subsection (d) hospitals and existing 
hospitals that wish to participate in 
RHQDAPU for the first time must 
complete a revised ‘‘Reporting Hospital 
Quality Data for Annual Payment 
Update Notice of Participation’’ that 
includes the name and address of each 
hospital that shares the same CCN. 
• Data Submission. In order to reduce 
the burden on hospitals that treat a low 
number of patients who are covered by 
the submission requirements, we are 
proposing the following: 
› AMI. We are proposing that a 
hospital that has five or fewer AMI 
discharges (both Medicare and non- 
Medicare combined) in a quarter will 
not be required to submit AMI patient 
level data for that quarter. We are 
proposing to begin implementing this 
requirement with discharges on or after 
January 1, 2009. However, the hospital 
must still submit its aggregate AMI 
population and sample size counts to 
CMS for that quarter as part of its 
quarterly RHQDAPU data submission. 
› HCAHPS. We are proposing that a 
hospital that has five or fewer HCAHPS- 
eligible discharges in any month will 
not be required to submit HCAHPS 
surveys for that month. However, the 
hospital must still submit its total 
number of HCAHPS-eligible cases for 
that month as part of its quarterly 
HCAHPS data submission. We are 
proposing to begin implementing this 
requirement with discharges on or after 
January 1, 2009. 
› HF. We are proposing that a 
hospital that has five or fewer HF 
discharges (both Medicare and non- 
Medicare combined) in a quarter will 
not be required to submit HF patient 
level data for that quarter. However, the 
hospital must still submit its aggregate 
HF population and sample size counts 
to CMS for that quarter as part of its 
quarterly RHQDAPU data submission. 
We are proposing to begin 
implementing this requirement with 
discharges on or after January 1, 2009. 
› PN. We are proposing that a 
hospital that has five or fewer PN 
discharges (both Medicare and non- 
Medicare combined) in a quarter will 
not be required to submit PN patient 
level data for that quarter. However, the 
hospital must still submit its aggregate 
PN population and sample size counts 
to CMS for that quarter as part of its 
quarterly RHQDAPU data submission. 
We are proposing to begin 
implementing this requirement with 
discharges on or after January 1, 2009. 
› SCIP. We are proposing that a 
hospital that has five or fewer SCIP 
discharges (both Medicare and non- 
Medicare combined) in a quarter will 
not be required to submit SCIP patient 
level data for that quarter. However, the 
hospital must still submit its aggregate 
SCIP population and sample size counts 
to CMS for that quarter as part of its 
quarterly RHQDAPU data submission. 
We are proposing to begin 
implementing this requirement with 
discharges on or after January 1, 2009. 
In addition, we are proposing the 
following quarterly deadlines for 
hospitals to submit the FY 2010 AMI, 
HF, SCIP, PN, Stroke, VTE, and nursing 
sensitive measure data: 
• The data submission deadline for 
hospitals to submit the patient level 
measure data for 1st calendar quarter of 
2009 discharges would be August 15, 
2009. Data must be submitted for each 
of these measures 4.5 months after the 
end of the preceding quarter. The 
specific deadlines will be listed on the 
QualityNet Web site. 
• Even though data on applicable 
measures will not be due until 4.5 
months after the end of the preceding 
quarter, hospitals must submit their 
aggregate population and sample size 
counts no later than 4 months after the 
end of the preceding quarter (the exact 
dates will be posted on the QualityNet 
Web site). This deadline falls 
approximately 15 days before the data 
submission deadline for the clinical 
process measures, and we are proposing 
it so that we can inform hospitals about 
their data submission status for the 
quarter before the 4.5 month clinical 
process measure deadline. We have 
found from past experience that 
hospitals need sufficient time to submit 
additional data when their counts differ 
from Medicare claims counts generated 
by CMS. We will provide hospitals with 
these Medicare claims counts and 
submitted patient level data counts on 
the QualityNet Web site approximately 
2 weeks before the quarterly submission 
deadline. We plan to use the aggregate 
population and sample size data to 
assess submission completeness and 
adherence to sampling requirements for 
Medicare and non-Medicare patients. 
We propose the following quarterly 
deadlines for hospitals to submit cardiac 
surgery and the AHRQ PSI/IQI measure 
data to CMS or other entities: 
• The data submission deadline for 
hospitals to submit cardiac surgery 
patient level measure data to CMS or 
STS data registry for 1st calendar 
quarter of 2009 discharges would be 
June 1, 2009. Data must be submitted for 
each of these measures 2 months after 
the end of the preceding quarter. The 
specific deadlines will be listed on the 
QualityNet Web site. 
• The data submission deadline for 
hospitals to submit the AHRQ PSI/IQI 
measure data to CMS for 4th calendar 
quarter of 2009 discharges would be 
April 1, 2010. Data must be submitted 
for each of these measures 3 months 
after the end of the preceding quarter. 
The specific deadlines will be listed on 
the QualityNet Web site. 
We are proposing these quarterly 
submission deadlines for cardiac 
surgery and AHRQ PSI/IQI measure data 
to coordinate submission deadlines with 
external data registries and provide 
more timely information to the 
consumers. We are proposing this 
quarterly submission deadline for 
cardiac surgery measure data to 
coincide with the STS quarterly 
submission deadline that is 
approximately 2 months following the 
discharge quarter. We also propose to 
shorten the time lag between the date of 
discharge and the public reporting of 
these quality measures to provide more 
timely consumer information. 
5. Current and Proposed HCAHPS 
Requirements

Warehouse by the data submission 
deadlines posted on the Web site at: 
www.hcahpsonline.org. The data 
submission deadline for first quarter CY 
2008 (January through March) 
discharges is July 9, 2008. To collect 
HCAHPS data, a hospital can either 
contract with an approved HCAHPS 
survey vendor that will conduct the 
survey and submit data on the hospital’s 
behalf to the QIO Clinical Warehouse, or 
a hospital can self-administer the survey 
without using a survey vendor, 
provided that the hospital meets 
Minimum Survey Requirements as 
specified on the Web site at: 
www.hcahpsonline.org. A current list of 
approved HCAHPS survey vendors can 
be found on the Web site at: 
www.hcahpsonline.org. 
Every hospital choosing to contract 
with a survey vendor should provide 
the sample frame of hospital-eligible 
discharges to its survey vendor with 
sufficient time to allow the survey 
vendor to begin contacting each 
sampled patient within 6 weeks of 
discharge from the hospital (see the 
Quality Assurance Guidelines for details 
about HCAHPS eligibility and sample 
frame creation) and must authorize the 
survey vendor to submit data via 
QualityNet on the hospital’s behalf. 
CMS strongly recommends that the 
hospitals employing a survey vendor 
promptly review the two HCAHPS 
Feedback Reports (the Provider Survey 
Status Summary Report and the Data 
Submission Detail Report) that are 
available after the survey vendor 
submits the data to the QIO Clinical 
Warehouse. These reports enable a 
hospital to ensure that its survey vendor 
has submitted the data on time and it 
has been accepted into the Warehouse. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47362), we 
stated that hospitals and survey vendors 
must participate in a quality oversight 
process conducted by the HCAHPS 
project team. Starting in July 2007, we 
began asking hospitals/survey vendors 
to correct any problems that were found 
and provide followup documentation of 
corrections for review within a defined 
time period. If the HCAHPS project 
team finds that the hospital has not 
made these corrections, CMS may 
determine that the hospital is not 
submitting HCAHPS data that meet the 
requirements for the RHQDAPU 
program. As part of these activities, 
HCAHPS project staff reviews and 
discusses with survey vendors and 
hospitals self-administering the survey 
their specific Quality Assurance Plans, 
survey management procedures, 
sampling and data collection protocols, 
and data preparation and submission 
procedures. 
b. Proposed FY 2010 HCAHPS 
Requirements 
For FY 2010, we are proposing 
continuous collection of HCAHPS in 
accordance with the Quality Assurance 
Guidelines located at the Web site: 
www.hcahpsonline.org, by the quarterly 
data submission deadlines posted on the 
Web site: www.hcahpsonline.org. As 
stated above, starting with January 1, 
2009 discharges, we are proposing that 
hospitals that have five or fewer 
HCAHPS-eligible discharges in a month 
would not be required to submit 
HCAHPS patient-level data for that 
month as part of the quarterly data 
submission that includes that month, 
but they would still be required to 
submit the number of HCAHPS-eligible 
cases for that month as part of their 
HCAHPS quarterly data submission. 
With respect to HCAHPS oversight, 
we are proposing that the HCAHPS 
Project Team will continue to conduct 
site visits and/or conference calls with 
hospitals/survey vendors to ensure the 
hospital’s compliance with the HCAHPS 
requirements. During the onsite visit or 
conference call, the HCAHPS Project 
Team will review the hospital’s/survey 
vendor’s survey systems and will assess 
protocols based upon the most recent 
Quality Assurance Guidelines. All 
materials relevant to survey 
administration will be subject to review. 
The systems and program review 
includes, but it is not necessarily 
limited to: (a) survey management and 
data systems; (b) printing and mailing 
materials and facilities; (c) telephone/ 
IVR materials and facilities; (d) data 
receipt, entry and storage facilities; and 
(e) written documentation of survey 
processes. Organizations will be given a 
defined time period in which to correct 
any problems and provide followup 
documentation of corrections for 
review. Hospitals/survey vendors will 
be subject to followup site visits and/or 
conference calls, as needed. If CMS 
determines that a hospital is 
noncompliant with HCAHPS program 
requirements, CMS may determine that 
the hospital is not submitting HCAHPS 
data that meet the requirements of the 
RHQDAPU program. 
6. Current and Proposed Chart 
Validation Requirements 
a. Chart Validation Requirements for FY 
2009 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47361), we 
stated that, until further notice, we 
would continue to require that hospitals 
meet the chart validation requirements 
that we implemented in the FY 2006 
IPPS final rule (70 FR 47421 and 47422). 
These requirements, as well as 
additional information on validation 
requirements, continue and are being 
placed on the QualityNet Web site. 
We also stated in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period that, 
until further notice, hospitals must pass 
our validation requirement that requires 
a minimum of 80-percent reliability, 
based upon our chart-audit validation 
process (72 FR 47361). 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47362), we 
indicated that, for the FY 2009 update, 
all FY 2008 validation requirements 
would apply, except for the following 
modifications. We would modify the 
validation requirement to pool the 
quarterly validation estimates for 4th 
quarter CY 2006 through 3rd quarter 
2007 discharges. We would also expand 
the list of validated measures in the FY 
2009 update to add SCIP Infection-2, 
SCIP VTE–1, and SCIP VTE–2 (starting 
with 4th quarter CY 2006 discharges). 
We would also drop the current two- 
step process to determine if the hospital 
is submitting validated data. For the FY 
2009 update, we stated that we will pool 
validation estimates covering the four 
quarters (4th quarter CY 2006 discharges 
through 3rd quarter 2007 discharges) in 
a similar manner to the current 3rd 
quarter pooled confidence interval. 
In summary, the following chart 
validation requirements apply for the 
FY 2009 RHQDAPU program: 
• The 21-measure expanded set will 
be validated using 4th quarter CY 2006 
(4Q06) through 3rd quarter CY 2007 
(3Q07) discharges. 
• SCIP VTE-1, VTE-2, and SCIP 
Infection 2 will be validated using 2nd 
quarter CY 2007 and 3rd quarter CY 
2007 discharges. 
• SCIP Infection 4 and SCIP Infection 
6 must be submitted starting with 1st 
quarter CY 2008 discharges but will not 
be validated. 
• HCAHPS data must continuously be 
submitted and will be reviewed as 
discussed above. 
• AMI, HF, and PN 30-day mortality 
measures will be calculated as 
discussed below. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47364), we 
stated that, for the FY 2008 update and 
in subsequent years, we would revise 
and post up-to-date confidence interval 
information on the QualityNet Web site 
explaining the application of the 
confidence interval to the overall 
validation results. The data are being 
validated at several levels. There are 
consistency and internal edit checks to

ensure the integrity of the submitted 
data; there are external edit checks to 
verify expectations about the volume of 
the data received. 
b. Proposed Chart Validation 
Requirements for FY 2010 
For FY 2010, we are proposing the 
following chart validation requirements 
to reflect the proposed 72-measure set: 
• The following 21 measures from the 
FY 2009 RHQDAPU program measure 
set will be validated using data from 4th 
quarter 2007 through 3rd quarter 2008 
discharges. 
Topic Quality measure validated from 4th quarter 2007 through 3rd quarter 2008 discharges 
Heart Attack (Acute Myocardial Infarction) .............................................. Aspirin at arrival 
Aspirin prescribed at discharge 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACE–I) or Angiotensin II Re-
ceptor Blocker (ARB) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
Beta blocker at arrival

Fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agent received within 30 minutes of hospital 
arrival 
Adult smoking cessation advice/counseling 
Heart Failure (HF) .................................................................................... Left ventricular function assessment 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACE–I) or Angiotensin II Re-
ceptor Blocker (ARB) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
Discharge instructions 
Adult smoking cessation advice/counseling 
Pneumonia (PN) ....................................................................................... Pneumococcal vaccination status 
Blood culture performed before first antibiotic received in hospital 
Adult smoking cessation advice/counseling 
Appropriate initial antibiotic selection 
Influenza vaccination status

prior to July 2006 (3Q06).
Prophylactic antibiotic received within 1 hour prior to surgical incision 
SCIP–VTE–1: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis ordered for 
surgery patients*** 
SCIP–VTE–2: VTE prophylaxis within 24 hours pre/post surgery*** 
SCIP Infection 2: Prophylactic antibiotic selection for surgical 
patients*** 
SCIP-Infection 3: Prophylactic antibiotics discontinued within 24 hours 
after surgery end time 
• SCIP Infection 4 and Infection 6 
will be validated using data from 2nd 
and 3rd quarter CY 2008 discharges. 
In addition, we are proposing to 
include the following three measures in 
the FY 2010 RHQDAPU program 
validation process that are included the 
FY 2009 RHQDAPU program measure 
set but have been updated or deleted for 
the FY 2010 measure set: 
• Pneumonia antibiotic prophylaxis 
timing within 4 hours will be validated 
using data from 4th quarter 2007 
through 3rd quarter 2008 discharges. 
• Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 
(PCI) Timing within 120 minutes will be 
validated using data from 4th quarter 
2007 through 3rd quarter 2008 
discharges. 
• Pneumonia Oxygenation 
Assessment will be validated using data 
from 4th quarter through 3rd quarter 
2008 discharges. 
These measures will be submitted by 
hospitals during 2008 and early 2009, 
and are available to be validated by 
CMS in time for the FY 2010 RHQDAPU 
program payment eligibility 
determination. 
As explained above, will also revise 
and post up-to-date confidence interval 
information on the QualityNet Web site 
explaining the application of the 
confidence interval to the overall 
validation results. 
c. Chart Validation Methods and 
Requirements Under Consideration for 
FY 2011 and Subsequent Years 
Under the current and proposed 
RHQDAPU program chart validation 
process, we validate measures by 
reabstracting on a quarterly basis a 
random sample of five patient records 
for each hospital. This quarterly sample 
results in an annual combined sample of 
20 patient records across 4 calendar 
quarters, but because the samples are 
random, they do not necessarily include 
patient records covering each of the 
clinical topics. 
We anticipate that the proposed 
expansion of the RHQDAPU program 
measure set to include additional 
clinical topics will decrease the 
percentage of RHQDAPU clinical topics, 
as well as the total number of measures, 
covered in many hospitals’ annual chart 
validation. In addition to the measures 
for which hospitals must submit data for 
FY 2009 (with the exception of the 
Pneumonia Oxygenation Assessment 
measure), we have proposed that 
hospitals will submit data on the 
proposed five stroke measures, six VTE 
measures, and four nursing sensitive 
measures for FY 2010 using chart 
abstraction. CMS is considering the 
addition of these measures to the 
current RHQDAPU program validation 
process for FY 2011 and future years. 
However, we are considering whether 
registries and other external parties that 
may be collecting data on proposed 
RHQDAPU program measures could 
validate the accuracy of those measures 
beginning in FY 2011. In addition, we 
note that the proposed readmission 
measures are calculated using Medicare 
claims information and do not require 
chart validation. 
We are interested in receiving public 
comments from a broad set of 
stakeholders on the impact of adding 
measures to the validation process, as 
well as modifications to the current 
validation process that could improve

the reliability and validity of the 
methodology. We specifically request 
input concerning the following: 
• Which of the measures or measure 
sets should be included in the FY 2010 
RHQDAPU program chart validation 
process or in the chart validation 
process for subsequent years? 
• What validation challenges are 
posed by the RHQDAPU program 
measures and measure sets? What 
improvements could be made to 
validation or reporting that might offset 
or otherwise address those challenges? 
• Should CMS switch from its current 
quarterly validation sample of five 
charts per hospital to randomly 
selecting a sample of hospitals, and 
selecting more charts on an annual basis 
to improve reliability of hospital level 
validation estimates? 
• Should CMS select the validation 
sample by clinical topic to ensure that 
all publicly reported measures are 
covered by the validation sample? 
7. Data Attestation Requirements 
a. Proposed Change to Requirements for 
FY 2009 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47364), we 
stated that we would require for FY 
2008 and subsequent years that 
hospitals attest each quarter to the 
completeness and accuracy of their data, 
including the volume of data, submitted 
to the QIO Clinical Warehouse in order 
to improve aspects of the validation 
checks. We stated that we would 
provide additional information to 
explain this attestation requirement, as 
well as provide the relevant form to be 
completed on the QualityNet Web site, 
at the same time as the publication of 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period. 
We are now proposing to defer the 
requirement in FY 2009 for hospitals to 
separately attest to the accuracy and 
completeness of their submitted data 
due to the burden placed on hospitals 
to report paper attestation forms on a 
quarterly basis. We continue to expect 
that hospitals will submit quality data 
that are accurate to the best of their 
knowledge and ability. 
b. Proposed Requirements for FY 2010 
For FY 2010 and subsequent years, we 
are soliciting public comment on the 
electronic implementation of the 
attestation requirement at the point of 
data submission to the QIO Clinical 
Warehouse. Hospitals would 
electronically pledge to CMS that their 
submitted data are accurate and 
complete to the best of their knowledge. 
Hospitals would be required to 
designate an authorized contact to CMS 
for attestation in their patient-level data 
submission. 
Resubmissions would continue to be 
allowed before the quarterly submission 
deadline, and hospitals would be 
required to electronically update their 
pledges about data accuracy at the time 
of resubmission. We welcome 
comments on this approach. 
8. Public Display Requirements 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(VII) of the 
Act provides that the Secretary shall 
establish procedures for making data 
submitted under the RHQDAPU 
program available to the public. The 
RHQDAPU program quality measures 
are posted on the Hospital Compare 
Web site (http:// 
www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov). CMS 
requires that hospitals sign a ‘‘Reporting 
Hospital Quality Data for Annual 
Payment Update Notice of 
Participation’’ form when they first 
register to participate in the RHQDAPU 
program. Once a hospital has submitted 
a form, the hospital is considered to be 
an active RHQDAPU program 
participant until such time as the 
hospital submits a withdrawal form to 
CMS (72 FR 47360). Hospitals signing 
this form agree that they will allow CMS 
to publicly report the quality measures 
as required in the applicable year’s 
RHQDAPU program requirements. 
We are proposing to continue to 
display quality information for public 
viewing as required by section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(VII) of the Act. Before 
we display this information, hospitals 
will be permitted to review their 
information as recorded in the QIO 
Clinical Warehouse. 
Currently, hospitals that share the 
same CCN (formerly known as Medicare 
Provider Number (MPN)) must combine 
data collection and submission across 
their multiple campuses (for both 
clinical measures and for HCAHPS). 
These measures are then publicly 
reported as if they apply to a single 
hospital. We estimate that 
approximately 5 to 10 percent of the 
hospitals reported on the Hospital 
Compare Web site share CCNs. 
Beginning with the FY 2008 RHQDAPU 
program, hospitals must report the name 
and address of each hospital that shares 
the same CCN. This information will be 
gathered through the RHQDAPU 
program Notice of Participation form for 
new hospitals participating in the 
RHQDAPU program. To increase 
transparency in public reporting and 
improve the usefulness of the Hospital 
Compare Web site, we will note on the 
Web site where publicly reported 
measures combine results from two or 
more hospitals. 
9. Proposed Reconsideration and 
Appeal Procedures 
For FY 2009, we are proposing to 
continue the current RHQDAPU 
program reconsideration and appeal 
procedures finalized in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period. 
The deadline for submitting a request 
for reconsideration in connection with 
the FY 2009 payment determination is 
November 1, 2008. We also are 
proposing to use the same procedural 
rules finalized in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
47365). We posted these rules on the 
QualityNet Web site for the FY 2008 
RHQDAPU program reconsideration 
process. 
Under the procedural rules, in order 
to receive reconsideration for FY 2009, 
the hospital must— 
• Submit to CMS, via QualityNet, a 
Reconsideration Request form (available 
on the QualityNet Web site) containing 
the following information: 
Æ Hospital Medicare ID number. 
Æ Hospital Name. 
Æ CMS-identified reason for failure 
(as provided in the CMS notification of 
failure letter to the hospital). 
Æ Hospital basis for requesting 
reconsideration. (This must identify the 
hospital’s specific reason(s) for 
believing it met the RHQDAPU program 
requirements and should receive the full 
FY 2009 IPPS annual payment update.) 
Æ CEO contact information, including 
name, e-mail address, telephone 
number, and mailing address (must 
include physical address, not just the 
post office box). 
Æ QualityNet System Administrator 
contact information, including name, e- 
mail address, telephone number, and 
mailing address (must include physical 
address, not just the post office box). 
• The request must be signed by the 
hospital’s CEO. 
• Following receipt of a request for 
reconsideration, CMS will— 
• Provide an e-mail 
acknowledgement, using the contact 
information provided in the 
reconsideration request, to the CEO and 
the QualityNet Administrator that the 
letter has been received. 
• Provide a formal response to the 
hospital CEO, using the contact 
information provided in the 
reconsideration request, notifying the 
facility of the outcome of the 
reconsideration process. CMS expects 
the process to take 60 to 90 days from 
the due date of November 1, 2008. 
If a hospital is dissatisfied with the 
result of a RHQDAPU program

reconsideration decision, the hospital 
may file a claim under 42 CFR part 405, 
subpart R (a Provider Reimbursement 
Review Board (PRRB) appeal). 
10. Proposed RHQDAPU Program 
Withdrawal Deadline for FYs 2009 and 
2010 
We propose to accept RHQDAPU 
program withdrawal forms for FY 2009 
from hospitals through August 15, 2008. 
We are proposing this deadline to 
provide CMS with sufficient time to 
update the RHQDAPU FY 2009 payment 
to hospitals starting on October 1, 2008. 
If a hospital withdraws from the 
program for FY 2009, it will receive a 
2.0 percentage point reduction in its FY 
2009 annual payment update. 
We also propose to accept RHQDAPU 
program withdrawal forms for FY 2010 
from hospitals through August 15, 2009. 
If a hospital withdraws from the 
program for FY 2010, it will receive a 
2.0 percentage point reduction in its FY 
2010 annual payment update. 
11. Requirements for New Hospitals 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47366), we 
stated that a new hospital that receives 
a provider number on or after October 
1 of each year (beginning with October 
1, 2007) will be required to report 
RHQDAPU program data beginning with 
the first day of the quarter following the 
date the hospital registers to participate 
in the RHQDAPU program. For 
example, a hospital that receives its 
CCN on October 2, 2008, and signs up 
to participate in the RHQDAPU program 
on November 1, 2007, will be expected 
to meet all of the data submission 
requirements for discharges on or after 
January 1, 2009. 
In addition, we strongly recommend 
that each new hospital participate in an 
HCAHPS dry run, if feasible, prior to 
beginning to collect HCAHPS data on an 
ongoing basis to meet RHQDAPU 
program requirements. We refer readers 
to the Web site at 
www.hcahpsonline.org for a schedule of 
upcoming dry runs. The dry run will 
give newly participating hospitals the 
opportunity to gain first-hand 
experience collecting and transmitting 
HCAHPS data without the public 
reporting of results. Using the official 
survey instrument and the approved 
modes of administration and data 
collection protocols, hospitals/survey 
vendors will collect HCAHPS data and 
submit the data to QualityNet. 
12. Electronic Medical Records 
In the FY 2006 IPPS final rule, we 
encouraged hospitals to take steps 
toward the adoption of electronic 
medical records (EMRs) that will allow 
for reporting of clinical quality data 
from the EMRs directly to a CMS data 
repository (70 FR 47420). We intend to 
begin working toward creating 
measures’ specifications, and a system 
or mechanism, or both, that will accept 
the data directly without requiring the 
transfer of the raw data into an XML file 
as is currently done. The Department 
continues to work cooperatively with 
other Federal agencies in the 
establishment of Federal Health 
Architecture (FHA) data standards. We 
encouraged hospitals that are 
developing systems to conform them to 
industry standards, and in particular to 
FHA data standards, once identified, 
taking measures to ensure that the data 
necessary for quality measures are 
captured. Ideally, such systems will also 
provide point-of-care decision support 
that enables detection of high levels of 
performance on the measures. Hospitals 
using EMRs to produce data on quality 
measures will be held to the same 
performance expectations as hospitals 
not using EMRs. 
Due to the low volume of comments 
we received on this issue in response to 
the FY 2006 proposed IPPS rule, in the 
FY 2007 IPPS proposed (71 FR 24095), 
we again invited public comment on 
these requirements and related options. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 
48045), we summarized and addressed 
the additional comments we received. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule (72 
FR 24809), we noted that we would 
welcome additional comments on this 
issue. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47366), we 
responded to the additional comments 
we received and noted that CMS plans 
to continue working with the American 
Health Information Community (AHIC) 
and other entities to explore processes 
through which an EMR could speed the 
collection and minimize the resources 
necessary for quality reporting. (The 
AHIC is a Federal advisory body, 
chartered in 2005 to make 
recommendations to the Secretary on 
how to accelerate the development and 
adoption of health information 
technology.) In addition, we noted that 
we will continue to participate in 
appropriate HHS studies and 
workgroups, as mentioned by a GAO 
report (GAO–07–320) about hospital 
quality data and their use of information 
technology. As appropriate, CMS will 
inform interested parties regarding 
progress in the implementation of HIT 
for the collection and submission of 
hospital quality data as specific steps, 
including timeframes and milestones, 
are identified. Current mechanisms 
include publication in the Federal 
Register as well as ongoing 
collaboration with external stakeholders 
such as the HQA, the AHA, the FAH, 
the AAMC, and the Joint Commission. 
We further anticipate that as HIT is 
implemented, a formal plan, including 
training, will be developed to assist 
providers in understanding and 
utilizing HIT in reporting quality data. 
In addition, we will assess the 
effectiveness of our communications 
with providers and stakeholders as it 
relates to all information dissemination 
pertinent to collecting hospital quality 
data as part of an independent and 
comprehensive external evaluation of 
the RHQDAPU program. 
We are again soliciting comments on 
the issues and challenges associated 
with EMRs. Specifically, we invite 
comment on our proposed changes to 
our data submission requirements to be 
more aligned with currently 
implemented HIT systems, including 
data collection from registries and 
laboratory data. 
We recognize the potential burden on 
hospitals of increased data reporting 
requirements for process measures that 
require chart abstraction. In FY 2007 
IPPS rulemaking, we listed a variety of 
additional possible measures for future 
years. The measures included and 
emphasized additional outcomes 
measures. Additional measures were 
included for which the data sources are 
claims. For these, no additional data 
abstraction or submission would be 
required for reporting hospitals beyond 
the claims data. In proposing measures 
for FY 2010, we seek to emphasize 
outcome measures and to minimize any 
additional data collection burden. In 
addition, as provided in section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(VI) and discussed in 
section IV.B.2.a. of this proposed rule, 
we are proposing to retire one measure 
where there is no meaningful difference 
among hospitals as a means of reducing 
data collection burden. 
C. Medicare Hospital Value-Based 
Purchasing (VBP) 
1. Medicare Hospital VBP Plan Report to 
Congress 
Through section 5001(b) of the Deficit 
Reduction Act of 2005, Congress 
authorized the development of a plan to 
implement value-based purchasing 
(VBP) beginning FY 2009 for IPPS 
hospital services. By statute, the plan 
must address: (a) The ongoing 
development, selection, and 
modification process for measures of 
quality and efficiency in hospital 
inpatient settings; (b) reporting, 
collection, and validation of quality

data; (c) the structure, size, and source 
of value-based payment adjustments; 
and (d) public disclosure of hospital 
performance data. 
To develop the plan, CMS created a 
Hospital VBP Workgroup with members 
from various CMS components and the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Planning and Evaluation. The 
Workgroup completed an environmental 
scan of existing hospital VBP programs, 
an issue paper outlining the topics to be 
addressed in the plan, and an options 
paper presenting design alternatives for 
the plan. 
CMS hosted two public Listening 
Sessions in early 2007 to solicit 
comments from interested parties on 
outstanding design questions associated 
with development of the plan. The 
perspectives expressed by stakeholders 
(including hospitals, consumers, and 
purchasers) during these sessions and in 
writing assisted the Workgroup in 
creating the Medicare Hospital VBP 
Plan Report to Congress. The Report was 
submitted to Congress on November 21, 
2007. 
The Medicare Hospital VBP Plan 
builds on the foundation of Medicare’s 
current RHQDAPU program (discussed 
in section IV.B. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule), which, since FY 2005, 
has provided differential payments to 
hospitals that report their performance 
on a defined set of inpatient measures 
for public posting on the Hospital 
Compare Web site. If authorized by 
Congress, the VBP Plan would replace 
the current quality reporting program 
with a new program that would include 
both public reporting and financial 
incentives to drive improvements in 
clinical quality, patient-centeredness, 
and efficiency. 
The proposed plan contains the 
following key components: (a) A 
performance assessment model that 
incorporates measures from different 
quality domains (that is, clinical process 
of care, patient experience of care, 
outcomes, among others) to calculate a 
hospital’s total performance score; (b) 
options for translating this score into an 
incentive payment that would make a 
portion of the hospital’s base DRG 
payment contingent on its total 
performance score; (c) criteria for 
selecting performance measures for the 
financial incentive and candidate 
measures for FY 2009 and beyond; (d) 
a phased approach for transitioning 
from the RHQDAPU program to the VBP 
plan; (e) proposed enhancements to the 
current data transmission and validation 
infrastructure to support VBP program 
requirements; (f) refinements to the 
Hospital Compare Web site to support 
expanded public reporting; and (g) an 
approach to monitoring VBP impacts. 
The Medicare Hospital VBP Plan 
Report to Congress is available on the 
CMS Web site at: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/AcuteInpatientPPS/ 
downloads/HospitalVBPPlanRTCFINAL
SUBMITTED2007.pdf. 
2. Testing and Further Development of 
the Medicare Hospital VBP Plan 
The Hospital VBP Workgroup has 
undertaken testing of the VBP Plan. This 
‘‘dry run’’ or ‘‘simulation’’ of the Plan 
will use the most recent clinical 
process-of-care and HCAHPS 
measurement data available from the 
RHQDAPU program. New information 
generated by the VBP Plan testing will 
include: (a) Performance scores by 
domain; (b) total performance scores; 
and (c) financial impacts. Following a 
process similar to that used in 
developing the Plan, CMS will analyze 
this information by individual IPPS 
hospital, by segment of the hospital 
industry (that is, geographic location, 
size, teaching status, among others), and 
in aggregate for all IPPS hospitals. 
The results of VBP Plan testing will be 
used to further develop the Plan. 
Priorities for Plan completion include 
addressing the small numbers issue 
(described on pages 74 and 75 of the 
Hospital VBP Plan Report to Congress) 
and developing a scoring methodology 
for the outcomes domain (pages 57–58 
of the Hospital VBP Plan Report to 
Congress), which will become an 
additional aspect of the performance 
model. After completion, the Plan will 
be retested. 
We are seeking public comments on 
how to take full advantage of the new 
information generated through this 
testing and further Plan development. 
For example: Should the testing and 
retesting results be publicly posted? If 
the testing results were to be posted, 
would the best location be the Hospital 
Compare Web site or the CMS Web site 
at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov? In what 
format would public posting be most 
useful to potential audiences? At what 
level would the data be posted— 
individual hospital or some higher 
level? Which data elements from the 
testing results would be most useful to 
share? 
D. Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs) 
and Medicare-Dependent, Small Rural 
Hospitals (MDHs): Volume Decrease 
Adjustment (§§ 412.92 and 412.108) 
1. Background 
Under the IPPS, special payment 
protections are provided to a sole 
community hospital (SCH). Section 
1886(d)(5)(D)(iii) of the Act defines an 
SCH as a hospital that, by reason of 
factors such as isolated location, 
weather conditions, travel conditions, 
absence of other like hospitals (as 
determined by the Secretary), or 
historical designation by the Secretary 
as an essential access community 
hospital, is the sole source of inpatient 
hospital services reasonably available to 
Medicare beneficiaries. The regulations 
that set forth the criteria that a hospital 
must meet to be classified as an SCH are 
located in 42 CFR 412.92 of the 
regulations. 
Under the IPPS, separate special 
payment protections also are provided 
to a Medicare-dependent, small rural 
hospital (MDH). Section 
1886(d)(5)(G)(iv) of the Act defines an 
MDH as a hospital that is located in a 
rural area, has not more than 100 beds, 
is not an SCH, and has a high 
percentage of Medicare discharges (not 
less than 60 percent in its 1987 cost 
reporting year or in 2 of its most recent 
3 audited and settled Medicare cost 
reporting years). The regulations that set 
forth the criteria that a hospital must 
meet to be classified as an MDH are 
located in 42 CFR 412.108. 
Although SCHs and MDHs are paid 
under special payment methodologies, 
they are hospitals that are paid under 
section 1886(d) of the Act. Like all IPPS 
hospitals paid under section 1886(d) of 
the Act, SCHs and MDHs are paid for 
their discharges based on the DRG 
weights calculated under section 
1886(d)(4) of the Act. 
Effective with hospital cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2000, section 1886(d)(5)(D)(i) of the Act 
(as amended by section 6003(e) of Pub. 
L. 101–239) and section 1886(b)(3)(I) of 
the Act (as added by section 405 of Pub. 
L. 106–113 and further amended by 
section 213 of Pub. L. 106–554), provide 
that SCHs are paid based on whichever 
of the following rates yields the greatest 
aggregate payment to the hospital for the 
cost reporting period: 
• The Federal rate applicable to the 
hospital; 
• The updated hospital-specific rate 
based on FY 1982 costs per discharge; 
• The updated hospital-specific rate 
based on FY 1987 costs per discharge; 
or 
• The updated hospital-specific rate 
based on FY 1996 costs per discharge. 
For purposes of payment to SCHs for 
which the FY 1996 hospital-specific rate 
yields the greatest aggregate payment, 
payments for discharges during FYs 
2001, 2002, and 2003 were based on a 
blend of the FY 1996 hospital-specific 
rate and the greater of the Federal rate 
or the updated FY 1982 or FY 1987

hospital-specific rate. For discharges 
during FY 2004 and subsequent fiscal 
years, payments based on the FY 1996 
hospital-specific rate are 100 percent of 
the updated FY 1996 hospital-specific 
rate. 
Through and including FY 2006, 
under section 1886(d)(5)(G) of the Act, 
MDHs are paid based on the Federal rate 
or, if higher, the Federal rate plus 50 
percent of the difference between the 
Federal rate and the updated hospital- 
specific rate based on FY 1982 or FY 
1987 costs per discharge, whichever is 
higher. However, section 5003 of Pub. L. 
109–171 (DRA) modified these rules for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2006. Section 5003(c) changed the 50 
percent adjustment to 75 percent. 
Section 5003(b) requires that an MDH 
use the 2002 cost reporting year as its 
base year (that is, the FY 2002 updated 
hospital-specific rate), if that use results 
in a higher payment. MDHs do not have 
the option to use their FY 1996 hospital- 
specific rate. 
For each cost reporting period, the 
fiscal intermediary/MAC determines 
which of the payment options will yield 
the highest aggregate payment. Interim 
payments are automatically made at the 
highest rate using the best data available 
at the time the fiscal intermediary/MAC 
makes the determination. However, it 
may not be possible for the fiscal 
intermediary/MAC to determine in 
advance precisely which of the rates 
will yield the highest aggregate payment 
by year’s end. In many instances, it is 
not possible to forecast the outlier 
payments, the amount of the DSH 
adjustment, or the IME adjustment, all 
of which are applicable only to 
payments based on the Federal rate and 
not to payments based on the hospital- 
specific rate. The fiscal intermediary/ 
MAC makes a final adjustment at the 
close of the cost reporting period after 
it determines precisely which of the 
payment rates would yield the highest 
aggregate payment to the hospital. 
If a hospital disagrees with the fiscal 
intermediary’s or MAC’s determination 
regarding the final amount of program 
payment to which it is entitled, it has 
the right to appeal the fiscal 
intermediary’s or MAC’s decision in 
accordance with the procedures set 
forth in 42 CFR Part 405, Subpart R, 
which concern provider payment 
determinations and appeals. 
2. Volume Decrease Adjustment for 
SCHs and MDHs: Data Sources for 
Determining Core Staff Values 
Section 1886(d)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act 
requires that the Secretary make a 
payment adjustment to an SCH that 
experiences a decrease of more than 5 
percent in its total number of inpatient 
discharges from one cost reporting 
period to the next, if the circumstances 
leading to the decline in discharges 
were beyond the SCH’s control. Section 
1886(d)(5)(G)(iii) of the Act requires that 
the Secretary make a payment 
adjustment to an MDH that experiences 
a decrease of more than 5 percent in its 
total number of inpatient discharges 
from one cost reporting period to the 
next, if the circumstances leading to the 
decline in discharges were beyond the 
MDH’s control. These adjustments were 
designed to compensate an SCH or MDH 
for the fixed costs it incurs in the year 
in which the reduction in discharges 
occurred, which it may be unable to 
reduce. Such costs include the 
maintenance of necessary core staff and 
services. Our records indicate that less 
than 10 SCHs/MDHs request and receive 
this payment adjustment each year. 
We believe that not all staff costs can 
be considered fixed costs. Using a 
standardized formula specified by us, 
the SCH or MDH must demonstrate that 
it appropriately adjusted the number of 
staff in inpatient areas of the hospital 
based on the decrease in the number of 
inpatient days. This formula examines 
nursing staff in particular. If an SCH or 
MDH has an excess number of nursing 
staff, the cost of maintaining those staff 
members is deducted from the total 
adjustment. One exception to this policy 
is that no SCH or MDH may reduce its 
number of staff to a level below what is 
required by State or local law. In other 
words, an SCH or MDH will not be 
penalized for maintaining a level of staff 
that is consistent with State or local 
requirements. 
The process for determining the 
amount of the volume decrease 
adjustment can be found in Section 
2810.1 of the Provider Reimbursement 
Manual, Part 1 (PRM–1). Fiscal 
intermediaries/MACs are responsible for 
establishing whether an SCH or MDH is 
eligible for a volume decrease 
adjustment and, if so, the amount of the 
adjustment. To qualify for this 
adjustment, the SCH or MDH must 
demonstrate that: (a) a decrease of more 
than 5 percent in total number of 
inpatient discharges has occurred; and 
(b) the circumstance that caused the 
decrease in discharges was beyond the 
control of the hospital. Once the fiscal 
intermediary/MAC has established that 
the SCH or MDH satisfies these two 
requirements, it will calculate the 
adjustment. The adjustment amount is 
determined by subtracting the second 
year’s DRG payment from the lesser of: 
(a) the second year’s costs minus any 
adjustment for excess staff; or (b) the 
previous year’s costs multiplied by the 
appropriate IPPS update factor minus 
any adjustment for excess staff. The 
SCH or MDH receives the difference in 
a lump-sum payment. 
In order to determine whether or not 
the hospital’s nurse staffing level is 
appropriate, the fiscal intermediary/ 
MAC compares the hospital’s actual 
number of nursing staff in each area 
with the staffing of like-size hospitals in 
the same census region. If a hospital 
employs more than the reported average 
number of nurses for hospitals of its size 
and census region, the fiscal 
intermediary/MAC reduces the amount 
of the adjustment by the cost of 
maintaining the additional staff. The 
amount of the reduction is calculated by 
multiplying the actual number of 
nursing staff above the reported average 
by the average nurse salary for that 
hospital as reported on the Medicare 
cost report. The complete process for 
determining the amount of the 
adjustment can be found at Section 
2810.1 of the PRM–1. 
Prior to FY 2007, our policy was for 
fiscal intermediaries/MACs to obtain 
average nurse staffing data from the 
AHA HAS/Monitrend Data Book. 
However, in light of concerns that the 
Data Book had been published in 1989 
and is no longer updated, in the FY 
2007 IPPS rule, we proposed and 
finalized our policy to update the data 
sources and methodology used to 
determine the core staffing factors (that 
is, the average nursing staff for similar 
bed size and census region) for purposes 
of calculating the volume decrease 
adjustment (71 FR 48056 through 
48060). We specified that for adjustment 
requests for decreases in discharges 
beginning with FY 2007 (that is, a 
decrease in discharges in 2007 as 
compared to 2006), an SCH or MDH 
could opt to use one of two data 
sources: the AHA Annual Survey or the 
Occupational Mix Survey, but could not 
use the HAS/Monitrend Data Book. (For 
any open adjustment requests prior to 
FY 2007, we allowed SCHs and MDHs 
the option of using the results of any of 
three sources: (1) The 2006 
Occupational Mix Survey for cost 
reporting periods beginning in FY 2006; 
(2) the AHA Annual Survey (where 
available); or (3) the AHA HAS/ 
Monitrend Data Book. We also specified 
a methodology for calculating those core 
staffing factors. For purposes of 
explaining the methodology, we applied 
it to the 2003 Occupational Mix Survey 
data. In our explanation, we recognized 
that some of the 2003 data seemed 
anomalous, and we solicited comments 
on a possible alternative methodology. 
However, there were no suggested 
alternative methodologies from the

commenters. We also explained that, 
while we used the 2003 Occupational 
Mix Survey data ‘‘for purposes of 
describing how we would implement 
this methodology,’’ the final policy was 
to use FY 2006 Occupational Mix 
Survey data going forward. At the time 
we published the proposed and final 
rules, however, we had not yet 
processed the FY 2006 data, and could 
not present the core staffing figures that 
resulted from such data. 
We have now processed the 2006 
Occupational Mix Survey data using the 
methodology specified in the FY 2007 
IPPS final rule and continue to see some 
results that cause us to believe that the 
methodology for calculating the core 
staffing factors should be slightly 
revised from the methodology discussed 
in the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 
48056 through 48060). The new 
methodology uses a revised formula to 
remove outliers from the core staffing 
values. 
a. Occupational Mix Survey 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 
48055), we explained the methodology 
we would use for calculating core 
staffing values from the Occupational 
Mix Survey. We stated that we would 
calculate the nursing hours per patient 
day for each SCH or MDH by dividing 
the number of paid nursing hours (for 
registered nurses, licensed practical 
nurses and nursing aides) reported on 
the Occupational Mix Survey by the 
number of patients days reported on the 
Medicare cost report. The results would 
be grouped in the same bed-size groups 
and census regions as were used in the 
HAS/Monitrend Data Book. 
We indicated that we would publish 
the mean number of nursing hours per 
patient day, for each census region and 
bed-size group, in the Federal Register 
and on the CMS Web site. For purposes 
of the volume decrease adjustment, the 
published data would be utilized in the 
same way as the HAS/Monitrend data: 
The fiscal intermediary/MAC would 
multiply the SCH’s and MDH’s number 
of patient days by the applicable 
published hours per patient day. This 
figure would be divided by the average 
number of worked hours per year per 
nurse (for example, 2,080 for a standard 
40-hour week). The result would be the 
target number of core nursing staff for 
the particular SCH or MDH. If 
necessary, the cost of any excess staff 
(number of FTEs that exceed the 
published number) would be removed 
from the second year’s costs or, if 
applicable, the previous year’s costs 
multiplied by the IPPS update factor 
when determining the volume decrease 
adjustment. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FY 
48057), we stated that we would use the 
results of the FY 2006 Occupational Mix 
Survey and begin applying the 
methodology for adjustments resulting 
from a decrease in discharges in FY 
2007. Because the occupational mix 
survey is conducted once every 3 years, 
we would update the data set every 3 
years. However, at the time of the FY 
2007 IPPS final rule, the FY 2006 
Occupational Mix Survey data were not 
available. In that final rule, we 
described our methodology using the FY 
2003 occupational mix data and the FY 
2003 Medicare cost report file. However, 
these data were used only in order to 
present an example of how our 
methodology would work. Our final 
policy was to use FY 2006 occupational 
mix and cost report data when actually 
processing adjustment requests. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule, to 
illustrate how we would calculate the 
average number of nursing hours per 
patient day by bed size and region, we 
first merged the FY 2003 Occupational 
Mix Survey data with the FY 2003 
Medicare cost report file. We eliminated 
all observations for non-IPPS providers, 
providers who failed to complete the 
occupational mix survey and the 
providers for which provider numbers, 
bed counts, and/or days counts were 
missing. 
For each provider in the pool, we 
calculated the number of nursing hours 
by adding the number of registered 
nurses, licensed practical nurses, and 
nursing aide hours reported on the 
Occupational Mix Survey. We divided 
the result of this calculation by the total 
number of inpatient days reported on 
the cost report to determine the number 
of nursing hours per patient day. For 
purposes of calculating the census 
regional averages for the various bed- 
size groups, we finalized our rule to 
only include observations that fell 
within three standard deviations of the 
mean of all observations, thus removing 
potential outliers in the data. 
When the FY 2006 Occupational Mix 
Survey data became available, our 
analysis of the results indicated that the 
methodology for computing core staffing 
factors should be further revised in 
order to further eliminate outlier data. 
After consulting with the Office of the 
Actuary on appropriate statistical 
methods to remove outlier data, we are 
proposing to modify our methodology 
for calculating the average nursing 
hours per patient day using the FY 2006 
Occupational Mix Survey data and FY 
2006 Medicare cost report data. Similar 
to what was finalized in the FY 2007 
IPPS rule, we are proposing to merge the 
FY 2006 Occupational Mix Survey data 
with the FY 2006 Medicare cost report 
file. We would then eliminate all 
observations for non-IPPS providers, 
providers who failed to complete the 
occupational mix survey and the 
providers for which provider numbers, 
bed counts and/or days counts were 
missing. We would annualize the results 
so that the nursing hours from the 
Occupational Mix Survey and the 
patient days reported on the Medicare 
cost report is representative of one year. 
For each provider in the pool, we 
would calculate the number of nursing 
hours by adding the number of 
registered nurses, licensed practical 
nurses, and nursing aide hours reported 
on the Occupational Mix Survey. We 
would divide the result of this 
calculation by the total number of 
patient days reported on line 12 on 
Worksheet S–3, Part I, Column 6 of the 
Medicare cost report. This includes 
patient days in the general acute care 
area and the intensive care unit area. 
The result is the number of nursing 
hours per patient day. 
For purposes of calculating the census 
regional averages for the various bed- 
size groups, we are proposing a different 
method to remove outliers in the data. 
First, we would calculate the difference 
between the observations in the 75th 
percentile and the 25th percentile, 
which is the inter-quartile range. We 
would remove observations that are 
greater than the 75th percentile plus 1.5 
times the inter-quartile range and less 
than the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times 
the inter-quartile range. This 
methodology, known as the Tukey 
method, is a common statistical method 
used by the Office of the Actuary. Under 
the standard deviation method 
described in the FY 2007 IPPS final 
rule, the mean and standard deviation 
can be influenced by extreme values 
(because the standard deviation is 
increased by the very observations that 
would otherwise be discarded from the 
analysis). Our proposed methodology is 
a more robust technique because it uses 
the quartile values instead of variance to 
describe the spread of the data, and 
quartiles are less influenced by extreme 
outlier values that may be present in the 
data. 
Our proposed method would prevent 
the mean from being influenced by 
extreme observations and assumes that 
the middle 50 percent of the data has no 
outlier observations. The application of 
this methodology would result in a pool 
of approximately 2,578 providers. Each 
census region and bed group category 
required at least three providers in order 
for their average to be published. The 
results of the average nursing hours per 
patient day by bed size and region using

discharges beginning with cost reporting

and 2008.

b. AHA Annual Survey 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 
48058), we also allowed SCHs or MDHs 
that experienced a greater than 5 
percent reduction in the number of 
discharges in a cost reporting period the 
option of using the AHA Annual Survey 
results, where available, to compare the 
number of hospital’s core staff with 
other like-sized hospitals in its 
geographic area. Our methodology for 
calculating the nursing hours per 
patient day using the AHA Annual 
Survey data and the Medicare hospital 
cost report was similar to the 
methodology using the Occupational 
Mix Survey data (eliminating outliers 
outside of three standard deviations 
from the mean). For this reason, as with 
the occupational mix data, both 
standard deviations and the mean could 
be influenced by extreme values. 
Therefore, we are proposing to refine 
our methodology to calculate the core 
staffing factors using the AHA Annual 
Survey data as well. The AHA Annual 
Survey contains FTE counts for 
registered nurses, practical and 
vocational nurses, nursing assistive 
personnel, and other personnel in both 
inpatient and outpatient areas of the 
hospital. This is consistent with the 
Occupational Mix Survey which 
collects data on both the inpatient and 
outpatient areas of the hospital. 
In the FY 2007 IPPS final rule, we 
stated we would calculate the nursing 
hours per patient day using the AHA 
Annual Survey data in a similar method 
to the Occupational Mix Survey. 
Consistent with the HAS/Monitrend 
Data book, we would only calculate the 
average number of nursing staff for a 
bed-size/census group if there are data 
available for three or more hospitals. 
First, we would merge the AHA Annual 
Survey Data with the corresponding 
Medicare cost report. We would 
eliminate all observations for non-IPPS 
providers, providers with hospital-based 
SNFs, and the providers for which 
provider numbers, bed counts, and/or 
days counts were missing. We would 
multiply the number of nurse, licensed 
practical nurse, and nursing aide FTEs 
reported on the AHA Annual Survey by 
2,080 hours to derive the number of 
nursing hours per year (based on a 40- 
hour work week). We would then divide 
this number by the total number of 
patient days reported on line 12 on 
Worksheet S–3, Part I, Column 6 of the 
Medicare cost report. In the FY 2007 
IPPS final rule (71 FR 48060), we had 
stated that we would eliminate all 
providers with results beyond three 
standard deviations from the mean. 
However, to be consistent with our 
methodology with the Occupational Mix 
Survey data, we are also proposing that 
we would remove outliers from the 
AHA Annual Survey data by calculating 
the difference between the observations 
in the 75th percentile and the 25th 
percentile, which is the inter-quartile 
range. Then, we are proposing to 
remove observations that are greater 
than the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times 
the inter-quartile range and less than the 
25th percentile minus 1.5 times the 
inter-quartile range. After removing the 
outliers, we would group the hospitals 
by bed size and census area to calculate 
the average number of nursing hours per 
patient day for each category. Using the 
2006 AHA Annual Survey data as an 
example, this would result in a pool of 
approximately 1,205 providers. The 
results of the nursing hours per patient 
day using the 2006 AHA Annual Survey 
data and the Medicare cost report data 
are shown below. The 2006 Survey 
would be used for the volume decrease 
adjustment calculations for decreases in 
discharges occurring during cost 
reporting periods beginning in FY 2006. 
As we stated in the FY 2007 IPPS final 
rule, for other years, the corresponding 
AHA Annual Survey would be used for 
the year in which the decreased 
occurred. For example, if a hospital 
experienced a decrease between its 2004 
and 2005 cost reporting periods, the 
fiscal intermediary/MAC would 
compare the hospital’s 2005 staffing 
with the results of the 2005 AHA 
Annual Survey, using the methodology 
discussed above.

E. Rural Referral Centers (RRCs) 
(§ 412.96) 
Under the authority of section 
1886(d)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, the 
regulations at § 412.96 set forth the 
criteria that a hospital must meet in 
order to qualify under the IPPS as an 
RRC. For discharges occurring before 
October 1, 1994, RRCs received the 
benefit of payment based on the other 
urban standardized amount rather than 
the rural standardized amount. 
Although the other urban and rural 
standardized amounts are the same for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 1994, RRCs continue to receive 
special treatment under both the DSH 
payment adjustment and the criteria for 
geographic reclassification. 
Section 402 of Pub. L. 108–173 raised 
the DSH adjustment for other rural 
hospitals with less than 500 beds and 
RRCs. Other rural hospitals with less 
than 500 beds are subject to a 12-percent 
cap on DSH payments. RRCs are not 
subject to the 12-percent cap on DSH 
payments that is applicable to other 
rural hospitals (with the exception of 
rural hospitals with 500 or more beds). 
RRCs are not subject to the proximity 
criteria when applying for geographic 
reclassification, and they do not have to 
meet the requirement that a hospital’s 
average hourly wage must exceed the 
average hourly wage of the labor market 
area where the hospital is located by a 
certain percentage (106/108 percent in 
FY 2008). 
Section 4202(b) of Pub. L. 105–33 
states, in part, ‘‘[a]ny hospital classified 
as an RRC by the Secretary * * * for 
fiscal year 1991 shall be classified as 
such an RRC for fiscal year 1998 and 
each subsequent year.’’ In the August 
29, 1997 final rule with comment period 
(62 FR 45999), we reinstated RRC status 
for all hospitals that lost the status due 
to triennial review or MGCRB 
reclassification, but did not reinstate the 
status of hospitals that lost RRC status 
because they were now urban for all 
purposes because of the OMB 
designation of their geographic area as 
urban. However, subsequently, in the 
August 1, 2000 final rule (65 FR 47089), 
we indicated that we were revisiting 
that decision. Specifically, we stated 
that we would permit hospitals that 
previously qualified as an RRC and lost 
their status due to OMB redesignation of 
the county in which they are located 
from rural to urban to be reinstated as 
an RRC. Otherwise, a hospital seeking 
RRC status must satisfy the applicable 
criteria. We used the definitions of 
‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘rural’’ specified in 
Subpart D of 42 CFR Part 412. 
One of the criteria under which a 
hospital may qualify as a RRC is to have 
275 or more beds available for use 
(§ 412.96(b)(1)(ii)). A rural hospital that 
does not meet the bed size requirement 
can qualify as an RRC if the hospital 
meets two mandatory prerequisites (a 
minimum CMI and a minimum number 
of discharges), and at least one of three 
optional criteria (relating to specialty 
composition of medical staff, source of 
inpatients, or referral volume) 
(§ 412.96(c)(1) through (c)(5) and the 
September 30, 1988 Federal Register (53 
FR 38513)). With respect to the two 
mandatory prerequisites, a hospital may 
be classified as an RRC if— 
• The hospital’s CMI is at least equal 
to the lower of the median CMI for 
urban hospitals in its census region, 
excluding hospitals with approved 
teaching programs, or the median CMI 
for all urban hospitals nationally; and 
• The hospital’s number of discharges 
is at least 5,000 per year, or, if fewer, the 
median number of discharges for urban 
hospitals in the census region in which 
the hospital is located. (The number of 
discharges criterion for an osteopathic 
hospital is at least 3,000 discharges per 
year, as specified in section 
1886(d)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.) 
1. Case-Mix Index 
Section 412.96(c)(1) provides that 
CMS establish updated national and 
regional CMI values in each year’s 
annual notice of prospective payment 
rates for purposes of determining RRC 
status. The methodology we used to 
determine the national and regional CMI 
values is set forth in the regulations at 
§ 412.96(c)(1)(ii). The proposed national 
median CMI value for FY 2009 includes 
all urban hospitals nationwide, and the 
proposed regional values for FY 2009 
are the median CMI values of urban 
hospitals within each census region, 
excluding those hospitals with 
approved teaching programs (that is, 
those hospitals that train residents in an 
approved GME program as provided in 
§ 413.75). These values are based on 
discharges occurring during FY 2007 
(October 1, 2006 through September 30, 
2007), and include bills posted to CMS’ 
records through December 2007. 
We are proposing that, in addition to 
meeting other criteria, if rural hospitals 
with fewer than 275 beds are to qualify 
for initial RRC status for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2008, they must have a CMI value for 
FY 2007 that is at least— 
• 1.4285; or 
• The median CMI value (not 
transfer-adjusted) for urban hospitals 
(excluding hospitals with approved 
teaching programs as identified in 
§ 413.75) calculated by CMS for the 
census region in which the hospital is 
located. 
The proposed median CMI values by 
region are set forth in the following 
table:

The preceding numbers will be 
revised in the FY 2009 IPPS final rule 
to the extent required to reflect the 
updated FY 2007 MEDPAR file, which 
will contain data from additional bills 
received through March 2008. 
Hospitals seeking to qualify as RRCs 
or those wishing to know how their CMI 
value compares to the criteria should 
obtain hospital-specific CMI values (not 
transfer-adjusted) from their fiscal 
intermediaries. Data are available on the 
Provider Statistical and Reimbursement 
(PS&R) System. In keeping with our 
policy on discharges, these CMI values 
are computed based on all Medicare 
patient discharges subject to the IPPS 
DRG-based payment. 
2. Discharges 
Section 412.96(c)(2)(i) provides that 
CMS set forth the national and regional 
numbers of discharges in each year’s 
annual notice of prospective payment 
rates for purposes of determining RRC 
status. As specified in section 
1886(d)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, the national 
standard is set at 5,000 discharges. We 
are proposing to update the regional 
standards based on discharges for urban 
hospitals’ cost reporting periods that 
began during FY 2006 (that is, October 
1, 2005 through September 30, 2006), 
which is the latest cost report data 
available at the time this proposed rule 
was developed. 
Therefore, we are proposing that, in 
addition to meeting other criteria, a 
hospital, if it is to qualify for initial RRC 
status for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2008, 
must have as the number of discharges 
for its cost reporting period that began 
during FY 2006 a figure that is at least— 
• 5,000 (3,000 for an osteopathic 
hospital); or 
• The median number of discharges 
for urban hospitals in the census region 
in which the hospital is located, as 
indicated in the following table. 
Region Number of discharges 
1. New England (CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) .................................................................................................................................... 8,158 
2. Middle Atlantic (PA, NJ, NY) ....................................................................................................................................................... 10,443 
3. South Atlantic (DE, DC, FL, GA, MD, NC, SC, VA, WV) ........................................................................................................... 10,344 
4. East North Central (IL, IN, MI, OH, WI) ...................................................................................................................................... 8,900 
5. East South Central (AL, KY, MS, TN) ......................................................................................................................................... 7,401 
6. West North Central (IA, KS, MN, MO, NE, ND, SD) .................................................................................................................. 7,988 
7. West South Central (AR, LA, OK, TX) ........................................................................................................................................ 5,816 
8. Mountain (AZ, CO, ID, MT, NV, NM, UT, WY) ........................................................................................................................... 9,919 
9. Pacific (AK, CA, HI, OR, WA) ..................................................................................................................................................... 8,600 
These numbers will be revised in the 
FY 2009 IPPS final rule based on the 
latest available cost reports. 
We note that the median number of 
discharges for hospitals in each census 
region is greater than the national 
standard of 5,000 discharges. Therefore, 
5,000 discharges is the minimum 
criterion for all hospitals. 
We reiterate that, if an osteopathic 
hospital is to qualify for RRC status for 
cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 2008, the hospital 
would be required to have at least 3,000 
discharges for its cost reporting period 
that began during FY 2005. 
F. Indirect Medical Education (IME) 
Adjustment (§ 412.105) 
1. Background 
Section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Act 
provides for an additional payment 
amount under the IPPS for hospitals 
that have residents in an approved 
graduate medical education (GME) 
program in order to reflect the higher 
indirect patient care costs of teaching 
hospitals relative to nonteaching 
hospitals. The regulations regarding the 
calculation of this additional payment, 
known as the indirect medical 
education (IME) adjustment, are located 
at § 412.105. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 
(Pub. L. 105–33) established a limit on 
the number of allopathic and 
osteopathic residents that a hospital 
may include in its full-time equivalent 
(FTE) resident count for direct GME and 
IME payment purposes. Under section 
1886(h)(4)(F) of the Act, for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1997, a hospital’s 
unweighted FTE count of residents for 
purposes of direct GME may not exceed 
the hospital’s unweighted FTE count for 
its most recent cost reporting period 
ending on or before December 31, 1996. 
Under section 1886(d)(5)(B)(v) of the 
Act, a similar limit on the FTE resident 
count for IME purposes is effective for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 1997. 
2. IME Adjustment Factor for FY 2009 
The IME adjustment to the MS–DRG 
payment is based in part on the 
applicable IME adjustment factor. The 
IME adjustment factor is calculated by 
using a hospital’s ratio of residents to 
beds, which is represented as r, and a 
formula multiplier, which is 
represented as c, in the following 
equation: c x [{1 + r} .405 ¥ 1]. The 
formula is traditionally described in 
terms of a certain percentage increase in 
payment for every 10-percent increase 
in the resident-to-bed ratio. 
Section 502(a) of Pub. L. 108–173 
modified the formula multiplier (c) to be 
used in the calculation of the IME 
adjustment. Prior to the enactment of 
Pub. L. 108–173, the formula multiplier 
was fixed at 1.35 for discharges 
occurring during FY 2003 and 
thereafter. In the FY 2005 IPPS final 
rule, we announced the schedule of 
formula multipliers to be used in the 
calculation of the IME adjustment and 
incorporated the schedule in our

regulations at § 412.105(d)(3)(viii) 
through (d)(3)(xii). Section 502(a) 
modifies the formula multiplier 
beginning midway through FY 2004 and 
provides for a new schedule of formula 
multipliers for FYs 2005 and thereafter 
as follows: 
• For discharges occurring on or after 
April 1, 2004, and before October 1, 
2004, the formula multiplier is 1.47. 
• For discharges occurring during FY 
2005, the formula multiplier is 1.42. 
• For discharges occurring during FY 
2006, the formula multiplier is 1.37. 
• For discharges occurring during FY 
2007, the formula multiplier is 1.32. 
• For discharges occurring during FY 
2008 and fiscal years thereafter, the 
formula multiplier is 1.35. 
Accordingly, for discharges occurring 
during FY 2009, the formula multiplier 
would be 1.35. We estimate that 
application of this formula multiplier 
for FY 2009 IME adjustment will result 
in an increase in IME payment of 5.5 
percent for every approximately 10- 
percent increase in the hospital’s 
resident-to-bed ratio.

Emergency Situations; Technical 
Correction (§ 413.79(f)(6)(iv)) 
1. Background 
Under section 1886(h) of the Act, as 
amended by section 9202 of the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 
(Pub. L. 99–272), the Secretary is 
authorized to make payments to 
hospitals for the direct costs of 
approved GME programs. Section 
1886(d)(5)(B) of the Act provides that 
prospective payment acute care 
hospitals that have residents in an 
approved GME program receive an 
additional payment for a Medicare 
discharge to reflect the higher patient 
care costs of teaching hospitals, that is, 
IME costs. Sections 1886(h)(4)(F) and 
1886(d)(5)(B)(v) of the Act establish 
limits on the number of allopathic and 
osteopathic residents that hospitals may 
count for purposes of calculating direct 
GME payments and the IME adjustment, 
respectively, establishing hospital- 
specific direct GME and IME FTE 
resident caps. Under the authority 
granted by section 1886(h)(4)(H)(ii) of 
the Act, the Secretary issued rules to 
allow institutions that are members of 
the same affiliated group to apply their 
direct GME and IME FTE resident caps 
on an aggregate basis through a 
Medicare GME affiliation agreement. 
The Medicare regulations at §§ 413.75 
and 413.76 permit hospitals, through a 
Medicare GME affiliation agreement, to 
adjust IME and direct GME FTE resident 
caps to reflect the rotation of residents 
among affiliated hospitals. 
In response to circumstances in the 
aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and 
Rita, we supplemented regulations in 
the April 12, 2006 interim final rule 
with comment period published in the 
Federal Register (71 FR 18654). The 
regulatory changes allowed certain 
hospitals to engage in emergency 
Medicare GME affiliations so that 
Medicare funding for GME is 
maintained while there are displaced 
residents training at various host 
hospitals even as the hurricane-affected 
hospitals are rebuilding their training 
programs. The modifications to the 
regulations at § 413.75(b) and § 413.76(f) 
provided flexibility for home hospitals 
whose residency programs have been 
disrupted due to an emergency to enter 
into emergency Medicare GME 
affiliation agreements with host 
hospitals where the hospitals may not 
otherwise meet the regulatory 
requirements to form Medicare GME 
affiliations. (We note that on November 
27, 2007, we issued a second interim 
final rule with comment period 
providing further flexibility relating to 
emergency Medicare GME affiliation 
agreements (72 FR 66893 through 
66898). We expect to address the public 
comments received on both interim 
final rules with comment period and 
finalize our policies in the FY 2009 IPPS 
final rule scheduled to be published in 
August 2008.) 
2. Technical Correction 
In the April 12, 2006 interim final 
rule, we revised § 413.79(f) by adding a 
new paragraph (6) to provide for more 
flexibility in Medicare GME affiliations 
for home hospitals located in section 
1135 emergency areas to allow the home 
hospitals to efficiently find training sites 
for displaced residents. We have 
discovered that, under § 413.79(f)(6)(iv), 
in our provisions on the host hospital 
exception from the rolling average for 
the period from August 29, 2005 to June 
30, 2006, we included an incorrect 
cross-reference to the rolling average 
requirements for direct GME as 
‘‘§ 413.75(d).’’ The correct citation to the 
rolling average requirements for direct 
GME is § 413.79(d). We are proposing to 
correct the cross-reference under 
§ 413.79(f)(6)(iv) to read ‘‘paragraph (d) 
of this section’’. 
H. Payments to Medicare Advantage 
Organizations: Collection of Risk 
Adjustment Data (§ 422.310) 
Section 1853 of the Act requires CMS 
to make advance monthly payments to 
a Medicare Advantage (MA) 
organization for each beneficiary 
enrolled in an MA plan offered by the 
organization for coverage of Medicare 
Part A and Part B benefits. Section 
1853(a)(1)(C) of the Act requires CMS to 
adjust the monthly payment amount for 
each enrollee to take into account the 
health status of the MA plan’s enrollees. 
Under the CMS-Hierarchical Condition 
Category (HCC) risk adjustment 
payment methodology, CMS determines 
risk scores for MA enrollees for a year 
and adjusts the monthly payment 
amount using the appropriate enrollee 
risk score. 
Under section 1853(a)(3)(B) of the 
Act, MA organizations are required to 
‘‘submit data regarding inpatient 
hospital services . . . and data 
regarding other services and other 
information as the Secretary deems 
necessary’’ in order to implement a 
methodology for ‘‘risk adjusting’’ 
payments made to MA organizations. 
Risk adjustments to payments are made 
in order to take into account ‘‘variations 
in per capita costs based on [the] health 
status’’ of the Medicare beneficiaries 
enrolled in an MA plan offered by the 
organization. Submission of data on 
inpatient hospital services has been 
required with respect to services 
beginning on or after July 1, 1997. 
Submission of data on other services has 
been required since July 1, 1998. 
While we initially required the 
submission of comprehensive data 
regarding services provided by MA 
organizations, including comprehensive 
inpatient hospital encounter data, we 
subsequently permitted MA 
organizations to submit an 
‘‘abbreviated’’ set of data. Our 
regulations at 42 CFR 422.310(d)(1) 
currently explicitly provide MA 
organizations with the option of 
submitting an abbreviated data set. 
Under this provision, we currently 
collect limited risk adjustment data 
from MA organizations, primarily 
diagnosis data. 
From calendar years 2000 through 
2006, application of risk adjustment to 
MA payments was ‘‘phased in’’ with an 
increasing percentage of the monthly 
capitation payment subjected to risk 
adjustment. Beginning with calendar 
year 2007, 100 percent of payments to 
MA organizations are risk-adjusted. 
Given the increased importance of the 
accuracy of our risk adjustment 
methodology, we are proposing to 
amend § 422.310 to provide that CMS 
will collect data from MA organizations 
regarding each item and service 
provided to an MA plan enrollee. This 
will allow us to include utilization data 
and other factors that CMS can use in 
developing the CMS–HCC risk

adjustment models in order to reflect 
patterns of diagnoses and expenditures 
in the MA program. 
Specifically, we are proposing to 
revise § 422.310(a) to clarify that risk 
adjustment data are data used not only 
in the application of risk adjustment to 
MA payments, but also in the 
development of risk adjustment models. 
For example, once encounter data for 
MA enrollees are available, CMS would 
have beneficiary-specific information on 
the utilization of services by MA plan 
enrollees. These data could be used to 
calibrate the CMS–HCC risk adjustment 
models using MA patterns of diagnoses 
and expenditures. 
We are proposing to revise 
§§ 422.310(b), (c), (d)(3), and (g) to 
clarify that the term ‘‘services’’ includes 
items and services. 
We are proposing to revise 
§ 422.310(d) to clarify that CMS has the 
authority to require MA organizations to 
submit encounter data for each item and 
service provided to an MA plan 
enrollee. The proposed revision also 
would clarify that CMS will determine 
the formats for submitting encounter 
data, which may be more abbreviated 
than those used for the fee-for-service 
claims data submission process. 
We are proposing to revise 
§ 422.310(f) to clarify that one of the 
‘‘other’’ purposes for which CMS may 
use risk adjustment data collected under 
this section would be to update risk 
adjustment models with data from MA 
enrollees. In addition, when providing 
that CMS may use risk adjustment data 
for purposes other than adjusting 
payments as described at §§ 422.304(a) 
and (c), we are proposing to delete the 
phrase ‘‘except for medical records 
data’’ from paragraph (f). Any use of 
medical records data collected under 
paragraph (e) of § 422.310 is governed 
by the Privacy Act and the privacy 
provisions in the HIPAA. Furthermore, 
there may be occasions when we learn 
from analysis of medical record review 
data that some organizations have 
misunderstood our guidance on how to 
implement an operational instruction. 
We want to be able to provide improved 
guidance to MA organizations based on 
any insights that may emerge during 
analysis of the medical record review 
data. 
In addition, we are proposing a 
technical correction to § 422.310(f) to 
clarify that risk adjustment data are 
used not only to adjust payments to 
plans described at §§ 422.301(a)(1), 
(a)(2), and (a)(3) (which refer to 
coordinated care plans and private fee- 
for-service plans), but also to adjust 
payments for ESRD enrollees and 
payments to MSA plans and Religious 
Fraternal Benefit society plans, as 
described at § 422.301(c). 
Under § 422.310(g), we would 
continue to provide that data that CMS 
receives after the final deadline for a 
payment year will not be accepted for 
purposes of the reconciliation. However, 
we are proposing to revise paragraph 
(g)(2) of § 422.310 to change the 
deadline from ‘‘December 31’’ of the 
payment year to ‘‘January 31’’ of the 
year following the payment year. We are 
also proposing to add language to 
provide that CMS may adjust deadlines 
as appropriate. 
I. Hospital Emergency Services under 
EMTALA (§ 489.24) 
1. Background 
Sections 1866(a)(1)(I), 1866(a)(1)(N), 
and 1867 of the Act impose specific 
obligations on certain Medicare- 
participating hospitals and CAHs. 
(Throughout this section of this 
proposed rule, when we reference the 
obligation of a ‘‘hospital’’ under these 
sections of the Act and in our 
regulations, we mean to include CAHs 
as well.) These obligations concern 
individuals who come to a hospital 
emergency department and request 
examination or treatment for a medical 
condition, and apply to all of these 
individuals, regardless of whether they 
are beneficiaries of any program under 
the Act. 
The statutory provisions cited above 
are frequently referred to as the 
Emergency Medical Treatment and 
Labor Act (EMTALA), also known as the 
patient antidumping statute. EMTALA 
was passed in 1986 as part of the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), 
Pub. L. 99–272. Congress incorporated 
these antidumping provisions within 
the Social Security Act to ensure that 
individuals with emergency medical 
conditions are not denied essential 
lifesaving services. Under section 
1866(a)(1)(I)(i) of the Act, a hospital that 
fails to fulfill its EMTALA obligations 
under these provisions may be subject 
to termination of its Medicare provider 
agreement, which would result in loss 
of all Medicare and Medicaid payments. 
Section 1867 of the Act sets forth 
requirements for medical screening 
examinations for individuals who come 
to the hospital and request examination 
or treatment for a medical condition. 
The section further provides that if a 
hospital finds that such an individual 
has an emergency medical condition, it 
is obligated to provide that individual 
with either necessary stabilizing 
treatment or an appropriate transfer to 
another medical facility where 
stabilization can occur. 
The EMTALA statute also outlines the 
obligation of hospitals to receive 
appropriate transfers from other 
hospitals. Section 1867(g) of the Act 
states that a participating hospital that 
has specialized capabilities or facilities 
(such as burn units, shock-trauma units, 
neonatal intensive care units, or, with 
respect to rural areas, regional referral 
centers as identified by the Secretary in 
regulation) shall not refuse to accept an 
appropriate transfer of an individual 
who requires these specialized 
capabilities or facilities if the hospital 
has the capacity to treat the individual. 
The regulations implementing section 
1867 of the Act are found at 42 CFR 
489.24. The regulations at 42 CFR 
489.20(l), (m), (q), and (r) also refer to 
certain EMTALA requirements. The 
Interpretive Guidelines concerning 
EMTALA are found at Appendix V of 
the CMS State Operations Manual. 
2. EMTALA Technical Advisory 
Group (TAG) Recommendations 
Section 945 of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), Pub. 
L. 108–173, required the Secretary to 
establish a Technical Advisory Group 
(TAG) to advise the Secretary on issues 
related to the regulations and 
implementation of EMTALA. The MMA 
specified that the EMTALA TAG be 
composed of 19 members, including the 
Administrator of CMS, the Inspector 
General of HHS, hospital representatives 
and physicians representing specific 
specialties, patient representatives, and 
representatives of organizations 
involved in EMTALA enforcement. 
The EMTALA TAG’s functions, as 
identified in the charter for the 
EMTALA TAG, were as follows: (1) 
Review EMTALA regulations; (2) 
provide advice and recommendations to 
the Secretary concerning these 
regulations and their application to 
hospitals and physicians; (3) solicit 
comments and recommendations from 
hospitals, physicians, and the public 
regarding the implementation of such 
regulations; and (4) disseminate 
information concerning the application 
of these regulations to hospitals, 
physicians, and the public. The TAG 
met 7 times during its 30-month term, 
which ended on September 30, 2007. At 
its meetings, the TAG heard testimony 
from representatives of physician 
groups, hospital associations, and others 
regarding EMTALA issues and 
concerns. During each meeting, the 
three subcommittees established by the 
TAG (the On-Call Subcommittee, the 
Action Subcommittee, and the 
Framework Subcommittee) developed

recommendations, which were then 
discussed and voted on by members of 
the TAG. In total, the TAG submitted 55 
recommendations to the Secretary. If 
implemented, some of the 
recommendations would require 
regulatory changes. Of the 55 
recommendations developed by the 
TAG, 5 have already been implemented 
by CMS. A complete list of TAG 
recommendations will be available 
shortly in the Emergency Medical 
Treatment and Labor Act Technical 
Advisory Group final report available at 
the Web site: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
FACA/07_emtalatag.asp. The following 
recommendations have already been 
implemented by CMS: 
• That CMS revise, in the EMTALA 
regulations [42 CFR 489.24(b)], the 
following sentence contained in the 
definition of ‘‘labor’’: ‘‘A woman 
experiencing contractions is in true 
labor unless a physician certifies that, 
after a reasonable time of observation, 
the woman is in false labor.’’ 
This recommendation was adopted 
with modification in the FY 2007 IPPS 
final rule (71 FR 48143). We revised the 
definition of ‘‘labor’’ in the regulations 
at § 489.24(b) to permit a physician, 
certified nurse-midwife, or other 
qualified medical person, acting within 
his or her scope of practice in 
accordance with State law and hospital 
bylaws, to certify that a woman is 
experiencing false labor. We issued 
Survey and Certification Letter S&C–06– 
32 on September 29, 2006, to clarify the 
regulation change. (The Survey and 
Certification Letter can be found at the 
following Web site: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
SurveyCertificationGenInfo/PMSR/ 
list.asp). 
• That hospitals with specialized 
capabilities (as defined in the EMTALA 
regulations) that do not have a 
dedicated emergency department be 
bound by the same responsibilities 
under EMTALA as hospitals with 
specialized capabilities that do have a 
dedicated emergency department. 
This recommendation was adopted in 
the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 
48143). We added language at 
§ 489.24(f) that makes explicit the 
current policy that all Medicare- 
participating providers with specialized 
capabilities are required to accept an 
appropriate transfer if they have the 
capacity to treat the individual. We 
issued Survey and Certification Letter 
S&C–06–32 on September 29, 2006, to 
clarify the regulation change. (The 
Survey and Certification Letter can be 
found at the following Web site: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
SurveyCertificationGenInfo/PMSR/ 
list.asp). 
• That CMS clarify the intent of 
regulations regarding obligations under 
EMTALA to receive individuals who 
arrive by ambulance. Specifically, the 
TAG recommended that CMS revise a 
letter of guidance that had been issued 
by the agency to clarify its position on 
the practice of delaying the transfer of 
an individual from an emergency 
medical service provider’s stretcher to a 
bed in a hospital’s emergency 
department. 
This recommendation was adopted 
with modification by CMS in Survey 
and Certification Letter S&C–07–20, 
which was released on April 27, 2007. 
(The Survey and Certification Letter can 
be found at the following Web site: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
SurveyCertificationGenInfo/PMSR/ 
list.asp). 
• That CMS clarify that a hospital 
may not refuse to accept an individual 
appropriately transferred under 
EMTALA on the grounds that it (the 
receiving hospital) does not approve the 
method of transfer arranged by the 
attending physician at the sending 
hospital (for example, a receiving 
hospital may not require the sending 
hospital to use an ambulance transport 
designated by the receiving hospital). In 
addition, CMS should improve its 
communication of such clarifications 
with its regional offices. 
This recommendation was adopted 
and implemented by CMS in Survey 
and Certification Letter S&C–07–20, 
which was released on April 27, 2007. 
(The Survey and Certification Letter can 
be found at the following Web site: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
SurveyCertificationGenInfo/PMSR/ 
list.asp). 
• That CMS strike the language in the 
Interpretive Guidelines (CMS State 
Operations Manual, Appendix V) that 
addresses telehealth/telemedicine 
(relating to the regulations at 
§ 489.24(j)(1)) and replace it with 
language that clarifies that the treating 
physician ultimately determines 
whether an on-call physician should 
come to the emergency department and 
that the treating physician may use a 
variety of methods to communicate with 
the on-call physician. A potential 
violation occurs only if the treating 
physician requests that the on-call 
physician come to the emergency 
department and the on-call physician 
refuses. 
This recommendation was adopted 
and implemented by CMS in Survey 
and Certification Letter S&C–07–23, 
which was released on June 22, 2007. 
(The Survey and Certification Letter can 
be found at the following Web site: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
SurveyCertificationGenInfo/PMSR/ 
list.asp). 
We are considering the remaining 
recommendations of the EMTALA TAG 
and may address them through future 
changes to or clarifications of the 
existing regulations or the Interpretive 
Guidelines, or both. 
At the end of its term, the EMTALA 
TAG compiled a final report to the 
Secretary. This report includes, among 
other materials, minutes from each TAG 
meeting as well as a comprehensive list 
of all of the TAG’s recommendations. 
The final report will be available shortly 
at the following Web site: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/FACA/ 
07_emtalatag.asp. 
3. Proposed Changes Relating to 
Applicability of EMTALA Requirements 
to Hospital Inpatients 
While many issues pertaining to 
EMTALA involve individuals 
presenting to a hospital’s dedicated 
emergency department, questions have 
been raised regarding the applicability 
of the EMTALA requirements to 
inpatients. We have previously 
discussed the applicability of the 
EMTALA requirements to hospital 
inpatients in both the May 9, 2002 IPPS 
proposed rule (67 FR 31475) and the 
September 9, 2003 stand alone final rule 
on EMTALA (68 FR 53243). As we 
stated in both of the aforementioned 
rules, in 1999, the United States 
Supreme Court considered a case 
(Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, 525 U.S. 
249 (1999)) that involved, in part, the 
question of whether EMTALA applies to 
inpatients in a hospital. In the context 
of that case, the United States Solicitor 
General advised the Court that HHS 
would develop a regulation clarifying its 
position on that issue. In the 2003 final 
rule, CMS took the position that a 
hospital’s obligation under EMTALA 
ends when that hospital, in good faith, 
admits an individual with an unstable 
emergency medical condition as an 
inpatient to that hospital. In that rule, 
CMS noted that other patient safeguards 
protected inpatients, including the CoPs 
as well as State malpractice law. 
However, in the 2003 final rule, CMS 
did not directly address the question of 
whether EMTALA’s ‘‘specialized care’’ 
requirements (section 1867(g) of the 
Act) applied to inpatients. 
As noted in section IV.I.2. of this 
preamble, the EMTALA TAG has 
developed a set of recommendations to 
the Secretary. One of those 
recommendations calls for CMS to 
revise its regulations to address the 
situation of an individual who: (1) 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 19:42 Apr 29, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00143 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\30APP2.SGM 30APP2jle

23670 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Presents to a hospital that has a 
dedicated emergency department and is 
determined to have an unstabilized 
emergency medical condition; (2) is 
admitted to the hospital as an inpatient; 
and (3) the hospital subsequently 
determines that stabilizing the 
individual’s emergency medical 
condition requires specialized care only 
available at another hospital. 
We believe that the obligation of 
EMTALA does not end for all hospitals 
once an individual has been admitted as 
an inpatient to the hospital where the 
individual first presented with a 
medical condition that was determined 
to be an emergency medical condition. 
Rather, once the individual is admitted, 
admission only impacts on the 
EMTALA obligation of the hospital 
where the individual first presented. 
(Throughout this section of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, we will 
refer to the hospital where the 
individual first presented as the 
‘‘admitting hospital.’’) Section 1867(g) 
of the Act states: ‘‘Nondiscrimination— 
A participating hospital that has 
specialized capabilities or facilities 
(such as burn units, shock-trauma units, 
neonatal intensive care units, or (with 
respect to rural areas) regional referral 
centers as identified by the Secretary in 
regulation) shall not refuse to accept an 
appropriate transfer of an individual 
who requires such specialized 
capabilities or facilities if the hospital 
has the capacity to treat the individual.’’ 
Section 1867(g) of the Act therefore 
requires a receiving hospital with 
specialized capabilities to accept a 
request to transfer an individual with an 
unstable emergency medical condition 
as long as the hospital has the capacity 
to treat that individual, regardless of 
whether the individual had been an 
inpatient at the admitting hospital. 
Furthermore, in the September 9, 2003 
final rule (68 FR 53263), we amended 
the regulations at § 489.24(d)(2)(i) to 
state: ‘‘If a hospital has screened an 
individual under paragraph (a) of this 
section and found the individual to 
have an emergency medical condition, 
and admits that individual in good faith 
in order to stabilize the emergency 
medical condition, the hospital has 
satisfied its special responsibilities 
under this section with respect to that 
individual’’ (emphasis added). We did 
not intend for the regulation to end the 
EMTALA obligation for any other 
hospital to which the individual may 
appropriately be transferred to stabilize 
his or her emergency medical condition. 
Permitting inpatient admission at the 
admitting hospital to end EMTALA 
obligations for another hospital to 
which an unstabilized individual is 
being appropriately transferred to 
receive specialized care would 
seemingly contradict the intent of 
section 1867(g) of the Act to ensure that 
hospitals with specialized capabilities 
provide medical treatment to 
individuals with emergency medical 
conditions to stabilize their conditions. 
We also note that, as we discussed in 
the preamble of the September 9, 2003 
stand alone final rule, once a hospital 
has admitted an individual as an 
inpatient, the individual is protected 
under the Medicare CoPs and may also 
have additional protections under State 
law. Accordingly, we believe it is 
consistent with the intent of EMTALA 
to limit its protections to individuals 
who need them most; for example, 
individuals who present to a hospital 
but may not have been formally 
admitted as patients and thus are not 
covered by other protections applicable 
to inpatients of the hospital. As noted 
above, once the individual is admitted, 
the CoPs apply to the admitting 
hospital’s care of that individual. A 
hospital that fails to provide treatment 
to such individuals could face 
termination of its Medicare provider 
agreement for a violation of the CoPs. 
However, these CoPs do not, of course, 
apply to a hospital with specialized 
capabilities to which the individual 
might be transferred unless and until 
the individual is formally admitted as a 
patient at that hospital. Therefore, in 
order to ensure an individual the 
protections intended by the EMTALA 
statute, especially section 1867(g) of the 
Act (obligating a hospital with 
specialized capabilities to accept an 
appropriately transferred individual if it 
has the capacity to treat that individual), 
we believe it is appropriate to propose 
to clarify that section 1867(g) of the Act 
continues to apply so as to protect even 
an individual who has been admitted as 
an inpatient to the admitting hospital 
who has not been stable since becoming 
an inpatient. We believe that this 
proposed clarification is necessary to 
ensure that EMTALA protections are 
continued for individuals who are not 
otherwise protected by the hospital 
CoPs. (We note that this proposed 
clarification is consistent with the 
EMATLA TAG’s recommendation that 
EMTALA does not apply when an 
individual is admitted to the hospital 
for an elective procedure and 
subsequently develops an emergency 
medical condition.) 
We recognize that this proposed 
clarification that EMTALA applies to a 
hospital with specialized capabilities 
when an inpatient (who presented to the 
admitting hospital under EMTALA) is 
in need of specialized care to stabilize 
his or her emergency medical condition 
may raise concerns among the provider 
community that such a clarification in 
policy could hypothetically result in an 
increase in the number of transfers. 
However, the intention of this proposed 
clarification is not to encourage patient 
dumping to hospitals with specialized 
capabilities. Rather, even if the hospital 
with specialized capabilities has an 
EMTALA obligation to accept an 
individual who was an inpatient at the 
admitting hospital, the admitting 
hospital transferring the individual 
should take all steps necessary to ensure 
that it is providing needed treatment 
within its capabilities prior to 
transferring the individual. This means 
that an individual with an unstabilized 
emergency medical condition should be 
transferred only when the capabilities of 
the admitting hospital have been 
exceeded. 
Accordingly, we are proposing to 
revise § 489.24(f) by adding to the 
existing text a provision that specifies 
that paragraph (f) also applies to an 
individual who has been admitted 
under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the section 
and who has not been stabilized. 
While we are not including the 
following in our proposed clarification, 
we are seeking public comments on 
whether the EMTALA obligation 
imposed on hospitals with specialized 
capabilities to accept appropriate 
transfers should apply to a hospital with 
specialized capabilities in the case of an 
individual who had a period of stability 
during his or her stay at the admitting 
hospital and is in need of specialized 
care available at the hospital with 
specialized capabilities. CMS takes 
seriously its duty to protect patients 
with emergency medical conditions as 
required by EMTALA. Thus, we are 
seeking public comments as to whether, 
with respect to the EMTALA obligation 
on the hospital with specialized 
capabilities, it should or should not 
matter if an individual who currently 
has an unstabilized emergency medical 
condition (which is beyond the 
capability of the admitting hospital) (1) 
remained unstable after coming to the 
hospital emergency department or (2) 
subsequently had a period of stability 
after coming to the hospital emergency 
department. 
In summary, to implement the 
recommendation by the EMTALA TAG 
and clarify our policy regarding the 
applicability of EMTALA to hospital 
inpatients, we are proposing to amend 
§ 489.24(f) to add a provision to state 
that when an individual covered by 
EMTALA was admitted as an inpatient 
and remains unstabilized with an

capabilities has an EMTALA obligation 
to accept that individual, assuming that 
the transfer of the individual is an 
appropriate transfer and the 
participating hospital with specialized 
capabilities has the capacity to treat the 
individual. 
4. Proposed Changes to the EMTALA 
Physician On-Call Requirements 
a. Relocation of Regulatory Provisions 
During its term, the EMTALA TAG 
dedicated a significant portion of its 
discussion to a hospital’s physician on- 
call obligations under EMTALA and 
made several recommendations to the 
Secretary regarding physician on-call 
requirements that are included in its 
final report (will be available shortly at 
the Web site: http://www.cms.hhs/gov/ 
FACA/07_emtalatag.asp). The TAG 
recommended that CMS move the 
regulation discussing the obligation to 
maintain an on-call list from the 
EMTALA regulations at § 489.24(j)(1) to 
the regulations implementing provider 
agreements at § 489.20(r)(2). We agree 
with the TAG’s recommendation. The 
requirement to maintain an on-call list 
is found at section 1866(a)(1)(I)(iii) of 
the Act, the section of the Act that refers 
to provider agreements. Section 1867 of 
the Act, which outlines the EMTALA 
requirements, makes no mention of the 
requirement to maintain an on-call list. 
To implement the EMTALA TAG’s 
recommendation, we are proposing to 
delete the provision relating to 
maintaining a list of on-call physicians 
from § 489.24(j)(1). We note that a 
provision for an on-call physician list is 
already included in the regulations as a 
hospital provider agreement 
requirement at § 489.20(r)(2). We are 
proposing to incorporate the language of 
§ 489.24(j)(1) as replacement language 
for the existing § 489.20(r)(2) and amend 
the regulatory language to make it more 
consistent with the statutory language 
found at section 1866(a)(1)(I)(iii) of the 
Act. Proposed revised § 489.20(r)(2) 
would read: ‘‘An on-call list of 
physicians on its medical staff available 
to provide treatment necessary after the 
initial examination to stabilize 
individuals with emergency medical 
conditions who are receiving services 
required under § 489.24 in accordance 
with the resources available to the 
hospital; and’’. These proposed changes 
would make the regulations consistent 
with the statutory basis for maintaining 
an on-call list. 
The EMTALA TAG made additional 
recommendations regarding how a 
hospital would satisfy its on-call list 
obligations, including calling for an 
annual plan by the hospital and medical 
staff for on-call coverage that would 
include an assessment of factors such as 
the hospital’s capabilities and services, 
community need for emergency 
department services as indicated by 
emergency department visits, emergent 
transfers, physician resources, and past 
performance of previous on-call plans. 
The TAG also recommended that a 
hospital have a backup plan for viable 
patient care options when an on-call 
physician is not available, including 
such factors as telemedicine, other staff 
physicians, transfer agreements, and 
regional or community call 
arrangements. While community call 
arrangements are discussed below, we 
intend to address the remainder of the 
TAG recommendations at a later date. 
b. Shared/Community Call 
As noted in the previous section, 
section 1866(a)(1)(I)(iii) of the Act 
states, as a requirement for participation 
in the Medicare program, that a hospital 
must keep a list of physicians who are 
on call for duty after the initial 
examination to provide treatment 
necessary to stabilize an individual with 
an emergency medical condition. If a 
physician on the list is called by a 
hospital to provide stabilizing treatment 
and either fails or refuses to appear 
within a reasonable period of time, the 
hospital and that physician may be in 
violation of EMTALA as provided for 
under section 1867(d)(1)(C) of the Act. 
Thus, hospitals are required to maintain 
a list of on-call physicians, and 
physicians or hospitals, or both, may be 
held responsible under the EMTALA 
statute if a physician who is on call fails 
or refuses to appear within a reasonable 
period of time. 
In the May 9, 2002 proposed rule (67 
FR 31471), we stated that we were 
aware of hospitals’ increasing concerns 
regarding their physician on-call 
requirements. Specifically, we noted 
that we were aware of reports of 
physicians, particularly specialty 
physicians, severing their relationships 
with hospitals because of on-call 
obligations, especially when those 
physicians belong to more than one 
hospital medical staff. We further noted 
that physician attrition from these 
medical staffs could result in hospitals 
having no specialty physician service 
coverage for their patients. In the 
September 9, 2003 final rule (68 FR 
53264), we clarified the regulations at 
§ 489.24(j) to permit on-call physicians 
to schedule elective surgery during the 
time that they are on call and to permit 
on-call physicians to have simultaneous 
on-call duties. We also specified that 
physicians, including specialists and 
subspecialists, are not required to be on 
call at all times, and that the hospital 
must have policies and procedures to be 
followed when a particular specialty is 
not available or the on-call physician 
cannot respond because of situations 
beyond his or her control. We expected 
these clarifications would help to 
improve access to physician services for 
all hospital patients by permitting 
hospitals flexibility to determine how 
best to maximize their available 
physician resources. Furthermore, we 
expected that these clarifications would 
permit hospitals to continue to attract 
physicians to serve on their medical 
staffs, thereby continuing to provide 
services to all patients, including those 
individuals who are covered by 
EMTALA. 
As part of its recommendations 
concerning physician on-call 
requirements, the EMTALA TAG 
recommended that hospitals be 
permitted to participate in ‘‘community 
call.’’ Specifically, the language of the 
recommendation states: ‘‘The TAG 
recommends that CMS clarify its 
position regarding shared or community 
call: that such community call 
arrangements are acceptable if the 
hospitals involved have formal 
agreements recognized in their policies 
and procedures, as well as backup 
plans. It should also be clarified that a 
community call arrangement does not 
remove a hospital’s obligation to 
perform an MSE [medical screening 
examination].’’ The TAG also 
recommended in a subsequent 
recommendation that ‘‘A hospital may 
satisfy its on-call coverage obligation by 
participation in an approved 
community/regional call coverage 
program. (CMS to determine appropriate 
approval process).’’ 
We believe that community call (as 
described below) would afford 
additional flexibility to hospitals 
providing on-call services and improve 
access to specialty physician services 
for individuals in an emergency 
department. Therefore, we are 
proposing to amend our regulations at 
§ 489.24(j) to provide that hospitals may 
comply with the on-call list requirement 
specified at § 489.20(r)(2) (under our 
proposed revision), by participating in a 
formal community call plan so long as 
the plan meets the elements outlined 
below. We are further proposing to 
revise the regulations to state that, 
notwithstanding participation in a 
community call plan, hospitals are still 
required to perform medical screening 
examinations on individuals who 
present seeking treatment and to

23672 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
provide for an appropriate transfer 
when appropriate. 
We propose ‘‘community call,’’ to be 
a formal on-call plan that permits a 
specific hospital in a region to be 
designated as the on-call facility for a 
specific time period, or for a specific 
service, or both. For example, if there 
are two hospitals that choose to 
participate in community call, Hospital 
A could be designated as the on-call 
facility for the first 15 days of each 
month and Hospital B could be 
designated as the on-call facility for the 
rest of each month. Alternatively, 
Hospital A could be designated as on- 
call for cases requiring specialized 
interventional cardiac care, while 
Hospital B could be designated as on- 
call for neurosurgical cases. We 
anticipate that hospitals and their 
communities would have the flexibility 
to develop a plan that reflects their local 
resources and needs. Such a community 
on-call plan will allow various 
physicians in a certain specialty in the 
aggregate to be on continuous call (24 
hours a day, 7 days a week), without 
putting a continuous call obligation on 
any one physician. We note that 
generally if an individual arrives at a 
hospital other than the designated on- 
call facility, is determined to have an 
unstabilized emergency medical 
condition, and requires the services of 
an on-call specialist, the individual 
would be transferred to the designated 
on-call facility in accordance with the 
community call plan. 
As noted above, we are proposing that 
a community call plan must be a formal 
plan among the participating hospitals. 
While we do not believe it is necessary 
for the formal community call plan to be 
subject to preapproval by CMS, if an 
EMTALA complaint investigation is 
initiated, the plan will be subject to 
review and enforcement by CMS. We 
are proposing that, at a minimum, 
hospitals must include the following 
elements when devising a formal 
community call plan: 
• The community call plan would 
include a clear delineation of on-call 
coverage responsibilities, that is, when 
each hospital participating in the plan is 
responsible for on-call coverage. 
• The community call plan would 
define the specific geographic area to 
which the plan applies. 
• The community call plan would be 
signed by an appropriate representative 
of each hospital participating in the 
plan. 
• The community call plan would 
ensure that any local and regional EMS 
system protocol formally includes 
information on community on-call 
arrangements. 
• Hospitals participating in the 
community call plan would engage in 
an analysis of the specialty on-call 
needs of the community for which the 
plan is effective. 
• The community call plan would 
include a statement specifying that even 
if an individual arrives at the hospital 
that is not designated as the on-call 
hospital, that hospital still has an 
EMTALA obligation to provide a 
medical screening examination and 
stabilizing treatment within its 
capability, and hospitals participating in 
community call must abide by the 
EMTALA regulations governing 
appropriate transfers. 
• There would be an annual 
reassessment of the community call 
plan by the participating hospitals. 
Proposed revised § 489.24(j) would 
read ‘‘Availability of on-call physicians. 
In accordance with the on-call list 
requirements specified in § 489.20(r)(2), 
a hospital must have written policies 
and procedures in place—(1) To 
respond to situations in which a 
particular specialty is not available or 
the on-call physician cannot respond 
because of circumstances beyond the 
physician’s control; and (2) To provide 
that emergency services are available to 
meet the needs of individuals with 
emergency medical conditions if a 
hospital elects to—(i) Permit on-call 
physicians to schedule elective surgery 
during the time that they are on call; (ii) 
Permit on-call physicians to have 
simultaneous on-call duties; and (iii) 
Participate in a formal community call 
plan. Notwithstanding participation in a 
community call plan, hospitals are still 
required to perform medical screening 
examinations on individuals who 
present seeking treatment and to 
conduct appropriate transfers. The 
formal community call plan must 
include the following elements: 
[proposed elements noted above in the 
bullets are included in regulations 
text].’’ 
We welcome public comments on the 
proposed elements of the formal 
community call plan noted above. We 
are also soliciting public comments on 
whether individuals believe it is 
important that, in situations where there 
is a governing State or local agency that 
would have authority over the 
development of a formal community 
call plan, the plan be approved by that 
agency. In summary, we are proposing 
that, as part of the obligation to have an 
on-call list, hospitals may choose to 
participate in community call, provided 
that the formal community call plan 
includes, at a minimum, the elements 
noted in bullets above. Additionally, 
each hospital participating in the 
community call plan must have written 
policies and procedures in place to 
respond to situations in which the on- 
call physician is unable to respond due 
to situations beyond his or her control. 
We are further proposing that a hospital 
would still be responsible for 
performing medical screening 
examinations on individuals who 
present to the hospital seeking treatment 
and conducting appropriate transfers, 
regardless of which hospital has on-call 
responsibilities on a particular day. 
5. Proposed Technical Change to 
Regulations 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47413), we 
revised § 489.24(a)(2) (which refers to 
the nonapplicability of the EMTALA 
provisions in an emergency area during 
an emergency period) to conform it to 
the changes made to section 1135 of the 
Act by the Pandemic and All-Hazards 
Preparedness Act. When we made the 
change to the regulations, we 
inadvertently left out language 
consistent with the following statutory 
language found in section 1135: 
‘‘pursuant to an appropriate State 
emergency preparedness plan; or in the 
case of a public health emergency 
described in subsection (g)(1)(B) that 
involves a pandemic infectious disease, 
pursuant to a State pandemic 
preparedness plan or a plan referred to 
in clause (i), whichever is applicable in 
the State.’’ We also inadvertently left 
out the phrase in section 1135 ‘‘during 
an emergency period’’ when we state 
the nonapplicability of the sanctions in 
an emergency area. We are proposing to 
revise the language at § 489.24(a)(2) to 
include the aforementioned language to 
conform the regulation text to the 
statutory language. Proposed revised 
§ 489.24(a)(2) would read as follows: 
‘‘Nonapplicability of provisions of this 
section. Sanctions under this section for 
an inappropriate transfer during a 
national emergency or for the direction 
or relocation of an individual to receive 
medical screening at an alternate 
location pursuant to an appropriate 
State emergency preparedness plan or, 
in the case of a public health emergency 
that involves a pandemic infectious 
disease, pursuant to a State pandemic 
preparedness plan do not apply to a 
hospital with a dedicated emergency 
department located in an emergency 
area during an emergency period, as 
specified in section 1135(g)(1) of the 
Act. A waiver of these sanctions is 
limited to a 72-hour period beginning 
upon the implementation of a hospital 
disaster protocol, except that, if a public 
health emergency involves a pandemic 
infectious disease (such as pandemic

J. Application of Incentives To Reduce 
Avoidable Readmissions to Hospitals 
1. Introduction 
A significant portion of Medicare 
spending—$15 billion each year—is 
related to hospital readmissions. 
According to a 2005 MedPAC 
analysis ,17 nearly 18 percent of 
beneficiaries who are discharged from 
the hospital are readmitted within 30 
days, resulting in approximately 2 
million readmissions. By MedPAC’s 
method, over 13 percent of 30-day 
hospital readmissions and an associated 
$12 billion in spending (4⁄5 of all 
Medicare spending for readmissions) 
were found to be potentially avoidable. 
Beyond cost considerations, 
readmissions may reflect poor quality of 
care and affect beneficiaries’’ quality of 
life. Though not all readmissions are 
avoidable, hospitals should share 
accountability for readmission rates that 
could be much lower through the 
application of evidence-based best 
practices. Interventions that have been 
shown to reduce readmissions include 
better quality of care during the 
hospitalization, more complete care 
plans, emphasis on coordination of care 
at the point of transitions to home or 
postacute care, better use of after- 
hospital care, and more active 
involvement of patients and caregivers 
in decision making. 
The application of incentives to 
reduce hospital readmissions, including 
payment and public reporting 
approaches, could promote the adoption 
and development of best practice 
interventions for averting avoidable 
readmissions, resulting in higher quality 
of care for Medicare beneficiaries and 
reduction in unnecessary costs for the 
program. Under the current payment 
system, readmissions are financially 
rewarding for hospitals. Application of 
payment incentives to encourage 
reduction of avoidable readmissions 
could help address unintended 
incentives in the current payment 
system. 
In this section, following discussion 
of readmission issues related to 
measurement, accountability, and 
interventions, we are presenting three 
approaches to applying incentives to 
reduce avoidable readmissions for 
public comment: (1) Direct adjustment 
to hospital DRG payments for avoidable 
readmissions, (2) adjustments to 
hospital DRG payments through a 
performance-based payment 
methodology, and (3) public reporting of 
readmission rates. We note that either 
type of adjustment to hospital payments 
for readmissions would likely require 
new statutory authority for the Medicare 
program. We are seeking public 
comments on all of the ideas presented 
in this section. 
2. Measurement 
Routine, valid, and reliable 
measurement of hospital-specific rates 
of readmissions would be a prerequisite 
to any method of applying incentives for 
reducing hospital readmissions. 
Measurement data should be 
meaningful and actionable for hospitals 
and should be fair to encourage trust 
and engagement in the effort. Risk 
adjustment of measurement data is 
necessary to account for patientπspecific 
factors that influence the likelihood of 
readmission, such as age, disease 
severity, and comorbidities. 
Another important consideration in 
measurement of readmission rates is the 
time period from discharge to 
readmission (for example, 7, 15, 30, or 
90 days). In section IV.B. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, 
measures of risk-adjusted 30-day 
readmission rates are proposed for the 
RHQDAPU program. The 9th Scope of 
Work for Medicare Quality 
Improvement Organizations (QIO 9th 
SOW) also includes 30-day readmission 
measures for communities. 
Measures should be aligned across 
settings of care. Hospitals are not the 
only providers that affect the occurrence 
of readmissions. For example, the care 
delivered by SNFs and HHAs also has 
an important impact on whether a 
beneficiary is readmitted. Data from 
aligned readmissions measures, 
applicable to various settings of care, 
would provide better information about 
care coordination problems within and 
between settings. Alignment of 
readmissions measures would also 
facilitate more powerful application of 
incentives across Medicare’s payment 
systems. 
Another consideration is whether to 
focus on all readmissions or to focus on 
those that are known to be higher cost, 
more easily preventable, or most 
frequently occurring. For example, 
numerous hospitals have successfully 
implemented programs to reduce 
readmissions of heart failure patients, so 
more is known about the prevention of 
heart failure readmissions. Further, 
heart failure readmissions may be more 
costly than readmissions for other 
conditions. Another focus of efforts to 
prevent readmissions could be patients 
with multiple chronic conditions, who 
may be at the highest risk to experience 
readmissions. 
3. Accountability 
In the assignment of accountability for 
readmissions, risk adjustment of 
measurement data is one consideration 
of fairness; however, other factors must 
also be considered, including 
avoidability and shared accountability. 
Most clinicians would agree that a goal 
of zero readmissions may not be 
appropriate, as an extremely low rate of 
readmissions could indicate restricted 
access to needed medical services, 
overuse of hospital resources during the 
initial hospitalization (for example, 
prolonged length of stay), or excessive 
intensity of post-acute care services. 
Adequate risk adjustment could help to 
elucidate the avoidability of 
readmissions by identifying an expected 
readmission rate for a given patient or 
patient population. 
Shared accountability is another 
important consideration. Hospitals are 
clearly accountable for the care 
provided during hospitalization and can 
also affect the quality of care provided 
after the hospitalization, but hospitals 
are not the only accountable entity. Both 
during and after hospitalization, 
physicians and other health 
professionals share accountability for 
the quality of care. Other provider 
entities, including skilled nursing 
facilities, rehabilitation facilities, home 
health agencies, and end-stage renal 
disease facilities, also share 
accountability for avoidable 
readmissions. Medicare beneficiaries 
themselves and their caregivers and 
social support systems play important 
roles in avoiding readmissions, 
particularly when beneficiaries have 
been discharged to home. 
Assignment of accountability also 
requires consideration of situations 
where the patient presents for 
readmission with a different diagnosis 
or presents to a different hospital. If the

A number of interventions have been 
identified as best practices for averting 
avoidable 
readmissions.18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 Some 
of these evidence-based interventions 
are listed below: 
• Better, safer care during the 
hospitalization. 
• Improved communication among 
providers and with the patient and 
caregivers. 
• Care planning that begins with 
assessment at admission. 
• Clear discharge instructions, with 
specific attention to medication 
management. 
• Shared accountability for care 
coordination, with attention to 
transitions and hand-offs. 
• Discharge to a proper setting of 
care. 
• Better, safer care in the post-acute 
setting of care. 
• Appropriate use of palliative care 
and honest planning for the likely 
course. 
• Timely physician follow up visits. 
• Active involvement of patients and 
their caregivers. 
Interventions such as these have been 
employed by several participants in 
CMS Physician Group Practice 
Demonstration and have contributed to 
improvements in the quality and cost- 
efficiency of care provided to Medicare 
beneficiaries. For example, the 
University of Michigan Faculty Group 
Practice’s transitional care call-back 
program contacts Medicare patients 
discharged from the emergency 
department and acute care hospital to 
address gaps in care during the 
transition between care settings. The 
program provides short-term care 
coordination with linkages to visiting 
nurse and community services, as well 
as coordination with primary care and 
specialty clinics. The Everett Clinic 
utilizes hospital coaches to guide 
patients and caregivers through 
complicated care processes during 
hospital stays and on discharge. The 
clinic proactively reaches out to 
recently hospitalized patients to assure 
that they have a physician followup 
visit within 10 days after discharge to 
address any unresolved or new health 
problems. 
CMS is considering strategies for 
distributing a discharge checklist that 
the agency developed to help 
beneficiaries and their caregivers 
prepare for discharge from a hospital or 
nursing home. The checklist includes a 
range of issues to consider and address 
with physicians and other health care 
providers to facilitate a smooth 
transition to home or postacute care 
setting. In addition, the checklist 
provides information about supportive 
home and community-based services. 
The QIO 9th SOW includes a theme 
entitled Patient Pathways (Care 
Transitions). The goal of this theme is 
to measurably improve the quality of 
care for Medicare beneficiaries who 
transition among care settings, resulting 
in reduced readmissions and replicable 
strategies to sustain reduced 
readmission rates. The QIO 8th SOW 
included initiatives to reduce avoidable 
readmissions of home health patients. 
5. Financial Incentive: Direct Payment 
Adjustment 
The first of three approaches 
presented for comment is direct 
adjustment to hospital DRG payments 
for readmissions. This approach would 
likely require new statutory authority 
for the Medicare program. In section 
II.F. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss direct 
adjustments to MS–DRG payment for 
selected preventable HACs. Similarly, a 
payment adjustment could be applied 
for readmissions determined to be 
avoidable because the hospital did not 
follow evidence-based best practices for 
averting readmissions. The magnitude 
of the payment adjustment could be 
based on patient-specific risk factors 
and on the apportionment of shared 
accountability among the involved 
entities. 
A variation of this approach could be 
adjustment of all hospital payments for 
readmissions, nationwide or by some 
regional designation, based on aggregate 
information about avoidable 
readmissions for the entire relevant 
Medicare population (national or 
regional) under typical circumstances. 
Under this approach, hospitals would 
receive less Medicare payment for 
readmissions for conditions with lower 
expected rates of readmission and less 
shared accountability. 
Potential unintended consequences 
resulting from a financial incentive to 
avert readmissions also need to be 
considered. For example, hospitals 
could begin discharging patients to 
settings that provide more intensive 
postacute care to avoid readmissions, 
thereby potentially driving up total 
costs for episodes of care and total 
Medicare spending. As another example 
of potential unintended consequences, 
hospitals could begin to resist medically 
necessary readmissions from postacute 
care providers, creating an access 
problem. 
6. Financial Incentive: Performance- 
Based Payment Adjustment 
The second approach presented for 
comment is adjustment to hospital MS– 
DRG payments using a performance- 
based payment methodology, such as 
the Medicare Hospital VBP Plan 
referenced in section IV.C. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule and 
available at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
AcuteInpatientPPS/downloads/ 
HospitalVBPPlan
RTCFINALSUBMITTED2007.pdf. The 
intent of the VBP Plan methodology is 
to promote adherence to evidence-based 
best practices in the delivery of care and 
to provide rewards for those who are 
successful in improving their measured 
performance. Implementation of the 
VBP methodology would require new 
statutory authority for the Medicare 
program. 
Under the VBP Plan, measures of 
clinical processes of care, patient 
experience (HCAHPS), and outcomes 
(30-day mortality) would be scored and 
translated into an incentive payment. 
These measures of process, outcome, 
and patient-centeredness address areas 
of quality that are important to reducing 
readmissions; however, other measures 
could be added to more fully adjust 
payments for readmissions. Direct 
measures of hospital-specific, risk 
adjusted readmission rates could be 
included in the VBP Plan performance

assessment model. In addition, other 
measures of care coordination that 
indirectly address readmissions could 
also be included. 
The direct adjustment approach and 
the VBP Plan approaches for applying 
financial incentives to the reduction of 
avoidable readmissions could be 
implemented separately or in 
combination. 
7. Nonfinancial Incentive: Public 
Reporting 
A third approach presented for 
comment is public reporting of hospital- 
specific, risk adjusted readmission rates. 
The Administration’s Value-Driven 
Health Care initiative, which stems from 
the President’s Executive Order 
Promoting Quality and Efficient Health 
Care in Federal Government Health Care 
Programs, calls for Federal agencies to 
make health care quality and cost 
information more transparent. Health 
care consumers, including Medicare 
beneficiaries, and their providers and 
caregivers need better information to 
support more informed decision making 
about their care. The public reporting of 
readmission rates would likely not 
require new statutory authority for the 
Medicare program. 
The Hospital Compare Web site could 
be used to report readmission rates 
along with the other quality and cost of 
care parameters displayed on that site. 
Public reporting has been demonstrated 
to be a strong non-financial incentive 
with a competitive effect, as hospitals 
appropriately focus on maintaining and 
enhancing their reputations as providers 
of high quality of care. The VBP Plan 
envisions public reporting in concert 
with the VBP financial incentive, but 
the public reporting incentive could be 
applied regardless of statutory authority 
to implement the VBP Plan. 
8. Conclusion 
The purpose of this section is to 
solicit and encourage public comments 
on considerations and options for 
applying incentives to reduce avoidable 
hospital readmissions. We welcome 
public comments on readmission issues 
related to measurement, accountability, 
and interventions, as well as on 
potential approaches to applying 
financial and nonfinancial incentives to 
reduce avoidable readmissions. 
K. Rural Community Hospital 
Demonstration Program 
In accordance with the requirements 
of section 410A(a) of Pub. L. 108–173, 
the Secretary has established a 5-year 
demonstration program (beginning with 
selected hospitals’ first cost reporting 
period beginning on or after October 1, 
2004) to test the feasibility and 
advisability of establishing ‘‘rural 
community hospitals’’ for Medicare 
payment purposes for covered inpatient 
hospital services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries. A rural community 
hospital, as defined in section 
410A(f)(1), is a hospital that— 
• Is located in a rural area (as defined 
in section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Act) or is 
treated as being located in a rural area 
under section 1886(d)(8)(E) of the Act; 
• Has fewer than 51 beds (excluding 
beds in a distinct part psychiatric or 
rehabilitation unit) as reported in its 
most recent cost report; 
• Provides 24-hour emergency care 
services; and 
• Is not designated or eligible for 
designation as a CAH. 
Section 410A(a)(4) of Pub. L. 108–173 
states that no more than 15 such 
hospitals may participate in the 
demonstration program. 
As we indicated in the FY 2005 IPPS 
final rule (69 FR 49078), in accordance 
with sections 410A(a)(2) and (a)(4) of 
Pub. L. 108–173 and using 2002 data 
from the U.S. Census Bureau, we 
identified 10 States with the lowest 
population density from which to select 
hospitals: Alaska, Idaho, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North 
Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and 
Wyoming (Source: U.S. Census Bureau 
Statistical Abstract of the United States: 
2003). Nine rural community hospitals 
located within these States are currently 
participating in the demonstration 
program. (Of the 13 hospitals that 
participated in the first 2 years of the 
demonstration program, 4 hospitals 
located in Nebraska have become CAHs 
and have withdrawn from the program.) 
In a notice published in the Federal 
Register on February 6, 2008 (73 FR 
6971 through 6973), we announced a 
solicitation for up to six additional 
hospitals to participate in the 
demonstration program. Hospitals that 
enter the demonstration under this 
solicitation will be able to participate 
for no more than 2 years. The February 
6, 2008 notice specifies the eligibility 
requirements for the demonstration 
program. 
Under the demonstration program, 
participating hospitals are paid the 
reasonable costs of providing covered 
inpatient hospital services (other than 
services furnished by a psychiatric or 
rehabilitation unit of a hospital that is 
a distinct part), applicable for 
discharges occurring in the first cost 
reporting period beginning on or after 
the October 1, 2004 implementation 
date of the demonstration program. 
Payments to the participating hospitals 
will be the lesser amount of the 
reasonable cost or a target amount in 
subsequent cost reporting periods. The 
target amount in the second cost 
reporting period is defined as the 
reasonable costs of providing covered 
inpatient hospital services in the first 
cost reporting period, increased by the 
inpatient prospective payment update 
factor (as defined in section 
1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act) for that 
particular cost reporting period. The 
target amount in subsequent cost 
reporting periods is defined as the 
preceding cost reporting period’s target 
amount, increased by the inpatient 
prospective payment update factor (as 
defined in section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the 
Act) for that particular cost reporting 
period. 
Covered inpatient hospital services 
are inpatient hospital services (defined 
in section 1861(b) of the Act), and 
include extended care services 
furnished under an agreement under 
section 1883 of the Act. 
Section 410A of Pub. L. 108–173 
requires that, ‘‘in conducting the 
demonstration program under this 
section, the Secretary shall ensure that 
the aggregate payments made by the 
Secretary do not exceed the amount 
which the Secretary would have paid if 
the demonstration program under this 
section was not implemented.’’ 
Generally, when CMS implements a 
demonstration program on a budget 
neutral basis, the demonstration 
program is budget neutral in its own 
terms; in other words, the aggregate 
payments to the participating providers 
do not exceed the amount that would be 
paid to those same providers in the 
absence of the demonstration program. 
This form of budget neutrality is viable 
when, by changing payments or aligning 
incentives to improve overall efficiency, 
or both, a demonstration program may 
reduce the use of some services or 
eliminate the need for others, resulting 
in reduced expenditures for the 
demonstration program’s participants. 
These reduced expenditures offset 
increased payments elsewhere under 
the demonstration program, thus 
ensuring that the demonstration 
program as a whole is budget neutral or 
yields savings. However, the small scale 
of this demonstration program, in 
conjunction with the payment 
methodology, makes it extremely 
unlikely that this demonstration 
program could be viable under the usual 
form of budget neutrality. Specifically, 
cost-based payments to participating 
small rural hospitals are likely to 
increase Medicare outlays without 
producing any offsetting reduction in 
Medicare expenditures elsewhere. 
Therefore, a rural community hospital’s

participation in this demonstration 
program is unlikely to yield benefits to 
the participant if budget neutrality were 
to be implemented by reducing other 
payments for these providers. 
In order to achieve budget neutrality 
for this demonstration program for FY 
2009, we are proposing to adjust the 
national inpatient PPS rates by an 
amount sufficient to account for the 
added costs of this demonstration 
program. We are proposing to apply 
budget neutrality across the payment 
system as a whole rather than merely 
across the participants in this 
demonstration program. As we 
discussed in the FY 2005, FY 2006, FY 
2007 and FY 2008 IPPS final rules (69 
FR 49183; 70 FR 47462; 71 FR 48100; 
and 72 FR 47392), we believe that the 
language of the statutory budget 
neutrality requirements permits the 
agency to implement the budget 
neutrality provision in this manner. For 
FY 2009, using data from the cost 
reports from each of the nine hospitals’ 
first year of participation in the 
demonstration program, that is, cost 
reports for years beginning in CY 2005, 
and estimating the cost of six additional 
hospitals based on these data, we 
estimate that the additional cost would 
be $32,011,849. (In the final rule, we 
should know the exact number of 
hospitals participating in the 
demonstration program and would 
revise our estimates accordingly.) This 
estimated adjusted amount reflects the 
estimated difference between the 
participating hospitals costs and the 
IPPS payment based on data from the 
hospitals’ cost reports. We discuss the 
payment rate adjustment that is required 
to ensure the budget neutrality of the 
demonstration program for FY 2009 in 
section II.A.4. of the Addendum to this 
proposed rule. 
V. Proposed Changes to the IPPS for 
Capital-Related Costs 
A. Background 
Section 1886(g) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to pay for the capital-related 
costs of inpatient acute hospital services 
‘‘in accordance with a prospective 
payment system established by the 
Secretary.’’ Under the statute, the 
Secretary has broad authority in 
establishing and implementing the IPPS 
for acute care hospital inpatient capital- 
related costs. We initially implemented 
the IPPS for capital-related costs in the 
Federal fiscal year (FY) 1992 IPPS final 
rule (56 FR 43358), in which we 
established a 10-year transition period 
to change the payment methodology for 
Medicare hospital inpatient capital- 
related costs from a reasonable cost- 
based methodology to a prospective 
methodology (based fully on the Federal 
rate). 
FY 2001 was the last year of the 10- 
year transition period established to 
phase in the IPPS for hospital inpatient 
capital-related costs. For cost reporting 
periods beginning in FY 2002, capital 
IPPS payments are based solely on the 
Federal rate for most acute care 
hospitals (other than hospitals receiving 
certain exception payments and certain 
new hospitals). The basic methodology 
for determining capital prospective 
payments using the Federal rate is set 
forth in § 412.312. For the purpose of 
calculating payments for each discharge, 
the standard Federal rate is adjusted as 
follows: 
(Standard Federal Rate) × (DRG 
Weight) × (Geographic Adjustment 
Factor (GAF)) × (Large Urban Add-on, if 
applicable) × (COLA for hospitals 
located in Alaska and Hawaii) × (1 + 
Capital DSH Adjustment Factor + 
Capital IME Adjustment Factor, if 
applicable). 
Hospitals also may receive outlier 
payments for those cases that qualify 
under the threshold established for each 
fiscal year as specified in § 412.312(c) of 
the regulations. 
1. Exception Payments 
The regulations at § 412.348(f) 
provide that a hospital may request an 
additional payment if the hospital 
incurs unanticipated capital 
expenditures in excess of $5 million due 
to extraordinary circumstances beyond 
the hospital’s control. This policy was 
originally established for hospitals 
during the 10-year transition period, but 
as we discussed in the FY 2003 IPPS 
final rule (67 FR 50102), we revised the 
regulations at § 412.312 to specify that 
payments for extraordinary 
circumstances are also made for cost 
reporting periods after the transition 
period (that is, cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2001). 
Additional information on the exception 
payment for extraordinary 
circumstances in § 412.348(f) can be 
found in the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 
FR 49185 and 49186). 
During the transition period, under 
§§ 412.348(b) through (e), eligible 
hospitals could receive regular 
exception payments. These exception 
payments guaranteed a hospital a 
minimum payment percentage of its 
Medicare allowable capital-related costs 
depending on the class of the hospital 
(§ 412.348(c)), but were available only 
during the 10-year transition period. 
After the end of the transition period, 
eligible hospitals can no longer receive 
this exception payment. However, even 
after the transition period, eligible 
hospitals receive additional payments 
under the special exceptions provisions 
at § 412.348(g), which guarantees all 
eligible hospitals a minimum payment 
of 70 percent of its Medicare allowable 
capital-related costs provided that 
special exceptions payments do not 
exceed 10 percent of total capital IPPS 
payments. Special exceptions payments 
may be made only for the 10 years from 
the cost reporting year in which the 
hospital completes its qualifying 
project, and the hospital must have 
completed the project no later than the 
hospital’s cost reporting period 
beginning before October 1, 2001. Thus, 
an eligible hospital may receive special 
exceptions payments for up to 10 years 
beyond the end of the capital IPPS 
transition period. Hospitals eligible for 
special exceptions payments are 
required to submit documentation to the 
intermediary indicating the completion 
date of their project. (For more detailed 
information regarding the special 
exceptions policy under § 412.348(g), 
we refer readers to the FY 2002 IPPS 
final rule (66 FR 39911 through 39914) 
and the FY 2003 IPPS final rule (67 FR 
50102).) 
2. New Hospitals 
Under the IPPS for capital-related 
costs, § 412.300(b) of the regulations 
defines a new hospital as a hospital that 
has operated (under current or previous 
ownership) for less than 2 years. (For 
more detailed information, we refer 
readers to the FY 1992 IPPS final rule 
(56 FR 43418).) During the 10-year 
transition period, a new hospital was 
exempt from the capital IPPS for its first 
2 years of operation and was paid 85 
percent of its reasonable costs during 
that period. Originally, this provision 
was effective only through the transition 
period and, therefore, ended with cost 
reporting periods beginning in FY 2002. 
Because, as discussed in the FY 2003 
IPPS final rule (67 FR 50101), we 
believe that special protection to new 
hospitals is also appropriate even after 
the transition period, we revised the 
regulations at § 412.304(c)(2) to provide 
that, for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002, a 
new hospital (defined under 
§ 412.300(b)) is paid 85 percent of its 
Medicare allowable capital-related costs 
through its first 2 years of operation, 
unless the new hospital elects to receive 
fully prospective payment based on 100 
percent of the Federal rate. (We refer 
readers to the FY 2002 IPPS final rule 
(66 FR 39910) for a detailed discussion 
of the statutory basis for the system, the 
development and evolution of the 
system, the methodology used to

23677 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
determine capital-related payments to 
hospitals both during and after the 
transition period, and the policy for 
providing exception payments.) 
3. Hospitals Located in Puerto Rico 
Section 412.374 provides for the use 
of a blended payment amount for 
prospective payments for capital-related 
costs to hospitals located in Puerto Rico. 
Accordingly, under the capital IPPS, we 
compute a separate payment rate 
specific to Puerto Rico hospitals using 
the same methodology used to compute 
the national Federal rate for capital- 
related costs. In general, hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico are paid a blend 
of the applicable capital IPPS Puerto 
Rico rate and the applicable capital IPPS 
Federal rate. 
Prior to FY 1998, hospitals in Puerto 
Rico were paid a blended capital IPPS 
rate that consisted of 75 percent of the 
capital IPPS Puerto Rico specific rate 
and 25 percent of the capital IPPS 
Federal rate. However, effective October 
1, 1997 (FY 1998), in conjunction with 
the change to the operating IPPS blend 
percentage for hospitals located in 
Puerto Rico required by section 4406 of 
Pub. L. 105–33, we revised the 
methodology for computing capital IPPS 
payments to hospitals in Puerto Rico to 
be based on a blend of 50 percent of the 
capital IPPS Puerto Rico rate and 50 
percent of the capital IPPS Federal rate. 
Similarly, in conjunction with the 
change in operating IPPS payments to 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico for FY 
2005 required by section 504 of Pub. L. 
108–173, we again revised the 
methodology for computing capital IPPS 
payments to hospitals located in Puerto 
Rico to be based on a blend of 25 
percent of the capital IPPS Puerto Rico 
rate and 75 percent of the capital IPPS 
Federal rate effective for discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 2004. 
B. Revisions to the Capital IPPS Based 
on Data on Hospital Medicare Capital 
Margins 
As noted above, under the Secretary’s 
broad authority under the statute in 
establishing and implementing the IPPS 
for hospital inpatient capital-related 
costs, we have established a standard 
Federal payment rate for capital-related 
costs, as well as the mechanism for 
updating that rate each year. For FY 
1992, we computed the standard 
Federal payment rate for capital-related 
costs under the IPPS by updating the FY 
1989 Medicare inpatient capital cost per 
case by an actuarial estimate of the 
increase in Medicare inpatient capital 
costs per case. Each year after FY 1992, 
we update the capital standard Federal 
rate, as provided at § 412.308(c)(1), to 
account for capital input price increases 
and other factors. The regulations at 
§ 412.308(c)(2) provide that the capital 
Federal rate is adjusted annually by a 
factor equal to the estimated proportion 
of outlier payments under the capital 
Federal rate to total capital payments 
under the capital Federal rate. In 
addition, § 412.308(c)(3) requires that 
the capital Federal rate be reduced by an 
adjustment factor equal to the estimated 
proportion of payments for (regular and 
special) exceptions under § 412.348. 
Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that 
the capital standard Federal rate be 
adjusted so that the effects of the annual 
DRG reclassification and the 
recalibration of DRG weights, and 
changes in the geographic adjustment 
factor are budget neutral. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47398 through 
47401), based on our analysis of data on 
inpatient hospital Medicare capital 
margins that we obtained through our 
monitoring and comprehensive review 
of the adequacy of the standard Federal 
payment rate for capital-related costs 
and the updates provided under the 
existing regulations, we made changes 
in the payment structure under the 
capital IPPS beginning with FY 2008. 
We summarize these changes below. We 
refer readers to section V.B. of the 
preamble of the FY 2008 final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47393 through 
47401) for a detailed discussion of the 
data used as a basis for these changes. 
These data showed that hospital 
inpatient Medicare capital margins were 
very high across all hospitals during the 
period from FY 1996 through FY 2004. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, as background, we 
noted that, in general, under a PPS, 
standard payment rates should reflect 
the costs that an average, efficient 
provider would bear to provide the 
services required for quality patient 
care. Payment rate updates should also 
account for the changes necessary to 
continue providing such services. 
Updates should reflect, for example, the 
increased costs that are necessary to 
provide for the introduction of new 
technology that improves patient care. 
Updates should also take into account 
the productivity gains that, over time, 
allow providers to realize the same, or 
even improved, quality outcomes with 
reduced inputs and lower costs. 
Hospital margins, the difference 
between the costs of actually providing 
services and the payments received 
under a particular system, thus provide 
some evidence concerning whether 
payment rates have been established 
and updated at an appropriate level over 
time for efficient providers to provide 
necessary services. All other factors 
being equal, sustained substantial 
positive margins demonstrate that 
payment rates and updates have 
exceeded what is required to provide 
those services. It is to be expected, 
under a PPS, that highly efficient 
providers might regularly realize 
positive margins, while less efficient 
providers might regularly realize 
negative margins. However, a PPS that 
is correctly calibrated should not 
necessarily experience sustained 
periods in which providers generally 
realize substantial positive Medicare 
margins. Under the capital IPPS in 
particular, it seems especially 
appropriate that there should not be 
sustained significant positive margins 
across the system as a whole. Prior to 
the implementation of the capital IPPS, 
Congress mandated that the Medicare 
program pay only 85 percent of 
hospitals’ inpatient Medicare capital 
costs. During the first 5 years of the 
capital IPPS, Congress also mandated a 
budget neutrality adjustment, under 
which the standard Federal capital rate 
was set each year so that payments 
under the system as a whole equaled 90 
percent of estimated hospitals’ inpatient 
Medicare capital costs for the year. 
Finally, Congress has twice adjusted the 
standard Federal capital rate (a 7.4 
percent reduction beginning in FY 1994, 
followed by a 17.78 percent reduction 
beginning in FY 1998). On the second 
occasion in particular, the specific 
congressional mandate was ‘‘to apply 
the budget neutrality factor used to 
determine the Federal capital payment 
rate in effect on September 30, 1995 
* * * to the unadjusted standard 
Federal capital payment rate’’ for FY 
1998 and beyond. (The designated 
budget neutrality factor constituted a 
17.78 percent reduction.) This statutory 
language indicates that Congress 
considered the payment levels in effect 
during FYs1992 through 1995, 
established under the budget neutrality 
provision to pay 90 percent of hospitals’ 
inpatient Medicare capital costs in the 
aggregate, appropriate for the capital 
IPPS. The statutory history of the capital 
IPPS thus suggests that the system in the 
aggregate should not provide for 
continuous, large positive margins. 
As we also discussed in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period, 
we believed that there could be a 
number of reasons for the relatively high 
margins that most IPPS hospitals have 
realized under the capital IPPS. One 
possibility is that the updates to the 
capital IPPS rates have been higher than 
the actual increases in Medicare 
inpatient capital costs that hospitals

23678 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
have experienced in recent years. 
Another possible reason for the 
relatively high margins of most capital 
IPPS hospitals may be that the payment 
adjustments provided under the system 
are too high, or perhaps even 
unnecessary. Specifically, the 
adjustments for teaching hospitals, 
disproportionate share hospitals, and 
large urban hospitals appear to be 
contributing to excessive payment levels 
for these classes of hospitals. Since the 
inception of the capital IPPS in FY 
1992, the system has provided 
adjustments for teaching hospitals (the 
IME adjustment factor, under § 412.322 
of the regulations), disproportionate 
share hospitals (the DSH adjustment 
factor, under § 412.320), and large urban 
hospitals (the large urban location 
adjustment factor, under § 412.316(b)). 
The classes of hospitals eligible for 
these adjustments have been realizing 
much higher margins than other 
hospitals under the system. Specifically, 
teaching hospitals (11.6 percent for FYs 
1998 through 2004), disproportionate 
share hospitals (8.4 percent), and urban 
hospitals (8.3 percent) have had 
significant positive margins. Other 
classes of hospitals have experienced 
much lower margins, especially rural 
hospitals (0.3 percent for FYs 1998 
through 2004) and nonteaching 
hospitals (1.3 percent). The three groups 
of hospitals that have been realizing 
especially high margins under the 
capital IPPS are, therefore, classes of 
hospitals that are eligible to receive one 
or more specific payment adjustment 
under the system. We believed that the 
evidence indicates that these 
adjustments have been contributing to 
the significantly large positive margins 
experienced by the classes of hospitals 
eligible for these adjustments. 
Therefore, in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period, we made 
two changes to the structure of 
payments under the capital IPPS, as 
discussed under items 1. and 2. below. 
1. Elimination of the Large Add-On 
Payment Adjustment 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we determined that 
the data we had gathered on inpatient 
hospital Medicare capital margins 
provided sufficient evidence to warrant 
elimination of the large urban add-on 
payment adjustment starting in FY 2008 
under the capital IPPS. Therefore, for 
FYs 2008 and beyond, we discontinued 
the 3.0 percent additional payment that 
had been provided to hospitals located 
in large urban areas (72 FR 24822). This 
decision was supported by comments 
from MedPAC. 
2. Changes to the Capital IME 
Adjustment 
a. Background and Changes Made for FY 
2008 
In the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule, 
we noted that margin analysis indicated 
that several classes of hospitals had 
experienced continuous, significant 
positive margins. The analysis indicated 
that the existing payment adjustments 
for teaching hospitals and 
disproportionate share hospitals were 
contributing to excessive payment levels 
for these classes of hospitals. Therefore, 
we stated that it may be appropriate to 
reduce these adjustments significantly, 
or even to eliminate them altogether, 
within the capital IPPS. These payment 
adjustments, unlike parallel adjustments 
under the operating IPPS, were not 
mandated by the Act. Rather, they were 
included within the original design of 
the capital IPPS under the Secretary’s 
broad authority in section 1886(g)(1) of 
the Act to include appropriate 
adjustments and exceptions within a 
capital IPPS. In the FY 2008 final rule 
with comment period, we also noted a 
MedPAC recommendation that we 
seriously reexamine the appropriateness 
of the existing capital IME adjustment, 
that the margin analysis indicated such 
adjustment may be too high, and that 
MedPAC’s previous analysis also 
suggested the adjustment may be too 
high. In light of MedPAC’s 
recommendation, we extended the 
margin analysis discussed in the FY 
2008 IPPS proposed rule in order to 
distinguish the experience of teaching 
hospitals from the experience of urban 
and rural hospitals generally. 
Specifically, we isolated the margins of 
urban, large urban, and rural teaching 
hospitals, as opposed to urban, large 
urban, and rural nonteaching hospitals. 
In conducting this analysis, we 
employed updated cost report 
information, which allowed us to 
incorporate the margins for an 
additional year, FY 2005, into the 
analysis. The data on the experience of 
urban, large urban, and rural teaching 
hospitals as opposed to nonteaching 
hospitals provided significant new 
information. As the analysis 
demonstrated, teaching hospitals in 
each class (urban, large urban, and 
rural) performed significantly better 
than comparable nonteaching hospitals. 
For the period covering FYs 1998 
through 2005, urban teaching hospitals 
realized aggregate positive margins of 
11.9 percent, compared to a positive 
margin of 0.9 percent for urban 
nonteaching hospitals. Similarly, large 
urban teaching hospitals realized an 
aggregate positive margin of 12.8 
percent during that period, while large 
urban nonteaching hospitals had an 
aggregate positive margin of only 2.9 
percent. Finally, rural teaching hospitals 
experienced an aggregate positive 
margin of 4.5 percent, as compared to a 
negative 1.3 percent margin for 
nonteaching rural hospitals. We noted 
that the positive margins for teaching 
hospitals did not exhibit a decline to the 
same degree as the margins for all 
hospitals. For example, the positive 
margins for all IPPS hospitals declined 
from 8.7 percent in FY 2002 to 5.3 
percent in FY 2004 and 3.7 percent in 
FY 2005. For urban hospitals, aggregate 
margins decreased from 10.3 percent in 
FY 2002 to 6.4 percent in FY 2004 and 
4.8 percent in FY 2005. Rural hospitals 
experienced a decrease from 1.5 percent 
in FY 2001 to a negative margin of -4.2 
percent in FY 2005. In comparison, the 
aggregate margin for teaching hospitals 
was 12.1 percent in FY 2001 and 10.6 
percent in FY 2005. For urban teaching 
hospitals, margins were 12.5 percent in 
FY 2001, 14.0 percent in FY 2002, 13.6 
percent in FY 2003, 11.9 percent in FY 
2004, and 10.9 percent in FY 2005. 
Rural teaching hospital margins were 
more variable, but did not exhibit a 
pattern of significant decline. In FY 
2001, rural teaching hospitals had a 
positive margin of 3.2 percent; in FY 
2002, 8.2 percent; in FY 2003, 4.7 
percent; in FY 2004, 5.7 percent; and in 
FY 2005, 4.0 percent. We are reprinting 
below the table found in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period 
showing our analysis (72 FR 47400).

Notes: 
Based on Medicare Cost Report hospital data updated as of the 1st quarter of 2007. 
Medicare payments are from Worksheet E, Part A, Lines 9 and 10. 
Expenses are from Worksheet D, Part I, columns 10 and 12 and Part II, columns 6 and 8. 
We apply the outlier trimming methodology developed with MedPAC. 
Code 99 applies when census division information was not specified in the Medicare Cost Report hospital data. 
As we indicated in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47401), the statutory history of the 
capital IPPS suggests that the system in 
the aggregate should not provide for 
continuous, large positive margins. As 
we also indicated, a possible reason for 
the relatively high margins of many 
capital IPPS hospitals may be that the 
payment adjustments provided under 
the system are too high, or perhaps even 
unnecessary. We agreed with MedPAC’s 
recommendation and reexamined the 
appropriateness of the teaching 
adjustment. We concluded that the 
record of relatively high and persistent 
positive margins for teaching hospitals 
under the capital IPPS indicated that the 
teaching adjustment is unnecessary, and 
that it was therefore appropriate to 
exercise our discretion under the capital 
IPPS to eliminate this adjustment. At 
the same time, we believed that we 
should mitigate abrupt changes in 
payment policy and that we should 
provide time for hospitals to adjust to 
changes in the payments that they can 
expect under the program. 
Therefore, in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period, we adopted 
a policy to phase out the capital 
teaching adjustment over a 3-year 
period beginning in FY 2008. 
Specifically, we maintained the 
adjustment for FY 2008, in order to give 
teaching hospitals an opportunity to 
plan and make adjustments to the 
change. During the second year of the 
transition, FY 2009, the formula for 
determining the amount of the teaching 
adjustment was revised so that 
adjustment amounts will be half of the 
amounts provided under the current 
formula. For FY 2010 and after, 
hospitals will no longer receive an 
adjustment for teaching activity under 
the capital IPPS. 
b. Public Comments Received on Phase 
Out of Capital IPPS Teaching 
Adjustment Provisions Included in the 
FY 2008 Final Rule With Comment 
Period and Further Solicitation of 
Public Comments 
As indicated above, in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period, 
we formally adopted as final policy a 
phase out of the capital IPPS teaching 
adjustment over a 3-year period, 
maintaining the current adjustment for 
FY 2008, making a 50-percent reduction 
in FY 2009, and eliminating the 
adjustment for FY 2010 and subsequent 
years. However, because we concluded 
that this change to the structure of 
payments under the capital IPPS was 
significant, we provided the public with 
an opportunity for further comment on 
these provisions through a 90-day 
comment period after publication of the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 47401). In addition, as we 
indicated in that final rule with 
comment period, to provide a more than 
adequate opportunity for hospitals, 
associations, and other interested 
parties to raise issues and concerns 
related to our policy, we are providing 
additional opportunity for public 
comment during this FY 2009 proposed 
rulemaking cycle for the IPPS. 
We received numerous timely pieces 
of correspondence that commented on 
the policy of phasing out the capital 
IPPS teaching adjustment as described 
in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period. These comments are 
available on our e-rulemaking Web site, 
at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
eRulemaking/ECCMSR/list.asp. We will 
also accept public comments on this 
policy during the comment period for 
this proposed rule. We will respond to

both sets of public comments when we 
issue the FY 2009 IPPS final rule, which 
is scheduled for publication in August 
2008. 
VI. Proposed Changes for Hospitals and 
Hospital Units Excluded From the IPPS 
A. Proposed Payments to Excluded 
Hospitals and Hospital Units 
Historically, hospitals and hospital 
units excluded from the prospective 
payment system received payment for 
inpatient hospital services they 
furnished on the basis of reasonable 
costs, subject to a rate-of-increase 
ceiling. An annual per discharge limit 
(the target amount as defined in 
§ 413.40(a)) was set for each hospital or 
hospital unit based on the hospital’s 
own cost experience in its base year. 
The target amount was multiplied by 
the Medicare discharges and applied as 
an aggregate upper limit (the ceiling as 
defined in § 413.40(a)) on total inpatient 
operating costs for a hospital’s cost 
reporting period. Prior to October 1, 
1997, these payment provisions applied 
consistently to all categories of excluded 
providers, which include rehabilitation 
hospitals and units (now referred to as 
IRFs), psychiatric hospitals and units 
(now referred to as IPFs), LTCHs, 
children’s hospitals, and cancer 
hospitals. 
Payment for children’s hospitals and 
cancer hospitals that are excluded from 
the IPPS continues to be subject to the 
rate-of-increase ceiling based on the 
hospital’s own historical cost 
experience. (We note that, in accordance 
with § 403.752(a) of the regulations, 
RNHCIs are also subject to the rate-of- 
increase limits established under 
§ 413.40 of the regulations.) 
In this FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule, 
we are proposing that the percentage 
increase in the rate-of-increase limits for 
cancer and children’s hospitals and 
RNHCIs would be the proposed 
percentage increase in the FY 2009 IPPS 
operating market basket, which is 
estimated to be 3.0 percent. Consistent 
with our historical approach, we 
calculated the proposed IPPS operating 
market basket for FY 2009 using the 
most recent data available. However, if 
more recent data are available for the 
final rule, we will use them to calculate 
the IPPS operating market basket. For 
cancer and children’s hospitals and 
RNHCIs, the proposed FY 2009 rate-of- 
increase percentage that is applied to FY 
2008 target amounts in order to 
calculate FY 2009 target amounts is 3.0 
percent, based on Global Insight, Inc.’s 
2008 first quarter forecast of the IPPS 
operating market basket increase, in 
accordance with the applicable 
regulations in 42 CFR 413.40. 
IRFs, IPFs, and LTCHs were paid 
previously under the reasonable cost 
methodology. However, the statute was 
amended to provide for the 
implementation of prospective payment 
systems for IRFs, IPFs, and LTCHs. In 
general, the prospective payment 
systems for IRFs, IPFs, and LTCHs 
provided transition periods of varying 
lengths during which time a portion of 
the prospective payment was based on 
cost-based reimbursement rules under 
Part 413 (certain providers do not 
receive a transition period or may elect 
to bypass the transition period as 
applicable under 42 CFR Part 412, 
Subparts N, O, and P). We note that the 
various transition periods provided for 
under the IRF PPS, the IPF PPS, and the 
LTCH PPS have ended. 
For cost reporting periods beginning 
on or after October 1, 2002, all IRFs are 
paid 100 percent of the adjusted Federal 
rate under the IRF PPS. Therefore, for 
cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 2002, no portion of an 
IRF PPS payment is subject to 42 CFR 
Part 413. Similarly, for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2006, all LTCHs are paid 100 percent of 
the adjusted Federal prospective 
payment rate under the LTCH PPS. 
Therefore, for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2006, 
no portion of the LTCH PPS payment is 
subject to 42 CFR Part 413. (We note 
that, to the extent a portion of a LTCH’s 
PPS payment was subject to reasonable 
cost principles, the Secretary utilized 
his broad authority under section 123 of 
the BBRA, as amended by section 307 
of the BIPA, to make such portion 
subject to 42 CFR Part 413 and various 
provisions in section 1886(b) of the 
Act.) Likewise, for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2008, all IPFs are paid 100 percent of 
the Federal per diem amount under the 
IPF PPS. Therefore, for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2008, no portion of an IPF PPS payment 
is subject to 42 CFR Part 413. 
B. IRF PPS 
Section 1886(j) of the Act, as added by 
section 4421(a) of Pub. L. 105–33, 
provided for a phase-in of a case-mix 
adjusted PPS for inpatient hospital 
services furnished by IRFs for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 2000, and before October 1, 
2002, with payments based entirely on 
the adjusted Federal prospective 
payment for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002. 
Section 1886(j) of the Act was amended 
by section 125 of Pub. L. 106–113 to 
require the Secretary to use a discharge 
as the payment unit for services 
furnished under the PPS for inpatient 
rehabilitation hospitals and inpatient 
rehabilitation units of hospitals (referred 
to as IRFs), and to establish classes of 
patient discharges by functional-related 
groups. Section 305 of Pub. L. 106–554 
further amended section 1886(j) of the 
Act to allow IRFs, subject to the blended 
methodology, to elect to be paid the full 
Federal prospective payment rather than 
the transitional period payments 
specified in the Act. 
On August 7, 2001, we issued a final 
rule in the Federal Register (66 FR 
41316) establishing the PPS for IRFs, 
effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2002. 
There was a transition period for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2002, and ending before 
October 1, 2002. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2002, payments are based entirely on 
the adjusted Federal prospective 
payment rate determined under the IRF 
PPS. 
C. LTCH PPS 
On August 30, 2002, we issued a final 
rule in the Federal Register (67 FR 
55954) establishing the PPS for LTCHs, 
effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002. 
Except for a LTCH that made an election 
under § 412.533(c) or a LTCH that is 
defined as new under § 412.23(e)(4), 
there was a transition period under 
§ 412.533(a) for LTCHs. For cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 2006, all LTCHs are paid 100 
percent of the adjusted Federal 
prospective payment rate. 
D. IPF PPS 
In accordance with section 124 of 
Pub. L. 106–113 and section 405(g)(2) of 
Pub. L. 108–173, we established a PPS 
for inpatient hospital services furnished 
in IPFs. On November 15, 2004, we 
issued in the Federal Register a final 
rule (69 FR 66922) that established the 
IPF PPS, effective for IPF cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2005. Under the requirements of that 
final rule, we computed a Federal per 
diem base rate to be paid to all IPFs for 
inpatient psychiatric services based on 
the sum of the average routine 
operating, ancillary, and capital costs 
for each patient day of psychiatric care 
in an IPF, adjusted for budget neutrality. 
The Federal per diem base rate is 
adjusted to reflect certain patient 
characteristics, including age, specified 
DRGs, selected high-cost comorbidities, 
days of the stay, and certain facility 
characteristics, including a wage index

adjustment, rural location, indirect 
teaching costs, the presence of a full- 
service emergency department, and 
COLAs for IPFs located in Alaska and 
Hawaii. 
We established a 3-year transition 
period during which IPFs whose cost 
reporting periods began on or after 
January 1, 2005, and before January 1, 
2008, would be paid a PPS payment, a 
portion of which was based on 
reasonable cost principles and a portion 
of which was the Federal per diem 
payment amount. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2008, all IPFs are paid 100 percent of 
the Federal per diem payment amount. 
E. Determining Proposed LTCH Cost-to- 
Charge Ratios (CCRs) Under the LTCH 
PPS 
In general, we use a LTCH’s overall 
CCR, which is computed based on either 
the most recently settled cost report or 
the most recent tentatively settled cost 
report, whichever is from the latest cost 
reporting period, in accordance with 
§ 412.525(a)(4)(iv)(B) and 
§ 412.529(c)(4)(iv)(B) for high cost 
outliers and short-stay outliers, 
respectively. (We note that, in some 
instances, we use an alternative CCR, 
such as the statewide average CCR in 
accordance with the regulations at 
§ 412.525(a)(4)(iv)(C) and 
§ 412.529(c)(4)(iv)(C), or a CCR that is 
specified by CMS or that is requested by 
the hospital under the provisions of the 
regulations at § 412.525(a)(4)(iv)(A) and 
§ 412.529(c)(4)(iv)(A).) Under the LTCH 
PPS, a single prospective payment per 
discharge is made for both inpatient 
operating and capital-related costs. 
Therefore, we compute a single 
‘‘overall’’ or ‘‘total’’ LTCH-specific CCR 
based on the sum of LTCH operating 
and capital costs (as described in 
Chapter 3, section 150.24, of the 
Medicare Claims Processing Manual 
(CMS Pub. 100–4)) as compared to total 
charges. Specifically, a LTCH’s CCR is 
calculated by dividing a LTCH’s total 
Medicare costs (that is, the sum of its 
operating and capital inpatient routine 
and ancillary costs) by its total Medicare 
charges (that is, the sum of its operating 
and capital inpatient routine and 
ancillary charges). 
Generally, a LTCH is assigned the 
applicable statewide average CCR if, 
among other things, a LTCH’s CCR is 
found to be in excess of the applicable 
maximum CCR threshold (that is, the 
LTCH CCR ceiling). This is because 
CCRs above this threshold are most 
likely due to faulty data reporting or 
entry, and, therefore, these CCRs should 
not be used to identify and make 
payments for outlier cases. Such data 
are clearly errors and should not be 
relied upon. Thus, under our 
established policy, generally, if a 
LTCH’s calculated CCR is above the 
applicable ceiling, the applicable LTCH 
PPS statewide average CCR is assigned 
to the LTCH instead of the CCR 
computed from its most recent (settled 
or tentatively settled) cost report data. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, in accordance with 
§ 412.525(a)(4)(iv)(C)(2) for high-cost 
outliers and § 412.529(c)(4)(iv)(C)(2) for 
short-stay outliers, using our established 
methodology for determining the LTCH 
total CCR ceiling, based on IPPS total 
CCR data from the March 2007 update 
to the Provider-Specific File (PSF), we 
established a total CCR ceiling of 1.284 
under the LTCH PPS effective October 
1, 2007, through September 30, 2008. 
(For further detail on our methodology 
for annually determining the LTCH total 
CCR ceiling, we refer readers to the FY 
2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 48117 
through 48121) and the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47403 through 47404).) 
Our general methodology established 
for determining the statewide average 
CCRs used under the LTCH PPS is 
similar to our established methodology 
for determining the LTCH total CCR 
ceiling (described above) because it is 
based on ‘‘total’’ IPPS CCR data. Under 
the LTCH PPS high-cost outlier policy at 
§ 412.525(a)(4)(iv)(C) and the short-stay 
outlier policy at § 412.529(c)(4)(iv)(C), 
the fiscal intermediary (or MAC) may 
use a statewide average CCR, which is 
established annually by CMS, if it is 
unable to determine an accurate CCR for 
a LTCH in one of the following 
circumstances: (1) A new LTCH that has 
not yet submitted its first Medicare cost 
report (for this purpose, a new LTCH is 
defined as an entity that has not 
accepted assignment of an existing 
hospital’s provider agreement in 
accordance with § 489.18); (2) a LTCH 
whose CCR is in excess of the LTCH 
CCR ceiling (as discussed above); and 
(3) any other LTCH for whom data with 
which to calculate a CCR are not 
available (for example, missing or faulty 
data). (Other sources of data that the 
fiscal intermediary (or MAC) may 
consider in determining a LTCH’s CCR 
include data from a different cost 
reporting period for the LTCH, data 
from the cost reporting period preceding 
the period in which the hospital began 
to be paid as a LTCH (that is, the period 
of at least 6 months that it was paid as 
a short-term acute care hospital), or data 
from other comparable LTCHs, such as 
LTCHs in the same chain or in the same 
region.) 
In this proposed rule, in accordance 
with § 412.525(a)(4)(iv)(C)(2) for high- 
cost outliers and 
§ 412.529(c)(4)(iv)(C)(2) for short-stay 
outliers, using our established 
methodology for determining the LTCH 
total CCR ceiling (described above), 
based on IPPS total CCR data from the 
December 2007 update to the PSF), we 
are proposing a total CCR ceiling of 
1.262 under the LTCH PPS, effective for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2008, and before October 1, 2009. If 
more recent data become available 
before publication of the final rule, we 
will use such data to determine the final 
total CCR ceiling under the LTCH PPS 
for FY 2009. 
In this FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule, 
in accordance with § 412.525(a)(4)(iv)(C) 
for high-cost outliers and 
§ 412.529(c)(4)(iv)(C) for short-stay 
outliers, using our established 
methodology for determining the LTCH 
statewide average CCRs (described 
above), based on the most recent 
complete IPPS total CCR data from the 
December 2007 update of the PSF, we 
are proposing LTCH PPS statewide 
average total CCRs for urban and rural 
hospitals that would be effective for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2008, and before October 1, 2009, 
presented in Table 8C of the Addendum 
to this proposed rule. If more recent 
data become available before 
publication of the final rule, we will use 
such data to determine the final 
statewide average total CCRs for urban 
and rural hospitals under the LTCH PPS 
for FY 2009 using our established 
methodology described above. 
We note that, for this proposed rule, 
as we established when we revised our 
methodology for determining the 
applicable LTCH statewide average 
CCRs in the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 
FR 48119 through 48121), and as is the 
case under the IPPS, all areas in the 
District of Columbia, New Jersey, Puerto 
Rico, and Rhode Island are classified as 
urban, and, therefore, there are no 
proposed rural statewide average total 
CCRs listed for those jurisdictions in 
Table 8C of the Addendum to this 
proposed rule. In addition, as we 
established when we revised our 
methodology for determining the 
applicable LTCH statewide average 
CCRs in that same final rule, and as is 
the case under the IPPS, although 
Massachusetts has areas that are 
designated as rural, there were no short- 
term acute care IPPS hospitals or LTCHs 
located in those areas as of December 
2007. Therefore, for this proposed rule, 
there is no proposed rural statewide 
average total CCR listed for rural 
Massachusetts in Table 8C of the

23682 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Addendum of this proposed rule. As we 
also established when we revised our 
methodology for determining the 
applicable LTCH statewide average 
CCRs in the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 
FR 48120 through 48121), in 
determining the urban and rural 
statewide average total CCRs for 
Maryland LTCHs paid under the LTCH 
PPS, we use, as a proxy, the national 
average total CCR for urban IPPS 
hospitals and the national average total 
CCR for rural IPPS hospitals, 
respectively. We use this proxy because 
we believe that the CCR data on the PSF 
for Maryland hospitals may not be 
accurate (as discussed in greater detail 
in that same final rule (71 FR 48120)). 
F. Proposed Change to the Regulations 
Governing Hospitals-Within-Hospitals 
On September 1, 1994, we published 
hospital-within-hospital (HwH) 
regulations for LTCHs to address 
inappropriate Medicare payments to 
entities that were effectively units of 
other hospitals (59 FR 45330). There 
was concern that the HwH model was 
being used by some acute care hospitals 
paid under the IPPS as a way of 
inappropriately receiving higher 
payments for a subset of their cases. 
Moreover, IPPS-exclusion of long-term 
care ‘‘units’’ was and remains 
inconsistent with the statutory scheme. 
Therefore, we established the HwH 
regulations at 42 CFR 412.23 (currently 
at § 412.22) for a LTCH HwH that is co- 
located with another hospital. A co- 
located hospital is a hospital that 
occupies space in the same building or 
on the same campus as another hospital. 
The regulations at § 412.23(e) required 
that, to be excluded from the IPPS, long- 
term care HwHs must have a separate 
governing body, chief medical officer, 
medical staff, and chief executive officer 
from that of the co-located hospital. In 
addition, the HwH must meet either of 
the following two criteria: The HwH 
must perform certain specified basic 
hospital functions on its own and not 
receive them from the host hospital or 
a third entity that controls both 
hospitals; or the HwH must receive at 
least 75 percent of its inpatients from 
sources other than the co-located 
hospital. A third option was added to 
the regulations on September 1, 1995 
(60 FR 45778) that allowed HwHs to 
demonstrate their separateness by 
showing that the cost of the services that 
the hospital obtains under contracts or 
other agreements with the co-located 
hospital or a third entity that controls 
both hospitals is no more than 15 
percent. In 1997, we extended 
application of the HwH rules at § 412.22 
to all classes of IPPS excluded hospitals. 
Therefore, effective for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1997, psychiatric, rehabilitation, cancer, 
and children’s hospitals that are co- 
located with another hospital are also 
required to meet the ‘‘separateness’’ 
criteria at § 412.22(e). 
In addition, a ‘‘grandfathering’’ 
provision was added to the regulations 
at § 412.22(f), as provided for under 
section 4417 of the Balanced Budget Act 
(BBA) of 1997 (Pub. L. 105–33). This 
provision of the regulations allowed a 
LTCH that was excluded from the IPPS 
on or before September 30, 1995, and at 
that time occupied space in a building 
also used by another hospital, or in one 
or more buildings located on the same 
campus as buildings used by another 
hospital, to retain its IPPS-excluded 
status even if the HwH criteria at 
§ 412.22(e) could not be met, as long as 
the hospital continued to operate under 
the same terms and conditions as were 
in effect on September 30, 1995. 
Consistent with the grandfathering 
provision under the BBA, which only 
applied to LTCHs, we extended the 
application of the grandfathering rule to 
the other classes of IPPS-excluded 
hospitals that are HwHs but did not 
meet the criteria at § 412.22(e). (We 
subsequently expanded this provision to 
allow for a grandfathered hospital to 
make specified changes during 
particular timeframes.) 
Despite our efforts to allow those 
HwHs for whom the IPPS-exclusion 
status is appropriate to meet the HwH 
criteria, it appears that there may be a 
gap in our regulations. There remain 
certain HwHs under current rules that 
may be unnecessarily restricted from 
expanding their bed size. These HwHs 
are State hospitals that are co-located 
with another State hospital and that are 
grandfathered under § 412.22(f). Where 
a State law defines the structure and 
authority of the State’s agencies and 
institutions, and the State hospital is co- 
located with another hospital that is 
under State governance, each hospital 
may have control over the day-to-day 
operations of its respective facility and 
have separate management, patient 
intake, and billing systems and medical 
staff, as well as a governing board. 
However, State law may require that the 
legal accountability for the budgets and 
activities of entities operating within a 
State-run institution rests with the State. 
Therefore, the co-located State hospitals 
may also be governed by a common 
governing body. Because of State law 
requirements, these HwHs are, 
therefore, precluded from meeting the 
HwH criteria at § 412.22(e)(1)(i) that 
requires the governing body of a co- 
located hospital to be separate from the 
governing body of the hospital with 
which it shares space. The excluded 
hospital’s governing body cannot be 
under the control of the hospital 
occupying space in the same building or 
on the same campus, or of any third 
entity that controls both hospitals. 
Currently, there are State HwHs in these 
types of arrangements that have been 
able to retain their IPPS-excluded status 
solely because of the grandfathering 
provision in § 412.22(f). These HwHs 
were IPPS-excluded even before the 
HwH criteria were implemented and 
only remain excluded HwHs under 
§ 412.22(f) as long as they continue to 
meet the requirements specified under 
§ 412.22(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3). Because 
they are grandfathered, these HwHs 
cannot increase their bed size without 
losing their IPPS-excluded status under 
the grandfathering provisions 
(§ 412.22(f)). Furthermore, if a 
grandfathered State-run HwH increased 
its bed size, it would be unable to 
qualify as an IPPS-excluded HwH under 
§ 412.22(e) because it cannot meet the 
HwH criteria at § 412.22(e)(1)(i) as a 
result of State law requirements 
regarding its organizational structure 
and governance. These HwHs are 
precluded from the flexibility to expand 
their bed size, which is available to 
other HwHs whose organizational 
structure is not bound by State law. 
As discussed in the previous 
paragraph, the organizational 
arrangements were in place for these 
State-operated HwHs before the HwH 
regulations were adopted. To the extent 
the arrangements are required by State 
law, we believe they do not reflect 
attempts by entities to establish a 
nominal hospital and, in turn, seek 
inappropriate exclusions. We also 
believe it may be unnecessary to prevent 
hospitals that were created before the 
HwH requirements, and that because of 
State statutory requirements cannot 
meet the subsequently issued separate 
governing body requirements, from 
being excluded from the IPPS. 
Accordingly, we are proposing to add a 
provision to the regulations that would 
apply only to State hospitals that were 
in existence when the HwH regulations 
were established. This proposed 
provision would not apply to other State 
hospitals that chose to open as a HwH 
subsequent to the establishment of the 
HwH regulations in FY 1994, under an 
organizational structure the same as or 
similar to the one described in this 
section. These hospitals knew, in 
advance of becoming a HwH, the 
requirements that had to be met in order 
to be an IPPS-excluded HwH, unlike

23683 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
those hospitals that existed before the 
HwH regulations were established. 
Accordingly, we are proposing to add 
a new paragraph (e)(1)(vi) to § 412.22 to 
provide that if a hospital cannot meet 
the criteria in § 412.22(e)(1)(i) solely 
because it is a State hospital occupying 
space with another State hospital, the 
HwH can nevertheless qualify for an 
exclusion from the IPPS if that hospital 
meets the other applicable criteria in 
§ 412.22(e) and— 
• Both State hospitals share the same 
building or same campus and have been 
continuously owned and operated by 
the State since October 1, 1995; 
• Is required by State law to be 
subject to the governing authority of the 
State hospital with which it shares 
space or the governing authority of a 
third entity that controls both hospitals; 
and 
• Was excluded from the inpatient 
prospective payment system before 
October 1, 1995, and continues to be 
excluded from the IPPS through 
September 30, 2008. 
We believe the proposed criteria 
capture the segment of grandfathered, 
State-operated HwHs that are unable to 
increase their bed size because of State 
law regarding governance. We 
emphasize that we intend to allow an 
exception to the criteria in § 412.22 
(e)(1)(i) only if the hospital that meets 
the proposed criteria above cannot meet 
the separate governing body 
requirement because of State law. We do 
not intend to provide similar treatment 
for hospitals that are not subject to State 
statutory requirements regarding 
governance but have chosen not to 
organize in a manner that would allow 
them to be an IPPS-excluded hospital 
that meets the HwH criteria at 
§ 412.22(e)(1)(i). 
VII. Disclosure Required of Certain 
Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals 
Regarding Physician Ownership 
(§ 489.2(u) and (v)) 
Section 1866 of the Act states that any 
provider of services (except a fund 
designated for purposes of sections 
1814(g) and 1835(e) of the Act) shall be 
qualified to participate in the Medicare 
program and shall be eligible for 
Medicare payments if it files with the 
Secretary a Medicare provider 
agreement and abides by the 
requirements applicable to Medicare 
provider agreements. These 
requirements are incorporated into our 
regulations in 42 CFR Part 489, Subparts 
A and B. Section 1861(e) of the Act 
defines the term ‘‘hospital.’’ Section 
1861(e)(9) of the Act authorizes the 
Secretary to establish requirements for 
hospitals as he finds necessary in the 
interest of patient health and safety. 
Section 1820(e)(3) of the Act authorizes 
the Secretary to establish criteria 
necessary for an institution to be 
certified as a ‘‘critical access hospital.’’ 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we revised our 
regulations governing Medicare 
provider agreements, specifically 
§ 489.20(u), to require a hospital to 
disclose to all patients whether it is 
physician-owned and, if so, the names 
of its physician owners (72 FR 47385 
through 47387). In addition, we added 
a definition of physician-owned 
hospital at § 489.3. The disclosure 
requirement in current § 489.20(u) is 
applicable only to those hospitals with 
physician ownership. (For purposes of 
this proposal, the term ‘‘hospital’’ also 
includes ‘‘critical access hospital’’ 
(CAH).) We neglected to include those 
hospitals in which no physician held an 
ownership or investment interest, but in 
which an immediate family member of 
a physician held an ownership or 
investment interest. However, it was 
always our intent to have consistency 
between the disclosure requirements 
and the physician self-referral statute 
and regulations. The physician self- 
referral statute and regulations, which 
recognize the potential for program and 
patient abuse where a financial 
relationship exists, are applicable to 
both a physician and the immediate 
family member of the physician. We 
believe that it is necessary to revise our 
definition of physician-owned hospital 
because a physician’s potential conflict 
of interest occurs not only in those 
instances where he or she has a 
financial relationship in the form of an 
ownership or investment interest, but 
also where his or her immediate family 
member has a similar interest, and 
patients should be informed of this as 
part of making an informed decision 
concerning treatment. Therefore, we are 
proposing to revise the language in 
§ 489.3 to define a ‘‘physician-owned 
hospital’’ as a participating hospital in 
which a physician, or an immediate 
family member of a physician (as 
defined at § 411.351), has an ownership 
or investment interest in the hospital. 
To effectuate the changes made in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period, we relied on our authority in 
sections 1861(e)(9), 1820(e)(3) and 1866 
of the Act, and on our general 
rulemaking authority in sections 1871 
and 1102 of the Act. Following 
publication of the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period, we became 
aware that some physician-owned 
hospitals have no physician owners 
who refer patients to the hospital (for 
example, in the case of a hospital whose 
physician-owners have retired from the 
practice of medicine). We believe that 
requiring a hospital with no referring 
physician owners to disclose to all 
patients that it is physician-owned and 
to provide the patients with a list of the 
(nonreferring) physician owners would 
be an unnecessary burden on the 
hospital and of no value in assisting a 
patient in making an informed decision 
as to where to seek treatment. Similarly, 
we do not believe that it is useful to 
require a hospital to make such 
disclosures when no referring physician 
has an immediate family member who 
has an ownership or investment interest 
in the hospital. Accordingly, we are 
proposing to include in § 489.20(v) new 
language to provide for an exception to 
the disclosure requirements for a 
physician-owned hospital (as defined at 
§ 489.3) that does not have any 
physician owners who refer patients to 
the hospital (and that has no referring 
physicians (as defined at § 411.351) who 
have an immediate family member with 
an ownership or investment interest in 
the hospital), provided that the hospital 
attests, in writing, to that effect and 
maintains such attestation in its files for 
review by State and Federal surveyors 
or other government officials. (We note 
that, as explained below, we are 
proposing to redesignate the existing 
paragraphs (v) and (w) of § 489.20 as 
paragraphs (w) and (x), respectively.) 
We are proposing to revise § 489.20(u) 
to specify that a hospital must furnish 
to patients the list of owners and 
investors who are physicians (or 
immediate family members of 
physicians) at the time the list is 
requested by or on behalf of the patient. 
In response to the FY 2008 IPPS 
proposed rule, we received public 
comments that noted that our proposal 
did not establish a timeframe within 
which the hospital must furnish to 
patients the required list of the 
hospital’s physician owners or 
investors. These commenters suggested 
that we require that the list be provided 
to the patient at the time the request for 
the list is made by or on behalf of the 
patient. We stated in the preamble of the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period that we would not revise the 
provision to include any specific 
timeframe for making the list available 
because we believed that it was 
important to allow hospitals some 
degree of flexibility regarding the 
manner and form in which it notified 
patients of the identity of its physician 
owners and investors (72 FR 47386). 
However, we also stated later in the

23684 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
hospital should furnish a list of 
physician owners to a patient at the 
beginning of his or her hospital stay or 
outpatient visit, but the regulation text 
did not reflect this change (72 FR 
47387). 
We have reconsidered the issue and 
are proposing in § 489.20(u)(1) that the 
list of the hospital’s owners or investors 
who are physicians or immediate family 
members of physicians (as defined at 
§ 411.351) must be furnished at the time 
the patient or someone on the patient’s 
behalf requests it. We are proposing this 
change for two reasons. First, in the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period, in response to public comments 
received on the FY 2008 IPPS proposed 
rule, we stated that we believed that the 
physician ownership disclosure 
proposal would permit an individual to 
make more informed decisions 
regarding his or her treatment and to 
evaluate whether the existence of a 
financial relationship, in the form of an 
ownership interest, suggests a conflict of 
interest that is not in his or her best 
interest. However, we maintain that the 
provision of a generic notice that the 
hospital is owned by physicians or 
immediate family members of 
physicians is insufficient to permit an 
individual to make a truly informed 
decision. We believe that it is critical 
that the patient receives the list of 
names of the relevant owners or 
investors at the time the request is made 
by or on behalf of the patient so that the 
patient may make a determination as to 
whether his or her admitting or referring 
physician has a potential conflict of 
interest. Second, furnishing the list at 
the time the request is made by the 
patient or on behalf of the patient is 
crucial to affording the patient an 
opportunity to make an informed 
decision before treatment is furnished at 
the hospital. We are not specifying a 
form to be used for the list; rather, we 
are addressing the timeframe for the 
hospital to furnish the list to the patient. 
In addition, we are proposing to add 
new § 489.20(u)(2) to require a hospital 
to require all physicians who are 
members of the hospital’s medical staff 
to agree, as a condition of continued 
medical staff membership or admitting 
privileges, to disclose in writing to all 
patients who they refer to the hospital 
any ownership or investment interest in 
the hospital held by themselves or by an 
immediate family member. We would 
require that physicians agree to make 
such disclosures at the time they refer 
patients to the hospital. We proposed a 
similar requirement in the FY 2008 IPPS 
proposed rule, but decided not to adopt 
it as final. In response to a public 
comment, we stated that we would not 
finalize the proposal because we 
believed that it would not provide any 
additional protections for patients that 
would not already be offered by the 
requirement for hospitals to disclose 
their physician ownership to patients. 
We have revisited this issue. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we stated that the 
scheduling of most hospital inpatient or 
outpatient services is performed by a 
staff member in the physician’s office, 
often weeks, or even months, in advance 
of the furnishing of the service. As 
discussed previously, we believe that 
early notification of physician 
ownership or investment in the hospital 
is beneficial to the patient’s 
decisionmaking concerning his or her 
treatment. Currently, under § 489.20(u), 
scheduling of inpatient stays and 
outpatient visits at physician-owned 
hospitals would be permitted without 
notification to the patient of the 
referring physician’s ownership or 
investment interest in the hospital. If a 
patient were notified of the physician 
ownership or investment at the time of 
the referral, he or she would have an 
opportunity to discuss the physician’s 
ownership or investment in the hospital 
and make a more informed decision. We 
believe that it would be in the best 
interests of the patient and the 
physician owner or investor to disclose 
the physician’s (or his or her immediate 
family member’s) ownership in the 
hospital at the time the physician is 
referring the patient to the hospital. We 
are revising § 489.20(u) accordingly. 
We note that notification of physician 
ownership or investment in a hospital 
may not be viewed negatively by all 
interested parties. For instance, some 
physician owners or investors in 
hospitals believe that disclosing their 
ownership or investment interests in the 
hospital to their patients at the time of 
the referral is extremely beneficial for 
both the physician and the patient. They 
communicate to patients their belief that 
their ownership in the hospital permits 
them to have total control over 
scheduling, staffing, and quality 
mechanisms. Section 5006 of the 
Medicare, Prescription Drug, 
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 
2003 (MMA) required, among other 
things, that HHS study the quality of 
care and patient satisfaction with 
specialty hospitals. HHS concluded that 
specialty hospital patients have very 
favorable perceptions of the clinical 
quality of care they receive, and that 
overall patient satisfaction is very high. 
We are also proposing to revise 
§ 489.53 to permit CMS to terminate the 
Medicare provider agreement if the 
hospital fails to comply with the 
provisions of proposed § 489.20(u)(1) or 
(u)(2). We believe that these revisions 
would be necessary to enforce the 
proposed disclosure requirements set 
forth in § 489.20. 
We are not inclined to make a 
corresponding change to the medical 
staff bylaws condition of participation 
(CoP) in § 482.22(c). We believe that the 
proposed disclosure requirement is 
appropriate for inclusion in the 
regulations governing Medicare 
provider agreements for the following 
reasons. As stated in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period, each 
participating provider must comply 
with all applicable provisions of the 
provider agreement regulations found in 
42 CFR Part 489, and CMS may 
terminate a provider agreement if the 
provider is not in substantial 
compliance with these requirements (72 
FR 47391). A provider’s compliance 
with applicable provider agreement 
regulations is reviewed through a 
variety of means, including onsite 
investigation of complaints. Thus, 
compliance with this proposed 
requirement could be easily monitored. 
We also note that any revisions to the 
medical staff bylaws concerning the 
requirement that the disclosure be given 
at the time of the referral would be 
difficult to enforce as a CoP because the 
required notification generally would be 
given outside of the hospital’s or CAH’s 
premises. However, we are considering 
whether these proposed changes would 
be better effectuated through changes to 
our regulations governing the CoPs 
applicable to hospitals and CAHs, 
which appear at 42 CFR Part 482 and 42 
CFR Part 485, Subpart F, respectively, 
and, therefore, we are soliciting public 
comments on this issue. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, we added a new 
provision at § 489.20(v) to require that 
hospitals and CAHs: (1) Furnish all 
patients written notice at the beginning 
of their inpatient hospital stay or 
outpatient service if a doctor of 
medicine or a doctor of osteopathy is 
not present in the hospital 24 hours per 
day, 7 days per week; and (2) describe 
how the hospital or CAH will meet the 
medical needs of any patient who 
develops an emergency medical 
condition at a time when no physician 
is present in the hospital (72 FR 47387). 
(We are proposing to redesignate 
existing § 489.20(v) and (w) as 
§ 489.20(w) and (x), respectively, to 
accommodate the addition of the 
proposed exception to the requirements 
in § 489.20(v) discussed above.) We 
stated that it is important to ensure that 
consumers are provided accurate 
information on the availability of

physician services at the point when 
they are about to become patients of a 
hospital or CAH. In order to be fully 
informed, consumers should be made 
aware of whether a hospital or CAH has 
a physician on-site 24 hours per day, 7 
days per week, and should be made 
aware of the hospital’s or CAH’s 
processes for addressing medical 
emergencies that may occur when a 
physician is not on site. Given the 
patient safety measures addressed by 
these provisions, we are proposing to set 
forth penalties for failure to comply 
with these requirements. Specifically, 
we are proposing to revise § 489.53 to 
permit CMS to terminate the provider 
agreement of any hospital or CAH that 
fails to comply with the requirements 
set forth in proposed redesignated 
§ 489.20(w). 
We are also soliciting public 
comments on whether hospitals and 
CAHs should educate patients about the 
availability of information regarding 
physician ownership under the 
proposed disclosure requirements and, 
if so, by what means (for example, by a 
posting in the admissions office or in a 
patient brochure). 
VIII. Physician Self-Referral Provisions 
(§§ 411.351, 411.352 and 411.354) 
A. Stand in the Shoes Provisions 
1. Physician ‘‘Stand in the Shoes’’ 
Provisions 
a. Background 
Section 1877 of the Act, also known 
as the physician self-referral law: (1) 
Prohibits a physician from making 
referrals for certain designated health 
services (‘‘DHS’’) payable by Medicare 
to an entity with which he or she (or an 
immediate family member) has a 
financial relationship (ownership, 
investment or compensation), unless an 
exception applies; and (2) prohibits the 
entity from filing claims with Medicare 
(or billing another individual, entity, or 
third party payor) for those referred 
services. The statute establishes a 
number of specific exceptions and 
grants the Secretary the authority to 
create regulatory exceptions for 
financial relationships that pose no risk 
of program or patient abuse. 
Determining whether DHS entities and 
referring physicians (or their immediate 
family members) have direct or indirect 
financial relationships is a key step in 
applying the statute. 
In the final rule entitled ‘‘Medicare 
Program; Physicians’ Referrals to Health 
Care Entities With Which They Have 
Financial Relationships (Phase III),’’ 
published in the Federal Register on 
September 5, 2007 (72 FR 51012) 
(‘‘Phase III’’), we interpreted certain 
provisions of section 1877 of the Act, 
including provisions relating to direct 
and indirect compensation 
arrangements. Specifically, the Phase III 
final rule included provisions under 
which referring physicians are treated as 
standing in the shoes of their physician 
organizations for purposes of applying 
the rules that describe direct and 
indirect compensation arrangements in 
§ 411.354 (72 FR 51026 through 51030). 
A ‘‘physician organization’’ is defined at 
§ 411.351 as ‘‘a physician (including a 
professional corporation of which the 
physician is the sole owner), a 
physician practice, or a group practice 
that complies with the requirements of 
§ 411.352.’’ Therefore, when 
determining whether a direct or indirect 
compensation arrangement exists 
between a physician and an entity to 
which the physician refers Medicare 
patients for DHS, the referring physician 
stands in the shoes of: (1) Another 
physician who employs the referring 
physician; (2) his or her wholly-owned 
professional corporation (‘‘PC’’); (3) a 
physician practice (that is, a medical 
practice) that employs or contracts with 
the referring physician or in which the 
physician has an ownership interest; or 
(4) a group practice of which the 
referring physician is a member or 
independent contractor. The referring 
physician is considered to have the 
same compensation arrangements (with 
the same parties and on the same terms) 
as the physician organization in whose 
shoes the referring physician stands. 
Subsequent to the publication of 
Phase III, industry stakeholders, 
including academic medical centers 
(‘‘AMCs’’), integrated tax-exempt health 
care delivery systems, and their 
representatives, expressed concern 
about the application of the Phase III 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions to 
compensation arrangements involving 
‘‘mission support payments’’ and 
‘‘similar payments’’ (referred to in this 
proposed rule generally as ‘‘support 
payments’’). The stakeholders believed 
that certain payments did not 
previously trigger application of the 
physician self-referral law but, after 
Phase III, need to satisfy the 
requirements of an exception. One 
example offered was a DHS entity 
component (such as a hospital) of an 
AMC that transfers funds to the faculty 
practice plan component of the AMC. If 
a referring physician stands in the shoes 
of his or her faculty practice plan, the 
compensation arrangement between the 
hospital providing the support payment 
and the faculty practice plan will be 
considered to be a direct compensation 
arrangement between the hospital and 
the physician and would need to satisfy 
the requirements of a direct 
compensation arrangement exception, if 
the physician is to continue referring 
Medicare patients to the component for 
DHS. According to the industry 
stakeholders, before Phase III, such 
arrangements would have been analyzed 
under the rules regarding indirect 
compensation arrangements and would, 
in their view, have been permitted. 
After Phase III, in their view, it is 
unlikely that the requirements of an 
available exception could be satisfied 
given the nature of support payments; 
that is, support payments usually are 
not tied to specific items or services 
provided by the faculty practice plan (or 
group practice within an integrated 
health care delivery system), but rather 
are intended to support the overall 
mission of the AMC or maintain 
operations in an integrated health care 
delivery system. For this reason, 
support payments likely do not satisfy 
the requirement, present in many 
exceptions, that the compensation be 
fair market value for items or services 
provided. Similarly, some stakeholders 
raised concerns about support payments 
made from faculty practice plans to 
AMC components. Although AMCs are 
free to use the exception for services 
provided by an AMC in § 411.355(e) 
(which would protect support payments 
made among AMC components if all of 
the conditions of the exception are met), 
industry stakeholders explained that 
many AMCs do not do so, preferring 
instead to rely on other available 
exceptions and the rules regarding 
indirect compensation arrangements 
(especially prior to Phase III). 
To provide CMS sufficient time to 
study the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions as they relate to 
compensation arrangements involving 
support payments, seek additional 
public comment, and develop an 
approach for addressing this issue, on 
November 15, 2007, we issued a final 
rule entitled ‘‘Medicare Program; Delay 
of the Date of Applicability for Certain 
Provisions of Physicians’ Referrals to 
Health Care Entities With Which They 
Have Financial Relationships (Phase 
III)’’ (72 FR 64164) that delayed the 
effective date of the provisions in 
§ 411.354(c)(1)(ii), § 411.354(c)(2)(iv), 
and § 411.354(c)(3) for 12 months after 
the effective date of Phase III (that is, 
until December 4, 2008). That final rule 
was applicable to the following 
compensation arrangements between 
the following physician organizations 
and entities ONLY: 
• With respect to an AMC as 
described in § 411.355(e)(2),

compensation arrangements between a 
faculty practice plan and another 
component of the same AMC; and 
• With respect to an integrated 
section 501(c)(3) health care system, 
compensation arrangements between an 
affiliated DHS entity and an affiliated 
physician practice in the same 
integrated section 501(c)(3) health care 
system. 
Following the publication of the 
November 15, 2007 final rule, other 
industry stakeholders asserted that, in 
addition to section 501(c)(3) health care 
systems, most integrated health care 
delivery systems, including ones 
involving for-profit entities, make 
support payments. The stakeholders 
further asserted that, although under the 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions such 
payments must now satisfy a direct 
compensation arrangement exception, 
there is, in fact, no applicable exception. 
These stakeholders urged that any 
approach to addressing the impact of 
the Phase III ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions on support payments and 
other monetary transfers within 
integrated health care delivery systems 
should have universal applicability that 
is not dependent on whether the system 
meets the definition of an AMC or has 
a particular status under the rules of the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
b. Proposals 
Given the potential widespread 
impact of the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions, as well as the considerable 
industry interest in their application, we 
are revisiting the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
policy and regulations issued in Phase 
III. We believe that a more refined 
approach to the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions would accomplish our goals 
of simplifying the analysis of many 
financial arrangements and reducing 
program abuse by bringing more 
financial relationships within the scope 
of the physician self-referral law (such 
as certain potentially abusive 
arrangements between DHS entities and 
physician organizations that may not 
have met the definition of an ‘‘indirect 
compensation arrangement’’). We note 
that we are not suggesting that support 
payments and other similar 
compensation arrangements are without 
risk of program or patient abuse, nor are 
we endorsing such payments and 
arrangements. 
We are proposing here two alternative 
ways to address the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
issues described above, and are seeking 
industry input on each proposal, as well 
as on other possible approaches. The 
first is a multi-faceted approach to 
revising the Phase III ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions. The second proposal 
would leave the Phase III ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions as promulgated and 
would, instead, create a new exception 
using our authority under section 
1877(b)(4) of the Act for nonabusive 
arrangements that warrant protection 
not available under existing exceptions. 
We are also interested in public 
comments on other approaches and on 
whether changes to the existing ‘‘stand 
in the shoes’’ provisions are needed at 
all. 
For the first proposal, we propose 
revising § 411.354(c)(2)(iv) to provide 
that a physician would be deemed not 
to stand in the shoes of his or physician 
organization if the compensation 
arrangement between the physician 
organization and the physician satisfies 
the requirements of the exception in 
§ 411.357(c) (for bona fide employment 
relationships), the exception in 
§ 411.357(d) (for personal service 
arrangements), or the exception in 
§ 411.357(l) (for fair market value 
compensation). Currently, all physicians 
stand in the shoes of their physician 
organizations, regardless of the nature of 
the compensation they receive from the 
physician organization. Under our 
proposal, the first step in the analysis 
would be to look at the compensation a 
referring physician receives from his or 
her physician organization. A 
compensation arrangement between a 
physician organization and a physician 
that satisfies the requirements of 
§ 411.357(c), (d), or (l) would be 
consistent with fair market value by 
design and not determined in a manner 
that takes into account (directly or 
indirectly) the volume or value of any 
referrals by the physician to the 
physician organization. Although such 
compensation could, in some 
circumstances, be determined in a 
manner that takes into account (directly 
or indirectly) the volume or value of the 
physician’s referrals to the DHS entity 
(see 66 FR 869), we believe that the risk 
of program or patient abuse will be 
addressed sufficiently by analyzing such 
arrangements between DHS entities and 
referring physicians who do not stand in 
the shoes of their physician 
organizations using the rules regarding 
indirect compensation arrangements. 
Therefore, under this proposal, if the 
compensation arrangement between a 
physician organization and one of its 
referring physicians satisfies the 
requirements of one of the exceptions 
noted above, the referring physician 
would be deemed not to stand in the 
shoes of the physician organization for 
purposes of applying the definitions of, 
and provisions related to, direct and 
indirect compensation arrangements in 
§ 411.354(c). Arrangements between 
DHS entities and physician 
organizations whose physicians do not 
stand in their shoes may still create 
indirect compensation arrangements 
that would need to satisfy the 
requirements of the exception for 
indirect compensation arrangements in 
§ 411.357(p). 
Under this first proposed approach, 
physician owners and investors would 
continue to stand in the shoes of their 
physician organizations. However, we 
are concerned that considering all 
physician owners of, or physician 
investors in, a physician organization to 
stand in the shoes of the physician 
organization, as they currently do under 
the Phase III ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions, might be over-inclusive. For 
example, in a State that prohibits the 
corporate practice of medicine, a 
physician owner of a captive or 
‘‘friendly’’ PC who has no right to the 
distribution of profits would stand in 
the shoes of his or her physician 
organization, even though his or her 
employment arrangement with the 
group satisfies the requirements of the 
exception for bona fide employment 
relationships in § 411.357(c). We are 
considering whether these and similarly 
situated physician owners should have 
to stand in the shoes of their physician 
organizations when their ownership 
interest is nominal in nature and their 
compensation arrangement with the 
physician organization satisfies the 
requirements of one of the exceptions in 
§ 411.357(c), (d), or (l). We are soliciting 
public comments on this issue. 
As described above, a physician- 
employee or contractor whose 
compensation arrangement with a 
physician organization does not satisfy 
the requirements of § 411.357(c), (d), or 
(l) would stand in the shoes of the 
physician organization. This is 
necessary to address our concern that an 
arrangement between a DHS entity and 
a physician organization that 
compensates its physicians in a manner 
that does not satisfy the requirements of 
an exception may be particularly prone 
to abuse. For example, where a 
physician-employee’s compensation 
arrangement with his or her group 
practice exceeds fair market value for 
services provided to the group practice 
employer (and, thus, does not satisfy the 
requirements of the exception in 
§ 411.357(c)), and the physician- 
employee’s DHS referrals to the group 
practice instead are protected under the 
exception for in-office ancillary services 
in § 411.355(b), there is risk that the 
physician-employee’s above-fair-market- 
value compensation may reflect the 
volume or value of referrals to the DHS

entity. This could be the result of a 
support or other payment between the 
DHS entity and the group practice that 
is designed to channel compensation to 
the physician-employee for referrals to 
the DHS entity. 
We are also considering, and solicit 
comments on, an approach under which 
only owners of a physician organization 
would stand in the shoes of that 
physician organization (in which case, a 
physician would not stand in the shoes 
of a physician organization unless he or 
she holds an ownership or investment 
interest, even if the physician’s 
compensation arrangement with that 
physician organization does not satisfy 
the requirements of § 411.357(c), (d), or 
(l)). In conjunction with this approach, 
we are interested in receiving comments 
on whether and under what 
circumstances the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions should apply to a physician 
organization that has no physician 
owners. 
In this first approach, we also propose 
to revise § 411.354(c)(3)(ii) to provide 
that the provisions of §§ 411.354(c)(1)(ii) 
and (c)(2)(iv) do not apply when the 
requirements of § 411.355(e) are 
satisfied. In other words, a physician 
would not stand in the shoes of his or 
her physician organization (for example, 
a faculty practice plan) when his or her 
referral for DHS is protected under the 
exception in § 411.355(e) for services 
provided by an AMC. We note that, if 
all of the requirements of the exception 
in § 411.355(e) are not satisfied, a 
physician would stand in the shoes of 
his or her physician organization unless, 
as discussed above with respect to 
proposed revised § 411.354(c)(2)(iv), the 
compensation from the physician 
organization to the physician satisfies 
the requirements of the exception for 
bona fide employment relationships, the 
exception for personal service 
arrangements, or the exception for fair 
market value compensation in 
§ 411.357(c), (d), and (l), respectively. 
We are proposing to include a specific 
revision to the regulation in 
§ 411.354(c)(2)(iv); however, we are 
seeking public comment as to whether 
this policy is better achieved by revising 
§ 411.354(c)(3) to delete the reference to 
applying the exceptions in § 411.355, 
and thereby providing that the ‘‘stand in 
the shoes’’ provisions do not apply 
where the prohibition on referrals is not 
applicable because all of the 
requirements of any of the exceptions in 
§ 411.355 are satisfied. 
In this first approach, we also propose 
to revise § 411.354(c)(3)(ii) to provide 
that the provisions of § 411.354(c)(1)(ii) 
and (c)(2)(iv) do not apply when 
compensation is provided by a 
component of an AMC to a physician 
organization affiliated with that AMC 
through a written contract to provide 
services required to satisfy the AMC’s 
obligations under the Medicare graduate 
medical education (GME) rules where 
the contract is limited to only services 
necessary to fulfill the GME obligations 
as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 413, Subpart 
F. We have in mind certain 
arrangements between a hospital 
component of an AMC and a 
community physician group to serve as 
a teaching site for the AMC’s residents, 
as required by the GME rules. If 
adopted, this proposal would not mean 
that such arrangements necessarily are 
lawful, but rather that they would be 
analyzed by applying the rules 
regarding indirect compensation 
arrangements. 
Under this first proposal, if adopted, 
some referring physicians would no 
longer stand in the shoes of their 
physician organizations as they 
currently do under the Phase III ‘‘stand 
in the shoes’’ provisions. In such 
circumstances, the rules regarding direct 
and indirect compensation 
arrangements would still apply, and 
financial relationships would still need 
to be analyzed for compliance with the 
statute and regulations. We are 
concerned that, where physicians do not 
stand in the shoes of their physician 
organizations, some potentially abusive 
arrangements between DHS entities and 
physician organizations might be 
viewed incorrectly as falling outside the 
definition of an ‘‘indirect compensation 
arrangement’’ at § 411.354(c)(2) and, 
therefore, as not within the scope of the 
physician self-referral law. The 
definition of ‘‘indirect compensation 
arrangement’’ generally requires that 
three elements be present: (1) An 
unbroken chain of financial 
relationships between the DHS entity 
and the referring physician; (2) 
aggregate compensation to the referring 
physician (from the entity in the chain 
closest to the physician) that varies with 
or takes into account in any manner the 
volume or value of referrals to, or other 
business generated for, the DHS entity; 
and (3) knowledge by the DHS entity 
that the referring physician receives 
such compensation. (We refer readers to 
66 FR 864 through 870, 69 FR 16057 
through 16063, and 72 FR 51026 
through 51031 for further explanation.) 
We believe that some parties may be 
construing these elements (particularly 
the second and the third) too narrowly. 
For example, we believe that aggregate 
compensation can vary with or take into 
account the volume or value of referrals 
to, or business generated for, DHS 
entities in a wide range of 
circumstances, including, without 
limitation, arrangements involving: 
variable, per-click, or percentage-based 
compensation; exclusive contracts; 
inflated fixed payments; or explicit or 
implicit tying of compensation to other 
referrals. To address this issue, we may 
provide additional guidance on the 
application of the three elements of the 
definition of ‘‘indirect compensation 
arrangement’’ in the FY 2009 IPPS final 
rule. We are interested in public 
comments regarding ways in which we 
can ensure that the full range of 
potentially abusive arrangements 
between DHS entities and physician 
organizations are appropriately 
addressed in situations where 
physicians do not stand in the shoes of 
their physician organizations. 
As discussed above, we are proposing 
an alternative approach to addressing 
the Phase III ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions. (However, we are proposing 
regulation text for the first proposal 
only.) Our alternative proposal is to 
make no revisions to the Phase III 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions in 
§§ 411.354(c)(1)(ii), (c)(2)(iv), and, (c)(3) 
and, to the extent necessary to protect 
nonabusive arrangements, promulgate a 
separate exception using our authority 
under section 1877(b)(4) of the Act to 
create exceptions for arrangements that 
do not pose a risk of program or patient 
abuse. The new exception would apply 
to specific types of nonabusive 
payments or arrangements that are not 
otherwise covered by existing 
exceptions (for example, certain support 
payments, as described above), subject 
to conditions necessary to protect 
against program and patient abuse, 
similar to those conditions incorporated 
into the existing exception for services 
provided by an AMC in § 411.355(e). 
Specifically, we are considering 
establishing a new exception, using our 
authority under section 1877(b)(4) of the 
Act, for compensation arrangements 
between DHS entities and physician 
organizations and physicians for 
‘‘mission support’’ payments (or similar 
compensation arrangements) and, if so, 
how we should define those payments 
(or similar compensation arrangements), 
and what criteria such an exception 
should include to protect against 
program or patient abuse. We are 
soliciting comments about this proposal, 
including whether an exception should 
be limited to ‘‘mission support’’ 
payments, whether other specific types 
of payments or compensation 
arrangements should be eligible for such 
an exception, the types of parties that 
should be permitted to use the

exception (for example, AMC 
components, physician practices), and 
the conditions that should apply to such 
an exception to ensure that a protected 
compensation arrangement poses no 
risk of program or patient abuse. We are 
concerned that some ‘‘mission support’’ 
payments or similar payments are 
subject to fraud and abuse. We are 
interested in public comments that 
identify with specificity the types of 
compensation agreements that should 
be permitted under an applicable 
exception. 
Under this approach, the proposed 
exception might address compensation 
arrangements between components of 
certain well-defined integrated delivery 
systems, perhaps with tightly-crafted 
conditions similar to those in the 
existing exception for services provided 
by an AMC in § 411.355(e). For 
example, some industry stakeholders 
have recommended that we establish an 
exception for compensation 
arrangements between a DHS entity 
component of an integrated health care 
delivery system and a physician 
organization component of the same 
integrated health care delivery system. 
We are concerned that the term 
‘‘integrated health care delivery system’’ 
is loosely used in the industry to 
describe a wide variety of systems, with 
varying degrees of actual integration, 
and that it may prove infeasible to craft 
a sufficiently circumscribed definition. 
In many circumstances, payment 
arrangements between components of 
‘‘integrated health care delivery 
systems,’’ as well as payments from 
‘‘integrated health care delivery 
systems’’ to physicians affiliated with 
those systems are susceptible to fraud 
and abuse. However, we are soliciting 
public comments defining a fully 
integrated health care delivery system, 
what types of compensation 
arrangements should be protected (for 
example, support payments), and what 
conditions should be included in an 
exception that would ensure no risk of 
program or patient abuse. We note that 
any exception established using our 
authority under section 1877(b)(4) of the 
Act would include documentation 
requirements and a requirement that the 
arrangement not violate the anti- 
kickback statute or any Federal or State 
law or regulation governing billing or 
claims submission, consistent with the 
existing exceptions created under this 
authority. 
According to some industry 
stakeholders, an ‘‘integrated health care 
delivery system’’ could be defined, for 
example, as a health care delivery 
system comprised of two or more 
entities that are related and 
substantially integrated by common 
ownership or control, and which 
includes at least one hospital and one 
physician organization that has no 
physician owners or investors who 
make referrals for DHS to any 
component of the health care delivery 
system. Entities that file consolidated 
financial statements could be deemed to 
be substantially integrated for purposes 
of this definition. For purposes of this 
approach, ownership could exist if an 
individual or individuals possess 50 
percent ownership or equity in the 
component of the integrated health care 
delivery system, and control would 
exist if an individual or an organization 
has the power, directly or indirectly, 
significantly to influence or direct the 
actions or policies of the component of 
the integrated health care delivery 
system. As noted above, it would be 
necessary to define ‘‘integrated health 
care delivery system,’’ as well as 
‘‘ownership’’ and ‘‘control,’’ and to 
determine whether to permit integrated 
health care delivery systems to include 
entities related through written 
contractual affiliation agreements and, if 
so, what limitations (if any) should be 
placed on the types of contractually 
affiliated entities we would permit to be 
included as components of an integrated 
health care delivery system. We would 
need also to determine what 
characteristics indicate substantial 
integration and identify the types of 
compensation arrangements that exist 
between components of integrated 
health care delivery systems. We are 
seeking public comments regarding this 
possible approach (including the 
specific issues noted), as well as public 
comments on other alternative 
approaches to addressing the concerns 
regarding support payments and similar 
monetary transfers noted by industry 
stakeholders and described above. 
2. DHS Entity ‘‘Stand in the Shoes’’ 
Provisions 
On July 12, 2007, we published in the 
Federal Register a proposed rule 
entitled ‘‘Medicare Program; Proposed 
Revisions to Payment Policies Under the 
Physician Fee Schedule, and Other Part 
B Payment Policies for CY 2008; 
Proposed Revisions to the Payment 
Policies of Ambulance Services Under 
the Ambulance Fee Schedule for CY 
2008; and the Proposed Elimination of 
the E-Prescribing Exemption for 
Computer-Generated Facsimile 
Transmissions; Proposed Rule’’ (the 
‘‘CY 2008 PFS proposed rule’’) (72 FR 
38122). In that rule, we proposed a 
corollary provision to the Phase III 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions that 
addressed the DHS entity side of 
physician—DHS entity financial 
relationships. Specifically, we proposed 
to amend § 411.354(c) to provide that, 
where a DHS entity owns or controls an 
entity to which a physician refers 
Medicare patients for DHS, the DHS 
entity would stand in the shoes of the 
entity that it owns or controls and 
would be deemed to have the same 
compensation arrangements with the 
same parties and on the same terms as 
does the entity that it owns or controls. 
For example, a hospital would stand in 
the shoes of a medical foundation that 
it owns or controls (such as where the 
hospital is the sole member of a 
nonprofit corporation). Thus, under the 
CY 2008 PFS proposed rule proposal, if 
a hospital owns or controls a medical 
foundation that contracts with a 
physician to provide physician services 
at a clinic owned by the medical 
foundation, the hospital would stand in 
the shoes of the medical foundation and 
would be deemed to have a direct 
compensation relationship with the 
contractor physician. We solicited 
public comments as to whether and how 
we would employ a ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ approach for these types of 
relationships, as well as for other types 
of financial relationships. 
In response to the CY 2008 PFS 
proposed rule, we received comments 
from a variety of industry stakeholders, 
including physicians, medical 
associations, and their representatives. 
Although several commenters supported 
the proposed entity ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions because they share our 
concerns regarding parties ability to 
avoid application of the physician self- 
referral law by simply inserting an 
entity in the chain of financial 
relationships linking a DHS entity and 
a referring physician, many commenters 
expressed concern that the proposal was 
unclear and potentially overly broad. 
Commenters requested guidance 
regarding the level of ownership or 
control that would trigger the 
application of the entity ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions. One commenter 
recommended that, instead of finalizing 
the entity ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions, we issue, through a notice of 
proposed rulemaking, a more detailed 
proposal that would give industry 
stakeholders the opportunity to provide 
more meaningful comments. 
We did not finalize the DHS entity 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions in the 
CY 2008 PFS final rule published in the 
Federal Register on November 27, 2007 
(72 FR 66222, 66306). Because the DHS 
entity ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions 
are integrally related to the physician 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions that we 
finalized in Phase III and for which we

23689 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
are proposing the regulatory revisions 
described above, we are re-proposing 
here the DHS entity ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions, with some 
modification. We believe that a 
comprehensive approach to the ‘‘stand 
in the shoes’’ provisions that addresses 
both physicians and physician 
organizations, as well as DHS entities 
and other entities that they own or 
control, is the best vehicle to address 
the goals outlined in the Phase III final 
rule, namely: (1) Simplifying the 
analysis of many financial 
arrangements; and (2) reducing program 
abuse by bringing more financial 
relationships within the ambit of the 
physician self-referral law. 
We are proposing to revise 
§ 411.354(a) to provide that an entity 
that furnishes DHS would be deemed to 
stand in the shoes of an organization in 
which it has a 100 percent ownership 
interest and would be deemed to have 
the same compensation arrangements 
with the same parties and on the same 
terms as does the organization that it 
owns. We believe this approach is 
straightforward and can be readily 
applied. We note that, under this 
approach (as compared to our CY 2008 
PFS proposal), a DHS entity would 
stand in the shoes of any wholly-owned 
organization, not merely a wholly- 
owned DHS entity. An organization may 
be in any legal form (for example, a 
limited liability company, partnership, 
or corporation, regardless of status as 
nonprofit or exempt from taxation). We 
are seeking public comments 
specifically as to whether we should 
consider a DHS entity to stand in the 
shoes of another organization in which 
the DHS entity holds less than a 100 
percent ownership interest and, if so, 
what amount of ownership should 
trigger application of the entity ‘‘stand 
in the shoes’’ provisions. In addition, 
we are seeking public comments as to 
whether we should deem a DHS entity 
to stand in the shoes of an organization 
that it controls (for example, an entity 
would stand in the shoes of a nonprofit 
organization of which it is the sole 
member); we would consider a DHS 
entity to control an organization if the 
DHS entity has the power, directly or 
indirectly, significantly to influence or 
direct the actions or policies of the 
organization. We are seeking public 
comments as to what level of control 
should trigger the application of the 
entity ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions. 
3. Application of the Physician ‘‘Stand 
in the Shoes’’ and the Entity ‘‘Stand in 
the Shoes’’ Provisions 
In order to protect against program 
and patient abuse when multiple links 
involving various corporate and other 
entities exist in a chain of financial 
relationships between a DHS entity and 
a referring physician, we are proposing 
that, when applying the physician 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions and the 
entity ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions to 
a chain of financial relationships 
between a physician and a DHS entity, 
the following conventions would apply: 
• First, parties would apply the 
physician ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions and deem the physician to 
stand in the shoes of his or her 
physician organization (in those 
instances where the physician ‘‘stand in 
the shoes’’ provisions apply to the 
particular physician and physician 
organization). 
• However, if applying the physician 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions would 
result in only one financial relationship 
remaining between the DHS entity and 
the ‘‘collapsed’’ physician/physician 
organization and that relationship is an 
ownership interest, the physician 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions would 
not be applied, and the entity ‘‘stand in 
the shoes’’ provisions instead would be 
applied first. 
• If more than two organizations 
remain after first ‘‘collapsing’’ the 
physician and the physician 
organization (that is, if at least two links 
remain in the chain of financial 
relationships between the physician 
who is standing in the shoes of his or 
her physician organization and the DHS 
entity), the next step would be to apply 
the entity ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions. 
These conventions ensure that at least 
one compensation arrangement remains 
between the DHS entity and the 
referring physician for purposes of 
analyzing the chain of relationships 
under the physician-self referral rules. 
For example, if a chain of financial 
relationships runs: hospital—wholly- 
owned home health agency—group 
practice—physician owner of the group 
practice, the first step would be to apply 
the physician ‘‘stand in the shoes 
provisions’’ such that the physician 
owner would stand in the shoes of the 
group practice. The next step would be 
to apply the entity ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions and deem the hospital to 
stand in the shoes of its wholly-owned 
home health agency. Assuming that the 
financial relationship between the home 
health agency and the group practice is 
a compensation arrangement, the 
remaining financial relationship would 
be deemed to be a direct compensation 
arrangement between the hospital 
(standing in the shoes of the home 
health agency) and the physician 
(standing in the shoes of the group 
practice). By contrast, the example of a 
chain of financial relationships that 
runs: hospital—group practice wholly- 
owned by the hospital—employed 
physician of the group practice (whose 
compensation does not satisfy the 
requirements of the exception in 
§ 411.357(c)), is illustrative. If the 
relationship between the hospital and 
the group practice is solely an 
ownership interest (that is, there is no 
separate compensation arrangement 
between them), applying the physician 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions first, so 
that the physician-employee stands in 
the shoes of the group practice, would 
result in one remaining financial link 
between the group practice and the 
hospital, and that relationship would be 
an ownership interest. In those 
circumstances, the entity ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions would be applied first 
and the hospital would stand in the 
shoes of its wholly-owned group 
practice. The physician would not stand 
in the shoes of the group practice. The 
remaining financial relationship would 
be deemed to be a direct compensation 
arrangement between the hospital 
(standing in the shoes of the group 
practice) and the physician. (We note 
that, in this example, the physician’s 
compensation from the group practice 
does not satisfy the requirements of the 
exception for bona fide employment 
relationships in § 411.357(c) and, thus, 
no direct exception would apply to that 
compensation arrangement.) Using the 
same chain of financial relationships, 
but assuming instead that the hospital 
has a compensation arrangement with 
(in addition to being the sole owner of) 
the group practice (for example, an 
office space rental agreement), under the 
proposals described above, the 
physician would stand in the shoes of 
the group practice, but the hospital 
would not stand in the shoes of the 
group practice because, after first 
applying the physician ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions, only two 
organizations would remain (that is, 
only one link in the chain of financial 
relationships remains). The remaining 
financial relationship created by the 
rental agreement would be deemed to be 
a direct compensation arrangement 
between the hospital and the physician, 
which would need to satisfy the 
requirements of an exception. 
We are not proposing regulation text 
at this time with respect to the 
application of the physician and entity 
‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions. At such 
time as these provisions are finalized, 
we would amend the regulation text, as 
appropriate, to codify requirements

related to the application of the 
provisions. 
4. Definitions: ‘‘Physician’’ and 
‘‘Physician Organization’’ 
In an interim final rule with comment 
period entitled ‘‘Medicare Program; 
Physicians’ Referrals to Health Care 
Entities With Which They Have 
Financial Relationships (Phase II); 
Interim Final Rule,’’ published in the 
Federal Register on March 26, 2004 (72 
FR 16054) (‘‘Phase II’’), we revised the 
definition of ‘‘referring physician’’ at 
§ 411.351 to provide that a referring 
physician is deemed to stand in the 
shoes of his or her wholly-owned PC (69 
FR 16060). In that rule, we stated that 
it is not necessary to treat a referring 
physician as separate from his or her 
wholly-owned PC. In the Phase III final 
rule, for purposes of implementing the 
physician ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions, the term ‘‘physician 
organization’’ was newly defined at 
§ 411.351 as ‘‘a physician (including a 
professional corporation of which the 
physician is the sole owner), a 
physician practice, or a group practice 
that complies with the requirements of 
§ 411.352.’’ Our intent was that, when 
applying the physician ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions in § 411.354, a 
physician would stand in the shoes of: 
(1) Another physician who employs the 
physician; (2) his or her wholly-owned 
PC; (3) a physician practice that 
employs or contracts with the physician 
or in which the physician has an 
ownership interest; or (4) a group 
practice of which the physician is a 
member or independent contractor. 
Essentially, we intended this 
definition to incorporate the Phase II 
policy that a physician stands in the 
shoes of, or is considered the same as, 
the PC of which he or she is the sole 
owner. In determining whether a direct 
or indirect compensation arrangement 
exists between a DHS entity and a 
referring physician, we intended that 
parties should first ‘‘collapse’’ the 
physician into his or her wholly-owned 
PC, and then deem that ‘‘collapsed’’ 
physician/PC unit to stand in the shoes 
of the physician organization (if one 
exists). However, we are concerned that 
parties may interpret the rules, using the 
definition of ‘‘physician organization’’ 
exclusive of the definition of ‘‘referring 
physician,’’ as requiring only that they 
deem a physician to stand in the shoes 
of his or her wholly-owned PC without 
further deeming the ‘‘collapsed’’ 
physician/PC unit to stand in the shoes 
of the physician organization. That is, 
with respect to a chain of financial 
relationships that runs: hospital—group 
practice—PC—physician, parties might 
interpret our rules as requiring only that 
the physician stand in the shoes of the 
PC and not in the shoes of the group 
practice, so that the resulting chain of 
financial relationships (after the 
application of the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions) would run: hospital—group 
practice—PC/physician. However, our 
intention was that, after application of 
the ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions, the 
chain of financial relationships would 
run: hospital—group practice/PC/ 
physician. 
Therefore, we are proposing revisions 
to the definitions of ‘‘physician’’ and 
‘‘physician organization’’ to clarify that: 
(1) A physician and the PC of which he 
or she is the sole owner are always 
treated the same for purposes of 
applying the physician self-referral 
rules; and (2) a physician who stands in 
the shoes of his or her wholly-owned PC 
also stands in the shoes of his or her 
physician organization in accordance 
with § 411.354(c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(iv). 
B. Period of Disallowance 
In response to the Phase II interim 
final rule with comment period, several 
commenters questioned what the time 
period would be for which the 
physician could not refer patients for 
DHS to an entity and for which the 
entity could not bill Medicare (the 
‘‘period of disallowance’’) where a 
financial relationship between a 
referring physician and an entity failed 
to satisfy the requirements of an 
exception to the general prohibition on 
self-referral. (See 72 FR 51024 through 
51025; and 72 FR 38183.) In the Phase 
III final rule, in response to these 
inquiries, we stated that the statute 
provides no explicit limitation on the 
billing and claims submission 
prohibition (72 FR 51025). In the CY 
2008 PFS proposed rule, we stated that 
the statute contemplates that the period 
of disallowance begins with the date 
that a financial relationship failed to 
comply with the statute and the 
regulations, and ends with the date that 
the arrangement came into compliance 
or ended (72 FR 38183). We noted that, 
in some cases, it may not be clear when 
a financial relationship has ended. We 
provided the example of an entity 
leasing space to a physician at a rental 
price that is substantially below fair 
market value. We stated that such an 
arrangement may raise the inference 
that the below-market rent was in 
exchange for future referrals, including 
referrals made beyond the expiration of 
the lease. We solicited comments with 
respect to: (1) The types of 
noncompliance for which it is not clear 
when a financial relationship ended; 
and (2) whether we should always 
employ a case-by-case approach or 
deem certain types of financial 
relationships to continue for a 
prescribed period of time. We also 
solicited public comments as to whether 
we should allow a prescribed period of 
disallowance to terminate where the 
parties have returned (or paid back the 
value of) any excess compensation. For 
example, if we were to impose a period 
of disallowance for a prescribed period 
of time because it would not be clear 
when a noncompliant compensation 
arrangement ended, we stated that we 
might allow the parties to terminate the 
period of disallowance sooner than the 
prescribed period if the prohibited 
compensation were returned. In the CY 
2008 PFS proposed rule, we cautioned 
that we did not envision allowing such 
an option where the parties knew or, in 
our judgment, reasonably should have 
known, that the arrangement did not 
satisfy the requirements of an exception. 
Finally, we sought public comments as 
to whether we should impose a period 
of disqualification, prohibiting the 
parties from using an exception where 
an arrangement has failed to satisfy the 
requirements of that exception. We gave 
the example of nonmonetary 
compensation provided by an entity to 
a physician that greatly exceeded the 
permissible limit prescribed in 
§ 411.357(k), and questioned whether, 
in addition to whatever period of 
disallowance would apply, the parties 
should be disqualified, for some period 
of time, from using this exception. 
We received few public comments in 
response to the CY 2008 PFS proposed 
rule solicitation of comments; however, 
with respect to the length of the period 
of disallowance, one commenter 
asserted that the appropriate period of 
disallowance should match the period 
that the financial relationship did not 
satisfy the requirements of an exception, 
but that the period should be limited to 
a maximum term. In addition, 
commenters asserted that, if the parties 
unwind the relationship and return the 
prohibited compensation, the period of 
disallowance should end. Another 
commenter suggested that the period of 
disallowance should end once the 
hospital corrects or terminates the 
arrangement and the physician repays to 
the hospital any compensation in excess 
of what is permitted. Alternatively, 
according to the commenter, if the 
physician does not repay the excess 
compensation, the period of 
disallowance should end once the 
hospital repays to Medicare the excess 
compensation, and the hospital should 
be prohibited from paying any further 
compensation to the physician until the

physician reimburses the hospital for 
the excess compensation. One 
commenter asserted that certain 
circumstances warrant no period of 
disallowance. For instance, according to 
the commenter, if parties to an 
arrangement were unaware that the 
arrangement violates the physician self- 
referral law but later were notified by 
CMS or its contractor of the possible 
violation, they should be able to amend 
the arrangement so that it satisfies the 
requirements of an exception without 
any period of disallowance. The 
commenter also asserted that there 
should be no period of disqualification 
preventing the parties from using an 
exception in light of the onerous 
penalties under the physician self- 
referral law. 
At this time, we are proposing to 
amend § 411.353(c) to provide that, 
where the reason(s) a financial 
relationship does not meet any 
applicable exception is not related to 
compensation (for example, a signature 
is missing or an agreement is not in 
writing as required by the applicable 
exception), the period of disallowance 
would begin on the date the 
arrangement first was out of compliance 
and end no later than the date the 
arrangement was brought into 
compliance (for example, by obtaining a 
missing signature on an agreement or 
executing a written agreement as 
required by the applicable exception). 
For example, where a hospital and a 
physician enter into a personal service 
arrangement for medical director 
services and begin performing under the 
arrangement on January 1, but do not 
execute a written agreement until 
January 31, provided that all of the 
requirements of § 411.357(d) (the 
exception for personal service 
arrangements) are satisfied as of January 
31, the period of disallowance would 
begin on January 1 and end no later than 
January 31. As discussed below, we 
believe that it is possible that a financial 
arrangement may end prior to the 
arrangement being brought into 
compliance. In such circumstances, a 
determination as to the duration of the 
period of disallowance necessarily 
would be made on a case-by-case basis 
considering the facts and circumstances, 
and we are not proposing a prescribed 
period of disallowance for such a 
situation. 
We are also proposing that, where the 
reason a financial relationship does not 
meet any applicable exception is related 
to the payment or receipt of excess 
compensation (for example, the 
compensation paid to a physician is 
greater than fair market value or exceeds 
the limits in § 411.357(k) or (m)), the 
period of disallowance would begin on 
the date the arrangement first was out of 
compliance and end no later than the 
date the excess compensation (including 
interest, as appropriate) was returned by 
the party receiving it to the party that 
provided it and all other requirements 
of the applicable exception are met. For 
example, if a hospital provided 
nonmonetary compensation totaling 
$100 in excess of the limits in 
§ 411.357(k) on February 1 and the 
parties did not discover the 
noncompliance until October 1 (and, 
therefore, could not avail themselves of 
the provisions in § 411.357(k)(3) 
permitting parties to remain in 
compliance with the exception if excess 
nonmonetary compensation (within 
certain limits) provided inadvertently is 
discovered and returned with 180 days 
of its receipt), the period of 
disallowance would begin on February 
1 and end no later than the date that the 
physician returned the excess 
nonmonetary compensation or its value 
($100 plus interest, as appropriate) to 
the hospital. Assuming that the 
physician paid the hospital $100 (plus 
interest, as appropriate) on October 15, 
the period of disallowance would run 
from February 1 through no later than 
October 15. 
Our proposal would also prescribe a 
period of disallowance where the reason 
a financial relationship does not meet 
any applicable exception is related to 
the payment or receipt of compensation 
that is insufficient to satisfy the 
requirements of an exception (for 
example, office space or equipment 
rental payments that are below fair 
market value). We are proposing that the 
period of disallowance would begin on 
the date the arrangement first was out of 
compliance and end no later than the 
date the shortfall was paid to the party 
to which it is owed and all other 
requirements of the applicable 
exception are met. The ‘‘shortfall’’ 
would be that amount (including 
interest, as appropriate) necessary to 
bring the arrangement into compliance 
from the date of its inception. For 
example, assume a hospital and 
physician entered into a 2-year office 
space rental agreement on January 1 (of 
Year 1) which specified rental charges 
(consistent with fair market value) of 
$20 per square foot during Year 1 and 
automatically adjusted upward each 
January 1 by any increase in the CPI–U. 
If, on January 1 of Year 2 of the 
agreement, the rental charges increased 
to $21 per square foot based on the 
amount of increase in the CPI–U, but the 
physician continued to pay $20 per 
square foot until the compliance failure 
was identified on June 30 of Year 2, the 
period of disallowance would run from 
January 1 of Year 2 until no later than 
June 30 of Year 2, provided that the 
physician paid the hospital on June 30 
of Year 2 the shortfall of $1 per square 
foot for the 6-month shortfall period 
(plus interest, as appropriate) and, as of 
July 1 through the term of the 
agreement, the physician paid $21 per 
square foot for the office space, and the 
arrangement otherwise satisfied the 
requirements of the exception in 
§ 411.357(d). As discussed below, we 
believe that it is possible that an 
arrangement may end prior to excess 
compensation being returned or a 
shortfall being paid; however, such a 
determination as to the duration of the 
period of disallowance necessarily 
would be made on a case-by-case basis 
considering the facts and circumstances, 
and we are not proposing a prescribed 
period of disallowance for such a 
situation. 
We also note that an arrangement may 
be noncompliant for reasons that are 
related to compensation, but which do 
not involve the payment or receipt of 
excess compensation or a shortfall in 
compensation paid or received. For 
example, many of our exceptions 
require that the compensation not take 
into account the volume or value of 
referrals or other business generated 
between the parties and that the 
compensation be commercially 
reasonable, even if no referrals were 
made between the parties. It is possible 
that the amount of compensation 
provided under an arrangement is fair 
market value or is consistent with a 
prescribed limit in one of the exceptions 
(such as in § 411.357(k)), but, for 
example, takes into account the volume 
or value of referrals and this results in 
a noncompliant arrangement. We are 
not proposing a prescribed period of 
disallowance for arrangements that are 
noncompliant for reasons that are 
related to compensation but which do 
not involve only the payment or receipt 
of excess compensation or a shortfall in 
compensation paid or received. Rather, 
the appropriate period of disallowance 
for such arrangements would need to be 
determined on a case-by-case basis. 
Essentially, our proposals place an 
outside limit on the period of 
disallowance in certain circumstances. 
That is, where the reason(s) for 
noncompliance does not relate to 
compensation, the latest the period of 
disallowance would end would be the 
date the arrangement was brought into 
compliance. Where the reason for 
noncompliance is the fact that excess 
compensation was provided or too little 
compensation was paid, the latest the

period of disallowance would end 
would be the date that the party 
receiving the excess compensation 
returned it to the party that provided it 
or the party owing the shortfall in 
compensation paid it to the party to 
which it was owed (assuming the 
arrangement otherwise satisfies the 
requirements of an applicable 
exception). 
We recognize, of course, that parties 
to a financial relationship that is 
noncompliant may never bring the 
relationship into compliance with an 
applicable exception. The financial 
relationship may expire according to the 
terms of the underlying agreement (such 
as the date of expiration of a personal 
service contract), or it may end earlier 
or later than the expiration date 
provided in the underlying agreement. 
However, we do not propose to 
prescribe with specificity when such a 
noncompliant financial relationship 
(and, thus, the period of disallowance) 
might end. Likewise, if a party that 
receives excess compensation never 
repays the excess compensation, or a 
party who owes additional 
compensation (the shortfall) never pays 
it, the question arises as to when the 
financial relationship ends. To return to 
the example that we gave in the CY 
2008 PFS proposed rule and that we 
reference above, if an entity leases space 
to a physician at a rental price that is 
substantially below fair market value, 
the inference may be raised that the 
below-market rent was in exchange for 
future referrals, including referrals made 
beyond the expiration of the lease 
agreement. Therefore, in such a 
situation, if the physician does not pay 
the rental charges shortfall, the financial 
relationship may not end at the 
expiration of the written lease 
agreement, but rather could extend for 
some period beyond the expiration of 
the written lease agreement. We are not 
proposing to establish any specific time 
period or even guidelines for when the 
financial relationship in the above 
example would be deemed to end (so 
that future referrals would not be 
tainted); rather the determination of 
when the financial relationship ends 
must depend on the facts and 
circumstances. We note that our 
proposals pertain only to placing an 
outside limit on the period of 
disallowance for making referrals and 
billing the Medicare program in the case 
of certain noncompliant financial 
relationships; they do not address 
whether the anti-kickback statute is 
implicated and/or whether civil 
monetary penalties under the physician 
self-referral statute are potentially 
applicable due to noncompliant 
financial relationships. 
We are not proposing, as one 
commenter suggested, that, in a 
situation involving noncompliance due 
to excess compensation paid by an 
entity to a physician (or the physician’s 
immediate relative), the period of 
disallowance would end no later than 
the date the entity repays the excess 
compensation to the Medicare program, 
should the physician not repay the 
excess compensation to the entity. This 
approach is not consistent with the 
statute. We are also not proposing, as 
another commenter suggested, to 
impose no period of disallowance for 
the situation in which parties allegedly 
were unaware of the noncompliant 
nature of a financial relationship. We do 
not have the authority under section 
1877 of the Act to waive violations of 
the physician self-referral law. We note 
also that there would be practical 
problems in determining whether 
parties were unaware of the 
noncompliant nature of the arrangement 
and that we would be discouraging 
parties from carefully structuring 
arrangements and monitoring them. In 
the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule, we 
proposed an alternative method of 
compliance that may address some of 
the commenter’s concerns, and that 
proposal is still under consideration for 
final rulemaking. Finally, we are not 
proposing to impose a period of 
disqualification during which the 
parties to a noncompliant financial 
relationship would be prohibited from 
using a particular exception due to that 
relationship. We may propose 
rulemaking on this subject in the future. 
C. Gainsharing Arrangements 
1. Background 
The term ‘‘gainsharing’’ typically 
refers to an arrangement under which a 
hospital gives physicians a share of the 
reduction in the hospital’s costs (that is, 
the hospital’s cost savings) attributable 
in part to the physicians’ efforts. 
Gainsharing may take several forms. 
Some arrangements are narrowly 
targeted, giving the physician a financial 
incentive to select specific medical 
devices and products that are less 
expensive or to adopt specific clinical 
practices or protocols that reduce costs. 
Other, more problematic arrangements 
are not targeted at utilization of specific 
supplies or specific clinical practices, 
but instead offer the physician 
payments to reduce total average costs 
per case below target amounts. 
Gainsharing arrangements seek to 
align physician incentives with those of 
hospitals by offering physicians a share 
of the hospital’s variable cost savings 
attributable to the physicians’ efforts in 
controlling the cost of providing patient 
care. Following the institution of the 
Medicare Part A DRG system of hospital 
reimbursement and with the growth of 
managed care, hospitals have 
experienced significant financial 
pressure to reduce costs. However, 
because physicians are paid separately 
under Medicare Part B and Medicaid, 
physicians do not share necessarily a 
hospital’s incentive to control the 
hospital’s patient care costs. 
Gainsharing arrangements are designed 
to align hospital and physician 
incentives by offering physicians a 
portion of the hospital’s cost savings in 
exchange for identifying and 
implementing cost-saving strategies. 
2. Statutory Impediments to Gainsharing 
Arrangements 
Whereas gainsharing promotes 
hospital cost reductions by aligning 
physician incentives with those of the 
hospital, these arrangements also 
implicate the physician self-referral 
statute (section 1877 of the Act). Section 
1877(a)(1) of the Act states that, except 
as provided in section 1877(b) of the 
Act, if a physician (or an immediate 
family member of such physician) has a 
financial relationship with an entity, the 
physician may not make a referral to the 
entity for the furnishing of DHS for 
which payment otherwise may be made 
under title XVIII of the Act. The 
provision of monetary or nonmonetary 
remuneration by a hospital to a 
physician through a gainsharing 
arrangement would constitute a 
financial relationship with an entity for 
purposes of the physician self-referral 
statute. 
Gainsharing arrangements also 
implicate two specific fraud and abuse 
statutes. First, sections 1128A(b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of the Act, commonly referred to 
as the Civil Monetary Penalty, or CMP, 
statute, prohibit a hospital from 
knowingly making a payment directly or 
indirectly to a physician as an 
inducement to reduce or limit items or 
services furnished to Medicare or 
Medicaid beneficiaries, and a physician 
from knowingly accepting such 
payment. Second, gainsharing 
arrangements implicate section 
1128B(b) of the Act (the ‘‘anti-kickback 
statute’’) if one purpose of the cost 
savings payment is to influence referrals 
of Federal health care program business. 
3. Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
Approach Towards Gainsharing 
Arrangements 
The HHS Office of Inspector General 
(‘‘OIG’’) historically has been wary of

23693 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
gainsharing arrangements. In July 1999, 
OIG issued a Special Advisory Bulletin 
that addressed the application of 
sections 1128A(b)(1) and (2) of the Act 
to gainsharing arrangements. Although 
OIG recognized that appropriately 
structured gainsharing arrangements 
may offer significant benefits where 
there is no adverse impact on the 
quality of care received by patients, 
section 1128A(b) of the Act clearly 
prohibits arrangements that are 
intended as an inducement to limit or 
reduce services to Medicare or Medicaid 
patients. In addition, OIG stated that 
regulatory relief from the CMP 
prohibition would require statutory 
authorization. 
OIG has issued several favorable 
advisory opinions regarding individual 
gainsharing arrangements, although the 
opinions (like all OIG advisory 
opinions) do not have general 
applicability. When evaluating the risks 
posed by a gainsharing arrangement, 
OIG has generally looked for three types 
of safeguards, namely: (1) Measures that 
promote accountability and 
transparency; (2) adequate quality 
controls; and (3) controls on payments 
related to referrals. Properly structured, 
gainsharing arrangements may offer 
opportunities for hospitals to reduce 
costs without causing inappropriate 
reductions in medical services or 
rewarding referrals of Federal health 
care program patients. In a number of 
specific cases involving limited 
proposed arrangements, OIG has issued 
advisory opinions in which it 
concluded that the proposed 
arrangement presents a low risk of abuse 
and, therefore, it would exercise its 
prosecutorial discretion not to impose 
sanctions. In these cases, OIG has 
concluded, based on the totality of facts 
and circumstances and the presence of 
adequate safeguards, that: (1) The 
proposed arrangement would constitute 
an improper payment to induce the 
reduction or limitation of services as 
prohibited by sections 1128A(b)(1) and 
(2) of the Act, but that OIG would not 
impose sanctions on the requestors of 
the advisory opinion; and (2) the 
proposed arrangement would 
potentially generate prohibited 
remuneration under the anti-kickback 
statute if the requisite intent to induce 
or reward referrals of Federal health 
care program business were present, but 
that OIG would not impose 
administrative sanctions on the 
requestors under section 1128A(a), or 
under section 1128(b)(7) or section 
1128A(a)(7), as those sections relate to 
the commission of acts described in the 
anti-kickback statute. 
4. MedPAC Recommendation 
MedPAC, in its March 2005 Report to 
Congress, ‘‘Physician-owned Specialty 
Hospitals,’’ recommended that 
gainsharing arrangements between 
physicians and hospitals be permitted. 
Specifically, MedPAC stated that, ‘‘[t]he 
Congress should grant the Secretary the 
authority to allow gainsharing 
arrangements between physicians and 
hospitals and to regulate those 
arrangements to protect the quality of 
care and minimize financial incentives 
that could affect physician referrals.’’ 
(See http://www.medpac.gov/ 
publications/congressional repots/ 
Mar05EntireReport.pdf, at page 47). In 
addition, MedPAC stated that, drawing 
on OIG’s work, the Secretary could 
require that gainsharing arrangements: 
• Identify specific actions that would 
produce savings, such as limiting the 
inappropriate use of supplies; 
• Are transparent and disclosed to 
patients; 
• Include periodic reviews of quality 
of care by an independent organization; 
• Limit the amount of time during 
which physicians can share cost savings 
in order to prevent hospitals from using 
these agreements as a mechanism to 
induce physician referrals; 
• Avoid rewarding physicians for 
increasing referrals to the hospitals, 
such as capping potential savings based 
on the number of prior year admissions; 
and 
• Monitor changes in the severity, 
age, and insurance coverage of patients 
affected by the gainsharing arrangement. 
5. Demonstration Programs 
CMS has long been interested in 
evaluating the association between 
payments and the quality of care. In 
1991, CMS initiated a demonstration 
program entitled the ‘‘Medicare 
Participating Heart Bypass Center 
Demonstration.’’ This demonstration 
was conducted to assess the feasibility 
and cost effectiveness of a negotiated 
all-inclusive bundled payment 
arrangement for coronary artery bypass 
graft (CABG) surgery while maintaining 
high quality care. CMS originally 
negotiated contracts with four 
applicants. In 1993, the demonstration 
was expanded to include three more 
participants. The results of the 
demonstration showed that an all- 
inclusive bundled payment arrangement 
can provide an incentive to physicians 
and hospitals to work together to 
provide services more efficiently, 
improve quality, and reduce costs. The 
bundling of the physician and hospital 
payments did not have a negative 
impact on the post-discharge health 
improvements of the demonstration 
patients. Three of the four original 
hospitals were able to make major 
changes in physician practice patterns 
and operations that generated 
significant cost savings. A hospital’s 
participation in the demonstration 
appeared to have little or no effect on 
physician referral patterns. 
A second demonstration project that 
involves gainsharing arrangements is 
authorized by section 646 of the MMA, 
which added a new section 1866C of the 
Act and established the Medicare Health 
Care Quality MHCQ Demonstration 
Program. MHCQ demonstration projects 
are intended to ‘‘* * * examine health 
delivery factors that encourage the 
delivery of improved quality in patient 
care.’’ Using the authority provided by 
section 1866C of the Act, CMS decided 
to implement a 3-year demonstration 
that would test gainsharing models 
involving physicians and collaborations 
between hospitals working with 
physicians in a single geographic area to 
improve the quality of inpatient hospital 
care. In contrast to traditional models of 
gainsharing, the proposed 
demonstration approaches must be 
across single or multiple organizations 
and involve long-term followup to 
ensure both documented improvements 
in quality and reductions in the overall 
costs of care. CMS is particularly 
interested in demonstration designs 
that: (1) Track patients well beyond a 
hospital episode to determine the 
impact of hospital-physician 
collaborations on preventing short and 
longer-term complications, duplication 
of services, and coordination of care 
across settings; and (2) offer other 
quality improvements for eliminating 
preventable complications and 
unnecessary costs. 
A third series of demonstration 
projects was authorized by section 5007 
of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the 
‘‘DRA’’) (Pub. L. 109–171). This 
provision requires the Secretary to 
establish a qualified gainsharing 
demonstration under which the 
Secretary shall approve up to six 
demonstration projects. Section 5007 
demonstration projects would involve 
arrangements between a hospital and 
physicians and practitioners under 
which the hospital provides for 
remuneration (that is, gainsharing 
payments) to certain physicians and to 
certain practitioners (as defined in 
1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act) that 
represents solely a share of the savings 
incurred directly as a result of 
collaborative efforts between the 
hospital and a particular physician (or 
practitioner) to improve overall quality 
and efficiency. Each demonstration

project must also provide measures to 
monitor quality and efficiency in the 
participating project hospital(s). 
6. Solicitation of Comments 
In the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule, we 
noted that we are concerned about 
compensation arrangements between 
entities and physicians under which 
compensation is determined on a 
percentage basis (for example, rental 
charges for office space that are 
determined based on a percentage of a 
group practice’s revenues) (72 FR 
38184). We proposed to clarify that 
percentage-based compensation 
arrangements may be used only for 
paying for personally performed 
physician services and that such 
arrangements must be based on the 
revenues directly resulting from the 
physician services rather than based on 
some other factor such as a percentage 
of the savings by the hospital 
department. The proposed changes, if 
finalized, might prevent typical 
gainsharing arrangements between 
physicians and hospitals to which they 
refer for DHS. We have not yet finalized 
our proposal in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule; however, it remains under active 
consideration. 
Notwithstanding our general concern 
with arrangements that involve the use 
of a percentage-based compensation 
formula (other than payment to a 
physician for work personally 
performed by the physician), we 
recognize the value to the Medicare 
program and its beneficiaries where the 
alignment of hospital and physician 
incentives results in improvements in 
quality of care. Therefore, we are 
considering whether to issue an 
exception specific to gainsharing 
arrangements. Under section 1877(b)(4) 
of the Act, we may issue additional 
exceptions (that is, exceptions not 
specified in the statute) only where 
doing so would create no risk of 
program or patient abuse. At this time, 
we decline to issue a specific proposal 
concerning an exception for gainsharing 
arrangements, but rather are soliciting 
comments as to whether we should 
establish an exception for gainsharing 
arrangements, and, if so, what 
safeguards should be included in the 
exception. Specifically, we are 
interested in receiving comments on: (1) 
What types of requirements and 
safeguards should be included in any 
exception for gainsharing arrangements; 
and (2) whether certain services, clinical 
protocols, or other arrangements should 
not qualify for the exception. 
D. Physician-Owned Implant and Other 
Medical Device Companies 
1. Background 
We have recently become aware of an 
increase in physician investment in 
implant and other medical device 
manufacturing, distribution, and 
purchasing companies. We recognize 
that physician involvement often adds 
value to device manufacturing 
companies and that many physicians 
may have legitimate investment 
interests in these companies. Physicians 
participate in the research, 
development, and testing involved in 
creating and producing many lifesaving 
and quality-of-life enhancing medical 
devices. The added value of physician 
involvement in distribution and 
purchasing companies, essentially 
middlemen companies, is less clear. 
When physicians profit from the 
referrals they make to hospitals through 
physician-owned implant and medical 
device companies (‘‘POCs’’), we are 
concerned about possible program or 
patient abuse. POCs exist in three 
primary forms: manufacturers, 
distributors, and group purchasing 
organizations (‘‘GPOs’’). Our 
understanding, however, is that many 
POCs are not manufacturers, but rather 
are companies that profit from the 
purchase and resale of products made 
by another organization (that is, they act 
as distributors) or from GPO fees paid 
by device vendors. In many cases, the 
physician investors bear little, if any, 
economic risk with respect to the 
medical devices. It is also our 
understanding that some physicians are 
offered investment interests in ‘‘private 
label’’ or similar manufacturing entities 
when the physicians have provided 
little, if any, necessary research, design, 
or testing services. We are concerned 
that some physician-owned 
organizations may serve little purpose 
other than providing physicians the 
opportunity to earn economic benefits 
in exchange for nothing more than 
ordering medical devices or other 
products that the physician-investors 
use on their own patients. The financial 
incentives paid to the physicians may 
foster an anti-competitive climate, raise 
quality of care concerns, and lead to 
overutilization of the device or other 
product to which the physician is 
linked. Physicians are responsible for 
selecting or recommending the devices 
ordered for the hospital’s patients. It is 
reasonable to believe that medical 
device or implant companies without 
physician investment will have 
difficulty finding referral sources in 
areas where many physicians are 
invested in a POC that offers competing 
products. 
In response to our proposed change to 
the definition of ‘‘entity’’ at § 411.351 in 
the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule, we 
received public comments regarding 
whether a physician-owned implant or 
other medical device company should 
or should not be considered to be an 
‘‘entity.’’ One commenter noted that 
orthopedic surgeons may have an 
ownership interest in a manufacturer of 
spinal implants that sells its implants to 
the hospital where the surgeon performs 
his or her surgeries. According to the 
commenter, because the proposed 
definition of ‘‘entity’’ would extend to 
an entity that ‘‘performs the DHS,’’ the 
manufacturer arguably could be 
considered to be an ‘‘entity’’ under 
§ 411.351. This commenter urged us to 
exclude such manufacturers from the 
definition of ‘‘entity.’’ The commenter 
stated that indirect arrangements 
involving spinal implants would trigger 
the self-referral prohibition if they are 
not at fair market value. Comments 
submitted on behalf of a manufacturer 
of spinal implants asserted that, despite 
superficial similarities, joint ventures 
involving medical devices differ in 
many material ways from the types of 
arrangements about which we expressed 
concern. This commenter also asserted 
that the meaning of ‘‘has performed the 
DHS’’ is unclear and that we should 
clarify that the proposal applied only to 
‘‘true’’ ‘‘under arrangement’’ 
relationships with hospitals, but that, in 
any event, implantable devices are not 
DHS. According to the commenter, even 
if implantable devices were deemed to 
be DHS, the rigorous physician self- 
referral exceptions (for example, the 
exception for indirect compensation 
arrangements in § 411.357(p)) are still 
available to protect the arrangement and 
against program or patient abuse. 
In an October 6, 2006 letter response 
to a request for guidance regarding 
certain physician investments in the 
medical device industry, OIG stated that 
it was aware of an apparent proliferation 
of physician investments in medical 
device and distribution companies, 
including GPOs, and that, given the 
strong potential for improper 
inducements between and among the 
physician investors, the companies, 
device vendors, and medical device 
purchasers, it believed that all of these 
ventures should be closely scrutinized 
under the fraud and abuse laws. OIG 
also clarified that its 1989 Special Fraud 
Alert on Joint Ventures applies to all 
physician joint ventures and would, 
therefore, apply to physician 
investments in medical device 
manufacturing and distribution

companies, as well as GPOs. OIG 
confirmed that the fact that a substantial 
portion of a venture’s gross revenues is 
derived from participant-driven referrals 
is a potential indicator of a problematic 
joint venture. The October 6, 2006 letter 
response is available at http://

2008/demske_testimony022708.pdf. 
A medical device company requested 
that we take a closer look at the current 
prevalence of POCs and the impact that 
these companies may have on program 
or patient abuse, as well as the negative 
impact on competition among POCs and 
nonphysician owned medical device 
companies. This company noted that, in 
the CY2008 PFS proposed rule, we 
proposed revising the definition of 
‘‘entity’’ to include, among other things, 
an entity that causes a claim to be 
submitted to Medicare. It suggested that 
we finalize our proposal and that we 
deem POCs to be DHS entities under 
certain circumstances. It also suggested 
that, in certain circumstances, physician 
investors in POCs should be deemed to 
have a direct compensation relationship 
with the hospitals that order and use 
implantable devices furnished by the 
POCs. The company suggested that a 
POC should not be considered to have 
caused a claim to be presented where 
the referring physician is named as an 
inventor on an issued patent for the 
implantable item, provided that the 
physician does not receive any 
remuneration from the POC based on 
the volume or value of his or her 
referrals, or where the physician’s 
investment interest satisfies the 
requirements of the exception in 
§ 411.356(a) for large, publicly traded 
entities. We note that it is not clear to 
us under what circumstances a patent 
holder physician, who presumably 
receives royalty payments from the 
POC, would receive remuneration that 
does not relate to the volume or value 
of referrals or other business generated 
by the physician. In the Phase II final 
rule with comment period, we noted 
that we received a comment that 
questioned whether the payment of a 
royalty by an equipment manufacturer 
to a physician inventor for a device 
implanted during surgeries performed 
by the physician inventor is permitted 
or whether that arrangement would 
create an indirect compensation 
relationship with the hospital that 
purchased the device. We stated, in 
response, that the physician inventor 
would have an indirect compensation 
arrangement with the hospital in which 
the surgeries are performed but, 
provided the royalty payment was fair 
market value, the relationship should 
satisfy the exception for indirect 
compensation arrangements in 
§ 411.357(p) (69FR 16060). 
2. Solicitation of Comments 
At this time, we are not issuing a 
specific proposal regarding POCs. The 
statute and our existing regulations, 
specifically those related to indirect 
compensation arrangements, address 
many POCs. In some problematic 
circumstances, an unbroken chain of 
financial relationships will connect the 
physician owner of a POC to a DHS 
entity to which the physician makes 
referrals, and the other elements of an 
indirect compensation arrangement 
contained in § 411.354(c)(2) will also be 
present, including the requisite 
knowledge by the DHS entity of the 
physician’s interest in the POC. In many 
instances, the arrangement would not 
satisfy the requirements of the exception 
for indirect compensation arrangements 
in § 411.357(p), and would, therefore, 
run afoul of the physician self-referral 
statute. However, we are soliciting 
public comments as to whether our 
physician self-referral rules should 
address POCs and similar physician 
owned companies more specifically, or 
whether the concerns surrounding POCs 
and similar organizations, to the extent 
that they are not addressed by the 
statute and our current rules, are better 
addressed through enforcement of the 
False Claims Act, the anti-kickback 
statute and similar fraud and abuse 
laws, other public laws, and through 
other applicable Federal, State, and 
local regulations. In this regard, we are 
seeking comments as to whether, and to 
what degree, physician investment in 
POCs and similar organizations presents 
risks of overutilization, substandard 
care, and increased costs to the 
Medicare program and its beneficiaries, 
or whether the risk is confined to 
possible anti-competitive behavior. To 
the extent that commenters believe that 
certain physician investment in POCs 
and similar organizations should be 
addressed more specifically under our 
physician self-referral rules, 
commenters are encouraged to provide 
us with suggestions as to specific 
actions we should take (for example, 
considering POCs to be DHS entities 
under certain circumstances, 
considering physician investors in POCs 
who influence hospitals as to the 
ordering of medical devices to have 
direct compensation relationships with 
the hospitals, excepting certain 
investment interests from coverage 
under our rules, etc.). 
IX. Financial Relationships Between 
Hospitals and Physicians 
A. Background 
As stated earlier, under section 1877 
of the Act, a physician is prohibited 
from referring a Medicare patient for 
DHS to an entity (including an 
individual) with which the physician 
(or an immediate family member of the 
physician) has a financial relationship, 
unless an exception applies. In addition, 
section 1877 of the Act provides that an 
entity may not present or cause to be 
presented a claim or bill to Medicare or 
any individual, third party payor, or 
other entity for DHS furnished as a 
result of a prohibited referral. Also, 
section 1877 of the Act prohibits us 
from making payment for DHS 
furnished pursuant to a prohibited 
referral. The statute contains several 
exceptions for certain types of 
compensation arrangements and 
ownership or investment interests, 
including the exception in section 
1877(d)(3) of the Act for ownership or 
investment by a physician in the 
hospital itself and not merely in a 
subdivision of the hospital (that is, the 
‘‘whole’’ hospital). Section 1877(b)(4) of 
the Act authorizes us to create 
additional exceptions, provided that 
they do not create a risk of program or 
patient abuse. As a result of the 
statutory exceptions in section 1877 of 
the Act, and the exceptions we have 
created using our authority under 
section 1877(b)(4) of the Act, our 
regulations contain approximately 40 
exceptions to the prohibition on 
physician self-referrals. (We refer 
readers to 42 CFR 411.351 through 
411.357 of our regulations and the 
September 5, 2007 ‘‘Phase III’’ final rule 
(72 FR 51012).) 
Section 1877(f) of the Act provides 
that: ‘‘Each entity providing covered 
items or services for which payment 
may be made under this title [42 USCS 
1395 et seq.] shall provide the Secretary 
with the information concerning the 
entity’s ownership, investment, and 
compensation arrangements, including: 
(1) The covered items and services 
provided by the entity, and (2) the 
names and unique physician 
identification numbers of all physicians 
with an ownership or investment 
interest (as described in subsection 
(a)(2)(A)), or with a compensation 
arrangement (as described in subsection 
(a)(2)(B)), in the entity, or whose 
immediate relatives have such an 
ownership or investment interest or 
who have a compensation relationship 
with the entity. Such information shall 
be provided in such form, manner, and

23696 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
at such times as the Secretary shall 
specify.’’ (Emphasis added) 
Some industry representatives have 
argued that the reference to financial 
relationships as described in section 
1877(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B) of the Act 
limits our ability to obtain information 
on financial relationships that do not 
satisfy one of the statutory or regulatory 
exceptions. We disagree. The statute 
clearly contains a broad authorization 
for the Secretary to obtain information 
concerning an entity’s financial 
relationships, ‘‘including,’’ but not 
limited to, financial relationships that 
satisfy an exception. We believe that 
there would have been little point to the 
Congress providing us with the 
authority to compel information on 
excepted arrangements only, because, as 
we have noted previously, ‘‘an entity 
could decide that one or more of its 
financial relationships falls within an 
exception, fail to retain data concerning 
those financial relationships, and 
thereby prevent the government from 
reviewing the arrangements to 
determine if they qualify for an 
exception.’’ (72 FR 51069.) Accordingly, 
our regulation in § 411.361 requires 
entities to report ‘‘any ownership or 
investment interest, as defined at 
§ 411.354(b), or any compensation 
arrangement, as defined at § 411.354(c), 
except for ownership or investment 
interests that satisfy the exceptions set 
forth in § 411.356(a) and § 411.356(b) 
regarding publicly-traded securities and 
mutual funds’’ (emphasis added). The 
statute provides that an ownership or 
investment interest in the entity may be 
through equity, debt, or other means, 
and includes an interest in an entity that 
holds an ownership or investment 
interest in any entity that furnishes 
DHS. 
Our regulations have been drafted to 
reflect clearly our commonsense 
interpretation of the statutory reporting 
requirements. In the proposed rule 
entitled ‘‘Medicare and Medicaid 
Programs; Physicians’’ Referrals to 
Health Care Entities With Which They 
Have Financial Relationships,’’ 
published in the Federal Register on 
January 9, 1998 (63 FR 1703), we 
proposed to modify § 411.361 to require 
that entities report information 
concerning their reportable financial 
relationships to us on a prescribed form 
and thereafter report annually all 
changes to the submitted information 
that occurred in the previous 12 
months. In addition, we revisited the 
statute and interpreted the opening 
paragraph of section 1877(f) of the Act 
to permit us to gather any data on 
financial relationships, including, but 
not necessarily limited to, financial 
relationships for which there are no 
exceptions under section 1877(a)(2)(A) 
or (a)(2)(B) of the Act. Therefore, we 
proposed to amend § 411.361 to reflect 
explicitly our authority to ask for a 
broader scope of information than the 
regulation permitted at that time. 
In the Phase II final rule with 
comment period (69 FR 16121), we 
modified the reporting requirement in 
§ 411.361 to remove all references to the 
use of a prescribed form, to require 
entities to make information available 
only upon request, and to maintain the 
information only for the length of time 
specified by the applicable regulatory 
requirements for the information (that 
is, the rules of the Internal Revenue 
Service, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Medicare, Medicaid, or 
other programs). In addition, we 
modified § 411.361 to provide that 
entities need not report ownership or 
investment interests that satisfy the 
exceptions in § 411.356(a) and (b) for 
publicly-traded securities and mutual 
funds. 
Most, if not all, hospitals have 
financial relationships with referring 
physicians. These financial 
relationships may involve ownership or 
investment interests, compensation 
arrangements, or both. The financial 
relationships can be direct or they may 
be indirect (such as through a physician 
group practice or limited liability 
company). The physician self-referral 
statute was first enacted in 1989, and 
the reporting requirements in the 
regulations in § 411.361 were first 
implemented in our December 3, 1991 
interim final rule with comment period, 
published in the Federal Register at 56 
FR 61374. Since that time, CMS has not 
engaged in a comprehensive reporting 
initiative to examine financial 
relationships between hospitals and 
physicians. Consistent with 
congressional intent in enacting the 
physician self-referral statute, we 
believe it is important to query hospitals 
concerning their financial relationships 
with physicians. 
B. Section 5006 of the Deficit Reduction 
Act (DRA) of 2005 
Section 5006 of the DRA required the 
Secretary to develop a strategic and 
implementing plan to address certain 
issues relating to physician-owned 
specialty hospitals. The specific issues 
the Secretary was required to address 
were: (1) Proportionality of investment 
return; (2) bona fide investment; (3) 
annual disclosure of investment 
information; (4) the provision by 
specialty hospitals of (i) care to patients 
who are eligible for Medicaid (or who 
are not eligible for Medicaid but who 
are regarded as such because they 
receive benefits under a section 1115 
waiver) and (ii) charity care; and (5) 
appropriate enforcement. In order to 
assist us in preparing the report and 
implementing plan required by section 
5006 of the DRA, we sent a voluntary 
survey to 130 specialty hospitals and 
220 competitor hospitals, which sought 
information regarding, among other 
things, the hospitals’ ownership and 
investment relationships, and their 
compensation arrangements with 
physicians. In the enforcement section 
of the strategic and implementing plan 
that was included in our ‘‘Final Report 
to the Congress and Strategic and 
Implementing Plan Required under 
Section 5006 of the Deficit Reduction 
Act of 2005’’ issued on August 8, 2006, 
available on our Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PhysicianSelfReferral/ 
06a_DRA_Reports.asp (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘‘DRA Report to 
Congress’’), we stated that we would 
require all hospitals (that is, not just 
specialty hospitals) to provide us 
information on a periodic basis 
concerning the investment interests in 
the hospital of physicians and the 
hospital’s compensation arrangements 
with physicians (DRA Report to 
Congress 69). We stated that we would 
not limit our requirement to information 
concerning physician investments in 
specialty hospitals for two reasons. 
First, physician investments in any type 
of hospital raise potential issues 
concerning compensation arrangements 
that can be associated with the 
investment. For example, a 
disproportionate return on investment 
or non-bona fide investment (through, 
for example, a sham loan), creates a 
prohibited compensation arrangement 
under the physician self-referral law 
and raises the possibility of an illegal 
kickback scheme. Second, other types of 
compensation arrangements (that is, 
those that are not associated with an 
investment interest), implicate the 
physician self-referral law, such as 
leasing, employment, and personal 
service arangements. It is also important 
to note that, although a physician may 
be highly motivated to refer patients to 
a hospital in which he or she has an 
ownership interest, the physician may 
be just as likely to refer patients to a 
hospital with which he or she has a 
compensation relationship, given that 
the physician may see a more direct and 
immediate financial benefit from the 
compensation arrangement. In the DRA 
Report to Congress, we stated that we 
would implement a regular disclosure 
process, but that we had not designed

the process at that point, and that we 
would consider such issues as whether 
we should: (1) Survey all hospitals 
annually; (2) stagger our survey so that 
all hospitals are queried but not all in 
the same year; and/or (3) focus our 
inquiry on certain types of relationships 
or certain hospitals. We stated that we 
would also consider whether, having 
once provided information, hospitals 
need only submit updated information 
on a yearly or other periodic basis. 
C. Disclosure of Financial Relationships 
Report (DFRR) 
Following up on our commitment to 
capture information concerning 
financial relationships between all types 
of hospitals and physicians, and to 
assist in enforcement of the physician 
self-referral statute and implementing 
regulations, we created an information 
collection instrument, referred to as the 
Disclosure of Financial Relationships 
Report (‘‘DFRR’’). The DFRR is designed 
to collect information concerning the 
ownership and investment interests and 
compensation arrangements between 
hospitals and physicians. (Appendix C 
of this proposed rule contains the DFRR 
instrument and instructions for public 
comment.) We believe information 
submitted by hospitals would permit us 
to analyze the types of financial 
relationships involving hospitals and 
physicians, the structure of various 
compensation arrangements and trends 
therein, and potentially whether the 
hospitals are in compliance with the 
physician self-referral law and 
implementing regulations. Using our 
authority under section 1877(f) of the 
Act and 42 CFR 411.361, we are 
proposing to send the DFRR to 500 
hospitals, a number that we believe is 
necessary to provide us with sufficient 
information: (1) To determine 
compliance; and (2) to assist us in any 
future rulemaking concerning the 
reporting requirements and other 
physician self-referral provisions. 
We intend for our sample size to be 
a significant percentage of the total 
number of Medicare-participating 
hospitals. The 2007 CMS Statistics 
Handbook determined that, as of 
December 2006, there were 
approximately 6,200 Medicare- 
participating hospitals. Our goal is to 
begin by sending the DFRR to 8 to 10 
percent of the Medicare-participating 
hospitals (496 to 620 hospitals). We 
reviewed our available funding and 
determined that our resources would 
permit us to review data from 500 
hospitals (both general acute care 
hospitals and specialty hospitals). 
As discussed further below, the DFRR 
also may assist us in making an 
informed decision as to whether to 
propose rulemaking for an annual (or 
other periodic) disclosure requirement 
for all hospitals. By posing a 
comprehensive set of questions to a 
significant number of hospitals, we 
believe that we will be informed not 
only as to whether we should engage in 
such rulemaking, but also as to what the 
design of the proposed information 
collection should look like. 
Originally, we had planned to pilot 
this information collection request in 
advance of rulemaking. Thus, we 
prepared a proposed information 
collection request in accordance with 
the Paperwork Reduction Act. We 
announced and sought public comment 
on the information collection request in 
a 60-day Federal Register notice (CMS– 
10236) that was published on May 18, 
2007 (72 FR 28056). On September 14, 
2007, we published in the Federal 
Register a revised information 
collection request in which we 
increased the time estimate for 
completing the DFRR and increased the 
time for submission of the DFRR from 
45 days to 60 days (72 FR 52568). (For 
additional information, we refer the 
reader to 72 FR 28056 and 72 FR 52568.) 
In this proposed rule, we are 
providing a discussion of the potential 
burden associated with completing the 
DFRR, including an analysis that 
provides estimates of the burden for 
small, medium, and large hospitals. To 
better understand the potential burden 
for completing the DFRR collection, we 
reviewed the bed size of Medicare- 
participating hospitals and developed 
three categories of hospitals (small, 
medium, and large hospitals). We 
randomly selected 20 hospitals from 
each category and requested that these 
60 hospitals estimate the aggregate 
number of hours it would take them to 
complete and submit the entire DFRR 
collection. The 33 hospitals that 
responded included 11 small, 11 
medium, and 11 large hospitals. We 
reviewed the responses from the 33 
hospitals and determined that the 
average number of hours to complete 
the DFRR was 31 hours. This figure 
represents a significant increase from 
our most recent time and burden 
estimate. Therefore, we believe it would 
be beneficial to seek further comments 
on the accuracy of the time and burden 
estimates associated with this 
information collection instrument. 
Because the information that we seek is 
that which hospitals should already be 
keeping in the normal course of their 
business activities (even apart from the 
need to document compliance with the 
physician self-referral law), we 
anticipate that the majority of the time 
spent completing the DFRR will be 
spent by administrative staff. We believe 
that the tasks involved would include 
retrieving the information and printing 
it from electronic files or copy it from 
hard files, which largely should involve 
administrative personnel. In addition, 
the review and organization of the 
materials would also impose burden on 
the respondent. Nevertheless, in order 
to err on the side of more potential 
burden rather than less, we have 
calculated costs using an hourly rate for 
accountants. 
D. Civil Monetary Penalties 
We are proposing that the DFRR be 
completed, certified by the appropriate 
officer of the hospital, and received by 
CMS within 60 days of the date that 
appears on the cover letter or e-mail 
transmission of the DFRR. We are 
soliciting comment on the proposed 60- 
day timeframe for completing the DFRR. 
Section 411.361(f) provides that 
failure to timely submit the requested 
information concerning an entity’s 
ownership, investment, and 
compensation arrangements may result 
in civil monetary penalties of up to 
$10,000 for each day beyond the 
deadline established for disclosure. 
Although we have the authority to 
impose civil monetary penalties, we 
seek not to invoke this authority and 
will work with entities to comply with 
the reporting requirements. Prior to 
imposing a civil monetary penalty in 
any amount, we would issue a letter to 
any hospital that does not return the 
completed DFRR, inquiring as to why 
the hospital did not return timely the 
completed DFRR. In addition, a hospital 
may, upon a demonstration of good 
cause, receive an extension of time to 
submit the requested information. 
E. Uses of Information Captured by the 
DFRR 
As noted above, we anticipate that the 
DFRR will be useful in determining 
whether the financial relationships 
between 500 hospitals and the 
physicians associated with those 
hospitals are in compliance with the 
physician self-referral statute and 
regulations. In addition, the results of 
the DFRR may assist us in other 
rulemaking efforts. 
In the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule, we 
proposed certain changes to our 
physician self-referral rules (72 FR 
38179 through 38187). With the 
exception of the anti-markup 
provisions, however, we have not yet 
finalized any of the proposals. We are 
actively working on the proposals, and 
although we expect to finalize the 
proposals before receiving and

analyzing the completed DFRRs, 
information gleaned from the completed 
DFRRs may shape our final rulemaking 
if that rulemaking is delayed. Our 
analysis of the DFRRs may affect 
subsequent proposals on these and other 
related issues. 
F. Solicitation of Comments 
We are soliciting comments on the 
DFRR information collection instrument 
through this proposed rule as follows: 
• Whether the collection effort should 
be recurring, and, if so, whether it 
should be implemented on an annual or 
some other periodic basis. 
• Whether we are collecting too much 
or not enough information, and whether 
we are collecting the correct (or 
incorrect) type of information. 
• The amount of time it will take 
hospitals to complete the DFRR and the 
costs associated with completing the 
DFRR; the amount of time we should 
give hospitals to complete and return 
their responses to us. 
• Whether we should direct the 
collection instrument to all hospitals, 
and, if so, whether we should stagger 
the collection so that only a certain 
number of hospitals are subject to it in 
any given year. 
• Whether hospitals, once having 
completed the DFRR, should have to 
send in yearly updates and report only 
changed information. 
X. MedPAC Recommendations 
We are required by section 
1886(e)(4)(B) of the Act to respond to 
MedPAC’s recommendations regarding 
hospital inpatient payments in our 
annual proposed and final IPPS rules. 
We have reviewed MedPAC’s March 
2008 ‘‘Report to the Congress: Medicare 
Payment Policy’’ and have given it 
careful consideration in conjunction 
with the proposed policies set forth in 
this document. MedPAC’s 
Recommendation 2A–1 states that ‘‘The 
Congress should increase payment rates 
for the acute inpatient and outpatient 
prospective payment systems in 2009 by 
the projected rate of increase in the 
hospital market basket index, 
concurrent with implementation of a 
quality incentive payment program.’’ 
This recommendation is discussed in 
Appendix B to this proposed rule. 
Recommendation 2A–2: MedPAC 
recommended that ‘‘The Congress 
should reduce the indirect medical 
education adjustment in 2009 by 1 
percentage point to 4.5 percent per 10 
percent increment in the resident-to-bed 
ratio. The funds obtained by reducing 
the indirect medical education 
adjustment should be used to fund a 
quality incentive payment program.’’ 
Response: Redirecting funds obtained 
by reducing the IME adjustment to fund 
a quality incentive payment program is 
consistent with the VBP initiatives to 
improve the quality of care and, 
therefore, merits consideration. 
However, section 502(a) of Pub. L. 108– 
173 modified the formula multiplier (c) 
to be used in the calculation of the IME 
adjustment beginning midway through 
FY 2004 and provided for a new 
schedule of formula multipliers for FYs 
2005 and thereafter. Consequently, CMS 
could not implement MedPAC’s 
recommendation to reduce the IME 
adjustment in 2009 without a statutory 
change. We note that included in the 
President’s FY 2009 budget proposal 
was a proposal to reduce the IME 
adjustment from 5.5 percent to 2.2 
percent over 3 years, starting in FY 
2009, in order to better align IME 
payments with the estimated costs per 
case that teaching hospitals may face. 
In its June 2007 ‘‘Report to Congress: 
Promoting Greater Efficiency in 
Medicare,’’ MedPAC made 
recommendations concerning the 
Medicare hospital wage index. Section 
106(b)(1) of the MIEA–TRHCA (Pub. L. 
109–432) required MedPAC to submit to 
Congress, not later than June 30, 2007, 
a report on the Medicare hospital wage 
index classification system applied 
under the Medicare IPPS, including any 
alternatives that MedPAC recommended 
to the method to compute the wage 
index under section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the 
Act. In addition, section 106(b)(2) of the 
MIEA–TRHCA instructed the Secretary 
taking into account MedPAC’s 
recommendations on the Medicare 
hospital wage index classification 
system, to include in this FY 2009 IPPS 
proposed rule one or more proposals to 
revise the wage index adjustment 
applied under section 1886(d)(3)(E) of 
the Act for purposes of the IPPS. The 
MedPAC recommendations and our 
proposals concerning the Medicare 
hospital wage index are discussed in 
section III.B. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule.

B. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
1. Legislative Requirement for 
Solicitation of Comments 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, we are required to provide 60- 
day notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comment before a 
collection of information requirement is 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. In order to fairly evaluate 
whether an information collection 
should be approved by OMB, section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we 
solicit comment on the following issues: 
• The need for the information 
collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency. 
• The accuracy of our estimate of the 
information collection burden. 
• The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected. 
• Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
2. Solicitation of Comments on 
Proposed Requirements in Regulatory 
Text 
We are soliciting public comment on 
each of the issues listed under section 
XI.B.1. of this preamble for the 
following sections of this document that 
contain information collection 
requirements (ICRs): 
a. ICRs Regarding Physician Reporting 
Requirements (§ 411.361) 
Section 411.361(a) of the regulations 
states that except for entities that 
furnish 20 or fewer Part A and Part B 
services during a calendar year or for 
Medicare covered services furnished 
outside the United States, all entities 
furnishing services for which payment 
may be made under Medicare must 
submit information to CMS or to the 
Office of the Inspector General (OIG) 
concerning their reportable financial 
relationships (any ownership or 
investment interest, or compensation 
arrangement) in the form, manner, and 
at times that CMS or OIG specifies. As 
described in section IX. of the preamble 
of this proposed rule, and in accordance 
with its authority under 42 CFR 
411.361(e), CMS is requiring that 
hospitals provide information 
concerning their ownership, investment 
and compensation arrangements with 
physicians by completing the DFRR 
instrument. 
An information collection request 
concerning the DFRR was previously 
submitted to OMB for approval. We 
announced and sought public comment 
on the information collection request in 
both 60-day and 30-day Federal 
Register notices that published on May 
18, 2007 (72 FR 28056), and September 
14, 2007 (72 FR 52568), respectively. As 
further discussed in section IX. of this 
preamble, we have decided to obtain 
additional input from the public 
concerning the time and cost burden 
associated with completing and 
submitting the DFRR instrument. (The 
instrument is included as Appendix C 
to this proposed rule.) We believe that 
hospital accounting personnel would be 
responsible for: (1) Ensuring that the 
appropriate data or supporting 
documentation is retrieved; (2) 
completing the DFRR; and (3) 
submitting the DFRR to the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer, or comparable officer of the 
hospital for his or her signature on the 
certification statement. 
Initially, CMS would require 500 
hospitals to complete and submit the 
DFRR instrument. We estimate that 
these tasks would require 31 hours for 
each of the 500 hospitals to complete 
the DFRR. Thus, the total number of 
burden hours required for 500 hospitals 
to complete the DFRR instrument is 
15,500 hours. 
b. ICRs Regarding Risk Adjustment Data 
(§ 422.310) 
As discussed in section IV.H. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, 
§ 422.310(b) states that each MA 
organization must submit to CMS (in 
accordance with CMS instructions) the 
data necessary to characterize the 
context and purposes of each item and 
service provided to a Medicare enrollee 
by a provider, supplier, physician, or 
other practitioner. In addition, 
§ 422.310(b) states that CMS may collect 
data necessary to characterize the 
functional limitations of enrollees of

each MA organization. Section 
422.310(c) lists the nature of the data 
elements to be submitted to CMS. 
The burden associated with these 
requirements is the time and effort 
necessary for the MA organization to 
submit the necessary data to CMS. 
These requirements are subject to the 
PRA and the associated burden is 
currently approved under OMB control 
number 0938–0878. However, under 
notice and comment periods separate 
from this proposed rule, we intend to 
revise the currently approved 
information collection to include 
burden estimates as they pertain to 
§ 422.310. The preliminary burden 
estimate for this proposed rule is as 
follows: Currently, there are 676 MA 
organizations. Assuming that 99 percent 
of encounter data claims are submitted 
electronically and 1 percent are 
submitted manually, we estimate that it 
will take 1,089 hours annually for 
submission of electronic claims and 
73,335 hours annually for submission of 
manual claims. The estimated annual 
burden associated with these 
requirements is an annual average of 
110 hours per MA organization. 
c. ICRs Regarding Basic Commitments of 
Providers (§ 489.20) 
As discussed in section IV.I. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, 
proposed § 489.20(r)(2) states that a 
hospital, as defined in § 489.24(b), must 
maintain an on-call list of physicians on 
its medical staff to provide treatment 
necessary to stabilize patients who are 
receiving services required under 
§ 489.24 in accordance with the 
resources available to the hospital. The 
burden associated with this requirement 
is the time and effort necessary to draft, 
maintain, and periodically update the 
list of on-call physicians. We estimate 
that it will take 3 hours for each of the 
100 Medicare-participating hospitals to 
comply with this recordkeeping 
requirement. The estimated annual 
burden associated with this requirement 
is 300 hours. 
As discussed in section VII. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, 
proposed § 489.20(u)(1) states that, in 
the case of a physician-owned hospital 
as defined in § 489.3, the hospital must 
furnish written notice to all patients at 
the beginning of their hospital stay or 
outpatient visit that the hospital is a 
physician-owned facility. In addition, 
patients must be advised that a list of 
the hospital’s owners or investors who 
are physicians (or immediate family 
members of physicians) is available 
upon request. Upon receiving the 
request of the patient or an individual 
on behalf of the patient, a hospital must 
immediately disseminate the list to the 
requesting patient. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements in this section is the time 
and effort necessary for a hospital to 
furnish written notice to all patients that 
the hospital is a physician-owned 
hospital. Whereas this requirement is 
subject to the PRA, the associated 
burden is currently approved under 
OMB control number 0938–1034, with 
an expiration date of February 28, 2011. 
In addition, there is burden associated 
with furnishing a patient with the list of 
the hospital’s owners or investors who 
are physicians (or immediate family 
members of physicians) at the time of 
the patient request. However, CMS has 
no way to accurately quantify the 
burden because we cannot estimate the 
number of this type of request that a 
hospital may receive. We are soliciting 
public comments on the annual number 
of requests a hospital may receive for 
lists of physician-owners and investors, 
and will reevaluate this issue in the 
final rule stage of rulemaking. 
Proposed § 489.20(u)(2) would require 
disclosure of physician ownership as a 
condition of continued medical staff 
membership or admitting privileges. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort 
required for a hospital to develop, draft, 
and implement changes to its medical 
staff bylaws and other policies 
governing admitting privileges. 
Approximately 175 physician-owned 
hospitals would be required to comply 
with this requirement. We estimate that 
it will require a hospital’s general 
counsel 4 hours to revise a hospital’s 
medical staff bylaws and policies 
governing admitting privileges. 
Therefore, the total annual hospital 
burden would be 700 hours. 
In addition, the proposed 
§ 489.20(u)(2) imposes a burden on 
physicians. As stated earlier, all 
physicians who are also members of the 
hospital’s medical staff must agree, as a 
condition of continued medical staff 
membership or admitting privileges, to 
disclose, in writing, to all patients they 
refer to the hospital any ownership or 
investment interest in the hospital held 
by themselves or by an immediate 
family member. The disclosure must be 
made at the time the referral is made. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort 
necessary for a physician to draft a 
disclosure and to provide it to the 
patient at the time the referral is made 
to the physician-owned hospital. We 
estimate that it will take each physician, 
or designated office staff member, 1 
hour to develop a disclosure notice and 
make copies that will be distributed to 
patients. In addition, we estimate 30 
seconds to provide the disclosure to 
each patient and an additional 30 
seconds to record the proof of disclosure 
into each patient’s medical record. 
Although we can estimate the number 
of physician-owned hospitals, we are 
unable to quantify the number of 
physicians that possess an ownership or 
investment interest in hospitals. There 
is limited data available concerning 
physician ownership in hospitals. The 
studies to date, including those by CMS 
and the Government Accountability 
Office, pertain to physician ownership 
in specialty hospitals (cardiac, 
orthopedic, and surgical hospitals). 
These specialty hospital studies 
published data concerning the average 
percentage of shares of direct ownership 
by physicians (less than 2 percent), 
indirect ownership through group 
practices, and the aggregate percentage 
of physician ownership, but did not 
publish the number of physician owners 
in these types of hospitals. More 
importantly, proposed § 489.20(u)(2) 
would apply to physician ownership in 
any type of hospital. Our other research 
involved a review of enrollment data. 
However, the CMS enrollment 
application (CMS–855) requires the 
reporting of ownership interests that 
exceed 5 percent or greater, and, thus, 
most physician ownership is not 
captured. In summary, because we are 
unable to estimate the total physician 
burden associated with this reporting 
requirement, we are seeking public 
comment pertaining to this burden and 
will reevaluate this issue in the final 
rule stage of rulemaking. 
Proposed § 489.20(v) states that the 
aforementioned requirements in 
§ 489.20(u)(1) and (u)(2) do not apply to 
a physician-owned hospital that does 
not have at least one referring physician 
who has an ownership or investment 
interest in the hospital or who has an 
immediate family member who has an 
ownership or investment interest in the 
hospital. To comply with this exception, 
an eligible hospital must sign an 
attestation to that effect and maintain 
the document in its records. Therefore, 
the number of hospitals that are now 
subject to the disclosure requirement 
would be slightly reduced. However, 
there may be a minimal burden 
attributable to the proposed requirement 
that the hospital maintain an attestation 
statement in its records. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement will be limited to those 
physician-owned hospitals that do not 
have at least one referring physician 
who has an ownership or investment 
interest in the hospital or who has an 
immediate family member who has an

ownership or investment interest in the 
hospital. The burden would include the 
time and effort for these hospitals to 
develop, sign, and maintain the 
attestations in their records. We 
estimate that 10 percent, or 
approximately 18, of the estimated 175 
physician-owned hospitals would be 
subject to this requirement. We estimate 
that it would take each of these 
physician-owned hospitals an average of 
1 hour to develop, sign, and maintain 
the attestation in its records. The 
estimated annual burden associated 
with this requirement is 18 hours. 
However, because we have no way of 
knowing for certain the number of 
physician-owned hospitals that do not 
have at least one referring physician 
who has an ownership or investment 
interest in the hospital or who has an 
immediate family member who has an 
ownership or investment interest in the 
hospital, we are requesting public 
comment regarding the accuracy of our 
estimate and the associated burden with 
the attestation requirement. 
Section 489.20(w) requires all 
hospitals, as defined in § 489.24(b), to 
furnish all patients notice, in 
accordance with § 482.13(b)(2), at the 
beginning of their hospital stay or 
outpatient visit if a doctor of medicine 
or a doctor of osteopathy is not present 
in the hospital 24 hours per day, 7 days 
per week. The notice must indicate how 
the hospital will meet the medical needs 
of any inpatient who develops an 
emergency medical condition, as 
defined in § 489.24(b), at a time when 
there is no physician present in the 
hospital. The burden associated with 
this requirement is the time and effort 
necessary for each hospital to develop a 
standard notice to furnish to its patients. 
Whereas this requirement is subject to 
the PRA, the associated burden is 
approved under OMB control number 
0938–1034 with a current expiration 
date of February 28, 2011.

3. Associated Information Collections 
Not Specified in Regulatory Text 
This proposed rule imposes collection 
of information requirements as outlined 
in the regulation text and specified 
above. However, this proposed rule also 
makes reference to several associated 
information collections that are not 
discussed in the regulation text. The 
following is a discussion of these 
collections, which have already 
received OMB approval. 
a. Present on Admission (POA) 
Indicator Reporting 
Section II.F.8 of the preamble of this 
proposed rule discusses the present on 
admission indicator (POA) reporting 
requirements. As stated earlier, POA 
indicator information is necessary to 
identify which conditions were 
acquired during hospitalization for the 
hospital-acquired condition (HAC) 
payment provision and for broader 
public health uses of Medicare data. 
Through Change Request No. 5499 
(released May 11, 2007), CMS issued 
instructions requiring IPPS hospitals to 
submit the POA indicator data for all 
diagnosis codes on Medicare claims. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort 
necessary to place the appropriate POA 
codes on Medicare claims. While the 
requirement is subject to the PRA; the 
associated burden is approved under 
0938–0997 with an expiration date of 
August 31, 2009. 
b. Proposed Add-On Payments for New 
Services and Technologies 
Section II.J. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule discusses proposed add- 
on payments for new services and 
technologies. Specifically, this section 
states that applicants for add-on 
payments for new medical services or 
technologies for FY 2010 must submit a 
formal request. A formal request 
includes a full description of the 
clinical applications of the medical 
service or technology and the results of 
any clinical evaluations demonstrating 
that the new medical service or 
technology represents a substantial 
clinical improvement. In addition, the 
request must contain a significant 
sample of the data to demonstrate that 
the medical service or technology meets 
the high-cost threshold. 
We detailed the burden associated 
with this requirement in a final rule 
published in the Federal Register on 
September 7, 2001 (66 FR 46902). As 
stated in that final rule, we believe the 
associated burden is exempt from the 
PRA as stipulated under 5 CFR 
1320.3(h)(6). Collection of the 
information for this requirement will be 
conducted on an individual case-by- 
case basis. 
c. Reporting of Hospital Quality Data for 
Annual Hospital Payment Update 
As noted in section IV.B. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, the 
RHQDAPU program was originally 
established to implement section 501(b) 
of Pub. L. 108–173, thereby expanding 
our voluntary Hospital Quality 
Initiative. The RHQDAPU program 
originally consisted of a ‘‘starter set’’ of 
10 quality measures. OMB approved the 
collection of data associated with the 
original starter set of quality measures 
under OMB control number 0938–0918, 
with a current expiration date of January 
31, 2010. 
We added additional quality measures 
to the RHQDAPU program and 
submitted the information collection 
request to OMB for approval. This 
expansion of the RHQDAPU measures 
was part of our implementation of 
section 5001(a) of the DRA. Section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(III) of the Act, added

23703 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
by section 5001(a) of the DRA, requires 
that the Secretary expand the ‘‘starter 
set’’ of 10 quality measures that were 
established by the Secretary as of 
November 1, 2003, to include measures 
‘‘that the Secretary determines to be 
appropriate for the measurement of the 
quality of care furnished by hospitals in 
inpatient settings.’’ The burden 
associated with these reporting 
requirements is currently approved 
under OMB control number 0938–1022 
with a current expiration date of 
December 31, 2008. 
However, for FY 2009, we submitted 
to OMB for approval a revised 
information collection request using the 
same OMB control number (0938–1022). 
In the revised request, we proposed to 
add three new RHQDAPU quality 
measures that we adopted for the FY 
2009 RHADAPU program to the PRA 
process. These three measures are as 
follows: 
• Pneumonia 30-day Mortality 
(Medicare patients); 
• SCIP Infection 4: Cardiac Surgery 
Patients with Controlled 6AM 
Postoperative Serum Glucose; and 
• SCIP Infection 6: Surgery Patients 
with Appropriate Hair Removal. 
The revised information collection 
request was announced in the Federal 
Register via an emergency notice on 
January 28, 2008 (73 FR 4868). The 
information collection request is 
currently under review by OMB. Once 
approved, we will submit another 
revision of the information collection 
request to obtain approval for the new 
measures contained in this proposed 
rule. 
Section IV.B.5. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule also discusses the 
requirements for the continuous 
collection of HCAHPS quality data. The 
HCAHPS survey is designed to produce 
comparable data on the patient’s 
perspective on care that allows objective 
and meaningful comparisons between 
hospitals on domains that are important 
to consumers. We also added the 
HCAHPS survey to the PRA process in 
the information collection request 
currently approved under OMB control 
number 0938–1022 with a current 
expiration date of December 31, 2008. 
Section IV.B.9. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule addresses the 
reconsideration and appeal procedures 
for a hospital that we believe did not 
meet the RHQDAPU program 
requirements. If a hospital disagrees 
with our determination, it may submit 
a written request to us requesting that 
we reconsider our decision. The 
hospital’s letter must explain the 
reasons it believes it did meet the 
RHQDAPU program requirements. 
While this is a reporting requirement, 
the burden associated with it is not 
subject to the PRA under 5 CFR 
1320.4(a)(2). The burden associated 
with information collection 
requirements imposed subsequent to an 
administrative action is not subject to 
the PRA. 
d. Occupational Mix Adjustment to the 
FY 2009 Index (Hospital Wage Index 
Occupational Mix Survey) 
Section III. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule details the proposed 
changes to the hospital wage index. 
Specifically, section III.D. addresses the 
proposed occupational mix adjustment 
to the proposed FY 2009 index. While 
the preamble does not contain any new 
information collection requirements, it 
is important to note that there is an 
OMB approved collection associated 
with the hospital wage index. 
Section 304(c) of Pub. L. 106–554 
amended section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the 
Act to require CMS to collect data at 
least once every 3 years on the 
occupational mix of employees for each 
short-term, acute care hospital 
participating in the Medicare program, 
in order to construct an occupational 
mix adjustment to the wage index. We 
collect the data via the occupational mix 
survey. 
The burden associated with this 
information collection request is the 
time and effort required to collect and 
submit the data in the Hospital Wage 
Index Occupational Mix Survey to CMS. 
While this burden is subject to the PRA, 
it is already approved under OMB 
control number 0938–0907, with an 
expiration date of February 28, 2011.

period of disallowance begins at the 
time the financial relationship fails to 
satisfy the requirements of an applicable 
exception and ends no later than— 
(1) Where the noncompliance is 
unrelated to compensation, the date that 
the financial relationship satisfies all of 
the requirements of an applicable

to the payment of compensation that is 
of an amount insufficient to satisfy the 
requirements of an applicable 
exception, the date on which the 
additional required compensation is

(ii) Aggregate hourly wage weighted 
for occupational mix. For redesignations 
effective before fiscal year 1999, the 
aggregate hourly wage for all hospitals 
in the rural county, weighed for 
occupational categories, is at least 90 
percent of the average hourly wage in 
the adjacent urban area. 
(2) Aggregate hourly wage for fiscal 
year 2010 and later fiscal years. With 
respect to redesignations effective for 
fiscal year 2010 and later fiscal years, 
the aggregate average hourly wage for all 
hospitals in the rural county must be 
equal to at least 88 percent of the 
average hourly wage in the adjacent 
urban area.

application of a risk adjustment 
payment model. 
(b) Data collection: Basic rule. Each 
MA organization must submit to CMS 
(in accordance with CMS instructions) 
the data necessary to characterize the 
context and purposes of each item and 
service provided to a Medicare enrollee 
by a provider, supplier, physician, or 
other practitioner. CMS may also collect 
data necessary to characterize the 
functional limitations of enrollees of 
each MA organization. 
(c) Sources and extent of data. (1) To 
the extent required by CMS, risk 
adjustment data must account for the 
following: 
(i) Items and services covered under 
the original Medicare program. 
(ii) Medicare-covered items and 
services for which Medicare is not the 
primary payer. 
(iii) Other additional or supplemental 
benefits that the MA organization may 
provide. 
(2) The data must account separately 
for each provider, supplier, physician,

or other practitioner that would be 
permitted to bill separately under the 
original Medicare program, even if they 
participate jointly in the same service. 
(d) Other data requirements. (1) MA 
organizations must submit data that 
conform to CMS’ requirements for data 
equivalent to Medicare fee-for-service 
data, when appropriate, and to all 
relevant national standards. CMS may 
specify abbreviated formats for data 
submission required of MA 
organizations. 
(2) The data must be submitted 
electronically to the appropriate CMS 
contractor. 
(3) MA organizations must obtain the 
risk adjustment data required by CMS 
from the provider, supplier, physician, 
or other practitioner that furnished the 
item or service. 
(4) MA organizations may include in 
their contracts with providers, 
suppliers, physicians, and other 
practitioners, provisions that require 
submission of complete and accurate 
risk adjustment data as required by 
CMS. These provisions may include 
financial penalties for failure to submit 
complete data. 
(e) Validation of risk adjustment data. 
MA organizations and their providers 
and practitioners will be required to 
submit a sample of medical records for 
the validation of risk adjustment data, as 
required by CMS. There may be 
penalties for submission of false data. 
(f) Use of data. CMS uses the data 
obtained under this section to determine 
the risk adjustment factors used to 
adjust payments, as required under 
§§ 422.304(a) and (c). CMS may also use 
the data for other purposes, including 
updating of risk adjustment models. 
(g) Deadlines for submission of risk 
adjustment data. Risk adjustment 
factors for each payment year are based 
on risk adjustment data submitted for 
items and services furnished during the 
12-month period before the payment 
year that is specified by CMS. As 
determined by CMS, this 12-month 
period may include a 6-month data lag 
that may be changed or eliminated as 
appropriate. CMS may adjust these 
deadlines, as appropriate. 
(1) The annual deadline for risk 
adjustment data submission is the first 
Friday in September for risk adjustment 
data reflecting items and services 
furnished during the 12-month period 
ending the prior June 30, and the first 
Friday in March for data reflecting 
services furnished during the 12-month 
period ending the prior December 31. 
(2) CMS allows a reconciliation 
process to account for late data 
submissions. CMS continues to accept 
risk adjustment data submitted after the 
March deadline until January 31 of the 
year following the payment year. After 
the payment year is completed, CMS 
recalculates the risk factors for affected 
individuals to determine if adjustments 
to payments are necessary. Risk 
adjustment data that are received after 
the annual January 31 late data 
submission deadline will not be 
accepted for the purposes of 
reconciliation.

1395aa(m), 1395cc, 1395ff, and 1395hh). 
18. Section 489.3 is amended by 
revising the definition of ‘‘physician- 
owned hospital’’ to read as follows: 
§ 489.3 Definitions. 
* * * * * 
Physician-owned hospital means any 
participating hospital (as defined in 
§ 489.24) in which a physician, or an 
immediate family member of a 
physician (as defined in § 411.351 of 
this chapter), has an ownership or 
investment interest. The ownership or 
investment interest may be through 
equity, debt, or other means, and 
includes an interest in an entity that 
holds an ownership or investment 
interest in the hospital. This definition 
does not include a hospital with 
physician ownership or investment 
interests that satisfy the requirements at 
§ 411.356(a) or (b) of this chapter.

resources available to the hospital; and 
* * * * * 
(u) Except as provided in paragraph 
(v) of this section, in the case of a 
physician-owned hospital as defined in 
§ 489.3— 
(1) To furnish written notice to all 
patients at the beginning of their 
hospital stay or outpatient visit that the 
hospital is a physician-owned hospital, 
in order to assist the patients in making 
an informed decision regarding their 
care, in accordance with § 482.13(b)(2) 
of this subchapter. The notice should 
disclose, in a manner reasonably 
designed to be understood by all 
patients, the fact that the hospital meets 
the Federal definition of a physician- 
owned hospital specified in § 489.3 and 
that the list of the hospital’s owners or 
investors who are physicians or 
immediate family members of 
physicians (as defined at § 411.351 of 
this chapter) must be provided to the 
patients at the time the request for the 
list is made by or on behalf of the 
patient. For purposes of this paragraph 
(u)(1), the hospital stay or outpatient 
visit begins with the provision of a 
package of information regarding 
scheduled preadmission testing and 
registration for a planned hospital 
admission for inpatient care or 
outpatient service. 
(2) To require all physicians who are 
members of the hospital’s medical staff 
to agree, as a condition of continued 
medical staff membership or admitting 
privileges, to disclose, in writing, to all 
patients they refer to the hospital any 
ownership or investment interest in the 
hospital that is held by themselves or by 
an immediate family member (as 
defined in § 411.351 of this chapter). 
Disclosure must be required at the time 
the referral is made. 
(v) The requirements of paragraph (u) 
of this section do not apply to any 
physician-owned hospital that does not 
have at least one referring physician (as 
defined at § 411.351 of this chapter) 
who has an ownership or investment 
interest in the hospital or who has an 
immediate family member who has an 
ownership or investment interest in the 
hospital, provided that such hospital 
signs an attestation statement to that 
effect and maintain such a notice in its 
records.

(f) Recipient hospital responsibilities. 
A participating hospital that has 
specialized capabilities or facilities 
(including, but not limited to, facilities 
such as burn units, shock-trauma units, 
neonatal intensive case units, or, with 
respect to rural areas, regional referral 
centers (which, for purposes of this 
subpart, mean hospitals meeting the 
requirements of referral centers found at 
§ 412.96 of this chapter)) may not refuse 
to accept from a referring hospital 
within the boundaries of the United 
States an appropriate transfer of an 
individual who requires such 
specialized capabilities or facilities if 
the receiving hospital has the capacity 
to treat the individual. This provision 
applies to— 
(1) Any participating hospital with 
specialized capabilities, regardless of 
whether the hospital has a dedicated 
emergency department; and 
(2) An individual who has been 
admitted under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 
this section and who has not been 
stabilized. 
* * * * * 
(j) Availability of on-call physicians. 
In accordance with the on-call list 
requirements specified in § 489.20(r)(2), 
a hospital must have written policies 
and procedures in place— 
(1) To respond to situations in which 
a particular specialty is not available or 
the on-call physician cannot respond 
because of circumstances beyond the 
physician’s control; and 
(2) To provide that emergency 
services are available to meet the needs 
of individuals with emergency medical 
conditions if a hospital elects to— 
(i) Permit on-call physicians to 
schedule elective surgery during the 
time that they are on call; 
(ii) Permit on-call physicians to have 
simultaneous on-call duties; and 
(iii) Participate in a formal 
community call plan. Notwithstanding 
participation in a community call plan, 
hospitals are still required to perform 
medical screening examinations on 
individuals who present seeking 
treatment and to conduct appropriate 
transfers. The formal community plan 
must include the following elements: 
(A) A clear delineation of on-call 
coverage responsibilities; that is, when 
each hospital participating in the plan is 
responsible for on-call coverage. 
(B) A description of the specific 
geographic area to which the plan 
applies. 
(C) A signature by an appropriate 
representative of each hospital 
participating in the plan. 
(D) Assurances that any local and 
regional EMS system protocol formally 
includes information on community on- 
call arrangements. 
(E) Evidence of engagement of the 
hospitals participating in the 
community call plan in an analysis of 
the specialty on-call needs of the 
community for which the plan is 
effective. 
(F) A statement specifying that even if 
an individual arrives at a hospital that 
is not designated as the on-call hospital, 
that hospital still has an obligation 
under § 489.24 to provide a medical 
screening examination and stabilizing 
treatment within its capability, and that 
hospitals participating in the 
community call plan must abide by the 
regulations under § 489.24 governing 
appropriate transfers. 
(G) An annual assessment of the 
community call plan by the 
participating hospitals. 
21. Section 489.53 is amended by 
revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: 
§ 489.53 Termination by CMS. 
* * * * * 
(c) Termination of agreements with 
physician-owned hospitals. In the case 
of a physician-owned hospital, as 
defined at § 489.3, CMS may terminate 
the provider agreement if the hospital 
failed to comply with the requirements 
of § 489.20(u) or (w).

Addendum—Proposed Schedule of 
Standardized Amounts, Update 
Factors, and Rate-of-Increase 
Percentages Effective With Cost 
Reporting Periods Beginning On or 
After October 1, 2008 
I. Summary and Background 
In this Addendum, we are setting forth the 
methods and data we used to determine the 
proposed prospective payment rates for 
Medicare hospital inpatient operating costs 
and Medicare hospital inpatient capital- 
related costs. We are also setting forth the 
proposed rate-of-increase percentages for 
updating the target amounts for certain 
hospitals and hospital units excluded from 
the IPPS. In general, except for SCHs, MDHs, 
and hospitals located in Puerto Rico, each 
hospital’s payment per discharge under the 
IPPS is based on 100 percent of the Federal 
national rate, also known as the national 
adjusted standardized amount. This amount 
reflects the national average hospital cost per 
case from a base year, updated for inflation. 
SCHs are paid based on whichever of the 
following rates yields the greatest aggregate 
payment: The Federal national rate; the 
updated hospital-specific rate based on FY 
1982 costs per discharge; the updated 
hospital-specific rate based on FY 1987 costs 
per discharge; or the updated hospital- 
specific rate based on FY 1996 costs per 
discharge. 
Under section 1886(d)(5)(G) of the Act, 
MDHs historically have been paid based on 
the Federal national rate or, if higher, the 
Federal national rate plus 50 percent of the 
difference between the Federal national rate 
and the updated hospital-specific rate based 
on FY 1982 or FY 1987 costs per discharge, 
whichever was higher. (MDHs did not have 
the option to use their FY 1996 hospital- 
specific rate.) However, section 5003(a)(1) of 
Pub. L. 109–171 extended and modified the 
MDH special payment provision that was 
previously set to expire on October 1, 2006, 
to include discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 2006, but before October 1, 2011. 
Under section 5003(b) of Pub. L. 109–171, if 
the change results in an increase to an MDH’s 
target amount, an MDH must rebase its 
hospital-specific rates to its FY 2002 cost 
report. Section 5003(c) of Pub. L. 109–171 
further required that MDHs be paid based on 
the Federal national rate or, if higher, the 
Federal national rate plus 75 percent of the 
difference between the Federal national rate 
and the updated hospital-specific rate. 
Further, based on the provisions of section 
5003(d) of Pub. L. 109–171, MDHs are no 
longer subject to the 12-percent cap on their 
DSH payment adjustment factor.

23708 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
For hospitals located in Puerto Rico, the 
payment per discharge is based on the sum 
of 25 percent of an updated Puerto Rico- 
specific rate based on average costs per case 
of Puerto Rico hospitals for the base year and 
75 percent of the Federal national rate. (We 
refer readers to section II.D.3. of this 
Addendum for a complete description.) 
As discussed below in section II. of this 
Addendum, we are proposing to make 
changes in the determination of the 
prospective payment rates for Medicare 
inpatient operating costs for FY 2009. In 
section III. of this Addendum, we discuss our 
proposed policy changes for determining the 
prospective payment rates for Medicare 
inpatient capital-related costs for FY 2009. 
Section IV. of this Addendum sets forth our 
proposed changes for determining the rate-of- 
increase limits for certain hospitals excluded 
from the IPPS for FY 2009. The tables to 
which we refer in the preamble of this 
proposed rule are presented in section V. of 
this Addendum of this proposed rule. 
II. Proposed Changes to Prospective Payment 
Rates for Hospital Inpatient Operating Costs 
for FY 2009 
The basic methodology for determining 
prospective payment rates for hospital 
inpatient operating costs for FY 2005 and 
subsequent fiscal years is set forth at 
§ 412.64. The basic methodology for 
determining the prospective payment rates 
for hospital inpatient operating costs for 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico for FY 2005 
and subsequent fiscal years is set forth at 
§§ 412.211 and 412.212. Below we discuss 
the factors used for determining the 
prospective payment rates. 
In summary, the proposed standardized 
amounts set forth in Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C, 
of section VI. of this Addendum reflect— 
• Equalization of the standardized 
amounts for urban and other areas at the 
level computed for large urban hospitals 
during FY 2004 and onward, as provided for 
under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act, 
updated by the applicable percentage 
increase required under sections 
1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(XX) and 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of 
the Act. 
• The labor-related share that is applied to 
the standardized amounts and Puerto Rico- 
specific standardized amounts to give the 
hospital the highest payment, as provided for 
under sections 1886(d)(3)(E), and 
1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act. 
• Proposed updates of 3.0 percent for all 
areas (that is, the estimated full market basket 
percentage increase of 3.0 percent), as 
required by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(XX) of 
the Act, as amended by section 5001(a)(1) of 
Pub. L. 109–171, and reflecting the 
requirements of section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of 
the Act, as added by section 5001(a)(3) of 
Pub. L. 109–171, to reduce the applicable 
percentage increase by 2.0 percentage points 
for a hospital that fails to submit data, in a 
form and manner specified by the Secretary, 
relating to the quality of inpatient care 
furnished by the hospital. 
• A proposed update of 3.0 percent to the 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount 
(that is, the full estimated rate-of-increase in 
the hospital market basket for IPPS 
hospitals), as provided for under 
§ 412.211(c), which states that we update the 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount 
using the percentage increase specified in 
§ 412.64(d)(1), or the percentage increase in 
the market basket index for prospective 
payment hospitals for all areas. 
• An adjustment to the standardized 
amount to ensure budget neutrality for DRG 
recalibration and reclassification, as provided 
for under section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act. 
• An adjustment to ensure the wage index 
update and changes are budget neutral, as 
provided for under section 1886(d)(3)(E) of 
the Act. 
• An adjustment to ensure the effects of 
geographic reclassification are budget 
neutral, as provided for in section 
1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act, by removing the FY 
2008 budget neutrality factor and applying a 
revised factor. 
• An adjustment to remove the FY 2008 
outlier offset and apply an offset for FY 2009. 
• An adjustment to ensure the effects of 
the rural community hospital demonstration 
required under section 410A of Pub. L. 108– 
173 are budget neutral, as required under 
section 410A(c)(2) of Pub. L. 108–173. 
• An adjustment to eliminate the effect of 
coding or classification changes that do not 
reflect real changes in case-mix, as discussed 
below and in section II.D. of the preamble to 
this proposed rule. 
We note that, beginning in FY 2008, we 
applied the budget neutrality adjustment for 
the rural floor to the hospital wage indices 
rather than the standardized amount. For FY 
2009, we are proposing to continue to apply 
the rural floor budget neutrality adjustment 
to hospital wage indices rather than the 
standardized amount. In addition, instead of 
applying the budget neutrality adjustment for 
the imputed rural floor adopted under 
section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act to the 
standardized amounts, beginning with FY 
2009, we are proposing to apply the imputed 
rural floor budget neutrality adjustment to 
the wage indices. Beginning in FY 2009, we 
are also proposing to apply the budget 
neutrality adjustments for the rural floor and 
imputed rural floor at the State level rather 
than the national level. For a complete 
discussion of the budget neutrality proposals 
concerning the rural floor and the imputed 
rural floor, including the proposal for a 
within-State budget neutrality adjustment, 
we refer readers to section III.B.2.b. of the 
preamble to this proposed rule.

amount is based on per discharge averages of 
adjusted hospital costs from a base period 
(section 1886(d)(2)(A) of the Act) or, for 
Puerto Rico, adjusted target amounts from a 
base period (section 1886(d)(9)(B)(i) of the 
Act), updated and otherwise adjusted in 
accordance with the provisions of section 
1886(d) of the Act. The September 1, 1983 
interim final rule (48 FR 39763) contained a 
detailed explanation of how base-year cost 
data (from cost reporting periods ending 
during FY 1981) were established for urban 
and rural hospitals in the initial development 
of standardized amounts for the IPPS. The 
September 1, 1987 final rule (52 FR 33043 
and 33066) contains a detailed explanation of 
how the target amounts were determined and 
how they are used in computing the Puerto 
Rico rates. 
Sections 1886(d)(2)(B) and (d)(2)(C) of the 
Act require us to update base-year per 
discharge costs for FY 1984 and then 
standardize the cost data in order to remove 
the effects of certain sources of cost 
variations among hospitals. These effects 
include case-mix, differences in area wage 
levels, cost-of-living adjustments for Alaska 
and Hawaii, indirect medical education 
costs, and costs to hospitals serving a 
disproportionate share of low-income 
patients. 
In accordance with section 1886(d)(3)(E) of 
the Act, the Secretary estimates, from time- 
to-time, the proportion of hospitals’ costs that 
are attributable to wages and wage-related 
costs. In general, the standardized amount is 
divided into labor-related and nonlabor- 
related amounts; only the proportion 
considered to be the labor-related amount is 
adjusted by the wage index. Section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that 62 
percent of the standardized amount be 
adjusted by the wage index, unless doing so 
would result in lower payments to a hospital 
than would otherwise be made. (Section 
1886(d)(9)(C)(iv)(II) of the Act extends this 
provision to the labor-related share for 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico.) 
For FY 2009, we are not proposing to 
change the national and Puerto Rico-specific 
labor-related and nonlabor-related shares 
from the percentages established for FY 2008. 
Therefore, the labor-related share continues 
to be 69.7 percent for the national 
standardized amounts and 58.7 percent for 
the Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount. Consistent with section 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act, we are applying the 
wage index to a labor-related share of 62 
percent for all non-Puerto Rico hospitals 
whose wage indexes are less than or equal to 
1.0000. For all non-Puerto Rico hospitals 
whose wage indices are greater than 1.0000, 
we are applying the wage index to a labor- 
related share of 69.7 percent of the national 
standardized amount. For hospitals located 
in Puerto Rico, we are applying a labor- 
related share of 58.7 percent if its Puerto 
Rico-specific wage index is less than or equal 
to 1.0000. For hospitals located in Puerto 
Rico whose Puerto Rico-specific wage index 
values are greater than 1.0000, we are 
applying a labor share of 62 percent. 
The standardized amounts for operating 
costs appear in Table 1A, 1B, and 1C of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule. 
2. Computing the Average Standardized 
Amount 
Section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iv)(II) of the Act 
requires that, beginning with FY–2004 and 
thereafter, an equal standardized amount be 
computed for all hospitals at the level 
computed for large urban hospitals during FY 
2003, updated by the applicable percentage 
update. Section 1886(d)(9)(A)(ii)(II) of the 
Act equalizes the Puerto Rico-specific urban 
and rural area rates. Accordingly, we are 
calculating FY 2009 national and Puerto Rico

standardized amounts irrespective of 
whether a hospital is located in an urban or 
rural location. 
3. Updating the Average Standardized 
Amount 
In accordance with section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(iv)(II) of the Act, we are 
updating the equalized standardized amount 
for FY 2008 by the full estimated market 
basket percentage increase for hospitals in all 
areas, as specified in section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(XX) of the Act, as amended 
by section 5001(a)(1) of Pub. L. 109–171. The 
percentage change in the market basket 
reflects the average change in the price of 
goods and services purchased by hospitals to 
furnish inpatient care. The most recent 
forecast of the hospital market basket 
increase for FY 2009 is 3.0 percent. Thus, for 
FY 2009, the proposed update to the average 
standardized amount is 3.0 percent for 
hospitals in all areas. The estimated market 
basket increase of 3.0 percent is based on the 
2008 first quarter forecast of the hospital 
market basket increase (as discussed in 
Appendix B of this proposed rule). 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act specifies 
the mechanism to be used to update the 
standardized amount for payment for 
inpatient hospital operating costs. Section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act, as added by 
section 5001(a)(3) of Pub. L. 109–171, 
provides for a reduction of 2.0 percentage 
points from the update percentage increase 
(also known as the market basket update) for 
FY 2007 and each subsequent fiscal year for 
any ‘‘subsection (d) hospital’’ that does not 
submit quality data, as discussed in section 
IV.A. of the preamble of this proposed rule. 
The standardized amounts in Tables 1A 
through 1C of section V. of the Addendum 
to this proposed rule reflect these differential 
amounts. 
Section 412.211(c) states that we update 
the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount 
using the percentage increase specified in 
§ 412.64(d)(1) or the percentage increase in 
the market basket index for prospective 
payment hospitals for all areas. We are 
proposing to apply the full rate-of-increase in 
the hospital market basket for IPPS hospitals 
to the Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount. Therefore, the proposed update to 
the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount 
is estimated to be 3.0 percent. 
Although the update factors for FY 2009 
are set by law, we are required by section 
1886(e)(4) of the Act to recommend, taking 
into account MedPAC’s recommendations, 
appropriate update factors for FY 2009 for 
both IPPS hospitals and hospitals and 
hospital units excluded from the IPPS. Our 
recommendation on the update factors 
(which is required by sections 1886(e)(4)(A) 
and (e)(5)(A) of the Act) is set forth in 
Appendix B of this proposed rule. 
4. Other Adjustments to the Average 
Standardized Amount 
As in the past, we are adjusting the FY 
2009 standardized amount to remove the 
effects of the FY 2008 geographic 
reclassifications and outlier payments before 
applying the FY 2009 updates. We then 
applied budget neutrality offsets for outliers 
and geographic reclassifications to the 
standardized amount based on proposed FY 
2009 payment policies. 
We do not remove the prior year’s budget 
neutrality adjustments for reclassification 
and recalibration of the DRG weights and for 
updated wage data because, in accordance 
with sections 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) and 
1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act, estimated aggregate 
payments after updates in the DRG relative 
weights and wage index should equal 
estimated aggregate payments prior to the 
changes. If we removed the prior year’s 
adjustment, we would not have satisfied 
these conditions. 
Budget neutrality is determined by 
comparing aggregate IPPS payments before 
and after making changes that are required to 
be budget neutral (for example, changes to 
DRG classifications, recalibration of the DRG 
relative weights, updates to the wage index, 
and different geographic reclassifications). 
We included outlier payments in the 
simulations because they may be affected by 
changes in these parameters. 
We are also proposing to adjust the 
standardized amount this year by an 
estimated amount to ensure that aggregate 
IPPS payments did not exceed the amount of 
payments that would have been made in the 
absence of the rural community hospital 
demonstration program, as required under 
section 410A of Pub. L. 108–173. This 
demonstration is required to be budget 
neutral under section 410A(c)(2) of Pub. L. 
108–173. For FY 2009, we are proposing to 
no longer apply budget neutrality for the 
imputed rural floor to the standardized 
amount, and to apply it instead to the wage 
index, as discussed in section of II.B.2. of the 
preamble to this proposed rule. For FY 2009, 
we are also proposing an adjustment to 
eliminate the effect of coding or classification 
changes that did not reflect real changes in 
case-mix using the Secretary’s authority 
under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act, by 
the percentage specified in section 7 of Pub. 
L. 110–90. 
a. Proposed Recalibration of DRG Weights 
and Updated Wage Index—Budget Neutrality 
Adjustment 
Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act 
specifies that, beginning in FY 1991, the 
annual DRG reclassification and recalibration 
of the relative weights must be made in a 
manner that ensures that aggregate payments 
to hospitals are not affected. As discussed in 
section II. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule, we normalized the recalibrated DRG 
weights by an adjustment factor so that the 
average case weight after recalibration is 
equal to the average case weight prior to 
recalibration. However, equating the average 
case weight after recalibration to the average 
case weight before recalibration does not 
necessarily achieve budget neutrality with 
respect to aggregate payments to hospitals 
because payments to hospitals are affected by 
factors other than average case weight. 
Therefore, as we have done in past years, we 
made a budget neutrality adjustment to 
ensure that the requirement of section 
1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act is met. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires us 
to update the hospital wage index on an 
annual basis beginning October 1, 1993. This 
provision also requires us to make any 
updates or adjustments to the wage index in 
a manner that ensures that aggregate 
payments to hospitals are not affected by the 
change in the wage index. Consistent with 
current policy, for FY 2009, we are adjusting 
100 percent of the wage index factor for 
occupational mix. We describe the 
occupational mix adjustment in section III.D. 
of the preamble to this proposed rule. 
To comply with the requirement that DRG 
reclassification and recalibration of the 
relative weights and the updated wage index 
be budget neutral, we used FY 2007 
discharge data to simulate payments and 
compared aggregate payments using the FY 
2008 relative weights and wage indices to 
aggregate payments using the proposed FY 
2009 relative weights and wage indices. The 
same methodology was used for the FY 2008 
budget neutrality adjustment. Based on this 
comparison, we computed a proposed budget 
neutrality adjustment factor equal to 
0.999525 to be applied to the national 
standardized amount. We are also adjusting 
the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount 
for the effect of DRG reclassification and 
recalibration. We computed a proposed 
budget neutrality adjustment factor of 
0.998700 to be applied to the Puerto Rico- 
specific standardized amount. These 
proposed budget neutrality adjustment 
factors are applied to the standardized 
amounts for FY 2008 without removing the 
prior year’s budget neutrality adjustments. In 
addition, as discussed in section IV. of this 
Addendum, we are applying the same 
proposed DRG reclassification and 
recalibration budget neutrality factor of 
0.998700 to the hospital-specific rates that 
would be effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2008. 
b. Reclassified Hospitals—Budget Neutrality 
Adjustment 
Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act provides 
that, effective with discharges occurring on 
or after October 1, 1988, certain rural 
hospitals are deemed urban. In addition, 
section 1886(d)(10) of the Act provides for 
the reclassification of hospitals based on 
determinations by the MGCRB. Under section 
1886(d)(10) of the Act, a hospital may be 
reclassified for purposes of the wage index. 
Under section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act, the 
Secretary is required to adjust the 
standardized amount to ensure that aggregate 
payments under the IPPS after 
implementation of the provisions of sections 
1886(d)(8)(B) and (C) and 1886(d)(10) of the 
Act are equal to the aggregate prospective 
payments that would have been made absent 
these provisions. We note that the wage 
index adjustments provided under section 
1886(d)(13) of the Act are not budget neutral. 
Section 1886(d)(13)(H) of the Act provides 
that any increase in a wage index under 
section 1886(d)(13) shall not be taken into 
account ‘‘in applying any budget neutrality 
adjustment with respect to such index’’ 
under section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act. To 
calculate the proposed budget neutrality 
factor for FY 2009, we used FY 2007 
discharge data to simulate payments, and 
compared total IPPS payments prior to any 
reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(8)(B) 
and (C) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act to total 
IPPS payments after such reclassifications.

23710 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Based on these simulations, we calculated a 
proposed adjustment factor of 0.992333 to 
ensure that the effects of these provisions are 
budget neutral, consistent with the statute. 
The proposed adjustment factor is applied 
to the standardized amount after removing 
the effects of the FY 2008 budget neutrality 
adjustment factor. We note that the FY 2009 
adjustment reflects FY 2009 wage index 
reclassifications approved by the MGCRB or 
the Administrator. (Section 1886(d)(10)(D)(v) 
of the Act makes wage index reclassifications 
effective for 3 years. Therefore, the FY 2009 
geographic reclassification could either be 
the continuation of a 3-year reclassification 
that began in FY 2007 or FY 2008, or a new 
one beginning in FY 2009.) 
c. Case-Mix Budget Neutrality Adjustment 
As stated earlier, beginning in FY 2008, we 
adopted the new MS–DRG patient 
classification system for the IPPS to better 
recognize severity of illness in Medicare 
payment rates. In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period, we indicated that we 
believe the adoption of the MS–DRGs had the 
potential to lead to increases in aggregate 
payments without a corresponding increase 
in actual patient severity of illness due to the 
incentives for improved documentation and 
coding. In that final rule, using the 
Secretary’s authority under section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act to maintain 
budget neutrality by adjusting the national 
standardized amounts to eliminate the effect 
of changes in coding or classification that do 
not reflect real change in case-mix, we 
established prospective documentation and 
coding adjustments of ¥1.2 percent for FY 
2008, ¥1.8 percent for FY 2009, and ¥1.8 
percent for FY 2010. On September 29, 2007, 
Pub. L. 110–90 was enacted. Section 7 of 
Pub. L. 110–90 included a provision that 
reduces the documentation and coding 
adjustment for the MS–DRG system that we 
adopted in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period to ¥0.6 percent for FY 2008 
and ¥0.9 percent for FY 2009. To comply 
with the provision of section 7 of Pub. L. 
110–90, in a final rule that appeared in the 
Federal Register on November 27, 2007 (72 
FR 66886), we changed the IPPS 
documentation and coding adjustment for FY 
2008 to ¥0.6 percent, and revised the FY 
2008 national standardized amounts (as well 
as other payment factors and thresholds) 
accordingly, with these revisions effective 
October 1, 2007. For FY 2009, section 7 of 
Pub. L. 110–90 requires a documentation and 
coding adjustment of ¥0.9 percent instead of 
the ¥1.8 percent adjustment specified in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period. As required by statute, we are 
applying a documentation and coding 
adjustment of ¥0.9 percent to the FY 2009 
IPPS national standardized amounts. The 
documentation and coding adjustments 
established in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period are cumulative. As a 
result, the ¥0.9 percent documentation and 
coding adjustment in FY 2009 is in addition 
to the ¥0.6 percent adjustment in FY 2008, 
yielding a combined effect of ¥1.5 percent. 
As discussed in more detail in section II.D. 
of the preamble of this proposed rule, in 
calculating the FY 2008 Puerto Rico 
standardized amount, we made an 
inadvertent error and applied the 
documentation and coding adjustment 
established using our authority in section 
1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act (which only 
applies to the national standardized 
amounts) to the Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount. We are currently in the 
process of developing a Federal Register 
notice to remove the ¥0.6 percent 
documentation and coding adjustment from 
the FY 2008 Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount retroactive to October 
1, 2007. As discussed in section II.D. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, we are not 
applying the documentation and coding 
adjustment to the Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount for FY 2009, but we 
may consider doing so for the FY 2010 Puerto 
Rico-specific standardized amount in the FY 
2010 rulemaking. In calculating the FY 2009 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount for 
this proposed rule, we have removed the 
¥0.6 percent documentation and coding 
adjustment that was inadvertently applied to 
the FY 2008 Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount. 
d. Outliers 
Section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act provides 
for payments in addition to the basic 
prospective payments for ‘‘outlier’’ cases 
involving extraordinarily high costs. To 
qualify for outlier payments, a case must 
have costs greater than the sum of the 
prospective payment rate for the DRG, any 
IME and DSH payments, any new technology 
add-on payments, and the ‘‘outlier 
threshold’’ or ‘‘fixed loss’’ amount (a dollar 
amount by which the costs of a case must 
exceed payments in order to qualify for an 
outlier payment). We refer to the sum of the 
prospective payment rate for the DRG, any 
IME and DSH payments, any new technology 
add-on payments, and the outlier threshold 
as the outlier ‘‘fixed-loss cost threshold.’’ To 
determine whether the costs of a case exceed 
the fixed-loss cost threshold, a hospital’s CCR 
is applied to the total covered charges for the 
case to convert the charges to estimated costs. 
Payments for eligible cases are then made 
based on a marginal cost factor, which is a 
percentage of the estimated costs above the 
fixed-loss cost threshold. The marginal cost 
factor for FY 2009 is 80 percent, the same 
marginal cost factor we have used since FY 
1995 (59 FR 45367). 
In accordance with section 
1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act, outlier payments 
for any year are projected to be not less than 
5 percent nor more than 6 percent of total 
operating DRG payments plus outlier 
payments. Section 1886(d)(3)(B) of the Act 
requires the Secretary to reduce the average 
standardized amount by a factor to account 
for the estimated proportion of total DRG 
payments made to outlier cases. Similarly, 
section 1886(d)(9)(B)(iv) of the Act requires 
the Secretary to reduce the average 
standardized amount applicable to hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico to account for the 
estimated proportion of total DRG payments 
made to outlier cases. More information on 
outlier payments may be found on the CMS 
Web site at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
AcuteInpatientPPS/ 
04_outlier.asp#TopOfPage. 
(1) Proposed FY 2009 Outlier Fixed-Loss Cost 
Threshold 
For FY 2009, we are proposing to use the 
same methodology used for FY 2008 (72 FR 
47417) to calculate the outlier threshold. 
Similar to the methodology used in the FY 
2008 final rule with comment period, for FY 
2009, we are applying an adjustment factor 
to the CCRs to account for cost and charge 
inflation (as explained below). As we have 
done in the past, to calculate the proposed 
FY 2009 outlier threshold, we simulated 
payments by applying FY 2009 rates and 
policies using cases from the FY 2007 
MedPAR files. Therefore, in order to 
determine the proposed FY 2009 outlier 
threshold, we inflate the charges on the 
MedPAR claims by 2 years, from FY 2007 to 
FY 2009. 
We are proposing to continue using a 
refined methodology that takes into account 
the lower inflation in hospital charges that 
are occurring as a result of the outlier final 
rule (68 FR 34494), which changed our 
methodology for determining outlier 
payments by implementing the use of more 
current CCRs. Our refined methodology uses 
more recent data that reflect the rate-of- 
change in hospital charges under the new 
outlier policy. 
Using the most recent data available, we 
calculated the 1-year average annualized rate- 
of-change in charges-per-case from the last 
quarter of FY 2006 in combination with the 
first quarter of FY 2007 (July 1, 2006 through 
December 31, 2006) to the last quarter of FY 
2007 in combination with the first quarter of 
FY 2008 (July 1, 2007 through December 31, 
2007). This rate of change was 5.84 percent 
(1.0585) or 12.03 percent (1.1204) over 2 
years. 
As we have done in the past, we are 
proposing to establish the proposed FY 2009 
outlier threshold using hospital CCRs from 
the December 2007 update to the Provider- 
Specific File (PSF)—the most recent available 
data at the time of this proposed rule. This 
file includes CCRs that reflected 
implementation of the changes to the policy 
for determining the applicable CCRs that 
became effective August 8, 2003 (68 FR 
34494). 
As discussed in the FY 2007 final rule (71 
FR 48150), we worked with the Office of 
Actuary to derive the methodology described 
below to develop the CCR adjustment factor. 
For FY 2009, we are proposing to use the 
same methodology to calculate the CCR 
adjustment by using the FY 2007 operating 
cost per discharge increase in combination 
with the actual FY 2007 operating market 
basket increase determined by Global Insight, 
Inc., as well as the charge inflation factor 
described above to estimate the adjustment to 
the CCRs. (We note that the FY 2007 actual 
(otherwise referred to as ‘‘final’’) operating 
market basket increase reflects historical data 
whereas the published FY 2007 operating 
market basket update factor was based on 
Global Insight, Inc.’s 2006 second quarter 
forecast with historical data through the first 
quarter of 2007.) By using the operating 
market basket rate-of-increase and the 
increase in the average cost per discharge 
from hospital cost reports, we are using two 
different measures of cost inflation. For FY

23711 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
2009, we determined the adjustment by 
taking the percentage increase in the 
operating costs per discharge from FY 2005 
to FY 2006 (1.0538) from the cost report and 
dividing it by the final operating market 
basket increase from FY 2006 (1.0420). We 
repeated this calculation for 2 prior years to 
determine the 3-year average of the rate of 
adjusted change in costs between the 
operating market basket rate-of-increase and 
the increase in cost per case from the cost 
report (FY 2003 to FY 2004 percentage 
increase of operating costs per discharge of 
1.0629 divided by FY 2004 final operating 
market basket increase of 1.0400, FY 2004 to 
FY 2005 percentage increase of operating 
costs per discharge of 1.0565 divided by FY 
2005 final operating market basket increase 
of 1.0430). For FY 2009, we averaged the 
differentials calculated for FY 2004, FY 2005, 
and FY 2006, which resulted in a mean ratio 
of 1.0154. We multiplied the 3-year average 
of 1.0154 by the 2007 operating market 
basket percentage increase of 1.0340, which 
resulted in an operating cost inflation factor 
of 5.0 percent or 1.05. We then divided the 
operating cost inflation factor by the 1-year 
average change in charges (1.058474) and 
applied an adjustment factor of 0.9920 to the 
operating CCRs from the PSF. 
As stated in the FY 2008 final rule with 
comment period, we continue to believe it is 
appropriate to apply only a 1-year adjustment 
factor to the CCRs. On average, it takes 
approximately 9 months for fiscal 
intermediaries (or, if applicable, the MAC) to 
tentatively settle a cost report from the fiscal 
year end of a hospital’s cost reporting period. 
The average ‘‘age’’ of hospitals’ CCRs from 
the time the fiscal intermediary or the MAC 
inserts the CCR in the PSF until the 
beginning of FY 2008 is approximately 1 
year. Therefore, as stated above, we believe 
a 1-year adjustment factor to the CCRs is 
appropriate. 
We used the same methodology for the 
capital CCRs and determined the adjustment 
by taking the percentage increase in the 
capital costs per discharge from FY 2005 to 
FY 2006 (1.0462) from the cost report and 
dividing it by the final capital market basket 
increase from FY 2006 (1.0090). We repeated 
this calculation for 2 prior years to determine 
the 3-year average of the rate of adjusted 
change in costs between the capital market 
basket rate-of-increase and the increase in 
cost per case from the cost report (FY 2003 
to FY 2004 percentage increase of capital 
costs per discharge of 1.0315 divided by FY 
2004 final capital market basket increase of 
1.0050, FY 2004 to FY 2005 percentage 
increase of capital costs per discharge of 
1.0311 divided by FY 2005 final capital 
market basket increase of 1.0060). For FY 
2009, we averaged the differentials calculated 
for FY 2004, FY 2005, and FY 2006, which 
resulted in a mean ratio of 1.0294. We 
multiplied the 3-year average of 1.0294 by 
the 2007 capital market basket percentage 
increase of 1.0120, which resulted in a 
capital cost inflation factor of 4.17 percent or 
1.0417. We then divided the capital cost 
inflation factor by the 1-year average change 
in charges (1.058474) and applied an 
adjustment factor of 0.9842 to the capital 
CCRs from the PSF. We are using the same 
charge inflation factor for the capital CCRs 
that was used for the operating CCRs. The 
charge inflation factor is based on the overall 
billed charges. Therefore, we believe it is 
appropriate to apply the charge factor to both 
the operating and capital CCRs. 
For purposes of estimating the proposed 
outlier threshold for FY 2009, we assume 3.0 
percent case-mix growth in FY 2009 
compared with our FY 2007 claims data (that 
is, a 1.2 percent increase in FY 2008 and an 
additional 1.8 percent increase in FY 2009). 
The 3 percent case-mix growth was projected 
by the Office of the Actuary as the amount 
case-mix is expected to increase in response 
to adoption of the MS–DRGs as a result of 
improvements in documentation and coding 
that do not reflect real changes in patient 
severity of illness. It is necessary to take the 
3 percent expected case-mix growth into 
account when calculating the outlier 
threshold that results in outlier payments 
being 5.1 percent of total payments for FY 
2009. If we did not take this 3 percent 
projected case-mix growth into account, our 
estimate of total payments would be too low, 
and as a result, our estimate of the outlier 
threshold would be too high. While we 
assume 3 percent case-mix growth for all 
hospitals in our outlier threshold 
calculations, the FY 2009 national 
standardized amounts used to calculate the 
outlier threshold reflect the statutorily 
mandated documentation and coding 
adjustment of ¥0.9 percent for FY 2009, on 
top of the ¥0.6 percent adjustment for FY 
2008. 
Using this methodology, we are proposing 
an outlier fixed-loss cost threshold for FY 
2009 equal to the prospective payment rate 
for the DRG, plus any IME and DSH 
payments, and any add-on payments for new 
technology, plus $21,025. 
As we did in establishing the FY 2008 
outlier threshold (72 FR 47417), in our 
projection of FY 2009 outlier payments, we 
are not making any adjustments for the 
possibility that hospitals’ CCRs and outlier 
payments may be reconciled upon cost report 
settlement. We continue to believe that, due 
to the policy implemented in the outlier final 
rule (68 FR 34494, June 9, 2003), CCRs will 
no longer fluctuate significantly and, 
therefore, few hospitals will actually have 
these ratios reconciled upon cost report 
settlement. In addition, it is difficult to 
predict the specific hospitals that will have 
CCRs and outlier payments reconciled in any 
given year. We also noted that reconciliation 
occurs because hospitals’ actual CCRs for the 
cost reporting period are different than the 
interim CCRs used to calculate outlier 
payments when a bill is processed. Our 
simulations assume that CCRs accurately 
measure hospital costs based on information 
available to us at the time we set the outlier 
threshold. For these reasons, we are not 
making any assumptions about the effects of 
reconciliation on the outlier threshold 
calculation. 
We also note that there are some factors 
that contributed to a proposed lower fixed 
loss outlier threshold for FY 2009 compared 
to FY 2008. First, the case-weighted national 
average operating CCR declined by 
approximately an additional 1 percentage 
point from the March 2007 update (used to 
calculate the FY 2008 outlier threshold) to 
the December 2007 update of the PSF (used 
to calculate the proposed FY 2009 outlier 
threshold). In addition, as discussed in 
sections II.C. and II.H. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we began a 2-year phase-in of 
the MS–DRGs in FY 2008, with the DRG 
relative weights based on a 50 percent blend 
of the CMS DRGs and MS–DRGs in FY 2008 
and based on 100 percent of the MS–DRGs 
beginning in FY 2009. Better recognition of 
severity of illnesses with the MS–DRGs 
means that nonoutlier payments will 
compensate hospitals for the higher costs of 
some cases that previously received outlier 
payments. As cases are paid more accurately, 
in order to meet the 5.1 percent target, we 
need to decrease the fixed-loss outlier 
threshold so that more cases qualify for 
outlier payments. In addition, as noted 
previously, in our modeling of the outlier 
threshold, we included a 3-percent 
adjustment for expected case-mix growth 
between FY 2007 and FY 2009. Together, we 
believe that the above factors cumulatively 
contributed to a lower proposed fixed-loss 
outlier threshold in FY 2009 compared to FY 
2008. 
(2) Other Proposed Changes Concerning 
Outliers 
As stated in the FY 1994 IPPS final rule (58 
FR 46348), we establish an outlier threshold 
that is applicable to both hospital inpatient 
operating costs and hospital inpatient 
capital-related costs. When we modeled the 
combined operating and capital outlier 
payments, we found that using a common 
threshold resulted in a lower percentage of 
outlier payments for capital-related costs 
than for operating costs. We are projecting 
that the proposed thresholds for FY 2009 will 
result in outlier payments that will equal 5.1 
percent of operating DRG payments and 5.73 
percent of capital payments based on the 
Federal rate. 
In accordance with section 1886(d)(3)(B) of 
the Act, we are reducing the FY 2009 
standardized amount by the same percentage 
to account for the projected proportion of 
payments paid as outliers. 
The outlier adjustment factors that are 
applied to the standardized amount for the 
proposed FY 2009 outlier threshold are as 
follows: 
Operating 
standardized 
amounts 
Capital 
federal rate 
National ......... 0.948928 0.942711 
Puerto Rico ... 0.955988 0.925627 
Consistent with current policy, we are 
applying the outlier adjustment factors to FY 
2009 rates after removing the effects of the 
FY 2008 outlier adjustment factors on the 
standardized amount. 
To determine whether a case qualifies for 
outlier payments, we apply hospital-specific 
CCRs to the total covered charges for the 
case. Estimated operating and capital costs 
for the case are calculated separately by 
applying separate operating and capital 
CCRs. These costs are then combined and

27 These figures represent 3.0 standard deviations 
from the mean of the log distribution of CCRs for 
all hospitals. 
compared with the outlier fixed-loss cost 
threshold. 
The outlier final rule (68 FR 34494) 
eliminated the application of the statewide 
average CCRs for hospitals with CCRs that 
fell below 3 standard deviations from the 
national mean CCR. However, for those 
hospitals for which the fiscal intermediary or 
MAC computes operating CCRs greater than 
1.213 or capital CCRs greater than 0.148, or 
hospitals for whom the fiscal intermediary or 
MAC is unable to calculate a CCR (as 
described at § 412.84(i)(3) of our regulations), 
we still use statewide average CCRs to 
determine whether a hospital qualifies for 
outlier payments.27 Table 8A in this 
Addendum contains the statewide average 
operating CCRs for urban hospitals and for 
rural hospitals for which the fiscal 
intermediary or MAC is unable to compute 
a hospital-specific CCR within the above 
range. Effective for discharges occurring on 
or after October 1, 2008, these statewide 
average ratios would replace the ratios 
published in the IPPS final rule for FY 2008 
(72 FR 48126–48127). Table 8B in this 
Addendum contains the comparable 
statewide average capital CCRs. Again, the 
CCRs in Tables 8A and 8B would be used 
during FY 2009 when hospital-specific CCRs 
based on the latest settled cost report are 
either not available or are outside the range 
noted above. For an explanation of Table 8C, 
we refer readers to section V. of this 
Addendum. 
We finally note that we published a 
manual update (Change Request 3966) to our 
outlier policy on October 12, 2005, which 
updated Chapter 3, Section 20.1.2 of the 
Medicare Claims Processing Manual. The 
manual update covered an array of topics, 
including CCRs, reconciliation, and the time 
value of money. We encourage hospitals that 
are assigned the statewide average operating 
and/or capital CCRs to work with their fiscal 
intermediaries (or MAC if applicable) on a 
possible alternative operating and/or capital 
CCR as explained in Change Request 3966. 
Use of an alternative CCR developed by the 
hospital in conjunction with the fiscal 
intermediary or MAC can avoid possible 
overpayments or underpayments at cost 
report settlement, thus ensuring better 
accuracy when making outlier payments and 
negating the need for outlier reconciliation. 
We also note that a hospital may request an 
alternative operating or capital CCR ratio at 
any time as long as the guidelines of Change 
Request 3966 are followed. To download and 
view the manual instructions on outlier and 
cost-to-charge ratios, visit the Web site: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/ 
downloads/clm104c03.pdf. 
(3) FY 2007 and FY 2008 Outlier Payments 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule (72 FR 
47420), we stated that, based on available 
data, we estimated that actual FY 2007 
outlier payments would be approximately 4.6 
percent of actual total DRG payments. This 
estimate was computed based on simulations 
using the FY 2006 MedPAR file (discharge 
data for FY 2006 bills). That is, the estimate 
of actual outlier payments did not reflect 
actual FY 2007 bills, but instead reflected the 
application of FY 2007 rates and policies to 
available FY 2006 bills. 
Our current estimate, using available FY 
2007 bills, is that actual outlier payments for 
FY 2007 were approximately 4.64 percent of 
actual total DRG payments. Thus, the data 
indicate that, for FY 2007, the percentage of 
actual outlier payments relative to actual 
total payments is lower than we projected 
before FY 2007. Consistent with the policy 
and statutory interpretation we have 
maintained since the inception of the IPPS, 
we do not plan to make retroactive 
adjustments to outlier payments to ensure 
that total outlier payments for FY 2007 are 
equal to 5.1 percent of total DRG payments. 
We currently estimate that actual outlier 
payments for FY 2008 will be approximately 
4.8 percent of actual total DRG payments, 0.3 
percentage points lower than the 5.1 percent 
we projected in setting the outlier policies for 
FY 2008. This estimate is based on 
simulations using the FY 2007 MedPAR file 
(discharge data for FY 2007 bills). We used 
these data to calculate an estimate of the 
actual outlier percentage for FY 2008 by 
applying FY 2008 rates and policies, 
including an outlier threshold of $22,185 to 
available FY 2007 bills. 
e. Proposed Rural Community Hospital 
Demonstration Program Adjustment (Section 
410A of Pub. L. 108–173) 
Section 410A of Pub. L. 108–173 requires 
the Secretary to establish a demonstration 
that will modify reimbursement for inpatient 
services for up to 15 small rural hospitals. 
Section 410A(c)(2) of Pub. L. 108–173 
requires that ‘‘in conducting the 
demonstration program under this section, 
the Secretary shall ensure that the aggregate 
payments made by the Secretary do not 
exceed the amount which the Secretary 
would have paid if the demonstration 
program under this section was not 
implemented.’’ As discussed in section IV.K. 
of the preamble to this proposed rule, we 
have satisfied this requirement by adjusting 
national IPPS rates by a factor that is 
sufficient to account for the added costs of 
this demonstration. There are currently nine 
hospitals participating in the demonstration 
program. CMS is currently conducting a 
solicitation for up to six additional hospitals 
to participate in the demonstration program. 
For this proposed rule, we used data from the 
cost reports of the 9 currently participating 
hospitals to estimate a total cost number for 
15 hospitals that could potentially participate 
in the demonstration program in FY 2009. (In 
the final rule, we will know the exact number 
of hospitals participating in the 
demonstration program, and we will revise 
our estimates accordingly.) We estimate that 
the average additional annual payment that 
will be made to each participating hospital 
under the demonstration will be 
approximately $2,134,123. We based this 
estimate on the recent historical experience 
of the difference between inpatient cost and 
payment for hospitals that are participating 
in the demonstration program. As an estimate 
of the cost for a total of 15 hospitals that may 
participate, the total annual impact of the 
demonstration program for FY 2009 is 
projected to be $32,011,849. The required 
adjustment to the Federal rate used in 
calculating Medicare inpatient prospective 
payments as a result of the demonstration is 
0.999666. 
In order to achieve budget neutrality, we 
are adjusting the national IPPS rates by an 
amount sufficient to account for the added 
costs of this demonstration. In other words, 
we are applying budget neutrality across the 
payment system as a whole rather than 
merely across the participants of this 
demonstration, consistent with past practice. 
We believe that the language of the statutory 
budget neutrality requirement permits the 
agency to implement the budget neutrality 
provision in this manner. The statutory 
language requires that ‘‘aggregate payments 
made by the Secretary do not exceed the 
amount which the Secretary would have paid 
if the demonstration * * * was not 
implemented,’’ but does not identify the 
range across which aggregate payments must 
be held equal. 
5. Proposed FY 2009 Standardized Amount 
The adjusted proposed standardized 
amount is divided into labor-related and 
nonlabor-related portions. Tables 1A and 1B 
of this Addendum contain the national 
standardized amounts that we are proposing 
to apply to all hospitals, except hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico, for FY 2009. The 
proposed Puerto Rico-specific amounts are 
shown in Table 1C of this Addendum. The 
proposed amounts shown in Tables 1A and 
1B differ only in that the labor-related share 
applied to the standardized amounts in Table 
1A is 69.7 percent, and Table 1B is 62 
percent. In accordance with sections 
1886(d)(3)(E) and 1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act, 
we are applying a labor-related share of 62 
percent, unless application of that percentage 
would result in lower payments to a hospital 
than would otherwise be made. In effect, the 
statutory provision means that we apply a 
labor-related share of 62 percent for all 
hospitals (other than those in Puerto Rico) 
whose wage indexes are less than or equal to 
1.0000. 
In addition, Tables 1A and 1B include 
proposed standardized amounts reflecting 
the full 3.0 percent update for FY 2009, and 
proposed standardized amounts reflecting 
the 2.0 percentage point reduction to the 
update (a 1.0 percent update) applicable for 
hospitals that fail to submit quality data 
consistent with section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of 
the Act. 
Under section 1886(d)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act, 
the Federal portion of the Puerto Rico 
payment rate is based on the discharge- 
weighted average of the national large urban 
standardized amount (this proposed amount 
is set forth in Table 1A). The proposed labor- 
related and nonlabor-related portions of the 
national average standardized amounts for 
Puerto Rico hospitals for FY 2009 are set 
forth in Table 1C of this Addendum. This 
table also includes the proposed Puerto Rico 
standardized amounts. The labor-related 
share applied to the Puerto Rico specific 
standardized amount is 58.7 percent, or 62 
percent, depending on which provides higher 
payments to the hospital. (Section 
1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act, as amended by 
section 403(b) of Pub. L. 108–173, provides

that the labor-related share for hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico be 62 percent, unless 
the application of that percentage would 
result in lower payments to the hospital.) 
The following table illustrates the 
proposed changes from the FY 2008 national 
average standardized amount. The second 
and third columns show the proposed 
changes from the FY 2008 standardized 
amounts for hospitals that satisfy the quality 
data submission requirement for receiving 
the full update (3.0 percent) with the 
different labor-related shares that apply to 
hospitals. The fourth and fifth columns show 
the proposed changes for hospitals receiving 
the reduced update (1.0 percent) with the 
different labor-related shares that apply to 
hospitals. The first row of the table shows the 
updated (through FY 2008) average 
standardized amount after restoring the FY 
2008 offsets for outlier payments, 
demonstration budget neutrality, the New 
Jersey imputed floor budget neutrality, and 
the geographic reclassification budget 
neutrality. The DRG reclassification and 
recalibration and wage index budget 
neutrality factor is cumulative. Therefore, the 
FY 2008 factor is not removed from this 
table. Also, in order to properly apply the 
documentation and coding adjustment, it was 
necessary to first remove the FY 2008 
adjustment from the FY 2008 rate in the first 
row of the table and then later in the table 
to cumulatively apply the sum of the FY 
2008 and FY 2009 adjustments (that is, 
1¥(.006 + .009)) to the FY 2009 rate. (For a 
complete discussion on the documentation 
and coding adjustment, we refer readers to 
section II.D of the preamble to this proposed 
rule.)

Under section 1886(d)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act, 
the Federal portion of the Puerto Rico 
payment rate is based on the national average 
standardized amounts. The labor-related and 
nonlabor-related portions of the national 
average standardized amounts for hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico are set forth in Table 
1C of this Addendum. This table also 
includes the Puerto Rico standardized 
amounts. The labor-related share applied to 
the Puerto Rico standardized amount is 58.7 
percent, or 62 percent, depending on which 
results in higher payments to the hospital. 
(Section 1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act, as 
amended by section 403(b) of Pub. L. 108– 
173, provides that the labor-related share for 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico be 62 
percent, unless the application of that 
percentage would result in lower payments 
to the hospital.) 
B. Proposed Adjustments for Area Wage 
Levels and Cost-of-Living 
Tables 1A through 1C, as set forth in this 
Addendum, contain the proposed labor- 
related and nonlabor-related shares that we 
are using to calculate the proposed 
prospective payment rates for hospitals 
located in the 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico for FY 2009. This 
section addresses two types of adjustments to 
the standardized amounts that were made in 
determining the prospective payment rates as 
described in this Addendum. 
1. Proposed Adjustment for Area Wage 
Levels 
Sections 1886(d)(3)(E) and 
1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act require that we 
make an adjustment to the labor-related 
portion of the national and Puerto Rico 
prospective payment rates, respectively, to 
account for area differences in hospital wage 
levels. This adjustment is made by 
multiplying the labor-related portion of the 
adjusted standardized amounts by the 
appropriate wage index for the area in which 
the hospital is located. In section III. of the 
preamble to this proposed rule, we discuss 
the data and methodology for the FY 2009 
wage index. 
2. Proposed Adjustment for Cost-of-Living in 
Alaska and Hawaii 
Section 1886(d)(5)(H) of the Act authorizes 
the Secretary to make an adjustment to take 
into account the unique circumstances of 
hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii. Higher labor- 
related costs for these two States are taken 
into account in the adjustment for area wages 
described above. For FY 2009, we are 
proposing to adjust the payments for 
hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii by 
multiplying the nonlabor-related portion of 
the standardized amount by the applicable 
adjustment factor contained in the table 
below.

C. Proposed MS–DRG Relative Weights 
As discussed in section II.H. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, we have 
developed proposed relative weights for each 
MS–DRG that reflect the resource utilization 
of cases in each MS–DRG relative to 
Medicare cases in other MS–DRGs. Table 5 
of this Addendum contains the proposed 
relative weights that we will apply to 
discharges occurring in FY 2009. These 
factors have been recalibrated as explained in 
section II. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule. 
D. Calculation of the Proposed Prospective 
Payment Rates 
General Formula for Calculation of the 
Proposed Prospective Payment Rates for FY 
2009 
In general, the operating prospective 
payment rate for all hospitals paid under the 
IPPS located outside of Puerto Rico, except 
SCHs and MDHs, for FY 2009 equals the 
Federal rate. 
The prospective payment rate for SCHs for 
FY 2009 equals the higher of the applicable 
Federal rate, or the hospital-specific rate as 
described below. The prospective payment 
rate for MDHs for FY 2009 equals the higher 
of the Federal rate, or the Federal rate plus 
75 percent of the difference between the 
Federal rate and the hospital-specific rate as 
described below. The prospective payment 
rate for hospitals located in Puerto Rico for 
FY 2009 equals 25 percent of the Puerto Rico 
rate plus 75 percent of the applicable 
national rate. 
1. Federal Rate 
The Federal rate is determined as follows: 
Step 1—Select the applicable average 
standardized amount depending on whether 
the hospital submitted qualifying quality data 
(full update for qualifying hospitals, update 
minus 2.0 percentage points for 
nonqualifying hospitals). 
Step 2—Multiply the labor-related portion 
of the standardized amount by the applicable 
wage index for the geographic area in which 
the hospital is located or the area to which 
the hospital is reclassified. 
Step 3—For hospitals in Alaska and 
Hawaii, multiply the nonlabor-related 
portion of the standardized amount by the 
applicable cost-of-living adjustment factor. 
Step 4—Add the amount from Step 2 and 
the nonlabor-related portion of the 
standardized amount (adjusted, if applicable, 
under Step 3). 
Step 5—Multiply the final amount from 
Step 4 by the relative weight corresponding 
to the applicable MS–DRG (see Table 5 of 
this Addendum). 
The Federal rate as determined in Step 5 
is then further adjusted if the hospital 
qualifies for either the IME or DSH 
adjustment. In addition, for hospitals that 
qualify for a low-volume payment adjustment 
under section 1886(d)(12) of the Act and 42 
CFR 412.101(b), the payment in Step 5 is 
increased by 25 percent. 
2. Hospital-Specific Rate (Applicable Only to 
SCHs and MDHs) 
a. Calculation of Hospital-Specific Rate 
Section 1886(b)(3)(C) of the Act provides 
that SCHs are paid based on whichever of the 
following rates yields the greatest aggregate 
payment: the Federal rate; the updated 
hospital-specific rate based on FY 1982 costs 
per discharge; the updated hospital-specific 
rate based on FY 1987 costs per discharge; or 
the updated hospital-specific rate based on 
FY 1996 costs per discharge. 
As discussed previously, MDHs are 
required to rebase their hospital-specific rates 
to their FY 2002 cost reports if doing so 
results in higher payments. In addition, 
effective for discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 2006, MDHs are to be paid based 
on the Federal national rate or, if higher, the 
Federal national rate plus 75 percent 
(changed from 50 percent) of the difference 
between the Federal national rate and the 
greater of the updated hospital-specific rates 
based on either FY 1982, FY 1987 or FY 2002 
costs per discharge. Further, MDHs are no 
longer subject to the 12-percent cap on their 
DSH payment adjustment factor. 
Hospital-specific rates have been 
determined for each of these hospitals based 
on the FY 1982 costs per discharge, the FY 
1987 costs per discharge, or, for SCHs, the FY 
1996 costs per discharge and for MDHs, the 
FY 2002 cost per discharge. For a more 
detailed discussion of the calculation of the 
hospital-specific rates, we refer the reader to 
the FY 1984 IPPS interim final rule (48 FR 
39772); the April 20, 1990 final rule with 
comment (55 FR 15150); the FY 1991 IPPS 
final rule (55 FR 35994); and the FY 2001 
IPPS final rule (65 FR 47082). In addition, for 
both SCHs and MDHs, the hospital-specific 
rate is adjusted by the budget neutrality 
adjustment factor as discussed in section III. 
of this Addendum. The resulting rate will be 
used in determining the payment rate an SCH 
or MDH will receive for its discharges 
beginning on or after October 1, 2007. 
b. Updating the FY 1982, FY 1987, FY 1996, 
and FY 2002 Hospital-Specific Rates for FY 
2009 
We are proposing to increase the hospital- 
specific rates by 3.0 percent (the proposed 
estimated hospital market basket percentage 
increase) for FY 2009 for those SCHs and 
MDHs that submit qualifying quality data 
and by 1.0 percent for SCHs and MDHs that 
fail to submit qualifying quality data. Section 
1886(b)(3)(C)(iv) of the Act provides that the 
update factor applicable to the hospital- 
specific rates for SCHs is equal to the update 
factor provided under section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, which, for SCHs 
in FY 2008, is the market basket rate-of- 
increase for hospitals that submit qualifying 
quality data and the market basket rate-of- 
increase minus 2 percent for hospitals that 
fail to submit qualifying quality data. Section 
1886(b)(3)(D) of the Act provides that the 
update factor applicable to the hospital- 
specific rates for MDHs also equals the 
update factor provided for under section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, which, for FY 
2009, is the market basket rate-of-increase for 
hospitals that submit qualifying quality data 
and the market basket rate-of-increase minus 
2 percent for hospitals that fail to submit 
qualifying quality data. 
3. General Formula for Calculation of 
Proposed Prospective Payment Rates for 
Hospitals Located in Puerto Rico Beginning 
On or After October 1, 2008, and Before 
October 1, 2009 
Section 1886(d)(9)(E)(iv) of the Act 
provides that, effective for discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 2004, 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico are paid 
based on a blend of 75 percent of the national 
prospective payment rate and 25 percent of 
the Puerto Rico-specific rate. 
a. Puerto Rico Rate 
The Puerto Rico prospective payment rate 
is determined as follows: 
Step 1—Select the applicable average 
standardized amount considering the 
applicable wage index (Table 1C of this 
Addendum). 
Step 2—Multiply the labor-related portion 
of the standardized amount by the applicable 
Puerto Rico-specific wage index. 
Step 3—Add the amount from Step 2 and 
the nonlabor-related portion of the 
standardized amount.

Step 4—Multiply the amount from Step 3 
by the applicable MS–DRG relative weight 
(Table 5 of this Addendum). 
Step 5—Multiply the result in Step 4 by 25 
percent. 
b. National Rate 
The national prospective payment rate is 
determined as follows: 
Step 1—Select the applicable average 
standardized amount. 
Step 2—Multiply the labor-related portion 
of the standardized amount by the applicable 
wage index for the geographic area in which 
the hospital is located or the area to which 
the hospital is reclassified. 
Step 3—Add the amount from Step 2 and 
the nonlabor-related portion of the national 
average standardized amount. 
Step 4—Multiply the amount from Step 3 
by the applicable MS–DRG relative weight 
(Table 5 of this Addendum). 
Step 5—Multiply the result in Step 4 by 75 
percent. 
The sum of the Puerto Rico rate and the 
national rate computed above equals the 
prospective payment for a given discharge for 
a hospital located in Puerto Rico. This rate 
is then further adjusted if the hospital 
qualifies for either the IME or DSH 
adjustment. 
III. Proposed Changes to Payment Rates for 
Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Capital- 
Related Costs for FY 2009 
The PPS for acute care hospital inpatient 
capital-related costs was implemented for 
cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1991. Effective with that cost 
reporting period, hospitals were paid during 
a 10-year transition period (which extended 
through FY 2001) to change the payment 
methodology for Medicare acute care hospital 
inpatient capital-related costs from a 
reasonable cost-based methodology to a 
prospective methodology (based fully on the 
Federal rate). 
The basic methodology for determining 
Federal capital prospective rates is set forth 
in the regulations at 42 CFR 412.308 through 
412.352. Below we discuss the factors that 
we are proposing to use to determine the 
capital Federal rate for FY 2009, which 
would be effective for discharges occurring 
on or after October 1, 2008. 
The 10-year transition period ended with 
hospital cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after October 1, 2001 (FY 2002). Therefore, 
for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 
2002, all hospitals (except ‘‘new’’ hospitals 
under § 412.304(c)(2)) are paid based on the 
capital Federal rate. For FY 1992, we 
computed the standard Federal payment rate 
for capital-related costs under the IPPS by 
updating the FY 1989 Medicare inpatient 
capital cost per case by an actuarial estimate 
of the increase in Medicare inpatient capital 
costs per case. Each year after FY 1992, we 
update the capital standard Federal rate, as 
provided at § 412.308(c)(1), to account for 
capital input price increases and other 
factors. The regulations at § 412.308(c)(2) 
provide that the capital Federal rate be 
adjusted annually by a factor equal to the 
estimated proportion of outlier payments 
under the capital Federal rate to total capital 
payments under the capital Federal rate. In 
addition, § 412.308(c)(3) requires that the 
capital Federal rate be reduced by an 
adjustment factor equal to the estimated 
proportion of payments for (regular and 
special) exceptions under § 412.348. Section 
412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the capital 
standard Federal rate be adjusted so that the 
effects of the annual DRG reclassification and 
the recalibration of DRG weights and changes 
in the geographic adjustment factor (GAF) are 
budget neutral. 
For FYs 1992 through 1995, § 412.352 
required that the capital Federal rate also be 
adjusted by a budget neutrality factor so that 
aggregate payments for inpatient hospital 
capital costs were projected to equal 90 
percent of the payments that would have 
been made for capital-related costs on a 
reasonable cost basis during the respective 
fiscal year. That provision expired in FY 
1996. Section 412.308(b)(2) describes the 7.4 
percent reduction to the capital Federal rate 
that was made in FY 1994, and 
§ 412.308(b)(3) describes the 0.28 percent 
reduction to the capital Federal rate made in 
FY 1996 as a result of the revised policy for 
paying for transfers. In FY 1998, we 
implemented section 4402 of Pub. L. 105–33, 
which required that, for discharges occurring 
on or after October 1, 1997, the budget 
neutrality adjustment factor in effect as of 
September 30, 1995, be applied to the 
unadjusted capital standard Federal rate and 
the unadjusted hospital-specific rate. That 
factor was 0.8432, which was equivalent to 
a 15.68 percent reduction to the unadjusted 
capital payment rates. An additional 2.1 
percent reduction to the rates was effective 
from October 1, 1997 through September 30, 
2002, making the total reduction 17.78 
percent. As we discussed in the FY 2003 
IPPS final rule (67 FR 50102) and 
implemented in § 412.308(b)(6), the 2.1 
percent reduction was restored to the 
unadjusted capital payment rates effective 
October 1, 2002. 
To determine the appropriate budget 
neutrality adjustment factor and the regular 
exceptions payment adjustment during the 
10-year transition period, we developed a 
dynamic model of Medicare inpatient 
capital-related costs; that is, a model that 
projected changes in Medicare inpatient 
capital-related costs over time. With the 
expiration of the budget neutrality provision, 
the capital cost model was only used to 
estimate the regular exceptions payment 
adjustment and other factors during the 
transition period. As we explained in the FY 
2002 IPPS final rule (66 FR 39911), beginning 
in FY 2002, an adjustment for regular 
exception payments is no longer necessary 
because regular exception payments were 
only made for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1991, and 
before October 1, 2001 (see § 412.348(b)). 
Because payments are no longer made under 
the regular exception policy effective with 
cost reporting periods beginning in FY 2002, 
we discontinued use of the capital cost 
model. The capital cost model and its 
application during the transition period are 
described in Appendix B of the FY 2002 IPPS 
final rule (66 FR 40099). 
Section 412.374 provides for the use of a 
blended payment system for payments to 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico under the 
IPPS for acute care hospital inpatient capital- 
related costs. Accordingly, under the capital 
PPS, we compute a separate payment rate 
specific to hospitals located in Puerto Rico 
using the same methodology used to compute 
the national Federal rate for capital-related 
costs. In accordance with section 
1886(d)(9)(A) of the Act, under the IPPS for 
acute care hospital operating costs, hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico are paid for operating 
costs under a special payment formula. Prior 
to FY 1998, hospitals located in Puerto Rico 
were paid a blended operating rate that 
consisted of 75 percent of the applicable 
standardized amount specific to Puerto Rico 
hospitals and 25 percent of the applicable 
national average standardized amount. 
Similarly, prior to FY 1998, hospitals located 
in Puerto Rico were paid a blended capital 
rate that consisted of 75 percent of the 
applicable capital Puerto Rico-specific rate 
and 25 percent of the applicable capital 
Federal rate. However, effective October 1, 
1997, in accordance with section 4406 of 
Pub. L. 105–33, the methodology for 
operating payments made to hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico under the IPPS was 
revised to make payments based on a blend 
of 50 percent of the applicable standardized 
amount specific to Puerto Rico hospitals and 
50 percent of the applicable national average 
standardized amount. In conjunction with 
this change to the operating blend 
percentage, effective with discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 1997, we also 
revised the methodology for computing 
capital payments to hospitals located in 
Puerto Rico to be based on a blend of 50 
percent of the Puerto Rico capital rate and 50 
percent of the capital Federal rate. 
As we discussed in the FY 2005 IPPS final 
rule (69 FR 49185), section 504 of Pub. L. 
108–173 increased the national portion of the 
operating IPPS payments for hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico from 50 percent to 
62.5 percent and decreased the Puerto Rico 
portion of the operating IPPS payments from 
50 percent to 37.5 percent for discharges 
occurring on or after April 1, 2004 through 
September 30, 2004 (see the March 26, 2004 
One-Time Notification (Change Request 
3158)). In addition, section 504 of Pub. L. 
108–173 provided that the national portion of 
operating IPPS payments for hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico is equal to 75 percent 
and the Puerto Rico portion of operating IPPS 
payments is equal to 25 percent for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 
2004. Consistent with that change in 
operating IPPS payments to hospitals located 
in Puerto Rico, for FY 2005 (as we discussed 
in the FY 2005 IPPS final rule), we revised 
the methodology for computing capital 
payments to hospitals located in Puerto Rico 
to be based on a blend of 25 percent of the 
Puerto Rico capital rate and 75 percent of the 
capital Federal rate for discharges occurring 
on or after October 1, 2004. 
A. Determination of Proposed Federal 
Hospital Inpatient Capital-Related 
Prospective Payment Rate Update 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66886 through

23716 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
of $426.14 for FY 2008. In the discussion that 
follows, we explain the factors that we are 
proposing to use to determine the proposed 
FY 2009 capital Federal rate. In particular, 
we explain why the proposed FY 2009 
capital Federal rate would decrease 
approximately 1.14 percent, compared to the 
FY 2008 capital Federal rate. However, taking 
into account an estimated increase in 
Medicare fee-for-service discharges in FY 
2009 as compared to FY 2008, as well as the 
estimated increase in payments due to 
documentation and coding (discussed in 
section VIII. of Appendix A to this proposed 
rule), we estimate that the increase in 
aggregate capital payments would be 
negligible during this same period 
(approximately $6 million). Total payments 
to hospitals under the IPPS are relatively 
unaffected by changes in the capital 
prospective payments. Because capital 
payments constitute about 10 percent of 
hospital payments, a 1-percent change in the 
capital Federal rate yields only about a 0.1 
percent change in actual payments to 
hospitals. As noted above, aggregate 
payments under the capital IPPS are 
projected to increase in FY 2009 compared to 
FY 2008. 
1. Projected Capital Standard Federal Rate 
Update 
a. Description of the Update Framework 
Under § 412.308(c)(1), the capital standard 
Federal rate is updated on the basis of an 
analytical framework that takes into account 
changes in a capital input price index (CIPI) 
and several other policy adjustment factors. 
Specifically, we have adjusted the projected 
CIPI rate-of-increase as appropriate each year 
for case-mix index-related changes, for 
intensity, and for errors in previous CIPI 
forecasts. The proposed update factor for FY 
2009 under that framework is 0.7 percent 
based on the best data available at this time. 
The proposed update factor under that 
framework is based on a projected 1.2 
percent increase in the CIPI, a 0.0 percent 
adjustment for intensity, a 0.0 percent 
adjustment for case-mix, a ¥0.5 percent 
adjustment for the FY 2007 DRG 
reclassification and recalibration, and a 
forecast error correction of 0.0 percent. As 
discussed below in section III.C. of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule, we 
continue to believe that the CIPI is the most 
appropriate input price index for capital 
costs to measure capital price changes in a 
given year. We also explain the basis for the 
FY 2009 CIPI projection in that same section 
of this Addendum. In addition, as also noted 
below, the proposed capital rates would be 
further adjusted to account for 
documentation and coding improvements 
under the MS–DRGs discussed in section 
II.D. of the preamble of this proposed rule. 
Below we describe the policy adjustments 
that we are proposing to apply in the update 
framework for FY 2009. 
The case-mix index is the measure of the 
average MS–DRG weight for cases paid under 
the IPPS. Because the MS–DRG weight 
determines the prospective payment for each 
case, any percentage increase in the case-mix 
index corresponds to an equal percentage 
increase in hospital payments. 
The case-mix index can change for any of 
several reasons: 
• The average resource use of Medicare 
patients changes (‘‘real’’ case-mix change); 
• Changes in hospital coding of patient 
records result in higher weight MS–DRG 
assignments (‘‘coding effects’’); and 
• The annual MS–DRG reclassification and 
recalibration changes may not be budget 
neutral (‘‘reclassification effect’’). 
We define real case-mix change as actual 
changes in the mix (and resource 
requirements) of Medicare patients as 
opposed to changes in coding behavior that 
result in assignment of cases to higher 
weighted MS-DRGs but do not reflect higher 
resource requirements. The capital update 
framework includes the same case-mix index 
adjustment used in the former operating IPPS 
update framework (as discussed in the May 
18, 2004 IPPS proposed rule for FY 2005 (69 
FR 28816)). (We no longer use an update 
framework to make a recommendation for 
updating the operating IPPS standardized 
amounts as discussed in section II. of 
Appendix B in the FY 2006 IPPS final rule 
(70 FR 47707).) 
Absent the projected increase in case-mix 
resulting from documentation and coding 
improvements under the recently adopted 
MS-DRGs, for FY 2009, we are projecting a 
1.0 percent total increase in the case-mix 
index. We estimate that the real case-mix 
increase will also equal 1.0 percent for FY 
2009. The net adjustment for change in case- 
mix is the difference between the projected 
real increase in case-mix and the projected 
total increase in case-mix. Therefore, the net 
adjustment for case-mix change in FY 2009 
is 0.0 percentage points. 
The capital update framework also 
contains an adjustment for the effects of DRG 
reclassification and recalibration. This 
adjustment is intended to remove the effect 
on total payments of prior year’s changes to 
the DRG classifications and relative weights, 
in order to retain budget neutrality for all 
case-mix index-related changes other than 
those due to patient severity. Due to the lag 
time in the availability of data, there is a 2- 
year lag in data used to determine the 
adjustment for the effects of DRG 
reclassification and recalibration. For 
example, we are adjusting for the effects of 
the FY 2007 DRG reclassification and 
recalibration as part of our proposed update 
for FY 2009. We estimate that FY 2007 DRG 
reclassification and recalibration resulted in 
a 0.5 percent change in the case-mix when 
compared with the case-mix index that 
would have resulted if we had not made the 
reclassification and recalibration changes to 
the DRGs. Therefore, we are proposing to 
make a ¥0.5 percent adjustment for DRG 
reclassification in the proposed update for 
FY 2009 to maintain budget neutrality. 
The capital update framework also 
contains an adjustment for forecast error. The 
input price index forecast is based on 
historical trends and relationships 
ascertainable at the time the update factor is 
established for the upcoming year. In any 
given year, there may be unanticipated price 
fluctuations that may result in differences 
between the actual increase in prices and the 
forecast used in calculating the update 
factors. In setting a prospective payment rate 
under the framework, we make an 
adjustment for forecast error only if our 
estimate of the change in the capital input 
price index for any year is off by 0.25 
percentage points or more. There is a 2-year 
lag between the forecast and the availability 
of data to develop a measurement of the 
forecast error. A forecast error of 0.10 
percentage point was calculated for the FY 
2007 update. That is, current historical data 
indicate that the forecasted FY 2007 CIPI (1.1 
percent) used in calculating the FY 2007 
update factor slightly understated the actual 
realized price increases (1.2 percent) by 0.10 
percentage point. This slight underprediction 
was mostly due to the incorporation of newly 
available source data for fixed asset prices 
and moveable asset prices into the market 
basket. However, because this estimation of 
the change in the CIPI is less than 0.25 
percentage points, it is not reflected in the 
update recommended under this framework. 
Therefore, we are proposing to make a 0.0 
percent adjustment for forecast error in the 
update for FY 2009. 
Under the capital IPPS update framework, 
we also make an adjustment for changes in 
intensity. We calculate this adjustment using 
the same methodology and data that were 
used in the past under the framework for 
operating IPPS. The intensity factor for the 
operating update framework reflects how 
hospital services are utilized to produce the 
final product, that is, the discharge. This 
component accounts for changes in the use 
of quality-enhancing services, for changes 
within DRG severity, and for expected 
modification of practice patterns to remove 
noncost-effective services. 
We calculate case-mix constant intensity as 
the change in total charges per admission, 
adjusted for price level changes (the CPI for 
hospital and related services) and changes in 
real case-mix. The use of total charges in the 
calculation of the intensity factor makes it a 
total intensity factor; that is, charges for 
capital services are already built into the 
calculation of the factor. Therefore, we have 
incorporated the intensity adjustment from 
the operating update framework into the 
capital update framework. Without reliable 
estimates of the proportions of the overall 
annual intensity increases that are due, 
respectively, to ineffective practice patterns 
and the combination of quality-enhancing 
new technologies and complexity within the 
DRG system, we assume that one-half of the 
annual increase is due to each of these 
factors. The capital update framework thus 
provides an add-on to the input price index 
rate of increase of one-half of the estimated 
annual increase in intensity, to allow for 
increases within DRG severity and the 
adoption of quality-enhancing technology. 
We have developed a Medicare-specific 
intensity measure based on a 5-year average. 
Past studies of case-mix change by the RAND 
Corporation (Has DRG Creep Crept Up? 
Decomposing the Case Mix Index Change 
Between 1987 and 1988 by G. M. Carter, J. 
P. Newhouse, and D. A. Relles, R–4098– 
HCFA/ProPAC (1991)) suggest that real case- 
mix change was not dependent on total 
change, but was usually a fairly steady 
increase of 1.0 to 1.5 percent per year.

However, we used 1.4 percent as the upper 
bound because the RAND study did not take 
into account that hospitals may have induced 
doctors to document medical records more 
completely in order to improve payment. 
We calculate case-mix constant intensity as 
the change in total charges per admission, 
adjusted for price level changes (the CPI for 
hospital and related services), and changes in 
real case-mix. As we noted above, in 
accordance with § 412.308(c)(1)(ii), we began 
updating the capital standard Federal rate in 
FY 1996 using an update framework that 
takes into account, among other things, 
allowable changes in the intensity of hospital 
services. For FYs 1996 through 2001, we 
found that case-mix constant intensity was 
declining, and we established a 0.0 percent 
adjustment for intensity in each of those 
years. For FYs 2002 and 2003, we found that 
case-mix constant intensity was increasing, 
and we established a 0.3 percent adjustment 
and 1.0 percent adjustment for intensity, 
respectively. For FYs 2004 and 2005, we 
found that the charge data appeared to be 
skewed (as discussed in greater detail below), 
and we established a 0.0 percent adjustment 
in each of those years. Furthermore, we 
stated that we would continue to apply a 0.0 
percent adjustment for intensity until any 
increase in charges can be tied to intensity 
rather than attempts to maximize outlier 
payments. 
As noted above, our intensity measure is 
based on a 5-year average, and therefore, the 
intensity adjustment for FY 2009 is based on 
data from the 5-year period beginning with 
FY 2003 and extending through FY 2007. 
There continues to be a substantial increase 
in hospital charges for three of those 5 years 
without a corresponding increase in the 
hospital case-mix index. Most dramatically, 
for FY 2003, the change in hospitals’ charges 
is over 16 percent, which is reflective of the 
large increases in charges that we found in 
the 4 years prior to FY 2003 and before our 
revisions to the outlier policy in 2003 
(discussed below). For FY 2004 and FY 2005, 
the change in hospitals’ charges is somewhat 
lower in comparison to FY 2003, but is still 
significantly large. For FY 2006 and FY 2007, 
the change in hospitals’ charges appears to be 
slightly moderating. However, the change in 
hospitals’ charges for FYs 2003 and 2004 and 
to a somewhat lesser extent FY 2005 remains 
similar to the considerable increase in 
hospitals’ charges that we found when 
examining hospitals’ charge data in 
determining the intensity factor in the update 
recommendations for the past few years, as 
discussed in the FY 2004 IPPS final rule (68 
FR 45482), the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 
FR 49285), the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 
FR 47500), the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (72 
FR 47500), and the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47426). If 
hospitals were treating new or different types 
of cases, which would result in an 
appropriate increase in charges per 
discharge, then we would expect hospitals’ 
case-mix to increase proportionally. As we 
discussed most recently in the FY 2008 IPPS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
47426), because our intensity calculation 
relies heavily upon charge data and we 
believe that these charge data may be 
inappropriately skewed, we established a 0.0 
percent adjustment for intensity for FY 2008 
just as we did for FYs 2004 through 2007. 
On June 9, 2003, we published in the 
Federal Register revisions to our outlier 
policy for determining the additional 
payment for extraordinarily high-cost cases 
(68 FR 34494 through 34515). These revised 
policies were effective on August 8, 2003, 
and October 1, 2003. While it does appear 
that a response to these policy changes is 
beginning to occur, that is, the increase in 
charges for FYs 2004 and 2005 are somewhat 
less than the previous 4 years, they still show 
a significant annual increase in charges 
without a corresponding increase in hospital 
case-mix. Specifically, the increases in 
charges in FY 2004 and FY 2005 
(approximately 12 percent and 8 percent, 
respectively), for example, which, while less 
than the increase in the previous 3 years, are 
still much higher than increases in years 
prior to FY 2001. In addition, these increases 
in charges for FYs 2003, FY 2004, and FY 
2005 significantly exceed the respective case- 
mix increases for the same period. Based on 
the significant increases in charges for FYs 
2003 through 2005 that remain in the 5-year 
average used for the intensity adjustment, we 
believe residual effects of hospitals’ charge 
practices prior to the implementation of the 
outlier policy revisions established in the 
June 9, 2003 final rule continue to appear in 
the data, because it may have taken hospitals 
some time to adopt changes in their behavior 
in response to the new outlier policy. Thus, 
we believe that the FY 2003, FY 2004, FY 
2005 charge data may still be skewed. 
Although it appears that the change in 
hospitals’ charges is more reasonable because 
the intensity adjustment is based on a 5-year 
average, and although the new outlier policy 
was generally effective in FY 2004, we 
believe the effects of hospitals attempting to 
maximize outlier payments, while lessening 
costs, continue to skew the charge data. 
Therefore, we are proposing to make a 0.0 
percent adjustment for intensity for FY 2009. 
In the past (FYs 1996 through 2001) when we 
found intensity to be declining, we believed 
a zero (rather than negative) intensity 
adjustment was appropriate. Similarly, we 
believe that it is appropriate to apply a zero 
intensity adjustment for FY 2009 until any 
increase in charges during the 5-year period 
upon which the intensity adjustment is based 
can be tied to intensity rather than to 
attempts to maximize outlier payments. 
Above, we described the basis of the 
components used to develop the proposed 
0.7 percent capital update factor for all 
hospitals under the capital update framework 
for FY 2009 as shown in the table below.

b. Comparison of CMS and MedPAC Update 
Recommendation 
In its March 2008 Report to Congress, 
MedPAC did not make a specific update 
recommendation for capital IPPS payments 
for FY 2009. However, in that same report, 
in assessing the adequacy of current 
payments and costs, MedPAC recommended 
an update to the hospital inpatient and 
outpatient PPS rates equal to the increase in 
the hospital market basket in FY 2009, 
concurrent with a quality incentive program. 
(MedPAC’s Report to the Congress: Medicare 
Payment Policy, March 2008, Section 2A.) 
2. Proposed Outlier Payment Adjustment 
Factor 
Section 412.312(c) establishes a unified 
outlier payment methodology for inpatient 
operating and inpatient capital-related costs. 
A single set of thresholds is used to identify 
outlier cases for both inpatient operating and 
inpatient capital-related payments. Section 
412.308(c)(2) provides that the standard 
Federal rate for inpatient capital-related costs 
be reduced by an adjustment factor equal to 
the estimated proportion of capital-related 
outlier payments to total inpatient capital- 
related PPS payments. The outlier thresholds 
are set so that operating outlier payments are 
projected to be 5.1 percent of total operating 
DRG payments. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment (72 FR 66887), we estimated that 
outlier payments for capital would equal 4.77 
percent of inpatient capital-related payments 
based on the capital Federal rate in FY 2008. 
Based on the proposed thresholds as set forth

23718 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
in section II.A. of this Addendum, we 
estimate that proposed outlier payments for 
capital-related costs would equal 5.73 
percent for inpatient capital-related 
payments based on the proposed capital 
Federal rate in FY 2009. Therefore, we are 
proposing to apply an outlier adjustment 
factor of 0.9427 to the capital Federal rate. 
Thus, we estimate that the percentage of 
capital outlier payments to total capital 
standard payments for FY 2009 will be 
higher than the percentages for FY 2008. This 
increase is primarily due to the proposed 
decrease to the fixed-loss amount, which is 
discussed section II.A. of this Addendum. 
The outlier reduction factors are not built 
permanently into the capital rates; that is, 
they are not applied cumulatively in 
determining the capital Federal rate. The 
proposed FY 2009 outlier adjustment of 
0.9427 is a ¥1.01percent change from the FY 
2008 outlier adjustment of 0.9523. Therefore, 
the net change in the proposed outlier 
adjustment to the capital Federal rate for FY 
2009 is 0.9899 (0.9427/0.9523). Thus, the 
proposed outlier adjustment decreases the FY 
2009 capital Federal rate by 1.01 percent 
compared with the FY 2008 outlier 
adjustment. 
3. Proposed Budget Neutrality Adjustment 
Factor for Changes in DRG Classifications 
and Weights and the GAF 
Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the 
capital Federal rate be adjusted so that 
aggregate payments for the fiscal year based 
on the capital Federal rate after any changes 
resulting from the annual DRG 
reclassification and recalibration and changes 
in the GAF are projected to equal aggregate 
payments that would have been made on the 
basis of the capital Federal rate without such 
changes. Because we implemented a separate 
GAF for Puerto Rico, we apply separate 
budget neutrality adjustments for the 
national GAF and the Puerto Rico GAF. We 
apply the same budget neutrality factor for 
DRG reclassifications and recalibration 
nationally and for Puerto Rico. Separate 
adjustments were unnecessary for FY 1998 
and earlier because the GAF for Puerto Rico 
was implemented in FY 1998. 
In the past, we used the actuarial capital 
cost model (described in Appendix B of the 
FY 2002 IPPS final rule (66 FR 40099)) to 
estimate the aggregate payments that would 
have been made on the basis of the capital 
Federal rate with and without changes in the 
DRG classifications and weights and in the 
GAF to compute the adjustment required to 
maintain budget neutrality for changes in 
DRG weights and in the GAF. During the 
transition period, the capital cost model was 
also used to estimate the regular exception 
payment adjustment factor. As we explain in 
section III.A. of this Addendum, beginning in 
FY 2002, an adjustment for regular exception 
payments is no longer necessary. Therefore, 
we will no longer use the capital cost model. 
Instead, we are using historical data based on 
hospitals’ actual cost experiences to 
determine the exceptions payment 
adjustment factor for special exceptions 
payments. 
To determine the proposed factors for FY 
2009, we compared (separately for the 
national capital rate and the Puerto Rico 
capital rate) estimated aggregate capital 
Federal rate payments based on the FY 2008 
DRG relative weights and the FY 2008 GAF 
to estimated aggregate capital Federal rate 
payments based on the proposed FY 2009 
relative weights and the proposed FY 2009 
GAFs. We established the final FY 2008 
budget neutrality factors of 0.9902 for the 
national capital rate and 0.9955 for the 
Puerto Rico capital rate. In making the 
comparison, we set the exceptions reduction 
factor to 1.00. To achieve budget neutrality 
for the changes in the national GAFs, based 
on calculations using updated data, we are 
proposing to apply an incremental budget 
neutrality adjustment of 1.0013 for FY 2009 
to the previous cumulative FY 2008 
adjustments of 0.9902, yielding a proposed 
adjustment of 0.9915, through FY 2009. For 
the Puerto Rico GAFs, we are proposing to 
apply a proposed incremental budget 
neutrality adjustment of 1.0009 for FY 2009 
to the previous cumulative FY 2008 
adjustment of 0.9955, yielding a proposed 
cumulative adjustment of 0.9965 (calculated 
with unrounded numbers) through FY 2009. 
We then compared estimated aggregate 
capital Federal rate payments based on the 
FY 2008 DRG relative weights and the 
proposed FY 2009 GAFs to estimated 
aggregate capital Federal rate payments based 
on the cumulative effects of the proposed FY 
2009 DRG relative weights and the proposed 
FY 2009 GAFs. The proposed incremental 
adjustment for proposed DRG classifications 
and proposed changes in relative weights is 
0.9994 both nationally and for Puerto Rico. 
The proposed cumulative adjustments for 
DRG classifications and changes in relative 
weights and for proposed changes in the 
GAFs through FY 2009 are 0.9909 nationally 
and 0.9959 for Puerto Rico. The following 
table summarizes the adjustment factors for 
each fiscal year:

BILLING CODE 4120–01–C 
The methodology used to determine the 
recalibration and geographic (DRG/GAF) 
budget neutrality adjustment factor is similar 
to the methodology used in establishing 
budget neutrality adjustments under the PPS 
for operating costs. One difference is that, 
under the operating PPS, the budget 
neutrality adjustments for the effect of 
geographic reclassifications are determined 
separately from the effects of other changes 
in the hospital wage index and the DRG 
relative weights. Under the capital PPS, there 
is a single DRG/GAF budget neutrality 
adjustment factor (the national capital rate 
and the Puerto Rico capital rate are 
determined separately) for changes in the 
GAF (including geographic reclassification) 
and the DRG relative weights. In addition, 
there is no adjustment for the effects that 
geographic reclassification has on the other 
payment parameters, such as the payments 
for serving low-income patients or indirect 
medical education payments. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS correction notice (72 
FR 57636), we calculated a GAF/DRG budget 
neutrality factor of 0.9996 for FY 2008. For 
FY 2009, we are proposing to establish a 
GAF/DRG budget neutrality factor of 1.0007. 
The GAF/DRG budget neutrality factors are

built permanently into the capital rates; that 
is, they are applied cumulatively in 
determining the capital Federal rate. This 
follows the requirement that estimated 
aggregate payments each year be no more or 
less than they would have been in the 
absence of the annual DRG reclassification 
and recalibration and changes in the GAFs. 
The incremental change in the proposed 
adjustment from FY 2008 to FY 2009 is 
1.0007. The cumulative change in the 
proposed capital Federal rate due to this 
proposed adjustment is 0.9909 (the product 
of the incremental factors for FYs 1994 
though 2008 and the proposed incremental 
factor of 1.0007 for FY 2009). (We note that 
averages of the incremental factors that were 
in effect during FYs 2004 and 2005, 
respectively, were used in the calculation of 
the proposed cumulative adjustment of 
0.9909 for FY 2009.) 
The proposed factor accounts for DRG 
reclassifications and recalibration and for 
changes in the GAFs. It also incorporates the 
effects on the proposed GAFs of FY 2009 
geographic reclassification decisions made by 
the MGCRB compared to FY 2008 decisions. 
However, it does not account for changes in 
payments due to changes in the DSH and 
IME adjustment factors. 
4. Exceptions Payment Adjustment Factor 
Section 412.308(c)(3) of our regulations 
requires that the capital standard Federal rate 
be reduced by an adjustment factor equal to 
the estimated proportion of additional 
payments for both regular exceptions and 
special exceptions under § 412.348 relative to 
total capital PPS payments. In estimating the 
proportion of regular exception payments to 
total capital PPS payments during the 
transition period, we used the actuarial 
capital cost model originally developed for 
determining budget neutrality (described in 
Appendix B of the FY 2002 IPPS final rule 
(66 FR 40099)) to determine the exceptions 
payment adjustment factor, which was 
applied to both the Federal and hospital- 
specific capital rates. 
An adjustment for regular exception 
payments is no longer necessary in 
determining the FY 2009 capital Federal rate 
because, in accordance with § 412.348(b), 
regular exception payments were only made 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1991 and before October 1, 
2001. Accordingly, as we explained in the FY 
2002 IPPS final rule (66 FR 39949), in FY 
2002 and subsequent fiscal years, no 
payments are made under the regular 
exceptions provision. However, in 
accordance with § 412.308(c), we still need to 
compute a budget neutrality adjustment for 
special exception payments under 
§ 412.348(g). We describe our methodology 
for determining the exceptions adjustment 
used in calculating the FY 2008 capital 
Federal rate below. 
Under the special exceptions provision 
specified at § 412.348(g)(1), eligible hospitals 
include SCHs, urban hospitals with at least 
100 beds that have a disproportionate share 
percentage of at least 20.2 percent or qualify 
for DSH payments under § 412.106(c)(2), and 
hospitals with a combined Medicare and 
Medicaid inpatient utilization of at least 70 
percent. An eligible hospital may receive 
special exceptions payments if it meets the 
following criteria: (1) A project need 
requirement as described at § 412.348(g)(2), 
which, in the case of certain urban hospitals, 
includes an excess capacity test as described 
at § 412.348(g)(4); (2) an age of assets test as 
described at § 412.348(g)(3); and (3) a project 
size requirement as described at 
§ 412.348(g)(5). 
Based on information compiled from our 
fiscal intermediaries, six hospitals have 
qualified for special exceptions payments 
under § 412.348(g). Because we have cost 
reports ending in FY 2005 for all of these 
hospitals, we calculated the adjustment 
based on actual cost experience. Using data 
from cost reports ending in FY 2005 from the 
December 2007 update of the HCRIS data, we 
divided the capital special exceptions 
payment amounts for the six hospitals that 
qualified for special exceptions by the total 
capital PPS payment amounts (including 
special exception payments) for all hospitals. 
Based on the data from cost reports ending 
in FY 2005, this ratio is rounded to 0.0002. 
We also computed the ratios for FY 2004 and 
FY 2003, which both round to 0.0003. Since 
the ratios are trending downward, we are 
proposing an adjustment of 0.0002. Because 
special exceptions are budget neutral, we are 
proposing to offset the proposed capital 
Federal rate by 0.02 percent for special 
exceptions payments for FY 2009. Therefore, 
the proposed exceptions adjustment factor is 
equal to 0.9998 (1¥0.0002) to account for 
special exceptions payments in FY 2009. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47430), we estimated 
that total (special) exceptions payments for 
FY 2008 would equal 0.03 percent of 
aggregate payments based on the capital 
Federal rate. Therefore, we applied an 
exceptions adjustment factor of 0.9997 (1 ¥ 
0.0003) to determine the FY 2008 capital 
Federal rate. As we stated above, we estimate 
that exceptions payments in FY 2009 would 
equal 0.02 percent of aggregate payments 
based on the proposed FY 2009 capital 
Federal rate. Therefore, we are proposing to 
apply an exceptions payment adjustment 
factor of 0.9998 to the proposed capital 
Federal rate for FY 2009. The proposed 
exceptions adjustment factor for FY 2009 is 
slightly lower than the factor used in 
determining the FY 2008 capital Federal rate 
in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule. The 
exceptions reduction factors are not built 
permanently into the capital rates; that is, the 
factors are not applied cumulatively in 
determining the capital Federal rate. 
Therefore, the net change in the proposed 
exceptions adjustment factor used in 
determining the proposed FY 2009 capital 
Federal rate is 1.0001 (0.9998/0.9997). 
5. Proposed Capital Standard Federal Rate for 
FY 2009 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66888), we 
established a capital Federal rate of $426.14 
for all hospitals for FY 2008. We are 
proposing to establish an update of 0.7 
percent in determining the proposed FY 2009 
capital Federal rate for all hospitals. 
However, under the statutory authority at 
section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act, and as 
specified in section 7 of Pub. L. 110–90, we 
are proposing an additional 0.9 percent 
reduction to the proposed standardized 
amounts for both capital and operating 
Federal payment rates in FY 2009. The 
proposed 0.9 percent reduction is based on 
our Actuary’s analysis of the effect of changes 
in coding or classification of discharges that 
do not reflect real changes in case-mix in 
light of the adoption of the MS–DRGs. 
Although the proposed 0.9 percent reduction 
is outside the established process for 
developing the proposed capital Federal 
payment rate, it nevertheless is a factor in the 
final prospective payment rate to hospitals 
for capital-related costs. For that reason, the 
proposed national capital Federal payment 
rate proposed in this proposed rule was 
determined by applying the proposed 0.9 
percent reduction. (As discussed below in 
section II.A.6. of this Addendum, we are not 
proposing to apply the proposed 0.9 percent 
reduction in developing the proposed FY 
2009 Puerto Rico-specific capital rate.) As a 
result of the proposed 0.70 percent update 
and other proposed budget neutrality factors 
discussed above, we are proposing to 
establish a capital Federal rate of $421.29 for 
FY 2009. The proposed capital Federal rate 
for FY 2009 was calculated as follows: 
• The proposed FY 2009 update factor is 
1.0070, that is, the update is 0.70 percent. 
• The proposed FY 2009 budget neutrality 
adjustment factor that is applied to the 
capital standard Federal payment rate for 
changes in the DRG relative weights and in 
the GAFs is 1.0007. 
• The proposed FY 2009 outlier 
adjustment factor is 0.9427. 
• The proposed FY 2009 (special) 
exceptions payment adjustment factor is 
0.9998. 
• The proposed FY 2009 reduction for 
improvements in documentation and coding 
under the MS–DRGs is 0.9 percent. 
Because the proposed capital Federal rate 
has already been adjusted for differences in 
case-mix, wages, cost-of-living, indirect 
medical education costs, and payments to 
hospitals serving a disproportionate share of 
low-income patients, we are not proposing to 
make additional adjustments in the proposed 
capital standard Federal rate for these factors, 
other than the budget neutrality factor for 
changes in the DRG relative weights and the 
GAFs. 
We are providing the following chart that 
shows how each of the proposed factors and 
adjustments for FY 2009 affected the 
computation of the proposed FY 2009 capital 
Federal rate in comparison to the FY 2008 
capital Federal rate. The proposed FY 2009 
update factor has the effect of increasing the 
proposed capital Federal rate by 0.70 percent 
compared to the FY 2008 capital Federal rate. 
The proposed GAF/DRG budget neutrality 
factor has the effect of increasing the 
proposed capital Federal rate by 0.07 percent. 
The proposed FY 2009 outlier adjustment 
factor has the effect of decreasing the 
proposed capital Federal rate by 1.01 percent 
compared to the FY 2008 capital Federal rate. 
The proposed FY 2009 exceptions payment 
adjustment factor has the effect of increasing 
the proposed capital Federal rate by 0.01 
percent. The proposed adjustment for 
improvements in documentation and coding

under the MS–DRGs has the effect of 
decreasing the proposed FY 2009 capital 
Federal rate by 0.9 percent as compared to 
the FY 2008 capital Federal rate. The 
combined effect of all the proposed changes 
decreases the proposed capital Federal rate 
by 1.14 percent compared to the FY 2008 
capital Federal rate.

1 The update factor and the GAF/DRG budget neutrality factors are built permanently into the capital rates. Thus, for example, the incremental 
change from FY 2008 to FY 2009 resulting from the application of the proposed 1.0007 GAF/DRG budget neutrality factor for FY 2009 is 1.0007. 
2 The outlier reduction factor and the exceptions adjustment factor are not built permanently into the capital rates; that is, these factors are not 
applied cumulatively in determining the capital rates. Thus, for example, the net change resulting from the application of the proposed FY 2009 
outlier adjustment factor is 0.9427/0.9523, or 0.9899. 
3 Proposed adjustment to FY 2009 IPPS rates to account for documentation and coding improvements expected to result from the adoption of 
the MS–DRGs, as discussed above in section III.D. of the Addendum to this proposed rule.

6. Proposed Special Capital Rate for Puerto 
Rico Hospitals 
Section 412.374 provides for the use of a 
blended payment system for payments to 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico under the 
PPS for acute care hospital inpatient capital- 
related costs. Accordingly, under the capital 
PPS, we compute a separate payment rate 
specific to hospitals located in Puerto Rico 
using the same methodology used to compute 
the national Federal rate for capital-related 
costs. Under the broad authority of section 
1886(g) of the Act, as discussed in section V. 
of the preamble of this proposed rule, 
beginning with discharges occurring on or 
after October 1, 2004, capital payments to 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico are based on 
a blend of 25 percent of the Puerto Rico 
capital rate and 75 percent of the capital 
Federal rate. The Puerto Rico capital rate is 
derived from the costs of Puerto Rico 
hospitals only, while the capital Federal rate 
is derived from the costs of all acute care 
hospitals participating in the IPPS (including 
Puerto Rico). 
To adjust hospitals’ capital payments for 
geographic variations in capital costs, we 
apply a GAF to both portions of the blended 
capital rate. The GAF is calculated using the 
operating IPPS wage index, and varies 
depending on the labor market area or rural 
area in which the hospital is located. We use 
the Puerto Rico wage index to determine the 
GAF for the Puerto Rico part of the capital- 
blended rate and the national wage index to 
determine the GAF for the national part of 
the blended capital rate. 
Because we implemented a separate GAF 
for Puerto Rico in FY 1998, we also apply 
separate budget neutrality adjustments for 
the national GAF and for the Puerto Rico 
GAF. However, we apply the same budget 
neutrality factor for DRG reclassifications and 
recalibration nationally and for Puerto Rico. 
As we stated above in section III.A.4. of this 
Addendum, for Puerto Rico, the proposed 
GAF budget neutrality factor is 1.0009, while 
the DRG adjustment is 0.9994, for a 
combined proposed cumulative adjustment 
of 1.0004. 
In computing the payment for a particular 
Puerto Rico hospital, the Puerto Rico portion 
of the capital rate (25 percent) is multiplied 
by the Puerto Rico-specific GAF for the labor 
market area in which the hospital is located, 
and the national portion of the capital rate 
(75 percent) is multiplied by the national 
GAF for the labor market area in which the 
hospital is located (which is computed from 
national data for all hospitals in the United 
States and Puerto Rico). In FY 1998, we 
implemented a 17.78 percent reduction to the 
Puerto Rico capital rate as a result of Pub. L. 
105–33. In FY 2003, a small part of that 
reduction was restored. 
For FY 2008, before application of the 
GAF, the special capital rate for hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico was $201.67 for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 
2007, through September 30, 2008 (72 FR 
66888). However, as discussed in greater 
detail in section II.D. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we are revising this rate in a 
forthcoming correction notice that will be 
retroactive to October 1, 2007, to remove the 
application of the 0.6 percent documentation 
and coding adjustment for FY 2008, 
consistent with the correction to the Puerto 
Rico specific standardized amount for FY 
2008. The statute gives broad authority to the 
Secretary under section 1886(g) of the Act, 
with respect to the development of and 
adjustments to a capital PPS. Although we 
would not be outside the authority of section 
1886(g) of the Act in applying the 
documentation and coding adjustment to the 
Puerto Rico-specific portion of the capital 
payment rate, we have historically made 
changes to the capital PPS consistent with 
those changes made to the IPPS. Thus, we are 
removing the documentation and coding 
adjustment from the FY 2008 Puerto Rico- 
specific portion of the blended capital 
payment rate, consistent with its removal 
from the Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount under the IPPS for operating costs. 
Furthermore, we are not proposing to apply 
the 0.9 percent documentation and coding 
adjustment to the proposed FY 2009 Puerto 
Rico-specific portion of the blended capital 
payment. However, as also discussed in 
section II.D. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule, we may propose to apply such an 
adjustment to the Puerto Rico operating and 
capital rates in the future. With the changes 
we are proposing to make to the other factors 
used to determine the capital rate, the 
proposed FY 2009 special capital rate for 
hospitals in Puerto Rico is $197.19. 
B. Calculation of the Proposed Inpatient 
Capital-Related Prospective Payments for FY 
2009 
Because the 10-year capital PPS transition 
period ended in FY 2001, all hospitals 
(except ‘‘new’’ hospitals under § 412.324(b) 
and under § 412.304(c)(2)) are paid based on 
100 percent of the capital Federal rate in FY 
2007. The applicable capital Federal rate was 
determined by making the following 
adjustments: 
• For outliers, by dividing the capital 
standard Federal rate by the outlier reduction 
factor for that fiscal year; and 
• For the payment adjustments applicable 
to the hospital, by multiplying the hospital’s 
GAF, disproportionate share adjustment 
factor, and IME adjustment factor, when 
appropriate. 
For purposes of calculating payments for 
each discharge during FY 2009, the capital 
standard Federal rate would be adjusted as 
follows: (Standard Federal Rate) × (DRG 
weight) × (GAF) × (COLA for hospitals 
located in Alaska and Hawaii) × (1 + 
Disproportionate Share Adjustment Factor + 
IME Adjustment Factor, if applicable). The 
result is the adjusted capital Federal rate. (As 
discussed above and in section V. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, we 
eliminated the large urban add-on adjustment 
in existing regulations at § 412.316, 
beginning in FY 2008.) 
Hospitals also may receive outlier 
payments for those cases that qualify under 
the thresholds established for each fiscal 
year. Section 412.312(c) provides for a single

23722 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
set of thresholds to identify outlier cases for 
both inpatient operating and inpatient 
capital-related payments. The proposed 
outlier thresholds for FY 2009 are in section 
II.A. of this Addendum. For FY 2009, a case 
qualifies as a cost outlier if the cost for the 
case plus the IME and DSH payments is 
greater than the prospective payment rate for 
the DRG plus the proposed fixed-loss amount 
of $21,025. 
An eligible hospital may also qualify for a 
special exceptions payment under 
§ 412.348(g) up through the 10th year beyond 
the end of the capital transition period if it 
meets the following criteria: (1) A project 
need requirement described at 
§ 412.348(g)(2), which in the case of certain 
urban hospitals includes an excess capacity 
test as described at § 412.348(g)(4); and (2) a 
project size requirement as described at 
§ 412.348(g)(5). Eligible hospitals include 
SCHs, urban hospitals with at least 100 beds 
that have a DSH patient percentage of at least 
20.2 percent or qualify for DSH payments 
under § 412.106(c)(2), and hospitals that have 
a combined Medicare and Medicaid inpatient 
utilization of at least 70 percent. Under 
§ 412.348(g)(8), the amount of a special 
exceptions payment is determined by 
comparing the cumulative payments made to 
the hospital under the capital PPS to the 
cumulative minimum payment level. This 
amount is offset by: (1) Any amount by 
which a hospital’s cumulative capital 
payments exceed its cumulative minimum 
payment levels applicable under the regular 
exceptions process for cost reporting periods 
beginning during which the hospital has 
been subject to the capital PPS; and (2) any 
amount by which a hospital’s current year 
operating and capital payments (excluding 75 
percent of operating DSH payments) exceed 
its operating and capital costs. Under 
§ 412.348(g)(6), the minimum payment level 
is 70 percent for all eligible hospitals. 
During the transition period, new hospitals 
(as defined under § 412.300) were exempt 
from the capital IPPS for their first 2 years 
of operation and were paid 85 percent of 
their reasonable costs during that period. 
Effective with the third year of operation 
through the remainder of the transition 
period, under § 412.324(b), we paid the 
hospitals under the appropriate transition 
methodology (if the hold-harmless 
methodology were applicable, the hold- 
harmless payment for assets in use during the 
base period would extend for 8 years, even 
if the hold-harmless payments extend beyond 
the normal transition period). 
Under § 412.304(c)(2), for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2002, we pay a new hospital 85 percent of 
its reasonable costs during the first 2 years 
of operation unless it elects to receive 
payment based on 100 percent of the capital 
Federal rate. Effective with the third year of 
operation, we pay the hospital based on 100 
percent of the capital Federal rate (that is, the 
same methodology used to pay all other 
hospitals subject to the capital PPS). 
C. Capital Input Price Index 
1. Background 
Like the operating input price index, the 
capital input price index (CIPI) is a fixed- 
weight price index that measures the price 
changes associated with capital costs during 
a given year. The CIPI differs from the 
operating input price index in one important 
aspect—the CIPI reflects the vintage nature of 
capital, which is the acquisition and use of 
capital over time. Capital expenses in any 
given year are determined by the stock of 
capital in that year (that is, capital that 
remains on hand from all current and prior 
capital acquisitions). An index measuring 
capital price changes needs to reflect this 
vintage nature of capital. Therefore, the CIPI 
was developed to capture the vintage nature 
of capital by using a weighted-average of past 
capital purchase prices up to and including 
the current year. 
We periodically update the base year for 
the operating and capital input prices to 
reflect the changing composition of inputs for 
operating and capital expenses. The CIPI was 
last rebased to FY 2002 in the FY 2006 IPPS 
final rule (70 FR 47387). 
2. Forecast of the CIPI for FY 2009 
Based on the latest forecast by Global 
Insight, Inc. (first quarter of 2008), we are 
forecasting the CIPI to increase 1.2 percent in 
FY 2009. This reflects a projected 1.9 percent 
increase in vintage-weighted depreciation 
prices (building and fixed equipment, and 
movable equipment), and a 2.9 percent 
increase in other capital expense prices in FY 
2009, partially offset by 2.8 percent decline 
in vintage-weighted interest expenses in FY 
2009. The weighted average of these three 
factors produces the 1.2 percent increase for 
the CIPI as a whole in FY 2009. 
IV. Proposed Changes to Payment Rates for 
Excluded Hospitals and Hospital Units: 
Rate-of-Increase Percentages 
Historically, hospitals and hospital units 
excluded from the prospective payment 
system received payment for inpatient 
hospital services they furnished on the basis 
of reasonable costs, subject to a rate-of- 
increase ceiling. An annual per discharge 
limit (the target amount as defined in 
§ 413.40(a)) was set for each hospital or 
hospital unit based on the hospital’s own 
cost experience in its base year. The target 
amount was multiplied by the Medicare 
discharges and applied as an aggregate upper 
limit (the ceiling as defined in § 413.40(a)) on 
total inpatient operating costs for a hospital’s 
cost reporting period. Prior to October 1, 
1997, these payment provisions applied 
consistently to all categories of excluded 
providers (rehabilitation hospitals and units 
(now referred to as IRFs), psychiatric 
hospitals and units (now referred to as IPFs), 
LTCHs, children’s hospitals, and cancer 
hospitals). 
Payment for services furnished in 
children’s hospitals and cancer hospitals that 
are excluded from the IPPS continues to be 
subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling based 
on the hospital’s own historical cost 
experience. (We note that, in accordance 
with § 403.752(a), RNHCIs are also subject to 
the rate-of-increase limits established under 
§ 413.40 of the regulations.) 
We are proposing that the FY 2009 rate-of- 
increase percentage for cancer and children’s 
hospitals and RNHCIs is the percentage 
increase in the FY 2009 IPPS operating 
market basket, estimated to be 3.0 percent. 
Consistent with our historical approach, if 
more recent data are available for the final 
rule, we will use those data to calculate the 
IPPS operating market basket. For this 
proposed rule, we are proposing to calculate 
the IPPS operating market basket for FY 2009 
using the most recent data available. For 
cancer and children’s hospitals and RNHCIs, 
the proposed FY 2009 rate-of-increase 
percentage that is applied to FY 2008 target 
amounts in order to calculate the proposed 
FY 2009 target amounts is based on Global 
Insight, Inc.’s 2008 forecast of the IPPS 
operating market basket increase, in 
accordance with the applicable regulations at 
42 CFR 413.40. 
IRFs, IPFs, and LTCHs were previously 
paid under the reasonable cost methodology. 
However, the statute was amended to provide 
for the implementation of prospective 
payment systems for IRFs, IPFs, and LTCHs. 
In general, the prospective payment systems 
for IRFs, IPFs, and LTCHs provide 
transitioning periods of varying lengths of 
time during which a portion of the 
prospective payment is based on cost-based 
reimbursement rules under 42 CFR Part 413 
(certain providers do not receive a 
transitioning period or may elect to bypass 
the transition as applicable under 42 CFR 
part 412, subparts N, O, and P.) We note that 
the various transitioning periods provided for 
under the IRF PPS, the IPF PPS, and the 
LTCH PPS have ended. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2002, all IRFs are paid 100 percent of the 
adjusted Federal rate under the IRF PPS. 
Therefore, for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002, no 
portion of an IRF PPS payment is subject to 
42 CFR part 413. Similarly, for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2006, all LTCHs are paid 100 percent of the 
adjusted Federal prospective payment rate 
under the LTCH PPS. Therefore, for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 2006, no portion of the LTCH PPS 
payment is subject to 42 CFR part 413. 
Likewise, for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2008, all IPFs 
are paid 100 percent of the Federal per diem 
amount under the IPF PPS. Therefore, for 
cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2008, no portion of an IPF PPS 
payment is subject to 42 CFR part 413.

The following list represents all hospitals 
that are eligible to have their wage index 
increased by the out-migration adjustment 
listed in this table. Hospitals cannot receive 
the out-migration adjustment if they are 
reclassified under section 1886(d)(10) of the 
Act or redesignated under section 
1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act. Hospitals that have 
already been reclassified under section 
1886(d)(10) of the Act or redesignated under 
section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act are 
designated with an asterisk. We will 
automatically assume that hospitals that have 
already been reclassified under section 
1886(d)(10) of the Act or redesignated under 
section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act wish to retain 
their reclassification/redesignation status and 
waive the application of the out-migration 
adjustment. Section 1886(d)(10) hospitals 
that wish to receive the out-migration 
adjustment, rather than their reclassification, 
should follow the termination/withdrawal 
procedures specified in 42 CFR 412.273 and 
section III.I.3. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule. Otherwise, they will be 
deemed to have waived the out-migration 
adjustment. Hospitals redesignated under 
section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act will be 
deemed to have waived the out-migration 
adjustment, unless they explicitly notify 
CMS that they elected to receive the out- 
migration adjustment instead within 45 days 
from the publication of this proposed rule. 
These notifications should be sent to the 
following address: Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, Center for Medicare 
Management, Attn.: Wage Index Adjustment 
Waivers, Division of Acute Care, Room C4– 
08–06, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore,

Appendix A—Regulatory Impact Analysis 
I. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
proposed rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 (September 1993, Regulatory Planning 
and Review) and the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96– 
354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security 
Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 (Pub. L. 104–4), Executive Order 13132 
on Federalism, and the Congressional Review 
Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)). 
Executive Order 12866 (as amended by 
Executive Order 13258) directs agencies to 
assess all costs and benefits of available 
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory approaches 
that maximize net benefits (including 
potential economic, environmental, public 
health and safety effects, distributive 
impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact 
analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major 
rules with economically significant effects 
($100 million or more in any 1 year). 
We have determined that this proposed 
rule is a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 
804(2). We estimate that the proposed 
changes for FY 2009 operating and capital 
payments would redistribute in excess of 
$100 million among different types of 
inpatient cases. The market basket update to 
the IPPS rates required by the statute, in 
conjunction with other payment changes in 
this proposed rule, would result in an 
approximate $4 billion increase in FY 2009 
operating and capital payments. Our impact 
estimate includes the ¥0.9 percent 
adjustment for documentation and coding 
changes to the IPPS standardized amounts 
and capital Federal rates for FY 2009 in 
accordance with section 7 of Pub. L. 110–90. 
For purposes of the impact analysis, we also 
assume an additional 1.8 percent increase in 
case-mix between FY 2008 and FY 2009 
because we believe the adoption of the MS– 
DRGs will result in case-mix growth due to 
documentation and coding changes that do 
not reflect real changes in patient severity of 
illness. The estimates of IPPS operating 
payments do not reflect any changes in 
hospital admissions or real case-mix 
intensity, which would also affect overall 
payment changes. 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
businesses. For purposes of the RFA, small 
entities include small businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and small government 
jurisdictions. Most hospitals and most other 
providers and suppliers are considered to be 
small entities, either by being nonprofit 
organizations or by meeting the Small 
Business Administration definition of a small 
business (having revenues of $31.5 million or 
less in any 1 year). (For details on the latest 
standards for heath care providers, we refer 
readers to page 33 of the Table of Small 
Business Size Standards at the Small 
Business Administration Web site at: http:// 
www.sba.gov/services/
contractingopportunities/
sizestandardstopics/tableofsize/index.html.) 
For purposes of the RFA, all hospitals and 
other providers and suppliers are considered 
to be small entities. Individuals and States 
are not included in the definition of a small 
entity. We believe that this proposed rule 
would have a significant impact on small 
entities as explained in this Appendix. 
Because we acknowledge that many of the 
affected entities are small entities, the 
analysis discussed throughout the preamble 
of this proposed rule constitutes our initial 
regulatory flexibility analysis. Therefore, we 
are soliciting comments on our estimates and 
analysis of the impact of the proposed rule 
on those small entities. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 
requires us to prepare a regulatory impact

23906 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
analysis for any proposed or final rule that 
may have a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of small 
rural hospitals. This analysis must conform 
to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. 
With the exception of hospitals located in 
certain New England counties, for purposes 
of section 1102(b) of the Act, we now define 
a small rural hospital as a hospital that is 
located outside of an urban area and has 
fewer than 100 beds. Section 601(g) of the 
Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 
98–21) designated hospitals in certain New 
England counties as belonging to the adjacent 
urban area. Thus, for purposes of the IPPS, 
we continue to classify these hospitals as 
urban hospitals. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4) also 
requires that agencies assess anticipated costs 
and benefits before issuing any rule whose 
mandates require spending in any 1 year of 
$100 million in 1995 dollars, updated 
annually for inflation. That threshold level is 
currently approximately $130 million. This 
proposed rule will not mandate any 
requirements for State, local, or tribal 
governments, nor will it affect private sector 
costs. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes certain 
requirements that an agency must meet when 
it promulgates a proposed rule (and 
subsequent final rule) that imposes 
substantial direct requirement costs on State 
and local governments, preempts State law, 
or otherwise has Federalism implications. As 
stated above, this proposed rule would not 
have a substantial effect on State and local 
governments. 
The following analysis, in conjunction 
with the remainder of this document, 
demonstrates that this proposed rule is 
consistent with the regulatory philosophy 
and principles identified in Executive Order 
12866, the RFA, and section 1102(b) of the 
Act. The proposed rule would affect 
payments to a substantial number of small 
rural hospitals, as well as other classes of 
hospitals, and the effects on some hospitals 
may be significant. 
II. Objectives 
The primary objective of the IPPS is to 
create incentives for hospitals to operate 
efficiently and minimize unnecessary costs 
while at the same time ensuring that 
payments are sufficient to adequately 
compensate hospitals for their legitimate 
costs. In addition, we share national goals of 
preserving the Medicare Hospital Insurance 
Trust Fund. 
We believe the proposed changes in this 
proposed rule would further each of these 
goals while maintaining the financial 
viability of the hospital industry and 
ensuring access to high quality health care 
for Medicare beneficiaries. We expect that 
these proposed changes would ensure that 
the outcomes of this payment system are 
reasonable and equitable while avoiding or 
minimizing unintended adverse 
consequences. 
III. Limitations of Our Analysis 
The following quantitative analysis 
presents the projected effects of our proposed 
policy changes, as well as statutory changes 
effective for FY 2009, on various hospital 
groups. We estimate the effects of individual 
proposed policy changes by estimating 
payments per case while holding all other 
payment policies constant. We use the best 
data available, but, generally, we do not 
attempt to make adjustments for future 
changes in such variables as admissions, 
lengths of stay, or case-mix. However, in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule, we indicated that we 
believe that implementation of the MS–DRGs 
would lead to increases in case-mix that do 
not reflect actual increases in patients’ 
severity of illness as a result of more 
comprehensive documentation and coding. 
As explained in section II.D. of the preamble 
of this proposed rule, the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period established a 
documentation and coding adjustment of 
¥1.2 percent for FY 2008, ¥1.8 percent for 
FY 2009, and ¥1.8 percent for FY 2010 to 
maintain budget neutrality for the transition 
to the MS DRGs. Subsequently, Congress 
enacted Pub. L. 110–90. Section 7 of Public 
L. 110–90 reduced the IPPS documentation 
and coding adjustment from ¥1.2 percent to 
¥0.6 percent for FY 2008 and from ¥1.8 
percent to ¥0.9 percent for FY 2009. 
Following enactment of Pub. L. 110–90, we 
revised the FY 2008 standardized amounts 
(as well as other affected payment factors and 
thresholds) to reflect the ¥0.6 percent FY 
2008 documentation and coding adjustment. 
The proposed FY 2009 IPPS national 
standardized amount included in this 
proposed rule reflects the documentation and 
coding adjustment of ¥0.9 percent for FY 
2009. While we have adopted the statutorily 
mandated documentation and coding 
adjustments for payment purposes, we 
continue to believe that an increase in case- 
mix of 1.8 percent between FY 2008 and FY 
2009 is likely as a result of the adoption of 
the MS DRGs. The impacts shown below 
illustrate the impact of the FY 2009 IPPS 
changes on hospital operating payments, 
including the ¥0.9 percent FY 2009 
documentation and coding adjustment to the 
IPPS national standardized amounts, both 
prior to and following the expected 1.8 
percent growth in case-mix between FY 2008 
and FY 2009. As we have done in the 
previous rules, we are soliciting comments 
and information about the anticipated effects 
of the proposed changes on hospitals and our 
methodology for estimating them. 
IV. Hospitals Included in and Excluded 
From the IPPS 
The prospective payment systems for 
hospital inpatient operating and capital- 
related costs encompass most general short- 
term, acute care hospitals that participate in 
the Medicare program. There were 35 Indian 
Health Service hospitals in our database, 
which we excluded from the analysis due to 
the special characteristics of the prospective 
payment methodology for these hospitals. 
Among other short-term, acute care hospitals, 
only the 46 such hospitals in Maryland 
remain excluded from the IPPS under the 
waiver at section 1814(b)(3) of the Act. 
As of March 2008, there are 3,528 IPPS 
hospitals to be included in our analysis. This 
represents about 58 percent of all Medicare- 
participating hospitals. The majority of this 
impact analysis focuses on this set of 
hospitals. There are also approximately 1,311 
CAHs. These small, limited service hospitals 
are paid on the basis of reasonable costs 
rather than under the IPPS. There are also 
1,219 specialty hospitals and 2,291 specialty 
units that are excluded from the IPPS. These 
specialty hospitals include IPFs, IRFs, 
LTCHs, RNHCIs, children’s hospitals, and 
cancer hospitals. Changes in payments for 
IPFs and IRFs are made through other 
separate rulemaking. Payment impacts for 
these specialty hospitals and units are not 
included in this proposed rule. There is also 
a separate rule to update and make changes 
to the LTCH PPS for its current July 1 
through June 30 rate year (RY). However, we 
have traditionally used the IPPS rule to 
update the LTCH patient classifications and 
relative weights because the LTCH PPS uses 
the same DRGs as the IPPS, resulting in the 
LTCH relative weights being reclassified and 
recalibrated according to the same schedule 
as the IPPS (that is, for each Federal fiscal 
year). The impacts of our policy changes on 
LTCHs, where applicable, are discussed 
below. (We note that, as discussed in section 
II.I. of the preamble of this proposed rule, in 
the RY 2009 LTCH PPS proposed rule 73 FR 
5351 through 5352), we proposed to move 
the annual LTCH PPS RY update (currently 
effective July 1) to be effective October 1 
through September 30 (the Federal fiscal 
year) each year beginning October 1, 2009. 
Under this proposal, RY 2009 would be 
extended 3 months, such that RY 2009 would 
be the 15-month period of July 1, 2008 
through September 30, 2009.) 
V. Effects on Excluded Hospitals and 
Hospital Units 
As of March 2008, there were 1,219 
hospitals excluded from the IPPS. Of these 
1,219 hospitals, 314 IPFs, 78 children’s 
hospitals, 11 cancer hospitals, and 19 
RNHCIs are either being paid on a reasonable 
cost basis or have a portion of the PPS 
payment based on reasonable cost principles 
subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling under 
§ 413.40. The remaining providers, 221 IRFs, 
394 LTCHs, and 182 IPFs, are paid 100 
percent of the Federal prospective rate under 
the IRF PPS and the LTCH PPS, respectively, 
or 100 percent of the Federal per diem 
amount under the IPF PPS. As stated above, 
IRFs and IPFs are not affected by this 
proposed rule. The impacts of the changes to 
LTCHs are discussed separately below. In 
addition, there are 1,319 IPFs co-located in 
hospitals otherwise subject to the IPPS, 788 
of which are paid on a blend of the IPF PPS 
per diem payment and the reasonable cost- 
based payment. The remaining 531 IPF units 
are paid 100 percent of the Federal amount 
under the IPF PPS. There are 972 IRFs (paid 
under the IRF PPS) co-located in hospitals 
otherwise subject to the IPPS. 
In the past, hospitals and units excluded 
from the IPPS have been paid based on their 
reasonable costs subject to limits as 
established by the Tax Equity and Fiscal 
Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). 
Hospitals that continue to be paid fully on a 
reasonable cost basis are subject to TEFRA 
limits for FY 2009. For these hospitals

23907 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
(cancer and children’s hospitals), consistent 
with section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, we 
are proposing an update that is the 
percentage increase in the FY 2009 IPPS 
operating market basket, which is estimated 
to be 3.0 percent, based on Global Insights, 
Inc.’s 2008 first quarter forecast of the IPPS 
operating market basket increase. In addition, 
in accordance with § 403.752(a) of the 
regulations, RNHCIs are paid under § 413.40, 
which also uses section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of 
the Act to update target amounts by the rate- 
of-increase percentage. For RNHCIs, the 
proposed update is the percentage increase in 
the FY 2009 IPPS operating market basket 
increase, which is estimated to be 3.0 
percent, based on Global Insight, Inc.’s 2008 
first quarter forecast of the IPPS operating 
market basket increase. 
The final rule implementing the IPF PPS 
(69 FR 66922) established a 3-year transition 
to the IPF PPS during which some providers 
received a blend of the IPF PPS per diem 
payment and the TEFRA reasonable cost- 
based payment. This transitional period for a 
blended payment amount for IPFs ended for 
cost reporting periods that began on or after 
January 1, 2008. Because the reasonable cost- 
based amount is zero percent for cost 
reporting periods beginning during CY 2008, 
no IPF will have a portion of its PPS payment 
that is based in part on reasonable cost 
subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling during 
FY 2009. Thus, there is no longer a need for 
an update factor for IPFs’ TEFRA target 
amount for FY 2009 and thereafter. 
The impact on excluded hospitals and 
hospital units of the proposed update in the 
rate-of-increase limit depends on the 
cumulative cost increases experienced by 
each excluded hospital or unit since its 
applicable base period. For excluded 
hospitals and units that have maintained 
their cost increases at a level below the rate- 
of-increase limits since their base period, the 
major effect is on the level of incentive 
payments these hospitals and hospital units 
receive. Conversely, for excluded hospitals 
and hospital units with per-case cost 
increases above the cumulative update in 
their rate-of-increase limits, the major effect 
is the amount of excess costs that will not be 
reimbursed. 
We note that, under § 413.40(d)(3), an 
excluded hospital or unit whose costs exceed 
110 percent of its rate-of-increase limit 
receives its rate-of-increase limit plus 50 
percent of the difference between its 
reasonable costs and 110 percent of the limit, 
not to exceed 110 percent of its limit. In 
addition, under the various provisions set 
forth in § 413.40, certain excluded hospitals 
and hospital units can obtain payment 
adjustments for justifiable increases in 
operating costs that exceed the limit. 
VI. Quantitative Effects of the Proposed 
Policy Changes Under the IPPS for 
Operating Costs 
A. Basis and Methodology of Estimates 
In this proposed rule, we are announcing 
proposed policy changes and payment rate 
updates for the IPPS for operating costs. 
Changes to the capital payments are 
discussed in section VIII. of this Appendix. 
Based on the overall percentage change in 
payments per case estimated using our 
payment simulation model, we estimate that 
total FY 2009 operating payments will 
increase 4.1 percent compared to FY 2008, 
largely due to the statutorily mandated 
update to the IPPS rates. This amount also 
reflects the ¥0.9 percent FY 2009 
documentation and coding adjustment to the 
IPPS national standardized amounts and our 
assumption of an additional 1.8 percent 
increase in case-mix between FY 2008 and 
FY 2009 as a result of improvements in 
documentation and coding that do not 
represent real increases in underlying 
resource demands and patient acuity due to 
the adoption of the MS–DRGs. The impacts 
do not illustrate changes in hospital 
admissions or real case-mix intensity, which 
will also affect overall payment changes. 
We have prepared separate impact analyses 
of the changes to each system. This section 
deals with changes to the operating 
prospective payment system. Our payment 
simulation model relies on the most recent 
available data to enable us to estimate the 
impacts on payments per case of certain 
changes in this proposed rule. However, 
there are other changes for which we do not 
have data available that would allow us to 
estimate the payment impacts using this 
model. For those changes, we have attempted 
to predict the payment impacts based upon 
our experience and other more limited data. 
The data used in developing the 
quantitative analyses of changes in payments 
per case presented below are taken from the 
FY 2007 MedPAR file and the most current 
Provider-Specific File that is used for 
payment purposes. Although the analyses of 
the changes to the operating PPS do not 
incorporate cost data, data from the most 
recently available hospital cost report were 
used to categorize hospitals. Our analysis has 
several qualifications. First, in this analysis, 
we do not make adjustments for future 
changes in such variables as admissions, 
lengths of stay, or underlying growth in real 
case-mix. Second, due to the interdependent 
nature of the IPPS payment components, it is 
very difficult to precisely quantify the impact 
associated with each change. Third, we use 
various sources for the data used to 
categorize hospitals in the tables. In some 
cases, particularly the number of beds, there 
is a fair degree of variation in the data from 
different sources. We have attempted to 
construct these variables with the best 
available source overall. However, for 
individual hospitals, some 
miscategorizations are possible. 
Using cases from the FY 2007 MedPAR 
file, we simulated payments under the 
operating IPPS given various combinations of 
payment parameters. Any short-term, acute 
care hospitals not paid under the IPPS 
(Indian Health Service hospitals and 
hospitals in Maryland) were excluded from 
the simulations. The impact of payments 
under the capital IPPS, or the impact of 
payments for costs other than inpatient 
operating costs, are not analyzed in this 
section. Estimated payment impacts of FY 
2009 changes to the capital IPPS are 
discussed in section VIII. of this Appendix. 
The changes discussed separately below 
are the following: 
• The effects of the annual reclassification 
of diagnoses and procedures, full 
implementation of the MS–DRG system and 
100 percent cost-based DRG relative weights, 
• The effects of the changes in hospitals’ 
wage index values reflecting wage data from 
hospitals’ cost reporting periods beginning 
during FY 2005, compared to the FY 2004 
wage data. 
• The effects of the recalibration of the 
DRG relative weights as required by section 
1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act, including the wage 
and recalibration budget neutrality factors. 
• The effects of geographic 
reclassifications by the MGCRB that will be 
effective in FY 2009. 
• The effects of the proposal to apply the 
rural floor budget neutrality adjustment at 
the State level, redistributing payments 
within the State, rather than adjusting 
payments to hospitals in other States. 
• The effects of the proposal to apply the 
imputed rural floor budget neutrality 
adjustment to the wage index at the State- 
level, rather than applying it to the 
standardized amount at the national level. 
• The effects of section 505 of Pub. L. 108– 
173, which provides for an increase in a 
hospital’s wage index if the hospital qualifies 
by meeting a threshold percentage of 
residents of the county where the hospital is 
located who commute to work at hospitals in 
counties with higher wage indexes. 
• The effect of the budget neutrality 
adjustment being made for the adoption of 
the MS–DRGs under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iv) 
of the Act for the change in aggregate 
payments that is a result of changes in the 
coding or classification of discharges that do 
not reflect real changes in case-mix. 
• The total estimated change in payments 
based on the proposed FY 2009 policies 
relative to payments based on FY 2008 
policies. 
To illustrate the impacts of the proposed 
FY 2009 changes, our analysis begins with a 
FY 2008 baseline simulation model using: 
the proposed FY 2009 update of 3.0 percent; 
the FY 2008 DRG GROUPER (Version 25.0); 
the most current CBSA designations for 
hospitals based on OMB’s MSA definitions; 
the FY 2008 wage index; and no MGCRB 
reclassifications. Outlier payments are set at 
5.1 percent of total operating DRG and outlier 
payments. 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act, as 
added by section 5001(a) of Pub. L. 109–171, 
provides that for FY 2007 and subsequent 
years, the update factor will be reduced by 
2.0 percentage points for any hospital that 
does not submit quality data in a form and 
manner and at a time specified by the 
Secretary. At the time this impact was 
prepared, 186 providers did not receive the 
full market basket rate-of-increase for FY 
2008 because they failed the quality data 
submission process. For purposes of the 
simulations shown below, we modeled the 
proposed payment changes for FY 2009 using 
a reduced update for these 186 hospitals. 
However, we do not have enough 
information to determine which hospitals 
will not receive the full market basket rate- 
of-increase for FY 2009 at this time. 
Each policy change, statutorily or 
otherwise, is then added incrementally to

this baseline, finally arriving at an FY 2009 
model incorporating all of the proposed 
changes. This simulation allows us to isolate 
the effects of each proposed change. 
Our final comparison illustrates the 
proposed percent change in payments per 
case from FY 2008 to FY 2009. Three factors 
not discussed separately have significant 
impacts here. The first is the update to the 
standardized amount. In accordance with 
section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, we are 
updating the standardized amounts for FY 
2009 using the most recently forecasted 
hospital market basket increase for FY 2009 
of 3.0 percent. (Hospitals that fail to comply 
with the quality data submission 
requirements to receive the full update will 
receive an update reduced by 2.0 percentage 
points to 1.0 percent.) Under section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, the updates to 
the hospital-specific amounts for SCHs and 
for MDHs are also equal to the market basket 
increase, or 3.0 percent. 
A second significant factor that affects the 
proposed changes in hospitals’ payments per 
case from FY 2008 to FY 2009 is the change 
in a hospital’s geographic reclassification 
status from one year to the next. That is, 
payments may be reduced for hospitals 
reclassified in FY 2008 that are no longer 
reclassified in FY 2009. Conversely, 
payments may increase for hospitals not 
reclassified in FY 2008 that are reclassified 
in FY 2009. Particularly with the expiration 
of section 508 of Pub. L. 108–173, the 
reclassification provision, these impacts can 
be quite substantial, so if a relatively small 
number of hospitals in a particular category 
lose their reclassification status, the 
percentage change in payments for the 
category may be below the national mean. 
A third significant factor is that we 
currently estimate that actual outlier 
payments during FY 2008 will be 4.8 percent 
of total DRG payments. When the FY 2008 
final rule was published, we projected FY 
2008 outlier payments would be 5.1 percent 
of total DRG plus outlier payments; the 
average standardized amounts were offset 
correspondingly. The effects of the lower 
than expected outlier payments during FY 
2009 (as discussed in the Addendum to this 
proposed rule) are reflected in the analyses 
below comparing our current estimates of FY 
2008 payments per case to estimated FY 2009 
payments per case (with outlier payments 
projected to equal 5.1 percent of total DRG 
payments). 
B. Analysis of Table I 
Table I displays the results of our analysis 
of the proposed changes for FY 2009. The 
table categorizes hospitals by various 
geographic and special payment 
consideration groups to illustrate the varying 
impacts on different types of hospitals. The 
top row of the table shows the overall impact 
on the 3,528 hospitals included in the 
analysis. 
The next four rows of Table I contain 
hospitals categorized according to their 
geographic location: all urban, which is 
further divided into large urban and other 
urban; and rural. There are 2,542 hospitals 
located in urban areas included in our 
analysis. Among these, there are 1,402 
hospitals located in large urban areas 
(populations over 1 million), and 1,140 
hospitals in other urban areas (populations of 
1 million or fewer). In addition, there are 986 
hospitals in rural areas. The next two 
groupings are by bed-size categories, shown 
separately for urban and rural hospitals. The 
final groupings by geographic location are by 
census divisions, also shown separately for 
urban and rural hospitals. 
The second part of Table I shows hospital 
groups based on hospitals’ FY 2009 payment 
classifications, including any 
reclassifications under section 1886(d)(10) of 
the Act. For example, the rows labeled urban, 
large urban, other urban, and rural show that 
the number of hospitals paid based on these 
categorizations after consideration of 
geographic reclassifications (including 
reclassifications under section 1886(d)(8)(B) 
and section 1886(d)(8)(E) of the Act that have 
implications for capital payments) are 2,584, 
1,424, 1,160 and 944, respectively. 
The next three groupings examine the 
impacts of the proposed changes on hospitals 
grouped by whether or not they have GME 
residency programs (teaching hospitals that 
receive an IME adjustment) or receive DSH 
payments, or some combination of these two 
adjustments. There are 2,485 nonteaching 
hospitals in our analysis, 805 teaching 
hospitals with fewer than 100 residents, and 
238 teaching hospitals with 100 or more 
residents. 
In the DSH categories, hospitals are 
grouped according to their DSH payment 
status, and whether they are considered 
urban or rural for DSH purposes. The next 
category groups together hospitals considered 
urban after geographic reclassification, in 
terms of whether they receive the IME 
adjustment, the DSH adjustment, both, or 
neither. 
The next five rows examine the impacts of 
the proposed changes on rural hospitals by 
special payment groups (SCHs, RRCs, and 
MDHs). There were 197 RRCs, 355 SCHs, 156 
MDHs, 102 hospitals that are both SCHs and 
RRCs, and 12 hospitals that are both an MDH 
and an RRC. 
The next series of groupings are based on 
the type of ownership and the hospital’s 
Medicare utilization expressed as a percent 
of total patient days. These data were taken 
from the FY 2005 Medicare cost reports. 
The next two groupings concern the 
geographic reclassification status of 
hospitals. The first grouping displays all 
urban hospitals that were reclassified by the 
MGCRB for FY 2009. The second grouping 
shows the MGCRB rural reclassifications. 
The final category shows the impact of the 
proposed policy changes on the 20 cardiac 
specialty hospitals in our analysis.

1 Because data necessary to classify some hospitals by category were missing, the total number of hospitals in each category may not equal the national total. Dis-
charge data are from FY 2007, and hospital cost report data are from reporting periods beginning in FY 2006 and FY 2005. 
2 This column displays the payment impact of the changes to the V26 GROUPER and the recalibration of the DRG weights based on FY 2007 MedPAR data in ac-
cordance with section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act. 
3 This column displays the payment impact of updating the wage index data to the FY 2005 cost report data. 
4 This column displays the combined payment impact of the changes in column 2 and column 3 and the budget neutrality factors for DRG and wage index changes 
in accordance with section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act and section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act. 
5 Shown here are the effects of geographic reclassifications by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board (MGCRB). The effects demonstrate the FY 
2009 payment impact of going from no reclassifications to the reclassifications scheduled to be in effect for FY 2008. Reclassification for prior years has no bearing 
on the payment impacts shown here. This column reflects the geographic budget neutrality factor of 0.992333. 
6 This column displays the effects of the rural floor and the imputed rural floor, including the proposal to apply the budget neutrality adjustment within State. 
7 This column displays the impact of section 505 of Pub. L. 108–173, which provides for an increase in a hospital’s wage index if the hospital qualifies by meeting a 
threshold percentage of residents of the county where the hospital is located who commute to work at hospitals in counties with higher wage indexes. 
8 This column shows changes in payments from FY 2008 to FY 2009, including the proposed FY 2009 ¥0.9 percent documentation and coding adjustment, but not 
the projected 1.8 percent increase in case-mix expected to occur in FY 2009 due to improvements in documentation and coding. It incorporates all of the changes 
displayed in Columns 4, 5, 6, 7 (the changes displayed in Columns 2 and 3 are included in Column 4). It also reflects the impact of the FY 2009 update, and changes 
in hospitals’ reclassification status in FY 2009 compared to FY 2008. 
9 This column shows changes in payments from FY 2008 to FY 2009 including the proposed FY 2009 ¥0.9 percent documentation and coding adjustment and the 
projected 1.8 percent increase in case-mix expected to occur in FY 2009 due to improvements in documentation and coding. It incorporates all of the changes dis-
played in Columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (the changes displayed in Columns 2 and 3 are included in Column 4). It also reflects the impact of the FY 2008 update, and changes 
in hospitals’ reclassification status in FY 2009 compared to FY 2008. The sum of these impacts may be different from the percentage changes shown here due to 
rounding and interactive effects. 
C. Effects of the Proposed Changes to the 
MS–DRG Reclassifications and Relative Cost- 
Based Weights (Column 2) 
In Column 2 of Table I, we present the 
effects of the DRG reclassifications, as 
discussed in section II. of the preamble to 
this proposed rule. Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(i) of 
the Act requires us annually to make 
appropriate classification changes in order to 
reflect changes in treatment patterns, 
technology, and any other factors that may 
change the relative use of hospital resources. 
As discussed in the preamble of this 
proposed rule, the FY2009 DRG relative 
weights will be 100 percent cost-based and 
100 percent MS–DRGs, thus completing our 
three year transition to cost-based relative 
weights and our two year transition to MS– 
DRGs. For FY 2009, the MS–DRGs are 
calculated using the FY2007 MedPAR data 
grouped to the Version 26.0 (FY2009) DRGs. 
The proposed methods of calculating the 
relative weights and the reclassification 
changes to the GROUPER are described in 
more detail in section II.H. of the preamble 
to this proposed rule. In previous years, this 
column would also reflect the effects of the 
recalibration budget neutrality factor that is 
applied to the hospital-specific rates and the 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount. 
However, for this proposed rule, we show the 
effects of the recalibration budget neutrality 
factor of 0.998700 in column 4. We note that, 
consistent with section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of 
the Act, we are applying a budget neutrality 
factor to the national standardized amounts 
to ensure that the overall payment impact of 
the DRG changes (combined with the wage 
index changes) is budget neutral. This 
proposed wage and recalibration budget 
neutrality factor of 0.99525 is applied to 
payments in Column 4 and not Column 2. 
The proposed changes to the relative 
weights and DRGs shown in column 2 are 
prior to any offset for budget neutrality. The 
‘‘All Hospitals’’ line indicates that proposed 
changes in this column will increase 
payments by 0.1 percent. However, as stated 
earlier, the proposed changes shown in this 
column are combined with revisions to the 
wage index, and the budget neutrality 
adjustments made for these changes are 
shown in column 4. Thus, the impact after 
accounting only for budget neutrality for 
proposed changes to the DRG relative 
weights and classification is somewhat lower 
than the figures shown in this column 
(approximately 0.1 percent). 
D. Effects of Proposed Wage Index Changes 
(Column 3) 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires 
that, beginning October 1, 1993, we annually 
update the wage data used to calculate the 
wage index. In accordance with this 
requirement, the wage index for FY 2009 is 
based on data submitted for hospital cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 2004 and before October 1, 2005. 
The estimated impact of the proposed wage 
data on hospital payments is isolated in 
Column 3 by holding the other payment 
parameters constant in this simulation. That 
is, Column 3 shows the percentage changes 
in payments when going from a model using 
the FY 2008 wage index, based on FY 2004 
wage data and having a 100-percent 
occupational mix adjustment applied, to a 
model using the FY 2009 pre-reclassification 
wage index, also having a 100-percent 
occupational mix adjustment applied, based 
on FY 2005 wage data (while holding other 
payment parameters such as use of the 
version 26.0 DRG grouper constant). The 
wage data collected on the FY 2005 cost 
report include overhead costs for contract 
labor that were not collected on FY 2004 and 
earlier cost reports. The impacts below 
incorporate the effects of the FY 2005 wage 
data collected on hospital cost reports, 
including additional overhead costs for 
contract labor compared to the wage data 
from FY 2004 cost reports that were used to 
calculate the FY 2008 wage index. 
Column 3 shows the impacts of updating 
the wage data using FY 2004 cost reports. 
Overall, the new wage data will lead to a 
¥0.1 percent change for all hospitals before 
application of the wage and DRG 
recalibration budget neutrality adjustment 
shown in column 4. Thus, the figures in this 
column are approximately 0.1 below what 
they otherwise would be if they also 
illustrated a budget neutrality adjustment 
solely for changes to the wage index. Among 
the regions, the largest increase is in the 
urban Pacific region, which experiences a 0.9 
percent increase before applying an 
adjustment for budget neutrality. The largest 
decline from updating the wage data is seen 
in Puerto Rico (0.7 percent decrease). 
In looking at the wage data itself, the 
national average hourly wage increased 4.2 
percent compared to FY 2008. Therefore, the 
only manner in which to maintain or exceed

the previous year’s wage index was to match 
or exceed the national 4.2 percent increase in 
average hourly wage. Of the 3,457 hospitals 
with wage data for both FYs 2008 and 2009, 
1,707, or 49.4 percent, experienced an 
average hourly wage increase of 4.2 percent 
or more. 
The following chart compares the shifts in 
wage index values for hospitals for FY 2009 
relative to FY 2008. Among urban hospitals, 
32 will experience an increase of more than 
5 percent and less than 10 percent and 5 will 
experience an increase of more than 10 
percent. Among rural hospitals, none will 
experience an increase of more than 5 
percent and less than 10 percent, and none 
will experience an increase of more than 10 
percent. However, 972 rural hospitals will 
experience increases or decreases of less than 
5 percent, while 2,420 urban hospitals will 
experience increases or decreases of less than 
5 percent. Eighteen urban hospitals will 
experience decreases in their wage index 
values of more than 5 percent and less than 
10 percent. Ten urban hospitals will 
experience decreases in their wage index 
values of greater than 10 percent. No rural 
hospitals will experience decreases of more 
than 5 percent. These figures reflect changes 
in the wage index which is an adjustment to 
either 69.7 percent or 62 percent of a 
hospital’s standardized amount depending 
upon whether its wage index is greater than 
1.0 or less than or equal to 1.0. Therefore, 
these figures are illustrating a somewhat 
larger change in the wage index than would 
occur to the hospital’s total payment. 
The following chart shows the projected 
impact for urban and rural hospitals.

E. Combined Effects of Proposed MS–DRG 
and Wage Index Changes (Column 4) 
Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act 
requires that changes to MS–DRG 
reclassifications and the relative weights 
cannot increase or decrease aggregate 
payments. In addition, section 1886(d)(3)(E) 
of the Act specifies that any updates or 
adjustments to the wage index are to be 
budget neutral. As noted in the Addendum 
to this proposed rule, in determining the 
budget neutrality factor, we equated 
simulated aggregate payments for FY 2008 
and FY 2009 using the FY 2007 Medicare 
utilization data after applying the changes to 
the DRG relative weights and the wage index. 
We computed a wage and MS–DRG 
recalibration budget neutrality factor of 
0.999525 (which is applied to the national 
standardized amounts) and a recalibration 
budget neutrality factor 0.998700 (which is 
applied to the hospital-specific rates and the 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount). 
The 0.0 percent impact for all hospitals 
demonstrates that the proposed MS–DRG and 
wage changes, in combination with the 
budget neutrality factor, are budget neutral. 
In Table I, the combined overall impacts of 
the effects of both the MS–DRG 
reclassifications and the updated wage index 
are shown in Column 4. The estimated 
changes shown in this column reflect the 
combined effects of the changes in Columns 
2 and 3 and the budget neutrality factors 
discussed previously. 
We estimate that the combined impact of 
the proposed changes to the relative weights 
and DRGs and the updated wage data with 
budget neutrality applied will increase 
payments to hospitals located in large urban 
areas (populations over 1 million) by 
approximately 0.3. These proposed changes 
would generally increase payments to 
hospitals in all urban areas (0.1 percent) and 
large teaching hospitals (0.2 percent). Rural 
hospitals will generally experience a 
decrease in payments (¥1.1 percent). Among 
the rural hospital categories, rural hospitals 
with less than 50 beds will experience the 
greatest decline in payment (¥2.3 percent) 
primarily due to the changes to MS–DRGs 
and the relative cost weights. 
F. Effects of MGCRB Reclassifications 
(Column 5) 
Our impact analysis to this point has 
assumed hospitals are paid on the basis of 
their actual geographic location (with the 
exception of ongoing policies that provide 
that certain hospitals receive payments on 
other bases than where they are 
geographically located). The proposed 
changes in Column 5 reflect the per case 
payment impact of moving from this baseline 
to a simulation incorporating the MGCRB 
decisions for FY 2009 which affect hospitals’ 
wage index area assignments. 
By February 28 of each year, the MGCRB 
makes reclassification determinations that 
will be effective for the next fiscal year, 
which begins on October 1. The MGCRB may 
approve a hospital’s reclassification request 
for the purpose of using another area’s wage 
index value. Hospitals may appeal denials of 
MGCRB decisions to the CMS Administrator. 
Further, hospitals have 45 days from 
publication of the IPPS rule in the Federal 
Register to decide whether to withdraw or 
terminate an approved geographic 
reclassification for the following year. This 
column reflects all MGCRB decisions, 
Administrator appeals and decisions of 
hospitals for FY 2009 geographic 
reclassifications. 
The overall effect of geographic 
reclassification is required by section 
1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act to be budget neutral. 
Therefore, we are proposing to apply an 
adjustment of 0.992333 to ensure that the 
effects of the section 1886(d)(10) 
reclassifications are budget neutral. (See 
section II.A. of the Addendum to this 
proposed rule.) Geographic reclassification 
generally benefits hospitals in rural areas. We 
estimate that geographic reclassification will 
increase payments to rural hospitals by an 
average of 2.1 percent. 
G. Effects of the Proposed Rural Floor and 
Imputed Rural Floor, Including the Proposed 
Application of Budget Neutrality at the State 
Level (Column 6) 
As discussed in section III.B. of the 
preamble of this FY 2009 proposed rule, 
section 4410 of Pub. L. 105–33 established 
the rural floor by requiring that the wage 
index for a hospital in any urban area cannot 
be less than the area wage index determined 
for the state’s rural area. In FY 2008, we 
changed how we applied budget neutrality to 
the rural floor. Rather than applying a budget 
neutrality adjustment to the standardized 
amount, a uniform budget neutrality 
adjustment is applied to the wage index. For 
FY 2009, we are proposing to apply the rural 
floor budget neutrality adjustment at the 
State level, which would redistribute 
payments within the State rather than across 
all other providers within the Nation. 
Furthermore, the FY 2005 IPPS final rule 
(69 FR 49109) established a temporary 
imputed rural floor for all urban States from 
FY 2005 to FY 2007. The rural floor requires 
that an urban wage index cannot be lower 
than the wage index for any rural hospital in 
that State. Therefore, an imputed rural floor 
was established for States that do not have 
rural areas or rural IPPS hospitals. In the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule with comment period 
(72 FR 47321), we finalized our rule to 
extend the imputed rural floor for 1 
additional year. In this proposed rule, we are 
proposing to extend the imputed rural floor 
for an additional 3 years through FY 2011. 
Furthermore, consistent with our proposal to 
apply the rural floor budget neutrality 
adjustment at the State level, we are 
proposing to apply the imputed rural floor 
budget neutrality adjustment to the wage 
index at the State level. 
Column 6 shows the projected impact of 
the rural floor and the imputed rural floor, 
including the proposed application of the 
budget neutrality adjustment at the State 
level. The column compares the post- 
reclassification FY 2009 wage index of 
providers before the rural floor adjustment 
and the post-reclassification FY 2009 wage 
index of providers with the rural floor and

imputed rural floor adjustment. Only urban 
hospitals can benefit from the rural floor 
provision. Because the provision is budget 
neutral, in prior years, all other hospitals 
(that is, all rural hospitals and those urban 
hospitals to which the adjustment is not 
made) had experienced a decrease in 
payments due to the budget neutrality 
adjustment applied nationally. However, 
under this proposal, States that have no 
hospitals receiving a rural floor wage index 
would no longer have a negative budget 
neutrality adjustment applied to their wage 
indices. Conversely, all hospitals in States 
with hospitals receiving a rural floor would 
have their wage indices downwardly 
adjusted to achieve budget neutrality within 
the State. 
We project that, in aggregate, rural 
hospitals will experience a 0.1 percent 
decrease in payments. We project hospitals 
located in other urban areas (populations of 
1 million or fewer) will experience a 0.1 
percent increase in payments because the 
rural floor adjustment applies to urban 
hospitals. Rural New England hospitals can 
expect the greatest decrease in payment by 
0.9 percent because hospitals in Vermont 
will receive a rural floor budget neutrality 
adjustment of 0.901 or a reduction of 
approximately 10 percent, and hospitals in 
Connecticut will receive a rural floor budget 
neutrality adjustment of 0.9639 or a 
reduction of approximately 4 percent. New 
Jersey, which is the only State that benefits 
from the imputed rural floor, is expected to 
receive a rural floor budget neutrality 
adjustment of 0.987838 or a reduction of 
approximately 1.2 percent. 
The table that appears in section III B.2.b. 
of the preamble of this proposed rule shows 
how payments would change, at the State 
level, if we moved from our current policy 
of applying rural floor budget neutrality at 
the national level to our proposed policy to 
apply the rural floor budget neutrality within 
the State. The table shows that, under our 
current policy of applying budget neutrality 
at the national level, States that do not have 
any hospitals receiving the rural floor wage 
index would expect a decrease in payments 
because, in order to maintain budget 
neutrality nationally, these hospitals have to 
pay for the hospitals in other States that do 
receive a rural floor. For example, States such 
as Arizona, New York, and Rhode Island, 
which do not have hospitals receiving a rural 
floor, would expect to lose 0.2 percent in 
payments under a national rural floor budget 
neutrality adjustment. However, under our 
proposed policy to apply rural floor budget 
neutrality within each State, States that do 
not have hospitals receiving a floor would 
see an increase in payments (compared with 
our current policy of applying budget 
neutrality at the national level) because they 
would no longer have their wage indexes 
adjusted to maintain budget neutrality. 
However, all hospitals in States with 
hospitals receiving a rural floor would expect 
a decrease in their payments in order to 
achieve budget neutrality within their States 
(that is, the wage indices for hospitals in that 
State would be decreased in order to make 
the additional payments to hospitals in that 
State receiving the rural floor). Therefore, 
compared with our current policy of 
applying budget neutrality at the national 
level, States such as Arizona, New York, and 
Rhode Island could expect payment increases 
of 0.3 percent under a rural floor budget 
neutrality applied at the State level, while 
States such as California and Connecticut, 
which have several hospitals that benefit 
from the rural floor, could expect decreases 
in payments by 0.8 percent and 2.2 percent, 
respectively. 
H. Effects of the Proposed Wage Index 
Adjustment for Out-Migration (Column 7) 
Section 1886(d)(13) of the Act, as added by 
section 505 of Pub. L. 108–173, provides for 
an increase in the wage index for hospitals 
located in certain counties that have a 
relatively high percentage of hospital 
employees who reside in the county, but 
work in a different area with a higher wage 
index. Hospitals located in counties that 
qualify for the payment adjustment are to 
receive an increase in the wage index that is 
equal to a weighted average of the difference 
between the wage index of the resident 
county, post-reclassification and the higher 
wage index work area(s), weighted by the 
overall percentage of workers who are 
employed in an area with a higher wage 
index. With the out-migration adjustment, 
rural providers will experience a 0.1 percent 
increase in payments in FY 2009 relative to 
no adjustment at all. We included these 
additional payments to providers in the 
impact table shown above, and we estimate 
the impact of these providers receiving the 
out-migration increase to be approximately 
$20 million. 
I. Effects of All Proposed Changes With CMI 
Adjustment Prior to Estimated Growth 
(Column 8) 
Column 8 compares our estimate of 
payments per case between FY 2008 and FY 
2009 with all changes reflected in this 
proposed rule for FY 2009, including a ¥0.9 
percent documentation and coding 
adjustment to the FY 2009 national 
standardized amounts to account for 
anticipated improvements in documentation 
and coding that are expected to increase case- 
mix. We generally apply an adjustment to the 
DRGs to ensure budget neutrality assuming 
constant utilization. However, in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period, we 
indicated that we believe that the adoption 
of MS–DRGs would lead to increases in case- 
mix as a result of improved documentation 
and coding. In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period, we had finalized a 
policy to apply a documentation and coding 
adjustment to the standardized amount of 
¥1.2 percent for FY 2008, ¥1.8 percent for 
FY 2009, and ¥1.8 percent for FY 2010 to 
offset the expected increase in case-mix and 
achieve budget neutrality. However, in 
compliance with section 7 of Pub. L. 110–90, 
we reduced the documentation and coding 
adjustment to ¥0.6 percent for FY 2008. In 
accordance with section 7 of Pub. L. 110–90, 
for FY 2009, we are applying a 
documentation and coding adjustment of 
¥0.9 percent to the FY 2009 national 
standardized amounts (in addition to the 
¥0.6 percent adjustment made for FY 2008). 
We are not proposing to apply the 
documentation and coding adjustment to the 
FY 2009 hospital-specific rates and the FY 
2009 Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount. However, we continue to believe 
that case-mix growth of an additional 1.8 
percent compared to FY 2008 is likely to 
occur across all hospitals as a result of 
improvements in documentation and coding. 
Column 8 illustrates the total payment 
change for FY 2009 compared to FY 2008, 
taking into account the ¥0.9 percent FY 
2009 documentation and coding adjustment 
but not the projected 1.8 percent case-mix 
increase itself. Therefore, this column 
illustrates a total payment change that is less 
than what is anticipated to occur. 
J. Effects of All Proposed Changes With CMI 
Adjustment and Estimated Growth (Column 
9) 
Column 9 compares our estimate of 
payments per case between FY 2008 and FY 
2009, incorporating all changes reflected in 
this proposed rule for FY 2009 (including 
statutory changes). This column includes the 
FY 2009 documentation and coding 
adjustment of ¥0.9 percent and the projected 
1.8 percent increase in case-mix from 
improved documentation and coding (with 
the 1.8 percent case-mix increase assumed to 
occur equally across all hospitals). 
Column 9 reflects the impact of all FY 2009 
changes relative to FY 2008, including those 
shown in Columns 2 through 7. The average 
increase for all hospitals is approximately 4.1 
percent. This increase includes the effects of 
the 3.0 percent market basket update. It also 
reflects the 0.3 percentage point difference 
between the projected outlier payments in FY 
2008 (5.1 percent of total DRG payments) and 
the current estimate of the percentage of 
actual outlier payments in FY 2008 (4.8 
percent), as described in the introduction to 
this Appendix and the Addendum to this 
proposed rule. As a result, payments are 
projected to be 0.3 percentage points lower 
in FY 2008 than originally estimated, 
resulting in a 0.3 percentage point greater 
increase for FY 2009 than would otherwise 
occur. In addition, the impact of expiration 
of section 508 of Pub. L. 108–173 
reclassification accounts for a 0.1 percent 
decrease in estimated payments. There might 
also be interactive effects among the various 
factors comprising the payment system that 
we are not able to isolate. For these reasons, 
the values in Column 9 may not equal the 
product of the percentage changes described 
above. 
The overall change in payments per case 
for hospitals in FY 2009 is proposed to 
increase by 4.1 percent. Hospitals in urban 
areas will experience an estimated 4.2 
percent increase in payments per case 
compared to FY 2008. Hospitals in large 
urban areas will experience an estimated 4.4 
percent increase and hospitals in other urban 
areas will experience an estimated 3.9 
percent increase in payments per case in FY 
2008. Hospital payments per case in rural 
areas are estimated to increase 3.3 percent. 
The increases that are larger than the national 
average for larger urban areas and smaller 
than the national average for other urban and 
rural areas are largely attributed to the

23913 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Among urban census divisions, the largest 
estimated payment increases will be 5.2 
percent in the Pacific region (generally 
attributed to MS–DRGs and wage data) and 
5.0 percent in the Mountain region (mostly 
due to MS–DRGs). The smallest urban 
increase is estimated at 3.0 percent in the 
Middle Atlantic and New England regions. 
Among the rural regions in Column 9, the 
providers in the New England region 
experience the smallest increase in payments 
(2.3 percent) primarily due to the State- 
specific rural floor budget neutrality 
adjustment. The South Atlantic and Pacific 
regions will have the highest increases 
among rural regions, with 3.7 percent and 3.6 
percent estimated increases, respectively. 
Again, increases in rural areas are generally 
less than the national average due to the 
adoption of MS–DRGs. 
Among special categories of rural hospitals 
in Column 9, the SCH and RRC providers 
will receive an estimated increase in 
payments of 4.1 percent, and the MDH and 
RRCs will experience an estimated increase 
in payments by 2.8 percent. 
Urban hospitals reclassified for FY 2009 
are anticipated to receive an increase of 3.9 
percent, while urban hospitals that are not 
reclassified for FY 2009 are expected to 
receive an increase of 4.3 percent. Rural 
hospitals reclassifying for FY 2009 are 
anticipated to receive a 3.7 percent payment 
increase and rural hospitals that are not 
reclassifying are estimated to receive a 
payment increase of 2.8 percent. 
K. Effects of Policy on Payment Adjustments 
for Low-Volume Hospitals 
For FY 2009, we are continuing to apply 
the volume adjustment criteria we specified 
in the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49099). 
We expect that three providers will receive 
the low-volume adjustment for FY 2009. We 
estimate the impact of these providers 
receiving the additional 25-percent payment 
increase to be approximately $2,300. 
L. Impact Analysis of Table II 
Table II presents the projected impact of 
the proposed changes for FY 2009 for urban 
and rural hospitals and for the different 
categories of hospitals shown in Table I. It 
compares the estimated payments per case 
for FY 2008 with the proposed average 
estimated payments per case for FY 2009, as 
calculated under our models. Thus, this table 
presents, in terms of the average dollar 
amounts paid per discharge, the combined 
effects of the proposed changes presented in 
Table I. The proposed percentage changes 
shown in the last column of Table II equal 
the proposed percentage changes in average 
payments from Column 9 of Table I.

VII. Effects of Other Proposed Policy 
Changes 
In addition to those policy changes 
discussed above that we are able to model 
using our IPPS payment simulation model, 
we are proposing to make various other 
changes in this proposed rule. Generally, we 
have limited or no specific data available 
with which to estimate the impacts of these 
proposed changes. Our estimates of the likely 
impacts associated with these other proposed 
changes are discussed below. 
A. Effects of Proposed Policy on HACs, 
Including Infections 
In section II.F. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss our 
implementation of section 5001(c) of Pub. L. 
109–171, which requires the Secretary to 
identify conditions that (1) are high cost, 
high volume, or both, (2) result in the 
assignment of a case to a MS–DRG that has 
a higher payment when present as a 
secondary diagnosis, and (3) could 
reasonably have been prevented through 
application of evidence-based guidelines. For 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 
2008, hospitals will not receive additional 
payment for cases in which one of the 
selected conditions was not present on 
admission. That is, the case will be paid as 
though the secondary diagnosis was not 
present. However, the statute also requires 
the Secretary to continue counting the 
condition as a secondary diagnosis that 
results in a higher IPPS payment when doing 
the budget neutrality calculations for MS– 
DRG reclassifications and recalibration. 
Therefore, we do our budget neutrality 
calculations as though the payment provision

did not apply but Medicare will make a 
lower payment to the hospital for the specific 
case that includes the secondary diagnosis. 
Thus, the provision will result in cost savings 
to the Medicare program. 
We note that the provision will only apply 
when one or more of the selected conditions 
are the only secondary diagnosis or diagnoses 
present on the claim that will lead to higher 
payment. Therefore, if at least one 
nonselected secondary diagnosis that leads to 
the same higher payment is on the claim, the 
case will continue to be assigned to the 
higher paying DRG and there will be no 
savings to Medicare from the case. Medicare 
beneficiaries will generally have multiple 
secondary diagnoses during a hospital stay, 
such that beneficiaries having one MCC or 
CC will frequently have additional 
conditions that also will generate higher 
payment. Therefore, in only a small 
percentage of the cases will the beneficiary 
have only one secondary diagnosis that 
would lead to higher payment. 
The section 5001(c) payment provision 
will go into effect on October 1, 2008. Our 
savings estimate for the next 5 fiscal years 
from this provision has changed from our 
savings estimate published in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period because 
of the potential addition to the list of selected 
HACs for FY 2009 of the nine conditions 
considered in section II.F. of this proposed 
rule. We had estimated a savings of $20 
million per year from this provision for the 
eight conditions we originally selected in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period 
(72 FR 48168). We now estimate that this 
provision will save $50 million per year for 
the first 3 years beginning October 1, 2008. 
Beginning in FY 2012, we estimate a savings 
of $60 million per year as a result of this 
provision. Our savings estimates for the next 
5 fiscal years are shown below: 
Year 
Savings 
(in 
millions) 
FY 2009 ...................................... $50 
FY 2010 ...................................... 50 
FY 2011 ...................................... 50 
FY 2012 ...................................... 60 
FY 2013 ...................................... 60 
B. Effects of Proposed MS–LTC–DRG 
Reclassifications and Relative Weights for 
LTCHs 
In section II.I. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we discuss the proposed MS– 
LTC–DRGs (proposed Version 26.0 of the 
GROUPER) and development of the proposed 
relative weights for use under the LTCH PPS 
for FY 2009. We also discuss that when we 
adopted the new severity adjusted MS–LTC– 
DRG patient classification system under the 
LTCH PPS in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment, we implemented a 2-year 
transition, in which the MS–LTC–DRG 
relative weights for FY 2009 would be based 
completely on the MS–LTC–DRG patient 
classification system (and no longer based in 
part on the former LTC–DRG patient 
classification system). Consistent with the 
requirement at § 412.517 established in the 
RY 2008 LTCH PPS final rule (72 FR 26880 
through 26884), the proposed annual update 
to the classification and relative weights 
under the LTCH PPS for RY 2009 was done 
in a budget neutral manner, such that 
estimated aggregate LTCH PPS payments 
would be unaffected; that is, they would be 
neither greater than nor less than the 
estimated aggregate LTCH PPS payments that 
would have been made without the MS– 
LTC–DRG classification and relative weight 
changes. To achieve budget neutrality under 
§ 412.517, in determining the proposed FY 
2009 MS–LTC–DRG relative weights, we 
applied a factor of 1.038266 in the first step 
of the budget neutrality process 
(normalization), and we applied a budget 
neutrality factor of 0.9965 after normalization 
(see section II.I.4. (step 7) of the preamble of 
this proposed rule). These proposed factors 
that were applied to maintain budget 
neutrality were based on the most recent 
available LTCH claims data (FY 2007 
MedPAR files) for the 387 LTCHs in our 
database. Consistent with the budget 
neutrality requirement under § 412.517, we 
estimate that with the proposed changes to 
the MS–LTC–DRG classifications and relative 
weights for FY 2009, there would be no 
change in aggregate LTCH PPS payments. In 
applying the budget neutrality adjustment 
described above, we assumed constant 
utilization. 
C. Effects of Proposed Policy Change Relating 
to New Medical Service and Technology 
Add-On Payments 
In section II.J. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we discuss proposed add-on 
payments for new medical services and 
technologies. As explained in that section, 
add-on payments for new technology under 
section 1886(d)(5)(K) of the Act are not 
required to be budget neutral. As discussed 
in section II.J.4. of this proposed rule, we 
have yet to determine whether any of the four 
applications we received will meet the 
criteria for new technology add-on payments 
for FY 2009. Consequently, it is premature to 
estimate the potential payment impact in FY 
2009 of any potential new technology add-on 
payments for FY 2009. There are no 
technologies receiving new technology add- 
on payment in FY 2008. Therefore, at this 
time, we estimate that Medicare’s new 
technology add-on payments would remain 
unchanged in FY 2009 compared to FY 2008. 
If any of the four applicants are found to be 
eligible for new technology add-on payments 
for FY 2009 in the final rule, we would 
discuss the estimated payment impact for FY 
2009 in that final rule. 
D. Effects of Proposed Policy Regarding 
Postacute Care Transfers to Home Health 
Services 
In section IV.A. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we noted that, under current 
regulations, the postacute care transfer policy 
applies to acute care discharges for which 
home health care (for a related condition) 
begins within 3 days of the discharge from 
an acute care hospital where the patient was 
discharged from the hospital prior to the 
geometric mean length of stay for a 
‘‘qualified’’ MS–DRG. In that section, we 
discussed the reasons why we believe that 
the 3-day timeframe is no longer an 
appropriate threshold under the postacute 
care transfer policy. We discussed our 
rationale for extending the timeframe from 
within 3 days to within 7 days. Accordingly, 
we proposed to revise the timeframe in our 
regulations to within 7 days of discharge to 
home under a written plan for the provision 
of home health services, effective with 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 
2008. 
To estimate the impact of this proposal, we 
used acute care hospital claims from the FY 
2005 MedPAR file and searched for claims 
with a discharge destination code of ‘‘01’’ 
(Discharged to Home or Self-Care (Routine 
Discharge)) or ‘‘06’’ (Discharged/Transferred 
to Home under Care of Organized Home 
Health Service Organization in Anticipation 
of Covered Skilled Care). We then matched 
the acute care hospital MedPAR claims with 
HHA final action claims for 2005, using 
beneficiary identification numbers. We then 
compared the hospital discharge date with 
the home health admission date and 
determined a distribution by the difference in 
these two dates. We found that, for those 
patients for whom home health services 
began within 60 days of hospital discharge, 
in 6.7 percent of the cases, the services began 
on days 4 through day 7 after the acute care 
hospital discharge. We estimate that applying 
the proposed change to the hospital 
postacute care transfer policy would reduce 
Medicare payments to acute care inpatient 
hospitals by approximately $330 million over 
5 years. For FY 2009, we estimate that 
Medicare payments would be reduced by 
approximately $50 million. 
E. Effects of Proposed Requirements for 
Hospital Reporting of Quality Data for 
Annual Hospital Payment Update 
In section IV.B. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss the requirements 
for hospitals to report quality data in order 
for hospitals to receive the full annual 
hospital payment update for FY 2009 and FY 
2010. There are an estimated 186 hospitals in 
this analysis that may not receive the full 
market basket update for FY 2009. Most of 
these hospitals are either small rural or small 
urban hospitals. However, at this time, 
information is not available to determine the 
hospitals that do not meet the requirements 
for the full hospital market increase for FY 
2009. 
We also note that, for the FY 2009 payment 
update, hospitals must pass our validation 
requirement of a minimum of 80 percent 
reliability, based upon our chart-audit 
validation process, for the four quarters of 
data from FY 2007. These data were due to 
the QIO Clinical Warehouse by May 15, 2007 
(fourth quarter CY 2006 discharges), August 
15, 2007 (first quarter CY 2007 discharges), 
November 15, 2007 (second quarter CY 2007 
discharges), and February 15, 2008 (third 
quarter CY 2007 discharges). We have 
continued our efforts to ensure that QIOs 
provide assistance to all hospitals that wish 
to submit data. In the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we are proposing to provide 
additional validation criteria to ensure that 
the quality data being sent to CMS are 
accurate. The requirement of 5 charts per

hospital will result in approximately 21,500 
charts per quarter total submitted to the 
agency. We reimburse hospitals for the cost 
of sending charts to the Clinical Data 
Abstraction Center (CDAC) at the rate of 12 
cents per page for copying and approximately 
$4.00 per chart for postage. Our experience 
shows that the average chart received at the 
CDAC is approximately 150 pages. Thus, the 
agency will have expenditures of 
approximately $597,600 per quarter to collect 
the charts. Given that we reimburse for the 
data collection effort, we believe that a 
requirement for five charts per hospital per 
quarter represents a minimal burden to the 
participating hospital. 
F. Effects of Proposed Policy Change to 
Methodology for Computing Core Staffing 
Factors for Volume Decrease Adjustment for 
SCHs and MDHs 
In section IV.D. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss a change to the 
methodology we would use to compute the 
average nursing staff factors (nursing hours 
per patient days) for the volume decrease 
adjustment for SCHs and MDHs. If certain 
requirements are met, this adjustment may be 
made if the hospital’s total discharges 
decrease by more than 5 percent from one 
cost reporting period to the next. We do not 
believe this proposed change would have any 
significant impact on Medicare payments to 
these hospitals. 
G. Effects of Proposed Clarification of Policy 
for Collection of Risk Adjustment Data From 
MA Organizations 
In section IV.H. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss our proposed 
revision of our regulations to clarify that 
CMS has the authority to require MA 
organizations to submit encounter data for 
each item and service provided to an MA 
plan enrollee. The proposed revision also 
would clarify that CMS will determine the 
formats for submitting encounter data, which 
may be more abbreviated than those used for 
the Medicare fee-for-service claims data 
submission process. At this time, we have 
not yet determined an approach for 
submission of the encounter data. Therefore, 
we are not in a position to determine the 
extent to which the cost impact of submitting 
encounter data would differ from the current 
costs to MA organizations of submitting risk 
adjustment data. 
H. Effects of Proposed Policy Changes 
Relating to Hospital Emergency Services 
Under EMTALA 
In section IV.I. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we are proposing to clarify 
our policy regarding the applicability of 
EMTALA to hospital inpatients. We are 
proposing to amend the regulations to state 
that when an individual covered by 
EMTALA was admitted as an inpatient and 
remains unstabilized with an emergency 
medical condition, a receiving hospital with 
specialized capabilities has an EMTALA 
obligation to accept that individual, 
assuming that the transfer of the individual 
is an appropriate transfer and the 
participating hospital with specialized 
capabilities has the capacity to treat the 
individual. In addition, we are proposing two 
changes relating to the requirements for on- 
call physicians in hospital emergency 
departments. We are proposing to delete the 
provision relating to maintaining a list of on- 
call physicians from the regulations referring 
to EMTALA at § 489.24(j)(1) because a 
provision addressing the on-call physician 
list is already included in the regulations 
relating to provider agreements at 
§ 489.20(r)(2). We are proposing to 
incorporate the language of § 489.24(j)(1) as 
replacement language for the existing 
§ 489.20(r)(2) and amend the regulatory 
language to make it more consistent with the 
statutory language found at section 
1866(a)(1)(I)(iii) of the Act, which refers to 
hospital CoPs and the requirement to 
maintain an on-call list. These proposed 
changes would make the regulations 
consistent with the statutory basis for 
maintaining an on-call list. In addition, we 
are proposing to amend our regulations to 
provide that hospitals may comply with the 
on-call list requirement by participating in a 
formal community call plan so long as the 
plan includes a number of elements that are 
specified in the preamble to the proposed 
rule. Lastly, we are proposing to make a 
technical change to the regulations to 
conform them to the statutory language found 
in the Pandemic and All-Hazards 
Preparedness Act. These proposals do not 
include any substantive new requirements. 
Although hospitals choosing to participate in 
a community call arrangement will be 
required to devise a formal community call 
plan, such a plan would increase a hospital’s 
flexibility in meeting its on-call 
requirements. We are estimating no impact 
on Medicare expenditures and no significant 
impact on hospitals with emergency 
departments. 
I. Effects of Implementation of Rural 
Community Hospital Demonstration Program 
In section IV.K. of the preamble to this 
proposed rule, we discuss our 
implementation of section 410A of Pub. L. 
108–173 that required the Secretary to 
establish a demonstration that will modify 
reimbursement for inpatient services for up 
to 15 small rural hospitals. Section 
410A(c)(2) requires that ‘‘in conducting the 
demonstration program under this section, 
the Secretary shall ensure that the aggregate 
payments made by the Secretary do not 
exceed the amount which the Secretary 
would have paid if the demonstration 
program under this section was not 
implemented.’’ There are currently nine 
hospitals participating in the demonstration. 
We are currently conducting a solicitation for 
up to six additional hospitals to participate 
in the demonstration program. 
As discussed in section IV.K. of the 
preamble to this proposed rule, we are 
satisfying this requirement by adjusting 
national IPPS rates by a factor that is 
sufficient to account for the added costs of 
this demonstration. We estimate that the 
average additional annual payment for FY 
2009 that would be made to each 
participating hospital under the 
demonstration would be approximately 
$2,134,123. We based this estimate on the 
recent historical experience of the difference 
between inpatient cost and payment for 
hospitals that are participating in the 
demonstration. As an estimate for the 15 
hospitals that may participate, the total 
annual impact of the demonstration program 
for FY 2009 is projected to be $32,011,849. 
(In the final rule, we should know the exact 
number of hospitals participating in the 
demonstration program and would revise our 
estimates accordingly.) The adjustment factor 
to the Federal rate used in calculating 
Medicare inpatient prospective payments as 
a result of the demonstration is 0.999903. 
J. Effects of Proposed Policy Changes Relating 
to Payments to Hospitals-Within-Hospitals 
In section VI.F. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss our proposed 
policy change to allow a HwH that cannot 
meet the criteria in regulations for a separate 
governing body solely because it is a State 
hospital occupying space with another State 
hospital or located on the same campus as 
another State hospital and both hospitals are 
under the same governing authority, or the 
governing authority of a third entity that 
controls both State hospitals, to nevertheless 
qualify for an exclusion from the IPPS if the 
hospital meets other applicable criteria for 
HwHs in the regulations and the specified 
proposed criteria in this proposed rule. We 
are only aware of one hospital that would be 
allowed qualify for exclusion from the IPPS 
under the proposed criteria and to expand its 
bed size under the proposed provisions. 
Because any expansion would occur at some 
point in the future, we are unable to quantify 
the impact of this proposed change. 
K. Effects of Proposed Policy Changes 
Relating to Requirements for Disclosure of 
Physician Ownership in Hospitals 
In section VII. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss our proposals 
concerning (1) the definition of a physician- 
owned hospital; (2) the requirement that 
physician-owned hospitals disclose the 
ownership to patients; and (3) the 
requirement that all hospitals and CAHs 
must furnish written notice to their patients 
at the beginning of their hospital stay or 
outpatient visit if a physician is not present 
in the hospital 24 hours per day, 7 days per 
week, and that the notice must indicate how 
the hospital will meet the medical needs of 
any patient who develops an emergency 
medical condition at a time when there is no 
physician present in the hospital. The 
definition and the above requirements were 
implemented in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 47387 and 
47391). 
In this proposed rule, we are proposing to 
revise the definition of a physician-owned 
hospital at § 489.3 to include hospitals that 
have an ownership or investment interests by 
a physician and/or by an immediate family 
member of a physician. (The existing 
definition refers to an ownership or 
investment interest by a physician only, and 
not to an ownership or investment interest by 
an immediate family member.) We are also 
proposing to except from the definition of 
physician-owned hospital those hospitals 
that do not have at least one physician 
owner/investor or immediate family member

owner/investor who refers patients to the 
hospital. We believe that the proposed 
changes to the definition of physician-owned 
hospital would result in no more than a de 
minimis increase in the number of hospitals 
that are subject to the disclosure 
requirements applicable to physician-owned 
hospitals. We believe that there would be 
very few hospitals that would now meet the 
definition of physician-owned hospital, if we 
adopt our proposal to include immediate 
family members within the group of owners 
or investors that cause a hospital to be 
considered physician-owned, that did not 
already meet the definition. That is, we 
believe there are very few hospitals for which 
an immediate family member of a physician, 
but not the physician himself or herself, or 
any other physician, has an ownership or 
investment interest. Moreover, to the extent 
that such hospitals exist, that is, hospitals 
that have no physician owner/investors but 
which have owners/investors who are 
immediate family members of one or more 
physicians, such hospitals would not be 
subject to the disclosure requirement if we 
adopt our proposed exception to the 
definition of a physician-owned hospital for 
those hospitals that do not have at least one 
referring physician whose immediate family 
member is an owner/investor. Also, if we 
adopt this proposed exception to the 
definition of physician-owned hospital, the 
number of hospitals that now are subject to 
the disclosure requirement may be reduced 
slightly as we understand that there are some 
hospitals that have no referring physician 
owner/investors but rather have physician 
owner/investors who have retired from the 
practice of medicine. Thus, if both our 
proposed changes to the definition of 
physician-owned hospital are adopted, the 
net result may be no change, or a minimal 
increase or decrease in the number of 
hospitals that are subject to the disclosure 
requirement. Finally, if our proposal to 
change the definition of physician-owned 
hospital is adopted to encompass immediate 
family members, some hospitals that already 
meet the definition based on the presence of 
physician owner/investors may have to 
amend their list of physician owner/investors 
to add immediate family members, which we 
believe would be a minimal burden. 
We are proposing to clarify that the list of 
the hospital’s owners or investors who are 
physicians or immediate family members of 
physicians must be provided to the patient at 
the time the request for the list is made by 
or on behalf of the patient. We note that 
hospitals are already currently required to 
furnish the list of physician owners or 
investors and, thus, we believe that the 
impact of stipulating a timeframe for 
furnishing the list is negligible. 
We are proposing to require all hospitals to 
require that all physician owners who also 
are members of the hospital’s medical staff to 
agree, as a condition of continued medical 
staff membership or admitting privileges, to 
disclose, in writing, to all patients they refer 
to the hospital any ownership or investment 
interest that is held by themselves or by an 
immediate family member (as defined in 
§ 411.351). Disclosure would be required at 
the time the referral is made. Both hospitals 
and physicians would participate in the 
disclosure process. We believe this proposal 
would have a small effect on physician- 
owned hospitals to the extent that it may 
require them to change their bylaws or make 
similar changes. 
We do not anticipate that our proposals in 
section VII. of the preamble of this proposed 
rule would have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of 
physicians, other health care providers and 
suppliers, or the Medicare or Medicaid 
programs and their beneficiaries. 
Specifically, we believe that this proposed 
rule would affect mostly hospitals, 
physicians, and beneficiaries. The proposed 
changes concerning both the definition of a 
physician-owned hospital and the disclosure 
of physician ownership in hospitals are 
consistent with the physician self-referral 
statute and regulations as well as the current 
practices of most hospitals. Thus, our 
proposed requirement that the list of 
physician owners be provided to the patient 
at the time the request for the list is made by 
or on behalf of the patient would present a 
negligible economic impact on the hospital. 
Similarly, the cost borne by individual 
physicians to implement these provisions 
would be limited to a one-time cost 
associated with developing a disclosure 
notice that would be shared with patients at 
the time the referral is made in addition to 
the negligible time associated with providing 
the list to the patient and maintaining a copy 
of the notice in the patient’s medical record. 
We are also proposing to provide authority 
for CMS to terminate the Medicare provider 
agreement of any hospital that fails to furnish 
the required written notice that a physician 
is not available 24 hours per day, 7 days per 
week and to describe how the hospital will 
meet the medical needs of any patient who 
develops an emergency medical condition at 
a time when there is no physician present in 
the hospital. We believe that the cost borne 
by hospitals to implement this proposal 
would be limited to a one-time cost 
associated with completing minor revisions 
to the hospital’s policies and procedures to 
comply with the requirements of its Medicare 
provider agreement. Most hospitals have 
standard procedures to satisfy CMS by 
correcting deficiencies (such as the failure to 
furnish notice of physician ownership in the 
hospital to patients) before action is taken by 
CMS to terminate the Medicare provider 
agreement. 
Overall, we believe that beneficiaries 
would be positively impacted by these 
provisions. Specifically, disclosure of 
physician ownership or investment interests 
equips patients to make informed decisions 
about where they elect to receive care. Our 
proposals make no significant changes that 
have the potential to impede patient access 
to health care facilities and services. In fact, 
we believe that our proposals would help 
minimize anti-competitive behavior that can 
affect the decision as to where a beneficiary 
receives health care services and possibly the 
quality of the services furnished. 
L. Effects of Proposed Changes Relating to 
Physician Self-Referral Provisions 
In section VIII. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, we discuss our proposals 
pertaining to physician self-referral 
provisions, including: stand in the shoes, 
period of disallowance, and reporting of 
financial relationships between hospitals and 
physicians. We do not anticipate that our 
proposals would have a significant impact on 
physicians, other health care providers and 
suppliers, or the Medicare or Medicaid 
programs and their beneficiaries. 
With respect to the proposals to modify the 
physician ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ provisions, 
we do not anticipate that entities that include 
one or more physician organizations would 
find it necessary to restructure their 
organizational relationships. We believe that 
if either of our alternative approaches is 
adopted, compliance with the ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions would be made easier by 
simplifying the required analysis of 
arrangements in which a physician 
organization is interposed between the 
referring physician and the entity furnishing 
DHS. In addition to our proposals concerning 
the physician ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions, we are making an entity ‘‘stand 
in the shoes’’ proposal, whereby an entity 
that furnishes DHS would be deemed to 
stand in the shoes of an organization in 
which it has a 100-percent ownership 
interest and would be deemed to have the 
same compensation arrangements with the 
same parties and on the same terms as does 
the organization that it owns. We believe that 
the entity stand in the shoes proposal may 
result in more financial relationships 
between entities and physicians being subject 
to the physician self-referral provisions, but 
we are unable to quantify at this time the 
possible increase or determine the effect of 
the proposal on the referral patterns or 
organization structures of DHS entities and 
their wholly-owned organizations. Rather, we 
welcome public comments on these issues. 
Our proposal pertaining to the period of 
disallowance is a codification of what we 
believe is existing law and reflects what we 
believe most entities furnishing DHS are 
already following. Therefore, we do not 
anticipate a significant economic impact on 
the industry. 
M. Effects of Proposed Changes Relating to 
Reporting of Financial Relationships Between 
Hospitals and Physicians 
As discussed in section IX. of the preamble 
to this proposed rule, we are proposing to 
require that 500 hospitals furnish 
information concerning their financial 
relationships with their physicians. The 
financial relationships include ownership 
and investment interests and compensation 
arrangements. We are proposing that this 
information be submitted in a collection of 
information instrument that CMS has 
developed—the ‘‘DFRR,’’ which is included 
in Appendix C to this proposed rule. We are 
unable to quantify the number of physicians 
who have ownership and investment 
interests and compensation arrangements 
with hospitals. Even if we assume that the 
500 hospitals have a substantial number of 
financial relationships with physicians, we 
believe that, in general, the economic impact 
on these hospitals would not be substantial. 
Because we are proposing that the DFRR be 
completed by hospitals and that the 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 19:42 Apr 29, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00391 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\30APP2.SGM 30APP2jle

physician information requested in the DFRR 
will be on file at the hospital, we believe 
there should be negligible, if any, impact 
upon physicians or other health care 
providers or suppliers. Specifically, we 
believe that the cost to complete the DFRR 
for each hospital would be approximately 
$1,550, and the total cost burden for the 
industry would be approximately $775,000. 
We expect that this proposed rule may 
result in savings to the Medicare program by 
minimizing anti-competitive business 
arrangements as well as financial incentives 
that encourage overutilization. In addition, to 
the extent that we determine that any 
arrangements are noncompliant with the 
physician self-referral statute and 
regulations, there may be monies returned to 
the Medicare Trust Fund. We cannot gauge 
with any certainty the extent of these savings 
to the Medicare program at this time. Finally, 
we do not anticipate any financial burden on 
beneficiaries or impact on beneficiary access 
to medically necessary services because the 
completion of the DFRR would be conducted 
by hospitals. 
VIII. Effects of Proposed Changes in the 
Capital IPPS 
A. General Considerations 
Fiscal year (FY) 2001 was the last year of 
the 10-year transition period established to 
phase in the PPS for hospital capital-related 
costs. During the transition period, hospitals 
were paid under one of two payment 
methodologies: fully prospective or hold 
harmless. Under the fully prospective 
methodology, hospitals were paid a blend of 
the capital Federal rate and their hospital- 
specific rate (see § 412.340). Under the hold- 
harmless methodology, unless a hospital 
elected payment based on 100 percent of the 
capital Federal rate, hospitals were paid 85 
percent of reasonable costs for old capital 
costs (100 percent for SCHs) plus an amount 
for new capital costs based on a proportion 
of the capital Federal rate (see § 412.344). As 
we state in section V. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule, with the 10-year transition 
period ending with hospital cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001 
(FY 2002), beginning in FY 2002 capital 
prospective payment system payments for 
most hospitals are based solely on the capital 
Federal rate. Therefore, we no longer include 
information on obligated capital costs or 
projections of old capital costs and new 
capital costs, which were factors needed to 
calculate payments during the transition 
period, for our impact analysis. 
The basic methodology for determining a 
capital PPS payment is set forth at § 412.312. 
The basic methodology for calculating capital 
IPPS payments in FY 2009 would be as 
follows: (Standard Federal Rate) × (DRG 
weight) × (GAF) × (COLA for hospitals 
located in Alaska and Hawaii) × (1 + 
Disproportionate Share Adjustment Factor + 
IME Adjustment Factor, if applicable). 
We note that, in accordance with 
§ 412.322(c), the IME adjustment factor for 
FY 2009 is equal to half of the current 
adjustment, as discussed in section V.B.2. of 
the preamble of this proposed rule. In 
addition, hospitals may also receive outlier 
payments for those cases that qualify under 
the threshold established for each fiscal year. 
The data used in developing the impact 
analysis presented below are taken from the 
December 2007 update of the FY 2007 
MedPAR file and the December 2007 update 
of the Provider-Specific File that is used for 
payment purposes. Although the analyses of 
the proposed changes to the capital 
prospective payment system do not 
incorporate cost data, we used the December 
2007 update of the most recently available 
hospital cost report data (FYs 2005 and 2006) 
to categorize hospitals. Our analysis has 
several qualifications. We use the best data 
available and make assumptions about case- 
mix and beneficiary enrollment as described 
below. In addition, as discussed in section 
III. of the Addendum to this proposed rule, 
as we established for FY 2008, we are 
proposing to adjust the national capital rate 
to account for improvements in 
documentation and coding under the MS– 
DRGs in FY 2009. (As discussed in section 
III.A.6. of the Addendum to this proposed 
rule, we are not proposing to adjust the 
Puerto Rico specific capital rate to account 
for improvements in documentation and 
coding under the MS–DRGs in FY 2009.) 
Furthermore, due to the interdependent 
nature of the IPPS, it is very difficult to 
precisely quantify the impact associated with 
each proposed change. In addition, we draw 
upon various sources for the data used to 
categorize hospitals in the tables. In some 
cases (for instance, the number of beds), there 
is a fair degree of variation in the data from 
different sources. We have attempted to 
construct these variables with the best 
available sources overall. However, for 
individual hospitals, some 
miscategorizations are possible. 
Using cases from the December 2007 
update of the FY 2007 MedPAR file, we 
simulated payments under the capital PPS 
for FY 2008 and FY 2009 for a comparison 
of total payments per case. Any short-term, 
acute care hospitals not paid under the 
general IPPS (Indian Health Service hospitals 
and hospitals in Maryland) are excluded 
from the simulations. 
As we explain in section III.A. of the 
Addendum to this proposed rule, payments 
are no longer made under the regular 
exceptions provision under §§ 412.348(b) 
through (e). Therefore, we no longer use the 
actuarial capital cost model (described in 
Appendix B of the August 1, 2001 proposed 
rule (66 FR 40099)). We modeled payments 
for each hospital by multiplying the capital 
Federal rate by the GAF and the hospital’s 
case-mix. We then added estimated payments 
for indirect medical education (which are 
reduced by 50 percent in FY 2009 in 
accordance with § 412.322(c), as discussed in 
section V.B.2. of the preamble of this 
proposed rule), disproportionate share, and 
outliers, if applicable. For purposes of this 
impact analysis, the model includes the 
following assumptions: 
• We estimate that the Medicare case-mix 
index will increase by 1.0 percent in both 
FYs 2008 and 2009. (We note that this does 
not reflect the expected growth in case-mix 
due to improvement in documentation and 
coding under the MS–DRGs, as discussed 
below.) 
• We estimate that the Medicare 
discharges will be 13.2 million in FY 2008 
and 13.3 million in FY 2009 for an 
approximately 0.4 percent increase from FY 
2008 to FY 2009. 
• The capital Federal rate was updated 
beginning in FY 1996 by an analytical 
framework that considers changes in the 
prices associated with capital-related costs 
and adjustments to account for forecast error, 
changes in the case-mix index, allowable 
changes in intensity, and other factors. As 
discussed in section VIII. of the preamble and 
section III.A.2.1. of the Addendum to this 
proposed rule, the proposed FY–2009 update 
is 0.7 percent. 
• In addition to the proposed FY 2009 
update factor, the proposed FY 2009 capital 
Federal rate was calculated based on a 
proposed GAF/DRG budget neutrality factor 
of 1.0007, a proposed outlier adjustment 
factor of 0.9427, and a proposed exceptions 
adjustment factor of 0.9998. 
• For FY 2009, as discussed in section 
III.A. of the Addendum to this proposed rule, 
the proposed FY 2009 national capital rate 
was further adjusted by a factor to account 
for anticipated improvements in 
documentation and coding that are expected 
to increase case-mix under the MS–DRGs. In 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 47186), we established 
adjustments to the IPPS rates based on the 
Office of the Actuary projected case-mix 
growth resulting from improved 
documentation and coding of 1.2 percent for 
FY 2008, 1.8 percent for FY 2009, and 1.8 
percent for FY 2010. However, we reduced 
the documentation and coding adjustment to 
–0.6 percent for FY 2008, and for FY 2009, 
we are proposing to apply an adjustment of 
0.9 percent, consistent with section 7 of Pub. 
L. 110–90. As noted above and as discussed 
in section III.A.6. of the Addendum to this 
proposed rule, we are not proposing to adjust 
the Puerto Rico-specific capital rate to 
account for improvements in documentation 
and coding under the MS–DRGs in FY 2009. 
B. Results 
We used the actuarial model described 
above to estimate the potential impact of our 
proposed changes for FY 2009 on total 
capital payments per case, using a universe 
of 3,528 hospitals. As described above, the 
individual hospital payment parameters are 
taken from the best available data, including 
the December 2007 update of the FY 2007 
MedPAR file, the December 2007 update to 
the PSF, and the most recent cost report data 
from the December 2007 update of HCRIS. In 
Table III, we present a comparison of total 
payments per case for FY 2008 compared to 
proposed FY 2009 based on the proposed FY 
2009 payment policies. Column 2 shows 
estimates of payments per case under our 
model for FY 2008. Column 3 shows 
estimates of payments per case under our 
model for FY 2009. Column 4 shows the total 
percentage change in payments from FY 2008 
to FY 2009. The change represented in 
Column 4 includes the proposed 0.7 percent 
update to the capital Federal rate, other 
changes in the adjustments to the capital 
Federal rate (for example, the 50 percent 
reduction to the teaching adjustment for FY

23919 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
2009), and the additional 0.9 percent 
reduction to the national capital rate to 
account for improvements in documentation 
and coding (or other changes in coding that 
do not reflect real changes in case-mix) for 
implementation of the MS–DRGs. Consistent 
with the impact analysis for the proposed 
policy changes under the IPPS for operating 
costs in section VI. of this Appendix, for 
purposes of this impact analysis, we also 
assume a 1.8 percent increase in case-mix 
growth for FY 2009, as determined by the 
Office of the Actuary, because we believe the 
adoption of the MS–DRG will result in case- 
mix growth due to documentation and 
coding changes that do not reflect real 
changes in patient severity of illness. The 
comparisons are provided by: (1) Geographic 
location; (2) region; and (3) payment 
classification. 
The simulation results show that, on 
average, capital payments per case in FY 
2009 can be expected to remain about the 
same as capital payments per case in FY 
2008. The proposed capital rate for FY 2009 
would decrease 1.14 percent as compared to 
the FY 2008 capital rate, and the proposed 
changes to the GAFs are expected to result 
in a slight decrease (0.3 percent) in capital 
payments. In addition, the 50 percent 
reduction to the teaching adjustment in FY 
2009 will also result in a decrease in capital 
payments from FY 2008 as compared to FY 
2009. Countering these factors is the 
projected case-mix growth as a result of 
improved documentation and coding 
(discussed above) as well as an estimated 
increase in outlier payments in FY 2008 as 
compared to FY 2009. The net result of these 
changes is an estimated 0.0 percent change 
in capital payments per discharge from FY 
2008 to FY 2009 for all hospitals (as shown 
below in Table III). 
The results of our comparisons by 
geographic location and by region are 
consistent with the results we expected with 
the decrease to the teaching adjustment in FY 
2009 (§ 412.522(c)). The geographic 
comparison shows that all urban hospitals 
are expected to experience no change in 
capital IPPS payments per case in FY 2009 
as compared to FY 2008, while hospitals in 
large urban areas are expected to experience 
a slight decrease (0.3 percent) in capital IPPS 
payments per case in FY 2009 as compared 
to FY 2008. Capital IPPS payments per case 
for rural hospitals are expected to increase 
0.5 percent. These differences in payments 
per case by geographic location are mostly 
due to the decrease in the teaching 
adjustment. Because teaching hospitals 
generally tend to be located in urban or large 
urban areas, we would expect that the 50 
percent decrease in the teaching adjustment 
for FY 2009 would have a more significant 
impact on hospitals in those areas than those 
hospitals located in rural areas. 
Most regions are estimated to experience 
an increase in total capital payments per case 
from FY 2008 to FY 2009. These increases 
vary by region and range from a 1.9 percent 
increase in the Pacific urban and West South 
Central urban regions to a 0.1 percent 
increase in the East North Central urban 
region. Two urban regions are projected to 
experience a relatively larger decrease in 
capital payments, with the difference mostly 
due to proposed changes in the GAFs and the 
50 percent reduction in the teaching 
adjustment for FY 2009: ¥2.7 percent in the 
Middle Atlantic urban region and ¥3.6 
percent in the New England urban region. 
The East North Central urban region is also 
expected to experience a decrease of 0.1 
percent in capital payments in FY 2009 as 
compared to FY 2008, mostly due to 
proposed changes in the GAFs. There are two 
rural regions that expected to experience a 
decrease in total capital payments per case: 
A ¥4.5 percent decrease in the New England 
rural region and a ¥1.0 percent decrease in 
the Middle Atlantic rural region. Again, for 
these two rural regions, the projected 
decrease in capital payments is mostly due 
to proposed changes in the GAF, as well as 
a smaller than average increase in changes 
payments due to the adoption of the MS– 
DRGs. 
By type of ownership, voluntary and 
government hospitals are estimated to 
experience a decrease of 0.2 percent and 0.8 
percent, respectively. The projected decrease 
in capital payments per case is primarily due 
to the 50 percent teaching adjustment 
reduction for FY 2009. Proprietary hospitals 
are estimated to experience an increase in 
capital payments per case of 1.6 percent. This 
estimated increase in capital payments is 
mostly due to a smaller than average decrease 
in payments resulting from the 50 percent 
teaching adjustment reduction for FY 2009. 
Section 1886(d)(10) of the Act established 
the MGCRB. Before FY 2005, hospitals could 
apply to the MGCRB for reclassification for 
purposes of the standardized amount, wage 
index, or both. Section 401(c) of Pub. L. 108– 
173 equalized the standardized amounts 
under the operating IPPS. Therefore, 
beginning in FY 2005, there is no longer 
reclassification for the purposes of the 
standardized amounts; however, hospitals 
still may apply for reclassification for 
purposes of the wage index for FY 2009. 
Reclassification for wage index purposes also 
affects the GAFs because that factor is 
constructed from the hospital wage index. 
To present the effects of the hospitals being 
reclassified for FY 2009, we show the average 
capital payments per case for reclassified 
hospitals for FY 2008. Urban reclassified 
hospitals are expected to have the largest 
decrease in capital payments of 0.4 percent, 
while rural reclassified hospitals are 
expected to have the largest increase in 
capital payments of 1.0 percent. Urban 
nonreclassified hospitals are not expected to 
experience any change in capital payment 
from FY 2008 to FY 2009, while rural 
nonreclassified hospitals are expected to 
experience a slight decrease in capital 
payments of 0.3 percent. The projected 
changes in capital payments for rural 
hospitals are mainly due to the proposed 
changes to the GAF (including the proposal 
to apply the rural floor budget neutrality at 
a State level). The projected changes in 
capital payments for urban hospitals are 
mainly due to the 50 percent reduction in the 
teaching adjustment in FY 2009.

23921 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
IX. Alternatives Considered 
This proposed rule contains a range of 
proposed policies. The preamble of this 
proposed rule provides descriptions of the 
statutory provisions that are addressed, 
identifies those proposed policies when 
discretion has been exercised, and presents 
rationale for our decisions and, where 
relevant, alternatives that were considered. 
X. Overall Conclusion 
The changes we are proposing in this 
proposed rule will affect all classes of 
hospitals. Some hospitals are expected to 
experience significant gains and others less 
significant gains, but overall hospitals are 
projected to experience positive updates in 
IPPS payments in FY 2009. Table I of section 
VI. of this Appendix demonstrates the 
estimated distributional impact of the IPPS 
budget neutrality requirements for proposed 
MS–DRG and wage index changes, and for 
the wage index reclassifications under the 
MGCRB. Table I also shows an overall 
increase of 4.1 percent in operating 
payments. We estimate operating payments 
to increase by $3.96 billion. This accounts for 
the projected savings associated with the 
postacute care transfer policy proposal and 
the HACs policy, which each have an 
estimated savings of $50 million. In addition, 
this estimate includes the hospital reporting 
of quality data program costs ($2.39 million) 
and all proposed operating payment policies 
as described in section VII. of this Appendix. 
Capital payments are estimated to increase by 
0.0 percent per case, as shown in Table III 
of section VIII. of this Appendix. Therefore, 
we project that the increase in capital 
payments in FY 2009 compared to FY 2008 
is negligible ($6 million). The proposed 
operating and capital payments should result 
in a net increase of $3.967 billion to IPPS 
providers. The discussions presented in the 
previous pages, in combination with the rest 
of this proposed rule, constitute a regulatory 
impact analysis. 
XI. Accounting Statement 
As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available at http://www.whitehousegov/omb/ 
circulars/a004/a-4.pdf), in Table IV below, 
we have prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with the provisions 
of this proposed rule. This table provides our 
best estimate of the increase in Medicare 
payments to providers as a result of the 
proposed changes to the IPPS presented in 
this proposed rule. All expenditures are 
classified as transfers to Medicare providers. 
TABLE IV.—ACCOUNTING STATEMENT: CLASSIFICATION OF ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES FROM FY 2008 TO FY 2009 
Category Transfers 
Annualized Monetized Transfers .............................................................. $3.967 Billion. 
From Whom to Whom .............................................................................. Federal Government to IPPS Medicare Providers. 
Total ................................................................................................... $3.967 Billion. 
XII. Executive Order 12866 
In accordance with the provisions of 
Executive Order 12866, the Office of 
Management and Budget reviewed this 
proposed rule. 
Appendix B: Recommendation of Update 
Factors for Operating Cost Rates of Payment 
for Inpatient Hospital Services 
I. Background 
Section 1886(e)(4)(A) of the Act requires 
that the Secretary, taking into consideration 
the recommendations of the MedPAC, 
recommend update factors for inpatient 
hospital services for each fiscal year that take 
into account the amounts necessary for the 
efficient and effective delivery of medically 
appropriate and necessary care and high 
quality care. Under section 1886(e)(5)(B) of 
the Act, we are required to publish update 
factors recommended by the Secretary in the 
proposed and final IPPS rules, respectively. 
Accordingly, this Appendix provides the 
recommendations for the update factors for 
the IPPS national standardized amount, the 
Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount, 
the hospital-specific rates for SCHs and 
MDHs, and the rate-of-increase limits for 
hospitals and hospital units excluded from 
the IPPS, as well as LTCHS, IPFs, and IRFs. 
We also discuss our response to MedPAC’s 
recommended update factors for inpatient 
hospital services. 
II. Inpatient Hospital Update for FY 2009 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(XX) of the Act, as 
amended by section 5001(a) of Pub. L. 109– 
171, sets the FY 2009 percentage increase in 
the operating cost standardized amount equal 
to the rate-of-increase in the hospital market 
basket for IPPS hospitals in all areas, subject 
to the hospital submitting quality 
information under rules established by the 
Secretary in accordance with 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act. For hospitals 
that do not provide these data, the update is 
equal to the market basket percentage 
increase less 2.0 percentage points. 
Consistent with current law, based on Global 
Insight, Inc.’s first quarter 2008 forecast of 
the FY 2009 market basket increase, we are 
estimating that the FY 2009 update to the 
standardized amount will be 3.0 percent (that 
is, the current estimate of the market basket 
rate-of-increase) for hospitals in all areas, 
provided the hospital submits quality data in 
accordance with our rules. For hospitals that 
do not submit quality data, we are estimating 
that the update to the standardized amount 
will be 1.0 percent (that is, the current 
estimate of the market basket rate-of-increase 
minus 2.0 percentage points). 
Section 1886(d)(9)(C)(1) of the Act is the 
basis for determining the percentage increase 
to the Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount. For FY 2009, we are applying the 
full rate-of-increase in the hospital market 
basket for IPPS hospitals to the Puerto Rico- 
specific standardized amount. Therefore, the 
update to the Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount is estimated to be 3.0 
percent. 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act sets the 
FY 2009 percentage increase in the hospital- 
specific rates applicable to SCHs and MDHs 
equal to the rate set forth in section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act (that is, the same 
update factor as for all other hospitals subject 
to the IPPS, or the rate-of-increase in the 
market basket). Therefore, the update to the 
hospital-specific rates applicable to SCHs 
and MDHs is estimated to be 3.0 or 1.0 
percent, depending upon whether the 
hospital submits quality data. 
Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act is used 
for purposes of determining the percentage 
increase in the rate-of-increase limits for 
children’s and cancer hospitals. Section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act sets the 
percentage increase in the rate-of-increase 
limits equal to the market basket percentage 
increase. In accordance with § 403.752(a) of 
the regulations, RNHCIs are paid under 
§ 413.40, which also uses section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act to update the 
percentage increase in the rate-of-increase 
limits. Section 1886(j)(3)(C) of the Act 
addresses the increase factor for the Federal 
prospective payment rate of IRFs. Section 
123 of Pub. L. 106–113, as amended by 
section 307(b) of Pub. L. 106–554, provides 
the statutory authority for updating payment 
rates under the LTCH PPS. As discussed 
below, for cost reporting periods beginning 
on or after October 1, 2006, LTCHs that are 
not defined as new under § 412.23(e)(4), and 
that had not elected to be paid under 100 
percent of the Federal rate are paid 100 
percent of the adjusted Federal PPS rate. 
Therefore, because no portion of LTCHs’ 
prospective payments will be based on 
reasonable cost concepts for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 
2006, we are not proposing a rate-of-increase 
percentage to the reasonable cost portion for 
FY 2009 for LTCHs to be used under 
§ 413.40. In addition, section 124 of Pub. L. 
106–113 provides the statutory authority for 
updating all aspects of the payment rates for 
IPFs. Under this broad authority, IPFs that 
are not defined as new under § 412.426(c) are 
paid under a blended methodology for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2005, and before January 1, 2008. 
For cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2008, existing IPFs are paid 
based on 100 percent of the Federal per diem 
rate. Therefore, because no portion of the 
existing IPFs prospective payments will be 
based on reasonable cost concepts for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after

23922 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 84 / Wednesday, April 30, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
January 1, 2008, we are not proposing a rate- 
of-increase percentage to the reasonable cost 
portion for FY 2009 for IPFs to be used under 
§ 412.426(c). New IPFs are paid based on 100 
percent of the Federal per diem payment 
amount. 
Currently, children’s hospitals, cancer 
hospitals, and RNHCIs are the remaining 
three types of hospitals still reimbursed 
under the reasonable cost methodology. We 
are providing our current estimate of the FY 
2009 IPPS operating market basket 
percentage increase (3.0 percent) to update 
the target limits for children’s hospitals, 
cancer hospitals, and RNHCIs. 
Effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002, LTCHs 
have been paid under the LTCH PPS. 
Additionally, for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2006, no 
portion of a LTCH’s PPS payments can be 
based on reasonable cost concepts. 
Consequently, there is no need to propose to 
update the target limit under § 413.40 
effective October 1, 2008, for LTCHs. 
In the RY 2009 LTCH PPS proposed rule 
(73 FR 5361 through 5362), we proposed an 
update of 2.6 percent to the LTCH PPS 
Federal rate for RY 2009, which is based on 
a proposed market basket increase of 3.5 
percent and a proposed adjustment of 0.9 
percent to account for the increase in case- 
mix in a prior year that resulted from changes 
in coding practices rather than an increase in 
patient severity. The proposed market basket 
of 3.5 percent used in determining this 
proposed update factor is based on our 
proposal in the LTCH proposed rule to 
extend the LTCH RY 2009 by 3 months (a 
total of 15 months instead of 12 months) 
through September 30, 2009. (A full 
discussion of the reasons for this proposed 
extension of RY 2009 can be found in the RY 
2009 LTCH PPS proposed rule (73 FR 5351 
through 5353).) However, if we were not 
proposing to extend the 2009 LTCH PPS rate 
year by 3 months, we would have proposed 
a market basket update of 3.1 percent for a 
12-month RY 2009 offset by the proposed 
adjustment of 0.9 percent to account for the 
increase in case-mix in a prior year that 
resulted from changes in coding practices 
rather than an increase in patient severity. 
Effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2005, IPFs 
are paid under the IPF PPS. IPF PPS 
payments are based on a Federal per diem 
rate that is derived from the sum of the 
average routine operating, ancillary, and 
capital costs for each patient day of 
psychiatric care in an IPF, adjusted for 
budget neutrality. For cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2005, and 
before January 1, 2008, existing IPFs (those 
not defined as ‘‘new’’ under § 412.426(c)) are 
paid based on a blend of the reasonable cost- 
based PPS payments and the Federal per 
diem base rate. For cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2008, 
existing IPFs are paid based on 100 percent 
of the Federal per diem rate. Consequently, 
there is no need to propose to update the 
target limit under § 412.426(c) effective 
October 1, 2008, for IPFs. 
IRFs are paid under the IRF PPS for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2002. For cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 2002 (FY 
2003), and thereafter, the Federal prospective 
payments to IRFs are based on 100 percent 
of the adjusted Federal IRF prospective 
payment amount, updated annually (69 FR 
45721). Section 1886(j)(3)(C) of the Act, as 
amended by section 115 of Pub. L. 110–173 
sets the FY 2009 IRF PPS update factor equal 
to 0 percent. Thus, we are not applying an 
update (market basket) to the IRF PPS rates 
for FY 2009. 
III. Secretary’s Recommendation 
MedPAC is recommending an inpatient 
hospital update equal to the market basket 
rate of increase for FY 2009. MedPAC’s 
rationale for this update recommendation is 
described in more detail below. Based on the 
FY 2009 President’s Budget, we are 
recommending an update to the standardized 
amount of 0 percent. We are recommending 
that this same update factor apply to SCHs 
and MDHs. 
Section 1886(d)(9)(C)(1) of the Act is the 
basis for determining the percentage increase 
to the Puerto Rico-specific standardized 
amount. For FY 2009, we are applying the 
full rate-of-increase in the hospital market 
basket for IPPS hospitals to the Puerto Rico- 
specific standardized amount. Therefore, the 
update to the Puerto Rico-specific 
standardized amount is estimated to be 3.0 
percent. 
In addition to making a recommendation 
for IPPS hospitals, in accordance with 
section 1886(e)(4)(A) of the Act, we are also 
recommending update factors for all other 
types of hospitals. Consistent with the 
President’s Budget, we are recommending an 
update based on the IPPS market basket 
increase for children’s hospitals, cancer 
hospitals, and RNHCIs of 0 percent. As 
mentioned above, for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2008, 
existing IPFs are paid based on 100 percent 
of the Federal per diem rate (and are no 
longer paid a blend of the reasonable cost- 
based PPS payments and the Federal per 
diem base rate). Consequently, we are no 
longer recommending an update factor for 
the portion of the payment that is based on 
reasonable costs. Consistent with the 
President’s Budget, based on Global Insight, 
Inc.’s first quarter 2008 forecast of the RPL 
market basket increase, we are 
recommending an update to the IPF PPS 
Federal rate for RY 2009 of 3.2 percent for 
the Federal per diem payment amount. 
In the RY 2009 LTCH PPS proposed rule 
(73 FR 5361 through 5362), we proposed an 
update of 2.6 percent to the LTCH PPS 
Federal rate for RY 2009, which is based on 
a proposed market basket increase of 3.5 
percent and a proposed adjustment of 0.9 
percent to account for the increase in case- 
mix in a prior year that resulted from changes 
in coding practices rather than an increase in 
patient severity. The proposed market basket 
of 3.5 percent used in determining this 
proposed update factor is based on our 
proposal in the LTCH proposed rule to 
extend the LTCH RY 2009 by 3 months (a 
total of 15 months instead of 12 months) 
through September 30, 2009. (A full 
discussion on the reasons for this proposed 
extension of RY 2009 can be found in the RY 
2009 LTCH PPS proposed rule (73 FR 5351 
through 5353).) However, if we were not 
proposing to extend the 2009 LTCH PPS rate 
year by 3 months, we would have proposed 
a market basket update for a 12 month RY 
2009 of 3.1 percent in determining the 
proposed update factor for RY 2009 offset by 
the proposed adjustment of 0.9 percent to 
account for the increase in case-mix in a 
prior year that resulted from changes in 
coding practices rather than an increase in 
patient severity. 
Finally, consistent with the President’s FY 
2009 Budget, we are recommending a zero 
percent update to the IRF PPS Federal rate 
for FY 2009. This recommendation is 
consistent with the zero percent increase 
factor specified in section 1886(j)(3)(C) of the 
Act, as amended by section 115 of Pub. L. 
110–173. 
IV. MedPAC Recommendation for Assessing 
Payment Adequacy and Updating Payments 
in Traditional Medicare 
In its March 2008 Report to Congress, 
MedPAC assessed the adequacy of current 
payments and costs, and the relationship 
between payments and an appropriate cost 
base, utilizing an established methodology 
used by MedPAC in the past several years. 
MedPAC recommended an update to the 
hospital inpatient rates equal to the increase 
in the hospital market basket in FY 2009, 
concurrent with implementation of a quality 
incentive program. Similar to last year, 
MedPAC also recommended that CMS put 
pressure on hospitals to control their costs 
rather than accommodate the current rate of 
cost growth, which is, in part, caused by a 
lack of pressure from private payers. 
MedPAC noted that indicators of payment 
adequacy are almost uniformly positive. 
MedPAC expects Medicare margins to remain 
low in 2008. At the same time though, 
MedPAC’s analysis finds that hospitals with 
low non-Medicare profit margins have below 
average standardized costs and most of these 
facilities have positive overall Medicare 
margins. 
Response: Similar to our response last year, 
we agree with MedPAC that hospitals should 
control costs rather than accommodate the 
current rate of growth. An update equal to 
less than the market basket will motivate 
hospitals to control their costs, consistent 
with MedPAC’s recommendation. As 
MedPAC noted, the lack of financial pressure 
at certain hospitals can lead to higher costs 
and in turn bring down the overall Medicare 
margin for the industry. 
As discussed in section II of the preamble 
of this proposed rule, CMS implemented the 
MS–DRGs in FY 2008 to better account for 
severity of illness under the IPPS, and is 
basing the DRG weights on costs rather than 
charges. We continue to believe that these 
refinements will better match Medicare 
payment of the cost of care and provide 
incentives for hospitals to be more efficient 
in controlling costs. 
We note that, because the operating and 
capital prospective payment systems remain 
separate, we are proposing to continue to use 
separate updates for operating and capital 
payments. The proposed update to the

Appendix C—Disclosure of Financial 
Relationship Report (DFRR) Form 
Disclosure of Financial Relationship Report 
(DFRR) 
Requirement 
Completion of the Disclosure of Financial 
Relationship Report (DFRR or Report) is 
required under section 1877(f) of the Social 
Security Act. The Report must be completed, 
certified by the appropriate officer of the 
hospital, and received by CMS within 60 
days of the date that appears on the cover 
letter or e-mail transmission. Pursuant to 42 
CFR 411.361(f), failure to timely submit the 
requested information concerning an entity’s 
ownership, investment, and compensation 
arrangements may result in civil monetary 
penalties of up to $10,000 for each day 
beyond the deadline established for 
disclosure. 
Please be advised that the results from the 
DFRR may be shared with other Federal 
agencies and with Congressional committees, 
as permitted or mandated by law. We intend 
to protect from public disclosure, to the 
fullest extent permitted by Exemptions 4 and 
6 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(4) and (6), any confidential business 
information and any individual-specific 
information collected. We note that CMS is 
prevented by the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 
1905, from releasing confidential business 
information, except as authorized by law. 
Information collected from each hospital 
will be analyzed separately to determine 
whether the financial relationships are in 
compliance with the physician self-referral 
laws and implementing regulations. At this 
time, we do not plan to aggregate data. 
Exception to Mandatory Reporting 
An entity that furnishes 20 or fewer Part 
A and/or Part B services during a calendar 
year is excepted from this reporting 
requirement pursuant to 42 CFR 411.361(b). 
If you believe that the hospital qualifies for 
this exception: 
• The Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, or a comparable officer of 
the Hospital must certify in writing that the 
hospital furnishes 20 or fewer Part A and/or 
Part B services during a calendar year. 
• The certification statement must read as 
follows: ‘‘I, (insert name), hereby certify that, 
to the best of my knowledge and belief, 
(insert name of Hospital) furnishes 20 or 
fewer Part A and/or Part B services during a 
calendar year. Therefore the hospital is 
relying on the exception in 42 CFR 
411.361(b) and will not be reporting financial 
relationship data concerning the facility.’’ 
The certification statement must be signed 
and dated, and include the title of the 
signatory. 
• If the hospital or entity qualifies for the 
exception at 42 CFR 411.361(b), please mail 
the original and one copy of the signed 
certification statement to: Physician Self- 
Referral, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services, 7500 Security Boulevard, Mailstop
