Institutional Context For purpose of evaluating Federal regulations, the 1993 Executive Order 12866 “Regulatory Planning and Review” (Section 1(b)(1)) requires each Federal regulatory agency to identify the problem that it intends to address, including where applicable, the failures of private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action, as well as to assess the significance of the problem. In line with this requirement, this Chapter provides a problem statement consisting of the institutional context (i.e., prior EPA actions), significance of the problem (i.e., evidence of environmental damages), and characterization of market failure. In September 2003, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated its g</context>

The cost model assignment was dependent upon the level of baseline engineering controls assumed required by each plant’s state location and annual CCR disposal tonnage. The cost model estimated that 99 of the 132 plants without data dispose CCR in onsite landfills. • Onsite impoundments: 158 plants operate onsite CCR surface impoundments (aka “ponds,” “embankments,” “dams,” “dikes,” “wet dumps,” “constructed wetlands”).

Baseline state regulatory cost requirements are incurred at the closure date of the disposal unit when new unit construction occurs.

The cost for the most economical approach is assigned to that plant unless available data specify otherwise.

Regulatory Cost Estimation Algorithms &amp; Results This section presents incremental cost estimates for each regulatory option, for both existing active (i.e., operating) and future new CCR landfills and impoundments, and by size/type of affected electric utility plant owner entity.

These other potential economic effects are excluded from this RIA because the upper-end of the range in average annualized regulatory cost across all regulatory options as estimated in this chapter below, does not exceed the 0.25% to 0.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) threshold identified in OMB’s 1995 guidance53 for attempting to measure such other economic effects for purpose of UMRA economic analysis compliance.

This trend consists of two parts: (a) the 1996-2005 historical data period, plus (b) the more recent (2009) announcements of actual conversions which occurred between 2005 and 2009, and planned conversions to occur within the next 10 years (i.e., by 2019). According to one company (United Conveyor Corporation) who has been supplying dry disposal equipment and conversion services to the electric utility industry, the main historical drivers for this voluntary shift have been (1) generating dry fly ash as a saleable coproduct to other industries for beneficial uses, and (2) decreasing the volume of fly ash going to impoundments to provide greater capacity for bottom ash. Since then, concern over possible future environmental release liabilities associated with CCR impoundments, and pressure from individual state governments, has led electric utility companies to consider dry conversion.

The Bevill and Bentsen Amendments required EPA to complete full assessments of each exempted waste and submit a formal report to Congress on its findings. As itemized in Appendix A to this RIA, since 1978, EPA continued to evaluate CCR (as well as the other five waste categories) for different possible RCRA hazardous and non-hazardous waste regulatory approaches.

Institutional Context For purpose of evaluating Federal regulations, the 1993 Executive Order 12866 “Regulatory Planning and Review” (Section 1(b)(1)) requires each Federal regulatory agency to identify the problem that it intends to address, including where applicable, the failures of private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action, as well as to assess the significance of the problem. In line with this requirement, this Chapter provides a problem statement consisting of the institutional context (i.e., prior EPA actions), significance of the problem (i.e., evidence of environmental damages), and characterization of market failure.

Institutional Context For purpose of evaluating Federal regulations, the 1993 Executive Order 12866 “Regulatory Planning and Review” (Section 1(b)(1)) requires each Federal regulatory agency to identify the problem that it intends to address, including where applicable, the failures of private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action, as well as to assess the significance of the problem. In line with this requirement, this Chapter provides a problem statement consisting of the institutional context (i.e., prior EPA actions), significance of the problem (i.e., evidence of environmental damages), and characterization of market failure. In September 2003, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated its g</context>

The cost for the most economical approach is assigned to that plant unless available data specify otherwise.

This RIA does not include either qualitative or quantitative estimation of the potential effects of the proposed rule on economic productivity, economic growth, employment, job creation, or international economic competitiveness. These potential effects are identified as factors in both the 1993 Executive Order “Regulatory Planning and Review” (section 3(f)(1)) and in the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (section 202(a)(4)). These other potential economic effects are excluded from this RIA because the upper-end of the range in average annualized regulatory cost across all regulatory options as estimated in this chapter below, does not exceed the 0.25% to 0.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) threshold identified in OMB’s 1995 guidance53 for attempting to measure such other economic effects for purpose of UMRA economic analysis compliance. Based on the 2008 US GDP of $14.42 trillion,54 the 0.25% to 0.5% threshold is equal to $36 billion to $72 billi</context>

Therefore, the cost to construct a berm around an average-size impoundment is $4.3 million.64 o Landfill berms: Similarly, the average landfill size for existing units in the cost model is 278 acres.

According to one company (United Conveyor Corporation) who has been supplying dry disposal equipment and conversion services to the electric utility industry, the main historical drivers for this voluntary shift have been (1) generating dry fly ash as a saleable coproduct to other industries for beneficial uses, and (2) decreasing the volume of fly ash going to impoundments to provide greater capacity for bottom ash. Since then, concern over possible future environmental release liabilities associated with CCR impoundments, and pressure from individual state governments, has led electric utility companies to consider dry conversion.

Baseline state regulatory cost requirements are incurred at the closure date of the disposal unit when new unit construction occurs.

The cost for the most economical approach is assigned to that plant unless available data specify otherwise. The choice is dependent upon on estimated engineering control costs and annual CCR disposal tonnage. • New impoundments: If currently used as a disposal unit, this RIA assumes a landfill will be constructed as the future new disposal unit as impoundments reach end of lifespan, because the model calculates that new landfills are more economical to construct </context>
