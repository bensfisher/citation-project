Executive Summary 
 
In an accompanying Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Federal Railroad 
Administration (FRA) proposes amendments to regulations implementing a requirement of the 
Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA) that  railroads must install Positive Train Control 
(PTC) systems along certain lines that carry passengers and poison- or toxic-by-inhalation (PIH) 
materials.  FRA is proposing the removal of various regulatory requirements that require 
railroads to meet two tests in order to avoid PTC system implementation on track segments that 
were used to transport PIH traffic in 2008 and carried five million gross tons of traffic but that do 
not transport PIH materials traffic and are not used for intercity or commuter rail passenger 
transportation as of December 31, 2015. Substantial cost savings would accrue largely from not 
installing PTC system wayside components or taking mitigation measures along approximately 
10,000 miles of track.  Although these rail lines would forego some risk reduction measures, the 
reductions would be likely be small since these lines pose a much lower risk of accidents because 
they generally do not carry passenger trains or PIH materials and generally have lower exposure, 
because of lower traffic volumes than an average of all segments subject to the PTC requirement.  
The following analysis shows that if the assumptions are correct, the savings of the proposed 
action far outweigh the cost. 
 
The largest part of the cost savings benefit comes from reducing the extent of wayside that must 
be equipped with PTC.  Some of these lines would have qualified for exemption by passing the 
two tests contained in the 2010 PTC final rule, while others may not have.  In addition benefits 
will come from reducing the number of locomotives belonging to Class II and Class III (small) 
railroads that must be equipped with PTC because they run on Class I railroads’ track that will 
no longer need to be equipped with PTC. Although these benefits would be small relative to the 
wayside equipment savings, they would be large relative to the size of the railroads being 
impacted.  Finally, Class III railroads would avoid operational costs associated with having to 
reduce operating speeds to cross over two railroad-to-railroad crossings at an annual cost of 
$43,800.  These benefits to small railroads are a subset of the total benefits of reduced wayside 
costs described above.  For purposes of assessing the sensitivity of the findings, FRA also 
analyzed the impacts of scenarios in which the mileage no longer requiring PTC is 7,000 miles 
(low case) and 14,000 miles (high case).  The tables below present the total estimated cost 
avoided benefits of the proposed rule as well as the breakdown by element.

Total costs may also be broken down into initial investment and maintenance.  FRA

in initial installation costs (not discounted).  Maintenance cost savings would be as

Regulatory costs will come from reducing the potential for accident reduction.  A substantial part 
of the accident cost reduction that FRA expects from PTC systems currently required comes 
from reducing high-consequence accidents involving passenger trains or the release of PIH 
materials.  FRA believes that the lines impacted by this proposal pose significantly less risk 
because they generally do not carry passenger trains or PIH materials and generally have lower 
accident exposure because they have relatively lower traffic volumes than an average of all 
segments subject to the PTC requirement.  The following tables present the total costs of the 
proposed rule as well as the breakdown of the costs by element.

benefits and costs are such that a large benefit in terms of capital investment is avoided in early 
years, while the benefit of avoided maintenance and the disbenefit (costs) of  accidents not 
avoided would be realized annually in later years.  All other scenarios analyzed for sensitivity 
purposes assuming different levels of lines benefiting from regulatory relief also show net 
benefits.

1.0 Introduction 
 
In an accompanying NPRM, FRA proposes amendments to regulations implementing a 
requirement of the RSIA that certain passenger and freight railroads install PTC systems.  The 
proposal includes removing certain regulatory requirements that may require railroads to install 
PTC systems on track segments that carried PIH traffic in 2008 but will no longer carry PIH 
traffic on December 31, 2015.   
 
2.0 Background 
 
2.1 Regulatory history 
 
As a consequence of the severity of certain very public accidents, coupled with a series of other 
less publicized accidents, Congress passed the RSIA, mandating implementation of PTC systems 
by December 31, 2015.  Under the RSIA, such PTC implementation must be done by each Class 
I railroad carrier and each entity providing regularly scheduled intercity or commuter rail 
passenger transportation on: 
 
49 U.S.C. § 20157(a)(1) 
(A) its main line over which intercity rail passenger transportation or commuter rail 
passenger transportation, as defined in section 24102, is regularly provided;  
(B) its main line over which poison- or toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials, as 
defined in parts 171.8, 173.115, and 173.132 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, are 
transported; and  
(C) such other tracks as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation or order. 
 
The statute further defined “main line” to mean: 
 
49 U.S.C. § 20157(i)(2)  
…a segment or route of railroad tracks over which 5,000,000 or more gross tons of 
railroad traffic is transported annually, except that— 
(A) the Secretary may, through regulations under subsection (g), designate additional 
tracks as main line as appropriate for this section; and 
(B) for intercity rail passenger transportation or commuter rail passenger transportation 
routes or segments over which limited or no freight railroad operations occur, the 
Secretary shall define the term “main line” by regulation. 
 
To effectuate this goal, the RSIA required the railroads to submit for FRA approval a PTC 
Implementation Plan (PTCIP) within 18 months (i.e., by April 16, 2010).   
 
Consistent with this statutory mandate, FRA published a final rule with request for further 
comments on January 15, 2010, which established new regulations codified primarily in Subpart 
I to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 236 (the “PTC rule”).  Subsequently, FRA 
received a number of petitions for reconsideration to the final rule and a number of comments 
responding to the request for further comments.  In a letter dated July 8, 2010, FRA denied all of 
the petitions for reconsideration.  On September 27, 2010, FRA issued a new final rule with 
6 
 
clarifying amendments to the PTC rule. 
 
Under the current regulations, each PTCIP must include the sequence and schedule in which 
track segments required to be equipped with PTC will be equipped with PTC and the basis for 
those decisions.  See 49 CFR Section 236.1011.  This list of track segments must include all 
track segments that fit the statutory criteria for calendar year 2008.  See §§ 236.1005(b)(1) and 
(b)(2). 
 
While the statutory PTC implementation deadline is December 31, 2015, FRA recognized a need 
for a starting point in time to determine when such implementation must occur.  The final rule 
indicates that such a starting baseline should be based on the facts and data known in 2008 (the 
“2008 baseline”).  Using 2009 data would have been difficult given the proximity to the PTCIP 
submission deadline and the notably atypical traffic levels caused by the down turn in the 
economy.  Although each railroad’s initial PTCIP includes a future PTC implementation route 
map reflecting 2008 data, FRA recognized that PIH traffic levels and routings could change in 
the period between the end of 2008 and the start of 2016.  Accordingly, in the event of changed 
circumstances, the PTC rule provides railroads with the option to file a request for amendment 
(RFA) of its PTCIP to not equip a track segment that the railroad was initially, but may no longer 
be, required to implement a PTC system.  If a particular track segment included in a PTCIP no 
longer carries PIH traffic, and its PTC system implementation is scheduled, but not yet 
effectuated, then the host railroad might avoid actual PTC system implementation by filing a 
supported RFA for FRA approval.  Each such RFA must be supported with the data defined 
under §§ 236.1005(b)(2) and (b)(4)(i), and satisfy the two qualifying tests that were promulgated 
under FRA’s statutory authority to require PTC to be installed on lines in addition to those 
required to be equipped by RSIA.    If a track segment fails either of these tests, FRA would deny 
the request, thus requiring PTC system implementation on the line segment.  
The first test, proverbially known as the “alternative route analysis,” was initially codified at § 
236.1005(b)(4)(i)(A), and subsequently moved to a new section, § 236.1020.  Under this test, the 
railroad must establish that current or prospective rerouting to one or more alternative track 
segments is justified.  If a railroad reroutes all PIH materials off of a track segment requiring 
PTC system implementation under the 2008 baseline, and onto a new line, PTC system 
implementation on the initial line may not be required if the new line would have substantially 
the same overall safety and security risk as the initial line, assuming PTC implementation on 
both lines.  If the initial track segment is determined to pose less overall safety and security risks 
under this analysis, then a PTC system must still be installed.  PTC system implementation may 
also be required on the new line if it meets the 5 million gross ton of annual traffic threshold and 
does not qualify under the de minimis PIH risk exception of the rule.  
 
The second test that the railroad must satisfy in order to avoid having to install PTC on a track 
segment requiring implementation under the 2008 baseline is the so-called “residual risk test.”  
Under this test, the railroad must show that the remaining risk on the 2008 line—pertaining to 
events that can be prevented or mitigated in severity by a PTC system—is less than the national 
average equivalent risk per route mile on track segments required to be equipped with PTC 
systems due to statutory reasons other than passenger traffic presence.   When FRA issued its 
PTC rule amendments on September 27, 2010, FRA indicated that it was delaying the effective 
date of  
7 
 
§ 236.1005(b)(4)(i)(A)(2)(iii), as revised under § 236.1020, pending the completion of a separate 
rulemaking to determine how residual risk is to be determined. 
 
2.2 Litigation, Executive Order 13563, and Congressional Hearings 
 
After FRA issued its first PTC rule on January 15, 2010, and denied petitions for reconsideration 
on July 8, 2010, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) filed a petition for review of the 
rule with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Once FRA issued its 
PTC final rule amendments, AAR filed a petition for review of those amendments on October 5, 
2010.  The court consolidated those two petitions on October 22, 2010. 
 
In its brief, AAR challenged FRA’s determination to use 2008 as the baseline year, arguing that 
it rests on a fundamental legal error and was arbitrary and capricious.  The brief also contests  
§ 236.1029(f), which requires that each locomotive crewmember be able to use the PTC display 
to receive the same PTC information displayed in the same manner and execute any functions 
necessary to that crew member’s duties.  AAR claimed that § 236.1029(f) is not supported by 
substantial evidence and that FRA acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in adopting it. 
 
After the parties fully briefed the issues, President Obama issued Executive Order 13563 on 
January 18, 2011 (76 Fed. Reg. 3821 (Jan. 21, 2011)), which outlined a plan to improve 
regulations and regulatory review.  According to the Order, it is intended to reaffirm and build 
upon governing principles of contemporary regulatory review, including Executive Order 13563, 
by requiring Federal agencies when issuing safety regulations to design the regulations so that 
they are cost-effective, evidence-based, and compatible with economic growth, job creation, and 
competitiveness.  The President’s plan recognizes that these principles apply to both new and 
existing regulations.  To that end, Executive Order 13563 requires agencies to review existing 
significant regulations to determine if they are outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively 
burdensome.  FRA recognizes that the costs associated with PTC rule compliance outweigh the 
safety benefits by about 20:1 and, therefore, it is appropriate to reexamine whether FRA should 
require the installation of PTC on lines that will not be carrying PIH traffic or regularly 
scheduled passenger service as of December 31, 2015. 
 
FRA and AAR entered into a settlement agreement on March 2, 2011 (Settlement Agreement).  
The terms and conditions of the settlement agreement included the joint filing of a motion to 
hold the Petition for Review in abeyance pending the completion of the instant rulemaking.  That 
motion was filed on March 2, 2011, and was granted by the court on March 3, 2011. 
 
The Settlement Agreement further provides that FRA will issue two NPRMs.  The first NPRM 
will address one of the two issues involved in the lawsuit, namely whether the PTC rule should 
be amended by eliminating the two aforementioned tests that would potentially require PTC to 
be installed on track segments not specifically required to be equipped by Congress.  The 
accompanying NPRM meets this requirement.  The Settlement Agreement provides that upon the 
completion of the instant rulemaking proceeding, the parties will determine whether to file a 
joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit in its entirety.  The Settlement Agreement also states that 
FRA is to issue a second NPRM that will address the issues of how to handle en route failures of 
PTC-equipped trains, circumstances under which a signal system may be removed after PTC 
8 
 
installation, and whether yard movements and certain other train movements should qualify for a 
de minimis exception to the PTC rule. This second NPRM will also address any other issues that 
might be raised by interested parties in a properly filed petition for rulemaking under 49 CFR 
part 211.  These issues are not part of this NPRM and FRA is not seeking comment focused 
exclusively on these issues at this time, but seeks comments on those issues as they affect either 
this analysis, or the accompanying NPRM.   The settlement agreement notes that FRA will 
consider all comments submitted during the rulemaking comment periods on both NPRMs in 
determining whether to issue amendments to the PTC rule and, if so, the contents of those 
amendments, and FRA will seek comments addressing issues raised by subsequent NPRMs at 
the time they are published. 
 
On March 17, 2011, FRA and AAR testified before the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, 
and Hazardous Materials, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of 
Representatives.  In addition to reporting on the Settlement Agreement, FRA’s testimony 
discussed PTC system implementation planning and progress made thus far and highlighted the 
various ways that FRA has assisted the industry in meeting the statutory and regulatory goals.  In 
particular, FRA has supported PTC implementation by developing and approving certain 
implementation exceptions, providing technical assistance, and granting financial assistance.   
During its testimony, made jointly with Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), AAR asserted that, “If 
unchanged, the 2008 base-year provision means railroads would have to spend more than $500 
million in the next few years to deploy PTC on more than 10,000 miles of rail lines on which 
neither passenger nor TIH materials will be moving in 2015.”1  FRA understands AAR to 
assume that these 10,000 miles would not require PTC implementation because they would not 
be able to pass the alternative route analysis and residual risk analysis tests.  If this is not correct, 
FRA seeks AAR’s clarification.   
 
However, upon its own analysis, FRA assumes that 50 percent of the 10,000 miles would be able 
to pass both tests with the implementation of mitigation measures.  FRA seeks comment on this 
assumption.   Under the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) that accompanied the PTC final rule, 
FRA estimated that the railroads would need to implement PTC systems on approximately 
70,000 miles of track.  However, PTC system implementation could be avoided on 3,204 miles 
of those 70,000 miles of track because PIH materials traffic will have ceased by 2015 and the 
subject track segments would pass the residual risk analysis and alternative route analysis tests.  
During the earlier rulemakings, no entity, including AAR and NS, challenged or otherwise 
commented on these conclusions. 
 
FRA also estimated, in analyzing the final rule, that PTC system implementation could be 
avoided on 304 miles of track because PIH tonnage will fall below 5 million gross tons per year, 
                                                 
1 Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials of the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, U.S. House of Representatives, 112th Cong. 
(2011) (Joint statement of Edward R. Hamberger, President and Chief Executive Officer of the 
AAT, and Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the 
Norfolk Southern Railway, on behalf of the AAR’s member railroads) [hereinafter AAR

or passenger service would end so that neither of the two tests above would apply.  Between the 
two categories, FRA estimated that railroads could exclude more than 3,500 miles.  Assuming 
that the 3,500 miles represents about 50% of those tracks where PIH materials traffic will have 
ceased, FRA was implicitly estimating that there would be about 7,000 miles of track where PIH 
materials traffic will have ceased.  FRA seeks comment on its earlier and newly presented 
assumptions regarding where PIH materials traffic will have ceased.  The AAR and its members 
appear to have been more effective in reducing PIH materials traffic than FRA had initially 
estimated based on AAR’s Congressional Testimony and subsequent submissions to FRA.  In its 
analysis of this NPRM, FRA estimates that PIH traffic will cease on 10,000 miles of track on 
which PTC systems would have been required had the traffic not ceased.  FRA considers cases 
where 7,000 miles, 10,000 miles and, 14,000 miles of track might be excluded from PTC 
requirements because of changes in PIH traffic.  As FRA was completing its analysis of this 
proposal, AAR submitted data that indicates its member railroads believe that they can cease PIH 
traffic on 11,128, of which 9,566 miles have no passenger traffic.  Some of the passenger traffic 
miles may later qualify for exclusion from the system on which PTC is required.  FRA seeks 
comments and information on the accuracy and likelihood of estimated changes in PIH traffic. 
 
3.0 Section-by-Section Analysis 
 
Unless otherwise noted, all section references below refer to sections in Title 49 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations.  FRA seeks comments on all aspects of this analysis, including any costs 
and benefits that may not have been considered in this analysis, and particularly seeks comments 
on the time frame for installation, maintenance, and realization of costs and benefits. 
 
3.1 Proposed amendments to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 236 
 
Section 236.1003  Definitions 
 
FRA currently defines PIH materials within the rule text at § 236.1005(b)(1)(i), which some may 
find difficult to locate.  Accordingly, for the purposes of clarity, FRA proposes to add the 
definition for PIH materials to the definitions section of Subpart I.  The inclusion of this 
definition in § 236.1003 would not change the meaning of the term as understood under  
§ 236.1005(b)(1)(i) or its cross-referenced §§ 171.8, 173.115, and 173.132.  This amendment 
would create no new benefits or costs. 
 
Section 236.1005  Requirements for Positive Train Control systems 
 
In the accompanying rulemaking, FRA makes proposals regarding the alternative route analysis 
and the residual risk analysis tests.  When initially published on January 15, 2010, these 
provisions were included in § 236.1005(b).  On September 27, 2010, FRA issued amendments, 
moving the text to a new section, § 236.1020, and providing more clarifying language.  
However, to ensure continuity and understanding, § 236.1005 contained various cross-references 
to § 236.1020.  As indicated below, FRA is proposing to eliminate § 236.1020.  Accordingly, 
FRA also proposes rule text changes to § 236.1005 by removing those cross-references.  This 
amendment to § 236.1005 would create no new benefits or costs.

Section 236.1020  Exclusion of track segments for implementation due to cessation of PIH 
materials service or rerouting 
 
As previously noted, the PTC rule requires that, for each RFA seeking to exclude a track 
segment from PTC system implementation due to the cessation of PIH materials traffic, a 
railroad must satisfy both an alternative route analysis, and eventually a residual risk analysis test 
in order to secure FRA’s approval. 
 
FRA’s cost benefit analysis of the PTC rule indicates that the railroads will incur approximately 
$21.60 in PTC costs for each $1 in PTC safety benefits over a 20-year period at a discount rate of 
7 percent, or $19.49 in PTC costs for each $1 in PTC safety benefits over a 20-year period at a 
discount rate of 3 percent.  The AAR in its Congressional Testimony testified that (1) 2010 was 
the safest year for America’s railroads, (2) railroads have lower employee injury rates than most 
other major industries, (3) only around 4 percent of all train accidents on Class I main lines are 
likely to be prevented by PTC systems, and (4) there are many far less costly ways to provide 
greater improvements in rail safety than through the implementation of PTC on lines not required 
by Congress to be equipped.  According to the testimony, if the PTC rule remains unchanged, 
railroads may have to spend more than $500 million in the next few years to deploy PTC on 
more than 10,000 miles of rail lines on which neither passenger nor PIH materials will be 
moving in 2015.  Benefits and costs would result from eliminating the requirements to perform 
these tests on segments to be removed from the mandatory PTC network.  In addition to 
eliminating the procedural burden, relief would come from not installing PTC on the segments 
that would no longer require PTC installation.  Further, some cost-saving benefits may accrue 
from no longer implementing mitigation of residual risk on some segments that are removed 
from the PTC network.  That is railroads that were planning to reduce risk in order to pass the 
second test, through implementation of other risk mitigation tools, would no longer have to make 
such investments.  Some accident-reduction benefits would also be foregone as such mitigation 
tools would no longer be implemented.  FRA assumes in this analysis that on average the 
accident reduction from mitigation, which could result from enhancements of other accident 
prevention strategies, including operating practices and track safety, would be at least as great as 
the benefits foregone by excluding the track from the PTC network. FRA seeks comment on 
difference between the accident reduction benefits from mitigation and the accident reduction 
benefits from PTC implementation. 
 
While FRA believes that the alternative analysis and residual risk tests are legally sustainable, 
the agency agrees with the railroads that requiring these tests could potentially require the 
installation of PTC at a great cost to the railroads.  FRA also recognizes that the railroads have 
much work to do to install interoperable PTC systems in accordance with the Congressional 
mandate.  FRA is, therefore, proposing to eliminate the tests that would potentially require the 
installation of PTC on lines not mandated by Congress.   FRA seeks comments on whether to 
maintain, amend, or remove the alternative route analysis from the PTC rule.  FRA also seeks 
comments on whether to develop or remove the residual risk analysis.  In addition, FRA seeks 
comments on the economic impacts of removing or amending these two tests.  If FRA were to 
remove these requirements, it proposes doing so by eliminating § 236.1020 as it currently exists.  
While FRA will consider removal of these analyses from the PTC rule, FRA reserves its 
statutory and regulatory authority to require PTC system implementation on additional track 
11 
 
segments in the future based on risk levels or other rational bases. 
 
3.2 Analysis of benefits and costs 
 
As the NPRM reduces burdens imposed by an earlier rulemaking, the benefits of the NPRM are 
a reduction in regulatory costs, and the costs of the NPRM are a reduction in regulatory benefits.  
To help avoid confusion, sections are labeled with benefit or cost of the final rule as well as the 
proposed rule. 
 
In addition, some distributional impacts may result from elimination of the two tests, which may 
result in certain lines required to be equipped with PTC solely because they carry passenger 
traffic.  For example, a line along which both passengers and PIH materials moved in 2008, but 
along which PIH traffic is discontinued prior to 2015, is required to have PTC under the 2010 
PTC rule due to the movement of both passenger trains and PIH carrying trains in 2008, but 
would only be required to have PTC under the proposal due to the movement of passengers on 
the line. 
 
3.3 Benefits of the proposed rule (relevant costs of the final PTC rule)  
 
In its Congressional testimony, AAR said that its members (Class I railroads) would be able to 
reduce the required installation of PTC on 10,000 miles of their systems.  AAR subsequently 
submitted data to FRA showing as much as 15,355 miles of their systems might be excludable.  
The AAR later clarified that 11,128 miles would excludable under the proposal to eliminate the 
two tests and submitted a revised data set.  AAR noted that the additional potential excludable 
mileage contained in the initial submission was dependent on changes in customer demand as 
well as a broadening of the existing de minimis exceptions as requested in its petition to amend 
FRA’s rule.   
 
FRA reviewed the original AAR data when it was first submitted and found that less than 14,000 
miles of the 15,355 miles might be excludable under the proposed rule, but that the remaining 
miles not only had passenger traffic, but also had sufficient volumes to preclude any Main Line 
Track Exclusion Addendum (MTEA) for the passenger service.  Given the uncertainty associated 
with the initial data set, FRA chose to analyze two cases for sensitivity analysis in addition to the 
expected case.  Thus, for the high case analysis, FRA assumed 14,000 miles could potentially be 
excluded.  Although approximately 1,100 of those miles would not meet the criteria for being 
excluded because they carry passenger trains, for purposes of this analysis FRA assumed that the 
railroads would be able to pursue an exclusion of those miles from main track, and therefore 
from the requirement to install PTC, under provisions applying to passenger service, but would 
then require some kind of mitigation on those miles.  This was done purely for analytical 
purposes and by no means assures that FRA would grant any such exclusion(s).  FRA assumed 
10,000 excludable miles (of which 550 miles are passenger miles that require some mitigation, 
based on the AAR’s public estimates and a review of the data initially submitted by AAR) as the 
expected case (base case).  FRA also assumed 7,000 excludable miles (with no passenger miles) 
as the low case.  The 7,000 miles was loosely based on FRA’s assumption that 3,204 miles 
would have passed the two tests in absence of this rulemaking with the implementation of some 
kind of mitigation to reduce the risk to a level below the threshold of the final rule.  This is also 
12 
 
consistent with an assumption that 50 percent of the miles from which PIH is rerouted or 
eliminated would have passed the two tests under the existing PTC rule.  FRA requests 
comments on the number of passenger miles that would require some mitigation in order to meet 
the MTEA criteria. 
 
Based on the more recent information submitted by AAR, it seems that railroads would indeed 
be able to exclude 11,128 miles under the proposed rule.  Although this estimate is more robust 
(less uncertain) than the initial estimate of 10,000 excludable miles, FRA believes that the 
outcome and findings of the analysis conducted using 10,000 miles would be unchanged.  In the 
interest of expediting this rulemaking, which impacts the railroads ability to meet the statutory 
deadline for implementing PTC in a more cost effective manner, FRA did not adjust the base 
case.  The two additional cases analyzed to determine sensitivity have also been retained as they 
continue to be meaningful, as well.  FRA continues to believe there is a possibility that railroads 
will be able to exclude more miles based on changes in customer demand or otherwise and 
likewise that there is possibility that railroads may not be able to exclude as many miles as they 
currently anticipate due to unforeseen causes.  Based on comments and information received in 
response to the NPRM and this Regulatory Impact Analysis, FRA may adjust the scenarios 
analyzed at the final rule stage. 
 
In its analysis of the final rule, FRA estimated that installation of PTC requires about $50,000 
per mile in wayside costs along freight lines, in 2009 dollars.  AAR has testified and commented 
that wayside improvements needed for PTC cost $50,000 per mile.  FRA is using the estimate of 
$50,000 per mile in initial costs for purposes of this analysis.  FRA is using 2009 dollars 
throughout this analysis, to aid in comparison to the analysis of the PTC rule, and to avoid 
inflating accident consequences at a time when FRA continues to use the same value of a 
statistical life as FRA used in analyzing the 2010 PTC rule. 
 
FRA believes that some of the mileage under all three scenarios would be able to qualify for a 
main track exclusion under the 2010 PTC rule, but would require mitigation in order to have the 
exclusion approved.  Mitigation treatment measures could include things such as reduction in 
train operating speeds improvements in track physical infrastructure, elimination of at grade rail -
highway or rail -rail crossings, elimination of switches, changes in traffic volumes, changes in 
the underlying method of operation, introduction of broken rail detection systems, addition of hot 
box detectors, and addition of other hazard detectors (slide and intrusion detectors, high water 
detectors).  Other measures may include more rigorous operational efficiency testing and training 
that adapts to observed concerns, temporal separation, and a more rigorous track maintenance 
program.  FRA seeks comments regarding the difference between accident reduction benefits 
from PTC and accident reduction benefits from other mitigations. 
  
In the economic analysis of the 2010 PTC rule, FRA estimated that 3,204 miles would be 
excludable from the PTC network if the railroads adopted some mitigation that allowed them to 
pass the second of the two tests that FRA is now proposing to eliminate, at an average cost of 
$10,000 per mile.  FRA continues to believe that some line segments would have passed the tests 
with the implementation of some mitigation and is using the average cost of $10,000 per mile in 
initial costs for segments that might have received mitigation treatment to that end.  FRA seeks 
comment on this assumption.  This value (in 2009 dollars) has been subject to public comment, 
13 
 
both at the NPRM stage and in the final rule for the 2010 PTC rule, and there were no objections 
to use of the value.  FRA believes the railroads and their customers have been able to divert or 
eliminate PIH traffic from more mileage than FRA had assumed in analyzing the PTC rule.  The 
reduction in PIH traffic is partially due to a change in the shipment of commodities, which is an 
alternative approach to compliance that FRA had not considered in analyzing the PTC rule.  For 
example, On November 2, 2009, the Clorox Company announced that it was transitioning its 
operations to produce end product bleach from transported high strength bleach instead of from 
chlorine gas, a PIH material.   
 
For purposes of this analysis, FRA estimates that half of the mileage from which PIH is 
eliminated or rerouted would have passed both tests under the 2010 PTC rule, and would  
have qualified for exclusion, but would have required some mitigation to do so.  FRA chose  
50 percent as a best estimate, because the affected segments would need to pass two tests, one of 
which has never been fully developed.  The first test applies to rerouted PIH traffic, but not to 
eliminated PIH traffic.  Under that test, the new route with PTC must be at least as safe as the 
existing route would have been if the existing route also been equipped with PTC.  FRA believes 
that more than half of the rerouted traffic could pass this test, in part because railroads are trying 
to diminish risk with their rerouting.  The second test, that would apply to both segments from 
which PIH is rerouted and segments from which PIH is eliminated, is that residual risk (with 
mitigations, if needed) is not higher than the average risk for Class I lines in the United States 
that are required to be equipped with PTC because of gross tonnage and the presence of PIH 
traffic.  As noted below in the discussion of costs through increased accident risk, the segments 
in question, based on FRA’s review of the initial AAR data, appear on average to have lower 
than average traffic volumes than an average of all segments subject to the PTC requirement.  
FRA never fully developed that test, but FRA believes that some segments would have passed 
that test, although many might have needed some kind of mitigation.  For purposes of this 
analysis, FRA continues to estimate the cost of mitigation at $10,000 per mile in initial costs on 
the average and applies this to half of the segments subjected to the two tests.  In other words, 
this analysis assumes that half of the mileage that may be excludable under the proposed rule 
would have been excludable under the 2010 PTC rule with some form of mitigation 
implemented, at an average cost of $10,000 per mile. 
 
Under the expected case, the assumptions presented mean that the mileage excluded (but that 
would have required mitigation) was 50 percent of 10,000 miles, or 5,000 miles.  Therefore, the 
cost reduction (before the impact of passenger service is considered) would be $10,000 per mile, 
multiplied by 5,000 miles, for a total of $50 million.  However, FRA notes from data submitted 
by AAR that many of the additional miles have passenger traffic.  FRA did not consider those 
segments where an MTEA would not be available for the passenger traffic; but did consider 
segments that appeared to be eligible for an MTEA, though probably with some kind of 
mitigation.  FRA used the same cost to estimate mitigation costs for these lines as well.  In the 
expected case, FRA estimates that 550 miles of passenger routes would be affected and thus still 
requiring some mitigation to meet the MTEA criteria and offsetting the initial cost savings by 
550 miles multiplied by $10,000, for a total of $5.5 million.  In the expected case, the savings 
from eliminating the requirement for mitigation on the lines that would have passed the two tests 
with some mitigation would be $44.5 million in initial costs ($50 million minus $5.5 million).  
All savings on initial costs would then be coupled with avoided maintenance costs throughout 
14 
 
the remainder of the period analyzed.   
 
FRA also notes that the mileage assumed to be affected by mitigation costs avoided is 3,500 
miles at $10,000 per mile in the low case and 7,000 miles at $10,000 per mile in the high case. 
 
As described above, under the 2010 PTC rule, FRA believes that only 50 percent of the segments 
from which PIH is removed would qualify for exclusion.  The remaining segments would still 
require PTC installation.  Under the accompanying proposal the two tests would no longer apply, 
so all of the segments would be excludable from the PTC network.  For those segments that 
could not be excluded under the PTC rule, but that could be excluded under the proposal, the 
reduced initial cost would be the full cost of PTC wayside installation, or $50,000 per mile.  
Therefore, in the expected case of 10,000 miles, 5,000 would have been excludable under the 
PTC rule (but would have required some mitigation), and the remaining 5,000 miles would now 
become excludable, with a reduction in initial costs of $50,000 per mile.  The initial cost savings 
from not installing PTC on these segments would be 5,000 miles multiplied by $50,000 per mile, 
for a total of $250 million. 
 
In this analysis, FRA assumes that the segments removed from the PTC network are relatively 
lower priority segments for purposes of PTC installation, so costs are avoided in the last 2 years 
of PTC implementation, half in 2014 and half in 2015.   
 
In discussions with FRA at the RSAC working group that developed the PTC rule, Class I 
railroads indicated that they would equip all of their over-the-road locomotives with PTC in 
order to avoid difficulties in managing power units.  FRA believes this still holds true under the 
accompanying proposal.  Further, FRA is not aware of any way to decrease any expenditures on 
central systems or development.  FRA believes there will be little or no change on Class I 
systems in costs to equip locomotives or to develop or install central systems.  There is a 
possibility that some Class I railroads may find a way to equip fewer locomotives in some 
situations where a captive locomotive fleet makes sense. 
 
A more likely, but relatively small impact is that some Class II or III railroads may be able to 
avoid equipping locomotives under the proposed rule because the portion of the Class I railroad 
system on which they have trackage rights would no longer be PTC-equipped.  (This is analyzed 
in the following section.)  Further, although the costs of equipping at railroad grade crossings 
(diamond crossings) is included in wayside costs, there may be some cases in which the Class II 
or III railroads are required to pay for wayside upgrades at the crossing.  To the extent that the 
Class I railroad’s track is removed from the PTC network under this proposal, the portion of the 
burdens falling on at-grade railroad crossings will also diminish.  In data submitted to FRA, it 
appears that 19 crossings involving Class II or III railroads would be affected in the high case.  
FRA uses that data to estimate that 13 crossings involving Class II or III railroads would be 
affected in the expected case, and to estimate that 3 crossings involving Class III railroads would 
be affected in the expected case, based on data submitted by AAR. 
 
3.4 Locomotive cost savings (benefit of the proposed rule) 
 
In analyzing the economic impacts of the 2010 PTC rule, FRA did not develop a separate 
15 
 
estimate of the number of locomotives affected that belong to Class II and III railroads.  They 
were included in the industry total.  However, in analyzing the impact on small entities for 
purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, FRA estimated that 240 locomotives 
belonging to small entities (Class III railroads) would be affected.  For the purposes of this 
analysis, FRA estimates that three times as many locomotives (720) belonging to Class II 
railroads would be affected, for a total of 960 Class II and Class III locomotives affected.  This 
includes locomotives operating over either Class I railroads or passenger railroads.  FRA 
requests comments regarding this assumption.  AAR’s aforementioned Congressional testimony 
indicates that, without exclusions, approximately 73,000 of their miles would be affected.  
Therefore, if 14,000 miles were excluded as a result of this proposal (the high case), the total 
mileage impacted would decrease to 56,000 miles, declining by 20 percent.  FRA assumes that if 
PTC mileage were to decline by 20 percent, then Class II and Class III railroads could decrease 
the number of locomotives to be equipped by 16 percent (80 percent of 20 percent), or 154 
locomotives, 39 of which belong to Class III railroads.  Applying similar logic2 will yield a 
reduction of 110 locomotives equipped under the expected case, of which 28 belong to Class III 
railroads.  Also using similar logic3 will yield a reduction of 77 locomotives under the low case, 
of which 19 belong to Class III railroads.  In analyzing the 2010 PTC rule, FRA estimated the 
cost to equip a locomotive at $55,000.  Therefore, the initial cost savings related to equipping 
locomotives would be $6,050,000 for the expected case, $8,470,000 for the high case, and 
$4,235,000 for the low case. 
 
3.5 Maintenance cost savings (benefit of the proposed rule) 
 
As in the 2010 PTC final rule analysis, FRA assumes that annual maintenance costs are  
15 percent of the costs of the installed system as of the end of the previous year.  Maintenance 
costs include training personnel to use and maintain the system, software management plans and 
implementation, inspection, repair, and testing, replacement parts cost and labor, and 
requalification of systems after original equipment parts are no longer manufactured, so new 
hardware must be introduced.  The absolute costs of maintenance can be much larger than the 
original costs of procuring a system.  The discounted costs are also larger, but not by as much as 
the undiscounted costs, because maintenance costs can only occur after a system is procured.  
The lower the discount rate, the greater the proportion of total costs attributable to maintenance.  
In this analysis, the initial procurements are evenly divided between 2014 and 2015, and 
maintenance costs are 15 percent of the installed base.  Thus it does not matter which case is 
examined.  Maintenance costs avoided are 59.04 percent of the total costs avoided using a  
7 percent discount rate, and 65.87 percent of the total costs avoided using a 3 percent discount 
rate. 
 
3.6 Timing of savings 
 
FRA assumes that the segments withdrawn from the PTC network under the proposal would 
have been lower priority segments for purposes of installation; therefore, the savings are toward 
the end of the 5-year installation period.  FRA assumes that half of the initial system savings is in 
the last year of installation (2015) and the other half in the prior year (2014). 
                                                 
2 (10,000 miles/14,000 miles) x 154 locomotives. 
3 (7,000 miles/14,000 miles) x 154 locomotives. 
16 
 
 
3.7 At-grade railroad crossings 
 
The cost savings associated with at grade railroad crossing wayside improvements is included in 
the wayside cost discussion above, although in some instances the Class I railroad might not 
have been the party responsible for the costs of equipping the crossing with PTC, so the costs 
might have fallen on a Class II or III railroad.  In analyzing the impacts on small entities for the 
2010 PTC rule, FRA estimated operational costs at railroad crossings to be $219,000 per year for 
Class III railroads.  Finally, Class III railroads would avoid operational costs associated with 
having to reduce operating speeds to cross over two railroad-to-railroad crossings at an annual 
cost of $43,800.  These benefits to small railroads are a subset of the total benefits of reduced 
wayside costs described above.  The cost impacts are discussed in the analysis of impacts on 
small entities contained in the preamble of the NPRM.  FRA estimates that five small railroads 
will be affected by the reduced requirement to equip locomotives, and another two will be 
affected by the reduced requirements to take actions at railroad crossings, for a total of seven 
affected railroads.  The total of seven affected Class III railroads is not a substantial number of 
small entities, given that there are 674 small railroads.   
 
3.8 Total initial cost saving benefits  
 
The total initial cost savings is the sum of the mitigation costs avoided:  $44.5 million for the 
expected case, $59 million for the high case, or $35 million for the low case; plus the initial 
wayside costs avoided:  $250 million for the expected case, $350 million for the high case, or 
$175 million for the low case; plus locomotive costs avoided:  $6.05 million for the expected 
case, $8.47 million for the high case, or $4.235 million for the low case.  These add up to 
$300,550,000 for the expected case, $402,970,000 for the high case, or $223,735,000, for the 
low case.

As in the analysis of the 2010 PTC rule, FRA also assumed that annual maintenance costs would 
total 15 percent of the initial installation costs for wayside components as well as locomotive 
components. 
 
FRA then used these values as input to estimate discounted and annualized costs for expected, 
high, and low cases for the first 20 years at both 7 percent and 3 percent discount rates.

The costs that would be avoided under the proposed rule are presented in the table below.  FRA 
analyzed the maintenance costs and found that under the expected case as well as the two 
additional scenarios analyzed to determine sensitivity, both for wayside and locomotive 
components, the maintenance costs were 59.04 percent of the total cost savings when discounted 
at 7 percent, and 65.87 percent of that total when discounted at 3 percent.

4.0 Costs – Diminished Benefit of Accident Reduction  
 
The costs associated with the proposed rule come from a reduction of the benefits that would 
have resulted from implementation of PTC components along certain lines beginning in 2015 
and are comprised of foregone accident prevention benefits.  In the analysis of the 2010 PTC 
rule, FRA estimated that the benefit in 2015 would have been $55,351,026 and in subsequent 
years it would have been $65,118,854.  In order to estimate the cost impact of eliminating the 
two tests in this analysis, the reduced benefit of the 2010 PTC rule in the year 2015 is estimated 
to be half of the reduced benefit of each of the subsequent years beginning in 2016.  Since half of 
the implementation costs avoided would have been incurred in 2014, and half in 2015, the safety 
impacts should be considered until 2015 and 2016, respectively.  The track removal from the 
network would not affect the accident reduction that would have taken place in absence of this 
proposal until after it would have been placed in service.   
 
The proposal to eliminate both tests for exclusion of PTC lines would not come close to 
eliminating the benefits of the PTC rule to the same extent as the costs for several reasons.  For 
example, the “headline accidents” in the analysis of the PTC rule either involve a passenger train 
or a substantial release of PIH material, neither of which is likely to occur on the segments that 
would be withdrawn from the PTC network under the proposed rule.  Headline accidents were 
41.08 percent of the total accident reduction benefits in the analysis of the 2010 PTC rule, and 
other accidents comprised the remaining 58.92 percent—only the latter types of accidents are 
likely to be affected by the proposed rule.  FRA seeks comment on the exclusion of headline 
accidents from foregone benefits of the proposed rule. 
 
The rerouted traffic will not add to the risk on the lines they are rerouted to, as they will be 
rerouted either to PTC-equipped lines or to relatively low volume lines subject to the de minimis 
exception, hence to lines with equal or less risk.  In other words the risk would be “transferred” 
from one line to another.  However, the remaining traffic on lines no longer equipped with PTC 
would no longer benefit from the reduced risk.   
 
In the 2010 PTC rule analysis, FRA estimated that PTC wayside components would be installed 
on roughly 70,000 miles, and AAR Congressional testimony also refers to a PTC network of 
70,000 miles.  Thus, this analysis also uses a 70,000 mile network as the basis for analysis.  As 
with the cost savings analysis, the benefit reduction analysis presents the expected impacts of 
10.000 miles excluded as well as the impacts associated with case in which 7,000 and 14,000 
miles are excluded.  In the high case, the railroads would reduce their PTC network mileage by 
14,000 miles, which is 20 percent of the 70,000 mile network. (20 percent x 70,000 = 14,000)  
FRA, based on its review of the AAR submitted data, also assumed for this analysis that the 
segments from which PIH traffic is rerouted or eliminated have relatively less dense traffic, 
which reduces accident exposure, than the average segment along which PTC must be 
implemented due to the presence of PIH or passenger trains.  Thus, FRA used an estimate of 60 
percent of average risk for those segments.  FRA requests comments on this assumption.   
 
  
26 
 
Therefore, in the high case, the risk increase would be 7.07 percent determined as follows: 
 
    58.92 percent (the non-headline accident percentage) 
x 20 percent, (14,000 miles excluded divided by the total system of 70,000 miles)  
x 60 percent (the relative accident exposure on those segments)   
    7.07 percent 
 
This means that excluding the segments in the high case would increase risk by 7.07 percent of 
the total risk avoided as estimated in the analysis of the 2010 PTC rule.  The value of the total 
risk avoided was $65,118,854 per year, beginning in 2016.  Therefore, in the years when the full 
impact of the proposal eventuates, the increased accident risk would be $4,604,163 per year 
(7.07 percent of $65,116,854).  This impact would occur in years 2016 and beyond.  In 2015, 
only half the impact would occur, so the accident risk increase would be half that, or $2,302,082.  
Similar calculations were applied to the expected and low cases, but because the high case was a 
relatively even percentage (20 percent of the total system), FRA used the high case in this 
instance to illustrate the mechanics of the calculations.  All the calculations are shown in the 
following table.

For purposes of this analysis, FRA assumed that the proportion of costs attributable to each 
accident cost element would be the same as in the analysis of the 2010 PTC rule.  For example, 
fatality costs ($16,457,143 per year in PTC preventable accidents (PPA) costs avoided) were 
42.89 percent of the annual accident reduction benefit ($38,368,895) in the analysis of the 2010 
PTC rule. Likewise, they represent 42.89 percent of the foregone accident reduction in this 
analysis.  For a more thorough discussion of PPAs please see FRA’s analysis of the PTC Rule.4  
The proportion of costs (by element) are shown in Table 6.

5.0 Relationship Between Benefits and Costs 
 
Under the expected case, as well as the two other cases analyzed for sensitivity purposes, the 
cost-saving benefits are far greater than the foregone accident reduction costs.  The net benefits 
are summarized in Table 8.

In conclusion, FRA believes that the benefits of the proposed rule to provide regulatory relief  
are far in excess of the costs.  The $593 million (discounted at 7 percent over 20 years) or  
$779 million (discounted at 3 percent over 20 years) that would not be spent on PTC 
implementation along lower-risk routes would be freed for use in capacity enhancements and 
other initiatives with higher economic and safety return.  This rulemaking is consistent with the 
expressed goals of EO 13563 to design regulations so that they are cost-effective, evidence-based 
and compatible with economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness.   
 
FRA seeks comments on all aspects of this analysis.
