As discussed in section IV.C.3, based on the engineering analysis, DOE included updated manufacturer production costs (MPCs) for Product Class 1 and new MPCs for Product Class 2. For the SNOPR DOE updated its engineering analysis to 2010$ using the PPI. DOE also incorporated price trends into the analysis. Incorporating prices trends rather than assuming prices remain fixed in real terms throughout the analysis also impacts the MIA results. DOE used the default prices trends in the NIA starting in the base year of the analysis (2011) and continuing through the end of the analysis period (2043). DOE also assumed that MPCs and MSPs were similarly impacted by price trends in both the base case and standards cases.

<title>Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), DOE has determined that the proposed rule fits within the category of actions included in Categorical Exclusion (CX) B5.1 and otherwise meets the requirements for application of a CX. (See 10 CFR 1021.410(b) and Appendix B to Subpart D) The proposed rule fits within this category of actions because it is a rulemaking that establishes energy conservation standards for consumer products or industrial equipment, and for which none of the exceptions identified in CX B5.1(b) apply. Therefore, DOE has made a CX determination for this rulemaking, and DOE does not need to prepare an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement for this proposed rule. DOE’s CX determination for this proposed rule is available at http://cxnepa.energy.gov.</title>
