65263 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 204 / Friday, October 22, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
C. Description of the Proposed 
Interpretive Rule 
The proposed interpretive rule would 
amend part 1450. Section 1450.1, Scope, 
would explain that part 1450 pertains to 
the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa 
Safety Act and that the statute is 
designed to prevent child drowning, 
drain entrapments, and eviscerations in 
pools and spas. 
Section 1450.2, Definitions, would 
define ‘‘public accommodations facility’’ 
at paragraph (a) as ‘‘an inn, hotel, motel, 
or other place of lodging, including, but 
not limited to, rental units rented on a 
bi-weekly or weekly basis.’’

CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY 
COMMISSION 
16 CFR Part 1450 
Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa 
Safety Act; Public Accommodation; 
Withdrawal of Proposed Rule 
AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety 
Commission. 
ACTION: Withdrawal of proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: In the Federal Register of 
March 15, 2010, the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission (‘‘CPSC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) issued a proposed 
interpretive rule that would interpret 
the term ‘‘public accommodations 
facility’’ as used in the Virginia Graeme 
Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act (‘‘VGB 
Act’’ or ‘‘Act’’) as ‘‘an inn, hotel, motel, 
or other place of lodging, except for an 
establishment located within a building 
that contains not more than five rooms 
for rent or hire and that is actually 
occupied by the proprietor of such 
establishment as the residence of such 
proprietor’’ (75 FR 12167). The 
Commission is withdrawing the March 
15, 2010 proposed interpretive rule and, 
elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 
Register, is issuing a new proposed 
interpretive rule with a 60-day comment 
period which would interpret ‘‘public 
accommodations facility’’ as ‘‘an inn, 
hotel, motel, or other place of lodging, 
including but not limited to, rental units 
rented on a bi-weekly or weekly basis.’’ 
DATES: The proposed interpretive rule is 
withdrawn as of October 22, 2010.

Counsel, Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, 4330 East West Highway,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The 
Commission published a proposed 
interpretive rule on the definition of 
‘‘public accommodations facility in the 
Federal Register of March 15, 2010 (75 
FR 12167). The proposed interpretive 
rule would interpret ‘‘public 
accommodations facility’’ to mean: ‘‘An 
inn, hotel, motel, or other place of 
lodging, except for an establishment 
located within a building that contains 
not more than five rooms for rent or hire 
and that is actually occupied by the 
proprietor of such establishment as the 
residence of such proprietor.’’ 
CPSC staff prepared a draft final 
interpretative rule for the Commission’s 
approval, but, on August 4, 2010, the 
Commission voted to withdraw the 
proposed interpretive rule and to direct 
CPSC staff to draft a new proposed 
interpretive rule with a 60-day comment 
period and interpreting ‘‘public 
accommodations facility’’ as ‘‘an inn, 
hotel, motel, or other place of lodging, 
including, but not limited to, rental 
units rented on a bi-weekly or weekly 
basis.’’ The Commission preliminarily 
determined that the exception for an 
owner-occupied establishment located 
within a building that contains not more 
than five rooms for rent or hire is 
inappropriate in the context of pool and 
spa safety because the number of units 
for rent or hire has no bearing on the 
safety of the pool. In addition, the 
Commission wanted to make clear that 
a residential facility may become a 
‘‘place of lodging’’ if the facility were to 
offer a significant number of short term 
stays. 
Thus, the Commission, through this 
notice, is withdrawing the March 15, 
2010 proposed interpretive rule. 
Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 
Register, the Commission is issuing a 
new proposed interpretive rule to 
interpret ‘‘public accommodations 
facility’’ in the VGB Act as ‘‘an inn, 
hotel, motel, or other place of lodging, 
including, but not limited to, rental 
units rented on a bi-weekly or weekly 
basis.’’ 
Dated: October 15, 2010.

part of the investment advisor. The 
proposed rule takes account of 
significant changes in both the financial 
industry and the expectations of plan 
officials and participants who receive 
investment advice; it is designed to 
protect participants from conflicts of 
interest and self-dealing by giving a 
broader and clearer understanding of 
when persons providing such advice are 
subject to ERISA’s fiduciary standards. 
For example, the proposed rule would 
define certain advisers as fiduciaries 
even if they do not provide advice on 
a ‘‘regular basis.’’ Upon adoption, the 
proposed rule would affect sponsors, 
fiduciaries, participants, and 
beneficiaries of pension plans and 
individual retirement accounts, as well 
as providers of investment and 
investment advice related services to 
such plans and accounts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Background 
The Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is a 
comprehensive statute designed to 
promote the interests of participants in 
employee benefit plans and their 
beneficiaries by establishing standards 
of conduct, responsibility, and 
obligation for fiduciaries of those plans. 
ERISA imposes a number of stringent 
duties on those who act as plan 
fiduciaries, including a duty of 
undivided loyalty, a duty to act for the 
exclusive purposes of providing plan 
benefits and defraying reasonable 
expenses of administering the plan, and 
a stringent duty of care grounded in the 
prudent man standard from trust law.1 
Congress supplemented these general 
duties by categorically barring, subject 
to exemption, certain ‘‘prohibited’’ 
transactions.2 Fiduciaries are personally 
liable for losses sustained by a plan that 
result from a violation of these rules.3 
Section 3(21)(A) of ERISA provides in 
relevant part that a person is a fiduciary 
with respect to a plan to the extent (i) 
it exercises any discretionary authority 
or discretionary control with respect to 
management of such plan or exercises 
any authority or control with respect to 
management or disposition of its assets, 
(ii) it renders investment advice for a fee 
or other compensation, direct or 
indirect, with respect to any moneys or 
other property of such plan, or has any 
authority or responsibility to do so, or 
(iii) it has any discretionary authority or 
discretionary responsibility in the 
administration of such plan.4 On its 
face, section 3(21)(A)(ii) sets out a 
simple two-part test for determining 
fiduciary status: A person renders 
investment advice with respect to any 
moneys or other property of a plan, or 
has any authority or responsibility to do 
so; and the person receives a fee or other 
compensation, direct or indirect, for 
doing so. 
In 1975, shortly after ERISA was 
enacted, the Department issued a 
regulation, at 29 CFR 2510.3–21(c), that 
defines the circumstances under which 
a person renders ‘‘investment advice’’ to 
an employee benefit plan within the 
meaning of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of 
ERISA.5 A person who renders 
‘‘investment advice’’ under the 
regulation, and receives a fee or other 
compensation, direct or indirect, for 
doing so, is a fiduciary under section 
3(21)(A)(ii). The current regulation 
provides in relevant part as follows: 
(c) Investment advice. (1) A person shall be 
deemed to be rendering ‘‘investment advice’’ 
to an employee benefit plan, within the 
meaning of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974 (the Act) and this paragraph, only if: 
(i) Such person renders advice to the plan 
as to the value of securities or other property, 
or makes recommendation as to the 
advisability of investing in, purchasing, or 
selling securities or other property; and 
(ii) Such person either directly or 
indirectly (e.g., through or together with any 
affiliate)— 
(A) Has discretionary authority or control, 
whether or not pursuant to agreement, 
arrangement or understanding, with respect 
to purchasing or selling securities or other 
property for the plan; or 
(B) Renders any advice described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section on a regular 
basis to the plan pursuant to a mutual 
agreement, arrangement or understanding, 
written or otherwise, between such person 
and the plan or a fiduciary with respect to 
the plan, that such services will serve as a 
primary basis for investment decisions with 
respect to plan assets, and that such person 
will render individualized investment advice 
to the plan based on the particular needs of 
the plan regarding such matters as, among 
other things, investment policies or strategy, 
overall portfolio composition, or 
diversification of plan investments. 
The regulation significantly narrows 
the plain language of section 
3(21)(A)(ii), creating a 5-part test that 
must be satisfied in order for a person 
to be treated as a fiduciary by reason of 
rendering investment advice. For advice 
to constitute ‘‘investment advice,’’ an 
adviser who does not have discretionary 
authority or control with respect to the 
purchase or sale of securities or other 
property for the plan must— 
(1) Render advice as to the value of 
securities or other property, or make 
recommendations as to the advisability 
of investing in, purchasing or selling 
securities or other property 
(2) On a regular basis 
(3) Pursuant to a mutual agreement, 
arrangement or understanding, with the 
plan or a plan fiduciary, that 
(4) The advice will serve as a primary 
basis for investment decisions with 
respect to plan assets, and that 
(5) The advice will be individualized 
based on the particular needs of the 
plan. 
The Department further limited the 
term ‘‘investment advice’’ in a 1976 
advisory opinion. Under the facts 
described therein, the Department 
concluded that a valuation of closely- 
held employer securities that an 
employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)

6 Advisory Opinion 76–65A (June 7, 1976) (AO 
76–65A). 
7 The Department’s Employee Benefits Security 
Administration (EBSA) maintains a national 
enforcement project designed to identify and 
correct violations of ERISA in connection with 
Employee Stock Ownership Plans. One of the most 
common violations found is the incorrect valuation 
of employer securities. Another project, the 
Consultant/Adviser project (CAP) focuses on ERISA 
violations that may occur in connection with the 
receipt of improper, undisclosed compensation by 
pension consultants and other investment advisers.

projects can be found at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/

would rely on in purchasing the 
securities would not constitute 
investment advice under the 
regulation.6 
The current regulation has not been 
updated since its promulgation in 1975. 
Since that time, however, the retirement 
plan community has changed 
significantly, with a shift from defined 
benefit (DB) plans to defined 
contribution (DC) plans. The financial 
marketplace also has changed 
significantly, and the types and 
complexity of investment products and 
services available to plans have 
increased. With the resulting changes in 
plan investment practices, and 
relationships between advisers and their 
plan clients, the Department believes 
there is a need to re-examine the types 
of advisory relationships that should 
give rise to fiduciary duties on the part 
of those providing advisory services. In 
this regard, we note that recent 
Department enforcement initiatives 
indicate there are a variety of 
circumstances, outside those described 
in the current regulation, under which 
plan fiduciaries seek out impartial 
assistance and expertise of persons such 
as consultants, advisers and appraisers 
to advise them on investment-related 
matters.7 These persons significantly 
influence the decisions of plan 
fiduciaries, and have a considerable 
impact on plan investments. However, if 
these advisers are not fiduciaries under 
ERISA, they may operate with conflicts 
of interest that they need not disclose to 
the plan fiduciaries who expect 
impartiality and often must rely on their 
expertise, and have limited liability 
under ERISA for the advice they 
provide. Recent testimony by the 
Government Accountability Office 
noted an association between pension 
consultants with undisclosed conflicts 
of interest and lower returns for their 
client plans.8 The Department believes 
that amending the current regulation to 
establish additional circumstances 
where investment advice providers are 
subject to ERISA’s fiduciary 
responsibilities would better protect the 
interests of plans and their participants 
and beneficiaries. As a consequence of 
the current regulation, the Department’s 
investigations of investment advisers 
must focus on establishing each of the 
elements of the 5-part test rather than on 
the precise misconduct at issue in 
particular cases. Even if an adviser 
advises a plan about its investments for 
a fee, the plan relied upon the advice 
based upon reasonable belief that it was 
impartial, and the advice was wholly 
abusive, the Department must still prove 
each of the test’s five elements in order 
to assert a fiduciary breach. The 
Department does not believe that this 
approach to fiduciary status is 
compelled by the statutory language. 
Nor does the Department believe the 
current framework represents the most 
effective means of distinguishing 
persons who should be held 
accountable as fiduciaries from those 
who should not. For these reasons, the 
Department believes it is appropriate to 
update the ‘‘investment advice’’ 
definition to better ensure that persons, 
in fact, providing investment advice to 
plan fiduciaries and/or plan participants 
and beneficiaries are subject to ERISA’s 
standards of fiduciary conduct. 
B. Overview of Proposal 
1. Proposed Amendment to Regulation 
Under ERISA Section 3(21)(A)(ii) 
In general, the proposal amends 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 2510.3–21 by 
striking the current paragraph (c)(1), 
redesignating the current paragraph 
(c)(2) as paragraph (c)(5), and adding 
new paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4). 
New paragraph (c)(1) sets out the 
general rule that a person renders 
‘‘investment advice’’ for a fee or other 
compensation, direct or indirect, to an 
employee benefit plan, within the 
meaning of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA 
and the regulation, if the person 
provides advice or makes 
recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i), directly or indirectly 
meets any of the conditions described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii), and receives a fee or 
other compensation, direct or indirect, 
for providing such advice or 
recommendations. New paragraph (c)(2) 
sets forth certain limitations in the 
application of paragraph (c). New 
paragraph (c)(3) provides guidance with 
respect to the meaning of the term ‘‘fee 
or other compensation, direct or 
indirect,’’ as used in section 3(21)(A)(ii) 
of ERISA. New paragraph (c)(4) clarifies 
the proposed amendment would apply 
for purposes of Code section 4975. 
a. Description of Advice 
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of the 
proposal, the types of advice and 
recommendations that may result in 
fiduciary status under ERISA section 
3(21)(A)(ii) are: Advice, appraisals or 
fairness opinions concerning the value 
of securities or other property; 
recommendations as to the advisability 
of investing in, purchasing, holding, or 
selling securities or other property; or 
advice or recommendations as to the 
management of securities or other 
property. 
This provision encompasses the same 
types of investment-related advice and 
recommendations as covered by 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the current 
regulation, except for the following 
modifications. First, the proposal 
specifically includes the provision of 
appraisals and fairness opinions. As 
discussed above, the Department 
concluded in AO 76–65A that a 
valuation of closely held employer 
securities that would be relied on in the 
purchase of the securities by an ESOP 
would not constitute investment advice 
under the current regulation. However, 
a common problem identified in the 
Department’s recent ESOP national 
enforcement project involves the 
incorrect valuation of employer 
securities.9 Among these are cases 
where plan fiduciaries have reasonably 
relied on faulty valuations prepared by 
professional appraisers. The Department 
believes that application of the proposal 
to appraisals and fairness opinions 
rendered in connection with plan 
transactions may directly or indirectly 
address these issues, and align the 
duties of persons who provide these 
opinions with those of fiduciaries who 
rely on them. Accordingly, paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(1) of the proposal 
specifically includes the provision of 
appraisals and fairness opinions 
concerning the value of securities or 
other property. This paragraph is 
intended to supersede the Department’s 
conclusion in AO 76–65A, but is not 
limited to employer securities. 
Therefore, if a person is retained by a 
plan fiduciary to appraise real estate 
being offered to the plan for purchase, 
then the provision of the appraisal 
would fall within paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(1) of the proposal, and may 
result in fiduciary status under ERISA 
section 3(21)(A)(ii). The Department 
would expect a fiduciary appraiser’s 
determination of value to be unbiased, 
fair, and objective, and to be made in 
good faith and based on a prudent 
investigation under the prevailing

10 The fiduciary act of managing plan assets that 
are shares of corporate stock include the 
management of voting rights appurtenant to those 
shares of stock. 29 CFR 2509.08–2. 
11 See 29 CFR 2509.96–1(c). 
12 Advisory Opinion 2005–23A (Dec. 7, 2005). 
circumstances then known to the 
appraiser. 
Second, the proposal at paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(3) makes specific reference 
to advice and recommendations as to 
the management of securities or other 
property. This would include, for 
instance, advice and recommendations 
as to the exercise of rights appurtenant 
to shares of stock (e.g., voting proxies),10 
and as to the selection of persons to 
manage plan investments. 
Finally, the proposal at paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B) makes clear that fiduciary 
status under section 3(21)(A)(ii) may 
result from the provision of advice or 
recommendations not only to a plan 
fiduciary, but also to a plan participant 
or beneficiary. This reflects the 
Department’s long-standing 
interpretation of the current 
regulation.11 The Department notes that 
it also has taken the position that, as a 
general matter, a recommendation to a 
plan participant to take an otherwise 
permissible plan distribution does not 
constitute investment advice within the 
meaning of the current regulation, even 
when that advice is combined with a 
recommendation as to how the 
distribution should be invested.12 
Concerns have been expressed that, as a 
result of this position, plan participants 
may not be adequately protected from 
advisers who provide distribution 
recommendations that subordinate 
participants’ interests to the advisers’ 
own interests. The Department, 
therefore, is requesting comment on 
whether and to what extent the final 
regulation should define the provision 
of investment advice to encompass 
recommendations related to taking a 
plan distribution. The Department is 
specifically interested in information on 
other laws that apply to the provision of 
these types of recommendations, 
whether and how those laws safeguard 
the interests of plan participants, and 
the costs and benefits associated with 
extending the regulation to these types 
of recommendations. 
b. Conditions 
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of the proposal 
sets forth alternative conditions, at 
paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) through (D), at 
least one of which must be met by a 
person rendering advice described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) in order for the 
person to be considered rendering 
investment advice under the proposal. 
The conditions may be met by the 
person acting directly or indirectly, 
such as through or together with an 
affiliate. These alternative conditions 
generally relate to the degree of 
authority, control, responsibility or 
influence that is possessed, directly or 
indirectly, by the person rendering the 
advice, and the reasonable expectations 
of the persons receiving the advice. The 
conditions at paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(B) and 
(D) of the proposal are based on 
paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of the 
current regulation (which include 
elements of the 5-part test described 
above), but with modifications to 
simplify their application and broaden 
their scope. The conditions at 
paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) and (C) are new, 
and are intended to broaden the scope 
of the regulation based on readily- 
ascertainable criteria. 
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of the proposal 
includes persons providing advice or 
recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) that represent or 
acknowledge that they are acting as a 
fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA 
with respect to such advice or 
recommendations. The Department 
believes that explicitly claiming ERISA 
fiduciary status, orally or in writing, 
enhances the adviser’s influence, and 
gives the advice recipient a reasonable 
expectation that the advice will be 
impartial and prudent. Therefore such a 
representation or acknowledgment in 
connection with provision of the advice 
or recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) is sufficient under the 
proposal to result in fiduciary status 
under section 3(21)(A)(ii) if provided for 
a fee or other compensation, direct or 
indirect. 
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of the proposal 
includes persons providing the types of 
investment-related advice or 
recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) that are fiduciaries 
with respect to the plan within the 
meaning of section 3(21)(A)(i) or (iii) of 
ERISA. This provision is based on the 
condition in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of 
the current regulation, which is met if 
the person rendering advice directly or 
indirectly has discretionary authority or 
control with respect to purchasing or 
selling securities or other property for 
the plan. However, the proposal 
broadens the scope of this condition by 
referencing a person who is a fiduciary 
within the meaning of section 
3(21)(A)(i) or (iii) of ERISA, which is not 
limited to persons with authority or 
control relating to purchases or sales of 
investments for a plan. Specifically, 
section 3(21)(A)(i) and (iii) describe any 
person who exercises any discretionary 
authority or discretionary control with 
respect to management of the plan, 
exercises any authority or control with 
respect to management or disposition of 
its assets, or has any discretionary 
authority or discretionary responsibility 
in the administration of the plan. 
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) includes 
persons providing advice or 
recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) that are investment 
advisers within the meaning of section 
202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), 15 U.S.C. 
80b–2(a)(11). This section generally 
defines an ‘‘investment adviser’’ as any 
person who, for compensation, engages 
in the business of advising others as to 
the value of securities or the advisability 
of investing in, purchasing, or selling 
securities, or who promulgates analyses 
or reports concerning securities. 
However, section 202(a)(11) specifically 
excludes the following: (1) A bank, or 
any bank holding company as defined 
in the Bank Holding Company Act of 
1956, which is not an investment 
company, except that the term 
‘‘investment adviser’’ includes any bank 
or bank holding company to the extent 
that such bank or bank holding 
company serves or acts as an investment 
adviser to a registered investment 
company, but if such services or actions 
are performed through a separately 
identifiable department or division of a 
bank, the department or division, and 
not the bank itself, is deemed to be the 
investment adviser; (2) any lawyer, 
accountant, engineer, or teacher whose 
performance of such services is solely 
incidental to the practice of his or her 
profession; (3) any broker or dealer 
whose performance of such services is 
solely incidental to the conduct of his 
business as a broker or dealer and who 
receives no special compensation 
therefor; (4) the publisher of any bona 
fide newspaper, news magazine or 
business or financial publication of 
general and regular circulation; (5) any 
person whose advice, analyses, or 
reports relate to no securities other than 
securities which are direct obligations of 
or obligations guaranteed as to principal 
or interest by the United States, or 
securities issued or guaranteed by 
corporations in which the United States 
has a direct or indirect interest which 
shall have been designated by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to 
section 3(a)(12) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as exempted 
securities for the purposes of that Act; 
(6) any nationally recognized statistical 
rating organization, as that term is 
defined in section 3(a)(62) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unless 
such organization engages in issuing 
recommendations as to purchasing,

65267 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 204 / Friday, October 22, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
13 See Advisers Act section 202(a)(11)(A)–(G), 15 
U.S.C. 80b–2(a)(11)(A)–(G). 
14 SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 
375 U.S. 180 (1963). 
15 SEC Advisers Act Rel. No. 1393 (Nov. 29, 
1993). 
selling, or holding securities or in 
managing assets, consisting in whole or 
in part of securities, on behalf of others; 
or (7) such other persons designated by 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) by rules, regulations 
or orders.13 Courts have determined that 
these investment advisers owe fiduciary 
duties to their clients under the 
Advisers Act.14 In this regard, the SEC 
has stated: ‘‘the Investment Advisers Act 
imposes on investment advisers an 
affirmative duty to their clients of 
utmost good faith, full and fair 
disclosure of all material facts, and an 
obligation to employ reasonable care to 
avoid misleading their clients.’’ 15 Thus, 
the Department proposes to include 
these persons under the regulation. 
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) includes 
persons that provide advice or make 
recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) pursuant to an 
agreement, arrangement or 
understanding, written or otherwise, 
between such person(s) and the plan, a 
plan fiduciary, or a plan participant or 
beneficiary, that such advice may be 
considered in connection with making 
investment or management decisions 
with respect to plan assets, and will be 
individualized to the needs of the plan, 
a plan fiduciary, or a participant or 
beneficiary. 
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of the proposal 
is based on the elements of the 5-part 
test contained in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) 
of the current regulation which, as 
described above, requires that a person 
render advice on a regular basis to the 
plan pursuant to a mutual agreement, 
arrangement or understanding, written 
or otherwise, between such person and 
the plan or a fiduciary with respect to 
the plan, that such services will serve as 
a primary basis for investment decisions 
with respect to plan assets, and that 
such person will render individualized 
investment advice to the plan based on 
the particular needs of the plan 
regarding such matters as, among other 
things, investment policies or strategy, 
overall portfolio composition, or 
diversification of plan investments. The 
Department notes several differences 
between the proposal and current 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B). The proposal 
does not require the advice to be 
provided on a regular basis. The 
Department has observed that in those 
instances where a plan fiduciary retains 
a service provider such as a consultant 
or appraiser to render advice, it often 
involves discrete advice with respect to 
distinct investment transactions, such as 
a purchase of employer securities. The 
Department does not believe that the 
significance of the advice on a plan 
fiduciary’s decisions diminishes merely 
because it is rendered only once, rather 
than on a regular basis, or that fiduciary 
status under section 3(21)(A)(ii) should 
depend on such a distinction. For 
example, a fiduciary may retain a 
person to provide advice on a particular 
real estate investment in the plan’s 
portfolio, and never have a reason to use 
this adviser again. Nevertheless, such 
advice may be critical to an important 
investment decision and the plan’s 
agreement with the adviser may give the 
plan every expectation that the adviser 
is competent and has no conflicts of 
interest. The Department also believes 
that removal of the regular basis 
requirement will help address 
uncertainty under the current regulation 
by eliminating difficult factual 
questions relating to what constitutes a 
regular basis, and when it begins and 
ends, and by making clear that fiduciary 
status applies to each instance advice is 
rendered. 
The proposal also does not require 
that the parties have a mutual 
understanding that the advice will serve 
as a primary basis for plan investment 
decisions. Nothing in ERISA compels 
conditioning fiduciary status on a 
requirement that an adviser and plan 
fiduciary have a mutual understanding 
as to the primacy of the advice given, in 
relation to other advice or information 
that the fiduciary may consider in 
making a decision. The Department 
believes that when a service provider is 
retained to render advice, the plan 
should generally be able to rely on the 
advice without regard to whether the 
parties intend it be a primary or lesser 
basis in the fiduciary’s decision-making. 
For example, in a complex investment 
decision, a plan fiduciary may need to 
consult advisers with different areas of 
investment expertise in order to make a 
prudent decision. The relative 
importance of the different kinds of 
advice that the plan fiduciary obtains 
may be impossible to discern, and 
should not affect the question of 
whether the adviser is a fiduciary. 
Accordingly, under the proposal it is 
sufficient if the understanding of the 
parties is that the advice will be 
considered in connection with making a 
decision relating to plan assets. The 
Department also believes this 
modification will simplify this 
condition by eliminating difficult 
factual issues surrounding the primacy 
of the advice rendered. Other changes 
are editorial in nature and intended to 
improve the readability of the provision. 
It is important to note generally that 
paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A), (B), (C) and (D) 
are independent, alternative conditions. 
Satisfaction of any one of these 
alternative conditions may result in 
fiduciary investment advice under the 
proposal if paragraph (c)(1)(i) also is 
satisfied. For example, a bank or a 
broker dealer that provides investment 
advice or recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) might fall within an 
exclusion from the definition of 
‘‘investment adviser’’ in section 
202(a)(11) of the Advisers Act, and 
therefore might not meet paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(C) of the proposal. 
Notwithstanding this exclusion, if the 
bank or broker dealer meets the 
requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A), 
(B) or (D), it would nevertheless be 
considered to render investment advice 
under the proposal. 
c. Limitations 
Paragraphs (c)(2) of the proposal sets 
forth certain limitations with respect to 
the application of paragraph (c)(1). 
Paragraph (c)(2)(i) provides that a 
person shall not be considered to be a 
person described in paragraph (c)(1) 
with respect to the provision of advice 
or recommendations if, with respect to 
a person other than a person described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A), such person 
can demonstrate that the recipient of the 
advice knows or, under the 
circumstances, reasonably should know, 
that the person is providing the advice 
or making the recommendation in its 
capacity as a purchaser or seller of a 
security or other property, or as an agent 
of, or appraiser for, such a purchaser or 
seller, whose interests are adverse to the 
interests of the plan or its participants 
or beneficiaries, and that the person is 
not undertaking to provide impartial 
investment advice. This provision 
reflects the Department’s understanding 
that, in the context of selling 
investments to a purchaser, a seller’s 
communications with the purchaser 
may involve advice or 
recommendations, within paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of the proposal, concerning the 
investments offered. The Department 
has determined that such 
communications ordinarily should not 
result in fiduciary status under the 
proposal if the purchaser knows of the 
person’s status as a seller whose 
interests are adverse to those of the 
purchaser, and that the person is not 
undertaking to provide impartial 
investment advice. However, the 
Department believes there is an inherent 
expectation of impartial investment 
advice from a person described in

65268 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 204 / Friday, October 22, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
16 The Department notes that, because such a 
fiduciary would be a party in interest to the plan 
under section 3(14)(A) of ERISA, such a transaction 
would be prohibited by section 406(a) of ERISA 
unless exempt pursuant to an available statutory or 
administrative prohibited transaction exemption. 
17 The Department is not addressing any issues 
under the Advisers Act related to such a 
transaction. 18 See generally 29 CFR 2509.96–1(d). 
19 The Department notes, however, that such a 
service provider’s substitution or deletion of 
investment options selected by a plan fiduciary 
may, depending on the surrounding facts and 
circumstances, constitute an exercise of ‘‘authority 
or control respecting management or disposition of 
[a plan’s] assets’’ within the meaning of section 
3(21)(A)(i) of ERISA. See Advisory Opinion 97–16A 
(May 22, 1997). 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) (involving 
representations or acknowledgment of 
ERISA fiduciary status with respect to 
providing advice or recommendations). 
Accordingly, paragraph (c)(2)(i) does not 
apply to such a person. 
As an example, if a person selling 
securities to a plan is a fiduciary of the 
plan under section 3(21)(A)(i) or (iii) of 
ERISA (and therefore in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(B) of the proposal),16 or is an 
investment adviser as defined in the 
Advisers Act (and therefore in 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of the proposal),17 
then the person may seek to utilize 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) to avoid fiduciary 
status under the proposal in connection 
with the sale. However, if the person 
also makes a representation of ERISA 
fiduciary status in connection with the 
sale, orally or in writing, then paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) would not be available. The 
Department intends that a person 
seeking to avoid fiduciary status under 
the proposal by reason of the 
application of paragraph (c)(2)(i) must 
demonstrate compliance with all 
applicable requirements of the 
limitation. 
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) describes certain 
activities taken in connection with 
individual account plans that will not, 
in and of themselves, be treated as 
rendering investment advice for 
purposes of ERISA section 3(21)(A)(ii). 
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) clarifies that the 
provision of investment education 
information and materials described in 
29 CFR 2509.96–1(d) will not constitute 
the rendering of investment advice 
under section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA. In 
29 CFR 2509.96–1(d), the Department 
identified four specific categories of 
information and materials which, if 
furnished, alone or on combination, to 
plan participants or beneficiaries would 
not result in the rendering of investment 
advice under the current regulation. The 
Department reasoned that these 
categories of information and 
materials—plan information, general 
financial and investment information, 
asset allocation models, and interactive 
materials—would not involve advice or 
recommendations within the meaning of 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the current 
regulation.18 The proposed 
modifications to the advice and 
recommendations described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) would not change 
this conclusion. This is reflected in 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A). The Department 
notes that the information and materials 
described in 29 CFR 2509.96–1(d) 
merely represent examples of the type of 
information and materials that may be 
furnished to a participant or beneficiary 
without being considered the rendering 
of investment advice under the 
proposal. 
Paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) and 
(c)(2)(ii)(C) address certain common 
practices that have developed with the 
growth of participant-directed DC plans. 
Service providers such as recordkeepers 
and third party administrators 
sometimes make available a menu of 
investments from which a plan 
fiduciary selects a more limited menu 
that will be available under the plan for 
participant or beneficiary investment. 
The provider may simply offer a 
‘‘platform’’ of investments from which 
the plan fiduciary selects those 
appropriate for the plan, or the provider 
may select, or assist the plan fiduciary 
in selecting the investments that will be 
available under the plan. The service 
provider also sometimes retains the 
ability to later make changes to the 
plan’s investment menu, subject to 
advance approval by the plan fiduciary. 
In some instances, the provider and the 
plan fiduciary clearly understand that 
the provider is offering investments as 
to which the provider has financial or 
other relationships, and is not 
purporting to provide impartial 
investment advice regarding 
construction of the plan’s investment 
menu. In other instances, the plan 
fiduciary is relying on the provider’s 
impartial expertise in selecting an 
investment menu for the plan. Also, to 
assist in the plan fiduciary’s selection or 
monitoring of investments from those 
made available, such a service provider 
also might provide to the fiduciary 
general financial information and data 
regarding matters such as historic 
performance of asset classes and of the 
investments available through the 
provider. 
To help address any uncertainty as to 
how these arrangements are treated 
under the proposal, the Department is 
clarifying at paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) that, 
with respect to an individual account 
plan, the marketing or making available 
(e.g., through a platform or similar 
mechanism), without regard to the 
individualized needs of the plan, its 
participants, or beneficiaries, securities 
or other property from which a plan 
fiduciary may designate investment 
alternatives into which plan 
participants or beneficiaries may direct 
the investment of assets held in, or 
contributed to, their individual 
accounts, will not, by itself, be treated 
as the rendering of investment advice 
within the meaning of section 
3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA if the person 
making available such investments 
discloses in writing to the plan fiduciary 
that the person is not undertaking to 
provide impartial investment advice.19 
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of the proposal 
further clarifies that, in connection with 
the activities described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(B), the provision of certain 
information and data to assist a plan 
fiduciary’s selection or monitoring of 
such plan investment alternatives will 
not be treated as rendering investment 
advice if the person providing such 
information or data discloses in writing 
to the plan fiduciary that the person is 
not undertaking to provide impartial 
investment advice. 
The Department recognizes that 
compliance with a number of ERISA’s 
reporting and disclosure provisions 
requires information on the value of 
plan assets. The Department does not 
intend, as a general matter, for such 
information provided solely for 
compliance purposes to fall within the 
type of advice described under that 
proposal. Paragraph (c)(2)(iii) provides 
that advice described in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(1) does not encompass the 
preparation of a general report or 
statement that merely reflects the value 
of an investment of a plan or a 
participant or beneficiary, provided for 
purposes of compliance with the 
reporting and disclosure requirements 
of the Act, the Internal Revenue Code, 
and the regulations, forms and 
schedules issued thereunder, unless 
such report involves assets for which 
there is not a generally recognized 
market and serves as a basis on which 
a plan may make distributions to plan 
participants and beneficiaries.

d. Fee Requirement 
A necessary element of fiduciary 
status under section 3(21)(A)(ii) of 
ERISA is that a person must render 
investment advice for a fee or other 
compensation, direct or indirect. 
Paragraph (c)(3) provides that purposes 
of section 3(21)(A)(ii), a fee or other 
compensation, direct or indirect, 
received by a person for rendering 
investment means any fee or 
compensation for the advice received by 
the person (or by an affiliate) from any 
source and any fee or compensation 
incident to the transaction in which the 
investment advice has been rendered or 
will be rendered. For example, the term 
fee or compensation includes, but is not 
limited to, brokerage, mutual fund sales, 
and insurance sales commissions. It 
includes fees and commissions based on 
multiple transactions involving different 
parties. 
e. Application Under Code Section 4975 
Code section 4975(e)(3) contains a 
provision that is parallel to ERISA 
section 3(21)(A)(ii) and defines the term 
‘‘fiduciary’’ for purposes of the 
prohibited transaction excise tax 
provisions in Code section 4975. In 
1975, the Department of the Treasury 
issued a regulation under Code section 
4975(e)(3), found at 26 CFR 54.4975– 
9(c), that parallels 29 CFR 2510.3–21(c). 
Under section 102 of Reorganization 
Plan No. 4 of 1978, 5 U.S.C. App. 1 
(1996), the authority of the Secretary of 
the Treasury to interpret section 4975 of 
the Code has been transferred, with 
certain exceptions not here relevant, to 
the Secretary of Labor. Paragraph (c)(4) 
clarifies that the proposed amendments 
to the definition of the term ‘‘fiduciary’’ 
in 29 CFR 2510.3–21(c) also apply for 
purposes of the application of Code 
section 4975 with respect to any plan 
described in Code section 4975(e)(1), 
regardless of whether such plan is an 
employee benefit plan. 
C. Effective Date 
The Department proposes that the 
regulations contained in this document 
will be effective 180 days after 
publication of the final regulations in 
the Federal Register. The Department 
invites comments on whether the final 
regulations should be made effective on 
a different date. 
D. Request for Comment 
The Department invites comments 
from interested persons on the proposed 
rule. To facilitate the receipt and 
processing of comment letters, the EBSA 
encourages interested persons to submit 
their comments electronically by e-mail 
to e-ORI@dol.gov (enter into subject 
line: Definition of Fiduciary Proposed 
Rule) or by using the Federal 
eRulemaking portal at http:// 
www.regulations.gov. Persons 
submitting comments electronically are 
encouraged not to submit paper copies. 
Persons interested in submitting paper 
copies should send or deliver their 
comments to the Office of Regulations 
and Interpretations, Employee Benefits 
Security Administration, Attn: 
Definition of Fiduciary Proposed Rule, 
Room N–5655, U.S. Department of 
Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., 
Washington, DC 20210. All comments 
will be available to the public, without 
charge, online at http:// 
www.regulations.gov and http:// 
www.dol.gov/ebsa and at the Public 
Disclosure Room, N–1513, Employee 
Benefits Security Administration, U.S. 
Department of Labor, 200 Constitution 
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. 
The comment period for the proposed 
regulations will end 90 days after 
publication of the proposed rule in the 
Federal Register. The Department 
believes that this period of time will 
afford interested persons an adequate 
amount of time to analyze the proposal 
and submit comments. Written 
comments on the proposed rule should 
be submitted to the Department on or 
before January 20, 2011. 
E. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
1. Executive Order 12866 Statement 
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 
51735), the Department must determine 
whether a regulatory action is 
‘‘significant’’ and therefore subject to 
review by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB). Section 3(f) of the 
Executive Order defines a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ as an action that is 
likely to result in a rule (1) having an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more, or adversely and 
materially affecting a sector of the 
economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local or Tribal 
governments or communities (also 
referred to as ‘‘economically 
significant’’); (2) creating a serious 
inconsistency or otherwise interfering 
with an action taken or planned by 
another agency; (3) materially altering 
the budgetary impacts of entitlement 
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
rights and obligations of recipients 
thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or 
policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in the Executive 
Order. OMB has determined that this 
rule is economically significant within 
the meaning of section 3(f)(1) of the 
Executive Order, because it is likely to 
have an effect on the economy of $100 
million in any one year. Accordingly, 
OMB has reviewed the rule pursuant to 
the Executive Order. The Department 
performed a comprehensive, unified 
analysis to estimate the costs and, to the 
extent feasible, provide a qualitative 
assessment of benefits attributable to the 
proposed rule for purposes of 
compliance with Executive Order 12866 
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The 
analysis is summarized in Table 1, 
below.

21 The scope of the regulation was further limited 
by the Department in a 1976 advisory opinion (AO 
76–65), in which it concluded that, under the facts 
described therein, a valuation of closely held 
employer securities that would be relied on in the 
purchase of the securities by an employee stock 
ownership plan (ESOP) would not constitute 
investment advice under the regulation.

vestment advice will discourage harmful conflicts of interest, improve service value, and enhance the Department’s ability to redress abuses 
and more effectively and efficiently allocate its enforcement resources. The proposed regulation also should help plans by giving them a 
means to seek recoupment of losses and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from those newly-considered fiduciaries who engage in misconduct. 
While most of the recoupment will be transfers, they are welfare improving, because they return money to plans that would not have been 
taken from them if the service provider had been acting in the best interest of the plan and its participants and beneficiaries as required by 
ERISA. Given the magnitude of plan assets that may be affected, even a small service value improvement by a moderate number of plans 
could yield economically significant benefits.

tion—Not Quantified. 
Qualitative: An increased number of service providers could become fiduciaries to the plans to whom they provide services. These service pro-
viders could experience higher costs of doing business due to increased liability. To the extent costs and liabilities rise, the plan service pro-
vider market could become compressed if plan service providers leave the market. As more service providers become fiduciaries, more trans-
actions could violate ERISA prohibited transaction rules. Absent applicable prohibited transaction exemptions, service providers would have to 
restructure transactions and/or modify business practices. 
2. Background and Need for Regulatory 
Action 
As stated earlier in this preamble, 
section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA defines a 
fiduciary as a person that renders 
investment advice to a plan for a fee or 
other compensation, direct or indirect, 
with respect to any moneys or other 
property of such plan, or has any 
authority or responsibility to do so. In 
1975, shortly after ERISA was enacted, 
the Department adopted a regulation 20 
that significantly limited the broad 
statutory language. The current 
regulation provides that a person 
provides ‘‘investment advice’’ for 
purposes of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of 
ERISA only if it renders advice as to the 
purchase, sale, or value of securities or 
other property and either has 
discretionary authority or control with 
respect to the purchase of property for 
the plan, or, in the alternative, the 
person (1) renders advice as to the 
purchase, sale, or value of securities or 
other property, (2) on a regular basis, (3) 
pursuant to a mutual agreement, 
arrangement or understanding, written 
or otherwise, between such person and 
the plan or a plan fiduciary, that (4) the 
advice will serve as a primary basis for 
investment decisions with respect to 
plan assets, and that (5) the advice will 
be individualized based on the 
particular needs of the plan (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘‘five-part test’’).21 
Under the current regulation, a plan 
service provider must satisfy each 
element of the five-part test in order to 
be considered a fiduciary under ERISA 
section 3(21)(A)(ii) unless the service 
provider renders advice and has 
discretionary authority or control with 
respect to purchasing or selling 
securities or other property for the plan. 
The current regulation has not been 
updated since it was promulgated in 
1975. Since that time, the design and 
operation of employee benefit plans has 
changed significantly. One of the most 
dramatic changes has been the growth of 
defined contribution (DC) plans, 
specifically, 401(k) plans, which did not 
exist when the current regulation was 
promulgated. Department of Labor data 
show that from 1975 through 2007, the 
percentage of active participants 
covered by DC plans grew from 29% to 
78% and 90% of these active DC plan 
participants were covered by 401(k) 
plans.22 Importantly, about 89% of 
401(k) plans covering 95% of all active 
401(k) plan participants are participant- 
directed, which means that participants 
make investment decisions regarding 
the investment of assets held in their 
individual accounts by choosing from a 
diverse menu of designated investment 
alternatives selected by plan sponsors. 
In 2009, the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) found that 
many opportunities exist in the 401(k) 
marketplace for plans to hire service 
providers that have business 
arrangements that could give rise to 
conflicts of interest.23 For example, the 
GAO noted that plans often hire 
consultants and other advisers to 
provide advice regarding investment 
options and products that should be 
offered under the plan and to monitor 
the performance of the selected 
investments. In some cases, consultants 
receive compensation from the 
investment companies whose products 
they recommend to the plan, which 
could lead them to steer the plans 
toward products for which they receive 
additional compensation. These 
arrangements can be harmful to plan

24 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Office of Compliance Inspections and 
Examinations, Staff Report Concerning Examination 
of Select Pension Consultants (Washington, DC: 
May 16, 2005.). The report’s findings were based on 
a 2002 to 2003 examination of 24 pension 
consultants. The report can be accessed at http:// 
www.sec.gov/news/studies/pensionexamstudy.pdf. 
25 The GAO found that DB pension plans using 
consultants with SEC-identified undisclosed 
conflicts earned returns 130 basis points lower than 
the others, which implies that bias may taint 
consultants’ advice. See e.g., GAO, Conflicts of 
Interest Involving High Risk of Terminated Plans 
Pose Enforcement Challenges, Defined Benefit 
Pension Report (June 2007), at http://www.gao.gov/ 
new.items/d07703.pdf. 
26 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Office of Compliance Inspections and 
Examinations, Staff Report Concerning Examination 
of Select Pension Consultants, p. 6 (Washington, 
DC: May 16, 2005). 
participants, because the plan may pay 
excessive fees for the provided services, 
which could lower returns. Participants 
in participant-directed 401(k) plans are 
especially vulnerable in these 
situations, because they must rely on 
the assets in their individual accounts to 
meet their retirement income needs. 
There also is a greater potential for 
conflicts of interest to exist in the 
defined benefit pension plan service 
provider market than when the current 
regulation was promulgated. Due to the 
increased complexity of investment 
opportunities available to defined 
benefit plans, plan sponsors often seek 
investment advice from a broad range of 
service providers. Some of these service 
providers have business arrangements 
that can give rise to conflicts of interest. 
For example, in a May 2005 study,24 the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) staff found that 13 of the 24 
pension consultants examined or their 
affiliates had undisclosed conflicts of 
interest, because they provided products 
and services to pension plan advisory 
clients, money managers, and mutual 
funds on an ongoing basis without 
adequately disclosing these conflicts. 
The SEC staff also found that the 
majority of examined pension 
consultants had business relationships 
with broker-dealers that raised a number 
of concerns about potential harm to 
pension plans. 
The current regulation’s narrow 
approach to fiduciary status sharply 
limits the Department’s ability to protect 
plans and their participants and 
beneficiaries from conflicts of interest 
that may arise from the diverse and 
complex fee practices existing in today’s 
retirement plan services market and to 
devise effective remedies for 
misconduct when it occurs. In recent 
years, non-fiduciary service providers— 
such as consultants, appraisers, and 
other advisers—have abused their 
relationships with plans by 
recommending investments in exchange 
for undisclosed kickbacks from 
investment providers, engaging in bid- 
rigging, misleading plan fiduciaries 
about the nature and risks associated 
with plans investments, and by giving 
biased,25 incompetent, and unreliable 
valuation opinions. Yet, no matter how 
egregious the abuse, plan consultants 
and advisers have no fiduciary liability 
under ERISA, unless they meet every 
element of the five-part test. 
In instances where a plan has relied 
upon abusive investment advice from a 
self-dealing consultant concerning an 
investment product on a single 
occasion, the Department would be 
unable to bring an action for fiduciary 
breach against the consultant, because 
the ‘‘regular basis’’ element of the 
current regulation’s five-part test would 
not be satisfied. The consultant would 
be absolved of liability regardless of the 
severity of the abuse or the extent of the 
plan’s reliance. This is true even if the 
consultant engaged in precisely the 
same conduct that would have been per 
se illegal if committed by an equally 
culpable consultant that met the current 
regulation’s ‘‘regular basis’’ test. 
For example, a plan’s purchase of 
annuity contracts is a major transaction, 
but it may occur only in connection 
with the plan’s termination. As a result, 
the Department could not pursue a civil 
enforcement action against an insurance 
brokerage company for accepting 
kickbacks from an annuity carrier while 
advising plans for a fee regarding the 
selection of annuity contracts. Even 
where the brokerage company’s 
recommendation was the primary basis 
for the plan’s choice of annuity 
providers, the brokers could not be held 
accountable as fiduciaries because the 
advice would not have been offered on 
a regular basis. 
Another anomaly associated with the 
current regulation is that the five-part 
test applies even to persons who 
represent themselves to the plan as 
fiduciaries in rendering investment 
advice. For example, a consultant could 
hold itself out as a plan fiduciary in a 
written contract with the plan, render 
investment advice for a fee, and still 
evade fiduciary status by showing that 
its advice was insufficiently ‘‘regular,’’ 
did not serve as a ‘‘primary basis’’ for the 
decision, or otherwise failed to meet 
each element of the five-part test. The 
current test also makes it easy for 
consultants to structure their actions to 
avoid fiduciary status. The SEC found 
evidence of this practice in its pension 
consultants examination and made the 
following statement regarding this issue 
in its report: ‘‘Many pension consultants 
believe they have taken appropriate 
actions to insulate themselves from 
being considered a ‘fiduciary’ under 
ERISA. As a result, it appears that many 
consultants believe they do not have 
any fiduciary relationships with their 
advisory clients * * *.’’ 26 
An adviser’s recommendation may 
involve significant sums and matters of 
specialized expertise, and it may 
include professions of impartiality. 
However, unless the advice meets each 
element of the current regulation’s 
5-part test, ERISA’s remedies for lack of 
due diligence and disloyalty are 
unavailable to the plan. 
In contrast, when a fiduciary uses its 
position of trust to enrich itself by 
engaging in self-dealing and 
subordinating the plans’ interests to its 
own, it violates numerous provisions of 
ERISA, including its duty of loyalty 
provided in section 404 of ERISA and 
the prohibitions on self-dealing 
provided in section 406(b) of ERISA. 
Such a fiduciary also exposes itself to 
the broadest possible range of remedies 
under ERISA. 
Applying the current regulation in 
today’s service provider market has had 
a detrimental impact on EBSA’s 
allocation of its enforcement resources. 
EBSA seeks to focus its enforcement 
resources on areas that have the greatest 
impact on the protection of plan assets 
and participants’ benefits. To 
accomplish this goal, EBSA requires its 
field offices to place particular emphasis 
on certain national enforcement 
projects. The determination of fiduciary 
status is particularly important to two 
national enforcement projects: The 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) 
Project and the Consultant/Adviser 
Project (CAP). 
The ESOP project is designed to 
identify and correct violations of ERISA 
in connection with ESOPs, which are 
designed to invest primarily in 
employer securities. CAP focuses on the 
receipt of improper or undisclosed 
compensation by employee benefit plan 
consultants and other investment 
advisers. EBSA’s investigations seek to 
determine whether the receipt of such 
compensation, even when disclosed, 
violates ERISA because the adviser/ 
consultant leveraged its position with a 
benefit plan to generate additional fees 
for itself or its affiliates. When ERISA 
violations are uncovered, EBSA will 
seek corrective action for past violations 
as well as prospective relief to deter 
future violations. 
One of the most critical elements in 
bringing enforcement actions under the 
ESOP and CAP initiatives is establishing

that a service provider is a fiduciary. In 
order to make this determination, 
investigators must gather evidence to 
support a finding for each element of 
the five-part test. In all cases, the 
analysis necessary to determine 
fiduciary status is very fact-intensive 
and requires extensive review of plan 
documents and contracts, client files, 
e-mails, investment documentation, 
accounting records, and interview 
statements to be obtained from service 
providers and their affiliates. 
Consequently, EBSA investigators 
routinely devote disproportionate time 
and resources establishing all elements 
of the five-part test, rather than focusing 
on the precise misconduct at issue in 
particular cases. 
Based on the foregoing, the 
Department has determined that 
regulatory action is necessary to adopt 
a definition of the term ‘‘fiduciary’’ that 
more closely reflects the broad statutory 
definition of the term, recognizes the 
diverse and complex fee practices that 
exist in today’s service provider market 
and their potential conflicts, accounts 
for the shift from DB to DC plans, 
expands the scope of fiduciary 
protections for plans and their 
participants and beneficiaries, and 
permits EBSA investigators and 
attorneys to focus their efforts on the 
adviser’s conduct rather than meeting 
the evidentiary requirements necessary 
to prove that all elements of the current 
regulation’s five-part test are satisfied. 
As discussed in further detail below, the 
Department believes that amending the 
current regulation by broadening the 
scope of service providers that would be 
considered fiduciaries would enhance 
the Department’s ability to redress 
service provider abuses that currently 
exist in the market, such as undisclosed 
fees, misrepresentation of compensation 
arrangements, and biased appraisals of 
the value of employer securities and 
other plan investments. 
4. Affected Entities 
The Department used data from the 
Schedule C of the 2007 Form 5500, the 
latest available complete data, to 
estimate the universe of plan service 
providers that would be affected by the 
proposed rule. Generally, plans with 
100 or more participants are required to 
report on Schedule C persons who 
rendered services to or who had 
transactions with the plan during the 
reporting year if the person received, 
directly or indirectly, $5,000 or more in 
reportable compensation in connection 
with services rendered or their position 
with the plan. The type of services 
provided by each service provider also 
must be reported. Based on the 
Schedule C service codes, the 
Department estimates that 5,300 unique 
service providers most likely provide 
investment- and valuation-related 
services covered under the proposed 
rule that could cause them to be 
considered fiduciaries. In order to 
provide a reasonable estimate, service 
providers reporting service codes 
corresponding to brokerage (real estate), 
brokerage (stocks, bonds, commodities), 
consulting (general), insurance agents 
and brokers, valuation services 
(appraisals, asset valuation, etc.) and 
investment evaluations were assumed to 
provide covered services. Note that the 
code for investment advisory services 
was omitted, because we assume that 
such service providers are ERISA 
fiduciaries. 
The Department acknowledges that its 
estimate may be imprecise. Although 
some small plans file Schedule C, small 
plans generally are not required to 
complete Schedule C. Therefore, there 
would be an underestimate of covered 
services providers to small plans if a 
substantial number of the service 
providers only service small plans. The 
Department, however, believes that its 
estimated number of covered service 
providers is reasonable, because most 
small plans use the same service 
providers as large plans.27 The 
Department invites comments regarding 
this estimate. 
5. Benefits 
The Department expects that 
amending its current regulation defining 
the circumstances under which a person 
is a fiduciary under ERISA as a result of 
providing investment advice will 
discourage harmful conflicts, improve 
service value, and enhance the 
Department’s ability to redress abuses 
and more effectively and efficiently 
allocate its enforcement resources. 
Although the Department is unable to 
quantify these benefits, the Department 
tentatively concludes they would justify 
their cost. 
a. Discouraging Harmful Conflicts 
Harmful arrangements generally are 
those that are tainted by unmitigated 
conflicts. These arrangements occur 
when a plan’s service providers strike 
deals that profit one another at the 
plan’s expense or subordinate the plan’s 
interest to someone else’s. As 
mentioned earlier, in a 2005 report,28 
SEC staff identified certain undisclosed 
arrangements in the business practices 
of pension consultants that can give rise 
to conflicts of interest. The SEC found 
that the objectivity of advice provided 
by the examined pension consultants 
was called into question, because many 
pension consultants provided services 
both to pension plans who are their 
clients and money managers. In the 
report, the SEC stated that this raises 
concerns that pension consultants may 
steer clients to certain money managers 
and other vendors based on the 
consultant’s other business 
relationships and receipt of fees from 
these firms, rather than because 
selecting the money manager or other 
vendor was in the best interest of the 
plan and its participants and 
beneficiaries. 
Also, as noted earlier in this 
Regulatory Impact Analysis, a recent 
GAO study links undisclosed conflicts 
with 130 basis points of 
underperformance in defined benefit 
pension plans.29 A variety of academic 
studies further support the hypothesis 
that conflicts often erode the value 
provided to defined contribution 
pension plans by mutual funds and 
their distribution channels.30 
Beneficial arrangements generally are 
those in which a plan’s service 
providers, in competition to provide the 
best value to the plan, deliver high 
quality services to the plan at the lowest 
cost, and act solely in the interest of 
their plan clients and the plan’s 
participants and beneficiaries. 
According fiduciary status to certain 
service providers that provide 
investment advice and valuation 
services to plans and their participants, 
and subjecting them to the full extent of 
remedies under ERISA, would 
discourage harmful conflicts and create

32 Please note that Department’s proposal also 
would benefit participants and beneficiaries of 
ERISA-covered plans, because section 502(a)(2) of 
ERISA allows them to assert a private right of action 
against plan fiduciaries who breach any of the 
responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed on 
fiduciaries under Title I of ERISA. 
more beneficial arrangements in the 
pension plan service provider market by 
deterring service providers from 
engaging in self-dealing, acting 
imprudently, and subordinating their 
plan clients’ interests to other interests 
due to the liability exposure and 
negative publicity that would result 
from being sued for a fiduciary breach 
under ERISA. 
b. Improved Service Value 
Under the proposal, certain service 
providers that are not fiduciaries under 
the Department’s current regulation 
would be determined to be fiduciaries 
under ERISA. Based on this change, the 
Department expects that affected service 
providers will modify their business 
practices to ensure that they act solely 
in the interests of their employee benefit 
plan clients and the plans’ participants 
and beneficiaries as required by section 
404 of ERISA. Therefore, plans should 
receive better value for the service fees 
they pay. Advisers are more likely to act 
in accordance with ERISA’s high 
fiduciary standards if they know that 
they may be held to them. Where a plan 
suffers a loss because of an investment 
adviser’s imprudence or actions 
contrary to the plan’s interests, the plan 
will have remedies under ERISA to 
recoup its losses and disgorge the 
adviser’s ill-gotten gains. This should 
provide the ancillary benefit of 
improved returns on plan assets and 
larger account balances for participants 
and beneficiaries of individual account 
plans. 
While the improvement in service 
value that may result from the proposed 
rule is difficult to quantify, the 
Department believes that it has the 
potential to be very large. If just 10 
percent of plans realize a one basis 
point (0.01 percent of plan assets) 
service value improvement, it would be 
worth approximately $399 million over 
ten years using a seven percent discount 
rate and reporting in 2010 dollars. In 
addition, GAO’s study linking 
undisclosed conflicts with 130 basis 
points of underperformance suggests 
that value can be improved via service 
quality as well as price.31 Viewed in this 
context, the Department is confident 
that service value improvement could 
be substantial as a result of the proposed 
rule and may be economically 
significant (i.e., exceed $100 million 
annually). 
c. Improve Department’s Ability To 
Redress Abuse and Improve 
Enforcement Resource Allocation 
Amending the Department’s current 
regulation by broadening the scope of 
service providers that would be 
considered fiduciaries would enhance 
the Department’s ability to redress 
service provider abuses that currently 
exist in the market, such as undisclosed 
fees, misrepresentation of compensation 
arrangements, and biased appraisals of 
the value of employer securities and 
other plan investments.32 It also would 
allow the Department to more 
effectively and efficiently allocate its 
enforcement resources, which would 
directly benefit plans and their 
participants and beneficiaries by 
providing greater protections than are 
available under the current regulation. 
Specifically, the proposed rule would 
improve the Department’s ability to 
redress abuse, provide additional 
protection to plans and their 
participants and beneficiaries, and 
allocate its enforcement resources by: 
• Including as fiduciary investment 
advice appraisals and fairness opinions 
concerning value of securities or other 
property; 
• According fiduciary status to 
persons who render investment advice 
for a fee to a plan, its participants or 
beneficiaries and directly or indirectly 
represent or acknowledge that they are 
acting as a fiduciary within the meaning 
of ERISA in rendering the advice; and 
• Expediting the resolution of 
difficult factual questions and 
enforcement challenges by removing the 
requirements in the current regulation’s 
five-part test that investment advice 
must be provided on a regular basis 
based on the parties’ mutual 
understanding and that the advice will 
serve as a primary basis for plan 
investment decisions. 
These benefits are discussed in more 
detail below. 
Appraisals and Valuation Opinions: 
As discussed earlier in this preamble, 
EBSA’s national ESOP enforcement 
project is focused on identifying and 
correcting violations of ERISA in 
connection with ESOPs, which are 
designed to invest primarily in 
employer securities. A common 
violation found in the ESOP national 
enforcement project arises in cases 
where plan fiduciaries have reasonably 
relied on faulty valuations of securities 
prepared by professional appraisers. 
The proposed rule, which would 
supersede AO 76–65A, and therefore 
would apply to appraisals and fairness 
opinions rendered in connection with 
plan investment transactions would 
align the duties of persons who provide 
appraisals with those of fiduciaries who 
rely on these appraisals. As noted 
above, the provision in the proposed 
rule is not limited to employer 
securities. 
Persons Holding Themselves Out as 
Fiduciaries: The proposed rule provides 
that a person is a fiduciary if it (1) 
renders investment advice described in 
the proposal to a plan, plan fiduciary, or 
plan participant or beneficiary for a fee 
or other compensation and (2) directly 
or indirectly represents or acknowledges 
that it is acting as a fiduciary within the 
meaning of ERISA with respect to the 
plan in rendering the advice. Many 
pension plans rely heavily on the expert 
guidance provided by consultants and 
other advisers in managing the 
investment of plan assets. The 
Department believes that claiming 
ERISA fiduciary status enhances the 
adviser’s influence, and gives the advice 
recipient a reasonable expectation that 
the advice will be impartial and 
prudent. Therefore, the proposed rule 
provides that such a representation or 
acknowledgment in connection with 
advice is sufficient to constitute 
investment advice under the proposal 
which, if rendered for a direct or 
indirect fee or other compensation, 
would result in fiduciary status under 
section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA. 
Simplifying Current Rule’s Five-Part 
Test: As stated earlier in this preamble, 
EBSA’s CAP project focuses on the 
receipt of improper, undisclosed 
compensation by pension consultants 
and other investment advisers, and 
whether the receipt of such 
compensation violates ERISA, because 
the adviser/consultant used its position 
with a benefit plan to generate 
additional fees for itself or its affiliates. 
One of the most substantial 
impediments confronting CAP 
investigators when bringing 
enforcement actions under the CAP 
program is proving that all elements of 
the current rule’s five-part test are met. 
As stated earlier, CAP investigators 
spend an inordinate amount of time 
gathering evidence to satisfy all 
elements of the five-part test rather than 
focusing on the misconduct involved in

65274 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 204 / Friday, October 22, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
33 Estimate based on the Department’s 
comparison of data reported on the 2005 and 2006 
Form 5500. 
requirement that advice must be 
provided on a ‘‘regular basis.’’ This 
condition bears no necessary 
relationship to the importance of the 
advice to the plan or the culpability of 
the adviser. The proposal also does not 
require the parties to have a mutual 
understanding that the advice will serve 
as a ‘‘primary basis’’ for plan investment 
decisions. This should allow EBSA to 
more efficiently allocate its enforcement 
resources, because investigators no 
longer would need to devote 
disproportionate time to prove that 
these elements of the five-part test are 
met. 
6. Costs 
The Department estimated the costs 
for the proposal over the ten-year time 
frame for purposes of this analysis and 
used information from the quantitative 
characterization of the service provider 
market presented above as a basis for 
these cost estimates. This 
characterization did not account for all 
service providers, but it does provide 
information on the segments of the 
service provider industry that are likely 
to be most affected by the proposal (i.e., 
those who provide investment- and 
valuation-related services to employee 
benefit plans). 
Most of the cost of the rule would be 
imposed on affected plan service 
providers. These service providers 
would need to review the proposed rule 
and determine whether their current 
service provider contracts and 
arrangements with plans, or activities 
carried out pursuant to them, would 
make them fiduciaries under the 
proposal. 
For purposes of this analysis, the 
Department assumes that all affected 
service providers will incur these initial 
compliance review costs. The 
Department believes that service 
providers will need to review their 
entire book of business, not each 
individual transaction or a plan-by-plan 
review, to determine whether they are 
fiduciaries, because service providers 
will enter into agreements with plans to 
provide similar types of services. The 
Department assumes that affected 
service providers will require on 
average 16 hours of legal professional 
time at a cost of approximately $119 per 
hour to perform the compliance review. 
Based on the foregoing, this cost is 
estimated to be approximately $10.1 
million in the first year. 
The Department also has estimated 
the initial compliance review and 
implementation costs for service 
providers newly entering the market 
(‘‘new service providers’’) to provide 
services to plans (either for the first time 
or by re-entry) beginning in 2012 and 
each year thereafter. The Department 
assumes that about eight percent of all 
service providers will be new in each 
year subsequent to 2011,33 and that 
these service providers will incur the 
same compliance review and 
implementation costs as existing service 
providers. Based on the foregoing, the 
Department estimates that new service 
providers will incur costs of 
approximately $845,000 in 2012 and 
thereafter. Estimates of the cost of the 
rule over the first ten years are reported 
in Table 2, below. 
The Department’s estimate regarding 
the time required for service providers 
to complete the compliance review to 
determine whether they are fiduciaries 
under the proposal as a result of 
providing investment advice to a plan or 
a plan participant or beneficiary is 
based on an average cost for large and 
small service providers to conduct the 
review. In developing this estimate, the 
Department has accounted for the fact 
that large service providers may require 
more time than small service providers 
to complete the compliance review due 
to the wide range of services they 
provide and the complexity of their 
business arrangements and affiliate 
relationships. The Department believes 
that the burden for service providers to 
complete the compliance review is 
mitigated by the fact that the proposal 
sets forth discrete types of advice and 
recommendations that constitute 
investment advice for purposes of 
ERISA section 3(21)(A)(ii). The 
Department welcomes public comments 
regarding this estimate.

7. Regulatory Alternatives 
As discussed elsewhere in the 
preamble to the proposal, plan service 
providers that fall within the 
Department’s rule might experience 
increased costs and liability exposure 
associated with ERISA fiduciary status. 
Consequently, these service providers 
might charge higher fees to plan clients, 
or limit or discontinue the availability 
of their services or products to ERISA 
plans. As further discussed below, the 
Department considered but rejected two 
regulatory alternatives, because these 
alternatives could lead to higher fees for 
plans and a compression of the plan 
service provider market.

65275 Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 204 / Friday, October 22, 2010 / Proposed Rules 
In developing this proposal, the 
Department sought to broaden the scope 
of the persons treated as ERISA 
fiduciaries, without creating an overly- 
broad or ambiguous standard that might 
unnecessarily disadvantage plans. As an 
alternative, the Department considered a 
proposal that would replace the current 
regulatory definition with the language 
of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA, which 
provides simply that a person is a 
fiduciary if it renders investment advice 
for a fee or other compensation, direct 
or indirect, with respect to any moneys 
or other property of a plan, or has any 
authority or responsibility to do so. 
However, the Department believes this 
approach would not provide sufficient 
clarity for persons to determine whether 
they are ERISA fiduciaries. Without a 
sufficiently clear standard, a broad 
range of plan service providers, in order 
to mitigate or avoid any potential risks, 
might simply presume fiduciary status 
and charge higher fees to plan clients, 
or limit or discontinue the availability 
of their services or products to ERISA 
plans. The Department rejected this 
alternative. The Department’s proposal 
attempts to identify fiduciaries based on 
readily-ascertainable criteria related to 
their degree of authority, control, 
responsibility or influence and the 
expectations of the parties involved. 
The Department considered another 
alternative that would not have 
included in the proposal an explicit 
limitation applicable to service 
providers that offer of a ‘‘platform’’ of 
investment options. Defined 
contribution plans that permit 
participants to direct the investment of 
assets allocated to their accounts have 
become increasingly popular. Often, the 
service provider offering a platform, as 
an incidental part of its overall services, 
also provides the plan sponsor with 
general information and assistance in 
assessing the investments available for 
inclusion in the plan’s platform. The 
Department rejected this alternative, 
because if the proposal does not provide 
sufficient clarity as to whether their 
activities related to offering an 
investment platform would result in 
fiduciary status, these service providers 
might increase their fees, limit the types 
of investment-related information made 
available to plan sponsors, or cease 
offering their services to plans. In order 
to provide clarity, the Department’s 
proposal attempts to describe the 
circumstances under which merely 
offering a platform of investment 
options, and certain incidental services, 
will not cause a person to become an 
ERISA fiduciary. 
8. Uncertainty 
The Department’s estimates of the 
effects of this proposed rule are subject 
to uncertainty. The Department is 
confident that adopting a new definition 
of the term ‘‘fiduciary’’ should 
discourage harmful conflicts of interest, 
improve service value, and enhance the 
Department’s ability to redress abuses 
and more effectively and efficiently 
allocate its enforcement resources. 
However, it is uncertain about the 
magnitude of these benefits and 
potential costs. It is possible this rule 
could have a large market impact. 
For example, the Department is 
uncertain regarding whether, and to 
what extent, service provider costs 
would increase due to the proposed 
rule, and if so, whether the increased 
cost would be passed on to plans. The 
Department expects that more service 
providers would be determined to be 
fiduciaries under the proposed rule than 
under the current regulation. These 
service providers could experience 
higher costs of doing business due to the 
increased liability exposure that is 
associated with ERISA fiduciary status, 
such as fiduciary liability insurance 
costs, which could result in higher fees 
for their plan clients. The Department 
also is uncertain whether the service 
provider market will shrink because 
some service providers would view the 
increased costs and liability exposure 
associated with ERISA fiduciary status 
as outweighing the benefit of continuing 
to service the ERISA plan market. The 
Department does not have enough 
information to provide a specific 
number. However, it is possible that 
many plans currently employ service 
providers who would be considered 
fiduciaries for the first time under the 
proposal. 
Also, if more service providers are 
fiduciaries, more transactions would 
violate the self-dealing prohibitions 
contained in ERISA section 406(b). In 
order to avoid committing prohibited 
transactions, affected service providers 
would have to identify transactions that 
would be prohibited because they 
involve self-dealing, restructure these 
transactions, and modify their business 
practices in the absence of an applicable 
statutory, class, or individual prohibited 
transaction exemption. The Department 
is uncertain regarding the number of 
transactions that would have to be 
restructured, whether an applicable 
prohibited transaction exemption would 
be available for such transactions, and if 
not, the number of prohibited 
transactions exemption applications the 
Department could expect to receive 
regarding the transactions. The 
Department welcomes public comments 
regarding this issue. 
The Department believes its 
assumptions are reasonable based on the 
available information and tentatively 
concludes that the proposed regulation’s 
benefits would justify its costs. The 
Department invites comments that will 
help it assess the impact of areas where 
it is uncertain. 
9. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes 
certain requirements with respect to 
Federal rules that are subject to the 
notice and comment requirements of 
section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and 
which are likely to have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. Unless an 
agency determines that a proposal is not 
likely to have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities, section 603 of the RFA requires 
the agency to present an initial 
regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) of 
the proposed rule. The Department’s 
IRFA of the proposed rule is provided 
below. 
a. Need for and Objectives of the Rule 
The Department has determined that 
regulatory action is necessary to adopt 
a definition of the term ‘‘fiduciary’’ that 
more closely reflects the broad statutory 
definition of the term, recognizes the 
diverse and complex fee practices that 
exist in today’s plan service provider 
market and their potential conflicts, 
accounts for the shift from DB to DC 
plans, expands the scope of fiduciary 
protections for plans and their 
participants and beneficiaries, and 
permits EBSA investigators and 
attorneys to focus their efforts on the 
adviser’s conduct rather than meeting 
the evidentiary requirements necessary 
to prove that all elements of the current 
regulation’s five-part test are satisfied. 
As discussed in further detail in the 
regulatory impact analysis above, the 
Department believes that amending the 
current regulation by broadening the 
scope of service providers, regardless of 
size, that would be considered 
fiduciaries would enhance the 
Department’s ability to redress service 
provider abuses that currently exist in 
the plan service provider market, such 
as undisclosed fees, misrepresentation 
of compensation arrangements, and 
biased appraisals of the value of 
employer securities and other plan 
investments.

b. Affected Small Entities 
The Department is unable to estimate 
the number of small service providers 
that would be affected by the proposal. 
These service providers generally 
consist of professional service 
enterprises that provide a wide range of 
services to plans, such as investment 
management or advisory services for 
plans or plan participants, and 
appraisal, consulting, brokerage, 
pension insurance advisory services, 
investment evaluations, or valuation 
services. Many of these service 
providers have special education, 
training, and/or formal credentials in 
fields such as ERISA and benefits 
administration, employee 
compensation, taxation, actuarial 
science, or finance. 
The Small Business Administration 
considers service providers with annual 
revenues of less than $7 million to be 
small entities. Using data from Schedule 
C of the Department’s 2007 Form 5500, 
which generally is used by plans with 
over 100 participants to report service 
providers that rendered services to or 
had transactions with the plan and 
received $5,000 or more in total direct 
or indirect compensation, the 
Department estimates that about 130 of 
the 5,300 affected service providers 
have total revenues reported on the 
Schedule C of over $7 million. Based on 
the foregoing, there would be 5,170 
service providers with revenues of less 
than $7 million; however, this estimate 
overstates the total number of small 
entities that would be affected by the 
proposal, because it does not include 
revenues from the nearly 626,000 small 
plans that are not required to file the 
Schedule C and revenues from other 
sources. 
c. Impact of the Proposal 
Small entities that are determined to 
be fiduciaries under the Department’s 
proposal will be required to act solely 
in the interest of their plan clients and 
participants and beneficiaries in 
connection with covered services. The 
Department believes that amending the 
current regulation to reflect additional 
circumstances where an investment 
advice provider is in a position of 
authority, control, responsibility, or 
influence with respect to a plan and its 
investment decisions is a critical 
component of protecting the interest of 
plans and the retirement income 
security of participants and 
beneficiaries. 
The Department also is unable to 
estimate the increased business costs 
small entities would incur if they were 
determined to be fiduciaries under the 
proposal. Such costs would include the 
expense of purchasing fiduciary liability 
insurance due to the increased liability 
exposure that is associated with ERISA 
fiduciary status. The Department 
estimates that, on average, affected 
service providers would incur a cost of 
$1,900 to determine whether a service 
provider’s contracts and arrangement 
with plans, or activities carried out 
pursuant to them, would make the 
service provider a fiduciary under the 
proposed rule. 
It is possible that some small service 
providers may find that the increased 
costs associated with ERISA fiduciary 
status outweigh the benefit of 
continuing to service the ERISA plan 
market; however, the Department does 
not have sufficient information to 
determine the extent to which this will 
occur. It is possible that the economic 
impact of the rule on small entities 
would not be as significant as it would 
be for large entities, because generally, 
small entities do not have as many 
business arrangements that give rise to 
conflicts of interest. Therefore, they 
would not be confronted with 
significant costs to restructure 
transactions that would be faced by 
large entities. 
The Department invites comments 
regarding all aspects of this IRFA. 
10. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The proposed rule is not subject to the 
requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA 95) (44 
U.S.C. section 3501 et seq.), because it 
does not contain a collection of 
information as defined in 44 U.S.C. 
section 3502(3). 
11. Congressional Review Act 
The proposed rule is subject to the 
Congressional Review Act provisions of 
the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 
U.S.C. 801 et seq.) and, if finalized, will 
be transmitted to Congress and the 
Comptroller General for review. The 
proposed rule is a ‘‘major rule’’ as that 
term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 804, because 
it is likely to result in an annual effect 
on the economy of $100 million or 
more. 
12. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
For purposes of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4), as well as Executive Order 
12875, the proposed rule does not 
include any Federal mandate that may 
result in expenditures by State, local, or 
Tribal governments in the aggregate of 
more than $100 million, adjusted for 
inflation, or increase expenditures by 
the private sector of more than $100 
million, adjusted for inflation. 
13. Federalism Statement 
Executive Order 13132 (August 4, 
1999) outlines fundamental principles 
of federalism, and requires the 
adherence to specific criteria by Federal 
agencies in the process of their 
formulation and implementation of 
policies that have substantial direct 
effects on the States, the relationship 
between the national government and 
States, or on the distribution of power 
and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. This proposed 
rule does not have federalism 
implications, because it has no 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Section 514 of 
ERISA provides, with certain exceptions 
specifically enumerated, that the 
provisions of Titles I and IV of ERISA 
supersede any and all laws of the States 
as they relate to any employee benefit 
plan covered under ERISA. The 
requirements implemented in the 
proposed rule have no implications for 
the States or the relationship or 
distribution of power between the 
national government and the States. 
Statutory Authority 
This regulation is proposed pursuant 
to the authority in section 505 of ERISA 
(Pub. L. 93–406, 88 Stat. 894; 29 U.S.C.

Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713,

for purposes of compliance with the 
reporting and disclosure requirements 
of the Act, the Internal Revenue Code, 
and the regulations, forms and 
schedules issued thereunder, unless 
such report involves assets for which 
there is not a generally recognized 
market and serves as a basis on which 
a plan may make distributions to plan 
participants and beneficiaries. 
(3) Fee or other compensation. For 
purposes of this paragraph (c) and 
section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Act, a fee or 
other compensation, direct or indirect, 
received by a person for rendering 
investment advice means any fee or 
compensation for the advice received by 
the person (or by an affiliate) from any 
source and any fee or compensation 
incident to the transaction in which the 
investment advice has been rendered or 
will be rendered. The term fee or 
compensation includes, for example, 
brokerage, mutual fund sales, and 
insurance sales commissions. It 
includes fees and commissions based on 
multiple transactions involving different 
parties. 
(4) Internal Revenue Code. Section 
4975(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 (Code) contains provisions 
parallel to section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Act 
which define the term ‘‘fiduciary’’ for 
purposes of the prohibited transaction 
provisions in Code section 4975. 
Effective December 31, 1978, section

the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall 
apply for purposes of the application of 
Code section 4975 with respect to any 
plan described in Code section 
4975(e)(1). 
(5) A person who is a fiduciary with 
respect to a plan by reason of rendering 
investment advice (as defined in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section) for a fee 
or other compensation, direct or 
indirect, with respect to any moneys or 
other property of such plan, or having 
any authority or responsibility to do so, 
shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary 
regarding any assets of the plan with 
respect to which such person does not 
have any discretionary authority, 
discretionary control or discretionary 
responsibility, does not exercise any 
authority or control, does not render 
investment advice (as defined in

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. 
David Olson, Headquarters, Operations 
and Regulatory Community of Practice, 
Washington, DC at 202–761–4922 or 
Richard K. Spencer, U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, Wilmington District, at 910– 
251–4172. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant 
to its authorities in Section 7 of the 
Rivers and Harbors Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 
266; 33 U.S.C. 1) and Chapter XIX of the 
Army Appropriations Act of 1919 (40 
Stat. 892; 33 U.S.C. 3), the Corps 
proposes to amend the regulations in 
33 CFR part 334 by adding § 334.420 
(b)(1)(v) to establish an Intermittent 
Danger Zone abutting the existing 1.8 
mile Danger Zone [as described in 
§ 334.420(b)(1)(i)] in the Pamlico Sound 
and adjacent waters in Carteret County, 
North Carolina. The public is currently 
restricted from accessing the existing 1.8 
mile radius circular area and has limited 
access to three additional 0.5 mile 
radius circular danger zones described 
at §§ 334.420(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv), but 
has unrestricted access to the 
surrounding waters. To better protect 
the public from potentially hazardous 
conditions during scheduled live fire 
training, Marine Corps Air Station 
Cherry Point has requested that the 
Corps establish the Intermittent Danger 
Zone that will enable the Marine Corps 
to ensure security and safety for the 
public. 
The current military training mission 
requires enhanced public safety and 
protection of vessels that operate in the 
vicinity of the Bombing Target-11 range. 
This proposed amendment to the 
current danger zone regulation at 33 
CFR 334.420 includes the addition of a 
danger zone in Pamlico Sound that 
abuts the existing 1.8 mile radius danger 
zone and extends out to 2.5 miles from 
the common center point. Establishment 
of this additional danger zone will allow 
the Marine Corps to minimize the 
public safety hazard resulting from the 
increased use of .50 caliber weapons 
firing from rotary-wing aircraft and 
small boats during training exercises at 
Bombing Target-11 Range. The new 
danger zone will optimize public safety 
and military training, and protect any 
vessels that operate in the vicinity of 
Bombing Target-11 Range. 
Procedural Requirements 
a. Review Under Executive Order 
12866. This proposed rule is issued 
with respect to a military function of the 
Defense Department and the provisions 
of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. 
b. Review Under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. This proposed rule has 
been reviewed under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96–354) which 
requires the preparation of a regulatory 
flexibility analysis for any regulation 
that will have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities (i.e., small businesses and small 
governments). The Corps has 
determined that revising this proposed 
rule would have practically no 
economic impact on the public, or result 
in no anticipated navigational hazard or 
interference with existing waterway 
traffic. This proposed rule will have no 
significant economic impact on small 
entities. 
c. Review Under the National 
Environmental Policy Act. The Corps 
expects that the proposed rule will not 
have a significant impact to the quality 
of the human environment and,
