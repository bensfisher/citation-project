Proposed Rulemaking To Establish 
Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas 
Emission Standards and Corporate 
Average Fuel Economy Standards 
AGENCY: Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: EPA and NHTSA are issuing 
this joint proposal to establish a 
National Program consisting of new 
standards for light-duty vehicles that 
will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
and improve fuel economy. This joint 
proposed rulemaking is consistent with 
the National Fuel Efficiency Policy 
announced by President Obama on May 
19, 2009, responding to the country’s 
critical need to address global climate 
change and to reduce oil consumption. 
EPA is proposing greenhouse gas 
emissions standards under the Clean Air 
Act, and NHTSA is proposing Corporate 
Average Fuel Economy standards under 
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, 
as amended. These standards apply to 
passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and 
medium-duty passenger vehicles, 
covering model years 2012 through 
2016, and represent a harmonized and 
consistent National Program. Under the 
National Program, automobile 
manufacturers would be able to build a 
single light-duty national fleet that 
satisfies all requirements under both 
programs while ensuring that 
consumers still have a full range of 
vehicle choices.

B. Public Participation 
NHTSA and EPA request comment on 
all aspects of this joint proposed rule. 
This section describes how you can 
participate in this process. 
How Do I Prepare and Submit 
Comments? 
In this joint proposal, there are many 
issues common to both EPA’s and 
NHTSA’s proposals. For the 
convenience of all parties, comments 
submitted to the EPA docket will be 
considered comments submitted to the 
NHTSA docket, and vice versa. An 
exception is that comments submitted to 
the NHTSA docket on the Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement will 
not be considered submitted to the EPA 
docket. Therefore, the public only needs 
to submit comments to either one of the 
two agency dockets. Comments that are 
submitted for consideration by one 
agency should be identified as such, and 
comments that are submitted for 
consideration by both agencies should 
be identified as such. Absent such 
identification, each agency will exercise 
its best judgment to determine whether 
a comment is submitted on its proposal. 
Further instructions for submitting 
comments to either the EPA or NHTSA 
docket are described below. 
EPA: Direct your comments to Docket 
ID No EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472. EPA’s 
policy is that all comments received 
will be included in the public docket 
without change and may be made 
available online at www.regulations.gov, 
including any personal information 
provided, unless the comment includes 
information claimed to be Confidential 
Business Information (CBI) or other 
information whose disclosure is 
restricted by statute. Do not submit 
information that you consider to be CBI 
or otherwise protected through 
www.regulations.gov or e-mail. The 
www.regulations.gov Web site is an 
‘‘anonymous access’’ system, which 
means EPA will not know your identity 
or contact information unless you 
provide it in the body of your comment. 
If you send an e-mail comment directly 
to EPA without going through 
www.regulations.gov your e-mail 
address will be automatically captured 
and included as part of the comment 
that is placed in the public docket and 
made available on the Internet. If you 
submit an electronic comment, EPA 
recommends that you include your 
name and other contact information in 
the body of your comment and with any 
disk or CD–ROM you submit. If EPA 
cannot read your comment due to 
technical difficulties and cannot contact 
you for clarification, EPA may not be 
able to consider your comment. 
Electronic files should avoid the use of 
special characters, any form of 
encryption, and be free of any defects or 
viruses. For additional information 
about EPA’s public docket visit the EPA 
Docket Center homepage at http:// 
www.epa.gov/epahome/dockets.htm. 
NHTSA: Your comments must be 
written and in English. To ensure that 
your comments are correctly filed in the 
Docket, please include the Docket 
number NHTSA–2009–0059 in your 
comments. Your comments must not be 
more than 15 pages long.3 NHTSA 
established this limit to encourage you 
to write your primary comments in a 
concise fashion. However, you may 
attach necessary additional documents 
to your comments. There is no limit on 
the length of the attachments. If you are 
submitting comments electronically as a 
PDF (Adobe) file, we ask that the 
documents submitted be scanned using 
the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
process, thus allowing the agencies to 
search and copy certain portions of your 
submissions.4 Please note that pursuant 
to the Data Quality Act, in order for the 
substantive data to be relied upon and 
used by the agencies, it must meet the 
information quality standards set forth 
in the OMB and Department of 
Transportation (DOT) Data Quality Act 
guidelines. Accordingly, we encourage 
you to consult the guidelines in 
preparing your comments. OMB’s 
guidelines may be accessed at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/
reproducible.html. DOT’s guidelines 
may be accessed at http://www.dot.gov/ 
dataquality.htm. 
Tips for Preparing Your Comments 
When submitting comments, 
remember to: 
• Identify the rulemaking by docket 
number and other identifying 
information (subject heading, Federal 
Register date and page number). 
• Follow directions—The agency may 
ask you to respond to specific questions 
or organize comments by referencing a 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 
or section number. 
• Explain why you agree or disagree, 
suggest alternatives, and substitute 
language for your requested changes. 
• Describe any assumptions and 
provide any technical information and/ 
or data that you used. 
• If you estimate potential costs or 
burdens, explain how you arrived at 
your estimate in sufficient detail to 
allow for it to be reproduced. 
• Provide specific examples to 
illustrate your concerns, and suggest 
alternatives.

• Explain your views as clearly as 
possible, avoiding the use of profanity 
or personal threats. 
Make sure to submit your comments 
by the comment period deadline 
identified in the DATES section above. 
How Can I Be Sure That My Comments 
Were Received? 
NHTSA: If you submit your comments 
by mail and wish Docket Management 
to notify you upon its receipt of your 
comments, enclose a self-addressed, 
stamped postcard in the envelope 
containing your comments. Upon 
receiving your comments, Docket 
Management will return the postcard by 
mail. 
How Do I Submit Confidential Business 
Information? 
Any confidential business 
information (CBI) submitted to one of 
the agencies will also be available to the 
other agency. However, as with all 
public comments, any CBI information 
only needs to be submitted to either one 
of the agencies’ dockets and it will be 
available to the other. Following are 
specific instructions for submitting CBI 
to either agency. 
EPA: Do not submit CBI to EPA 
through http://www.regulations.gov or 
e-mail. Clearly mark the part or all of 
the information that you claim to be 
CBI. For CBI information in a disk or 
CD–ROM that you mail to EPA, mark 
the outside of the disk or CD–ROM as 
CBI and then identify electronically 
within the disk or CD–ROM the specific 
information that is claimed as CBI. In 
addition to one complete version of the 
comment that includes information 
claimed as CBI, a copy of the comment 
that does not contain the information 
claimed as CBI must be submitted for 
inclusion in the public docket. 
Information so marked will not be 
disclosed except in accordance with 
procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. 
NHTSA: If you wish to submit any 
information under a claim of 
confidentiality, you should submit three 
copies of your complete submission, 
including the information you claim to 
be confidential business information, to 
the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the 
address given above under FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACT. When you send a 
comment containing confidential 
business information, you should 
include a cover letter setting forth the 
information specified in our 
confidential business information 
regulation.5 
In addition, you should submit a copy 
from which you have deleted the 
claimed confidential business 
information to the Docket by one of the 
methods set forth above. 
Will the Agencies Consider Late 
Comments? 
NHTSA and EPA will consider all 
comments received before the close of 
business on the comment closing date 
indicated above under DATES. To the 
extent practicable, we will also consider 
comments received after that date. If 
interested persons believe that any new 
information the agency places in the 
docket affects their comments, they may 
submit comments after the closing date 
concerning how the agency should 
consider that information for the final 
rule. However, the agencies’ ability to 
consider any such late comments in this 
rulemaking will be limited due to the 
time frame for issuing a final rule. 
If a comment is received too late for 
us to practicably consider in developing 
a final rule, we will consider that 
comment as an informal suggestion for 
future rulemaking action. 
How Can I Read the Comments 
Submitted by Other People? 
You may read the materials placed in 
the docket for this document (e.g., the 
comments submitted in response to this 
document by other interested persons) 
at any time by going to http:// 
www.regulations.gov. Follow the online 
instructions for accessing the dockets. 
You may also read the materials at the 
EPA Docket Center or NHTSA Docket 
Management Facility by going to the 
street addresses given above under 
ADDRESSES. 
How Do I Participate in the Public 
Hearings? 
NHTSA and EPA will jointly host 
three public hearings on the dates and 
locations described in the DATES and 
ADDRESSES sections above. 
If you would like to present testimony 
at the public hearings, we ask that you 
notify the EPA and NHTSA contact 
persons listed under FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACT at least ten days 
before the hearing. Once EPA and 
NHTSA learn how many people have 
registered to speak at the public hearing, 
we will allocate an appropriate amount 
of time to each participant, allowing 
time for lunch and necessary breaks 
throughout the day. For planning 
purposes, each speaker should 
anticipate speaking for approximately 
ten minutes, although we may need to 
adjust the time for each speaker if there 
is a large turnout. We suggest that you 
bring copies of your statement or other 
material for the EPA and NHTSA panels 
and the audience. It would also be 
helpful if you send us a copy of your 
statement or other materials before the 
hearing. To accommodate as many 
speakers as possible, we prefer that 
speakers not use technological aids (e.g., 
audio-visuals, computer slideshows). 
However, if you plan to do so, you must 
notify the contact persons in the FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section 
above. You also must make 
arrangements to provide your 
presentation or any other aids to 
NHTSA and EPA in advance of the 
hearing in order to facilitate set-up. In 
addition, we will reserve a block of time 
for anyone else in the audience who 
wants to give testimony. 
The hearing will be held at a site 
accessible to individuals with 
disabilities. Individuals who require 
accommodations such as sign language 
interpreters should contact the persons 
listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT section above no later than ten 
days before the date of the hearing. 
NHTSA and EPA will conduct the 
hearing informally, and technical rules 
of evidence will not apply. We will 
arrange for a written transcript of the 
hearing and keep the official record of 
the hearing open for 30 days to allow 
you to submit supplementary 
information. You may make 
arrangements for copies of the transcript 
directly with the court reporter.

I. Overview of Joint EPA/NHTSA 
National Program 
A. Introduction 
The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) and the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
are each announcing proposed rules 
whose benefits would address the 
urgent and closely intertwined 
challenges of energy independence and 
security and global warming. These 
proposed rules call for a strong and 
coordinated Federal greenhouse gas and 
fuel economy program for passenger 
cars, light-duty-trucks, and medium- 
duty passenger vehicles (hereafter light- 
duty vehicles), referred to as the 
National Program. The proposed rules 
can achieve substantial reductions of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
improvements in fuel economy from the 
light-duty vehicle part of the 
transportation sector, based on 
technology that is already being 
commercially applied in most cases and 
that can be incorporated at a reasonable 
cost. 
This joint notice is consistent with the 
President’s announcement on May 19, 
2009 of a National Fuel Efficiency 
Policy of establishing consistent, 
harmonized, and streamlined 
requirements that would reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and improve 
fuel economy for all new cars and light- 
duty trucks sold in the United States.6 
The National Program holds out the 
promise of delivering additional 
environmental and energy benefits, cost 
savings, and administrative efficiencies 
on a nationwide basis that might not be 
available under a less coordinated 
approach. The proposed National 
Program also offers the prospect of 
regulatory convergence by making it 
possible for the standards of two 
different Federal agencies and the 
standards of California and other States 
to act in a unified fashion in providing 
these benefits. This would allow 
automakers to produce and sell a single 
fleet nationally. Thus, it may also help 
to mitigate the additional costs that 
manufacturers would otherwise face in 
having to comply with multiple sets of 
Federal and State standards. This joint 
notice is also consistent with the Notice 
of Upcoming Joint Rulemaking issued 
by DOT and EPA on May 19 7 and 
responds to the President’s January 26, 
2009 memorandum on CAFE standards 
for model years 2011 and beyond,8 the 
details of which can be found in Section 
IV of this joint notice. 
1. Building Blocks of the National 
Program 
The National Program is both needed 
and possible because the relationship 
between improving fuel economy and 
reducing CO2 tailpipe emissions is a 
very direct and close one. The amount 
of those CO2 emissions is essentially 
constant per gallon combusted of a 
given type of fuel. Thus, the more fuel 
efficient a vehicle is, the less fuel it 
burns to travel a given distance. The less 
fuel it burns, the less CO2 it emits in 
traveling that distance.9 While there are 
emission control technologies that 
reduce the pollutants (e.g., carbon 
monoxide) produced by imperfect 
combustion of fuel by capturing or 
destroying them, there is no such 
technology for CO2. Further, while some 
of those pollutants can also be reduced 
by achieving a more complete 
combustion of fuel, doing so only 
increases the tailpipe emissions of CO2. 
Thus, there is a single pool of 
technologies for addressing these twin 
problems, i.e., those that reduce fuel 
consumption and thereby reduce CO2 
emissions as well. 
a. DOT’s CAFE Program 
In 1975, Congress enacted the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), 
mandating that NHTSA establish and 
implement a regulatory program for 
motor vehicle fuel economy to meet the 
various facets of the need to conserve 
energy, including ones having energy 
independence and security, 
environmental and foreign policy 
implications. Fuel economy gains since 
1975, due both to the standards and 
market factors, have resulted in saving 
billions of barrels of oil and avoiding 
billions of metric tons of CO2 emissions. 
In December 2007, Congress enacted the 
Energy Independence and Securities Act 
(EISA), amending EPCA to require 
substantial, continuing increases in fuel 
economy standards. 
The CAFE standards address most, 
but not all, of the real world CO2 
emissions because EPCA requires the 
use of 1975 passenger car test 
procedures under which vehicle air 
conditioners are not turned on during 
fuel economy testing.10 Fuel economy is 
determined by measuring the amount of 
CO2 and other carbon compounds 
emitted from the tailpipe, not by 
attempting to measure directly the 
amount of fuel consumed during a 
vehicle test, a difficult task to 
accomplish with precision. The carbon 
content of the test fuel 11 is then used to 
calculate the amount of fuel that had to 
be consumed per mile in order to

findings, and subsequent actions undertaken by the

in response to the Supreme Court remand.

produce that amount of CO2. Finally, 
that fuel consumption figure is 
converted into a miles-per-gallon figure. 
CAFE standards also do not address the 
5–8 percent of GHG emissions that are 
not CO2, i.e., nitrous oxide (N2O), and 
methane (CH4) as well as emissions of 
CO2 and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
related to operation of the air 
conditioning system. 
b. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Standards for 
Light-Duty Vehicles 
Under the Clean Air Act EPA is 
responsible for addressing air pollutants 
from motor vehicles. On April 2, 2007, 
the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 
opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA,12 a 
case involving a 2003 order of the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
denying a petition for rulemaking to 
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from 
motor vehicles under section 202(a) of 
the Clean Air Act (CAA).13 The Court 
held that greenhouse gases were air 
pollutants for purposes of the Clean Air 
Act and further held that the 
Administrator must determine whether 
or not emissions from new motor 
vehicles cause or contribute to air 
pollution which may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger public health or 
welfare, or whether the science is too 
uncertain to make a reasoned decision. 
The Court further ruled that, in making 
these decisions, the EPA Administrator 
is required to follow the language of 
section 202(a) of the CAA. The Court 
rejected the argument that EPA cannot 
regulate CO2 from motor vehicles 
because to do so would de facto tighten 
fuel economy standards, authority over 
which has been assigned by Congress to 
DOT. The Court stated that ‘‘[b]ut that 
DOT sets mileage standards in no way 
licenses EPA to shirk its environmental 
responsibilities. EPA has been charged 
with protecting the public‘s ‘health’ and 
‘welfare’, a statutory obligation wholly 
independent of DOT’s mandate to 
promote energy efficiency.’’ The Court 
concluded that ‘‘[t]he two obligations 
may overlap, but there is no reason to 
think the two agencies cannot both 
administer their obligations and yet 
avoid inconsistency.’’ 14 The Court 
remanded the case back to the Agency 
for reconsideration in light of its 
findings.15 
EPA has since proposed to find that 
emissions of GHGs from new motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engines 
cause or contribute to air pollution that 
may reasonably be anticipated to 
endanger public health and welfare.16 
This proposal represents the second 
phase of EPA’s response to the Supreme 
Court’s decision. 
c. California Air Resources Board 
Greenhouse Gas Program 
In 2004, the California Air Resources 
Board approved standards for new light- 
duty vehicles, which regulate the 
emission of not only CO2, but also other 
GHGs. Since then, thirteen States and 
the District of Columbia, comprising 
approximately 40 percent of the light- 
duty vehicle market, have adopted 
California’s standards. These standards 
apply to model years 2009 through 2016 
and require CO2 emissions for passenger 
cars and the smallest light trucks of 323 
g/mi in 2009 and 205 g/mi in 2016, and 
for the remaining light trucks of 439 g/ 
mi in 2009 and 332 g/mi in 2016. On 
June 30, 2009, EPA granted California’s 
request for a waiver of preemption 
under the CAA.17 The granting of the 
waiver permits California and the other 
States to proceed with implementing the 
California emission standards. 
2. Joint Proposal for a National Program 
On May 19, 2009, the Department of 
Transportation and the Environmental 
Protection Agency issued a Notice of 
Upcoming Joint Rulemaking to propose 
a strong and coordinated fuel economy 
and greenhouse gas National Program 
for Model Year (MY) 2012–2016 light 
duty vehicles. 
B. Summary of the Joint Proposal 
In this joint rulemaking, EPA is 
proposing GHG emissions standards 
under the Clean Air Act (CAA), and 
NHTSA is proposing Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards under 
the Energy Policy and Conservation 
Action of 1975 (EPCA), as amended by 
the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007 (EISA). The intention of this 
joint rulemaking proposal is to set forth 
a carefully coordinated and harmonized 
approach to implementing these two 
statutes, in accordance with all 
substantive and procedural 
requirements imposed by law. 
Climate change is widely viewed as 
the most significant long-term threat to 
the global environment. According to 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, anthropogenic emissions of 
greenhouse gases are very likely (90 to 
99 percent probability) the cause of 
most of the observed global warming 
over the last 50 years. The primary 
GHGs of concern are carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, 
and sulfur hexafluoride. Mobile sources 
emitted 31.5 percent of all U.S. GHG in 
2006, and have been the fastest-growing 
source of U.S. GHG since 1990. Light- 
duty vehicles emit four GHGs—CO2, 
methane, nitrous oxide, and 
hydrofluorocarbons—and are 
responsible for nearly 60 percent of all 
mobile source GHGs. For Light-duty 
vehicles, CO2 emissions represent about 
95 percent of all greenhouse emissions, 
and the CO2 emissions measured over 
the EPA tests used for fuel economy 
compliance represent over 90 percent of 
total light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Improving energy security by 
reducing our dependence on foreign oil 
has been a national objective since the 
first oil price shocks in the 1970s. Net 
petroleum imports now account for 
approximately 60 percent of U.S. 
petroleum consumption. World crude 
oil production is highly concentrated, 
exacerbating the risks of supply 
disruptions and price shocks. Tight 
global oil markets led to prices over 
$100 per barrel in 2008, with gasoline 
reaching as high as $4 per gallon in 
many parts of the U.S., causing financial 
hardship for many families. The export 
of U.S. assets for oil imports continues 
to be an important component of the 
U.S.’ historically unprecedented trade 
deficits. Transportation accounts for 
about two-thirds of U.S. petroleum 
consumption. Light-duty vehicles 
account for about 60 percent of 
transportation oil use, which means that 
they alone account for about 40 percent 
of all U.S. oil consumption. 
NHTSA and EPA have coordinated 
closely and worked jointly in 
developing their respective proposals. 
This is reflected in many aspects of this 
joint proposal. For example, the 
agencies have developed a 
comprehensive joint Technical Support 
Document (TSD) that provides a solid 
technical underpinning for each 
agency’s modeling and analysis used to 
support their proposed standards. Also, 
to the extent allowed by law, the 
agencies have harmonized many 
elements of program design, such as the 
form of the standard (the footprint-based 
attribute curves), and the definitions 
used for cars and trucks. They have 
developed the same or similar 
compliance flexibilities, to the extent 
allowed and appropriate under their

respective statutes, such as averaging, 
banking, and trading of credits, and 
have harmonized the compliance testing 
and test protocols used for purposes of 
the fleet average standards each agency 
is proposing. Finally, as discussed in 
Section I.C., under their respective 
statutes each agency is called upon to 
exercise its judgment and determine 
standards that are an appropriate 
balance of various relevant statutory 
factors. Given the common technical 
issues before each agency, the similarity 
of the factors each agency is to consider 
and balance, and the authority of each 
agency to take into consideration the 
standards of the other agency, both EPA 
and NHTSA are proposing standards 
that result in a harmonized National 
Program. 
This joint proposal covers passenger 
cars, light-duty-trucks, and medium- 
duty passenger vehicles built in model 
years 2012 through 2016. These vehicle 
categories are responsible for almost 60 
percent of all U.S. transportation-related 
GHG emissions. EPA and NHTSA 
expect that automobile manufacturers 
will meet these proposed standards by 
utilizing technologies that will reduce 
vehicle GHG emissions and improve 
fuel economy. Although many of these 
technologies are available today, the 
emissions reductions and fuel economy 
improvements proposed would involve 
more widespread use of these 
technologies across the light-duty 
vehicle fleet. These include 
improvements to engines, 
transmissions, and tires, increased use 
of start-stop technology, improvements 
in air conditioning systems (to the 
extent currently allowed by law), 
increased use of hybrid and other 
advanced technologies, and the initial 
commercialization of electric vehicles 
and plug-in hybrids. 
The proposed National Program 
would result in approximately 950 
million metric tons of total carbon 
dioxide equivalent emissions reductions 
and approximately 1.8 billion barrels of 
oil savings over the lifetime of vehicles 
sold in model years 2012 through 2016. 
In total, the combined EPA and NHTSA 
2012–2016 standards would reduce 
GHG emissions from the U.S. light-duty 
fleet by approximately 21 percent by 
2030 over the level that would occur in 
the absence of the National Program. 
These proposals also provide important 
energy security benefits, as light-duty 
vehicles are about 95 percent dependent 
on oil-based fuels. The benefits of the 
proposed National Program would total 
about $250 billion at a 3% discount rate, 
or $195 billion at a 7% discount rate. In 
the discussion that follows in Sections 
III and IV, each agency explains the 
related benefits for their individual 
standards. 
Together, EPA and NHTSA estimate 
that the average cost increase for a 
model year 2016 vehicle due to the 
proposed National Program is less than 
$1,100. U.S. consumers who purchase 
their vehicle outright would save 
enough in lower fuel costs over the first 
three years to offset these higher vehicle 
costs. However, most U.S. consumers 
purchase a new vehicle using credit 
rather than paying cash and the typical 
car loan today is a five year, 60 month 
loan. These consumers would see 
immediate savings due to their vehicle’s 
lower fuel consumption in the form of 
reduced monthly costs of $12–$14 per 
month throughout the duration of the 
loan (that is, the fuel savings outweigh 
the increase in loan payments by $12– 
$14 per month). Whether a consumer 
takes out a loan or purchases a new 
vehicle outright, over the lifetime of a 
model year 2016 vehicle, consumers 
would save more than $3,000 due to 
fuel savings. The average 2016 MY 
vehicle will emit 16 fewer metric tons 
of CO2 emissions during its lifetime. 
This joint proposal also offers the 
prospect of important regulatory 
convergence and certainty to automobile 
companies. Absent this proposal, there 
would be three separate Federal and 
State regimes independently regulating 
light-duty vehicles to reduce fuel 
consumption and GHG emissions: 
NHTSA’s CAFE standards, EPA’s GHG 
standards, and the GHG standards 
applicable in California and other States 
adopting the California standards. This 
joint proposal would allow automakers 
to meet both the NHTSA and EPA 
requirements with a single national 
fleet, greatly simplifying the industry’s 
technology, investment and compliance 
strategies. In addition, in a letter dated 
May 18, 2009, California stated that it 
‘‘recognizes the benefit for the country 
and California of a National Program to 
address greenhouse gases and fuel 
economy and the historic 
announcement of United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
and National Highway Transportation 
Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) intent 
to jointly propose a rule to set standards 
for both. California fully supports 
proposal and adoption of such a 
National Program.’’ To promote the 
National Program, California announced 
its commitment to take several actions, 
including revising its program for MYs 
2012–2016 such that compliance with 
the Federal GHG standards would be 
deemed to be compliance with 
California’s GHG standards. This would 
allow the single national fleet used by 
automakers to meet the two Federal 
requirements and to meet California 
requirements as well. This commitment 
was conditioned on several points, 
including EPA GHG standards that are 
substantially similar to those described 
in the May 19, 2009 Notice of Upcoming 
Joint Rulemaking. Many automakers and 
trade associations also announced their 
support for the National Program 
announced that day.18 The 
manufacturers conditioned their 
support on EPA and NHTSA standards 
substantially similar to those described 
in that Notice. NHTSA and EPA met 
with many vehicle manufacturers to 
discuss the feasibility of the National 
Program. EPA and NHTSA are confident 
that these proposed GHG and CAFE 
standards, if finalized, would 
successfully harmonize both the Federal 
and State programs for MYs 2012–2016 
and would allow our country to achieve 
the increased benefits of a single, 
nationwide program to reduce light- 
duty vehicle GHG emissions and reduce 
the country’s dependence on fossil fuels 
by improving these vehicles’ fuel 
economy. 
A successful and sustainable 
automotive industry depends upon, 
among other things, continuous 
technology innovation in general, and 
low greenhouse gas emissions and high 
fuel economy vehicles in particular. In 
this respect, this proposal would help 
spark the investment in technology 
innovation necessary for automakers to 
successfully compete in both domestic 
and export markets, and thereby 
continue to support a strong economy. 
While this proposal covers MYs 
2012–2016, EPA and NHTSA anticipate 
the importance of seeking a strong, 
coordinated national program for light- 
duty vehicles in model years beyond 
2016 in a future rulemaking. 
Key elements of the proposal for a 
harmonized and coordinated program 
are the level and form of the GHG and 
CAFE standards, the available 
compliance mechanisms, and general 
implementation elements. These 
elements are outlined in the following 
sections. 
C. Background and Comparison of 
NHTSA and EPA Statutory Authority 
This section provides the agencies’ 
respective statutory authorities under 
which CAFE and GHG standards are 
established.

amended by EISA. EPCA mandates a 
motor vehicle fuel economy regulatory 
program to meet the various facets of the 
need to conserve energy, including ones 
having environmental and foreign 
policy implications. EPCA allocates the 
responsibility for implementing the 
program between NHTSA and EPA as 
follows: NHTSA sets CAFE standards 
for passenger cars and light trucks; EPA 
establishes the procedures for testing, 
tests vehicles, collects and analyzes 
manufacturers’ data, and calculates the 
average fuel economy of each 
manufacturer’s passenger cars and light 
trucks; and NHTSA enforces the 
standards based on EPA’s calculations. 
a. Standard Setting 
We have summarized below the most 
important aspects of standard setting 
under EPCA, as amended by EISA. 
For each future model year, EPCA 
requires that NHTSA establish 
standards at ‘‘the maximum feasible 
average fuel economy level that it 
decides the manufacturers can achieve 
in that model year,’’ based on the 
agency’s consideration of four statutory 
factors: technological feasibility, 
economic practicability, the effect of 
other standards of the Government on 
fuel economy, and the need of the 
nation to conserve energy. EPCA does 
not define these terms or specify what 
weight to give each concern in 
balancing them; thus, NHTSA defines 
them and determines the appropriate 
weighting based on the circumstances in 
each CAFE standard rulemaking.19 
For MYs 2011–2020, EPCA further 
requires that separate standards for 
passenger cars and for light trucks be set 
at levels high enough to ensure that the 
CAFE of the industry-wide combined 
fleet of new passenger cars and light 
trucks reaches at least 35 mpg not later 
than MY 2020. 
i. Factors That Must Be Considered in 
Deciding the Appropriate Stringency of 
CAFE Standards 
(1) Technological Feasibility 
‘‘Technological feasibility’’ refers to 
whether a particular method of 
improving fuel economy can be 
available for commercial application in 
the model year for which a standard is 
being established. Thus, the agency is 
not limited in determining the level of 
new standards to technology that is 
already being commercially applied at 
the time of the rulemaking. NHTSA has 
historically considered all types of 
technologies that improve real-world 
fuel economy, except those whose 
effects are not reflected in fuel economy 
testing. Principal among them are 
technologies that improve air 
conditioner efficiency because the air 
conditioners are not turned on during 
testing under existing test procedures. 
(2) Economic Practicability 
‘‘Economic practicability’’ refers to 
whether a standard is one ‘‘within the 
financial capability of the industry, but 
not so stringent as to’’ lead to ‘‘adverse 
economic consequences, such as a 
significant loss of jobs or the 
unreasonable elimination of consumer 
choice.’’ 20 This factor is especially 
important in the context of current 
events, where the automobile industry 
is facing significantly adverse economic 
conditions, as well as significant loss of 
jobs. In an attempt to ensure the 
economic practicability of attribute- 
based standards, NHTSA considers a 
variety of factors, including the annual 
rate at which manufacturers can 
increase the percentage of its fleet that 
employs a particular type of fuel-saving 
technology, and cost to consumers. 
Consumer acceptability is also an 
element of economic practicability, one 
which is particularly difficult to gauge 
during times of frequently-changing fuel 
prices. NHTSA believes this approach is 
reasonable for the MY 2012–2016 
standards in view of the facts before it 
at this time. NHTSA is aware, however, 
that facts relating to a variety of key 
issues in CAFE rulemaking are steadily 
evolving and seeks comments on the 
balancing of these factors in light of the 
facts available during the comment 
period. 
At the same time, the law does not 
preclude a CAFE standard that poses 
considerable challenges to any 
individual manufacturer. The 
Conference Report for EPCA, as enacted 
in 1975, makes clear, and the case law 
affirms, ‘‘a determination of maximum 
feasible average fuel economy should 
not be keyed to the single manufacturer 
which might have the most difficulty 
achieving a given level of average fuel 
economy.’’ 21 Instead, NHTSA is 
compelled ‘‘to weigh the benefits to the 
nation of a higher fuel economy 
standard against the difficulties of 
individual automobile manufacturers.’’ 
Id. The law permits CAFE standards 
exceeding the projected capability of 
any particular manufacturer as long as 
the standard is economically practicable 
for the industry as a whole. Thus, while 
a particular CAFE standard may pose 
difficulties for one manufacturer, it may 
also present opportunities for another. 
The CAFE program is not necessarily 
intended to maintain the competitive 
positioning of each particular company. 
Rather, it is intended to enhance fuel 
economy of the vehicle fleet on 
American roads, while protecting motor 
vehicle safety and being mindful of the 
risk of harm to the overall United States 
economy. 
(3) The Effect of Other Motor Vehicle 
Standards of the Government on Fuel 
Economy 
‘‘The effect of other motor vehicle 
standards of the Government on fuel 
economy,’’ involves an analysis of the 
effects of compliance with emission,22 
safety, noise, or damageability standards 
on fuel economy capability and thus on 
average fuel economy. In previous CAFE 
rulemakings, the agency has said that 
pursuant to this provision, it considers 
the adverse effects of other motor 
vehicle standards on fuel economy. It 
said so because, from the CAFE 
program’s earliest years 23 until present, 
the effects of such compliance on fuel 
economy capability over the history of 
the CAFE program have been negative 
ones. For example, safety standards that 
have the effect of increasing vehicle 
weight lower vehicle fuel economy 
capability and thus decrease the level of 
average fuel economy that the agency 
can determine to be feasible. 
In the wake of Massachusetts v. EPA 
and of EPA’s proposed endangerment 
finding, granting of a waiver to 
California for its motor vehicle GHG 
standards, and its own proposal of GHG 
standards, NHTSA is confronted with 
the issue of how to treat those standards 
under the ‘‘other motor vehicle 
standards’’ provision. To the extent the 
GHG standards result in increases in 
fuel economy, they would do so almost 
exclusively as a result of inducing 
manufacturers to install the same types 
of technologies used by manufacturers 
in complying with the CAFE standards. 
The primary exception would involve 
increases in the efficiency of air 
conditioners. 
Comment is requested on whether 
and in what way the effects of the 
California and EPA standards should be

consequences of the CAFE standards in its overall

considered under the ‘‘other motor 
vehicle standards’’ provision or other 
provisions of EPCA in 49 U.S.C. 32902, 
consistent with NHTSA’s independent 
obligation under EPCA/EISA to issue 
CAFE standards. The agency has already 
considered EPA’s proposal and the 
harmonization benefits of the National 
Program in developing its own proposal. 
(4) The Need of the United States To 
Conserve Energy 
‘‘The need of the United States to 
conserve energy’’ means ‘‘the consumer 
cost, national balance of payments, 
environmental, and foreign policy 
implications of our need for large 
quantities of petroleum, especially 
imported petroleum.’’ 24 Environmental 
implications principally include 
reductions in emissions of criteria 
pollutants and carbon dioxide. Prime 
examples of foreign policy implications 
are energy independence and security 
concerns. 
(a) Fuel Prices and the Value of Saving 
Fuel 
Projected future fuel prices are a 
critical input into the preliminary 
economic analysis of alternative CAFE 
standards, because they determine the 
value of fuel savings both to new 
vehicle buyers and to society. In this 
rule, NHTSA relies on fuel price 
projections from the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration’s (EIA) 
Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for this 
analysis. Federal government agencies 
generally use EIA’s projections in their 
assessments of future energy-related 
policies. 
(b) Petroleum Consumption and Import 
Externalities 
U.S. consumption and imports of 
petroleum products impose costs on the 
domestic economy that are not reflected 
in the market price for crude petroleum, 
or in the prices paid by consumers of 
petroleum products such as gasoline. 
These costs include (1) higher prices for 
petroleum products resulting from the 
effect of U.S. oil import demand on the 
world oil price; (2) the risk of 
disruptions to the U.S. economy caused 
by sudden reductions in the supply of 
imported oil to the U.S.; and (3) 
expenses for maintaining a U.S. military 
presence to secure imported oil supplies 
from unstable regions, and for 
maintaining the strategic petroleum 
reserve (SPR) to provide a response 
option should a disruption in 
commercial oil supplies threaten the 
U.S. economy, to allow the United 
States to meet part of its International 
Energy Agency obligation to maintain 
emergency oil stocks, and to provide a 
national defense fuel reserve. Higher 
U.S. imports of crude oil or refined 
petroleum products increase the 
magnitude of these external economic 
costs, thus increasing the true economic 
cost of supplying transportation fuels 
above the resource costs of producing 
them. Conversely, reducing U.S. imports 
of crude petroleum or refined fuels or 
reducing fuel consumption can reduce 
these external costs. 
(c) Air Pollutant Emissions 
While reductions in domestic fuel 
refining and distribution that result 
from lower fuel consumption will 
reduce U.S. emissions of various 
pollutants, additional vehicle use 
associated with the rebound effect 25 
from higher fuel economy will increase 
emissions of these pollutants. Thus, the 
net effect of stricter CAFE standards on 
emissions of each pollutant depends on 
the relative magnitudes of its reduced 
emissions in fuel refining and 
distribution, and increases in its 
emissions from vehicle use. 
Fuel savings from stricter CAFE 
standards also result in lower emissions 
of CO2, the main greenhouse gas emitted 
as a result of refining, distribution, and 
use of transportation fuels. Lower fuel 
consumption reduces carbon dioxide 
emissions directly, because the primary 
source of transportation-related CO2 
emissions is fuel combustion in internal 
combustion engines. 
NHTSA has considered 
environmental issues, both within the 
context of EPCA and the National 
Environmental Policy Act, in making 
decisions about the setting of standards 
from the earliest days of the CAFE 
program. As courts of appeal have noted 
in three decisions stretching over the 
last 20 years,26 NHTSA defined the 
‘‘need of the Nation to conserve energy’’ 
in the late 1970s as including ‘‘the 
consumer cost, national balance of 
payments, environmental, and foreign 
policy implications of our need for large 
quantities of petroleum, especially 
imported petroleum.’’ 27 Pursuant to 
that view, NHTSA declined in the past 
to include diesel engines in determining 
the appropriate level of standards for 
passenger cars and for light trucks 
because particulate emissions from 
diesels were then both a source of 
concern and unregulated.28 In 1988, 
NHTSA included climate change 
concepts in its CAFE notices and 
prepared its first environmental 
assessment addressing that subject.29 It 
cited concerns about climate change as 
one of its reasons for limiting the extent 
of its reduction of the CAFE standard for 
MY 1989 passenger cars.30 Since then, 
NHTSA has considered the benefits of 
reducing tailpipe carbon dioxide 
emissions in its fuel economy 
rulemakings pursuant to the statutory 
requirement to consider the nation’s 
need to conserve energy by reducing 
fuel consumption. 
ii. Other Factors Considered by NHTSA 
NHTSA considers the potential for 
adverse safety consequences when in 
establishing CAFE standards. This 
practice is recognized approvingly in 
case law.31 Under the universal or ‘‘flat’’ 
CAFE standards that NHTSA was 
previously authorized to establish, the 
primary risk to safety came from the 
possibility that manufacturers would 
respond to higher standards by building 
smaller, less safe vehicles in order to 
‘‘balance out’’ the larger, safer vehicles 
that the public generally preferred to 
buy. Under the attribute-based 
standards being proposed in this action, 
that risk is reduced because building 
smaller vehicles tends to raise a 
manufacturer’s overall CAFE obligation, 
rather than only raising its fleet average 
CAFE. However, even under attribute- 
based standards, there is still risk that 
manufacturers will rely on 
downweighting to improve their fuel 
economy (for a given vehicle at a given

footprint target) in ways that may 
reduce safety. 
In addition, the agency considers 
consumer demand in establishing new 
standards and in assessing whether 
already established standards remained 
feasible. In the 1980’s, the agency relied 
in part on the unexpected drop in fuel 
prices and the resulting unexpected 
failure of consumer demand for small 
cars to develop in explaining the need 
to reduce CAFE standards for a several 
year period in order to give 
manufacturers time to develop 
alternative technology-based strategies 
for improving fuel economy. 
iii. Factors That NHTSA Is Statutorily 
Prohibited From Considering in Setting 
Standards 
EPCA provides that in determining 
the level at which it should set CAFE 
standards for a particular model year, 
NHTSA may not consider the ability of 
manufacturers to take advantage of 
several EPCA provisions that facilitate 
compliance with the CAFE standards 
and thereby reduce the costs of 
compliance.32 As noted below in 
Section IV, manufacturers can earn 
compliance credits by exceeding the 
CAFE standards and then use those 
credits to achieve compliance in years 
in which their measured average fuel 
economy falls below the standards. 
Manufacturers can also increase their 
CAFE levels through MY 2019 by 
producing alternative fuel vehicles. 
EPCA provides an incentive for 
producing these vehicles by specifying 
that their fuel economy is to be 
determined using a special calculation 
procedure that results in those vehicles 
being assigned a high fuel economy 
level. 
iv. Weighing and Balancing of Factors 
NHTSA has broad discretion in 
balancing the above factors in 
determining the average fuel economy 
level that the manufacturers can 
achieve. Congress ‘‘specifically 
delegated the process of setting * * * 
fuel economy standards with broad 
guidelines concerning the factors that 
the agency must consider.’’ The breadth 
of those guidelines, the absence of any 
statutorily prescribed formula for 
balancing the factors, the fact that the 
relative weight to be given to the various 
factors may change from rulemaking to 
rulemaking as the underlying facts 
change, and the fact that the factors may 
often be conflicting with respect to 
whether they militate toward higher or 
lower standards give NHTSA discretion 
to decide what weight to give each of 
the competing policies and concerns 
and then determine how to balance 
them—as long as NHTSA’s balancing 
does not undermine the fundamental 
purpose of the EPCA: Energy 
conservation, and as long as that 
balancing reasonably accommodates 
‘‘conflicting policies that were 
committed to the agency’s care by the 
statute.’’ 
Thus, EPCA does not mandate that 
any particular number be adopted when 
NHTSA determines the level of CAFE 
standards. Rather, any number within a 
zone of reasonableness may be, in 
NHTSA’s assessment, the level of 
stringency that manufacturers can 
achieve. See, e.g., Hercules Inc. v. EPA, 
598 F.2d 91, 106 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (‘‘In 
reviewing a numerical standard we 
must ask whether the agency’s numbers 
are within a zone of reasonableness, not 
whether its numbers are precisely 
right’’). 
v. Other Requirements Related to 
Standard Setting 
The standards for passenger cars and 
those for light trucks must increase 
ratably each year. This statutory 
requirement is interpreted, in 
combination with the requirement to set 
the standards for each model year at the 
level determined to be the maximum 
feasible level that manufacturers can 
achieve for that model year, to mean 
that the annual increases should not be 
disproportionately large or small in 
relation to each other. 
The standards for passenger cars and 
light trucks must be based on one or 
more vehicle attributes, like size or 
weight, that correlate with fuel economy 
and must be expressed in terms of a 
mathematical function. Fuel economy 
targets are set for individual vehicles 
and increase as the attribute decreases 
and vice versa. For example, size-based 
(i.e., size-indexed) standards assign 
higher fuel economy targets to smaller 
(and generally, but not necessarily, 
lighter) vehicles and lower ones to 
larger (and generally, but not 
necessarily, heavier) vehicles. The fleet- 
wide average fuel economy that a 
particular manufacturer is required to 
achieve depends on the size mix of its 
fleet, i.e., the proportion of the fleet that 
is small-, medium- or large-sized. 
This approach can be used to require 
virtually all manufacturers to increase 
significantly the fuel economy of a 
broad range of both passenger cars and 
light trucks, i.e., the manufacturer must 
improve the fuel economy of all the 
vehicles in its fleet. Further, this 
approach can do so without creating an 
incentive for manufacturers to make 
small vehicles smaller or large vehicles 
larger, with attendant implications for 
safety. 
b. Test Procedures for Measuring Fuel 
Economy 
EPCA provides EPA with the 
responsibility for establishing CAFE test 
procedures. Current test procedures 
measure the effects of nearly all fuel 
saving technologies. The principal 
exception is improvements in air 
conditioning efficiency. By statutory 
law in the case of passenger cars and by 
administrative regulation in the case of 
light trucks, air conditioners are not 
turned on during fuel economy testing. 
See Section I.C.2 for details. 
The fuel economy test procedures for 
light trucks could be amended through 
rulemaking to provide for air 
conditioner operation during testing and 
to take other steps for improving the 
accuracy and representativeness of fuel 
economy measurements. Comment is 
sought by the agencies regarding 
implementing such amendments 
beginning in MY 2017 and also on the 
more immediate interim alternative step 
of providing CAFE program credits 
under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 
32904(c) for light trucks equipped with 
relatively efficient air conditioners for 
MYs 2012–2016. These CAFE credits 
would be earned by manufacturers on 
the same terms and under the same 
conditions as EPA is proposing to 
provide them under the CAA, and 
additional detail is on this request for 
comment for early CAFE credits is 
contained in Section IV of this 
preamble. Modernizing the passenger 
car test procedures, or even providing 
similar credits, would not be possible 
under EPCA as currently written. 
c. Enforcement and Compliance 
Flexibility 
EPA is responsible for measuring 
automobile manufacturers’ CAFE so that 
NHTSA can determine compliance with 
the CAFE standards. When NHTSA 
finds that a manufacturer is not in 
compliance, it notifies the 
manufacturer. Surplus credits generated 
from the five previous years can be used 
to make up the deficit. The amount of 
credit earned is determined by 
multiplying the number of tenths of a 
mpg by which a manufacturer exceeds 
a standard for a particular category of 
automobiles by the total volume of 
automobiles of that category 
manufactured by the manufacturer for a 
given model year. If there are no (or not 
enough) credits available, then the 
manufacturer can either pay the fine, or 
submit a carry back plan to NHTSA. A 
carry back plan describes what the 
manufacturer plans to do in the

following three model years to earn 
enough credits to make up for the 
deficit. NHTSA must examine and 
determine whether to approve the plan. 
In the event that a manufacturer does 
not comply with a CAFE standard, even 
after the consideration of credits, EPCA 
provides for the assessing of civil 
penalties, unless, as provided below, the 
manufacturer has earned credits for 
exceeding a standard in an earlier year 
or expects to earn credits in a later 
year.33 The Act specifies a precise 
formula for determining the amount of 
civil penalties for such a 
noncompliance. The penalty, as 
adjusted for inflation by law, is $5.50 for 
each tenth of a mpg that a 
manufacturer’s average fuel economy 
falls short of the standard for a given 
model year multiplied by the total 
volume of those vehicles in the affected 
fleet (i.e., import or domestic passenger 
car, or light truck), manufactured for 
that model year. The amount of the 
penalty may not be reduced except 
under the unusual or extreme 
circumstances specified in the statute. 
Unlike the National Traffic and Motor 
Vehicle Safety Act, EPCA does not 
provide for recall and remedy in the 
event of a noncompliance. The presence 
of recall and remedy provisions34 in the 
Safety Act and their absence in EPCA is 
believed to arise from the difference in 
the application of the safety standards 
and CAFE standards. A safety standard 
applies to individual vehicles; that is, 
each vehicle must possess the requisite 
equipment or feature that must provide 
the requisite type and level of 
performance. If a vehicle does not, it is 
noncompliant. Typically, a vehicle does 
not entirely lack an item or equipment 
or feature. Instead, the equipment or 
features fails to perform adequately. 
Recalling the vehicle to repair or replace 
the noncompliant equipment or feature 
can usually be readily accomplished. 
In contrast, a CAFE standard applies 
to a manufacturer’s entire fleet for a 
model year. It does not require that a 
particular individual vehicle be 
equipped with any particular equipment 
or feature or meet a particular level of 
fuel economy. It does require that the 
manufacturer’s fleet, as a whole, 
comply. Further, although under the 
attribute-based approach to setting 
CAFE standards fuel economy targets 
are established for individual vehicles 
based on their footprints, the vehicles 
are not required to comply with those 
targets. However, as a practical matter, 
if a manufacturer chooses to design 
some vehicles that fall below their target 
levels of fuel economy, it will need to 
design other vehicles that exceed their 
targets if the manufacturer’s overall fleet 
average is to meet the applicable 
standard. 
Thus, under EPCA, there is no such 
thing as a noncompliant vehicle, only a 
noncompliant fleet. No particular 
vehicle in a noncompliant fleet is any 
more, or less, noncompliant than any 
other vehicle in the fleet. 
2. EPA Statutory Authority 
Title II of the Clean Air Act (CAA) 
provides for comprehensive regulation 
of mobile sources, authorizing EPA to 
regulate emissions of air pollutants from 
all mobile source categories. Pursuant to 
these sweeping grants of authority, EPA 
considers such issues as technology 
effectiveness, its cost (both per vehicle, 
per manufacturer, and per consumer), 
the lead time necessary to implement 
the technology, and based on this the 
feasibility and practicability of potential 
standards; the impacts of potential 
standards on emissions reductions of 
both GHGs and non-GHGs; the impacts 
of standards on oil conservation and 
energy security; the impacts of 
standards on fuel savings by consumers; 
the impacts of standards on the auto 
industry; other energy impacts; as well 
as other relevant factors such as impacts 
on safety. 
This proposal implements a specific 
provision from Title II, section 202(a).35 
Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act 
(CAA) states that ‘‘the Administrator 
shall by regulation prescribe (and from 
time to time revise) * * * standards 
applicable to the emission of any air 
pollutant from any class or classes of 
new motor vehicles * * *, which in his 
judgment cause, or contribute to, air 
pollution which may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger public health or 
welfare.’’ If EPA makes the appropriate 
endangerment and cause or contribute 
findings, then section 202(a) authorizes 
EPA to issue standards applicable to 
emissions of those pollutants. 
Any standards under CAA section 
202(a)(1) ‘‘shall be applicable to such 
vehicles * * * for their useful life.’’ 
Emission standards set by the EPA 
under CAA section 202(a)(1) are 
technology-based, as the levels chosen 
must be premised on a finding of 
technological feasibility. Thus, 
standards promulgated under CAA 
section 202(a) are to take effect only 
‘‘after providing such period as the 
Administrator finds necessary to permit 
the development and application of the 
requisite technology, giving appropriate 
consideration to the cost of compliance 
within such period’’ (section 202(a)(2); 
see also NRDC v. EPA, 655 F.2d 318, 
322 (D.C. Cir. 1981)). EPA is afforded 
considerable discretion under section 
202(a) when assessing issues of 
technical feasibility and availability of 
lead time to implement new technology. 
Such determinations are ‘‘subject to the 
restraints of reasonableness’’, which 
‘‘does not open the door to ‘crystal ball’ 
inquiry.’’ NRDC, 655 F.2d at 328, 
quoting International Harvester Co. v. 
Ruckelshaus, 478 F.2d 615, 629 (D.C. 
Cir. 1973). However, ‘‘EPA is not 
obliged to provide detailed solutions to 
every engineering problem posed in the 
perfection of the trap-oxidizer. In the 
absence of theoretical objections to the 
technology, the agency need only 
identify the major steps necessary for 
development of the device, and give 
plausible reasons for its belief that the 
industry will be able to solve those 
problems in the time remaining. The 
EPA is not required to rebut all 
speculation that unspecified factors may 
hinder ‘real world’ emission control.’’ 
NRDC, 655 F.2d at 333–34. In 
developing such technology-based 
standards, EPA has the discretion to 
consider different standards for 
appropriate groupings of vehicles 
(‘‘class or classes of new motor 
vehicles’’), or a single standard for a 
larger grouping of motor vehicles 
(NRDC, 655 F.2d at 338). 
Although standards under CAA 
section 202(a)(1) are technology-based, 
they are not based exclusively on 
technological capability. EPA has the 
discretion to consider and weigh 
various factors along with technological 
feasibility, such as the cost of 
compliance (see section 202(a)(2)), lead 
time necessary for compliance (section 
202(a)(2)), safety (see NRDC, 655 F.2d at 
336 n. 31) and other impacts on 
consumers, and energy impacts 
associated with use of the technology. 
See George E. Warren Corp. v. EPA, 159 
F.3d 616, 623–624 (D.C. Cir. 1998) 
(ordinarily permissible for EPA to 
consider factors not specifically 
enumerated in the Act). See also Entergy 
Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc., 129 S.Ct. 
1498, 1508–09 (2009) (congressional 
silence did not bar EPA from employing 
cost-benefit analysis under Clean Water 
Act absent some other clear indication 
that such analysis was prohibited; 
rather, silence indicated discretion to 
use or not use such an approach as the 
agency deems appropriate). 
In addition, EPA has clear authority to 
set standards under CAA section 202(a) 
that are technology forcing when EPA 
considers that to be appropriate, but is

37 See 49 U.S.C. 32904(c).

not required to do so (as compared to 
standards set under provisions such as 
section 202(a)(3) and section 213(a)(3)). 
EPA has interpreted a similar statutory 
provision, CAA section 231, as follows: 
While the statutory language of section 231 
is not identical to other provisions in title II 
of the CAA that direct EPA to establish 
technology-based standards for various types 
of engines, EPA interprets its authority under 
section 231 to be somewhat similar to those 
provisions that require us to identify a 
reasonable balance of specified emissions 
reduction, cost, safety, noise, and other 
factors. See, e.g., Husqvarna AB v. EPA, 254 
F.3d 195 (DC Cir. 2001) (upholding EPA’s 
promulgation of technology-based standards 
for small non-road engines under section 
213(a)(3) of the CAA). However, EPA is not 
compelled under section 231 to obtain the 
‘‘greatest degree of emission reduction 
achievable’’ as per sections 213 and 202 of 
the CAA, and so EPA does not interpret the 
Act as requiring the agency to give 
subordinate status to factors such as cost, 
safety, and noise in determining what 
standards are reasonable for aircraft engines. 
Rather, EPA has greater flexibility under 
section 231 in determining what standard is 
most reasonable for aircraft engines, and is 
not required to achieve a ‘‘technology 
forcing’’ result.36 
This interpretation was upheld as 
reasonable in NACAA v. EPA, (489 F.3d 
1221, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). CAA 
section 202(a) does not specify the 
degree of weight to apply to each factor, 
and EPA accordingly has discretion in 
choosing an appropriate balance among 
factors. See Sierra Club v. EPA, 325 F.3d 
374, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (even where a 
provision is technology-forcing, the 
provision ‘‘does not resolve how the 
Administrator should weigh all [the 
statutory] factors in the process of 
finding the ’greatest emission reduction 
achievable’ ’’). Also see Husqvarna AB 
v. EPA, 254 F. 3d 195, 200 (D.C. Cir. 
2001) (great discretion to balance 
statutory factors in considering level of 
technology-based standard, and 
statutory requirement ‘‘to [give 
appropriate] consideration to the cost of 
applying * * * technology’’ does not 
mandate a specific method of cost 
analysis); see also Hercules Inc. v. EPA, 
598 F. 2d 91, 106 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (‘‘In 
reviewing a numerical standard we 
must ask whether the agency’s numbers 
are within a zone of reasonableness, not 
whether its numbers are precisely 
right’’); Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 
390 U.S. 747, 797 (1968) (same); Federal 
Power Commission v. Conway Corp., 
426 U.S. 271, 278 (1976) (same); Exxon 
Mobil Gas Marketing Co. v. FERC, 297 
F. 3d 1071, 1084 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (same). 
a. EPA’s Testing Authority 
Under section 203 of the CAA, sales 
of vehicles are prohibited unless the 
vehicle is covered by a certificate of 
conformity. EPA issues certificates of 
conformity pursuant to section 206 of 
the Act, based on (necessarily) pre-sale 
testing conducted either by EPA or by 
the manufacturer. The Federal Test 
Procedure (FTP or ‘‘city’’ test) and the 
Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET or 
‘‘highway’’ test) are used for this 
purpose. Compliance with standards is 
required not only at certification but 
throughout a vehicle’s useful life, so 
that testing requirements may continue 
post-certification. Useful life standards 
may apply an adjustment factor to 
account for vehicle emission control 
deterioration or variability in use 
(section 206(a)). 
Pursuant to EPCA, EPA is required to 
measure fuel economy for each model 
and to calculate each manufacturer’s 
average fuel economy.37 EPA uses the 
same tests—the FTP and HFET—for fuel 
economy testing. EPA established the 
FTP for emissions measurement in the 
early 1970s. In 1976, in response to the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(EPCA) statute, EPA extended the use of 
the FTP to fuel economy measurement 
and added the HFET.38 The provisions 
in the 1976 regulation, effective with the 
1977 model year, established 
procedures to calculate fuel economy 
values both for labeling and for CAFE 
purposes. Under EPCA, EPA is required 
to use these procedures (or procedures 
which yield comparable results) for 
measuring fuel economy for cars for 
CAFE purposes, but not for labeling 
purposes.39 EPCA does not pose this 
restriction on CAFE test procedures for 
light trucks, but EPA does use the FTP 
and HFET for this purpose. EPA 
determines fuel economy by measuring 
the amount of CO2 and all other carbon 
compounds (e.g. total hydrocarbons 
(THC) and carbon monoxide (CO)), and 
then, by mass balance, calculating the 
amount of fuel consumed. 
b. EPA Enforcement Authority 
Section 207 of the CAA grants EPA 
broad authority to require 
manufacturers to remedy vehicles if 
EPA determines there are a substantial 
number of noncomplying vehicles. In 
addition, section 205 of the CAA 
authorizes EPA to assess penalties of up 
to $37,500 per vehicle for violations of 
various prohibited acts specified in the 
CAA. In determining the appropriate 
penalty, EPA must consider a variety of 
factors such as the gravity of the 
violation, the economic impact of the 
violation, the violator’s history of 
compliance, and ‘‘such other matters as 
justice may require.’’ Unlike EPCA, the 
CAA does not authorize vehicle 
manufacturers to pay fines in lieu of 
meeting emission standards. 
3. Comparing the Agencies’ Authority 
As the above discussion makes clear, 
there are both important differences 
between the statutes under which each 
agency is acting as well as several 
important areas of similarity. One 
important difference is that EPA’s 
authority addresses various GHGs, 
while NHTSA’s authority addresses fuel 
economy as measured under specified 
test procedures. This difference is 
reflected in this rulemaking in the scope 
of the two standards: EPA’s proposal 
takes into account air conditioning 
related reductions, as well as proposed 
standards for methane and N2O, but 
NHTSA’s does not. A second important 
difference is that EPA is proposing 
certain compliance flexibilities, and 
takes those flexibilities into account in 
its technical analysis and modeling 
supporting its proposal. EPCA places 
certain limits on compliance flexibilities 
for CAFE, and expressly prohibits 
NHTSA from considering the impacts of 
the compliance flexibilities in setting 
the CAFE standard so that the 
manufacturers’ election to avail 
themselves of the permitted flexibilities 
remains strictly voluntary.40 The Clean 
Air Act, on the other hand, contains no 
such prohibition. These considerations 
result in some differences in the 
technical analysis and modeling used to 
support EPA’s and NHTSA’s proposed 
standards. 
These differences, however, do not 
change the fact that in many critical 
ways the two agencies are charged with 
addressing the same basic issue of 
reducing GHG emissions and improving 
fuel economy. Given the direct 
relationship between emissions of CO2 
and fuel economy levels, both agencies 
are looking at the same set of control 
technologies (with the exception of the 
air conditioning related technologies). 
The standards set by each agency will 
drive the kind and degree of penetration 
of this set of technologies across the 
vehicle fleet. As a result, each agency is 
trying to answer the same basic 
question—what kind and degree of 
technology penetration is necessary to 
achieve the agencies’ objectives in the 
rulemaking time frame, given the

agencies’ respective statutory 
authorities? 
In making the determination of what 
standards are appropriate under the 
CAA and EPCA, each agency is to 
exercise its judgment and balance many 
similar factors, such as the availability 
of technologies, the appropriate lead 
time for introduction of technology, and 
based on this the feasibility and 
practicability of their standards; the 
impacts of their standards on emissions 
reductions (of both GHGs and non- 
GHGs); the impacts of their standards on 
oil conservation; the impacts of their 
standards on fuel savings by consumers; 
the impacts of their standards on the 
auto industry; as well as other relevant 
factors such as impacts on safety. 
Conceptually, therefore, each agency is 
considering and balancing many of the 
same factors, and each agency is making 
a decision that at its core is answering 
the same basic question of what kind 
and degree of technology penetration is 
it appropriate to call for in light of all 
of the relevant factors. Finally, each 
agency has the authority to take into 
consideration impacts of the standards 
of the other agency. EPCA calls for 
NHTSA to take into consideration the 
effects of EPA’s emissions standards on 
fuel economy capability (see 49 U.S.C. 
32902 (f)), and EPA has the discretion 
to take into consideration NHTSA’s 
CAFE standards in determining 
appropriate action under section 202(a). 
This is consistent with the Supreme 
Court’s statement that EPA’s mandate to 
protect public health and welfare is 
wholly independent from NHTSA’s 
mandate to promote energy efficiency, 
but there is no reason to think the two 
agencies cannot both administer their 
obligations and yet avoid inconsistency. 
Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 532 
(2007). 
In this context, it is in the Nation’s 
interest for the two agencies to work 
together in developing their respective 
proposed standards, and they have done 
so. For example, the agencies have 
committed considerable effort to 
develop a joint Technical Support 
Document that provides a technical 
basis underlying each agency’s analyses. 
The agencies also have worked closely 
together in developing and reviewing 
their respective modeling, to develop 
the best analysis and to promote 
technical consistency. The agencies 
have developed a common set of 
attribute-based curves that each agency 
supports as appropriate both technically 
and from a policy perspective. The 
agencies have also worked closely to 
ensure that their respective programs 
will work in a coordinated fashion, and 
will provide regulatory compatibility 
that allows auto manufacturers to build 
a single national light-duty fleet that 
would comply with both the GHG and 
the CAFE standards. The resulting 
overall close coordination of the 
proposed GHG and CAFE standards 
should not be surprising, however, as 
each agency is using a jointly developed 
technical basis to address the closely 
intertwined challenges of energy 
security and climate change. As 
discussed above, in determining the 
standards to propose the agencies are 
called upon to weigh and balance 
various factors that are relevant under 
their respective statutory provisions. 
Each agency is to exercise its judgment 
and balance many similar factors, such 
as the availability of technologies, the 
appropriate lead time for introduction of 
technology, and based on this, the 
feasibility and practicability of their 
standards; and the impacts of their 
standards on the following: Emissions 
reductions (of both GHGs and non- 
GHGs); oil conservation; fuel savings by 
consumers; the auto industry; as well as 
other relevant factors such as safety. 
Conceptually, each agency is 
considering and balancing many of the 
same factors, and each agency is making 
a decision that at its core is answering 
the same basic question of what kind 
and degree of technology penetration is 
appropriate and required in light of all 
of the relevant factors. Each 
Administrator is called upon to exercise 
judgment and propose standards that 
the Administrator determines are a 
reasonable balance of these relevant 
factors. 
As set out in detail in Sections III and 
IV of this notice, both EPA and NHTSA 
believe the agencies’ proposals are fully 
justified under their respective statutory 
criteria. The proposed standards can be 
achieved within the lead time provided, 
based on a projected increased use of 
various technologies which in most 
cases are already in commercial 
application in the fleet to varying 
degrees. Detailed modeling of the 
technologies that could be employed by 
each manufacturer supports this initial 
conclusion. The agencies also carefully 
assessed the costs of the proposed rules, 
both for the industry as a whole and per 
manufacturer, as well as the costs per 
vehicle, and consider these costs to be 
reasonable and recoverable (from fuel 
savings). The agencies recognize the 
significant increase in the application of 
technology that the proposed standards 
would require across a high percentage 
of vehicles, which will require the 
manufacturers to devote considerable 
engineering and development resources 
before 2012 laying the critical 
foundation for the widespread 
deployment of upgraded technology 
across a high percentage of the 2012– 
2016 fleet. This clearly will be 
challenging for automotive 
manufacturers and their suppliers, 
especially in the current economic 
climate. However, based on all of the 
analyses performed by the agencies, our 
judgment is that it is a challenge that 
can reasonably be met. 
The agencies also evaluated the 
impacts of these standards with respect 
to the expected reductions in GHGs and 
oil consumption and, found them to be 
very significant in magnitude. The 
agencies considered other factors such 
as the impacts on noise, energy, and 
vehicular congestion. The impact on 
safety was also given careful 
consideration. Moreover, the agencies 
quantified the various costs and benefits 
of the proposed standards, to the extent 
practicable. The agencies’ analyses to 
date indicate that the overall quantified 
benefits of the proposed standards far 
outweigh the projected costs. All of 
these factors support the reasonableness 
of the proposed standards. 
The agencies also evaluated 
alternatives which were less and more 
stringent than those proposed. Less 
stringent standards, however, would 
forego important GHG emission 
reductions and fuel savings that are 
technically achievable at reasonable cost 
in the lead time provided. In addition, 
less stringent GHG standards would not 
result in a harmonized National 
Program for the country. Based on 
California’s letter of May 18, 2009, the 
GHG emission standards would not 
result in the State of California revising 
its regulations such that compliance 
with EPA’s GHG standards would be 
deemed to be compliance with 
California’s GHG standards for these 
model years. The substantial cost 
advantages associated with a single 
national program discussed at the outset 
of this section would then be foregone. 
The agencies are not proposing any of 
the more stringent alternatives analyzed 
largely due to concerns over lead time 
and economic practicability. The 
proposed standards already require 
aggressive application of technologies, 
and more stringent standards which 
would require more widespread use 
(including more substantial 
implementation of advanced 
technologies such as strong hybrids) 
raise serious issues of adequacy of lead 
time, not only to meet the standards but 
to coordinate such significant changes 
with manufacturers’ redesign cycles. At 
a time when the entire industry remains 
in an economically critical state, the 
agencies believe that it would be

unreasonable to propose more stringent 
standards. Even in a case where 
economic factors were not a 
consideration, there are real-world time 
constraints which must be considered 
due to the short lead time available for 
the early years of this program, in 
particular for model years 2012 and 
2013. The physical processes which the 
automotive industry must follow in 
order to introduce reliable, high quality 
products require certain minimums of 
time during the product development 
process. These include time needed for 
durability testing which requires 
significant mileage accumulation under 
a range of conditions (e.g., high and low 
temperatures, high altitude, etc.) in both 
real-world and laboratory conditions. In 
addition, the product development 
cycle includes a number of pre- 
production gateways on the 
manufacturing side at both the supplier 
level and at the automotive 
manufacturer level that are constrained 
by time. Thus adequate lead-time is an 
important factor that the agencies have 
taken into consideration in evaluating 
the proposed standards as well as the 
alternative standards. 
As noted, both agencies also 
considered the overall costs of their 
respective proposed standards in 
relation to the projected benefits. The 
fact that the benefits are estimated to 
considerably exceed their costs supports 
the view that the proposed standards 
represent a reasonable balance of the 
relevant statutory factors. In drawing 
this conclusion, the agencies 
acknowledge the uncertainties and 
limitations of the analyses. For example, 
the analysis of the benefits is highly 
dependent on the estimated price of fuel 
projected out many years into the 
future. There is also significant 
uncertainty in the potential range of 
values that could be assigned to the 
social cost of carbon. There are a variety 
of impacts that the agencies are unable 
to quantify, such as non-market 
damages, extreme weather, socially 
contingent effects, or the potential for 
longer-term catastrophic events, or the 
impact on consumer choice. The 
agencies also note the need to consider 
factors such as the availability of 
technology within the lead time 
provided and many of the other factors 
discussed above. The cost-benefit 
analyses are one of the important things 
the agencies consider in making a 
judgment as to the appropriate 
standards to propose under their 
respective statutes. Consideration of the 
results of the cost-benefit analyses by 
the agencies, however, includes careful 
consideration of the limitations 
discussed above. 
One important area where the two 
agencies’ authorities are similar but not 
identical involves the transfer of credits 
between a single firm’s car and truck 
fleets. EISA revised EPCA to allow for 
such credit transfers, but with a cap on 
the amount of CAFE credits which can 
be transferred between the car and truck 
fleets. 49 U.S.C. 32903(g)(3). Under CAA 
section 202(a), EPA is proposing to 
allow CO2 credit transfers between a 
single manufacturer’s car and truck 
fleets, with no corresponding limits on 
such transfers. In general, the EPCA 
limit on CAFE credit transfers is not 
expected to have the practical effect of 
limiting the amount of CO2 emission 
credits manufacturers may be able to 
transfer under the CAA program, 
recognizing that manufacturers must 
comply with both the proposed CAFE 
standards and the proposed EPA 
standards. However, it is possible that 
in some specific circumstances the 
EPCA limit on CAFE credit transfers 
could constrain the ability of a 
manufacturer to achieve cost savings 
through unlimited use of GHG 
emissions credit transfers under the 
CAA program. 
The agencies request comment on the 
impact of the EISA credit transfer caps 
on the implementation of the proposed 
CAFE and GHG standards, including 
whether it would impose such a 
constraint and the impacts of a 
constraint on costs, emissions, and fuel 
economy. In addition, the agencies 
invite comment on approaches that 
could assist in addressing this issue, 
recognizing the importance the agencies 
place on harmonization, and that would 
be consistent with their respective 
statutes. For example, any approach 
must be consistent with both the EISA 
transfer caps and the EPCA requirement 
to set annual CAFE standards at the 
maximum feasible average fuel economy 
level that NHTSA decides the 
manufacturers can achieve in that 
model year, based on the agency’s 
consideration of the four statutory 
factors. Manufacturers should submit 
publicly available evidence supporting 
their position on this issue so that a well 
informed decision can be made and 
explained to the public. 
D. Summary of the Proposed Standards 
for the National Program 
1. Joint Analytical Approach 
NHTSA and EPA have worked closely 
together on nearly every aspect of this 
joint proposal. The extent and results of 
this collaboration is reflected in the 
elements of the respective NHTSA and 
EPA proposals, as well as the analytical 
work contained in the Joint Technical 
Support Document (Joint TSD). The 
Joint TSD, in particular, describes 
important details of the analytical work 
that are shared, as well as any 
differences in approach. These includes 
the build up of the baseline and 
reference fleets, the derivation of the 
shape of the curve that defines the 
standards, a detailed description of the 
costs and effectiveness of the technology 
choices that are available to vehicle 
manufacturers, a summary of the 
computer models used to estimate how 
technologies might be added to vehicles, 
and finally the economic inputs used to 
calculate the impacts and benefits of the 
rules, where practicable. Some of these 
are highlighted below. 
EPA and NHTSA have jointly 
developed attribute curve shapes that 
each agency is using for its proposed 
standards. Both agencies reviewed the 
shape of the attribute-based curve used 
for the model year 2011 CAFE 
standards. After a new and thorough 
analysis of current vehicle data and the 
comments received from previous two 
CAFE rules, the two agencies improved 
upon the constrained logistic curve and 
developed a similarly shaped piece-wise 
linear function. Further details of these 
functions can be found in Sections III 
and IV of this preamble as well as 
Chapter 2 of the Joint TSD. 
A critical technical underpinning of 
each agency’s proposal is the cost and 
effectiveness of the various control 
technologies. These are used to analyze 
the feasibility and cost of potential GHG 
and CAFE standards. The technical 
work reflected in the joint TSD is the 
culmination of over 3 years of literature 
research, consultation with experts, 
detailed computer simulations, vehicle 
tear-downs and engineering review, all 
of which will continue into the future 
as more data becomes available. To 
promote transparency, the vast majority 
of this information is collected from 
publically available sources, and can be 
found in the docket of this rule. Non- 
public (i.e., confidential manufacturer) 
information was used only to the 
limited extent it was needed to fill a

41 There is no such statutory limitation with 
respect to light trucks. 
42 The agencies are using a common conversion 
factor between fuel economy in units of miles per 
gallon and CO2 emissions in units of grams per 
mile. This conversion factor is 8,887 grams CO2 per 
gallon gasoline fuel. Diesel fuel has a conversion 
factor of 10,180 grams CO2 per gallon diesel fuel 
though for the purposes of this calculation, we are 
assuming 100% gasoline fuel. 
43 See 49 CFR 523.2 for the exact definition of 
‘‘footprint.’’ 
44 Because required CAFE levels depend on the 
mix of vehicles sold by manufacturers in a model 
year, NHTSA’s estimate of future required CAFE 
levels depends on its estimate of the mix of vehicles 
that will be sold in that model year. NHTSA 
currently estimates that the MY 2011 standards will 
require average fuel economy levels of 30.5 mpg for 
passenger cars, 24.2 mpg for light trucks, and 27.6 
mpg for the combined fleet. 
tailored for NHTSA’s EPCA and EISA 
needs, while the OMEGA model is 
tailored for EPA’s CAA needs. In 
developing the National Program, EPA 
and NHTSA have worked closely to 
ensure that consistent and reasonable 
results are achieved from both models. 
This fruitful collaboration has resulted 
in the improvement of both approaches 
and now, far from being redundant, 
these models serve the purposes of the 
respective agencies while also 
maintaining an important validating 
role. The models and their inputs can 
also be found in the docket. Further 
description of the model and outputs 
can be found in Sections II and IV of 
this preamble, and Chapter 3 of the Joint 
TSD. 
This comprehensive joint analytical 
approach has provided a sound and 
consistent technical basis for each 
agency in developing its proposed 
standards, which are summarized in the 
sections below. 
2. Level of the Standards 
In this notice, EPA and NHTSA are 
proposing two separate sets of 
standards, each under its respective 
statutory authorities. EPA is proposing 
national CO2 emissions standards for 
light-duty vehicles under section 202 (a) 
of the Clean Air Act. These standards 
would require these vehicles to meet an 
estimated combined average emissions 
level of 250 grams/mile of CO2 in model 
year 2016. NHTSA is proposing CAFE 
standards for passenger cars and light 
trucks under 49 U.S.C. 32902. These 
standards would require them to meet 
an estimated combined average fuel 
economy level of 34.1 mpg in model 
year 2016. The proposed standards for 
both agencies begin with the 2012 
model year, with standards increasing 
in stringency through model year 2016. 
They represent a harmonized approach 
that will allow industry to build a single 
national fleet that will satisfy both the 
GHG requirements under the CAA and 
CAFE requirements under EPCA/EISA. 
Given differences in their respective 
statutory authorities, however, the 
agencies’ proposed standards include 
some important differences. Under the 
CO2 fleet average standard proposed 
under CAA section 202(a), EPA expects 
manufacturers to take advantage of the 
option to generate CO2-equivalent 
credits by reducing emissions of 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and CO2 
through improvements in their air 
conditioner systems. EPA accounted for 
these reductions in developing its 
proposed CO2 standard. EPCA does not 
allow vehicle manufacturers to use air 
conditioning credits in complying with 
CAFE standards for passenger cars.41 
CO2 emissions due to air conditioning 
operation are not measured by the test 
procedure mandated by statute for use 
in establishing and enforcing CAFE 
standards for passenger cars. As a result, 
improvements in the efficiency of 
passenger car air conditioners would 
not be considered as a possible control 
technology for purposes of CAFE. 
These differences regarding the 
treatment of air conditioning 
improvements (related to CO2 and HFC 
reductions) affect the relative stringency 
of the EPA standard and NHTSA 
standard. The 250 grams per mile of CO2 
equivalent emissions limit is equivalent 
to 35.5 mpg 42 if the automotive industry 
were to meet this CO2 level all through 
fuel economy improvements. As a 
consequence of the prohibition against 
NHTSA’s allowing credits for air 
conditioning improvements for 
purposes of passenger car CAFE 
compliance, NHTSA is proposing fuel 
economy standards that are estimated to 
require a combined (passenger car and 
light truck) average fuel economy level 
of 34.1 mpg by MY 2016. 
NHTSA and EPA’s proposed 
standards, like the standards NHTSA 
promulgated in March 2009 for model 
year 2011 (MY 2011), are expressed as 
mathematical functions depending on 
vehicle footprint. Footprint is one 
measure of vehicle size, and is 
determined by multiplying the vehicle’s 
wheelbase by the vehicle’s average track 
width.43 The standards that must be met 
by the fleet of each manufacturer would 
be determined by computing the sales- 
weighted harmonic average of the 
targets applicable to each of the 
manufacturer’s passenger cars and light 
trucks. Under these proposed footprint- 
based standards, the levels required of 
individual manufacturers depend, as 
noted above, on the mix of vehicles 
sold. NHTSA and EPA’s respective 
proposed standards are shown in the 
tables below. It is important to note that 
the standards are the attribute-based 
curves proposed by each agency. The 
values in the tables below reflect the 
agencies’ projection of the 
corresponding fleet levels that would 
result from these attribute-based curves. 
As shown in Table I.D.2–1, NHTSA’s 
proposed fleet-wide CAFE-required 
levels for passenger cars under the 
proposed standards are projected to 
increase from 33.6 to 38.0 mpg between 
MY 2012 and MY 2016. Similarly, fleet- 
wide CAFE levels for light trucks are 
projected to increase from 25.0 to 28.3 
mpg. These numbers do not include the 
effects of other flexibilities and credits 
in the program. NHTSA has also 
estimated the average fleet-wide 
required levels for the combined car and 
truck fleets. As shown, the overall fleet 
average CAFE level is expected to be 
34.1 mpg in MY 2016. These standards 
represent a 4.3 percent average annual 
rate of increase relative to the MY 2011 
standards.44

45 NHTSA’s estimates account for availability of 
CAFE credits for the sale of flexibly-fuel vehicles 
(FFVs), and for the potential that some 
manufacturers would pay civil penalties rather than 
complying with the proposed CAFE standards. This 
yields NHTSA’s estimates of the real-world fuel 
economy that could be achieved under the 
proposed CAFE standards. NHTSA has not 
included any potential impact of car-truck credit 
transfer in its estimate of the achieved CAFE levels. 
46 49 U.S.C. 32902(b)(4). 
47 In the March 2009 final rule establishing MY 
2011 standards for passenger cars and light trucks, 
NHTSA estimated that the minimum required 
CAFE standard for domestically manufactured 
passenger cars would be 27.8 mpg under the MY 
2011 passenger car standard. Based on the agency’s 
current forecast of the MY 2011 passenger car 
market, NHTSA now estimates that the minimum 
required CAFE standard will be 28.0 mpg in MY 
2011. 
48 These levels do not include the effect of 
flexible fuel credits, transfer of credits between cars 
and trucks, temporary lead time allowance, or any 
other credits with the exception of air conditioning. 
Accounting for the expectation that 
some manufacturers would continue to 
pay civil penalties rather than achieving 
required CAFE levels, and the ability to 
use FFV credits, NHTSA estimates that 
the proposed CAFE standards would 
lead to the following average achieved 
fuel economy levels, based on the 
projections of what each manufacturer’s 
fleet will comprise in each year of the 
program: 45 
TABLE I.D.2–2—PROJECTED FLEET-WIDE ACHIEVED CAFE LEVELS UNDER THE PROPOSED FOOTPRINT-BASED CAFE 
STANDARDS (MPG)

Combined Cars & Trucks ................................................................................................................ 28.7 29.6 30.4 31.6 32.7 
NHTSA is also required by EISA to set 
a minimum fuel economy standard for 
domestically manufactured passenger 
cars in addition to the attribute-based 
passenger car standard. The minimum 
standard ‘‘shall be the greater of (A) 27.5 
miles per gallon; or (B) 92 percent of the 
average fuel economy projected by the 
Secretary for the combined domestic 
and non-domestic passenger automobile 
fleets manufactured for sale in the 
United States by all manufacturers in 
the model year * * *.’’ 46 
Based on NHTSA’s current market 
forecast, the agency’s estimates of these 
minimum standards under the proposed 
MY 2012–2016 CAFE standards (and, 
for comparison, the final MY 2011 
standard) are summarized below in 
Table I.D.2–3.47 For eventual 
compliance calculations, the final 
calculated minimum standards will be 
updated to reflect any changes in the 
average fuel economy level required 
under the final standards.

EPA is proposing GHG emissions 
standards, and Table I.D.2–4 provides 
EPA’s estimates of their projected 
overall fleet-wide CO2 equivalent 
emission levels.48 The g/mi values are 
CO2 equivalent values because they 
include the projected use of A/C credits 
by manufacturers.

Combined Cars & Trucks ................................................................................................................ 295 286 276 263 250 
As shown in Table I.D.2–4, projected 
fleet-wide CO2 emission level 
requirements for cars under the 
proposed approach are projected to 
increase in stringency from 261 to 224 
grams per mile between MY 2012 and 
MY 2016. Similarly, fleet-wide CO2 
equivalent emission level requirements 
for trucks are projected to increase in 
stringency from 352 to 302 grams per 
mile. As shown, the overall fleet average 
CO2 level requirements are projected to 
be 250 g/mile in 2016. 
EPA anticipates that manufacturers 
will take advantage of program 
flexibilities such as flex fueled vehicle 
credits, and car/truck credit trading. 
Due to the credit trading between cars 
and trucks, the estimated improvements 
in CO2 emissions are distributed 
differently than shown in Table I.D 2– 
4, where full manufacturer compliance 
is assumed. Table I.D.2–5 shows EPA 
projection of the achieved emission 
levels of the fleet for MY 2012 through 
2016, which does consider the impact of 
car/truck credit transfer and the increase 
in emissions due to program flexibilities 
including flex fueled vehicle credits and 
the temporary leadtime allowance 
alternative standards. The use of 
optional air conditioning credits is 
considered both in this analysis of 
achieved levels and of the projected 
levels described above.. As can be seen 
in Table I.D.2–5, the projected achieved 
levels are slightly higher for model years 
2012–2015 due to the projected use of 
the proposed flexibilities, but in model

motor vehicles—and fuel consumption, means that

NHTSA’s and EPA’s technology 
assessment indicates there is a wide 
range of technologies available for 
manufacturers to consider in upgrading 
vehicles to reduce GHG emissions and 
improve fuel economy.49 As noted, 
these include improvements to the 
engines such as use of gasoline direct 
injection and downsized engines that 
use turbochargers to provide 
performance similar to that of larger 
engines, the use of advanced 
transmissions, increased use of start- 
stop technology, improvements in tire 
performance, reductions in vehicle 
weight, increased use of hybrid and 
other advanced technologies, and the 
initial commercialization of electric 
vehicles and plug-in hybrids. EPA is 
also projecting improvements in vehicle 
air conditioners including more efficient 
as well as low leak systems. All of these 
technologies are already available today, 
and EPA’s and NHTSA’s assessment is 
that manufacturers would be able to 
meet the proposed standards through 
more widespread use of these 
technologies across the fleet. 
With respect to the practicability of 
the standards in terms of lead time, 
during MYs 2012–2016 manufacturers 
are expected to go through the normal 
automotive business cycle of 
redesigning and upgrading their light- 
duty vehicle products, and in some 
cases introducing entirely new vehicles 
not on the market today. This proposal 
would allow manufacturers the time 
needed to incorporate technology to 
achieve GHG reductions and improve 
fuel economy during the vehicle 
redesign process. This is an important 
aspect of the proposal, as it avoids the 
much higher costs that would occur if 
manufacturers needed to add or change 
technology at times other than their 
scheduled redesigns. This time period 
would also provide manufacturers the 
opportunity to plan for compliance 
using a multi-year time frame, again 
consistent with normal business 
practice. Over these five model years, 
there would be an opportunity for 
manufacturers to evaluate almost every 
one of their vehicle model platforms 
and add technology in a cost effective 
way to control GHG emissions and 
improve fuel economy. This includes 
redesign of the air conditioner systems 
in ways that will further reduce GHG 
emissions. 
Both agencies considered other 
standards as part of the rulemaking 
analyses, both more and less stringent 
than those proposed. EPA’s and 
NHTSA’s analysis of alternative 
standards are contained in Sections III 
and IV of this notice, respectively. 
The CAFE and GHG standards 
described above are based on 
determining emissions and fuel 
economy using the city and highway 
test procedures that are currently used 
in the CAFE program. Both agencies 
recognize that these test procedures are 
not fully representative of real world 
driving conditions. For example EPA 
has adopted more representative test 
procedures that are used in determining 
compliance with emissions standards 
for pollutants other than GHGs. These 
test procedures are also used in EPA’s 
fuel economy labeling program. 
However, as discussed in Section III, the 
current information on effectiveness of 
the individual emissions control 
technologies is based on performance 
over the two CAFE test procedures. For 
that reason EPA is proposing to use the 
current CAFE test procedures for the 
proposed CO2 standards and is not 
proposing to change those test 
procedures in this rulemaking. NHTSA, 
as discussed above, is limited by statute 
in what test procedures can be used for 
purposes of passenger car testing; 
however there is no such statutory 
limitation with respect to test 
procedures for trucks. However, the 
same reasons for not changing the truck 
test procedures apply for CAFE as well. 
Both EPA and NHTSA are interested 
in developing programs that employ test 
procedures that are more representative 
of real world driving conditions, to the 
extent authorized under their respective 
statutes. This is an important issue, and 
the agencies intend to address it in the 
context of a future rulemaking to 
address standards for model year 2017 
and thereafter. This could include a 
range of test procedure changes to better 
represent real-world driving conditions 
in terms of speed, acceleration, 
deceleration, ambient temperatures, use 
of air conditioners, and the like. With 
respect to air conditioner operation, 
EPA discusses the procedures it intends 
to use for determining emissions credits 
for controls on air conditioners in 
Section III. Comment is also invited in 
Section IV on the issue of providing air 
conditioner credits under 49 U.S.C. 
32902 and/or 32904 for light-trucks in 
the model years covered by this 
proposal. 
Finally, based on the information EPA 
developed in its recent rulemaking that 
updated its fuel economy labeling 
program to better reflect average real- 
world fuel economy, the calculation of 
fuel savings and CO2 emissions 
reductions obtained by the proposed 
CAFE and GHG standards includes 
adjustments to account for the 
difference between the fuel economy 
level measured in the CAFE test 
procedure and the fuel economy 
actually achieved on average under real 
world driving conditions. These 
adjustments are industry averages for 
the vehicles’ performance as a whole, 
however, and are not a substitute for the 
information on effectiveness of 
individual control technologies that will 
be explored for purposes of a future 
GHG and CAFE rulemaking. 
3. Form of the Standards 
In this rule, NHTSA and EPA are 
proposing attribute-based standards for 
passenger cars and light trucks. NHTSA 
adopted an attribute standard based on 
vehicle footprint in its Reformed CAFE 
program for light trucks for model years 
2008–2011,50 and recently extended this 
approach to passenger cars in the CAFE 
rule for MY 2011 as required by EISA.51 
EPA and NHTSA are proposing vehicle 
footprint as the attribute for the GHG

respective models. 
and CAFE standards. Footprint is 
defined as a vehicle’s wheelbase 
multiplied by its track width—in other 
words, the area enclosed by the points 
at which the wheels meet the ground. 
The agencies believe that the footprint 
attribute is the most appropriate 
attribute on which to base the standards 
under consideration, as further 
discussed later in this notice and in 
Chapter 2 of the joint TSD. 
Under the proposed footprint-based 
standards, each manufacturer would 
have a GHG and CAFE target unique to 
its fleet, depending on the footprints of 
the vehicle models produced by that 
manufacturer. A manufacturer would 
have separate footprint-based standards 
for cars and for trucks. Generally, larger 
vehicles (i.e., vehicles with larger 
footprints) would be subject to less 
stringent standards (i.e., higher CO2 
grams/mile standards and lower CAFE 
standards) than smaller vehicles. This is 
because, generally speaking, smaller 
vehicles are more capable of achieving 
higher standards than larger vehicles. 
While a manufacturer’s fleet average 
standard could be estimated throughout 
the model year based on projected 
production volume of its vehicle fleet, 
the standard to which the manufacturer 
must comply would be based on its final 
model year production figures. A 
manufacturer’s calculation of fleet 
average emissions at the end of the 
model year would thus be based on the 
production-weighted average emissions 
of each model in its fleet. 
In designing the footprint-based 
standards, the agencies built upon the 
footprint standard curves for passenger 
cars and light trucks used in the CAFE 
rule for MY 2011.52 EPA and NHTSA 
worked together to design car and truck 
footprint curves that followed from 
logistic curves used in that rule. The 
agencies started by addressing two main 
concerns regarding the car curve. The 
first concern was that the 2011 car curve 
was relatively steep near the inflection 
point thus causing concern that small 
variations in footprint could produce 
relatively large changes in fuel economy 
targets. A curve that was directionally 
less steep would reduce the potential for 
gaming. The second issue was that the 
inflection point of the logistic curve was 
not centered on the distribution of 
vehicle footprints across the industries’ 
fleet, thus resulting in a flat (universal 
or unreformed) standard for over half 
the fleet. The proposed car curve has 
been shifted and made less steep 
compared to the car curve adopted by 
NHTSA for 2011, such that it better 
aligns the sloped region with higher 
production volume vehicle models. 
Finally, both the car and truck curves 
are defined in terms of a constrained 
linear function for fuel consumption 
and, equivalently, a piece-wise linear 
function for CO2. NHTSA and EPA 
include a full discussion of the 
development of these curves in the joint 
TSD and a summary is found in Section 
II below. In addition, a full discussion 
of the equations and coefficients that 
define the curves is included in Section 
III for the CO2 curves and Section IV for 
the mpg curves. The following figures 
illustrate the standards. First Figure 
I.D.3–1 shows the fuel economy (mpg) 
car standard curve. 
Under an attribute-based standard, 
every vehicle model has a performance 
target (fuel economy for the CAFE 
standards, and CO2 g/mile for the GHG 
emissions standards), the level of which 
depends on the vehicle’s attribute (for 
this proposal, footprint). The 
manufacturers’ fleet average 
performance is determined by the 
production-weighed 53 average (for 
CAFE, harmonic average) of those 
targets. NHTSA and EPA are proposing 
CAFE and CO2 emissions standards 
defined by constrained linear functions 
and, equivalently, piecewise linear 
functions.54 As a possible option for 
future rulemakings, the constrained 
linear form was introduced by NHTSA 
in the 2007 NPRM proposing CAFE 
standards for MY 2011–2015. 
NHTSA is proposing the attribute 
curves below for assigning a fuel 
economy level to an individual vehicle’s 
footprint value, for model years 2012 
through 2016. These mpg values would 
be production weighted to determine 
each manufacturer’s fleet average 
standard for cars and trucks. Although 
the general model of the equation is the 
same for each vehicle category and each 
year, the parameters of the equation 
differ for cars and trucks. Each 
parameter also changes on an annual 
basis, resulting in the yearly increases in 
stringency. Figure I.D.3–1 below 
illustrates the passenger car CAFE 
standard curves for model years 2012 
through 2016 while Figure I.D.3–2 
below illustrates the light truck standard 
curves for model years 2012–2016. The 
MY 2011 final standards for cars and 
trucks, which are specified by a 
constrained logistic function rather than 
a constrained linear function, are shown 
for comparison.

EPA is proposing the attribute curves 
below for assigning a CO2 level to an 
individual vehicle’s footprint value, for 
model years 2012 through 2016. These 
CO2 values would be production 
weighted to determine each 
manufacturer’s fleet average standard 
for cars and trucks. Although the 
general model of the equation is the 
same for each vehicle category and each 
year, the parameters of the equation 
differ for cars and trucks. Each 
parameter also changes on an annual 
basis, resulting in the yearly increases in 
stringency. Figure I.D.3–3 below 
illustrates the CO2 car standard curves 
for model years 2012 through 2016 
while Figure I.D.3–4 shows the CO2 
truck standard curves for Model Years 
2012–2016.

BILLING CODE 4910–59–C 
NHTSA and EPA propose to use the 
same vehicle category definitions for 
determining which vehicles are subject 
to the car footprint curves versus the 
truck curve standards. In other words, a 
vehicle classified as a car under the 
NHTSA CAFE program would also be 
classified as a car under the EPA GHG 
program, and likewise for trucks. EPA 
and NHTSA are proposing to employ 
the same car and truck definitions for 
the MY 2012–2016 CAFE and GHG 
standards as those used in the CAFE 
program for the 2011 model year 
standards.55 This proposed approach of 
using CAFE definitions allows EPA’s

56 NHTSA’s analysis estimates multi-year 
planning effects within a context in which each 
model year is represented explicitly, and 
technologies applied in one model year carry 
forward to future model years. NHTSA does not 
currently have a basis to estimate how a 
manufacturer might, for example, weigh the transfer 
of credits from the passenger car to the light truck 
fleet in MY 2013 against the potential to carry light 
truck technologies forward from MY 2013 through 
MY 2016. The agency is considering the possibility 
of implementing such analysis for purposes of the 
final rule. 
proposed CO2 standards and the 
proposed CAFE standards to be 
harmonized across all vehicles. EPA is 
not changing the car/truck definition for 
the purposes of any other previous rule. 
Generally speaking, a smaller 
footprint vehicle will have lower CO2 
emissions relative to a larger footprint 
vehicle. A footprint-based CO2 standard 
can be relatively neutral with respect to 
vehicle size and consumer choice. All 
vehicles, whether smaller or larger, 
must make improvements to reduce CO2 
emissions, and therefore all vehicles 
will be relatively more expensive. With 
the footprint-based standard approach, 
EPA and NHTSA believe there should 
be no significant effect on the relative 
distribution of different vehicle sizes in 
the fleet, which means that consumers 
will still be able to purchase the size of 
vehicle that meets their needs. Table 
I.D.3–1 illustrates the fact that different 
vehicle sizes will have varying CO2 
emissions and fuel economy targets 
under the proposed standards.

E. Summary of Costs and Benefits for 
the Joint Proposal 
This section summarizes the projected 
costs and benefits of the proposed CAFE 
and GHG emissions standards. These 
projections helped inform the agencies’ 
choices among the alternatives 
considered and provide further 
confirmation that proposed standards 
fall within the spectrum of choices 
allowable under their respective 
statutory criteria. The costs and benefits 
projected by NHTSA to result from 
NHTSA’s proposed CAFE standards are 
presented first, followed by those from 
EPA’s analysis of the proposed GHG 
emissions standards. 
The agencies recognize that there are 
uncertainties regarding the benefit and 
cost values presented in this proposal. 
Some benefits and costs are not 
quantified. The values of other benefits 
and costs could be too low or too high. 
For several reasons, the estimates for 
costs and benefits presented by NHTSA 
and EPA, while consistent, are not 
directly comparable, and thus should 
not be expected to be identical. Most 
important, NHTSA and EPA’s proposed 
standards would require slightly 
different fuel efficiency improvements. 
EPA’s proposed GHG standard is more 
stringent in part due to its assumptions 
about manufacturers’ use of air 
conditioning credits, which result from 
reductions in air conditioning-related 
emissions of HFCs and CO2. In addition, 
the proposed CAFE and GHG standards 
offer different program flexibilities, and 
the agencies’ analyses differ in their 
accounting for these flexibilities (for 
example, FFVs etc.), primarily because 
NHTSA is statutorily prohibited from 
considering some flexibilities when 
establishing CAFE standards, while EPA 
is not. These differences contribute to 
differences in the agencies’ respective 
estimates of costs and benefits resulting 
from the new standards. 
Because EPCA prohibits NHTSA from 
considering the use of FFV credits when 
establishing CAFE standards, the 
agency’s primary analysis of costs, fuel 
savings, and related benefits from 
imposing higher CAFE standards does 
not include them. However, EPCA does 
not prohibit NHTSA from considering 
the fact that manufacturers may pay 
civil penalties rather than complying 
with CAFE standards, and NHTSA’s 
primary analysis accounts for some 
manufacturers’ tendency to do so. In 
addition, NHTSA performed a 
supplemental analysis of the effect of 
FFV credits on benefits and costs from 
its proposed CAFE standards, to 
demonstrate the real-world impacts of 
FFVs, and the summary estimates 
presented in Section IV include these 
effects. Including the use of FFV credits 
reduces estimated per-vehicle 
compliance costs of the program. 
However, as shown below, including 
FFV credits does not significantly 
change the projected fuel savings and 
CO2 reductions, because FFV credits 
reduce the fuel economy levels that 
manufacturers achieve not only under 
the proposed standards, but also under 
the baseline MY 2011 CAFE standards. 
Also, EPCA, as amended by EISA, 
allows manufacturers to transfer credits 
between their passenger car and light 
truck fleets. However, EPCA also 
prohibits NHTSA from considering 
manufacturers’ ability to use CAFE 
credits when determining the stringency 
of the CAFE standards. Because of this 
prohibition, NHTSA’s primary analysis 
does not account for the extent to which 
credit transfers might actually occur. 
For purposes of its supplemental 
analysis, NHTSA considered accounting 
for the fact that EPCA allows some 
transfer of CAFE credits between the 
passenger car and light truck fleets, but 
determined that in NHTSA’s year-by- 
year analysis, manufacturers’ likely 
credit transfers cannot be reasonably 
estimated at this time.56 
Therefore, NHTSA’s primary analysis 
shows the estimates the agency 
considered for purposes of establishing 
new CAFE standards, and its 
supplemental analysis including 
manufacturers’ potential use of FFV 
credits currently reflects the agency’s 
best estimate of the potential real-world 
effects of the proposed CAFE standards.

57 We have developed two interim estimates of 
the global social cost of carbon (SCC) ($/tCO2 in 
2007 (2006$)): $33 per tCO2 at a 3% discount rate, 
and $5 per tCO2 with a 5% discount rate. The 3% 
and 5% estimates have independent appeal and at 
this time a clear preference for one over the other 
is not warranted. Thus, we have also included—and 
centered our current attention on—the average of 
the estimates associated with these discount rates, 
which is $19 (in 2006$) per ton of CO2 emissions. 
When converted to 2007$ for consistency with 
other economic values used in the agency’s 
analysis, this figure corresponds to $20 per metric 
ton of CO2 emissions occurring in 2007. This value 
is assumed to increase at 3% annually for emissions 
occurring after 2007. 
58 The $10 and $56 figures are alternative interim 
estimates based on uncertainty about interest rates 
of long periods of time. They are based on an 
approach that models discount rate uncertainty as 
something that evolves over time; in contrast, the 
preferred approach mentioned in the immediately 
preceding paragraph assumes that there is a single 
discount rate with equal probability of 3% and 5%. 
EPA made explicit assumptions about 
manufacturers’ use of FFV credits under 
both the baseline and control 
alternatives, and its estimates of costs 
and benefits from the proposed GHG 
standards reflect these assumptions. 
However, under the proposed GHG 
standards, FFV credits would be 
available through MY 2015; starting in 
MY 2016, EPA proposes to allow FFV 
credits only based on a manfucturers’s 
demonstration that the alternative fuel 
is actually being used in the vehicles 
and the actual GHG performance for the 
vehicle run on that alternative fuel. 
EPA’s analysis also assumes that 
manufacturers would transfer credits 
between their car and truck fleets in the 
MY 2011 baseline subject to the 
maximum value allowed by EPCA, and 
that unlimited car-truck credit transfers 
would occur under the proposed GHG 
standards. Including these assumptions 
in EPA’s analysis increases the resulting 
estimates of fuel savings and reductions 
in GHG emissions, while reducing 
EPA’s estimates of program compliance 
costs. 
Finally, under the proposed EPA GHG 
program, there is no ability for a 
manufacturer to intentionally pay fines 
in lieu of meeting the standard. Under 
EPCA, however, vehicle manufacturers 
are allowed to pay fines as an 
alternative to compliance with 
applicable CAFE standards. NHTSA’s 
analysis explicitly estimates the level of 
voluntary fine payment by individual 
manufacturers, which reduces NHTSA’s 
estimates of both the costs and benefits 
of its proposed CAFE standards. In 
contrast, the CAA does not allow for 
fine payment in lieu of compliance with 
emission standards, and EPA’s analysis 
of costs and benefits from its proposed 
standard thus assumes full compliance. 
This assumption results in higher 
estimates of fuel savings, reductions in 
GHG emissions, and manufacturers’ 
compliance costs to sell fleets that 
comply with both NHTSA’s proposed 
CAFE program and EPA’s proposed 
GHG program. 
In summary, the projected costs and 
benefits presented by NHTSA and EPA 
are not directly comparable, because the 
levels being proposed by EPA include 
air conditioning-related improvements 
in equivalent fuel efficiency and HFC 
reductions, because the assumptions 
incorporated in EPA’s analysis 
regarding car-truck credit transfers, and 
because of the projection by EPA of 
complete compliance with the proposed 
GHG standards. It should also be 
expected that overall EPA’s estimates of 
GHG reductions and fuel savings 
achieved by the proposed GHG 
standards will be slightly higher than 
those projected by NHTSA only for the 
CAFE standards because of the reasons 
described above. For the same reasons, 
EPA’s estimates of manufacturers’ costs 
for complying with the proposed 
passenger car and light trucks GHG 
standards are slightly higher than 
NHTSA’s estimates for complying with 
the proposed CAFE standards. 
1. Summary of Costs and Benefits of 
Proposed NHTSA CAFE Standards 
Without accounting for the 
compliance flexibilities that NHTSA is 
prohibited from considering when 
determining the level of new CAFE 
standards, since manufacturers’ 
decisions to use those flexibilities are 
voluntary, NHTSA estimates that these 
fuel economy increases would lead to 
fuel savings totaling 62 billion gallons 
throughout the useful lives of vehicles 
sold in MYs 2012–2016. At a 3% 
discount rate, the present value of the 
economic benefits resulting from those 
fuel savings is $158 billion. 
The agency further estimates that 
these new CAFE standards would lead 
to corresponding reductions in CO2 
emissions totaling 656 million metric 
tons (mmt) during the useful lives of 
vehicles sold in MYs 2012–2016. The 
present value of the economic benefits 
from avoiding those emissions is $16.4 
billion, based on a global social cost of 
carbon value of $20 per metric ton,57 
although NHTSA estimated the benefits 
associated with five different values of 
a one ton GHG reduction ($5, $10, $20, 
$34, $56).58 See Section II for a more 
detailed discussion of the social cost of 
carbon. It is important to note that 
NHTSA’s CAFE standards and EPA’s 
GHG standards will both be in effect, 
and each will lead to increases in 
average fuel economy and CO2 
emissions reductions. The two agencies’ 
standards together comprise the 
National Program, and this discussion of 
costs and benefits of NHTSA’s CAFE 
standards does not change the fact that 
both the CAFE and GHG standards, 
jointly, are the source of the benefits 
and costs of the National Program.

Considering manufacturers’ ability to 
earn credit toward compliance by 
selling FFVs, NHTSA estimates very 
little change in incremental fuel savings 
and avoided CO2 emissions, assuming 
FFV credits would be used toward both 
the baseline and proposed standards:

NHTSA estimates that these fuel 
economy increases would produce other 
benefits both to drivers (e.g., reduced 
time spent refueling) and to the U.S. 
(e.g., reductions in the costs of 
petroleum imports beyond the direct 
savings from reduced oil purchases, as 
well as some disbenefits (e.g., increase 
traffic congestion) caused by drivers’ 
tendency to travel more when the cost 
of driving declines (as it does when fuel 
economy increases). NHTSA has 
estimated the total monetary value to 
society of these benefits and disbenefits, 
and estimates that the proposed 
standards will produce significant net 
benefits to society. Using a 3% discount 
rate, NHTSA estimates that the present 
value of these benefits would total more 
than $200 billion over the useful lives 
of vehicles sold during MYs 2012–2016. 
More discussion regarding monetized 
benefits can be found in Section IV of 
this notice and in NHTSA’s Regulatory 
Impact Analysis.

this proposed rule presents a detailed analysis of specific benefits of the 
proposed rule.

NHTSA estimates that the increases in 
technology application necessary to 
achieve the projected improvements in 
fuel economy will entail considerable 
monetary outlays. The agency estimates 
that incremental costs for achieving its 
proposed standards—that is, outlays by 
vehicle manufacturers over and above 
those required to comply with the MY 
2011 CAFE standards—will total about 
$60 billion (i.e., during MYs 2012– 
2016).

Combined ......................................................................................................................... 5.7 9.3 12.5 15.1 17.6 60.2 
NHTSA estimates that use of FFV 
credits could significantly reduce these 
outlays:

FFV CREDITS)

Combined ......................................................................................................................... 3.7 6.3 9.2 11.7 14.2 45.2 
The agency projects that 
manufacturers will recover most or all 
of these additional costs through higher 
selling prices for new cars and light 
trucks. To allow manufacturers to 
recover these increased outlays (and, to 
a much lesser extent, the civil penalties 
that some companies are expected to 
pay for noncompliance), the agency 
estimates that the proposed standards 
would lead to increases in average new 
vehicle prices ranging from $476 per 
vehicle in MY 2012 to $1,091 per 
vehicle in MY 2016:

Combined ......................................................................................................................................... 476 635 806 945 1,091 
NHTSA estimates that use of FFV

costs, especially in earlier model years:

NHTSA estimates, therefore, that the 
total benefits of these proposed 
standards would be more than three 
times the magnitude of the 
corresponding costs. As a consequence, 
its proposed standards would produce 
net benefits of $142 billion at a 3 
percent discount rate (with FFV credits, 
$147 billion) or $100 billion at a 7 
percent discount rate over the useful 
lives of vehicles sold during MYs 2012– 
2016. 
2. Summary of Costs and Benefits of 
Proposed EPA GHG Standards 
EPA has conducted a preliminary 
assessment of the costs and benefits of 
the proposed GHG standards. Table 
I.E.2–1 shows EPA’s estimated lifetime 
fuel savings and CO2 equivalent 
emission reductions for all vehicles sold 
in the model years 2012–2016. The 
values in Table I.E.2–1 are projected 
lifetime totals for each model year and 
are not discounted. As documented in 
DRIA Chapter 5, the potential credit 
transfer between cars and trucks may 
change the distribution of the fuel 
savings and GHG emission impacts 
between cars and trucks. As discussed 
above with respect to NHTSA’s CAFE 
standards, it is important to note that 
NHTSA’s CAFE standards and EPA’s 
GHG standards will both be in effect, 
and each will lead to increases in 
average fuel economy and CO2 
emissions reductions. The two agency’s 
standards together comprise the 
National Program, and this discussion of 
costs and benefits of EPA’s GHG 
standards does not change the fact that 
both the CAFE and GHG standards, 
jointly, are the source of the benefits 
and costs of the National Program.

Table I.E.2–2 shows EPA’s estimated 
lifetime discounted benefits for all 
vehicles sold in model years 2012–2016. 
Although EPA estimated the benefits 
associated with five different values of 
a one ton GHG reduction ($5, $10, $20, 
$34, $56), for the purposes of this 
overview presentation of estimated 
benefits EPA is showing the benefits 
associated with one of these marginal 
values, $20 per ton of CO2, in 2007 
dollars and 2007 emissions, in this joint 
proposal. Table I.E.2–2 presents benefits 
based on the $20 value. Section III.H 
presents the five marginal values used 
to estimate monetized benefits of GHG 
reductions and Section III.H presents 
the program benefits using each of the 
five marginal values, which represent 
only a partial accounting of total 
benefits due to omitted climate change 
impacts and other factors that are not 
readily monetized. These factors are 
being used on an interim basis while 
analysis is conducted to generate new 
estimates. The values in the table are 
discounted values for each model year 
throughout their projected lifetimes. 
The benefits include all benefits 
considered by EPA such as fuel savings, 
GHG reductions, PM benefits, energy 
security and other externalities such as 
reduced refueling and accidents, 
congestion and noise. The lifetime 
discounted benefits are shown for one of 
five different social cost of carbon (SCC) 
values considered by EPA. The values 
in Table I.E.2–2 do not include costs 
associated with new technology 
required to meet the proposal.

Table I.E.2–3 shows EPA’s estimated 
lifetime fuel savings, lifetime CO2 
emission reductions, and the monetized 
net present values of those fuel savings 
and CO2 emission reductions. The 
gallons of fuel and CO2 emission

for all vehicles sold in the model years 
2012–2016. The estimated fuel savings 
in billions of barrels and the GHG 
reductions in million metric tons of CO2 
shown in Table I.E.2–3 are totals for the 
five model years throughout their 
projected lifetime and are not 
discounted. The monetized values 
shown in Table I.E.2–3 are the summed 
values of the discounted monetized-fuel 
savings and monetized-CO2 reductions 
for the five model years 2012–2016 
throughout their lifetimes. The 
monetized values in Table I.E.2–3 
reflect both a 3 percent and a 7 percent 
discount rate as noted.

F. Program Flexibilities for Achieving 
Compliance 
EPA’s and NHTSA’s proposed 
programs provide compliance flexibility 
to manufacturers, especially in the early 
years of the National Program. This 
flexibility is expected to provide 
sufficient lead time for manufacturers to 
make necessary technological 
improvements and reduce the overall 
cost of the program, without 
compromising overall environmental 
and fuel economy objectives. The broad 
goal of harmonizing the two agencies’ 
proposed standards includes preserving 
manufacturers’ flexibilities in meeting 
the standards, to the extent appropriate 
and required by law. The following 
section provides an overview of the 
flexibility provisions the agencies are 
proposing. 
1. CO2/CAFE Credits Generated Based 
on Fleet Average Performance 
Under the NHTSA and EPA proposal 
the fleet average standards that apply to 
a manufacturer’s car and truck fleets 
would be based on the applicable 
footprint-based curves. At the end of 
each model year, when production of 
the model year is complete, a 
production-weighted fleet average 
would be calculated for each averaging 
set (cars and trucks). Under this 
approach, a manufacturer’s car and/or 
truck fleet that achieves a fleet average 
CO2/CAFE level better than the standard 
would generate credits. Conversely, if 
the fleet average CO2/CAFE level does 
not meet the standard the fleet would 
generate debits (also referred to as a 
shortfall). 
Under the proposed program, a 
manufacturer whose fleet generates 
credits in a given model year would 
have several options for using those 
credits, including credit carry-back, 
credit carry-forward, credit transfers,

60 49 U.S.C. 32903(g)(4). 
61 49 U.S.C. 32903(f)(2). 
62 EPCA provides a statutory incentive for 
production of FFVs by specifying that their fuel 
economy is determined using a special calculation 
procedure that results in those vehicles being 
assigned a higher fuel economy level than would 
otherwise occur. This is typically referred to as an 
FFV credit. 
63 Id. 
and credit trading. These provisions 
exist in the MY 2011 CAFE program 
under EPCA and EISA, and similar 
provisions are part of EPA’s Tier 2 
program for light duty vehicle criteria 
pollutant emissions, as well as many 
other mobile source standards issued by 
EPA under the CAA. EPA is proposing 
that the manufacturer would be able to 
carry-back credits to offset any deficit 
that had accrued in a prior model year 
and was subsequently carried over to 
the current model year. EPCA already 
provides for this. EPCA restricts the 
carry-back of CAFE credits to three 
years and EPA is proposing the same 
limitation, in keeping with the goal of 
harmonizing both sets of proposed 
standards. 
After satisfying any need to offset pre- 
existing deficits, remaining credits 
could be saved (banked) for use in 
future years. Under the CAFE program, 
EISA allows manufacturers to apply 
credits earned in a model year to 
compliance in any of the five 
subsequent model years.59 EPA is also 
proposing, under the GHG program, to 
allow manufacturers to use these 
banked credits in the five years after the 
year in which they were generated (i.e., 
five years carry-forward). 
EISA required NHTSA to establish by 
regulation a CAFE credits transferring 
program, which NHTSA established in 
a March 2009 final rule codified at 49 
CFR part 536, to allow a manufacturer 
to transfer credits between its vehicle 
fleets to achieve compliance with the 
standards. For example, credits earned 
by over-compliance with a 
manufacturer’s car fleet average 
standard could be used to offset debits 
incurred due to that manufacturer’s not 
meeting the truck fleet average standard 
in a given year. EPA’s Tier 2 program 
also provides for this type of credit 
transfer. For purposes of this NPRM, 
EPA proposes unlimited credit transfers 
across a manufacturer’s car-truck fleet to 
meet the GHG standard. This is based 
on the expectation that this kind of 
credit transfer provision will allow the 
required GHG emissions reductions to 
be achieved in the most cost effective 
way, and this flexibility will facilitate 
the ability of the manufacturers to 
comply with the GHG standards in the 
lead time provided. Under the CAA, 
unlike under EISA, there is no statutory 
limitation on car-truck credit transfers. 
Therefore EPA is not proposing to 
constrain car-truck credit transfers as 
doing so would increase costs with no 
corresponding environmental benefit. 
For the CAFE program, however, EISA 
limits the amount of credits that may be 
transferred, and also prohibits the use of 
transferred credits to meet the statutory 
minimum level for the domestic car 
fleet standard.60 These and other 
statutory limits would continue to apply 
to the determination of compliance with 
the CAFE standard. 
Finally, EISA also allowed NHTSA to 
establish by regulation a CAFE credit 
trading program, which NHTSA 
established in the March 2009 final rule 
at 40 CFR Part 536, to allow credits to 
be traded (sold) to other vehicle 
manufacturers. EPA is also proposing to 
allow credit trading in the GHG 
program. These sorts of exchanges are 
typically allowed under EPA’s current 
mobile source emission credit programs, 
although manufacturers have seldom 
made such exchanges. Under the 
NHTSA CAFE program, EPCA also 
allows these types of credit trades, 
although, as with transferred credits, 
traded credits may not be used to meet 
the minimum domestic car standards 
specified by statute.61 
2. Air Conditioning Credits 
Air conditioning (A/C) systems 
contribute to GHG emissions in two 
ways. Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 
refrigerants, which are powerful GHG 
pollutants, can leak from the A/C 
system. Operation of the A/C system 
also places an additional load on the 
engine, which results in additional CO2 
tailpipe emissions. EPA is proposing an 
approach that allows manufacturers to 
generate credits by reducing GHG 
emissions related to A/C systems. 
Specifically, EPA is proposing a test 
procedure and method to calculate CO2 
equivalent reductions for the full useful 
life on a grams/mile basis that can be 
used as credits in meeting the fleet 
average CO2 standards. EPA’s analysis 
indicates this approach provides 
manufacturers with a highly cost- 
effective way to achieve a portion of 
GHG emissions reductions under the 
EPA program. EPA is estimating that 
manufacturers will on average take 
advantage of 11 g/mi GHG credit toward 
meeting the 250 g/mi by 2016 (though 
some companies may have more). EPA 
is also proposing to allow manufacturers 
to earn early A/C credits starting in MY 
2009 through 2011, as discussed further 
in a later section. 
Comment is also sought on the 
approach of providing CAFE credits 
under 49 U.S.C. 32904(c) for light trucks 
equipped with relatively efficient air 
conditioners for MYs 2012–2016. The 
agencies invite comment on allowing a 
manufacturer to generate additional 
CAFE credits from the reduction of fuel 
consumption through the application of 
air conditioning efficiency improvement 
technologies to trucks. Currently, the 
CAFE program does not induce 
manufacturers to install more efficient 
air conditioners because the air 
conditioners are not turned on during 
fuel economy testing. The agencies note 
that if such credits were adopted, it may 
be necessary to reflect them in the 
setting of the CAFE standards for light 
trucks for the same model years and 
invite comment on that issue. 
3. Flex-Fuel and Alternative Fuel 
Vehicle Credits 
EPCA authorizes an incentive under 
the CAFE program for production of 
dual-fueled or flexible-fuel vehicles 
(FFV) and dedicated alternative fuel 
vehicles. FFVs are vehicles that can run 
both on an alternative fuel and 
conventional fuel. Most FFVs are E–85 
capable vehicles, which can run on 
either gasoline or a mixture of up to 85 
percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. 
Dedicated alternative fuel vehicles are 
vehicles that run exclusively on an 
alternative fuel. EPCA was amended by 
EISA to extend the period of availability 
of the FFV incentive, but to begin 
phasing it out by annually reducing the 
amount of FFV incentive that can be 
used toward compliance with the CAFE 
standards.62 EPCA does not premise the 
availability of the FFV credits on actual 
use of alternative fuel by an FFV 
vehicle. Under NHTSA’s CAFE 
program, pursuant to EISA, after MY 
2019, no FFV credits will be available 
for CAFE compliance.63 For dedicated 
alternative fuel vehicles, there are no 
limits or phase-out of the credits. 
Consistent with the statute, NHTSA will 
continue to allow the use of FFV credits 
for purposes of compliance with the 
proposed standards until the end of the 
phase-out period. 
For the GHG program, EPA is 
proposing to allow FFV credits in line 
with EISA limits only during the period 
from MYs 2012 to 2015. After MY 2015, 
EPA proposes to allow FFV credits only 
based on a manufacturer’s 
demonstration that the alternative fuel 
is actually being used in the vehicles. 
EPA is seeking comments on how that 
demonstration could be made. EPA 
discusses this in more detail in Section 
III.C of the preamble.

64 EPCA does not permit such an allowance. 
Consequently, manufacturers who may be able to 
take advantage of a lead-time allowance under the 
proposed GHG standards would be required to 
comply with the applicable CAFE standard or be 
subject to penalties for non-compliance. 
4. Temporary Lead-Time Allowance 
Alternative Standards 
Manufacturers with limited product 
lines may be especially challenged in 
the early years of the proposed program. 
Manufacturers with narrow product 
offerings may not be able to take full 
advantage of averaging or other program 
flexibilities due to the limited scope of 
the types of vehicles they sell. For 
example, some smaller volume 
manufacturers focus on high 
performance vehicles with higher CO2 
emissions, above the CO2 emissions 
target for that vehicle footprint, but do 
not have other types of vehicles in their 
production mix with which to average. 
Often, these manufacturers pay fines 
under the CAFE program rather than 
meeting the applicable CAFE standard. 
EPA believes that these technological 
circumstances may call for a more 
gradual phase-in of standards so that 
manufacturer resources can be focused 
on meeting the 2016 levels. 
EPA is proposing a temporary lead- 
time allowance for manufacturers who 
sell vehicles in the U.S. in MY 2009 
whose vehicle sales in that model year 
are below 400,000 vehicles. EPA 
proposes that this allowance would be 
available only during the MY 2012– 
2015 phase-in years of the program. A 
manufacturer that satisfies the threshold 
criteria would be able to treat a limited 
number of vehicles as a separate 
averaging fleet, which would be subject 
to a less stringent GHG standard.64 
Specifically, a standard of 125 percent 
of the vehicle’s otherwise applicable 
foot-print target level would apply to up 
to 100,000 vehicles total, spread over 
the four year period of MY 2012 through 
2015. Thus, the number of vehicles to 
which the flexibility could apply is 
limited. EPA also is proposing 
appropriate restrictions on credit use for 
these vehicles, as discussed further in 
Section III. By MY 2016, these 
allowance vehicles must be averaged 
into the manufacturer’s full fleet (i.e., 
they are no longer eligible for a different 
standard). EPA discusses this in more 
detail in Section III.B of the preamble. 
5. Additional Credit Opportunities 
Under the CAA 
EPA is proposing additional 
opportunities for early credits in MYs 
2009–2011 through over-compliance 
with a baseline standard. The baseline 
standard would be set to be equivalent, 
on a national level, to the California 
standards. Potentially, credits could be 
generated by over-compliance with this 
baseline in one of two ways—over- 
compliance by the fleet of vehicles sold 
in California and the CAA section 177 
States (i.e., those States adopting the 
California program), or over-compliance 
with the fleet of vehicles sold in the 50 
States. EPA is also proposing early 
credits based on over-compliance with 
CAFE, but only for vehicles sold in 
States outside of California and the CAA 
section 177 States. Under the proposed 
early credit provisions, no early FFV 
credits would be allowed, except those 
achieved by over-compliance with the 
California program based on California’s 
provisions that manufacturers 
demonstrate actual use of the alternative 
fuel. EPA’s proposed early credits 
options are designed to ensure that there 
would be no double counting of early 
credits. Consistent with this paragraph, 
NHTSA notes, however, that credits for 
overcompliance with CAFE standards 
during MYs 2009–2011 will still be 
available for manufacturers to use 
toward compliance in future model 
years, just as before. 
EPA is proposing additional credit 
opportunities to encourage the 
commercialization of advanced GHG/ 
fuel economy control technologies, such 
as electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid 
electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. 
These proposed advanced technology 
credits are in the form of a multiplier 
that would be applied to the number of 
vehicles sold, such that each eligible 
vehicle counts as more than one vehicle 
in the manufacturer’s fleet average. EPA 
is also proposing to allow early 
advanced technology credits to be 
generated beginning in MYs 2009 
through 2011. 
EPA is also proposing an Option for 
manufacturers to generate credits for 
employing technologies that achieve 
GHG reductions that are not reflected on 
current test procedures. Examples of 
such ‘‘off-cycle’’ technologies might 
include solar panels on hybrids, 
adaptive cruise control, and active 
aerodynamics, among other 
technologies. EPA is seeking comments 
on the best ways to quantify such 
credits to ensure any off-cycle credits 
applied for by a manufacturer are 
verifiable, reflect real-world reductions, 
based on repeatable test procedures, and 
are developed through a transparent 
process allowing appropriate 
opportunities for public comment. 
G. Coordinated Compliance 
Previous NHTSA and EPA regulations 
and statutory provisions establish ample 
examples on which to develop an 
effective compliance program that 
achieves the energy and environmental 
benefits from CAFE and motor vehicle 
GHG standards. NHTSA and EPA are 
proposing a program that recognizes, 
and replicates as closely as possible, the 
compliance protocols associated with 
the existing CAA Tier 2 vehicle 
emission standards, and with CAFE 
standards. The certification, testing, 
reporting, and associated compliance 
activities closely track current practices 
and are thus familiar to manufacturers. 
EPA already oversees testing, collects 
and processes test data, and performs 
calculations to determine compliance 
with both CAFE and CAA standards. 
Under this proposed coordinated 
approach, the compliance mechanisms 
for both programs are consistent and 
non-duplicative. EPA will also apply 
the CAA authorities applicable to its 
separate in-use requirements in this 
program. 
The proposed approach allows 
manufacturers to satisfy the new 
program requirements in the same 
general way they comply with existing 
applicable CAA and CAFE 
requirements. Manufacturers would 
demonstrate compliance on a fleet- 
average basis at the end of each model 
year, allowing model-level testing to 
continue throughout the year as is the 
current practice for CAFE 
determinations. The proposed 
compliance program design establishes 
a single set of manufacturer reporting 
requirements and relies on a single set 
of underlying data. This approach still 
allows each agency to assess compliance 
with its respective program under its 
respective statutory authority. 
NHTSA and EPA do not anticipate 
any significant noncompliance under 
the proposed program. However, failure 
to meet the fleet average standards (after 
credit opportunities are exhausted) 
would ultimately result in the potential 
for penalties under both EPCA and the 
CAA. The CAA allows EPA 
considerable discretion in assessment of 
penalties. Penalties under the CAA are 
typically determined on a vehicle- 
specific basis by determining the 
number of a manufacturer’s highest 
emitting vehicles that caused the fleet 
average standard violation. This is the 
same mechanism used for EPA’s 
National Low Emission Vehicle and Tier 
2 corporate average standards, and to 
date there have been no instances of 
noncompliance. CAFE penalties are 
specified by EPCA and would be 
assessed for the entire noncomplying 
fleet at a rate of $5.50 times the number

the event of a compliance action arising 
out of the same facts and circumstances, 
EPA could consider CAFE penalties 
when determining appropriate remedies 
for the EPA case. 
H. Conclusion 
This joint proposal by NHTSA and 
EPA represents a strong and coordinated 
National Program to achieve greenhouse 
gas emission reductions and fuel 
economy improvements from the light- 
duty vehicle part of the transportation 
sector. EPA’s proposal for GHG 
standards under the Clean Air Act is 
discussed in Section III of this notice; 
NHTSA’s proposal for CAFE standards 
under EPCA is discussed in Section IV. 
Each agency includes analyses on a 
variety of relevant issues under its 
respective statute, such as feasibility of 
the proposed standards, costs and 
benefits of the proposal, and effects on 
the economy, auto manufacturers, and 
consumers. This joint rulemaking 
proposal reflects a carefully coordinated 
and harmonized approach to developing 
and implementing standards under the 
two agencies’ statutes and is in 
accordance with all substantive and 
procedural requirements required by 
law. 
NHTSA and EPA believe that the MY 
2012 through 2016 standards proposed 
would provide substantial reductions in 
emissions of GHGs and oil 
consumption, with significant fuel 
savings for consumers. The proposed 
program is technologically feasible at a 
reasonable cost, based on deployment of 
available and effective control 
technology across the fleet, and industry 
would have the opportunity to plan over 
several model years and incorporate the 
vehicle upgrades into the normal 
redesign cycles. The proposed program 
would result in enormous societal net 
benefits, including greenhouse gas 
emission reductions, fuel economy 
savings, improved energy security, and 
cost savings to consumers from reduced 
fuel utilization. 
II. Joint Technical Work Completed for 
This Proposal 
A. Introduction 
In this section NHTSA and EPA 
discuss several aspects of the joint 
technical analyses the two agencies 
collaborated on which are common to 
the development of each agency’s 
proposed standards. Specifically we 
discuss: The development of the 
baseline vehicle market forecast used by 
each agency, the development of the 
proposed attribute-based standard curve 
shapes, how the relative stringency 
between the car and truck fleet 
standards for this proposal was 
determined, which technologies the 
agencies evaluated and their costs and 
effectiveness, and which economic 
assumptions the agencies included in 
their analyses. The joint Technical 
Support Document (TSD) discusses the 
agencies’ joint technical work in more 
detail. 
B. How Did NHTSA and EPA Develop 
the Baseline Market Forecast? 
1. Why Do the Agencies Establish a 
Baseline Vehicle Fleet? 
In order to calculate the impacts of 
the EPA and NHTSA proposed 
regulations, it is necessary to estimate 
the composition of the future vehicle 
fleet absent these proposed regulations 
in order to conduct comparisons. EPA 
and NHTSA have developed a 
comparison fleet in two parts. The first 
step was to develop a baseline fleet 
based on model year 2008 data. The 
second step was to project that fleet into 
2011–2016. This is called the reference 
fleet. The third step was to modify that 
2011–2016 reference fleet such that it 
had sufficient technologies to meet the 
2011 CAFE standards. This final 
‘‘reference fleet’’ is the light duty fleet 
estimated to exist in 2012–2016 if these 
proposed rules are not adopted. Each 
agency developed a final reference fleet 
to use in its modeling. All of the 
agencies’ estimates of emission 
reductions, fuel economy 
improvements, costs, and societal 
impacts are developed in relation to the 
respective reference fleets. 
2. How Do the Agencies Develop the 
Baseline Vehicle Fleet? 
EPA and NHTSA have based the 
projection of total car and total light 
truck sales on recent projections made 
by the Energy Information 
Administration (EIA). EIA publishes a 
long-term projection of national energy 
use annually called the Annual Energy 
Outlook. This projection utilizes a 
number of technical and econometric 
models which are designed to reflect 
both economic and regulatory 
conditions expected to exist in the 
future. In support of its projection of 
fuel use by light-duty vehicles, EIA 
projects sales of new cars and light 
trucks. Due to the state of flux of both 
energy prices and the economy, EIA 
published three versions of its 2009 
Annual Energy Outlook. The 
Preliminary 2009 report was published 
early (in November 2008) in order to 
reflect the dramatic increase in fuel 
prices which occurred during 2008 and 
which occurred after the development 
of the 2008 Annual Energy Outlook. The 
official 2009 report was published in 
March of 2009. A third 2009 report was 
published a month later which reflected 
the economic stimulus package passed 
by Congress earlier this year. We use the 
sales projections of this latest report, 
referred to as the updated 2009 Annual 
Energy Outlook, here. 
In their updated 2009 report, EIA 
projects that total light-duty vehicle 
sales will gradually recover from their 
currently depressed levels by roughly 
2013. In 2016, car and light truck sales 
are projected to be 9.5 and 7.1 million 
units, respectively. While the total level 
of sales of 16.6 million units is similar 
to pre-2008 levels, the fraction of car 
sales is higher than that existing in the 
2000–2007 timeframe. This presumably 
reflects the impact of higher fuel prices 
and that fact that cars tend to have 
higher levels of fuel economy than 
trucks. We note that EIA’s definition of 
cars and trucks follows that used by 
NHTSA prior to the MY 2011 CAFE 
final rule published earlier this year. 
That recent CAFE rule, which 
established the MY 2011 standards, 
reclassified a number of 2-wheel drive 
sport utility vehicles from the truck fleet 
to the car fleet. This has the impact of 
shifting a considerable number of 
previously defined trucks into the car 
category. Sales projections of cars and 
trucks for all future model years can be 
found in the draft Joint TSD for this 
proposal. 
In addition to a shift towards more car 
sales, sales of segments within both the 
car and truck markets have also been 
changing and are expected to continue 
to change in the future. Manufacturers 
are introducing more crossover models 
which offer much of the utility of SUVs 
but using more car-like designs. In order 
to reflect these changes in fleet makeup, 
EPA and NHTSA considered several 
available forecasts. After review EPA 
purchased and shared with NHTSA 
forecasts from two well-known industry 
analysts, CSM–Worldwide (CSM), and 
J.D. Powers. NHTSA and EPA decided 
to use the forecast from CSM, for several 
reasons. One, CSM agreed to allow us to 
publish the data, on which our forecast 
is based, in the public domain.65 Two, 
it covered nearly all the timeframe of 
greatest relevance to this proposed rule 
(2012–2015 model years). Three, it 
provided projections of vehicle sales 
both by manufacturer and by market 
segment. Four, it utilized market 
segments similar to those used in the

EPA emission certification program and 
fuel economy guide. As discussed 
further below, this allowed the CSM 
forecast to be combined with other data 
obtained by NHTSA and EPA. We also 
assumed that the breakdowns of car and 
truck sales by manufacturer and by 
market segment for 2016 model year and 
beyond were the same as CSM’s forecast 
for 2015 calendar year. The changes 
between company market share and 
industry market segments were most 
significant from 2011–2014, while for 
2014–2015 the changes were relatively 
small. Therefore, we assumed 2016 
market share and market segments to be 
the same as for 2015. To the extent that 
the agencies have received CSM 
forecasts for 2016, we will consider 
using them for the final rule. 
We then projected the CSM forecasts 
for relative sales of cars and trucks by 
manufacturer and by market segment on 
to the total sales estimates of the 
updated 2009 Annual Energy Outlook. 
Tables II.B.1–1 and II.B.1–2 show the 
resulting projections for the 2016 model 
year and compare these to actual sales 
which occurred in 2008 model year. 
Both tables show sales using the 
traditional or classic definition of cars 
and light trucks. Determining which 
classic trucks will be defined as cars 
using the revised definition established 
by NHTSA earlier this year and 
included in this proposed rule requires 
more detailed information about each 
vehicle model which is developed next.

The agencies recognize that CSM 
forecasts a very significant reduction in 
market share for Chrysler. This may be 
a result of the extreme uncertainty 
surrounding Chrysler in early 2009. The 
forecast from CSM used in this proposal 
is CSM’s forecast from the 2nd quarter 
of 2009. CSM also provided to the 
agencies an updated forecast in the 3rd 
quarter of 2009, which we were unable 
to use for this proposal due to time 
constraints. However, we have placed a 
copy of the 3rd Quarter CSM forecast in 
the public docket for this rulemaking, 
and we will consider its use, and any 
further updates from CSM or other data 
received during the comment period 
when developing the analysis for the 
final rule.66 CSM’s forecast for Chrysler 
for the 3rd quarter of 2009 was 
significantly increased compared to the 
2nd quarter, by nearly a factor of two

and Utility Vehicles.’’ 
increase in projected sales over the 
2012–2015 time frame. 
The forecasts obtained from CSM 
provided estimates of car and trucks 
sales by segment and by manufacturer, 
but not by manufacturer for each market 
segment. Therefore, we needed other 
information on which to base these 
more detailed market splits. For this 
task, we used as a starting point each 
manufacturer’s sales by market segment 
from model year 2008. Because of the 
larger number of segments in the truck 
market, we used slightly different 
methodologies for cars and trucks. 
The first step for both cars and trucks 
was to break down each manufacturer’s 
2008 sales according to the market 
segment definitions used by CSM. For 
example, we found that Ford’s car sales 
in 2008 were broken down as shown in 
Table II.B.2–3: 
TABLE II.B.2–3—BREAKDOWN OF 
FORD’S 2008 CAR SALES 
Full-size cars ................. 76,762 units. 
Mid-size cars ................. 170,399 units. 
Small/Compact cars ...... 180,249 units. 
Subcompact/Mini cars ... None. 
Luxury cars ................... 100,065 units. 
Specialty cars ................ 110,805 units. 
We then adjusted each manufacturer’s 
sales of each of its car segments (and 
truck segments, separately) so that the 
manufacturer’s total sales of cars (and 
trucks) matched the total estimated for 
each future model year based on EIA 
and CSM forecasts. For example, as 
indicated in Table II.B.2–1, Ford’s total 
car sales in 2008 were 641,281 units, 
while we project that they will increase 
to 990,700 units by 2016. This 
represents an increase of 54.5 percent. 
Thus, we increased the 2008 sales of 
each Ford car segment by 54.5 percent. 
This produced estimates of future sales 
which matched total car and truck sales 
per EIA and the manufacturer 
breakdowns per CSM (and exemplified 
for 2016 in Table II.B.1–1). However, the 
sales splits by market segment would 
not necessarily match those of CSM 
(and exemplified for 2016 in Table 
II.B.2–2). 
In order to adjust the market segment 
mix for cars, we first adjusted sales of 
luxury, specialty and other cars. Since 
the total sales of cars for each 
manufacturer were already set, any 
changes in the sales of one car segment 
had to be compensated by the opposite 
change in another segment. For the 
luxury, specialty and other car 
segments, it is not clear how changes in 
sales would be compensated. For 
example, if luxury car sales decreased, 
would sales of full-size cars increase, 
mid-size cars, etc.? Thus, any changes in 
the sales of cars within these three 
segments were assumed to be 
compensated for by proportional 
changes in the sales of the other four car 
segments. For example, for 2016, the 
figures in Table II.B.2–2 indicate that 
luxury car sales in 2016 are 1,432,162 
units. Luxury car sales are 1,057,875 
units in 2008. However, after adjusting 
2008 car sales by the change in total car 
sales for 2016 projected by EIA and a 
change in manufacturer market share 
per CSM, luxury car sales increased to 
1,521,892 units. Thus, overall for 2016, 
luxury car sales had to decrease by 
89,730 units or 6 percent. We decreased 
the luxury car sales by each 
manufacturer by this percentage. The 
absolute decrease in luxury car sales 
was spread across sales of full-size, mid- 
size, compact and subcompact cars in 
proportion to each manufacturer’s sales 
in these segments in 2008. The same 
adjustment process was used for 
specialty cars and the ‘‘other cars’’ 
segment defined by CSM. 
A slightly different approach was 
used to adjust for changing sales of the 
remaining four car segments. Starting 
with full-size cars, we again determined 
the overall percentage change that 
needed to occur in future year full-size 
cars sales after (1) adjusting for total 
sales per EIA, (2) manufacturer sales 
mix per CSM and (3) adjustments in the 
luxury, specialty and other car 
segments, in order to meet the segment 
sales mix per CSM. Sales of each 
manufacturer’s large cars were adjusted 
by this percentage. However, instead of 
spreading this change over the 
remaining three segments, we assigned 
the entire change to mid-size vehicles. 
We did so because, as shown in 2008, 
higher fuel prices tend to cause car 
purchasers to purchase smaller vehicles. 
We are using AEO 2009 for this 
analysis, which assumes fuel prices 
similar in magnitude to actual high fuel 
prices seen in the summer of 2008.67 
However, if a consumer had previously 
purchased a full-size car, we thought it 
unlikely that they would jump all the 
way to a subcompact. It seemed more 
reasonable to project that they would 
drop one vehicle size category smaller. 
Thus, the change in each manufacturer’s 
sales of full-size cars was matched by an 
opposite change (in absolute units sold) 
in mid-size cars. 
The same process was then applied to 
mid-size cars, with the change in mid- 
size car sales being matched by an 
opposite change in compact car sales. 
This process was repeated one more 
time for compact car sales, with changes 
in sales in this segment being matched 
by the opposite change in the sales of 
subcompacts. The overall result was a 
projection of car sales for 2012–2016 
which matched the total sales 
projections of EIA and the manufacturer 
and segment splits of CSM. These sales 
splits can be found in Chapter 1 of the 
draft Joint Technical Support Document 
for this proposal. 
As mentioned above, a slightly 
different process was applied to truck 
sales. The reason for this was we could 
not confidently project how the change 
in sales from one segment preferentially 
went to or came from another particular 
segment. Some trend from larger 
vehicles to smaller vehicles would have 
been possible. However, the CSM 
forecasts indicated large changes in total 
sport utility vehicle, multi-activity 
vehicle and cross-over sales which 
could not be connected. Thus, we 
applied an iterative, but straightforward 
process for adjusting 2008 truck sales to 
match the EIA and CSM forecasts. 
The first three steps were exactly the 
same as for cars. We broke down each 
manufacturer’s truck sales into the truck 
segments as defined by CSM. We then 
adjusted all manufacturers’ truck 
segment sales by the same factor so that 
total truck sales in each model year 
matched EIA projections for truck sales 
by model year. We then adjusted each 
manufacturer’s truck sales by segment 
proportionally so that each 
manufacturer’s percentage of total truck 
sales matched that forecast by CSM. 
This again left the need to adjust truck 
sales by segment to match the CSM 
forecast for each model year. 
In the fourth step, we adjusted the 
sales of each truck segment by a 
common factor so that total sales for that 
segment matched the combination of the 
EIA and CSM forecasts. For example, 
sales of large pickups across all 
manufacturers were 1,144,166 units in 
2016 after adjusting total sales to match 
EIA’s forecast and adjusting each 
manufacturer’s truck sales to match 
CSM’s forecast for the breakdown of 
sales by manufacturer. Applying CSM’s 
forecast of the large pickup segment of 
truck sales to EIA’s total sales forecast 
indicated total large pickup sales of 
1,475,881 units. Thus, we increased 
each manufacturer’s sales of large 
pickups by 29 percent. The same type 
of adjustment was applied to all the 
other truck segments at the same time. 
The result was a set of sales projections 
which matched EIA’s total truck sales 
projection and CSM’s market segment 
forecast. However, after this step, sales

by manufacturer no longer met CSM’s 
forecast. Thus, we repeated step three 
and adjusted each manufacturer’s truck 
sales so that they met CSM’s forecast. 
The sales of each truck segment (by 
manufacturer) were adjusted by the 
same factor. The resulting sales 
projection matched EIA’s total truck 
sales projection and CSM’s 
manufacturer forecast, but sales by 
market segment no longer met CSM’s 
forecast. However, the difference 
between the sales projections after this 
fifth step was closer to CSM’s market 
segment forecast than it was after step 
three. In other words, the sales 
projection was converging. We repeated 
these adjustments, matching 
manufacturer sales mix in one step and 
then market segment in the next for a 
total of 19 times. At this point, we were 
able to match the market segment splits 
exactly and the manufacturer splits 
were within 0.1% of our goal, which is 
well within the needs of this analysis. 
The next step in developing the 
baseline fleet was to characterize the 
vehicles within each manufacturer- 
segment combination. In large part, this 
was based on the characterization of the 
specific vehicle models sold in 2008. 
EPA and NHTSA chose to base our 
estimates of detailed vehicle 
characteristics on 2008 sales for several 
reasons. One, these vehicle 
characteristics are not confidential and 
can thus be published here for careful 
review and comment by interested 
parties. Two, being actual sales data, 
this vehicle fleet represents the 
distribution of consumer demand for 
utility, performance, safety, etc. 
We gathered most of the information 
about the 2008 vehicle fleet from EPA’s 
emission certification and fuel economy 
database. The data obtained from this 
source included vehicle production 
volume, fuel economy, engine size, 
number of engine cylinders, 
transmission type, fuel type, etc. EPA’s 
certification database does not include a 
detailed description of the types of fuel 
economy-improving/CO2-reducing 
technologies considered in this 
proposal. Thus, we augmented this 
description with publicly available data 
which includes more complete 
technology descriptions from Ward’s 
Automotive Group.68 In a few instances 
when required vehicle information was 
not available from these two sources 
(such as vehicle footprint), we obtained 
this information from publicly 
accessible Internet sites such as 
Motortrend.com and Edmunds.com.69 
The projections of future car and 
truck sales described above apply to 
each manufacturer’s sales by market 
segment. The EPA emissions 
certification sales data are available at a 
much finer level of detail, essentially 
vehicle configuration. As mentioned 
above, we placed each vehicle in the 
EPA certification database into one of 
the CSM market segments. We then 
totaled the sales by each manufacturer 
for each market segment. If the 
combination of EIA and CSM forecasts 
indicated an increase in a given 
manufacturer’s sales of a particular 
market segment, then the sales of all the 
individual vehicle configurations were 
adjusted by the same factor. For 
example, if the Prius represented 30% 
of Toyota’s sales of compact cars in 
2008 and Toyota’s sales of compact cars 
in 2016 was projected to double by 
2016, then the sales of the Prius were 
doubled, and the Prius sales in 2016 
remained 30% of Toyota’s compact car 
sales. 
NHTSA and EPA request comment on 
the methodology and data sources used 
for developing the baseline vehicle fleet 
for this proposal and the reasonableness 
of the results. 
3. How Is the Development of the 
Baseline Fleet for This Proposal 
Different From NHTSA’s Historical 
Approach, and Why Is This Approach 
Preferable? 
NHTSA has historically based its 
analysis of potential new CAFE 
standards on detailed product plans the 
agency has requested from 
manufacturers planning to produce light 
vehicles for sale in the United States. 
Although the agency has not attempted 
to compel manufacturers to submit such 
information, most major manufacturers 
and some smaller manufacturers have 
voluntarily provided it when requested. 
As in this and other prior 
rulemakings, NHTSA has requested 
extensive and detailed information 
regarding the models that manufacturers 
plan to offer, as well as manufacturers’ 
estimates of the volume of each model 
they expect to produce for sale in the 
U.S. NHTSA’s recent requests have 
sought information regarding a range of 
engineering and planning characteristics 
for each vehicle model (e.g., fuel 
economy, engine, transmission, physical 
dimensions, weights and capacities, 
redesign schedules), each engine (e.g., 
fuel type, fuel delivery, aspiration, 
valvetrain configuration, valve timing, 
valve lift, power and torque ratings), 
and each transmission (e.g., type, 
number of gears, logic). 
The information that manufacturers 
have provided in response to these 
requests has varied in completeness and 
detail. Some manufacturers have 
submitted nearly all of the information 
NHTSA has requested, have done so for 
most or all of the model years covered 
by NHTSA’s requests, and have closely 
followed NHTSA’s guidance regarding 
the structure of the information. Other 
manufacturers have submitted partial 
information, information for only a few 
model years, and/or information in a 
structure less amenable to analysis. Still 
other manufacturers have not responded 
to NHTSA’s requests or have responded 
on occasion, usually with partial 
information. 
In recent rulemakings, NHTSA has 
integrated this information and 
estimated missing information based on 
a range of public and commercial 
sources (such as those used to develop 
today’s market forecast). For 
unresponsive manufacturers, NHTSA 
has estimated fleet composition based 
on the latest-available CAFE compliance 
data (the same data used as part of the 
foundation for today’s market forecast). 
NHTSA has then adjusted the size of the 
fleet based on AEO’s forecast of the light 
vehicle market and normalized 
manufacturers’ market shares based on 
the latest-available CAFE compliance 
data. 
Compared to this approach, the 
market forecast the agencies have 
developed for this analysis has both 
advantages and disadvantages. 
Most importantly, today’s market 
forecast is much more transparent. The 
information sources used to develop 
today’s market forecast are all either in 
the public domain or available 
commercially. Therefore, NHTSA and 
EPA are able to make public the market 
inputs actually used in the agencies’ 
respective modeling systems, such that 
any reviewer may independently repeat 
and review the agencies’ analyses. 
Previously, although NHTSA provided 
this type of information to 
manufacturers upon request (e.g., GM 
requested and received outputs specific 
to GM), NHTSA was otherwise unable 
to release market inputs and the most 
detailed model outputs (i.e., the outputs 
containing information regarding 
specific vehicle models) because doing 
so would violate requirements 
protecting manufacturers’ confidential 
business information from disclosure.70 
Therefore, this approach provides much 
greater opportunity for the public to

71 However, as discussed below, an alternative 
approach that NHTSA is exploring would be to use 
only manufacturers’ near-term product plans, e.g., 
from MY 2010 or MY 2011. NHTSA believes 
manufacturers’ near-term plans should be less 
subject to this concern about missing costs and 
benefits already included in the baseline. NHTSA 
is also hopeful that in connection with the agencies’ 
rulemaking efforts, manufacturers will be willing to 
make their near-term plans available to the public. 
72 We note that market share forecasts like CSM’s 
could, of course, be applied to any data used to 
create the baseline market forecast. If, as mentioned 
above, manufacturers do consent to make public 
MY 2010 or 2011 product plan data for the final 
rule, the agencies could consider applying market 
share forecast to that data as well. 
review every aspect of the agencies’ 
analyses and comment accordingly. 
Another significant advantage of 
today’s market forecast is the agencies’ 
ability to assess more fully the 
incremental costs and benefits of the 
proposed standards. In the past two 
years, NHTSA has requested and 
received three sets of future product 
plan submissions from the automotive 
companies, most recently this past 
spring. These submissions are intended 
to be the actual future product plans for 
the companies. In the most recent 
submission it is clear that many of the 
firms have been and are clearly 
planning for future CAFE standard 
increases for model years 2012 and 
later. The results for the product plans 
for many firms are a significant increase 
in their projected future application of 
fuel economy improvement technology. 
However, for the purposes of assessing 
the costs of the model year 2012–2016 
standards the use of the product plans 
presents a difficulty, namely, how to 
assess the increased costs of the 
proposed future standards if the 
companies have already anticipated the 
future standards and the costs are 
therefore now part of the agencies’ 
baseline. This is a real concern with the 
most recent product plans received from 
the companies, and is one of the reasons 
the agencies have decided not to use the 
recent product plans to define the 
baseline market data for assessing our 
proposed standards. The approach used 
for this proposal does not raise this 
concern, as the underlying data comes 
from model year 2008 production.71 
In addition, by developing a baseline 
fleet from common sources, the agencies 
have been able to avoid some errors— 
perhaps related to interpretation of 
requests—that have been observed in 
past responses to NHTSA’s requests. For 
example, while reviewing information 
submitted to support the most recent 
CAFE rulemaking, NHTSA staff 
discovered that one manufacturer had 
misinterpreted instructions regarding 
the specification of vehicle track width, 
leading to important errors in estimates 
of vehicle footprints. Although the 
manufacturer resubmitted the 
information with corrections, with this 
approach, the agencies are able to 
reduce the potential for such errors and 
inconsistencies by utilizing common 
data sources and procedures. 
An additional advantage of the 
approach used for this proposal is a 
consistent projection of the change in 
fuel economy and CO2 emissions across 
the various vehicles from the 
application of new technology. In the 
past, company product plans would 
include the application of new fuel 
economy improvement technology for a 
new or improved vehicle model with 
the resultant estimate from the company 
of the fuel economy levels for the 
vehicle. However, companies did not 
always provide to NHTSA the detailed 
analysis which showed how they 
forecasted what the fuel economy 
performance of the new vehicle was— 
that is, whether it came from actual test 
data, from vehicle simulation modeling, 
from best engineering judgment or some 
other methodology. Thus, it was not 
possible for NHTSA to review the 
methodology used by the manufacturer, 
nor was it possible to review what 
approach the different manufacturers 
utilized from a consistency perspective. 
With the approach used for this 
proposal, the baseline market data 
comes from actual vehicles which have 
actual fuel economy test data—so there 
is no question what is the basis for the 
fuel economy or CO2 performance of the 
baseline market data as it is actual 
measured data. 
Another advantage of today’s 
approach is that future market shares 
are based on a forecast of what will 
occur in the future, rather than a static 
value. In the past, NHTSA has utilized 
a constant market share for each model 
year, based on the most recent year 
available, for example from the CAFE 
compliance data, that is, a forecast of 
the 2011–2015 time frame where 
company market shares do not change. 
In the approach used today, we have 
utilized the forecasts from CSM of how 
future market shares among the 
companies may change over time.72 
The approach the agencies have taken 
in developing today’s market forecast 
does, however, have some 
disadvantages. Most importantly, it 
produces a market forecast that does not 
represent some important changes likely 
to occur in the future. 
Some of the changes not captured by 
today’s approach are specific. For 
example, the agencies’ current market 
forecast includes some vehicles for 
which manufacturers have announced 
plans for elimination or drastic 
production cuts such as the Chevrolet 
Trailblazer, the Chrysler PT Cruiser, the 
Chrysler Pacifica, the Dodge Magnum, 
the Ford Crown Victoria, the Hummer 
H2, the Mercury Sable, the Pontiac 
Grand Prix, and the Pontiac G5. These 
vehicle models appear explicitly in 
market inputs to NHTSA’s analysis, and 
are among those vehicle models 
included in the aggregated vehicle types 
appearing in market inputs to EPA’s 
analysis. 
Conversely, the agencies’ market 
forecast does not include some 
forthcoming vehicle models, such as the 
Chevrolet Volt, the Chevrolet Camaro, 
the Ford Fiesta and several publicly 
announced electric vehicles, including 
the announcements from Nissan. Nor 
does it include several MY 2009 or 2010 
vehicles, such as the Honda Insight, the 
Hyundai Genesis and the Toyota Venza, 
as our starting point for vehicle 
definitions was Model Year 2008. 
Additionally, the market forecast does 
not account for publicly announced 
technology introductions, such as Ford’s 
EcoBoost system, whose product plans 
specify which vehicles and how many 
are planned to have this technology. 
Were the agencies to rely on 
manufacturers’ product plans (that were 
submitted), the market forecast would 
account for not only these specific 
examples, but also for similar examples 
that have not yet been announced 
publicly. 
The agencies anticipate that including 
vehicles after MY 2008 would not 
significantly impact our estimates of the 
technology required to comply with the 
proposed standards. If they were 
included, these vehicles could make the 
standards appear to cost less relative to 
the reference case. First, the projections 
of sales by vehicle segment and 
manufacturer include these expected 
new vehicle models. Thus, to the extent 
that these new vehicles are expected to 
change consumer demand, they should 
be reflected in our reference case. While 
we are projecting the characteristics of 
the new vehicles with MY 2008 
vehicles, the primary difference 
between the new vehicles and 2008 
vehicles in the same vehicle segment is 
the use of additional CO2-reducing and 
fuel-saving technology. Both the 
NHTSA and EPA models add such 
technology to facilitate compliance with 
the proposed standards. Thus, our 
future projections of the vehicle fleet 
generally shift vehicle designs towards 
those of these newer vehicles. The 
advantage of our approach is that it 
helps clarify the costs of this proposal, 
as the cost of all fuel economy

73 A full-size pickup might be offered with 
various combinations of cab style (e.g., regular, 
extended, crew) and box length (e.g., 51⁄2′, 61⁄2′, 8′) 
and, therefore, multiple footprint sizes. CAFE 
compliance data for MY 2008 data does not contain 
footprint information, and does not contain 
information that can be used to reliably identify 
which pickup entries correspond to footprint values 
estimable from public or commercial sources. 
Therefore, the agencies have used the known 
production levels of average values to represent all 
variants of a given pickup line (e.g., all variants of 
the F–150 and the Sierra/Silverado) in order to 
calculate the sales-weighted average footprint value 
for each pickup family. Again, this has no impact 
on the results of our modeling effort, although it 
would require re-estimation if we were to examine 
light truck standards of a different shape. In the 
extreme, one single footprint value could be used 
for every vehicle sold by a single manufacturer as 
long as the fuel economy standard associated with 
this footprint value represented the sales-weighted, 
harmonic average of the fuel economy standards 
associated with each vehicle’s footprint values. 74 74 FR 9185 (Mar. 3, 2009) 
improvements beyond those required by 
the MY 2011 CAFE standards are being 
assigned to the proposal. In some cases, 
the new vehicles being introduced by 
manufacturers are actually in response 
to their anticipation of this rulemaking. 
Our approach prevents some of these 
technological improvements and their 
associated cost from being assumed in 
the baseline. Thus, the added 
technology will not be considered to be 
free for the purposes of this rule. 
We note that, as a result of these 
issues, the market file may show sales 
volumes for certain vehicles during MYs 
2012–2016 even though they will be 
discontinued before that time frame. 
Although the agencies recognize that 
these specific vehicles will be 
discontinued, we continue to include 
them in the market forecast because 
they are useful for representing 
successor vehicles that may appear in 
the rulemaking time frame to replace the 
discontinued vehicles in that market 
segment. 
Other market changes not captured by 
today’s approach are broader. For 
example, Chrysler Group LLC has 
announced plans to offer small- and 
medium-sized cars using Fiat 
powertrains. The product plan 
submitted by Chrysler includes vehicles 
that appear to reflect these plans. 
However, none of these specific vehicle 
models are included in the market 
forecast the agencies have developed 
starting with MY 2008 CAFE 
compliance data. The product plan 
submitted by Chrysler is also more 
optimistic with regard to Chrysler’s 
market share during MYs 2012–2016 
than the market forecast projected by 
CSM and used by the agencies for this 
proposal. Similarly, the agencies’ 
market forecast does not reflect Nissan’s 
plans regarding electric vehicles. 
Additionally, some technical 
information that manufacturers have 
provided in product plans regarding 
specific vehicle models is, at least 
insofar as NHTSA and EPA have been 
able to determine, not available from 
public or commercial sources. While 
such gaps do not bear significantly on 
the agencies’ analysis, the diversity of 
pickup configurations necessitated 
utilizing a sales-weighted average 
footprint value 73 for many 
manufacturers’ pickups. Since our 
modeling only utilizes footprint in order 
to estimate each manufacturer’s CO2 or 
fuel economy standard and all the other 
vehicle characteristics are available for 
each pickup configuration, this 
approximation has no practical impact 
on the projected technology or cost 
associated with compliance with the 
various standards evaluated. The only 
impact which could arise would be if 
the relative sales of the various pickup 
configurations changed, or if the 
agencies were to explore standards with 
a different shape. This would 
necessitate recalculating the average 
footprint value in order to maintain 
accuracy. 
The agencies have carefully 
considered these advantages and 
disadvantages of using a market forecast 
derived from public and commercial 
sources rather than from manufacturers’ 
product plans, and we believe that the 
advantages outweigh the disadvantages 
for the purpose of proposing standards 
for model years 2012–2016. NHTSA’s 
inability to release confidential market 
inputs and corresponding detailed 
outputs from the CAFE model has raised 
serious concerns among many observers 
regarding the transparency of NHTSA’s 
analysis, as well as related concerns that 
the lack of transparency might enable 
manufacturers to provide unrealistic 
information to try to influence NHTSA’s 
determination of the maximum feasible 
standards. Although NHTSA does not 
agree with some observers’ assertions 
that some manufacturers have 
deliberately provided inaccurate or 
otherwise misleading information, 
today’s market forecast is fully open and 
transparent, and is therefore not subject 
to such concerns. 
With respect to the disadvantages, the 
agencies are hopeful that manufacturers 
will, in the future, agree to make public 
their plans regarding model years that 
are very near, such as MY 2010 or 
perhaps MY 2011, so that this 
information can be considered for 
purposes of the final rule analysis and 
be available for the public. In any event, 
because NHTSA and EPA are releasing 
market inputs used in the agencies’ 
respective analyses, manufacturers, 
suppliers, and other automobile 
industry observers and participant can 
submit comments on how these inputs 
should be improved, as can all other 
reviewers. 
4. How Does Manufacturer Product Plan 
Data Factor into the Baseline Used in 
This Proposal? 
In the Spring of 2009, many 
manufacturers submitted product plans 
in response to NHTSA’s request that 
they do so.74 NHTSA and EPA both 
have access to these plans, and both 
agencies have reviewed them in detail. 
A small amount of product plan data 
was used in the development of the 
baseline. The specific pieces of data are: 
• Wheelbase; 
• Track Width Front; 
• Track Width Rear; 
• EPS (Electric Power Steering); 
• ROLL (Reduced Rolling Resistance); 
• LUB (Advance Lubrication i.e., low 
weight oil); 
• IACC (Improved Electrical 
Accessories); 
• Curb Weight; 
• GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight 
Rating) 
The track widths, wheelbase, curb 
weight, and GVWR could have been 
looked up on the Internet (159 were), 
but were taken from the product plans 
when available for convenience. To 
ensure accuracy, a sample from each 
product plan was used as a check 
against the numbers available from 
Motortrend.com. These numbers will be 
published in the baseline file since they 
can be easily looked up on the Internet. 
On the other hand, EPS, ROLL, LUB, 
and IACC are difficult to determine 
without using manufacturer’s product 
plans. These items will not be published 
in the baseline file, but the data has 
been aggregated into the EPA baseline in 
the technology effectiveness and cost 
effectiveness for each vehicle in a way 
that allows the baseline for the model to 
be published without revealing the 
manufacturers’ data. 
Considering both the publicly- 
available baseline used in this proposal 
and the product plans provided recently 
by manufacturers, however, it is 
possible that the latter could potentially 
be used to develop a more realistic 
forecast of product mix and vehicle 
characteristics of the near-future light- 
duty fleet. At the core of concerns about 
using company product plans are two 
concerns about doing so: (a) Uncertainty 
and possible inaccuracy in 
manufacturers’ forecasts and (b) the 
transparency of using product plan data. 
With respect to the first concern, the

77 The equations are equivalent but are specified

78 This function is linear in fuel consumption but

agencies note that manufacturers’ near- 
term forecasts (i.e., for model years two 
or three years into the future) should be 
less uncertain and more amenable to 
eventual retrospective analysis (i.e., 
comparison to actual sales) than 
manufacturers’ longer-term forecasts 
(i.e., for model years more than five 
years into the future). With respect to 
the second concern, NHTSA has 
consulted with most manufacturers and 
believes that although few, if any, 
manufacturers would be willing to make 
public their longer-term plans, many 
responding manufacturers may be 
willing to make public their short-term 
plans. In a companion notice, NHTSA is 
seeking product plan information from 
manufacturers for MYs 2008 to 2020, 
and the agencies will also continue to 
consult with manufacturers regarding 
the possibility of releasing plans for MY 
2010 and/or MY 2011 for purposes of 
developing and analyzing the final GHG 
and CAFE standards for MYs 2012– 
2016. The agencies are hopeful that 
manufacturers will agree to do so, and 
that NHTSA and EPA would therefore 
be able to use product plans in ways 
that might aid in increasing the 
accuracy of the baseline market forecast. 
C. Development of Attribute-Based 
Curve Shapes 
NHTSA and EPA are setting attribute- 
based CAFE and CO2 standards that are 
defined by a mathematical function for 
MYs 2012–2016 passenger cars and light 
trucks. EPCA, as amended by EISA, 
expressly requires that CAFE standards 
for passenger cars and light trucks be 
based on one or more vehicle attributes 
related to fuel economy, and be 
expressed in the form of a mathematical 
function.75 The CAA has no such 
requirement, though in past rules, EPA 
has relied on both universal and 
attribute-based standards (e.g., for 
nonroad engines, EPA uses the attribute 
of horsepower). However, given the 
advantages of using attribute-based 
standards and given the goal of 
coordinating and harmonizing CO2 
standards promulgated under the CAA 
and CAFE standards promulgated under 
EPCA, as expressed in the joint NOI, 
EPA is also proposing to issue standards 
that are attribute-based and defined by 
mathematical functions. 
Under an attribute-based standard, 
every vehicle model has a performance 
target (fuel economy and GHG 
emissions for CAFE and GHG emissions 
standards, respectively), the level of 
which depends on the vehicle’s 
attribute (for this proposal, footprint). 
The manufacturers’ fleet average 
performance is determined by the 
production-weighed 76 average (for 
CAFE, harmonic average) of those 
targets. NHTSA and EPA are proposing 
CAFE and CO2 emissions standards 
defined by constrained linear functions 
and, equivalently, piecewise linear 
functions.77 As a possible option for 
future rulemakings, the constrained 
linear form was introduced by NHTSA 
in the 2007 NPRM proposing CAFE 
standards for MY 2011–2015. Described 
mathematically, the proposed 
constrained linear function is defined 
according to the following formula: 78 
Where: 
TARGET = the fuel economy target (in mpg) 
applicable to vehicles of a given 
footprint (FOOTPRINT, in square feet), 
a = the function’s upper limit (in mpg), 
b = the function’s lower limit (in mpg), 
c = the slope (in gpm per square foot) of the 
sloped portion of the function, 
d = the intercept (in gpm) of the sloped 
portion of the function (that is, the value 
the sloped portion would take if 
extended to a footprint of 0 square feet, 
and the MIN and MAX functions take the 
minimum and maximum, respectively, 
of the included values; for example, 
MIN(1,2) = 1, MAX(1,2) = 2, and 
MIN[MAX(1,2),3)] = 2.

The specific form and stringency for

through specific values for the four 
coefficients shown above. 
EPA is proposing the equivalent 
equation below for assigning CO2 targets 
to an individual vehicle’s footprint 
value. Although the general model of 
the equation is the same for each vehicle 
category and each year, the parameters 
of the equation differ for cars and 
trucks. Each parameter also changes on 
an annual basis, resulting in the yearly 
increases in stringency seen in the 
tables above. Described mathematically, 
EPA’s proposed piecewise linear

In the constrained linear form applied 
by NHTSA, this equation takes the 
simplified form: 
Target = MIN [MAX (c * x + d, a), b] 
Where: 
Target = the CO2 target value for a given 
footprint (in g/mi) 
a = the minimum target value (in g/mi CO2) 
b = the maximum target value (in g/mi CO2) 
c = the slope of the linear function (in g/mi 
per sq ft CO2) 
d = is the intercept or zero-offset for the line 
(in g/mi CO2) 
x = footprint of the vehicle model (in square 
feet, rounded to the nearest tenth) 
l & h are the lower and higher footprint limits 
or constraints or (‘‘kinks’’) or the 
boundary between the flat regions and 
the intermediate sloped line (in sq ft) 
Graphically, piecewise linear form, 
like the constrained linear form, appears 
as shown in Figure II.C.1–2.

79 The agencies excluded diesel engines and 
strong hybrid vehicle technologies from this 
exercise (and only this exercise) because the 
agencies expect that manufacturers would not need 
to rely heavily on these technologies in order to 
comply with the proposed standards. NHTSA and 
EPA did include diesel engines and strong hybrid 
vehicle technologies in all other portions of their 
analyses. 80 49 U.S.C. 32902(b)(4). 
BILLING CODE 4910–59–C 
As for the constrained linear form, the 
specific form and stringency for each 
fleet (passenger car and light trucks) and 
model year are defined through specific 
values for the four coefficients shown 
above. 
For purposes of this rule, NHTSA and 
EPA developed the basic curve shapes 
using methods similar to those applied 
by NHTSA in fitting the curves defining 
the MY 2011 standards. The first step is 
defining the reference market inputs (in 
the form used by NHTSA’s CAFE 
model) described in Section II.B of this 
preamble and in Chapter 1 of the joint 
TSD. However, because the baseline 
fleet is technologically heterogeneous, 
NHTSA used the CAFE model to 
develop a fleet to which nearly all the 
technologies discussed in Chapter 3 of 
the joint TSD 79 were applied, by taking 
the following steps: (1) Treating all 
manufacturers as unwilling to pay civil 
penalties rather than applying 
technology, (2) applying any technology 
at any time, irrespective of scheduled 
vehicle redesigns or freshening, and (3) 
ignoring ‘‘phase-in caps’’ that constrain 
the overall amount of technology that 
can be applied by the model to a given 
manufacturer’s fleet. These steps helped 
to increase technological parity among 
vehicle models, thereby providing a 
better basis (than the baseline or 
reference fleets) for estimating the 
statistical relationship between vehicle 
size and fuel economy. 
In fitting the curves, NHTSA also 
continued to apply constraints to limit 
the function’s value for both the 
smallest and largest vehicles. Without a 
limit at the smallest footprints, the 
function—whether logistic or linear— 
can reach values that would be unfairly 
burdensome for a manufacturer that 
elects to focus on the market for small 
vehicles; depending on the underlying 
data, an unconstrained form could 
apply to the smallest vehicles targets 
that are simply unachievable. Limiting 
the function’s value for the smallest 
vehicles ensures that the function 
remains technologically achievable at 
small footprints, and that it does not 
unduly burden manufacturers focusing 
on small vehicles. On the other side of 
the function, without a limit at the 
largest footprints, the function may 
provide no floor on required fuel 
economy. Also, the safety 
considerations that support the 
provision of a disincentive for 
downsizing as a compliance strategy 
apply weakly—if at all—to the very 
largest vehicles. Limiting the function’s 
value for the largest vehicles leads to a 
function with an inherent absolute 
minimum level of performance, while 
remaining consistent with safety 
considerations. 
Before fitting the sloped portion of the 
constrained linear form, NHTSA 
selected footprints above and below 
which to apply constraints (i.e., 
minimum and maximum values) on the 
function. For passenger cars, the agency 
noted that several manufacturers offer 
small and, in some cases, sporty coupes 
below 41 square feet, examples 
including the BMW Z4 and Mini, Saturn 
Sky, Honda Fit and S2000, Hyundai 
Tiburon, Mazda MX–5 Miata, Suzuki 
SX4, Toyota Yaris, and Volkswagen 
New Beetle. Because such vehicles 
represent a small portion (less than 10 
percent) of the passenger car market, yet 
often have characteristics that could 
make it infeasible to achieve the very 
challenging targets that could apply in 
the absence of a constraint, NHTSA is 
proposing to ‘‘cut off’’ the linear portion 
of the passenger car function at 41 
square feet. For consistency, the agency 
is proposing to do the same for the light 
truck function, although no light trucks 
are currently offered below 41 square 
feet. The agency further noted that 
above 56 square feet, the only passenger 
car model present in the MY 2008 fleet 
were four luxury vehicles with 
extremely low sales volumes—the 
Bentley Arnage and three versions of the 
Rolls Royce Phantom. NHTSA is 
therefore proposing to ‘‘cut off’’ the 
linear portion of the passenger car 
function at 56 square feet. Finally, the 
agency noted that although public 
information is limited regarding the 
sales volumes of the many different 
configurations (cab designs and bed 
sizes) of pickup trucks, most of the 
largest pickups (e.g., the Ford F–150, 
GM Sierra/Silverado, Nissan Titan, and 
Toyota Tundra) appear to fall just above 
66 square feet in footprint. NHTSA is 
therefore proposing to ‘‘cut off’’ the 
linear portion of the light truck function 
at 66 square feet. 
NHTSA and EPA seek comment on 
this approach to fitting the curves. We 
note that final decisions on this issue 
will play an important role in 
determining the form and stringency of 
the final CAFE and CO2 standards, the 
incentives those standards will provide 
(e.g., with respect to downsizing small 
vehicles), and the relative compliance 
burden faced by each manufacturer. 
For purposes of the CAFE and CO2 
standards proposed in this NPRM, 
NHTSA and EPA recognize that there is 
some possibility that low fuel prices 
during the years in which MY 2012– 
2016 vehicles are in service might lead 
to less than currently anticipated fuel 
savings and emissions reductions. One 
way to assure that emission reductions 
are achieved in fact is through the use 
of explicit backstops, fleet average 
standards established at an absolute 
level. For purposes of the CAFE 
program, EISA requires a backstop for 
domestically-manufactured passenger 
cars—a universal minimum, non- 
attribute-based standard of either ‘‘27.5 
mpg or 92 percent of the average fuel 
economy projected by the Secretary of 
Transportation for the combined 
domestic and non-domestic passenger 
automobile fleets manufactured for sale 
in the United States by all 
manufacturers in the model year 
* * *,’’ whichever is greater.80 In the 
MY 2011 final rule, the first rule setting 
standards since EISA added the 
backstop provision to EPCA, NHTSA 
considered whether the statute 
permitted the agency to set backstop 
standards for the other regulated fleets 
of imported passenger cars and light 
trucks. Although commenters expressed 
support both for and against a more 
permissive reading of EISA, NHTSA 
concluded in that rulemaking that its 
authority was likely limited to setting 
only the backstop standard that 
Congress expressly provided, i.e., the 
one for domestic passenger cars. A 
backstop, however, could be adopted 
under section 202(a) of the CAA 
assuming it could be justified under the 
relevant statutory criteria. EPA and 
NHTSA also note that the flattened 
portion of the car curve directionally 
addresses the issue of a backstop (i.e., a 
flat curve is itself a backstop). The 
agencies seek comment on whether 
backstop standards, or any other method 
within the agencies’ statutory authority, 
should and can be implemented in 
order to guarantee a level of CO2 
emissions reductions and fuel savings 
under the attribute-based standards. 
Having developed a set of baseline 
data to which to fit the mathematical 
fuel consumption function, the initial 
values for parameters c and d were 
determined for cars and trucks 
separately. c and d were initially set at 
the values for which the average 
(equivalently, sum) of the absolute 
values of the differences was minimized 
between the ‘‘maximum technology’’ 
fleet fuel consumption (within the 
footprints between the upper and lower

limits) and the straight line the function 
defined above at the same 
corresponding vehicle footprints. That 
is, c and d were determined by 
minimizing the average absolute 
residual, commonly known as the MAD 
(Mean Absolute Deviation) approach, of 
the corresponding straight line. 
Finally, NHTSA calculated the values 
of the upper and lower values (a and b) 
based on the corresponding footprints 
discussed above (41 and 56 square feet 
for passenger cars, and 41 and 66 square 
feet for light trucks). 
The result of this methodology is 
shown below in Figures II.A.2–2 and 
II.A.2–3 for passenger cars and light 
trucks, respectively. The fitted curves 
are shown with the underlying 
‘‘maximum technology’’ passenger car 
and light truck fleets. For passenger 
cars, the mean absolute deviation of the 
sloped portion of the function was 14 
percent. For trucks, the corresponding 
MAD was 10 percent.

The agencies used these functional 
forms as a starting point to develop 
mathematical functions defining the 
actual proposed standards as discussed 
above. The agencies then transposed 
these functions vertically (i.e., on a gpm 
or CO2 basis, uniformly downward) to 
produce the relative car and light truck 
standards described in the next section. 
D. Relative Car-Truck Stringency 
The agencies have determined, under 
their respective statutory authorities, 
that it is appropriate to propose 
fleetwide standards with the projected 
levels of stringency of 34.1 mpg or 250 
g/mi (as well as the corresponding 
intermediate year fleetwide standards) 
for NHTSA and EPA respectively. To 
determine the relative stringency of 
passenger car and light truck standards, 
the agencies are concerned that

car and truck standards (either by

81 For example, since many 2WD SUVs are 
classified as passenger cars, manufacturers have 
already warned that high car standards relative to 
truck standards could create an incentive for them 
to drop the 2WD version and sell only the 4WD 
version. 
raising the car standards or lowering the 
truck standards) could encourage 
manufacturers to build fewer cars and 
more trucks, likely to the detriment of 
fuel economy and CO2 reductions.81 In 
order to maintain consistent car/truck 
standards, the agencies applied a 
constant ratio between the estimated 
average required performance under the 
passenger car and light truck standards, 
in order to maintain a stable set of 
incentives regarding vehicle 
classification. 
To calculate relative car-truck 
stringency in this proposal, the agencies 
explored a number of possible 
alternatives. In the interest of 
harmonization, the agencies agree to use 
the Volpe model in order to estimate 
stringencies at which net benefits would 
be maximized. Further details of the 
development of this scenario approach 
can be found in Section IV of this 
preamble as well as in NHTSA’s PRIA 
and DEIS. NHTSA examined passenger 
car and light truck standards that would 
produce the proposed combined average 
fuel economy levels from Table I.B.2–2 
above. NHTSA did so by shifting 
downward the curves that maximize net 
benefits, holding the relative stringency 
of passenger car and light truck 
standards constant at the level 
determined by maximizing net benefits, 
such that the average fuel economy 
required of passenger cars remains 34 
percent higher than the average fuel 
economy required of light trucks. This 
methodology resulted in the average 
fuel economy levels for passenger cars 
and light trucks during MYs 2012–2016 
as shown in Table I.D.2–1. The 
following chart illustrates this 
methodology of shifting the standards 
from the levels maximizing net benefits 
to the levels consistent with the 
combined fuel economy standards in 
this rule.

After this analysis was completed, 
EPA examined two alternative 
approaches to determine whether they 
would lead to significantly different 
outcomes. First, EPA analyzed the 
relative stringencies using a 10-year 
payback analysis (with the OMEGA 
model). This analysis sets the relative 
stringencies if increased technology cost 
is to be paid back out of fuel savings 
over a 10-year period (assuming a 3% 
discount rate). Second, EPA also 
conducted a technology maximized 
analysis, which sets the relative 
stringencies if all technologies (with the 
exception of strong hybrids and diesels) 
are assumed to be utilized in the fleet. 
(This is the same methodology that was 
used to determine the curve shape as 
explained in the section above and in 
Chapter 2 of the joint TSD section).

Compared to NHTSA’s approach based 
on stringencies estimated to maximize 
net benefits, EPA staff found that these 
two other approaches produced very 
similar results to NHTSA’s, i.e., similar 
ratios of car-truck relative stringency 
(the ratio being within a range of 1.34 
to 1.37 relative stringency of the car to 
the truck fuel economy standard). EPA 
believes that this similarity supports the 
proposed relative stringency of the two 
standards. 
The car and truck standards for EPA 
(Table I.D. 2–4 above) were 
subsequently determined by first 
converting the average required fuel 
economy levels to average required CO2 
emission rates, and then applying the 
expected air conditioning credits for 
2012–2016. These A/C credits are 
shown in the following table. Further 
details of the derivation of these factors 
can be found in Section III of this 
preamble or in the EPA RIA.

The agencies seek comment on the 
use of this methodology for 
apportioning the fleet stringencies to 
relative car and truck standards for 
2012–2016. 
E. Joint Vehicle Technology 
Assumptions 
Vehicle technology assumptions, i.e., 
assumptions about their cost, 
effectiveness, and the rate at which they 
can be incorporated into new vehicles, 
are often very controversial as they have 
a significant impact on the levels of the 
standards. Agencies must, therefore, 
take great care in developing and 
justifying these assumptions. In 
developing technology inputs for MY 
2012–2016 standards, the agencies 
reviewed the technology assumptions 
that NHTSA used in setting the MY 
2011 standards and the comments that 
NHTSA received in response to its May 
2008 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 
This review is consistent with the 
request by President Obama in his 
January 26 memorandum to DOT. In 
addition, the agencies reviewed the 
technology input estimates identified in 
EPA’s July 2008 Advanced Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking. The review of 
these documents was supplemented 
with updated information from more 
current literature, new product plans 
and from EPA certification testing. 
As a general matter, the best way to 
derive technology cost estimates is to 
conduct real-world tear down studies. 
These studies break down each 
technology into its respective 
components, evaluate the costs of each 
component, and build up the costs of 
the entire technology based on the 
contribution of each component. As 
such, tear down studies require a 
significant amount of time and are very 
costly. EPA has begun conducting tear 
down studies to assess the costs of 4– 
5 technologies under a contract with 
FEV. To date, only two technologies 
(stoichiometeric gasoline direct 
injection and turbo charging with 
engine downsizing for a 4 cylinder 
engine to a 4 cylinder engine) have been 
evaluated. The agencies relied on the 
findings of FEV for estimating the cost 
of these technologies in this 
rulemaking—directly for the 4 cylinder 
engines, and extrapolated for the 6 and 
8 cylinder engines. The agencies request 
comment on the use of these estimated 
costs from the FEV study. For the other 
technologies, because tear down studies 
were not yet available, the agencies 
decided to pursue, to the extent 
possible, the Bill of Materials (BOM) 
approach as outlined in NHTSA’s MY 
2011 final rule. A similar approach was 
used by EPA in the EPA 2008 Staff 
Technical Report. This approach was 
recommended to NHTSA by Ricardo, an 
international engineering consulting 
firm retained by NHTSA to aid in the 
analysis of public comments on its 
proposed standards for MYs 2011–2015 
because of its expertise in the area of 
fuel economy technologies. A BOM 
approach is one element of the process 
used in tear down studies. The 
difference is that under a BOM 
approach, the build up of cost estimates 
is conducted based on a review of cost 
and effectiveness estimates for each 
component from available literature, 
while under a tear down study, the cost 
estimates which go into the BOM come 
from the tear down study itself. To the 
extent that the agencies departed from 
the MY 2011 CAFE final rule estimates, 
the agencies explained the reasons and 
provided supporting analyses. As tear 
down studies are concluded by FEV 
during the rulemaking process, the 
agencies will make them available in the 
joint rulemaking docket of this 
rulemaking. The agencies will consider 
these studies and any comments 
received on them, as practicable and 
appropriate, as well as any other new 
information pertinent to the rulemaking 
of which the agencies become aware, in 
developing technology cost assumptions 
for the final rule. 
Similarly, the agencies followed a 
BOM approach for developing its 
effectiveness estimates, insofar as the 
BOM developed for the cost estimates 
helped to inform the appropriate 
effectiveness values derived from the 
literature review. The agencies 
supplemented the information with 
results from available simulation work 
and real world EPA certification testing. 
The agencies would also like to note 
that per the Energy Independence and 
Security Act (EISA), the National 
Academies of Sciences is conducting an 
updated study to update Chapter 3 of 
the 2002 NAS Report, which outlines 
technology estimates. The update will 
take a fresh look at that list of 
technologies and their associated cost 
and effectiveness values. 
The report is expected to be available 
on September 30, 2009. As soon as the 
update to the NAS Report is received, it 
will be placed in the joint rulemaking 
docket for the public’s review and 
comment. Because this will occur 
during the comment period, the public 
is encouraged to check the docket 
regularly and provide comments on the 
updated NAS Report by the closing of 
the comment period of this notice. 
NHTSA and EPA will consider the 
updated NAS Report and any comments 
received, as practicable and appropriate, 
on it when considering revisions to the 
technology cost and effectiveness 
estimates for the final rule.

49500 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Consideration of this report is consistent 
with the request by President Obama in 
his January 26 memorandum to DOT. 
1. What Technologies Do the Agencies 
Consider? 
The agencies considered over 35 
vehicle technologies that manufacturers 
could use to improve the fuel economy 
and reduce CO2 emissions of their 
vehicles during MYs 2012–2016. The 
majority of the technologies described 
in this section are readily available, well 
known, and could be incorporated into 
vehicles once production decisions are 
made. Other technologies considered 
may not currently be in production, but 
are beyond the research phase and 
under development, and are expected to 
be in production in the next few years. 
These are technologies which can, for 
the most part, be applied both to cars 
and trucks, and which are capable of 
achieving significant improvements in 
fuel economy and reductions in CO2 
emissions, at reasonable costs. The 
agencies did not consider technologies 
in the research stage because the 
leadtime available for this rule is not 
sufficient to move such technologies 
from research to production. 
The technologies considered in the 
agencies’ analysis are briefly described 
below. They fall into five broad 
categories: engine technologies, 
transmission technologies, vehicle 
technologies, electrification/accessory 
technologies, and hybrid technologies. 
For a more detailed description of each 
technology and their costs and 
effectiveness, we refer the reader to 
Chapter 3 of the joint TSD, Chapter III 
of NHTSA’s PRIA, and Chapter 1 of 
EPA’s DRIA. Technologies to reduce 
CO2 and HFC emissions from air 
conditioning systems are discussed in 
Section III of this preamble and in EPA’s 
DRIA. 
Types of engine technologies that 
improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 
emissions include the following: 
• Low-friction lubricants—low 
viscosity and advanced low friction 
lubricants oils are now available with 
improved performance and better 
lubrication. If manufacturers choose to 
make use of these lubricants, they 
would need to make engine changes and 
possibly conduct durability testing to 
accommodate the low-friction 
lubricants. 
• Reduction of engine friction 
losses—can be achieved through low- 
tension piston rings, roller cam 
followers, improved material coatings, 
more optimal thermal management, 
piston surface treatments, and other 
improvements in the design of engine 
components and subsystems that 
improve engine operation. 
• Conversion to dual overhead cam 
with dual cam phasing—as applied to 
overhead valves designed to increase 
the air flow with more than two valves 
per cylinder and reduce pumping 
losses. 
• Cylinder deactivation—deactivates 
the intake and exhaust valves and 
prevents fuel injection into some 
cylinders during light-load operation. 
The engine runs temporarily as though 
it were a smaller engine which 
substantially reduces pumping losses. 
• Variable valve timing—alters the 
timing of the intake valve, exhaust 
valve, or both, primarily to reduce 
pumping losses, increase specific 
power, and control residual gases. 
• Discrete variable valve lift— 
increases efficiency by optimizing air 
flow over a broader range of engine 
operation which reduces pumping 
losses. Accomplished by controlled 
switching between two or more cam 
profile lobe heights. 
• Continuous variable valve lift—is 
an electromechanically controlled 
system in which valve timing is 
changed as lift height is controlled. This 
yields a wide range of performance 
optimization and volumetric efficiency, 
including enabling the engine to be 
valve throttled. 
• Stoichiometric gasoline direct- 
injection technology—injects fuel at 
high pressure directly into the 
combustion chamber to improve cooling 
of the air/fuel charge within the 
cylinder, which allows for higher 
compression ratios and increased 
thermodynamic efficiency. 
• Combustion restart—can be used in 
conjunction with gasoline direct- 
injection systems to enable idle-off or 
start-stop functionality. Similar to other 
start-stop technologies, additional 
enablers, such as electric power 
steering, accessory drive components, 
and auxiliary oil pump, might be 
required. 
• Turbocharging and downsizing— 
increases the available airflow and 
specific power level, allowing a reduced 
engine size while maintaining 
performance. This reduces pumping 
losses at lighter loads in comparison to 
a larger engine. 
• Exhaust-gas recirculation boost— 
increases the exhaust-gas recirculation 
used in the combustion process to 
increase thermal efficiency and reduce 
pumping losses. 
• Diesel engines—have several 
characteristics that give superior fuel 
efficiency, including reduced pumping 
losses due to lack of (or greatly reduced) 
throttling, and a combustion cycle that 
operates at a higher compression ratio, 
with a very lean air/fuel mixture, 
relative to an equivalent-performance 
gasoline engine. This technology 
requires additional enablers, such as 
NOx trap catalyst after-treatment or 
selective catalytic reduction NOx after- 
treatment. The cost and effectiveness 
estimates for the diesel engine and 
aftertreatment system utilized in this 
proposal have been revised from the 
NHTSA MY 2011 CAFE final rule, and 
the agencies request comment on these 
diesel cost estimates. 
Types of transmission technologies 
considered include: 
• Improved automatic transmission 
controls—optimizes shift schedule to 
maximize fuel efficiency under wide 
ranging conditions, and minimizes 
losses associated with torque converter 
slip through lock-up or modulation. 
• Six-, seven-, and eight-speed 
automatic transmissions—the gear ratio 
spacing and transmission ratio are 
optimized for a broader range of engine 
operating conditions. 
• Dual clutch or automated shift 
manual transmissions—are similar to 
manual transmissions, but the vehicle 
controls shifting and launch functions. 
A dual-clutch automated shift manual 
transmission uses separate clutches for 
even-numbered and odd-numbered 
gears, so the next expected gear is pre- 
selected, which allows for faster and 
smoother shifting. 
• Continuously variable 
transmission—commonly uses V- 
shaped pulleys connected by a metal 
belt rather than gears to provide ratios 
for operation. Unlike manual and 
automatic transmissions with fixed 
transmission ratios, continuously 
variable transmissions can provide fully 
variable transmission ratios with an 
infinite number of gears, enabling finer 
optimization of transmission torque 
multiplication under different operating 
conditions so that the engine can 
operate at higher efficiency. 
• Manual 6-speed transmission— 
offers an additional gear ratio, often 
with a higher overdrive gear ratio, than 
a 5-speed manual transmission. 
Types of vehicle technologies 
considered include: 
• Low-rolling-resistance tires—have 
characteristics that reduce frictional 
losses associated with the energy 
dissipated in the deformation of the 
tires under load, therefore improving 
fuel economy and reducing CO2 
emissions. 
• Low-drag brakes—reduce the 
sliding friction of disc brake pads on 
rotors when the brakes are not engaged 
because the brake pads are pulled away 
from the rotors.

Effectiveness Estimates of Technologies Used to 
Reduce Light-Duty Vehicle Carbon Dioxide 
Emissions. EPA420–R–08–008, March 2008. 
• Front or secondary axle disconnect 
for four-wheel drive systems—provides 
a torque distribution disconnect 
between front and rear axles when 
torque is not required for the non- 
driving axle. This results in the 
reduction of associated parasitic energy 
losses. 
• Aerodynamic drag reduction—is 
achieved by changing vehicle shape or 
reducing frontal area, including skirts, 
air dams, underbody covers, and more 
aerodynamic side view mirrors. 
• Mass reduction and material 
substitution—Mass reduction 
encompasses a variety of techniques 
ranging from improved design and 
better component integration to 
application of lighter and higher- 
strength materials. Mass reduction is 
further compounded by reductions in 
engine power and ancillary systems 
(transmission, steering, brakes, 
suspension, etc.). The agencies 
recognize there is a range of diversity 
and complexity for mass reduction and 
material substitution technologies and 
there are many techniques that 
automotive suppliers and manufacturers 
are using to achieve the levels of this 
technology that the agencies have 
modeled in our analysis for this 
proposal. The agencies seek comments 
on the methods, costs, and effectiveness 
estimates associated with mass 
reduction and material substitution 
techniques that manufacturers intend to 
employ for reducing fuel consumption 
and CO2 emissions during the 
rulemaking time frame. 
Types of electrification/accessory and 
hybrid technologies considered include: 
• Electric power steering (EPS)—is an 
electrically-assisted steering system that 
has advantages over traditional 
hydraulic power steering because it 
replaces a continuously operated 
hydraulic pump, thereby reducing 
parasitic losses from the accessory 
drive. 
• Improved accessories (IACC)—may 
include high efficiency alternators, 
electrically driven (i.e., on-demand) 
water pumps and cooling fans. This 
excludes other electrical accessories 
such as electric oil pumps and 
electrically driven air conditioner 
compressors. 
• Air Conditioner Systems—These 
technologies include improved hoses, 
connectors and seals for leakage control. 
They also include improved 
compressors, expansion valves, heat 
exchangers and the control of these 
components for the purposes of 
improving tailpipe CO2 emissions as a 
result of A/C use. These technologies 
are covered separately in the EPA RIA. 
• 12-volt micro-hybrid (MHEV)—also 
known as idle-stop or start stop and 
commonly implemented as a 12-volt 
belt-driven integrated starter-generator, 
this is the most basic hybrid system that 
facilitates idle-stop capability. Along 
with other enablers, this system replaces 
a common alternator with a belt-driven 
enhanced power starter-alternator, and a 
revised accessory drive system. 
• Higher Voltage Stop-Start/Belt 
Integrated Starter Generator (BISG)— 
provides idle-stop capability and uses a 
high voltage battery with increased 
energy capacity over typical automotive 
batteries. The higher system voltage 
allows the use of a smaller, more 
powerful electric motor. This system 
replaces a standard alternator with an 
enhanced power, higher voltage, higher 
efficiency starter-alternator, that is belt 
driven and that can recover braking 
energy while the vehicle slows down 
(regenerative braking). 
• Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)/ 
Crank integrated starter generator 
(CISG)—provides idle-stop capability 
and uses a high voltage battery with 
increased energy capacity over typical 
automotive batteries. The higher system 
voltage allows the use of a smaller, more 
powerful electric motor and reduces the 
weight of the wiring harness. This 
system replaces a standard alternator 
with an enhanced power, higher 
voltage, higher efficiency starter- 
alternator that is crankshaft mounted 
and can recover braking energy while 
the vehicle slows down (regenerative 
braking). 
• 2-mode hybrid (2MHEV)—is a 
hybrid electric drive system that uses an 
adaptation of a conventional stepped- 
ratio automatic transmission by 
replacing some of the transmission 
clutches with two electric motors that 
control the ratio of engine speed to 
vehicle speed, while clutches allow the 
motors to be bypassed. This improves 
both the transmission torque capacity 
for heavy-duty applications and reduces 
fuel consumption and CO2 emissions at 
highway speeds relative to other types 
of hybrid electric drive systems. 
• Power-split hybrid (PSHEV)—a 
hybrid electric drive system that 
replaces the traditional transmission 
with a single planetary gearset and a 
motor/generator. This motor/generator 
uses the engine to either charge the 
battery or supply additional power to 
the drive motor. A second, more 
powerful motor/generator is 
permanently connected to the vehicle’s 
final drive and always turns with the 
wheels. The planetary gear splits engine 
power between the first motor/generator 
and the drive motor to either charge the 
battery or supply power to the wheels. 
• Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles 
(PHEV)—are hybrid electric vehicles 
with the means to charge their battery 
packs from an outside source of 
electricity (usually the electric grid). 
These vehicles have larger battery packs 
with more energy storage and a greater 
capability to be discharged. They also 
use a control system that allows the 
battery pack to be substantially depleted 
under electric-only or blended 
mechanical/electric operation. 
• Electric vehicles (EV)—are vehicles 
with all-electric drive and with vehicle 
systems powered by energy-optimized 
batteries charged primarily from grid 
electricity. 
The cost estimates for the various 
hybrid systems have been revised from 
the estimates used in the MY 2011 
CAFE final rule, in particular with 
respect to estimated battery costs. The 
agencies request comment on the hybrid 
cost estimates detailed in the draft Joint 
Technical Support Document. 
2. How Did the Agencies Determine the 
Costs and Effectiveness of Each of These 
Technologies? 
Building on NHTSA’s estimates 
developed for the MY 2011 CAFE final 
rule and EPA’s Advanced Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking, which relied on 
the 2008 Staff Technical Report,82 the 
agencies took a fresh look at technology 
cost and effectiveness values for 
purposes of the joint proposal under the 
National Program. For costs, the 
agencies reconsidered both the direct or 
‘‘piece’’ costs and indirect costs of 
individual components of technologies. 
For the direct costs, the agencies 
followed a bill of materials (BOM) 
approach employed by NHTSA in 
NHTSA’s MY 2011 final rule based on 
recommendation from Ricardo, Inc. EPA 
used a similar approach in the 2008 
EPA Staff Technical Report. A bill of 
materials, in a general sense, is a list of 
components or sub-systems that make 
up a system—in this case, an item of 
fuel economy-improving technology. In 
order to determine what a system costs, 
one of the first steps is to determine its 
components and what they cost. 
NHTSA and EPA estimated these 
components and their costs based on a 
number of sources for cost-related 
information. The objective was to use 
those sources of information considered 
to be most credible for projecting the 
costs of individual vehicle technologies. 
For example, while NHTSA and Ricardo 
engineers had relied considerably in the

91 NHTSA examined the use of the CPI multiplier 
instead of GDP for adjusting these dollar values, but 
found the difference to be exceedingly small—only 
$0.14 over $100. 
MY 2011 final rule on the 2008 Martec 
Report for costing contents of some 
technologies, upon further joint review 
and for purposes of the MY 2012–2016 
standards, the agencies decided that 
some of the costing information in that 
report was no longer accurate due to 
downward trends in commodity prices 
since the publication of that report. The 
agencies reviewed, then revalidated or 
updated cost estimates for individual 
components based on new information. 
Thus, while NHTSA and EPA found 
that much of the cost information used 
in NHTSA’s MY 2011 final rule and 
EPA’s staff report was consistent to a 
great extent, the agencies, in 
reconsidering information from many 
sources,83,84,85,86,87,88,89 revised several 
component costs of several major 
technologies: turbocharging with engine 
downsizing, mild and strong hybrids, 
diesels, stoichiometric gasoline direct 
injection fuel systems, and valve train 
lift technologies. These are discussed at 
length in the joint TSD and in NHTSA’s 
PRIA. 
For two technologies (stoichiometric 
gasoline direct injection and 
turbocharging with engine downsizing), 
the agencies relied, to the extent 
possible, on the tear down data 
available and scaling methodologies 
used in EPA’s ongoing study with FEV. 
This study consists of complete system 
tear-down to evaluate technologies 
down to the nuts and bolts to arrive at 
very detailed estimates of the costs 
associated with manufacturing them.90 
The confidential information provided 
by manufacturers as part of their 
product plan submissions to the 
agencies or discussed in meetings 
between the agencies and the 
manufacturers and suppliers served 
largely as a check on publicly-available 
data. 
For the other technologies, 
considering all sources of information 
and using the BOM approach, the 
agencies worked together intensively 
during the summer of 2009 to determine 
component costs for each of the 
technologies and build up the costs 
accordingly. Where estimates differ 
between sources, we have used 
engineering judgment to arrive at what 
we believe to be the best cost estimate 
available today, and explained the basis 
for that exercise of judgment. 
Once costs were determined, they 
were adjusted to ensure that they were 
all expressed in 2007 dollars using a 
ratio of GDP values for the associated 
calendar years,91 and indirect costs were 
accounted for using the new approach 
developed by EPA and explained in 
Chapter 3 of the draft joint TSD, rather 
than using the traditional Retail Price 
Equivalent (RPE) multiplier approach. A 
report explaining how EPA developed 
this approach can be found in the 
docket for this notice. NHTSA and EPA 
also reconsidered how costs should be 
adjusted by modifying or scaling 
content assumptions to account for 
differences across the range of vehicle 
sizes and functional requirements, and 
adjusted the associated material cost 
impacts to account for the revised 
content, although some of these 
adjustments may be different for each 
agency due to the different vehicle 
subclasses used in their respective 
models. In previous rulemakings, 
NHTSA has used the Producer Price 
Index (PPI) to adjust vehicle technology 
costs to consistent price levels, since the 
PPI measures the effects of cost changes 
that are specific to the vehicle 
manufacturing industry. For purposes of 
this NPRM, NHTSA and EPA chose to 
use the GDP deflator, which accounts 
for the effect of economy-wide price 
inflation on technology cost estimates, 
in order to express those estimates in 
comparable terms with forecasts of fuel 
prices and other economic values used 
in the analysis of costs and benefits 
from the proposed standards. Because it 
is specific to the automotive sector, the 
PPI tends to be highly volatile from year 
to year, reflecting rapidly changing 
balances between supply and demand 
for specific components, rather than 
longer-term trends in the real cost of 
producing a broad range of powertrain 
components. NHTSA and EPA seek 
comment on whether the agencies 
should use a GDP deflator or a PPI 
inflator for purposes of developing 
technology cost estimates for the final 
rule. 
Regarding estimates for technology 
effectiveness, NHTSA and EPA also 
reexamined the estimates from 
NHTSA’s MY 2011 final rule and EPA’s 
ANPRM and 2008 Staff Technical 
Report, which were largely consistent 
with NHTSA’s 2008 NPRM estimates. 
The agencies also reconsidered other 
sources such as the 2002 NAS Report, 
the 2004 NESCCAF report, recent CAFE 
compliance data (by comparing similar 
vehicles with different technologies 
against each other in fuel economy 
testing, such as a Honda Civic Hybrid 
versus a directly comparable Honda 
Civic conventional drive), and 
confidential manufacturer estimates of 
technology effectiveness. NHTSA and 
EPA engineers reviewed effectiveness 
information from the multiple sources 
for each technology and ensured that 
such effectiveness estimates were based 
on technology hardware consistent with 
the BOM components used to estimate 
costs. Together, they compared the 
multiple estimates and assessed their 
validity, taking care to ensure that 
common BOM definitions and other 
vehicle attributes such as performance, 
refinement, and drivability were taken 
into account. However, because the 
agencies’ respective models employ 
different numbers of vehicle subclasses 
and use different modeling techniques 
to arrive at the standards, direct 
comparison of BOMs was somewhat 
more complicated. To address this and 
to confirm that the outputs from the 
different modeling techniques produced 
the same result, NHTSA and EPA 
developed mapping techniques, 
devising technology packages and 
mapping them to corresponding 
incremental technology estimates. This 
approach helped compare the outputs 
from the incremental modeling 
technique to those produced by the 
technology packaging approach to 
ensure results that are consistent and 
could be translated into the respective 
models of the agencies. 
In general, most effectiveness 
estimates used in both the MY 2011 
final rule and the 2008 EPA staff report 
were determined to be accurate and 
were carried forward without significant 
change into this proposal. When 
NHTSA and EPA’s estimates for 
effectiveness diverged slightly due to

differences in how agencies apply 
technologies to vehicles in their 
respective models, we report the ranges 
for the effectiveness values used in each 
model. While the agencies believe that 
the ideal estimates for the final rule 
would be based on tear down studies or 
BOM approach and subjected to a 
transparent peer-reviewed process, 
NHTSA and EPA are confident that the 
thorough review conducted, led to the 
best available conclusion regarding 
technology costs and effectiveness 
estimates for the current rulemaking and 
resulted in excellent consistency 
between the agencies’ respective 
analyses for developing the CAFE and 
CO2 standards. 
The agencies note that the 
effectiveness values estimated for the 
technologies considered in the modeling 
analyses may represent average values, 
and do not reflect the potentially- 
limitless spectrum of possible values 
that could result from adding the 
technology to different vehicles. For 
example, while the agencies have 
estimated an effectiveness of 0.5 percent 
for low friction lubricants, each vehicle 
could have a unique effectiveness 
estimate depending on the baseline 
vehicle’s oil viscosity rating. Similarly, 
the reduction in rolling resistance (and 
thus the improvement in fuel economy 
and the reduction in CO2 emissions) due 
to the application of low rolling 
resistance tires depends not only on the 
unique characteristics of the tires 
originally on the vehicle, but on the 
unique characteristics of the tires being 
applied, characteristics which must be 
balanced between fuel efficiency, safety, 
and performance. Aerodynamic drag 
reduction is much the same—it can 
improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 
emissions, but it is also highly 
dependent on vehicle-specific 
functional objectives. For purposes of 
this NPRM, NHTSA and EPA believe 
that employing average values for 
technology effectiveness estimates, as 
adjusted depending on vehicle subclass, 
is an appropriate way of recognizing the 
potential variation in the specific 
benefits that individual manufacturers 
(and individual vehicles) might obtain 
from adding a fuel-saving technology. 
However, the agencies seek comment on 
whether additional levels of specificity 
beyond that already provided would 
improve the analysis for the final rule, 
and if so, how those levels of specificity 
should be analyzed. 
Chapter 3 of the draft Joint Technical 
Support Document contains a detailed 
description of our assessment of vehicle 
technology cost and effectiveness 
estimates. The agencies note that the 
technology costs included in this NPRM 
take into account only those associated 
with the initial build of the vehicle. The 
agencies seek comment on the 
additional lifetime costs, if any, 
associated with the implementation of 
advanced technologies including 
warranty costs, and maintenance and 
replacement costs such as replacement 
costs for low rolling resistance tires, low 
friction lubricants, and hybrid batteries, 
and maintenance on diesel 
aftertreatment components. 
F. Joint Economic Assumptions 
The agencies’ preliminary analysis of 
alternative CAFE and GHG standards for 
the model years covered by this 
proposed rulemaking rely on a range of 
forecast information, economic 
estimates, and input parameters. This 
section briefly describes the agencies’ 
preliminary choices of specific 
parameter values. These proposed 
economic values play a significant role 
in determining the benefits of both 
CAFE and GHG standards. 
In reviewing these variables and the 
agency’s estimates of their values for 
purposes of this NPRM, NHTSA and 
EPA reconsidered previous comments 
that NHTSA had received and reviewed 
newly available literature. As a 
consequence, the agencies elected to 
revise some economic assumptions and 
parameter estimates, while retaining 
others. Some of the most important 
changes, which are discussed in greater 
detail in the agencies’ respective 
sections below, as well as in Chapter 4 
of the joint TSD and in Chapter VIII of 
NHTSA’s PRIA and Chapter 8 of EPA’s 
DRIA, include significant revisions to 
the markup factors for technology costs; 
reducing the rebound effect from 15 to 
10 percent; and revising the value of 
reducing CO2 emissions based on recent 
interagency efforts to develop estimates 
of this value for government-wide use. 
The agencies seek comment on the 
economic assumptions described below. 
• Costs of fuel economy-improving 
technologies—These estimates are 
presented in summary form above and 
in more detail in the agencies’ 
respective sections of this preamble, in 
Chapter 3 of the joint TSD, and in the 
agencies’ respective RIAs. The 
technology cost estimates used in this 
analysis are intended to represent 
manufacturers’ direct costs for high- 
volume production of vehicles with 
these technologies and sufficient 
experience with their application so that 
all cost reductions due to ‘‘learning 
curve’’ effects have been fully realized. 
Costs are then modified by applying 
near-term indirect cost multipliers 
ranging from 1.11 to 1.64 to the 
estimates of vehicle manufacturers’ 
direct costs for producing or acquiring 
each technology to improve fuel 
economy, depending on the complexity 
of the technology and the time frame 
over which costs are estimated. 
• Potential opportunity costs of 
improved fuel economy—This estimate 
addresses the possibility that achieving 
the fuel economy improvements 
required by alternative CAFE or GHG 
standards would require manufacturers 
to compromise the performance, 
carrying capacity, safety, or comfort of 
their vehicle models. If it did so, the 
resulting sacrifice in the value of these 
attributes to consumers would represent 
an additional cost of achieving the 
required improvements, and thus of 
manufacturers’ compliance with stricter 
standards. Currently the agencies 
assume that these vehicle attributes do 
not change, and include the cost of 
maintaining these attributes as part of 
the cost estimates for technologies. 
However, it is possible that the 
technology cost estimates do not 
include adequate allowance for the 
necessary efforts by manufacturers to 
maintain vehicle performance, carrying 
capacity, and utility while improving 
fuel economy and reducing GHG 
emissions. While, in principle, 
consumer vehicle demand models can 
measure these effects, these models do 
not appear to be robust across 
specifications, since authors derive a 
wide range of willingness-to-pay values 
for fuel economy from these models, 
and there is not clear guidance from the 
literature on whether one specification 
is clearly preferred over another. Thus, 
the agencies seek comment on how to 
estimate explicitly the changes in 
vehicle buyers’ welfare from the 
combination of higher prices for new 
vehicle models, increases in their fuel 
economy, and any accompanying 
changes in vehicle attributes such as 
performance, passenger- and cargo- 
carrying capacity, or other dimensions 
of utility. 
• The on-road fuel economy ‘‘gap’’— 
Actual fuel economy levels achieved by 
light-duty vehicles in on-road driving 
fall somewhat short of their levels 
measured under the laboratory-like test 
conditions used by NHTSA and EPA to 
establish compliance with the proposed 
CAFE and GHG standards. The agencies 
use an on-road fuel economy gap for 
light-duty vehicles of 20 percent lower 
than published fuel economy levels. For 
example, if the measured CAFE fuel 
economy value of a light truck is 20 
mpg, the on-road fuel economy actually 
achieved by a typical driver of that 
vehicle is expected to be 16 mpg

2008), Table 12. Available at http://

95 Vehicles are defined to be of age 1 during the 
calendar year corresponding to the model year in 
which they are produced; thus for example, model 
year 2000 vehicles are considered to be of age 1 
during calendar year 2000, age 2 during calendar 
year 2001, and to reach their maximum age of 26 
years during calendar year 2025. NHTSA considers 
the maximum lifetime of vehicles to be the age after 
which less than 2 percent of the vehicles originally 
produced during a model year remain in service. 
Applying these conventions to vehicle registration 
data indicates that passenger cars have a maximum 
age of 26 years, while light trucks have a maximum 
lifetime of 36 years. See Lu, S., NHTSA, Regulatory 
Analysis and Evaluation Division, ‘‘Vehicle 
Survivability and Travel Mileage Schedules,’’ DOT 
HS 809 952, 8–11 (January 2006). Available at 
http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809952.pdf 
(last accessed July 27, 2009). 
96 For a description of the Survey, see http:// 
nhts.ornl.gov/quickStart.shtml (last accessed July 
27, 2009). 
97 It was not possible to estimate separate growth 
rates in average annual use for cars and light trucks, 
because of the significant reclassification of light 
truck models as passenger cars discussed 
previously. 
98 While the adjustment for future fuel prices 
reduces average mileage at each age from the values 
derived from the 2001 NHTS, the adjustment for 
expected future growth in average vehicle use 
increases it. The net effect of these two adjustments 
is to increase expected lifetime mileage by about 18 
percent for passenger cars and about 16 percent for 
light trucks. 
(20*.80).92 NHTSA previously used this 
estimate in its MY 2011 final rule, and 
the agencies confirmed it based on 
independent analysis for use in this 
NPRM. 
• Fuel prices and the value of saving 
fuel—Projected future fuel prices are a 
critical input into the preliminary 
economic analysis of alternative 
standards, because they determine the 
value of fuel savings both to new 
vehicle buyers and to society. The 
agencies relied on the most recent fuel 
price projections from the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration’s (EIA) 
Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for this 
analysis. Specifically, the agencies used 
the AEO 2009 (April 2009 release) 
Reference Case forecasts of inflation- 
adjusted (constant-dollar) retail gasoline 
and diesel fuel prices, which represent 
the EIA’s most up-to-date estimate of the 
most likely course of future prices for 
petroleum products.93 
EIA’s Updated Reference Case reflects 
the effects of the American 
Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, 
as well as the most recent revisions to 
the U.S. and global economic outlook. 
In addition, it also reflects the 
provisions of the Energy Independence 
and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), 
including the requirement that the 
combined mpg level of U.S. cars and 
light trucks reach 35 miles per gallon by 
model year 2020. Because this provision 
would be expected to reduce future U.S. 
demand for gasoline and other fuels, 
there is some concern about whether the 
AEO 2009 forecast of fuel prices already 
partly reflects the increases in CAFE 
standards considered in this rule, and 
thus whether it is suitable for valuing 
the projected reductions in fuel use. In 
response to this concern, the agencies 
note that EIA issued a revised version of 
AEO 2008 in June 2008, which modified 
its previous December 2007 Early 
Release of AEO 2008 to reflect the 
effects of the recently-passed EISA 
legislation.94 The fuel price forecasts 
reported in EIA’s Revised Release of 
AEO 2008 differed by less than one cent 
per gallon over the entire forecast period 
(2008–230) from those previously issued 
as part of its initial release of AEO 2008. 
Thus, the agencies are reasonably 
confident that the fuel price forecasts 
presented in AEO 2009 and used to 
analyze the value of fuel savings 
projected to result from this rule are not 
unduly affected by the CAFE provisions 
of EISA, and therefore do not cause a 
baseline problem. Nevertheless, the 
agencies request comment on the use of 
the AEO 2009 fuel price forecasts, and 
particularly on the potential impact of 
the EISA-mandated CAFE 
improvements on these projections. 
• Consumer valuation of fuel 
economy and payback period—In 
estimating the value of fuel economy 
improvements that would result from 
alternative CAFE and GHG standards to 
potential vehicle buyers, the agencies 
assume that buyers value the resulting 
fuel savings over only part of the 
expected lifetime of the vehicles they 
purchase. Specifically, we assume that 
buyers value fuel savings over the first 
five years of a new vehicle’s lifetime, 
and that buyers discount the value of 
these future fuel savings using rates of 
3% and 7%. The five-year figure 
represents the current average term of 
consumer loans to finance the purchase 
of new vehicles. 
• Vehicle sales assumptions—The 
first step in estimating lifetime fuel 
consumption by vehicles produced 
during a model year is to calculate the 
number that are expected to be 
produced and sold.95 The agencies 
relied on the AEO 2009 Reference Case 
for forecasts of total vehicle sales, while 
the baseline market forecast developed 
by the agencies (see Section II.B) 
divided total projected sales into sales 
of cars and light trucks. 
• Vehicle survival assumptions—We 
then applied updated values of age- 
specific survival rates for cars and light 
trucks to these adjusted forecasts of 
passenger car and light truck sales to 
determine the number of these vehicles 
remaining in use during each year of 
their expected lifetimes. 
• Total vehicle use—We then 
calculated the total number of miles that 
cars and light trucks produced in each 
model year will be driven during each 
year of their lifetimes using estimates of 
annual vehicle use by age tabulated 
from the Federal Highway 
Administration’s 2001 National 
Household Transportation Survey 
(NHTS),96 adjusted to account for the 
effect on vehicle use of subsequent 
increases in fuel prices. In order to 
insure that the resulting mileage 
schedules imply reasonable estimates of 
future growth in total car and light truck 
use, we calculated the rate of growth in 
annual car and light truck mileage at 
each age that is necessary for total car 
and light truck travel to increase at the 
rates forecast in the AEO 2009 Reference 
Case. The growth rate in average annual 
car and light truck use produced by this 
calculation is approximately 1.1 percent 
per year.97 This rate was applied to the 
mileage figures derived from the 2001 
NHTS to estimate annual mileage 
during each year of the expected 
lifetimes of MY 2012–2016 cars and 
light trucks.98 
• Accounting for the rebound effect of 
higher fuel economy—The rebound 
effect refers to the fraction of fuel 
savings expected to result from an 
increase in vehicle fuel economy— 
particularly an increase required by the 
adoption of higher CAFE and GHG 
standards—that is offset by additional 
vehicle use. The increase in vehicle use 
occurs because higher fuel economy 
reduces the fuel cost of driving, 
typically the largest single component of 
the monetary cost of operating a vehicle, 
and vehicle owners respond to this 
reduction in operating costs by driving 
slightly more. For purposes of this 
NPRM, the agencies have elected to use 
a 10 percent rebound effect in their 
analyses of fuel savings and other 
benefits from higher standards. 
• Benefits from increased vehicle 
use—The increase in vehicle use from 
the rebound effect provides additional 
benefits to their owners, who may make 
more frequent trips or travel farther to 
reach more desirable destinations. This

102 Each gallon of fuel saved is assumed to reduce 
imports of refined fuel by 0.5 gallons, and the 
volume of fuel refined domestically by 0.5 gallons. 
Domestic fuel refining is assumed to utilize 90% 
imported crude petroleum and 10% domestically- 
produced crude petroleum as feedstocks. Together, 
these assumptions imply that each gallon of fuel 
saved will reduce imports of refined fuel and crude 
petroleum by 0.50 gallons + 0.50 gallons*90% = 
0.50 gallons + 0.45 gallons = 0.95 gallons. 
additional travel provides benefits to 
drivers and their passengers by 
improving their access to social and 
economic opportunities away from 
home. The benefits from increased 
vehicle use include both the fuel 
expenses associated with this additional 
travel, and the consumer surplus it 
provides. We estimate the economic 
value of the consumer surplus provided 
by added driving using the conventional 
approximation, which is one half of the 
product of the decline in vehicle 
operating costs per vehicle-mile and the 
resulting increase in the annual number 
of miles driven. Because it depends on 
the extent of improvement in fuel 
economy, the value of benefits from 
increased vehicle use changes by model 
year and varies among alternative 
standards. 
• The value of increased driving 
range—By reducing the frequency with 
which drivers typically refuel their 
vehicles, and by extending the upper 
limit of the range they can travel before 
requiring refueling, improving fuel 
economy and reducing GHG emissions 
thus provides some additional benefits 
to their owners. No direct estimates of 
the value of extended vehicle range are 
readily available, so the agencies’ 
analysis calculates the reduction in the 
annual number of required refueling 
cycles that results from improved fuel 
economy, and applies DOT- 
recommended values of travel time 
savings to convert the resulting time 
savings to their economic value.99 The 
agencies invite comment on the 
assumptions used in this analysis. 
Please see the Chapter 4 of the draft 
Joint TSD for details. 
• Added costs from congestion, 
crashes and noise—Although it 
provides some benefits to drivers, 
increased vehicle use associated with 
the rebound effect also contributes to 
increased traffic congestion, motor 
vehicle accidents, and highway noise. 
Depending on how the additional travel 
is distributed over the day and on where 
it takes place, additional vehicle use can 
contribute to traffic congestion and 
delays by increasing traffic volumes on 
facilities that are already heavily 
traveled during peak periods. These 
added delays impose higher costs on 
drivers and other vehicle occupants in 
the form of increased travel time and 
operating expenses, increased costs 
associated with traffic accidents, and 
increased traffic noise. The agencies rely 
on estimates of congestion, accident, 
and noise costs caused by automobiles 
and light trucks developed by the 
Federal Highway Administration to 
estimate the increased external costs 
caused by added driving due to the 
rebound effect.100 
• Petroleum consumption and import 
externalities—U.S. consumption and 
imports of petroleum products also 
impose costs on the domestic economy 
that are not reflected in the market price 
for crude petroleum, or in the prices 
paid by consumers of petroleum 
products such as gasoline. In economics 
literature on this subject, these costs 
include (1) higher prices for petroleum 
products resulting from the effect of 
U.S. oil import demand on the world oil 
price (‘‘monopsony costs’’); (2) the risk 
of disruptions to the U.S. economy 
caused by sudden reductions in the 
supply of imported oil to the U.S.; and 
(3) expenses for maintaining a U.S. 
military presence to secure imported oil 
supplies from unstable regions, and for 
maintaining the strategic petroleum 
reserve (SPR) to cushion against 
resulting price increases.101 Reducing 
U.S. imports of crude petroleum or 
refined fuels can reduce the magnitude 
of these external costs. Any reduction in 
their total value that results from lower 
fuel consumption and petroleum 
imports represents an economic benefit 
of setting more stringent standards over 
and above the dollar value of fuel 
savings itself. The agencies do not 
include a value for monopsony costs in 
order to be consistent with their use of 
a global value for the social cost of 
carbon. Based on a recently-updated 
ORNL study, we estimate that each 
gallon of fuel saved that results in a 
reduction in U.S. petroleum imports 
(either crude petroleum or refined fuel) 
will reduce the expected costs of oil 
supply disruptions to the U.S. economy 
by $0.169 (2007$). The agencies do not 
include savings in budgetary outlays to 
support U.S. military activities among 
the benefits of higher fuel economy and 
the resulting fuel savings. Each gallon of 
fuel saved as a consequence of higher 
standards is anticipated to reduce total 
U.S. imports of crude petroleum or 
refined fuel by 0.95 gallons.102 
• Air pollutant emissions 
Æ Impacts on criteria air pollutant 
emissions—While reductions in 
domestic fuel refining and distribution 
that result from lower fuel consumption 
will reduce U.S. emissions of criteria 
pollutants, additional vehicle use 
associated with the rebound effect will 
increase emissions of these pollutants. 
Thus the net effect of stricter standards 
on emissions of each criteria pollutant 
depends on the relative magnitudes of 
reduced emissions from fuel refining 
and distribution, and increases in 
emissions resulting from added vehicle 
use. Criteria air pollutants emitted by 
vehicles and during fuel production 
include carbon monoxide (CO), 
hydrocarbon compounds (usually 
referred to as ‘‘volatile organic 
compounds,’’ or VOC), nitrogen oxides 
(NOX), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), 
and sulfur oxides (SOX). It is assumed 
that the emission rates (per mile) stay 
constant for future year vehicles. 
Æ EPA and NHTSA estimate the 
economic value of the human health 
benefits associated with reducing 
exposure to PM2.5 using a ‘‘benefit-per- 
ton’’ method. These PM2.5-related 
benefit-per-ton estimates provide the 
total monetized benefits to human 
health (the sum of reductions in 
premature mortality and premature 
morbidity) that result from eliminating 
one ton of directly emitted PM2.5, or one 
ton of a pollutant that contributes to 
secondarily-formed PM2.5 (such as NOX, 
SOX, and VOCs), from a specified 
source. Chapter 4.2.9 of the Technical 
Support Document that accompanies 
this proposal includes a description of 
these values. 
Reductions in GHG emissions— 
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) occur 
throughout the process of producing 
and distributing transportation fuels, as 
well as from fuel combustion itself. By 
reducing the volume of fuel consumed 
by passenger cars and light trucks, 
higher standards will thus reduce GHG 
emissions generated by fuel use, as well 
as throughout the fuel supply cycle. The 
agencies estimated the increases of 
GHGs other than CO2, including

103 The MOVES model assumes that the per-mile 
rates at which cars and light trucks emit these GHGs 
are determined by the efficiency of fuel combustion 
during engine operation and chemical reactions that 
occur during catalytic after-treatment of engine 
exhaust, and are thus independent of vehicles’ fuel 
consumption rates. Thus MOVES’ emission factors 
for these GHGs, which are expressed per mile of 
vehicle travel, are assumed to be unaffected by 
changes in fuel economy. 
methane and nitrous oxide, from 
additional vehicle use by multiplying 
the increase in total miles driven by cars 
and light trucks of each model year and 
age by emission rates per vehicle-mile 
for these GHGs. These emission rates, 
which differ between cars and light 
trucks as well as between gasoline and 
diesel vehicles, were estimated by EPA 
using its recently-developed Motor 
Vehicle Emission Simulator (Draft 
MOVES 2009).103 Increases in emissions 
of non-CO2 GHGs are converted to 
equivalent increases in CO2 emissions 
using estimates of the Global Warming 
Potential (GWP) of methane and nitrous 
oxide. 
Æ Economic value of reductions in 
CO2 emissions—EPA and NHTSA 
assigned a dollar value to reductions in 
CO2 emissions using the marginal dollar 
value (i.e., cost) of climate-related 
damages resulting from carbon 
emissions, also referred to as ‘‘social 
cost of carbon’’ (SCC). The SCC is 
intended to measure the monetary value 
society places on impacts resulting from 
increased GHGs, such as property 
damage from sea level rise, forced 
migration due to dry land loss, and 
mortality changes associated with 
vector-borne diseases. Published 
estimates of the SCC vary widely as a 
result of uncertainties about future 
economic growth, climate sensitivity to 
GHG emissions, procedures used to 
model the economic impacts of climate 
change, and the choice of discount rates. 
EPA and NHTSA’s coordinated 
proposals present a set of interim SCC 
values reflecting a Federal interagency 
group’s interpretation of the relevant 
climate economics literature. Sections 
III.H and IV.C.3 provide more detail 
about SCC. 
• Discounting future benefits and 
costs—Discounting future fuel savings 
and other benefits is intended to 
account for the reduction in their value 
to society when they are deferred until 
some future date, rather than received 
immediately. The discount rate 
expresses the percent decline in the 
value of these benefits—as viewed from 
today’s perspective—for each year they 
are deferred into the future. In 
evaluating the non-climate related 
benefits of the proposed standards, the 
agencies have employed discount rates 
of both 3 percent and 7 percent. 
For the reader’s reference, Table 
II.F.1–1 below summarizes the values 
used to calculate the impacts of each 
proposed standard. The values 
presented in this table are summaries of 
the inputs used for the models; specific 
values used in the agencies’ respective 
analyses may be aggregated, expanded, 
or have other relevant adjustments. See 
the respective RIAs for details. The 
agencies seek comment on the economic 
assumptions presented in the table and 
discussed below. 
In addition, the agencies have 
conducted a range of sensitivities and 
present them in their respective RIAs. 
For example, NHTSA has conducted a 
sensitivity analysis on several 
assumptions including (1) forecasts of 
future fuel prices, (2) the discount rate 
applied to future benefits and costs, (3) 
the magnitude of the rebound effect, (4) 
the value to the U.S. economy of 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions, (5) 
the monopsony effect, and (6) the 
reduction in external economic costs 
resulting from lower U.S. oil imports. 
This information is provided in 
NHTSA’s PRIA. The agencies will 
consider additional sensitivities for the 
final rule as appropriate, including 
sensitivities on the markup factors 
applied to direct manufacturing costs to 
account for indirect costs (i.e., the 
Indirect Cost Markups (ICMs) which are 
discussed in Sections III and IV), and 
the learning curve estimates used in this 
analysis.

III. EPA Proposal for Greenhouse Gas 
Vehicle Standards 
A. Executive Overview of EPA Proposal 
1. Introduction 
The Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) is proposing to establish 
greenhouse gas emissions standards for 
the largest sources of transportation 
greenhouse gases—light-duty vehicles, 
light-duty trucks, and medium-duty 
passenger vehicles (hereafter light 
vehicles). These vehicle categories, 
which include cars, sport utility 
vehicles, minivans, and pickup trucks 
used for personal transportation, are 
responsible for almost 60% of all U.S. 
transportation related greenhouse gas 
emissions. This action represents the 
first-ever proposal by EPA to regulate 
vehicle greenhouse gas emissions under 
the Clean Air Act (CAA) and would 
establish standards for model years 2012 
and later light vehicles sold in the U.S. 
EPA is proposing three separate 
standards. The first and most important 
is a set of fleet-wide average carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emission standards for 
cars and trucks. These standards are 
based on CO2 emissions-footprint 
curves, where each vehicle has a 
different CO2 emissions compliance 
target depending on its footprint value. 
Vehicle CO2 emissions would be 
measured over the EPA city and 
highway tests. The proposed standard 
allows for credits based on 
demonstrated improvements in vehicle 
air conditioner systems, including both 
efficiency and refrigerant leakage 
improvement, which are not captured 
by the EPA tests. The EPA projects that 
the average light vehicle tailpipe CO2 
level in model year 2011 will be 326 
grams per mile while the average 
vehicle tailpipe CO2 emissions 
compliance level for the proposed 
model year 2016 standard will be 250 
grams per mile, an average reduction of 
23 percent from today’s CO2 levels. 
EPA is also proposing standards that 
will cap tailpipe nitrous oxide (N2O) 
and methane (CH4) emissions at 0.010 
and 0.030 grams per mile, respectively. 
Even after adjusting for the higher 
relative global warming potencies of 
these two compounds, nitrous oxide 
and methane emissions represent less 
than one percent of overall vehicle 
greenhouse gas emissions from new 
vehicles. Accordingly, the goal of these 
two proposed standards is to limit any 
potential increases in the future and not 
to force reductions relative to today’s 
low levels. 
This proposal represents the second- 
phase of EPA’s response to the Supreme 
Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts 
v. EPA 104 which found that greenhouse 
gases were air pollutants for purposes of 
the Clean Air Act. The Court held that 
the Administrator must determine 
whether or not emissions from new 
motor vehicles cause or contribute to air 
pollution which may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger public health or 
welfare, or whether the science is too 
uncertain to make a reasoned decision. 
The Court further ruled that, in make 
these decisions, the EPA Administrator 
is required to follow the language of 
section 202(a) of the CAA. The Court 
remanded the case back to the Agency 
for reconsideration in light of its 
finding. 
The Administrator responded to the 
Court’s remand by issuing two proposed 
findings under section 202(a) of the 
Clean Air Act.105 First, the 
Administrator proposed to find that the 
science supports a positive 
endangerment finding that a mix of 
certain greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere endangers the public health 
and welfare of current and future 
generations. This is referred to as the 
endangerment finding. Second, the 
Administrator proposed to find that the 
emissions of four of these gases—carbon 
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and 
hydrofluorocarbons—from new motor 
vehicles and new motor vehicle engines 
contribute to the atmospheric 
concentrations of these key greenhouse 
gases and hence to the threat of climate 
change. This is referred to as the cause 
and contribute finding. Finalizing this 
proposed light vehicle regulations is 
contingent upon EPA finalizing both the 
endangerment finding and cause or 
contribute finding. Sections III.B.1 
through III.B.4 below provide more 
details on the legal and scientific bases 
for this proposal. 
As discussed in Section I, this GHG 
proposal is part of a joint National 
Program such that a large majority of the 
projected benefits are achieved jointly 
with NHTSA’s proposed CAFE rule 
which is described in detail in Section 
IV of this preamble. EPA’s proposal 
projects total carbon dioxide emissions 
savings of nearly 950 million metric 
tons, and oil savings of 1.8 billion 
barrels over the lifetimes of the vehicles 
sold in model years 2012–2016. EPA 
projects net societal benefits of $192 
billion at a 3 percent discount rate for 
these same vehicles, or $136 billion at 
a 7 percent discount rate (both values 
assume a $20/ton SCC value). 
Accordingly, these proposed light 
vehicle greenhouse gas emissions 
standards would make an important 
‘‘first step’’ contribution as part of the 
National Program toward meeting long- 
term greenhouse gas emissions and 
import oil reduction goals, while 
providing important economic benefits 
as well. 
2. Why is EPA Proposing this Rule? 
This proposal addresses only light 
vehicles. EPA is addressing light 
vehicles as a first step in control of 
greenhouse gas emissions under the 
Clean Air Act for four reasons. First, 
light vehicles are responsible for almost 
60% of all mobile source greenhouse gas 
emissions, a share three times larger 
than any other mobile source subsector, 
and represent about one-sixth of all U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions. Second, 
technology exists that can be readily 
and cost-effectively applied to these 
vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in the near term. Third, EPA 
already has an existing testing and 
compliance program for these vehicles, 
refined since the mid-1970s for 
emissions certification and fuel 
economy compliance, which would 
require only minor modifications to 
accommodate greenhouse gas emissions 
regulations. Finally, this proposal is an 
important first step in responding to the 
Supreme Court’s ruling in 
Massachusetts vs. EPA. In addition, 
EPA is currently evaluating controls for 
motor vehicles other than those covered

by this proposal, and is reviewing seven 
petitions submitted by various States 
and organizations requesting that EPA 
use its Clean Air Act authorities to take 
action to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions from aircraft (under 
§ 231(a)(2)), ocean-going vessels (under 
§ 213(a)(4)), and other nonroad engines 
and vehicle sources (also under 
§ 213(a)(4)). 
a. Light Vehicle Emissions Contribute to 
Greenhouse Gases and the Threat of 
Climate Change 
Greenhouse gases are gases in the 
atmosphere that effectively trap some of 
the Earth’s heat that would otherwise 
escape to space. Greenhouse gases are 
both naturally occurring and 
anthropogenic. The primary greenhouse 
gases of concern are directly emitted by 
human activities and include carbon 
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, 
and sulfur hexafluoride. 
These gases, once emitted, remain in 
the atmosphere for decades to centuries. 
Thus, they become well mixed globally 
in the atmosphere and their 
concentrations accumulate when 
emissions exceed the rate at which 
natural processes remove greenhouse 
gases from the atmosphere. The heating 
effect caused by the human-induced 
buildup of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere is very likely106 the cause of 
most of the observed global warming 
over the last 50 years. The key effects of 
climate change observed to date and 
projected to occur in the future include, 
but are not limited to, more frequent 
and intense heat waves, more severe 
wildfires, degraded air quality, heavier 
and more frequent downpours and 
flooding, increased drought, greater sea 
level rise, more intense storms, harm to 
water resources, continued ocean 
acidification, harm to agriculture, and 
harm to wildlife and ecosystems. A 
detailed explanation of observed and 
projected changes in greenhouse gases 
and climate change and its impact on 
health, society, and the environment is 
included in EPA’s technical support 
document for the recently released 
Proposed Endangerment and Cause or 
Contribute Findings for Greenhouse 
Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean 
Air Act.107 
Transportation sources represent a 
large and growing share of United States 
greenhouse gases and include 
automobiles, highway heavy duty 
trucks, airplanes, railroads, marine 
vessels and a variety of other sources. In 
2006, all transportation sources emitted 
31.5% of all U.S. greenhouse gases, and 
were the fastest-growing source of 
greenhouse gases in the U.S., accounting 
for 47% of the net increase in total U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions from 1990– 
2006.108 The only sector with larger 
greenhouse gas emissions was 
electricity generation which emitted 
33.7% of all U.S. greenhouse gases. 
Light vehicles emit four greenhouse 
gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous 
oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. Carbon 
dioxide (CO2) is the end product of 
fossil fuel combustion. During 
combustion, the carbon stored in the 
fuels is oxidized and emitted as CO2 and 
smaller amounts of other carbon 
compounds.109 Methane (CH4) 
emissions are a function of the methane 
content of the motor fuel, the amount of 
hydrocarbons passing uncombusted 
through the engine, and any post- 
combustion control of hydrocarbon 
emissions (such as catalytic 
converters).110 Nitrous oxide (N2O) (and 
nitrogen oxide (NOX)) emissions from 
vehicles and their engines are closely 
related to air-fuel ratios, combustion 
temperatures, and the use of pollution 
control equipment. For example, some 
types of catalytic converters installed to 
reduce motor vehicle NOX, carbon 
monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon 
emissions can promote the formation of 
N2O.111 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) 
emissions are progressively replacing 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) in 
these vehicles’ cooling and refrigeration 
systems as CFCs and HCFCs are being 
phased out under the Montreal Protocol 
and Title VI of the CAA. There are 
multiple emissions pathways for HFCs 
with emissions occurring during 
charging of cooling and refrigeration 
systems, during operations, and during 
decommissioning and disposal.112 
b. Basis for Action Under Clean Air Act 
Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act 
(CAA) states that ‘‘the Administrator 
shall by regulation prescribe (and from 
time to time revise) * * * standards 
applicable to the emission of any air 
pollutant from any class or classes of 
new motor vehicles * * *, which in his 
judgment cause, or contribute to, air 
pollution which may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger public health or 
welfare.’’ As noted above, the 
Administrator has proposed to find that 
the air pollution of elevated levels of 
greenhouse gas concentrations may 
reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
public health and welfare.113 The 
Administrator has proposed to define 
the air pollution to be the elevated 
concentrations of the mix of six GHGs: 
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and 
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The 
Administrator has further proposed to 
find under CAA section 202(a) that CO2, 
methane, N2O and HFC emissions from 
new motor vehicles and engines 
contribute to this air pollution. This 
preamble describes proposed standards 
that would control emissions of CO2, 
HFCs, nitrous oxide, and methane. 
Standards for these GHGs would only be 
finalized if EPA determines that the 
criteria have been met for endangerment 
by the air pollution, and that emissions 
of GHGs from new motor vehicles or 
engines ‘‘cause or contribute’’ to that air 
pollution. In that case, section 202(a) 
would authorize EPA to issue standards 
applicable to emissions of those 
pollutants. For further discussion of 
EPA’s authority under section 202(a), 
see Section I.C.2 of the proposal. 
There are a variety of other CAA Title 
II provisions that are relevant to 
standards established under section 
202(a). As noted above, the standards 
are applicable to motor vehicles for their 
useful life. EPA has the discretion in 
determining what standard applies over 
the useful life. For example, EPA may 
set a single standard that applies both 
when the vehicles are new and 
throughout the useful life, or where 
appropriate may set a standard that 
varies during the term of useful life, 
such as a standard that is more stringent 
in the early years of the useful life and 
less stringent in the later years.

114 74 FR 18886 (April 24, 2009). 115 The U.S. Climate Change Science Program 
(CCSP) is now called the U.S. Global Change 
Research Program (GCRP). 
116 This figure includes the greenhouse gas 
contributions of light vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, 
and remaining on-highway mobile sources. 
The standards established under CAA 
section 202(a) are implemented and 
enforced through various mechanisms. 
Manufacturers are required to obtain an 
EPA certificate of conformity with the 
section 202 regulations before they may 
sell or introduce their new motor 
vehicle into commerce, according to 
CAA section 206(a). The introduction 
into commerce of vehicles without a 
certificate of conformity is a prohibited 
act under CAA section 203 that may 
subject a manufacturer to civil penalties 
and injunctive actions (see CAA 
sections 204 and 205). Under CAA 
section 206(b), EPA may conduct testing 
of new production vehicles to determine 
compliance with the standards. For in- 
use vehicles, if EPA determines that a 
substantial number of vehicles do not 
conform to the applicable regulations 
then the manufacturer must submit and 
implement a remedial plan to address 
the problem (see CAA section 207(c)). 
There are also emissions-based 
warranties that the manufacturer must 
implement under CAA section 207(a). 
c. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Proposal 
Under Section 202(a) Concerning 
Endangerment and Cause or Contribute 
Findings 
EPA’s Administrator recently signed a 
proposed action with two distinct 
findings regarding greenhouse gases 
under section 202(a) of the Clean Air 
Act. This action is called the Proposed 
Endangerment and Cause or Contribute 
Findings for Greenhouse Gases under 
the Clean Air Act (Endangerment 
Proposal).114 The Administrator 
proposed an affirmative endangerment 
finding that the current and projected 
concentrations of a mix of six key 
greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide 
(N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur 
hexafluoride(SF6)—in the atmosphere 
threaten the public health and welfare 
of current and future generations. She 
also proposed to find that the combined 
emissions of four of the gases—carbon 
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and 
hydrofluorocarbons from new motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engines— 
contribute to the atmospheric 
concentrations of these greenhouse 
gases and therefore to the climate 
change problem. 
Specifically, the Administrator 
proposed, after a thorough examination 
of the scientific evidence on the causes 
and impact of current and future climate 
change, to find that the science 
compellingly supports a positive finding 
that atmospheric concentrations of these 
greenhouse gases result in air pollution 
which may reasonably be anticipated to 
endanger both public health and 
welfare. In her proposed finding, the 
Administrator relied heavily upon the 
major findings and conclusions from the 
recent assessments of the U.S. Climate 
Change Science Program and the U.N. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change.115 The Administrator proposed 
a positive endangerment finding after 
considering both observed and projected 
future effects of climate change, key 
uncertainties, and the full range of risks 
and impacts to public health and 
welfare occurring within the United 
States. In addition, the proposed finding 
noted that the evidence concerning risks 
and impacts occurring outside the U.S. 
provided further support for the 
proposed finding. 
The key scientific findings supporting 
the proposed endangerment finding are 
that: 
—Concentrations of greenhouse gases 
are at unprecedented levels compared 
to recent and distant past. These high 
concentrations are the unambiguous 
result of anthropogenic emissions and 
are very likely the cause of the 
observed increase in average 
temperatures and other climatic 
changes. 
—The effects of climate change 
observed to date and projected to 
occur in the future include more 
frequent and intense heat waves, more 
severe wildfires, degraded air quality, 
heavier downpours and flooding, 
increasing drought, greater sea level 
rise, more intense storms, harm to 
water resources, harm to agriculture, 
and harm to wildlife and ecosystems. 
These impacts are effects on public 
health and welfare within the 
meaning of the Clean Air Act. 
With regard to new motor vehicles 
and engines, the Administrator also 
proposed a finding that the combined 
emissions of four greenhouse gases— 
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide 
and hydrofluorocarbons—from new 
motor vehicles and engines contributes 
to this air pollution, i.e., the 
atmospheric concentrations of the mix 
of six greenhouse gases which create the 
threat of climate change and its impacts. 
Key facts supporting the proposed cause 
and contribute finding for on-highway 
vehicles regulated under section 202(a) 
of the Clean Air Act are that these 
sources are responsible for 24% of total 
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and 
more than 4% of total global greenhouse 
gas emissions.116 The Administrator 
also considered whether emissions of 
each greenhouse gas individually, as a 
separate air pollutant, would contribute 
to this air pollution. 
If the Administrator makes affirmative 
findings under section 202(a) on both 
endangerment and cause or contribute, 
then EPA is to issue standards 
‘‘applicable to emission’’ of the air 
pollutant or pollutants that EPA finds 
causes or contributes to the air pollution 
that endangers public health and 
welfare. The Endangerment Proposal 
invited public comment on whether the 
air pollutant should be considered the 
group of GHGs, or whether each GHG 
should be treated as a separate air 
pollutant. Either way, the emissions 
standards proposed today would satisfy 
the requirements of section 202(a) as the 
Administrator has significant discretion 
in how to structure the standards that 
apply to the emission of the air 
pollutant or air pollutants at issue. For 
example, under either approach EPA 
would have the discretion under section 
202(a) to adopt separate standards for 
each GHG, a single composite standard 
covering various gases, or any 
combination of these. In this rulemaking 
EPA is proposing separate standards for 
nitrous oxide and methane, and a CO2 
standard that provides for credits based 
on reductions of HFCs, as the 
appropriate way to issue standards 
applicable to emissions of these GHGs. 
3. What is EPA Proposing? 
a. Proposed Light-Duty Vehicle, Light- 
Duty Truck, and Medium-Duty 
Passenger Vehicle Greenhouse Gas 
Emission Standards and Projected 
Compliance Levels 
The CO2 emissions standards are by 
far the most important of the three 
standards and are the primary focus of 
this summary. EPA is proposing an 
attribute-based approach for the CO2 
fleet-wide standard (one for cars and 
one for trucks), based on vehicle 
footprint as the attribute. These curves 
establish different CO2 emissions targets 
for each unique car and truck footprint. 
Generally, the larger the vehicle 
footprint, the higher the corresponding 
vehicle CO2 emissions target. Table 
III.A.3–1 shows the greenhouse gas 
standards for light vehicles that EPA is 
proposing for model years (MY) 2012 
and later:

117 While over 99 percent of the carbon in 
automotive fuels is converted to CO2 in a properly 
functioning engine, compliance with the CO2 
standard will also account for the very small levels 
of carbon associated with vehicle tailpipe 
hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) 
emissions, converted to CO2 on a mass basis, as 
discussed further in section x. 
118 CO2-e refers to CO2-equivalent, and is a metric 
that allows non-CO2 greenhouse gases (such as 
hydrofluorocarbons used as automotive air 
conditioning refrigerants) to be expressed as an 
equivalent mass (i.e., corrected for relative global 
warming potency) of CO2 emissions. 
119 FTP is the Federal Test Procedure which uses 
what is commonly referred to as the ‘‘city’’ driving 
schedule, and HFET is the Highway Fuel Economy 
Test which uses the ‘‘highway’’ driving schedule. 
Compliance with the CO2 standard will be based on 
the same 2-cycle values that are currently used for 
CAFE standards compliance; EPA projects that 
fleet-wide in-use or real world CO2 emissions are 
approximately 25 percent higher, on average, than 
2-cycle CO2 values.

One important flexibility associated 
with the proposed CO2 standard is the 
proposed option for manufacturers to 
obtain credits associated with 
improvements in their air conditioning 
systems. As will be discussed in greater 
detail in later sections, EPA is 
establishing test procedures and design 
criteria by which manufacturers can 
demonstrate improvements in both air 
conditioner efficiency (which reduces 
vehicle tailpipe CO2 by reducing the 
load on the engine) and air conditioner 
refrigerants (using lower global warming 
potency refrigerants and/or improving 
system design to reduce GHG emissions 
associated with leaks). Neither of these 
strategies to reduce GHG emissions from 
air conditioners would be reflected in 
the EPA FTP or HFET tests. These 
improvements would be translated to a 
g/mi CO2-equivalent credit that can be 
subtracted from the manufacturer’s 
tailpipe CO2 compliance value. EPA 
expects a high percentage of 
manufacturers to take advantage of this 
flexibility to earn air conditioning- 
related credits for MY2012–2016 
vehicles such that the average credit 
earned is about 11 grams per mile CO2– 
equivalent in 2016. 
A second flexibility being proposed is 
CO2 credits for flexible and dual fuel 
vehicles, similar to the CAFE credits for 
such vehicles which allow 
manufacturers to gain up to 1.2 mpg in 
their overall CAFE ratings. The Energy 
Independence and Security Act of 2007 
(EISA) mandated a phase-out of these 
flexible fuel vehicle CAFE credits 
beginning in 2015, and ending after 
2019. EPA is proposing to allow 
comparable CO2 credits for flexible fuel 
vehicles through MY 2015, but for MY 
2016 and beyond, EPA is proposing to 
treat flexible and dual fuel vehicles on 
a CO2-performance basis, calculating the 
overall CO2 emissions for flexible and 
dual fuel vehicles based on a fuel use- 
weighted average of the CO2 levels on 
gasoline and on a manufacturer’s 
demonstrated actual usage of the 
alternative fuel in its vehicle fleet. 
Table III.A.3–2 summarizes EPA 
projections of industry-wide 2-cycle 
CO2 emissions and fuel economy levels 
that would be achieved by manufacturer 
compliance with the proposed GHG 
standards for MY2012–2016. 
For MY2011, Table III.A.3–2 uses the 
projected NHTSA compliance values for 
its MY2011 CAFE standards of 30.2 mpg 
for cars and 24.1 mpg for trucks, 
converted to an equivalent combined 
car and truck CO2 level of 325 grams per 
mile.120 EPA believes this is a 
reasonable estimate with which to 
compare the proposed MY2012–2016 
CO2 emission standards. Identifying the 
proper MY2011 estimate is complicated 
for many reasons, among them being the 
turmoil in the current automotive 
market for consumers and 
manufacturers, uncertain and volatile 
oil and gasoline prices, the ability of 
manufacturers to use flexible fuel 
vehicle credits to meet MY2011 CAFE 
standards, and the fact that most 
manufacturers have been surpassing 
CAFE standards (particularly the car 
standard) in recent years. Taking all of 
these considerations into account, EPA 
believes that the MY2011 projected 
CAFE compliance values, converted to 
CO2 emissions levels, represent a 
reasonable estimate. 
Table III.A.3–2 shows projected 
industry-wide average CO2 emissions 
values. The Projected CO2 Emissions for 
the Footprint-Based Standard column 
shows the CO2 g/mi level corresponding 
with the footprint standard that must be 
met. It is based on the proposed CO2- 
footprint curves and projected footprint 
values, and will decrease each year to 
250 grams per mile (g/mi) in MY2016. 
For MY2012–2015, the emissions 
impact of the projected utilization of 
flexible fuel vehicle (FFV) credits and 
the temporary lead-time allowance 
alternative standard (TLAAS, discussed 
below) are shown in the next two 
columns. Neither of these programs is 
proposed to be available in MY2016. 
The Projected CO2 Emissions column 
gives the CO2 emissions levels projected 
to be achieved given use of the flexible 
fuel credits and temporary lead-time 
allowance program. This column shows 
that, relative to the MY 2011 estimate, 
EPA projects that MY2016 CO2 
emissions will be reduced by 23 percent 
over five years. The Projected A/C 
Credit column represents the industry 
wide average air conditioner credit 
manufacturers are expected to earn on 
an equivalent CO2 gram per mile basis 
in a given model year. In MY2016, the 
projected A/C credit of 10.6 g/mi 
represents 14 percent of the 75 g/mi CO2 
emissions reductions associated with 
the proposed standards. The Projected 
2-cycle CO2 Emissions column shows 
the projected CO2 emissions as 
measured over the EPA 2-cycle tests, 
which would allow compliance with the 
standard assuming utilization of the 
projected FFV, TLAAS, and A/C credits.

EPA is also proposing a series of 
flexibilities for compliance with the CO2 
standard which are not expected to 
significantly affect the projected 
compliance and achieved values shown 
above, but which should significantly 
reduce the costs of achieving those 
reductions. These flexibilities include 
the ability to earn: annual credits for a 
manufacturer’s over-compliance with its 
unique fleet-wide average standard, 
early credits from MY2009–2011, 
credits for early introduction of 
advanced technology vehicles, credit for 
‘‘off-cycle’’ CO2 reductions not reflected 
in CO2/fuel economy tests, as well as 
the carry-forward and carry-backward of 
credits, the ability to transfer credits 
between a manufacturer’s car and truck 
fleets, and a temporary lead-time 
allowance alternative standard 
(included in the tables above) that will 
permit manufacturers with less than 
400,000 vehicles produced in MY 2009 
to designate a fraction of their vehicles 
to meet a 25% higher CO2 standard for 
MY 2012–2015. All of these proposed 
flexibilities are discussed in greater 
detail in later sections. 
EPA is also proposing caps on the 
tailpipe emissions of nitrous oxide 
(N2O) and methane (CH4)—0.010 g/mi 
for N2O and 0.030 g/mi for CH4—over 
the EPA FTP test. While N2O and CH4 
can be potent greenhouse gases on a 
relative mass basis, their emission levels 
from modern vehicle designs are 
extremely low and represent only about 
1% of total light vehicle GHG emissions. 
These cap standards are designed to 
ensure that N2O and CH4 emissions 
levels do not rise in the future, rather 
than to force reductions in the already 
low emissions levels. Accordingly, these 
standards are not designed to require 
automakers to make any changes in 
current vehicle designs, and thus EPA is 
not projecting any environmental or 
economic impacts associated with these 
proposed standards. 
EPA has attempted to build on 
existing practice wherever possible in 
designing a compliance program for the 
proposed GHG standards. In particular, 
the program structure proposed will 
streamline the compliance process for 
both manufacturers and EPA by 
enabling manufacturers to use a single 
data set to satisfy both the new GHG and 
CAFE testing and reporting 
requirements. Timing of certification, 
model-level testing, and other 
compliance activities also follow 
current practices established under the 
Tier 2 and CAFE programs. 
b. Environmental and Economic 
Benefits and Costs of EPA’s Proposed 
Standards 
In Table III.A.3–3 EPA presents 
estimated annual net benefits for the 
indicated calendar years. The table also 
shows the net present values of those 
benefits for the calendar years 2012– 
2050 using both a 3% and a 7% 
discount rate. As discussed previously, 
EPA recognizes that much of these same 
costs and benefits are also attributed to 
the proposed CAFE standard contained 
in this joint proposal.

a Quantified annual costs are negative because fuel savings are included as negative costs (i.e., positive savings). Since the fuel savings out-
weigh the vehicle technology costs, the costs of as presented here are actually negative (i.e., they represent savings). 
b Note that the co-pollutant impacts associated with the standards presented here do not include the full complement of endpoints that, if quan-
tified and monetized, would change the total monetized estimate of rule-related impacts. Instead, the co-pollutant benefits are based on benefit- 
per-ton values that reflect only human health impacts associated with reductions in PM2.5 exposure. Ideally, human health and environmental 
benefits would be based on changes in ambient PM2.5 and ozone as determined by full-scale air quality modeling. However, EPA was unable to 
conduct a full-scale air quality modeling analysis in time for the proposal. EPA does intend to more fully capture the co-pollutant benefits for the 
analysis of the final standards. 
c The PM2.5-related benefits (derived from benefit-per-ton values) presented in this table are based on an estimate of premature mortality de-
rived from the ACS study (Pope et al., 2002). If the benefit-per-ton estimates were based on the Six Cities study (Laden et al., 2006), the values 
would be approximately 145% (nearly two-and-a-half times) larger. 
d The PM2.5-related benefits (derived from benefit-per-ton values) presented in this table assume a 3% discount rate in the valuation of pre-
mature mortality to account for a twenty-year segmented cessation lag. If a 7% discount rate had been used, the values would be approximately 
9% lower. 
e Calculated using pre-tax fuel prices. 
4. Basis for the Proposed GHG 
Standards Under Section 202(a) 
EPA statutory authority under section 
202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) is 
discussed in more detail in Section 
I.C.2. The following is a summary of the 
basis for the proposed standards under 
section 202(a), which is discussed in 
more detail in the following portions of 
Section III. 
With respect to CO2 and HFCs, EPA 
is proposing attribute-based light-duty 
car and truck standards that achieve 
large and important emissions 
reductions of GHGs. EPA has evaluated 
the technological feasibility of the 
proposed standards, and the 
information and analysis performed by 
EPA indicates that these standards are 
feasible in the lead time provided. EPA 
and NHTSA have carefully evaluated 
the effectiveness of individual 
technologies as well as the interactions 
when technologies are combined. EPA’s 
projection of the technology that would 
be used to comply with the proposed 
standards indicates that manufacturers 
will be able to meet the proposed 
standards by employing a wide variety 
of technology that is already 
commercially available and can be 
incorporated into their vehicle at the 
time of redesign. In addition to the use 
of the manufacturers’ redesign cycle, 
EPA’s analysis also takes into account 
certain flexibilities that will facilitate 
compliance especially in the early years 
of the program when potential lead time 
constraints are most challenging. These 
flexibilities include averaging, banking, 
and trading of various types of credits. 
For the industry as a whole, EPA’s 
projections indicate that the proposed 
standards can be met using technology 
that will be available in the lead-time 
provided. 
To account for additional lead-time 
concerns for various manufacturers of 
typically higher performance vehicles, 
EPA is proposing a Temporary Lead- 
time Allowance that will further 
facilitate compliance for limited 
volumes of such vehicles in the 
program’s initial years. For a few very 
small volume manufacturers, EPA 
projects that manufacturers will likely 
comply using a combination of credits 
and technology. 
EPA has also carefully considered the 
cost to manufacturers of meeting the 
standards, estimating piece costs for all 
candidate technologies, direct 
manufacturing costs, cost markups to 
account for manufacturers’ indirect 
costs, and manufacturer cost reductions 
attributable to learning. In estimating 
manufacturer costs, EPA took into 
account manufacturers’ own standard 
practices such as making major changes 
to model technology packages during a 
planned redesign cycle. EPA then 
projected the average cost across the 
industry to employ this technology, as 
well as manufacturer-by-manufacturer 
costs. EPA considers the per vehicle 
costs estimated from this analysis to be 
well within a reasonable range in light 
of the emissions reductions and benefits 
received. EPA projects, for example, that 
the fuel savings over the life of the 
vehicles will more than offset the 
increase in cost associated with the 
technology used to meet the standards. 
EPA has also evaluated the impacts of 
these standards with respect to 
reductions in GHGs and reductions in 
oil usage. For the lifetime of the model 
year 2012–2016 vehicles we estimate 
GHG reductions of approximately 950 
million metric tons CO2 eq. and fuel 
reductions of 1.8 billion barrels of oil. 
These are important and significant 
reductions that would be achieved by 
the proposed standards. EPA has also 
analyzed a variety of other impacts of 
the standards, ranging from the 
standards’ effects on emissions of non- 
GHG pollutants, impacts on noise, 
energy, safety and congestion. EPA has 
also quantified the cost and benefits of 
the proposed standards, to the extent 
practicable. Our analysis to date 
indicates that the overall quantified 
benefits of the proposed standards far 
outweigh the projected costs. Utilizing a 
3% discount rate and a $20 per ton 
social cost of carbon we estimate the 
total net social benefits over the life of 
the model year 2012–2016 vehicles is 
$192 billion, and the net present value 
of the net social benefits of the 
standards through the year 2050 is $1.9 
trillion dollars. These values are 
estimated at $136 billion and $787 
billion, respectively, using a 7% 
discount rate and the $20 per ton SCC 
value. 
Under section 202(a) EPA is called 
upon to set standards that provide 
adequate lead-time for the development 
and application of technology to meet 
the standards. EPA’s proposed 
standards satisfy this requirement, as 
discussed above. In setting the 
standards, EPA is called upon to weigh 
and balance various factors, and to 
exercise judgment in setting standards 
that are a reasonable balance of the 
relevant factors. In this case, EPA has 
considered many factors, such as cost, 
impacts on emissions (both GHG and 
non-GHG), impacts on oil conservation, 
impacts on noise, energy, safety, and 
other factors, and has where practicable 
quantified the costs and benefits of the 
rule. In summary, given the technical 
feasibility of the standard, the moderate 
cost per vehicle in light of the savings 
in fuel costs over the life time of the 
vehicle, the very significant reductions

49513 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
121 As described in Section III.B.2., EPA is 
proposing for purposes of GHG emissions standards 
to use the same vehicle category definitions as are 
used in the CAFE program. 
in emissions and in oil usage, and the 
significantly greater quantified benefits 
compared to quantified costs, EPA is 
confident that the proposed standards 
are an appropriate and reasonable 
balance of the factors to consider under 
section 202(a). See Husqvarna AB v. 
EPA, 254 F.3d 195, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2001) 
(great discretion to balance statutory 
factors in considering level of 
technology-based standard, and 
statutory requirement ‘‘to [give 
appropriate] consideration to the cost of 
applying * * * technology’’ does not 
mandate a specific method of cost 
analysis); see also Hercules Inc. v. EPA, 
598 F.2d 91, 106 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (‘‘In 
reviewing a numerical standard we 
must ask whether the agency’s numbers 
are within a zone of reasonableness, not 
whether its numbers are precisely 
right’’); Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 
390 U.S. 747, 797 (1968) (same); Federal 
Power Commission v. Conway Corp., 
426 U.S. 271, 278 (1976) (same); Exxon 
Mobil Gas Marketing Co. v. FERC, 297 
F.3d 1071, 1084 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (same). 
EPA recognizes that the vast majority 
of technology which we are considering 
for purposes of setting standards under 
section 202(a) is commercially available 
and already being utilized to a limited 
extent across the fleet. The vast majority 
of the emission reductions which would 
result from this proposed rule would 
result from the increased use of these 
technologies. EPA also recognizes that 
this proposed rule would enhance the 
development and limited use of more 
advanced technologies, such as PHEVs 
and EVs. In this technological context, 
there is no clear cut line that indicates 
that only one projection of technology 
penetration could potentially be 
considered feasible for purposes of 
section 202(a), or only one standard that 
could potentially be considered a 
reasonable balancing of the factors 
relevant under section 202(a). EPA has 
therefore evaluated two sets of 
alternative standards, one more 
stringent than the proposed standards 
and one less stringent. 
The alternatives are 4% per year 
increase in standards which would be 
less stringent than our proposal and a 
6% per year increase in the standards 
which would be more stringent than our 
proposal. EPA is not proposing either of 
these. As discussed in Section III.D.7, 
the 4% per year compared to the 
proposal forgoes CO2 reductions which 
can be achieved at reasonable costs and 
are achievable by the industry within 
the rule’s timeframe. The 6% per year 
alternative requires a significant 
increase in the projected required 
technology which may not be 
achievable in this timeframe due to the 
limited available lead time and the 
current difficult financial condition of 
the automotive industry. (See Section 
III.D.7 for a detailed discussion of why 
EPA is not proposing either of the 
alternatives.) EPA thus believes that it is 
appropriate to propose the CO2 
standards discussed above. EPA invites 
comment on all aspects of this 
judgment, as well as comment on the 
alternative standards. 
EPA is also proposing standards for 
N2O and CH4. EPA has designed these 
standards to act as emission rate (i.e., 
gram per mile) caps and to avoid future 
increases in light duty vehicle 
emissions. As discussed in Section 
III.B.6, N2O and CH4 emissions are 
already generally well controlled by 
current emissions standards, and EPA 
has not identified clear technological 
steps available to manufacturers today 
that would significantly reduce current 
emission levels for the vast majority of 
vehicles manufactured today (i.e., 
stoichiometric gasoline vehicles). 
However, for both N2O and CH4, some 
vehicle technologies (and, for CH4, use 
of natural gas fuel) could potentially 
increase emissions of these GHGs in the 
future, and EPA believes it is important 
that this be avoided. EPA expects that, 
almost universally across current car 
and truck designs, manufacturers will 
be able to meet the ‘‘cap’’ standards 
with little if any technological 
improvements or cost. EPA has 
designed the level of the N2O and CH4 
standards with the intent that 
manufacturers would be able to meet 
them without the need for technological 
improvement; in other words, these 
emission standards are designed to be 
‘‘anti-backsliding’’ standards. 
B. Proposed GHG Standards for Light- 
Duty Vehicles, Light-Duty Trucks, and 
Medium-Duty Passenger Vehicles 
EPA is proposing new emission 
standards to control greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) from light-duty vehicles. First, 
EPA is proposing emission standards for 
carbon dioxide (CO2) on a gram per mile 
(g/mile) basis that would apply to a 
manufacturer’s fleet of cars, and a 
separate standard that would apply to a 
manufacturer’s fleet of trucks. CO2 is the 
primary pollutant resulting from the 
combustion of vehicular fuels, and the 
amount of CO2 emitted is directly 
correlated to the amount of fuel 
consumed. Second, EPA is providing 
auto manufacturers with the 
opportunity to earn credits toward the 
fleet-wide average CO2 standards for 
improvements to air conditioning 
systems, including both 
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant 
losses (i.e., system leakage) and indirect 
CO2 emissions related to the increased 
load on the engine. Third, EPA is 
proposing separate emissions standards 
for two other GHG pollutants: Methane 
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). CH4 and 
N2O emissions relate closely to the 
design and efficient use of emission 
control hardware (i.e., catalytic 
converters). The standards for CH4 and 
N2O would be set as a cap that would 
limit emissions increases and prevent 
backsliding from current emission 
levels. The proposed standards 
described below would apply to 
passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and 
medium-duty passenger vehicles 
(MDPVs). As an overall group, they are 
referred to in this preamble as light 
vehicles or simply as vehicles. In this 
preamble section passenger cars may be 
referred to simply as ‘‘cars’’, and light- 
duty trucks and MDPVs as ‘‘light 
trucks’’ or ‘‘trucks.’’ 121 
EPA is establishing a system of 
averaging, banking, and trading of 
credits integral to the fleet averaging 
approach, based on manufacturer fleet 
average CO2 performance, as discussed 
in Section III.B.4. This approach is 
similar to averaging, banking, and 
trading (ABT) programs EPA has 
established in other programs and is 
also similar to provisions in the CAFE 
program. In addition to traditional ABT 
credits based on the fleet emissions 
average, EPA is also proposing to 
include A/C credits as an aspect of the 
standards, as mentioned above. EPA is 
also proposing several additional credit 
provisions that apply only in the initial 
model years of the program. These 
include flex fuel vehicle credits, credits 
based on the use of advanced 
technologies, and generation of credits 
prior to model year 2012. The proposed 
A/C credits and additional credit 
opportunities are described in Section 
III.C. These credit programs would 
provide flexibility to manufacturers, 
which may be especially important 
during the early transition years of the 
program. EPA is also proposing to allow 
a manufacturer to carry a deficit into the 
future for a limited number of model 
years. A parallel provision, referred to 
as credit carry-back, is proposed as part 
of the CAFE program. 
1. What Fleet-Wide Emissions Levels 
Correspond to the CO2 Standards? 
The proposed attribute-based CO2 
standards, if made final, are projected to 
achieve a national fleet-wide average, 
covering both light cars and trucks, of

122 See CAA section 202(a)(2). 123 These levels do not include the effect of 
flexible fuel credits, transfer of credits between cars 
and trucks, temporary lead time allowance, or any 
other credits. 
250 grams/mile of CO2 in model year 
(MY) 2016. This includes CO2- 
equivalent emission reductions from 
A/C improvements, reflected as credits 
in the standard. The standards would 
begin with MY 2012, with a generally 
linear increase in stringency from MY 
2012 through MY 2016. EPA is 
proposing separate standards for cars 
and light trucks. The tables in this 
section below provide overall fleet 
average levels that are projected for both 
cars and light trucks over the phase-in 
period which is estimated to correspond 
with the proposed standards. The actual 
fleet-wide average g/mi level that will 
be achieved in any year for cars and 
trucks will depend on the actual 
production for that year, as well as the 
use of the various credit and averaging, 
banking, and trading provisions. For 
example, in any year, manufacturers 
may generate credits from cars and use 
them for compliance with the truck 
standard. Such transfer of credits 
between cars and trucks is not reflected 
in the table below. In Section III.F, the 
year-by-year estimate of emissions 
reductions that are projected to be 
achieved by the proposed standards are 
discussed. 
In general, the proposed schedule of 
standards acts as a phase-in to the MY 
2016 standards, and reflects 
consideration of the appropriate lead- 
time for each manufacturer to 
implement the requisite emission 
reductions technology across its product 
line.122 Note that 2016 is the final model 
year in which standards become more 
stringent. The 2016 CO2 standards 
would remain in place for 2017 and 
later model years, until revised by EPA 
in a future rulemaking. 
EPA estimates that, on a combined 
fleet-wide national basis, the proposed 
2016 MY standards would achieve a 
level of 250 g/mile CO2, including CO2- 
equivalent credits from A/C related 
reductions. The derivation of the 250 g/ 
mile estimate is described in Section 
III.B.2. 
EPA has estimated the overall fleet- 
wide CO2-equivalent emission levels 
that correspond with the proposed 
attribute-based standards, based on the 
projections of the composition of each 
manufacturer’s fleet in each year of the 
program. Tables III.B.1–1 and III.B.1–2 
provide these estimates for each 
manufacturer.123

As shown in Table III.B.1–3, fleet- 
wide CO2-equivalent emission levels for 
cars under the proposed approach are 
projected to decrease from 261 to 224 
grams per mile between MY 2012 and 
MY 2016. Similarly, fleet-wide CO2- 
equivalent emission levels for trucks are 
projected to decrease from 352 to 303 
grams per mile. These numbers do not 
include the effects of other flexibilities 
and credits in the program. The 
estimated achieved values can be found 
in Chapter 5 of the Draft Regulatory 
Impact Analysis (DRIA). 
EPA has also estimated the average 
fleet-wide levels for the combined car 
and truck fleets. These levels are 
provided in Table III.B.1–4. As shown, 
the overall fleet average CO2 level is 
expected to be 250 g/mile in 2016.

As noted above, EPA is proposing 
standards that would result in 
increasingly stringent levels of CO2 
control from MY 2012 though MY 
2016—applying the CO2 footprint 
curves applicable in each model year to 
the vehicles expected to be sold in each 
model year produces fleet-wide annual 
reductions in CO2 emissions. As 
explained in Section III.D below and the 
relevant support documents, EPA 
believes that the proposed level of 
improvement achieves important CO2 
emissions reductions through the 
application of feasible control 
technology at reasonable cost, 
considering the needed lead time for 
this program. EPA further believes that 
the proposed averaging, banking and 
trading provisions, as well as other 
credit-generating mechanisms, allow 
manufacturers further flexibilities 
which reduce the cost of the proposed 
CO2 standards and help to provide 
adequate lead time. EPA believes this 
approach is justified under section 
202(a) of the Clean Air Act. 
EPA has analyzed the feasibility 
under the CAA of achieving the 
proposed CO2 standards, based on 
projections of what actions 
manufacturers are expected to take to 
reduce emissions. The results of the 
analysis are discussed in detail in 
Section III.D below and in the DRIA. 
EPA also presents the estimated costs 
and benefits of the proposed car and 
truck CO2 standards in Section III.H. In 
developing the proposal, EPA has 
evaluated the kinds of technologies that 
could be utilized by the automobile 
industry, as well as the associated costs 
for the industry and fuel savings for the 
consumer, the magnitude of the GHG 
reductions that may be achieved, and 
other factors relevant under the CAA. 
With respect to the lead time and cost 
of incorporating technology 
improvements that reduce GHG 
emissions, EPA and NHTSA place 
important weight on the fact that during 
MYs 2012–2016 manufacturers are 
expected to redesign and upgrade their 
light-duty vehicle products (and in 
some cases introduce entirely new 
vehicles not on the market today). Over 
these five model years there would be 
an opportunity for manufacturers to 
evaluate almost every one of their 
vehicle model platforms and add 
technology in a cost-effective way to 
control GHG emissions and improve 
fuel economy. This includes redesign of 
the air conditioner systems in ways that 
will further reduce GHG emissions. The 
time-frame and levels for the proposed 
standards, as well as the ability to 
average, bank and trade credits and 
carry a deficit forward for a limited 
time, are expected to provide 
manufacturers the time needed to 
incorporate technology that will achieve 
GHG reductions, and to do this as part 
of the normal vehicle redesign process. 
This is an important aspect of the 
proposal, as it would avoid the much 
higher costs that would occur if 
manufacturers needed to add or change 
technology at times other than these 
scheduled redesigns. This time period 
would also provide manufacturers the 
opportunity to plan for compliance 
using a multi-year time frame, again in 
accord with their normal business 
practice. 
Consistent with the requirement of 
CAA section 202(a)(1) that standards be 
applicable to vehicles ‘‘for their useful 
life,’’ EPA is proposing CO2 vehicle 
standards that would apply for the 
useful life of the vehicle. Under section 
202(i) of the Act, which authorized the 
Tier 2 standards, EPA established a 
useful life period of 10 years or 120,000 
miles, whichever first occurs, for all 
Tier 2 light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks.125 Tier 2 refers to EPA’s 
standards for criteria pollutants such as 
NOX, HC, and CO. EPA is proposing 
new CO2 standards for the same group 
of vehicles, and therefore the Tier 2 
useful life would apply for CO2 
standards as well. The in-use emission 
standard will be 10% higher than the 
certification standard, to address issues 
of production variability and test-to-test 
variability. The in-use standard is 
discussed in Section III.E. 
EPA is proposing to measure CO2 for 
certification and compliance purposes 
using the same test procedures currently 
used by EPA for measuring fuel 
economy. These procedures are the 
Federal Test Procedure (FTP or ‘‘city’’ 
test) and the Highway Fuel Economy

126 EPA established the FTP for emissions 
measurement in the early 1970s. In 1976, in 
response to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(EPCA) statute, EPA extended the use of the FTP 
to fuel economy measurement and added the 
HFET.126 The provisions in the 1976 regulation, 
effective with the 1977 model year, established 
procedures to calculate fuel economy values both 
for labeling and for CAFE purposes. 
127 See 71 FR 77872, December 27, 2006. 
128 See 49 CFR part 523. 
Test (HFET or ‘‘highway’’ test).126 This 
corresponds with the data used to 
develop the footprint-based CO2 
standards, since the data on control 
technology efficiency was also 
developed in reference to these test 
procedures. Although EPA recently 
updated the test procedures used for 
fuel economy labeling, to better reflect 
the actual in-use fuel economy achieved 
by vehicles, EPA is not proposing to use 
these test procedures for the CO2 
standards proposed here, given the lack 
of data on control technology 
effectiveness under these procedures.127 
As stated in Section I, EPA and NHTSA 
invite comments on potential 
amendments to the CAFE and GHG test 
procedures, including but not limited to 
air conditioner-related emissions, that 
could be implemented beginning in MY 
2017. 
EPA proposes to include 
hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon 
monoxide (CO) in its CO2 emissions 
calculations on a CO2-equivalent basis. 
It is well accepted that HC and CO are 
typically oxidized to CO2 in the 
atmosphere in a relatively short period 
of time and so are effectively part of the 
CO2 emitted by a vehicle. In terms of 
standard stringency, accounting for the 
carbon content of tailpipe HC and CO 
emissions and expressing it as CO2- 
equivalent emissions would add less 
than one percent to the overall CO2- 
equivalent emissions level. This will 
also ensure consistency with CAFE 
calculations since HC and CO are 
included in the ‘‘carbon balance’’ 
methodology that EPA uses to 
determine fuel usage as part of 
calculating vehicle fuel economy levels. 
2. What Are the CO2 Attribute-Based 
Standards? 
EPA proposes to use the same vehicle 
category definitions that are used in the 
CAFE program for the 2011 model year 
standards.128 The CAFE vehicle 
category definitions differ slightly from 
the EPA definitions for cars and light 
trucks used for the Tier 2 program, as 
well as other EPA vehicle programs. 
Specifically, NHTSA’s reconsideration 
of the CAFE program statutory language 
has resulted in many two-wheel drive 
SUVs under 6000 pounds gross vehicle 
weight being reclassified as cars under 
the CAFE program. The proposed 
approach of using CAFE definitions 
allows EPA’s proposed CO2 standards 
and the proposed CAFE standards to be 
harmonized across all vehicles. In other 
words, vehicles would be subject to 
either car standards or truck standards 
under both programs, and not car 
standards under one program and trucks 
standards under the other. 
EPA is proposing separate car and 
truck standards, that is, vehicles defined 
as cars have one set of footprint-based 
curves for MY 2012–2016 and vehicles 
defined as trucks have a different set for 
MY 2012–2016. In general, for a given 
footprint the CO2 g/mi target for trucks 
is less stringent then for a car with the 
same footprint. 
EPA is not proposing a single fleet 
standard where all cars and trucks are 
measured against the same footprint 
curve for several reasons. First, some 
vehicles classified as trucks (such as 
pick-up trucks) have certain attributes 
not common on cars which attributes 
contribute to higher CO2 emissions— 
notably high load carrying capability 
and/or high towing capability. Due to 
these differences, it is reasonable to 
separate the light-duty vehicle fleet into 
two groups. Second, EPA would like to 
harmonize key program design elements 
of the GHG standards with NHTSA’s 
CAFE program where it is reasonable to 
do so. NHTSA is required by statute to 
set separate standards for passenger cars 
and for non-passenger cars. 
Finally, most of the advantages of a 
single standard for all light duty 
vehicles are also present in the two-fleet 
standards proposed here. Because EPA 
is proposing to allow unlimited credit 
transfer between a manufacturer’s car 
and truck fleets, the two fleets can 
essentially be viewed as a single fleet 
when manufacturers consider 
compliance strategies. Manufacturers 
can thus choose on which vehicles 
within their fleet to focus GHG reducing 
technology and then use credit transfers 
as needed to demonstrate compliance, 
just as they would if there was a single 
fleet standard. The one benefit of a 
single light-duty fleet not captured by a 
two-fleet approach is that a single fleet 
prevents potential ‘‘gaming’’ of the car 
and truck definitions to try and design 
vehicles which are more similar to 
passenger cars but which may meet the 
regulatory definition of trucks. Although 
this is of concern to EPA, we do not 
believe at this time that concern is 
sufficient to outweigh the other reasons 
for proposing separate car and truck 
fleet standards. EPA requests comment 
on this approach. 
For model years 2012 and later, EPA 
is proposing a series of CO2 standards 
that are described mathematically by a 
family of piecewise linear functions 
(with respect to vehicle footprint). The 
form of the function is as follows: 
CO2 = a, if x ≤ l 
CO2 = cx + d, if l < x ≤ h 
CO2 = b, if x > h 
Where: 
CO2 = the CO2 target value for a given 
footprint (in g/mi) 
a = the minimum CO2 target value (in g/mi) 
b = the maximum CO2 target value (in g/mi) 
c = the slope of the linear function (in g/mi 
per sq ft) 
d = is the zero-offset for the line (in g/mi CO2) 
x = footprint of the vehicle model (in square 
feet, rounded to the nearest tenth) 
l & h are the lower and higher footprint 
limits, constraints, or the boundary 
(‘‘kinks’’) between the flat regions and 
the intermediate sloped line. 
EPA’s proposed parameter values that 
define the family of functions for the 
proposed CO2 fleetwide average car and 
truck standards are as follows:

decrease from 2012–2016 with a vertical 
shift. A more detailed description of the 
development of the attribute based 
standard can be found in Chapter 2 of 
the Draft Joint TSD. More background 
discussion on other alternative 
attributes and curves EPA explored can 
be found in the EPA DRIA. EPA 
recognizes that the CAA does not 
mandate that EPA use an attribute based 
standard, as compared to NHTSA’s 
obligations under EPCA. The EPA 
believes that proposing a footprint- 
based program will harmonize EPA’s 
proposed program and the proposed 
CAFE program as a single national 
program, resulting in reduced 
compliance complexity for 
manufacturers. EPA’s reasons for 
proposing to use an attribute based 
standard are discussed in more detail in 
the Joint TSD. Comments are requested 
on this proposal to use the attribute- 
based approach for regulating tailpipe 
CO2 emissions.

3. Overview of How EPA’s Proposed 
CO2 Standards Would Be Implemented 
for Individual Manufacturers 
This section provides a brief overview 
of how EPA proposes to implement the 
CO2 standards. Section III.E explains 
EPA’s proposed approach for 
certification and compliance in detail. 
EPA is proposing two kinds of 
standards—fleet average standards 
determined by a manufacturer’s fleet 
profile of various models, and in-use 
standards that would apply to the 
various models that make up the 
manufacturer’s fleet. Although this is 
similar in concept to the current light- 
duty vehicle Tier 2 program, there are

129 The final in-use vehicle standards for each 
model would also be based on the model-level fuel 
economy testing. As discussed in Section III.E.4, an 
in-use adjustment factor would be applied to the 
model level results to determine the in-use standard 
that would apply during the useful life of the 
vehicle. 
130 For example, see the Tier 2 light-duty vehicle 
emission standards program (65 FR 6698, February 
10, 2000), the 2010 and later model year motorcycle 
emissions program (69 FR 2398, January 15, 2004), 
and the 2007 and later model year heavy-duty 
engine and vehicle standards program (66 FR 5001, 
January 18, 2001). 
important differences. In explaining 
EPA’s proposal for the CO2 standards, it 
is useful to summarize how the Tier 2 
program works. 
Under Tier 2, manufacturers select a 
test vehicle prior to certification and test 
the vehicle and/or its emissions 
hardware to determine both its 
emissions performance when new and 
the emissions performance expected at 
the end of its useful life. Based on this 
testing, the vehicle is assigned to one of 
several specified bins of emissions 
levels, identified in the Tier 2 rule, and 
this bin level becomes the emissions 
standard for the test group the test 
vehicle represents. All of the vehicles in 
the group must meet the emissions level 
for that bin throughout their useful life. 
The emissions level assigned to the bin 
is also used in calculating the 
manufacturer’s fleet average emissions 
performance. 
Since compliance with the Tier 2 fleet 
average depends on actual test group 
sales volumes and bin levels, it is not 
possible to determine compliance at the 
time the manufacturer applies for and 
receives a certificate of conformity for a 
test group. Instead, at certification, the 
manufacturer demonstrates that the 
vehicles in the test group are expected 
to comply throughout their useful life 
with the emissions bin assigned to that 
test group, and makes a good faith 
demonstration that its fleet is expected 
to comply with the Tier 2 average when 
the model year is over. EPA issues a 
certificate for the vehicles covered by 
the test group based on this 
demonstration, and includes a condition 
in the certificate that if the manufacturer 
does not comply with the fleet average 
then production vehicles from that test 
group will be treated as not covered by 
the certificate to the extent needed to 
bring the manufacturer’s fleet average 
into compliance with Tier 2. 
EPA proposes to retain the Tier 2 
approach of requiring manufacturers to 
demonstrate in good faith at the time of 
certification that models in a test group 
will meet applicable standards 
throughout useful life. EPA also 
proposes to retain the practice of 
conditioning certificates upon 
attainment of the fleet average standard. 
However, there are several important 
differences between a Tier 2 type of 
program and the CO2 standards program 
EPA is proposing. These differences and 
resulting modifications to certification 
are summarized below and are 
described in detail in Section III.E. 
EPA is proposing to certify test groups 
as it does for Tier 2, with the CO2 
emission results for the test vehicle as 
the initial or default standard for all of 
the models in the test group. However, 
manufacturers would later substitute 
test data for individual models in that 
test group, based on the model level fuel 
economy testing that typically occurs 
through the course of the model year. 
This model level data would then be 
used to assign a distinct certification 
level for that model, instead of the 
initial test group level. These model 
level results would then be used to 
calculate the fleet average after the end 
of production.129 The option to 
substitute model level test data for the 
test group data is at the manufacturer’s 
discretion, except they are required as 
under the CAFE test protocols to test, at 
a minimum, enough models to represent 
90 percent of their production. The test 
group level would continue to apply for 
any model that is not covered by model 
level testing. A related difference is that 
the fleet average calculation for Tier 2 
is based on test group bin levels and test 
group sales whereas under this proposal 
the CO2 fleet level would be based on 
a combination of test group and model- 
level emissions and model-level 
production. For the new CO2 standards, 
EPA is proposing to use production 
rather than sales in calculating the fleet 
average in order to more closely 
conform with CAFE, which is a 
production-based program. EPA does 
not expect any significant 
environmental effect because there is 
little difference between production and 
sales, and this will reduce the 
complexity of the program for 
manufacturers. 
4. Averaging, Banking, and Trading 
Provisions for CO2 Standards 
As explained above, a fleet average 
CO2 program for passenger cars and 
light trucks is proposed. EPA has 
implemented similar averaging 
programs for a range of motor vehicle 
types and pollutants, from the Tier 2 
fleet average for NOX to motorcycle 
hydrocarbon (HC) plus oxides of 
nitrogen (NOX) emissions to NOX and 
particulate matter (PM) emissions from 
heavy-duty engines.130 The proposed 
program would operate much like EPA’s 
existing averaging programs in that 
manufacturers would calculate 
production-weighted fleet average 
emissions at the end of the model year 
and compare their fleet average with a 
fleet average standard to determine 
compliance. As in other EPA averaging 
programs, the Agency is also proposing 
a comprehensive program for averaging, 
banking, and trading of credits which 
together will help manufacturers in 
planning and implementing the orderly 
phase-in of emissions control 
technology in their production, using 
their typical redesign schedules. 
Averaging, Banking, and Trading 
(ABT) of emissions credits has been an 
important part of many mobile source 
programs under CAA Title II, both for 
fuels programs as well as for engine and 
vehicle programs. ABT is important 
because it can help to address many 
issues of technological feasibility and 
lead-time, as well as considerations of 
cost. ABT is an integral part of the 
standard setting itself, and is not just an 
add-on to help reduce costs. In many 
cases, ABT resolves issues of lead-time 
or technical feasibility, allowing EPA to 
set a standard that is either numerically 
more stringent or goes into effect earlier 
than could have been justified 
otherwise. This provides important 
environmental benefits at the same time 
it increases flexibility and reduces costs 
for the regulated industry. 
This section discusses generation of 
credits by achieving a fleet average CO2 
level that is lower than the 
manufacturer’s CO2 fleet average 
standard. EPA is proposing a variety of 
additional ways credits may be 
generated by manufacturers. Section 
III.C describes these additional 
opportunities to generate credits in 
detail. EPA is proposing that credits 
could be earned through A/C system 
improvements beyond a specified 
baseline. Credits can also be generated 
by producing alternative fuel vehicles, 
by producing advanced technology 
vehicles including electric vehicles, 
plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles, 
and by using technologies that improve 
off-cycle emissions. In addition, EPA is 
proposing that early credits could be 
generated prior to the proposed 
program’s MY 2012 start date. The 
credits would be used in calculating the 
fleet averages at the end of the model 
year, with the exception of early credits 
which would be tracked separately. 
These proposed credit generating 
opportunities are described below in 
Section III.C. 
As explained earlier, manufacturers 
would determine the fleet average 
standard that would apply to their car 
fleet and the standard for their truck 
fleet from the applicable attribute-based 
curve. A manufacturer’s credit or debit

balance would be determined by 
comparing their fleet average with the 
manufacturer’s CO2 standard for that 
model year. The standard would be 
calculated from footprint values on the 
attribute curve and actual production 
levels of vehicles at each footprint. A 
manufacturer would generate credits if 
its car or truck fleet achieves a fleet 
average CO2 level lower than its 
standard and would generate debits if 
its fleet average CO2 level is above that 
standard. At the end of the model year, 
each manufacturer would calculate a 
production-weighted fleet average for 
each averaging set, cars and trucks. A 
manufacturer’s car or truck fleet that 
achieves a fleet average CO2 level lower 
than its standard would generate 
credits, and if its fleet average CO2 level 
is above that standard its fleet would 
generate debits. 
EPA is proposing to account for the 
difference in expected lifetime vehicle 
miles traveled (VMT) between cars and 
trucks in order to preserve CO2 
reductions when credits are transferred 
between cars and trucks. As directed by 
EISA, NHTSA accomplishes this in the 
CAFE program by using an adjustment 
factor that is applied to credits when 
they are transferred between car and 
truck compliance categories. The CAFE 
adjustment factor accounts for two 
different influences that can cause the 
transfer of car and truck credits 
(expressed in tenths of a mpg), if left 
unadjusted, to potentially negate fuel 
reductions. First, mpg is not linear with 
fuel consumption, i.e., a 1 mpg 
improvement above a standard will 
imply a different amount of actual fuel 
consumed depending on the level of the 
standard. Second, NHTSA’s conversion 
corrects for the fact that the typical 
lifetime miles for cars is less than that 
for trucks, meaning that credits earned 
for cars and trucks are not necessarily 
equal. NHTSA’s adjustment factor 
essentially converts credits into vehicle 
lifetime gallons to ensure preservation 
of fuel savings and the transfer credits 
on an equal basis, and then converts 
back to the statutorily required credit 
units of tenths of a mile per gallon. To 
convert to gallons NHTSA’s conversion 
must take into account the expected 
lifetime mileage for cars and trucks. 
Because EPA is proposing standards 
that are expressed on a CO2 gram per 
mile basis, which is linear with fuel 
consumption, EPA’s credit calculations 
do not need to account for the first issue 
noted above. However, EPA is 
proposing to account for the second 
issue by expressing credits when they 
are generated in total lifetime 
megagrams (metric tons), rather than 
through the use of conversion factors 
that would apply at certain times. In 
this way credits could be freely 
exchanged between car and truck 
compliance categories without 
adjustment. Additional detail regarding 
this approach, including a discussion of 
the vehicle lifetime mileage estimates 
for cars and trucks can be found in 
Section III.E.5. A discussion of the 
estimated vehicle lifetime miles traveled 
can be found in Chapter 4 of the draft 
Joint Technical Support Document. EPA 
requests comment on the proposed 
approach. 
A manufacturer that generates credits 
in a given year and vehicle category 
could use those credits in essentially 
four ways, although with some 
limitations. These provisions are very 
similar to those of other EPA averaging, 
banking, and trading programs. These 
provisions have the potential to reduce 
costs and compliance burden, and 
support the feasibility of the standards 
being proposed in terms of lead time 
and orderly redesign by a manufacturer, 
thus promoting and not reducing the 
environmental benefits of the program. 
First, the manufacturer would have to 
offset any deficit that had accrued in 
that averaging set in a prior model year 
and had been carried over to the current 
model year. In such a case, the 
manufacturer would be obligated to use 
any current model year credits to offset 
that deficit. This is referred to in the 
CAFE program as credit carry-back. 
EPA’s proposed deficit carry-forward, or 
credit carry-back provisions are 
described further, below. 
Second, after satisfying any needs to 
offset pre-existing deficits within a 
vehicle category, remaining credits 
could be banked, or saved for use in 
future years. EPA is proposing that 
credits generated in this program be 
available to the manufacturer for use in 
any of the five years after the year in 
which they were generated, consistent 
with the CAFE program under EISA. 
This is also referred to as a credit carry- 
forward provision. For other new 
emission control programs, EPA has 
sometimes initially restricted credit life 
to allow time for the Agency to assess 
whether the credit program is 
functioning as intended. When EPA first 
offered averaging and banking 
provisions in its light-duty emissions 
control program (the National Low 
Emission Vehicle Program), credit life 
was restricted to three years. The same 
is true of EPA’s early averaging and 
banking program for heavy-duty 
engines. As these programs matured and 
were subsequently revised, EPA became 
confident that the programs were 
functioning as intended and that the 
standards were sufficiently stringent to 
remove the restrictions on credit life. 
EPA is therefore acting consistently 
with our past practice in proposing to 
reasonably restrict credit life in this new 
program. The Agency believes, subject 
to consideration of public comment, 
that a credit life of five years represents 
an appropriate balance between 
promoting orderly redesign and upgrade 
of the emissions control technology in 
the manufacturer’s fleet and the policy 
goal of preventing large numbers of 
credits accumulated early in the 
program from interfering with the 
incentive to develop and transition to 
other more advanced emissions control 
technologies. As discussed below in 
Section III.C, EPA is proposing that any 
early credits generated by a 
manufacturer, beginning as soon as MY 
2009, would also be subject to the five- 
year credit carry-forward restriction 
based on the year in which they are 
generated. This would limit the effect of 
the early credits on the long-term 
emissions reductions anticipated to 
result from the proposed new standards. 
Third, EPA is proposing to allow 
manufacturers to transfer credits 
between the two averaging sets, 
passenger cars and trucks, within a 
manufacturer. For example, credits 
accrued by over-compliance with a 
manufacturer’s car fleet average 
standard could be used to offset debits 
accrued due to that manufacturer’s not 
meeting the truck fleet average standard 
in a given year. EPA believes that such 
cross-category use of credits by a 
manufacturer would provide important 
additional flexibility in the transition to 
emissions control technology without 
affecting overall emission reductions. 
Finally, accumulated credits could be 
traded to another vehicle manufacturer. 
As with intra-company credit use, such 
inter-company credit trading would 
provide flexibility in the transition to 
emissions control technology without 
affecting overall emission reductions. 
Trading credits to another vehicle 
manufacturer would be a 
straightforward process between the two 
manufacturers, but could also involve 
third parties that could serve as credit 
brokers. Brokers would not own the 
credits at any time. These sorts of 
exchanges are typically allowed under 
EPA’s current emission credit programs, 
e.g., the Tier 2 light-duty vehicle NOX 
fleet average standard and the heavy- 
duty engine NOX fleet average 
standards, although manufacturers have 
seldom made such exchanges. EPA 
seeks comment on enhanced reporting 
requirements or other methods that 
could help EPA assess validity of

credits, especially those obtained from 
third-party credit brokers 
If a manufacturer had a deficit at the 
end of a model year—that is, its fleet 
average level failed to meet the required 
fleet average standard—EPA proposes 
that the manufacturer could carry that 
deficit forward (also referred to credit 
carry-back) for a total of three model 
years after the model year in which that 
deficit was generated. As noted above, 
such a deficit carry-forward could only 
occur after the manufacturer applied 
any banked credits or credits from 
another averaging set. If a deficit still 
remained after the manufacturer had 
applied all available credits, and the 
manufacturer did not obtain credits 
elsewhere, the deficit could be carried 
over for up to three model years. No 
deficit could be carried into the fourth 
model year after the model year in 
which the deficit occurred. Any deficit 
from the first model year that remained 
after the third model year would thus 
constitute a violation of the condition 
on the certificate, which would 
constitute a violation of the Clean Air 
Act and would be subject to 
enforcement action. 
In the Tier 2 rulemaking proposal, 
EPA proposed to allow deficits to be 
carried forward for one year. In their 
comments on that proposal, 
manufacturers argued persuasively that 
by the time they can tabulate their 
average emissions for a particular model 
year, the next model year is likely to be 
well underway and it is too late to make 
calibration, marketing, or production 
mix changes to adjust that year’s credit 
generation. Based on those comments, 
in the Tier 2 final rule EPA finalized 
provisions that allowed the deficit to be 
carried forward for a total of three years. 
EPA continues to believe that three 
years is an appropriate amount of time 
that gives the manufacturers adequate 
time to respond to a deficit situation but 
does not create a lengthy period of 
prolonged non-compliance with the 
fleet average standards.131 Subsequent 
EPA emission control programs that 
incorporate ABT provisions (e.g., the 
Mobile Source Air Toxics rule) have 
provided this three-year deficit carry- 
forward provision for this reason.132 
The proposed averaging, banking, and 
trading provisions are generally 
consistent with those included in the 
CAFE program, with a few notable 
exceptions. As with EPA’s proposed 
approach, CAFE allows five year carry- 
forward of credits and three year carry- 
back. Transfers of credits across a 
manufacturer’s car and truck averaging 
sets are also allowed, but with limits 
established by EISA on the use of 
transferred credits. The amount of 
transferred credits that can be used in a 
year is limited, and transferred credits 
may not be used to meet the CAFE 
minimum domestic passenger car 
standard. CAFE allows credit trading, 
but again, traded credits cannot be used 
to meet the minimum domestic 
passenger car standard. EPA is not 
proposing these constraints on the use 
of transferred credits. 
Additional details regarding the 
averaging, banking, and trading 
provisions and how EPA proposes to 
implement these provisions can be 
found in Section III.E. 
5. CO2 Optional Temporary Lead-time 
Allowance Alternative Standards 
EPA is proposing a limited and 
narrowly prescribed option, called the 
Temporary Lead-time Allowance 
Alternative Standards (TLAAS), to 
provide additional lead time for a 
certain subset of manufacturers. This 
option is designed to address two 
different situations where we project 
that more lead time is needed, based on 
the level of emissions control 
technology and emissions control 
performance currently exhibited by 
certain vehicles. One situation involves 
manufacturers who have traditionally 
paid CAFE fines instead of complying 
with the CAFE fleet average, and as a 
result at least part of their vehicle 
production currently has significantly 
higher CO2 and lower fuel economy 
levels than the industry average. More 
lead time is needed in the program’s 
initial years to upgrade these vehicles to 
meet the aggressive CO2 emissions 
performance levels required by the 
proposal. The other situation involves 
manufacturers who have a limited line 
of vehicles and are unable to take 
advantage of averaging of emissions 
performance across a full line of 
production. For example, some smaller 
volume manufacturers focus on high 
performance vehicles with higher CO2 
emissions, above the CO2 emissions 
target for that vehicle footprint, but do 
not have other types of vehicles in their 
production mix with which to average. 
Often, these manufacturers also pay 
fines under the CAFE program rather 
than meeting the applicable CAFE 
standard. Because voluntary non- 
compliance is impermissible for the 
GHG standards proposed under the 
CAA, both of these types of 
manufacturers need additional lead time 
to upgrade vehicles and meet the 
proposed standards. EPA is proposing 
an optional, temporary alternative 
standard, which is only slightly less 
stringent, and limited to the first four 
model years (2012—2015) of the 
National Program, so that these 
manufacturers can have sufficient lead 
time to meet the tougher MY 2016 GHG 
standards, while preserving consumer 
choice of vehicles during this time. 
In MY 2016, the TLAAS option ends, 
and all manufacturers, regardless of 
size, and domestic sales volume, must 
comply with the same CO2 standards, 
while under the CAFE program 
companies would continue to be 
allowed to pay civil penalties in lieu of 
complying with the CAFE standards. 
However, because companies must meet 
both the CAFE standards and the EPA 
CO2 standards, the National Program 
will have the practical impact of 
providing a level playing field for all 
companies beginning in MY 2016—a 
situation which has never existed under 
the CAFE program. This option thereby 
results in more fuel savings and CO2 
reductions than would be the case 
under the CAFE program. 
EPA projects that the environmental 
impact of the proposed TLAAS program 
will be very small. If all companies 
eligible to use the TLAAS use it to the 
maximum extent allowed, total GHG 
emissions from the proposal will 
increase by less than 0.4% over the 
lifetime of the MY 2012–2016 vehicles. 
EPA believes the impact will be even 
smaller, as we do not expect all of the 
eligible companies to use this option, 
and we do not expect all companies 
who do use the program will use it to 
the maximum extent allowed, as we 
have included provisions which 
discourage companies from using the 
TLAAS any longer than it is needed. 
EPA has structured the TLAAS option 
to provide more lead time in these kinds 
of situations, but to limit the program so 
that it would only be used in situations 
where these kinds of lead time concerns 
arise. Based on historic data on sales, 
EPA is using a specific historic U.S. 
sales volume as the best way to identify 
the subset of production that falls into 
this situation. Under the TLAAS, these 
manufacturers would be allowed to 
produce up to but no more than 100,000 
vehicles that would be subject to a 
somewhat less stringent CO2 standard. 
This 100,000 volume is not an annual 
limit, but is an absolute limit for the 
total number of vehicles which can use 
the TLAAS program over the model 
years 2012–2015. Any additional 
production would be subject to the same 
standards as any other manufacturer. In 
addition, EPA is imposing a variety of 
restrictions on the use of the TLAAS 
program, discussed in more detail 
below, to ensure that only 
manufacturers who need more lead-time

for the kinds of reasons noted above are 
likely to use the program. Finally, the 
program is temporary and expires at the 
end of MY 2015. A more complete 
discussion of the program is provided 
below. EPA believes the proposed 
program reasonably addresses a real 
world lead time constraint, and does it 
in a way that balances the need for more 
lead time with the need to minimize any 
resulting loss in potential emissions 
reductions. EPA invites comment as to 
whether its proposal is the best way to 
balance these concerns. 
EPA proposes to establish a TLAAS 
for a specified subset of manufacturers. 
There are two types of companies who 
would make use of TLAAS—those 
manufacturers who have paid CAFE 
fines in recent years, and who need 
additional lead-time to incorporate the 
needed technology; and those 
companies who are not full-line 
manufacturers, who have a smaller 
range of models and vehicle types, who 
may need additional lead-time as well. 
This alternative standard would apply 
to manufacturers with total U.S. sales of 
less than 400,000 vehicles per year, 
using 2009 model year final sales 
numbers to determine eligibility for 
these alternative standards. EPA 
reviewed the sales volumes of 
manufacturers over the last few years, 
and determined that manufacturers 
below this level typically fit the 
characteristics discussed above, and 
manufacturers above this level did not. 
Thus, EPA chose this level because it 
functionally identifies the group of 
manufacturers described above, 
recognizing that there is nothing 
intrinsic in the sales volume itself that 
warrants this allowance. EPA was not 
able to identify any other objective 
criteria that would more appropriately 
identify the manufacturers and vehicle 
fleets described above. 
EPA is proposing that manufacturers 
qualifying for TLAAS would be allowed 
to meet slightly less stringent standards 
for a limited number of vehicles for 
model years 2012–2015. Specifically, an 
eligible manufacturer could have a total 
of up to 100,000 units of cars and trucks 
combined over model years 2012–2015, 
and during those model years those 
vehicles would be subject to a standard 
1.25 times the standard that would 
otherwise apply to those vehicles under 
the primary program. In other words, 
the footprint curves upon which the 
individual manufacturer standards for 
the TLAAS fleets are based would be 
less stringent by a factor of 1.25 for up 
to 100,000 of an eligible manufacturer’s 
vehicles for model years 2012–2015. As 
noted, this approach seeks to balance 
the need to provide additional lead-time 
without reducing the environmental 
benefits of the proposed program. EPA 
believes that 100,000 units over four 
model years achieves an appropriate 
balance as the emissions impact is quite 
small, but does provide companies with 
some flexibility during MY 2012–2015. 
For example, for a manufacturer 
producing 400,000 vehicles per year, 
this would be a total of up to 100,000 
vehicles out of a total production of up 
to 1.6 million vehicles over the four year 
period, or about 6 percent of total 
production. 
Manufacturers with no U.S. sales in 
model year 2009 would not qualify for 
the TLAAS program. Manufacturers 
meeting the cut-point of 400,000 for MY 
2009 but with U.S. directed production 
above 400,000 in any subsequent model 
years would remain eligible for the 
TLAAS program. Also, the total sales 
number applies at the corporate level, so 
if a corporation owns several vehicle 
brands the aggregate sales for the 
corporation would be used. These 
provisions would help prevent gaming 
of the provisions through corporate 
restructuring. Corporate ownership or 
control relationships would be based on 
determinations made under CAFE for 
model year 2009. In other words, 
corporations grouped together for 
purposes of meeting CAFE standards, 
would be grouped together for 
determining whether or not they are 
eligible under the 400,000 vehicle cut 
point. 
EPA derived the 100,000 maximum 
unit set aside number based on a 
gradual phase-out schedule shown in 
Table III.B.5–1, below. However, 
individual manufacturers’ situations 
will vary significantly and so EPA 
believes a flexible approach that allows 
manufacturers to use the allowance as 
they see fit during these model years 
would be most appropriate. As another 
example, an eligible manufacturer could 
also choose to apply the TLAAS 
program to an average of 25,000 vehicles 
per year, over the four-year period. 
Therefore, EPA is proposing that a total 
of 100,000 vehicles of an eligible 
manufacturer, with any combination of 
cars or trucks, could be subject to the 
alternative standard over the four year 
period without restrictions. 
TABLE III.B.5–1—TLAAS EXAMPLE VEHICLE PRODUCTION VOLUMES 
Model year 2012 2013 2014 2015 
Sales Volume ........................................................................... 40,000 30,000 20,000 10,000 
The TLAAS vehicles would be 
separate car and truck fleets for that 
model year and would be subject to the 
less stringent footprint-based standards 
of 1.25 times the primary fleet average 
that would otherwise apply. The 
manufacturer would determine what 
vehicles are assigned to these separate 
averaging sets for each model year. EPA 
is proposing that credits from the 
primary fleet average program can be 
transferred and used in the TLAAS 
program. Credits within the TLAAS 
program may also be transferred 
between the TLAAS car and truck 
averaging sets for use through 2015 
when the TLAAS would end. However, 
credits generated under TLAAS would 
not be allowed to be transferred or 
traded to the primary program. 
Therefore, any unused credits under 
TLAAS would expire after model year 
2015. EPA believes that this is necessary 
to limit the program to situations where 
it is needed and to prevent the 
allowance from being inappropriately 
transferred to the long-term primary 
program. 
EPA is concerned that some 
manufacturers would be able to place 
relatively clean vehicles in the TLAAS 
to maximize TLAAS credits if credit use 
was unrestricted. However, any credits 
generated from the primary program 
that are not needed for compliance in 
the primary program, should be used to 
offset the TLAAS vehicles. EPA is thus 
proposing to restrict the use of banking 
and trading between companies of 
credits in the primary program in years 
in which the TLAAS is being used. For 
example, manufacturers using the 
TLAAS in MY 2012 could not bank 
credits in the primary program during 
MY 2012 for use in MY 2013 and later. 
No such restriction would be in place 
for years when the TLAAS is not being 
used. EPA also believes this provision is 
necessary to prevent credits from being 
earned simply by removing some high- 
emitting vehicles from the primary fleet. 
Absent this restriction, manufacturers 
would be able to choose to use the 
TLAAS for these vehicles and also be

Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Motor Vehicles,

Second Assessment Report (SAR). 
able to earn credits under the primary 
program that could be banked or traded 
under the primary program without 
restriction. EPA is proposing two 
additional restrictions regarding the use 
of the TLAAS by requiring that for any 
of the 2012–2015 model years for which 
an eligible manufacturer would like to 
use the TLAAS, the manufacturer must 
use two of the available flexibilities in 
the GHG program first in order to try 
and show compliance with the primary 
standard before accessing the TLAAS. 
Specifically, before using the TLAAS 
the manufacturer must: (1) use any 
banked emission credits from a previous 
model year; and, (2) use any available 
credits from the companies’ car or truck 
fleet for the specific model year (i.e., use 
credit transfer from cars to trucks or 
from trucks to cars, that is, before using 
the TLAAS for either the car fleet or the 
truck fleet, make use of any available 
credit transfers first). EPA is requesting 
comments on all aspects of the proposed 
TLAAS program including comments 
on other provisions that might be 
needed to ensure that the TLAAS 
program is being used as intended and 
to ensure no gaming occurs. 
Finally, EPA recognizes that there 
will be a wide range of companies 
within the eligible manufacturers with 
sales less than 400,000 vehicles in 
model year 2009. Some of these 
companies, while having relatively 
small U.S. sales volumes, are large 
global automotive firms, including 
companies such as Mercedes and 
Volkswagen. Other companies are 
significantly smaller niche firms, with 
sales volumes closer to 10,000 vehicles 
per year worldwide; an example of this 
type of firm is Aston Martin. EPA 
anticipates that there are a small 
number of such smaller volume 
manufacturers, which have claimed that 
they may face greater challenges in 
meeting the proposed standards due to 
their limited product lines across which 
to average. EPA requests comment on 
whether the proposed TLAAS program, 
as described above, provides sufficient 
lead-time for these smaller firms to 
incorporate the technology needed to 
comply with the proposed GHG 
standards. 
6. Proposed Nitrous Oxide and Methane 
Standards 
In addition to fleet-average CO2 
standards, EPA is proposing separate 
per-vehicle standards for nitrous oxide 
(N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions. 
Standards are being proposed that 
would cap vehicle N2O and CH4 
emissions at current levels. Our 
intention is to set emissions standards 
that act to cap emissions to ensure that 
future vehicles do not increase their 
N2O and CH4 emissions above levels 
that would be allowed under the 
proposal. 
EPA considered an approach of 
expressing each of these standards in 
common terms of CO2-equivalent 
emissions and combining them into a 
single standard along with CO2 and HFC 
emissions. California’s ‘‘Pavley’’ 
program adopted such a CO2-equivalent 
emissions standards approach to GHG 
emissions in their program.133 However, 
these pollutants are largely independent 
of one another in terms of how they are 
generated by the vehicle and how they 
are tested for during implementation. 
Potential control technologies and 
strategies for each pollutant also differ. 
Moreover, an approach that provided for 
averaging of these pollutants could 
undermine the stringency of the CO2 
standards, as at this time we are 
proposing standards which ‘‘cap’’ N2O 
and CH4 emissions, rather then 
proposing a level which is either at the 
industry fleet-wide average or which 
would result in reductions from these 
pollutants. It is possible that once EPA 
begins to receive more detailed 
information on the N2O and CH4 
performance of the new vehicle fleet as 
a result of this proposed rule (if it were 
to be finalized as proposed) that for a 
future action for model years 2017 and 
later EPA could consider a CO2- 
equivalent standard which would not 
result in any increases in GHG 
emissions due to the current lack of 
detailed data on N2O and CH4 emissions 
performance. In addition, EPA seeks 
comment on whether a CO2-equivalent 
emissions standard should be 
considered for model years 2012 
through 2016, and whether there are 
advantages or disadvantages to such an 
approach, including potential impacts 
on harmonization with CAFE standards. 
Almost universally across current car 
and truck designs, both gasoline- and 
diesel-fueled, these emissions are 
relatively low, and our intent is to not 
require manufacturers to make 
technological improvements in order to 
reduce N2O and CH4 at this time. 
However, it is important that future 
vehicle technologies or fuels do not 
result in increases in these emissions, 
and this is the intent of the proposed 
‘‘cap’’ standards. 
EPA requests comments on our 
approach to regulating N2O and CH4 
emissions including the appropriateness 
of ‘‘cap’’ standards as opposed to 
‘‘technology-forcing’’ standards, the 
technical bases for the proposed N2O 
and CH4 standards, the proposed test 
procedures, and timing. Specifically, 
EPA seeks comment on the 
appropriateness of the proposed levels 
of the N2O and CH4 standards to 
accomplish our stated intent. In 
addition, EPA seeks comment on any 
additional emissions data on N2O and 
CH4 from current technology vehicles. 
a. Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Exhaust 
Emission Standard 
N2O is a global warming gas with a 
high global warming potential.134 It 
accounts for about 2.7% of the current 
greenhouse gas emissions from cars and 
light trucks. EPA is proposing a per- 
vehicle N2O emission standard of 0.010 
g/mi, measured over the traditional FTP 
vehicle laboratory test cycles. The 
standard would become effective in 
model year 2012 for all light-duty cars 
and trucks. Averaging between vehicles 
would not be allowed. The standard is 
designed to prevent increases in N2O 
emissions from current levels, i.e. a no- 
backsliding standard. 
N2O is emitted from gasoline and 
diesel vehicles mainly during specific 
catalyst temperature conditions 
conducive to N2O formation. 
Specifically, N2O can be generated 
during periods of emission hardware 
warm-up when rising catalyst 
temperatures pass through the 
temperature window when N2O 
formation potential is possible. For 
current Tier 2 compatible gasoline 
engines with conventional three-way 
catalyst technology, N2O is not generally 
produced in significant amounts 
because the time the catalyst spends at 
the critical temperatures during warm- 
up is short. This is largely due to the 
need to quickly reach the higher 
temperatures necessary for high catalyst 
efficiency to achieve emission 
compliance of criteria pollutants. N2O is 
a more significant concern with diesel 
vehicles, and potentially future gasoline 
lean-burn engines, equipped with 
advanced catalytic NOX emissions 
control systems. These systems can but 
need not be designed in a way that 
emphasizes efficient NOX control while 
allowing the formation of significant 
quantities of N2O. Excess oxygen 
present in the exhaust during lean-burn 
conditions in diesel or lean-burn 
gasoline engines equipped with these 
advanced systems can favor N2O 
formation if catalyst temperatures are 
not carefully controlled. Without

135 Memo to docket ‘‘Deriving the standard from 
EPA’s MOVES model emission factors, ’’ December 
2007. 
136 CH4 has a GWP of 21 according to the IPCC 
Second Assessment Report (SAR). 
137 But see Ford Motor Co. v. EPA, 604 F. 2d 685 
(D.C. Cir. 1979) (permissible for EPA to regulate 
CH4 under CAA section 202 (b)). 
138 Memo to docket ‘‘Deriving the standard from 
EPA’s MOVES model emission factors, ’’ December 
2007. 
specific attention to controlling N2O 
emissions in the development of such 
new NOX control systems, vehicles 
could have N2O emissions many times 
greater than are emitted by current 
gasoline vehicles. 
EPA is proposing an N2O emission 
standard that EPA believes would be 
met by current-technology gasoline 
vehicles at essentially no cost. As noted, 
N2O formation in current catalyst 
systems occurs, but the emission levels 
are low, because the time the catalyst 
spends at the critical temperatures 
during warm-up when N2O can form is 
short. At the same time, EPA believes 
that the proposed standard would 
ensure that the design of advanced NOX 
control systems, especially for future 
diesel and lean-burn gasoline vehicles, 
would control N2O emission levels. 
While current NOX control approaches 
used on current Tier 2 diesel vehicles 
do not tend to form N2O emissions, EPA 
believes that the proposed standards 
would discourage any new emission 
control designs that achieve criteria 
emissions compliance at the cost of 
increased N2O emissions. Thus, the 
proposed standard would cap N2O 
emission levels, with the expectation 
that current gasoline and diesel vehicle 
control approaches that comply with the 
Tier 2 vehicle emission standards for 
NOX would not increase their emission 
levels, and that the cap would ensure 
that future vehicle designs would 
appropriately control their emissions of 
N2O. The proposed N2O level is 
approximately two times the average 
N2O level of current gasoline passenger 
cars and light-duty trucks that meet the 
Tier 2 NOX standards.135 Manufacturers 
typically use design targets for NOX 
emission levels of about 50% of the 
standard, to account for in-use 
emissions deterioration and normal 
testing and production variability, and 
manufacturers are expected to utilize a 
similar approach for N2O emission 
compliance. EPA is not proposing a 
more stringent standard for current 
gasoline and diesel vehicles because the 
stringent Tier 2 program and the 
associated NOX fleet average 
requirement already result in significant 
N2O control, and does not expect 
current N2O levels to rise for these 
vehicles. EPA requests comment on this 
technical assessment of current and 
potential future N2O formation in cars 
and trucks. 
While EPA believes that 
manufacturers will likely be able to 
acquire and install N2O analytical 
equipment, the agency also recognizes 
that some companies may face 
challenges. Given the short lead-time for 
this rule, EPA proposes that 
manufacturers be able to apply for a 
certificate of conformity with the N2O 
standard for model year 2012 based on 
a compliance statement based on good 
engineering judgment. For 2013 and 
later model years, manufacturers would 
need to submit measurements of N2O for 
compliance purposes. 
Diesel cars and light trucks with 
advanced emission control technology 
are in the early stages of development 
and commercialization. As this segment 
of the vehicle market develops, the 
proposed N2O standard would require 
manufacturers to incorporate control 
strategies that minimize N2O formation. 
Available approaches include using 
electronic controls to limit catalyst 
conditions that might favor N2O 
formation and consider different 
catalyst formulations. While some of 
these approaches may have modest 
associated costs, EPA believes that they 
will be small compared to the overall 
costs of the advanced NOX control 
technologies already required to meet 
Tier 2 standards. 
Vehicle emissions regulations do not 
currently require testing for N2O, and 
most test facilities do not have 
equipment for its measurement. 
Manufacturers without this capability 
would need to acquire and install 
appropriate measurement equipment. 
However, EPA is proposing four N2O 
measurement methods, all of which are 
commercially available today. EPA 
expects that most manufacturers would 
use photo-acoustic measurement 
equipment, which the Agency estimates 
would result in a one-time cost of about 
$50,000–$60,000 for each test cell that 
would need to be upgraded. 
Overall, EPA believes that 
manufacturers of cars and light trucks, 
both gasoline and diesel, would meet 
the proposed standard without 
implementing any significantly new 
technologies, and there are not expected 
to be any significant costs associated 
with this proposed standard. 
b. Methane (CH4) Exhaust Emission 
Standard 
CH4 (or methane) is greenhouse gas 
with a high global warming potential.136 
It accounts for about 0.2% of the 
greenhouse gases from cars and light 
trucks. 
EPA is proposing a CH4 emission 
standard of 0.030 g/mi as measured on 
the FTP, to apply beginning with model 
year 2012 for both cars and trucks. EPA 
believes that this level for the standard 
would be met by current gasoline and 
diesel vehicles, and would prevent large 
increases in future CH4 emissions in the 
event that alternative fueled vehicles 
with high methane emissions, like some 
past dedicated compressed natural gas 
(CNG) vehicles, become a significant 
part of the vehicle fleet. Currently EPA 
does not have separate CH4 standards 
because unlike other hydrocarbons it 
does not contribute significantly to 
ozone formation,137 However CH4 
emissions levels in the gasoline and 
diesel car and light truck fleet have 
nevertheless generally been controlled 
by the Tier 2 non-methane organic gases 
(NMOG) emission standards. However, 
without an emission standard for CH4, 
future emission levels of CH4 cannot be 
guaranteed to remain at current levels as 
vehicle technologies and fuels evolve. 
The proposed standard would cap 
CH4 emission levels, with the 
expectation that current gasoline 
vehicles meeting the Tier 2 emission 
standards would not increase their 
levels, and that it would ensure that 
emissions would be addressed if in the 
future there are increases in the use of 
natural gas or any other alternative fuel. 
The level of the standard would 
generally be achievable through normal 
emission control methods already 
required to meet Tier 2 program 
emission standards for NMOG and EPA 
is therefore not attributing any cost to 
this part of this proposal. Since CH4 is 
produced in gasoline and diesel engines 
similar to other hydrocarbon 
components, controls targeted at 
reducing overall NMOG levels generally 
also work at reducing CH4 emissions. 
Therefore, for gasoline and diesel 
vehicles, the Tier 2 NMOG standards 
will generally prevent increases in CH4 
emissions levels from today. CH4 from 
Tier 2 light-duty vehicles is relatively 
low compared to other GHGs largely 
due to the high effectiveness of previous 
National Low Emission Vehicle (NLEV) 
and current Tier 2 programs in 
controlling overall HC emissions. 
The level of the proposed standard is 
approximately two times the average 
Tier 2 gasoline passenger cars and light- 
duty trucks level.138 As with N2O, this 
proposed level recognizes that 
manufacturers typically set emission 
design targets at about 50% of the 
standard. Thus, EPA believes the 
proposed standard would be met by

current gasoline vehicles. Similarly, 
since current diesel vehicles generally 
have even lower CH4 emissions than 
gasoline vehicles, EPA believes that 
diesels would also meet the proposed 
standard. However, EPA also believes 
that to set a CH4 emission standard more 
stringent than the proposed standard 
could effectively make the Tier 2 NMOG 
standard more stringent. 
In recent model years, a small number 
of cars and light trucks were sold that 
were designed for dedicated use of 
compressed natural gas (CNG) that met 
Tier 2 emission standards. While 
emission control designs on these recent 
dedicated CNG-fueled vehicles 
demonstrate CH4 control as effective as 
gasoline or diesel equivalent vehicles, 
CNG-fueled vehicles have historically 
produced significantly higher CH4 
emissions than gasoline or diesel 
vehicles. This is because their CNG fuel 
is essentially methane and any 
unburned fuel that escapes combustion 
and not oxidized by the catalyst is 
emitted as methane. However, even if 
these vehicles meet the Tier 2 NMOG 
standard and appear to have effective 
CH4 control by nature of the NMOG 
controls, Tier 2 standards do not require 
CH4 control. While the proposed CH4 
cap standard should not require any 
different emission control designs 
beyond what is already required to meet 
Tier 2 NMOG standards on a dedicated 
CNG vehicle, the cap will ensure that 
systems maintain the current level of 
CH4 control. EPA is not proposing more 
stringent CH4 standards because the 
same controls that are used to meet Tier 
2 NMOG standards should result in 
effective CH4 control. Increased CH4 
stringency beyond proposed levels 
could inadvertently result in increased 
Tier 2 NMOG stringency absent an 
emission control technology unique to 
CH4. Since CH4 is already measured 
under the current Tier 2 regulations (so 
that it may be subtracted to calculate 
non-methane hydrocarbons), the 
proposed standard would not result in 
additional testing costs. EPA requests 
comment on whether the proposed cap 
standard would result in any significant 
technological challenges for makers of 
CNG vehicles. 
7. Small Entity Deferment 
EPA is proposing to defer setting GHG 
emissions standards for small entities 
meeting the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) criteria of a small 
business as described in 13 CFR 
121.201. EPA would instead consider 
appropriate GHG standards for these 
entities as part of a future regulatory 
action. This includes small entities in 
three distinct categories of businesses 
for light-duty vehicles: small volume 
manufacturers, independent commercial 
importers (ICIs), and alternative fuel 
vehicle converters. EPA has identified 
about 13 entities that fit the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) criterion 
of a small business. EPA estimates there 
are 2 small volume manufacturers, 8 
ICIs, and 3 alternative fuel vehicle 
converters currently in the light-duty 
vehicle market. EPA estimates that these 
small entities comprise less than 0.1 
percent of the total light-duty vehicle 
sales in the U.S., and therefore the 
proposed deferment will have a 
negligible impact on the GHG emissions 
reductions from the proposed standards. 
Further detail is provided in Section 
III.I.3, below. 
To ensure that EPA is aware of which 
companies would be deferred, EPA is 
proposing that such entities submit a 
declaration to EPA containing a detailed 
written description of how that 
manufacturer qualifies as a small entity 
under the provisions of 13 CFR 121.201. 
Because such entities are not 
automatically exempted from other EPA 
regulations for light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks, absent such a 
declaration, EPA would assume that the 
entity was subject to the greenhouse gas 
control requirements in this GHG 
proposal. The declaration would need to 
be submitted at time of vehicle 
emissions certification under the EPA 
Tier 2 program. Small entities are 
currently covered by a number of EPA 
motor vehicle emission regulations, and 
they routinely submit information and 
data on an annual basis as part of their 
compliance responsibilities. EPA 
expects that the additional paperwork 
burden associated with completing and 
submitting a small entity declaration to 
gain deferral from the proposed GHG 
standards would be negligible and 
easily done in the context of other 
routine submittals to EPA. However, 
EPA has accounted for this cost with a 
nominal estimate included in the 
Information Collection Request 
completed under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. Additional information 
can be found in the Paperwork 
Reduction Act discussion in Section 
III.I.2. 
C. Additional Credit Opportunities for 
CO2 Fleet Average Program 
The standards being proposed 
represent a significant multi-year 
challenge for manufacturers, especially 
in the early years of the program. 
Section III.B.4 described EPA proposals 
for how manufacturers could generate 
credits by achieving fleet average CO2 
emissions below the fleet average 
standard, and also how manufacturers 
could use credits to comply with 
standards. As described in Section 
III.B.4, credits could be carried forward 
five years, carried back three years, 
transferred between vehicle categories, 
and traded between manufacturers. The 
credits provisions proposed below 
would provide manufacturers with 
additional ways to earn credits starting 
in MY 2012. EPA is also proposing early 
credits provisions for the 2009–2011 
model years, as described below in 
Section III.C.5. 
The provisions proposed below 
would provide additional flexibility, 
especially in the early years of the 
program. This flexibility helps to 
address issues of lead-time or technical 
feasibility for various manufacturers and 
in several cases provides an incentive 
for promotion of technology pathways 
that warrant further development, 
whether or not they are an important or 
central technology on which critical 
features of this program are premised. 
EPA is proposing a variety of credit 
opportunities because manufacturers are 
not likely to be in a position to use 
every credit provision. EPA expects that 
manufacturers are likely to select the 
credit opportunities that best fit their 
future plans. EPA believes it is critical 
that manufacturers have options to ease 
the transition to the final MY 2016 
standards. At the same time, EPA 
believes these credit programs must be 
designed in a way to ensure that they 
achieve emission reductions that 
achieve real-world reductions over the 
full useful life of the vehicle (or, in the 
case of FFV credits and Advanced 
Technology credits, to incentivize the 
introduction of those vehicle 
technologies) and are verifiable. In 
addition, EPA wants to ensure these 
credit programs do not provide an 
opportunity for manufacturers to earn 
‘‘windfall’’ credits. EPA seeks comments 
on how to best ensure these objectives 
are achieved in the design of the credit 
programs. EPA requests comment on all 
aspects of these proposed credits 
provisions. 
1. Air Conditioning Related Credits 
EPA proposes that manufacturers be 
able to generate and use credits for 
improved air conditioner (A/C) systems 
in complying with the CO2 fleetwide 
average standards described above. EPA 
expects that most manufacturers will 
choose to utilize the A/C provisions as 
part of its compliance demonstration 
(and for this reason cost of compliance 
with A/C related emission reductions 
are assumed in the cost analysis). The 
A/C provisions are structured as credits, 
unlike the CO2 standards for which 
manufacturers will demonstrate

139 See Chapter 2, section 2.2.1.2 of the DRIA. 
140 The global warming potentials (GWP) used in 
the NPRM analysis are consistent with 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). At this time, the 
IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) global 
warming potential values have been agreed upon as 
the official U.S. framework for addressing climate 
change. The IPCC SAR GWP values are used in the 
official U.S. greenhouse gas inventory submission 
to the climate change framework. When inventories 
are recalculated for the final rule, changes in GWP 
used may lead to adjustments. 
141 Refrigerant emissions during maintenance and 
at the end of the vehicle’s life (as well as emissions 
during the initial charging of the system with 
refrigerant) are also addressed by the CAA Title VI 
stratospheric ozone program, as described below. 
142 We will not be addressing changes to the 
weight of the A/C system, since the issue of CO2 
emissions from the fuel consumption of normal 
(non-A/C) operation, including basic vehicle 
weight, is inherently addressed with the primary 
CO2 standards (See III.B above). 
compliance using 2-cycle tests (see 
Sections III.B and III.E.). Those tests do 
not measure either A/C leakage or 
tailpipe CO2 emissions attributable to 
A/C load (see Section III.C.1.b below 
describing proposed alternative test 
procedures for assessing tailpipe CO2 
emission attributable to 
A/C engine load). Thus, it is a 
manufacturer’s option to include A/C 
GHG emission reductions as an aspect 
of its compliance demonstration. Since 
this is an elective alternative, EPA is 
referring to the A/C part of the proposal 
as a credit. 
EPA estimates that direct A/C GHG 
emissions—emissions due to the leakage 
of the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant in 
common use today—account for 4.3% of 
CO2-equivalent GHGs from light-duty 
cars and trucks. This includes the direct 
leakage of refrigerant as well as the 
subsequent leakage associated with 
maintenance and servicing, and with 
disposal at the end of the vehicle’s life. 
The emissions that are impacted by 
leakage reductions are the direct leakage 
and the maintenance and servicing. 
Together these are equivalent to CO2 
emissions of approximately 13.6 g/mi 
per vehicle (this is 14.9 g/mi if end of 
life emissions are also included). EPA 
also estimates that indirect GHG 
emissions (additional CO2 emitted due 
to the load of the A/C system on the 
engine) account for another 3.9% of 
light-duty GHGs.139 This is equivalent 
to CO2 emissions of approximately 14.2 
g/mi per vehicle. The derivation of these 
figures can be found in the EPA DRIA. 
EPA believes that it is important to 
address A/C direct and indirect 
emissions because the technologies that 
manufacturers will employ to reduce 
vehicle exhaust CO2 will have little or 
no impact on A/C related emissions. 
Without addressing A/C-related 
emissions, as vehicles become more 
efficient, the A/C related contribution 
will become a much larger portion of 
the overall vehicle GHG emissions. 
Over 95% of the new cars and light 
trucks in the United States are equipped 
with A/C systems and, as noted, there 
are two mechanisms by which A/C 
systems contribute to the emissions of 
greenhouse gases: through leakage of 
refrigerant into the atmosphere and 
through the consumption of fuel to 
provide power to the A/C system. With 
leakage, it is the high global warming 
potential (GWP) of the current 
automotive refrigerant—R134a, with a 
GWP of 1430—that results in the CO2- 
equivalent impact of 13.6 g/mi.140 Due 
to the high GWP of this HFC, a small 
leakage of the refrigerant has a much 
greater global warming impact than a 
similar amount of emissions of CO2 or 
other mobile source GHGs. 
Manufacturers can choose to reduce 
A/C leakage emissions by using leak- 
tight components. Also, manufacturers 
can largely eliminate the global 
warming impact of leakage emissions by 
adopting systems that use an alternative, 
low-GWP refrigerant.141 The A/C system 
also contributes to increased CO2 
emissions through the additional work 
required to operate the compressor, 
fans, and blowers. This additional work 
typically is provided through the 
engine’s crankshaft, and delivered via 
belt drive to the alternator (which 
provides electric energy for powering 
the fans and blowers) and A/C 
compressor (which pressurizes the 
refrigerant during A/C operation). The 
additional fuel used to supply the 
power through the crankshaft necessary 
to operate the A/C system is converted 
into CO2 by the engine during 
combustion. This incremental CO2 
produced from A/C operation can thus 
be reduced by increasing the overall 
efficiency of the vehicle’s A/C system, 
which in turn will reduce the additional 
load on the engine from A/C 
operation.142 
Manufacturers can make very feasible 
improvements to their 
A/C systems to address A/C system 
leakage and efficiency. EPA proposes 
two separate credit approaches to 
address leakage reductions and 
efficiency improvements independently. 
A proposed leakage reduction credit 
would take into account the various 
technologies that could be used to 
reduce the GHG impact of refrigerant 
leakage, including the use of an 
alternative refrigerant with a lower 
GWP. A proposed efficiency 
improvement credit would account for 
the various types of hardware and 
control of that hardware available to 
increase the A/C system efficiency. 
Manufacturers would be required to 
attest the durability of the leakage 
reduction and the efficiency 
improvement technologies over the full 
useful life of the vehicle. 
EPA believes that both reducing A/C 
system leakage and increasing efficiency 
are highly cost-effective and 
technologically feasible. EPA expects 
most manufacturers will choose to use 
these A/C credit provisions, although 
some may not find it necessary to do so. 
a. A/C Leakage Credits 
The refrigerant used in vehicle A/C 
systems can get into the atmosphere by 
many different means. These refrigerant 
emissions occur from the slow leakage 
over time that all closed high pressure 
systems will experience. Refrigerant loss 
occurs from permeation through hoses 
and leakage at connectors and other 
parts where the containment of the 
system is compromised. The rate of 
leakage can increase due to 
deterioration of parts and connections 
as well. In addition, there are emissions 
that occur during accidents and 
maintenance and servicing events. 
Finally, there are end-of-life emissions 
if, at the time of vehicle scrappage, 
refrigerant is not fully recovered. 
Because the process of refrigerant 
leakage has similar root causes as those 
that cause fuel evaporative emissions 
from the fuel system, some of the 
control technologies are similar 
(including hose materials and 
connections). There are however, some 
fundamental differences between the 
systems that require a different 
approach. The most notable difference 
is that A/C systems are completely 
closed systems, whereas the fuel system 
is not. Fuel systems are meant to be 
refilled as liquid fuel is consumed by 
the engine, while the A/C system ideally 
should never require ‘‘recharging’’ of the 
contained refrigerant. Thus it is critical 
that the A/C system leakages be kept to 
an absolute minimum. These emissions 
are typically too low to accurately 
measure in most current SHED 
chambers designed for fuel evaporative 
emissions measurement, especially for 
systems that are new or early in life. 
Therefore, if leakage emissions were to 
be measured directly, new measurement 
facilities would need to be built by the 
OEM manufacturers and very accurate 
new test procedures would need to be 
developed. Especially because there are 
indications that much of the industry is 
moving toward alternative refrigerants 
(post-2016 for most manufacturers), EPA 
is not proposing such a direct 
measurement approach to addressing 
refrigerant leakage.

49528 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
143 Team 1–Refrigerant Leakage Reduction: Final 
Report to Sponsors, SAE, 2007. 
144 Although see 71 FR 55140 (Sept. 21, 2006) 
(proposal pursuant to section 612 of the CAA 
finding CO2 and HFC 152a as acceptable refrigerant 
substitutes as replacements for CFC–12 in motor 
vehicle air conditioning systems, and stating (at 
55142) that ‘‘data … indicate that use of CO2 and 
HFC 152a with risk mitigation technologies does 
not pose greater risks compared to other 
substitutes’’). 
145 For example, the GWP for R152a is 120, the 
GWP of HFO–1234yf is 4, and the GWP of CO2 as 
a refrigerant is 1. 
Instead, EPA proposes that 
manufacturers demonstrate 
improvements in their A/C system 
designs and components through a 
design-based method. Manufacturers 
implementing systems expected to 
result in reduced refrigerant leakage 
would be eligible for credits that could 
then be used to meet their CO2 emission 
compliance requirements. The proposed 
‘‘A/C Leakage Credit’’ provisions would 
generally assign larger credits to system 
designs that are expected to result in 
greater leakage reduction. In addition, 
EPA proposes that proportionately 
larger A/C Leakage Credits be available 
to manufacturers that substitute a lower- 
GWP refrigerant for the current R134a 
refrigerant. 
Our proposed method for calculating 
A/C Leakage Credits is based closely on 
an industry-consensus leakage scoring 
method, described below. This leakage 
scoring method is correlated to 
experimentally-measured leakage rates 
from a number of vehicles using the 
different available A/C components. 
Under the proposed approach, 
manufacturers would choose from a 
menu of A/C equipment and 
components used in their vehicles in 
order to establish leakage scores which 
would characterize their A/C system 
leakage performance. The leakage score 
can be compared to expected fleetwide 
leakage rates in order to quantify 
improvements for a given A/C system. 
Credits would be generated from leakage 
reduction improvements that exceeded 
average fleetwide leakage rates. 
EPA believes that the design-based 
approach would result in estimates of 
likely leakage emissions reductions that 
would be comparable to those that 
would eventually result from 
performance-based testing. At the same 
time, comments are encouraged on all 
developments that may lead to a robust, 
practical, performance-based test for 
measuring A/C refrigerant leakage 
emissions. 
The cooperative industry and 
government Improved Mobile Air 
Conditioning (IMAC) program 143 has 
demonstrated that new-vehicle leakage 
emissions can be reduced by 50%. This 
program has shown that this level of 
improvement can be accomplished by 
reducing the number and improving the 
quality of the components, fittings, 
seals, and hoses of the A/C system. All 
of these technologies are already in 
commercial use and exist on some of 
today’s systems. 
EPA is proposing that a manufacturer 
wishing to earn A/C Leakage Credits 
would compare the components of its 
A/C system with a set of leakage- 
reduction technologies and actions that 
is based closely on that being developed 
through IMAC and the Society of 
Automotive Engineers (as SAE Surface 
Vehicle Standard J2727, August 2008 
version). The J2727 approach is 
developed from laboratory testing of a 
variety of A/C related components, and 
EPA believes that the J2727 leakage 
scoring system generally represents a 
reasonable correlation with average real- 
world leakage in new vehicles. Like the 
IMAC approach, our proposed credit 
approach would associate each 
component with a specific leakage rate 
in grams per year identical to the values 
in J2727. A manufacturer choosing to 
claim Leakage Credits would sum the 
leakage values for an A/C system for a 
total A/C leakage score. EPA is 
proposing a formula for converting the 
grams-per-year leakage score to a grams- 
per-mile CO2eq value, taking vehicle 
miles traveled (VMT) and the GWP of 
the refrigerant into account. This 
formula is: 
Credit = (MaxCredit) * [1 ¥ (LeakScore/ 
AvgImpact) * (GWPRefrigerant/ 
1430)] 
Where: 
MaxCredit is 12.6 and 15.7 g/mi CO2eq for 
cars and trucks respectively. These 
become 13.8 and 17.2 for cars and trucks 
if alternative refrigerants are used since 
they get additional credits for end-of-life 
emissions reductions. 
LeakScore is the leakage score of the A/C 
system as measured according to 
methods similar to the J2727 procedure 
in units of g/yr. The minimum score 
which is deemed feasible is fixed at 8.3 
and 10.4 g/yr for cars and trucks 
respectively. 
AvgImpact is the average impact of A/C 
leakage, which is 16.6 and 20.7 g/yr for 
cars and trucks respectively. 
GWPRefrigerant is the global warming 
potential for direct radiative forcing of 
the refrigerant as defined by EPA (or 
IPCC). 
All of the parameters and limits of the 
equation are derived in the EPA DRIA. 
For systems using the current 
refrigerant, EPA proposes that these 
emission rates could at most be feasibly 
reduced by half, based on the 
conclusions of the IMAC study, and 
consideration of emission over the full 
life of the vehicle. (This latter point is 
discussed further in the DRIA.) 
As discussed above, EPA recognizes 
that substituting an alternative 
refrigerant (one with a significantly 
lower global warming potential, GWP), 
would potentially be a very effective 
way to reduce the impact of all forms of 
refrigerant emissions, including 
maintenance, accidents, and vehicle 
scrappage. To address future GHG 
regulations in Europe and California, 
systems using alternative refrigerants— 
including HFO1234yf, with a GWP of 
4—are under serious development and 
have been demonstrated in prototypes 
by A/C component suppliers. These 
alternative refrigerants have remaining 
cost, safety and feasibility hurdles for 
commercial applications.144 However, 
the European Union has enacted 
regulations phasing in alternative 
refrigerants with GWP less than 150 
starting in 2010, and the State of 
California proposed providing credits 
for alternative refrigerant use in its GHG 
rule. 
Within the timeframe of 2012–2016, 
EPA is not expecting the use of low- 
GWP refrigerants to be widespread. 
However, EPA believes that these 
developments are promising, and have 
included in our proposed A/C Leakage 
Credit system provisions to account for 
the effective refrigerant reductions that 
could be expected from refrigerant 
substitution. The quantity of A/C 
Leakage Credits that would be available 
would be a function of the GWP of the 
alternative refrigerant, with the largest 
credits being available for refrigerants 
approaching a GWP of zero.145 For a 
hypothetical alternative refrigerant with 
a GWP of 1, effectively eliminating 
leakage as a GHG concern, our proposed 
credit calculation method could result 
in maximum credits equal total average 
emissions, or credits of 13.4 and 17.8 
g/mi CO2eq for cars and trucks, 
respectively. This option is also 
captured in the equation above. 
It is possible that alternative 
refrigerants could, without 
compensating action by the 
manufacturer, reduce the efficiency of 
the A/C system (see discussion of the A/ 
C Efficiency Credit below.) However, 
EPA believes that manufacturers will 
have substantial incentives to design 
their systems to maintain the efficiency 
of the A/C system, therefore EPA is not 
accounting for any potential efficiency 
degradation. 
EPA requests comment on all aspects 
of our proposed A/C Leakage Credit 
system.

b. A/C Efficiency Credits 
EPA is proposing that manufacturers 
that make improvements in their A/C 
systems to increase efficiency and thus 
reduce CO2 emissions due to A/C 
system operation be eligible for A/C 
Efficiency Credits. As with A/C Leakage 
Credits, manufacturers could apply A/C 
Efficiency Credits toward compliance 
with their overall CO2 standards. 
As mentioned above, EPA estimates 
that the CO2 emissions due to A/C 
related loads on the engine account for 
approximately 3.9% of total greenhouse 
gas emissions from passenger vehicles 
in the United States. Usage of A/C 
systems is inherently higher in hotter 
and more humid months and climates; 
however, vehicle owners may use their 
A/C systems all year round in all parts 
of the nation. For example, people 
commonly use A/C systems to cool and 
dehumidify the cabin air for passenger 
comfort on hot humid days, but they 
also use the systems to de-humidify 
cabin air to assist in defogging/de-icing 
the front windshield and side glass in 
cooler weather conditions for improved 
visibility. A more detailed discussion of 
seasonal and geographical A/C usage 
rates can be found in the DRIA. 
Most of the additional load on the 
engine from A/C system operation 
comes from the compressor, which 
pumps the refrigerant around the system 
loop. Significant additional load on the 
engine may also come from electric or 
hydraulic fans, which are used to move 
air across the condenser, and from the 
electric blower, which is used to move 
air across the evaporator and into the 
cabin. Manufacturers have several 
currently-existing technology options 
for improving efficiency, including 
more efficient compressors, fans, and 
motors, and systems controls that avoid 
over-chilling the air (and subsequently 
re-heating it to provide the desired air 
temperature with an associated loss of 
efficiency). For vehicles equipped with 
automatic climate-control systems, real- 
time adjustment of several aspects of the 
overall system (such as engaging the full 
capacity of the cooling system only 
when it is needed, and maximizing the 
use of recirculated air) can result in 
improved efficiency. Table III.C.1–1 
below lists some of these technologies 
and their respective efficiency 
improvements. 
As with the A/C Leakage Credit 
program, EPA is interested in 
performance-based standards (or 
credits) based on measurement 
procedures whenever possible. While 
design-based assessments of expected 
emissions can be a reasonably robust 
way of quantifying emission 
improvements, these approaches have 
inherent shortcomings, as discussed for 
the case of A/C leakage above. Design- 
based approaches depend on the quality 
of the data from which they are 
calibrated, and it is possible that 
apparently proper equipment may 
function less effectively than expected. 
Therefore, while the proposal uses a 
design-based menu approach to quantify 
improvements in A/C efficiency, it is 
also proposed to begin requiring 
manufacturers to confirm that 
technologies applying for Efficiency 
Credits are measurably improving 
system efficiency. 
EPA believes that there is a more 
critical need for a test procedure to 
quantify A/C Efficiency Credits than for 
Leakage Credits, for two reasons. First, 
the efficiency gains for various 
technologies are more difficult to 
quantify using a design-based program 
(like the SAEJ2727-based procedure 
used to generate Leakage Credits). 
Second, while leakage may disappear as 
a significant source of GHG emissions if 
a shift toward alternate refrigerants 
develops, no parallel factor exists in the 
case of efficiency improvements. EPA is 
thus proposing to phase-in a 
performance-based test procedure over 
time beginning in 2014, as discussed 
below. In the interim, EPA proposes a 
design-based ‘‘menu’’ approach for 
estimating efficiency improvements 
and, thus, quantifying A/C Efficiency 
Credits. 
For model years 2012 and 2013, EPA 
proposes that a manufacturer wishing to 
generate A/C Efficiency Credits for a 
group of its vehicles with similar A/C 
systems would compare several of its 
vehicle A/C-related components and 
systems with a ‘‘menu’’ of efficiency- 
related technology improvements (see 
Table III.C.1–1 below). Based on the 
technologies the manufacturer chooses, 
an A/C Efficiency Credit value would be 
established. This design-based approach 
would recognize the relationships and 
synergies among efficiency-related 
technologies. Manufacturers could 
receive credit based on the technologies 
they chose to incorporate in their A/C 
systems and the associated credit value 
for each technology. The total A/C 
Efficiency Credit would be the total of 
these values, up to a maximum feasible 
credit of 5.7 g/mi CO2eq. This would be 
the maximum improvement from 
current average efficiencies for A/C 
systems (see the DRIA for a full 
discussion of our derivation of the 
proposed reductions and credit values 
for individual technologies and for the 
maximum total credit available). 
Although the total of the individual 
technology credit values may exceed 5.7 
g/mi CO2eq, synergies among the 
technologies mean that the values are 
not additive, and thus A/C Efficiency 
credit could not exceed 5.7 g/mi CO2eq. 
The EPA requests comment on 
adjusting the A/C efficiency credit to 
account for potential decreases (or 
increases) in efficiency when using an 
alternative refrigerant by using the 
change in the coefficient of 
performance. The effects may include 
the impact of a secondary loop system 
(including the incremental effect on 
tailpipe CO2 emissions that the added 
weight of such a system would incur).

49530 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
For model years 2014 and later, EPA 
proposes that manufacturers seeking to 
generate A/C Efficiency Credits would 
need to use a specific performance test 
to confirm that the design changes were 
also improving A/C efficiency. 
Manufacturers would need to perform 
an A/C CO2 Idle Test for each A/C 
system (family) for which it desired to 
generate Efficiency Credits. 
Manufacturers would need to 
demonstrate at least a 30% 
improvement over current average 
efficiency levels to qualify for credits. 
Upon qualifying on the Idle Test, the 
manufacturer would be eligible to use 
the menu approach above to quantify 
the credits it would earn. 
The proposed A/C CO2 Idle Test 
procedure, which EPA has designed 
specifically to measure A/C CO2 
emissions, would be performed while 
the vehicle engine is at idle. This 
proposed laboratory idle test would be 
similar to the idle carbon monoxide 
(CO) test that was once a part of EPA 
vehicle certification. The test would 
determine the additional CO2 generated 
at idle when the A/C system is operated. 
The A/C CO2 Idle Test would be run 
with and without the A/C system 
cooling the interior cabin while the 
vehicle’s engine is operating at idle and 
with the system under complete control 
of the engine and climate control system 
The proposed A/C CO2 Idle Test is 
similar to that proposed in April 2009 
for the Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule, 
with several improvements. These 
improvements include tighter 
restrictions on test cell temperatures 
and humidity levels in order to more 
closely control the loads from operation 
of the A/C system. EPA also made 
additional refinements to the required 
in-vehicle blower fan settings for 
manually controlled systems to more 
closely represent ‘‘real world’’ usage 
patterns. These details can be found in 
the DRIA and the regulations. 
The design of the A/C CO2 Idle Test 
represents a balancing of the need for 
performance tests whenever possible to 
ensure the most accurate quantification 
of efficiency improvements, with 
practical concerns for testing burden 
and facility requirements. EPA believes 
that the proposed Idle Test adds to the 
robust quantification of A/C credits that 
will result in real-world efficiency 
improvements and reductions in A/C- 
related CO2 emissions. EPA is proposing 
that the Idle Test be required in order 
to qualify for A/C Efficiency Credits 
beginning in 2014 to allow sufficient 
time for manufacturers to make the 
necessary facilities improvements and 
to establish a comfort level with the test. 
EPA also considered a more 
comprehensive testing approach to 
quantifying A/C CO2 emissions that 
could be somewhat more technically 
robust, but would require more test time 
and test facility improvements for many 
manufacturers. This approach would be 
to adapt an existing test procedure, the 
Supplemental Federal Test Procedure 
(SFTP) for A/C operation, called the 
SC03, in specific ways for it to function 
as a tool to evaluate A/C CO2 emissions. 
The potential test method is described 
in some detail here, and EPA 
encourages comment on how this type 
of test might or might not accomplish 
the goals of robust performance-based 
testing and reasonable test burdens. 
EPA designed the SC03 test to 
measure criteria pollutants under severe 
air conditioning conditions not 
represented in the FTP and Highway 
Fuel Economy Tests. EPA did not 
specifically design the SC03 to measure 
incremental reductions in CO2 
emissions from more efficient A/C 
technologies. For example, due to the 
severity of the SC03 test environmental 
conditions and the relatively short 
duration of the SC03 cycle, it is difficult 
for the A/C system to achieve a 
stabilized interior cabin condition that 
reflects incremental improvements. 
Many potential efficiency improvements 
in the A/C components and controls 
(i.e., automatic recirculation and heat 
exchanger fan control) are specifically 
measured only during stabilized 
conditions, and therefore become 
difficult or impossible to measure and 
quantify during this test. In addition, 
SC03 testing is also somewhat 
constrained and costly due to limited 
number of test facilities currently 
capable of performing testing under the 
required environmental conditions. 
One value of using the SC03 as the 
basis for a new test to quantify A/C- 
related efficiency improvements would 
be the significant degree of control of 
test cell ambient conditions. The load 
placed on an A/C system, and thus the 
incremental CO2 emissions, are highly 
dependent on the ambient conditions in 
the test cell, especially temperature and 
humidity, as well as simulated solar 
load. Thus, as with the proposed Idle 
Test, a new SC03-based test would need 
to accurately and reliably control these 
conditions. (This contrasts with FTP 
testing for criteria pollutants, which 
does not require precise control of cell 
conditions because test results are 
generally much less sensitive to changes 
in cell temperature or humidity). 
However, for the purpose of 
quantifying A/C system efficiency 
improvements, EPA believes a test cell 
temperature less severe than the 95°F 
required by the SC03 would be 
appropriate. A cell temperature of 85°F 
would better align the initial cooling 
phase (‘‘pull-down’’) as well as the 
stabilized phase of A/C operation with 
real-world driving conditions. 
Another value of an SC03-based test 
would be the opportunity to create 
operating conditions for vehicle A/C 
systems that in some ways would better 
simulate ‘‘real world’’ operation than 
either the proposed Idle Test or the 
current SC03. The SC03 test cycle, 
roughly 10 minutes in length, has a 
similar average speed, maximum speed, 
and percentage of time at idle as the 
FTP. However, since the SC03 test cycle 
was designed principally to measure 
criteria pollutants under maximum A/C 
load conditions, it is not long enough to 
allow temperatures in the passenger 
cabin to consistently stabilize. EPA 
believes that once the pull-down phase 
has occurred and cabin temperatures 
have dropped dramatically to a suitable 
interior comfort level, additional test 
cycle time would be needed to measure 
how efficiently the A/C system operates 
under stabilized conditions. 
To capture the A/C operation during 
stabilized operation, EPA would 
consider adding two phases to the SC03 
test of roughly 10 minutes each. Each 
additional phase would simply be 
repeats of the SC03 drive cycle, with 
two exceptions. During the second 
phase, the A/C system would now be 
operating at cabin temperature at or 
approaching a stabilized condition. 
During the third phase, the A/C system 
would be turned off. The purpose of the 
third phase would be to establish the 
base CO2 emissions with no A/C loads 
on the engine, which would provide a 
baseline for the incremental CO2 due to 
A/C use. EPA would likely weight the 
CO2 g/mi results for the first and second 
phases of the test as follows: 50% for 
phase 1, and 50% for phase 2. From this 
average CO2 the methodology would 
subtract the CO2 result from phase 3, 
yielding an incremental CO2 (in g/mi) 
due to A/C use. 
EPA expects to continue working with 
industry, the California Air Resources 
Board, and other stakeholders to move 
toward increasingly robust performance 
tests for A/C and may include such 
changes in this final rule. EPA requests 
comment on all aspects of our proposed 
A/C Efficiency Credits program.

147 See 49 U.S.C 32906. The mechanism by which 
EPCA provides an incentive for production of FFVs 
is by specifying that their fuel economy is 
determined using a special calculation procedure 
that results in those vehicles being assigned a 
higher fuel economy level than would otherwise 
occur. 49 U.S.C. section 32905(b). This is typically

substances (ODS). The rules 
promulgated under section 608 regulate 
the use and disposal of such substances 
during the service, repair or disposal of 
appliances and industrial process 
refrigeration. In addition, section 608 
and the regulations promulgated under 
it, prohibit knowingly venting or 
releasing ODS during the course of 
maintaining, servicing, repairing or 
disposing of an appliance or industrial 
process refrigeration equipment. Section 
609 governs the servicing of motor 
vehicle air conditioners (MVACs). The 
regulations promulgated under section 
609 (40 CFR part 82, subpart B) 
establish standards and requirements 
regarding the servicing of MVACs. 
These regulations include establishing 
standards for equipment that recovers 
and recycles or only recovers refrigerant 
(CFC–12, HFC 134a, and for blends only 
recovers) from MVACs; requiring 
technician training and certification by 
an EPA-approved organization; 
establishing recordkeeping 
requirements; imposing sales 
restrictions; and prohibiting the venting 
of refrigerants. Section 612 requires EPA 
to review substitutes for class I and class 
II ozone depleting substances and to 
consider whether such substitutes will 
cause an adverse effect to human health 
or the environment as compared with 
other substitutes that are currently or 
potentially available. EPA promulgated 
regulations for this program in 1992 and 
those regulations are located at 40 CFR 
part 82, subpart G. When reviewing 
substitutes, in addition to finding them 
acceptable or unacceptable, EPA may 
also find them acceptable so long as the 
user meets certain use conditions. For 
example, all motor vehicle air 
conditioning system must have unique 
fittings and a uniquely colored label for 
the refrigerant being used in the system. 
EPA views this proposed rule as 
complementing these Title VI programs, 
and not conflicting with them. To the 
extent that manufacturers choose to 
reduce refrigerant leakage in order to 
earn A/C Leakage Credits, this would 
dovetail with the Title VI section 609 
standards which apply to maintenance 
events, and to end-of-vehicle life 
disposal. In fact, as noted, a benefit of 
the proposed A/C credit provisions is 
that there should be fewer and less 
impactive maintenance events for 
MVACs, since there will be less leakage. 
In addition, the credit provisions would 
not conflict (or overlap) with the Title 
VI section 609 standards. EPA also 
believes the menu of leak control 
technologies proposed today would 
complement the section 612 
requirements, because these control 
technologies would help ensure that 
R134a (or other refrigerants) would be 
used in a manner that further minimizes 
potential adverse effects on human 
health and the environment. 
2. Flex Fuel and Alternative Fuel 
Vehicle Credits 
As described in this section, EPA is 
proposing credits for flexible-fuel 
vehicles (FFVs) and alternative fuel 
vehicles starting in the 2012 model year. 
FFVs are vehicles that can run both on 
an alternative fuel and conventional 
fuel. Most FFVs are E–85 vehicles, 
which can run on a mixture of up to 85 
percent ethanol and gasoline. Dedicated 
alternative fuel vehicles are vehicles 
that run exclusively on an alternative 
fuel (e.g., compressed natural gas). 
EPCA includes an incentive under the 
CAFE program for production of dual- 
fueled vehicles or FFVs, and dedicated 
alternative fuel vehicles.146 EPCA’s 
provisions were amended by the EISA 
to extend the period of availability of 
the FFV credits, but to begin phasing 
them out by annually reducing the 
amount of FFV credits that can be used 
in demonstrating compliance with the 
CAFE standards.147 EPCA does not 
premise the availability of the FFV 
credits on actual use of alternative fuel. 
Under EPCA, after MY 2019 no FFV 
credits will be available for CAFE 
compliance.148 Under EPCA, for 
dedicated alternative fuel vehicles, there 
are no limits or phase-out. EPA is 
proposing that FFV and Alternative Fuel 
Vehicle Credits be calculated as a part 
of the calculation of a manufacturer’s 
overall fleet average fuel economy and 
fleet average carbon-related exhaust 
emissions (§ 600.510–12). 
EPA is not proposing to include 
electric vehicles (EVs) or plug-in hybrid 
electric vehicles (PHEVs) in these flex 
fuel and alternative fuel provisions. 
These vehicles would be covered by the 
proposed advanced technology vehicle 
credits provisions described in Section 
III.C.3, so including them here would 
lead to a double counting of credits. 
a. Model Year 2012—2015 Credits 
i. FFVs 
For the GHG program, EPA is 
proposing to allow FFV credits 
corresponding to the amounts allowed 
by the amended EPCA only during the 
period from MYs 2012 to 2015. (As 
discussed below in Section III.E., EPA is 
proposing that CAFE-based FFV credits 
would not be permitted as part of the 
early credits program.) Several 
manufacturers have already taken the 
availability of FFV credits into account 
in their near-term future planning for 
CAFE and this reliance indicates that 
these credits need to be considered in 
considering adequacy of lead time for 
the CO2 standards. EPA thus believes 
that allowing these credits, in the near 
term, would help provide adequate lead 
time for manufacturers to implement the 
new multi-year standards, but that for 
the longer term there is adequate lead 
time without the use of such credits. 
This will also tend to harmonize the 
GHG and the CAFE program during 
these interim years. As discussed below, 
EPA is proposing for MY 2016 and later 
that manufacturers would not receive 
FFV credits unless they reliably 
estimate the extent the alternative fuel 
is actually being used by vehicles in 
order to count the alternative fuel use in 
the vehicle’s CO2 emissions level 
determination. 
As with the CAFE program, EPA 
proposes to base credits on the 
assumption that the vehicles would 
operate 50% of the time on the 
alternative fuel and 50% of the time on 
conventional fuel, resulting in CO2 
emissions that are based on an 
arithmetic average of alternative fuel 
and conventional fuel CO2 emissions.149 
The measured CO2 emissions on the 
alternative fuel would be multiplied by 
a 0.15 volumetric conversion factor 
which is included in the CAFE 
calculation as provided by EPCA. 
Through this mechanism a gallon of 
alternative fuel is deemed to contain 
0.15 gallons of fuel. EPA is proposing to 
take the same approach for 2012–2015 
model years. For example, for a flexible- 
fuel vehicle that emitted 330 g/mi CO2 
operating on E–85 and 350 g/mi CO2 
operating on gasoline, the resulting CO2 
level to be used in the manufacturer’s 
fleet average calculation would be: 
CO g mi2
330 0 15 350

. / 
EPA understands that by using the 
CAFE approach—including the 0.15 
factor—the CO2 emissions value for the 
vehicle is calculated to be significantly 
lower than it actually would be 
otherwise, even if the vehicle were 
assumed to operate on the alternative 
fuel at all times. This represents a 
‘‘credit’’ being provided to FFVs.

EPA notes also that the above 
equation and example are based on an 
FFV that is an E–85 vehicle. EPCA, as 
amended by EISA, also establishes the 
use of this approach, including the 0.15 
factor, for all alternative fuels, not just 
E–85.150 The 0.15 factor is used for B– 
20 (20 percent biofuel and 80 percent 
diesel) FFVs. EPCA also establishes this 
approach, including the 0.15 factor, for 
gaseous-fueled FFVs such as a vehicle 
able to operate on gasoline and CNG.151 
(For natural gas FFVs, EPCA establishes 
a factor of 0.823 gallons of fuel for every 
100 cubic feet a natural gas used to 
calculate a gallons equivalent.) 152 The 
EISA statute’s use of the 0.15 factor in 
this way provides a similar regulatory 
treatment across the various types of 
alternative fuel vehicles. EPA also 
proposes to use the 0.15 factor for all 
FFVs in keeping with the goal of not 
disrupting manufacturers’ near-term 
compliance planning. EPA, in any case, 
expects the vast majority of FFVs to be 
E–85 vehicles, as is the case today. 
The FFV credit limits for CAFE are 
1.2 mpg for model years 2012–2014 and 
1.0 mpg for model year 2015.153 In CO2 
terms, these CAFE limits translate to 
declining CO2 credit limits over the four 
model years, as the CAFE standards 
increase in stringency (as the CAFE 
standard increases numerically, the 
limit becomes a smaller fraction of the 
standard). EPA proposes credit limits 
shown in Table III.C.2–1 based on the 
proposed average CO2 standards for cars 
and trucks. These have been calculated 
by comparing the average proposed 
CAFE standards with and without the 
FFV credits, converted to CO2. EPA 
requests comments on this proposed 
approach. 
TABLE III.C.2–1—FFV CO2 STANDARD 
CREDIT LIMITS (G/MILE) 
Model year Cars Trucks 
2012 .......................... 9.8 17.9 
2013 .......................... 9.3 17.1 
2014 .......................... 8.9 16.3 
2015 .......................... 6.9 12.6 
EPA also requests comments on 
basing the calculated CO2 credit limit on 
the individual manufacturer standards 
calculated from the footprint curves. For 
example, if a manufacturer’s 2012 car 
standard was 260 g/mile, the credit limit 
in CO2 terms would be 9.5 g/mile and 
if it were 270 g/mile the limit would be 
10.2 g/mile. This approach would be 
somewhat more complex and would 
mean that the FFV CO2 credit limits 
would vary by manufacturer as their 
footprint based standards vary. 
However, it would more closely track 
CAFE FFV credit limits. 
ii. Dedicated Alternative Fuel 
Vehicles 
EPA proposes to calculate CO2 
emissions from dedicated alternative 
fuel vehicles for MY 2012—2015 by 
measuring the CO2 emissions over the 
test procedure and multiplying the 
results by the 0.15 conversion factor 
described above. For example, for a 
dedicated alternative fuel vehicle that 
would achieve 330 g/mi CO2 while 
operating on alcohol (ethanol or 
methanol), the effective CO2 emissions 
of the vehicle for use in determining the 
vehicle’s CO2) emissions would be 
calculated as follows: 
CO2 = 330 × 0.15 = 49.5 g/mi 
b. Model Years 2016 and Later 
i. FFVs 
For 2016 and later model years, EPA 
proposes to treat FFVs similarly to 
conventional fueled vehicles in that 
FFV emissions would be based on 
actual CO2 results from emission testing 
on the alternative fuel. The 
manufacturer would also be required to 
demonstrate that the alternative fuel is 
actually being used in the vehicles. The 
manufacturer would need to establish 
the ratio of operation that is on the 
alternative fuel compared to the 
conventional fuel. The ratio would be 
used to weight the CO2 emissions 
performance over the 2-cycle test on the 
two fuels. The 0.15 conversion factor 
would no longer be included in the CO2 
emissions calculation. For example, for 
a flexible-fuel vehicle that emitted 300 
g/mi CO2 operating on E–85 ten percent 
of the time and 350 g/mi CO2 operating 
on gasoline ninety percent of the time, 
the CO2 emissions for the vehicles to be 
used in the manufacturer’s fleet average 
would be calculated as follows: 
CO2 = (300 × 0.10) + (350 × 0.90)= 345 
g/mi 
The most complex part of this 
approach is to establish what data are 
needed for a manufacturer to accurately 
demonstrate use of the alternative fuel. 
One option EPA is considering is 
establishing a rebuttable presumption 
using a ‘‘top-down’’ approach based on 
national E–85 fuel use to assign credits 
to FFVs sold by manufacturers under 
this program. For example, national E– 
85 volumes and national FFV sales 
could be used to prorate E–85 use by 
manufacturer sales volumes and FFVs 
already in-use. EPA would conduct an 
analysis of vehicle miles travelled 
(VMT) by year for all FFVs using its 
emissions inventory MOVES model. 
Using the VMT ratios and the overall E– 
85 sales, E–85 usage could be assigned 
to each vehicle. This method would 
account for the VMT of new FFVs and 
FFVs already in the existing fleet using 
VMT data in the model. The model 
could then be used to determine the 
ratio of E–85 and gasoline for new 
vehicles being sold. Fluctuations in E– 
85 sales and FFV sales would be taken 
into account to adjust the credits 
annually. EPA believes this is a 
reasonable way to apportion E–85 use 
across the fleet. 
If manufacturers decided not to use 
EPA’s assigned credits based on the top- 
down analysis, they would have a 
second option of presenting their own 
data for consideration as the basis for 
credits. Manufacturers have suggested 
demonstrations using vehicle on-board 
data gathering through the use of on- 
board sensors and computers. 
California’s program allows FFV credits 
based on FFV use and envisioned 
manufacturers collecting fuel use data 
from vehicles in fleets with on-site 
refueling. Any approach must 
reasonably ensure that no CO2 
emissions reductions anticipated under 
the program are lost. 
EPA proposes that manufacturers 
would need to present a statistical 
analysis of alternative fuel usage data 
collected on actual vehicle operation. 
EPA is not attempting to specify how 
the data is collected or the amount of 
data needed. However, the analysis 
must be based on sound statistical 
methodology. Uncertainty in the 
analysis must be accounted for in a way 
that provides reasonable certainty that 
the program does not result in loss of 
emissions reductions. EPA requests 
comment on how this demonstration 
could reasonably be made. 
EPA recognizes that under EPCA FFV 
credits are entirely phased-out of the 
CAFE program by MY 2020, and apply 
in the prior years with certain 
limitations, but without a requirement 
that the manufacturers demonstrate 
actual use of the alternative fuel. Under 
this proposal EPA would treat FFV 
credits the same as under EPCA for 
model years 2012–2015, but would 
apply a different approach starting with 
model year 2016. Unlike EPCA, CAA 
section 202(a) does not mandate that 
EPA treat FFVs in a specific way. 
Instead EPA is required to exercise its 
own judgment and determine an 
appropriate approach that best promotes 
the goals of this CAA section. Under 
these circumstances, EPA proposes to 
treat FFVs for model years 2012–2015 
the same as under EPCA, for the lead 
time reasons described above. Starting

with model year 2016, EPA believes the 
appropriate approach is to ensure that 
emissions reduction credits are based 
upon a demonstration that emissions 
reductions have been achieved, to 
ensure the credits are for real reductions 
instead of reductions that have not 
likely occurred. This will promote the 
environmental goals of this proposal. At 
the same time, the ability to generate 
credits upon a demonstration of usage of 
the alternative fuel will provide an 
actual incentive to see that such fuels 
are used. Under the EPCA credit 
provision, there is an incentive to 
produce FFVs but no actual incentive to 
ensure that the alternative fuels are 
used. GHG and energy security benefits 
are only achieved if the alternative fuel 
is actually used, and EPA’s approach 
will now provide such an incentive. 
This approach will promote greater use 
of renewable fuels, as compared to a 
situation where there is a credit but no 
usage requirement. This is also 
consistent with the agency’s overall 
commitment to the expanded use of 
renewable fuels. Therefore EPA is not 
proposing to phase-out the FFV program 
for MYs 2016 and later but instead to 
base the program on real-world 
reductions (i.e., actual vehicle CO2 
emissions levels based on actual use of 
the two fuels, without the 0.15 
conversion factor specified under EISA). 
Based on existing certification data, E– 
85 FFV CO2 emissions are typically 
about 5 percent lower on E–85 than CO2 
emissions on 100 percent gasoline. 
However, currently there is little 
incentive to optimize CO2 performance 
for vehicles when running on E–85. EPA 
believes the above approach would 
provide such an incentive to 
manufacturers and that E–85 vehicles 
could be optimized through engine 
redesign and calibration to provide 
additional CO2 reductions. EPA requests 
comments on the above. 
ii. Dedicated Alternative Fuel 
Vehicles 
EPA proposes that for model years 
2016 and later dedicated alternative fuel 
vehicles, CO2 would be measured over 
the 2-cycle test in order to be included 
in a manufacturer’s fleet average CO2 
calculations. As noted above, this is 
different than CAFE methodology which 
provides a methodology for calculating 
a petroleum-based mpg equivalent for 
alternative fuel vehicles so they can be 
included in CAFE. However, because 
CO2 can be measured directly from 
alternative fuel vehicles over the test 
procedure, EPA believes this is the 
simplest and best approach since it is 
consistent with all other vehicle testing 
under the proposed CO2 program. 
3. Advanced Technology Vehicle 
Credits for Electric Vehicles, Plug-in 
Hybrids, and Fuel Cells 
EPA is proposing additional credit 
opportunities to encourage the early 
commercialization of advanced vehicle 
powertrains, including electric vehicles 
(EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles 
(PHEVs), and fuel cell vehicles. These 
technologies have the potential for more 
significant reductions of GHG emissions 
than any technology currently in 
commercial use, and EPA believes that 
encouraging early introduction of such 
technologies will help to enable their 
wider use in the future, promoting the 
technology-based emission reduction 
goals of section 202(a)(1) of the Clean 
Air Act. 
EPA proposes that these advanced 
technology credits would take the form 
of a multiplier that would be applied to 
the number of vehicles sold such that 
they would count as more than one 
vehicle in the manufacturer’s fleet 
average. These advanced technology 
vehicles would then count more heavily 
when calculating fleet average CO2 
levels. The multiplier would not be 
applied when calculating the 
manufacturer’s foot-print-based 
standard, only when calculating the 
manufacturer’s fleet average levels. EPA 
proposes to use a multiplier in the range 
of 1.2 to 2.0 for all EVs, PHEVs, and fuel 
cell vehicles produced from MY 2012 
through MY 2016. EPA proposes that 
starting in MY 2017, the multiplier 
would no longer be used. As described 
in Section III.C.5, EPA is also proposing 
to allow early advanced technology 
vehicle credits to be generated for model 
years 2009–2011. EPA requests 
comment on the level of the multiplier 
and whether it should be the same value 
for each of these three technologies. 
Further, if EPA determines that a 
multiplier of 2.0, or another level near 
the higher end of this range, is 
appropriate for the final rule, EPA 
requests comment on whether the 
multiplier should be phased down over 
time, such as: 2.0 for MY 2009 through 
MY 2012, 1.8 in MY 2013, 1.6 in MY 
2014, 1.4 in MY 2015, and 1.2 in MY 
2016 (i.e., the multiplier could phase- 
down by 0.2 per year). In addition, EPA 
requests comment on whether or not it 
would be appropriate to differentiate 
between EVs and PHEVs for advanced 
technology credits. Under such an 
approach, PHEVs could be provided a 
lesser multiplier compare to EVs. Also, 
the PHEV multiplier could be prorated 
based on the equivalent electric range 
(i.e., the extent to which the PHEV 
operates on average as an EV) of the 
vehicle in order to incentivize battery 
technology development. This approach 
would give more credits to ‘‘stronger’’ 
PHEV technology. 
EPA has provided this type of credit 
previously, in the Tier 2 program. This 
approach provides an incentive for 
manufacturers to prove out ultra-clean 
technology during the early years of the 
program. In Tier 2, early credits for Tier 
2 vehicles certified to the very cleanest 
bins (equivalent to California’s 
standards for super ultra low emissions 
vehicles (SULEVs) and zero emissions 
vehicles (ZEVs)) had a multiplier of 1.5 
or 2.0.154 The multiplier range of 1.2 to 
2.0 being proposed for GHGs is 
consistent with the Tier 2 approach. 
EPA believes it is appropriate to provide 
incentives to manufacturers to produce 
vehicles with very low emissions levels 
and that these incentives may help pave 
the way for greater and/or more cost 
effective emission reductions from 
future vehicles. EPA would like to 
finalize an approach which 
appropriately balances the benefits of 
encouraging advanced technologies 
with the overall environmental 
reductions of the proposed standards as 
a whole. 
As with other vehicles, CO2 for these 
vehicles would be determined as part of 
vehicle certification, based on emissions 
over the 2-cycle test procedures, to be 
included in the fleet average CO2 levels. 
For electric vehicles, EPA proposes 
that manufacturers would include them 
in the average with CO2 emissions of 
zero grams/mile both for early credits, 
and for the MY 2012–2016 time frame. 
Similarly, EPA proposes to include as 
zero grams/mile of CO2 the electric 
portion of PHEVs (i.e., when PHEVs are 
operating as electric vehicles) and fuel 
cell vehicles. EPA recognizes that for 
each EV that is sold, in reality the total 
emissions off-set relative to the typical 
gasoline or diesel powered vehicle is 
not zero, as there is a corresponding 
increase in upstream CO2 emissions due 
to an increase in the requirements for 
electric utility generation. However, for 
the time frame of this proposed rule, 
EPA is also interested in promoting very 
advanced technologies such as EVs 
which offer the future promise of 
significant reductions in GHG 
emissions, in particular when coupled 
with a broader context which would 
include reductions from the electricity 
generation. For the California Paley 1 
program, California assigned EVs a CO2 
performance value of 130 g/mile, which 
was intended to represent the average 
CO2 emissions required to charge an EV 
using representative CO2 values for the 
California electric utility grid. For this

proposal, EPA is assigning an EV a 
value of zero g/mile, which should be 
viewed as an interim solution for how 
to account for the emission reduction 
potential of this type of vehicle, and 
may not be the appropriate long-term 
approach. EPA requests comment on 
this proposal and whether alternative 
approaches to address EV emissions 
should be considered, including 
approaches for considering the lifecycle 
emissions from such advanced vehicle 
technologies. 
The criteria and definitions for what 
vehicles qualify for the multiplier are 
provided in Section III.E. As described 
in Section III.E, EPA is proposing 
definitions for EVs, PHEVs, and fuel cell 
vehicles to ensure that only credible 
advanced technology vehicles are 
provided credits. 
EPA requests comments on the 
proposed approach for advanced 
technology vehicle credits. 
4. Off-Cycle Technology Credits 
EPA is proposing an optional credit 
opportunity intended to apply to new 
and innovative technologies that reduce 
vehicle CO2 emissions, but for which 
the CO2 reduction benefits are not 
captured over the 2-cycle test procedure 
used to determine compliance with the 
fleet average standards (i.e., ‘‘off-cycle’’). 
Eligible innovative technologies would 
be those that are relatively newly 
introduced in one or more vehicle 
models, but that are not yet 
implemented in widespread use in the 
light-duty fleet. EPA will not approve 
credits for technologies that are not 
innovative or novel approaches to 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Further, any credits for these off-cycle 
technologies must be based on real- 
world GHG reductions not captured on 
the current 2-cycle tests and verifiable 
test methods, and represent average U.S. 
driving conditions. 
Similar to the technologies used to 
reduce A/C system indirect CO2 
emissions such as compressor efficiency 
improvements, eligible technologies 
would not be active during the 2-cycle 
test and therefore the associated 
improvements in CO2 emissions would 
not be captured. EPA will not consider 
technologies to be eligible for these 
credits if the technology has a 
significant impact on CO2 emissions 
over the FTP and HFET tests. Because 
these technologies are not nearly so well 
developed and understood, EPA is not 
prepared to require their utilization to 
meet the CO2 standards. However, EPA 
is aware of some emerging and 
innovative technologies and concepts in 
various stages of development with CO2 
reduction potential that might not be 
adequately captured on the FTP or 
HFET, and that some of these 
technologies might merit some 
additional CO2 credit for the 
manufacturer. Examples include solar 
panels on hybrids or electric vehicles, 
adaptive cruise control, and active 
aerodynamics. EPA believes it would be 
appropriate to provide an incentive to 
encourage the introduction of these 
types of technologies and that a credit 
mechanism is an effective way to do 
this. This optional credit opportunity 
would be available through the 2016 
model year. 
EPA is proposing that manufacturers 
quantify CO2 reductions associated with 
the use of the off-cycle technologies 
such that the credits could be applied 
on a g/mile equivalent basis, as is 
proposed for A/C system improvements. 
Credits would have to be based on real 
additional reductions of CO2 emissions 
and would need to be quantifiable and 
verifiable with a repeatable 
methodology. Such submissions of data 
should be submitted to EPA subject to 
public scrutiny. EPA proposes that the 
technologies upon which the credits are 
based would be subject to full useful life 
compliance provisions, as with other 
emissions controls. Unless the 
manufacturer can demonstrate that the 
technology would not be subject to in- 
use deterioration over the useful life of 
the vehicle, the manufacturer would 
have to account for deterioration in the 
estimation of the credits in order to 
ensure that the credits are based on real 
in-use emissions reductions over the life 
of the vehicle. 
As discussed below, EPA is proposing 
a two-tiered process for demonstrating 
the CO2 reductions of an innovative and 
novel technology with benefits not 
captured by the FTP and HFET test 
procedures. First, a manufacturer would 
determine whether the benefit of the 
technology could be captured using the 
5-cycle methodology currently used to 
determine fuel economy label values. 
EPA established the 5-cycle test 
methods to better represent real-world 
factors impacting fuel economy, 
including higher speeds and more 
aggressive driving, colder temperature 
operation, and the use of air 
conditioning. If this determination is 
affirmative, the manufacturer would 
follow the protocol laid out below and 
in the proposed regulations. If the 
manufacturer finds that the technology 
is such that the benefit is not adequately 
captured using the 5-cycle approach, 
then the manufacturer would have to 
develop a robust methodology, subject 
to EPA approval, to demonstrate the 
benefit and determine the appropriate 
CO2 gram per mile credit. 
a. Technology Demonstration Using 
EPA 5-Cycle Methodology 
As noted above, the CO2 reduction 
benefit of some innovative technologies 
could be demonstrated using the 5-cycle 
approach currently used for EPA’s fuel 
economy labeling program. The 5-cycle 
methodology was finalized in EPA’s 
2006 fuel economy labeling rule,155 
which provides a more accurate fuel 
economy label estimate to consumers 
starting with 2008 model year vehicles. 
In addition to the FTP and HFET test 
procedures, the 5-cycle approach folds 
in the test results from three additional 
test procedures to determine fuel 
economy. The additional test cycles 
include cold temperature operation, 
high temperature, high humidity and 
solar loading, and aggressive and high- 
speed driving; thus these tests could be 
used to demonstrate the benefit of a 
technology that reduces CO2 over these 
types of driving and environmental 
conditions. Using the test results from 
these additional test cycles collectively 
with the 2-cycle data provides a more 
precise estimate of the average fuel 
economy and CO2 emissions of a vehicle 
for both the city and highway 
independently. A significant benefit of 
using the 5-cycle methodology to 
measure and quantify the CO2 
reductions is that the test cycles are 
properly weighted for the expected 
average U.S. operation, meaning that the 
test results could be used without 
further adjustments. 
The use of these supplemental cycles 
may provide a method by which 
technologies not demonstrated on the 
baseline 2-cycles can be quantified. The 
cold temperature FTP can capture new 
technologies that improve the CO2 
performance of vehicles during colder 
weather operation. These improvements 
may be related to warm-up of the engine 
or other operation during the colder 
temperature. An example of such a new, 
innovative technology is a waste heat 
capture device that provides heat to the 
cabin interior, enabling additional 
engine-off operation during colder 
weather not previously enabled due to 
heating and defrosting requirements. 
The additional engine-off time would 
result in additional CO2 reductions that 
otherwise would not have been realized 
without the heat capture technology. 
While A/C credits for efficiency 
improvements will largely be captured 
in the A/C credits proposal through the

certain new technologies may be able to 
use the high temperatures, humidity, 
and solar load of the SC03 test cycle to 
accurately measure their impact. An 
example of a new technology may be a 
refrigerant storage device that 
accumulates pressurized refrigerant 
during driving operation or uses 
recovered vehicle kinetic energy during 
deceleration to pressurize the 
refrigerant. Much like the waste heat 
capture device used in cold weather, 
this device would also allow additional 
engine-off operation while maintaining 
appropriate vehicle interior occupant 
comfort levels. SC03 test data measuring 
the relative impact of innovative A/C- 
related technologies could be applied to 
the 5-cycle equation to quantify the CO2 
reductions of the technology. Another 
example is glazed windows. This 
reflects sunlight away from the cabin so 
that the energy required to stabilize the 
cabin air to a comfortable level is 
decreased. The impact of these windows 
may be measureable on an SC03 test 
(with and without the window option). 
The US06 cycle may be used to 
capture innovative technologies 
designed to reduce CO2 emissions 
during higher speed and more 
aggressive acceleration conditions, but 
not reflected on the 2-cycle tests. An 
example of this is an active 
aerodynamic technology. This 
technology recognizes the benefits of 
reduced aerodynamic drag at higher 
speeds and makes changes to the 
vehicle at those speeds. The changes 
may include active front or grill air 
deflection devices designed to redirect 
frontal airflow. Certain active 
suspension devices designed primarily 
to reduce aerodynamic drag by lowering 
the vehicle at higher speeds may also be 
measured on the US06 cycle. To 
properly measure these technologies on 
the US06, the vehicle would require 
unique load coefficients with and 
without the technologies. The different 
load coefficient (properly weighted for 
the US06 cycle) could effectively result 
in reduced vehicle loads at the higher 
speeds when the technologies are active. 
Similar to the previously discussed 
cycles, the results from the US06 test 
with and without the technology could 
then use the 5-cycle methodology to 
quantify CO2 reductions. 
If the 5-cycle procedures can be used 
to demonstrate the innovative 
technology, then the process would be 
relatively simple. The manufacturer 
would simply test vehicles with and 
without the technology installed or 
operating and compare results. All 
5-cycles would be tested with the 
technology enabled and disabled, and 
the test results would be used to 
calculate a combined city/highway CO2 
value with the technology and without 
the technology. These values would be 
compared to determine the amount of 
the credit; the combined city/highway 
CO2 value with the technology operating 
would be subtracted from the combined 
city/highway CO2 value without the 
technology operating to determine the 
gram per mile CO2 credit. It is likely that 
multiple tests of each of the five test 
procedures would need to be performed 
in order to achieve the necessary strong 
degree of statistical significance of the 
credit determination results. This would 
have to be done for each model type for 
which a credit was being sought, unless 
the manufacturer could demonstrate 
that the impact of the technology was 
independent of the vehicle 
configuration on which it was installed. 
In this case, EPA may consider allowing 
the test to be performed on an engine 
family basis or other grouping. At the 
end of the model year, the manufacturer 
would determine the number of vehicles 
produced subject to each credit amount 
and report that to EPA in the final 
model year report. The gram per mile 
credit value determined with the 5-cycle 
comparison testing would be multiplied 
by the total production of vehicles 
subject to that value to determine the 
total number of credits. 
b. Alternative Off-Cycle Credit 
Methodologies 
In cases where the benefit of a 
technological approach to reducing CO2 
emissions can not be adequately 
represented using existing test cycles, 
EPA will work with and advise 
manufacturers in developing test 
procedures and analytical approaches to 
estimate the effectiveness of the 
technology for the purpose of generating 
credits. Clearly the first step should be 
a thorough assessment of whether the 5- 
cycle approach can be used, but if the 
manufacturer finds that the 5-cycle 
process is fundamentally inadequate for 
the specific technology being 
considered by the manufacturer, then an 
alternative approach may be developed 
and submitted to EPA for approval. The 
demonstration program should be 
robust, verifiable, and capable of 
demonstrating the real-world emissions 
benefit of the technology with strong 
statistical significance. 
The CO2 benefit of some technologies 
may be able to be demonstrated with a 
modeling approach, using engineering 
principles. An example would be where 
a roof solar panel is used to charge the 
on-board vehicle battery. The amount of 
potential electrical power that the panel 
could supply could be modeled for 
average U.S. conditions and the units of 
electrical power translated to equivalent 
fuel energy or annualized CO2 emission 
rate reduction from the captured solar 
energy. The CO2 reductions from other 
technologies may be more challenging 
to quantify, especially if they are 
interactive with the driver, geographic 
location, environmental condition, or 
other aspect related to operation on 
actual roads. In these cases, 
manufacturers might have to design 
extensive on-road test programs. Any 
such on-road testing programs would 
need to be statistically robust and based 
on average U.S. driving conditions, 
factoring in differences in geography, 
climate, and driving behavior across the 
U.S. 
Whether the approach involves on- 
road testing, modeling, or some other 
analytical approach, the manufacturer 
would be required to present a proposed 
methodology to EPA. EPA would 
approve the methodology and credits 
only if certain criteria were met. 
Baseline emissions and control 
emissions would need to be clearly 
demonstrated over a wide range of real 
world driving conditions and over a 
sufficient number of vehicles to address 
issues of uncertainty with the data. Data 
would need to be on a vehicle model- 
specific basis unless a manufacturer 
demonstrated model specific data was 
not necessary. Approval of the approach 
to determining a CO2 benefit would not 
imply approval of the results of the 
program or methodology; when the 
testing, modeling, or analyses are 
complete the results would likewise be 
subject to EPA review and approval. 
EPA believes that manufacturers could 
work together to develop testing, 
modeling, or analytical methods for 
certain technologies, similar to the SAE 
approach used for A/C refrigerant 
leakage credits. 
EPA requests comments on the 
proposed approach for off-cycle 
emissions credits, including comments 
on how best to structure the program. 
EPA particularly requests comments on 
how the case-by-case approach to 
assessing off-cycle innovative 
technology credits could best be 
designed, including ways to ensure the 
verification of real-world emissions 
benefits and to ensure transparency in 
the process of reviewing manufacturer’s 
proposed test methods. 
5. Early Credit Options 
EPA is proposing to allow 
manufacturers to generate early credits 
in model years 2009–2011. As described 
below, credits could be generated 
through early additional fleet average 
CO2 reductions, early A/C system 
improvements, early advanced

156 CAA 177 States refers to States that have 
adopted the California GHG standards. At present, 
there are thirteen CAA 177 States including New 
York, Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, Maine, 
Connecticut, Arizona, New Jersey, New Mexico, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, 
and Washington, DC. 
technology vehicle credits, and early 
off-cycle credits. As with other credits, 
early credits would be subject to a five 
year carry-forward limit based on the 
model year in which they are generated. 
Early credits could also be transferred 
between vehicle categories (e.g., 
between the car and truck fleet) or 
traded among manufacturers without 
limits. The agencies note that CAFE 
credits earned in MYs prior to MY 2011 
will still be available to manufacturers 
for use in the CAFE program in 
accordance with applicable regulations. 
EPA is not proposing certification, 
compliance, or in-use requirements for 
vehicles generating early credits. MY 
2009 would be complete and MY 2010 
would be well underway by the time the 
rule is promulgated. This would make 
certification, compliance, and in-use 
requirements unworkable. As discussed 
below, manufacturers would be required 
to submit an early credits report to EPA 
for approval no later than the time they 
submit their final CAFE report for MY 
2011. This report would need to include 
details on all early credits the 
manufacturer generates, why the credits 
are bona fide, how they are quantified, 
and how they can be verified. 
As a general principle, EPA believes 
these early credit programs must be 
designed in a way to ensure that they 
are capturing real-world reductions. In 
addition, EPA wants to ensure these 
credit programs do not provide an 
opportunity for manufacturers to earn 
‘‘windfall’’ credits that do not result in 
actual, surplus CO2 emission 
reductions. EPA seeks comments on 
how to best ensure these objectives are 
achieved in the design of the early 
credit program options. 
a. Credits Based on Early Fleet Average 
CO2 Reductions 
EPA is proposing opportunities for 
early credit generation in MYs 2009– 
2011 through over-compliance with a 
fleet average CO2 baseline established 
by EPA. EPA is proposing four 
pathways for doing so. Manufacturers 
would select one of the four paths for 
credit generation for the entire three 
year period and could not switch 
between pathways for different model 
years. For two pathways, the baseline 
would be set by EPA to be equivalent to 
the California standards for the relevant 
model year. Generally, manufacturers 
that over-comply with those CARB 
standards would earn credits. Two 
additional pathways, described below, 
would include credits based on over- 
compliance with CAFE standards in 
States that have not adopted the 
California standards. 
Pathway 1 would be to earn credits by 
over-complying with the California 
equivalent baseline over the 
manufacturer’s fleet of vehicles sold 
nationwide. Pathway 2 would be for 
manufacturers to generate credits 
against the baseline only for the fleet of 
vehicles sold in California and the CAA 
section 177 States.156 This approach 
would include any CAA 177 States as of 
the date of promulgation of the Final 
Rule in this proceeding. Manufacturers 
would be required to include both cars 
and trucks in the program. Under 
Pathways 1 and 2, EPA proposes that 
manufacturers would be required to 
cover any deficits incurred against the 
baseline levels established by EPA 
during the three year period 2009–2011 
before credits could be carried forward 
into the 2012 model year. For example, 
a deficit in 2011 would have to be 
subtracted from the sum of credits 
earned in 2009 and 2010 before any 
credits could be applied to 2012 (or 
later) model year fleets. EPA is 
proposing this provision to help ensure 
the early credits generated under this 
program are consistent with the credits 
available under the California program 
during these model years. 
Table III.C.5–1 provides the California 
equivalent baselines EPA proposes to 
use as the basis for CO2 credit 
generation under the California-based 
pathways. These are the California GHG 
standards for the model years shown, 
with a 2.0 g/mile adjustment to account 
for the exclusion of N2O and CH4, which 
are included in the California GHG 
standards, but not included in the 
credits program. Manufacturers would 
generate CO2 credits by achieving fleet 
average CO2 levels below these 
baselines. As shown in the table, the 
California-based early credit pathways 
are based on the California vehicle 
categories. Also, the California-based 
baseline levels are not footprint-based, 
but universal levels that all 
manufacturers would use. 
Manufacturers would need to achieve 
fleet levels below those shown in the 
table in order to earn credits.

EPA proposes that manufacturers 
using Pathways 1 or 2 above would use 
year end car and truck sales in each 
category. Although production data is 
used for the program starting in 2012, 
EPA is proposing to use sales data for 
the early credits program in order to 
apportion vehicles by State. This is 
described further below. Manufacturers 
would calculate actual fleet average 
emissions over the appropriate vehicle 
fleet, either for vehicles sold nationwide 
for Pathway 1, or California plus 177 
States sales for Pathway 2. Early CO2 
credits would be based on the difference 
between the baseline shown in the table 
above and the actual fleet average 
emissions level achieved. Any early 
A/C credits generated by the 
manufacturer, described below in 
Section III.C.5.b, would be included in 
the fleet average level determination. In 
model year 2009, the California CO2 
standards for cars (321 g/mi CO2) are 
only slightly more stringent than the 
2009 CAFE car standard of 27.5 mpg, 
which is approximately equivalent to 
323 g/mi CO2, and the California light- 
truck standard (437 g/mi CO2) is less 
stringent than the equivalent CAFE 
standard, recognizing that there are 
some differences between the way the 
California program and the CAFE

program categorize vehicles. Under the 
proposed option, manufacturers would 
have to show that they over comply over 
the entire three model year time period, 
not just the 2009 model year, to generate 
early credits under either Pathways 1, 2 
or 3. A manufacturer cannot use credits 
generated in model year 2009 unless 
they offset any debits from model years 
2010 and 2011. EPA expects that the 
requirement to over comply over the 
entire time period covering these three 
model years should mean that the 
credits that are generated are real and 
are in excess of what would have 
otherwise occurred. However, because 
of the circumstances involving the 2009 
model year, in particular for companies 
with significant truck sales, there is 
some concern that under Pathways 1, 2, 
and 3, there is a potential for a large 
number of credits generated in 2009 
against the California standard, in 
particular for a number of companies 
who have significantly over-achieved on 
CAFE in recent model years. EPA wants 
to avoid a situation where, contrary to 
expectation, some part of the early 
credits generated by a manufacturer are 
in fact not excess, where companies 
could trade such credits to other 
manufacturers, risking a delay in the 
addition of new technology across the 
industry from the 2012 and later EPA 
CO2 standards. For this reason, EPA 
requests comment on the merits of 
prohibiting the trading of model year 
2009 generated early credits between 
firms. 
In addition, for Pathways 1 and 2, 
EPA proposes that manufacturers may 
also include alternative compliance 
credits earned per the California 
alternative compliance program.157 
These alternative compliance credits are 
based on the demonstrated use of 
alternative fuels in flex fuel vehicles. As 
with the California program, the credits 
would be available beginning in MY 
2010. Therefore, these early alternative 
compliance credits would be available 
under EPA’s program for the 2010 and 
2011 model years. FFVs would 
otherwise be included in the early credit 
fleet average based on their emissions 
on the conventional fuel. This would 
not apply to EVs and PHEVs. The 
emissions of EVs and PHEVs would be 
determined as described in Section III.E. 
Manufacturers could choose to either 
include their EVs and PHEVs in one of 
the four pathways described in this 
section or under the early advanced 
technology emissions credits described 
below, but not both due to issues of 
credit double counting. 
EPA is also proposing two additional 
early credit pathways manufacturers 
could select. Pathways 3 and 4 
incorporate credits based on over- 
compliance with CAFE standards for 
vehicles sold outside of California and 
CAA 177 States in MY 2009–2011. 
Pathway 3 would allow manufacturers 
to earn credits as under Pathway 2, plus 
earn CAFE-based credits in other States. 
Credits would not be generated for cars 
sold in California and CAA 177 States 
unless vehicle fleets in those States are 
performing better than the standards 
which otherwise would apply in those 
States, i.e. the baselines shown in Table 
III.C.5–1 above. 
Pathway 4 would be for 
manufacturers choosing to forego 
California-based early credits entirely 
and earn only CAFE-based credits 
outside of California and CAA 177 
States. EPA proposes that manufacturers 
would not be able to include FFV 
credits under the CAFE-based early 
credit pathways since those credits do 
not automatically reflect actual 
reductions in CO2 emissions. 
The proposed baselines for CAFE- 
based early pathways are provided in 
Table III.C.5–2 below. They are based on 
the CAFE standards for the 2009–2011 
model years. For CAFE standards in 
2009–2011 model years that are 
footprint-based, the baseline would vary 
by manufacturer. Footprint-based 
standards are in effect for the 2011 
model year CAFE standards.158 
Additionally, for Reform CAFE truck 
standards, footprint standards are 
optional for the 2009–2010 model years. 
Where CAFE footprint-based standards 
are in effect, manufacturers would 
calculate a baseline using the footprints 
and sales of vehicles outside of 
California and CAA 177 States. The 
actual fleet CO2 performance calculation 
would also only include the vehicles 
sold outside of California and CAA 177 
States, and as mentioned above, may not 
include FFV credits.

2011 ................................................................... Footprint-based standard ................................. Footprint-based standard. 
* Would be footprint-based standard for manufacturers selecting footprint option under CAFE. 
For the CAFE-based pathways, EPA 
proposes to use the NHTSA car and 
truck definitions that are in place for the 
model year in which credits are being 
generated. EPA understands that the 
NHTSA definitions change starting in 
the 2011 model year, and would 
therefore change part way through the 
early credits program. EPA further 
recognizes that MDPVs are not part of 
the CAFE program until the 2011 model 
year, and therefore would not be part of 
the early credits calculations for 2009– 
2010 under the CAFE-based pathways. 
Pathways 2 through 4 involve 
splitting the vehicle fleet into two 
groups, vehicles sold in California and 
CAA 177 States and vehicles sold 
outside of these States. This approach 
would require a clear accounting of 
location of vehicle sales by the 
manufacturer. EPA believes it will be 
reasonable for manufacturers to 
accurately track sales by State, based on 
its experience with the National Low 
Emissions Vehicle (NLEV) Program. 
NLEV required manufacturers to meet 
separate fleet average standards for 
vehicles sold in two different regions of 
the country.159 As with NLEV, the 
determination would be based on where 
the completed vehicles are delivered as 
a point of first sale, which in most cases 
would be the dealer.160 
As noted above, EPA proposes that 
manufacturers choosing to generate 
early credits would select one of the 
four pathways for the entire early 
credits program and would not be able 
to switch among them. EPA proposes 
that manufacturers would submit their 
early credits report when they submit 
their final CAFE report for MY 2011 
(which is required to be submitted no

later than 90 days after the end of the 
model year). Manufacturers would have 
until then to decide which pathway to 
select. This would give manufacturers 
enough time to determine which 
pathway works best for them. This 
timing may be necessary in cases where 
manufacturers earn credits in MY 2011 
and need time to assess data and 
prepare an early credits submittal for 
final EPA approval. 
The table below provides a summary 
of the four fleet average-based CO2 early 
credit pathways EPA is proposing. As 
noted above, EPA is concerned with 
potential ‘‘windfall’’ credits and is 
seeking comments on how to best 
ensure the objective of achieving 
surplus, real-world reductions is 
achieved in the design of the credit 
programs. In addition, EPA requests 
comments on the merits of each of these 
pathways. Specifically, EPA requests 
comment on whether or not any of the 
pathways could be eliminated to 
simplify the program without 
diminishing its overall flexibility. For 
example, Pathway 2 may not be 
particularly useful to manufacturers if 
the California/177 State and overall 
national fleets are projected to be 
similar during these model years. EPA 
also requests comment on proposed 
program implementation structure and 
provisions. 
TABLE III.C.5–3—SUMMARY OF PROPOSED EARLY FLEET AVERAGE CO2 CREDIT PATHWAYS 
Common Elements ............................................................. —Manufacturers would select a pathway. Once selected, may not switch among 
pathways. 
—All credits subject to 5 year carry-forward restrictions. 
—For Pathways 2–4, vehicles apportioned by State based on point of first sale. 
Pathway 1: California-based Credits for National Fleet. ... —Manufacturers earn credits based on fleet average emissions compared with Cali-
fornia equivalent baseline set by EPA. 
—Based on nationwide CO2 sales-weighted fleet average. 
—Based on use of California vehicle categories. 
—FFV alternative compliance credits per California program may be included. 
—Once in the program, manufacturers must make up any deficits that are incurred 
prior to 2012 in order to carry credits forward to 2012 and later.

California plus CAA 177 States.
—Same as Pathway 1, but manufacturers only includes vehicles sold in California 
and CAA 177 States in the fleet average calculation. 
Pathway 3: Pathway 2 plus CAFE-based Credits outside 
of California plus CAA 177 States.
—Manufacturer earns credits as provided by Pathway 2: California-based credits for

sions compared with baseline set by EPA. 
—CAFE-based credits based on NHTSA car and truck definitions. 
—FFV credits not allowed to be included for CAFE-based credits. 
b. Early A/C Credits 
EPA proposes that manufacturers 
could earn early A/C credits in MYs 
2009–2011 using the same A/C system 
design-based EPA provisions being 
proposed for MYs commencing in 2012, 
as described in Section III.C.1, above. 
Manufacturers would be able to earn 
early A/C CO2-equivalent credits by 
demonstrating improved A/C system 
performance, for both direct and 
indirect emissions. To earn credits for 
vehicles sold in California and CAA 177 
States, the vehicles would need to be 
included in one of the California-based 
early credit pathways described above 
in III.C.5.a. EPA is proposing this 
constraint in order to avoid credit 
double counting with the California 
program in place in those States, which 
also allows A/C system credits in this 
time frame. Manufacturers would fold 
the A/C credits into the fleet average 
CO2 calculations under the California- 
based pathway. For example, the MY 
2009 California-based program car 
baseline would be 321 g/mile (see Table 
III.C.5–1). If a manufacturer under 
Pathway 1 had a MY 2009 car fleet 
average CO2 level of 320 g/mile and 
then earned an additional 9 g/mile 
CO2-equivalent A/C credit, the 
manufacturers would earn a total of 10 
g/mile of credit. Vehicles sold outside of 
California and 177 States would be 
eligible for the early A/C credits 
whether or not the manufacturers 
participate in other aspects of the early 
credits program. 
c. Early Advanced Technology Vehicle 
Credits 
EPA is proposing to allow early 
advanced technology vehicle credits for 
sales of EVs, PHEVs, and fuel cell 
vehicles. To avoid double-counting, 
manufacturers would not be allowed to 
generate advanced technology credits 
for vehicles they choose to include in 
Pathways 1 through 4 described in 
III.C.5.a, above. EPA proposes to use a 
similar methodology to that proposed 
for MYs 2012 and later, as described in 
Section III.C.3, above. EPA proposes to 
use a multiplier in the range of 1.2 to 
2.0 for all eligible vehicles (i.e., EVs, 
PHEVs, and fuel cells). Manufacturers, 
however, would track the number of 
these vehicles sold in the model years 
2009—2011, and the emissions level of 
the vehicles, rather than a CO2 credit. 
When a manufacturer chooses to use the 
vehicle credits to comply with 2012 or 
later standards, the vehicle counts 
including the multiplier would be 
folded into the CO2 fleet average. For 
example, if a manufacturer sells 1,000 
EVs in MY 2011, and if the final 
multiplier level were 2.0, the 
manufacturer would apply the 
multiplier of 2.0 and then be able to 
include 2,000 vehicles at 0 g/mile in 
their MY 2012 fleet to decrease the fleet 
average for that model year. As with 
other early credits, these early advanced 
technology vehicle credits would be 
tracked by model year (2009, 2010, or 
2011) and would be subject to 5 year 
carry-forward restrictions. Again,

manufacturers would not be allowed to 
include the EVs, PHEVs, or fuel cell 
vehicles in the early credit pathways 
discussed above in Section III.C.5.a, 
otherwise the vehicles would be double 
counted. As discussed in Section III.C.3, 
EPA is requesting comment on a 
multiplier in the range of 1.2 to 2.0, 
including a potential phase-down in the 
multiplier by model year 2016, if a 
multiplier near the higher end of this 
range is determined for the final rule. 
This request for comment also extends 
to the potential for early advance 
technology vehicle credits. EPA is also 
requesting comment on the appropriate 
gram/mile metric for EVs and fuel 
cellvehicles, as well as for the EV-only 
contribution for a PHEV. 
d. Early Off-Cycle Credits 
EPA’s proposed off-cycle innovative 
technology credit provisions are 
provided in Section III.C.4. EPA 
requests comment on beginning these 
credits in the 2009–2011 time frame, 
provided manufacturers are able to 
make the necessary demonstrations 
outlined in Section III.C.4, above. 
D. Feasibility of the Proposed CO2 
Standards 
This proposal is based on the need to 
obtain significant GHG emissions 
reductions from the transportation 
sector, and the recognition that there are 
cost-effective technologies to achieve 
such reductions in the 2012–2016 time 
frame. As in many prior mobile source 
rulemakings, the decision on what 
standard to set is largely based on the 
effectiveness of the emissions control 
technology, the cost and other impacts 
of implementing the technology, and the 
lead time needed for manufacturers to 
employ the control technology. The 
standards derived from assessing these 
issues are also evaluated in terms of the 
need for reductions of greenhouse gases, 
the degree of reductions achieved by the 
standards, and the impacts of the 
standards in terms of costs, quantified 
benefits, and other impacts of the 
standards. The availability of 
technology to achieve reductions and 
the cost and other aspects of this 
technology are therefore a central focus 
of this rulemaking. 
EPA is taking the same basic approach 
in this rulemaking, although the 
technological problems and solutions 
involved in this rulemaking differ in 
some ways from prior mobile source 
rulemakings. Here, the focus of the 
emissions control technology is on 
reducing CO2 and other greenhouse 
gases. Vehicles combust fuel to perform 
two basic functions: (1) Transport the 
vehicle, its passengers and its contents, 
and (2) operate various accessories 
during the operation of the vehicle such 
as the air conditioner. Technology can 
reduce CO2 emissions by either making 
more efficient use of the energy that is 
produced through combustion of the 
fuel or reducing the energy needed to 
perform either of these functions. 
This focus on efficiency calls for 
looking at the vehicle as an entire 
system. In addition to fuel delivery, 
combustion, and aftertreatment 
technology, any aspect of the vehicle 
that affects the need to produce energy 
must also be considered. For example, 
the efficiency of the transmission 
system, which takes the energy 
produced by the engine and transmits it 
to the wheels, and the resistance of the 
tires to rolling both have major impacts 
on the amount of fuel that is combusted 
while operating the vehicle. The braking 
system, the aerodynamics of the vehicle, 
and the efficiency of accessories, such 
as the air conditioner, all affect how 
much fuel is combusted. 
In evaluating vehicle efficiency, we 
have excluded fundamental changes in 
vehicles’ size and utility. For example, 
we did not evaluate converting 
minivans and SUVs to station wagons, 
converting vehicles with four wheel 
drive to two wheel drive, or reducing 
headroom in order to lower the roofline 
and reduce aerodynamic drag. We have 
limited our assessment of technical 
feasibility and resultant vehicle cost to 
technologies which maintain vehicle 
utility as much as possible. 
Manufacturers may decide to alter the 
utility of the vehicles which they sell in 
response to this rule. Assessing the 
societal cost of such changes is very 
difficult as it involves assessing 
consumer preference for a wide range of 
vehicle features. 
This need to focus on the efficient use 
of energy by the vehicle as a system 
leads to a broad focus on a wide variety 
of technologies that affect almost all the 
systems in the design of a vehicle. As 
discussed below, there are many 
technologies that are currently available 
which can reduce vehicle energy 
consumption. These technologies are 
already being commercially utilized to a 
limited degree in the current light-duty 
fleet. These technologies include hybrid 
technologies that use higher efficiency 
electric motors as the power source in 
combination with or instead of internal 
combustion engines. While already 
commercialized, hybrid technology 
continues to be developed and offers the 
potential for even greater efficiency 
improvements. Finally, there are other 
advanced technologies under 
development, such as lean burn gasoline 
engines, which offer the potential of 
improved energy generation through 
improvements in the basic combustion 
process. In addition, the available 
technologies are not limited to 
powertrain improvements but also 
include mass reduction, electrical 
system efficiencies, and aerodynamic 
improvements. 
The large number of possible 
technologies to consider and the breadth 
of vehicle systems that are affected 
mean that consideration of the 
manufacturer’s design and production 
process plays a major role in developing 
the proposed standards. Vehicle 
manufacturers typically develop many 
different models by basing them on a 
limited number of vehicle platforms. 
The platform typically consists of a 
common vehicle architecture and 
structural components. This allows for 
efficient use of design and 
manufacturing resources. Given the very 
large investment put into designing and 
producing each vehicle model, 
manufacturers typically plan on a major 
redesign for the models approximately 
every 5 years. At the redesign stage, the 
manufacturer will upgrade or add all of 
the technology and make most other 
changes supporting the manufacturer’s 
plans for the next several years, 
including plans related to emissions, 
fuel economy, and safety regulations. 
This redesign often involves a 
package of changes designed to work 
together to meet the various 
requirements and plans for the model 
for several model years after the 
redesign. This often involves significant 
engineering, development, 
manufacturing, and marketing resources 
to create a new product with multiple 
new features. In order to leverage this 
significant upfront investment, 
manufacturers plan vehicle redesigns 
with several model years of production 
in mind. Vehicle models are not 
completely static between redesigns as 
limited changes are often incorporated 
for each model year. This interim 
process is called a refresh of the vehicle 
and generally does not allow for major 
technology changes although more 
minor ones can be done (e.g., small 
aerodynamic improvements, valve 
timing improvements, etc). More major 
technology upgrades that affect multiple 
systems of the vehicle thus occur at the 
vehicle redesign stage and not in the 
time period between redesigns. 
As discussed below, there are a wide 
variety of CO2 reducing technologies 
involving several different systems in 
the vehicle that are available for 
consideration. Many can involve major 
changes to the vehicle, such as changes 
to the engine block and cylinder heads, 
redesign of the transmission and its

packaging in the vehicle, changes in 
vehicle shape to improve aerodynamic 
efficiency and the application of 
aluminum in body panels to reduce 
mass. Logically, the incorporation of 
emissions control technologies would 
be during the periodic redesign process. 
This approach would allow 
manufacturers to develop appropriate 
packages of technology upgrades that 
combine technologies in ways that work 
together and fit with the overall goals of 
the redesign. It also allows the 
manufacturer to fit the process of 
upgrading emissions control technology 
into its multi-year planning process, and 
it avoids the large increase in resources 
and costs that would occur if technology 
had to be added outside of the redesign 
process. 
This proposed rule affects five years 
of vehicle production, model years 
2012–2016. Given the now-typical five 
year redesign cycle, nearly all of a 
manufacturer’s vehicles will be 
redesigned over this period. However, 
this assumes that a manufacturer has 
sufficient lead time to redesign the first 
model year affected by this proposed 
rule with the requirements of this 
proposed rule in mind. In fact, the lead 
time available for model year 2012 is 
relatively short. The time between a 
likely final rule and the start of 2013 
model year production is likely to be 
just over two years. At the same time, 
manufacturer product plans indicate 
that they are planning on introducing 
many of the technologies EPA projects 
could be used to show compliance with 
the proposed CO2 standards in both 
2012 and 2013. In order to account for 
the relatively short lead time available 
prior to the 2012 and 2013 model years, 
albeit mitigated by their existing plans, 
EPA has factored this reality into how 
the availability is modeled for much of 
the technology being considered for 
model years 2012–2016 as a whole. If 
the technology to control greenhouse 
gas emissions is efficiently folded into 
this redesign process, then EPA projects 
that 85 percent of each manufacturer’s 
sales will be able to be redesigned with 
many of the CO2 emission reducing 
technologies by the 2016 model year, 
and as discussed below, to reduce 
emissions of HFCs from the air 
conditioner. 
In determining the level of this first 
ever GHG emissions standard under the 
CAA for light-duty vehicles, EPA 
proposes to use an approach that 
accounts for and builds on this redesign 
process. This provides the opportunity 
for several control technologies to be 
incorporated into the vehicle during 
redesign, achieving significant 
emissions reductions from the model at 
one time. This is in contrast to what 
would be a much more costly approach 
of trying to achieve small increments of 
reductions over multiple years by 
adding technology to the vehicle piece 
by piece outside of the redesign process. 
As described below, the vast majority 
of technology required by this proposal 
is commercially available and already 
being employed to a limited extent 
across the fleet. The vast majority of the 
emission reductions which would result 
from this proposed rule would result 
from the increased use of these 
technologies. EPA also believes that this 
proposed rule would encourage the 
development and limited use of more 
advanced technologies, such as PHEVs 
and EVs. 
In developing the proposed standard, 
EPA built on the technical work 
performed by the State of California 
during its development of its statewide 
GHG program. EPA began by evaluating 
a nationwide CAA standard for MY 
2016 that would require the levels of 
technology upgrade, across the country, 
which California standards would 
require for the subset of vehicles sold in 
California under Pavley 1. In essence, 
EPA evaluated the stringency of the 
California Pavley 1 program but for a 
national standard. As mentioned above, 
and as described in detail in Section II.C 
of this preamble and Chapter 3 of the 
Joint TSD, one of the important 
technical documents included in EPA 
and NHTSA’s assessment of vehicle 
technology effectiveness and costs was 
the 2004 NESCCAF report which was 
the technical foundation for California’s 
Pavley 1 standard. However, in order to 
evaluate the impact of standards with 
similar stringency on a national basis to 
the California program EPA chose not to 
evaluate the specific California 
standards for several reasons. First, 
California’s standards are universal 
standards (one for cars and one for 
trucks), while EPA is proposing 
attribute-based standards using vehicle 
footprint. Second, California’s 
definitions of what vehicles are 
classified as cars and which are 
classified as trucks are different from 
those used by NHTSA for CAFE 
purposes and different from EPA’s 
proposed classifications in this notice 
(which harmonizes with the CAFE 
definitions). In addition, there has been 
progress in the refinement of the 
estimation of the effectiveness and cost 
estimation for technologies which can 
be applied to cars and trucks since the 
California analysis in 2004 which could 
lead to different relative stringencies 
between cars and trucks than what 
California determined for its Pavley 1 
program. There have also been 
improvements in the fuel economy and 
CO2 performance of the actual new 
vehicle fleet since California’s 2004 
analysis which EPA wanted to reflect in 
our current assessment. For these 
reasons, EPA developed an assessment 
of an equivalent national new vehicle 
fleet-wide CO2 performance standards 
for model year 2016 which would result 
in the new vehicle fleet in the State of 
California having CO2 performance 
equal to the performance from the 
California Pavley 1 standards. This 
assessment is documented in Chapter 
3.1 of the DRIA. The results of this 
assessment predicts that a national 
light-duty vehicle fleet which adopts 
technology that achieves performance of 
250 g/mile CO2 for model year 2016 
would result in vehicles sold in 
California that would achieve the CO2 
performance equivalent to the Pavley 1 
standards. 
EPA then analyzed a level of 250 
g/mi CO2 in 2016 using the OMEGA 
model, and the car and truck footprint 
curves relative stringency discussed in 
Section II to determine what technology 
would be needed to achieve a fleet wide 
average of 250 g/mi CO2. As discussed 
later in this section we believe this level 
of technology application to the light- 
duty vehicle fleet can be achieved in 
this time frame, that such standards will 
produce significant reductions in GHG 
emissions, and that the costs for both 
the industry and the costs to the 
consumer are reasonable. EPA also 
developed standards for the model years 
2012 through 2015 that lead up to the 
2016 level. 
EPA’s independent technical 
assessment of the technical feasibility of 
the proposed MY2012–2016 standards 
is described below. EPA has also 
evaluated a set of alternative standards 
for these model years, one that is more 
stringent than the proposed standards 
and one that is less stringent. The 
technical feasibility of these alternative 
standards is discussed at the end of this 
section. 
Evaluating the feasibility of these 
standards primarily includes identifying 
available technologies and assessing 
their effectiveness, cost, and impact on 
relevant aspects of vehicle performance 
and utility. The wide number of 
technologies which are available and 
likely to be used in combination 
requires a more sophisticated 
assessment of their combined cost and 
effectiveness. An important factor is 
also the degree that these technologies 
are already being used in the current 
vehicle fleet and thus, unavailable for 
use to improve energy efficiency beyond 
current levels. Finally, the challenge for 
manufacturers to design the technology

into their products, and the appropriate 
lead time needed to employ the 
technology over the product line of the 
industry must be considered. 
Applying these technologies 
efficiently to the wide range of vehicles 
produced by various manufacturers is a 
challenging task. In order to assist in 
this task, EPA has developed a 
computerized model called the 
Optimization Model for reducing 
Emissions of Greenhouse gases from 
Automobiles (OMEGA) model. Broadly, 
the model starts with a description of 
the future vehicle fleet, including 
manufacturer, sales, base CO2 
emissions, footprint and the extent to 
which emission control technologies are 
already employed. For the purpose of 
this analysis, over 200 vehicle platforms 
were used to capture the important 
differences in vehicle and engine design 
and utility of future vehicle sales of 
roughly 16 million units in the 2016 
timeframe. The model is then provided 
with a list of technologies which are 
applicable to various types of vehicles, 
along with their cost and effectiveness 
and the percentage of vehicle sales 
which can receive each technology 
during the redesign cycle of interest. 
The model combines this information 
with economic parameters, such as fuel 
prices and a discount rate, to project 
how various manufacturers would apply 
the available technology in order to 
meet various levels of emission control. 
The result is a description of which 
technologies are added to each vehicle 
platform, along with the resulting cost. 
While OMEGA can apply technologies 
which reduce CO2 emissions and HFC 
refrigerant emissions associated with air 
conditioner use, this task is currently 
handled outside of the OMEGA model. 
The model can be set to account for 
various types of compliance flexibilities, 
such as FFV credits. 
EPA invites comment on all aspects of 
this feasibility assessment. Both the 
OMEGA model and its inputs have been 
placed in the docket to this proposed 
rule and available for review. 
The remainder of this section 
describes the technical feasibility 
analysis in greater detail. Section III.D.1 
describes the development of our 
projection of the MY 2012–2016 fleet in 
the absence of this proposed rule. 
Section III.D.2 describes our estimates of 
the effectiveness and cost of the control 
technologies available for application in 
the 2012–2016 timeframe. Section 
III.D.3 combines these technologies into 
packages likely to be applied at the 
same time by a manufacturer. In this 
section, the overall effectiveness of the 
technology packages vis-à-vis their 
effectiveness when combined 
individually is described. Section III.D.4 
describes the process which 
manufacturers typically use to apply 
new technology to their vehicles. 
Section III.D.5 describes EPA’s OMEGA 
model and its approach to estimating 
how manufacturers would add 
technology to their vehicles in order to 
comply with CO2 emission standards. 
Section III.D.6 presents the results of the 
OMEGA modeling, namely the level of 
technology added to manufacturers’ 
vehicles and its cost. Section III.D.7 
discusses the feasibility of the 
alternative 4-percent-per-year and 6- 
percent-per-year standards. Further 
detail on all of these issues can be found 
in EPA and NHTSA’s draft Joint 
Technical Support Document as well as 
EPA’s draft Regulatory Impact Analysis. 
1. How Did EPA Develop a Reference 
Vehicle Fleet for Evaluating Further CO2 
Reductions? 
In order to calculate the impacts of 
this proposed regulation, it is necessary 
to project the GHG emissions 
characteristics of the future vehicle fleet 
absent this proposed regulation. This is 
called the ‘‘reference’’ fleet. EPA 
developed this reference fleet by 
determining the characteristics of a 
specific model year (in this case, 2008) 
of vehicles, called the baseline fleet, and 
then projecting what changes if any 
would be made to these vehicles to 
comply with the MY2011 CAFE 
standards. Thus, the MY 2008 fleet is 
our ‘‘baseline fleet,’’ and the projection 
of the baseline to MY 2011–2016 is 
called the ‘‘reference fleet.’’ 
EPA used 2008 model year vehicles as 
the basis for its baseline fleet. 2008 
model year is the most recent model 
year for which data is publicly 
available. Sources of data for the 
baseline include the EPA vehicle 
certification data, Ward’s Automotive 
Group data, Motortrend.com, 
Edmunds.com, manufacturer product 
plans, and other sources to a lesser 
extent (such as articles about specific 
vehicles) revealed from Internet search 
engine research. EPA then projects this 
fleet out to the 2016 MY, taking into 
account factors such as changes in 
overall sales volume. Section II.B 
describes the development of the EPA 
reference fleet, and further details can 
be found in Section II.B of this preamble 
and Chapter 1 of the Draft Joint TSD. 
The light-duty vehicle market is 
currently in a state of flux due to the 
volatility in fuel prices over the past 
several years and the current economic 
downturn. These factors have changed 
the relative sales of the various types of 
light-duty vehicles marketed, as well as 
total sales volumes. EPA and NHTSA 
desire to account for these changes to 
the degree possible in our forecast of the 
make-up of the future vehicle fleet. EPA 
wants to include improvements in fuel 
economy associated with the existing 
CAFE program. It is possible that 
manufacturers could increase fuel 
economy beyond the level of the 2011 
MY CAFE standards for marketing 
purposes. However, it is difficult to 
separate fuel economy improvements in 
those years for marketing purposes from 
those designed to facilitate compliance 
with anticipated CAFE or CO2 emission 
standards. Thus, EPA limits fuel 
economy improvements in the reference 
fleet to those projected to result from the 
existing CAFE standards. The addition 
of technology to the baseline fleet so 
that it complies with the MY 2011 CAFE 
standards is described later in Section 
III.D.4, as this uses the same 
methodology used to project compliance 
with the proposed CO2 emission 
standards. In summary, the reference 
fleet represents vehicle characteristics 
and sales in the 2012 and later model 
years absent this proposed rule. 
Technology is then added to these 
vehicles in order to reduce CO2 
emissions to achieve compliance with 
the proposed CO2 standards. EPA did 
not factor in any changes to vehicle 
characteristics or sales in projecting 
manufacturers’ compliance with this 
proposal. 
After the reference fleet is created, the 
next step aggregates vehicle sales by a 
combination of manufacturer, vehicle 
platform, and engine design. As 
discussed in Section III.D.4 below, 
manufacturers implement major design 
changes at vehicle redesign and tend to 
implement these changes across a 
vehicle platform. Because the cost of 
modifying the engine depends on the 
valve train design (such as SOHC, 
DOHC, etc.), the number of cylinders 
and in some cases head design, the 
vehicle sales are broken down beyond 
the platform level to reflect relevant 
engine differences. The vehicle 
groupings are shown in Table III.D.1–1.

As mentioned above, the second 
factor which needs to be considered in 
developing a reference fleet against 
which to evaluate the impacts of this 
proposed rule is the impact of the 2011 
MY CAFE standards, which were 
published earlier this year. Since the 
vehicles which comprise the above 
reference fleet are those sold in the 2008 
MY, when coupled with our sales 
projections, they do not necessarily 
meet the 2011 MY CAFE standards. 
The levels of the 2011 MY CAFE 
standards are straightforward to apply to 
future sales fleets, as is the potential 
fine-paying flexibility afforded by the 
CAFE program (i.e., $55 per mpg of 
shortfall). However, projecting some of 
the compliance flexibilities afforded by 
EISA and the CAFE program are less 
clear. Two of these compliance 
flexibilities are relevant to EPA’s 
analysis: (1) The credit for FFVs, and (2) 
the limit on the transferring of credits 
between car and truck fleets. The FFV 
credit is limited to 1.2 mpg in 2011 and 
EISA gradually reduces this credit, to 
1.0 mpg in 2015 and eventually to zero 
in 2020. In contrast, the limit on car 
truck transfer is limited to 1.0 mpg in 
2011, and EISA increases this to 1.5 
mpg beginning in 2015 and then to 2.0 
mpg beginning in 2020. The question 
here is whether to hold the 2011 MY 
CAFE provisions constant in the future 
or incorporate the changes in the FFV 
credit and car-truck credit trading limits 
contained in EISA. 
EPA decided to hold the 2011 MY 
limits on FFV credit and car-truck credit 
trading constant in projecting the fuel 
economy and CO2 emission levels of 
vehicles in our reference case. This 
approach treats the changes in the FFV 
credit and car-truck credit trading 
provisions consistently with the other 
EISA-mandated changes in the CAFE 
standards themselves. All EISA 
provisions relevant to 2011 MY vehicles 
are reflected in our reference case fleet, 
while all post-2011 MY provisions are 
not. Practically, relative to the 
alternative, this increases both the cost 
and benefit of the proposed standards. 
In our analysis of this proposed rule, 
any quantified benefits from the 
presence of FFVs in the fleet are not 
considered. Thus, the only impact of the 
FFV credit is to reduce onroad fuel 
economy. By assuming that the FFV 
credit stays at 1.2 mpg in the future 
absent this rule, the assumed level of 
onroad fuel economy that would occur 
absent this proposal is reduced. As this 
proposal eliminates the FFV credit 
starting in 2016, the net result is to 
increase the projected level of fuel 
savings from our proposed standards. 
Similarly, the higher level of FFV credit 
reduces projected compliance cost for 
manufacturers to meet the 2011 MY 
standards in our reference case. This 
increases the projected cost of meeting 
the proposed 2012 and later standards. 
As just implied, EPA needs to project 
the technology (and resultant costs) 
required for the 2008 MY vehicles to 
comply with the 2011 MY CAFE 
standards in those cases where they do 
not automatically do so. The technology 
and costs are projected using the same 
methodology that projects compliance 
with the proposed 2012 and later CO2 
standards. The description of this 
process is described in the following 
four sections. 
A more detailed description of the 
methodology used to develop these 
sales projections can be found in the 
Draft Joint TSD. Detailed sales 
projections by model year and 
manufacturer can also be found in the 
TSD. EPA requests comments on both

characteristics of the reference fleet. 
2. What Are the Effectiveness and Costs 
of CO2-Reducing Technologies? 
EPA and NHTSA worked together to 
jointly develop information on the 
effectiveness and cost of the CO2- 
reducing technologies, and fuel 
economy-improving technologies, other 
than A/C related control technologies. 
This joint work is reflected in Chapter 
3 of the Draft Joint TSD and in Section 
II of this preamble. A summary of the 
effectiveness and cost of A/C related 
technology is contained here. For more 
detailed information on the 
effectiveness and cost of A/C related 
technology, please refer to Section III.C 
of this preamble and Chapter 2 of EPA’s 
DRIA. 
A/C improvements are an integral part 
of EPA’s technology analysis and have 
been included in this section along with 
the other technology options. While 
discussed in Section III.C as a credit 
opportunity, air conditioning-related 
improvements are included in Table 
III.D.2–1.because A/C improvements are 
a very cost-effective technology at 
reducing CO2 (or CO2-equivalent) 
emissions. EPA expects most 
manufacturers will choose to use AC 
improvement credit opportunities as a 
strategy for meeting compliance with 
the CO2 standards. Note that the costs 
shown in Table III.D.2–1 do not include 
maintenance savings that would be 
expected from the new AC systems. 
Further, EPA does not include AC- 
related maintenance savings in our cost 
and benefit analysis presented in 
Section III.H. EPA discusses the likely 
maintenance savings in Chapter 2 of the 
DRIA and requests comment on that 
discussion because we may include 
maintenance savings in the final rule 
and would like to have the best 
information available in order to do so. 
The EPA approximates that the level of 
the credits earned will increase from 
2012 to 2016 as more vehicles in the 
fleet are redesigned. The penetrations 
and average levels of credit are 
summarized in Table III.D.2–2, though 
the derivation of these numbers (and the 
breakdown of car vs. truck credits) is 
described in the DRIA. As demonstrated 
in the IMAC study (and described in 
Section III.C as well as the DRIA), these 
levels are feasible and achievable with 
technologies that are available and cost- 
effective today. 
These improvements are categorized 
as either leakage reduction, including 
use of alternative refrigerants, or system 
efficiency improvements. Unlike the 
majority of the technologies described 
in this section, A/C improvements will 
not be demonstrated in the test cycles 
used to quantify CO2 reductions in this 
proposal. As described earlier, for this 
analysis A/C-related CO2 reductions are 
handled outside of OMEGA model and 
therefore their CO2 reduction potential 
is expressed in grams per mile rather 
than a percentage used by the OMEGA 
model. See Section III.C for the method 
by which potential reductions are 
calculated or measured. Further 
discussion of the technological basis for 
these improvements is included in 
Chapter 2 of the DRIA.

3. How Can Technologies Be Combined 
into ‘‘Packages’’ and What Is the Cost 
and Effectiveness of Packages? 
Individual technologies can be used 
by manufacturers to achieve 
incremental CO2 reductions. However, 
as mentioned in Section III.D.1, EPA 
believes that manufacturers are more 
likely to bundle technologies into 
‘‘packages’’ to capture synergistic 
aspects and reflect progressively larger 
CO2 reductions with additions or 
changes to any given package. In 
addition, manufacturers would typically 
apply new technologies in packages 
during model redesigns—which occur 
once roughly every five years—rather 
than adding new technologies one at a 
time on an annual or biennial basis. 
This way, manufacturers can more 
efficiently make use of their redesign 
resources and more effectively plan for 
changes necessary to meet future 
standards. 
Therefore, the approach taken here is 
to group technologies into packages of 
increasing cost and effectiveness. EPA 
determined that 19 different vehicle 
types provided adequate representation 
to accurately model the entire fleet. This 
was the result of analyzing the existing 
light duty fleet with respect to vehicle 
size and powertrain configurations. All 
vehicles, including cars and trucks, 
were first distributed based on their 
relative size, starting from compact cars 
and working upward to large trucks. 
Next, each vehicle was evaluated for 
powertrain, specifically the engine size, 
I4, V6, and V8, and finally by the 
number of valves per cylinder. Note that 
each of these 19 vehicle types was 
mapped into one of the five classes of 
vehicles mentioned in Section III.D.2. 
While the five classes provide adequate 
representation for the cost basis 
associated with most technology 
application, they do not adequately 
account for all existing vehicle 
attributes such as base vehicle 
powertrain configuration and mass 
reduction. As an example, costs and 
effectiveness estimates for engine 
friction reduction for the small car class 
were used to represent cost and 
effectiveness for three vehicle types: 
Subcompact cars, compact cars, and 
small multi-purpose vehicles (MPV) 
equipped with a 4-cylinder engine, 
however the mass reduction associated 
for each of these vehicle types was 
based on the vehicle type sales- 
weighted average. In another example, a 
vehicle type for V8 single overhead cam 
3-valve engines was created to properly 
account for the incremental cost in 
moving to a dual overhead cam 4-valve

162 When making reference to low friction 
lubricants, the technology being referred to is the 
engine changes and possible durability testing that would be done to accommodate the low friction 
lubricants, not the lubricants themselves. 
configuration. Note also that these 19 
vehicle types span the range of vehicle 
footprints—smaller footprints for 
smaller vehicles and larger footprints for 
larger vehicles—which serve as the 
basis for the standards proposed in this 
rule. A complete list of vehicles and 
their associated vehicle types is shown 
above in Table III.D.1–1. 
Within each of the 19 vehicle types 
multiple technology packages were 
created in increasing technology content 
and, hence, increasing effectiveness. 
Important to note is that the effort in 
creating the packages attempted to 
maintain a constant utility for each 
package as compared to the baseline 
package. As such, each package is meant 
to provide equivalent driver-perceived 
performance to the baseline package. 
The initial packages represent what a 
manufacturer will most likely 
implement on all vehicles, including 
low rolling resistance tires, low friction 
lubricants, engine friction reduction, 
aggressive shift logic, early torque 
converter lock-up, improved electrical 
accessories, and low drag brakes.162 
Subsequent packages include advanced 
gasoline engine and transmission 
technologies such as turbo/downsizing, 
GDI, and dual-clutch transmission. The 
most technologically advanced packages 
within a segment included HEV, PHEV 
and EV designs. The end result being a 
list of several packages for each of 19 
different vehicle types from which a 
manufacturer could choose in order to 
modify its fleet such that compliance 
could be achieved. 
Before using these technology 
packages as inputs to the OMEGA 
model, the cost and effectiveness for the 
package was calculated. The first step— 
mentioned briefly above—was to apply 
the scaling class for each technology 
package and vehicle type combination. 
The scaling class establishes the cost 
and effectiveness for each technology 
with respect to the vehicle size or type. 
The Large Car class was provided as an 
example in Section III.D.2. Additional 
classes include Small Car, Minivan, 
Small Truck, and Large Truck and each 
of the 19 vehicle types was mapped into 
one of those five classes. In the next 
step, the cost for a particular technology 
package, was determined as the sum of 
the costs of the applied technologies. 
The final step, determination of 
effectiveness, requires greater care due 
to the synergistic effects mentioned in 
Section III.D.2. This step is described 
immediately below. 
Usually, the benefits of the engine and 
transmission technologies can be 
combined multiplicatively. For 
example, if an engine technology 
reduces CO2 emissions by five percent 
and a transmission technology reduces 
CO2 emissions by four percent, the 
benefit of applying both technologies is 
8.8 percent (100%¥(100%¥4%) * 
(100%¥5%)). In some cases, however, 
the benefit of the transmission-related 
technologies overlaps with many of the 
engine technologies. This occurs 
because the primary goal of most of the 
transmission technologies is to shift 
operation of the engine to more efficient 
locations on the engine map. Some of 
the engine technologies have the same 
goal, such as cylinder deactivation. In 
order to account for this overlap and 
avoid over-estimating emissions 
reduction effectiveness, EPA has 
developed a set of adjustment factors 
associated with specific pairs of engine 
and transmission technologies. 
The various transmission technologies 
are generally mutually exclusive. As 
such, the effectiveness of each 
transmission technology generally 
supersedes each other. For example, the 
9.5–14.5 percent reduction in CO2 
emissions associated with the 
automated manual transmission 
includes the 4.5–6.5 percent benefit of 
a 6-speed automatic transmission. 
Exceptions are aggressive shift logic and 
early torque converter lock-up. The 
former can be applied to any vehicle 
and the latter can be applied to any 
vehicle with an automatic transmission. 
EPA has chosen to use an engineering 
approach known as the lumped- 
parameter technique to determine these 
adjustment factors. The results from this 
approach were then applied directly to 
the vehicle packages. The lumped- 
parameter technique is well 
documented in the literature, and the 
specific approach developed by EPA is 
detailed in Chapter 3 of the Draft Joint 
TSD. 
Table III.D.3–1 presents several 
examples of the reduction in the 
effectiveness of technology pairs. A 
complete list and detailed discussion of 
these synergies is presented in Chapter 
3 of the Draft Joint TSD.

technology vehicle packages used in the 
OMEGA model for the large car class. 
Similar packages were generated for 
each of the 19 vehicle types and the 
costs and effectiveness estimates for 
each of those packages are discussed in 
detail in Chapter 3 of the Draft Joint 
TSD.

4. Manufacturers’ Application of 
Technology 
Vehicle manufacturers often 
introduce major product changes 
together, as a package. In this manner 
the manufacturers can optimize their 
available resources, including 
engineering, development, 
manufacturing and marketing activities 
to create a product with multiple new 
features. In addition, manufacturers 
recognize that a vehicle will need to 
remain competitive over its intended 
life, meet future regulatory 
requirements, and contribute to a 
manufacturer’s CAFE requirements. 
Furthermore, automotive manufacturers 
are largely focused on creating vehicle 
platforms to limit the development of 
entirely new vehicles and to realize 
economies of scale with regard to 
variable cost. In very limited cases, 
manufacturers may implement an 
individual technology outside of a 
vehicle’s redesign cycle. In following 
with these industry practices, EPA has 
created a set of vehicle technology 
packages that represent the entire light 
duty fleet. 
EPA has historically allowed 
manufacturers of new vehicles or 
nonroad equipment to phase in 
available emission control technology 
over a number of years. Examples of this 
are EPA’s Tier 2 program for cars and 
light trucks and its 2007 and later PM 
and NOX emission standards for heavy- 
duty vehicles. In both of these rules, the 
major modifications expected from the 
rules were the addition of exhaust 
aftertreatment control technologies. 
Some changes to the engine were 
expected as well, but these were not 
expected to affect engine size, packaging 
or performance. The CO2 reduction 
technologies described above 
potentially involve much more 
significant changes to car and light truck 
designs. Many of the engine 
technologies involve changes to the 
engine block and heads. The 
transmission technologies could change 
the size and shape of the transmission 
and thus, packaging. Improvements to 
aerodynamic drag could involve body 
design and therefore, the dies used to 
produce body panels. Changes of this 
sort potentially involve new capital 
investment and the obsolescence of 
existing investment. 
At the same time, vehicle designs are 
not static, but change in major ways 
periodically. The manufacturers’ 
product plans indicate that vehicles are 
usually redesigned every 5 years on 
average. Vehicles also tend to receive a 
more modest ‘‘refresh’’ between major 
redesigns, as discussed above. Because 
manufacturers are already changing 
their tooling, equipment and designs at 
these times, further changes to vehicle 
design at these times involve a 
minimum of stranded capital 
equipment. Thus, the timing of any 
major technological changes is projected 
to coincide with changes that 
manufacturers would already tend to be 
making to their vehicles. This approach 
effectively avoids the need to quantify 
any costs associated with discarding 
equipment, tooling, emission and safety 
certification, etc. when CO2-reducing 
equipment is incorporated into a 
vehicle. 
This proposed rule affects five years 
of vehicle production, model years 
2012–2016. Given the now-typical five- 
year redesign cycle, nearly all of a 
manufacturer’s vehicles will be 
redesigned over this period. However, 
this assumes that a manufacturer has 
sufficient lead time to redesign the first 
model year affected by this proposed 
rule with the requirements of this 
proposed rule in mind. In fact, the lead 
time available for model year 2012 is 
relatively short. The time between a 
likely final rule and the start of 2013 
model year production is likely to be 
just over two years. At the same time, 
the manufacturer product plans indicate 
that they are planning on introducing 
many of the technologies projected to be 
required by this proposed rule in both 
2012 and 2013. In order to account for 
the relatively short lead time available 
prior to the 2012 and 2013 model years, 
albeit mitigated by their existing plans, 
EPA projects that only 85 percent of 
each manufacturer’s sales will be able to 
be redesigned with major CO2 emission- 
reducing technologies by the 2016 
model year. Less intrusive technologies 
can be introduced into essentially all a 
manufacturer’s sales. This resulted in 
three levels of technology penetration 
caps, by manufacturer. Common 
technologies (e.g., low friction lubes, 
aerodynamic improvements) had a 
penetration cap of 100%. More 
advanced powertrain technologies (e.g., 
stoichiometric GDI, turbocharging) had 
a penetration cap of 85%. The most 
advanced technologies considered in 
this analysis (e.g., diesel engines, as 
well as IMA, powersplit and 2-mode 
hybrids) had a 15% penetration cap. 
5. How Is EPA Projecting That a 
Manufacturer Would Decide Between 
Options To Improve CO2 Performance 
To Meet a Fleet Average Standard? 
There are many ways for a 
manufacturer to reduce CO2-emissions 
from its vehicles. A manufacturer can 
choose from a myriad of CO2 reducing 
technologies and can apply one or more 
of these technologies to some or all of 
its vehicles. Thus, for a variety of levels 
of CO2 emission control, there are an 
almost infinite number of technology 
combinations which produce the 
desired CO2 reduction. EPA has created 
a new vehicle model, the Optimization 
Model for Emissions of Greenhouse 
gases from Automobiles (OMEGA) in 
order to make a reasonable estimate of 
how manufacturers will add 
technologies to vehicles in order to meet 
a fleet-wide CO2 emissions level. EPA 
has described OMEGA’s specific 
methodologies and algorithms in a 
memo to the docket for this rulemaking 
(Docket EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472). 
The OMEGA model utilizes four basic 
sets of input data. The first is a 
description of the vehicle fleet. The key 
pieces of data required for each vehicle 
are its manufacturer, CO2 emission 
level, fuel type, projected sales and 
footprint. The model also requires that

each vehicle be assigned to one of the 
19 vehicle types, which tells the model 
which set of technologies can be applied 
to that vehicle. (For a description of 
how the 19 vehicle types were created, 
reference Section III.D.3.) In addition, 
the degree to which each vehicle 
already reflects the effectiveness and 
cost of each available technology must 
also be input. This avoids the situation, 
for example, where the model might try 
to add a basic engine improvement to a 
current hybrid vehicle. Except for this 
type of information, the development of 
the required data regarding the reference 
fleet was described in Section III.D.1 
above and in Chapter 1 of the Draft Joint 
TSD. 
The second type of input data used by 
the model is a description of the 
technologies available to manufacturers, 
primarily their cost and effectiveness. 
Note that the five vehicle classes are not 
explicitly used by the model, rather the 
costs and effectiveness associated with 
each vehicle package is based on the 
associated class. This information was 
described in Sections III.D.2 and III.D.3 
above as well as Chapter 3 of the Draft 
Joint TSD. In all cases, the order of the 
technologies or technology packages for 
a particular vehicle type is determined 
by the model user prior to running the 
model. Several criteria can be used to 
develop a reasonable ordering of 
technologies or packages. These are 
described in the Draft Joint TSD. 
The third type of input data describes 
vehicle operational data, such as annual 
scrap rates and mileage accumulation 
rates, and economic data, such as fuel 
prices and discount rates. These 
estimates are described in Section II.F 
above, Section III.H below and Chapter 
4 of the Draft Joint TSD. 
The fourth type of data describes the 
CO2 emission standards being modeled. 
These include the CO2 emission 
equivalents of the 2011 MY CAFE 
standards and the proposed CO2 
standards for 2016. As described in 
more detail below, the application of 
A/C technology is evaluated in a 
separate analysis from those 
technologies which impact CO2 
emissions over the 2-cycle test 
procedure. Thus, for the percent of 
vehicles that are projected to achieve 
A/C related reductions, the CO2 credit 
associated with the projected use of 
improved A/C systems is used to adjust 
the proposed CO2 standard which 
would be applicable to each 
manufacturer to develop a target for CO2 
emissions over the 2-cycle test which is 
assessed in our OMEGA modeling. 
As mentioned above for the market 
data input file utilized by OMEGA, 
which characterizes the vehicle fleet, 
our modeling must and does account for 
the fact that many 2008 MY vehicles are 
already equipped with one or more of 
the technologies discussed in Section 
III.D.2 above. Because of the choice to 
apply technologies in packages, and 
2008 vehicles are equipped with 
individual technologies in a wide 
variety of combinations, accounting for 
the presence of specific technologies in 
terms of their proportion of package cost 
and CO2 effectiveness requires careful, 
detailed analysis. The first step in this 
analysis is to develop a list of individual 
technologies which are either contained 
in each technology package, or would 
supplant the addition of the relevant 
portion of each technology package. An 
example would be a 2008 MY vehicle 
equipped with variable valve timing and 
a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 
cost and effectiveness of variable valve 
timing would be considered to be 
already present for any technology 
packages which included the addition 
of variable valve timing or technologies 
which went beyond this technology in 
terms of engine related CO2 control 
efficiency. An example of a technology 
which supplants several technologies 
would be a 2008 MY vehicle which was 
equipped with a diesel engine. The 
effectiveness of this technology would 
be considered to be present for 
technology packages which included 
improvements to a gasoline engine, 
since the resultant gasoline engines 
have a lower CO2 control efficiency than 
the diesel engine. However, if these 
packages which included improvements 
also included improvements unrelated 
to the engine, like transmission 
improvements, only the engine related 
portion of the package already present 
on the vehicle would be considered. 
The transmission related portion of the 
package’s cost and effectiveness would 
be allowed to be applied in order to 
comply with future CO2 emission 
standards. 
The second step in this process is to 
determine the total cost and CO2 
effectiveness of the technologies already 
present and relevant to each available 
package. Determining the total cost 
usually simply involves adding up the 
costs of the individual technologies 
present. In order to determine the total 
effectiveness of the technologies already 
present on each vehicle, the lumped 
parameter model described above is 
used. Because the specific technologies 
present on each 2008 vehicle are 
known, the applicable synergies and 
dis-synergies can be fully accounted for. 
The third step in this process is to 
divide the total cost and CO2 
effectiveness values determined in step 
2 by the total cost and CO2 effectiveness 
of the relevant technology packages. 
These fractions are capped at a value of 
1.0 or less, since a value of 1.0 causes 
the OMEGA model to not change either 
the cost or CO2 emissions of a vehicle 
when that technology package is added. 
As described in Section III.D.3 above, 
technology packages are applied to 
groups of vehicles which generally 
represent a single vehicle platform and 
which are equipped with a single engine 
size (e.g., compact cars with four 
cylinder engine produced by Ford). 
These groupings are described in Table 
III.D.1–1. Thus, the fourth step is to 
combine the fractions of the cost and 
effectiveness of each technology 
package already present on the 
individual 2008 vehicles models for 
each vehicle grouping. For cost, 
percentages of each package already 
present are combined using a simple 
sales-weighting procedure, since the 
cost of each package is the same for each 
vehicle in a grouping. For effectiveness, 
the individual percentages are 
combined by weighting them by both 
sales and base CO2 emission level. This 
appropriately weights vehicle models 
with either higher sales or CO2 
emissions within a grouping. Once 
again, this process prevents the model 
from adding technology which is 
already present on vehicles, and thus 
ensures that the model does not double 
count technology effectiveness and cost 
associated with complying with the 
2011 MY CAFE standards and the 
proposed CO2 standards. 
Conceptually, the OMEGA model 
begins by determining the specific CO2 
emission standard applicable for each 
manufacturer and its vehicle class (i.e., 
car or truck). Since the proposed rule 
allows for averaging across a 
manufacturer’s cars and trucks, the 
model determines the CO2 emission 
standard applicable to each 
manufacturer’s car and truck sales from 
the two sets of coefficients describing 
the piecewise linear standard functions 
for cars and trucks in the inputs, and 
creates a combined car-truck standard. 
This combined standard considers the 
difference in lifetime VMT of cars and 
trucks, as indicated in the proposed 
regulations which would govern credit 
trading between these two vehicle 
classes. For both the 2011 CAFE and 
2016 CO2 standards, these standards are 
a function of each manufacturer’s sales 
of cars and trucks and their footprint 
values. When evaluating the 2011 MY 
CAFE standards, the car-truck trading 
was limited to 1.2 mpg. When 
evaluating the proposed CO2 standards, 
the OMEGA model was run only for MY 
2016. OMEGA is designed to evaluate 
technology addition over a complete

redesign cycle and 2016 represents the 
final year of a redesign cycle starting 
with the first year of the proposed CO2 
standards, 2012. Estimates of the 
technology and cost for the interim 
model years are developed from the 
model projections made for 2016. This 
process is discussed in Chapter 6 of 
EPA’s DRIA to this proposed rule. When 
evaluating the 2016 standards using the 
OMEGA model, the proposed CO2 
standard which manufacturers would 
otherwise have to meet to account for 
the anticipated level of A/C credits 
generated was adjusted. On an industry 
wide basis, the projection shows that 
manufacturers would generate 11 g/mi 
of A/C credit in 2016. Thus, the 2016 
CO2 target for the fleet evaluated using 
OMEGA was 261 g/mi instead of 250 
g/mi. 
The cost of the improved A/C systems 
required to generate the 11 g/mi credit 
was estimated separately. This is 
consistent with our proposed A/C credit 
procedures, which would grant 
manufacturers A/C credits based on 
their total use of improved A/C systems, 
and not on the increased use of such 
systems relative to some base model 
year fleet. Some manufacturers may 
already be using improved A/C 
technology. However, this represents a 
small fraction of current vehicle sales. 
To the degree that such systems are 
already being used, EPA is over- 
estimating both the cost and benefit of 
the addition of improved A/C 
technology relative to the true reference 
fleet to a small degree. 
The model then works with one 
manufacturer at a time to add 
technologies until that manufacturer 
meets its applicable standard. The 
OMEGA model can utilize several 
approaches to determining the order in 
which vehicles receive technologies. For 
this analysis, EPA used a 
‘‘manufacturer-based net cost- 
effectiveness factor’’ to rank the 
technology packages in the order in 
which a manufacturer would likely 
apply them. Conceptually, this 
approach estimates the cost of adding 
the technology from the manufacturer’s 
perspective and divides it by the mass 
of CO2 the technology will reduce. One 
component of the cost of adding a 
technology is its production cost, as 
discussed above. However, it is 
expected that new vehicle purchasers 
value improved fuel economy since it 
reduces the cost of operating the 
vehicle. Typical vehicle purchasers are 
assumed to value the fuel savings 
accrued over the period of time which 
they will own the vehicle, which is 
estimated to be roughly five years. It is 
also assumed that consumers discount 
these savings at the same rate as that 
used in the rest of the analysis (3 or 7 
percent). Any residual value of the 
additional technology which might 
remain when the vehicle is sold is not 
considered. The CO2 emission reduction 
is the change in CO2 emissions 
multiplied by the percentage of vehicles 
surviving after each year of use 
multiplied by the annual miles travelled 
by age, again discounted to the year of 
vehicle purchase. 
Given this definition, the higher 
priority technologies are those with the 
lowest manufacturer-based net cost- 
effectiveness value (relatively low 
technology cost or high fuel savings 
leads to lower values). Because the 
order of technology application is set for 
each vehicle, the model uses the 
manufacturer-based net cost- 
effectiveness primarily to decide which 
vehicle receives the next technology 
addition. Initially, technology package 
#1 is the only one available to any 
particular vehicle. However, as soon as 
a vehicle receives technology package 
#1, the model considers the 
manufacturer-based net cost- 
effectiveness of technology package #2 
for that vehicle and so on. In general 
terms, the equation describing the 
calculation of manufacturer-based cost 
effectiveness is as follows:

of age i and the percentage of vehicles of

EPA describes the technology ranking 
methodology and manufacturer-based 
cost effectiveness metric in greater 
detail in a technical memo to the Docket 
for this proposed rule (Docket EPA–HQ– 
OAR–2009–0472). 
When calculating the fuel savings, the 
full retail price of fuel, including taxes 
is used. While taxes are not generally 
included when calculating the cost or 
benefits of a regulation, the net cost 
component of the manufacturer-based 
net cost-effectiveness equation is not a 
measure of the social cost of this 
proposal, but a measure of the private 
cost, (i.e., a measure of the vehicle 
purchaser’s willingness to pay more for 
a vehicle with higher fuel efficiency). 
Since vehicle operators pay the full 
price of fuel, including taxes, they value 
fuel costs or savings at this level, and 
the manufacturers will consider this 
when choosing among the technology 
options. 
This definition of manufacturer-based 
net cost-effectiveness ignores any 
change in the residual value of the 
vehicle due to the additional technology 
when the vehicle is five years old. As 
discussed in Chapter 1of the DRIA, 
based on historic used car pricing, 
applicable sales taxes, and insurance, 
vehicles are worth roughly 23% of their 
original cost after five years, discounted 
to year of vehicle purchase at 7% per 
annum. It is reasonable to estimate that 
the added technology to improve CO2 
level and fuel economy would retain 
this same percentage of value when the 
vehicle is five years old. However, it is 
less clear whether first purchasers, and 
thus, manufacturers would consider this 
residual value when ranking 
technologies and making vehicle 
purchases, respectively. For this 
proposal, this factor was not included in 
our determination of manufacturer- 
based net cost-effectiveness in the 
analyses performed in support of this 
proposed rule. Comments are requested 
on the benefit of including an increase

in the vehicle’s residual value after five 
years in the calculation of effective cost. 
The values of manufacturer-based net 
cost-effectiveness for specific 
technologies will vary from vehicle to 
vehicle, often substantially. This occurs 
for three reasons. First, both the cost 
and fuel-saving component cost, 
ownership fuel-savings, and lifetime 
CO2 effectiveness of a specific 
technology all vary by the type of 
vehicle or engine to which it is being 
applied (e.g., small car versus large 
truck, or 4-cylinder versus 8-cylinder 
engine). Second, the effectiveness of a 
specific technology often depends on 
the presence of other technologies 
already being used on the vehicle (i.e., 
the dis-synergies. Third, the absolute 
fuel savings and CO2 reduction of a 
percentage an incremental reduction in 
fuel consumption depends on the CO2 
level of the vehicle prior to adding the 
technology. Chapter 1 of the DRIA of 
this proposed rule contains further 
detail on the values of manufacturer- 
based net cost-effectiveness for the 
various technology packages. 
EPA requests comment on the use of 
manufacturer-based net cost- 
effectiveness to rank CO2 emission 
reduction technologies in the context of 
evaluating alternative fleet average 
standards for this rule. EPA believes this 
manufacturer-based net cost- 
effectiveness metric is appropriate for 
ranking technology in this proposed 
program because it considers 
effectiveness values that may vary 
widely among technology packages 
when determining the order of 
technology addition. Comments are 
requested on this option and on any 
others thought to be appropriate. 
6. Why Are the Proposed CO2 Standards 
Feasible? 
The finding that the proposed 
standards would be technically feasible 
is based primarily on two factors. One 
is the level of technology needed to 
meet the proposed standards. The other 
is the cost of this technology. The focus 
is on the proposed standards for 2016, 
as this is the most stringent standard 
and requires the most extensive use of 
technology. 
With respect to the level of 
technology required to meet the 
standards, EPA established technology 
penetration caps. As described in 
Section III.D.4, EPA used two 
constraints to limit the model’s 
application of technology by 
manufacturer. The first was the 
application of common fuel economy 
enablers such as low rolling resistance 
tires and transmission logic changes. 
These were allowed to be used on all 
vehicles and hence had no penetration 
cap. The second constraint was applied 
to most other technologies and limited 
their application to 85% with the 
exception of the most advanced 
technologies (e.g., powersplit and 2- 
mode hybrids) whose application was 
limited to 15%. 
EPA used the OMEGA model to 
project the technology (and resultant 
cost) required for manufacturers to meet 
the current 2011 MY CAFE standards 
and the proposed 2016 MY CO2 
emission standards. Both sets of 
standards were evaluated using the 
OMEGA model. The 2011 MY CAFE 
standards were applied to cars and 
trucks separately with the transfer of 
credits from one category to the other 
allowed up to an increase in fuel 
economy of 1.0 mpg. Chrysler, Ford and 
General Motors are assumed to utilize 
FFV credits up to the maximum of 1.2 
mpg for both their car and truck sales. 
Nissan is assumed to utilize FFV credits 
up to the maximum of 1.2 mpg for only 
their truck sales. The use of any banked 
credits from previous model years was 
not considered. The modification of the 
reference fleet to comply with the 2011 
CAFE standards through the application 
of technology by the OMEGA model is 
the final step in creating the final 
reference fleet. This final reference fleet 
forms the basis for comparison for the 
model year 2016 standards. 
Table III.D.6–1 shows the usage level 
of selected technologies in the 2008 
vehicles coupled with 2016 sales prior 
to projecting their compliance with the 
2011 MY CAFE standards. These 
technologies include converting port 
fuel-injected gasoline engines to direct 
injection (GDI), adding the ability to 
deactivate certain engine cylinders 
during low load operation (Deac), 
adding a turbocharger and downsizing 
the engine (Turbo), increasing the 
number of transmission speeds to 6 or, 
converting automatic transmissions to 
dual-clutch automated manual 
transmissions (Dual-Clutch Trans), 
adding 42 volt start-stop capability 
(Start-Stop), and converting a vehicle to 
a intermediate or strong hybrid design. 
This last category includes three current 
hybrid designs: integrated motor assist 
(IMA), power-split (PS) and 2-mode 
hybrids.

As can be seen, all of these 
technologies except for the direct 
injection gasoline engines with either 
cylinder deactivation or turbocharging 
and downsizing, were already being 
used on some 2008 MY vehicles. High 
speed transmissions were the most 
prevalent, with some manufacturers 
(e.g., BMW, Suzuki) using them on 
essentially all of their vehicles. Both 
Daimler and VW equip many of their 
vehicles with automated manual 
transmissions, while VW makes 
extensive use of direct injection gasoline 
engine technology. Toyota has 
converted a significant percentage of its 
2008 vehicles to strong hybrid design. 
Table III.D.6–2 shows the usage level 
of the same technologies in the 
reference case fleet after projecting their 
compliance with the 2011 MY CAFE 
standards. Except for mass reduction, 
the figures shown represent the 
percentages of each manufacturer’s sales 
which are projected to be equipped with 
the indicated technology. For mass 
reduction, the overall mass reduction 
projected for that manufacturer’s sales is 
shown. The last row in Table III.D.6–2 
shows the increase in projected 
technology penetration due to 
compliance with the 2011 MY CAFE 
standards. The results of DOT’s Volpe 
Modeling were used to project that all 
manufacturers would comply with the 
2011 MY standards in 2016 without the 
need to pay fines, with one exception. 
This exception was Porsche in the case 
of their car fleet. When projecting 
Porsche’s compliance with the 2011 MY 
CAFE standard for cars, the car fleet was 
assumed to achieve a CO2 emission 
level of 293.2 g/mi instead of the 
required 285.2 g/mi level (30.3 mpg 
instead of 31.2 mpg).

As can be seen, the 2011 MY CAFE 
standards, when evaluated on an 
industry wide basis, require only a 
modest increase in the use of these 
technologies. Higher speed automatic 
transmission use actually decreases due 
to conversion of these units to more 
efficient designs such as automated 
manual transmissions and hybrids. 
However, the impact of the 2011 MY 
CAFE standards is much greater on 
selected manufacturers, particularly 
BMW, Daimler, Porsche, Tata (Jaguar/ 
Land Rover) and VW. All of these 
manufacturers are projected to increase 
their use of advanced direct injection 
gasoline engine technology, advanced 
transmission technology, and start-stop 
technology. It should be noted that these 
manufacturers have traditionally paid 
fines under the CAFE program. 
However, with higher fuel prices and 
the lead-time available by 2016, these 
manufacturers would likely find it in 
their best interest to improve their fuel 
economy levels instead of continuing to 
pay fines (again with the exception of 
Porsche cars). While not shown, no 
gasoline engines were projected to be 
converted to diesel technology. 
This 2008 baseline fleet, modified to 
meet 2011 standards, becomes our 
‘‘reference’’ case. This is the fleet by 
which the control program (or 2016 
rule) will be compared. Thus, it is also 
the fleet that would be assumed to exist 
in the absence of this rule. No air 
conditioning improvements are 
assumed for model year 2011 vehicles. 
The average CO2 emission levels of this 
reference fleet vary slightly from 2012– 
2016 due to small changes in the vehicle 
sales by market segments and 
manufacturer. CO2 emissions from cars 
range from 282–284 g/mi, while those 
from trucks range from 382–384 g/mi. 
CO2 emissions from the combined fleet 
range from 316–320. These estimates are 
described in greater detail in Section 
5.3.2.2 of the DRIA. 
Conceptually, both EPA and NHTSA 
perform the same projection in order to 
develop their respective reference fleets. 
However, because the two agencies use 
two different models to modify the 
baseline fleet to meet the 2011 CAFE 
standards, the technology added will be 
slightly different. The differences, 
however, are small since most 
manufacturers do not require a lot of 
additional technology to meet the 2011 
standards. 
EPA then used the OMEGA model 
once again to project the level of 
technology needed to meet the proposed 
2016 CO2 emission standards. Using the 
results of the OMEGA model, every 
manufacturer was projected to be able to 
meet the proposed 2016 standards with 
the technology described above except 
for four: BMW, VW, Porsche and Tata 
due to the OMEGA cap on technology 
penetration by manufacturer. For these 
manufacturers, the results presented 
below are those with the fully allowable

application of technology and not for 
the technology projected to enable 
compliance with the proposed 
standards. Described below are a 
number of potential feasible solutions 
for how these companies can achieve 
compliance. The overall level of 
technology needed to meet the proposed 
2016 standards is shown in Table 
III.D.6–3. As discussed above, all 
manufacturers are projected to improve 
the air conditioning systems on 85% of 
their 2016 sales.

As can be seen, the overall average 
reduction in vehicle weight is projected 
to be 4%. This reduction varies across 
the two vehicle classes and vehicle base 
weight. For cars below 2,950 pounds 
curb weight, the average reduction is 
2.3% (62 pounds), while the average 
was 4.4% (154 pounds) for cars above 
2,950 curb weight. For trucks below 
3,850 pounds curb weight, the average 
reduction is 3.5% (119 pounds), while 
it was 4.5% (215 pounds) for trucks 
above 3,850 curb weight. Splitting 
trucks at a higher weight, for trucks 
below 5,000 pounds curb weight, the 
average reduction is 3.3% (140 pounds), 
while it was 6.7% (352 pounds) for 
trucks above 5,000 curb weight. 
The levels of requisite technologies 
differ significantly across the various 
manufacturers. Therefore, several 
analyses were performed to ascertain 
the cause. Because the baseline case 
fleet consists of 2008 MY vehicle 
designs, these analyses were focused on 
these vehicles, their technology and 
their CO2 emission levels. 
Comparing CO2 emissions across 
manufacturers is not a simple task. In 
addition to widely varying vehicle 
styles, designs, and sizes, manufacturers 
have implemented fuel efficient 
technologies to varying degrees, as 
indicated in Table III.D.6–1. The 
projected levels of requisite technology 
to enable compliance with the proposed 
2016 standards shown in Table III.D.6– 
3 account for two of the major factors 
which can affect CO2 emissions: (1) 
Level of technology already being 
utilized and (2) vehicle size, as 
represented by footprint. 
For example, the fuel economy of a 
manufacturer’s 2008 vehicles may be 
relatively high because of the use of 
advanced technology. This is the case 
with Toyota’s high sales of their Prius 
hybrid. However, the presence of this 
technology in a 2008 vehicle eliminates 
the ability to significantly reduce CO2 
further through the use of this 
technology. In the extreme, if a 
manufacturer were to hybridize a high 
level of its sales in 2016, it doesn’t 
matter whether this technology was 
present in 2008 or whether it would be 
added in order to comply with the 
standards. The final level of hybrid 
technology would be the same. Thus, 
the level at which technology is present 
in 2008 vehicles does not explain the 
difference in requisite technology levels 
shown in Table III.D.6–3. 
Similarly, the proposed CO2 emission 
standards adjust the required CO2 level 
according to a vehicle’s footprint, 
requiring lower absolute emission levels 
from smaller vehicles. Thus, just 
because a manufacturer produces larger 
vehicles than another manufacturer 
does not explain the differences seen in 
Table III.D.6–3. 
In order to remove these two factors 
from our comparison, the EPA lumped 
parameter model described above was 
used to estimate the degree to which 
technology present on each 2008 MY 
vehicle in our reference fleet was 
improving fuel efficiency. The effect of 
this technology was removed and each 
vehicle’s CO2 emissions were estimated 
as if it utilized no additional fuel 
efficiency technology beyond the 
baseline. The differences in vehicle size 
were accounted for by determining the 
difference between the sales-weighted 
average of each manufacturer’s ‘‘no 
technology’’ CO2 levels to their required 
CO2 emission level under the proposed 
2016 standards. The industry-wide 
difference was subtracted from each 
manufacturer’s value to highlight which 
manufacturers had lower and higher 
than average ‘‘no technology’’ 
emissions. The results are shown in 
Figure III.D.6–1.

As can be seen in Table III.D.6–3 the 
manufacturers projected to require the 
greatest levels of technology also show 
the highest offsets relative to the 
industry. The greatest offset shown in 
Figure III.D.6–1 is for Tata’s trucks 
(Land Rover). These vehicles are 
estimated to have 100 g/mi greater CO2 
emissions than the average 2008 MY 
truck after accounting for differences in 
the use of fuel saving technology and 
footprint. The lowest adjustment is for 
Subaru’s trucks, which have 50 g/mi 
CO2 lower emissions than the average 
truck. 
While this comparison confirms the 
differences in the technology 
penetrations shown in Table III.D.6–3, it 
does not yet explain why these 
differences exist. Two well known 
factors affecting vehicle fuel efficiency 
are vehicle weight and performance. 
The footprint-based form of the 
proposed CO2 standard accounts for 
most of the difference in vehicle weight 
seen in the 2008 MY fleet. However, 
even at the same footprint, vehicles can 
have varying weights. Higher 
performing vehicles also tend to have 
higher CO2 emissions over the two-cycle 
test procedure. So manufacturers with 
higher average performance levels will 
tend to have higher average CO2 
emissions for any given footprint. 
The impact of these two factors on 
each manufacturer’s ‘‘no technology’’ 
CO2 emissions was estimated. First, the 
‘‘no technology’’ CO2 emissions levels 
were statistically analyzed to determine 
the average impact of weight and the 
ratio of horsepower to weight on CO2 
emissions. Both factors were found to be 
statistically significant at the 95 percent 
confidence level. Together, they 
explained over 80 percent of the 
variability in vehicles’ CO2 emissions 
for cars and over 70 percent for trucks. 
These relationships were then used to 
adjust each vehicle’s ‘‘no technology’’ 
CO2 emissions to the average weight for 
its footprint value and to the average 
horsepower to weight ratio of either the 
car or truck fleet. The comparison was 
repeated as shown in Figure III.D.6–1. 
The results are shown in Figure 
III.D.6–2.

First, note that the scale in Figure 
III.D.6–2 is much smaller by a factor of 
3 than that in Figure III.D.6–1. In other 
words, accounting for differences in 
vehicle weight (at constant footprint) 
and performance dramatically reduces 
the differences in various 
manufacturers’ CO2 emissions. Most of 
the manufacturers with high offsets in 
Figure III.D.6–1 now show low or 
negative offsets. For example, BMW’s 
and VW’s trucks show very low CO2 
emissions. Tata’s emissions are very 
close to the industry average. Daimler’s 
vehicles are no more than 10 g/mi above 
the average for the industry. This 
analysis indicates that the primary 
reasons for the differences in technology 
penetrations shown for the various 
manufacturers in Table III.D.6–3 are 
weight and performance. EPA has not 
determined why some manufacturers’ 
vehicle weight is relatively high for its 
footprint value, or whether this weight 
provides additional utility for the 
consumer. Performance is more

straightforward. Some consumers desire 
high performance and some 
manufacturers orient their sales towards 
these consumers. However, the cost in 
terms of CO2 emissions is clear. 
Producing relatively heavy or high 
performance vehicles increases CO2 
emissions and will require greater levels 
of technology in order to meet the 
proposed CO2 standards. 
As can be seen from Table III.D.6–3 
above, widespread use of several 
technologies is projected due to the 
proposed standards. The vast majority 
of engines are projected to be converted 
to direct injection, with some of these 
engines including cylinder deactivation 
or turbocharging and downsizing. More 
than 60 percent of all transmissions are 
projected to be either high speed 
automatic transmissions or dual-clutch 
automated manual transmissions. More 
than one third of the fleet is projected 
to be equipped with 42 volt start-stop 
capability. This technology was not 
utilized in 2008 vehicles, but as 
discussed above, promises significant 
fuel efficiency improvement at a 
moderate cost. 
EPA foresees no significant technical 
or engineering issues with the projected 
deployment of these technologies across 
the fleet, with their incorporation being 
folded into the vehicle redesign process. 
All of these technologies are 
commercially available now. The 
automotive industry has already begun 
to convert its port fuel-injected gasoline 
engines to direct injection. Cylinder 
deactivation and turbocharging 
technologies are already commercially 
available. As indicated in Table III.D.6– 
1, high speed transmissions are already 
widely used. However, while more 
common in Europe, automated manual 
transmissions are not currently used 
extensively in the U.S. Widespread use 
of this technology would require 
significant capital investment but does 
not present any significant technical or 
engineering issues. Start-stop systems 
also represent a significant challenge 
because of the complications involved 
in a changeover to a higher voltage 
electrical architecture. However, with 
appropriate capital investments (which 
are captured in the costs), these 
technology penetration rates are 
achievable within the timeframe of this 
rule. While most manufacturers have 
some plans for these systems, our 
projections indicate that their use may 
exceed 35 percent of sales, with some 
manufacturers requiring higher levels. 
Most manufacturers would not have 
to hybridize any vehicles due to the 
proposed standards. The hybrids shown 
for Toyota are projected to be sold even 
in the absence of the proposed 
standards. However the relatively high 
hybrid penetrations (15%) projected for 
BMW, Daimler, Porsche, Tata and 
Volkswagen deserve further discussion. 
These manufacturers are all projected by 
the OMEGA model to utilize the 
maximum application of full hybrids 
allowed by our model in this time 
frame, which is 15 percent. 
As discussed in the EPA DRIA, a 2016 
technology penetration rate of 85% is 
projected for the vast majority of 
available technologies, however, for full 
hybrid systems the projection shows 
that given the available lead-time full 
hybrids can only be applied to 
approximately 15% of a manufacturer’s 
fleet. This number of course can vary by 
manufacturer. 
While the hybridization levels of 
BMW, Daimler, Porsche, Tata and 
Volkswagen are relatively high, the sales 
levels of these five manufacturers are 
relatively low. Thus, industry-wide, 
hybridization reaches only 8 percent, 
compared with 3 percent in the 
reference case. This 8 percent level is 
believed to be well within the capability 
of the hybrid component industry by 
2016. Thus, the primary challenge for 
these five companies would be at the 
manufacturer level, redesigning a 
relatively large percentage of sales to 
include hybrid technology. The 
proposed TLAAS provisions will 
provide significant aid to these 
manufacturers in pre-2016 compliance, 
since all qualified companies are 
expected to be able to take advantage of 
these provisions. By 2016, it is likely 
that these manufacturers would also be 
able to change vehicle characteristics 
which currently cause their vehicles to 
emit much more CO2 than similar sized 
vehicles produced by other 
manufacturers. These factors may 
include changes in model mix, further 
lightweighting, downpowering, electric 
and/or plug-in hybrid vehicles, or 
downsizing (our current baseline fleet 
assumes very little change in footprint 
from 2012–2016), as well as 
technologies that may not be included 
in our packages. Also, companies may 
have technology penetration rates of less 
costly technologies (listed in the above 
tables) greater than 85%, and they may 
also be able to apply hybrid technology 
to more than 15 percent of their fleet (as 
the 15% for hybrid technology is an 
industry average). For example, a switch 
to a low GWP alternative refrigerant in 
a large fraction of a fleet can replace 
many other much more costly 
technologies, but this option is not 
captured in the modeling. In addition, 
these manufacturers can also take 
advantage of flexibilities, such as early 
credits for air conditioning and trading 
with other manufacturers. The EPA 
expects that there will be certain high 
volume manufacturers that will earn a 
significant amount of early GHG credits 
starting in 2009 and 2010 that will 
expire 5 years later, by 2014 and 2015, 
unused. The EPA believes that these 
manufacturers will be willing to sell 
these expiring credits to manufacturers 
with whom there is no direct 
competition. Furthermore, some of these 
manufacturers have also stated either 
publicly or in confidential discussions 
with EPA that they will be able to 
comply with 2016 standards. Because of 
the confidential nature of this 
information sharing, EPA is unable to 
capture these packages specifically in 
our modeling. The following companies 
have all submitted letters in support of 
the national program, including the 
2016 MY levels discussed above: BMW, 
Chrysler, Daimler, Ford, GM, Honda, 
Mazda, Toyota, and Volkswagen. This 
supports the view that the emissions 
reductions needed to achieve the 
standards are technically and 
economically feasible for all these 
companies, and that EPA’s projection of 
non-compliance for four of the 
companies is based on an inability of 
our model to fully account for the full 
flexibilities of the EPA program as well 
as the potentially unique technology 
approaches or new product offerings 
which these manufactures are likely to 
employ. 
In addition, manufacturers do not 
need to apply technology exactly 
according to our projections. Our 
projections simply indicate one path 
which would achieve compliance. 
Those manufacturers whose vehicles are 
heavier and higher performing than 
average in particular have additional 
options to facilitate compliance and 
reduce their technological burden closer 
to the industry average. These options 
include decreasing the mass of the 
vehicles and/or decreasing the power 
output of the engines. Finally, EPA 
allows compliance to be shown through 
the use of emission credits obtained 
from other manufacturers. Especially for 
the lower volume sales of some 
manufacturers that could be one 
component of an effective compliance 
strategy, reducing the technology that 
needs to be employed on their vehicles. 
For the vast majority of light-duty cars 
and trucks, manufacturers have 
available to them a range of technologies 
that are currently commercially 
available and can feasibly be employed 
in their vehicles by MY 2016. Our 
modeling projects widespread use of 
these technologies as a technologically 
feasible approach to complying with the 
proposed standards.

163 Note that the actual cost of the A/C technology 
is estimated at $78 per vehicle as shown in Table 
III.D.2–3. However, we expect only 85 percent of 
the fleet to add that technology. Therefore, the cost 
of the technology when spread across the entire 
fleet is $66 per vehicle ($78×85%=$66). 
In sum, EPA believes that the 
emissions reductions called for by the 
proposed standards are technologically 
feasible, based on projections of 
widespread use of commercially 
available technology, as well as use by 
some manufacturers of other technology 
approaches and compliance flexibilities 
not fully reflected in our modeling. 
EPA also projected the cost associated 
with these projections of technology 
penetration. Table III.D.6–4 shows the 
cost of technology in order for 
manufacturers to comply with the 2011 
MY CAFE standards, as well as those 
associated with the proposed 2016 CO2 
emission standards. The latter costs are 
incremental to those associated with the 
2011 MY standards and also include 
$60 per vehicle, on average, for the cost 
of projected use of improved air- 
conditioning systems.163

As can be seen, the industry average 
cost of complying with the 2011 MY 
CAFE standards is quite low, $78 per 
vehicle. The range of costs across 
manufacturers is quite large, however. 
Honda, Mazda and Toyota are projected 
to face no cost, while Daimler, Porsche 
and Tata face costs of at least $495 per 
vehicle. As described above, these last 
three manufacturers face such high costs 
to meet even the 2011 MY CAFE 
standards due to both their vehicles’ 
weight per unit footprint and 
performance. Also, these cost estimates 
apply to sales in the 2016 MY. These 
three manufacturers, as well as others 
like Volkswagen, may choose to pay 
CAFE fines prior to this or even in 2016. 
As shown in the last row of Table 
III.D.6–4, the average cost of technology 
to meet the proposed 2016 standards for 
cars and trucks combined relative to the 
2011 MY CAFE standards is $1051 per 
vehicle. The projection shows that the 
average cost for cars would be slightly 
lower than that for trucks. Toyota and 
Honda show projected costs 
significantly below the average, while 
BMW, Porsche, Tata and Volkswagen 
show significantly higher costs. On 
average, the $1051 per vehicle cost is 
significant, representing roughly 5% of 
the total cost of a new vehicle. However, 
as discussed below, the fuel savings 
associated with the proposed standards 
exceeds this cost significantly. 
While the CO2 emission compliance 
modeling using the OMEGA model 
focused on the proposed 2016 MY 
standards, EPA believes that the 
proposed standards for 2012–2015 
would also be feasible. As discussed 
above, EPA believes that manufacturers 
develop their vehicle designs with 
several model years in view. Generally, 
the technology estimated above for 2016 
MY vehicles represents the technology 
which would be added to those vehicles 
which are being redesigned in 2012– 
2015. The proposed CO2 standards for 
2012–2016 reduce CO2 emissions at a 
fairly steady rate. Thus, manufacturers 
which redesign their vehicles at a fairly 
steady rate will automatically comply 
with the interim standard as they plan 
for compliance in 2016. 
Manufacturers which redesign much 
fewer than 20% of their sales in the 
early years of the proposed program 
would face a more difficult challenge, as 
simply implementing the ‘‘2016 MY’’ 
technology as vehicles are redesigned 
may not enable compliance in the early 
years. However, even in this case, 
manufacturers would have several 
options to enable compliance. One, they 
could utilize the proposed debit carry- 
forward provisions described above. 
This may be sufficient alone to enable 
compliance through the 2012–2016 MY 
time period, if their redesign schedule 
exceeds 20% per year prior to 2016. If 
not, at some point, the manufacturer 
might need to increase their use of 
technology beyond that projected above 
in order to generate the credits 
necessary to balance the accrued debits. 
For most manufacturers representing the 
vast majority of U.S. sales, this would 
simply mean extending the same 
technology to a greater percentage of 
sales. The added cost of this in the later 
years of the program would be balanced 
by lower costs in the earlier years. Two, 
the manufacturer could buy credits from 
another manufacturer. As indicated 
above, several manufacturers are 
projected to require less stringent 
technology than the average. These 
manufacturers would be in a position to 
provide credits at a reasonable 
technology cost. Thus, EPA believes the 
proposed standards for 2012–2016 
would be feasible. 
7. What Other Fleet-Wide CO2 Levels 
Were Considered? 
Two alternative sets of CO2 standards 
were considered. One set would reduce

CO2 emissions at a rate of 4 percent per 
year. The second set would reduce CO2 
emissions at a rate of 6 percent per year. 
The analysis of these standards followed 
the exact same process as described 
above for the proposed standards. The 
only difference was the level of CO2 
emission standards. The footprint-based 
standard coefficients of the car and 
truck curves for these two alternative 
control scenarios were discussed above. 
The resultant CO2 standards in 2016 for 
each manufacturer under these two 
alternative scenarios and under the 
proposal are shown in Table III.D.7–1.

With respect to the 4 percent per year 
standards, the levels of requisite control 
technology decreased relative to those 
under the proposed standards, as would 
be expected. Industry-wide, the largest 
decrease was a 2 percent decrease in the 
application of start-stop technology. On 
a manufacturer specific basis, the most 
significant decreases were a 6 percent 
decrease in hybrid penetration for BMW 
and a 2 percent drop for Daimler. These 
are relatively small changes and are due 
to the fact that the 4 percent per year 
standards only require 4 g/mi CO2 less 
control than the proposed standards in 
2016. Porsche, Tata and Volkswagen 
continue to be unable to comply with 
the CO2 standards in 2016. 
With respect to the 6 percent per year 
standards, the levels of requisite control 
technology increased relative to those 
under the proposed standards, as again 
would be expected. Industry-wide, the 
largest increase was an 8 percent 
increase in the application of start-stop 
technology. On a manufacturer specific 
basis, the most significant increases 
were a 42 percent increase in hybrid 
penetration for BMW and a 38 percent 
increase for Daimler. These are more 
significant changes and are due to the 
fact that the 6 percent per year 
standards require 20 g/mi CO2 more 
control than the proposed standards in 
2016. Porsche, Tata and Volkswagen 
continue to be unable to comply with 
the CO2 standards in 2016. However, 
BMW joins this list, as well, though just 
by 1 g/mi. Most manufacturers 
experience the increase in start-stop 
technology application, with the 
increase ranging from 5 to 17 percent.

cost of the two alternative sets of

Overall .............................................................................. 940 1,054 978 1,385 1,859 1,544 
As can be seen, the average cost of the 
4 percent per year standards is only $73 
per vehicle less than that for the 
proposed standards. In contrast, the 
average cost of the 6 percent per year 
standards is nearly $500 per vehicle 
more than that for the proposed 
standards. Compliance costs are 
entering the region of non-linearity. The 
$73 cost savings of the 4 percent per 
year standards relative to the proposal 
represents $18 per g/mi CO2 increase. 
The $493 cost increase of the 6 percent 
per year standards relative to the 
proposal represents $25 per g/mi CO2 
increase. 
EPA does not believe the 4% per year 
alternative is an appropriate standard 
for the MY2012–2016 time frame. As 
discussed above, the 250 g/mi proposal 
is technologically feasible in this time 
frame at reasonable costs, and provides 
higher GHG emission reductions at a 
modest cost increase over the 4% per 
year alternative (less than $100 per 
vehicle). In addition, the 4% per year 
alternative does not result in a 
harmonized National Program for the 
country. Based on California’s letter of 
May 18, 2009, the emission standards 
under this alternative would not result 
in the State of California revising its 
regulations such that compliance with

EPA’s GHG standards would be deemed 
to be in compliance with California’s 
GHG standards for these model years. 
Thus, the consequence of promulgating 
a 4% per year standard would be to 
require manufacturers to produce two 
vehicle fleets: a fleet meeting the 4% per 
year Federal standard, and a separate 
fleet meeting the more stringent 
California standard for sale in California 
and the section 177 States. This further 
increases the costs of the 4% per year 
standard and could lead to additional 
difficulties for the already stressed 
automotive industry. 
EPA also does not believe the 6% per 
year alternative is an appropriate 
standard for the MY 2012–2016 time 
frame. As shown in Tables III.D.7–3 and 
III.D.7–4, the 6% per year alternative 
represents a significant increase in both 
the technology required and the overall 
costs compared to the proposed 
standards. In absolute percent increases 
in the technology penetration, compared 
to the proposed standards the 6% per 
year alternative requires for the industry 
as a whole: an 18% increase in GDI fuel 
systems, an 11% increase in turbo- 
downsize systems, a 6% increase in 
dual-clutch automated manual 
transmissions (DCT), and a 9% increase 
in start-stop systems. For a number of 
manufacturers the expected increase in 
technology is greater: for GM, a 15% 
increase in both DCTs and start-stop 
systems, for Nissan a 9% increase in full 
hybrid systems, for Ford an 11% 
increase in full hybrid systems, for 
Chrysler a 34% increase in both DCT 
and start-stop systems and for Hyundai 
a 23% increase in the overall 
penetration of DCT and start-stop 
systems. For the industry as a whole, 
the per-vehicle cost increase for the 6% 
per year alternative is nearly $500. On 
average this is a 50% increase in costs 
compared to the proposed standards. At 
the same time, CO2 emissions would be 
reduced by about 8%, compared to the 
250 g/mi target level. 
These technology and cost increases 
are significant, given the amount of 
lead-time between now and model years 
2012–2016. In order to achieve the 
levels of technology penetration for the 
proposed standards, the industry needs 
to invest significant capital and product 
development resources right away, in 
particular for the 2012 and 2013 model 
year, which is only 2–3 years from now. 
For the 2014–2016 time frame, 
significant product development and 
capital investments will need to occur 
over the next 2–3 year in order to be 
ready for launching these new products 
for those model years. Thus a major part 
of the required capital and resource 
investment will need to occur in the 
next few years, under the proposed 
standards. EPA believes that the 
proposal (a target of 250 gram/mile in 
2016) already requires significant 
investment and product development 
costs for the industry, focused on the 
next few years. 
It is important to note, and as 
discussed later in this preamble, as well 
as in the draft Joint Technical Support 
Document and the draft EPA Regulatory 
Impact Analysis document, the average 
model year 2016 per-vehicle cost 
increase of nearly $500 includes an 
estimate of both the increase in capital 
investments by the auto companies and 
the suppliers as well as the increase in 
product development costs. These costs 
can be significant, especially as they 
must occur over the next 2–3 years. 
Both the domestic and transplant auto 
firms, as well as the domestic and 
world-wide automotive supplier base, is 
experiencing one of the most difficult 
markets in the U.S. and internationally 
that has been seen in the past 30 years. 
One major impact of the global 
downturn in the automotive industry 
and certainly in the U.S. is the 
significant reductions in product 
development engineers and staffs, as 
well as a tightening of the credit markets 
which allow auto firms and suppliers to 
make the near-term capital investments 
necessary to bring new technology into 
production. EPA is concerned that the 
significantly increased pressure on 
capital and other resources from the 6% 
per year alternative may be too stringent 
for this time frame, given both the 
relatively limited amount of lead-time 
between now and model years 2012– 
2016, the need for much of these 
resources over the next few years, as 
well the current financial and related 
circumstances of the automotive 
industry. EPA is not concluding that the 
6% per year alternative standards are 
technologically infeasible, but EPA 
believes such standards for this time 
frame would be overly stringent given 
the significant strain it would place on 
the resources of the industry under 
current conditions. EPA believes this 
degree of stringency is not warranted at 
this time. Therefore EPA does not 
believe the 6% per year alternative 
would be an appropriate balance of 
various relevant factors for model years 
2012–1016. 
These alternative standards represent 
two possibilities out of many. The EPA 
believes that the current proposed 
standards represent an appropriate 
balance of the factors relevant under 
section 202(a). For further discussion of 
this issue, see Chapter 4 of the DRIA. 
E. Certification, Compliance, and 
Enforcement 
1. Compliance Program Overview 
This section of the preamble describes 
EPA’s proposal for a comprehensive 
program to ensure compliance with 
EPA’s proposed emission standards for 
carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide 
(N2O), and methane (CH4), as described 
in Section III.B. An effective compliance 
program is essential to achieving the 
environmental and public health 
benefits promised by these mobile 
source GHG standards. EPA’s proposal 
for a GHG compliance program is 
designed around two overarching 
priorities: (1) To address Clean Air Act 
(CAA) requirements and policy 
objectives; and (2) to streamline the 
compliance process for both 
manufacturers and EPA by building on 
existing practice wherever possible, and 
by structuring the program such that 
manufacturers can use a single data set 
to satisfy both the new GHG and 
Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
(CAFE) testing and reporting 
requirements. The program proposed by 
EPA and NHTSA recognizes, and 
replicates as closely as possible, the 
compliance protocols associated with 
the existing CAA Tier 2 vehicle 
emission standards, and with CAFE 
standards. The certification, testing, 
reporting, and associated compliance 
activities closely track current practices 
and are thus familiar to manufacturers. 
EPA already oversees testing, collects 
and processes test data, and performs 
calculations to determine compliance 
with both CAFE and CAA standards. 
Under this proposed coordinated 
approach, the compliance mechanisms 
for both programs are consistent and 
non-duplicative. 
Vehicle emission standards 
established under the CAA apply 
throughout a vehicle’s full useful life. In 
this case EPA is proposing fleet average 
standards where compliance with the 
fleet average is determined based on the 
testing performed at time of production, 
as with the current CAFE fleet average. 
EPA is also proposing in-use standards 
that apply throughout a vehicle’s useful 
life, with the standard determined by 
adding a 10% adjustment factor to the 
model-level emission results used to 
calculate the fleet average. Therefore, 
EPA’s proposed program must not only 
assess compliance with the fleet average 
standards described in Section III.B, but 
must also assess compliance with the 
in-use standards. As it does now, EPA 
would use a variety of compliance 
mechanisms to conduct these 
assessments, including pre-production 
certification and post-production, in-use

monitoring once vehicles enter 
customer service. Specifically, EPA is 
proposing a compliance program for the 
fleet average that utilizes CAFE program 
protocols with respect to testing, a 
certification procedure that operates in 
conjunction with the existing CAA Tier 
2 certification procedures, and 
assessment of compliance with the in- 
use standards concurrent with existing 
EPA and manufacturer Tier 2 emission 
compliance testing programs. Under the 
proposed compliance program 
manufacturers would also be afforded 
numerous flexibilities to help achieve 
compliance, both stemming from the 
program design itself in the form of a 
manufacturer-specific CO2 fleet average 
standard, as well as in various credit 
banking and trading opportunities, as 
described in Section III.C. EPA’s 
proposed compliance program is 
outlined in further detail below. EPA 
requests comment on all aspects of the 
compliance program design including 
comments about whether differences 
between the proposed compliance 
scheme for GHG and the existing 
compliance scheme for other regulated 
pollutants are appropriate. 
2. Compliance With Fleet-Average CO2 
Standards 
Fleet average emission levels can only 
be determined when a complete fleet 
profile becomes available at the close of 
the model year. Therefore, EPA is 
proposing to determine compliance 
with the fleet average CO2 standards 
when the model year closes out, as is 
currently the protocol under EPA’s Tier 
2 program as well as under the current 
CAFE program. The compliance 
determination would be based on actual 
production figures for each model and 
on model-level emissions data collected 
through testing over the course of the 
model year. Manufacturers would 
submit this information to EPA in an 
end-of-year report which is discussed in 
detail in Section III.E.5.h below. 
Manufacturers currently conduct their 
CAFE testing over an entire model year 
to maximize efficient use of testing and 
engineering resources. Manufacturers 
submit their CAFE test results to EPA 
and EPA conducts confirmatory fuel 
economy testing at its laboratory on a 
subset of these vehicles under EPA’s 
Part 600 regulations. EPA is proposing 
that manufacturers continue to perform 
the model level testing currently 
required for CAFE fuel economy 
performance and measure and report the 
CO2 values for all tests conducted. Thus, 
manufacturers will submit one data set 
in satisfaction of both CAFE and GHG 
requirements such that EPA’s proposed 
program would not impose additional 
timing or testing requirements on 
manufacturers beyond that required by 
the CAFE program. For example, 
manufacturers currently submit fuel 
economy test results at the 
subconfiguration and configuration 
levels to satisfy CAFE requirements. 
Under this proposal manufacturers 
would also submit CO2 values for the 
same vehicles. Section III.E.3 discusses 
how this will be implemented in the 
certification process. 
a. Compliance Determinations 
As described in Section III.B above, 
the fleet average standards would be 
determined on a manufacturer by 
manufacturer basis, separately for cars 
and trucks, using the proposed footprint 
attribute curves. Under this proposal, 
EPA would calculate the fleet average 
emission level using actual production 
figures and, for each model type, CO2 
emission test values generated at the 
time of a manufacturer’s CAFE testing. 
EPA would then compare the actual 
fleet average to the manufacturer’s 
footprint standard to determine 
compliance, taking into consideration 
use of averaging and/or other types of 
credits. 
Final determination of compliance 
with fleet average CO2 standards may 
not occur until several years after the 
close of the model year due to the 
flexibilities of carry-forward and carry- 
back credits and the remediation of 
deficits (see Section III.C). A failure to 
meet the fleet average standard after 
credit opportunities have been 
exhausted could ultimately result in 
penalties and injunctive orders under 
the CAA as described in Section III.E.6 
below. 
EPA periodically provides mobile 
source emissions and fuel economy 
information to the public, for example 
through the annual Compliance 
Report 164 and Fuel Economy Trends 
Report.165 EPA plans to expand these 
reports to include GHG performance 
and compliance trends information, 
such as annual status of credit balances 
or debits, use of various credit 
programs, attained versus projected fleet 
average emission levels, and final 
compliance status for a model year after 
credit reconciliation occurs. We seek 
comment on all aspects of public 
dissemination of GHG compliance 
information 
b. Required Minimum Testing for Fleet 
Average CO2 
As noted, EPA is proposing that the 
same test data required for determining 
a manufacturer’s compliance with the 
CAFE standard also be used to 
determine the manufacturer’s 
compliance with the fleet average CO2 
emissions standard. CAFE requires 
manufacturers to submit test data 
representing at least 90% of the 
manufacturer’s model year production, 
by configuration.166 The CAFE testing 
covers the vast majority of models in a 
manufacturer’s fleet. Manufacturers 
industry-wide currently test more than 
1,000 vehicles each year to meet this 
requirement. EPA believes this 
minimum testing requirement is 
necessary and applicable for calculating 
accurate CO2 fleet average emissions. 
Manufacturers may test additional 
vehicles, at their option. As described 
above, EPA would use the emissions 
results from the model-level testing to 
calculate a manufacturer’s fleet average 
CO2 emissions and to determine 
compliance with the CO2 standard. 
EPA is proposing to continue to allow 
certain testing flexibilities that exist 
under the CAFE program. EPA has 
always permitted manufacturers some 
ability to reduce their test burden in 
tradeoff for lower fuel economy 
numbers. Specifically the practice of 
‘‘data substitution’’ enables 
manufacturers to apply fuel economy 
test values from a ‘‘worst case’’ 
configuration to other configurations in 
lieu of testing them. The substituted 
values may only be applied to 
configurations that would be expected 
to have better fuel economy and for 
which no actual test data exist. 
Substituted data would only be 
accepted for the GHG program if it is 
also used for CAFE purposes. 
EPA’s regulations for CAFE fuel 
economy testing permit the use of 
analytically derived fuel economy data 
in lieu of an actual fuel economy test in 
certain situations.167 Analytically 
derived data is generated 
mathematically using expressions 
determined by EPA and is allowed on 
a limited basis when a manufacturer has 
not tested a specific vehicle 
configuration. This has been done as a 
means to reduce some of the testing 
burden on manufacturers without 
sacrificing accuracy in fuel economy 
measurement. EPA has issued guidance 
that provides details on analytically

169 The specific test group criteria are described 
in 40 CFR 86.1827–01, car lines and model types

170 Initially in-use standards were different from 
the bin level determined at certification as the 
useful life level. The current in-use standards, 
however, are the same as the bin levels. In all cases,

conditions when analytically derived 
fuel economy may be used. EPA would 
also apply the same guidance to the 
GHG program and would allow any 
analytically derived data used for CAFE 
to also satisfy the GHG data reporting 
requirements. EPA would, however, 
need to revise the terms in the current 
equations for analytically derived fuel 
economy to specify them in terms of 
CO2. Analytically derived CO2 data 
would not be permitted for the Emission 
Data Vehicle representing a test group 
for pre-production certification, only for 
the determination of the model level test 
results used to determine actual fleet- 
average CO2 levels. 
EPA is retaining the definitions 
needed to determine CO2 levels of each 
model type (such as ‘‘subconfiguration,’’ 
‘‘configuration,’’ ‘‘base level,’’ etc.) as 
they are currently defined in EPA’s fuel 
economy regulations. 
3. Vehicle Certification 
CAA section 203(a)(1) prohibits 
manufacturers from introducing a new 
motor vehicle into commerce unless the 
vehicle is covered by an EPA-issued 
certificate of conformity. Section 
206(a)(1) of the CAA describes the 
requirements for EPA issuance of a 
certificate of conformity, based on a 
demonstration of compliance with the 
emission standards established by EPA 
under section 202 of the Act. The 
certification demonstration requires 
emission testing, and must be done for 
each model year.168 
Under Tier 2 and other EPA emission 
standard programs, vehicle 
manufacturers certify a group of 
vehicles called a test group. A test group 
typically includes multiple vehicle car 
lines and model types that share critical 
emissions-related features.169 The 
manufacturer generally selects and tests 
one vehicle to represent the entire test 
group for certification purposes. The 
test vehicle is the one expected to be the 
worst case for the emission standard at 
issue. Emission results from the test 
vehicle are used to assign the test group 
to one of several specified bins of 
emissions levels, identified in the Tier 
2 rule, and this bin level becomes the 
in-use emissions standard for that test 
group.170 
Since compliance with the Tier 2 fleet 
average depends on actual test group 
sales volumes and bin levels, it is not 
possible to determine compliance at the 
time the manufacturer applies for and 
receives a certificate of conformity for a 
test group. Instead, EPA requires the 
manufacturer to make a good faith 
demonstration in the certification 
application that vehicles in the test 
group will both (1) comply throughout 
their useful life with the emissions bin 
assigned, and (2) contribute to fleetwide 
compliance with the Tier 2 average 
when the year is over. EPA issues a 
certificate for the vehicles included in 
the test group based on this 
demonstration, and includes a condition 
in the certificate that if the manufacturer 
does not comply with the fleet average, 
then production vehicles from that test 
group will be treated as not covered by 
the certificate to the extent needed to 
bring the manufacturer’s fleet average 
into compliance with Tier 2. 
The certification process often occurs 
several months prior to production and 
manufacturer testing may occur months 
before the certificate is issued. The 
certification process for the Tier 2 
program is an efficient way for 
manufacturers to conduct the needed 
testing well in advance of certification, 
and to receive the needed certificates in 
a time frame which allows for the 
orderly production of vehicles. The use 
of a condition on the certificate has been 
an effective way to ensure compliance 
with the Tier 2 fleet average. 
EPA is proposing to similarly 
condition each certificate of conformity 
for the GHG program upon a 
manufacturer’s good faith 
demonstration of compliance with the 
manufacturer’s fleetwide average CO2 
standard. The following discussion 
explains how EPA proposes to integrate 
the proposed vehicle certification 
program into the existing certification 
program. 
a. Compliance Plans 
EPA is proposing that manufacturers 
submit a compliance plan to EPA prior 
to the beginning of the model year and 
prior to the certification of any test 
group. This plan would include the 
manufacturer’s estimate of its footprint- 
based standard (Section III.B), along 
with a demonstration of compliance 
with the standard based on projected 
model-level CO2 emissions, and 
production estimates. Manufacturers 
would submit the same information to 
NHTSA in the pre-model year report 
required for CAFE compliance. 
However, the GHG compliance plan 
could also include additional 
information relevant only to the EPA 
program. For example, manufacturers 
seeking to take advantage of air 
conditioning or other credit flexibilities 
(Section III.C) would include these in 
their compliance demonstration. 
Similarly, the compliance 
demonstration would need to include a 
credible plan for addressing deficits 
accrued in prior model years. EPA 
would review the compliance plan for 
technical viability and conduct a 
certification preview discussion with 
the manufacturer. EPA would view the 
compliance plan as part of the 
manufacturer’s good faith 
demonstration, but understands that 
initial projections can vary considerably 
from the reality of final production and 
emission results. EPA requests comment 
on the proposal to evaluate 
manufacturer compliance plans prior to 
the beginning of model year 
certification. EPA also requests 
comment on what criteria the agency 
should use to evaluate the sufficiency of 
the plan and on what steps EPA should 
take if it determines that a plan is 
unlikely to offset a deficit. 
b. Certification Test Groups and Test 
Vehicle Selection 
Manufacturers currently divide their 
fleet into ‘‘test groups’’ for certification 
purposes. The test group is EPA’s unit 
of certification; one certificate is issued 
per test group. These groupings cover 
vehicles with similar emission control 
system designs expected to have similar 
emissions performance.171 The factors 
considered for determining test groups 
include combustion cycle, engine type, 
engine displacement, number of 
cylinders and cylinder arrangement, 
fuel type, fuel metering system, catalyst 
construction and precious metal 
composition, among others. Vehicles 
having these features in common are 
generally placed in the same test 
group.172 Cars and trucks may be 
included in the same test group as long 
as they have similar emissions 
performance (manufacturers frequently 
produce cars and trucks that have 
identical engine designs and emission 
controls). 
EPA is proposing to retain the current 
Tier 2 test group structure for cars and 
light trucks in the certification 
requirements for CO2. At the time of 
certification, manufacturers would use 
the CO2 emission level from the Tier 2 
Emission Data Vehicle as a surrogate to 
represent all of the models in the test 
group. However, following certification

173 EPA noted this potential lack of connection 
between fuel economy testing and testing for 
emissions standard purposes when it first adopted 
fuel economy test procedures. See 41 FR at 38677 
(Sept. 10, 1976). 
further testing would generally be 
required for compliance with the fleet 
average CO2 standard as described 
below. EPA’s issuance of a certificate 
would be conditioned upon the 
manufacturer’s subsequent model level 
testing and attainment of the actual fleet 
average. Further discussion of these 
requirements is presented in Section 
III.E.6. 
EPA recognizes that the Tier 2 test 
group criteria do not necessarily relate 
to CO2 emission levels. For instance, 
while some of the criteria, such as 
combustion cycle, engine type and 
displacement, and fuel metering, may 
have a relationship to CO2 emissions, 
others, such as those pertaining to the 
catalyst, may not. In fact, there are many 
vehicle design factors that impact CO2 
generation and emission but are not 
included in EPA’s test group criteria.173 
Most important among these may be 
vehicle weight, horsepower, 
aerodynamics, vehicle size, and 
performance features. 
EPA considered, but is not proposing, 
a requirement for separate CO2 test 
groups established around criteria more 
directly related to CO2 emissions. 
Although CO2-specific test groups might 
more consistently predict CO2 emissions 
of all vehicles in the test group, the 
addition of a CO2 test group requirement 
would greatly increase the pre- 
production certification burden for both 
manufacturers and EPA. For example, a 
current Tier 2 test group would need to 
be split into two groups if automatic and 
manual transmissions models had been 
included in the same group. Two- and 
four-wheel drive vehicles in a current 
test group would similarly require 
separation, as would weight differences 
among vehicles. This would at least 
triple the number of test groups. EPA 
believes that the added burden of 
creating separate CO2 test groups is not 
warranted or necessary to maintain an 
appropriately rigorous certification 
program because the test group data are 
later replaced by model specific data 
which are used as the basis for 
determining compliance with a 
manufacturer’s fleet average standard. 
EPA believes that the current test 
group concept is appropriate for N2O 
and CH4 because the technologies that 
would be employed to control N2O and 
CH4 emissions would generally be the 
same as those used to control the 
criteria pollutants. 
As just discussed, the ‘‘worst case’’ 
vehicle a manufacturer selects as the 
Emissions Data Vehicle to represent a 
test group under Tier 2 (40 CFR 
86.1828–01) may not have the highest 
levels of CO2 in that group. For instance, 
there may be a heavier, more powerful 
configuration that would have higher 
CO2, but may, due to the way the 
catalytic converter has been matched to 
the engine, actually have lower NOX, 
CO, PM or HC. 
Therefore, in lieu of a separate CO2- 
specific test group, EPA considered 
requiring manufacturers to select a CO2 
test vehicle from within the Tier 2 test 
group that would be expected, based on 
good engineering judgment, to have the 
highest CO2 emissions within that test 
group. The CO2 emissions results from 
this vehicle would be used to establish 
an in-use CO2 emission standard for the 
test group. The requirement for a 
separate, worst case CO2 vehicle would 
provide EPA with some assurance that 
all vehicles within the test group would 
have CO2 emission levels at or below 
those of the selected vehicle, even if 
there is some variation in the CO2 
control strategies within the test group 
(such as different transmission types). 
Under this approach, the test vehicle 
might or might not be the same one that 
would be selected as worst case for 
criteria pollutants. Thus, manufacturers 
might be required to test two vehicles in 
each test group, rather than a single 
vehicle. This would represent an added 
timing burden to manufacturers because 
they might need to build additional test 
vehicles at the time of certification that 
previously weren’t required to be tested. 
Instead, EPA is proposing to require a 
single Emission Data Vehicle that would 
represent the test group for both Tier 2 
and CO2 certification. The manufacturer 
would be allowed to initially apply the 
Emission Data Vehicle’s CO2 emissions 
value to all models in the test group, 
even if other models in the test group 
are expected to have higher CO2 
emissions. However, as a condition of 
the certificate, this surrogate CO2 
emissions value would generally be 
replaced with actual, model-level CO2 
values based on results from CAFE 
testing that occurs later in the model 
year. This model level data would 
become the official certification test 
results (as per the conditioned 
certificate) and would be used to 
determine compliance with the fleet 
average. Only if the test vehicle is in fact 
the worst case CO2 vehicle for the test 
group could the manufacturer elect to 
apply the Emission Data Vehicle 
emission levels to all models in the test 
group for purposes of calculating fleet 
average emissions. Manufacturers 
would be unlikely to make this choice, 
because doing so would ignore the 
emissions performance of vehicle 
models in their fleet with lower CO2 
emissions and would unnecessarily 
inflate their CO2 fleet average. Testing at 
the model level already occurs and data 
are already being submitted to EPA for 
CAFE and labeling purposes, so it 
would be an unusual situation that 
would cause a manufacturer to ignore 
these data and choose to accept a higher 
CO2 fleet average. 
EPA requests comment regarding 
whether the Tier 2 test group can 
adequately represent CO2 emissions for 
certification purposes, and whether the 
Emission Data Vehicle’s CO2 emission 
level is an appropriate surrogate for all 
vehicles in a test group at the time of 
certification, given that the certificate 
would be conditioned upon additional 
model level testing occurring during the 
year (see Section III.E.6) and that the 
surrogate CO2 emission values would be 
replaced with model-level emissions 
data from those tests. Comments should 
also address EPA’s desire to minimize 
the up-front pre-production testing 
burden and whether the proposed 
efficiencies would be balanced by the 
requirement to test all model types in 
the fleet by the conclusion of the model 
year in order to establish the fleet 
average CO2 levels. 
There are two standards that the 
manufacturer would be subject to, the 
fleet average standard and the in-use 
standard for the useful life of the 
vehicle. Compliance with the fleet 
average standard is based on 
production-weighted averaging of the 
test data that applies for each model. 
For each model, the in-use standard is 
set at 10% higher than the level used for 
that model in calculating the fleet 
average. The certificate would cover 
both of these standards, and the 
manufacturer would have to 
demonstrate compliance with both of 
these standards for purposes of 
receiving a certificate of conformity. The 
certification process for the in-use 
standard is discussed below in Section 
III.E.4. 
c. Certification Testing Protocols and 
Procedures 
To be consistent with CAFE, EPA 
proposes to combine the CO2 emissions 
results from the FTP and HFET tests 
using the same calculation method used 
to determine fuel economy for CAFE 
purposes. This approach is appropriate 
for CO2 because CO2 and fuel economy 
are so closely related. Other than the 
fact that fuel economy is calculated 
using a harmonic average and CO2 
emissions can be calculated using a 
conventional average, the calculation 
methods are very similar. The FTP CO2

data will be weighted at 55%, and the 
highway CO2 data at 45%, and then 
averaged to determine the combined 
number. See Section III.B.1 for more 
detailed information on CO2 test 
procedures, Section III.C.1 on Air 
Conditioning Emissions, and Section 
III.B.6 for N2O and CH4 test procedures. 
For the purposes of compliance with 
the fleet average and in-use standards, 
the emissions measured from each test 
vehicle will include hydrocarbons (HC) 
and carbon monoxide (CO), in addition 
to CO2. All three of these exhaust 
constituents are currently measured and 
used to determine the amount of fuel 
burned over a given test cycle using a 
‘‘carbon balance equation’’ defined in 
the regulations, and thus measurement 
of these is an integral part of current 
fuel economy testing. As explained in 
Section III.C, it is important to account 
for the total carbon content of the fuel. 
Therefore the carbon-related 
combustion products HC and CO must 
be included in the calculations along 
with CO2. CO emissions are adjusted by 
a coefficient that reflects the carbon 
weight fraction (CWF) of the CO 
molecule, and HC emissions are 
adjusted by a coefficient that reflects the 
CWF of the fuel being burned (the 
molecular weight approach doesn’t 
work since there are many different 
hydrocarbons being accounted for). 
Thus, EPA is proposing that the carbon- 
related exhaust emissions of each test 
vehicle be calculated according to the 
following formula, where HC, CO, and 
CO2 are in units of grams per mile: 
Carbon-related exhaust emissions 
(grams/mile) = CWF*HC + 
1.571*CO + CO2 
As part of the current CAFE and Tier 
2 compliance programs, EPA selects a 
subset of vehicles for confirmatory 
testing at its National Vehicle and Fuel 
Emissions Laboratory. The purpose of 
confirmatory testing is to validate the 
manufacturer’s emissions and/or fuel 
economy data. Under this proposal, EPA 
would add CO2, N2O, and CH4 to the 
emissions measured in the course of 
Tier 2 and CAFE confirmatory testing. 
The emission values measured at the 
EPA laboratory would continue to stand 
as official, as under existing regulatory 
programs. 
As is the current practice with fuel 
economy testing, if during EPA’s 
confirmatory testing the EPA CO2 value 
differs from the manufacturer’s value by 
more than 3%, manufacturers could 
request a re-test. Also as with current 
practice, the results of the re-test would 
stand as official, even if they differ from 
the manufacturer value by more than 
3%. EPA is proposing to allow a re-test 
request based on a 3% or greater 
disparity since a manufacturer’s fleet 
average emissions level would be 
established on the basis of model level 
testing only (unlike Tier 2 for which a 
fixed bin standard structure provides 
the opportunity for a compliance 
buffer). EPA requests comment on 
whether the 3% value currently used 
during CAFE confirmatory testing is 
appropriate and should be retained 
under the proposed GHG program. 
4. Useful Life Compliance 
Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA requires 
emission standards to apply to vehicles 
throughout their statutory useful life, as 
further described in Section III.A. For 
emission programs that have fleet 
average standards, such as Tier 2 and 
the proposed CO2 standards, the useful 
life requirement applies to individual 
vehicles rather than to the fleet average 
standard. For example, in Tier 2 the 
useful life requirements apply to the 
individual emission standard levels or 
‘‘bins’’ that the vehicles are certified to, 
not the fleet average standard. For Tier 
2, the useful life requirement is 10 years 
or 120,000 miles with an optional 15 
year or 150,000 mile provision. For each 
model, the proposed CO2 standards in- 
use are the model specific levels used in 
calculating the fleet average, adjusted to 
be 10% higher. EPA is proposing the 
10% adjustment factor to provide some 
margin for production and test-to-test 
variability that could result in 
differences between initial model-level 
emission results used in calculating the 
fleet average and any subsequent in-use 
testing. EPA requests comment on 
whether a separate in-use standard is an 
appropriate means of addressing issues 
of variability and whether 10% is an 
appropriate adjustment. 
This in-use standard would apply for 
the same useful life period as in Tier 2. 
Section 202(i)(3)(D) of the CAA allows 
EPA to adopt useful life periods for 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks 
which differ from those in section 
202(d). Similar to Tier 2, the useful life 
requirements would be applicable to the 
model-level CO2 certification values 
(similar to the Tier 2 bins), not to the 
fleet average standard. 
EPA believes that the useful life 
period established for criteria pollutants 
under Tier 2 is also appropriate for CO2. 
Data from EPA’s current in-use 
compliance test program indicate that 
CO2 emissions from current technology 
vehicles increase very little with age 
and in some cases may actually improve 
slightly. The stable CO2 levels are 
expected because unlike criteria 
pollutants, CO2 emissions in current 
technology vehicles are not controlled 
by after treatment systems that may fail 
with age. Rather, vehicle CO2 emission 
levels depend primarily on fundamental 
vehicle design characteristics that do 
not change over time. Therefore, 
vehicles designed for a given CO2 
emissions level would be expected to 
sustain the same emissions profile over 
their full useful life. 
The CAA requires emission standards 
to be applicable for the vehicle’s full 
useful life. Under Tier 2 and other 
vehicle emission standard programs, 
EPA requires manufacturers to 
demonstrate at the time of certification 
that the new vehicles being certified 
will continue to meet emission 
standards throughout their useful life. 
EPA allows manufacturers several 
options for predicting in-use 
deterioration, including full vehicle 
testing, bench-aging specific 
components, and application of a 
deterioration factor based on data and/ 
or engineering judgment. 
In the specific case of CO2, EPA does 
not currently anticipate notable 
deterioration and is therefore proposing 
that an assigned deterioration factor be 
applied at the time of certification. EPA 
is further proposing an additive 
assigned deterioration factor of zero, or 
a multiplicative factor of one. EPA 
anticipates that the deterioration factor 
would be updated from time to time, as 
new data regarding emissions 
deterioration for CO2 are obtained and 
analyzed. Additionally, EPA may 
consider technology-specific 
deterioration factors, should data 
indicate that certain CO2 control 
technologies deteriorate differently than 
others. 
During compliance plan discussions 
prior to the beginning of the 
certification process, EPA would 
explore with each manufacturer any 
new technologies that could warrant use 
of a different deterioration factor. 
Manufacturers would not be allowed to 
use the assigned deterioration factor but 
rather would be required to establish an 
appropriate factor for any vehicle model 
determined likely to experience 
increases in CO2 emissions over the 
vehicle’s useful life. If such an instance 
were to occur, EPA is also proposing to 
allow manufacturers to use the whole- 
vehicle mileage accumulation method 
currently offered in EPA’s regulations. 
EPA requests comments on the 
proposal to allow manufacturers to use 
an EPA-assigned deterioration factor for 
CO2 useful life compliance, and to set 
that factor at zero (additive) or one 
(multiplicative). Particularly helpful 
would be data from in-use vehicles that 
demonstrate the rate of change in CO2 
emissions over a vehicle’s useful life,

technology. 
N2O and CH4 emissions are directly 
affected by vehicle emission control 
systems. Any of the durability options 
offered under EPA’s current compliance 
program can be used to determine how 
emissions of N2O and CH4 change over 
time. 
a. Ensuring Useful Life Compliance 
The CAA requires a vehicle to comply 
with emission standards over its 
regulatory useful life and affords EPA 
broad authority for the implementation 
of this requirement. As such, EPA has 
authority to require a manufacturer to 
remedy any noncompliance issues. The 
remedy can range from the voluntary or 
mandatory recall of any noncompliant 
vehicles to the recalculation of a 
manufacturers fleet average emissions 
level. This provides manufacturers with 
a strong incentive to design and build 
complying vehicles. 
Currently, EPA regulations require 
manufacturers to conduct in-use testing 
as a condition of certification. 
Specifically, manufacturers must 
commit to later procure and test 
privately-owned vehicles that have been 
normally used and maintained. The 
vehicles are tested to determine the in- 
use levels of criteria pollutants when 
they are in their first and third years of 
service. This testing is referred to as the 
In-Use Verification Program (IUVP) 
testing, which was first implemented as 
part of EPA’s CAP 2000 certification 
program.174 The emissions data 
collected from IUVP serves several 
purposes. It provides EPA with annual 
real-world in-use data representing the 
majority of certified vehicles. EPA uses 
IUVP data to identify in-use problems, 
validate the accuracy of the certification 
program, verify the manufacturer’s 
durability processes, and support 
emission modeling efforts. 
Manufacturers are required to test low 
mileage and high mileage vehicles over 
the FTP and US06 test cycles. They are 
also required to provide evaporative 
emissions and on-board diagnostics 
(OBD) data. 
Manufacturers are required to provide 
data for all regulated criteria pollutants. 
Some manufacturers voluntarily submit 
CO2 data as part of IUVP. EPA is 
proposing that for IUVP testing, all 
manufacturers will provide emission 
data for CO2 and also for N2O and CH4. 
EPA is also proposing that 
manufacturers perform the highway test 
cycle as part of IUVP. Since the 
proposed CO2 standard reflects a 
combined value of FTP and highway 
results, it is necessary to include the 
highway emission test in IUVP to enable 
EPA to compare an in-use CO2 level 
with a vehicle’s in-use standard. EPA 
requests comments on adding the 
highway test cycle as part of the IUVP 
requirements. 
Another component of the CAP 2000 
certification program is the In-Use 
Confirmatory Program (IUCP). This is a 
manufacturer-conducted recall quality 
in-use test program that can be used as 
the basis for EPA to order an emission 
recall. In order to qualify for IUCP, there 
is a threshold of 1.30 times the 
certification emission standard and an 
additional requirement that at least 50% 
of the test vehicles for the test group fail 
for the same pollutant. EPA is proposing 
to exclude IUVP data for CO2, N2O, and 
CH4 emissions from the IUCP 
thresholds. At this time, EPA does not 
have sufficient data to determine if the 
existing thresholds are appropriate or 
even applicable to those emissions. 
Once EPA can gather more data from the 
IUVP program and from EPA’s internal 
surveillance program described below, 
EPA will reassess the need to exclude 
IUCP thresholds, and if warranted, 
propose a separate rulemaking 
establishing IUCP threshold criteria 
which may include CO2, N2O, and CH4 
emissions. EPA requests comment on 
the proposal to exclude CO2, N2O, and 
CH4 from the IUCP threshold. 
EPA has also administered its own in- 
use testing program for light-duty 
vehicles under authority of section 
207(c) of the CAA for more than 30 
years. In this program, EPA procures 
and tests representative privately owned 
vehicles to determine whether they are 
complying with emission standards. 
When testing indicates noncompliance, 
EPA works with the manufacturer to 
determine the cause of the problem and 
to conduct appropriate additional 
testing to determine its extent or the 
effectiveness of identified remedies. 
This program operates in conjunction 
with the IUVP program and other 
sources of information to provide a 
comprehensive picture of the 
compliance profile for the entire fleet 
and address compliance problems that 
are identified. EPA proposes to add CO2, 
N2O, and CH4 to the emissions 
measurements it collects during 
surveillance testing. 
b. In-Use Compliance Standard 
For Tier 2, the in-use standard and the 
certification standard are the same. In- 
use compliance for an individual 
vehicle is determined by comparing the 
vehicle’s in-use emission results with 
the emission standard levels or ‘‘bin’’ to 
which the vehicle is certified rather 
than to the Tier 2 fleet average standard 
for the manufacturer. This is because as 
part of a fleet average standard, 
individual vehicles can be certified to 
various emission standard levels, which 
could be higher or lower than the fleet 
average standard. Thus, comparing an 
individual vehicle to the fleet average, 
where that vehicle was certified to an 
emission level that could be different 
than the fleet average level, would be 
inappropriate. 
This would also be true for the 
proposed CO2 fleet average standard. 
Therefore, to ensure that an individual 
vehicle complies with the proposed CO2 
standards in-use, it is necessary to 
compare the vehicle’s in-use CO2 
emission result with the appropriate 
model-level certification CO2 level used 
in determining the manufacturer’s fleet 
average result. 
There is a fundamental difference 
between the proposed CO2 standards 
and Tier 2 standards. For Tier 2, the 
certification standard is one of eight 
different emission levels, or ‘‘bins,’’ 
whereas for the proposed CO2 fleet 
average standard, the certification 
standard is the model-level certification 
CO2 result. The Tier 2 fleet average 
standard is calculated using the ‘‘bin’’ 
emission level or standard, not the 
actual certification emission level of the 
certification test vehicle. So no matter 
how low a manufacturer’s actual 
certification emission results are, the 
fleet average is still calculated based on 
the ‘‘bin’’ level rather than the lower 
certification result. In contrast, EPA is 
proposing that the CO2 fleet average 
standard would be calculated using the 
actual vehicle model-level CO2 values 
from the certification test vehicles. With 
a known certification emission 
standard, such as the Tier 2 ‘‘bins,’’ 
manufacturers typically attempt to over- 
comply with the standard to give 
themselves some cushion for potentially 
higher in-use testing results due to 
emissions performance deterioration 
and/or variability that could result in 
higher emission levels during 
subsequent in-use testing. For our 
proposed CO2 standards, the 
certification standard is the actual 
certification vehicle test result, thus 
manufacturers cannot over comply since 
the certification test vehicle result will 
always be the value used in determining 
the CO2 fleet average. If the 
manufacturer attempted to design the 
vehicle to achieve a lower CO2 value, 
similar to Tier 2 for in-use purposes, the 
new lower CO2 value would simply 
become the new certification standard. 
The CO2 fleet average standard is 
based on the performance of pre- 
production technology that is

175 See pages 39–41 of EPA’s Vehicle and Engine 
Compliance Activities 2007 Progress Report (EPA– 
420–R–08–011) published in October 2008. This 
document is available electronically at http:// 
epa.gov/otaq/about/420r08011.pdf. 
representative of the point of 
production, and while there is expected 
to be limited if any deterioration in 
effectiveness for any vehicle during the 
useful life, the fleet average standard 
does not take into account the test to 
test variability or production variability 
that can affect in-use levels. Therefore, 
EPA believes that unlike Tier 2, it is 
necessary to have a different in-use 
standard for CO2 to account for these 
variabilities. EPA is proposing to set the 
in-use standard at 10% higher than the 
appropriate model-level certification 
CO2 level used in determining the 
manufacturer’s fleet average result. 
As described above, manufacturers 
typically design their vehicles to emit at 
emission levels considerably below the 
standards. This intentional difference 
between the actual emission level and 
the emission standard is referred to as 
‘‘certification margin,’’ since it is 
typically the difference between the 
certification emission level and the 
emission standard. The certification 
margin can provide manufacturers with 
some protection from exceeding 
emission standards in-use, since the in- 
use standards are typically the same as 
the certification standards. For Tier 2, 
the certification margin is the delta 
between the specific emission standard 
level, or ‘‘bin,’’ to which the vehicle is 
certified, and the vehicle’s certification 
emission level. 
Since the level of the fleet average 
standard does not reflect this kind of 
variability, EPA believes it is 
appropriate to set an in-use standard 
that provides manufacturers with an in- 
use compliance factor of 10% that will 
act as a surrogate for a certification 
margin. The factor would only be 
applicable to CO2 emissions, and would 
be applied to the model-level test results 
that are used to establish the model- 
level in-use standard. 
If the in-use emission result for the 
vehicle exceeds the model-level CO2 
certification result multiplied by the in- 
use compliance factor of 10%, then the 
vehicle would have exceeded the in-use 
emission standard. The in-use 
compliance factor would apply to all in- 
use compliance testing including IUVP, 
selective enforcement audits, and EPA’s 
internal test program. 
The intent of the separate in-use 
standard, based on a 10% compliance 
factor adjustment, is to provide a 
reasonable margin such that vehicles are 
not automatically deemed as exceeding 
standards simply because of normal 
variability in test results. EPA has some 
concerns however that this in-use 
compliance factor could be perceived as 
providing manufacturers with the 
ability to design their fleets to generate 
CO2 emissions up to 10% higher than 
the actual values they use to certify and 
to calculate the year end fleet average 
value that determines compliance with 
the fleet average standard. This concern 
provides additional rationale for 
requiring FTP and HFET IUVP data for 
CO2 emissions to ensure that in-use 
values are not regularly 10% higher 
than the values used in the fleet average 
calculation. If in the course of reviewing 
a manufacturer’s IUVP data it becomes 
apparent that a manufacturer’s CO2 
results are consistently higher than the 
values used for certification, EPA would 
discuss the matter with the 
manufacturer and consider possible 
resolutions such as changes to ensure 
that the emissions test data more 
accurately reflects the emissions level of 
vehicles at the time of production, 
increased EPA confirmatory testing, and 
other similar measures. 
EPA selected a value of 10% for the 
in-use standard based on a review of 
EPA’s fuel economy labeling and CAFE 
confirmatory test results for the past 
several vehicle model years. The EPA 
data indicate that it is common for test 
variability to range between three to six 
percent and only on rare occasions to 
exceed 10%. EPA believes that a value 
of 10% should be sufficient to account 
for testing variability and any 
production variability that a 
manufacturer may encounter. EPA 
considered both higher and lower 
values. The Tier 2 fleet as a whole, for 
example, has a certification margin 
approaching 50%.175 However, there are 
some fundamental differences between 
CO2 emissions and other criteria 
pollutants in the magnitude of the 
pollutants. Tier 2 NMOG and NOX 
emission standards are hundredths of a 
gram per mile (e.g., 0.07 g/mi NOX & 
0.09 g/mi NMOG), whereas the CO2 
standards are four orders of magnitude 
greater (e.g., 250 g/mi). Thus EPA does 
not believe it is appropriate to consider 
a value on the order of 50 percent. In 
addition, little deterioration in 
emissions control is expected in-use. 
The adjustment factor addresses only 
one element of what is usually built into 
a compliance margin. 
EPA requests comments regarding a 
proposed in-use standard that uses an 
in-use compliance factor. Specifically, is 
a factor the best way to address the 
technical and other feasibility of the in- 
use standard; is 10% the appropriate 
factor; can EPA expect variability to 
decrease as manufacturing experience 
increases, in which case would it be 
appropriate for the in-use compliance 
factor of 10% to decrease over time? 
EPA especially requests any data to 
support such comments. 
5. Credit Program Implementation 
As described in Section III.E.2 above, 
for each manufacturer’s model year 
production, EPA is proposing that the 
manufacturer would average the CO2 
emissions within each of the two 
averaging sets (passenger cars and 
trucks) and compare that with its 
respective fleet average CO2 standards 
(which in turn would have been 
determined from the appropriate 
footprint curve applicable to that model 
year). In addition to this within- 
company averaging, EPA is proposing 
that when a manufacturer’s fleet average 
CO2 emissions of vehicles produced in 
an averaging set over-complies 
compared to the applicable fleet average 
standard, the manufacturer could 
generate credits that it could save for 
later use (banking) or could transfer to 
another manufacturer (trading). Section 
III.C discusses opportunities that EPA is 
proposing for manufacturers to earn 
additional credits, beyond those simply 
calculated by ‘‘over-achieving’’ their 
applicable standard. Implementation of 
the credit program generally involves 
two steps: calculation of the credit 
amount and reporting the amount and 
the associated data and calculations to 
EPA. 
Of the various credit programs being 
proposed by EPA, there are two broad 
types. One type of credit directly lowers 
a manufacturer’s actual fleet average by 
virtue of being applied to the 
methodology for calculating the fleet 
average emissions. Examples of this 
type of credit include the credits 
available for alternative fuel vehicles 
and for advanced technology vehicles. 
The second type of credit is 
independent of the calculation of a 
manufacturer’s fleet average. Rather 
than giving credit by lowering a 
manufacturer’s fleet average via a credit 
mechanism, these credits (in 
megagrams) are calculated separately 
and are simply added to the 
manufacturer’s overall ‘‘bank’’ of credits 
(or debits). Using a fictional example, 
the remainder of this section will step 
through the different types of credits 
and show where and how they are 
calculated and how they impact a 
manufacturer’s available credits.

CO2 Emissions Below the Standard

better than the applicable standard.

(separate standards are calculated for 
cars and trucks) using the footprint- 
based equations described in Section 
III.B. A manufacturer’s actual end-of- 
year fleet average CO2 is calculated 
similarly to the way in which CAFE 
values are currently calculated; in fact, 
the regulations are essentially identical. 
The current CAFE calculation methods 
are in 40 CFR Part 600. EPA is 
proposing to amend key subparts and 
sections of Part 600 to require that fleet 
average CO2 be calculated in a manner 
parallel to the way CAFE values are 
calculated. First manufacturers would 
determine a CO2-equivalent value for 
each model type. The CO2-equivalent 
value is a summation of the carbon- 
containing constituents of the exhaust 
emissions, with each weighted by a 
coefficient that reflects the carbon 
weight fraction of that constituent. For 
gasoline and diesel vehicles this simply 
involves measurement of total 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in 
addition to CO2, but becomes somewhat 
more complex for alternative fuel 
vehicles due to the different nature of 
their exhaust emissions. For example, 
for ethanol-fueled vehicles, the emission 
tests must measure ethanol, methanol, 
formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde in 
addition to CO2. However, all these 
measurements are necessary to 
determine fuel economy and thus no 
new testing or data collection would be 
required. Second, manufacturers would 
calculate a fleet average by weighting 
the CO2-equivalent value for each model 
type by the production of that model 
type, as they currently do for the CAFE 
program. Again, this would be done 
separately for cars and trucks. Finally, 
the manufacturer would compare the 
calculated standard with the average 
that is actually achieved to determine 
the credits (or debits). Both the 
determination of the applicable 
standard and the actual fleet average 
would be done after the model year is 
complete and using final model year 
production data. 
Consider a basic example where 
Manufacturer ‘‘A’’ has calculated a car 
standard of 300 grams/mile and a fleet 
average of 290 grams/mile (Figure 
III.E.5–1). Further assume that the 
manufacturer produced 500,000 cars. 
The credit is calculated by taking the 
difference between the standard and the 
fleet average (300–290=10) and 
multiplying it by the production of 
500,000. This result is then multiplied 
by the lifetime vehicle miles travelled 
(for cars this is 190,971 miles), then 
finally divided by 1,000,000 to convert 
from grams to total megagrams. The 
result is the number of CO2 megagrams 
of credit (or deficit, if the manufacturer 
was not able to comply with the fleet 
average standard) generated by the 
manufacturer’s car fleet. In this 
example, the result is 954,855 
megagrams.

b. Advanced Technology Credits 
Advanced technology credits directly 
impact a manufacturer’s fleet average, 
thus increasing the amount of credits 
they earn (or reducing the amount of 
debits that would otherwise accrue). To 
earn these credits, manufacturers that 
produce electric vehicles, plug-in 
hybrid electric vehicles, or fuel cell 
electric vehicles would include these 
vehicles in the fleet average calculation 
with their model type emission values 
(0 g/m for electric vehicles and fuel cell 
electric vehicles, and a measured CO2 
value for plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles), but would apply the proposed 
multiplier of 2.0 to the production 
volume of each of these vehicles. This 
approach would thus enhance the 
impact that each of these low-CO2 
advanced technology vehicles has on 
the manufacturer’s fleet average. 
EPA is proposing to limit availability 
of advanced technology credits to the 
technologies noted above, with the 
additional limitation that the vehicles 
must be certified to Tier 2 Bin 5 
emission standards or cleaner (this 
obviously applies primarily to plug-in 
hybrid electric vehicles). EPA is 
proposing to use the following 
definitions to determine which vehicles

are eligible for the advanced technology 
credits: 
• Electric vehicle means a motor 
vehicle that is powered solely by an 
electric motor drawing current from a 
rechargeable energy storage system, 
such as from storage batteries or other 
portable electrical energy storage 
devices, including hydrogen fuel cells, 
provided that: 
Æ (1) Recharge energy must be drawn 
from a source off the vehicle, such as 
residential electric service; and 
Æ (2) The vehicle must be certified to 
the emission standards of Bin #1 of 
Table S04–1 in paragraph (c)(6) of 
§ 86.1811. 
• Fuel cell electric vehicle means a 
motor vehicle propelled solely by an 
electric motor where energy for the 
motor is supplied by a fuel cell. 
• Fuel cell means an electrochemical 
cell that produces electricity via the 
reaction of a consumable fuel on the 
anode with an oxidant on the cathode 
in the presence of an electrolyte. 
• Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle 
(PHEV) means a hybrid electric vehicle 
that: (1) Has the capability to charge the 
battery from an off-vehicle electric 
source, such that the off-vehicle source 
cannot be connected to the vehicle 
while the vehicle is in motion, and (2) 
has an equivalent all-electric range of no 
less than 10 miles. 
With some simplifying assumptions, 
assume that 25,000 of Manufacturer A’s 
fleet are now plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles with CO2 emissions of 100 
g/mi, and the remaining 475,000 are 
conventional technology vehicles with 
average CO2 emissions of 290 grams/ 
mile. By applying the factor of 2.0 to the 
electric vehicle production numbers in 
the appropriate places in the fleet 
average calculation formula 
Manufacturer A now has more than 2.6 
million credits (Figure III.E.5–2). 
Without the use of the multiplier 
Manufacturer A’s fleet average would be 
281 instead of 272, which would 
generate about 1.8 million credits.

c. Flexible-Fuel Vehicle Credits 
As noted in Section III.C, treatment of 
flexible-fuel vehicle (FFV) credits differs 
between 2012 to 2015 and 2016 and 
later. For the 2012 through 2015 model 
years the FFV credits will be calculated 
as they are in the CAFE program for the 
same model years, except that formulae 
in the regulations would be modified as 
needed to do the calculations in terms 
of grams per mile of CO2 rather than 
miles per gallon. Like the advanced 
technology vehicle credits, these credits 
are integral to the fleet average 
calculation, but rather than crediting the 
vehicles with an artificially inflated 
quantity as in the advanced technology 
credit program described above, the FFV 
credit program allows the vehicles to be 
represented by artificially reduced 
emissions. To use this credit program, 
the CO2 emissions of FFVs will be 
represented by the average of two 
things: the CO2 emissions while 
operating on gasoline, and the CO2 
emissions operating on the alternative 
fuel multiplied by 0.15. 
For example, Manufacturer A now 
makes 30,000 FFVs with CO2 emissions 
of 280 g/mi using gasoline and 260 
g/mi using ethanol. The CO2 emissions 
that would represent the FFVs in the 
fleet average calculation would be 
calculated as follows: 
FFV emissions = (280 + 260×0.15) ÷ 2 
= 160 g/mi

Including these FFVs with the 
applicable credit in Manufacturer A’s 
fleet average, as shown below in Figure 
III.E.5–3, further reduces the fleet 
average to 256 grams/mile and increases 
the manufacturer’s credits to about 4.2 
million megagrams. 
In the 2016 and later model years the 
calculation of FFV emissions would be 
much the same except that the 
determination of the CO2 value to 
represent an FFV model type would be 
based upon the actual use of the 
alternative fuel and on actual CO2 
emissions while operating on that fuel. 
EPA’s default assumption in the 
regulations is that the alternative fuel is 
used negligibly, and the CO2 value that 
would apply to an FFV by default 
would be the value determined for 
operation on conventional fuel. 
However, if the manufacturer believes

49570 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
that the alternative fuel is used in real- 
world driving and that accounting for 
this use could improve the fleet average, 
the manufacturer would have two 
options. First, the regulations would 
allow a manufacturer to request that 
EPA determine an appropriate 
weighting value for an alternative fuel to 
reflect the degree of use of that fuel in 
FFVs relative to real-world use of the 
conventional fuel. Section III.C 
describes how EPA might make this 
determination. Any value determined 
by EPA would be published via 
guidance letter to manufacturers, and 
that weighting value would be available 
for all manufacturers to use for that fuel. 
A second option proposed in the 
regulations would allow a manufacturer 
to determine the degree of alternative 
fuel use for their own vehicle(s), using 
a variety of potential methods. Both the 
method and the use of the final results 
would have to be approved by EPA 
before their use would be allowed. In 
either case, whether EPA supplies the 
weighting factors or the manufacturer 
determines them, the CO2 emissions of 
an FFV in 2016 and later would be as 
follows (assuming non-zero use of the 
alternative fuel): 
(W1×CO2conv)+(W2×CO2alt), 
Where, 
W1 and W2 are the proportion of miles 
driven using conventional fuel and 
alternative fuel, respectively, CO2conv is the 
CO2 value while using conventional fuel, and 
CO2alt is the CO2 value while using the 
alternative fuel. 
d. Dedicated Alternative Fuel Vehicle 
Credits 
Like the FFV credit program 
described above, these credits would be 
treated differently in the first years of 
the program than in the 2016 and later 
model years. In fact, these credits are 
essentially identical to the FFV credits 
except for two things: (1) There is no 
need to average CO2 values for gasoline 
and alternative fuel, and (2) in 2016 and 
later there is no demonstration needed 
to get a benefit from the alternative fuel. 
The CO2 values are essentially 
determined the same way they are for 
FFVs operating on the alternative fuel. 
For the 2012 through 2015 model years 
the CO2 test results are multiplied by 
the credit adjustment factor of 0.15, and 
the result is production-weighted in the 
fleet average calculation. For example, 
assume that Manufacturer A now 
produces 20,000 dedicated CNG 
vehicles with CO2 emissions of 220 
grams/mile, in addition to the FFVs and 
PHEVs already included in their fleet 
(Figure III.E.5–4). Prior to the 2016 
model year the CO2 emissions 
representing these CNG vehicles would 
be 33 grams/mile (220 × 0.15).

The calculation for 2016 and later 
would be exactly the same except the 
0.15 credit adjustment factor would be 
removed from the equation, and the 
CNG vehicles would simply be 
production-weighted in the equation 
using their actual emissions value of 
220 grams/mile instead of the 
‘‘credited’’ value of 33 grams/mile. 
e. Air Conditioning Leakage Credits 
Unlike the credit programs described 
above, air conditioning-related credits 
do not affect the overall calculation of 
the fleet average. Whether a 
manufacturer generates zero air 
conditioning credits or many, the 
calculated fleet average remains the 
same. Air conditioning credits are 
calculated and added to any credits (or 
deficit) that results from the fleet 
average calculation. Thus, these credits 
can increase a manufacturer’s credit 
balance or offset a deficit, but their 
calculation is external to the fleet 
average calculation. As noted in Section 
III.C, manufacturers could generate 
credits for reducing the leakage of 
refrigerant from their air conditioning 
systems. To do this the manufacturer 
would identify an air conditioning 
system improvement, indicate that they

49572 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
intend to use the improvement to 
generate credits, and then calculate an 
annual leakage rate (grams/year) for that 
system based on the method defined by 
the proposed regulations. Air 
conditioning credits would be 
determined separately for cars and 
trucks using the car and truck-specific 
equations described in Section III.C. 
In order to put these credits on the 
same basis as the basic and other credits 
describe above, the air conditioning 
leakage credits would need to be 
calculated separately for cars and 
trucks. Thus, the resulting grams per 
mile credit determined from the 
appropriate car or truck equation would 
be multiplied by the lifetime VMT 
(190,971 for cars; 221,199 for trucks), 
and then divided by 1,000,000 to get the 
total megagrams of CO2 credits 
generated by the improved air 
conditioning system. Although the 
calculations are done separately for cars 
and trucks, the total megagrams would 
be summed and then added to the 
overall credit balance maintained by the 
manufacturer. 
For example, assume that 
Manufacturer A has improved an air 
conditioning system that is installed in 
250,000 cars and that the calculated 
leakage rate is 12 grams/year. Assume 
that the manufacturer has also 
implemented a new refrigerant with a 
Global Warming Potential of 850. In this 
case the credit per air conditioning unit, 
rounded to the nearest gram per mile 
would be: 
[13.8 × [1—(12/16.6 × 850/1430)] = 7.9 
g/mi. 
Total megagrams of credits would 
then be: 
[ 7.9 × 250,000 × 190971 ] ÷ 1,000,000 
= 377,168 Mg. 
These credits would be added directly 
to a manufacturer’s total balance; thus 
in this example Manufacturer A would 
now have, after consideration of all the 
above credits, a total of 5,437,900 
Megagrams of credits. 
f. Air Conditioning Efficiency Credits 
As noted in Section III.C.1.b, 
manufacturers could earn credits for 
improvements in air conditioning 
efficiency that reduce the impact of the 
air conditioning system on fuel 
consumption. These credits are similar 
to the air conditioning leakage credits 
described above, in that these credits are 
determined independently from the 
manufacturer’s fleet average calculation, 
and the resulting credits are added to 
the manufacturer’s overall balance for 
the respective model year. Like the air 
conditioning leakage credits, these 
credits can increase a manufacturer’s 
credit balance or offset a deficit, but 
their calculation is external to the fleet 
average calculation. 
In order to put these credits on the 
same basis as the basic and other credits 
describe above, the air conditioning 
leakage credits would need to be 
calculated separately for cars and 
trucks. Thus, the resulting grams per 
mile credit determined in the above 
equation would be multiplied by the 
lifetime VMT (190,971 for cars; 221,199 
for trucks), and then divided by 
1,000,000 to get the total megagrams of 
CO2 credits generated by the improved 
air conditioning system. Although the 
calculations are done separately for cars 
and trucks, the total megagrams can be 
summed and then added to the overall 
credit balance maintained by the 
manufacturer. 
As described in Section III.C, 
manufacturers would determine their 
credit based on selections from a menu 
of technologies, each of which provides 
a gram per mile credit amount. The 
credits would be summed for all the 
technologies implemented by the 
manufacturer, but could not exceed 5.7 
grams per mile. Once this is done, the 
calculation is a straightforward 
translation of a gram per mile credit to 
total car or truck megagrams, using the 
same methodology described above. For 
example, if Manufacturer A implements 
enough technologies to get the 
maximum 5.7 grams per mile for an air 
conditioning system that sells 250,000 
units in cars, the calculation of total 
credits would be as follows: 
[5.7 × 250,000 × 190971] ÷ 1,000,000 = 
272,134 Mg. 
These credits would be added directly 
to a manufacturer’s total balance; thus 
in this example Manufacturer A would 
now have, after consideration of all the 
above credits, a total of 5,710,034 
Megagrams of credits. 
g. Off-Cycle Technology Credits 
As described in Section III.C, these 
credits would be available for certain 
technologies that achieve real-world 
CO2 reductions that aren’t adequately 
captured on the city or highway test 
cycles used to determine compliance 
with the fleet average standards. Like 
the air conditioning credits, these 
credits are independent of the fleet 
average calculation. Section III.C.4 
describes two options for generating 
these credits: either using EPA’s 5-cycle 
fuel economy labeling methodology, or 
if that method fails to capture the CO2- 
reducing impact of the technology, the 
manufacturer could propose and use, 
with EPA approval, a different 
analytical approach to determining the 
credit amount. Like the air conditioning 
credits above, these credits would have 
to be determined separately for cars and 
trucks because of the differing lifetime 
mileage assumptions between cars and 
trucks. 
Using the 5-cycle approach would be 
relatively straightforward, and because 
the 5-cycle formulae account for 
nationwide variations in driving 
conditions, no additional adjustments to 
the test results would be necessary. The 
manufacturer would simply calculate a 
5-cycle CO2 value with the technology 
installed and operating and compare it 
with a 5-cycle CO2 value determined 
without the technology installed and/or 
operating. Existing regulations describe 
how to calculate 5-cycle fuel economy 
values, and the proposed regulations 
contain provisions that describe how to 
calculate 5-cycle CO2 values. The 
manufacturer would have to design a 
test program that accounts for vehicle 
differences if the technology is installed 
in different vehicle types, and enough 
data would have to be collected to 
address data uncertainty issues. A 
description of such a test program and 
the results would be submitted to EPA 
for approval. 
As noted in Section III.C.4, a 
manufacturer-developed testing, data 
collection and analysis program would 
require some additional EPA approval 
and oversight. Once the demonstration 
of the CO2 reduction of an off-cycle 
technology is complete, however, and 
the resulting value accounts for 
variations in driving, climate and other 
conditions across the country, the two 
approaches are treated fundamentally 
the same way and in a way that parallels 
the approach for determining the air 
conditioning credits described above. 
Once a gram per mile value is approved 
by the EPA, the manufacturer would 
determine the total credit value by 
multiplying the gram per mile per 
vehicle credit by the volume of vehicles 
with that technology and approved for 
use of the credit. This would then be 
multiplied by the lifetime vehicle miles 
for cars or trucks, whichever applies, 
and divided by 1,000,000 to obtain total 
Megagrams of CO2 credits. These credits 
would then be added to the 
manufacturer’s total balance for the 
given model year. Just like the above air 
conditioning case, an off-cycle 
technology that is demonstrated to 
achieve an average CO2 reduction of 4 
grams/mile and that is installed in 
175,000 cars would generate credits as 
follows: 
[4 × 175,000 × 190971] ÷ 1,000,000 = 
133,680 Mg.

Inflation Adjustment, 69 FR 7121 (Feb. 13, 2004) 
Continued 
h. End-of-Year Reporting 
In general, implementation of the 
averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) 
program, including the calculation of 
credits and deficits, would be 
accomplished via existing reporting 
mechanisms. EPA’s existing regulations 
define how manufacturers calculate 
fleet average miles per gallon for CAFE 
compliance purposes, and EPA is 
proposing to modify these regulations to 
also require the parallel calculation of 
fleet average CO2 levels for car and light 
truck compliance categories. These 
regulations already require an end-of- 
year report for each model year, 
submitted to EPA, which details the test 
results and calculations that determine 
each manufacturer’s CAFE levels. EPA 
is proposing to require that this report 
also include fleet average CO2 levels. In 
addition to requiring reporting of the 
actual fleet average achieved, this end- 
of-year report would also contain the 
calculations and data determining the 
manufacturer’s applicable fleet average 
standard for that model year. As under 
the existing Tier 2 program, the report 
would be required to contain the fleet 
average standard, all values required to 
calculate the fleet average standard, the 
actual fleet average CO2 that was 
achieved, all values required to 
calculate the actual fleet average, the 
number of credits generated or debits 
incurred, all the values required to 
calculate the credits or debits, and the 
resulting balance of credits or debits. 
Because of the multitude of credit 
programs that are available, the end-of- 
year report will be required to have 
more data and a more defined and 
specific structure than the CAFE end– 
of-year report does today. Although 
requiring ‘‘all the data required’’ to 
calculate a given value should be 
inclusive, the proposed report would 
contain some requirements specific to 
certain types of credits. 
For advanced technology credits that 
apply to vehicles like electric vehicles 
and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, 
manufacturers would be required to 
identify the number and type of these 
vehicles and the effect of these credits 
on their fleet average. The same would 
be true for credits due to flexible-fuel 
and alternative-fuel vehicles, although 
for 2016 and later flexible-fuel credits 
manufacturers would also have to 
provide a demonstration of the actual 
use of the alternative fuel in-use and the 
resulting calculations of CO2 values for 
such vehicles. For air conditioning 
leakage credits manufacturers would 
have to include a summary of their use 
of such credits that would include 
which air conditioning systems were 
subject to such credits, information 
regarding the vehicle models which 
were equipped with credit-earning air 
conditioning systems, the production 
volume of these air conditioning 
systems, the leakage score of each air 
conditioning system generating credits, 
and the resulting calculation of leakage 
credits. Air conditioning efficiency 
reporting will be somewhat more 
complicated given the phase-in of the 
efficiency test, and reporting would 
have to detail compliance with the 
phase-in as well as the test results and 
the resulting efficiency credits 
generated. Similar reporting 
requirements would also apply to the 
variety of possible off-cycle credit 
options, where manufacturers would 
have to report the applicable 
technology, the amount of credit per 
unit, the production volume of the 
technology, and the total credits from 
that technology. 
Although it is the final end-of-year 
report, when final production numbers 
are known, that will determine the 
degree of compliance and the actual 
values of any credits being generated by 
manufacturers, EPA is also proposing 
that manufacturers be prepared to 
discuss their compliance approach and 
their potential use of the variety of 
credit options in pre-certification 
meetings that EPA routinely has with 
manufacturers. In addition, and in 
conjunction with a pre-model year 
report required under the CAFE 
program, the manufacturer would be 
required to submit projections of all of 
the elements described above. 
Finally, to the extent that there are 
any credit transactions, the 
manufacturer would have to detail in 
the end-of-year report documentation on 
all credit transactions that the 
manufacturer has engaged in. 
Information for each transaction would 
include: The name of the credit 
provider, the name of the credit 
recipient, the date the transfer occurred, 
the quantity of credits transferred, and 
the model year in which the credits 
were earned. Failure by the 
manufacturer to submit the annual 
report in the specified time period 
would be considered to be a violation of 
section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. 
6. Enforcement 
As discussed above in Section III.E.5 
under the proposed program, 
manufacturers would report to EPA 
their fleet average standard for a given 
model year (reporting separately for 
each of the car and truck averaging sets), 
the credits or deficits generated in the 
current year, the balance of credit 
balances or deficits (taking into account 
banked credits, deficit carry-forward, 
etc. see Section III.E.5), and whether 
they were in compliance with the fleet 
average standard under the terms of the 
regulations. EPA would review the 
annual reports, figures, and calculations 
submitted by the manufacturer to 
determine any nonconformance. EPA 
requests comments on the above 
approach for monitoring and 
enforcement of the fleet average 
standard. 
Each certificate, required prior to 
introduction into commerce, would be 
conditioned upon the manufacturer 
attaining the CO2 fleet average standard. 
If a manufacturer failed to meet this 
condition and had not generated or 
purchased enough credits to cover the 
fleet average exceedance following the 
three year deficit carry-forward (Section 
III.B.4, then EPA would review the 
manufacturer’s sales for the most recent 
model year and designate which 
vehicles caused the fleet average 
standard to be exceeded. EPA would 
designate as nonconforming those 
vehicles with the highest emission 
values first, continuing until a number 
of vehicles equal to the calculated 
number of non-complying vehicles as 
determined above is reached and those 
vehicles would be considered to be not 
covered by the certificates of conformity 
covering those model types. In a test 
group where only a portion of vehicles 
would be deemed nonconforming, EPA 
would determine the actual 
nonconforming vehicles by counting 
backwards from the last vehicle sold in 
that model type. A manufacturer would 
be subject to penalties and injunctive 
orders on an individual vehicle basis for 
sale of vehicles not covered by a 
certificate. This is the same general 
mechanism used for the National LEV 
and Tier 2 corporate average standards, 
except that these programs operate 
slightly differently in that the non- 
compliant vehicles would be designated 
not in the most recent model year, but 
in the model year in which the deficit 
originated. EPA requests comment on 
which approach is most appropriate; the 
Tier 2 approach of penalizing vehicles 
from the year in which the deficit was 
generated, or the proposed approach 
that would penalize vehicles from the 
year in which the manufacturer failed to 
make up the deficit as required. 
Section 205 of the CAA authorizes 
EPA to assess penalties of up to $37,500 
per vehicle for violations of the 
requirements or prohibitions of this 
proposed rule.176 This section of the

49574 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
and Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment 
Rule, 73 FR 75340 (Dec. 11, 2008). 
177 In re Spang & Co., 6 E.A.D. 226, 249 (EAB 
1995). 
178 B.J. Carney Industries, 7 E.A.D. 171, 232, n. 82 
(EAB 1997). 179 40 CFR 86.1806–04. 
CAA provides that the agency shall take 
the following penalty factors into 
consideration in determining the 
appropriate penalty for any specific 
case: The gravity of the violation, the 
economic benefit or savings (if any) 
resulting from the violation, the size of 
the violator’s business, the violator’s 
history of compliance with this title, 
action taken to remedy the violation, the 
effect of the penalty on the violator’s 
ability to continue in business, and such 
other matters as justice may require. 
EPA recognizes that it may be 
appropriate, should a manufacturer fail 
to comply with the NHTSA fuel 
economy standards as well as the CO2 
standard proposed today in a case 
arising out of the same facts and 
circumstances, to take into account the 
civil penalties that NHTSA has assessed 
for violations of the CAFE standards 
when determining the appropriate 
penalty amount for violations of the CO2 
emissions standards. This approach is 
consistent with EPA’s broad discretion 
to consider ‘‘such other matters as 
justice may require,’’ and will allow 
EPA to exercise its discretion to prevent 
injustice and ensure that penalties for 
violations of the CO2 rule are assessed 
in a fair and reasonable manner. 
The statutory penalty factor that 
allows EPA to consider ‘‘such other 
matters as justice may require’’ vests 
EPA with broad discretion to reduce the 
penalty when other adjustment factors 
prove insufficient or inappropriate to 
achieve justice.177 The underlying 
principle of this penalty factor is to 
operate as a safety mechanism when 
necessary to prevent injustice.178 
In other environmental statutes, 
Congress has specifically required EPA 
to consider penalties assessed by other 
government agencies where violations 
arise from the same set of facts. For 
instance, section 311(b)(8) of the Clean 
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(8) 
authorizes EPA to consider any other 
penalty for the same incident when 
determining the appropriate Clean 
Water Act penalty. Likewise, section 
113(e) of the CAA authorizes EPA to 
consider ‘‘payment by the violator of 
penalties previously assessed for the 
same violation’’ when assessing 
penalties for certain violations of Title 
I of the Act. 
7. Prohibited Acts in the CAA 
Section 203 of the Clean Air Act 
describes acts that are prohibited by 
law. This section and associated 
regulations apply equally to the 
greenhouse standards proposed today as 
to any other regulated pollutant. 
8. Other Certification Issues 
a. Carryover/Carry Across Certification 
Test Data 
EPA’s certification program for 
vehicles allows manufacturers to carry 
certification test data over and across 
certification testing from one model year 
to the next, when no significant changes 
to models are made. EPA expects that 
this policy could also apply to CO2, N2O 
and CH4 certification test data. A 
manufacturer may also be eligible to use 
carryover and carry across data to 
demonstrate CO2 fleet average 
compliance if they had done so for 
CAFE purposes. 
b. Compliance Fees 
The CAA allows EPA to collect fees 
to cover the costs of issuing certificates 
of conformity for the classes of vehicles 
and engines covered by this proposal. 
On May 11, 2004, EPA updated its fees 
regulation based on a study of the costs 
associated with its motor vehicle and 
engine compliance program (69 FR 
51402). At the time that cost study was 
conducted the current rulemaking was 
not considered. 
At this time the extent of any added 
costs to EPA as a result of this proposal 
is not known. EPA will assess its 
compliance testing and other activities 
associated with the proposed rule and 
may amend its fees regulations in the 
future to include any warranted new 
costs. 
c. Small Entity Deferment 
EPA is proposing to defer CO2 
standards for certain small entities, and 
these entities (necessarily) would not be 
subject to the certification requirements 
of this proposal. 
As discussed in Section III.B.7, 
businesses meeting the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) criterion of a 
small business as described in 13 CFR 
121.201 would not be subject to the 
proposed GHG requirements, pending 
future regulatory action. EPA is 
proposing that such entities submit a 
declaration to EPA containing a detailed 
written description of how that 
manufacturer qualifies as a small entity 
under the provisions of 13 CFR 121.201 
in order to ensure EPA is aware of the 
deferred companies. This declaration 
would have to be signed by a chief 
officer of the company, and would have 
to be made at least 30 days prior to the 
introduction into commerce of any 
vehicles for each model year for which 
the small entity status is requested, but 
not later than December of the calendar 
year prior to the model year for which 
deferral is requested. For example, if a 
manufacturer will be introducing model 
year 2012 vehicles in October of 2011, 
then the small entity declaration would 
be due in September of 2011. If 2012 
model year vehicles are not planned for 
introduction until March of 2012, then 
the declaration would have to be 
submitted in December of 2011. Such 
entities are not automatically exempted 
from other EPA regulations for light- 
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks; 
therefore, absent this annual declaration 
EPA would assume that each entity was 
not deferred from compliance with the 
proposed greenhouse gas standards. 
d. Onboard Diagnostics (OBD) and CO2 
Regulations 
The light-duty on-board diagnostics 
(OBD) regulations require manufacturers 
to detect and identify malfunctions in 
all monitored emission-related 
powertrain systems or components.179 
Specifically, the OBD system is required 
to monitor catalysts, oxygen sensors, 
engine misfire, evaporative system 
leaks, and any other emission control 
systems directly intended to control 
emissions, such as exhaust gas 
recirculation (EGR), secondary air, and 
fuel control systems. The monitoring 
threshold for all of these systems or 
components is 1.5 times the applicable 
standards, which typically include 
NMHC, CO, NOX, and PM. EPA is 
confident that many of the emission- 
related systems and components 
currently monitored would effectively 
catch any malfunctions related to CO2 
emissions. For example, malfunctions 
resulting from engine misfire, oxygen 
sensors, the EGR system, the secondary 
air system, and the fuel control system 
would all have an impact on CO2 
emissions. Thus, repairs made to any of 
these systems or components should 
also result in an improvement in CO2 
emissions. In addition, EPA does not 
have data on the feasibility or 
effectiveness of monitoring various 
emission systems and components for 
CO2 emissions and does not believe it 
would be prudent to include CO2 
emissions without such information. 
Therefore, at this time, EPA does not 
plan to require CO2 emissions as one of 
the applicable standards required for the 
OBD monitoring threshold. EPA plans 
to evaluate OBD monitoring technology, 
with regard to monitoring CO2 
emissions-related systems and 
components, and may choose to propose 
to include CO2 emissions as part of the 
OBD requirements in a future regulatory

action. EPA requests comment as to 
whether this is appropriate at this time, 
and specifically requests any data that 
would support the need for CO2-related 
components that could or should be 
monitored via an OBD system. 
e. Applicability of Current High 
Altitude Provisions to Greenhouse 
Gases 
EPA is proposing that vehicles 
covered by this proposal meet the CO2, 
N2O and CH4 standard at altitude. The 
CAA requires emission standards under 
section 202 to apply at all altitudes.180 
EPA does not expect vehicle CO2, CH4, 
or N2O emissions to be significantly 
different at high altitudes based on 
vehicle calibrations commonly used at 
all altitudes. Therefore, EPA is 
proposing to retain its current high 
altitude regulations so manufacturers 
would not normally be required to 
submit vehicle CO2 test data for high 
altitude. Instead, they would submit an 
engineering evaluation indicating that 
common calibration approaches will be 
utilized at high altitude. Any deviation 
in emission control practices employed 
only at altitude would need to be 
included in the auxiliary emission 
control device (AECD) descriptions 
submitted by manufacturers at 
certification. In addition, any AECD 
specific to high altitude would be 
required to include emissions data to 
allow EPA evaluate and quantify any 
emission impact and validity of the 
AECD. EPA requests comment on this 
approach, and specifically requests data 
on impact of altitude on FTP and HFET 
CO2 emissions. 
f. Applicability of Standards to 
Aftermarket Conversions 
With the exception of the small entity 
deferment option EPA is proposing, 
EPA’s emission standards, including the 
proposed greenhouse gas standards, 
would continue to apply as stated in the 
applicability sections of the relevant 
regulations. The proposed greenhouse 
gas standards are being incorporated 
into 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, the 
provisions of which include exhaust 
and evaporative emission standards for 
criteria pollutants. Subpart S includes 
requirements for new light-duty 
vehicles, light-duty trucks, medium- 
duty passenger vehicles, Otto-cycle 
complete heavy-duty vehicles, and some 
incomplete light-duty trucks. Subpart S 
is currently specifically applicable to 
aftermarket conversion systems, 
aftermarket conversion installers, and 
aftermarket conversion certifiers, as 
those terms are defined in 40 CFR 
85.502. EPA expects that some 
aftermarket conversion companies 
would qualify for and seek the small 
entity deferment, but those that do not 
qualify would be required to meet the 
applicable emission standards, 
including the proposed greenhouse gas 
standards. 
9. Miscellaneous Revisions to Existing 
Regulations 
a. Revisions and Additions to 
Definitions 
EPA is proposing to amend its 
definitions of ‘‘engine code,’’ 
‘‘transmission class,’’ and ‘‘transmission 
configuration’’ in its vehicle 
certification regulations (Part 86) to 
conform with the definitions for those 
terms in its fuel economy regulations 
(Part 600). The exact terms in Part 86 are 
used for reporting purposes and are not 
used for any compliance purpose (e.g., 
an engine code would not determine 
which vehicle was selected for emission 
testing). However, the terms are used for 
this purpose in Part 600 (e.g., engine 
codes, transmission class, and 
transmission configurations are all 
criteria used to determine which 
vehicles are to be tested for the purposes 
of establishing corporate average fuel 
economy). Here, EPA is proposing that 
the same vehicles tested to determine 
corporate average fuel economy also be 
tested to determine fleet average CO2, so 
the same definitions should apply. Thus 
EPA is proposing to amend its Part 86 
definitions of the above terms to 
conform to the definitions in Part 600. 
To bring EPA’s fuel economy 
regulations in Part 600 into conformity 
with this proposal for fleet average CO2 
and NHTSA’s reform truck regulations 
two amendments are proposed. First, 
the definition of ‘‘footprint’’ that is 
proposed in this rule is also being 
proposed for addition to EPA’s Part 86 
and 600 regulations. This definition is 
based on the definition promulgated by 
NHTSA at 49 CFR 523.2. Second, EPA 
is proposing to amend its model year 
CAFE reporting regulations to include 
the footprint information necessary for 
EPA to determine the reformed truck 
standards and the corporate average fuel 
economy. This same information is 
proposed to be included in this proposal 
for fleet average CO2 and fuel economy 
compliance. 
b. Addition of Ethanol Fuel Economy 
Calculation Procedures 
EPA is proposing to add calculation 
procedures to part 600 for determining 
the carbon-related exhaust emissions 
and calculating the fuel economy of 
vehicles operating on ethanol fuel. 
Manufacturers have been using these 
procedures as needed, but the regulatory 
language—which specifies how to 
determine the fuel economy of gasoline, 
diesel, compressed natural gas, and 
methanol fueled vehicles—has not 
previously been brought up-to-date to 
provide procedures for vehicles 
operating on ethanol. Thus EPA is 
proposing a carbon balance approach 
similar to other fuels for the 
determination of carbon-related exhaust 
emissions for the purpose of 
determining fuel economy and for 
compliance with the proposed fleet 
average CO2 standards. The carbon 
balance formula is similar to that for 
methanol, except that ethanol-fueled 
vehicles must also measure the 
emissions of ethanol and acetaldehyde. 
The proposed carbon balance equation 
for determining fuel economy is as 
follows, where CWF is the carbon 
weight fraction of the fuel and CWFexHC 
is the carbon weight fraction of the 
exhaust hydrocarbons: 
mpg = (CWF × SG × 3781.8)/((CWFexHC× HC) 
+ (0.429 × CO) + (0.273 × CO2) + (0.375 
× CH3OH) + (0.400 × HCHO) + (0.521 × 
C2H5OH) + (0.545 × C2H4O)) 
The proposed equation for 
determining the total carbon-related 
exhaust emissions for compliance with 
the CO2 fleet average standards is the 
following, where CWFexHC is the carbon 
weight fraction of the exhaust 
hydrocarbons: 
CO2-eq = (CWFexHC× HC) + (0.429 × CO) + 
(0.375 × CH3OH) + (0.400 × HCHO) + 
(0.521 × C2H5OH) + (0.545 × C2H4O) + 
CO2. 
EPA requests comment on the use of 
these formulae to determine fuel 
economy and carbon emissions. 
c. Revision of Electric Vehicle 
Applicability Provisions 
In 1980 EPA issued a rule that 
provided for the inclusion of electric 
vehicles in the CAFE program.181 EPA 
now believes that certain provisions of 
the regulations should be updated to 
reflect the current state of motor vehicle 
emission and fuel economy regulations. 
In particular, EPA believes that the 
exemption of electric vehicles in certain 
cases from fuel economy labeling and 
CAFE requirements should be 
reevaluated and revised. 
The rule created an exemption for 
electric vehicles from fuel economy 
labeling in the following cases: (1) If the 
electric vehicles are produced by a 
company that produces only electric 
vehicles; and (2) if the electric vehicles 
are produced by a company that

183 ‘‘Fuel economy’’ per the statute is miles per 
gallon of gasoline (or equivalent amount of other 
fuel). 
produces fewer than 10,000 vehicles of 
all kinds worldwide. EPA believes that 
this exemption language is no longer 
appropriate and proposes to delete it 
from the affected regulations. First, 
since 1980 many regulatory provisions 
have been put in place to address the 
concerns of small manufacturers and 
enable them to comply with fuel 
economy and emission programs with 
reduced burden. EPA believes that all 
small volume manufacturers should 
compete on a fair and level regulatory 
playing field and that there is no longer 
a need to treat small volume electric 
vehicles any differently than small 
volume manufacturers of other types of 
vehicles. Current regulations contain 
streamlined certification procedures for 
small companies, and because electric 
vehicles emit no direct pollution there 
is effectively no certification emission 
testing burden. For example, the 
proposed greenhouse gas regulations 
contain a provision allowing the 
exemption of certain small entities. 
Meeting the requirements for fuel 
economy labeling and CAFE will entail 
a testing, reporting, and labeling burden, 
but these burdens are not extraordinary 
and should be applied equally to all 
small volume manufacturers, regardless 
of the fuel that moves their vehicles. 
EPA has been working with existing 
electric vehicle manufacturers on fuel 
economy labeling, and EPA believes it 
is important for the consumer to have 
impartial, accurate, and useful label 
information regarding the energy 
consumption of these vehicles. Second, 
EPCA does not provide for an 
exemption of electric vehicles from 
NHTSA’s CAFE program, and NHTSA 
regulations regarding the applicability 
of the CAFE program do not provide an 
exemption for electric vehicles. Third, 
the blanket exemption for any 
manufacturer of only electric vehicles 
assumed at the time that these 
companies would all be small, but the 
exemption language inappropriately did 
not account for size and would allow 
large manufacturers to be exempt as 
well. Finally, because of growth 
expected in the electric vehicle market 
in the future, EPA believes that the 
labeling and CAFE regulations need to 
be designed to more specifically 
accommodate electric vehicles and to 
require that consumers be provided 
with appropriate information regarding 
these vehicles. For these reasons EPA is 
proposing revisions to 40 CFR Part 600 
applicability regulations such that these 
electric vehicle exemptions are deleted 
starting with the 2012 model year. 
d. Miscellaneous Conforming 
Regulatory Amendments 
Throughout the regulations EPA has 
made a number of minor amendments to 
update the regulations as needed or to 
conform with amendments discussed in 
this preamble. For example, for 
consistency with the ethanol fuel 
economy calculation procedures 
discussed above, EPA has amended 
regulations where necessary to require 
the collection of emissions of ethanol 
and acetaldehyde. Other changes are 
made to applicability sections to remove 
obsolete regulatory requirements such 
as phase-ins related to EPA’s Tier 2 
emission standards program, and still 
other changes are made to better 
accommodate electric vehicles in EPA 
emission control regulations. Not all of 
these minor amendments are noted in 
this preamble, thus the reader should 
carefully evaluate the proposed 
regulatory text to ensure a complete 
understanding of the regulatory changes 
being proposed by EPA. 
10. Warranty, Defect Reporting, and 
Other Emission-Related Components 
Provisions 
Under section 207(a) of the CAA, 
manufacturers must warrant that a 
vehicle is designed to comply with the 
standards and will be free from defects 
that may cause it to not comply over the 
specified period which is 2 years/24,000 
miles (whichever is first) or, for major 
emission control components, 8 years/ 
80,000 miles. Under certain conditions, 
manufacturers may be liable to replace 
failed emission components at no 
expense to the owner. EPA regulations 
define ‘‘emission related parts’’ for the 
purpose of warranty. This definition 
includes parts which must function 
properly to assure continued 
compliance with the emission 
standards.182 
The air conditioning system and its 
components have not previously been 
covered under the CAA warranty 
provisions. However, the proposed A/C 
leakage and A/C-related CO2 emission 
standards are dependent upon the 
proper functioning of a number of 
components on the A/C system, such as 
rings, fittings, compressors, and hoses. 
Therefore, EPA is proposing that these 
components be included under the CAA 
section 207(a) emission warranty 
provisions, with a warranty of 2 years/ 
24,000 miles. 
EPA requests comment as to whether 
any other parts or components should 
be designated as ‘‘emission related 
parts’’ subject to warranty and defect 
reporting provisions under this 
proposal. 
11. Light Duty Vehicles and Fuel 
Economy Labeling 
American consumers need accurate 
and meaningful information about the 
environmental and fuel economy 
performance of new light vehicles. EPA 
believes it is important that the fuel- 
economy label affixed to the new 
vehicles provide consumers with the 
critical information they need to make 
smart purchase decisions. This is a 
special challenge in light of the 
expected increase in market share of 
electric and other advanced technology 
vehicles. Consumers may need new and 
different information than today’s 
vehicle labels provide in order to help 
them understand the energy use and 
associated cost of owning these electric 
and advanced technology vehicles. As 
discussed below, these two issues are 
key to determining whether the current 
MPG-based fuel-economy label is 
adequate. 
Therefore, as part of this action, EPA 
seeks comments on issues surrounding 
consumer vehicle labeling in general, 
and labeling of advanced technology 
vehicles in particular. EPA also plans to 
initiate a separate rulemaking to explore 
in detail the information displayed on 
the fuel economy label and the 
methodology for deriving that 
information. The purposes of this new 
rulemaking would be to ensure that 
American consumers continue to have 
the most accurate, meaningful, and 
useful information available to them 
when purchasing new vehicles, and that 
the information is presented to them in 
clear and understandable terms. 
a. Background 
EPA has considerable experience in 
providing vehicle information to 
consumers through its fuel-economy 
labeling activities and related web-based 
programs. Under 49 U.S.C. 32908(b) 
EPA is responsible for developing the 
fuel economy labels that are posted on 
window stickers of all new light duty 
cars and trucks sold in the U.S. and, 
beginning with the 2011 model year, on 
all new medium-duty passenger 
vehicles (a category that includes large 
sport-utility vehicles and passenger 
vans). The statutory requirements 
established by EPCA require that the 
label contain the following: 
• The fuel economy of the vehicle; 183 
• The estimated annual fuel cost of 
operating the vehicle;

manufacturers; 
• A statement that a fuel economy 
booklet is available from the dealer; 184 
and 
• The amount of the ‘‘gas guzzler’’ tax 
imposed on the vehicle by the Internal 
Revenue Service. 
• Other information required or 
authorized by EPA that is related to the 
information required above. 
Fuel economy is defined as the 
number of miles traveled by an 
automobile for each gallon of gasoline 
(or equivalent amount of other fuel). It 
is relatively easy to determine the miles 
per gallon (MPG) for vehicles that use 
liquid fuels (e.g., gasoline or diesel), but 
an expression that uses gallons— 
whether miles per gallon or gallons per 
mile—may not be a useful metric for 
vehicles that have limited to no 
operation on liquid fuel such as electric 
or compressed natural gas vehicles. The 
mpg metric is the one generally used 
today to provide comparative fuel 
economy information to consumers. 
As part of its vehicle certification, 
CAFE, and fuel economy labeling 
authorities, EPA works with 
stakeholders on the testing and other 
regulatory requirements necessary to 
bring advanced technology vehicles to 
market. With increasing numbers of 
advanced technology vehicles beginning 
to be sold, EPA believes it is now 
appropriate to address potential 
regulatory and certification issues 
associated with these technologies 
including how best to provide relevant 
consumer information about their 
environmental impact, energy 
consumption, and cost. 
b. Test Procedures 
As discussed in this notice, there are 
explicit and very long-standing test 
procedures and calculation 
methodologies associated with CAFE 
that EPA uses to test conventionally- 
fueled vehicles and to calculate their 
fuel economy. These test procedures 
and calculations also generally apply to 
advanced technology vehicles (e.g., an 
electric (EV) or plug-in hybrid vehicle 
(PHEV)). 
The basic test procedure for an 
electric vehicle follows a standardized 
practice—an EV is fully charged and 
then driven over the city cycle (Urban 
Dynamometer Drive Schedule) until the 
vehicle can no longer maintain the 
required drive cycle vehicle speed. For 
some vehicles, this could require 
operation over multiple drive cycles. 
The EV is then fully recharged and the 
AC energy to the charger is recorded. 
To derive the CAFE value for electric 
vehicles, the amount of AC energy 
needed to recharge the battery is 
divided by the range the vehicle reached 
in the repeated city drive cycle. This 
calculation provides a raw CAFE energy 
consumption value expressed in 
kilowatt hours per 100 miles. The raw 
CAFE number is then converted to miles 
per gallon of equivalent gasoline using 
a Department of Energy (DOE) 
conversion factor of 82,700 Kwhr/gallon 
of gasoline.185 The DOE conversion 
factor combines several adjustments 
including: an adjustment similar to the 
statutory 6.67 multiplier credit 186 used 
in deriving the final CAFE value for 
alternative fueled vehicles; a factor 
representing the gasoline-equivalent 
energy content of electricity; and 
various adjustments to account for the 
relative efficiency of producing and 
transporting the electricity. The 
resulting value after the DOE conversion 
factor is applied becomes the final 
CAFE city value. 
The label value calculation for an EV 
uses a different conversion factor than 
the CAFE value calculation. To come up 
with the final city fuel economy label 
value for an EV, a conversion factor of 
33,705 Kwhr/gallon of gasoline 
equivalent is applied to the raw 
consumption number instead of the 
82,700 Kwhr/gallon used for CAFE. The 
conversion factor used for labeling 
purposes represents only the gasoline- 
equivalent energy content of electricity, 
without the multiplier credit and other 
adjustments used in the CAFE 
calculation. The consumption, now 
expressed as a fuel economy in miles 
per gallon equivalent, is then applied to 
the derived 5-cycle equation required 
under EPA’s fuel economy labeling 
regulations. The above process is then 
repeated for the EV highway fuel 
economy label number. Finally, the 
combined city/highway numbers for the 
EV use the same 55/45 weighting as 
conventional vehicles to determine the 
final fuel economy label values. CAFE 
numbers end up being significantly 
higher for EVs than the associated fuel 
economy label values, both because a 
higher adjustment factor applies under 
CAFE regulations and also because 
other real-world adjustments such as the 
5-cycle test are not applied to the CAFE 
values. 
For PHEVs, a similar process would 
be followed, except that PHEVs require 
testing in both charge sustain (CS) and 
charge depleting (CD) modes to capture 
how these vehicles operate. For charge 
sustain modes, PHEVs essentially 
operate as conventional Hybrid Electric 
Vehicles (HEVs). PHEVs therefore test in 
all 5-cycles (for further information on 
these test cycles, see Section III.C.4) just 
as HEVs do for CS fuel economy. For CD 
fuel economy, PHEVs are only required 
to test on the Urban Dynamometer Drive 
Schedule and Highway Fuel Economy 
cycles just like other alternative fueled 
vehicles—the 5-cycle fuel economy 
testing is optional in the CD mode. 
There are additional processes that 
address different PHEV modes, such as 
for PHEVs that operate solely on 
electricity throughout the CD mode. 
As this discussion shows, the CAFE 
and fuel economy labeling test 
procedures and calculations for 
advanced technology vehicles such as 
EVs and PHEVs can be very 
complicated. EPA is interested in 
comments on these processes, including 
views on the appropriate use of 
adjustment factors. Currently in 
guidance, EPA references SAE J1634 for 
EV range and consumption test 
procedures. EPA currently includes the 
‘‘California Exhaust Emission Standards 
and Test Procedures for 2003 and 
Subsequent Model Zero-Emission 
Vehicles, in the Passenger Car, Light 
Truck, and Medium-duty Vehicle 
Classes’’ by reference in 40 CFR 86.1. As 
California requirements and SAE test 
procedures are updated these may be 
included by reference in the future. 
c. Current Fuel Economy Label 
In 2006 EPA redesigned the window 
stickers to make them more informative 
for consumers. More particular, the 
redesigned stickers more prominently 
feature annual fuel cost information, to 
provide contemporary and easy-to-use 
graphics for comparing the fuel 
economy of different vehicles, to use 
clearer text, and to include a Web site 
reference to www.fueleconomy.gov 
which provides additional information. 
In addition, EPA updated how the city 
and highway fuel economy values were 
calculated, to reflect typical real-world 
driving patterns.187 This rulemaking 
involved significant stakeholder 
outreach in determining how best to 
calculate and display this new 
information. The feedback EPA has 
received to date on the new label design 
and values has been generally very 
positive. 
During the 2006 label rulemaking 
process EPA requested comments on

49578 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
how a fuel consumption metric (such as 
gallons per 100 miles) could be used 
and represented to the public, including 
presentation in the annual Fuel 
Economy Guide. EPA received a number 
of comments from both vehicle 
manufacturers and consumer 
organizations, suggesting that the MPG 
measures can be misleading and that a 
fuel consumption metric might be more 
meaningful to consumers than the 
established MPG metric found on fuel 
economy labels. The reason is that fuel 
consumption metric, directly measures 
the amount of fuel used and is thus 
directly related to cost that consumers 
incur when filling up. 
The problem with the MPG metric is 
that it is inversely related to fuel 
consumption and cost. As higher MPG 
values are reached, the relative impact 
of these higher values on fuel 
consumption and fuel costs decreases. 
For example, a 25 percent increase in 
gallons per 100 miles will always lead 
to a 25 percent increase in the fuel cost, 
but a similar 25 percent increase in 
MPG will have varying impacts on 
actual fuel cost depending on whether 
the percent increase occurs to a low or 
high MPG value. Many consumers do 
not understand this nonlinear 
relationship between MPG and fuel 
costs. Evidence suggest that people tend 
to see the MPG as being linear with fuel 
cost, which will lead to erroneous 
decisions regarding vehicle purchases. 
Figure III.E.11–1 below illustrates the 
issue; one can see that changes in MPG 
at low MPG levels can result in large 
changes in the fuel cost, while changes 
in MPG values at high MPG levels result 
in small changes in the fuel cost. For 
example, a change from 10 to 15 MPG 
will reduce the 10-mile fuel cost from 
$2.50 to $1.60, but a similar increase in 
MPG from 20 to 25 MPG will only 
reduce the 10-mile fuel cost by less than 
$0.30.

49579 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Because of the potential for 
consumers to misunderstand this MPG/ 
cost relationship, commenters on the 
2006 labeling rule universally agreed 
that any change to the label metric 
should involve a significant public 
education campaign directed toward 
both dealers and consumers. 
In 2006, EPA did not include a 
consumption-based metric on the 
redesigned fuel economy label in 2006. 
It was concerned about potential 
confusion associated with introducing a 
second metric on the label (MPG is a 
required element, as noted above). EPA 
has developed an interactive feature on 
www.fueleconomy.gov which allows 
consumers, while viewing data on a 
specific vehicle, to switch units between 
the MPG and gallons per 100 miles 
metrics. The tool also displays the cost 
and the amount of fuel needed to drive 
25 miles. As indicated above, however, 
EPA is alert to the problems with the 
MPG measure and the importance of 
providing consumers with a clear sense

of the consequences of their purchasing 
decisions; a gallon-per mile measure 
would have significant advantages. EPA 
plans to seek comment and engage in 
extensive public debate about fuel 
consumption and other appropriate 
consumer information metrics as part of 
a new labeling rule initiative. EPA also 
welcomes comments on this topic in 
response to this GHG proposal. 
d. Labeling for Advanced Technology 
Vehicles 
Even though a fuel consumption 
metric may more directly represent 
likely fuel costs than a fuel economy 
metric, any expression that uses 
gallons—whether miles per gallon or 
gallons per mile—is not a useful metric 
for vehicles that have limited to no 
operation on liquid fuel (e.g., electricity 
or compressed natural gas). For 
example, PHEVs and extended range 
electric vehicles (EREVs) can use two 
types of energy sources: (1) An onboard 
battery, charged by plugging the vehicle 
into the electrical grid via a 
conventional wall outlet, to power an 
electric motor, as well as (2) a gas or 
diesel-powered engine to propel the 
vehicle or power a generator used to 
provide electricity to the electric motor. 
Depending on how these vehicles are 
operated, they can use electricity 
exclusively, never use electricity and 
operate like a conventional hybrid, or 
operate in some combination of these 
two modes. The use of a MPG figure 
alone would not account for the 
electricity used to propel the vehicle. 
EPA has worked closely with 
numerous stakeholders including 
vehicle manufacturers, the Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE), the State 
of California, the Department of Energy 
(DOE) and others to develop possible 
approaches for both estimating fuel 
economy and labeling vehicles that can 
operate using more than one energy 
source. At the present time, EPA 
believes the appropriate method for 
estimating fuel economy of PHEVs and 
EREVs would be a weighted average of 
fuel economy for the two modes of 
operation. A methodology developed by 
SAE and DOE to predict the fractions of 
total distance driven in each mode of 
operation (electricity and gas) uses a 
term known as a utility factor (UF). By 
using a utility factor, it is possible to 
determine a weighted average for fuel 
economy of the electric and gasoline 
modes. For example, a UF of 0.8 would 
indicate that a PHEV or EREV operates 
in an all electric mode 80% of the time 
and uses the gasoline engine the other 
20% of the time. In this example, the 
weighted average fuel economy value 
would be influenced more by the 
electrical operation than the gasoline 
operation. 
Under this approach, a UF could be 
assigned to each successive fuel 
economy test until the battery charge 
was depleted and the PHEV or EREV 
needed power from the gasoline engine 
to propel the vehicle or to recharge the 
battery. One minus the sum of all the 
utility factors would then represent the 
fraction of driving performed in this 
‘‘gasoline mode.’’ Fuel economy could 
then be expressed as: 
FE
UF
FE
UF
FE
MPG
i
i
i
gasoline
=
+
− ∑∑
1
1
Likewise, the electrical consumption 
would be expressed by adding the fuel 
consumption from each mode. Since 
there is no electrical consumption in 
hybrid mode, the equation for electricity 
consumption would be as follows: 
Utility factors could be cycle specific 
not only due to different battery ranges 
on different test cycles but also due to 
the fact that ‘‘highway’’ type driving 
may imply longer trips than urban 
driving. That is to say that the average 
city trip could be shorter than the 
average highway trip. 
e. Request for Comments 
EPA is interested in comments on 
both topics raised in this section. For 
the methodology, we are interested in 
comments addressing how the utility 
factor is calculated and which data 
should be used in establishing the UF. 
Additionally, commenters should 
address: The appropriateness of this 
approach for estimating fuel economy 
for PHEVs and EREVs, including the 
concept of using a UF to determine the 
fuel economy for vehicles operated in 
multiple modes; the appropriate form 
and value of the factor, including the 
type of data that would be necessary to 
confidently develop it accurately; and 
availability of other potential 
methodologies for determining fuel 
economy for vehicles that can operate in 
multiple modes, such as ‘‘all electric’’ 
and ‘‘hybrid,’’ including the use of fuel 
consumption, cost, GHG emissions, or 
other metrics in addition to miles per 
gallon. 
EPA is also requesting comment on 
how the agency can satisfy statutory 
labeling requirements while providing 
relevant information to consumers. For 
example, the statute indicates that EPA 
may provide other related items on the 
label beyond those that are required.188 
EPA is interested in receiving comments 
on the potential approaches and 
supporting data we might consider for 
adding additional information regarding 
fuel economics while maintaining our 
statutory obligation to report MPG on 
the label. 
There are a number of different 
metrics that are available that could be 
useful in this regard. Two possible 
options would be to show consumption 
in fuel use per distance (e.g., gallons/ 
100 miles) or in cost per distance (e.g., 
$/100 miles). As discussed above, these 
two metrics have benefits over a straight 
mpg value in showing a more direct 
relationship between fuel consumption 
and cost. The cost/distance metric has 
an added potential benefit of providing 
a common basis for comparing 
differently fueled or powered vehicles, 
for example being able to show the cost 
of gasoline used over a specified 
distance or time for a conventional 
gasoline-powered vehicle in comparison 
to the gasoline and electricity used over 
the same period for a plug-in hybrid 
vehicle. Another approach would be to 
use a metric that provides information 
about a vehicle’s greenhouse gas 
emissions per unit of travel, such as 
carbon dioxide equivalent grams per 
mile (g CO2e/mi). This type of metric 
would allow consumers to directly 
compare among vehicles on the basis of 
their overall greenhouse gas impact. A 
total annual energy cost would be 
another way to look at this information, 
and is currently used on the fuel 
economy label. As is currently done, 
EPA would need to determine and show 
a common set of fuel costs used to 
calculate such values, recognizing that 
energy costs vary across the country. 
The Agency is also interested in 
comments on the usefulness of adding 
other types of information, such as an 
estimated driving range for electric 
vehicles. The label design is also an 
important issue to consider and any 
changes to the existing label would need 
to show information in a technologically 
accurate, meaningful and 
understandable manner, while ensuring 
that the label does not become 
overcrowded and difficult for 
consumers to comprehend. EPA is also 
interested in what and how other 
information paths, such as web-based 
programs, could be used to enhance the 
consumer education process.

189 U.S. EPA (2009). ‘‘EPA Analysis of the 
American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009: 
H.R. 2454 in the 111th Congress.’’ U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC, 
USA. (www.epa.gov/climatechange/economics/ 
economicanalyses.html) 
190 This analysis does not include the EISA 
requirement for 35 MPG through 2020 or 
California’s Pavley 1 GHG standards. The proposed 
standards are intended to supersede these 
requirements, and the baseline case for comparison 
is the emissions that would result without further 
action above the currently promulgated fuel 
economy standards. 
F. How Would This Proposal Reduce 
GHG Emissions and Their Associated 
Effects? 
This action is an important step 
towards curbing steady growth of GHG 
emissions from cars and light trucks. In 
the absence of control, GHG emissions 
worldwide and in the U.S. are projected 
to continue steady growth; Table 
III.F–1 shows emissions of CO2, 
methane, nitrous oxide and air 
conditioning refrigerants on a CO2- 
equivalent basis for calendar years 2010, 
2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. U.S. GHGs 
are estimated to make up roughly 15 
percent of total worldwide emissions, 
and the contribution of direct emissions 
from cars and light trucks to this U.S. 
share is growing over time, reaching an 
estimated 20 percent of U.S. emissions 
by 2030 in the absence of control. As 
discussed later in this section, this 
steady rise in GHG emissions is 
associated with numerous adverse 
impacts on human health, food and 
agriculture, air quality, and water and 
forestry resources.

EPA’s proposed GHG rule, if 
finalized, will result in significant 
reductions as newer, cleaner vehicles 
come into the fleet, and the rule is 
estimated to have a measurable impact 
on world global temperatures. As 
discussed in Section I, this GHG 
proposal is part of a joint National 
Program such that a large majority of the 
projected benefits would be achieved 
jointly with NHTSA’s proposed CAFE 
standards which are described in detail 
in Section IV of this preamble. EPA 
estimates the reductions attributable to 
the GHG program over time assuming 
the proposed 2016 standards continue 
indefinitely post-2016,190 compared to a 
baseline scenario in which the 2011 
model year fuel economy standards 
continue beyond 2011. 
Using this approach, EPA estimates 
these standards would cut annual 
fleetwide car and light truck tailpipe 
CO2 emissions 21 percent by 2030, 
when 90 percent of car and light truck 
miles will be travelled by vehicles 
meeting the new standards. Roughly 20 
percent of these reductions are due to 
emission reductions from gasoline 
extraction, production and distribution 
processes as a result of reduced gasoline 
demand associated with this proposal. 
Some of the overall emission reductions 
also come from projected improvements 
in the efficiency of vehicle air 
conditioning systems, which will 
substantially reduce direct emissions of 
HFCs, one of the most potent 
greenhouse gases, as well as indirect 
emissions of tailpipe CO2 emissions 
attributable to reduced engine load from 
air conditioning. In total, EPA estimates 
that compared to a baseline of indefinite 
2011 model year standards, net GHG 
emission reductions from the proposed 
program would be 325 million metric 
tons CO2-equivalent (MMTCO2eq) 
annually by 2030, which represents a 
reduction of 4 percent of total U.S. GHG 
emissions and 0.6 percent of total 
worldwide GHG emissions projected in 
that year. This estimate accounts for all 
upstream fuel production and 
distribution emission reductions, 
vehicle tailpipe emission reductions 
including air conditioning benefits, as 
well as increased vehicle miles travelled 
(VMT) due to the ‘‘rebound’’ effect 
discussed in Section III.H. EPA 
estimates this would be the equivalent 
of removing nearly 60 million cars and 
light trucks from the road in this 
timeframe. 
EPA projects the total reduction of the 
program over the full life of model year 
2012–2016 vehicles is about 950 
MMTCO2eq, with fuel savings of 76 
billion gallons (1.8 billion barrels) of 
gasoline over the life of these vehicles, 
assuming that some manufacturers take 
advantage of low-cost HFC reduction 
strategies to help meet these proposed 
standards. 
These reductions are projected to 
reduce global mean temperature by 
approximately 0.007–0.016°C by 2100, 
and global mean sea level rise is 
projected to be reduced by 
approximately 0.06–0.15 cm by 2100. 
1. Impact on GHG Emissions 
a. Calendar Year Reductions Due to 
GHG Standards 
This action, if finalized, will reduce 
GHG emissions emitted directly from 
vehicles due to reduced fuel use and 
more efficient air conditioning systems. 
In addition to these ‘‘downstream’’ 
emissions, reducing CO2 emissions 
translates directly to reductions in the 
emissions associated with the processes 
involved in getting petroleum to the 
pump, including the extraction and 
transportation of crude oil, and the 
production and distribution of finished 
gasoline (termed ‘‘upstream’’ 
emissions). Reductions from tailpipe 
GHG standards grow over time as the 
fleet turns over to vehicles affected by 
the standards, meaning the benefit of 
the program will continue as long as the 
oldest vehicles in the fleet are replaced 
by newer, lower CO2 emitting vehicles. 
EPA is not projecting any reductions 
in tailpipe CH4 or N2O emissions as a 
result of these proposed emission caps, 
which are meant to prevent emission 
backsliding and to bring diesel vehicles 
equipped with advanced technology 
aftertreatment into alignment with 
current gasoline vehicle emissions. 
As detailed in the DRIA, EPA 
estimated calendar year tailpipe CO2 
reductions based on pre- and post- 
control CO2 gram per mile levels from 
EPA’s OMEGA model and assumed to 
continue indefinitely into the future, 
coupled with VMT projections from 
AEO2009. These estimates reflect the 
real-world CO2 emissions reductions 
projected for the entire U.S. vehicle fleet 
in a specified calendar year, including 
the projected effect of air conditioning 
credits, TLAASP credits and FFV 
credits. EPA also estimated full lifetime 
reductions for model years 2012–2016

191 As detailed in the DRIA, for this analysis the 
full life of the vehicle is represented by average 
lifetime mileages for cars (190,000 miles) and trucks 
(221,000 miles) averaged over calendar years 2012 
through 2030, a function of how far vehicles drive 
per year and scrappage rates. 
using pre- and post-control CO2 levels 
projected by the OMEGA model, 
coupled with projected vehicle sales 
and lifetime mileage estimates. These 
estimates reflect the real-world CO2 
emissions reductions projected for 
model years 2012 through 2016 vehicles 
over their entire life. 
This proposal would allow 
manufacturers to earn credits for 
improved vehicle air conditioning 
efficiency. Since these improvements 
are relatively low cost, EPA projects that 
manufacturers will take advantage of 
this flexibility, leading to reductions 
from emissions associated with vehicle 
air conditioning systems. As explained 
above, these reductions will come from 
both direct emissions of air conditioning 
refrigerant over the life of the vehicle 
and tailpipe CO2 emissions produced by 
the increased load of the A/C system on 
the engine. In particular, EPA estimates 
that direct emissions of HFCs, one of the 
most potent greenhouse gases, would be 
reduced 40 percent from light-duty 
vehicles when the fleet has turned over 
to more efficient vehicles. The fuel 
savings derived from lower tailpipe CO2 
would also lead to reductions in 
upstream emissions. Our estimated 
reductions from the A/C credits program 
are based on our analysis of how 
manufacturers are expected to take 
advantage of this credit opportunity in 
complying with the CO2 fleetwide 
average tailpipe standards. 
Upstream emission reductions 
associated with the production and 
distribution of fuel were estimated using 
emission factors from DOE’s GREET1.8 
model, with some modifications as 
detailed in the DRIA. These estimates 
include both international and domestic 
emission reductions, since reductions in 
foreign exports of finished gasoline and/ 
or crude would make up a significant 
share of the fuel savings resulting from 
the proposed GHG standards. Thus, 
significant portions of the upstream 
GHG emission reductions will occur 
outside of the U.S.; a breakdown of 
projected international versus domestic 
reductions is included in the DRIA. 
Table III.F.1–1 shows reductions 
estimated from these proposed GHG 
standards assuming a pre-control case of 
2011 MY standards continuing 
indefinitely beyond 2011, and a post- 
control case in which 2016 MY 
standards continue indefinitely beyond 
2016. These reductions are broken down 
by upstream and downstream 
components, including air conditioning 
improvements, and also account for the 
offset from a 10 percent VMT ‘‘rebound’’ 
effect as discussed in Section III.H. 
Including the reductions from upstream 
emissions, total reductions are 
estimated to reach 325 MMTCO2eq 
annually by 2030 (a 21 percent 
reduction in U.S. car and light truck 
emissions), and grow to over 500 
MMTCO2eq in 2050 as cleaner vehicles 
continue to come into the fleet (a 23 
percent reduction in U.S. car and light 
truck emissions).

c. Impacts of VMT Rebound Effect 
As noted above and discussed more 
fully in Section III.H., the effect of fuel 
cost on VMT (‘‘rebound’’) was 
accounted for in our assessment of 
economic and environmental impacts of 
this proposed rule. A 10 percent 
rebound case was used for this analysis, 
meaning that VMT for affected model 
years is modeled as increasing by 10 
percent as much as the increase in fuel 
economy; i.e., a 10 percent increase in 
fuel economy would yield a 1.0 percent 
increase in VMT. Results are shown in 
Table III.F.1–3; using the 10 percent 
rebound rate results in an overall 
emission increase of 26.4 MMTCO2eq 
annually in 2030 (this increase is 
accounted for in the reductions 
presented in Tables III.F.1–1 and III.F.1– 
2). Our estimated changes in CH4 or N2O 
emissions as a result of these proposed 
vehicle GHG standards are attributed 
solely to this rebound effect. 
As discussed in Section III.H, EPA 
will be reassessing the appropriate rate 
of VMT rebound for the final rule. 
Although EPA has not directly 
quantified the GHG emissions effect of 
using a lower rebound rate for this 
analysis, lowering the rebound rate 
would reduce the emission increases in 
Tables III.F.1–1 and III.F.1–2 in 
proportion (i.e., zero rebound equals 
zero emissions effect), and, thus, would 
increase our estimates of emission 
reductions due to these proposed 
standards.

b Upstream rebound impact calculated as upstream total CO2 effect times ratio of downstream tailpipe rebound CO2 effect to downstream tail-
pipe total CO2 effect. 
d. Analysis of Alternatives 
EPA analyzed two alternative 
scenarios, including 4% and 6% annual 
increases in 2 cycle (CAFE) fuel 
economy. In addition to this annual 
increase, EPA assumed that 
manufacturers would use air 
conditioning improvements in identical 
penetrations as in the primary scenario. 
Under these assumptions, EPA expects 
achieved fleetwide average emission 
levels of 254 g/mile CO2 EQ (4%), and 
230 g/mile CO2 EQ (6%) in 2016. 
As in the primary scenario, EPA 
assumed that the fleet complied with 
the standards. For full details on 
modeling assumptions, please refer to 
DRIA Chapter 5.

2. Overview of Climate Change Impacts 
From GHG Emissions 
Once emitted, greenhouse gases 
(GHG) that are the subject of this 
regulation can remain in the atmosphere 
for decades to centuries, meaning that 
(1) their concentrations become well- 
mixed throughout the global atmosphere 
regardless of emission origin, and (2) 
their effects on climate are long lasting. 
Greenhouse gas emissions come mainly 
from the combustion of fossil fuels 
(coal, oil, and gas), with additional 
contributions from the clearing of

transportation sector accounts for a 
portion, 28%, of US GHG emissions.192 
This section provides a broad 
overview of some of the impacts of GHG 
emissions. The best sources of 
information include the major 
assessment reports of both the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) and the U.S. Global 
Change Research Program (USGCRP, 
formerly referred to as the U.S. Climate 
Change Science Program). The IPCC and 
USGCRP assessments base their findings 
on the large body of individual, peer- 
reviewed studies in the literature, and 
then the IPCC and USGCRP assessments 
themselves go through a transparent 
peer-reviewed process. The USGCRP 
reports, where possible, are specific to 
impacts in the U.S. and therefore 
represent the best available syntheses of 
relevant impacts. 
Most recently, the USGCRP released a 
report entitled ‘‘Global Climate Change 
Impacts in the United States’’.193 The 
report summarizes the science and the 
impacts of climate change on the United 
States, now and in the future. It focuses 
on climate change impacts in different 
regions of the U.S. and on various 
aspects of society and the economy such 
as energy, water, agriculture, and 
human health. It’s also a report written 
in plain language, with the goal of better 
informing public and private decision 
making at all levels. The foundation of 
this report is a set of 21 Synthesis and 
Assessment Products (SAPs), which 
were designed to address key policy- 
relevant issues in climate science. The 
report was extensively reviewed and 
revised based on comments from 
experts and the public. The report was 
approved by its lead USGCRP Agency, 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the other USGCRP 
agencies, and the Committee on the 
Environment and Natural Resources on 
behalf of the National Science and 
Technology Council. This report meets 
all Federal requirements associated with 
the Information Quality Act, including 
those pertaining to public comment and 
transparency. Readers are encouraged to 
review this report.

reports in a draft TSD. The draft TSD 
reviews observed and projected changes 
in climate based on current and 
projected atmospheric GHG 
concentrations and emissions, as well as 
the related impacts and risks from 
climate change that are projected in the 
absence of GHG mitigation actions, 
including this proposal and other U.S. 
and global actions. The TSD serves as an 
important support document to EPA’s 
proposed Endangerment Finding; 
however, the document is a draft and is 
still undergoing comment and review as 
part of EPA’s rulemaking process, and is 
subject to change based upon comments 
to the final endangerment finding. 
a. Changes in Atmospheric 
Concentrations of GHGs From Global 
and U.S. Emissions 
Concentrations of six key GHGs 
(carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons 
and sulfur hexafluoride) are at 
unprecedented levels compared to the 
recent and distant past. The global 
atmospheric CO2 concentration has 
increased about 38% from pre-industrial 
levels to 2009, and almost all of the 
increase is due to anthropogenic 
emissions. 
Based on data from the most recent 
Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions and Sinks (2008),195 total 
U.S. GHG emissions increased by 905.9 
teragrams of CO2-equivalent (Tg CO2 
Eq), or 14.7%, between 1990 and 2006. 
U.S. transportation sources subject to 
control under section 202(a) of the 
Clean Air Act (passenger cars, light duty 
trucks, other trucks and buses, 
motorcycles, and cooling 196) emitted 
1665 Tg CO2 Eq in 2006, representing 
almost 24% of the total U.S. GHG 
emissions. Total global emissions, 
calculated by summing emissions of the 
six greenhouse gases by country, for 
2005 was 38,725.9 Tg CO2 Eq. This 
represents an increase of 26% from the 
1990 level. See the EPA report 
‘‘Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2006’’,197 
Section 2 of the proposed Endangerment 
TSD, and IPCC’s Working Group I (WGI) 
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) 198 for 
a more complete discussion of GHG 
emissions and concentrations. 
b. Observed Changes in Climate 
i. Temperature 
The warming of the climate system is 
unequivocal, as is now evident from 
observations of increases in global air 
and ocean temperatures, widespread 
melting of snow and ice, and rising 
global average sea level. The global 
average net effect of the increase in 
atmospheric GHG concentrations, plus 
other human activities (e.g., land use 
change and aerosol emissions), on the 
global energy balance since 1750 has 
been one of warming. The global mean 
surface temperature 199 over the last 100 
years (1906–2005) has risen by about 
0.74 °C (1.5 °F) +/¥ 0.18 °C, and climate 
model simulations suggest that natural 
variation alone (e.g., changes in solar 
irradiance) cannot explain the observed 
warming. The rate of warming over the 
last 50 years is almost double that over 
the last 100 years. Most of the observed 
increase in global mean surface 
temperature since the mid-20th century 
is very likely due to the observed 
increase in anthropogenic GHG 
concentrations. 
It can be stated with confidence that 
global mean surface temperature was 
higher during the last few decades of the 
20th century than during any 
comparable period during the preceding 
four centuries. Like global mean surface 
temperatures, U.S. surface temperatures 
also warmed during the 20th and into 
the 21st century. U.S. average annual 
temperatures are now approximately 
0.69°C (1.25°F) warmer than at the start 
of the 20th century, with an increased 
rate of warming over the past 30 years. 
Temperatures in winter have risen more 
than any other season, with winters in 
the Midwest and northern Great Plains 
increasing more than 7 °F.200 Some of 
these changes have been faster than 
previous assessments had suggested.

‘‘Global Climate Change Impacts in the 
United States’’.202 
ii. Precipitation 
Observations show that changes are 
occurring in the amount, intensity, 
frequency and type of precipitation. 
Global, long-term trends from 1900 to 
2005 have been observed in the amount 
of precipitation over many large regions. 
Patterns in precipitation change are 
more spatially and seasonally variable 
than temperature change, but where 
significant precipitation changes do 
occur they are consistent with measured 
changes in stream flow. Significantly 
increased precipitation has been 
observed in eastern parts of North and 
South America, northern Europe and 
northern and central Asia.200 More 
intense and longer droughts have been 
observed over wider areas since the 
1970s, particularly in the tropics and 
subtropics. It is likely there has been an 
increase in heavy precipitation events 
(e.g., 95th percentile) within many land 
regions, even in those where there has 
been a reduction in total precipitation 
amount, consistent with a warming 
climate and observed significant 
increasing amounts of water vapor in 
the atmosphere. Rising temperatures 
have generally resulted in rain rather 
than snow in locations and seasons such 
as in northern and mountainous regions 
where the average (1961–1990) 
temperatures were close to 0 °C. Over 
the contiguous U.S., total annual 
precipitation increased at an average 
rate of 6.5% from 1901–2006, with the 
greatest increases in precipitation in the 
East and North Central climate regions 
(11.2% per century). 
For additional information, please see 
Section 4 of the proposed Endangerment 
TSD, IPCC WGI AR4,203 and the 
USGCRP report ‘‘Global Climate Change 
Impacts in the United States’’.204 
iii. Extreme Events 
Changes in climate extremes have 
been observed related to temperature, 
precipitation, tropical cyclones, and sea 
level. In the last 50 years, there have 
been widespread changes in extreme 
temperatures observed across the globe. 
For example, cold days, cold nights, and 
frost have become less frequent, while 
hot days, hot nights, and heat waves 
have become more frequent. Globally, a 
reduction in the number of daily cold 
extremes has been observed in 70 to 
75% of the land regions where data is 
available. Cold nights (lowest or coldest 
10% of nights, based on the period 
1961–1990) have become rarer over the 
last 50 years. 
Observational evidence indicates an 
increase in intense tropical cyclone (i.e., 
tropical storms and/or hurricanes) 
activity in the North Atlantic. Since 
about 1970, increases in cyclone 
developments that affect the U.S. East 
and Gulf Coasts have been correlated 
with increases of tropical sea surface 
temperatures In the contiguous U.S., 
studies find statistically significant 
increases in heavy precipitation (the 
heaviest 5%) and very heavy 
precipitation (the heaviest 1%) of 14 
and 20%, respectively. Much of this 
increase occurred during the last three 
decades of the 20th century and is most 
apparent over the eastern parts of the 
country. Trends in drought also have 
strong regional variations. In much of 
the Southeast and large parts of the 
western U.S., the frequency of drought 
has increased coincident with rising 
temperatures over the past 50 years. 
Although there has been an overall 
increase in precipitation and no clear 
trend in drought for the nation as a 
whole, increasing temperatures have 
made droughts more severe and 
widespread than they would have 
otherwise been. 
For additional information, please see 
Section 4 of the proposed Endangerment 
TSD, the CCSP report ‘‘Weather and 
Climate Extremes in a Changing 
Climate. Regions of Focus: North 
America, Hawaii, Caribbean, and U.S. 
Pacific Islands’’,205 IPCC WGI AR4,206 
and the report ‘‘Global Climate Change 
Impacts in the United States’’.207 
iv. Physical and Biological Changes 
Observations show that climate 
change is currently affecting U.S. 
physical and biological systems in 
significant ways. Observations of the 
cryosphere (the ‘‘frozen’’ component of 
the climate system) have revealed 
changes in sea ice, glaciers and snow 
cover, freezing and thawing, and 
permafrost. Satellite data since 1978 
show that annual average Arctic sea ice 
extent has shrunk by 2.7% (+/¥ 0.6%) 
per decade, with larger decreases in 
summer. Subtropical and tropical corals 
in shallow waters have already suffered 
major bleaching events that are 
primarily driven by increases in sea 
surface temperatures. Heat stress from 
warmer ocean water can cause corals to 
expel the microscopic algae that live 
inside them which are essential to their 
survival. Another stressor on coral 
populations is ocean acidification 
which occurs as CO2 is absorbed from 
the atmosphere by the oceans. About 
one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted 
by human activities has been absorbed 
by the ocean, resulting in a decrease in 
the ocean’s pH. A lower pH affects the 
ability of living things to create and 
maintain shells or skeletons of calcium 
carbonate. Other documented bio- 
physical impacts include a significant 
lengthening of the growing season and 
increase in net primary productivity 208 
in higher latitudes of North America. 
Over the last 19 years, global satellite 
data indicate an earlier onset of spring 
across the temperate latitudes by 10 to 
14 days.

c. Projected Changes in Climate 
Most future scenarios that assume no 
explicit GHG mitigation actions (beyond 
those already enacted) project 
increasing global GHG emissions over 
the century, with corresponding 
climbing GHG concentrations. Carbon 
dioxide is expected to remain the 
dominant anthropogenic GHG over the 
course of the 21st century. The radiative 
forcing 210 associated with the non-CO2 
GHGs is still significant and increasing 
over time. As a result, warming over this 
century is projected to be considerably 
greater than over the last century and 
climate related changes are expected to 
continue while new ones develop. 
Described below are projected changes 
in climate for the U.S. 
See Section 6 of the proposed 
Endangerment TSD, IPCC WGI AR4,211 
the USGCRP report ‘‘Global Climate 
Change Impacts in the United 
States’’,212 and the CCSP report 
‘‘Weather and Climate Extremes in a 
Changing Climate, Regions of Focus: 
North America, Hawaii, Caribbean, and 
U.S. Pacific Islands’’ 213 for a more 
complete discussion of projected 
changes in climate. 
i. Temperature 
Future warming over the course of the 
21st century, even under scenarios of 
low emissions growth, is very likely to 
be greater than observed warming over 
the past century. The range of IPCC 
SRES scenarios provides a global 
warming range of 1.8 °C to 4.0 °C (3.2 
°F to 7.2 °F) with an uncertainty range 
of 1.1 °C to 6.4 °C (2.0 °F to 11.5 °F). 
All of the U.S. is very likely to warm 
during this century, and most areas of 
the U.S. are expected to warm by more 
than the global average. The average 
warming in the U.S. through 2100 is 
projected by nearly all the models used 
in the IPCC assessment to exceed 2 °C 
(3.6 °F) for all scenarios, with 5 out of 
21 models projecting average warming 
in excess of 4 °C (7.2 °F) for the mid- 
range emissions scenario. The number 
of days with high temperatures above 90 
°F is projected to increase throughout 
the U.S. Temperature increases in the 
next couple of decades will be primarily 
determined by past emissions of heat- 
trapping gases. As a result, there is less 
difference in projected temperature 
scenarios in the near-term (around 2020) 
than in the middle (2050) and end of the 
century, which will be determined more 
by future emissions. 
ii. Precipitation 
Increases in the amount of 
precipitation are very likely in higher 
latitudes, while decreases are likely in 
most subtropical latitudes and the 
southwestern U.S., continuing observed 
patterns. The mid-continental area is 
expected to experience drying during 
the summer, indicating a greater risk of 
drought. Climate models project 
continued increases in the heaviest 
downpours during this century, while 
the lightest precipitation is projected to 
decrease. With more intense 
precipitation expected to increase, the 
risk of flooding and greater runoff and 
erosion will also increase. In contrast, 
droughts are likely to become more 
frequent and severe in some regions. 
The Southwest, in particular, is 
expected to experience increasing 
drought as changes in atmospheric 
circulation patterns cause the dry zone 
just outside the tropics to expand farther 
northward into the United States. 
iii. Extreme Events 
It is likely that hurricanes will 
become more intense, especially along 
the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, with 
stronger peak winds and more heavy 
precipitation associated with ongoing 
increases of tropical sea surface 
temperatures. Heavy rainfall events are 
expected to increase, increasing the risk 
of flooding, greater runoff and erosion, 
and thus the potential for adverse water 
quality effects. These projected trends 
can increase the number of people at 
risk from suffering disease and injury 
due to floods, storms, droughts, and 
fires. Severe heat waves are projected to 
intensify, which can increase heat- 
related mortality and sickness. 
iv. Physical and Biological Changes 
IPCC projects a six-inch to two-foot 
rise in sea level during the 21st century 
from processes such as thermal 
expansion of sea water and the melting 
of land-based polar ice sheets. Ocean 
acidification is projected to continue, 
resulting in the reduced biological 
production of marine calcifiers, 
including corals. In addition to ocean 
acidification, coastal waters are very 
likely to continue to warm by as much 
as 4 to 8 °F in this century, both in 
summer and winter. This will result in 
a northward shift in the geographic 
distribution of marine life along the 
coasts. Warmer ocean temperatures will 
also contribute to increased coral 
bleaching. 
d. Key Climate Change Impacts and 
Risks 
The effects of climate changes 
observed to date and/or projected to 
occur in the future include: More 
frequent and intense heat waves, more 
wildfires, degraded air quality, more 
heavy downpours and flooding, 
increased drought, greater sea level rise, 
more intense storms, water quantity and 
quality problems, and negative impacts 
to human health, water supply, 
agriculture, forestry, coastal areas, 
wildlife and ecosystems, and many 
other aspects of society and the natural 
environment. 
i. Human Health 
Warm temperatures and extreme 
weather already cause and contribute to 
adverse human health outcomes 
through heat-related mortality and 
morbidity, storm-related fatalities and 
injuries, and disease. In the absence of 
effective adaptation, these effects are 
likely to increase with climate change. 
Health effects related to climate change 
include increased deaths, injuries, 
infectious diseases, and stress-related 
disorders and other adverse effects 
associated with social disruption and 
migration from more frequent extreme 
weather. Severe heat waves are 
projected to intensify in magnitude and 
duration over the portions of the U.S. 
where these events already occur, with 
potential increases in mortality and 
morbidity, especially among the elderly, 
young and other sensitive populations.

However, reduced human mortality 
from cold exposure is projected through 
2100. It is not clear whether reduced 
mortality from cold will be greater or 
less than increased heat-related 
mortality, especially among the elderly, 
young and frail. Public health effects 
from climate change will likely 
disproportionately impact the health of 
certain segments of the population, such 
as the poor, the very young, the elderly, 
those already in poor health, the 
disabled, those living alone and/or 
indigenous populations dependent on 
one or a few resources. Increases are 
expected in potential ranges and 
exposure of certain diseases affected by 
temperature and precipitation changes, 
including vector and waterborne 
diseases (i.e., malaria, dengue fever, 
West Nile virus). See the CCSP Report 
‘‘Analyses of the effects of global change 
on human health and welfare and 
human systems’’,214 IPCC’s Working 
Group II (WG2) AR4,215 and Section 7 
of the proposed Endangerment TSD for 
a more complete discussion regarding 
climate change and impacts on human 
health. 
ii. Air Quality 
Climate change can be expected to 
influence the concentration and 
distribution of air pollutants through a 
variety of direct and indirect processes, 
including the modification of biogenic 
emissions, the change of chemical 
reaction rates, wash-out of pollutants by 
precipitation, and modification of 
weather patterns that influence 
pollutant build-up. Higher temperatures 
and weaker circulation patterns 
associated with climate change are 
expected to worsen regional ozone 
pollution in the U.S., with associated 
risks in respiratory infection, 
aggravation of asthma, and premature 
death. In addition to human health 
effects, elevated levels of tropospheric 
ozone have significant adverse effects 
on crop yields, pasture and forest 
growth, and species composition. See 
Section 8 of the proposed Endangerment 
TSD, EPA’s report ‘‘Assessment of the 
Impacts of Global Change on Regional 
U.S. Air Quality: A Synthesis of Climate 
Change Impacts on Ground-Level 
Ozone’’, 216 the CCSP report ‘‘Analyses 
of the effects of global change on human 
health and welfare and human 
systems’’ 217 and IPCC WGII AR4 218 for 
a more complete discussion regarding 
human health impacts resulting from 
climate change effects on air quality. 
iii. Food and Agriculture 
The CCSP concluded that, with 
increased CO2 and temperature, the life 
cycle of grain and oilseed crops will 
likely progress more rapidly. But, as 
temperature rises, these crops will 
increasingly begin to experience failure, 
especially if climate variability 
increases and precipitation lessens or 
becomes more variable. Furthermore, 
the marketable yield of many 
horticultural crops (e.g., tomatoes, 
onions, fruits) is very likely to be more 
sensitive to climate change than grain 
and oilseed crops. Higher temperatures 
will very likely reduce livestock 
production during the summer season, 
but these losses will very likely be 
partially offset by warmer temperatures 
during the winter season. Cold water 
fisheries will likely be negatively 
affected; warm-water fisheries will 
generally benefit; and the results for 
cool-water fisheries will be mixed, with 
gains in the northern and losses in the 
southern portions of ranges. See Section 
9 of the proposed Endangerment TSD, 
the CCSP report ‘‘The Effects of Climate 
Change on Agriculture, Land Resources, 
Water Resources, and Biodiversity in 
the United States’’, and the USGCRP 
report ‘‘Global Climate Change Impacts 
in the United States’’ for a more 
complete discussion regarding climate 
science and impacts to food production 
and agriculture. 
iv. Forestry 
Climate change has very likely 
increased the size and number of forest 
fires, insect outbreaks, and tree 
mortality in the interior west, the 
Southwest, and Alaska, and will 
continue to do so. Disturbances like 
wildfire and insect outbreaks are 
increasing and are likely to intensify in 
a warmer future with drier soils and 
longer growing seasons. Although recent 
climate trends have increased vegetation 
growth, continuing increases in 
disturbances are likely to limit carbon 
storage, facilitate invasive species, and 
disrupt ecosystem services. Overall 
forest growth for North America as a 
whole will likely increase modestly (10– 
20%) as a result of extended growing 
seasons and elevated CO2 over the next 
century, but with important spatial and 
temporal variation. Forest growth is 
slowing in areas subject to drought and 
has been subject to significant loss due 
insect infestations such as the spruce 
bark beetle in Alaska. See Section 10 of 
the proposed Endangerment TSD, the 
CCSP report ‘‘The Effects of Climate 
Change on Agriculture, Land Resources, 
Water Resources, and Biodiversity in 
the United States’’, IPCC WGII, and the 
USGCRP report ‘‘Global Climate Change 
Impacts in the United States’’ for a more 
complete discussion regarding climate 
science and impacts to forestry. 
v. Water Resources 
The vulnerability of freshwater 
resources in the United States to climate 
change varies from region to region. 
Climate change will likely further 
constrain already over-allocated water 
resources in some sections of the U.S., 
increasing competition among 
agricultural, municipal, industrial, and 
ecological uses. Although water 
management practices in the U.S. are 
generally advanced, particularly in the 
western U.S climate change may 
increasingly create conditions well 
outside of historic observations 
impacting managed water systems. 
Rising temperatures will diminish 
snowpack and increase evaporation, 
affecting seasonal availability of water. 
Groundwater systems generally respond 
more slowly to climate change than 
surface water systems. In semi-arid and 
arid areas, groundwater resources are 
particularly vulnerable because of 
precipitation and stream flow are 
concentrated over a few months, year- 
to-year variability is high, and deep 
groundwater wells or reservoirs 
generally do not exist. Availability of 
groundwater is likely to be influenced 
by changes in withdrawals (reflecting 
development, demand, and availability 
of other sources). 
In the Great Lakes and major river 
systems, lower levels are likely to 
exacerbate challenges relating to water 
quality, navigation, recreation,

hydropower generation, water transfers, 
and bi-national relationships. Decreased 
water supply and lower water levels are 
likely to exacerbate challenges relating 
to aquatic navigation. Higher water 
temperatures, increased precipitation 
intensity, and longer periods of low 
flows will exacerbate many forms of 
water pollution, potentially making 
attainment of water quality goals more 
difficult. As waters become warmer, the 
aquatic life they now support will be 
replaced by other species better adapted 
to warmer water. In the long-term, 
warmer water and changing flow may 
result in deterioration of aquatic 
ecosystems. See Section 11 of the 
proposed Endangerment TSD, the CCSP 
report ‘‘The Effects of Climate Change 
on Agriculture, Land Resources, Water 
Resources, and Biodiversity in the 
United States’’, IPCC WGII, and the 
USGCRP report ‘‘Global Change Impacts 
in the United States’’ for a more 
complete discussion regarding climate 
science and impacts to water resources. 
vi. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Areas 
Warmer temperatures raise sea level 
by expanding ocean water, melting 
glaciers, and possibly increasing the rate 
at which ice sheets discharge ice and 
water into the oceans. Rising sea level 
and the potential for stronger storms 
pose an increasing threat to coastal 
cities, residential communities, 
infrastructure, beaches, wetlands, and 
ecosystems. Coastal communities and 
habitats will be increasingly stressed by 
climate change effects interacting with 
development and pollution. Sea level is 
rising along much of the U.S. coast, and 
the rate of change will increase in the 
future, exacerbating the impacts of 
progressive inundation, storm-surge 
flooding, and shoreline erosion. Studies 
find 75% of the shoreline removed from 
the influence of spits, tidal inlets and 
engineering structures is eroding along 
the U.S. East Coast probably due to sea 
level rise. Storm impacts are likely to be 
more severe, especially along the Gulf 
and Atlantic coasts. Salt marshes, 
estuaries, other coastal habitats, and 
dependent species will be further 
threatened by sea level rise. The 
interaction with coastal zone 
development and climate change effects 
such as sea level rise will further stress 
coastal communities and habitats. 
Population growth and rising value of 
infrastructure in coastal areas increases 
vulnerability and risk of climate 
variability and future climate change. 
Sea level rise and high rates of water 
withdrawal promote the intrusion of 
saline water in to groundwater supplies, 
which adversely affects water quality. 
See Section 12 of the proposed 
Endangerment TSD, the CCSP report 
‘‘Coastal Sensitivity to Sea Level Rise: A 
Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region’’,219 
the USGCRP report ‘‘Global Change 
Impacts in the United States’’, and IPCC 
WGII for a more complete discussion 
regarding climate science and impacts 
to sea level rise and coastal areas. 
vii. Energy, Infrastructure and 
Settlements 
Most of the effects of climate change 
on the U.S. energy sector will be related 
to energy use and production. The 
research evidence is relatively clear that 
climate warming will mean reductions 
in total U.S. heating requirements and 
increases in total cooling requirements 
for building. These changes will vary by 
region and by season and will affect 
household and business energy costs. 
Studies project that temperature 
increases due to global warming are 
very likely to increase peak demand for 
electricity in most regions of the country 
as rising temperatures are expected to 
increase energy requirements for cooling 
residential and commercial buildings. 
An increase in peak demand for 
electricity can lead to a disproportionate 
increase in energy infrastructure 
investment. Extreme weather events can 
threaten coastal energy infrastructures 
and electricity transmission and 
distribution in the U.S. Increases in 
hurricane intensity are likely to cause 
further disruptions to oil and gas 
operations in the Gulf, like those 
experienced in 2005 with Hurricane 
Katrina. Climate change is likely to 
affect some renewable energy sources 
across the nation, such as hydropower 
production in regions subject to 
changing patterns of precipitation or 
snowmelt. The U.S. energy sector, 
which relies heavily on water for both 
hydropower and cooling capacity, may 
be adversely impacted by changes to 
water supply and quality in reservoirs 
and other water bodies. 
Water infrastructure, including 
drinking water and wastewater 
treatment plants, and sewer and storm 
water management systems, will be at 
greater risk of flooding, sea level rise 
and storm surge, low flows, and other 
factors that could impair performance. 
In addition, as water supply is 
constrained and demand increases it 
will become more likely that water will 
have to be transported and moved 
which will require additional energy 
capacity. See Section 13 of the proposed 
Endangerment TSD, the CCSP reports 
‘‘the Effects of Climate Change on 
Energy Production in the United 
States’’ 220 and ‘‘Impacts of Climate 
Change and Variability on 
Transportation Systems and 
Infrastructure’’,221 and the USGCRP 
report ‘‘Global Change Impacts in the 
United States’’ for a more complete 
discussion regarding climate science 
and impacts to energy, infrastructure 
and settlements. 
viii. Ecosystems and Wildlife 
Disturbances such as wildfires and 
insect outbreaks are increasing in the 
U.S. and are likely to intensify in a 
warmer future with drier soils and 
longer growing seasons. Although recent 
climate trends have increased vegetation 
growth, continuing increases in 
disturbances are likely to limit carbon 
storage, facilitate invasive species, and 
disrupt ecosystem services. Over the 
21st century, changes in climate will 
cause species to shift north and to 
higher elevations and fundamentally 
rearrange U.S. ecosystems. Differential 
capacities for range shifts are 
constrained by development, habitat 
fragmentation, invasive species, and 
broken ecological connections. IPCC 
consequently predicts significant 
disruption of ecosystem structure, 
function, and services. See Section 14 of 
the proposed Endangerment TSD, IPCC 
WGII, the CCSP report ‘‘The Effects of 
Climate Change on Agriculture, Land 
Resources, Water Resources, and 
Biodiversity in the United States’’, and 
the USGCRP report ‘‘Global Change 
Impacts in the United States’’ for a more 
complete discussion regarding climate 
science and impacts to ecosystems and 
wildlife.

222 Using the Model for the Assessment of 
Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC, 
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/wigley/magicc/), EPA 
estimated the effects of this action’s greenhouse gas 
emissions reductions on global mean temperature 
and sea level. Please refer to Chapter 7.4 of the 
DRIA for additional information. 
223 In IPCC reports, equilibrium climate 
sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change in the 
annual mean global surface temperature following 
a doubling of the atmospheric equivalent carbon 
dioxide concentration. The IPCC states that climate 
sensitivity is ‘‘likely’’ to be in the range of 2 °C to 
4.5 °C, ‘‘very unlikely’’ to be less than 1.5 °C, and 
‘‘values substantially higher than 4.5 °C cannot be 
excluded.’’ IPCC WGI, 2007, Climate Change 
2007—The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of 
Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report 
of the IPCC, http://www.ipcc.ch/. 
224 As the footprint attribute is defined as 
wheelbase times track width, the footprint target 
curves do not discourage manufacturers from 
reducing vehicle size by reducing front, rear, or side 
overhang, which can impact safety by resulting in 
less crush space. 
225 This neutrality with respect to footprint does 
not extend to the smallest and largest vehicles, 
because the function is limited, or flattened, in 
these footprint ranges. 
3. Changes in Global Mean Temperature 
and Sea Level Rise Associated With the 
Proposal’s GHG Emissions Reductions 
EPA examined 222 the reductions in 
CO2 and other GHGs associated with the 
proposal and analyzed the projected 
effects on global mean surface 
temperature and sea level, two common 
indicators of climate change. The 
analysis projects that the proposal will 
reduce climate warming and sea level 
rise. Although the projected reductions 
are small in overall magnitude by 
themselves, they are quantifiable and 
would contribute to reducing climate 
change risks. 
a. Estimated Projected Reductions in 
Global Mean Surface Temperatures and 
Sea Level Rise 
EPA estimated changes in the 
atmospheric CO2 concentration, global 
mean surface temperature and sea level 
to 2100 resulting from the emissions 
reductions in this proposal using the 
Model for the Assessment of 
Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate 
Change (MAGICC, version 5.3). This 
widely used, peer reviewed modeling 
tool was also used to project 
temperature and sea level rise under 
different emissions scenarios in the 
Third and Fourth Assessments of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC). 
GHG emissions reductions from 
Section III.F.1a were applied as net 
reductions to a peer reviewed global 
reference case (or baseline) emissions 
scenario to generate an emissions 
scenario specific to this proposal. For 
the proposal scenario, all emissions 
reductions were assumed to begin in 
2012, with zero emissions change in 
2011 (from the reference case) followed 
by emissions linearly increasing to 
equal the value supplied in Section 
III.F.1.a for 2020 and then continuing to 
2100. Details about the reference case 
scenario and how the emissions 
reductions were applied to generate the 
proposal scenario can be found in the 
DRIA Chapter 7. 
The atmospheric CO2 concentration, 
temperature, and sea-level increases for 
both the reference case and the proposal 
emissions scenarios were computed 
using MAGICC. To compute the 
reductions in the atmospheric CO2 
concentrations as well as in temperature 
and sea level resulting from the 
proposal, the output from the proposal 
scenario was subtracted from an existing 
MiniCAM emission scenario. To capture 
some key uncertainties in the climate 
system with the MAGICC model, 
changes in temperature and sea-level 
rise were projected across the most 
current IPCC range for climate 
sensitivities which ranges from 1.5 °C to 
6.0 °C (representing the 90% confidence 
interval).223 This wide range reflects the 
uncertainty in this measure of how 
much the global mean temperature 
would rise if the concentration of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were 
to double. Details about this modeling 
analysis can be found in the DRIA 
Chapter 7.4. 
The results of this modeling show 
small, but quantifiable, reductions in 
the atmospheric CO2 concentration, the 
projected global mean surface 
temperature and sea level resulting from 
this proposal (assuming it is finalized), 
across all climate sensitivities. As a 
result of this proposal’s emission 
reductions, the atmospheric CO2 
concentration is projected to be reduced 
by approximately 2.9 to 3.2 parts per 
million (ppm), the global mean 
temperature is projected to be reduced 
by approximately 0.007–0.016 °C by 
2100, and global mean sea level rise is 
projected to be reduced by 
approximately 0.06–0.15cm by 2100. 
The reductions are small relative to the 
IPCC’s 2100 ‘‘best estimates’’ for global 
mean temperature increases (1.8–4.0 °C) 
and sea level rise (0.20–0.59m) for all 
global GHG emissions sources for a 
range of emissions scenarios. EPA used 
a peer reviewed model, the MAGICC 
model, to do this analysis. This analysis 
is specific to the proposed rule and 
therefore cannot come from some 
previously published work. The Agency 
welcomes comment on the use of the 
MAGICC model for these purposes. 
Further discussion of EPA’s modeling 
analysis is found in Chapter 7 of the 
Draft RIA. 
As a substantial portion of CO2 
emitted into the atmosphere is not 
removed by natural processes for 
millennia, each unit of CO2 not emitted 
into the atmosphere avoids essentially 
permanent climate change on centennial 
time scales. Though the magnitude of 
the avoided climate change projected 
here is small, these reductions would 
represent a reduction in the adverse 
risks associated with climate change 
(though these risks were not formally 
estimated for this proposal) across all 
climate sensitivities. 
4. Weight Reduction and Potential 
Safety Impacts 
In this section, EPA will discuss 
potential safety impacts of the proposed 
standards. In the joint technology 
analysis, EPA and NHTSA agree that 
automakers could reduce weight as one 
part of the industry’s strategy for 
meeting the proposed standards. As 
shown in table III.D.6–3, of this 
Preamble, EPA’s modeling projects that 
vehicle manufacturers will reduce the 
weight of their vehicles by 4% on 
average between 2011 and 2016 
although individual vehicles may have 
greater or smaller weight reduction 
(NHTSA’s results are similar using the 
Volpe model). The penetration and 
magnitude of these modeled changes are 
consistent with the public 
announcements made by many 
manufacturers since early 2008 and are 
consistent with meetings that EPA has 
had with senior engineers and technical 
leadership at many of the automotive 
companies during 2008 and 2009. 
EPA also projects that automakers 
will not reduce footprint in order to 
meet the proposed CO2 standards in our 
modeling analysis. NHTSA and EPA 
have taken two measures to help ensure 
that the proposed rules provide no 
incentive for mass reduction to be 
accompanied by a corresponding 
decrease in the footprint of the vehicle 
(with its concomitant decrease in crush 
and crumple zones). The first design 
feature of the proposed rule is that the 
CO2 or fuel economy targets are based 
on the attribute of footprint (which is a 
surrogate for vehicle size).224 The 
second design feature is that the shape 
of the footprint curve (or function) has 
been carefully chosen such that it 
neither encourages manufacturers to 
increase, nor decrease the footprint of 
their fleet. Thus, the standard curves are 
designed to be approximately ‘‘footprint 
neutral’’ within the sloped portion of 
the function.225 For further discussion 
on this, refer to Section II.C of the 
preamble, or Chapter 2 of the joint TSD. 
Thus the agencies are assuming in their

227 We note that since these MY 2009 F150s have

world crash data available to evaluate the safety 
impacts of this new design.

modeling analysis that the 
manufacturers could reduce vehicle 
mass without reducing vehicle footprint 
as one way to respond to the proposed 
rule.226 
In Section IV of this preamble, 
NHTSA presents a safety analysis of the 
proposed CAFE standards based on the 
2003 Kahane analysis. As discussed in 
Section IV, NHTSA has developed a 
worse case estimate of the impact of 
weight reductions on fatalities. The 
underlying data used for that analysis 
does not allow NHTSA to analyze the 
specific impact of weight reduction at 
constant footprint because historically 
there have not been a large number of 
vehicles produced that relied 
substantially on material substitution. 
Rather, the data set includes vehicles 
that were either smaller and lighter or 
larger and heavier. The numbers in the 
NHTSA analysis predict the safety- 
related fatality consequences that would 
occur in the unlikely event that weight 
reduction for model years 2012–2016 is 
accomplished by reducing mass and 
reducing footprint. EPA concurs with 
NHTSA that the safety analysis 
conducted by NHTSA and presented in 
Section IV is a worst case analysis for 
fatalities, and that the actual impacts on 
vehicle safety could be much less. 
However, EPA and NHTSA are not able 
to quantify the lower-bound potential 
impacts at this time. 
The agencies believe that reducing 
vehicle mass without reducing the size 
of the vehicle or the structural integrity 
is technically feasible in the rulemaking 
time frame. Many of the technical 
options for doing so are outlined in 
Chapter 3 of the joint TSD and in EPA’s 
DRIA. Weight reduction can be 
accomplished by the proven methods 
described below. Every manufacturer 
will employ these methodologies to 
some degree, the magnitude to which 
each will be used will depend on 
opportunities within individual vehicle 
design. 
• Material Substitution: Substitution 
of lower density and/or higher strength 
materials in a manner that preserves or 
improves the function of the 
component. This includes substitution 
of high-strength steels, aluminum, 
magnesium or composite materials for 
components currently fabricated from 
mild steel (e.g., the magnesium-alloy 
front structure used on the 2009 Ford 
F150 pickups).227 Light-weight 
materials with acceptable energy 
absorption properties can maintain 
structural integrity and absorption of 
crash energy relative to previous designs 
while providing a net decrease in 
component weight. 
• Smart Design: Computer aided 
engineering (CAE) tools can be used to 
better optimize load paths within 
structures by reducing stresses and 
bending moments without adversely 
affecting structural integrity. This 
allows better optimization of the 
sectional thicknesses of structural 
components to reduce mass while 
maintaining or improving the function 
of the component. Smart designs also 
integrate separate parts in a manner that 
reduces mass by combining functions or 
the reduced use of separate fasteners. In 
addition, some ‘‘body on frame’’ 
vehicles are redesigned with a lighter 
‘‘unibody’’ construction with little 
compromise in vehicle functionality. 
• Reduced Powertrain Requirements: 
Reducing vehicle weight sufficiently 
can allow for the use of a smaller, 
lighter and more efficient engine while 
maintaining or even increasing 
performance. Approximately half of the 
reduction is due to these reduced 
powertrain output requirements from 
reduced engine power output and/or 
displacement, lighter weight 
transmission and final drive gear ratios. 
The subsequent reduced rotating mass 
(e.g. transmission, driveshafts/ 
halfshafts, wheels and tires) via weight 
and/or size reduction of components are 
made possible by reduced torque output 
requirements. 
• Mass Compounding: Following 
from the point above, the compounded 
weight reductions of the body, engine 
and drivetrain can reduce stresses on 
the suspension components, steering 
components, brakes, and thus allow 
further reductions in the weight of these 
subsystems. The reductions in weight 
for unsprung masses such as brakes, 
control arms, wheels and tires can 
further reduce stresses in the 
suspension mounting points which can 
allow still further reductions in weight. 
For example, lightweighting can allow 
for the reduction in the size of the 
vehicle brake system, while maintaining 
the same stopping distance. 
Therefore, EPA believes it is both 
technically feasible to reduce weight 
without reducing vehicle size, footprint 
or structural strength and manufacturers 
have indicated to the agencies that they 
will use these approaches to accomplish 
these tasks. We request written 
comment on this assessment and this 
projection, including up-to-date plans 
regarding the extent of use by each 
manufacturer of each of the 
methodologies described above. 
For this proposed rule, as noted 
earlier, EPA’s modeling analysis 
projects that weight reduction by model 
year 2016 on the order of 4% on average 
for the fleet will occur (see Section 
III.D.6 for details on our estimated mass 
reduction). EPA believes that such 
modeled changes in the fleet could 
result in much smaller fatality impacts 
than those in the worst case scenario 
presented in Section IV by NHTSA, 
since manufacturers have many safer 
options for reducing vehicle weight than 
doing so by simultaneously reducing 
footprint. The NHTSA analysis, based 
solely on 4-door vehicles, does not 
independently differentiate between 
weight reduction which comes from 
vehicle downsizing (a physically 
smaller vehicle) and vehicle weight 
reduction solely through design and 
material changes (i.e., making a vehicle 
weigh less without changing the size of 
the vehicle or reducing structural 
integrity). 
Dynamic Research Incorporated (DRI) 
has assessed the independent effects of 
vehicle weight and size on safety in 
order to determine if there are tradeoffs 
between improving vehicle safety and 
fuel consumption. In their 2005 
studies 228 229 one of which was 
published as a Society of Automotive 
Engineers Technical Paper and received 
peer review through that body, DRI 
presented results that indicate that 
vehicle weight reduction tends to 
decrease fatalities, but vehicle 
wheelbase and track reduction tends to 
increase fatalities. The DRI work 
focused on four major points, with #1 
and #4 being discussed with additional 
detail below: 
1. 2–Door vehicles represented a 
significant portion of the light duty fleet 
and should not be ignored. 
2. Directional control and therefore 
crash avoidance improves with a 
reduction in curb weight. 
3. The occupants of the impacted 
vehicle, or ‘‘collision partner’’ benefit 
from being impacted by a lighter 
vehicle. 
4. Rollover fatalities are reduced by a 
reduction in curb weight due to lower 
centers of gravity and lower loads on the 
roof structures.

Fatality Risk’’, Dynamic Research, Inc., DRI–TR–

Research Inc., Society of Automotive Engineers 
Technical Paper 2005–01–1354. 
232 FR Vol. 74, No. 59, beginning on pg. 14402. 
The data used for the DRI analysis 
was similar to NHTSA’s 2003 Kahane 
study, using Fatality Analysis Reporting 
System (FARS) data for vehicle model 
years 1985 through 1998 for cars, and 
1985 through 1997 trucks. This data 
overlaps Kahane’s FARS data on model 
year 1991 to 1999 vehicles. However, 
DRI included 2-door passenger cars, 
whereas the Kahane study excluded all 
2-door vehicles. The 2003 Kahane study 
excluded 2-door passenger cars because 
it found that for MY 1991–1999 
vehicles, sports and muscle cars 
constituted a significant proportion of 
those vehicles. These vehicles have 
relatively high weight relative to their 
wheelbase, and are also 
disproportionately involved in crashes. 
Thus, Kahane concluded that including 
these vehicles in the analysis 
excessively skewed the regression 
results. However, as of July 1, 1999, 2- 
door passenger cars represented 29% of 
the registered cars in the United States. 
DRI’s position was that this is a 
significant portion of the light duty 
fleet, too large to be ignored, and 
conclusions regarding the effects of 
weight and safety should be based on 
data for all cars, not just 4-doors. DRI 
did state in their conclusions that the 
results are sensitive to removing data for 
2-doors and wagons, and that the results 
for 4-door cars with respect to the 
effects of wheelbase and track width 
were no longer statistically significant 
when 2-door cars were removed. EPA 
and NHTSA recognize that it is 
important to properly account for 2-door 
cars in a regression analysis evaluating 
the impacts of vehicle weight on safety. 
Thus, the agencies seek comment on 
how to ensure that any analysis 
supporting the final rule accounts as 
fully as possible for the range of safety 
impacts due to weight reduction on the 
variety of vehicles regulated under these 
proposed standards. 
The DRI and Kahane studies also 
differ with respect to the impact of 
vehicle weight on rollover fatalities. The 
Kahane study treated curb weight as a 
surrogate for size and weight and 
analyzed them as a single variable. 
Using this method, the 2003 Kahane 
analysis indicates that curb weight 
reductions would increase fatalities due 
to rollovers. The DRI study differed by 
analyzing curb weight, wheelbase, and 
track as multiple variables and 
concluded that curb weight reduction 
would decrease rollover fatalities, and 
wheelbase and track reduction would 
increase rollover fatalities. DRI offers 
two potential root causes for higher curb 
weight resulting in higher rollover 
fatalities. The first is that a taller vehicle 
tends to be heavier than a shorter 
vehicle; therefore heavier vehicles may 
be more likely to rollover because the 
vehicle height and weight are correlated 
with vehicle center of gravity height. 
The second is that FMVSS 216 for roof 
crush strength requirements for 
passenger cars of model years 1995 
through 1999 were proportional to the 
unloaded vehicle weight if the weight is 
less than 3,333 lbs, however they were 
a constant if the weight is greater than 
3,333 lbs. Therefore heavier vehicles 
may have had relatively less rollover 
crashworthiness. 
NHTSA has rejected the DRI analysis, 
and has not relied on it for its 
evaluation of safety impact changes in 
CAFE standards. See Section IV.G.6 of 
this Notice, as well as NHTSA’s March 
2009 Final Rulemaking for MY2011 
CAFE standards (see 74 FR at 14402– 
05). 
The DRI and Kahane analyses of the 
FARS data appear similar in one respect 
because the results are reproducible 
between the two studies when using 
aggregated vehicle attributes for 4-door 
cars.230 231 232 However, when DRI and 
NHTSA separately analyzed individual 
vehicle attributes of mass, wheelbase 
and track width, DRI and NHTSA 
obtained different results for passenger 
cars. NHTSA has raised this as a 
concern with the DRI study. When 2- 
door vehicles are removed from the data 
set EPA is concerned that the results 
may no longer be statistically significant 
with respect to independent vehicle 
attributes due to the small remaining 
data set, as DRI stated in the 2005 study. 
The DRI analysis concluded that there 
would be a small reduction in fatalities 
for cars and for trucks for a 100 pound 
reduction in curb weight without 
accompanied vehicle footprint or size 
changes. EPA notes that if DRI’s results 
were to be applied using the curb 
weight reductions predicted by the 
OMEGA model, an overall reduction in 
fatalities would be predicted. EPA 
invites comment on all aspects of the 
issue of the impact of this kind of 
weight reduction on safety, including 
the usefulness of the DRI study in 
evaluating this issue. 
The agencies are committed to 
continuing to analyze vehicle safety 
issues so a more informed evaluation 
can be made. We request comment on 
this issue. These comments should 
include not only further discussion and 
analysis of the relevant studies but data 
and analysis which can allow the 
agencies to more accurately quantify 
any potential safety issues with the 
proposed standards. 
G. How Would the Proposal Impact 
Non-GHG Emissions and Their 
Associated Effects? 
In addition to reducing the emissions 
of greenhouse gases, this proposal 
would influence the emissions of 
‘‘criteria’’ air pollutants and air toxics 
(i.e., hazardous air pollutants). The 
criteria air pollutants include carbon 
monoxide (CO), fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SOX) and the 
ozone precursors hydrocarbons (VOC) 
and oxides of nitrogen (NOX); the air 
toxics include benzene, 1,3-butadiene, 
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 
acrolein. Our estimates of these non- 
GHG emission impacts from the 
proposed program are shown by 
pollutant in Table III.G–1 and Table 
III.G–2 in total, and broken down by the 
two drivers of these changes: (a) 
‘‘Upstream’’ emission reductions due to 
decreased extraction, production and 
distribution of motor gasoline; and (b) 
‘‘downstream’’ emission increases, 
reflecting the effects of VMT rebound 
(discussed in Sections III.F and III.H). 
Total program impacts on criteria and 
toxics emissions are discussed below, 
followed by individual discussions of 
the upstream and downstream impacts. 
Those are followed by discussions of the 
effects on air quality, health, and other 
environmental concerns. 
As discussed in Chapter 5 of the 
DRIA, the impacts presented here are 
only from petroleum (i.e., EPA assumes 
that total volumes of ethanol and other 
renewable fuels will remain unchanged 
due to this program). Ethanol use was 
modeled at the volumes projected in 
AEO2007 for the reference and control 
case; thus no changes are projected in 
upstream emissions related to ethanol 
production and distribution. However, 
due to the decreased gasoline volume 
associated with this proposal, a greater 
market share of E10 is expected relative 
to E0, which would be expected to have 
some effect on fleetwide average non- 
GHG emission rates. This effect, which 
is likely small relative to the other 
effects considered here, has not been 
accounted for in the downstream 
emission modeling conducted for this 
proposal, but EPA does plan to address 
it in the final rule air quality analysis, 
for which localized impacts could be 
more significant. A more comprehensive 
analysis of the impacts of different

ethanol and gasoline volume scenarios 
is being prepared as part of EPA’s RFS2 
rulemaking package.233 
As shown in Table III.G–1, EPA 
estimates that this program would result 
in reductions of NOX, VOC, PM and 
SOX, but would increase CO emissions. 
For NOX, VOC, PM and SOX, we 
estimate net reductions in criteria 
pollutant emissions because the 
emissions reductions from upstream 
sources are larger than the emission 
increases due to additional driving (i.e., 
the ‘‘rebound effect’’). In the case of CO, 
we estimate slight emission increases, 
because there are relatively small 
reductions in upstream emissions, and 
thus the projected emission increases 
due to additional driving are greater 
than the projected emission decreases 
due to reduced fuel production. EPA 
estimates that the proposed program 
would result in small changes for toxic 
emissions compared to total U.S. 
inventories across all sectors. For all 
pollutants the overall impact of the 
program would be relatively small 
compared to total U.S. inventories 
across all sectors. In 2030 EPA estimates 
the proposed program would reduce 
these total NOX, PM and SOX 
inventories by 0.2 to 0.3 percent and 
reduce the VOC inventory by 1.2 
percent, while increasing the total 
national CO inventory by 0.4 percent. 
As shown in Table III.G–2, EPA 
estimates that the proposed program 
would result in small changes for toxic 
emissions compared to total U.S. 
inventories across all sectors. In 2030 
EPA estimates the program would 
reduce total benzene and formaldehyde 
by 0.04 percent. Total acrolein, 
acetaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene would 
increase by 0.03 to 0.2 percent. 
Other factors which may impact non- 
GHG emissions, but are not estimated in 
this analysis, include: 
• Vehicle technologies used to reduce 
tailpipe CO2 emissions; because the 
regulatory standards for non-GHG 
emissions are the primary driver for 
these emissions, EPA expects the impact 
of this program to be negligible on non- 
GHG emission rates per mile. 
• The potential for increased market 
penetration of diesel vehicles; because 
these vehicles would be held to the 
same certification and in-use standards 
for criteria pollutants as their gasoline 
counterparts, EPA expects their impact 
to be negligible on criteria pollutants 
and other non-GHG emissions. 
• Early introduction of electric 
vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles, which would reduce criteria 
emissions in cases where they are able 
to certify to lower certification 
standards. It would also likely reduce 
gaseous air toxics. 
• Reduced refueling emissions due to 
less frequent refueling events and 
reduced annual refueling volumes 
resulting from the GHG standards. 
• Increased hot soak evaporative 
emissions due to the likely increase in 
number of trips associated with VMT 
rebound modeled in this proposal. 
• Increased market share of E10 
relative to E0 due to the decreased 
overall gasoline consumption of this 
proposal combined with an unchanged 
fuel ethanol volume. 
EPA invites comments on the possible 
contribution of these factors to non-GHG 
emissions.

1. Upstream Impacts of Program 
Reducing tailpipe CO2 emissions from 
light-duty cars and trucks through 
tailpipe standards and improved A/C 
efficiency will result in reduced fuel 
demand and reductions in the emissions 
associated with all of the processes 
involved in getting petroleum to the 
pump. These upstream emission 
impacts on criteria pollutants are 
summarized in Table III.G–1. The 
upstream reductions grow over time as 
the fleet turns over to cleaner CO2 
vehicles, so that by 2030 VOC would 
decrease by 148,000 tons, NOX by 
43,000 tons, and PM2.5 by 6,000 tons. 
Table III.G–2 shows the corresponding 
impacts on upstream air toxic emissions 
in 2030. Formaldehyde decreases by 112 
tons, benzene by 320 tons, acetaldehyde 
by 15 tons, acrolein by 2 tons, and 1,3- 
butadiene by 3 tons. 
To determine these impacts, EPA 
estimated the impact of reduced 
petroleum volumes on the extraction 
and transportation of crude oil as well 
as the production and distribution of 
finished gasoline. For the purpose of 
assessing domestic-only emission 
reductions it was necessary to estimate 
the fraction of fuel savings attributable 
to domestic finished gasoline, and of 
this gasoline what fraction is produced 
from domestic crude. For this analysis 
EPA estimated that 50 percent of fuel 
savings is attributable to domestic 
finished gasoline and that 90 percent of 
this gasoline originated from imported 
crude. Emission factors for most 
upstream emission sources are based on 
the GREET1.8 model, developed by 
DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory,234 
but in some cases the GREET values 
were modified or updated by EPA to be 
consistent with the National Emission 
Inventory (NEI).235 The primary updates 
for this analysis were to incorporate 
newer information on gasoline 
distribution emissions for VOC from the 
NEI, which were significantly higher 
than GREET estimates; and the 
incorporation of upstream emission 
factors for the air toxics estimated in 
this analysis: benzene, 1,3-butadiene, 
acetaldehyde, acrolein, and

the EPA is considering all available science on PM 
health effects, including information which has 
been published since 2004, in the development of 
the upcoming PM Integrated Science Assessment 
Document (ISA). A second draft of the PM ISA was 
completed in July 2009 and was submitted for 
review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory 
Committee (CASAC) of EPA’s Science Advisory 
Board. Comments from the general public have also 
been requested. For more information, see http://

206. 
241 This study is included in the 2006 Provisional 
Assessment of Recent Studies on Health Effects of 
Particulate Matter Exposure. The provisional 
assessment did not and could not (given a very 
short timeframe) undergo the extensive critical 
review by CASAC and the public, as did the PM 
AQCD. The provisional assessment found that the 
‘‘new’’ studies expand the scientific information 
and provide important insights on the relationship 
between PM exposure and health effects of PM. The 
provisional assessment also found that ‘‘new’’ 
studies generally strengthen the evidence that acute 
and chronic exposure to fine particles and acute 
exposure to thoracic coarse particles are associated 
with health effects. Further, the provisional science 
assessment found that the results reported in the 
studies did not dramatically diverge from previous 
findings, and taken in context with the findings of 
the AQCD, the new information and findings did 
not materially change any of the broad scientific 
conclusions regarding the health effects of PM 
exposure made in the AQCD. However, it is 
important to note that this assessment was limited 
to screening, surveying, and preparing a provisional 
assessment of these studies. For reasons outlined in 
Section I.C of the preamble for the final PM NAAQS 
rulemaking in 2006 (see 71 FR 61148–49, October 
17, 2006), EPA based its NAAQS decision on the 
science presented in the 2004 AQCD. 
formaldehyde. The development of 
these emission factors is detailed in 
DRIA Chapter 5. 
2. Downstream Impacts of Program 
As discussed in more detail in Section 
III.H, the effect of fuel cost on VMT 
(‘‘rebound’’) was accounted for in our 
assessment of economic and 
environmental impacts of this proposed 
rule. A 10 percent rebound case was 
used for this analysis, meaning that 
VMT for affected model years is 
modeled as increasing by 10 percent as 
much as the increase in fuel economy; 
i.e., a 10 percent increase in fuel 
economy would yield a 1.0 percent 
increase in VMT. 
Downstream emission impacts of the 
rebound effect are summarized in Table 
III.G–1 for criteria pollutants and 
precursors and Table III.G–2 for air 
toxics. The emission increases from the 
rebound effect grow over time as the 
fleet turns over to cleaner CO2 vehicles, 
so that by 2030 VOC would increase by 
5,500 tons, NOX by 16,000 tons, and 
PM2.5 by 570 tons. Table III.G–2 shows 
the corresponding impacts on air toxic 
emissions. The most noteworthy of 
these impacts in 2030 are 40 additional 
tons of 1,3-butadiene, 75 tons of 
acetaldehyde, 240 tons of benzene, 96 
tons of formaldehyde, and 4 tons of 
acrolein. 
For this analysis the reference case 
non-GHG emissions for light duty 
vehicles and trucks were derived using 
EPA’s MOtor Vehicle Emission 
Simulator (MOVES) model for VOC, CO, 
NOX, PM and air toxics. PM2.5 emission 
estimates include additional 
adjustments for low temperatures, 
discussed in detail in the DRIA. Because 
this modeling was based on calendar 
year estimates, estimating the rebound 
effect required a fleet-weighted rebound 
factor to be calculated for calendar years 
2020 and 2030; these factors are 
presented in DRIA Chapter 5. 
As discussed in Section III.H, EPA 
will be taking comment on the 
appropriate level of rebound rate for this 
analysis. The sensitivity of the 
downstream emission increases shown 
in Tables III.G–1 and III.G–2 to the level 
of rebound would be in direct 
proportion to the rebound rate itself; 
since zero rebound would result in zero 
emission increase, the downstream 
results presented in Table III.G–1 and 
Table III.G–2 can be directly scaled to 
estimate the effect of lower rebound 
rates. 
3. Health Effects of Non-GHG Pollutants 
a. Particulate Matter 
i. Background 
Particulate matter is a generic term for 
a broad class of chemically and 
physically diverse substances. It can be 
principally characterized as discrete 
particles that exist in the condensed 
(liquid or solid) phase spanning several 
orders of magnitude in size. Since 1987, 
EPA has delineated that subset of 
inhalable particles small enough to 
penetrate to the thoracic region 
(including the tracheobronchial and 
alveolar regions) of the respiratory tract 
(referred to as thoracic particles). 
Current NAAQS use PM2.5 as the 
indicator for fine particles (with PM2.5 
referring to particles with a nominal 
mean aerodynamic diameter less than or 
equal to 2.5 μm), and use PM10 as the 
indicator for purposes of regulating the 
coarse fraction of PM10 (referred to as 
thoracic coarse particles or coarse- 
fraction particles; generally including 
particles with a nominal mean 
aerodynamic diameter greater than 2.5 
μm and less than or equal to 10 μm, or 
PM10–2.5). Ultrafine particles are a subset 
of fine particles, generally less than 100 
nanometers (0.1 μm) in aerodynamic 
diameter. 
Fine particles are produced primarily 
by combustion processes and by 
transformations of gaseous emissions 
(e.g., SOX, NOX and VOC) in the 
atmosphere. The chemical and physical 
properties of PM2.5 may vary greatly 
with time, region, meteorology, and 
source category. Thus, PM2.5 may 
include a complex mixture of different 
pollutants including sulfates, nitrates, 
organic compounds, elemental carbon 
and metal compounds. These particles 
can remain in the atmosphere for days 
to weeks and travel hundreds to 
thousands of kilometers. 
ii. Health Effects of PM 
Scientific studies show ambient PM is 
associated with a series of adverse 
health effects. These health effects are 
discussed in detail in EPA’s 2004 
Particulate Matter Air Quality Criteria 
Document (PM AQCD) and the 2005 PM 
Staff Paper. 236 237 238 Further discussion 
of health effects associated with PM can 
also be found in the DRIA for this rule. 
Health effects associated with short- 
term exposures (hours to days) to 
ambient PM include premature 
mortality, aggravation of cardiovascular 
and lung disease (as indicated by 
increased hospital admissions and 
emergency department visits), increased 
respiratory symptoms including cough 
and difficulty breathing, decrements in 
lung function, altered heart rate rhythm, 
and other more subtle changes in blood 
markers related to cardiovascular 
health.239 Long-term exposure to PM2.5 
and sulfates has also been associated 
with mortality from cardiopulmonary 
disease and lung cancer, and effects on 
the respiratory system such as reduced 
lung function growth or development of 
respiratory disease. A new analysis 
shows an association between long-term 
PM2.5 exposure and a measure of 
atherosclerosis development.240 241

exposed over the long term (one or more 
years) to different levels of air pollution,

b. Ozone 
i. Background 
Ground-level ozone pollution is 
typically formed by the reaction of VOC 
and NOX in the lower atmosphere in the 
presence of heat and sunlight. These 
pollutants, often referred to as ozone 
precursors, are emitted by many types of 
pollution sources, such as highway and 
nonroad motor vehicles and engines, 
power plants, chemical plants, 
refineries, makers of consumer and 
commercial products, industrial 
facilities, and smaller area sources. 
The science of ozone formation, 
transport, and accumulation is 
complex.246 Ground-level ozone is 
produced and destroyed in a cyclical set 
of chemical reactions, many of which 
are sensitive to temperature and 
sunlight. When ambient temperatures 
and sunlight levels remain high for 
several days and the air is relatively 
stagnant, ozone and its precursors can 
build up and result in more ozone than 
typically occurs on a single high- 
temperature day. Ozone can be 
transported hundreds of miles 
downwind of precursor emissions, 
resulting in elevated ozone levels even 
in areas with low local VOC or NOX 
emissions. 
ii. Health Effects of Ozone 
The health and welfare effects of 
ozone are well documented and are 
assessed in EPA’s 2006 Air Quality 
Criteria Document (ozone AQCD) and 
2007 Staff Paper.247 248 Ozone can 
irritate the respiratory system, causing 
coughing, throat irritation, and/or 
uncomfortable sensation in the chest. 
Ozone can reduce lung function and 
make it more difficult to breathe deeply; 
breathing may also become more rapid 
and shallow than normal, thereby 
limiting a person’s activity. Ozone can 
also aggravate asthma, leading to more 
asthma attacks that require medical 
attention and/or the use of additional 
medication. In addition, there is 
suggestive evidence of a contribution of 
ozone to cardiovascular-related 
morbidity and highly suggestive 
evidence that short-term ozone exposure 
directly or indirectly contributes to non- 
accidental and cardiopulmonary-related 
mortality, but additional research is 
needed to clarify the underlying 
mechanisms causing these effects. In a 
recent report on the estimation of ozone- 
related premature mortality published 
by the National Research Council (NRC), 
a panel of experts and reviewers 
concluded that short-term exposure to 
ambient ozone is likely to contribute to 
premature deaths and that ozone-related 
mortality should be included in 
estimates of the health benefits of 
reducing ozone exposure.249 Animal 
toxicological evidence indicates that 
with repeated exposure, ozone can 
inflame and damage the lining of the 
lungs, which may lead to permanent 
changes in lung tissue and irreversible 
reductions in lung function. People who 
are more susceptible to effects 
associated with exposure to ozone can 
include children, the elderly, and 
individuals with respiratory disease 
such as asthma. Those with greater 
exposures to ozone, for instance due to 
time spent outdoors (e.g., children and 
outdoor workers), are of particular 
concern. 
The 2006 ozone AQCD also examined 
relevant new scientific information that 
has emerged in the past decade, 
including the impact of ozone exposure 
on such health effects as changes in 
lung structure and biochemistry, 
inflammation of the lungs, exacerbation 
and causation of asthma, respiratory 
illness-related school absence, hospital 
admissions and premature mortality. 
Animal toxicological studies have 
suggested potential interactions between 
ozone and PM with increased responses 
observed to mixtures of the two 
pollutants compared to either ozone or 
PM alone. The respiratory morbidity 
observed in animal studies along with 
the evidence from epidemiologic studies 
supports a causal relationship between 
acute ambient ozone exposures and 
increased respiratory-related emergency 
room visits and hospitalizations in the 
warm season. In addition, there is 
suggestive evidence of a contribution of 
ozone to cardiovascular-related 
morbidity and non-accidental and 
cardiopulmonary mortality. 
c. NOX and SOX 
i. Background 
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a member of 
the NOX family of gases. Most NO2 is 
formed in the air through the oxidation 
of nitric oxide (NO) emitted when fuel 
is burned at a high temperature. SO2, a 
member of the sulfur oxide (SOX) family 
of gases, is formed from burning fuels 
containing sulfur (e.g., coal or oil 
derived), extracting gasoline from oil, or 
extracting metals from ore. 
SO2 and NO2 can dissolve in water 
vapor and further oxidize to form 
sulfuric and nitric acid which react with 
ammonia to form sulfates and nitrates, 
both of which are important 
components of ambient PM. The health 
effects of ambient PM are discussed in 
Section III.G.3.a of this preamble. NOX 
along with non-methane hydrocarbon 
(NMHC) are the two major precursors of 
ozone. The health effects of ozone are 
covered in Section III.G.3.b.

NO2 can be found in the U.S.

exposure, and animal toxicological 
studies provide evidence that is 
sufficient to infer a likely causal 
relationship between respiratory effects 
and short-term NO2 exposure. The ISA 
concludes that the strongest evidence 
for such a relationship comes from 
epidemiologic studies of respiratory 
effects including symptoms, emergency 
department visits, and hospital 
admissions. The ISA also draws two 
broad conclusions regarding airway 
responsiveness following NO2 exposure. 
First, the ISA concludes that NO2 
exposure may enhance the sensitivity to 
allergen-induced decrements in lung 
function and increase the allergen- 
induced airway inflammatory response 
at exposures as low as 0.26 ppm NO2 for 
30 minutes. Second, exposure to NO2 
has been found to enhance the inherent 
responsiveness of the airway to 
subsequent nonspecific challenges in 
controlled human exposure studies of 
asthmatic subjects. Enhanced airway 
responsiveness could have important 
clinical implications for asthmatics 
since transient increases in airway 
responsiveness following NO2 exposure 
have the potential to increase symptoms 
and worsen asthma control. Together, 
the epidemiologic and experimental 
data sets form a plausible, consistent, 
and coherent description of a 
relationship between NO2 exposures 
and an array of adverse health effects 
that range from the onset of respiratory 
symptoms to hospital admission. 
Although the weight of evidence 
supporting a causal relationship is 
somewhat less certain than that 
associated with respiratory morbidity, 
NO2 has also been linked to other health 
endpoints. These include all-cause 
(nonaccidental) mortality, hospital 
admissions or emergency department 
visits for cardiovascular disease, and 
decrements in lung function growth 
associated with chronic exposure. 
iii. Health Effects of SO2 
Information on the health effects of 
SO2 can be found in the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency 
Integrated Science Assessment for 
Sulfur Oxides.251 SO2 has long been 
known to cause adverse respiratory 
health effects, particularly among 
individuals with asthma. Other 
potentially sensitive groups include 
children and the elderly. During periods 
of elevated ventilation, asthmatics may 
experience symptomatic 
bronchoconstriction within minutes of 
exposure. Following an extensive 
evaluation of health evidence from 
epidemiologic and laboratory studies, 
the EPA has concluded that there is a 
causal relationship between respiratory 
health effects and short-term exposure 
to SO2. Separately, based on an 
evaluation of the epidemiologic 
evidence of associations between short- 
term exposure to SO2 and mortality, the 
EPA has concluded that the overall 
evidence is suggestive of a causal 
relationship between short-term 
exposure to SO2 and mortality. 
d. Carbon Monoxide 
Carbon monoxide (CO) forms as a 
result of incomplete fuel combustion. 
CO enters the bloodstream through the 
lungs, forming carboxyhemoglobin and 
reducing the delivery of oxygen to the 
body’s organs and tissues. The health 
threat from CO is most serious for those 
who suffer from cardiovascular disease, 
particularly those with angina or 
peripheral vascular disease. Healthy 
individuals also are affected, but only at 
higher CO levels. Exposure to elevated 
CO levels is associated with impairment 
of visual perception, work capacity, 
manual dexterity, learning ability and 
performance of complex tasks. Carbon 
monoxide also contributes to ozone 
nonattainment since carbon monoxide 
reacts photochemically in the 
atmosphere to form ozone.252 
Additional information on CO related 
health effects can be found in the 
Carbon Monoxide Air Quality Criteria 
Document (CO AQCD).253 254 
e. Air Toxics 
Motor vehicle emissions contribute to 
ambient levels of air toxics known or 
suspected as human or animal 
carcinogens, or that have noncancer 
health effects. The population 
experiences an elevated risk of cancer 
and other noncancer health effects from 
exposure to air toxics. 255 These 
compounds include, but are not limited 
to, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, 
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, 
polycyclic organic matter (POM), and 
naphthalene. These compounds, except 
acetaldehyde, were identified as 
national or regional risk drivers in the 
2002 National-scale Air Toxics 
Assessment (NATA) and have 
significant inventory contributions from 
mobile sources.256 Emissions and 
ambient concentrations of compounds 
are discussed in the DRIA chapter on 
emission inventories and air quality 
(Chapters 5 and 7, respectively). 
i. Benzene 
The EPA’s IRIS database lists benzene 
as a known human carcinogen (causing 
leukemia) by all routes of exposure, and 
concludes that exposure is associated 
with additional health effects, including 
genetic changes in both humans and 
animals and increased proliferation of 
bone marrow cells in mice.257 258 259 EPA 
states in its IRIS database that data 
indicate a causal relationship between 
benzene exposure and acute 
lymphocytic leukemia and suggest a 
relationship between benzene exposure 
and chronic non-lymphocytic leukemia 
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The 
International Agency for Research on 
Carcinogens (IARC) has determined that 
benzene is a human carcinogen and the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS) has characterized 
benzene as a known human 
carcinogen.260 261 
A number of adverse noncancer 
health effects including blood disorders, 
such as preleukemia and aplastic 
anemia, have also been associated with

long-term exposure to benzene.262 263 
The most sensitive noncancer effect 
observed in humans, based on current 
data, is the depression of the absolute 
lymphocyte count in blood.264 265 In 
addition, recent work, including studies 
sponsored by the Health Effects Institute 
(HEI), provides evidence that 
biochemical responses are occurring at 
lower levels of benzene exposure than 
previously know 266 267 268 269 EPA’s IRIS 
program has not yet evaluated these 
new data. 
ii. 1,3-Butadiene 
EPA has characterized 1,3-butadiene 
as carcinogenic to humans by 
inhalation.270 271 The IARC has 
determined that 1,3-butadiene is a 
human carcinogen and the U.S. DHHS 
has characterized 1,3-butadiene as a 
known human carcinogen.272 273 There 
are numerous studies consistently 
demonstrating that 1,3-butadiene is 
metabolized into genotoxic metabolites 
by experimental animals and humans. 
The specific mechanisms of 1,3- 
butadiene-induced carcinogenesis are 
unknown; however, the scientific 
evidence strongly suggests that the 
carcinogenic effects are mediated by 
genotoxic metabolites. Animal data 
suggest that females may be more 
sensitive than males for cancer effects 
associated with 1,3-butadiene exposure; 
there are insufficient data in humans 
from which to draw conclusions about 
sensitive subpopulations. 1,3-butadiene 
also causes a variety of reproductive and 
developmental effects in mice; no 
human data on these effects are 
available. The most sensitive effect was 
ovarian atrophy observed in a lifetime 
bioassay of female mice.274 
iii. Formaldehyde 
Since 1987, EPA has classified 
formaldehyde as a probable human 
carcinogen based on evidence in 
humans and in rats, mice, hamsters, and 
monkeys.275 EPA is currently reviewing 
recently published epidemiological 
data. For instance, research conducted 
by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
found an increased risk of 
nasopharyngeal cancer and 
lymphohematopoietic malignancies 
such as leukemia among workers 
exposed to formaldehyde.276 277 In an 
analysis of the lymphohematopoietic 
cancer mortality from an extended 
follow-up of these workers, NCI 
confirmed an association between 
lymphohematopoietic cancer risk and 
peak exposures.278 A recent National 
Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH) study of garment 
workers also found increased risk of 
death due to leukemia among workers 
exposed to formaldehyde.279 Extended 
follow-up of a cohort of British chemical 
workers did not find evidence of an 
increase in nasopharyngeal or 
lymphohematopoietic cancers, but a 
continuing statistically significant 
excess in lung cancers was reported.280 
Recently, the IARC re-classified 
formaldehyde as a human carcinogen 
(Group 1).281 
Formaldehyde exposure also causes a 
range of noncancer health effects, 
including irritation of the eyes (burning 
and watering of the eyes), nose and 
throat. Effects from repeated exposure in 
humans include respiratory tract 
irritation, chronic bronchitis and nasal 
epithelial lesions such as metaplasia 
and loss of cilia. Animal studies suggest 
that formaldehyde may also cause 
airway inflammation—including 
eosinophil infiltration into the airways. 
There are several studies that suggest 
that formaldehyde may increase the risk 
of asthma—particularly in the 
young.282 283 
iv. Acetaldehyde 
Acetaldehyde is classified in EPA’s 
IRIS database as a probable human 
carcinogen, based on nasal tumors in 
rats, and is considered toxic by the 
inhalation, oral, and intravenous 
routes.284 Acetaldehyde is reasonably 
anticipated to be a human carcinogen by 
the U.S. DHHS in the 11th Report on 
Carcinogens and is classified as possibly 
carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) by

the IARC.285 286 EPA is currently 
conducting a reassessment of cancer risk 
from inhalation exposure to 
acetaldehyde. The primary noncancer 
effects of exposure to acetaldehyde 
vapors include irritation of the eyes, 
skin, and respiratory tract.287 In short- 
term (4 week) rat studies, degeneration 
of olfactory epithelium was observed at 
various concentration levels of 
acetaldehyde exposure.288 289 Data from 
these studies were used by EPA to 
develop an inhalation reference 
concentration. Some asthmatics have 
been shown to be a sensitive 
subpopulation to decrements in 
functional expiratory volume (FEV1 
test) and bronchoconstriction upon 
acetaldehyde inhalation.290 The agency 
is currently conducting a reassessment 
of the health hazards from inhalation 
exposure to acetaldehyde. 
v. Acrolein 
Acrolein is extremely acrid and 
irritating to humans when inhaled, with 
acute exposure resulting in upper 
respiratory tract irritation, mucus 
hypersecretion and congestion. Levels 
considerably lower than 1 ppm (2.3 mg/ 
m3) elicit subjective complaints of eye 
and nasal irritation and a decrease in 
the respiratory rate.291 292 Lesions to the 
lungs and upper respiratory tract of rats, 
rabbits, and hamsters have been 
observed after subchronic exposure to 
acrolein. Based on animal data, 
individuals with compromised 
respiratory function (e.g., emphysema, 
asthma) are expected to be at increased 
risk of developing adverse responses to 
strong respiratory irritants such as 
acrolein. This was demonstrated in mice 
with allergic airway-disease by 
comparison to non-diseased mice in a 
study of the acute respiratory irritant 
effects of acrolein.293 The intense 
irritancy of this carbonyl has been 
demonstrated during controlled tests in 
human subjects, who suffer intolerable 
eye and nasal mucosal sensory reactions 
within minutes of exposure.294 
EPA determined in 2003 that the 
human carcinogenic potential of 
acrolein could not be determined 
because the available data were 
inadequate. No information was 
available on the carcinogenic effects of 
acrolein in humans and the animal data 
provided inadequate evidence of 
carcinogenicity.295 The IARC 
determined in 1995 that acrolein was 
not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity 
in humans.296 
vi. Polycyclic Organic Matter (POM) 
POM is generally defined as a large 
class of organic compounds which have 
multiple benzene rings and a boiling 
point greater than 100 degrees Celsius. 
Many of the compounds included in the 
class of compounds known as POM are 
classified by EPA as probable human 
carcinogens based on animal data. One 
of these compounds, naphthalene, is 
discussed separately below. Polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a 
subset of POM that contain only 
hydrogen and carbon atoms. A number 
of PAHs are known or suspected 
carcinogens. Recent studies have found 
that maternal exposures to PAHs (a 
subclass of POM) in a population of 
pregnant women were associated with 
several adverse birth outcomes, 
including low birth weight and reduced 
length at birth, as well as impaired 
cognitive development at age 
three.297 298 EPA has not yet evaluated 
these recent studies. 
vii. Naphthalene 
Naphthalene is found in small 
quantities in gasoline and diesel fuels. 
Naphthalene emissions have been 
measured in larger quantities in both 
gasoline and diesel exhaust compared 
with evaporative emissions from mobile 
sources, indicating it is primarily a 
product of combustion. EPA released an 
external review draft of a reassessment 
of the inhalation carcinogenicity of 
naphthalene based on a number of 
recent animal carcinogenicity 
studies.299 The draft reassessment 
completed external peer review.300 
Based on external peer review 
comments received, additional analyses 
are being undertaken. This external 
review draft does not represent official 
agency opinion and was released solely 
for the purposes of external peer review 
and public comment. Once EPA 
evaluates public and peer reviewer 
comments, the document will be 
revised. The National Toxicology 
Program listed naphthalene as 
‘‘reasonably anticipated to be a human 
carcinogen’’ in 2004 on the basis of 
bioassays reporting clear evidence of 
carcinogenicity in rats and some 
evidence of carcinogenicity in mice.301 
California EPA has released a new risk 
assessment for naphthalene, and the 
IARC has reevaluated naphthalene and 
re-classified it as Group 2B: possibly 
carcinogenic to humans.302 Naphthalene 
also causes a number of chronic non- 
cancer effects in animals, including

viii. Other Air Toxics 
In addition to the compounds 
described above, other compounds in 
gaseous hydrocarbon and PM emissions 
from vehicles will be affected by this 
proposed action. Mobile source air toxic 
compounds that would potentially be 
impacted include ethylbenzene, 
polycyclic organic matter, 
propionaldehyde, toluene, and xylene. 
Information regarding the health effects 
of these compounds can be found in 
EPA’s IRIS database.304 
4. Environmental Effects of Non-GHG 
Pollutants 
a. Visibility 
Visibility can be defined as the degree 
to which the atmosphere is transparent 
to visible light. Airborne particles 
degrade visibility by scattering and 
absorbing light. Visibility is important 
because it has direct significance to 
people’s enjoyment of daily activities in 
all parts of the country. Individuals 
value good visibility for the well-being 
it provides them directly, where they 
live and work and in places where they 
enjoy recreational opportunities. 
Visibility is also highly valued in 
significant natural areas such as 
national parks and wilderness areas and 
special emphasis is given to protecting 
visibility in these areas. For more 
information on visibility, see the final 
2004 PM AQCD as well as the 2005 PM 
Staff Paper.305 306 
EPA is pursuing a two-part strategy to 
address visibility. First, to address the 
welfare effects of PM on visibility, EPA 
has set secondary PM2.5 standards 
which act in conjunction with the 
establishment of a regional haze 
program. In setting this secondary 
standard, EPA has concluded that PM2.5 
causes adverse effects on visibility in 
various locations, depending on PM 
concentrations and factors such as 
chemical composition and average 
relative humidity. Second, section 169 
of the Clean Air Act provides additional 
authority to address existing visibility 
impairment and prevent future visibility 
impairment in the 156 national parks, 
forests and wilderness areas categorized 
as mandatory class I Federal areas (62 
FR 38680–81, July 18, 1997).307 In July 
1999, the regional haze rule (64 FR 
35714) was put in place to protect the 
visibility in mandatory class I Federal 
areas. Visibility can be said to be 
impaired in both PM2.5 nonattainment 
areas and mandatory class I Federal 
areas. 
b. Plant and Ecosystem Effects of Ozone 
Elevated ozone levels contribute to 
environmental effects, with impacts to 
plants and ecosystems being of most 
concern. Ozone can produce both acute 
and chronic injury in sensitive species 
depending on the concentration level 
and the duration of the exposure. Ozone 
effects also tend to accumulate over the 
growing season of the plant, so that even 
low concentrations experienced for a 
longer duration have the potential to 
create chronic stress on vegetation. 
Ozone damage to plants includes visible 
injury to leaves and impaired 
photosynthesis, both of which can lead 
to reduced plant growth and 
reproduction, resulting in reduced crop 
yields, forestry production, and use of 
sensitive ornamentals in landscaping. In 
addition, the impairment of 
photosynthesis, the process by which 
the plant makes carbohydrates (its 
source of energy and food), can lead to 
a subsequent reduction in root growth 
and carbohydrate storage below ground, 
resulting in other, more subtle plant and 
ecosystems impacts. 
These latter impacts include 
increased susceptibility of plants to 
insect attack, disease, harsh weather, 
interspecies competition and overall 
decreased plant vigor. The adverse 
effects of ozone on forest and other 
natural vegetation can potentially lead 
to species shifts and loss from the 
affected ecosystems, resulting in a loss 
or reduction in associated ecosystem 
goods and services. Lastly, visible ozone 
injury to leaves can result in a loss of 
aesthetic value in areas of special scenic 
significance like national parks and 
wilderness areas. The final 2006 ozone 
AQCD presents more detailed 
information on ozone effects on 
vegetation and ecosystems. 
c. Atmospheric Deposition 
Wet and dry deposition of ambient 
particulate matter delivers a complex 
mixture of metals (e.g., mercury, zinc, 
lead, nickel, aluminum, cadmium), 
organic compounds (e.g., POM, dioxins, 
furans) and inorganic compounds (e.g., 
nitrate, sulfate) to terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems. The chemical form of the 
compounds deposited depends on a 
variety of factors including ambient 
conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, 
oxidant levels) and the sources of the 
material. Chemical and physical 
transformations of the compounds occur 
in the atmosphere as well as the media 
onto which they deposit. These 
transformations in turn influence the 
fate, bioavailability and potential 
toxicity of these compounds. 
Atmospheric deposition has been 
identified as a key component of the 
environmental and human health 
hazard posed by several pollutants 
including mercury, dioxin and PCBs.308 
Adverse impacts on water quality can 
occur when atmospheric contaminants 
deposit to the water surface or when 
material deposited on the land enters a 
water body through runoff. Potential 
impacts of atmospheric deposition to 
water bodies include those related to 
both nutrient and toxic inputs. Adverse 
effects to human health and welfare can 
occur from the addition of excess 
nitrogen via atmospheric deposition. 
The nitrogen-nutrient enrichment 
contributes to toxic algae blooms and 
zones of depleted oxygen, which can 
lead to fish kills, frequently in coastal 
waters. Deposition of heavy metals or 
other toxins may lead to the human 
ingestion of contaminated fish, human 
ingestion of contaminated water, 
damage to the marine ecology, and 
limits to recreational uses. Several 
studies have been conducted in U.S. 
coastal waters and in the Great Lakes 
Region in which the role of ambient PM 
deposition and runoff is 
investigated.309 310 311 312 313

Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen 
and sulfur contributes to acidification, 
altering biogeochemistry and affecting 
animal and plant life in terrestrial and 
aquatic ecosystems across the U.S. The 
sensitivity of terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems to acidification from 
nitrogen and sulfur deposition is 
predominantly governed by geology. 
Prolonged exposure to excess nitrogen 
and sulfur deposition in sensitive areas 
acidifies lakes, rivers and soils. 
Increased acidity in surface waters 
creates inhospitable conditions for biota 
and affects the abundance and 
nutritional value of preferred prey 
species, threatening biodiversity and 
ecosystem function. Over time, 
acidifying deposition also removes 
essential nutrients from forest soils, 
depleting the capacity of soils to 
neutralize future acid loadings and 
negatively affecting forest sustainability. 
Major effects include a decline in 
sensitive forest tree species, such as red 
spruce (Picea rubens) and sugar maple 
(Acer saccharum), and a loss of 
biodiversity of fishes, zooplankton, and 
macro invertebrates. 
In addition to the role nitrogen 
deposition plays in acidification, 
nitrogen deposition also causes 
ecosystem nutrient enrichment leading 
to eutrophication that alters 
biogeochemical cycles. Excess nitrogen 
also leads to the loss of nitrogen 
sensitive lichen species as they are 
outcompeted by invasive grasses as well 
as altering the biodiversity of terrestrial 
ecosystems, such as grasslands and 
meadows. For a broader explanation of 
the topics treated here, refer to the 
description in Chapter 7 of the DRIA. 
Adverse impacts on soil chemistry 
and plant life have been observed for 
areas heavily influenced by atmospheric 
deposition of nutrients, metals and acid 
species, resulting in species shifts, loss 
of biodiversity, forest decline and 
damage to forest productivity. Potential 
impacts also include adverse effects to 
human health through ingestion of 
contaminated vegetation or livestock (as 
in the case for dioxin deposition), 
reduction in crop yield, and limited use 
of land due to contamination. 
Atmospheric deposition of pollutants 
can reduce the aesthetic appeal of 
buildings and culturally important 
articles through soiling, and can 
contribute directly (or in conjunction 
with other pollutants) to structural 
damage by means of corrosion or 
erosion. Atmospheric deposition may 
affect materials principally by 
promoting and accelerating the 
corrosion of metals, by degrading paints, 
and by deteriorating building materials 
such as concrete and limestone. 
Particles contribute to these effects 
because of their electrolytic, 
hygroscopic, and acidic properties, and 
their ability to adsorb corrosive gases 
(principally sulfur dioxide). The rate of 
metal corrosion depends on a number of 
factors, including the deposition rate 
and nature of the pollutant; the 
influence of the metal protective 
corrosion film; the amount of moisture 
present; variability in the 
electrochemical reactions; the presence 
and concentration of other surface 
electrolytes; and the orientation of the 
metal surface. 
d. Environmental Effects of Air Toxics 
Fuel combustion emissions contribute 
to ambient levels of pollutants that 
contribute to adverse effects on 
vegetation. Volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), some of which are considered 
air toxics, have long been suspected to 
play a role in vegetation damage.314 In 
laboratory experiments, a wide range of 
tolerance to VOCs has been observed.315 
Decreases in harvested seed pod weight 
have been reported for the more 
sensitive plants, and some studies have 
reported effects on seed germination, 
flowering and fruit ripening. Effects of 
individual VOCs or their role in 
conjunction with other stressors (e.g., 
acidification, drought, temperature 
extremes) have not been well studied. In 
a recent study of a mixture of VOCs 
including ethanol and toluene on 
herbaceous plants, significant effects on 
seed production, leaf water content and 
photosynthetic efficiency were reported 
for some plant species.316 
Research suggests an adverse impact 
of vehicle exhaust on plants, which has 
in some cases been attributed to 
aromatic compounds and in other cases 
to nitrogen oxides.317 318 319 The impacts 
of VOCs on plant reproduction may 
have long-term implications for 
biodiversity and survival of native 
species near major roadways. Most of 
the studies of the impacts of VOCs on 
vegetation have focused on short-term 
exposure and few studies have focused 
on long-term effects of VOCs on 
vegetation and the potential for 
metabolites of these compounds to 
affect herbivores or insects. 
5. Air Quality Impacts of Non-GHG 
Pollutants 
a. Current Levels of PM2.5, Ozone, CO 
and Air Toxics 
This proposal may have impacts on 
levels of PM2.5, ozone, CO and air toxics. 
Nationally, levels of PM2.5, ozone, CO 
and air toxics are declining.320 321 
However, in 2005 EPA designated 39 
nonattainment areas for the 1997 PM2.5 
National Ambient Air Quality Standard 
(NAAQS) (70 FR 943, January 5, 2005). 
These areas are composed of 208 full or 
partial counties with a total population 
exceeding 88 million. The 1997 PM2.5 
NAAQS was recently revised and the 
2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS became 
effective on December 18, 2006. The 
numbers above likely underestimate the 
number of counties that are not meeting 
the PM2.5 NAAQS because the 
nonattainment areas associated with the 
more stringent 2006 24-hour PM2.5 
NAAQS have not yet been designated. 
Area designations for the 2006 24-hour 
PM2.5 NAAQS are expected to be 
promulgated in 2009 and become 
effective 90 days after publication in the 
Federal Register. 
In addition, the U.S. EPA has recently 
amended the ozone NAAQS (73 FR 
16436, March 27, 2008). That final 2008 
ozone NAAQS rule set forth revisions to 
the previous 1997 NAAQS for ozone to 
provide increased protection of public 
health and welfare. As of June 5, 2009, 
there are 55 areas designated as

nonattainment for the 1997 8-hour 
ozone NAAQS, comprising 290 full or 
partial counties with a total population 
of approximately 132 million people. 
These numbers do not include the 
people living in areas where there is a 
future risk of failing to maintain or 
attain the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. 
The numbers above likely 
underestimate the number of counties 
that are not meeting the ozone NAAQS 
because the nonattainment areas 
associated with the more stringent 2008 
8-hour ozone NAAQS have not yet been 
designated. 
The proposed vehicle standards may 
also impact levels of ambient CO, a 
criteria pollutant (see Table III.G–1 
above for co-pollutant emission 
impacts). As of June 5, 2009 there are 
approximately 479,000 people living in 
a portion of Clark Co., NV which is 
currently the only area in the country 
that is designated as nonattainment for 
CO.322 
Further, the majority of Americans 
continue to be exposed to ambient 
concentrations of air toxics at levels 
which have the potential to cause 
adverse health effects.323 The levels of 
air toxics to which people are exposed 
vary depending on where people live 
and work and the kinds of activities in 
which they engage, as discussed in 
detail in U.S. EPA’s recent mobile 
source air toxics rule.324 
b. Impacts of Proposed Standards on 
Future Ambient PM2.5, Ozone, CO and 
Air Toxics 
Full-scale photochemical air quality 
modeling is necessary to accurately 
project levels of PM2.5, ozone, CO and 
air toxics. For the final rule, a national- 
scale air quality modeling analysis will 
be performed to analyze the impacts of 
the vehicle standards on PM2.5, ozone, 
and selected air toxics (i.e., benzene, 
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein 
and 1,3-butadiene). The length of time 
needed to prepare the necessary 
emissions inventories, in addition to the 
processing time associated with the 
modeling itself, has precluded us from 
performing air quality modeling for this 
proposal. 
Section III.G.1 of the preamble 
presents projections of the changes in 
criteria pollutant and air toxics 
emissions due to the proposed vehicle 
standards; the basis for those estimates 
is set out in Chapter 5 of the DRIA. The 
atmospheric chemistry related to 
ambient concentrations of PM2.5, ozone 
and air toxics is very complex, and 
making predictions based solely on 
emissions changes is extremely difficult. 
However, based on the magnitude of the 
emissions changes predicted to result 
from the proposed vehicle standards, 
EPA expects that there will be an 
improvement in ambient air quality, 
pending a more comprehensive analysis 
for the final rule. 
For the final rule, EPA intends to use 
a 2005-based Community Multi-scale 
Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling platform 
as the tool for the air quality modeling. 
The CMAQ modeling system is a 
comprehensive three-dimensional grid- 
based Eulerian air quality model 
designed to estimate the formation and 
fate of oxidant precursors, primary and 
secondary PM concentrations and 
deposition, and air toxics, over regional 
and urban spatial scales (e.g. over the 
contiguous U.S.).325 326 327 The CMAQ 
model is a well-known and well- 
established tool and is commonly used 
by EPA for regulatory analyses, for 
instance the recent ozone NAAQS 
proposal, and by States in developing 
attainment demonstrations for their 
State Implementation Plans.328 The 
CMAQ model (version 4.6) was peer- 
reviewed in February of 2007 for EPA as 
reported in ‘‘Third Peer Review of 
CMAQ Model,’’ and the EPA Office of 
Research and Development (ORD) peer 
review report which includes version 
4.7 is currently being finalized.329 
CMAQ includes many science 
modules that simulate the emission, 
production, decay, deposition and 
transport of organic and inorganic gas- 
phase and particle-phase pollutants in 
the atmosphere. EPA intends to use the 
most recent CMAQ version (version 
4.7), which was officially released by 
EPA’s Office of Research and 
Development (ORD) in December 2008 
and reflects updates to earlier versions 
in a number of areas to improve the 
underlying science. These include (1) 
enhanced secondary organic aerosol 
(SOA) mechanism to include chemistry 
of isoprene, sesquiterpene, and aged in- 
cloud biogenic SOA in addition to 
terpene; (2) improved vertical 
convective mixing; (3) improved 
heterogeneous reaction involving nitrate 
formation; and (4) an updated gas-phase 
chemistry mechanism, Carbon Bond 05 
(CB05), with extensions to model 
explicit concentrations of air toxic 
species as well as chlorine and mercury. 
This mechanism, CB05-toxics, also 
computes concentrations of species that 
are involved in aqueous chemistry and 
that are precursors to aerosols. 
H. What Are the Estimated Cost, 
Economic, and Other Impacts of the 
Proposal? 
In this section, EPA presents the costs 
and impacts of EPA’s proposed GHG 
program. It is important to note that 
NHTSA’s CAFE standards and EPA’s 
GHG standards will both be in effect, 
and each will lead to increases in 
average fuel economy and CO2 
emissions reductions. The two agencies’ 
standards comprise the National 
Program, and this discussion of costs 
and benefits of EPA’s GHG standard 
does not change the fact that both the 
CAFE and GHG standards, jointly, are 
the source of the benefits and costs of 
the National Program. 
This section outlines the basis for 
assessing the benefits and costs of these 
standards and provides estimates of 
these costs and benefits. Some of these 
effects are private, meaning that they 
affect consumers and producers directly 
in their sales, purchases, and use of 
vehicles. These private effects include 
the costs of the technology, fuel savings, 
and the benefits of additional driving 
and reduced refueling. Other costs and 
benefits affect people outside the 
markets for vehicles and their use; these 
effects are termed external costs, 
because they affect people external to 
the market. The external effects include 
the climate impacts, the effects on non- 
GHG pollutants, and the effects on 
traffic, accidents, and noise due to 
additional driving. The sum of the 
private and external benefits and costs 
is the net social benefits of the program. 
There is some debate about the role of 
private benefits in assessing the benefits 
and costs of the program: If consumers 
have full information and perfect 
foresight in their vehicle purchase 
decisions, it is possible that they have

334 For example, it might be maintained that at 
the time of purchase, consumers take full account 
of the time potentially saved by fuel-efficient cars, 
but it might also be questioned whether they have 
adequate information to do so, or whether that 
factor is sufficiently salient to play the proper role 
in purchasing decisions.

already considered these benefits in 
their vehicle purchase decisions. If so, 
then the inclusion of private benefits in 
the net benefits calculation may be 
inappropriate. If these conditions do not 
hold, then the private benefits may be 
a part of the net benefits. Section III.H.1 
discusses this issue more fully. 
EPA’s proposed program costs consist 
of the vehicle program costs (costs of 
complying with the vehicle CO2 
standards, taking into account FFV 
credits through 2015, the temporary 
lead-time alternative allowance 
standard program (TLAASP), full car/ 
truck trading, and the A/C credit 
program), along with the fuel savings 
associated with reduced fuel usage 
resulting from the proposed program. 
These proposed program costs also 
include external costs associated with 
noise, congestion, accidents, time spent 
refueling vehicles, and energy security 
impacts. EPA also presents the cost- 
effectiveness of the proposed standards 
and our analysis of the expected 
economy-wide impacts. The projected 
monetized benefits of reducing GHG 
emissions and co-pollutant health and 
environmental impacts are also 
presented. EPA also presents our 
estimates of the impact on vehicle miles 
traveled and the impacts associated 
with those miles as well as other 
societal impacts of the proposed 
program, including energy security 
impacts. 
The total monetized benefits 
(excluding fuel savings) under the 
proposed program are projected to be 
$21 to $54 billion in 2030, assuming a 
3 percent discount rate and depending 
on the value used for the social cost of 
carbon. The costs of the proposed 
program in 2030 are estimated to be 
approximately $18 billion for new 
vehicle technology less $90 billion in 
savings realized by consumers through 
fewer fuel expenditures (calculated 
using pre-tax fuel prices). 
EPA has undertaken an analysis of the 
economy-wide impacts of the proposed 
GHG tailpipe standards as an 
exploratory exercise that EPA believes 
could provide additional insights into 
the potential impacts of the proposal.330 
These results were not a factor regarding 
the appropriateness of the proposed 
GHG tailpipe standards. It is important 
to note that the results of this modeling 
exercise are dependent on the 
assumptions associated with how 
consumers will respond to increases in 
higher vehicle costs and improved 
vehicle fuel economy as a result of the 
proposal. Section III.H.1 discusses the 
underlying distinctions and 
implications of the role of consumer 
response in economic impacts. 
Further information on these and 
other aspects of the economic impacts of 
our proposed rule are summarized in 
the following sections and are presented 
in more detail in the DRIA for this 
rulemaking. EPA requests comment on 
all aspects of the cost, savings, and 
benefits analysis presented here and in 
the DRIA. EPA also requests comment 
on the inputs used in these analyses as 
described in the Draft Joint TSD. 
1. Conceptual Framework for Evaluating 
Consumer Impacts 
For this proposed rule, EPA projects 
significant private gains to consumers in 
three major areas: (1) Reductions in 
spending on fuel, (2) time saved due to 
less refueling, and (3) welfare gains from 
additional driving that results from the 
rebound effect. In combination, these 
private savings, mostly from fuel 
savings, appear to outweigh by a large 
margin the costs of the program, even 
without accounting for externalities. 
Admittedly, these findings pose a 
conundrum. On the one hand, 
consumers are expected to gain 
significantly from the proposed rules, as 
the increased cost of fuel efficient cars 
appears to be far smaller than the fuel 
savings (assuming modest discount 
rates). Yet fuel efficient cars are 
currently offered for sale, and 
consumers’ purchasing decisions may 
suggest a preference for lower fuel 
economy than the proposed rule 
mandates. Assuming full information 
and perfect foresight, standard 
economic theory suggests that the 
private gains to consumers, large as they 
are, must therefore be accompanied by 
a consumer welfare loss. This 
calculation assumes that consumers 
accurately predict all the benefits they 
will get from a new vehicle, even if they 
underestimated fuel savings at the time 
of purchase. Even if there is some such 
loss, EPA believes that under realistic 
assumptions, the private gains from the 
proposed rule, together with the social 
gains (in the form of reduction of 
externalities), significantly outweigh the 
costs. But EPA seeks comments on the 
underlying issue. 
The central conundrum has been 
referred to as the Energy Paradox in this 
setting (and in several others).331 In 
short, the problem is that consumers 
appear not to purchase products that are 
in their economic self-interest. There are 
strong theoretical reasons why this 
might be so.332 Consumers might be 
myopic and hence undervalue the long- 
term; they might lack information or a 
full appreciation of information even 
when it is presented; they might be 
especially averse to the short-term 
losses associated with energy efficient 
products (the behavioral phenomenon 
of ‘‘loss aversion’’); even if consumers 
have relevant knowledge, the benefits of 
energy efficient vehicles might not be 
sufficiently salient to them at the time 
of purchase. A great deal of work in 
behavioral economics identifies factors 
of this sort, which help account for the 
Energy Paradox.333 This point holds in 
the context of fuel savings (the main 
focus here), but it applies equally to the 
other private benefits, including 
reductions in refueling time and 
additional driving.334 
Considerable research suggests that 
the Energy Paradox is real and 
significant due to consumers’ inability 
to value future fuel savings 
appropriately. For example, Sanstad and 
Howarth (1994) argue that consumers 
optimize behavior without full 
information by resorting to imprecise 
but convenient rules of thumb. Larrick 
and Soll (2008) find evidence that 
consumers do not understand how to 
translate changes in miles-per-gallon 
into fuel savings (a concern that EPA is 
continuing to attempt to address).335 If 
these arguments are valid, then there 
will be significant gains to consumers of 
the government mandating additional 
fuel economy. 
The evidence from consumer vehicle 
choice models indicates a huge range of 
estimates for consumers’ willingness to 
pay for additional fuel economy. 
Because consumer surplus estimates 
from consumer vehicle choice models 
depend critically on this value, EPA 
would consider any consumer surplus 
estimates of the effect of our rule from 
such models to be unreliable. In 
addition, the predictive ability of 
consumer vehicle choice models may be 
limited. While vehicle choice models

are based on sales of existing vehicles, 
vehicle models are likely to change, 
both independently and in response to 
this proposed rule; the models may not 
predict well in response to these 
changes. Instead, EPA compares the 
value of the fuel savings associated with 
this rule with the increase in technology 
costs. EPA will continue its efforts to 
review the literature, but, given the 
known difficulties, EPA has not 
conducted an analysis using these 
models for this proposal. 
Consumer vehicle choice models 
(referred to as ‘‘market shift’’ models by 
NHTSA in Section IV.C.4.c) are a tool 
that attempts to estimate how 
consumers decide what vehicles they 
buy. The models typically take into 
consideration both household 
characteristics (such as income, family 
size, and age) and vehicle characteristics 
(including a vehicle’s power, price, and 
fuel economy). These models are often 
used to examine how a consumer’s 
vehicle purchase decision is affected by 
a change in vehicle or personal 
characteristics. Although these models 
focus on the consumer, some have also 
linked consumer choice models with 
information on vehicle technologies and 
costs, to estimate an integrated system 
of consumer and auto maker response. 
The outputs from consumer vehicle 
choice models typically include the 
market shares of each category of 
vehicle in the model. In addition, 
consumer vehicle choice models are 
often used to estimate the effect of 
market or regulatory changes on 
consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is 
the benefit that a consumer gets over 
and above the market price paid for the 
good. For instance, if a consumer is 
willing to pay up to $30,000 for a car 
but is able to negotiate a price of 
$25,000, the $5,000 difference is 
consumer surplus. Information on 
consumer surplus can be used in 
benefit-cost analysis to measure whether 
consumers are likely to consider 
themselves better or worse off due to the 
changes. 
Consumer vehicle choice modeling 
has not previously been applied in 
Federal regulatory analysis of fuel 
economy, and EPA has not used a 
consumer vehicle choice model in its 
analysis of the effects of this proposed 
rule. EPA has not done so, to this point, 
due to concern over the wide variation 
in the methods and results of existing 
models, as well as some of the 
limitations of existing applications of 
consumer choice modeling. Our 
preliminary review of the literature 
indicates that these models vary in a 
number of dimensions, including data 
sources used, modeling methods, 
vehicle characteristics included in the 
analysis, and the research questions for 
which they were designed. These 
dimensions are likely to affect the 
models’ results and their interpretation. 
In addition, their ability to incorporate 
major changes in the vehicle fleet 
appears unproven. 
One problem for this rule is the 
variation in the value that consumers 
place on fuel economy in their vehicle 
purchase decisions. A number of 
consumer vehicle choice models make 
the assumption that auto producers 
provide as much fuel economy in their 
vehicles as consumers are willing to 
purchase, and consumers are satisfied 
with the current combinations of 
vehicle fuel economy and price in the 
marketplace.336 If this assumption is 
true, then consumers will not benefit 
from required improvements in fuel 
economy, even if the fuel savings that 
they receive exceed the additional costs 
from the fuel-saving technology. Other 
vehicle choice models, in contrast, find 
that consumers are willing to pay more 
for additional fuel economy than the 
costs to auto producers of installing that 
technology.337 If this result is true, then 
both consumers and producers would 
benefit from increased fuel economy. 
This result leaves open the question 
why auto producers do not follow the 
market incentive to provide more fuel 
economy, and why consumers do not 
seek out more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
Whether consumers and producers 
will benefit from improved fuel 
economy depends on the value of 
improved fuel economy to consumers. 
There may be a difference between the 
fuel savings that consumers would 
receive from improved fuel economy, 
and the amount that consumers would 
be willing to spend on a vehicle to get 
improved fuel economy. A 1988 review 
of consumers’ willingness to pay for 
improved fuel economy found estimates 
that varied by more than an order of 
magnitude: for a $1 per year reduction 
in vehicle operating costs, consumers 
would be willing to spend between 
$0.74 and $25.97 in increased vehicle 
price.338 For comparison, the present 
value of saving $1 per year on fuel for 
15 years at a 3% discount rate is $11.94, 
while a 7% discount rate produces a 
present value of $8.78. Thus, this study 
finds that consumers may be willing to 
pay either far too much or far too little 
for the fuel savings they will receive. 
Although EPA has not found an 
updated survey of these values, a few 
examples suggest that the existing 
consumer vehicle choice models still 
demonstrate wide variation in estimates 
of how much people are willing to pay 
for fuel savings. For instance, Espey and 
Nair (2005) and McManus (2006) find 
that consumers are willing to pay 
around $600 for one additional mile per 
gallon.339 In contrast, Gramlich (2008) 
finds that consumers’ willingness to pay 
for an increase from 25 mpg to 30 mpg 
varies between $4,100 (for luxury cars 
when gasoline costs $2/gallon) to 
$20,560 (for SUVs when gasoline costs 
$3.50/gallon).340 
As noted, lack of information is one 
possible reason for the variation. 
Consumers face difficulty in predicting 
the fuel savings that they are likely to 
get from a vehicle, for a number of 
reasons. For instance, the calculation of 
fuel savings is complex, and consumers

may not make it correctly.341 In 
addition, future fuel price (a major 
component of fuel savings) is highly 
uncertain. Consumer fuel savings also 
vary across individuals, who travel 
different amounts and have different 
driving styles. Studies regularly show 
that fuel economy plays a role in 
consumers’ vehicle purchases, but 
modeling that role may still be in 
development.342 
If there is a difference between fuel 
savings and consumers’ willingness to 
pay for fuel savings, the next question 
is, which is the appropriate measure of 
consumer benefit? Fuel savings measure 
the actual monetary value that 
consumers will receive after purchasing 
a vehicle; the willingness to pay for fuel 
economy measures the value that, before 
a purchase, consumers place on 
additional fuel economy. As noted, 
there are a number of reasons that 
consumers may incorrectly estimate the 
benefits that they get from improved 
fuel economy, including risk or loss 
aversion, poor ability to estimate 
savings, and a lack of salience of fuel 
economy savings. 
Considerable evidence suggests that 
consumers discount future benefits 
more than the government when 
evaluating energy efficiency gains. The 
Energy Information Agency (1996) has 
used discount rates as high as 111 
percent for water heaters and 120 
percent for electric clothes dryers.343 In 
the transportation sector, evidence also 
points to high private discount rates: 
Kubik (2006) conducts a representative 
survey that finds consumers are 
impatient or myopic (e.g., use a high 
discount rate) with regard to vehicle 
fuel savings.344 On average, consumers 
indicated that fuel savings would have 
to pay back the additional cost in only 
2.9 years to persuade them to buy a 
higher fuel-economy vehicle. EPA also 
incorporate a relatively short ‘‘payback 
period’’ into OMEGA to evaluate and 
order technologies that can be used to 
increase fuel economy, assuming that 
buyers value the resulting fuel savings 
over the first five years of a new 
vehicle’s lifetime. This assumption is 
based on the current average term of 
consumer loans to finance the purchase 
of new vehicles. That said, there is no 
consensus in the literature on what the 
private discount rate is or should be in 
this context. 
One possibility is that the discounting 
framework may not be a good model for 
consumer decision-making and for 
determining consumer welfare regarding 
fuel economy. Buying a vehicle involves 
trading off among dozens of vehicle 
characteristics, including price, vehicle 
class, safety, performance, and even 
audio systems and cupholders. Fuel 
economy is only one of these attributes, 
and its role in consumer vehicle 
purchase decisions is not well 
understood (see DRIA Section 8.1.2 for 
further discussion). As noted above, if 
consumers do not fully consider fuel 
economy at the time of vehicle 
purchase, then the fuel savings from this 
rule provide a realized benefit to 
consumers after purchase. There are two 
distinct ideas at work here: one is that 
efficiency improvements change the 
nature of the cost of the car, requiring 
higher up-front vehicle costs while 
enabling lower long-run fuel costs; the 
other is that while consumers may 
benefit from the lower long-run fuel 
costs, they may also experience some 
loss in welfare on account of the 
possible change in vehicle mix. 
A second problem with use of 
consumer vehicle choice models, as 
they now stand, is that they are even 
less reliable in the face of significant 
changes otherwise occurring in fleet 
composition. One attempt to analyze the 
effect of the oil shock of 1973 on 
consumer vehicle choice found that, 
after two years, the particular model did 
not predict well due to changes in the 
vehicle fleet.345 It is likely that, in the 
next few years, many of the vehicles 
that will be offered for sale will change. 
In coming years, new vehicles will be 
developed, and existing vehicles will be 
redesigned. For instance, over the next 
few years, new vehicles that have both 
high fuel economy and high safety 
factors, in combinations that consumers 
have not previously been offered, are 
likely to appear in the market. Models 
based on the existing vehicle fleet may 
not do well in predicting consumers’ 
choices among the new vehicles offered. 
Given that consumer vehicle choice 
models appear to be less effective in 
predicting vehicle choices when the 
vehicles are likely to change, EPA is 
reluctant to use the models for this 
proposed rulemaking. 
In sum, the estimates of consumer 
surplus from consumer vehicle choice 
models depend heavily on the value to 
consumers of improved fuel economy, a 
value for which estimates are highly 
varied. In addition, the predictive 
ability of consumer vehicle choice 
models may be limited as consumers 
face new vehicle choices that they 
previously did not have. 
Nonetheless, because there are 
potential advantages to using consumer 
vehicle choice models if these 
difficulties can be addressed, EPA plans 
to continue our investigation and 
evaluation of consumer vehicle choice 
models. This effort includes further 
review of existing consumer vehicle 
choice models and the estimates of 
consumers’ willingness to pay for 
increased fuel economy. In addition, 
EPA is developing capacity to examine 
the factors that may affect the results of 
consumer vehicle choice models, and to 
explore their impact on analysis of 
regulatory scenarios. 
A detailed discussion of the state of 
the art of consumer choice modeling is 
provided in the DRIA. For this 
rulemaking, EPA is not able to estimate 
the consumer welfare loss which may 
accompany the actual fuel savings from 
the proposal, and so any such loss must 
remain unquantified. EPA seeks 
comments on how to assess these 
difficult questions in the future. 
2. Costs Associated With the Vehicle 
Program 
In this section EPA presents our 
estimate of the costs associated with the 
proposed vehicle program. The 
presentation here summarizes the costs 
associated with the new vehicle 
technology expected to be added to 
meet the proposed GHG standards, 
including hardware costs to comply 
with the proposed A/C credit program. 
The analysis summarized here provides 
our estimate of incremental costs on a 
per vehicle basis and on an annual total 
basis. 
The presentation here summarizes the 
outputs of the OMEGA model that was 
discussed in some detail in Section III.D 
of this preamble. For details behind the 
analysis such as the OMEGA model 
inputs and the estimates of costs 
associated with individual technologies, 
the reader is directed to Chapters 1 and 
2 of the DRIA, and Chapter 3 of the Draft 
Joint TSD. For more detail on the

estimated to get lower in 2022 because some of the 
indirect costs attributable to this proposal in the 
years prior to 2022 would be eliminated in 2022 
and later.

outputs of the OMEGA model and the 
overall vehicle program costs 
summarized here, the reader is directed 
to Chapters 4 and 7 of the DRIA. 
With respect to the cost estimates for 
vehicle technologies, EPA notes that, 
because these estimates relate to 
technologies which are in most cases 
already available, these cost estimates 
are technically robust. EPA notes further 
that, in all instances, its estimates are 
within the range of estimates in the 
most widely-utilized sources and 
studies. In that way, EPA believes that 
we have been conservative in estimating 
the vehicle hardware costs associated 
with this proposal. 
With respect to the aggregate cost 
estimations presented in Section 
III.H.2.b, EPA notes that there are a 
number of areas where the results of our 
analysis may be conservative and, in 
general, EPA believes we have 
directionally overestimated the costs of 
compliance with these proposed 
standards, especially in not accounting 
for the full range of credit opportunities 
available to manufacturers. For 
example, some cost saving programs are 
considered in our analysis, such as full 
car/truck trading, while others are not, 
such as cross-manufacturer trading and 
advanced technology credits. 
a. Vehicle Compliance Costs Associated 
With the Proposed CO2 Standards 
For the technology and vehicle 
package costs associated with adding 
new CO2-reducing technology to 
vehicles, EPA began with EPA’s 2008 
Staff Report and NHTSA’s 2011 CAFE 
FRM both of which presented costs 
generated using existing literature, 
meetings with manufacturers and parts 
suppliers, and meetings with other 
experts in the field of automotive cost 
estimation.346 EPA has updated some of 
those technology costs with new 
information from our contract with FEV, 
through further discussion with 
NHTSA, and by converting from 2006 
dollars to 2007 dollars using the GDP 
price deflator. The estimated costs 
presented here represent the 
incremental costs associated with this 
proposal relative to what the future 
vehicle fleet would be expected to look 
like absent this proposed rule. A more 
detailed description of the factors 
considered in our reference case is 
presented in Section III.D. 
The estimates of vehicle compliance 
costs cover the years of implementation 
of the program—2012 through 2016. 
EPA has also estimated compliance 
costs for the years following 
implementation so that we can shed 
light on the long term—2022 and later— 
cost impacts of the proposal.347 EPA 
used the year 2022 here because our 
short-term and long-term markup factors 
described shortly below are applied in 
five year increments with the 2012 
through 2016 implementation span and 
the 2017 through 2021 span both 
representing the short-term. Some of the 
individual technology cost estimates are 
presented in brief in Section III.D, and 
account for both the direct and indirect 
costs incurred in the automobile 
manufacturing and dealer industries (for 
a complete presentation of technology 
costs, please refer to Chapter 3 of the 
Draft Joint TSD). To account for the 
indirect costs, EPA has applied an 
indirect cost markup (ICM) factor to all 
of our direct costs to arrive at the 
estimated technology cost.348 The ICM 
factors used range from 1.11 to 1.64 in 
the short-term (2012 through 2021), 
depending on the complexity of the 
given technology, to account for 
differences in the levels of R&D, tooling, 
and other indirect costs that would be 
incurred. Once the program has been 
fully implemented, some of the indirect 
costs would no longer be attributable to 
these proposed standards and, as such, 
a lower ICM factor is applied to direct 
costs in years following full 
implementation. The ICM factors used 
range from 1.07 to 1.39 in the long-term 
(2022 and later) depending on the 
complexity of the given technology.349 
Note that the short-term ICMs are used 
in the 2012 through 2016 years of 
implementation and continue through 
2021. EPA does this since the proposed 
standards are still being implemented 
during the 2012 through 2016 model 
years. Therefore, EPA considers the five 
year period following full 
implementation also to be short-term. 
The argument has been made that the 
ICM approach may be more appropriate 
for regulatory cost estimation than the 
more traditional retail price equivalent, 
or RPE, markup. The RPE is based on 
the historical relationship between 
direct costs and consumer prices; it is 
intended to reflect the average markup 
over time required to sustain the 
industry as a viable operation. Unlike 
the RPE approach, the ICM focuses more 
narrowly on the changes that are 
required in direct response to 
regulation-induced vehicle design 
changes which may not directly 
influence all of the indirect costs that 
are incurred in the normal course of 
business. For example, an RPE markup 
captures all indirect costs including 
costs such as the retirement benefits of 
retired employees. However, the 
retirement benefits for retired 
employees are not expected to change as 
a result of a new GHG regulation and, 
therefore, those indirect costs should 
not increase in relation to newly added 
hardware in response to a regulation. 
So, under the ICM approach, if a newly 
added piece of technology has an 
incremental direct cost of $1, its direct 
plus indirect costs should not be $1 
multiplied by an RPE markup of say 1.5, 
or $1.50, but rather something less since 
the manufacturer is not paying more for 
retired-employee retirement benefits as 
a direct result of adding the new piece 
of technology. Further, as noted above, 
the indirect cost multiplier can be 
adjusted for different levels of 
technological complexity. For example, 
a move to low rolling resistance tires is 
less complex than converting a gasoline 
vehicle to a plug-in hybrid. Therefore, 
the incremental indirect costs for the 
tires should be lower in magnitude than 
those for the plug-in hybrid. For the 
analysis underlying these proposed 
standards, the agencies have based our 
estimates on the ICM approach, but EPA 
notes that discussion continues about 
the use of the RPE approach and the 
ICM approach for safety and 
environmental regulations. We discuss 
our ICM factors and the complexity 
levels used in our analysis in more 
detail in Chapter 3 of the Draft Joint 
TSD and EPA requests comment on the 
approach described there as well as the 
general concepts of both the ICM and 
RPE approaches. 
EPA has also considered the impacts 
of manufacturer learning on the 
technology cost estimates. Consistent 
with past EPA rulemakings, EPA has 
estimated that some costs would decline 
by 20 percent with each of the first two 
doublings of production beginning with 
the first year of implementation. These

volume-based cost declines—which 
EPA calls ‘‘volume’’ based learning— 
take place after manufacturers have had 
the opportunity to find ways to improve 
upon their manufacturing processes or 
otherwise manufacture these 
technologies in a more efficient way. 
After two 20 percent cost reduction 
steps, the cost reduction learning curve 
flattens out considerably as only minor 
improvements in manufacturing 
techniques and efficiencies remain to be 
had. By then, costs decline roughly 
three percent per year as manufacturers 
and suppliers continually strive to 
reduce costs. These time-based cost 
declines—which EPA calls ‘‘time’’ 
based learning—take place at a rate of 
three percent per year. EPA has 
considered learning impacts on most 
but not all of the technologies expected 
to be used because some of the expected 
technologies are already used rather 
widely in the industry and, presumably, 
learning impacts have already occurred. 
EPA has considered volume-based 
learning for only a handful of 
technologies that EPA considers to be 
new or emerging technologies such as 
the hybrids and electric vehicles. For 
most technologies, EPA has considered 
them to be more established given their 
current use in the fleet and, hence, we 
have applied the lower time based 
learning. We have more discussion of 
our learning approach and the 
technologies to which we have applied 
which type of learning in the Draft Joint 
TSD. 
The technology cost estimates 
discussed in Section III.D and detailed 
in Chapter 3 of the Draft Joint TSD are 
used to build up package cost estimates 
which are then used as inputs to the 
OMEGA model. EPA discusses our 
packages and package costs in Chapter 
1 of the DRIA. The model determines 
what level of CO2 improvement is 
required considering the reference case 
for each manufacturer’s fleet. The 
vehicle compliance costs are the outputs 
of the model and take into account FFV 
credits through 2015, TLAASP, full car/ 
truck trading, and the A/C credit 
program. Table III.H.2–1 presents the 
fleet average incremental vehicle 
compliance costs for this proposal. As 
the table indicates, 2012–2016 costs 
increase every year as the standards 
become more stringent. Costs per car 
and per truck then remain stable 
through 2021 while cost per vehicle 
(car/truck combined) decline slightly as 
the fleet mix trends slowly to increasing 
car sales. In 2022, costs per car and per 
truck decline as the long-term ICM kicks 
in because some indirect costs are no 
longer considered attributable to the 
proposed program. Costs per car and per 
truck remain constant thereafter while 
the cost per vehicle declines slightly as 
the fleet continues to trend toward cars. 
By 2030, projections of fleet mix 
changes become static and the cost per 
vehicle remains constant. EPA has a 
more detailed presentation of vehicle 
compliance costs on a manufacturer by 
manufacturer basis in the DRIA.

b. Annual Costs of the Proposed Vehicle 
Program 
The costs presented here represent the 
incremental costs for newly added 
technology to comply with the proposed 
program. Together with the projected 
increases in car and light-truck sales, 
the increases in per-vehicle average 
costs shown in Table III.H.2–1 above 
result in the total annual costs reported 
in Table III.H.2–2 below. Note that the 
costs presented in Table III.H.2–2 do not 
include the savings that would occur as 
a result of the improvements to fuel 
consumption. Those impacts are 
presented in Section III.H.4.

3. Cost per Ton of Emissions Reduced 
EPA has calculated the cost per ton of 
GHG (CO2-equivalent, or CO2e) 
reductions associated with this proposal 
using the above costs and the emissions 
reductions described in Section III.F. 
More detail on the costs, emission 
reductions, and the cost per ton can be 
found in the DRIA and Draft Joint TSD. 
EPA has calculated the cost per metric 
ton of GHG emissions reductions in the 
years 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 using 
the annual vehicle compliance costs and 
emission reductions for each of those 
years. The value in 2050 represents the 
long-term cost per ton of the emissions 
reduced. Note that EPA has not 
included the savings associated with

reduced fuel consumption, nor any of 
the other benefits of this proposal in the 
cost per ton calculations. If EPA were to 
include fuel savings in the cost 
estimates, the cost per ton would be less 
than $0, since the estimated value of 
fuel savings outweighs these costs. With 
regard to the proposed CH4 and N2O 
standards, since these standards would 
be emissions caps designed to ensure 
manufacturers do not backslide from 
current levels, EPA has not estimated 
costs associated with the standards 
(since the standards would not require 
any change from current practices nor 
does EPA estimate they would result in 
emissions reductions). 
The results for CO2e costs per ton 
under the proposed vehicle program are

posal (discussed in Sections III.H.6 through III.H 10). 
4. Reduction in Fuel Consumption and 
Its Impacts 
a. What Are the Projected Changes in 
Fuel Consumption? 
The proposed CO2 standards would 
result in significant improvements in 
the fuel efficiency of affected vehicles. 
Drivers of those vehicles would see 
corresponding savings associated with 
reduced fuel expenditures. EPA has 
estimated the impacts on fuel 
consumption for both the proposed 
tailpipe CO2 standards and the proposed 
A/C credit program. To do this, fuel 
consumption is calculated using both 
current CO2 emission levels and the 
proposed CO2 standards. The difference 
between these estimates represents the 
net savings from the proposed CO2 
standards. Note that the total number of 
miles that vehicles are driven each year 
is different under each of the control 
case scenarios than in the reference case 
due to the ‘‘rebound effect,’’ which is 
discussed in Section III.H.4.c. 
The expected impacts on fuel 
consumption are shown in Table 
III.H.4–1. The gallons shown in the 
tables reflect impacts from the proposed 
CO2 standards, including the proposed 
A/C credit program, and include 
increased consumption resulting from 
the rebound effect.

2050 .............................................. 42,570 
b. What Are the Fuel Savings to the 
Consumer? 
Using the fuel consumption estimates 
presented in Section III.H.4.a, EPA can 
calculate the monetized fuel savings 
associated with the proposed CO2 
standards. To do this, we multiply 
reduced fuel consumption in each year 
by the corresponding estimated average 
fuel price in that year, using the 
reference case taken from the AEO 
2009.350 AEO is the government 
consensus estimate used by NHTSA and 
many other government agencies to 
estimate the projected price of fuel. EPA 
has included all fuel taxes in these 
estimates since these are the prices paid 
by consumers. As such, the savings 
shown reflect savings to the consumer. 
These results are shown in Table 
III.H.4–2. Note that EPA presents the 
monetized fuel savings using pre-tax 
fuel prices in Section III.H.10. The fuel 
savings based on pre-tax fuel prices 
reflect the societal savings in contrast to 
the consumer savings presented in 
Table III.H.4–2. Also in Section III.H.10, 
EPA presents the benefit-cost of the 
proposal and, for that reason, present 
the fuel impacts as negative costs of the 
program while here EPA presents them 
as positive savings.

a Fuel consumption savings calculated using 
taxed fuel prices. Fuel consumption impacts 
using pre-tax fuel prices are presented in Sec-
tion III.H.10 as negative costs of the vehicle 
program 
As shown in Table III.H.4–2, EPA is 
projecting that consumers would realize 
very large fuel savings as a result of the 
standards contained in this proposal. 
There are several ways to view this 
value. Some, as demonstrated below in 
Section III.H.5, view these fuel savings 
as a reduction in the cost of owning a 
vehicle, whose full benefits consumers 
realize. This approach assumes that, 
regardless how consumers in fact make 
their decisions on how much fuel 
economy to purchase, they will gain 
these fuel savings. Another view says 
that consumers do not necessarily value 
fuel savings as equal to the results of 
this calculation. Instead, consumers 
may either undervalue or overvalue fuel 
economy relative to these savings, based

357 There is not a consensus in the literature on 
how consumers consider fuel economy in their 
vehicle purchases. Results are inconsistent, 
possibly due to fuel economy not being a major 
focus of many of the studies. Espey, Molly, and

What Is It Worth?’’ Contemporary Economic Policy

using the lifetime of the vehicle, not just the first

decisions. This result suggests that the five-year 
time horizon used here may be an underestimate. 
on their personal preferences. This issue 
is discussed further in Section III.H.5 
and in Chapter 8 of the DRIA. 
c. VMT Rebound Effect 
The fuel economy rebound effect 
refers to the fraction of fuel savings 
expected to result from an increase in 
vehicle fuel economy—particularly one 
required by higher fuel efficiency 
standards—that is offset by additional 
vehicle use. The increase in vehicle use 
occurs because higher fuel economy 
reduces the fuel cost of driving, which 
is typically the largest single component 
of the monetary cost of operating a 
vehicle, and vehicle owners respond to 
this reduction in operating costs by 
driving slightly more. 
For this proposal, EPA is using an 
estimate of 10% for the rebound effect. 
This value is based on the most recent 
time period analyzed in the Small and 
Van Dender 2007 paper,351 and falls 
within the range of the larger body of 
historical work on the rebound effect.352 
Recent work by David Greene on the 
rebound effect for light-duty vehicles in 
the U.S. further supports the hypothesis 
that the rebound effect is decreasing 
over time.353 If we were to use a 
dynamic estimate of the future rebound 
effect, our analysis shows that the 
rebound effect could be in the range of 
5% or lower.354 The rebound effect is 
also discussed in Section II.F of the 
preamble; the TSD, Section 4.2.5, 
reviews the relevant literature and 
discusses in more depth the reasoning 
for the rebound values used here. 
EPA also invites comments on other 
alternatives for estimating the rebound 
effect. As one illustration, variation in 
the price per gallon of gasoline directly 
affects the per-mile cost of driving, and 
drivers may respond just as they would 
to a change in the cost of driving 
resulting from a change in fuel 
economy, by varying the number of 
miles they drive. Because vehicles’ fuel 
economy is fixed in the short run, 
variation in the number of miles driven 
in response to changes in fuel prices 
will be reflected in changes in gasoline 
consumption. Under the assumption 
that drivers respond similarly to 
changes in the cost of driving whether 
they are caused by variation in fuel 
prices or fuel economy, the short-run 
price elasticity of demand for gasoline— 
which measures the sensitivity of 
gasoline consumption to changes in its 
price per gallon—may provide some 
indication about the magnitude of the 
rebound effect itself. EPA invites 
comment on the extent to which the 
short run elasticity of demand for 
gasoline with respect to its price can 
provide useful information about the 
size of the rebound effect. Specifically, 
we seek comment on whether it would 
be appropriate to use the price elasticity 
of demand for gasoline, or other 
alternative approaches, to guide the 
choice of a value for the rebound effect. 
5. Impacts on U.S. Vehicle Sales and 
Payback Period 
a. Vehicle Sales Impacts 
The methodology EPA used for 
estimating the impact on vehicle sales is 
relatively straightforward, but makes a 
number of simplifying assumptions. 
According to the literature, the price 
elasticity of demand for vehicles is 
commonly estimated to be ¥1.0.355 In 
other words, a one percent increase in 
the price of a vehicle would be expected 
to decrease sales by one percent, 
holding all other factors constant. For 
our estimates, EPA calculated the effect 
of an increase in vehicle costs due to the 
proposed standards and assume that 
consumers will face the full increase in 
costs, not an actual (estimated) change 
in vehicle price. (The estimated 
increases in vehicle cost due to the rule 
are discussed in Section III.H.2) This is 
a conservative methodology, since an 
increase in cost may not pass fully into 
an increase in market price in an 
oligopolistic industry such as the 
automotive sector.356 EPA also notes 
that we have not used these estimated 
sales impacts in the OMEGA Model. 
Although EPA uses the one percent 
price elasticity of demand for vehicles 
as the basis for our vehicle sales impact 
estimates, we assumed that the 
consumer would take into account both 
the higher vehicle purchasing costs as 
well as some of the fuel savings benefits 
when deciding whether to purchase a 
new vehicle. Therefore, the incremental 
cost increase of a new vehicle would be 
offset by reduced fuel expenditures over 
a certain period of time (i.e., the 
‘‘payback period’’). For the purposes of 
this rulemaking, EPA used a five-year 
payback period, which is consistent 
with the length of a typical new light- 
duty vehicle loan.357 This approach may 
not accurately reflect the role of fuel 
savings in consumers’ purchase 
decisions, as the discussion in Section 
III.H.1 suggests. If consumers consider 
fuel savings in a different fashion than 
modeled here, then this approach will 
not accurately reflect the impact of this 
rule on vehicle sales. 
This increase in costs has other effects 
on consumers as well: If vehicle prices 
increase, consumers will face higher 
insurance costs and sales tax, and 
additional finance costs if the vehicle is 
bought on credit. In addition, the resale 
value of the vehicles will increase. EPA 
estimates that, with corrections for these 
factors, the effect on consumer 
expenditures of the cost of the new 
technology should be 0.932 times the 
cost of the technology at a 3% discount 
rate, and 0.892 times the cost of the 
technology at a 7% discount rate. The 
details of this calculation are in the 
DRIA, Chapter 8.l. 
Once the cost estimates are adjusted 
for these additional factors, the fuel cost 
savings associated with the rule, 
discussed in Section III.H.4, are 
subtracted to get the net effect on 
consumer expenditures for a new 
vehicle. With the assumed elasticity of 
demand of ¥1, the percent change in 
this ‘‘effective price,’’ estimated as the 
adjusted increase in cost, is equal to the 
negative of the percent change in 
vehicle purchases. The net effect of this 
calculation is in Table III.H.5–1 and 
Table III.H.5–2.

The estimates provided in Table 
III.H.5–1 and Table III.H.5–2 are meant 
to be illustrative rather than a definitive 
prediction. When viewed at the 
industry-wide level, they give a general 
indication of the potential impact on 
vehicle sales. As shown below, the 
overall impact is positive and growing 
over time for both cars and trucks, 
because the estimated value of fuel 
savings exceeds the costs of meeting the 
higher standards. If, however, 
consumers do not take fuel savings and 
other costs into account as modeled 
here when they purchase vehicles, the 
results presented here may not reflect 
actual impacts on vehicle sales.

Table III.H.5–1 shows the impacts on 
new vehicle sales using a 3% discount 
rate. The fuel savings are always higher 
than the technology costs. Although 
both cars and trucks show very small 
effects initially, over time vehicle sales 
become increasingly positive, as 
increased fuel prices make improved 
fuel economy more desirable. The 
increases in sales for trucks are larger 
than the increases for trucks (except in 
2012) in both absolute numbers and 
percentage terms.

2012 ............................................................................................. 61,900 0 .7 25,300 0 .5

2016 ............................................................................................. 353,100 3 .2 291,500 5 .3 
Table III.H.5–2 shows the impacts on 
new vehicle sales using a 7% interest 
rate. While a 7% interest rate shows 
slightly lower impacts than using a 3% 
discount rate, the results are 
qualitatively similar to those using a 3% 
discount rate. Sales increase for every 
year. For both cars and trucks, sales 
become increasingly positive over time, 
as higher fuel prices make improved 
fuel economy more valuable. The car 
market grows more than the truck 
market in absolute numbers, but less on 
a percentage basis. 
The effect of this rule on the use and 
scrappage of older vehicles will be 
related to its effects on new vehicle 
prices, the fuel efficiency of new vehicle 
models, and the total sales of new 
vehicles. If the value of fuel savings 
resulting from improved fuel efficiency 
to the typical potential buyer of a new 
vehicle outweighs the average increase 
in new models’ prices, sales of new 
vehicles will rise, while scrappage rates 
of used vehicles will increase slightly. 
This will cause the ‘‘turnover’’ of the 
vehicle fleet—that is, the retirement of 
used vehicles and their replacement by 
new models—to accelerate slightly, thus 
accentuating the anticipated effect of the 
rule on fleet-wide fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions. However, if potential 
buyers value future fuel savings 
resulting from the increased fuel 
efficiency of new models at less than the 
increase in their average selling price, 
sales of new vehicles will decline, as 
will the rate at which used vehicles are 
retired from service. This effect will 
slow the replacement of used vehicles 
by new models, and thus partly offset 
the anticipated effects of the proposed 
rules on fuel use and emissions. 
Because the agencies are uncertain 
about how the value of projected fuel 
savings from the proposed rules to 
potential buyers will compare to their 
estimates of increases in new vehicle 
prices, we have not attempted to 
estimate explicitly the effects of the rule 
on scrappage of older vehicles and the 
turnover of the vehicle fleet. We seek 
comment on the methods that might be 
used to estimate the effect of the 
proposed rule on the scrappage and use 
of older vehicles as part of the analysis 
to be conducted for the final rule. 
A detailed discussion of the vehicle 
sales impacts methodology is provided 
in the DRIA. EPA invites comments on 
this approach to estimating the vehicle 
sales impacts of this proposal. 
b. Consumer Payback Period and 
Lifetime Savings on New Vehicle 
Purchases 
Another factor of interest is the 
payback period on the purchase of a 
new vehicle that complies with the 
proposed standards. In other words, 
how long would it take for the expected 
fuel savings to outweigh the increased 
cost of a new vehicle? For example, a 
new 2016 MY vehicle is estimated to 
cost $1,050 more (on average, and 
relative to the reference case vehicle) 
due to the addition of new GHG 
reducing technology (see Section III.D.6 
for details on this cost estimate). This 
new technology will result in lower fuel 
consumption and, therefore, savings in 
fuel expenditures (see Section III.F.1 for 
details on fuel savings). But how many 
months or years would pass before the 
fuel savings exceed the upfront cost of 
$1,050? 
Table III.H.5–3 provides the answer to 
this question for a vehicle purchaser 
who pays for the new vehicle upfront in 
cash (we discuss later in this section the 
payback period for consumers who 
finance the new vehicle purchase with 
a loan). The table uses annual miles 
driven (vehicle miles traveled, or VMT) 
and survival rates consistent with the 
emission and benefits analyses

presented in Chapter 4 of the draft joint 
TSD. The control case includes rebound 
VMT but the reference case does not, 
consistent with other parts of the 
analysis. Also included are fuel savings 
associated with A/C controls (in the 
control case only), but the expected 
A/C-related maintenance savings are not 
included. The likely A/C-related 
maintenance savings are discussed in 
Chapter 2 of EPA’s draft RIA. Further, 
this analysis does not include other 
societal impacts such as the value of 
increased driving, or noise, congestion 
and accidents since the focus is meant 
to be on those factors consumers 
consider most while in the showroom 
considering a new car purchase. Car/ 
truck fleet weighting is handled as 
described in Chapter 1 of the draft joint 
TSD. As can be seen in the table, it will 
take under 3 years (2 years and 8 
months at a 3% discount rate, 2 years 
and 10 months at a 7% discount rate) 
for the cumulative discounted fuel 
savings to exceed the upfront increase 
in vehicle cost. More detail on this 
analysis can be found in Chapter 8 of 
EPA’s draft RIA.

a Increased cost of the proposed rule is $1,050; the value here includes nationwide average sales tax of 5.3% and increased insurance pre-
miums of 1.98%; both of these percentages are discussed in Section 8.1.1 of EPA’s draft RIA. 
b Calculated using AEO 2009 reference case fuel price including taxes. 
However, most people purchase a 
new vehicle using credit rather than 
paying cash up front. The typical car 
loan today is a five year, 60 month loan. 
As of August 24, 2009, the national 
average interest rate for a 5 year new car 
loan was 7.41 percent. If the increased 
vehicle cost is spread out over 5 years 
at 7.41 percent, the analysis would look 
like that shown in Table III.H.5–4. As 
can be seen in this table, the fuel 
savings immediately outweigh the 
increased payments on the car loan, 
amounting to $162 in discounted net 
savings (3% discount rate) saved in the 
first year and similar savings for the 
next two years before reduced VMT 
starts to cause the fuel savings to fall. 
Results are similar using a 7% discount 
rate. This means that for every month 
that the average owner is making a 
payment for the financing of the average 
new vehicle their monthly fuel savings 
would be greater than the increase in 
the loan payments. This amounts to a 
savings on the order of $9 to $14 per 
month throughout the duration of the 5 
year loan. Note that in year six when the 
car loan is paid off, the net savings 
equal the fuel savings (as would be the 
case for the remaining years of 
ownership).

The lifetime fuel savings and net 
savings can also be calculated for those 
who purchase the vehicle using cash 
and for those who purchase the vehicle 
with credit. This calculation applies to 
the vehicle owner who retains the 
vehicle for its entire life and drives the 
vehicle each year at the rate equal to the 
national projected average. The results 
are shown in Table III.H.5–5. In either 
case, the present value of the lifetime 
net savings is greater than $3,200 at a 
3% discount rate, or $2,400 at a 7% 
discount rate.

6. Benefits of Reducing GHG Emissions 
a. Introduction 
This proposal is designed to reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
light-duty vehicles. This section 
provides monetized estimates of some of 
the economic benefits of this proposal’s 
projected GHG emissions reductions.358 
The total benefit estimates were 
calculated by multiplying a marginal 
dollar value (i.e., cost per ton) of carbon 
emissions, also referred to as ‘‘social 
cost of carbon’’ (SCC), by the anticipated 
level of emissions reductions in tons. 
We request comment on the approach 
used to estimate the set of SCC values 
used for this coordinated proposal as 
well as the other options considered. 
The estimates presented here are 
interim values. EPA and other agencies 
will continue to explore the underlying 
assumptions and issues. 
As discussed below, the interim 
dollar estimates of the SCC represent a 
partial accounting of climate change 
impacts. The quantitative account 
presented here is accompanied by a 
qualitative appraisal of climate-related 
impacts presented elsewhere in this 
proposal. For example, Section III.F.2 of 
the preamble presents a summary of the 
impacts and risks of climate change 
projected in the absence of actions to 
mitigate GHG emissions. Section III.F.2 
is based on EPA documents that 
synthesize major findings from the best 
available scientific assessments of the 
scientific literature that have gone 
through rigorous and transparent peer 
review, including the major assessment 
reports of both the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the 
U.S. Climate Change Science 
Program.359 
The rest of this preamble section will 
provide the basis for the interim SCC 
values, and the estimates of the total 
climate-related benefits of the proposed 
rule that follow from these interim 
values. 
b. Derivation of Interim Social Cost of 
Carbon Values 
The ‘‘social cost of carbon’’ (SCC) is 
intended to be a monetary measure of 
the incremental damage resulting from 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, 
including (but not limited to) net 
agricultural productivity loss, human 
health effects, property damages from 
sea level rise, and changes in ecosystem 
services. Any effort to quantify and to 
monetize the consequences associated 
with climate change will raise serious 
questions of science, economics, and 
ethics. But with full regard for the limits 
of both quantification and monetization, 
the SCC can be used to provide an 
estimate of the social benefits of 
reductions in GHG emissions. 
For at least three reasons, any 
particular figure will be contestable. 
First, scientific and economic 
knowledge about the impacts of climate 
change continues to grow. With new 
and better information about relevant 
questions, including the cost, burdens, 
and possibility of adaptation, current 
estimates will inevitably change over 
time. Second, some of the likely and 
potential damages from climate 
change—for example, the loss of 
endangered species—are generally not 
included in current SCC estimates. 
These omissions may turn out to be 
significant, in the sense that they may 
mean that the best current estimates are 
too low. As noted by the IPCC Fourth 
Assessment Report, ‘‘It is very likely that 
globally aggregated figures 
underestimate the damage costs because 
they cannot include many non- 
quantifiable impacts.’’ 360 Third, when 
economic efficiency criteria, under 
specific assumptions, are juxtaposed 
with ethical considerations, the 
outcome may be controversial.361 These 
ethical considerations, including those 
involving the treatment of future 
generations, should and will also play a 
role in judgments about the SCC (see in 
particular the discussion of the discount 
rate, below). 
To date, SCC estimates presented in 
recent regulatory documents have 
varied within and among agencies, 
including DOT, DOE, and EPA. For 
example, a regulation proposed by DOT 
in 2008 assumed a value of $7 per 
metric ton CO2 (2006$) for 2011 
emission reductions (with a range of 
$0–14 for sensitivity analysis; see EPA 
Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472).362

ton of CO2 emissions. Some discussions of the SCC 
in the literature use an alternative presentation of 
a dollar per metric ton of carbon. The standard 
adjustment factor is 3.67, which means, for

EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472. 
A regulation proposed by DOE in 2009 
used a range of $0–$20 (2007$). Both of 
these ranges were designed to reflect the 
value of damages to the United States 
resulting from carbon emissions, or the 
‘‘domestic’’ SCC. In the final MY2011 
CAFE EIS, DOT used both a domestic 
SCC value of $2/tCO2 and a global SCC 
value of $33/tCO2 (with sensitivity 
analysis at $80/tCO2) (in 2006 dollars 
for 2007 emissions), increasing at 2.4% 
per year thereafter. The final MY2011 
CAFE rule also presented a range from 
$2 to $80/tCO2 (see EPA Docket, EPA– 
HQ–OAR–2009–0472, for the MY2011 
EIS and final rule). EPA’s Advance 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for 
Greenhouse Gases discussed the 
benefits of reducing GHG emissions and 
identified what it described as ‘‘very 
preliminary’’ SCC estimates ‘‘subject to 
revision’’ that spanned three orders of 
magnitude. EPA’s global mean values 
were $68 and $40/tCO2 for discount 
rates of 2% and 3% respectively (in 
2006 real dollars for 2007 emissions).363 
The current Administration has 
worked to develop a transparent 
methodology for selecting a set of 
interim SCC estimates to use in 
regulatory analyses until a more 
comprehensive characterization of the 
SCC is developed. This discussion 
proposes a set of values for the interim 
social cost of carbon resulting from this 
methodology. It should be emphasized 
that the analysis here is preliminary. 
This proposed joint rulemaking presents 
SCC estimates that reflect the 
Administration’s current understanding 
of the relevant literature and will be 
used for the short-term while an 
interagency group develops a more 
comprehensive characterization of the 
distribution of SCC values for future 
economic and regulatory analyses. The 
interim values should not be viewed as 
an expectation about the results of the 
longer-term process. The 
Administration is seeking comment in 
this proposed rule on all of the 
scientific, economic, and ethical issues 
before establishing improved estimates 
for use in future rulemakings. 
The outcomes of the Administration’s 
process to develop interim values are 
judgments in favor of (a) global rather 
than domestic values, (b) an annual 
growth rate of 3%, and (c) interim global 
SCC estimates for 2007 (in 2007 dollars) 
of $56, $34, $20, $10, and $5 per ton of 
CO2. The proposed figures are based on 
the following judgments. 
i. Global and Domestic Measures 
Because of the distinctive nature of 
the climate change problem, we present 
both a global SCC and a fraction of that 
value that represents impacts that may 
occur within the borders of the U.S. 
alone, or a ‘‘domestic’’ SCC, but fix our 
attention on the global measure. This 
approach represents a departure from 
past practices, which relied, for the 
most part, on domestic measures. As a 
matter of law, both global and domestic 
values are permissible; the relevant 
statutory provisions are ambiguous and 
allow selection of either measure.364 
It is true that under OMB guidance, 
analysis from the domestic perspective 
is required, while analysis from the 
international perspective is optional. 
The domestic decisions of one nation 
are not typically based on a judgment 
about the effects of those decisions on 
other nations. But the climate change 
problem is highly unusual in the sense 
that it involves (a) a global public good 
in which (b) the emissions of one nation 
may inflict significant damages on other 
nations and (c) the United States is 
actively engaged in promoting an 
international agreement to reduce 
worldwide emissions. 
In these circumstances, we believe 
that the global measure is preferred. Use 
of a global measure reflects the reality 
of the problem and is consistent with 
the continuing efforts of the United 
States to ensure that emissions 
reductions occur in many nations. 
Domestic SCC values are also 
presented. The development of a 
domestic SCC is greatly complicated by 
the relatively few region- or country- 
specific estimates of the SCC in the 
literature. One potential source of 
estimates comes from EPA’s ANPR 
Benefits TSD, using the Climate 
Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation 
and Distribution (FUND) model.365 The 
resulting estimates suggest that the ratio 
of domestic to global benefits varies 
with key parameter assumptions. With a 
3% discount rate, for example, the U.S. 
benefit is about 6% of the global benefit 
of GHG reductions for the ‘‘central’’ 
(mean) FUND results, while, for the 
corresponding ‘‘high’’ estimates 
associated with a higher climate 
sensitivity and lower global economic 
growth, the U.S. benefit is less than 4% 
of the global benefit. With a 2% 
discount rate, the U.S. share is about 
2–5% of the global estimate. Comments 
are requested on whether the share of 
U.S. SCC is correlated with the discount 
rate. 
Based on this available evidence, an 
interim domestic SCC value equal to 6% 
of the global damages is proposed. This 
figure is around the middle of the range 
of available estimates cited above. It is 
recognized that the 6% figure is 
approximate and highly speculative. 
Alternative approaches will be explored 
before establishing improved values for 
future rulemakings. However, it should 
be noted that it is difficult to apportion 
global benefits to different regions. For 
example, impacts outside the U.S. 
border can have significant welfare 
implications for U.S. populations (e.g. 
tourism, disaster relief) and if not 
included, these omissions will lead to 
an underestimation of the ‘‘domestic’’ 
SCC. We request comment on this issue. 
ii. Filtering Existing Analyses 
There are numerous SCC estimates in 
the existing literature, and it is 
reasonable to make use of those 
estimates in order to produce a figure 
for current use. A starting point is 
provided by the meta-analysis in 
Richard Tol, 2008.366 With that starting 
point, the Administration proposes to 
‘‘filter’’ existing SCC estimates by using 
those that (1) are derived from peer- 
reviewed studies; (2) do not weight the 
monetized damages to one country more 
than those in other countries; (3) use a 
‘‘business as usual’’ climate scenario; 
and (4) are based on the most recent 
published version of each of the three 
major integrated assessment models 
(IAMs): FUND, Policy Analysis for the 
Greenhouse Effect (PAGE), and DICE. 
Proposal (1) is based on the view that 
those studies that have been subject to 
peer review are more likely to be 
reliable than those that have not. 
Proposal (2) avoids treating the citizens 
of one nation (or different citizens 
within the U.S.) differently on the basis

367 However, it is acknowledged that the most 
recently published results do not necessarily repeat 
prior modeling exercises with an updated model, so 
valuable information may be lost, for instance, 
estimates of the SCC using specific climate 
sensitivities or economic scenarios. In addition, 
although some older model versions were used to 
produce estimates between 1996 and 2001, there 
have been no significant modeling paradigm 
changes since 1996. 
368 See OMB Circular A–4, pp. 35–36, citing 
Portney and Weyant, eds. (1999), Discounting and 
Intergenerational Equity, Resources for the Future, 
Washington, DC. See EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR– 
2009–0472. 
of income considerations, which some 
may find controversial and in any event 
would significantly complicate that 
analysis. In addition, that approach is 
consistent with the potential 
compensation tests of Kaldor (1939) and 
Hicks (1940), which form the 
conceptual foundations of benefit-cost 
analysis and use unweighted sums of 
willingness to pay. Finally, this is the 
approach used in rulemakings across a 
variety of settings and consequently 
keeps USG policy consistent across 
contexts. 
Proposal (3) stems from the judgment 
that as a general rule, the proper way to 
assess a policy decision is by comparing 
the implementation of the policy against 
a counterfactual state where the policy 
is not implemented. In addition, our 
expectation is that most policies to be 
evaluated using these interim SCC 
estimates will constitute sufficiently 
small changes to the larger economy to 
make it safe to assume that the marginal 
benefits of emissions reductions will not 
change between the baseline and policy 
scenarios. 
Proposal (4) is based on four 
complementary judgments. First, the 
FUND, PAGE, and DICE models now 
stand as the most comprehensive and 
reliable efforts to measure the economic 
damages from climate change. Second, 
the latest versions of the three IAMs are 
likely to reflect the most recent evidence 
and learning, and hence they are 
presumed to be superior to those that 
preceded them.367 
Third, any effort to choose among 
them, or to reject one in favor of the 
others, would be difficult to defend at 
the present time. In the absence of a 
clear reason to choose among them, it is 
reasonable to base the SCC on all of 
them. Fourth, in light of the 
uncertainties associated with the SCC, a 
range of values is more representative 
and the additional information offered 
by different models should be taken into 
account. 
iii. Use a Model-Weighted Average of 
the Estimates at Each Discount Rate 
We have just noted that at this time, 
a strong reason to prefer any of the three 
major IAMs (FUND, PAGE, and DICE) 
over the others has not been identified. 
To address the concern that certain 
models not be given unequal weight 
relative to the others, the estimates are 
based on an equal weighting of the 
means of the estimates from each of the 
models. Among estimates that remain 
after applying the filter, we begin by 
taking the average of all estimates 
within a model. The estimated SCC is 
then calculated as the average of the 
three model-specific averages. This 
approach is used to ensure that models 
with a greater number of published 
results do not exert unequal weight on 
the interim SCC estimates. 
It should be noted, however, that the 
resulting set of SCC estimates does not 
provide information about variability 
among or within models except in so far 
as they have different discounting 
assumptions. Comment is sought on 
whether model-weighting averaging of 
published estimates is appropriate for 
developing interim SCC estimates. 
iv. Apply a 3% Annual Growth Rate to 
the Chosen SCC Values 
SCC is expected to increase over time, 
because future emissions are expected 
to produce larger incremental damages 
as physical and economic systems 
become more stressed as the magnitude 
of climate change increases. Indeed, an 
implied growth rate in the SCC can be 
produced by most of the models that 
estimate economic damages caused by 
increased GHG emissions in future 
years. But neither the rate itself nor the 
information necessary to derive its 
implied value is commonly reported. In 
light of the limited amount of debate 
thus far about the appropriate growth 
rate of the SCC, applying a rate of 3% 
per year seems appropriate at this stage. 
This value is consistent with the range 
recommended by IPCC (2007) and close 
to the latest published estimate (Hope 
2008) (see EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR– 
2009–0472, for both citations). 
(1) Discount Rates 
For estimation of the benefits 
associated with the mitigation of climate 
change, one of the most complex issues 
involves the appropriate discount rate. 
OMB’s current guidance offers a 
detailed discussion of the relevant 
issues and calls for discount rates of 3% 
and 7%. It also permits a sensitivity 
analysis with low rates (1–3%) for 
intergenerational problems: ‘‘If your rule 
will have important intergenerational 
benefits or costs you might consider a 
further sensitivity analysis using a lower 
but positive discount rate in addition to 
calculating net benefits using discount 
rates of 3 and 7 percent.’’ 368 
The choice of a discount rate, 
especially over long periods of time, 
raises highly contested and exceedingly 
difficult questions of science, 
economics, philosophy, and law. See, 
e.g., William Nordhaus, The Challenge 
of Global Warming (2008); Nicholas 
Stern, The Economics of Climate 
Change (2008); Discounting and 
Intergenerational Equity (Paul Portney 
and John Weyant eds. 1999), in the EPA 
Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472. 
Under imaginable assumptions, 
decisions based on cost-benefit analysis 
with high discount rates might harm 
future generations—at least if 
investments are not made for the benefit 
of those generations. See Robert Lind, 
Analysis for Intergenerational 
Discounting, id. at 173, 176–177 (1999), 
in the EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR– 
2009–0472. It is not clear that future 
generations would be willing to trade 
environmental quality for consumption 
at the same rate as the current 
generations. It is also possible that the 
use of low discount rates for particular 
projects might itself harm future 
generations, by diverting resources from 
private or public sector investments 
with higher rates of return for future 
generations. In the context of climate 
change, questions of intergenerational 
equity are especially important. 
Because of the substantial length of 
time in which CO2 and other GHG 
emissions reside in the atmosphere, 
choosing a high discount rate could 
result in irreversible changes in CO2 
concentrations, and possibly irreversible 
climate changes (unless substantial 
reductions in short-lived climate forcing 
emissions are achieved). Even if these 
changes are reversible, delaying 
mitigation efforts could result in 
substantially higher costs of stabilizing 
CO2 concentrations. On the other hand, 
using too low a discount rate in benefit- 
cost analysis may suggest some 
potentially economically unwarranted 
investments in mitigation. It is also 
possible that the use of low discount 
rates for particular projects might itself 
harm future generations, by ensuring 
that resources are not used in a way that 
would greatly benefit them. We invite 
comment on the methods used to select 
discount rates for application in 
deriving SCC values, and in particular, 
application of the Newell and Pizer 
work on uncertainty in discount rates in 
developing the SCC used in evaluating 
the climate-related benefits of this 
proposal. Comments are requested on 
the use of the rates discussed in this 
preamble and on alternative rates. We

369 Specifically, if the benefits of the policy are 
highly correlated with the returns from the broader 
economy, then the market rate should be used to 
discount the benefits. If the benefits are 
uncorrelated with the broader economy the long 
term government bond rate should be applied. 
Furthermore, if the benefits are negatively 
correlated with the broader economy, a rate less 
than that on long term government bonds should be 
used (Lind, 1982 pp. 89–90).

371 Sterner and Persson (2008) note that a 
consistent treatment of the marginal utility of 
consumption would require that if higher discount 
rates are justified by the diminishing marginal 
utility of consumption, e.g., a dollar of damages is 
worth less to future generations because they have 
greater income, then so-called equity weights 
should be used to account for the higher value that 
countries with lower income would place on a 
dollar of damages relative to the U.S. This is a 
consistent and logical outcome of application of the 
Ramsey framework. Because the distribution of 
climate change related damages is expected to be 
skewed towards developing nations with lower 
incomes, this can have significant implications for 
estimates of total global SCC if the Ramsey 
framework is used to derive discount rates. See EPA 
Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472 for Sterner and 
Persson (2008). 
372 However, because climate change impacts may 
be outside the bounds of historical evidence, 
predictions about future growth in consumption 
based on past experience may be inaccurate.

also invite comment on how to best 
address the ethical and policy concerns 
in the context of selecting the 
appropriate discount rate. 
Reasonable arguments support the use 
of a 3% discount rate. First, that rate is 
among the two figures suggested by 
OMB guidance, and hence it fits with 
existing national policy. Second, it is 
standard to base the discount rate on the 
compensation that people receive for 
delaying consumption, and the 3% is 
close to the risk-free rate of return, 
proxied by the return on long term 
inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury Bonds, 
as of this writing. Although these rates 
are currently closer to 2.5%, the use of 
3% provides an adjustment for the 
liquidity premium that is reflected in 
these bonds’ returns. However, this 
approach does not adjust for the 
significantly longer time horizon 
associated with climate change impacts. 
It could also be argued that the discount 
rate should be lower than 3% if the 
benefits of climate mitigation policies 
tend to be higher than expected in time 
periods when the returns to investments 
in rest of the economy are lower than 
normal. 
At the same time, others would argue 
that a 5% discount rate can be 
supported. The argument relies on 
several assumptions. First, this rate can 
be justified by reference to the level of 
compensation for delaying 
consumption, because it fits with 
market behavior with respect to 
individuals’ willingness to trade-off 
consumption across periods as 
measured by the estimated post-tax 
average real returns to risky private 
investments (e.g., the S&P 500). In the 
climate setting, the 5% discount rate 
may be preferable to the riskless rate 
because the benefits to mitigation are 
not known with certainty. In principal, 
the correct discount rate would reflect 
the variance in payoff from climate 
mitigation policy and the correlation 
between the payoffs of the policy and 
the broader economy.369 
Second, 5%, and not 3%, is roughly 
consistent with estimates implied by 
inputs to the theoretically derived 
Ramsey equation presented below, 
which specifies the optimal time path 
for consumption. That equation 
specifies the optimal discount rate as 
the sum of two components. The first 
term (the product of the elasticity of the 
marginal utility of consumption and the 
growth rate of consumption) reflects the 
fact that consumption in the future is 
likely to be higher than consumption 
today, so diminishing marginal utility 
implies that the same monetary damage 
will cause a smaller reduction of utility 
in the future. Standard estimates of this 
term from the economics literature are 
in the range of 3%–5%.370 The second 
component reflects the possibility that a 
lower weight should be placed on utility 
in the future, to account for social 
impatience or extinction risk, which is 
specified by a pure rate of time 
preference (PRTP). A common estimate 
of the PRTP is 2%, though some 
observers believe that a principle of 
intergenerational equity suggests that 
the PRTP should be close to zero. It 
follows that discount rate of 5% is near 
the middle of the range of values that 
are able to be derived from the Ramsey 
equation.371 
It is recognized that the arguments 
above—for use of market behavior and 
the Ramsey equation—face objections in 
the context of climate change, and of 
course there are alternative approaches. 
In light of climate change, it is possible 
that consumption in the future will not 
be higher than consumption today, and 
if so, the Ramsey equation will suggest 
a lower figure. The historical evidence 
is consistent with rising consumption 
over time.372 
Some critics contend that using 
observed interest rates for inter- 
generational decisions imposes current 
preferences on future generations. For 
intergenerational equity, they argue that 
the discount rate should be below 
market rates to correct for market 
distortions and inefficiencies in 
intergenerational transfers of wealth 
(which are presumed to compensate 
future generations for damage), and to 
treat generations equitably based on 
ethical principles (see Broome 2008 in 
the EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009– 
0472).373 
Additionally, some analyses attempt 
to deal with uncertainty with respect to 
interest rates over time. We explore 
below how this might be done.374 
(2) Proposed Interim Estimates 
The application of the methodology 
outlined above yields interim estimates 
of the SCC that are reported in Table 
III.H.6–1. These estimates are reported 
separately using 3% and 5% discount 
rates. The cells are empty in rows 10 
and 11, because these studies did not 
report estimates of the SCC at a 3% 
discount rate. The model-weighted 
means are reported in the final or 
summary row; they are $34 per tCO2 at 
a 3% discount rate and $5 per tCO2 with 
a 5% discount rate.

375 Most of the estimates in Table 1 rely on 
climate scenarios developed by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
The IPCC published a new set of scenarios in 2000 
for use in the Third Assessment Report (Special 
Report on Emissions Scenarios—SRES). The SRES 
scenarios define four narrative storylines: A1, A2, 
B1 and B2, describing the relationships between the 
forces driving greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions 
and their evolution during the 21st century for large 
world regions and globally. Each storyline 
represents different demographic, social, economic, 
technological, and environmental developments 
that diverge in increasingly irreversible ways. The 
storylines are summarized in the SRES report 
(Nakicenovic et al., 2000; see also http:// 
sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/ddc/sres/) (see EPA 
Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472). Although they 
were intended to represent BAU scenarios, at this 
point in time the B1 and B2 storylines are widely 
viewed as representing policy cases rather than 
business-as-usual projections, estimates derived 
from these scenarios to be less appropriate for use 
in benefit-cost analysis. They are therefore 
excluded. 
376 Guo et al. (2006) report estimates based on two 
Gollier discounting schemes. The Gollier 
discounting assumes complex specifications about 
individual utility functions and risk preferences. 
After various conditions are satisfied, declining 
social discount rates emerge. Gollier Discounting 
Scheme 1 employs a certainty-equivalent social rate 
of time preference (SRTP) derived by assuming the 
regional growth rate is equally likely to be 1% 
above or below the original forecast growth rate. 
Gollier Discounting Scheme 2 calculates a certainty- 
equivalent social rate of time preference (SRTP) 
using five possible growth rates, and applies the 
new SRTP instead of the original. Hope (2008) 
conducts Monte Carlo analysis on the PRTP 
component of the discount rate. The PRTP is 
modeled as a triangular distribution with a min 
value of 1%/yr, a most likely value of 2%/yr, and 
a max value of 3%/yr. See EPA Docket, EPA–HQ– 
OAR–2009–0472 for the studies. 
377 It should be noted that reported discount rates 
may not be consistently derived across models or 
specific applications of models: While the discount 
rate may be identical, it may reflect different 
assumptions about the individual components of 
the Ramsey equation identified earlier. 
378 In contrast, an alternative approach based on 
Weitzman (2001) would assume that there is a 
constant discount rate that is uncertain and 
represented by a probability distribution. The

a The sample includes all peer reviewed, non-equity-weighted estimates included in Tol (2008), Nordhaus (2008), Hope (2008), and Anthoff et 
al. (2009), that are based on the most recent published version of FUND, PAGE, or DICE and use business-as-usual climate scenarios.375 376 All 
values are based on the best available information from the underlying studies about the base year and year dollars, rather than the Tol (2008) 
assumption that all estimates included in his review are 1995 values in 1995$. All values were updated to 2007 using a 3% annual growth rate in 
the SCC, and adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator. 
b See EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472, for each study. 
In this proposal, benefits of reducing 
GHG emissions have been estimated 
using global SCC values of $34 and $5 
as these represent the estimates 
associated with the 3% and 5% 
discount rates, respectively.377 The 3% 
and 5% estimates have independent 
appeal and at this time a clear 
preference for one over the other is not 
warranted. Thus, we have also 
included—and centered our current 
attention on—the average of the 
estimates associated with these discount 
rates, which is $20. (Based on the $20 
global value, the approximate domestic 
fraction of these benefits would be $1.20 
per ton of CO2 assuming that domestic 
benefits are 6% of the global benefits.) 
The distinctions between sets of 
estimates generated using different 
discount rates are due only in part to 
discount rate differences, because the 
models and parameters used to generate 
the estimates in the sets associated with 
different discount rates also vary. 
It is true that there is uncertainty 
about interest rates over long time 
horizons. Recognizing that point, 
Newell and Pizer (2003) have made a 
careful effort to adjust for that 
uncertainty (see EPA Docket, EPA–HQ– 
OAR–2009–0472). The Newell-Pizer 
approach models discount rate 
uncertainty as something that evolves 
over time.378 This is a different way to 
model discount rate uncertainty than 
the approach outlined above, which 
assumes there is a single discount rate 
with equal probability of 3% and 5%. 
Since Newell and Pizer (2003) is a 
relatively recent contribution to the 
literature, estimates based on this 
method are included with the aim of 
soliciting comment. 
Table III.H.6–2 reports on the 
application of the Newell-Pizer 
adjustments. The precise numbers 
depend on the assumptions about the 
data generating process that governs 
interest rates. Columns (1a) and (1b) 
assume that ‘‘random walk’’ model best 
describes the data and uses 3% and 5% 
discount rates, respectively. Columns 
(2a) and (2b) repeat this, except that it 
assumes a ‘‘mean-reverting’’ process. 
While the empirical evidence does not 
rule out a mean-reverting model, Newell 
and Pizer find stronger empirical 
support for the random walk model. 
EPA solicits comment on these and 
other models for representing the 
variation in interest rates over time.

379 Examples of impacts that are difficult to 
monetize, and have generally not been included in 
SCC estimates, include risks from extreme weather 
(death, disease, agricultural damage, and other 
economic damage from droughts, floods and 
wildfires) and possible long-term catastrophic 
events, such as collapse of the West Antarctic ice 
sheet or the release of large amounts of methane 
from melting permafrost.

a The sample includes all peer reviewed, non-equity-weighted estimates included in Tol (2008), Nordhaus (2008), Hope (2008), and Anthoff et 
al. (2009), that are based on the most recent published version of FUND, PAGE, or DICE and use business-as-usual climate scenarios. All val-
ues are based on the best available information from the underlying studies about the base year and year dollars, rather than the Tol (2008) as-
sumption that all estimates included in his review are 1995 values in 1995$. All values were updated to 2007 using a 3% annual growth rate in 
the SCC, and adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator. See the Notes to Table III.H.6–1 for further details. 
b Assumes a starting discount rate of 3% or 5%. Newell and Pizer (2003) based adjustment factors are not applied to estimates from Guo et al. 
(2006) that use a different approach to account for discount rate uncertainty (rows 7–8). 
Note that the correction factor from Newell and Pizer is based on the DICE model. The proper adjustment may differ for other integrated as-
sessment models that produce different time schedules of marginal damages. We would expect this difference to be minor. 
c See EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR–2009–0472, for each study. 
The resulting estimates of the social 
cost of carbon are necessarily greater. 
When the adjustments from the random 
walk model are applied, the estimates of 
the social cost of carbon are $10 and $56 
per ton of CO2, with the 5% and 3% 
discount rates, respectively. The 
application of the mean-reverting 
adjustment yields estimates of $6 and 
$37. Relying on the random walk model, 
analyses are also conducted with the 
value of the SCC set at $10 and $56. 
(3) Caveats 
There are at least four caveats to the 
approach outlined above. 
First, and as noted, the existing IAMs 
do not currently individually account 
for and assign value to all of the 
important physical and other impacts of 
climate change that are recognized in 
the climate change literature.379 The 
impacts of climate change are expected 
to be widespread, diverse, and 
heterogeneous. In addition, the exact 
magnitude of these impacts is uncertain, 
because of the inherent randomness in 
the Earth’s atmospheric processes, the 
U.S. and global economies, and the 
behaviors of current and future 
populations. To this extent, as 
emphasized by the IPCC, SCC estimates 
are ‘‘very likely’’ underestimated.380 In 
addition, the SCC approach also likely 
underestimates the value of GHG 
reductions because the marginal values 
apply only to CO2 emissions, which 
have different impacts than non-CO2 
emissions because of variances in 
atmospheric lifetimes and radiative 
forcing.381 Although it is likely that our 
capability to quantify and monetize 
impacts will improve with time, it is 
also likely that even in future 
applications, a number of potentially 
significant benefits categories will 
remain unmonetized. In order to capture 
the benefits of mitigation these non- 
monetized benefits should be discussed 
along with monetized benefits based on 
the SCC. 
Second, in the opposite direction, it is 
unlikely that the damage estimates 
adequately account for the directed 
technological change that climate 
change will cause. In particular, climate 
change will increase the return on 
investment to develop technologies that 
allow individuals to cope with climate 
change. For example, it is likely that 
scientists will develop crops that are 
better able to withstand high 
temperatures. In this respect, the current 
estimates may overstate the likely 
quantified damages, though the costs 
associated with the investments in 
adaptive technologies must also be 
considered (technologies must also be 
included in the calculations, as the 
benefits should reflect net welfare 
changes to society). 
Third, there has been considerable 
recent discussion of the risk of 
catastrophic impacts and of how best to 
account for worst-case scenarios. Recent 
work by Weitzman (2009) specifies 
some conditions under which the 
possibility of catastrophe would 
undermine the use of IAMs and 
conventional cost-benefit analysis.382 
This research requires further 
exploration before its generality is 
known and the proper way to 
incorporate it into regulatory reviews is 
understood. We also request comments 
on approaches for measuring the 
premium associated with reductions in

383 Specifically, Newell and Pizer (2003) found 
that modeling of uncertainty in economic growth 
causes the effective discount rate to decline over 
time. When starting at a 4% discount rate, the 
effective discount rate is 2% at 100 years and 1% 
at 200 years. See EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–OAR– 
2009–0472. 
384 The Supreme Court recognized in 
Massachusetts v. EPA that a single action will not 
on its own achieve all needed GHG reductions, 
noting that ‘‘[a]gencies, like legislatures, do not 
generally resolve massive problems in one fell 
regulatory swoop.’’ See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 
U.S. at 524 (2007). See EPA Docket, EPA–HQ– 
OAR–2009–0472. 
climate-related risks such as 
catastrophic events. 
Fourth, it is also worth noting that the 
SCC estimates are only relevant for 
incremental policies relative to the 
projected baselines, which capture 
business-as-usual scenarios. To evaluate 
non-marginal changes, such as might 
occur if the U.S. acts in tandem with 
other nations, it might be necessary to 
go beyond the simple expedient of using 
the SCC along the BAU path. This 
approach would require explicitly 
calculating the total benefits in a move 
from the BAU scenario to the policy 
scenario, without imposing the 
restriction that the marginal benefit 
remains constant over this range. 
(4) Other options 
The Administration considered other 
interim SCC options in addition to the 
approach described above; we request 
comment on each of them. One 
alternative option was to bring in SCC 
estimates in studies published after 
1995, rather than limiting the estimates 
to those in studies relying on the most 
recent published version of each of the 
three major integrated assessment 
models: PAGE, FUND, and DICE. 
Although some older model versions 
(and old versions of other models) were 
used to produce estimates between 1996 
and 2001, it appears that there have 
been no significant modeling paradigm 
changes since 1996. 
Another option was to select a range 
of SCC values for separate discount 
rates. For example, sensitivity analysis 
could be conducted at the lowest and 
highest SCC values reported in the 
filtered set of estimates for each 
discount rate considered. If considering 
SCC estimates from studies published 
after 1995 and a discount rate of 2 
percent, this option would result in a 
range of SCC values of $5/t-CO2 to $260/ 
t-CO2 (2007 emissions in 2007 dollars); 
at a 3 percent discount rate, the range 
would be $0 to $58/t-CO2. 
Finally, we considered the possibility 
that different assumptions under the 
Ramsey framework, such as placing 
approximately equal weight on the 
welfare of current and future 
generations, would imply a lower 
discount rate, such as 2%. The Newell 
and Pizer (2003) method applied to 
recent long-term risk free rates would 
likewise be approximately consistent 
with a certainty equivalent rate of 
2%.383 
(5) Ongoing SCC Development 
As noted, this is an emphatically 
interim SCC value. The judgments 
described here will be subject to further 
scrutiny and exploration. 
c. Application of Interim SCC Estimates 
to GHG Emissions Reductions From 
This Proposed Rule 
The strategy underlying these joint 
proposals—to coordinate Federal efforts 
to reduce GHGs—warrants 
consideration when assessing the 
benefits. To be sure, while no single rule 
or action can independently achieve the 
deep worldwide emissions reductions 
necessary to halt and reverse the growth 
of GHGs. But the combined effects of 
multiple strategies to reduce GHG 
emissions domestically and abroad 
could make a major difference in the 
climate change impacts experienced by 
future generations.384 
The projected net GHG emissions 
reductions associated with the proposal 
reflect an incremental change to 
projected total global emissions. 
Therefore, as shown in Section III.F.3, 
the projected global climate signal will 
be small but discernible—an 
incrementally lower projected 
distribution of global mean surface 
temperatures. 
Given that the climate response is 
projected to be a marginal change 
relative to the baseline climate, we 
estimate the marginal value of changes 
in climate change impacts over time and 
use this value to measure the monetized 
marginal benefits of the GHG emissions 
reductions projected for this proposal. 
Accordingly, EPA and NHTSA have 
used the set of interim, global SCC 
values described above to estimate the 
benefits of these coordinated proposals. 
The interim SCC values, which reflect 
the Administration’s interim 
interpretation of the current literature, 
are $5 (based on a 5% discount rate), 
$10 (5% using Newell-Pizer 
adjustment), $20 (average SCC value 
from the average SCC estimates based 
on 5% and 3%), $34 (3%), and $56 (3% 
using Newell-Pizer adjustment), in 2007 
dollars, and are based on a CO2 
emissions change of 1 metric ton in 
2007. Table III.H.6–3 presents the 
interim SCC values in other years in 
2007 dollars. These values are presented 
as one of many considerations that will 
inform the Administration’s action on 
this proposed rule.

b SCC values are adjusted based on Newell and Pizer (2003) to account to future uncertainty in discount rates. See EPA Docket, EPA–HQ–

Tables III.H.6–4 to III.H.6–6 provide 
the annual benefits for each year 
impacted by the proposed rule. As 
discussed above, marginal benefits of 
GHG reductions are projected to grow 
over time. The tables below summarize 
the total benefits for the lifetime of the 
rule, which are calculated by using the 
five interim SCC values.

multiplying the marginal benefits 
estimates per metric ton of CO2 (the

reductions in CO2 for that year. Table 
III.H.6–5 approximates the total

by multiplying the SCC value by the 
reductions in non-CO2 GHGs for that 
year. Marginal benefit estimates per 
metric ton of non-CO2 GHGs are 
currently unavailable, but work is on- 
going to monetize benefits related to the 
mitigation of other non-CO2 GHGs. 
Inclusion of these benefits is planned

7. Non-Greenhouse Gas Health and 
Environmental Impacts 
This section presents EPA’s analysis 
of the non-GHG health and 
environmental impacts that can be 
expected to occur as a result of the 
proposed light-duty vehicle GHG rule. 
GHG emissions are predominantly the 
byproduct of fossil fuel combustion 
processes that also produce criteria and 
hazardous air pollutants. The vehicles 
that are subject to the proposed 
standards are also significant sources of 
mobile source air pollution such as 
direct PM, NOX, VOCs and air toxics. 
The proposed standards would affect 
exhaust emissions of these pollutants 
from vehicles. They would also affect 
emissions from upstream sources 
related to changes in fuel consumption. 
Changes in ambient ozone, PM2.5, and 
air toxics that would result from the 
proposed standards are expected to 
affect human health in the form of 
premature deaths and other serious 
human health effects, as well as other 
important public health and welfare 
effects. 
It is important to quantify the health 
and environmental impacts associated 
with the proposed standard because a 
failure to adequately consider these 
ancillary co-pollutant impacts could 
lead to an incorrect assessment of their 
net costs and benefits. Moreover, co- 
pollutant impacts tend to accrue in the 
near term, while any effects from 
reduced climate change mostly accrue 
over a time frame of several decades or 
longer. 
EPA typically quantifies and 
monetizes the health and environmental 
impacts related to both PM and ozone 
in its regulatory impact analyses (RIAs), 
when possible. However, EPA was 
unable to do so in time for this proposal. 
EPA attempts to make emissions and air 
quality modeling decisions early in the 
analytical process so that we can 
complete the photochemical air quality

modeling and use that data to inform 
the health and environmental impacts 
analysis. Resource and time constraints 
precluded the Agency from completing 
this work in time for the proposal. 
Instead, EPA is using PM-related 
benefits-per-ton values as an interim 
approach to estimating the PM-related 
benefits of the proposal. EPA also 
provides a complete characterization of 
the health and environmental impacts 
that will be quantified and monetized 
for the final rulemaking. 
This section is split into two sub- 
sections: the first presents the PM- 
related benefits-per-ton values used to 
monetize the PM-related co-benefits 
associated with the proposal; the second 
explains what PM- and ozone-related 
health and environmental impacts EPA 
will quantify and monetize in the 
analysis for the final rule. EPA bases its 
analyses on peer-reviewed studies of air 
quality and health and welfare effects 
and peer-reviewed studies of the 
monetary values of public health and 
welfare improvements, and is generally 
consistent with benefits analyses 
performed for the analysis of the final 
Ozone National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard (NAAQS) and the final PM 
NAAQS analysis, as well as the recent 
Portland Cement National Emissions 
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
(NESHAP) RIA (U.S. EPA, 2009a), and 
NO2 NAAQS (U.S.≤ EPA, 
2009b).385 386 387 388 
Though EPA is characterizing the 
changes in emissions associated with 
toxic pollutants, we will not be able to 
quantify or monetize the human health 
effects associated with air toxic 
pollutants for either the proposal or the 
final rule analyses. Please refer to 
Section III.G for more information about 
the air toxics emissions impacts 
associated with the proposed standards. 
a. Economic Value of Reductions in 
Criteria Pollutants 
As described in Section III.G, the 
proposed standards would reduce 
emissions of several criteria and toxic 
pollutants and precursors. In this 
analysis, EPA estimates the economic 
value of the human health benefits 
associated with reducing PM2.5 
exposure. Due to analytical limitations, 
this analysis does not estimate benefits 
related to other criteria pollutants (such 
as ozone, NO2 or SO2) or toxics 
pollutants, nor does it monetize all of 
the potential health and welfare effects 
associated with PM2.5. 
This analysis uses a ‘‘benefit-per-ton’’ 
method to estimate a selected suite of 
PM2.5-related health benefits described 
below. These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton 
estimates provide the total monetized 
human health benefits (the sum of 
premature mortality and premature 
morbidity) of reducing one ton of 
directly emitted PM2.5, or its precursors 
(such as NOX, SOX, and VOCs), from a 
specified source. Ideally, the human 
health benefits would be estimated 
based on changes in ambient PM2.5 as 
determined by full-scale air quality 
modeling. However, this modeling was 
not possible in the timeframe for this 
proposal. 
The dollar-per-ton estimates used in 
this analysis are provided in Table 
III.H.7–1. In the summary of costs and 
benefits, Section III.H.10 of this 
preamble, EPA presents the monetized 
value of PM-related improvements 
associated with the proposal.

a The benefit-per-ton estimates presented in this table are based on an estimate of premature mortality derived from the ACS study (Pope et 
al., 2002). If the benefit-per-ton estimates were based on the Six Cities study (Laden et al., 2006), the values would be approximately 145% 
(nearly two-and-a-half times) larger. 
b The benefit-per-ton estimates presented in this table assume a 3% discount rate in the valuation of premature mortality to account for a twen-
ty-year segmented cessation lag. If a 7% discount rate had been used, the values would be approximately 9% lower. 
c Benefit-per-ton values were estimated for the years 2015, 2020, and 2030. For 2040, EPA and NHTSA extrapolated exponentially based on 
the growth between 2020 and 2030. 
d Note that the benefit-per-ton value for SOX is based on the value for Stationary (Non-EGU) sources; no SOX value was estimated for mobile 
sources. The benefit-per-ton value for VOCs was estimated across all sources. 
The benefit per-ton technique has 
been used in previous analyses, 
including EPA’s recent Ozone National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards

395 The values included in this report are different 
from those presented in the article cited above. 
Benefits methods change to reflect new information 
and evaluation of the science. Since publication of 
the June 2009 article, EPA has made two significant 
changes to its benefits methods: (1) We no longer 
assume that a threshold exists in PM-related models 
of health impacts; and (2) We have revised the 
Value of a Statistical Life to equal $6.3 million (year 
2000$), up from an estimate of $5.5 million (year 
2000$) used in the June 2009 report. Please refer to

Consistent with the NO2 NAAQS,392 
the benefits estimates utilize the 
concentration-response functions as 
reported in the epidemiology literature. 
To calculate the total monetized impacts 
associated with quantified health 
impacts, EPA applies values derived 
from a number of sources. For 
premature mortality, EPA applies a 
value of a statistical life (VSL) derived 
from the mortality valuation literature. 
For certain health impacts, such as 
chronic bronchitis and a number of 
respiratory-related ailments, EPA 
applies willingness-to-pay estimates 
derived from the valuation literature. 
For the remaining health impacts, EPA 
applies values derived from current 
cost-of-illness and/or wage estimates. 
Readers interested in reviewing the 
complete methodology for creating the 
benefit-per-ton estimates used in this 
analysis can consult the Technical 
Support Document (TSD) 393 
accompanying the recent final ozone 
NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008a). Readers 
can also refer to Fann et al. (2009) 394 for 
a detailed description of the benefit-per- 
ton methodology.395 A more detailed 
description of the benefit-per-ton 
estimates is also provided in the Draft 
Joint TSD that accompanies this 
rulemaking. 
As described in the documentation for 
the benefit per-ton estimates cited 
above, national per-ton estimates were 
developed for selected pollutant/source 
category combinations. The per-ton 
values calculated therefore apply only 
to tons reduced from those specific 
pollutant/source combinations (e.g., 
NO2 emitted from mobile sources; direct 
PM emitted from stationary sources). 
Our estimate of PM2.5 benefits is 
therefore based on the total direct PM2.5 
and PM-related precursor emissions 
controlled by sector and multiplied by 
each per-ton value. 
The benefit-per-ton estimates are 
subject to a number of assumptions and 
uncertainties. 
• They do not reflect local variability 
in population density, meteorology, 
exposure, baseline health incidence 
rates, or other local factors that might 
lead to an overestimate or underestimate 
of the actual benefits of controlling fine 
particulates. EPA will conduct full-scale 
air quality modeling for the final 
rulemaking in an effort to capture this 
variability. 
• This analysis assumes that all fine 
particles, regardless of their chemical 
composition, are equally potent in 
causing premature mortality. This is an 
important assumption, because PM2.5 
produced via transported precursors 
emitted from stationary sources may 
differ significantly from direct PM2.5 
released from diesel engines and other 
industrial sources, but no clear 
scientific grounds exist for supporting 
differential effects estimates by particle 
type. 
• This analysis assumes that the 
health impact function for fine particles 
is linear within the range of ambient 
concentrations under consideration. 
Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in 
areas with varied concentrations of 
PM2.5, including both regions that are in 
attainment with fine particle standard 
and those that do not meet the standard 
down to the lowest modeled 
concentrations. 
• There are several health benefits 
categories that EPA was unable to 
quantify due to limitations associated 
with using benefits-per-ton estimates, 
several of which could be substantial. 
Because the NOX and VOC emission 
reductions associated with this proposal 
are also precursors to ozone, reductions 
in NOX and VOC would also reduce 
ozone formation and the health effects 
associated with ozone exposure. 
Unfortunately, benefits-per-ton 
estimates do not exist due to issues 
associated with the complexity of the 
atmospheric air chemistry and 
nonlinearities associated with ozone 
formation. The PM-related benefits-per- 
ton estimates also do not include any 
human welfare or ecological benefits. 
Please refer to Chapter 7.3 of the RIA 
that accompanies this proposal for a 
description of the quantification and 
monetization of health impact for the 
FRM and a description of the 
unquantified co-pollutant benefits 
associated with this rulemaking. 
• There are many uncertainties 
associated with the health impact 
functions used in this modeling effort. 
These include: Within-study variability 
(the precision with which a given study 
estimates the relationship between air 
quality changes and health effects); 
across-study variation (different 
published studies of the same pollutant/

Evaluating the National-Scale Air Toxics 
Assessment for 1996—an SAB Advisory. http:// 
www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/sab/sabrev.html. 
398 In April, 2009, EPA hosted a workshop on 
estimating the benefits of reducing hazardous air 
pollutants. This workshop built upon the work 
accomplished in the June 2000 Science Advisory 
Board/EPA Workshop on the Benefits of Reductions 
in Exposure to Hazardous Air Pollutants, which 
generated thoughtful discussion on approaches to 
Continued 
health effect relationship typically do 
not report identical findings and in 
some instances the differences are 
substantial); the application of 
concentration-response functions 
nationwide (does not account for any 
relationship between region and health 
effect, to the extent that such a 
relationship exists); extrapolation of 
impact functions across population (we 
assumed that certain health impact 
functions applied to age ranges broader 
than that considered in the original 
epidemiological study); and various 
uncertainties in the concentration- 
response function, including causality 
and thresholds. These uncertainties may 
under- or over-estimate benefits. 
• EPA has investigated methods to 
characterize uncertainty in the 
relationship between PM2.5 exposure 
and premature mortality. EPA’s final 
PM2.5 NAAQS analysis provides a more 
complete picture about the overall 
uncertainty in PM2.5 benefits estimates. 
For more information, please consult 
the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5.5). 
• The benefit-per-ton estimates used 
in this analysis incorporate projections 
of key variables, including atmospheric 
conditions, source level emissions, 
population, health baselines and 
incomes, technology. These projections 
introduce some uncertainties to the 
benefit per ton estimates. 
• As described above, using the 
benefit-per-ton value derived from the 
ACS study (Pope et al., 2002) alone 
provides an incomplete characterization 
of PM2.5 benefits. When placed in the 
context of the Expert Elicitation results, 
this estimate falls toward the lower end 
of the distribution. By contrast, the 
estimated PM2.5 benefits using the 
coefficient reported by Laden in that 
author’s reanalysis of the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort fall toward the upper end 
of the Expert Elicitation distribution 
results. 
As mentioned above, emissions 
changes and benefits-per-ton estimates 
alone are not a good indication of local 
or regional air quality and health 
impacts, as there may be localized 
impacts associated with the proposed 
rulemaking. Additionally, the 
atmospheric chemistry related to 
ambient concentrations of PM2.5, ozone 
and air toxics is very complex. Full- 
scale photochemical modeling is 
therefore necessary to provide the 
needed spatial and temporal detail to 
more completely and accurately 
estimate the changes in ambient levels 
of these pollutants and their associated 
health and welfare impacts. As 
discussed above, timing and resource 
constraints precluded from conducting a 
full-scale photochemical air quality 
modeling analysis in time for the 
NPRM. For the final rule, however, a 
national-scale air quality modeling 
analysis will be performed to analyze 
the impacts of the standards on PM2.5, 
ozone, and selected air toxics. The 
benefits analysis plan for the final 
rulemaking is discussed in the next 
section. 
b. Human Health and Environmental 
Benefits for the Final Rule 
i. Human Health and Environmental 
Impacts 
To model the ozone and PM air 
quality benefits of the final rule, EPA 
will use the Community Multiscale Air 
Quality (CMAQ) model (see Section 
III.G.5.b for a description of the CMAQ 
model). The modeled ambient air 
quality data will serve as an input to the 
Environmental Benefits Mapping and 
Analysis Program (BenMAP).396 
BenMAP is a computer program 
developed by EPA that integrates a 
number of the modeling elements used 
in previous RIAs (e.g., interpolation 
functions, population projections, 
health impact functions, valuation 
functions, analysis and pooling 
methods) to translate modeled air 
concentration estimates into health 
effects incidence estimates and 
monetized benefits estimates. 
Chapter 7.3 in the DRIA that 
accompanies this proposal lists the co- 
pollutant health effect exposure- 
response functions EPA will use to 
quantify the co-pollutant incidence 
impacts associated with the final light- 
duty vehicles standard. These include 
PM- and ozone-related premature 
mortality, chronic bronchitis, nonfatal 
heart attacks, hospital admissions 
(respiratory and cardiovascular), 
emergency room visits, acute bronchitis, 
minor restricted activity days, and days 
of work and school lost. 
ii. Monetized Impacts 
To calculate the total monetized 
impacts associated with quantified 
health impacts, EPA applies values 
derived from a number of sources. For 
premature mortality, EPA applies a 
value of a statistical life (VSL) derived 
from the mortality valuation literature. 
For certain health impacts, such as 
chronic bronchitis and a number of 
respiratory-related ailments, EPA 
applies willingness-to-pay estimates 
derived from the valuation literature. 
For the remaining health impacts, EPA 
applies values derived from current 
cost-of-illness and/or wage estimates. 
Chapter 7.3 in the DRIA that 
accompanies this proposal presents the 
monetary values EPA will apply to 
changes in the incidence of health and 
welfare effects associated with 
reductions in non-GHG pollutants that 
will occur when these GHG control 
strategies are finalized. 
iii. Other Unquantified Health and 
Environmental Impacts 
In addition to the co-pollutant health 
and environmental impacts EPA will 
quantify for the analysis of the final 
standard, there are a number of other 
health and human welfare endpoints 
that EPA will not be able to quantify or 
monetize because of current limitations 
in the methods or available data. These 
impacts are associated with emissions of 
air toxics (including benzene, 1,3- 
butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 
acrolein, and ethanol), ambient ozone, 
and ambient PM2.5 exposures. Chapter 
7.3 of the DRIA lists these unquantified 
health and environmental impacts. 
While there will be impacts 
associated with air toxic pollutant 
emission changes that result from the 
final standard, EPA will not attempt to 
monetize those impacts. This is 
primarily because currently available 
tools and methods to assess air toxics 
risk from mobile sources at the national 
scale are not adequate for extrapolation 
to incidence estimations or benefits 
assessment. The best suite of tools and 
methods currently available for 
assessment at the national scale are 
those used in the National-Scale Air 
Toxics Assessment (NATA). The EPA 
Science Advisory Board specifically 
commented in their review of the 1996 
NATA that these tools were not yet 
ready for use in a national-scale benefits 
analysis, because they did not consider 
the full distribution of exposure and 
risk, or address sub-chronic health 
effects.397 While EPA has since 
improved the tools, there remain critical 
limitations for estimating incidence and 
assessing benefits of reducing mobile 
source air toxics. EPA continues to work 
to address these limitations; however, 
EPA does not anticipate having methods 
and tools available for national-scale 
application in time for the analysis of 
the final rules.398

Benefits of Reduced Oil Use, 2006–2015,’’ 
completed in March 2008, is an update version of 
the approach used for estimating the energy 
security benefits of U.S. oil import reductions 
developed in an ORNL 1997 Report by Leiby, Paul 
N., Donald W. Jones, T. Randall Curlee, and Russell 
Lee, entitled ‘‘Oil Imports: An Assessment of

estimate. 
8. Energy Security Impacts 
This proposal to reduce GHG 
emissions in light-duty vehicles results 
in improved fuel efficiency which, in 
turn, helps to reduce U.S. petroleum 
imports. A reduction of U.S. petroleum 
imports reduces both financial and 
strategic risks associated with a 
potential disruption in supply or a spike 
in cost of a particular energy source. 
This reduction in risk is a measure of 
improved U.S. energy security. This 
section summarizes our estimate of the 
monetary value of the energy security 
benefits of the proposed GHG vehicle 
standards against the reference case by 
estimating the impact of the expanded 
use of lower-GHG vehicle technologies 
on U.S. oil imports and avoided U.S. oil 
import expenditures. Additional 
discussion of this issue can be found in 
Chapter 5.1 of EPA’s RIA and Section 
4.2.8 of the TSD. 
a. Implications of Reduced Petroleum 
Use on U.S. Imports 
In 2008, U.S. petroleum import 
expenditures represented 21% of total 
U.S. imports of all goods and 
services.399 In 2008, the U.S. imported 
66% of the petroleum it consumed, and 
the transportation sector accounted for 
70% of total U.S. petroleum 
consumption. This compares to 
approximately 37% of petroleum from 
imports and 55% consumption of 
petroleum in the transportation sector in 
1975.400 It is clear that petroleum 
imports have a significant impact on the 
U.S. economy. Requiring lower-GHG 
vehicle technology in the U.S. is 
expected to lower U.S. petroleum 
imports. 
b. Energy Security Implications 
In order to understand the energy 
security implications of reducing U.S. 
petroleum imports, EPA has worked 
with Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
(ORNL), which has developed 
approaches for evaluating the economic 
costs and energy security implications 
of oil use. The energy security estimates 
provide below are based upon a 
methodology developed in a peer- 
reviewed study entitled, ‘‘The Energy 
Security Benefits of Reduced Oil Use, 
2006–2015,’’ completed in March 2008. 
This recent study is included as part of 
the docket for this rulemaking.401 402 
When conducting this recent analysis, 
ORNL considered the economic cost of 
importing petroleum into the U.S. The 
economic cost of importing petroleum 
into the U.S. is defined to include two 
components in addition to the purchase 
price of petroleum itself. These are: (1) 
The higher costs for oil imports 
resulting from the effect of increasing 
U.S. import demand on the world oil 
price and on OPEC market power (i.e., 
the ‘‘demand’’ or ‘‘monopsony’’ costs); 
and (2) the risk of reductions in U.S. 
economic output and disruption of the 
U.S. economy caused by sudden 
disruptions in the supply of imported 
petroleum to the U.S. (i.e., 
macroeconomic disruption/adjustment 
costs). Maintaining a U.S. military 
presence to help secure stable oil supply 
from potentially vulnerable regions of 
the world was not included in this 
analysis because its attribution to 
particular missions or activities is 
difficult. 
For this proposal, ORNL further 
updated the energy security premium by 
incorporating the most recent oil price 
forecast in the in the Energy Information 
Administration’s 2009 Annual Energy 
Outlook into its model. In order for the 
energy security premium estimated to 
be used in EPA’s OMEGA model, ORNL 
developed energy security estimates for 
a number of different years; please refer 
to Table III.H.8–1 for this information 
for years 2015, 2020, 2030 and 2040,403 
as well as a breakdown of the 
components of the energy security 
premium for each of these years. The 
components of the energy security 
premium and their values are discussed 
in detail in the TSD, Chapter 4.2.8.

The literature on the energy security 
for the last two decades has routinely 
combined the monopsony and the 
macroeconomic disruption components 
when calculating the total value of the 
energy security premium. However, in 
the context of using a global value for 
the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) the 
question arises: How should the energy 
security premium be used when some 
benefits from the proposed rule, such as 
the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, are calculated at a global 
level? Monopsony benefits represent 
avoided payments by the U.S. to oil 
producers in foreign countries that 
result from a decrease in the world oil 
price as the U.S. decreases its 
consumption of imported oil. Although 
there is clearly a benefit to the U.S. 
when considered from the domestic 
perspective, the decrease in price due to 
decreased demand in the U.S. also 
represents a loss of income to oil- 
producing countries. Given the 
redistributive nature of this effect, do 
the negative effects on other countries 
‘‘net out’’ the positive impacts to the 
U.S.? If this is the case, then, the 
monopsony portion of the energy 
security premium should be excluded 
from the net benefits calculation for the 
rule. 
Based on this reasoning, EPA’s 
estimates of net benefits for this 
proposal exclude the portion of energy

404 Estimated reductions in U.S. imports of 
finished petroleum products and crude oil are 95% 
of 88 million barrels (MMB) in 2015, 302 MMB in 
2020, 592 MMB in 2030, and 767 MMB in 2040. 
405 Preliminary Regulatory Impacts Analysis, 
April 2008. Based on a detailed analysis of 
differences in fuel consumption, petroleum 
imports, and imports of refined petroleum products 
among the Reference Case, High Economic Growth, 
and Low Economic Growth Scenarios presented in 
the Energy Information Administration’s Annual 
Energy Outlook 2007, NHTSA estimated that 
approximately 50 percent of the reduction in fuel 
consumption is likely to be reflected in reduced 
U.S. imports of refined fuel, while the remaining 50 
percent would be expected to be reflected in 
reduced domestic fuel refining. Of this latter figure, 
90 percent is anticipated to reduce U.S. imports of 
crude petroleum for use as a refinery feedstock, 
while the remaining 10 percent is expected to 
reduce U.S. domestic production of crude 
petroleum. Thus on balance, each gallon of fuel 
saved is anticipated to reduce total U.S. imports of 
crude petroleum or refined fuel by 0.95 gallons. 
security benefits stemming from the 
U.S. exercising its monopsony power in 
oil markets. Thus, EPA only includes 
the macroeconomic disruption/ 
adjustment cost portion of the energy 
security premium. 
EPA invites comments on whether, 
when the global value for greenhouse 
gas reduction benefits is used, it may 
still be appropriate to include the 
monopsony benefits in net benefits 
calculation for the proposed rule. From 
one perspective, the global SCC is used 
in these calculations, not because the 
global net benefits of the rule are being 
computed (they are not), but rather 
because in the context of a global public 
good, the global marginal benefit is the 
correct domestic benefit against which 
domestic costs are to be compared. 
Similarly, energy security is inherently 
a domestic benefit. Thus, should the 
two benefits, if they are both viewed 
from this domestic perspective, be 
counted in the net benefits estimates for 
this rulemaking and more generally 
what are the overall implications of this 
approach to justifying regulation? If the 
monopsony benefits were included in 
this case, they could be significant. 
Total annual energy security benefits 
are derived from the estimated 
reductions in U.S. imports of finished 
petroleum products and crude oil using 
only the macroeconomic disruption/ 
adjustment portion of the energy 
security premium. These values are 
shown in Table III.H.8–2.404 The 
reduced oil estimates were derived from 
the OMEGA model, as explained in 
Section VI of this preamble. EPA used 
the same assumption that NHTSA used 
in its Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
and CAFE Reform for MY 2008–2011 
Light Trucks proposal, which assumed 
each gallon of fuel saved reduces total 
U.S. imports of crude oil or refined 
products by 0.95 gallons.405

9. Other Impacts 
There are other impacts associated 
with the proposed CO2 emissions 
standards and associated reduced fuel 
consumption that vary with miles 
driven. Lower fuel consumption would, 
presumably, result in fewer trips to the 
filling station to refuel and, thus, time 
saved. The rebound effect, discussed in 
detail in Section III.H.4.c, produces 
additional benefits to vehicle owners in 
the form of consumer surplus from the 
increase in vehicle-miles driven, but 
may also increase the societal costs 
associated with traffic congestion, motor 
vehicle crashes, and noise. These effects 
are likely to be relatively small in 
comparison to the value of fuel saved as 
a result of the proposed standards, but 
they are nevertheless important to 
include. Table III.H.9–1 summarizes the 
other economic impacts. Please refer to 
Preamble Section II.F and the Draft Joint 
TSD that accompanies this proposal for 
more information about these impacts 
and how EPA and NHTSA use them in 
their analyses.

10. Summary of Costs and Benefits 
In this section EPA presents a 
summary of costs, benefits, and net 
benefits of the proposal. EPA presents 
fuel consumption impacts as negative 
costs of the vehicle program. 
Table III.H.10–1 shows the estimated 
annual societal costs of the vehicle 
program for the indicated calendar 
years. The table also shows the net 
present values of those costs for the 
calendar years 2012–2050 using both a 
3 percent and a seven percent discount 
rate. In this table, fuel savings are 
calculated using pre-tax fuel prices and 
are presented as negative costs 
associated with the vehicle program 
(rather than positive savings). 
Consumers are expected to receive the 
fuel savings presented here. The cost 
estimates for the fuel-saving technology 
are based on the assumptions that, to 
comply with the rule, no vehicle 
attributes will change except fuel 
economy and technology cost; that 
consumers will consider reduced fuel 
costs as a substitute for increased 
purchase price; and that consumers will 
not change the vehicles that they 
purchase. Instead, automakers are likely 
to redesign vehicles as part of their 
compliance strategies. If so, the 
redesigns may make the vehicles either 
less or more attractive to consumers. In

406 Radiative forcing is the change in the balance 
between solar radiation entering the atmosphere 
and the Earth’s radiation going out. On average, a 
positive radiative forcing tends to warm the surface 
of the Earth while negative forcing tends to cool the 
surface. Greenhouse gases have a positive radiative 
forcing because they absorb and emit heat. See 
http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/ 
recentac.html for more general information about 
GHGs and climate science. 
407 See IPCC WGII, 2007 for discussion about 
implications of different marginal impacts among 
the GHGs. 
addition, consumers may choose to 
purchase different vehicles than they 
would in the absence of this rule. These 
changes may affect the satisfaction that 
consumers receive from their vehicles. 
Because of the unsettled state of the 
modeling of consumer choices 
(discussed in Section III.H.1 and in 
DRIA Section 8.1.2), this analysis does 
not measure these effects. To the extent 
that consumer satisfaction with vehicles 
may decline due to changes in vehicles 
other than fuel economy, or that 
consumers may take some of these fuel 
savings into account when they 
purchase their vehicles, the fuel savings 
may overstate the benefits of improved 
fuel economy to consumers.

Table III.H.10–2 presents estimated 
annual societal benefits for the 
indicated calendar years. The table also 
shows the net present values of those 
benefits for the calendar years 2012– 
2050 using both a 3 percent and a 7 
percent discount rate. The table shows 
the benefits of reduced GHG 
emissions—and consequently the 
annual quantified benefits (i.e., total 
benefits)—for each of five interim SCC 
values considered by EPA. As discussed 
in Section III.H.6, there is a very high 
probability (very likely according to the 
IPCC) that the benefit estimates from 
GHG reductions are underestimates. 
One of the primary reasons is that 
models used to calculate SCC values do 
not include information about impacts 
that have not been quantified. 
In addition, the total GHG reduction 
benefits presented below likely 
underestimate the value of GHG 
reductions because they were calculated 
using the marginal values for CO2 
emissions. The impacts of non-CO2 
emissions vary from those of CO2 
emissions because of differences in 
atmospheric lifetimes and radiative 
forcing.406 As a result, the marginal 
benefit values of non-CO2 GHG 
reductions and their growth rates over 
time will not be the same as the 
marginal benefits measured on a CO2- 
equivalent scale.407 Marginal benefit 
estimates per metric ton of non-CO2 
GHGs are currently unavailable, but 
work is on-going to monetize benefits 
related to the mitigation of other non- 
CO2 GHGs.

a Note that the co-pollutant impacts associated with the standards presented here do not include the full complement of endpoints that, if quan-
tified and monetized, would change the total monetized estimate of rule-related impacts. Instead, the co-pollutant benefits are based on benefit- 
per-ton values that reflect only human health impacts associated with reductions in PM2.5 exposure. Ideally, human health and environmental 
benefits would be based on changes in ambient PM2.5 and ozone as determined by full-scale air quality modeling. However, EPA was unable to 
conduct a full-scale air quality modeling analysis in time for the proposal. We intend to more fully capture the co-pollutant benefits for the anal-
ysis of the final standards.

b The PM2.5-related benefits (derived from benefit-per-ton values) presented in this table are based on an estimate of premature mortality de-
rived from the ACS study (Pope et al., 2002). If the benefit-per-ton estimates were based on the Six Cities study (Laden et al., 2006), the values 
would be approximately 145% (nearly two-and-a-half times) larger. 
c The PM2.5-related benefits (derived from benefit-per-ton values) presented in this table assume a 3% discount rate in the valuation of pre-
mature mortality to account for a twenty-year segmented cessation lag. If a 7% discount rate had been used, the values would be approximately 
9% lower.

b Fuel impacts were calculated using pre-tax fuel prices. 
EPA also conducted a separate 
analysis of the total benefits over the 
model year lifetimes of the 2012 through 
2016 model year vehicles. In contrast to 
the calendar year analysis, the model 
year lifetime analysis shows the lifetime 
impacts of the program on each of these 
MY fleets over the course of its lifetime. 
Full details of the inputs to this analysis 
can be found in DRIA Chapter 5. The 
societal benefits of the full life of each 
of the five model years from 2012 
through 2016 are shown in Tables 
III.H.10–4 and III.H.10–5 at both a 3 
percent and a 7 percent discount rate, 
respectively. The net benefits are shown 
in Tables III.H.10–6 and III.H.10–7 for 
both a 3 percent and a 7 percent 
discount rate. Note that the quantified 
annual benefits shown in Table 
III.H.10–4 and Table III.H.10–5 include 
fuel savings as a positive benefit. As 
such, the quantified annual costs as 
shown in Table III.H.10–6 and Table 
III.H.10–7 do not include fuel savings 
since those are included as benefits. 
Also note that each of the Tables 
III.H.10–4 through Table III.H.10–7 
include the benefits of reduced CO2 
emissions—and consequently the total 
benefits—for each of five interim SCC 
values considered by EPA. As noted

(very likely according to the IPCC) that 
the benefit estimates from GHG 
reductions are underestimates because,

a Note that the co-pollutant impacts associated with the standards presented here do not include the full complement of endpoints that, if quan-
tified and monetized, would change the total monetized estimate of rule-related impacts. Instead, the co-pollutant benefits are based on benefit- 
per-ton values that reflect only human health impacts associated with reductions in PM2.5 exposure. Ideally, human health and environmental 
benefits would be based on changes in ambient PM2.5 and ozone as determined by full-scale air quality modeling. However, EPA was unable to 
conduct a full-scale air quality modeling analysis in time for the proposal. We intend to more fully capture the co-pollutant benefits for the anal-
ysis of the final standards. 
b The PM2.5-related benefits (derived from benefit-per-ton values) presented in this table are based on an estimate of premature mortality de-
rived from the ACS study (Pope et al., 2002). If the benefit-per-ton estimates were based on the Six Cities study (Laden et al., 2006), the values 
would be approximately 145% (nearly two-and-a-half times) larger. 
c The PM2.5-related benefits (derived from benefit-per-ton values) presented in this table assume a 3% discount rate in the valuation of pre-
mature mortality to account for a twenty-year segmented cessation lag. If a 7% discount rate had been used, the values would be approximately 
9% lower.

49628 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
I. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
1. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review 
Under section 3(f)(1) of Executive 
Order (EO) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 
4, 1993), this action is an ‘‘economically 
significant regulatory action’’ because it 
is likely to have an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more. 
Accordingly, EPA submitted this action 
to the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for review under EO 12866 and 
any changes made in response to OMB 
recommendations have been 
documented in the docket for this 
action. 
In addition, EPA prepared an analysis 
of the potential costs and benefits 
associated with this action. This 
analysis is contained in the Draft 
Regulatory Impact Analysis, which is 
available in the docket for this 
rulemaking and at the docket Internet 
address listed under ADDRESSES above. 
2. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The information collection 
requirements in this proposed rule have 
been submitted for approval to the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The 
Information Collection Request (ICR) 
document prepared by EPA has been 
assigned EPA ICR number 0783.56. 
The Agency proposes to collect 
information to ensure compliance with 
the provisions in this rule. This 
includes a variety of requirements for 
vehicle manufacturers. Section 208(a) of 
the Clean Air Act requires that vehicle 
manufacturers provide information the 
Administrator may reasonably require to 
determine compliance with the 
regulations; submission of the 
information is therefore mandatory. We 
will consider confidential all 
information meeting the requirements of 
section 208(c) of the Clean Air Act. 
As shown in Table III.J.2–1, the total 
annual burden associated with this 
proposal is about 39,900 hours and $5 
million, based on a projection of 33 
respondents. The estimated burden for 
vehicle manufacturers is a total estimate 
for both new and existing reporting 
requirements. Burden means the total 
time, effort, or financial resources 
expended by persons to generate, 
maintain, retain, or disclose or provide 
information to or for a Federal agency. 
This includes the time needed to review 
instructions; develop, acquire, install, 
and utilize technology and systems for 
the purposes of collecting, validating, 
and verifying information, processing 
and maintaining information, and 
disclosing and providing information; 
adjust the existing ways to comply with 
any previously applicable instructions 
and requirements; train personnel to be 
able to respond to a collection of 
information; search data sources; 
complete and review the collection of 
information; and transmit or otherwise 
disclose the information. 
TABLE III.J.2–1 ESTIMATED BURDEN FOR REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS 
Number of respondents Annual burden hours Annual costs 
33 ............................................................................................................................................................................. 39,940 $5,001,000 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. The OMB control 
numbers for EPA’s regulations in 40 
CFR are listed in 40 CFR part 9. 
To comment on the Agency’s need for 
this information, the accuracy of the 
provided burden estimates, and any 
suggested methods for minimizing 
respondent burden, including the use of 
automated collection techniques, EPA 
has established a public docket for this 
rule, which includes this ICR, under 
Docket ID number EPA–HQ–OAR– 
2007–0491. Submit any comments 
related to the ICR for this proposed rule 
to EPA and OMB. See ADDRESSES 
section at the beginning of this notice 
for where to submit comments to EPA. 
Send comments to OMB at the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget, 725 
17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20503, Attention: Desk Office for EPA. 
Since OMB is required to make a 
decision concerning the ICR between 30 
and 60 days after September 28, 2009, 
a comment to OMB is best assured of 
having its full effect if OMB receives it 
by October 28, 2009. The final rule will 
respond to any OMB or public 
comments on the information collection 
requirements contained in this proposal. 
3. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
a. Overview 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
generally requires an agency to prepare 
a regulatory flexibility analysis of any 
rule subject to notice and comment 
rulemaking requirements under the 
Administrative Procedure Act or any 
other statute unless the agency certifies 
that the rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. Small entities 
include small businesses, small 
organizations, and small governmental 
jurisdictions. 
For purposes of assessing the impacts 
of this rule on small entities, small 
entity is defined as: (1) A small business 
as defined by the Small Business 
Administration’s (SBA) regulations at 13 
CFR 121.201 (see table below); (2) a 
small governmental jurisdiction that is a 
government of a city, county, town, 
school district or special district with a 
population of less than 50,000; and (3) 
a small organization that is any not-for- 
profit enterprise which is independently 
owned and operated and is not 
dominant in its field. 
Table III.J.3–1 provides an overview 
of the primary SBA small business 
categories included in the light-duty 
vehicle sector:

b North American Industrial Classification System. 
b. Summary of Potentially Affected 
Small Entities 
EPA has not conducted a Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis or a SBREFA SBAR 
Panel for the proposed rule because we 
are proposing to certify that the rule 
would not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. EPA is proposing to defer 
standards for manufacturers meeting 
SBA’s definition of small business as 
described in 13 CFR 121.201 due to the 
short lead time to develop this proposed 
rule, the extremely small emissions 
contribution of these entities, and the 
potential need to develop a program that 
would be structured differently for them 
(which would require more time). EPA 
would instead consider appropriate 
GHG standards for these entities as part 
of a future regulatory action. This 
includes small entities in three distinct 
categories of businesses for light-duty 
vehicles: Small volume manufacturers 
(SVMs), independent commercial 
importers (ICIs), and alternative fuel 
vehicle converters. Based on 
preliminary assessment, EPA has 
identified a total of about 47 vehicle 
businesses, about 13 entities (or 28 
percent) that fit the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) criterion of a 
small business. There are about 2 SVMs, 
8 ICIs, and 3 alternative fuel vehicle 
converters in the light-duty vehicle 
market which are small businesses (no 
major vehicle manufacturers meet the 
small-entity criteria as defined by SBA). 
EPA estimates that these small entities 
comprise about 0.03 percent of the total 
light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S. for 
the year 2007, and therefore the 
proposed deferment will have a 
negligible impact on the GHG emissions 
reductions from the proposed standards. 
To ensure that EPA is aware of which 
companies would be deferred, EPA is 
proposing that such entities submit a 
declaration to EPA containing a detailed 
written description of how that 
manufacturer qualifies as a small entity 
under the provisions of 13 CFR 121.201. 
Small entities are currently covered by 
a number of EPA motor vehicle 
emission regulations, and they routinely 
submit information and data on an 
annual basis as part of their compliance 
responsibilities. Because such entities 
are not automatically exempted from 
other EPA regulations for light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks, absent 
such a declaration, EPA would assume 
that the entity was subject to the 
greenhouse gas control requirements in 
this GHG proposal. The declaration 
would need to be submitted at time of 
vehicle emissions certification under 
the EPA Tier 2 program. EPA expects 
that the additional paperwork burden 
associated with completing and 
submitting a small entity declaration to 
gain deferral from the proposed GHG 
standards would be negligible and 
easily done in the context of other 
routine submittals to EPA. However, 
EPA has accounted for this cost with a 
nominal estimate included in the 
Information Collection Request 
completed under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. Additional information 
can be found in the Paperwork 
Reduction Act discussion in Section 
III.I.2. Based on this, EPA is proposing 
to certify that the rule would not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
c. Conclusions 
I therefore certify that this proposed 
rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. However, EPA 
recognizes that some small entities 
continue to be concerned about the 
potential impacts of the statutory 
imposition of PSD requirements that 
may occur given the various EPA 
rulemakings currently under 
consideration concerning greenhouse 
gas emissions. As explained in the 
preamble for the proposed PSD tailoring 
rule, EPA is using the discretion 
afforded to it under section 609(c) of the 
RFA to consult with OMB and SBA, 
with input from outreach to small 
entities, regarding the potential impacts 
of PSD regulatory requirements as that 
might occur as EPA considers 
regulations of GHGs. Concerns about the 
potential impacts of statutorily imposed 
PSD requirements on small entities will 
be the subject of deliberations in that 
consultation and outreach. Concerned 
small entities should direct any 
comments relating to potential adverse 
economic impacts on small entities from 
PSD requirements for GHG emissions to 
the docket for the PSD tailoring rule. 
EPA continues to be interested in the 
potential impacts of the proposed rule 
on small entities and welcomes 
comments on issues related to such 
impacts.

Law 104–4, establishes requirements for 
Federal agencies to assess the effects of 
their regulatory actions on State, local, 
and tribal governments and the private 
sector. Under section 202 of the UMRA, 
EPA generally must prepare a written 
statement, including a cost-benefit 
analysis, for proposed and final rules 
with ‘‘Federal mandates’’ that may 
result in expenditures to State, local,

and tribal governments, in the aggregate, 
or to the private sector, of $100 million 
or more in any one year. Before 
promulgating an EPA rule for which a 
written statement is needed, section 205 
of the UMRA generally requires EPA to 
identify and consider a reasonable 
number of regulatory alternatives and 
adopt the least costly, most cost- 
effective or least burdensome alternative 
that achieves the objectives of the rule. 
The provisions of section 205 do not 
apply when they are inconsistent with 
applicable law. Moreover, section 205 
allows EPA to adopt an alternative other 
than the least costly, most cost-effective 
or least burdensome alternative if the 
Administrator publishes with the final 
rule an explanation why that alternative 
was not adopted. 
Before EPA establishes any regulatory 
requirements that may significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, 
including tribal governments, it must 
have developed under section 203 of the 
UMRA a small government agency plan. 
The plan must provide for notifying 
potentially affected small governments, 
enabling officials of affected small 
governments to have meaningful and 
timely input in the development of EPA 
regulatory proposals with significant 
Federal intergovernmental mandates, 
and informing, educating, and advising 
small governments on compliance with 
the regulatory requirements. 
This proposal contains no Federal 
mandates (under the regulatory 
provisions of Title II of the UMRA) for 
State, local, or tribal governments. The 
rule imposes no enforceable duty on any 
State, local or tribal governments. EPA 
has determined that this rule contains 
no regulatory requirements that might 
significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. EPA has determined that 
this proposal contains a Federal 
mandate that may result in expenditures 
of $100 million or more for the private 
sector in any one year. EPA believes that 
the proposal represents the least costly, 
most cost-effective approach to achieve 
the statutory requirements of the rule. 
The costs and benefits associated with 
the proposal are discussed above and in 
the Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis, as 
required by the UMRA. 
5. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
This action does not have federalism 
implications. It will not have substantial 
direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government, as specified in 
Executive Order 13132. This rulemaking 
would apply to manufacturers of motor 
vehicles and not to State or local 
governments. Thus, Executive Order 
13132 does not apply to this action. 
Although section 6 of Executive Order 
13132 does not apply to this action, EPA 
did consult with representatives of State 
governments in developing this action. 
In the spirit of Executive Order 13132, 
and consistent with EPA policy to 
promote communications between EPA 
and State and local governments, EPA 
specifically solicits comment on this 
proposed action from State and local 
officials. 
6. Executive Order 13175 (Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments) 
This proposed rule does not have 
tribal implications, as specified in 
Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, 
November 9, 2000). This rule will be 
implemented at the Federal level and 
impose compliance costs only on 
vehicle manufacturers. Tribal 
governments would be affected only to 
the extent they purchase and use 
regulated vehicles. Thus, Executive 
Order 13175 does not apply to this rule. 
EPA specifically solicits additional 
comment on this proposed rule from 
tribal officials. 
7. Executive Order 13045: ‘‘Protection of 
Children From Environmental Health 
Risks and Safety Risks’’ 
This action is subject to EO 13045 (62 
FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it is 
an economically significant regulatory 
action as defined by EO 12866, and EPA 
believes that the environmental health 
or safety risk addressed by this action 
may have a disproportionate effect on 
children. A synthesis of the science and 
research regarding how climate change 
may affect children and other 
vulnerable subpopulations is contained 
in the Technical Support Document for 
Endangerment or Cause or Contribute 
Findings for Greenhouse Gases under 
Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 
which can be found in the public docket 
for this proposed rule.408 A summary of 
the analysis is presented below. 
With respect to GHG emissions, the 
effects of climate change observed to 
date and projected to occur in the future 
include the increased likelihood of more 
frequent and intense heat waves. 
Specifically, EPA’s analysis has 
determined that severe heat waves are 
projected to intensify in magnitude, 
frequency, and duration over the 
portions of the U.S. where these events 
already occur, with potential increases 
in mortality and morbidity, especially 
among the young, elderly, and frail. EPA 
has estimated reductions in projected 
global mean surface temperatures as a 
result of reductions in GHG emissions 
associated with the standards proposed 
in this action (Section III.F). Children 
may receive benefits from reductions in 
GHG emissions because they are 
included in the segment of the 
population that is most vulnerable to 
hot temperatures. 
For non-GHG pollutants, EPA has 
determined that climate change is 
expected to increase regional ozone 
pollution, with associated risks in 
respiratory infection, aggravation of 
asthma, and premature death. The 
directional effect of climate change on 
ambient PM levels remains uncertain. 
However, disturbances such as wildfires 
are increasing in the U.S. and are likely 
to intensify in a warmer future with 
drier soils and longer growing seasons. 
PM emissions from forest fires can 
contribute to acute and chronic illnesses 
of the respiratory system, particularly in 
children, including pneumonia, upper 
respiratory diseases, asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary diseases. 
The public is invited to submit 
comments or identify peer-reviewed 
studies and data that assess effects of 
early life exposure to the pollutants 
addressed by this proposed rule. 
8. Executive Order 13211 (Energy 
Effects) 
This rule is not a ‘‘significant energy 
action’’ as defined in Executive Order 
13211, ‘‘Actions Concerning Regulations 
That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use’’ (66 FR 28355 (May 
22, 2001)) because it is not likely to 
have a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy. In 
fact, this rule has a positive effect on 
energy supply and use. Because the 
GHG emission standards proposed 
today result in significant fuel savings, 
this rule encourages more efficient use 
of fuels. Therefore, we have concluded 
that this rule is not likely to have any 
adverse energy effects. Our energy 
effects analysis is described above in 
Section III.H. 
9. National Technology Transfer 
Advancement Act 
Section 12(d) of the National 
Technology Transfer and Advancement 
Act of 1995 (‘‘NTTAA’’), Public Law 
104–113, 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note)

standards in its regulatory activities

impractical. Voluntary consensus 
standards are technical standards (e.g., 
materials, specifications, test methods, 
sampling procedures, and business 
practices) that are developed or adopted 
by voluntary consensus standards 
bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide 
Congress, through OMB, explanations 
when the Agency decides not to use 
available and applicable voluntary 
consensus standards. 
For CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions, 
EPA is proposing to collect data over the 
same tests that are used for the CAFE 
program. This will minimize the 
amount of testing done by 
manufacturers, since manufacturers are 
already required to run these tests. For 
A/C credits, EPA is proposing to use a 
consensus methodology developed by 
the Society of Automotive Engineers 
(SAE) and also a new A/C idle test. EPA 
knows of no consensus standard 
available for the A/C idle test. 
10. Executive Order 12898: Federal 
Actions To Address Environmental 
Justice in Minority Populations and 
Low-Income Populations 
Executive Order (EO) 12898 (59 FR 
7629 (Feb. 16, 1994)) establishes Federal 
executive policy on environmental 
justice. Its main provision directs 
Federal agencies, to the greatest extent 
practicable and permitted by law, to 
make environmental justice part of their 
mission by identifying and addressing, 
as appropriate, disproportionately high 
and adverse human health or 
environmental effects of their programs, 
policies, and activities on minority 
populations and low-income 
populations in the United States. 
With respect to GHG emissions, EPA 
has determined that this proposed rule 
will not have disproportionately high 
and adverse human health or 
environmental effects on minority or 
low-income populations because it 
increases the level of environmental 
protection for all affected populations 
without having any disproportionately 
high and adverse human health or 
environmental effects on any 
population, including any minority or 
low-income population. The reductions 
in CO2 and other GHGs associated with 
the proposed standards will affect 
climate change projections, and EPA has 
estimated reductions in projected global 
mean surface temperatures (Section 
III.F.3). Within settlements experiencing 
climate change, certain parts of the 
population may be especially 
vulnerable; these include the poor, the 
elderly, those already in poor health, the 
disabled, those living alone, and/or 
indigenous populations dependent on 
one or a few resources. 409 Therefore, 
these populations may receive benefits 
from reductions in GHGs. 
For non-GHG co-pollutants such as 
ozone, PM2.5, and toxics, EPA has 
concluded that it is not practicable to 
determine whether there would be 
disproportionately high and adverse 
human health or environmental effects 
on minority and/or low income 
populations from this proposed rule. 
J. Statutory Provisions and Legal 
Authority 
Statutory authority for the vehicle 
controls proposed today is found in 
section 202 (a) (which authorizes 
standards for emissions of pollutants 
from new motor vehicles which 
emissions cause or contribute to air 
pollution which may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger public health or 
welfare), 202 (d), 203–209, 216, and 301

IV. NHTSA Proposal for Passenger Car 
and Light Truck CAFE Standards for 
MYs 2012–2016 
A. Executive Overview of NHTSA 
Proposal 
1. Introduction 
The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) is proposing 
to establish corporate average fuel 
economy standards for passenger 
automobiles (passenger cars) and 
nonpassenger automobiles (light trucks) 
for model years (MY) 2012–2016. 
Improving vehicle fuel economy has 
been long and widely recognized as one 
of the key ways of achieving energy 
independence, energy security, and a 
low carbon economy.410 NHTSA’s 
proposed standards will require 
passenger cars and light trucks to meet 
an estimated combined average of 34.1 
mpg in MY 2016. This represents an 
average annual increase of 4.3 percent 
from the 27.3 mpg combined fuel 
economy level in MY 2011. NHTSA’s 
proposal projects total fuel savings of 
approximately 61.6 billion gallons over 
the lifetimes of the vehicles sold in 
model years 2012–2016, with 
corresponding net societal benefits of 
approximately $201.7 billion. 
The significance accorded improving 
fuel economy reflects several factors. 
Conserving energy, especially reducing 
the nation’s dependence on petroleum, 
benefits the U.S. in several ways. 
Improving energy efficiency has benefits 
for economic growth and the 
environment, as well as other benefits, 
such as reducing pollution and 
improving security of energy supply. 
More specifically, reducing total 
petroleum use decreases our economy’s 
vulnerability to oil price shocks. 
Reducing dependence on oil imports 
from regions with uncertain conditions 
enhances our energy security. 
Additionally, the emission of CO2 from 
the tailpipes of cars and light trucks is 
one of the largest sources of U.S. CO2 
emissions.411 Using vehicle technology 
to improve fuel economy, and thereby 
reducing tailpipe emissions of CO2, is 
one of the three main measures of 
reducing those tailpipe emissions of 
CO2.412 The two other measures for

reducing the tailpipe emissions of CO2 
are switching to vehicle fuels with 
lower carbon content and changing 
driver behavior, i.e., inducing people to 
drive less. 
While NHTSA has been setting fuel 
economy standards since the 1970s, 
today’s action represents the first-ever 
joint proposal by NHTSA with another 
agency, the Environmental Protection 
Agency. As discussed in Section I, 
NHTSA’s proposed MYs 2012–2016 
CAFE standards are part of a joint 
National Program, such that a large 
majority of the projected benefits are 
achieved jointly with EPA’s GHG rule, 
described in detail above in Section III 
of this preamble. These proposed CAFE 
standards are consistent with the 
President’s National Fuel Efficiency 
Policy announcement of May 19, 2009, 
which calls for harmonized rules for all 
automakers, instead of three 
overlapping and potentially inconsistent 
requirements from DOT, EPA, and the 
California Air Resources Board. And 
finally, the proposed CAFE standards 
and the analysis supporting them also 
respond to President’s Obama’s January 
26 memorandum regarding the setting of 
CAFE standards for model years 2011 
and beyond. 
2. Role of Fuel Economy Improvements 
in Promoting Energy Independence, 
Energy Security, and a Low Carbon 
Economy 
The need to reduce energy 
consumption is more crucial today than 
it was when EPCA was enacted in the 
mid-1970s. U.S. energy consumption 
has been outstripping U.S. energy 
production at an increasing rate. Net 
petroleum imports now account for 
approximately 57 percent of U.S. 
domestic petroleum consumption, and 
the share of U.S. oil consumption for 
transportation is approximately 71 
percent.413 Moreover, world crude oil 
production continues to be highly 
concentrated, exacerbating the risks of 
supply disruptions and their negative 
effects on both the U.S. and global 
economies. 
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. has 
historically been relatively insensitive 
to fluctuations in both price and 
consumer income, and people in most 
parts of the country tend to view 
gasoline consumption as a non- 
discretionary expense. Thus, when 
gasoline’s share in consumer 
expenditures rises, the public 
experiences fiscal distress. This fiscal 
distress can, in some cases, have 
macroeconomic consequences for the 
economy at large. Additionally, since 
U.S. oil production is only affected by 
fluctuations in prices over a period of 
years, any changes in petroleum 
consumption (as through increased fuel 
economy) largely flow into changes in 
the quantity of imports. Although 
petroleum imports only account for 
about 2 percent of GDP, they are large 
enough to create a discernible fiscal 
drag. As a consequence, however, 
measures that reduce petroleum 
consumption, such as fuel economy 
standards, will flow directly into the 
balance-of-payments account, and 
strengthen the domestic economy to 
some degree. And finally, U.S. foreign 
policy has been affected for decades by 
rising U.S. and world dependency of 
crude oil as the basis for modern 
transportation systems, although fuel 
economy standards have only an 
indirect and general impact on U.S. 
foreign policy. 
The benefits of a low carbon economy 
are manifold. The U.S. transportation 
sector is a significant contributor to total 
U.S. and global anthropogenic 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Motor 
vehicles are the second largest 
greenhouse gas-emitting sector in the 
U.S., after electricity generation, and 
accounted for 24 percent of total U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2006. 
Concentrations of greenhouse gases are 
at unprecedented levels compared to the 
recent and distant past, which means 
that fuel economy improvements to 
reduce those emissions are a crucial 
step toward addressing the risks of 
global climate change. These risks are 
well documented in section III of this 
notice. 
3. The National Program 
NHTSA and EPA are each announcing 
proposed rules that have the effect of 
addressing the urgent and closely 
intertwined challenges of energy 
independence and security and global 
warming. These proposed rules call for 
a strong and coordinated Federal 
greenhouse gas and fuel economy 
program for passenger cars, light-duty- 
trucks, and medium-duty passenger 
vehicles (hereafter light-duty vehicles), 
referred to as the National Program. The 
proposed rules represent a coordinated 
program that can achieve substantial 
reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and improvements in fuel 
economy from the light-duty vehicle 
part of the transportation sector, based 
on technology that will be commercially 
available and that can be incorporated at 
a reasonable cost. The agencies’ 
proposals will also provide regulatory 
certainty and consistency for the 
automobile industry by setting 
harmonized national standards. They 
were developed and are designed in 
ways that recognize and accommodate 
the serious current economic situation 
faced by this industry. 
This joint notice is consistent with the 
President’s announcement on May 19, 
2009 of a National Fuel Efficiency 
Policy that will reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and improve fuel economy 
for all new cars and light-duty trucks 
sold in the United States,414 and with 
the Notice of Upcoming Joint 
Rulemaking signed by DOT and EPA on 
that date.415 This joint notice also 
responds to the President’s January 26, 
2009 memorandum on CAFE standards 
for model years 2011 and beyond, the 
details of which can be found in Section 
IV of this joint notice. 
a. Building Blocks of the National 
Program 
The National Program is both needed 
and possible because the relationship 
between improving fuel economy and 
reducing CO2 tailpipe emissions is a 
very direct and close one. CO2 is the 
natural by-product of the combustion of 
fuel in motor vehicle engines. The more 
fuel efficient a vehicle is, the less fuel 
it burns to travel a given distance. The 
less fuel it burns, the less CO2 it emits 
in traveling that distance.416 Since the 
amount of CO2 emissions is essentially 
constant per gallon combusted of a 
given type of fuel, the amount of fuel 
consumption per mile is directly related 
to the amount of CO2 emissions per 
mile. In the real world, there is a single 
pool of technologies for reducing fuel 
consumption and CO2 emissions. Using 
those technologies in the way that 
minimizes fuel consumption also 
minimizes CO2 emissions. While there 
are emission control technologies that 
can capture or destroy the pollutants 
(e.g., carbon monoxide) that are 
produced by imperfect combustion of 
fuel, there is at present no such 
technology for CO2. In fact, the only way 
at present to reduce tailpipe emissions 
of CO2 is by reducing fuel consumption. 
The National Program thus has dual 
benefits: It conserves energy by 
improving fuel economy, as required of 
NHTSA by EPCA and EISA; in the 
process, it necessarily reduces tailpipe

i. DOT’s CAFE Program 
In 1975, Congress enacted the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), 
mandating a regulatory program for 
motor vehicle fuel economy to meet the 
various facets of the need to conserve 
energy, including ones having energy 
independence and security, 
environmental and foreign policy 
implications. EPCA allocates the 
responsibility for implementing the 
program between NHTSA and EPA as 
follows: 
• NHTSA sets Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for 
passenger cars and light trucks. 
• Because fuel economy performance 
is measured during emissions regulation 
testing, EPA establishes the procedures 
for testing, tests vehicles, collects and 
analyzes manufacturers’ test data, and 
calculates the average fuel economy of 
each manufacturer’s passenger cars and 
light trucks. EPA determines fuel 
economy by the simple expedient of 
measuring the amount of CO2 emitted 
from the tailpipe, not by attempting to 
measure directly the amount of fuel 
consumed during a vehicle test, a 
difficult task to accomplish with 
precision. EPA then uses the carbon 
content of the test fuel417 to calculate 
the amount of fuel that had to be 
consumed per mile in order to produce 
that amount of CO2. Finally, EPA 
converts that fuel consumption figure 
into a miles-per-gallon figure. 
• Based on EPA’s calculation, 
NHTSA enforces the CAFE standards. 
The CAFE standards and compliance 
testing cannot capture all of the real 
world CO2 emissions, because EPCA 
requires EPA to use the 1975 passenger 
car test procedures under which vehicle 
air conditioners are not turned on 
during fuel economy testing.418 CAFE 
standards also do not address the 5–8 
percent of GHG emissions that are not 
CO2, i.e., nitrous oxide (N2O), and 
methane (CH4) as well as emissions of 
CO2 and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
related to operation of the air 
conditioning system. 
NHTSA has been setting CAFE 
standards pursuant to EPCA since the 
enactment of the statute. Fuel economy 
gains since 1975, due both to the 
standards and market factors, have 
resulted in saving billions of barrels of 
oil and avoiding billions of metric tons 
of CO2 emissions. In December 2007, 
Congress enacted the Energy 
Independence and Securities Act 
(EISA), amending EPCA to require, 
among other things, attribute-based 
standards for passenger cars and light 
trucks. The most recent CAFE 
rulemaking action was the issuance of 
standards governing model years 2011 
cars and trucks. 
ii. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Program 
On April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme 
Court issued its opinion in 
Massachusetts v. EPA,419 a case 
involving a 2003 order of the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
denying a petition for rulemaking to 
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from 
motor vehicles under the Clean Air 
Act.420 The Court ruled that greenhouse 
gases are ‘‘pollutants’’ under the CAA 
and that the Act therefore authorizes 
EPA to regulate greenhouse gas 
emissions from motor vehicles if that 
agency makes the necessary findings 
and determinations under section 202 of 
the Act. The Court considered EPCA 
only briefly, stating that the two 
obligations may overlap, but there is no 
reason to think the two agencies cannot 
both administer their obligations and 
yet avoid inconsistency. 
EPA has been working on appropriate 
responses that are consistent with the 
decision of the Supreme Court in 
Massachusetts v. EPA.421 As part of 
those responses, in July 2008, EPA 
issued an Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking seeking comments on the 
impact of greenhouse gases on the 
environment and on ways to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from motor 
vehicles. EPA recently also proposed to 
find that emissions of GHGs from new 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
engines cause or contribute to air 
pollution that may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger public health 
and welfare.422 
iii. California Air Resources Board’s 
Greenhouse Gas Program 
In 2004, the California Air Resources 
Board approved standards for new light- 
duty vehicles, which regulate the 
emission of not only CO2, but also other 
GHGs. Since then, thirteen States and 
the District of Columbia, comprising 
approximately 40 percent of the light- 
duty vehicle market, have adopted 
California’s standards. These standards 
apply to model years 2009 through 2016 
and require reductions in CO2 
emissions for passenger cars and some 
light trucks of 323 g/mil in 2009 up to 
205 g/mi in 2016, and 439 g/mi for light 
trucks in 2009 up to 332 g/mi in 2016. 
In 2008, EPA denied a request by 
California for a waiver of preemption 
under the CAA for its GHG emissions 
standards. However, consistent with 
another Presidential Memorandum of 
January 26, 2009, EPA reconsidered the 
prior denial of California’s request.423 
EPA withdrew the prior denial and 
granted California’s request for a waiver 
on June 30, 2009.424 The granting of the 
waiver permits California’s emission 
standards to come into effect 
notwithstanding the general preemption 
of State emission standards for new 
motor vehicles that otherwise applies 
under the Clean Air Act. 
b. The President’s Announcement of 
National Fuel Efficiency Policy (May 
2009) 
The issue of three separate regulatory 
frameworks and overlapping 
requirements for reducing fuel 
consumption and CO2 emissions has 
been a subject of much controversy and 
legal disputes. On May 19, 2009 
President Obama announced a National 
Fuel Efficiency Policy aimed at both 
increasing fuel economy and reducing 
greenhouse gas pollution for all new 
cars and trucks sold in the United 
States, while also providing a 
predictable regulatory framework for the 
automotive industry. The policy seeks 
to set harmonized Federal standards to 
regulate both fuel economy and 
greenhouse gas emissions while 
preserving the legal authorities of the 
Department of Transportation, the 
Environmental Protection Agency and 
the State of California. The program 
covers model year 2012 to model year 
2016 and ultimately requires the 
equivalent of an average fuel economy 
of 35.5 mpg in 2016, if all CO2 reduction 
were achieved through fuel economy 
improvements. Building on the MY 
2011 standard that was set in March 
2009, this represents an average of 5 
percent increase in average fuel 
economy each year between 2012 and 
2016. 
In conjunction with the President’s 
announcement, the Department of 
Transportation and the Environmental 
Protection Agency issued on May 19, 
2009, a Notice of Upcoming Joint

427 Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration does not have an Administrator. 
Ronald L. Medford is the Acting Deputy 
Administrator. 
428 Under 49 U.S.C. 32904(c), EPA must use the 
same procedures for passenger automobiles that the 
Administrator used for model year 1975 (weighted 
55 percent urban cycle and 45 percent highway 
cycle), or procedures that give comparable results. 
Rulemaking to propose a strong and 
coordinated fuel economy and 
greenhouse gas National Program for 
Model Year (MY) 2012–2016 light duty 
vehicles. Consistent, harmonized, and 
streamlined requirements under that 
program hold out the promise of 
delivering environmental and energy 
benefits, cost savings, and 
administrative efficiencies on a 
nationwide basis that might not be 
available under a less coordinated 
approach. The proposed National 
Program makes it possible for the 
standards of two different Federal 
agencies and the standards of California 
and other States to act in a unified 
fashion in providing these benefits. 
Establishing a harmonized approach to 
regulating light-duty vehicle greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy 
is critically important given the 
interdependent goals of addressing 
climate change and ensuring energy 
independence and security. 
Additionally, establishing a harmonized 
approach may help to mitigate the cost 
to manufacturers of having to comply 
with multiple sets of Federal and State 
standards 
4. Review of CAFE Standard Setting 
Methodology per the President’s January 
26, 2009 Memorandum on CAFE 
Standards for MYs 2011 and Beyond 
On May 2, 2008, NHTSA published a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled 
Average Fuel Economy Standards, 
Passenger Cars and Light Trucks; Model 
Years 2011–2015, 73 Fed. Reg. 24352. In 
mid-October, the agency completed and 
released a final environmental impact 
statement in anticipation of issuing 
standards for those years. Based on its 
consideration of the public comments 
and other available information, 
including information on the financial 
condition of the automotive industry, 
the agency adjusted its analysis and the 
standards and prepared a final rule for 
MYs 2011–2015. On November 14, the 
Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of 
Management and Budget concluded 
review of the rule as consistent with the 
Order.425 However, issuance of the final 
rule was held in abeyance. On January 
7, 2009, the Department of 
Transportation announced that the final 
rule would not be issued, saying: 
The Bush Administration will not 
finalize its rulemaking on Corporate 
Fuel Economy Standards. The recent 
financial difficulties of the automobile 
industry will require the next 
administration to conduct a thorough 
review of matters affecting the industry, 
including how to effectively implement 
the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007 (EISA). The National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
has done significant work that will 
position the next Transportation 
Secretary to finalize a rule before the 
April 1, 2009 deadline.426 
a. Requests in the President’s 
Memorandum 
In light of the requirement to 
prescribe standards for MY 2011 by 
March 30, 2009 and in order to provide 
additional time to consider issues 
concerning the analysis used to 
determine the appropriate level of 
standards for MYs 2012 and beyond, the 
President issued a memorandum on 
January 26, 2009, requesting the 
Secretary of Transportation and 
Administrator427 of the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
NHTSA to divide the rulemaking into 
two parts: (1) MY 2011 standards, and 
(2) standards for MY 2012 and beyond. 
i. CAFE Standards for Model Year 2011 
The request that the final rule 
establishing CAFE standards for MY 
2011 passenger cars and light trucks be 
prescribed by March 30, 2009 was based 
on several factors. One was the 
requirement that the final rule regarding 
fuel economy standards for a given 
model year must be adopted at least 18 
months before the beginning of that 
model year (49 U.S.C. 32902(g)(2)). The 
other was that the beginning of MY 2011 
is considered for the purposes of CAFE 
standard setting to be October 1, 2010. 
ii. CAFE Standards for Model Years 
2012 and Beyond 
The President requested that, before 
promulgating a final rule concerning the 
model years after model year 2011, 
NHTSA 
[C]onsider the appropriate legal factors 
under the EISA, the comments filed in 
response to the Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, the relevant technological and 
scientific considerations, and to the extent 
feasible, the forthcoming report by the 
National Academy of Sciences mandated 
under section 107 of EISA. 
In addition, the President requested 
that NHTSA consider whether any 
provisions regarding preemption are 
appropriate under applicable law and 
policy. 
b. Implementing the President’s 
Memorandum 
In keeping with the President’s 
remarks on January 26 for new national 
policies to address the closely 
intertwined issues of energy 
independence, energy security and 
climate change, and for the initiation of 
serious and sustained domestic and 
international action to address them, 
NHTSA has developed CAFE standards 
for MY 2012 and beyond after collecting 
new information, conducting a careful 
review of technical and economic 
inputs and assumptions, and standard 
setting methodology, and completing 
new analyses. 
The goal of the review and re- 
evaluation was to ensure that the 
approach used for MY 2012 and 
thereafter would produce standards that 
contribute, to the maximum extent 
possible under EPCA/EISA, to meeting 
the energy and environmental 
challenges and goals outlined by the 
President. We have sought to craft our 
program with the goal of creating the 
maximum incentives for innovation, 
providing flexibility to the regulated 
parties, and meeting the goal of making 
substantial and continuing reductions in 
the consumption of fuel. To that end, 
we have made every effort to ensure that 
the CAFE program for MYs 2012–2016 
is based on the best scientific, technical, 
and economic information available, 
and that such information was 
developed in close coordination with 
other Federal agencies and our 
stakeholders, including the States and 
the vehicle manufacturers. 
We have also re-examined EPCA, as 
amended by EISA, to consider whether 
additional opportunities exist to 
improve the effectiveness of the CAFE 
program. For example, EPCA authorizes 
increasing the amount of civil penalties 
for violating the CAFE standards.428 
Further, if the test procedures used for 
light trucks were revised to provide for 
the operation of air conditioning during 
fuel economy testing, vehicle 
manufacturers would have a regulatory 
incentive to increase the efficiency and 
reduce the weight of air conditioning 
systems, thereby reducing both fuel

consumption and tailpipe emissions of 
CO2. 
With respect to the President’s request 
that NHTSA consider the issue of 
preemption, NHTSA is deferring further 
consideration of the preemption issue. 
The agency believes that it is 
unnecessary to address the issue further 
at this time because of the consistent 
and coordinated Federal standards that 
would apply nationally under the 
proposed National Program. 
The following paragraphs provide a 
summary addressing how NHTSA has 
complied with the President’s requests 
in the January 26 memorandum. 
NHTSA has reviewed comments 
received on the MY 2011 rulemaking 
and revisited its assumptions and 
methodologies for purposes of 
developing the proposed MY 2012–2016 
standards. For any given assumption or 
aspect of NHTSA’s analysis, comments 
rarely converged on a single position— 
and for many issues, NHTSA received 
diametrically-opposed comments from 
different parties—which makes it 
challenging to resolve the concerns of 
all parties in a single stroke. However, 
NHTSA has taken a fresh look at all the 
issues as part of its joint process with 
EPA, changing some assumptions and 
methodologies and validating others. 
The agency is confident that the 
assumptions and analysis used to 
develop these proposed standards 
represent the best possible approach 
that is consistent with NHTSA’s 
statutory requirements for setting the 
required fuel economy standards. 
The paragraphs below describe 
generally how the agency has reviewed 
comments on different issues related to 
the setting of the standards, and how the 
agency has either revised or validated 
its approach for the MY 2012–2016 
standards. Much more detail on how the 
agency addresses all of these issues is 
found below in the rest of NHTSA’s 
section of this preamble, in the joint 
TSD, and in NHTSA’s PRIA. 
How stringent should the standards 
be? How quickly should they increase? 
EPCA requires that NHTSA set its 
standards for each model year at the 
‘‘maximum feasible average fuel 
economy level that the Secretary 
decides the manufacturers can achieve 
in that model year’’ considering four 
factors: technological feasibility, 
economic practicability, the effect of 
other standards of the Government on 
fuel economy, and the need of the 
nation to conserve energy. None of these 
factors is further defined in the statute, 
and ‘‘maximum feasible average fuel 
economy level’’ is itself defined, if at all, 
only by reference to those four factors 
and the Secretary’s consideration of 
them.429 In addition, the agency has the 
authority to and traditionally does 
consider other relevant factors, such as 
the effect of the CAFE standards on 
motor vehicle safety. 
In the previous CAFE rulemaking, 
NHTSA proposed to set standards at the 
point at which societal net benefits were 
maximized, which drew a number of 
comments from both manufacturers and 
environmental and public interest 
groups. Manufacturers generally 
commented that standards should be 
lower than the ‘‘maximizing net 
benefits’’ alternative, due to lead time 
concerns and manufacturers’ difficulties 
in raising capital. Environmental and 
consumer groups, as well as a number 
of State Attorneys General, commented 
that NHTSA should set standards above 
that point, with some arguing in favor 
of standards as high as those at the point 
at which total costs equaled total 
benefits. Commenters also emphasized 
that NHTSA should ensure that 
standards increased ratably, as required 
by EISA. 
For this NPRM, NHTSA has analyzed 
the costs and benefits of the 
‘‘maximizing net benefits’’ alternative 
and other alternatives, using inputs that 
diverge substantially from those used in 
the analyses in the previous 
rulemakings to establish attribute-based 
standards. But the agency has not 
sought to use ‘‘maximizing net benefits’’ 
as a governing principle to select the 
applicable fuel economy standard in 
this NPRM. NHTSA’s balancing of the 
statutory factors in these difficult 
financial times leads it to make a 
different conclusion this time: NHTSA 
is proposing to set standards at 34.1 
mpg in MY 2016, below the point at 
which net benefits are maximized, due 
to economic practicability concerns. 
The results of the alternatives analysis 
for the ‘‘maximizing net benefits’’ 
alternative and the ‘‘total costs = total 
benefits’’ alternative may be found in 
the DEIS and in the PRIA. 
Additionally, because today’s 
proposed standards cover five model 
years, as opposed to the single model 
year covered by the March final rule, 
NHTSA is better able in this rulemaking 
to confirm that the standards do, in fact, 
increase ratably, as required by EISA. 
What attribute should NHTSA use to 
set the standards? 
In the previous rulemaking, most 
commenters agreed with NHTSA’s use 
of footprint as the vehicle attribute for 
setting CAFE standards. Some 
manufacturers commented that NHTSA 
should consider multiple attributes—for 
example, sports car manufacturers 
suggested a mix of footprint and 
horsepower, while truck manufacturers 
suggested a mix of footprint and towing, 
hauling, or off-road capability. Several 
members of Congress also supported the 
latter comment. 
For this NPRM, NHTSA and EPA 
together reconsidered the appropriate 
attribute for setting CAFE and CO2 
standards, and conclude that footprint 
best provides the ability address safety 
concerns without creating undue risk 
that program benefits will be lost to 
induced mix shifting. More information 
about this decision may be found in 
Section IV.C.5 below, in the draft joint 
TSD, and in NHTSA’s PRIA. 
What data should NHTSA use to 
develop the baseline market forecast? 
In the previous rulemaking, the 
proposed standards were based on data 
from only the seven largest 
manufacturers. Several small and 
limited-line manufacturers commented 
that either the passenger car standards 
should be based on the plans of all 
manufacturers subject to the standards, 
or some alternative form of standard 
should be set for them. Ultimately, 
NHTSA set the MY 2011 standards 
based on the plans of all manufacturers 
subject to the standards. 
However, a number of commenters 
also called for NHTSA to cease using 
manufacturer’s confidential product 
plans in any way for developing the 
standards. Because manufacturers 
request confidentiality when they 
submit their product plans to the agency 
out of competitive concerns, NHTSA is 
prohibited by regulation from releasing 
that information to the public. Thus, 
when NHTSA developed a baseline 
market forecast using information from 
the manufacturer’s product plans, 
NHTSA could not release that forecast 
intact for public review. 
For this NPRM, in response to these 
concerns, NHTSA and EPA are using a 
baseline market file developed almost 
entirely from publicly-available data. 
Relying on adjusted MY 2008 CAFE 
compliance data enables the agency to 
make the baseline public and helps to 
address transparency concerns. 
However, by virtue of not being based 
on product plans, some manufacturers’ 
concerns that the baseline does not 
represent their particular intentions for 
MYs 2012–2016 may not be addressed. 
These issues are explained in more 
detail in Section IV.C.1 below, in the 
draft joint TSD, and in NHTSA’s PRIA. 
Did commenters agree with NHTSA’s 
technology assumptions? 
In the previous rulemaking, 
manufacturers generally commented 
that NHTSA had underestimated the 
costs of technologies and overestimated

their effectiveness, and that the rate of 
diesel and hybrid application required 
by the standards was too high, too 
quickly. Environmental and consumer 
groups, and the States Attorneys 
General who commented, largely argued 
the opposite. Environmental and 
consumer groups and the States 
Attorneys General also commented that 
NHTSA should include downweighting 
in its analysis for vehicles under 5,000 
lbs GVWR, while the Insurance Institute 
for Highway Safety (IIHS) argued that 
NHTSA’s approach to restricting 
downweighting to only those vehicles 
was correct. 
For this NPRM, NHTSA, with EPA, 
has revisited every one of its cost and 
effectiveness estimates for individual 
technologies. Many of the estimates 
used in the MY 2011 final rule have 
been validated, while some have 
changed, notably the estimates for 
turbocharging and downsizing, diesels, 
and hybrids. Overall, the individual 
technology costs are lower for purposes 
of this NPRM than in the MY 2011 final 
rule due to the Indirect Cost Markup 
methodology developed by EPA for this 
rulemaking, which results in a lower 
markup than the 1.5 Retail Price 
Equivalent (RPE) markup previously 
used. The considerable majority of 
estimates for individual technology 
effectiveness were validated; changes 
largely resulted from the redefinition of 
certain electrification-related 
technologies and mild hybrids. 
Additionally, NHTSA is now 
applying downweighting/material 
substitution to vehicles below 5,000 lbs 
GVWR, albeit in a way that, we believe, 
mitigates the safety concerns to some 
extent. These issues are explained in 
more detail in Section IV.C.2 below, in 
the draft joint TSD, and in NHTSA’s 
PRIA. 
With regard to the President’s request 
that NHTSA consider, ‘‘to the extent 
feasible, the forthcoming report by the 
National Academy of Sciences 
mandated under section 107 of EISA,’’ 
we note that it was not feasible to 
consider this report for purposes of this 
NPRM because it is not scheduled to be 
completed until Fall 2009. However, 
NHTSA intends to make it available in 
the rulemaking docket as soon as the 
agency receives it, and will consider it 
for the final rule. 
Did commenters agree with NHTSA’s 
economic assumptions? 
In the previous rulemaking, NHTSA 
primarily received comments regarding 
four particular economic assumptions. 
Regarding fuel prices, many 
commenters supported NHTSA’s use of 
the AEO 2008 Reference Case, while 
many commenters also argued, given 
high pump prices in summer 2008, that 
NHTSA should use at least the AEO 
High Price Case or possibly a higher 
estimate. Regarding the discount rate, 
some commenters supported NHTSA’s 
use of 7 percent, while others argued 
that NHTSA should use no higher than 
3 percent. Regarding the magnitude of 
the rebound effect, some commenters 
supported NHTSA’s use of a 15 percent 
rebound effect, while some called for a 
higher number and some called for 
numbers as low as zero percent. And 
finally, for the social cost of carbon, 
some commenters supported NHTSA’s 
use of a domestic value and stated that 
the value should be $7/ton or lower, 
while other commenters argued that 
NHTSA should use a global value much 
higher than $7/ton, although there was 
little consensus as to what precise 
number. 
For this NPRM, NHTSA, with EPA, 
has revisited every one of its economic 
assumptions. Many of the assumptions 
used in the MY 2011 final rule have 
been validated, while some have 
changed. For fuel prices, NHTSA used 
the AEO High Price Case in the MY 
2011 final rule, but stated that its 
decision was based on its expectation 
that the Reference Case would soon be 
revised to reflect higher estimates of 
future fuel prices. EIA did, in fact, 
revise the Reference Case upward in 
AEO 2009 to levels higher than the 2008 
High Price Case, and NHTSA has 
therefore elected to use the Reference 
Case for this NPRM. For the discount 
rate, NHTSA is continuing to conduct 
and present the results of analyses using 
both a 3 percent and a 7 percent rate, 
as is EPA in its analysis. For the 
rebound effect, NHTSA took a fresh look 
at the recent literature and developed 
new estimates for the rebound effect, 
and has used a value of 10 percent in 
its analysis. And for the social cost of 
carbon, based on the results of an 
interagency effort to develop an estimate 
that can be used by all government 
agencies in rulemakings that affect 
climate change, NHTSA has conducted 
analyses for this NPRM using a range of 
values from $5 to $56/ton, representing 
global SCC values. These issues are 
explained in Section II above, in more 
detail in Section IV.C.3 below, in the 
joint TSD, and in NHTSA’s PRIA. 
Did commenters agree with NHTSA’s 
analytical tools? 
In the previous rulemaking, although 
some commenters generally supported 
NHTSA’s use of the CAFE modeling 
system developed by DOT’s Volpe 
National Transportation Systems Center 
(Volpe Center), other commenters 
expressed concerns regarding the 
modeling system, the ways in which the 
system was applied, and accessibility of 
the system and its inputs and outputs. 
Technical concerns regarding the 
model itself centered on the fact that it 
does not apply a direct and explicit 
representation of the physical processes 
connecting the engineering 
characteristics of a given vehicle to that 
vehicle’s fuel economy. As NHTSA 
explained in its March 2009 Federal 
Register notice establishing final MY 
2011 CAFE standards, full vehicle 
simulation could useful in developing 
model inputs, but not, at least in the 
foreseeable future, in performing 
forward-looking analysis of the future 
fleet.430 Having again reconsidered this 
issue, NHTSA again concludes that with 
proper care in developing model inputs, 
the Volpe model is as ‘‘physics-based’’ 
as is practical or necessary for CAFE 
analysis. 
Some commenters also questioned the 
model’s structural assumptions about 
manufacturers’ compliance strategies. 
NHTSA has reconsidered this question 
with respect to the potential for 
systematic underestimation or 
overestimation of compliance costs. As 
a result, the Volpe model has been 
modified to account for manufacturers’ 
ability to engage in ‘‘multi-year 
planning,’’ adding more technology than 
necessary for compliance in an early 
model year when a vehicle model is 
being redesigned in order to carry that 
technology forward and facilitate 
compliance in later model years. This 
major change to the Volpe model tends 
to produce greater costs (and benefits) in 
earlier model years in order to reduce 
costs in later model years. 
Some commenters also questioned the 
model’s use of externally-specified 
‘‘phase-in caps’’ to constrain the speed 
at which technologies can practicably be 
adopted. NHTSA has reconsidered these 
inputs in light of the fact that the model 
also assumes that most technologies can 
only be practicably applied during a 
vehicle redesign or (in some cases) 
freshening, and tentatively concludes 
that these inputs can be significantly 
relaxed. The analysis supporting today’s 
proposal therefore relies almost 
exclusively on the redesign- and refresh- 
related constraints to produce 
practicable estimates of potential 
technology adoption rates. We are 
seeking comment on this change to the 
model’s inputs, and note that further 
changes to these inputs would impact 
our analysis. 
Commenters had many other concerns 
regarding inputs to the model, such as 
economic inputs and technology-related 
estimates. Commenters often (and

432 See http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov (click on ‘‘Fuel 
Economy,’’ then ‘‘Related Links—CAFE Compliance 
and Effects Modeling System (Volpe Model)’’)

particularly in relation to the agency’s 
estimate of the social value of avoided 
CO2 emissions) mistakenly attributed 
these concerns to the model itself. In 
again reviewing commenters’ concerns 
regarding NHTSA’s analysis, the agency 
has carefully differentiated between (1) 
the model, (2) inputs to the model, and 
(3) ways in which the model is applied. 
We encourage commenters to do the 
same in reviewing the analysis 
supporting today’s proposal. 
Finally, some commenters expressed 
concern regarding the model’s 
transparency. However, as NHTSA 
explained in in the MY 2011 final rule, 
these concerns appeared to have been 
mistakenly applied to the model itself, 
as the actual lack of transparency 
related only to the agency’s use of 
manufacturers’ product plans, which 
formed the basis for inputs to the 
model.431 The agency had previously 
made publicly available the model, 
source code (i.e., computer 
programming instructions), model 
documentation, and sample input files. 
To make the model more easily 
accessible to the public, the agency 
began (in March 2009) placing all of this 
information on NHTSA’s Web site.432 In 
connection with today’s proposal, the 
agency is placing the updated model, 
code, and documentation on the Web 
site, along with inputs and outputs for 
agency’s current analysis. Among those 
inputs are those defining the agency’s 
baseline estimates of the MYs 2012– 
2016 U.S. market for passenger cars and 
light trucks, as these inputs do not, for 
today’s proposal, make use of 
manufacturers’ confidential product 
plans. 
How should NHTSA develop and fit 
the target curves? 
In the previous rulemaking, many 
commenters expressed concern about 
the steepness of the proposed curves for 
passenger cars, which occurred because 
of the way in which NHTSA fit the 
curves to the data. The more steep a 
curve is, the more rapidly mpg targets 
decrease as footprint increases. 
For this NPRM, NHTSA reconsidered 
how to address this concern and 
decided to propose curves that are based 
on a constrained linear function rather 
than a constrained logistic function, that 
are considerably less steep than the 
curves proposed in the previous 
rulemaking. This issue is discussed in 
greater detail in Section IV.C.5 below, in 
the joint TSD, and in NHTSA’s PRIA. 
Should NHTSA set additional 
‘‘backstop’’ standards besides the one 
established by Congress? 
In the previous rulemaking, several 
commenters argued that NHTSA must 
establish absolute backstop standards 
for imported passenger cars and light 
trucks, in addition to the one for 
domestically-manufactured passenger 
cars required by EISA. NHTSA 
examined its statutory authority and 
concluded that only a backstop for 
domestic passenger cars was 
permissible under the statute. 
For this NPRM, NHTSA has re- 
examined its authority, and while the 
agency still tentatively concludes that 
Congress’ intent is clear from the text of 
the statute, we recognize commenters’ 
concerns that attribute-based standards 
may not absolutely guarantee the level 
of fuel savings currently anticipated if 
market forces cause manufacturers to 
build larger vehicles in MYs 2012–2016. 
Thus, we seek comment on this issue, 
which is discussed in greater detail 
below in Section IV.C.5. 
Should NHTSA classify more vehicles 
as passenger cars rather than as light 
trucks? 
In the previous rulemaking, many 
commenters agreed with NHTSA’s 
decision to move many 2WD SUVs from 
the light truck to the passenger car fleet, 
but some commenters argued that 
NHTSA should go further and reclassify 
more light trucks as passenger cars. 
For this NPRM, NHTSA has 
reconsidered its vehicle classification 
system and has not included in the 
proposed regulatory text any changes to 
that system. However, NHTSA seeks 
comment on whether any changes 
should be adopted for that time period 
or whether changes, if any, should be 
deferred to MY 2017 and beyond. 
Classification issues are addressed in 
greater detail in Section IV.H below. 
5. Summary of the Proposed MY 2012– 
2016 CAFE Standards 
NHTSA is proposing CAFE standards 
that are, like the standards NHTSA 
promulgated in March 2009 for MY 
2011, expressed as mathematical 
functions depending on vehicle 
footprint. Footprint is one measure of 
vehicle size, and is determined by 
multiplying the vehicle’s wheelbase by 
the vehicle’s average track width.433 
Under the proposed CAFE standards, 
each light vehicle model produced for 
sale in the United States would have a 
fuel economy target. The CAFE levels 
that must be met by the fleet of each 
manufacturer would be determined by 
computing the sales-weighted harmonic 
average of the targets applicable to each 
of the manufacturer’s passenger cars and 
light trucks. These targets, the 
mathematical form and coefficients of 
which are presented later in today’s 
notice, appear as follows when the 
values of the targets are plotted versus 
vehicle footprint:

434 In NHTSA’s analysis, ‘‘undercompliance’’ is 
mitigated either through use of FFV credits, use of 
existing or ‘‘banked’’ credits, or through fine 
payment. Because NHTSA cannot consider 
availability of credits in setting standards, the 
estimated achieved CAFE levels presented here do 
not account for their use. In contrast, because 
Continued 
Under these proposed footprint-based 
CAFE standards, the CAFE levels 
required of individual manufacturers 
depend, as noted above, on the mix of 
vehicles sold. It is important to note that 
NHTSA’s CAFE standards and EPA’s 
GHG standards will both be in effect, 
and each will lead to increases in 
average fuel economy and CO2 
emissions reductions. The two agencies’ 
standards together comprise the 
National Program, and this discussion of 
costs and benefits of NHTSA’s CAFE 
standards does not change the fact that 
both the CAFE and GHG standards, 
jointly, are the source of the benefits 
and costs of the National Program. 
Based on the forecast developed for 
this NPRM of the MYs 2012–2016 
vehicle fleet, NHTSA estimates that the 
targets shown above would result in the 
following average required CAFE levels: 
TABLE IV.A.5–1—AVERAGE REQUIRED FUEL ECONOMY (MPG) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 
Passenger Cars ....................................................................................... 33.6 34.4 35.2 36.4 38.0

Combined .......................................................................................... 29.8 30.6 31.4 32.6 34.1 
For the reader’s reference, these miles 
per gallon would be equivalent to the 
following gallons per 100 miles for 
passenger cars and light trucks: 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016

Light Trucks ............................................................................................. 4.0 3.9063 3.8168 3.8168 3.5336 
NHTSA estimates that average 
achieved fuel economy levels will 
correspondingly increase through MY 
2016, but that manufacturers will, on 
average, undercomply 434 in some model

NHTSA is not prohibited from considering fine 
payment, the estimated achieved CAFE levels 
presented here include the assumption that BMW, 
Daimler (i.e., Mercedes), Porsche, and, Tata (i.e., 
Jaguar and Rover) will only apply technology up to 
the point that it would be less expensive to pay 
civil penalties. 
435 In NHTSA’s analysis, ‘‘overcompliance’’ 
occurs through multi-year planning: manufacturers 
apply some ‘‘extra’’ technology in early model years 
(e.g., MY 2014) in order to carry that technology 
forward and thereby facilitate compliance in later 
model years (e.g., MY 2016) 
436 Consistent with EPCA, NHTSA has not 
accounted for manufacturers’ ability to earn CAFE 
credits for selling FFVs, carry credits forward and 
back between model years, and transfer credits 
between the passenger car and light truck fleets. 
years and overcomply 435 in others, 
reaching a combined average fuel 
economy of 33.7 mpg in MY 2016.436 
Table IV.A.5–1 is the estimated required 
fuel economy for the proposed CAFE 
standards while Table IV.A.5–2 
includes the effects of some 
manufacturers’ payment of CAFE fines. 
In addition, Section IV.G.4 below 
contains an analysis of the achieved 
levels (and projected fuel savings, costs, 
and benefits) when the use of FFV 
credits is also assumed. 
TABLE IV.A.5–2—AVERAGE ACHIEVED FUEL ECONOMY (MPG) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS

Light Trucks ............................................................................................. 24.9 25.7 26.5 27.4 28.1 
Combined .......................................................................................... 29.3 30.5 31.5 32.7 33.7 
For the reader’s reference, these miles 
per gallon would be equivalent to the 
following gallons per 100 miles for 
passenger cars and light trucks:

Light Trucks ............................................................................................. 4.0241 3.8952 3.7713 3.6495 3.5604 
NHTSA estimates that these fuel 
economy increases will lead to fuel 
savings totaling 61.6 billion gallons 
during the useful lives of vehicles sold 
in MYs 2012–2016: 
TABLE IV.A.5–3—FUEL SAVED (BILLION GALLONS) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS

Combined .................................................................. 4.3 9.1 12.9 16.1 19.2 61.6 
The agency also estimates that these 
new CAFE standards will lead to 
corresponding reductions of CO2 
emissions totaling 656 million metric 
tons (mmt) during the useful lives of 
vehicles sold in MYs 2012–2016: 
TABLE IV.A.5–4—AVOIDED CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS (MMT) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total

Light Trucks ..................................................................... 19 40 58 73 85 275 
Combined .................................................................. 44 96 137 173 206 656 
The agency estimates that these fuel 
economy increases would produce other 
benefits (e.g., reduced time spent 
refueling), as well as some disbenefits 
(e.g., increase traffic congestion) caused 
by drivers’ tendency to increase travel 
when the cost of driving declines (as it 
does when fuel economy increases). The 
agency has estimated the total monetary 
value to society of these benefits and 
disbenefits, and estimates that the 
proposed standards will produce 
significant benefits to society. NHTSA 
estimates that, in present value terms, 
these benefits would total $200 billion 
over the useful lives of vehicles sold 
during MYs 2012–2016:

NHTSA attributes most of these 
benefits—about $157 billion, as noted 
above—to reductions in fuel 
consumption, valuing fuel (for societal 
purposes) at future pretax prices in the 
Energy Information Administration’s 
(EIA’s) reference case forecast from 
Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2009. 
The Preliminary Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (PRIA) accompanying today’s 
proposed rule presents a detailed 
analysis of specific benefits of the 
proposed rule.

Fuel savings ........................................................................... 61.6 billion gallons ................................................................ $158.0 billion. 
CO2 emissions reductions ...................................................... 656 million metric tons (mmt) ............................................... $16.4 billion. 
NHTSA estimates that the necessary 
increases in technology application will 
involve considerable monetary outlays, 
totaling $62.5 billion in incremental 
outlays (i.e., beyond those attributable 
to the MY 2011 standards) by new 
vehicle purchasers during MYs 2012– 
2016: 
TABLE IV.A.5–6—INCREMENTAL TECHNOLOGY OUTLAYS ($B) UNDER PROPOSED CAFE STANDARDS

Corresponding to these outlays and, to 
a much lesser extent, civil penalties that 
some companies are expected to pay for 
noncompliance, the agency estimates 
that the proposed standards would lead 
to increases in average new vehicle 
prices, ranging from $476 per vehicle in 
MY 2012 to $1,091 per vehicle in MY 
2016:

Neither EPCA nor EISA requires that 
NHTSA conduct a cost-benefit analysis 
in determining average fuel economy 
standards, but too, neither precludes its 
use.437 EPCA does require that NHTSA 
consider economic practicability among 
other factors, and NHTSA has 
concluded, as discussed elsewhere 
herein, that the standards it proposes 
today are economically practicable. 
Further validating and supporting its 
conclusion that the standards it 
proposes today are reasonable, a 
comparison of the standards’ costs and 
benefits shows that the standards’ 
estimated benefits far outweigh its 
estimated costs. Based on the figures 
reported above, NHTSA estimates that 
the total benefits of today’s proposed 
standards would be more three times 
the magnitude of the corresponding 
costs, such that the proposed standards 
would produce net benefits of nearly 
$138 billion over the useful lives of 
vehicles sold during MYs 2012–2016. 
B. Background 
1. Chronology of Events Since the 
National Academy of Sciences Called 
for Reforming and Increasing CAFE 
Standards 
a. National Academy of Sciences Issues 
Report on Future of CAFE Program 
(February 2002) 
i. Significantly Increasing CAFE 
Standards Without Making Them 
Attribute-Based Would Adversely Affect 
Safety 
In the 2002 congressionally-mandated 
report entitled ‘‘Effectiveness and 
Impact of Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy (CAFE) Standards,’’ 438 a 
committee of the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS) (‘‘2002 NAS Report’’) 
concluded that the then-existing form of 
passenger car and light truck CAFE 
standards permitted vehicle 
manufacturers to comply in part by 
downweighting and even downsizing 
their vehicles and that these actions had 
led to additional fatalities. The 
committee explained that this safety 
problem arose because, at that time, the 
CAFE standards were not attributed- 
based and thus subjected all passenger 
cars to the same fuel economy target and 
all light trucks to the same target, 
regardless of their weight, size, or load- 
carrying capacity.439 The committee 
said that this experience suggests that 
consideration should be given to 
developing a new system of fuel 
economy targets that reflects differences 
in such vehicle attributes. Without a 
thoughtful restructuring of the program, 
there would be the trade-offs that must 
be made if CAFE standards were 
increased by any significant amount.440 
In response to these conclusions, 
NHTSA issued attribute-based CAFE 
standards for light trucks and sought 
legislative authority to issue attribute- 
based CAFE standards for passenger 
cars before undertaking to raise the car

standards. Congress went a step further 
in enacting EISA, not only authorizing 
the issuance of attribute-based 
standards, but also mandating them. 
ii. Climate Change and Other 
Externalities Justify Increasing the CAFE 
Standards 
The NAS committee said that there 
are two compelling concerns that justify 
a government-mandated increase in fuel 
economy, both relating to externalities. 
The first and most important concern, it 
argued, is the accumulation in the 
atmosphere of greenhouse gases, 
principally carbon dioxide.441 
A second concern is that petroleum 
imports have been steadily rising 
because of the nation’s increasing 
demand for gasoline without a 
corresponding increase in domestic 
supply. The high cost of oil imports 
poses two risks: Downward pressure on 
the strength of the dollar (which drives 
up the cost of goods that Americans 
import) and an increase in U.S. 
vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks 
that cost the economy considerable real 
output. 
To determine how much the fuel 
economy standards should be increased, 
the committee urged that all social 
benefits be considered. That is, it urged 
not only that the dollar value of the 
saved fuel be considered, but also that 
the dollar value to society of the 
resulting reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions and in dependence on 
imported oil should be calculated and 
considered. The committee said that if 
it is possible to assign dollar values to 
these favorable effects, it becomes 
possible to make at least crude 
comparisons between the socially 
beneficial effects of measures to 
improve fuel economy on the one hand, 
and the costs (both out-of-pocket and 
more subtle) on the other. 
iii. Reforming the CAFE Program Could 
Address Inequity Arising From the 
CAFE Structure 
The 2002 NAS report expressed 
concerns about increasing the standards 
under the CAFE program as currently 
structured. While raising CAFE 
standards under the existing structure 
would reduce fuel consumption, doing 
so under alternative structures ‘‘could 
accomplish the same end at lower cost, 
provide more flexibility to 
manufacturers, or address inequities 
arising from the present’’ structure.442 
To address those structural problems, 
the report suggested various possible 
reforms. The report found that the 
‘‘CAFE program might be improved 
significantly by converting it to a system 
in which fuel targets depend on vehicle 
attributes.’’443 The report noted further 
that under an attribute-based approach, 
the required CAFE levels could vary 
among the manufacturers based on the 
distribution of their product mix. NAS 
stated that targets could vary among 
passenger cars and among trucks, based 
on some attribute of these vehicles such 
as weight, size, or load-carrying 
capacity. The report explained that a 
particular manufacturer’s average target 
for passenger cars or for trucks would 
depend upon the fractions of vehicles it 
sold with particular levels of these 
attributes.444 
2. NHTSA Issues Final Rule 
Establishing Attribute-Based CAFE 
Standards for MY 2008–2011 Light 
Trucks (March 2006) 
The 2006 final rule reformed the 
structure of the CAFE program for light 
trucks by introducing an attribute-based 
approach and using that approach to 
establish higher CAFE standards for MY 
2008–2011 light trucks.445 Reforming 
the CAFE program enables it to achieve 
larger fuel savings, while enhancing 
safety and preventing adverse economic 
consequences. 
As noted above, under Reformed 
CAFE, fuel economy standards were 
restructured so that they are based on a 
vehicle attribute, a measure of vehicle 
size called ‘‘footprint.’’ It is the product 
of multiplying a vehicle’s wheelbase by 
its track width. A target level of fuel 
economy was established for each 
increment in footprint (0.1 ft2). Trucks 
with smaller footprints have higher fuel 
economy targets; conversely, larger ones 
have lower targets. A particular 
manufacturer’s compliance obligation 
for a model year is calculated as the 
harmonic average of the fuel economy 
targets for the manufacturer’s vehicles, 
weighted by the distribution of the 
manufacturer’s production volumes 
among the footprint increments. Thus, 
each manufacturer is required to comply 
with a single overall average fuel 
economy level for each model year of 
production. 
Compared to Unreformed (non- 
attributed-based) CAFE, Reformed CAFE 
enhances overall fuel savings while 
providing vehicle manufacturers with 
the flexibility they need to respond to 
changing market conditions. Reformed 
CAFE also provides a more equitable 
regulatory framework by creating a level 
playing field for manufacturers, 
regardless of whether they are full-line 
or limited-line manufacturers. We were 
particularly encouraged that Reformed 
CAFE will confer no compliance 
advantage if vehicle makers choose to 
downsize some of their fleet as a CAFE 
compliance strategy, thereby reducing 
the adverse safety risks associated with 
the Unreformed CAFE program. 
3. Ninth Circuit Issues Decision re Final 
Rule for MY 2008–2011 Light Trucks 
(November 2007) 
On November 15, 2007, the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit issued its decision in Center for 
Biological Diversity v. NHTSA,446 the 
challenge to the MY 2008–11 light truck 
CAFE rule. The court held that EPCA 
permits, but does not require, the use of 
a marginal cost-benefit analysis. The 
court specifically emphasized NHTSA’s 
discretion to decide how to balance the 
statutory factors—as long as that 
balancing does not undermine the 
fundamental statutory purpose of energy 
conservation. 
However, the Court found that 
NHTSA had been arbitrary and 
capricious in the following respects: 
• NHTSA’s decision that it could not 
monetize the benefit of reducing CO2 
emissions for the purpose of conducting 
its marginal benefit-cost analysis; 
• NHTSA’s lack, in the Court’s view, 
of a reasoned explanation for its 
decision not to establish a ‘‘backstop’’ 
(i.e., a fixed minimum CAFE standard 
applicable to manufacturers); 
• NHTSA’s lack, again in the Court’s 
view, of a reasoned explanation for its 
decision not to revise the regulatory 
definitions for the passenger car and 
light truck categories of automobiles so 
that some vehicles currently classified 
as light trucks are instead classified as 
passenger cars; 
• NHTSA’s decision not to subject 
most medium- and heavy-duty pickups 
and most medium- and heavy-duty 
cargo vans (i.e., those between 8,500 and 
10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight 
rating (GVWR,) to the CAFE standards; 
• NHTSA’s decision to prepare and 
publish an Environmental Assessment 
(EA) and making a finding of no 
significant impact notwithstanding what 
the Court found to be an insufficiently 
broad range of alternatives, insufficient 
analysis of the climate change effects of 
the CO2 emissions, and limited 
assessment of cumulative impacts in its 
EA under the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA). 
The Court did not vacate the 
standards, but instead said it would 
remand the rule to NHTSA to

49644 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
447 The deadline in EPCA for issuing a final rule 
establishing, for the first time, a CAFE standard for 
a model year is 18 months before the beginning of 
that model year. 49 U.S.C. 32902(g)(2). The same 
deadline applies to issuing a final rule amending an 
existing CAFE standard so as to increase its 
stringency. Given that the agency has long regarded 
October 1 as the beginning of a model year, the 
statutory deadline for increasing the MY 2009 
standard was March 30, 2007, and the deadline for 
increasing the MY 2010 standard is March 30, 2008. 
Thus, the only model year for which there was 
sufficient time at the time of the Court’s decision 
to gather all of the necessary information, conduct 
the necessary analyses and complete a rulemaking 
was MY 2011. As noted earlier in this notice, 
however, EISA requires that a new standard be 
established for that model year. 
448 See CBD v. NHTSA, 538 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir. 
2008). 
449 73 FR 61859 (Oct. 18, 2008).

August 9, 2009). 
promulgate new standards consistent 
with its opinion ‘‘as expeditiously as 
possible and for the earliest model year 
practicable.447 Under the decision, the 
standards established by the April 2006 
final rule would remain in effect unless 
and until amended by NHTSA. In 
addition, it directed the agency to 
prepare an Environmental Impact 
Statement. 
4. Congress Enacts Energy Security and 
Independence Act of 2007 (December 
2007) 
As noted above in Section I.B., EISA 
significantly changed the provisions of 
EPCA governing the establishment of 
future CAFE standards. These changes 
made it necessary for NHTSA to pause 
in its efforts so that it could assess the 
implications of the amendments made 
by EISA and then, as required, revise 
some aspects of the proposals it had 
been developing (e.g., the model years 
covered and credit issues). 
5. NHTSA Proposes CAFE Standards for 
MYs 2011–2015 (April 2008) 
The agency cannot set out the exact 
level of CAFE that each manufacturer 
would have been required to meet for 
each model year under the passenger car 
or light truck standards since the levels 
would depend on information that 
would not be available until the end of 
each of the model years, i.e., the final 
actual production figures for each of 
those years. The agency can, however, 
project what the industry-wide level of 
average fuel economy would have been 
for passenger cars and for light trucks if 
each manufacturer produced its 
expected mix of automobiles and just 
met its obligations under the proposed 
‘‘optimized’’ standards for each model 
year. 
Passenger 
cars mpg 
Light trucks 
mpg 
MY 2011 ........... 31.2 25.0 
MY 2012 ........... 32.8 26.4 
MY 2013 ........... 34.0 27.8 
MY 2014 ........... 34.8 28.2 
Passenger 
cars mpg 
Light trucks 
mpg 
MY 2015 ........... 35.7 28.6 
The combined industry-wide average 
fuel economy (in miles per gallon, or 
mpg) levels for both cars and light 
trucks, if each manufacturer just met its 
obligations under the proposed 
‘‘optimized’’ standards for each model 
year, would have been as follows: 
Combined 
mpg 
MY 2011 ................................... 27.8 
MY 2012 ................................... 29.2 
MY 2013 ................................... 30.5 
MY 2014 ................................... 31.0 
MY 2015 ................................... 31.6 
The annual average increase during 
this five year period would have been 
approximately 4.5 percent. Due to the 
uneven distribution of new model 
introductions during this period and to 
the fact that significant technological 
changes could be most readily made in 
conjunction with those introductions, 
the annual percentage increases were 
greater in the early years in this period. 
6. Ninth Circuit Revises its Decision re 
Final Rule for MY 2008–2011 Light 
Trucks (August 2008) 
In response to the Government 
petition for rehearing, the Ninth Circuit 
modified its decision by replacing its 
direction to prepare an EIS with a 
direction to prepare either a new EA or, 
if necessary, an EIS.448 
7. NHTSA Releases Final Environmental 
Impact Statement (October 2008) 
On October 17, 2008, EPA published 
a notice announcing the availability of 
NHTSA’s final environmental impact 
statement (FEIS) for this rulemaking.449 
Throughout the FEIS, NHTSA relied 
extensively on findings of the United 
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S. 
Climate Change Science Program 
(USCCSP). In particular, the agency 
relied heavily on the most recent, 
thoroughly peer-reviewed, and credible 
assessments of global climate change 
and its impact on the United States: the 
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 
Working Group I4 and II5 Reports, and 
reports by the USCCSP that include 
Scientific Assessments of the Effects of 
Global Climate Change on the United 
States and Synthesis and Assessment 
Products. 
In the FEIS, NHTSA compared the 
environmental impacts of its preferred 
alternative and those of reasonable 
alternatives. It considered direct, 
indirect, and cumulative impacts and 
describes these impacts to inform the 
decisionmaker and the public of the 
environmental impacts of the various 
alternatives. 
Among other potential impacts, 
NHTSA analyzed the direct and indirect 
impacts related to fuel and energy use, 
emissions, including carbon dioxide 
and its effects on temperature and 
climate change, air quality, natural 
resources, and the human environment. 
Specifically, the FEIS used a climate 
model to estimate and report on four 
direct and indirect effects of climate 
change, driven by alternative scenarios 
of GHG emissions, including: 
1. Changes in CO2 concentrations; 
2. Changes in global mean surface 
temperature; 
3. Changes in regional temperature 
and precipitation; and 
4. Changes in sea level. 
NHTSA also considered the 
cumulative impacts of the proposed 
standards for MY 2011–2015 passenger 
cars and light trucks, together with 
estimated impacts of NHTSA’s 
implementation of the CAFE program 
through MY 2010 and NHTSA’s future 
CAFE rulemaking for MYs 2016–2020. 
8. Department of Transportation Decides 
not to Issue MY 2011–2015 Final Rule 
(January 2009) 
On January 7, 2009, the Department of 
Transportation announced that the Bush 
Administration would not issue the 
final rule, notwithstanding the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs’ 
completion of review of the rule under 
Executive Order 12866, Regulatory 
Planning and Review, on November 14, 
2008.450 
9. The President Requests NHTSA to 
Issue Final Rule for MY 2011 Only 
(January 2009) 
As explained above, in his 
memorandum of January 26, 2009, the 
President requested the agency to issue 
a final rule adopting CAFE standards for 
MY 2011 only. Further, the President 
requested NHTSA to establish standards 
for MY 2012 and later after considering 
the appropriate legal factors, the 
comments filed in response to the May 
2008 proposal, the relevant 
technological and scientific 
considerations, and, to the extent 
feasible, a forthcoming report by the

10. NHTSA Issues Final Rule for MY 
2011 (March 2009) 
a. Introduction 
NHTSA’s review and analysis of 
comments on its proposal led the 
agency to make many changes to its 
methods for analyzing potential MY 
2011 CAFE standards, as well as to the 
data and other information to which the 
agency has applied these methods. The 
following are some of the more 
prominent changes: 
• After receiving, reviewing, and 
integrating updated product plans from 
vehicle manufacturers, NHTSA revised 
its forecast of the future light vehicle 
market. 
• NHTSA changed the methods and 
inputs it used to represent the 
applicability, availability, cost, and 
effectiveness of future fuel-saving 
technologies. 
• NHTSA based its fuel price forecast 
on the AEO 2008 High Case price 
scenario instead of the AEO 2008 
Reference Case. 
• NHTSA reduced mileage 
accumulation estimates (i.e., vehicle 
miles traveled) to levels consistent with 
this increased fuel price forecast. 
• NHTSA applied increased estimates 
for the value of oil import externalities. 
• NHTSA included all 
manufacturers—not just the largest 
seven—in the process used to fit the 
curve and estimate the stringency at 
which societal net benefits are 
maximized. 
• NHTSA tightened its application of 
the definition of ‘‘nonpassenger 
automobiles,’’ causing a reassigning of 
over one million vehicles from the light 
truck fleet to the passenger car fleet, and 
lowering the average fuel economy for 
cars due to the inclusion of vehicles 
previously categorized as trucks, as well 
as the average fuel economy for trucks 
because the truck category then had a 
larger proportion of heavier trucks. 
• NHTSA fitted the shape of the 
curve based on ‘‘exhaustion’’ of 
available technologies instead of on 
manufacturer-level optimization of 
CAFE levels. 
These changes affected both the shape 
and stringency of the attribute-based 
standards. Taken together, the last three 
of the above changes reduced the 
steepness of the curves defining fuel 
economy targets for passenger cars, and 
also less significantly reduced the 
steepness of the light truck curves. 
b. Standards 
The final rule established footprint- 
based fuel economy standards for MY 
2011 passenger cars and light trucks, 
where each vehicle manufacturer’s 
required level of CAFE was based on 
target levels of average fuel economy set 
for vehicles of different sizes and on the 
distribution of that manufacturer’s 
vehicles among those sizes. The curves 
defining the performance target at each 
footprint reflect the technological and 
economic capabilities of the industry. 
The target for each footprint is the same 
for all manufacturers, regardless of 
differences in their overall fleet mix. 
Compliance would be determined by 
comparing a manufacturer’s 
harmonically averaged fleet fuel 
economy levels in a model year with a 
required fuel economy level calculated 
using the manufacturer’s actual 
production levels and the targets for 
each footprint of the vehicles that it 
produces. 
The agency analyzed seven regulatory 
alternatives, one of which maximizes 
net benefits within the limits of 
available information and was known at 
the time as the ‘‘optimized standards.’’ 
The optimized standards were set at 
levels, such that, considering all of the 
manufacturers together, no other 
alternative is estimated to produce 
greater net benefits to society. Upon a 
considered analysis of all information 
available, including all information 
submitted to NHTSA in comments, the 
agency adopted the ‘‘optimized 
standard’’ alternative as the final 
standards for MY 2011.451 By limiting 
the standards to levels that can be 
achieved using technologies each of 
which are estimated to provide benefits 
that at least equal its costs, the net 
benefit maximization approach helped, 
at the time, to assure the marketability 
of the manufacturers’ vehicles and thus 
economic practicability of the 
standards. Providing this assurance 
assumed increased importance in view 
of current and anticipated conditions in 
the industry in particular and the 
economy in general. As was widely 
reported in the public domain 
throughout that rulemaking, and as 
shown in public comments, the national 
and global economies raised serious 
concerns. Even before those recent 
developments, the automobile 
manufacturers were already facing 
substantial difficulties. Together, these 
problems made NHTSA’s economic 
practicability analysis particularly 
important and challenging in that 
rulemaking. 
The agency could not set out the exact 
level of CAFE that each manufacturer 
would be required to meet for MY 2011 
under the passenger car or light truck 
standards because the levels will 
depend on information that will not be 
available until the end of that model 
year, i.e., the final actual production 
figures for that year. However, the 
following levels were projected for what 
the industry-wide level of average fuel 
economy will be for passenger cars and 
for light trucks if each manufacturer 
produced its expected mix of 
automobiles and just met its obligations 
under the ‘‘optimized’’ standards. 
Passenger 
cars mpg 
Light trucks 
mpg 
MY 2011 ........... 30.2 24.1 
The combined industry-wide average 
fuel economy (in miles per gallon, or 
mpg) levels for both cars and light 
trucks, if each manufacturer just met its 
obligations under the ‘‘optimized’’ 
standards, were projected as follows: 
Combined 
mpg 
mpg in-
crease over 
prior year 
MY 2011 ........... 27.3 2.0 
In addition, per EISA, each 
manufacturer’s domestic passenger fleet 
is required in MY 2011 to achieve 27.5 
mpg or 92 percent of the CAFE of the 
industry-wide combined fleet of 
domestic and non-domestic passenger 
cars 452 for that model year, whichever 
is higher. This requirement resulted in 
the following projected alternative 
minimum standard (not attribute-based) 
for domestic passenger cars: 
Domestic 
passenger 
cars mpg 
MY 2011 ................................... 27.8 
c. Credits 
NHTSA also adopted a new Part 536 
on use of ‘‘credits’’ earned for exceeding 
applicable CAFE standards. Part 536 
implements the provisions in EISA 
authorizing NHTSA to establish by 
regulation a credit trading program and 
directing it to establish by regulation a 
credit transfer program.453 Since its

those credits to compliance obligations 
in years other than the model year in 
which it was earned. EISA extended the 
‘‘carry-forward’’ period to five model 
years, and left the ‘‘carry-back’’ period 
at three model years. Under Part 536, 
credit holders (including, but not 
limited to, manufacturers) will have 
credit accounts with NHTSA, and will 
be able to hold credits, apply them to 
compliance with CAFE standards, 
transfer them to another ‘‘compliance 
category’’ for application to compliance 
there, or trade them. A credit may also 
be cancelled before its expiry date, if the 
credit holder so chooses. Traded and 
transferred credits will be subject to an 
‘‘adjustment factor’’ to ensure total oil 
savings are preserved, as required by 
EISA. EISA also prohibits credits earned 
before MY 2011 from being transferred, 
so NHTSA has developed several 
regulatory restrictions on trading and 
transferring to facilitate Congress’ intent 
in this regard. 
11. Energy Policy and Conservation Act, 
as Amended by the Energy 
Independence and Security Act 
NHTSA’s statutory authority and 
obligations under the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as 
amended by the Energy Independence 
and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), is 
discussed at length above in Section 
I.B.1. 
C. Development and Feasibility of the 
Proposed Standards 
1. How Was the Baseline Vehicle Fleet 
Developed? 
a. Why Do the Agencies Establish a 
Baseline Vehicle Fleet? 
In order to determine what levels of 
stringency are feasible in future model 
years, the agencies must project what 
vehicles will exist in those model years, 
and then evaluate what technologies can 
feasibly be applied to those vehicles in 
order to raise their fuel economy and 
lower their CO2 emissions. The agencies 
therefore establish a baseline vehicle 
fleet representing those vehicles, based 
on the best available information. Each 
agency then developed a separate 
reference fleet, accounting (via their 
respective models) for the effect that the 
MY 2011 CAFE standards have on the 
baseline fleet. This reference fleet is 
then used for comparisons of 
technologies’ incremental cost and 
effectiveness, as well as the other 
relevant comparisons in the rule. 
b. What Data Did the Agencies Use To 
Construct the Baseline, and How Did 
They Do So? 
As explained in the Technical 
Support Document (TSD) prepared 
jointly by NHTSA and EPA, both 
agencies used a baseline vehicle fleet 
constructed beginning with EPA fuel 
economy certification data for the 2008 
model year, the most recent for which 
final data is currently available from 
manufacturers. This data was used as 
the source for MY 2008 production 
volumes and some vehicle engineering 
characteristics, such fuel economy 
ratings, engine sizes, numbers of 
cylinders, and transmission types. 
Some information important for 
analyzing new CAFE standards is not 
contained in the EPA fuel economy 
certification data. EPA staff estimated 
vehicle wheelbase and track widths 
using data from Motortrend.com and 
Edmunds.com. This information is 
necessary for estimating vehicle 
footprint, which is required for the 
analysis of footprint-based standards. 
Considerable additional information 
regarding vehicle engineering 
characteristics is also important for 
estimating the potential to add new 
technologies in response to new CAFE 
standards. In general, such information 
helps to avoid ‘‘adding’’ technologies to 
vehicles that already have the same or 
a more advanced technology. Examples 
include valvetrain configuration (e.g., 
OHV, SOHC, DOHC), presence of 
cylinder deactivation, and fuel delivery 
(e.g., MPFI, SIDI). To the extent that 
such engineering characteristics were 
not available in certification data, EPA 
staff relied on data published by Ward’s 
Automotive, supplementing this with 
information from Internet sites such as 
Motortrend.com and Edmunds.com. 
NHTSA staff also added some more 
detailed engineering characteristics (e.g, 
type of variable valve timing) using data 
available from ALLDATA® Online. 
Combined with the certification data, all 
of this information yielded a MY 2008 
baseline vehicle fleet. 
After the baseline was created the 
next step was to project the sales 
volumes for 2011–2016 model years. 
EPA used projected car and truck 
volumes for this period from Energy 
Information Administration’s (EIA’s) 
2009 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO).454 
However, AEO projects sales only at the 
car and truck level, not at the 
manufacturer and model-specific level, 
which are needed in order to estimate 
the effects new standards will have on 
individual manufacturers. Therefore, 
EPA purchased data from 
CSM-Worldwide and used their 
projections of the number of vehicles of 
each type predicted to be sold by 
manufacturers in 2011–2015.455 This 
provided the year-by-year percentages of 
cars and trucks sold by each 
manufacturer as well as the percentages 
of each vehicle segment. Although it 
was, therefore, necessary to assume the 
same manufacturer and segment shares 
in 2016 as in 2015, 2016 estimates from 
CSM should be available for the final 
rule. Using these percentages 
normalized to the AEO projected 
volumes then provided the 
manufacturer-specific market share and 
model-specific sales for model years 
2011–2016. 
The processes for constructing the MY 
2008 baseline vehicle fleet and 
subsequently adjusting sales volumes to 
construct the MY 2011–2016 baseline 
vehicle fleet are presented in detail in 
Chapter 1 of the draft Joint Technical 
Support Document accompanying 
today’s notice. 
c. How Is This Different From NHTSA’s 
Historical Approach and Why is This 
Approach Preferable? 
As discussed above in Section II.B.3, 
NHTSA has historically based its 
analysis of potential new CAFE 
standards on detailed product plans the 
agency has requested from 
manufacturers planning to produce light 
vehicles for sale in the United States. In 
contrast, the current market forecast is 
based primarily on information sources 
which are all either in the public 
domain or available commercially. 
There are advantages to this approach, 
namely transparency and the potential 
to reduce some errors due to 
manufacturers’ misunderstanding of 
NHTSA’s request for information. There 
are also disadvantages, namely that the 
current market forecast does not 
represent certain changes likely to occur 
in the future vehicle fleet as opposed to 
the MY 2008 vehicle fleet, such as 
vehicles being discontinued and newly 
introduced. On balance, however, the 
agencies have carefully considered these

advantages and disadvantages of using a 
market forecast derived from public and 
commercial sources rather than from 
manufacturers’ product plans, and 
conclude that the advantages outweigh 
the disadvantages. 
Nevertheless, the agencies are hopeful 
that manufacturers will, in the future, 
agree to make public their plans 
regarding model years that are very 
near, such as MY 2010 or perhaps MY 
2011, so that this information can be 
incorporated into an analysis that is 
available for public review and 
comment. In any event, because NHTSA 
and EPA are releasing market inputs 
used in the agencies’ respective 
analyses, manufacturers, suppliers, and 
other automobile industry observers and 
participants can submit comments on 
how these inputs should be revised, as 
can all other reviewers. More 
information on the advantages and 
disadvantages of the current approach 
and the agencies’ decision to follow it 
is available in Section II.B.3. 
d. How Is This Baseline Different 
Quantitatively From the Baseline That 
NHTSA Used for the MY 2011 (March 
2009) Final Rule? 
As discussed above, the current 
baseline was developed from adjusted 
MY 2008 compliance data and covers 
MYs 2011–2016, while the baseline that 
NHTSA used for the MY 2011 CAFE 
rule was developed from confidential 
manufacturer product plans for MY 
2011. This section describes, for the 
reader’s comparison, some of the 
differences between the current baseline 
and the MY 2011 CAFE rule baseline. 
Estimated vehicle sales: 
The sales forecasts, based on the 
Energy Information Administration’s 
(EIA’s) Annual Energy Outlook 2009 
(AEO 2009), used in the current baseline 
indicate that the total number of light 
vehicles expected to be sold during MYs 
2011–2015 is 77 million, or about 15.4 
million vehicles annually. NHTSA’s MY 
2011 final rule forecast, based on AEO 
2008, of the total number of light 
vehicles likely to be sold during MY 
2011 through MY 2015 was 83 million, 
or about 16.6 million vehicles annually. 
Light trucks are expected to make up 40 
percent of the MY 2011 baseline market 
forecast in the current baseline, 
compared to 42 percent of the baseline 
market forecast in the MY 2011 final 
rule. These changes in both the overall 
size of the light vehicle market and the 
relative market shares of passenger cars 
and light trucks reflect changes in the 
economic forecast underlying AEO, and 
changes in AEO’s forecast of future fuel 
prices. 
The figures below attempt to 
demonstrate graphically the difference 
between the variation of fuel economy 
with footprint for passenger cars under 
the current baseline and MY 2011 final 
rule, and for light trucks under the 
current baseline and MY 2011 final rule, 
respectively. Figures IV.C.1–1 and 1–2 
show the variation of fuel economy with 
footprint for passenger car models in the 
current baseline and in the MY 2011 
final rule, while Figures IV.C.1–3 and 1– 
4 show the variation of fuel economy 
with footprint for light truck models in 
the current baseline and in the MY 2011 
final rule. However, it is difficult to 
draw meaningful conclusions by 
comparing figures from the current 
baseline with those of the MY 2011 final 
rule. In the current baseline the number 
of make/models, and their associated 
fuel economy and footprint, are fixed 
and do not vary over time—this is why 
the number of data points in the current 
baseline figures appears smaller as 
compared to the number of data points 
in the MY 2011 final rule baseline. In 
contrast, the baseline fleet used in the 
MY 2011 final rule varies over time as 
vehicles (with different fuel economy 
and footprint characteristics) are added 
to and dropped from the product mix.

456 As explained below, although NHTSA 
normalized each manufacturer’s overall market 
share to produce a realistically-sized fleet, the 
product mix for each manufacturer that submitted 
product plans was preserved. The agency has 
reviewed manufacturers’ product plans in detail, 
and understands that manufacturers do not sell the 
same mix of vehicles in every model year. 
457 Kia is not listed in the table for the MY 2011 
final rule because it was considered as part of 
Hyundai for purposes of that analysis (i.e., 
Hyundai-Kia).

NHTSA’s expectations regarding 
manufacturers’ market shares (the basis 
for which is discussed below) have also

agency’s sales forecasts for passenger 
cars and light trucks under the current

indicated in the current baseline of 
adjusted MY 2008 compliance data. 
FFVs create a potential market for 
alternatives to petroleum-based gasoline 
and diesel fuel. For purposes of 
determining compliance with CAFE 
standards, the fuel economy of a FFV is, 
subject to limitations, adjusted upward 
to account for this potential.458 
However, NHTSA is precluded from 
‘‘taking credit’’ for the compliance 
flexibility by accounting for 
manufacturers’ ability to earn and use 
credits in setting the level of the 
standards.’’459 Some manufacturers plan 
to produce a considerably greater share 
of FFVs than can earn full credit under 
EPCA. The projected average FFV share 
of the market in MY 2011 is 6 percent 
for the current baseline, versus 17 
percent for the MY 2011 final rule. 
Estimated achieved fuel economy 
levels: 
Because manufacturers’ product plans 
also reflect simultaneous changes in 
fleet mix and other vehicle 
characteristics, the relationship between 
increased technology utilization and 
increased fuel economy cannot be 
isolated with any certainty. To do so 
would require an apples-to-apples 
‘‘counterfactual’’ fleet of vehicles that 
are, except for technology and fuel 
economy, identical—for example, in 
terms of fleet mix and vehicle 
performance and utility. The current 
baseline market forecast shows 
industry-wide average fuel economy 
levels somewhat higher in MY 2011 
than shown in the MY 2011 final rule. 
Under the current baseline, average fuel 
economy for MY 2011 is 26.7 mpg, 
versus 26.5 mpg under the baseline in 
the MY 2011 final rule. 
These differences are shown in greater 
detail below in Table IV.C.1–2, which 
shows manufacturer-specific CAFE 
levels (not counting FFV credits that 
some manufacturers expect to earn) 
from the current baseline versus the MY 
2011 final rule baseline (from 
manufacturers’ 2008 product plans) for 
passenger cars and light trucks. Table 
IV.C.1–3 shows the combined averages 
of these planned CAFE levels in the 
respective baseline fleets. These tables 
demonstrate that, while the difference at 
the industry level is not so large, there 
are significant differences in CAFE at 
the manufacturer level between the 
current baseline and the MY 2011 final 
rule baseline. For example, while Honda 
and Hyundai are essentially the same 
under both, Toyota and Nissan show 
increased combined CAFE levels under 
the current baseline (by 2.4 and 0.8 mpg 
respectively), while Chrysler, Ford, and 
GM show decreased combined CAFE 
levels under the current baseline (by 
1.1, 1.8, and 1.0 mpg, respectively) 
relative to the MY 2011 final rule 
baseline.

Tables IV.C.1–5a and 1–5b show that 
the current baseline reflects a decrease 
in overall average vehicle weight 
relative to the manufacturers’ plans. As 
above, this is most likely a reflection of 
the market segment shifts underlying 
the sales forecasts of the current 
baseline.

Tables IV.C.1–6a and IV.C.1–6b show 
that the current baseline reflects a 
decrease in average performance relative 
to that of the manufacturers’ product 
plans. This decreased performance is 
most likely a reflection of the market 
segment shifts underlying the sales 
forecasts of the current baseline, that is, 
an assumed shift away from higher 
performance vehicles.

As discussed above, the agencies’ 
market forecast for MY 2012–2016 holds 
the performance and other 
characteristics of individual vehicle 
models constant, adjusting the size and 
composition of the fleet from one model 
year to the next. 
Refresh and redesign schedules (for 
application in NHTSA’s modeling): 
Expected model years in which each 
vehicle model will be redesigned or 
freshened constitute another important 
aspect of NHTSA’s market forecast. As 
discussed in Section IV.C.2.c below, 
NHTSA’s analysis supporting the 
current rulemaking times the addition of 
nearly all technologies to coincide with 
either a vehicle redesign or a vehicle 
freshening. Product plans submitted to 
NHTSA preceding the MY 2011 final 
rule contained manufacturers’ estimates 
of vehicle redesign and freshening 
schedules and NHTSA’s estimates of the 
timing of the five-year redesign cycle 
and the two- to three-year refresh cycle 
were made with reference to those 
plans. In the current baseline, in 
contrast, estimates of the timing of the 
refresh and redesign cycles were based 
on historical dates—i.e., counting 
forward from known redesigns 
occurring in or prior to MY 2008 for 
each vehicle in the fleet and assigning 
refresh and redesign years accordingly. 
After applying these estimates, the 
shares of manufacturers’ passenger car 
and light truck estimated to be 
redesigned in MY 2011 were as 
summarized below for the current 
baseline and the MY 2011 final rule. 
Table IV.C.1–7 below shows the 
percentages of each manufacturer’s 
fleets expected to be redesigned in MY 
2011 for the current baseline. Table 
IV.C.1–8 presents corresponding 
estimates from the market forecast used 
by NHTSA in the analysis supporting 
the MY 2011 final rule (again, to protect 
confidential information, manufacturers 
are not identified by name).

for brevity and for the reader’s reference if they 
wish to refer to the expanded decision trees and the 
model input and output sheets, which are available 
in Docket No. NHTSA–2009–0059 and on NHTSA’s 
Web site. 
465 A date of 2011 means the technology can be 
applied in all model years, while a date of 2014 
means the technology can only be applied in model 
years 2014 through 2016.

We continue, therefore, to estimate 
that manufacturers’ redesigns will not 
be uniformly distributed across model 
years. This is in keeping with standard 
industry practices, and reflects what 
manufacturers actually do—NHTSA has 
observed that manufacturers in fact do 
redesign more vehicles in some years 
than in others. NHTSA staff have 
closely examined manufacturers’ 
planned redesign schedules, contacting 
some manufacturers for clarification of 
some plans, and confirmed that these 
plans remain unevenly distributed over 
time. For example, although Table 8 
shows that NHTSA expects Company 2 
to redesign 34 percent of its passenger 
car models in MY 2011, current 
information indicates that this company 
will then redesign only (a different) 10 
percent of its passenger cars in MY 
2012. Similarly, although Table 8 shows 
that NHTSA expects four of the largest 
seven light truck manufacturers to 
redesign virtually no light truck models 
in MY 2011, current information also 
indicates that these four manufacturers 
will redesign 21–49 percent of their 
light trucks in MY 2012. 
e. How Does Manufacturer Product Plan 
Data Factor Into the Baseline Used in 
This Proposal? 
As discussed in Section II.B.4 above, 
while the agencies received updated 
product plans in Spring 2009 in 
response to NHTSA’s request, the 
baseline data used in this proposal is 
not informed by these product plans, 
because they contain confidential 
business information the agencies are 
legally required to protect from 
disclosure, and because the agencies 
have concluded that, for purposes of 
this NPRM, a transparent baseline is 
preferable. 
However, as also discussed above, 
NHTSA has conducted a separate 
analysis that does make use of these 
product plans, contained in NHTSA’s 
PRIA. NHTSA performed this separate 
analysis for purposes of comparison 
only. NHTSA used the publicly 
available baseline for all analysis related 
to the development and evaluation of 
the proposed new CAFE standards. 
2. How Were the Technology Inputs 
Developed? 
As discussed above in Section II.E, for 
developing the technology inputs for the 
MY 2012–2016 CAFE and GHG 
standards, the agencies primarily began 
with the technology inputs used in the 
MY 2011 CAFE final rule and in the July 
2008 EPA ANPRM, and then reviewed, 
as requested by President Obama in his 
January 26 memorandum, the 
technology assumptions that NHTSA 
used in setting the MY 2011 standards 
and the comments that NHTSA received 
in response to its May 2008 Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking. In addition, the 
agencies supplemented their review 
with updated information from more 
current literature, new product plans 
and from EPA certification testing. More 
detail is available regarding how the 
agencies developed the technology 
inputs for this NPRM above in Section 
II.E, in Chapter 3 of the Draft Joint TSD, 
and in Section V of NHTSA’s PRIA. 
a. What Technologies Does NHTSA 
Consider? 
Section II.E.1 above describes the 
fuel-saving technologies considered by 
the agencies that manufacturers could 
use to improve the fuel economy of their 
vehicles during MYs 2012–2016. The 
majority of the technologies described 
in this section are readily available, well 
known, and could be incorporated into 
vehicles once production decisions are 
made. As discussed, the technologies 
considered fall into five broad 
categories: Engine technologies, 
transmission technologies, vehicle 
technologies, electrification/accessory 
technologies, and hybrid technologies. 
Table IV.C.2–1 below lists all the 
technologies considered and provides 
the abbreviations used for them in the 
Volpe model,464 as well as their year of 
availability, which for purposes of 
NHTSA’s analysis means the first model 
year in the rulemaking period that the 
Volpe model is allowed to apply a 
technology to a manufacturer’s fleet.465 
Year of availability recognizes that 
technologies must achieve a level of 
technical viability before they can be 
implemented in the Volpe model, and 
are thus a means of constraining 
technology use until such time as it is 
considered to be technologically 
feasible. For a more detailed description 
of each technology and their costs and 
effectiveness, we refer the reader to 
Chapter 3 of the joint TSD and Section 
V of NHTSA’s PRIA.

466 As an additional note, since combustion 
restart was unavailable in the MY 2011 time frame, 
the technology titled diesel following combustion 
restart (DSLC), which as the name indicates was 
only applied after combustion restart, was also 
unavailable. Accordingly, DSLC, which was 
described and discussed in the MY 2011 final rule, 
is now available in the current analysis.

For purposes of this NPRM and as 
discussed in greater detail in the joint 
TSD, NHTSA and EPA carefully 
reviewed the list of technologies used in 
the agency’s analysis for the MY 2011 
final rule. Given the relatively short 
amount of time, from a technology- 
development perspective, that has 
elapsed since March 2009 and this 
NPRM, NHTSA and EPA concluded that 
the considerable majority of 
technologies were correctly defined and 
continued to be appropriate for use in 
the analysis supporting the proposed 
standards. However, some refinements 
were made as discussed below. 
Specific to its modeling, NHTSA has 
revised eight of the technologies used in 
the current analysis from those 
considered in the MY 2011 final rule. 
Specifically, two technologies which 
were previously unavailable in the MY 
2011 time frame are now available (in 
the extended MY 2012–2016 period); 
one technology has been combined with 
another; one is newly introduced; three 
have revised names and/or definitions; 
and one has been deleted entirely. 
These changes are discussed further 
below, and NHTSA seeks comment on 
both these changes and the validation of 
the unchanged technology assumptions 
and estimates. 
Availability: In the MY 2011 final 
rule, two of the engine technologies— 
EGR boost and combustion restart— 
were unavailable because they were not 
considered technologically feasible until 
beyond that rulemaking time frame. 
While both were described and 
discussed in the MY 2011 final rule, 
neither was applied in the modeling 
process that supported those 
standards.466 In this analysis, EGR boost 
becomes available in MY 2013, and 
combustion restart in MY 2014, so both 
are being applied by the Volpe model, 
as needed, in this analysis. 
Merging of technologies: In the MY 
2011 final rule, higher voltage and 
improved alternator (HVIA) was used to 
represent changes in the design of the 
alternator, effectively optimizing it for 
higher efficiency (instead of for low cost 
as is typically done). For purposes of 
this analysis, the HVIA technology is no 
longer represented individually, but 
instead has been incorporated into a 
new-to-this-analysis technology called 
belt integrated starter generator, or 
BISG, as discussed next. 
New technology: In the MY 2011 final 
rule, two levels of mild hybrid 
technology were defined: A 12 volt 
micro-hybrid (MHEV) system, which 
utilized a belt-driven starter generator 
operating at 12 volts, and the more 
capable integrated starter generator 
technology (ISG) operating at higher 
voltages (100 volts). ISG envisioned 
both belt and crank configured starter 
generator systems. In the current 
proposal, and in an effort to offer a 
broader spectrum of more diversified 
mild hybrid technologies for the 
modeling process to choose from, 
NHTSA has added the BISG technology 
to the electrification decision tree, and 
redefined the ISG technology to be a 
crank mounted version of ISG, 
accordingly renamed to CISG. 
The BISG technology is a belt-coupled 
system like the 12-volt MHEV, but it 
operates at a higher voltage (e.g., 42 
volts) and thus can make use of 
regenerative braking, as well as

467 Examples of such weight savings associated 
with new platform introductions have been 
provided in confidential product plan information 
provided by some manufacturers.

Reduce Light-Duty Vehicle Carbon Dioxide 
Emissions. EPA420–R–08–008, March 2008. 
potentially adding some limited motive 
power. Since BISG is a higher voltage 
system, optimization of the alternator 
occurs as part of the BISG technology 
application; hence the HVIA technology 
is no longer needed as a separate 
technology. Additionally, the CISG 
technology is now defined as a crank 
mounted system that operates at higher 
voltages (100 volts) than BISG, yet at 
lower voltage than the strong hybrids 
(300 volts) that make greater use of 
regenerative braking and provide greater 
motive power capability. Thus, three 
levels of mild hybrid technology exist in 
the current proposal, as opposed to the 
two levels offered in the MY 2011 final 
rule. 
Revisions and Deletions: The Mass 
Reduction/Material Substitution 
technologies have been revised for the 
current proposal. In the MY 2011 final 
rule, the Volpe model used three levels 
of material substitution technologies, 
referred to as MS1, MS2, and MS5, 
which were progressively applied to 
vehicles with curb weights in excess of 
5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) so as to reduce 
weight by up to a 5 percent maximum. 
In keeping with the agency’s desire to 
limit potential negative impacts to 
safety performance as a result of vehicle 
weight reduction, material substitution 
was not applied to vehicles with curb 
weights below 5,000 pounds. In 
contrast, in the current analysis, and in 
keeping with some manufacturers’ 
stated plans to decrease overall fleet 
weights regardless of subclass or curb 
weight, NHTSA now defines two Mass 
Reduction/Material Substitution 
technologies as follows: 
The Mass Reduction 1.5 percent 
(MS1) represents a 1.5 percent weight 
decrease through material substitution 
applicable to all vehicle subclasses, 
regardless of curb weight, that can be 
applied throughout the rulemaking 
period (and at refresh or redesign cycle 
times). This technology is similar to the 
MS1 technology used in the prior 
analysis in terms of the scale of the 
weight reduction (1 versus 1.5 percent), 
the methods and techniques 
manufacturers are anticipated to use in 
achieving the reductions, and when in 
the product cycle the model applies it 
(at refresh or redesign). 
A second technology, Mass Reduction 
3.5–8.5 percent (MS2), has also been 
defined. The MS2 technology is 
unavailable until MY 2014, and can 
only be applied by the Volpe model at 
a product redesign cycle. MS2 assumes 
a 3.5 to 8.5 percent weight reduction 
dependent on subclass (with the 
smaller/lighter subclasses receiving the 
lowest amounts of reduction, 3.5 
percent, and the larger/heavier vehicles 
the 8.5 percent) via the types of more 
intrusive and complex mass reduction 
associated with a complete vehicle 
redesign.467 MS2 is cumulative to MS1, 
as it is only applied after MS1, therefore 
the maximum weight reduction that can 
occur for smaller subclass vehicles is 5 
percent, while large cars, truck, and 
SUVs could experience 10 percent 
weight reductions. Restricting weight 
reduction on smaller vehicle to lower 
limits, and vice versa for larger vehicles, 
is intended to mitigate or minimize the 
potential safety consequences from the 
modeled weight reductions. Postponing 
the availability of the technology until 
MY 2014 recognizes the lead time 
required to implement platform 
redesigns that would be necessary for 
these levels of weight reduction and 
mass reduction. NHTSA seeks comment 
on the agency’s use of a two-step 
process, with the higher applications of 
MS in MYs 2014 and beyond, and the 
process of applying smaller mass 
reductions to lighter vehicles and higher 
reductions to heavier vehicles for the 
purpose of maintaining safety 
neutrality. 
The MS5 technology used in the MY 
2011 final rule is deleted. 
Additionally, for purposes of this 
NPRM, NHTSA has revised the 
applicability of the diesel technologies 
to restrict it to vehicles with engines of 
6 cylinders or more. NHTSA seeks 
comment on its decision not to apply 
diesel technologies to vehicles with 4- 
cylinder engines. NHTSA also seeks 
comment on the revised costing 
methodology for diesel technologies. 
Besides these, all other technologies 
considered in this analysis were also 
considered in the analysis for the MY 
2011 final rule, and although the costs 
and effectiveness estimates may have 
been revised as discussed further below, 
the other technologies remain otherwise 
unchanged for the purposes of this 
analysis in terms of their definition, 
functionality, and configuration. Thus, 
with this catalog of technologies as a 
starting point, NHTSA could then 
review and consider effectiveness and 
cost estimates for each technology, and, 
through the Volpe model analysis, how 
a manufacturer might feasibly apply 
these technologies to their MY 2012– 
2016 vehicles in order to achieve 
compliance with the proposed 
standards. 
b. How Did NHTSA Determine the Costs 
and Effectiveness of Each of These 
Technologies for Use in Its Modeling 
Analysis? 
Building on NHTSA’s estimates 
developed for the MY 2011 CAFE final 
rule and EPA’s Advanced Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking, which relied on 
the 2008 Staff Technical Report,468 the 
agencies took a fresh look at technology 
cost and effectiveness values for 
purposes of the joint proposal under the 
National Program. This joint work is 
reflected in Chapter 3 of the Draft Joint 
TSD and in Section II of this preamble, 
which is summarized below. For more 
detailed information on the 
effectiveness and cost of fuel-saving 
technologies, please refer to Chapter 3 of 
the joint TSD and Section V of NHTSA’s 
PRIA. 
Generally speaking, while NHTSA 
and EPA found that much of the cost 
information used in NHTSA’s MY 2011 
final rule and EPA’s 2008 staff report 
was consistent to a great extent, the 
agencies, in reconsidering information 
from many sources, revised several 
component costs of several major 
technologies: turbocharging/ 
downsizing, mild and strong hybrids, 
diesels, SGDI, and Valve Train Lift 
Technologies. These are discussed at 
length in the joint TSD and in NHTSA’s 
PRIA. Additionally, most effectiveness 
estimates used in both the MY 2011 
final rule and the 2008 EPA staff report 
were determined to be accurate and 
were carried forward without significant 
change into this rulemaking. When 
NHTSA and EPA’s estimates for 
effectiveness diverged slightly due to 
differences in how agencies apply 
technologies to vehicles in their 
respective models, we report the ranges 
for the effectiveness values used in each 
model. For much more information on 
the costs and effectiveness of individual 
technologies, we refer the reader to 
Chapter 3 of the joint TSD and Section 
V of NHTSA’s PRIA. 
NHTSA notes that, in developing 
technology cost and effectiveness 
estimates, the agencies have made every 
effort to hold constant aspects of vehicle 
performance and utility typically valued 
by consumers, such as horsepower, 
carrying capacity, and towing and 
hauling capacity. For example, NHTSA 
includes in its analysis technology cost 
and effectiveness estimates that are 
specific to performance passenger cars 
(i.e., sports cars), as compared to non- 
performance passenger cars. When

commenting on the agencies’ technology 
cost and effectiveness estimates, 
NHTSA urges commenters either to 
place any related comments within the 
same context, or explain any 
assumptions or estimates regarding 
increases or decreases in vehicle 
performance or utility. Additionally, 
NHTSA seeks comment on the extent to 
which commenters believe that the 
agencies have been successful in 
holding constant these elements of 
vehicle performance and utility in 
developing the technology cost and 
effectiveness estimates. 
Additionally, NHTSA notes that the 
technology costs included in this NPRM 
take into account only those associated 
with the initial build of the vehicle. The 
agencies seek comments on the 
additional lifetime costs, if any, 
associated with the implementation of 
advanced technologies, including 
warranty, maintenance and replacement 
costs, such as the replacement costs for 
low rolling resistance tires, low friction 
lubricants, and hybrid batteries, and 
maintenance costs for diesel 
aftertreatment components. 
While the agencies believe that the 
ideal estimates for the final rule would 
be based on tear down studies or BOM 
approach and subjected to a transparent 
peer-reviewed process, NHTSA and 
EPA are confident that the thorough 
review conducted, led to the best 
available conclusion regarding 
technology costs and effectiveness 
estimates for the current rulemaking and 
resulted in excellent consistency 
between the agencies’ respective 
analyses for developing the CAFE and 
CO2 standards. 
NHTSA seeks comment on the 
incremental cost and effectiveness 
estimates employed by the agency in the 
Volpe modeling analysis for this NPRM, 
examples of which are provided in table 
form below. These example Tables 
present effectiveness and cost estimates 
which are incremental in nature, 
according to the decision trees used in 
the Volpe modeling analysis. Thus, the 
effectiveness and cost estimates are not 
absolute to a single baseline vehicle, but 
are incremental to the technology that 
precedes it.

c. How Does NHTSA Use These 
Assumptions in Its Modeling Analysis? 
NHTSA’s analysis, using the Volpe 
model, relies on several inputs and data 
files to conduct the compliance 
analysis, as discussed further below and 
in Section V of the PRIA. For the 
purposes of applying technologies, the 
Volpe model primarily uses three data 
files, one that contains data on the 
vehicles expected to be manufactured in 
the model years covered by the 
rulemaking, one that identifies the 
appropriate stage within the vehicle’s 
life-cycle for the technology to be 
applied, and one that contains data/ 
parameters regarding the available 
technologies the model can apply. 
These inputs are discussed below. 
As discussed above, the Volpe model 
begins with an initial state of the 
domestic vehicle market, which in this 
case is the market for passenger cars and 
light trucks to be sold during the period 
covered by the proposed standards. The

469 The market file for the MY 2011 final rule, 
which included data for MYs 2011–2015, had 5500 
records, or rows, about 5 times what we are using 
in this analysis of the MY 2008 certification data. 
However, both market files had the same number 
of fields, or rows. 
470 Because CAFE standards apply to the average 
performance of each manufacturer’s fleet of cars 
and light trucks, the impact of potential standards 
on individual manufacturers cannot be credibly 
estimated without analysis of fleets manufacturers 
can be expected to produce in the future. 
Furthermore, because required CAFE levels under 
an attribute-based CAFE standard depend on 
manufacturers’ fleet composition, the stringency of 
an attribute-based standard cannot be predicted 
without performing analysis at this level of detail. 
471 For example, applying material substitution 
through weight reduction, or even something as 
simple as low rolling-resistance tires, to a vehicle 
will likely require some level of validation and 
testing to ensure that the vehicle may continue to 
be certified as compliant with NHTSA’s Federal 
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Weight 
reduction might affect a vehicle’s crashworthiness; 
low rolling-resistance tires might change vehicle’s 
braking characteristics or how it performs in crash 
avoidance tests. 
vehicle market is defined on a model- 
by-model, engine-by-engine, and 
transmission-by-transmission basis, 
such that each defined vehicle model 
refers to a separately defined engine and 
a separately defined transmission. 
For the current proposal, which 
covers MYs 2012–2016, the light vehicle 
(passenger car and light truck) market 
forecast was developed jointly by 
NHTSA and EPA staff using MY 2008 
CAFE compliance data. The MY 2008 
compliance data includes about 1,100 
vehicle models, about 400 specific 
engines, and about 200 specific 
transmissions, which is a somewhat 
lower level of detail in the 
representation of the vehicle market 
than that used by NHTSA in recent 
CAFE analyses.469 However, within the 
limitations of information that can be 
made available to the public, it provides 
the foundation for a realistic analysis of 
manufacturer-specific costs and the 
analysis of attribute-based CAFE 
standards, and is much greater than the 
level of detail used by many other 
models and analyses relevant to light 
vehicle fuel economy.470 
In addition to containing data about 
each vehicle, engine, and transmission, 
this file contains information for each 
technology under consideration as it 
pertains to the specific vehicle (whether 
the vehicle is equipped with it or not), 
the model year the vehicle is 
undergoing redesign, and information 
about the vehicle’s subclass for 
purposes of technology application. In 
essence, the model considers whether it 
is appropriate to apply a technology to 
a vehicle. 
Is a vehicle already equipped, or can 
it not be equipped, with a particular 
technology? 
The market forecast file provides 
NHTSA the ability to identify, on a 
technology by technology basis, which 
technologies may already be present 
(manufactured) on a particular vehicle, 
engine, or transmission, or which 
technologies are not applicable (due to 
technical considerations) to a particular 
vehicle, engine, or transmission. These 
identifications are made on a model-by- 
model, engine-by-engine, and 
transmission-by-transmission basis. For 
example, if the market forecast file 
indicates that Manufacturer X’s Vehicle 
Y is manufactured with Technology Z, 
then for this vehicle Technology Z will 
be shown as used. Additionally, NHTSA 
has determined that some technologies 
are only suitable or unsuitable when 
certain vehicle, engine, or transmission 
conditions exist. For example, 
secondary axle disconnect is only 
suitable for 4WD vehicles, and cylinder 
deactivation is unsuitable for any engine 
with fewer than 6 cylinders, while CVTs 
can only be applied to unibody vehicles. 
Similarly, comments received to the 
2008 NPRM indicated that cylinder 
deactivation could not be applied to 
vehicles equipped with manual 
transmissions, due primarily to 
driveability and NVH concerns. The 
Volpe model employs ‘‘engineering 
constraints’’ to address issues like these, 
which are a programmatic method of 
controlling technology application that 
is independent of other constraints. 
Thus, the market forecast file would 
indicate that the technology in question 
should not be applied to the particular 
vehicle/engine/transmission (i.e., is 
unavailable). Since multiple vehicle 
models may be equipped with an engine 
or transmission, this may affect multiple 
models. In using this aspect of the 
market forecast file, NHTSA ensures the 
Volpe model only applies technologies 
in an appropriate manner, since before 
any application of a technology can 
occur, the model checks the market 
forecast to see if it is either already 
present or unavailable. 
NHTSA seeks comment on whether 
this approach is reasonable and ensures 
that technologies are applied in an 
appropriate manner. 
Is a vehicle being redesigned or 
refreshed? 
Manufacturers typically plan vehicle 
changes to coincide with certain stages 
of a vehicle’s life cycle that are 
appropriate for the change, or in this 
case the technology being applied. In 
the automobile industry there are two 
terms that describe when technology 
changes to vehicles occur: redesign and 
refresh (i.e., freshening). Vehicle 
redesign usually refers to significant 
changes to a vehicle’s appearance, 
shape, dimensions, and powertrain. 
Redesign is traditionally associated with 
the introduction of ‘‘new’’ vehicles into 
the market, often characterized as the 
‘‘next generation’’ of a vehicle, or a new 
platform. Vehicle refresh usually refers 
to less extensive vehicle modifications, 
such as minor changes to a vehicle’s 
appearance, a moderate upgrade to a 
powertrain system, or small changes to 
the vehicle’s feature or safety equipment 
content. Refresh is traditionally 
associated with mid-cycle cosmetic 
changes to a vehicle, within its current 
generation, to make it appear ‘‘fresh.’’ 
Vehicle refresh generally occurs no 
earlier than two years after a vehicle 
redesign, or at least two years before a 
scheduled redesign. For the majority of 
technologies discussed today, 
manufacturers will only be able to apply 
them at a refresh or redesign, because 
their application would be significant 
enough to involve some level of 
engineering, testing, and calibration 
work.471 
Some technologies (e.g., those that 
require significant revision) are nearly 
always applied only when the vehicle is 
expected to be redesigned, like 
turbocharging and engine downsizing, 
or conversion to diesel or hybridization. 
Other technologies, like cylinder 
deactivation, electric power steering, 
and aerodynamic drag reduction can be 
applied either when the vehicle is 
expected to be refreshed or when it is 
expected to be redesigned, while a few 
others, like low friction lubricants, can 
be applied at any time, regardless of 
whether a refresh or redesign event is 
conducted. Accordingly, the model will 
only apply a technology at the particular 
point deemed suitable. These 
constraints are intended to produce 
results consistent with manufacturers’ 
technology application practices. For 
each technology under consideration, 
NHTSA stipulates whether it can be 
applied any time, at refresh/redesign, or 
only at redesign. The data forms another 
input to the Volpe model. NHTSA 
develops redesign and refresh schedules 
for each of a manufacturer’s vehicles 
included in the analysis, essentially 
based on the last known redesign year 
for each vehicle and projected forward 
in a 5-year redesign and a 2–3 year 
refresh cycle, and this data is also stored 
in the market forecast file. We note that 
this approach is different than NHTSA 
has employed previously for 
determining redesign and refresh 
schedules, where NHTSA included the 
redesign and refresh dates in the market 
forecast file as provided by 
manufacturers in confidential product 
plans. The new approach is necessary

given the nature of the new baseline 
which as a single year of data does not 
contain its own refresh and redesign 
cycle cues for future model years, and 
to ensure the complete transparency of 
the agency’s analysis. Vehicle redesign/ 
refresh assumptions are discussed in 
more detail in Section V of the PRIA 
and in Chapter 3 of the TSD. NHTSA 
seeks comment on its application for 
this proposal of refresh and redesign 
schedules to manufacturers’ vehicles 
counting from the last known redesign 
in or prior to the baseline fleet, as 
compared to its approach in the MY 
2011 final rule. 
Once the model has concluded that a 
technology should be applied to a 
vehicle, the model must evaluate which 
technology should be applied. This will 
depend on the vehicle subclass to which 
the vehicle is assigned; what 
technologies have already been applied 
to the vehicle (i.e., where in the 
‘‘decision tree’’ the vehicle is); when the 
technology is first available (i.e., year of 
availability); whether the technology is 
still available (i.e., ‘‘phase-in caps’’); and 
the costs and effectiveness of the 
technologies being considered. 
Technology costs may be reduced, in 
turn, by learning effects, while 
technology effectiveness may be 
increased or reduced by synergistic 
effects between technologies. In the 
technology input file, NHTSA has 
developed a separate set of technology 
data variables for each of the twelve 
vehicle subclasses. Each set of variables 
is referred to as an ‘‘input sheet,’’ so for 
example, the subcompact input sheet 
holds the technology data that is 
appropriate for the subcompact 
subclass. Each input sheet contains a 
list of technologies available for 
members of the particular vehicle 
subclass. The following items are 
provided for each technology: the name 
of the technology, its abbreviation, the 
decision tree with which it is 
associated, the (first) year in which it is 
available, the upper and lower cost and 
effectiveness (fuel consumption 
reduction) estimates, the learning type 
and rate, the cost basis, its applicability, 
and the phase-in values. 
To which vehicle subclass is the 
vehicle assigned? 
As part of its consideration of 
technological feasibility, the agency 
evaluates whether each technology 
could be implemented on all types and 
sizes of vehicles, and whether some 
differentiation is necessary in applying 
certain technologies to certain types and 
sizes of vehicles, and with respect to the 
cost incurred and fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions reduction achieved when 
doing so. The 2002 NAS Report 
differentiated technology application 
using ten vehicle ‘‘classes’’ (4 cars 
classes and 6 truck classes),472 but did 
not determine how cost and 
effectiveness values differ from class to 
class. NAS’s purpose in separating 
vehicles into these classes was to create 
groups of ‘‘like’’ vehicles, i.e., vehicles 
similar in size, powertrain 
configuration, weight, and consumer 
use, and for which similar technologies 
are applicable. NHTSA similarly 
differentiates vehicles by ‘‘subclass’’ for 
the purpose of applying technologies to 
vehicles and assessing their incremental 
costs and effectiveness. NHTSA assigns 
each vehicle manufactured in the 
rulemaking period to one of 12 
subclasses: for passenger cars, 
Subcompact, Subcompact Performance, 
Compact, Compact Performance, 
Midsize, Midsize Performance, Large, 
and Large Performance; and for light 
trucks, Small SUV/Pickup/Van, Midsize 
SUV/Pickup/Van, Large SUV/Pickup/ 
Van, and Minivan. 
For this NPRM as for the MY 2011 
final rule, NHTSA divides the vehicle 
fleet into subclasses based on model 
inputs, and applies subclass-specific 
estimates, also from model inputs, of the 
applicability, cost, and effectiveness of 
each fuel-saving technology. Therefore, 
the model’s estimates of the cost to 
improve the fuel economy of each 
vehicle model depend upon the 
subclass to which the vehicle model is 
assigned. 
Each vehicle’s subclass is stored in 
the market forecast file. When 
conducting a compliance analysis, if the 
Volpe model seeks to apply technology 
to a particular vehicle, it checks the 
market forecast to see if the technology 
is available and if the refresh/redesign 
criteria are met. If these conditions are 
satisfied, the model determines the 
vehicle’s subclass from the market data 
file, which it then uses to reference 
another input called the technology 
input file. NHTSA reviewed its 
methodology for dividing vehicles into 
subclasses for purposes of technology 
application that it used in the MY 2011 
final rule, and concluded that the same 
methodology would be appropriate for 
this NPRM for MYs 2012–2016, but the 
agency invites comments on the method 
of assigning vehicles to subclasses for 
the purposes of technology application 
in the CAFE model, and on the issue of 
technology-application subclasses 
generally. The subclasses and the 
methodology for dividing vehicles 
among them are discussed in more 
detail in Section V of the PRIA and in 
Chapter 3 of the TSD. 
For the reader’s reference, the 
subclasses and example vehicles from 
the market forecast file are provided in 
the tables below.

What technologies have already been 
applied to the vehicle (i.e., where in the 
‘‘decision trees’’ is it)? 
NHTSA’s methodology for technology 
application analysis developed out of 
the approach taken by NAS in the 2002 
Report, and evaluates the application of 
individual technologies and their 
incremental costs and effectiveness. 
Incremental costs and effectiveness of 
individual technologies are relative to 
the prior technology state, which means 
that it is crucial to understand what 
technologies are already present on a 
vehicle in order to determine correct 
incremental cost and effectiveness 
values. The benefit of the incremental 
approach is transparency in accounting, 
insofar as when individual technologies 
are added incrementally to individual 
vehicles, it is clear and easy to 
determine how costs and effectiveness 
adds up as technology levels increase. 
To keep track of incremental costs 
and effectiveness and to know which 
technology to apply and in which order, 
the Volpe model’s architecture uses a 
logical sequence, which NHTSA refers 
to as ‘‘decision trees,’’ for applying fuel 
economy-improving technologies to 
individual vehicles. In the MY 2011 
final rule, NHTSA worked with Ricardo 
to modify previously-employed decision 
trees in order to allow for a much more 
accurate application of technologies to 
vehicles. For purposes of the NPRM, 
NHTSA reviewed the technology 
sequencing architecture and updated, as 
appropriate, the decision trees used in 
the analysis reported in the final rule for 
MY 2011. 
In general, and as described in great 
detail in the MY 2011 final rule and in 
Section V of the current PRIA, each 
technology is assigned to one of the five 
following categories based on the 
system it affects or impacts: engine, 
transmission, electrification/accessory, 
hybrid or vehicle. Each of these 
categories has its own decision tree that 
the Volpe model uses to apply 
technologies sequentially during the 
compliance analysis. The decision trees 
were designed and configured to allow 
the Volpe model to apply technologies 
in a cost-effective, logical order that also 
considers ease of implementation. For 
example, software or control logic 
changes are implemented before 
replacing a component or system with a 
completely redesigned one, which is 
typically a much more expensive 
option. In some cases, and as 
appropriate, the model may combine the 
sequential technologies shown on a 
decision tree and apply them 
simultaneously, effectively developing 
dynamic technology packages on an as- 
needed basis. For example, if 
compliance demands indicate, the 
model may elect to apply LUB, EFR, and 
ICP on a dual overhead cam engine, if 
they are not already present, in one 
single step. An example simplified 
decision tree for engine technologies is 
provided below; the other simplified 
decision trees may be found in Chapter 
3 of the joint TSD and in the PRIA. 
Expanded decision trees are available in 
the docket for this NPRM.

BILLING CODE 6560–50–C 
Each technology within the decision 
trees has an incremental cost and an 
incremental effectiveness estimate 
associated with it, and estimates are 
specific to a particular vehicle subclass 
(see the tables in Section V of the PRIA). 
Each technology’s incremental estimate 
takes into account its position in the 
decision tree path. If a technology is 
located further down the decision tree, 
the estimates for the costs and 
effectiveness values attributed to that 
technology are influenced by the 
incremental estimates of costs and 
effectiveness values for prior technology 
applications. In essence, this approach 
accounts for ‘‘in-path’’ effectiveness 
synergies, as well as cost effects that 
occur between the technologies in the 
same path. When comparing cost and 
effectiveness estimates from various 
sources and those provided by 
commenters in the previous CAFE

473 See, e.g., 74 FR 14238–46 (Mar. 30, 2009) for 
a full discussion of the decision trees in NHTSA’s 
MY 2011 final rule, and Docket No. NHTSA–2009– 
0062–0003.1 for an expanded decision tree used in 
that rulemaking. 
474 While phase-in caps are expressed as specific 
percentages of a manufacturer’s fleet to which a 
technology may be applied in a given model year, 
phase-in caps cannot always be applied as precise 
limits, and the Volpe model in fact allows 
‘‘override’’ of a cap in certain circumstances. When 
only a small portion of a phase-in cap limit 
remains, or when the cap is set to a very low value, 
or when a manufacturer has a very limited product 
line, the cap might prevent the technology from 
being applied at all since any application would 
cause the cap to be exceeded. Therefore, the Volpe 
model evaluates and enforces each phase-in cap 
constraint after it has been exceeded by the 
application of the technology (as opposed to 
evaluating it before application), which can result 
in the described overriding of the cap. 
475 74 FR 14268–14271 (Mar. 30, 2009). 
476 See 74 FR 14270 (Mar 30, 2009) for further 
discussion and examples. 
rulemakings, it is important that the 
estimates evaluated are analyzed in the 
proper context, especially as concerns 
their likely position in the decision trees 
and other technologies that may be 
present or missing. Not all estimates 
available in the public domain or 
offered for the agencies’ consideration 
during the comment period can be 
evaluated in an ‘‘apples-to-apples’’ 
comparison with those used by the 
Volpe model, since in some cases the 
order of application, or included 
technology content, is inconsistent with 
that assumed in the decision tree. 
The MY 2011 final rule discussed in 
detail the revisions and improvements 
made to the Volpe model and decision 
trees during that rulemaking process, 
including the improved handling and 
accuracy of valve train technology 
application and the development and 
implementation of a method for 
accounting path-dependent correction 
factors in order to ensure that 
technologies are evaluated within the 
proper context. The reader should 
consult the MY 2011 final rule 
documents for further information on 
these modeling techniques, all of which 
continued to be utilized in developing 
this proposal.473 To the extent that the 
decision trees have changed for 
purposes of this NPRM, it was due not 
to revisions in the order of technology 
application, but rather to redefinitions 
of technologies or addition or 
subtraction of technologies. NHTSA 
seeks comment on the decision trees 
described here and in the PRIA. 
Is the next technology available in 
this model year? 
As discussed above, the majority of 
technologies considered are available on 
vehicles today, and thus will be 
available for application in the 
rulemaking time frame. Some 
technologies, however, will not become 
available for purposes of NHTSA’s 
analysis until later in the rulemaking 
time frame. When the model is 
considering whether to add a 
technology to a vehicle, it checks its 
year of availability—if the technology is 
available, it may be added; if it is not 
available, the model will consider 
whether to switch to a different decision 
tree to look for another technology, or 
will skip to the next vehicle in a 
manufacturer’s fleet. The year of 
availability for each technology is 
provided above in Table IV.C.2–1. 
Has the technology reached the 
phase-in cap for this model year? 
Besides the refresh/redesign cycles 
used in the Volpe model, which 
constrain the rate of technology 
application at the vehicle level so as to 
ensure a period of stability following 
any modeled technology applications, 
the other constraint on technology 
application employed in NHTSA’s 
analysis is ‘‘phase-in caps.’’ Unlike 
vehicle-level cycle settings, phase-in 
caps constrain technology application at 
the vehicle manufacturer level.474 They 
are intended to reflect a manufacturer’s 
overall resource capacity available for 
implementing new technologies (such 
as engineering and development 
personnel and financial resources), 
thereby ensuring that resource capacity 
is accounted for in the modeling 
process. At a high level, phase-in caps 
and refresh/redesign cycles work in 
conjunction with one another to avoid 
the modeling process out-pacing an 
OEM’s limited pool of available 
resources during the rulemaking time 
frame, especially in years where many 
models may be scheduled for refresh or 
redesign. This helps to ensure 
technological feasibility and economic 
practicability in determining the 
stringency of the standards. 
NHTSA has been developing the 
concept of phase-in caps over the course 
of the last several CAFE rulemakings, as 
discussed in greater detail in the MY 
2011 final rule,475 and in Section V of 
the PRIA and Chapter 3 of the joint TSD. 
The MY 2011 final rule employed non- 
linear phase-in caps (that is, caps that 
varied from year to year) that were 
designed to respond to comments 
raising lead-time concerns in reference 
to the agency’s proposed MY 2011–2015 
standards, but because the final rule 
covered only one model year, many 
phase-in caps for that model year were 
lower than had originally been 
proposed. NHTSA emphasized that the 
MY 2011 phase-in caps were based on 
assumptions for the full five year period 
of the proposal (2011–2015), and stated 
that it would reconsider the phase-in 
settings for all years beyond 2011 in a 
future rulemaking analysis. 
For purposes of the current proposal 
for MYs 2012–2016, as in the MY 2011 
final rule, NHTSA combines phase-in 
caps for some groups of similar 
technologies, such as valve phasing 
technologies that are applicable to 
different forms of engine design (SOHC, 
DOHC, OHV), since they are very 
similar from an engineering and 
implementation standpoint. When the 
phase-in caps for two technologies are 
combined, the maximum total 
application of either or both to any 
manufacturer’s fleet is limited to the 
value of the cap.476 In contrast to the 
phase-in caps used in the MY 2011 final 
rule, NHTSA has increased the phase-in 
caps for most of the technologies, as 
discussed below. 
In developing phase-in cap values for 
purposes of the current proposal, 
NHTSA initially considered the fact that 
many of the technologies commonly 
applied by the model, those placed near 
the top of the decision trees, such as low 
friction lubes, valve phasing, electric 
power steering, improved automatic 
transmission controls, and others, have 
been commonly available to 
manufacturers for several years now. 
Many technologies, in fact, precede the 
2002 NAS Report, which estimated that 
such technologies would take 4 to 8 
years to penetrate the fleet. Since the 
current proposal would take effect in 
MY 2012, nearly 10 years beyond the 
NAS report, and extends to MY 2016, 
and in the interest of harmonization 
with EPA’s proposal, NHTSA 
tentatively determined that higher 
phase-in caps were likely justified. 
Additionally, NHTSA considered the 
fact that manufacturers, as part of the 
agreements supporting the National 
Program, appear to be anticipating 
higher technology application rates than 
those used in the MY 2011 final rule. 
This also supported higher phase-in 
caps for purposes of the proposal. 
Thus, while phase-in caps for the MY 
2011 final rule reached a maximum of 
50 percent for a couple of technologies 
and generally fell in the range between 
0 and 20 percent, phase-in caps for this 
NPRM for the majority of technologies 
are set to reach 85 or 100 percent by MY 
2016, although more advanced 
technologies like diesels and strong 
hybrids reach only 15 percent by MY 
2016. 
Theoretically, significantly higher 
phase-in caps, such as those used in the 
current proposal as compared to those 
used in the MY 2011 final rule, should

477 The modeling output for the analysis 
underlying these proposed standards is available on 
NHTSA’s Web site. 
478 The baseline fleet sets the starting point, from 
a technology point of view, for where the model 
begins the technology application process, so 
changes have a direct impact on the net application 
of technology. 
479 NHTSA will conduct a sensitivity analysis on 
the volume-based learning value of 20 percent for 
the final rule. 
result in higher levels of technology 
penetration in the modeling results. 
Reviewing the modeling output does 
not, however, indicate unreasonable 
levels of technology penetration for the 
proposed standards.477 NHTSA believes 
that this is due to the interaction of the 
various changes in methodology for the 
current proposal—changes to phase-in 
caps are but one of a number of 
revisions to the Volpe model and its 
inputs that could potentially impact the 
rate at which technologies are applied 
in this proposal as compared to prior 
rulemakings. Other revisions that could 
impact application rates include the use 
of transparent CAFE certification data in 
baseline fleet formulation and the use of 
other data for projecting it forward,478 or 
the use of a multi-year planning 
programming technique to apply 
technology retroactively to earlier-MY 
vehicles, both of which may have a 
direct impact on the modeling process. 
Conversely the model and inputs 
remain unchanged in other areas that 
also could impact technology 
application, such as in the refresh/ 
redesign cycle settings, estimates used 
for the technologies, both of which 
remain largely unchanged from the MY 
2011 final rule. These changes together 
make it difficult to predict how phase- 
in caps should be expected to function 
in the new modeling process. 
Thus, after reviewing the output files, 
NHTSA tentatively concludes that the 
higher phase-in caps, and the resulting 
technology application rates produced 
by the Volpe model, at both the industry 
and manufacturer level, are appropriate 
for this proposal, achieving a suitable 
level of stringency without requiring 
unrealistic or unachievable penetration 
rates. However, the agency will consider 
comments received on this approach in 
determining what phase-in caps to 
employ in the analysis for the final rule, 
and may change the caps in response to 
comments and/or further analysis. One 
additional question the agency has, 
which may be primarily academic at 
this point, is what impact lower phase- 
in caps, such as those used in earlier 
rulemakings, would have on compliance 
costs (and whether they might counter- 
intuitively increase costs by forcing 
more expensive technologies). NHTSA 
seeks comment on the revised phase-in 
caps as compared to the MY 2011 final 
rule, and particularly on whether, 
combined with the refresh and redesign 
assumptions, they help to ensure 
sufficient lead time for manufacturers to 
make the technology changes required 
by the proposed standards. Readers are 
invited to review and assess the phase- 
in caps listed and described more fully 
in Section V of the PRIA, along with the 
application and penetration rates found 
in the Volpe model’s output files, and 
after making their own assessment, 
provide comment and recommendations 
to the agency as appropriate. 
Is the technology less expensive due 
to learning effects? 
Historically, NHTSA did not 
explicitly account for the cost 
reductions a manufacturer might realize 
through learning achieved from 
experience in actually applying a 
technology. Since working with EPA to 
develop the 2008 NPRM for MYs 2011– 
2015, and with Ricardo to refine the 
concept for the March 2009 MY 2011 
final rule, NHTSA has accounted for 
these cost reductions through two kinds 
of mutually exclusive learning, 
‘‘volume-based’’ and ‘‘time-based’’ 
which it continues to use in this 
proposal, as discussed below. 
In the 2008 NPRM, NHTSA applied 
learning factors to technology costs for 
the first time. These learning factors 
were developed using the parameters of 
learning threshold, learning rate, and 
the initial cost, and were based on the 
‘‘experience curve’’ concept which 
describes reductions in production costs 
as a function of accumulated production 
volume. The typical curve shows a 
relatively steep initial decline in cost 
which flattens out to a gentle 
downwardly sloping line as the volume 
increase to large values. In the NPRM, 
NHTSA applied a learning rate discount 
of 20 percent for each successive 
doubling of production volume (on a 
per manufacturer basis), and a learning 
threshold of 25,000 units was assumed 
(thus a technology was viewed as being 
fully learned out at 100,000 units). The 
factor was only applied to certain 
technologies that were considered 
emerging or newly implemented on the 
basis that significant cost improvements 
would be achieved as economies of 
scale were realized (i.e., the 
technologies were on the steep part of 
the curve). 
In the MY 2011 final rule, NHTSA 
continued to use this learning factor, 
referring to it as volume-based learning 
since the cost reductions were 
determined by production volume 
increases, and again only applied it to 
emerging technologies. However, and in 
response to comments, NHTSA revised 
its assumptions on learning threshold, 
basing them instead on an industry- 
wide production basis, and increasing 
the threshold to 300,000 units annually. 
Commenters to the 2008 NPRM also 
described another type of learning factor 
which NHTSA decided to adopt and 
implement in the MY 2011 final rule. 
Commenters described a relatively small 
negotiated cost decrease that occurred 
on an annual basis through contractual 
agreements with first tier component 
and systems suppliers for readily 
available, high volume technologies 
commonly in use by multiple OEMs. 
Based on the same experience curve 
principal, however at production 
volumes that were on the flatter part of 
the curve (and thus the types of volumes 
that represent annual industry 
volumes), NHTSA adopted this type 
learning and referred to it as time-based 
learning. An annual cost reduction of 3 
percent in the second and each 
subsequent year, which was consistent 
with estimates from commenters and 
supported by work Ricardo conducted 
for NHTSA, was used in the final rule. 
In developing this proposal, NHTSA 
and EPA have reviewed both types of 
learning factors, and the thresholds 
(300,000) and reduction rates (20 
percent for volume,479 3 percent for 
time-based) they rely on, and as 
implemented in the MY 2011 final rule, 
and agreed that both factors continue to 
be accurate and appropriate; each 
agency has thus implemented time- and 
volume-based learning in their analyses. 
Noting that only one type of learning 
can be applied to any single technology, 
if any learning is applied at all, the 
agencies reviewed each to determine 
which learning factor was appropriate. 
Volume-based learning is applied to the 
higher complexity hybrid technologies, 
while no learning is applied to 
technologies likely to be affected by 
commodity costs (LUB, ROLL) or that 
have loosely-defined BOMs (EFR, LDB), 
as was the case in the MY 2011 final 
rule. Chapter 3 of the joint TSD shows 
the specific learning factors that NHTSA 
has applied in this analysis for each 
technology, and discusses learning 
factors and each agencies’ use of them 
further. NHTSA seeks comment on its 
use of learning factors, including the 
types, the thresholds, and the reduction 
rates proposed, and particularly on the 
revisions to the learning (time- and 
volume-based) logic as compared to the 
MY 2011 final rule. 
Is the technology more or less 
effective due to synergistic effects? 
When two or more technologies are 
added to a particular vehicle model to

480 More specifically, the products of the 
differences between one and the technology- 
specific levels of effectiveness in reducing fuel 
consumption. For example, not accounting for 
interactions, if technologies A and B are estimated 
to reduce fuel consumption by 10% (i.e., 0.1) and 
20% (i.e., 0.2) respectively, the ‘‘product of the 
individual effectiveness values’’ would be 1–0.1 
times 1–0.2, or 0.9 times 0.8, which equals 0.72, 
corresponding to a combined effectiveness of 28% 
rather than the 30% obtained by adding 10% to 
20%. The ‘‘synergy factors’’ discussed in this 
section further adjust these multiplicatively 
combined effectiveness values.

Reduce Light-duty Vehicle Carbon Dioxide

improve its fuel efficiency and reduce 
CO2 emissions, the resultant fuel 
consumption reduction may sometimes 
be higher or lower than the product of 
the individual effectiveness values for 
those items.480 This may occur because 
one or more technologies applied to the 
same vehicle partially address the same 
source (or sources) of engine, drivetrain 
or vehicle losses. Alternately, this effect 
may be seen when one technology shifts 
the engine operating points, and 
therefore increases or reduces the fuel 
consumption reduction achieved by 
another technology or set of 
technologies. The difference between 
the observed fuel consumption 
reduction associated with a set of 
technologies and the product of the 
individual effectiveness values in that 
set is referred to for purposes of this 
rulemaking as a ‘‘synergy.’’ Synergies 
may be positive (increased fuel 
consumption reduction compared to the 
product of the individual effects) or 
negative (decreased fuel consumption 
reduction). An example of a positive 
synergy might be a vehicle technology 
that reduces road loads at highway 
speeds (e.g., lower aerodynamic drag or 
low rolling resistance tires), that could 
extend the vehicle operating range over 
which cylinder deactivation may be 
employed. An example of a negative 
synergy might be a variable valvetrain 
system technology, which reduces 
pumping losses by altering the profile of 
the engine speed/load map, and a six- 
speed automatic transmission, which 
shifts the engine operating points to a 
portion of the engine speed/load map 
where pumping losses are less 
significant. As the complexity of the 
technology combinations is increased, 
and the number of interacting 
technologies grows accordingly, it 
becomes increasingly important to 
account for these synergies. 
NHTSA and EPA determined 
synergistic impacts for this rulemaking 
using EPA’s ‘‘lumped parameter’’ 
analysis tool, which EPA described at 
length in its March 2008 Staff Technical 
Report.481 The lumped parameter tool is 
a spreadsheet model that represents 
energy consumption in terms of average 
performance over the fuel economy test 
procedure, rather than explicitly 
analyzing specific drive cycles. The tool 
begins with an apportionment of fuel 
consumption across several loss 
mechanisms and accounts for the 
average extent to which different 
technologies affect these loss 
mechanisms using estimates of engine, 
drivetrain and vehicle characteristics 
that are averaged over the EPA fuel 
economy drive cycle. Results of this 
analysis were generally consistent with 
those of full-scale vehicle simulation 
modeling performed in 2007 by Ricardo, 
Inc. 
For the current rulemaking, NHTSA 
used the lumped parameter tool as 
modified in the MY 2011 CAFE final 
rule. NHTSA modified the lumped 
parameter tool from the version 
described in the EPA Staff Technical 
Report in response to public comments 
received in its rulemaking. The 
modifications included updating the list 
of technologies and their associated 
effectiveness values to match the 
updated list of technologies used in the 
final rule. NHTSA also expanded the 
list of synergy pairings based on further 
consideration of the technologies for 
which a competition for losses would be 
expected. These losses are described in 
more detail in Section V of the PRIA. 
NHTSA and EPA incorporate 
synergistic impacts in their analyses in 
slightly different manners. Because 
NHTSA applies technologies 
individually in its modeling analysis, 
NHTSA incorporates synergistic effects 
between pairings of individual 
technologies. The use of discrete 
technology pair incremental synergies is 
similar to that in DOE’s National Energy 
Modeling System (NEMS).482 Inputs to 
the Volpe model incorporate NEMS- 
identified pairs, as well as additional 
pairs from the set of technologies 
considered in the Volpe model. 
NHTSA notes that synergies that 
occur within a decision tree are already 
addressed within the incremental values 
assigned and therefore do not require a 
synergy pair to address. For example, all 
engine technologies take into account 
incremental synergy factors of preceding 
engine technologies, and all 
transmission technologies take into 
account incremental synergy factors of 
preceding transmission technologies. 
These factors are expressed in the fuel 
consumption improvement factors in 
the input files used by the Volpe model. 
For applying incremental synergy 
factors in separate path technologies, 
the Volpe model uses an input table (see 
the tables in Chapter 3 of the TSD and 
in the PRIA) which lists technology 
pairings and incremental synergy factors 
associated with those pairings, most of 
which are between engine technologies 
and transmission/electrification/hybrid 
technologies. When a technology is 
applied to a vehicle by the Volpe model, 
all instances of that technology in the 
incremental synergy table which match 
technologies already applied to the 
vehicle (either pre-existing or 
previously applied by the Volpe model) 
are summed and applied to the fuel 
consumption improvement factor of the 
technology being applied. Synergies for 
the strong hybrid technology fuel 
consumption reductions are included in 
the incremental value for the specific 
hybrid technology block since the 
model applies technologies in the order 
of the most effectiveness for least cost 
and also applies all available 
electrification and transmission 
technologies before applying strong 
hybrid technologies. NHTSA seeks 
comment on whether the synergistic 
effects presented are accurate, and 
whether there are other synergies that 
the agency may have overlooked. 
d. Where Can Readers Find More 
Detailed Information About NHTSA’s 
Technology Analysis? 
Much more detailed information is 
provided in Section V of the PRIA, and 
a discussion of how NHTSA and EPA 
jointly reviewed and updated 
technology assumptions for purposes of 
this NPRM is available in Chapter 3 of 
the TSD. Additionally, all of NHTSA’s 
model input and output files are now 
public and available for the reader’s 
review and consideration. The 
technology input files can be found in 
the docket for this NPRM, Docket No. 
NHTSA–2009–0059, and on NHTSA’s 
Web site. And finally, because much of 
NHTSA’s technology analysis for 
purposes of this NPRM builds on the 
work that was done for the MY 2011 
final rule, we refer readers to that 
document as well for background 
information concerning how NHTSA’s 
methodology for technology application 
analysis has evolved over the past 
several rulemakings, both in response to 
comments and as a result of the agency’s

analysis.483 
3. How Did NHTSA Develop the 
Economic Assumption Inputs? 
NHTSA’s preliminary analysis of 
alternative CAFE standards for the 
model years covered by this proposed 
rulemaking relies on a range of forecast 
variables, economic assumptions, and 
parameter values. This section describes 
the proposed sources of these forecasts, 
the rationale underlying each 
assumption, and the agency’s 
preliminary choices of specific 
parameter values. These proposed 
economic values play a significant role 
in determining the benefits of 
alternative CAFE standards, as they 
have for the last several CAFE 
rulemakings. Under those alternatives 
where standards would be established 
by reference to their costs and benefits, 
these economic values also affect the 
levels of the CAFE standards 
themselves. Some of these variables 
have more important effects on the level 
of CAFE standards and the benefits from 
requiring alternative increases in fuel 
economy than do others. 
In reviewing these variables and the 
agency’s estimates of their values for 
purposes of this NPRM, NHTSA 
reconsidered previous comments it had 
received and reviewed newly available 
literature. As a consequence, the agency 
elected to revise some of its economic 
assumptions and parameter estimates, 
while retaining others. Some of the most 
important changes, which are discussed 
in greater detail below, as well as in 
Chapter 4 of the joint TSD and in 
Chapter VIII of the PRIA, include 
significant revisions to the markup 
factors for technology costs; reducing 
the rebound effect from 15 to 10 
percent; and revising the value of 
reducing CO2 emissions based on recent 
interagency efforts to develop estimates 
of this value for government-wide use. 
For the reader’s reference, Table IV.C.3– 
1 below summarizes the values used to 
calculate the economic benefits from 
each alternative. The agency seeks 
comment on the economic assumptions 
presented in the table and discussed 
below.

a. Costs of Fuel Economy-Improving 
Technologies 
We developed detailed estimates of 
the costs of applying fuel economy- 
improving technologies to vehicle 
models jointly with EPA for use in 
analyzing the impacts of alternative 
standards considered in this 
rulemaking. The estimates were based 
on those reported by the 2002 NAS 
Report analyzing costs for increasing 
fuel economy, but were modified for 
purposes of this analysis as a result of 
extensive consultations among 
engineers from NHTSA, EPA, and the 
Volpe Center. As part of this process, 
the agency also developed varying cost 
estimates for applying certain fuel 
economy technologies to vehicles of 
different sizes and body styles. We may 
adjust these cost estimates based on 
comments received to this NPRM. 
The technology cost estimates used in 
this analysis are intended to represent

484 NHTSA notes that in addition to the 
technology cost analysis employing this ‘‘ICM’’ 
approach, the PRIA contains a sensitivity analysis 
using a technology cost multiplier of 1.5. 
485 See, e.g., Kleit A.N., 1990. ‘‘The Effect of 
Annual Changes in Automobile Fuel Economy 
Standards.’’ Journal of Regulatory Economics 2: 
151–172; Berry, Steven, James Levinsohn, and Ariel 
Pakes, 1995. ‘‘Automobile Prices in Market 
Equilibrium,’’ Econometrica 63(4): 841–940; 
McCarthy, Patrick S., 1996. ‘‘Market Price and 
Income Elasticities of New Vehicle Demands.’’

and Goldberg, Pinelopi K., 1998. ‘‘The Effects of the

US,’’ Journal of Industrial Economics 46(1): 1–33. 486 71 FR 77871 (Dec. 27, 2006). 
manufacturers’ direct costs for high- 
volume production of vehicles with 
these technologies and sufficient 
experience with their application so that 
all remaining cost reductions due to 
‘‘learning curve’’ effects have been fully 
realized. However, NHTSA recognizes 
that manufacturers’ actual costs for 
employing these technologies include 
additional outlays for accompanying 
design or engineering changes to models 
that use them, development and testing 
of prototype versions, recalibrating 
engine operating parameters, and 
integrating the technology with other 
attributes of the vehicle. Manufacturers’ 
indirect costs for employing these 
technologies also include expenses for 
product development and integration, 
modifying assembly processes and 
training assembly workers to install 
them, increased expenses for operation 
and maintaining assembly lines, higher 
initial warranty costs for new 
technologies, any added expenses for 
selling and distributing vehicles that use 
these technologies, and manufacturer 
and dealer profit. In previous CAFE 
rulemakings and in NHTSA’s safety 
rulemakings, the agency has accounted 
for these additional costs by using a 
Retail Price Equivalent (RPE) multiplier 
of 1.5. For purposes of this rulemaking, 
based on recent work by EPA, NHTSA 
has applied indirect cost multipliers 
ranging from 1.11 to 1.64 to the 
estimates of vehicle manufacturers’ 
direct costs for producing or acquiring 
each technology to improve fuel 
economy.484 These multipliers vary 
with the complexity of each technology 
and the time frame over which costs are 
estimated. More complex technologies 
are associated with higher multipliers 
because of the larger increases in 
manufacturers’ indirect costs for 
developing, producing (or procuring), 
and deploying these more complex 
technologies. The appropriate 
multipliers decline over time for 
technologies of all complexity levels, 
since increased familiarity and 
experience with their application is 
assumed to reduce manufacturers’ 
indirect costs for employing them. 
NHTSA seeks comment regarding the 
new indirect cost multiplier approach to 
technology costs estimates. We note 
additionally that this issue will be 
addressed in the upcoming revised NAS 
report. 
b. Potential Opportunity Costs of 
Improved Fuel Economy 
An important concern is whether 
achieving the fuel economy 
improvements required by alternative 
CAFE standards would require 
manufacturers to compromise the 
performance, carrying capacity, safety, 
or comfort of their vehicle models. To 
the extent that it does so, the resulting 
sacrifice in the value of these attributes 
to consumers represents an additional 
cost of achieving the required 
improvements in fuel economy. While 
exact dollar values of these attributes to 
consumers are difficult to infer, 
differences in vehicle purchase prices 
and buyers’ choices among competing 
models that feature different 
combinations of these characteristics 
clearly demonstrate that changing 
vehicle attributes clearly affect the 
utility and economic value that vehicles 
provide to potential buyers.485 
NHTSA and EPA have approached 
this potential problem by developing 
cost estimates for fuel economy- 
improving technologies that include any 
additional manufacturing costs that 
would be necessary to maintain the 
originally planned levels of 
performance, comfort, carrying capacity, 
and safety of any light-duty vehicle 
model to which those technologies are 
applied. In doing so, the agencies 
followed the precedent established by 
the 2002 NAS Report, which estimated 
‘‘constant performance and utility’’ 
costs for fuel economy technologies. 
NHTSA has used these as the basis for 
its continuing efforts to refine the 
technology costs it uses to analyze 
manufacturer’s costs for complying with 
alternative passenger car and light truck 
CAFE standards for MYs 2012–2016. 
Although the agency has revised its 
estimates of manufacturers’ costs for 
some technologies significantly for use 
in this rulemaking, these revised 
estimates are still intended to represent 
costs that would allow manufacturers to 
maintain the performance, carrying 
capacity, and utility of vehicle models 
while improving their fuel economy. 
Although we believe that our tentative 
cost estimates for fuel economy- 
improving technologies should be 
generally sufficient to prevent 
significant reductions in consumer 
welfare provided by vehicle models to 
which manufacturers apply those 
technologies, it is possible that they do 
not include adequate allowance for the 
necessary efforts by manufacturers to 
prevent sacrifices in these attributes on 
all vehicle models. If this is the case, the 
true economic costs of achieving higher 
fuel economy should include the 
opportunity costs to vehicle owners of 
any sacrifices in vehicles’ performance, 
carrying capacity, and utility and the 
agency’s estimated technology costs 
would underestimate the true economic 
costs of improving fuel economy. 
Recognizing this possibility, it may be 
preferable for NHTSA to estimate 
explicitly the changes in vehicle buyers’ 
welfare from the combination of higher 
prices for new vehicle models, increases 
in their fuel economy, and any 
accompanying changes in vehicle 
attributes such as performance, 
passenger- and cargo-carrying capacity, 
or other dimensions of utility. The net 
change in buyer’s welfare that results 
from the combination of these changes 
would provide a more accurate estimate 
of the true economic costs for improving 
fuel economy. The agency seeks 
comment on this or other possible ways 
to deal with this extremely important 
issue. 
c. The On-Road Fuel Economy ‘‘Gap’’ 
Actual fuel economy levels achieved 
by light-duty vehicles in on-road driving 
fall somewhat short of their levels 
measured under the laboratory-like test 
conditions used by EPA to establish its 
published fuel economy ratings for 
different models. In analyzing the fuel 
savings from alternative CAFE 
standards, NHTSA has previously 
adjusted the actual fuel economy 
performance of each light truck model 
downward from its rated value to reflect 
the expected size of this on-road fuel 
economy ‘‘gap.’’ On December 27, 2006, 
EPA adopted changes to its regulations 
on fuel economy labeling, which were 
intended to bring vehicles’ rated fuel 
economy levels closer to their actual on- 
road fuel economy levels.486 
In its Final Rule, EPA estimated that 
actual on-road fuel economy for light- 
duty vehicles averages 20 percent lower 
than published fuel economy levels. For 
example, if the overall EPA fuel 
economy rating of a light truck is 20 
mpg, the on-road fuel economy actually 
achieved by a typical driver of that 
vehicle is expected to be 16 mpg 
(20*.80). NHTSA employed EPA’s 
revised estimate of this on-road fuel 
economy gap in its analysis of the fuel

EIA’s Updated Reference Case reflects the effects of 
the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 
2009, as well as the most recent revisions to the 
U.S. and global economic outlook. 
489 This projection uses the rate of increase in fuel 
prices for 2020–2030 rather than that over the 
complete forecast period (2009–2030) because there 
is extreme volatility in the forecasts for the years 
2009 through approximately 2020. Using the 
average rate of change over the complete 2009–2030 
forecast period would result in projections of 
declining fuel prices after 2030. 
savings resulting from alternative CAFE 
standards evaluated in the MY 2011 
final rule. 
For purposes of this NPRM, NHTSA 
conducted additional analysis of this 
issue. The agency used data on the 
number of passenger cars and light 
trucks of each model year that were 
registered for use during calendar years 
2000 through 2006, average fuel 
economy for passenger cars and light 
trucks produced during each model 
year, and estimates of average miles 
driven per year by cars and light trucks 
of different ages. These data were 
combined to develop estimates of the 
average fuel economy that the U.S. 
passenger car and light truck fleets 
would have achieved from 2000 through 
2006 under test conditions. 
NHTSA compared these estimates to 
the Federal Highway Administration’s 
(FHWA) published values of actual on- 
road fuel economy for passenger cars 
and light trucks during each of those 
years.487 FHWA’s estimates of actual 
fuel economy for passenger cars 
averaged 22 percent lower than 
NHTSA’s estimates of its fleet-wide 
average value under test conditions over 
this period, while FHWA’s estimates for 
light trucks averaged 17 lower than 
NHTSA’s estimates of average light 
truck fuel economy under test 
conditions. These results appear to 
confirm that the 20 percent on-road fuel 
economy discount or gap represents a 
reasonable estimate for use in evaluating 
the fuel savings likely to result from 
alternative CAFE standards for MY 
2012–2016 vehicles. 
d. Fuel Prices and the Value of Saving 
Fuel 
Projected future fuel prices are a 
critical input into the preliminary 
economic analysis of alternative CAFE 
standards, because they determine the 
value of fuel savings both to new 
vehicle buyers and to society. NHTSA 
relied on the most recent fuel price 
projections from the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration’s (EIA) 
Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for this 
analysis. Specifically, we used the AEO 
2009 (April 2009 release) Reference 
Case forecasts of inflation-adjusted 
(constant-dollar) retail gasoline and 
diesel fuel prices, which represent the 
EIA’s most up-to-date estimate of the 
most likely course of future prices for 
petroleum products.488 
While NHTSA relied on the forecasts 
of fuel prices presented in AEO 2008 
High Price Case in the MY 2011 final 
rule, we noted at the time that we were 
relying on that estimate primarily 
because volatility in the oil market 
appeared to have overtaken the 
Reference Case, and that we anticipated 
that the Reference Case forecast would 
be significantly higher in the next AEO. 
In fact, EIA’s AEO 2009 Reference Case 
forecast projects higher retail fuel prices 
in most future years than those forecast 
in the High Price Case from AEO 2008. 
NHTSA is thus confident that the AEO 
2009 Reference Case is an appropriate 
forecast for projected future fuel prices. 
Measured in constant 2007 dollars, 
the Reference Case forecast of retail 
gasoline prices during calendar year 
2020 is $3.62 per gallon, rising 
gradually to $3.82 by the year 2030 
(these values include Federal, State and 
local taxes). To obtain fuel price 
forecasts for the years 2031 through 
2050, the agency assumes that retail fuel 
prices will continue to increase after 
2030 at the average annual rates 
projected for 2020–2030 in the AEO 
2009 Revised Reference Case.489 This 
assumption results in a projected retail 
price of gasoline that reaches $4.25 in 
2007 dollars by the year 2050. 
The value of fuel savings resulting 
from improved fuel economy to buyers 
of light-duty vehicles is determined by 
the retail price of fuel, which includes 
Federal, State, and any local taxes 
imposed on fuel sales. Total taxes on 
gasoline, including Federal, State, and 
local levies averaged $0.42 per gallon 
during 2006, while those levied on 
diesel averaged $0.50. Because fuel 
taxes represent transfers of resources 
from fuel buyers to government 
agencies, however, rather than real 
resources that are consumed in the 
process of supplying or using fuel, their 
value must be deducted from retail fuel 
prices to determine the value of fuel 
savings resulting from more stringent 
CAFE standards to the U.S. economy as 
a whole. 
NHTSA follows the assumptions used 
by EIA in AEO 2009 that State and local 
gasoline taxes will keep pace with 
inflation in nominal terms, and thus 
remain constant when expressed in 
constant 2007 dollars. In contrast, EIA 
assumes that Federal gasoline taxes will 
remain unchanged in nominal terms, 
and thus decline throughout the forecast 
period when expressed in constant 2007 
dollars. These differing assumptions 
about the likely future behavior of 
Federal and State/local fuel taxes are 
consistent with recent historical 
experience, which reflects the fact that 
Federal as well as most State motor fuel 
taxes are specified on a cents-per-gallon 
basis, and typically require legislation to 
change. 
The projected value of total taxes is 
deducted from each future year’s 
forecast of retail gasoline and diesel 
prices reported in AEO 2009 to 
determine the economic value of each 
gallon of fuel saved during that year as 
a result of improved fuel economy. 
Subtracting fuel taxes results in a 
projected value for saving gasoline of 
$3.22 per gallon during 2020, rising to 
$3.45 per gallon by the year 2030. 
EIA includes ‘‘High Price Case’’ and 
‘‘Low Price Case’’ forecasts in each 
AEO, which reflect uncertainties 
regarding future levels of oil production 
and demand. These alternative 
scenarios project retail gasoline prices 
that range from a low of $2.02 to a high 
of $5.04 per gallon during 2020, and 
from $2.04 to $5.47 per gallon during 
2030. In conjunction with our 
assumption that fuel taxes will remain 
constant in real or inflation-adjusted 
terms over this period, these forecasts 
imply pre-tax values of saving fuel 
ranging from $1.63 to $4.65 per gallon 
during 2020, and from $1.67 to $5.10 
per gallon in 2030. In conducting the 
preliminary analysis of uncertainty in 
benefits and costs from alternative 
CAFE standards required by OMB, 
NHTSA evaluated the sensitivity of its 
benefits estimates to these alternative 
forecasts of future fuel prices. The 
results of this sensitivity analysis can be 
found in the PRIA. 
e. Consumer Valuation of Fuel Economy 
and Payback Period 
In estimating the value of fuel 
economy improvements that would 
result from alternative CAFE standards 
to potential vehicle buyers, NHTSA 
assumes, as in the MY 2011 final rule, 
that buyers value the resulting fuel 
savings over only part of the expected 
lifetime of the vehicles they purchase. 
Specifically, we assume that buyers 
value fuel savings over the first five 
years of a new vehicle’s lifetime, and 
discount the value of these future fuel 
savings at a 3 percent annual rate. The 
five-year figure represents

490 Vehicles are defined to be of age 1 during the 
calendar year corresponding to the model year in 
which they are produced; thus for example, model 
year 2000 vehicles are considered to be of age 1 
during calendar year 2000, age 1 during calendar 
year 2001, and to reach their maximum age of 26 
years during calendar year 2025. NHTSA considers 
the maximum lifetime of vehicles to be the age after 
which less than 2 percent of the vehicles originally 
produced during a model year remain in service. 
Applying these conventions to vehicle registration 
data indicates that passenger cars have a maximum 
age of 26 years, while light trucks have a maximum 
lifetime of 36 years. See Lu, S., NHTSA, Regulatory 
Analysis and Evaluation Division, ‘‘Vehicle 
Survivability and Travel Mileage Schedules,’’ DOT 
HS 809 952, 8–11 (January 2006). Available at 
http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809952.pdf 
(last accessed July 27, 2009). 
491 Available at http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/ 
index.html. NHTSA and EPA made the simplifying 
assumption that projected sales of cars and light 
trucks during each calendar year from 2012 through 
2016 represented the likely production volumes for 
the corresponding model year. The agency did not 
attempt to establish the exact correspondence 
between projected sales during individual calendar 
years and production volumes for specific model 
years. 
492 Because AEO 2009’s ‘‘car’’ and ‘‘truck’’ classes 
did not reflect NHTSA’s recent reclassification (in 
March 2009 for enforcement beginning MY 2011) of 
many two wheel drive SUVs from the nonpassenger 
(i.e., light truck) fleet to the passenger car fleet, EPA 
staff made adjustments to account for such vehicles 
in the baseline. 
493 EPA also considered other sources of similar 
information, such as J.D. Powers, and concluded 
that CSM was better able to provide forecasts at the 
requisite level of detail for most of the model years 
of interest. 
494 Lu, S., NHTSA, Regulatory Analysis and 
Evaluation Division, ‘‘Vehicle Survivability and 
Travel Mileage Schedules,’’ DOT HS 809 952, 8–11 
(January 2006). Available at http://www- 
nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809952.pdf (last accessed 
August 9, 2009). These updated survival rates 
suggest that the expected lifetimes of recent-model 
passenger cars and light trucks are 13.8 and 14.5 
years. 
495 For a description of the Survey, see http:// 
nhts.ornl.gov/quickStart.shtml (last accessed

496 This approach differs from that used in the 
MY 2011 final rule, where it was assumed that 
future growth in the total number of cars and light 
trucks in use resulting from projected sales of new 
vehicles was adequate by itself to account for 
growth in total vehicle use, without assuming 
continuing growth in average vehicle use. 
approximately the current average term 
of consumer loans to finance the 
purchase of new vehicles. We recognize 
that the period over which individual 
buyers finance new vehicle purchases 
may not correspond exactly to the time 
horizons they apply in valuing fuel 
savings from higher fuel economy. 
The agency deducts the discounted 
present value of fuel savings over the 
first five years of a vehicle model’s 
lifetime from the technology costs 
incurred by its manufacturer to improve 
that model’s fuel economy to determine 
the increase in its ‘‘effective price’’ to 
buyers. The Volpe model uses these 
estimates of effective costs for 
increasing the fuel economy of each 
vehicle model to identify the order in 
which manufacturers would be likely to 
select models for the application of fuel 
economy-improving technologies in 
order to comply with stricter standards. 
The average value of the resulting 
increase in effective cost from each 
manufacturer’s simulated compliance 
strategy is also used to estimate the 
impact of alternative standards on its 
total sales for future model years. 
However, it is important to recognize 
that NHTSA estimates the aggregate 
value to the U.S. economy of fuel 
savings resulting from alternative 
standards—or their ‘‘social’’ value—over 
the entire expected lifetimes of vehicles 
manufactured under those standards, 
rather than over this shorter ‘‘payback 
period’’ we assume for their buyers. The 
procedure the agency uses for doing so 
is discussed in detail in the following 
section. 
f. Vehicle Survival and Use 
Assumptions 
NHTSA’s first step in estimating 
lifetime fuel consumption by vehicles 
produced during a model year is to 
calculate the number expected to 
remain in service during each year 
following their production and sale.490 
This is calculated by multiplying the 
number of vehicles originally produced 
during a model year by the proportion 
typically expected to remain in service 
at their age during each later year, often 
referred to as a ‘‘survival rate.’’ 
To estimate production volumes of 
passenger cars and light trucks for 
individual manufacturers, NHTSA 
relied on a baseline market forecast 
constructed by EPA staff beginning with 
MY 2008 CAFE certification data. After 
constructing a MY 2008 baseline, EPA 
used projected car and truck volumes 
for this period from Energy Information 
Administration’s (EIA’s) 2009 Annual 
Energy Outlook (AEO).491 However, 
AEO projects sales only at the car and 
truck level, not at the manufacturer and 
model-specific level, which are needed 
in order to estimate the effects new 
standards will have on individual 
manufacturers.492 Therefore, EPA 
purchased data from CSM–Worldwide 
and used their projections of the 
number of vehicles of each type 
predicted to be sold by manufacturers in 
2011–2015.493 This provided the year- 
by-year percentages of cars and trucks 
sold by each manufacturer as well as the 
percentages of each vehicle segment. 
Although it was thus necessary to 
assume the same manufacturer and 
segment shares in 2016 as in 2015, 2016 
estimates from CSM should be available 
for the final rule. Using these 
percentages normalized to the AEO 
projected volumes then provided the 
manufacturer-specific market share and 
model-specific sales for model years 
2011–2016. 
To estimate the number of passenger 
cars and light trucks originally 
produced during model years 2012 
through 2016 that will remain in use 
during each subsequent year the agency 
applied age-specific survival rates for 
cars and light trucks to these adjusted 
forecasts of passenger car and light truck 
sales. In 2008, NHTSA updated its 
previous estimates of car and light truck 
survival rates using the most current 
registration data for vehicles produced 
during recent model years, in order to 
ensure that they reflected recent 
increases in the durability and expected 
life spans of cars and light trucks.494 
The next step in estimating fuel use 
is to calculate the total number of miles 
that model year 2012–2016 cars and 
light trucks remaining in use will be 
driven each year. To estimate total miles 
driven, the number projected to remain 
in use during each future year is 
multiplied by the average number of 
miles they are expected to be driven at 
the age they will reach in that year. The 
agency estimated annual usage of cars 
and light trucks of each age using data 
from the Federal Highway 
Administration’s 2001 National 
Household Transportation Survey 
(NHTS).495 Because these estimates 
reflect the historically low gasoline 
prices that prevailed at the time the 
2001 NHTS was conducted, however, 
NHTSA adjusted them to account for 
the effect on vehicle use of subsequent 
increases in fuel prices. Details of this 
adjustment are provided in Chapter VIII 
of the PRIA and Chapter of the draft 
joint TSD. 
Increases in average annual use of 
cars and light trucks have been an 
important source of historical growth in 
the total number of miles they are 
driven each year. To estimate future 
growth in their average annual use for 
purposes of this rulemaking, NHTSA 
calculated the rate of growth in the 
adjusted mileage schedules derived 
from the 2001 NHTS necessary for total 
car and light truck travel to increase at 
the rate forecast in the AEO 2009 
Reference Case.496 This rate was 
calculated to be consistent with future 
changes in the overall size and age 
distributions of the U.S. passenger car 
and light truck fleets that result from the 
agency’s forecasts of total car and light 
truck sales and updated survival rates. 
The resulting growth rate in average 
annual car and light truck use of 
approximately 1.1 percent per year was

497 While the adjustment for future fuel prices 
reduces average mileage at each age from the values 
derived from the 2001 NHTS, the adjustment for 
expected future growth in average vehicle use 
increases it. The net effect of these two adjustments 
is to increase expected lifetime mileage by about 18 
percent significantly for both passenger cars and 
about 16 percent for light trucks. 
498 To illustrate these calculations, the agency’s 
adjustment of the AEO 2009 Revised Reference Case 
forecast indicates that 9.26 million passenger cars 
will be produced during 2012, and the agency’s 
updated survival rates show that 83 percent of these 
vehicles, or 7.64 million, are projected to remain in 
service during the year 2022, when they will have 
reached an age of 10 years. At that age, passenger 
achieving the fuel economy level they are projected 
to achieve under the Baseline alternative are driven 
an average of about 800 miles, so surviving model 
year 2012 passenger cars will be driven a total of 
82.5 billion miles (= 7.64 million surviving vehicles 
× 10,800 miles per vehicle) during 2022. Summing 
the results of similar calculations for each year of 
their 26-year maximum lifetime, model year 2012 
passenger cars will be driven a total of 1,395 billion 
miles under the Baseline alternative. Under that 
alternative, they are projected to achieve a test fuel 
economy level of 32.4 mpg, which corresponds to 
actual on-road fuel economy of 25.9 mpg (= 32.4 
mpg × 80 percent). Thus their lifetime fuel use 
under the Baseline alternative is projected to be 
53.9 billion gallons (= 1,395 billion miles divided 
by 25.9 miles per gallon). 
499 Some studies estimate that the long-run 
rebound effect is significantly larger than the 
immediate response to increased fuel efficiency. 
Although their estimates of the adjustment period 
required for the rebound effect to reach its long-run 
magnitude vary, this long-run effect is most 
appropriate for evaluating the fuel savings and 
emissions reductions resulting from stricter 
standards that would apply to future model years. 
500 For details of the agency’s analysis, see 
Chapter VIII of the PRIA and Chapter 4 of the draft 
joint TSD accompanying this proposed rule. 
501 The agency used several different model 
specifications and estimation procedures to control 
for the effect of fuel prices on fuel efficiency in 
order to obtain accurate estimates of the rebound 
effect. 
applied to the mileage figures derived 
from the 2001 NHTS to estimate annual 
mileage during each year of the 
expected lifetimes of MY 2012–2016 
cars and light trucks.497 
Finally, the agency estimated total 
fuel consumption by passenger cars and 
light trucks remaining in use each year 
by dividing the total number of miles 
surviving vehicles are driven by the fuel 
economy they are expected to achieve 
under each alternative CAFE standard. 
Each model year’s total lifetime fuel 
consumption is the sum of fuel use by 
the cars or light trucks produced during 
that model year during each year of 
their life spans. In turn, the savings in 
a model year’s lifetime fuel use that will 
result from each alternative CAFE 
standard is the difference between its 
lifetime fuel use at the fuel economy 
level it attains under the Baseline 
alternative, and its lifetime fuel use at 
the higher fuel economy level it is 
projected to achieve under that 
alternative standard.498 
g. Accounting for the Rebound Effect of 
Higher Fuel Economy 
The fuel economy rebound effect 
refers to the fraction of fuel savings 
expected to result from an increase in 
vehicle fuel economy—particularly an 
increase required by the adoption of 
higher CAFE standards—that is offset by 
additional vehicle use. The increase in 
vehicle use occurs because higher fuel 
economy reduces the fuel cost of 
driving, typically the largest single 
component of the monetary cost of 
operating a vehicle, and vehicle owners 
respond to this reduction in operating 
costs by driving slightly more. By 
lowering the marginal cost of vehicle 
use, improved fuel economy may lead to 
an increase in the number of miles 
vehicles are driven each year and over 
their lifetimes. Even with their higher 
fuel economy, this additional driving 
consumes some fuel, so the rebound 
effect reduces the net fuel savings that 
result when new CAFE standards 
require manufacturers to improve fuel 
economy. 
The magnitude of the rebound effect 
is an important determinant of the 
actual fuel savings that are likely to 
result from adopting stricter CAFE 
standards. Research on the magnitude of 
the rebound effect in light-duty vehicle 
use dates to the early 1980s, and 
generally concludes that a statistically 
significant rebound effect occurs when 
vehicle fuel efficiency improves.499 The 
agency reviewed studies of the rebound 
effect it had previously relied upon, 
considered more recently published 
estimates, and developed new estimates 
of its magnitude for purposes of this 
NPRM.500 Recent studies provide some 
evidence that the rebound effect has 
been declining over time, and may 
decline further over the immediate 
future if incomes rise faster than 
gasoline prices. This result appears 
plausible, because the responsiveness of 
vehicle use to variation in fuel costs is 
expected to decline as they account for 
a smaller proportion of the total 
monetary cost of driving, which has 
been the case until very recently. At the 
same time, rising personal incomes 
would be expected to reduce the 
sensitivity of vehicle use to fuel costs as 
the time component of driving costs— 
which is likely to be related to income 
levels—accounts for a larger fraction the 
total cost of automobile travel. NHTSA 
developed new estimates of the rebound 
effect by using national data on light- 
duty vehicle travel over the period from 
1950 through 2006 to estimate various 
econometric models of the relationship 
between vehicle miles-traveled and 
factors likely to influence it, including 
household income, fuel prices, vehicle 
fuel efficiency, road supply, the number 
of vehicles in use, vehicle prices, and 
other factors.501 The results of NHTSA’s 
analysis are consistent with the findings 
from other recent research: The average 
long-run rebound effect ranged from 16 
percent to 30 percent over the period 
from 1950 through 2007, while 
estimates of the rebound effect in 2007 
range from 8 percent to 14 percent. 
Projected values of the rebound effect 
for the period from 2010 through 2030, 
which the agency developed using 
forecasts of personal income, fuel 
prices, and fuel efficiency from AEO 
2009’s Reference Case, range from 4 
percent to 16 percent, depending on the 
specific model used to generate them. 
In light of these results, the agency’s 
judgment is that the apparent decline 
over time in the magnitude of the 
rebound effect justifies using a value for 
future analysis that is lower than 
historical estimates, which average 15– 
25 percent. Because the lifetimes of 
vehicles affected by the alternative 
CAFE standards considered in this 
rulemaking will extend from 2012 until 
nearly 2050, a value that is significantly 
lower than historical estimates appears 
to be appropriate. Thus NHTSA has 
elected to use a 10 percent rebound 
effect in its analysis of fuel savings and 
other benefits from higher CAFE 
standards for this NPRM. 
NHTSA also invites comment on 
other alternatives for estimating the 
rebound effect. As one illustration, 
variation in the price per gallon of 
gasoline directly affects the per-mile 
cost of driving, and drivers may respond 
just as they would to a change in the 
cost of driving resulting from a change 
in fuel economy, by varying the number 
of miles they drive. Because vehicles’ 
fuel economy is fixed in the short run, 
variation in the number of miles driven 
in response to changes in fuel prices 
will be reflected in changes in gasoline 
consumption. Under the assumption 
that drivers respond similarly to 
changes in the cost of driving whether 
they are caused by variation in fuel 
prices or fuel economy, the short-run 
price elasticity of gasoline—which 
measures the sensitivity of gasoline 
consumption to changes in its price per 
gallon—may provide some indication 
about the magnitude of the rebound 
effect itself. NHTSA invites comment on 
the extent to which the short-run 
elasticity of demand for gasoline with 
respect to its price can provide useful 
information about the size of the 
rebound effect. Specifically, we seek 
comment on whether it would be

502 The consumer surplus provided by added 
travel is estimated as one-half of the product of the 
decline in fuel cost per mile and the resulting 
increase in the annual number of miles driven. 
503 If manufacturers respond to improved fuel 
economy by reducing the size of fuel tanks to 
maintain a constant driving range, the resulting cost 
savings will presumably be reflected in lower 
vehicle sales prices. 
504 See Department of Transportation, Guidance 
Memorandum, ‘‘The Value of Saving Travel Time: 
Departmental Guidance for Conducting Economic 
Evaluations,’’ Apr. 9, 1997. http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/ 
policy/Data/VOT97guid.pdf (last accessed August

505 The hourly wage rate during 2008 is estimated 
to average $25.50 when expressed in 2007 dollars. 
Personal travel in urban areas (which represents 94 
percent of urban travel) is valued at 50 percent of 
the hourly wage rate, while business travel (the 
remaining 6 percent of urban travel) is valued at 
100 percent of the hourly wage rate. For intercity 
travel, personal travel (87 percent of total intercity 
travel) is valued at 70 percent of the wage rate, 
while business travel (13 percent) is valued at 100 
percent of the wage rate. The resulting values of 
travel time are $12.67 for urban travel and $17.66 
for intercity travel, and must be multiplied by 
vehicle occupancy (1.6) to obtain the estimated 
values of time per vehicle hour in urban and rural 
driving. Finally, about 66% of driving occurs in 
urban areas, while the remaining 34% takes place 
in rural areas, and these percentages are used to 
calculate a weighted average of the value of time 
in all driving. 
506 These estimates were developed by FHWA for 
use in its 1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation 
Study; see http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/hcas/ 
final/index.htm (last accessed August 9, 2009). 
appropriate to use the price elasticity of 
demand for gasoline, or other alternative 
approaches, to guide the choice of a 
value for the rebound effect. 
Additionally, NHTSA recognizes that 
as the world price of oil falls in 
response to lower U.S. demand for oil, 
there is the potential for an increase in 
oil use and, in turn, greenhouse gas 
emissions outside the U.S. This so 
called international oil ‘‘take back’’ 
effect is difficult to estimate. Given that 
oil consumption patterns vary across 
countries, there will be different 
demand responses to a change in the 
world price of crude oil. In addition, 
many countries around the world 
subsidize their oil consumption. It is not 
clear how oil consumption would 
change due to changes in the market 
price of oil given the current pattern of 
demand and subsidies. Further, many 
countries, especially in the developed 
countries/regions (i.e., the European 
Union), already have or anticipate 
implementing policies to limit GHG 
emissions. Further out in the future, it 
is anticipated that developing countries 
would take actions to reduce their GHG 
emissions as well. Any increases in 
petroleum consumption and GHG 
emissions in other nations that occurs in 
response to a decline in world 
petroleum prices would be attributed to 
those nations, and recorded in their 
respective GHG emissions inventories. 
Thus, including the same increase in 
emissions as part of the impact of 
adopting CAFE standards in the U.S. 
would risk double-counting of global 
emissions totals. NHTSA seeks 
comment on how to estimate the 
international ‘‘take back’’ effect and its 
impact on fuel consumption and GHG 
emissions. See the Energy Security 
section of the TSD, 4.2.8, for more 
discussion of the impact of the proposed 
vehicle rule on oil markets. 
h. Benefits From Increased Vehicle Use 
The increase in vehicle use from the 
rebound effect provides additional 
benefits to their owners, who may make 
more frequent trips or travel farther to 
reach more desirable destinations. This 
additional travel provides benefits to 
drivers and their passengers by 
improving their access to social and 
economic opportunities away from 
home. As evidenced by their decisions 
to make more frequent or longer trips 
when improved fuel economy reduces 
their costs for driving, the benefits from 
this additional travel exceed the costs 
drivers and passengers incur in making 
more frequent or longer trips. 
The agency’s analysis estimates the 
economic benefits from increased 
rebound-effect driving as the sum of fuel 
costs drivers incur plus the consumer 
surplus they receive from the additional 
accessibility it provides.502 Because the 
increase in travel depends on the extent 
of improvement in fuel economy, the 
value of benefits it provides differs 
among model years and alternative 
CAFE standards. Under even those 
alternatives that would impose the 
highest standards, however, the 
magnitude of these benefits represents a 
small fraction of total benefits. 
i. The Value of Increased Driving Range 
Improving vehicles’ fuel economy 
may also increase their driving range 
before they require refueling. By 
reducing the frequency with which 
drivers typically refuel, and by 
extending the upper limit of the range 
they can travel before requiring 
refueling, improving fuel economy thus 
provides some additional benefits to 
their owners.503 NHTSA re-examined 
this issue for purposes of this 
rulemaking, and found no information 
in comments or elsewhere that would 
cause the agency to revise its previous 
approach. Since no direct estimates of 
the value of extended vehicle range are 
available, NHTSA calculates directly the 
reduction in the annual number of 
required refueling cycles that results 
from improved fuel economy, and 
applies DOT-recommended values of 
travel time savings to convert the 
resulting time savings to their economic 
value.504 
As an illustration, a typical small light 
truck model has an average fuel tank 
size of approximately 20 gallons. 
Assuming that drivers typically refuel 
when their tanks are 55 percent full (i.e., 
11 gallons in reserve), increasing this 
model’s actual on-road fuel economy 
from 24 to 25 mpg would extend its 
driving range from 216 miles (= 9 
gallons × 24 mpg) to 225 miles (= 9 
gallons × 25 mpg). Assuming that it is 
driven 12,000 miles/year, this reduces 
the number of times it needs to be 
refueled each year from 55.6 (= 12,000 
miles per year/216 miles per refueling) 
to 53.3 (= 12,000 miles per year/225 
miles per refueling), or by 2.3 refuelings 
per year. 
Weighted by the nationwide mix of 
urban and rural driving, personal and 
business travel in urban and rural areas, 
and average vehicle occupancy for 
driving trips, the DOT-recommended 
values of travel time per vehicle-hour is 
$24.64 (in 2007 dollars).505 Assuming 
that locating a station and filling up 
requires five minutes, the annual value 
of time saved as a result of less frequent 
refueling amounts to $4.72 (calculated 
as 5/60 × 2.3 × $24.64). This calculation 
is repeated for each future year that 
model year 2012–2016 cars and light 
trucks would remain in service. Like 
fuel savings and other benefits, the 
value of this benefit declines over a 
model year’s lifetime, because a smaller 
number of vehicles originally produced 
during that model year remain in 
service each year, and those remaining 
in service are driven fewer miles. 
NHTSA recognizes that many 
assumptions made in its estimate for the 
value of increased driving range are 
subject to uncertainty. Please see 
Chapter 4 of the TSD and Chapter 8 of 
NHTSA’s PRIA for more information 
about the uncertainty regarding these 
assumptions. 
j. Added Costs From Congestion, 
Crashes and Noise 
Increased vehicle use associated with 
the rebound effect also contributes to 
increased traffic congestion, motor 
vehicle accidents, and highway noise. 
NHTSA relies on estimates of per-mile 
congestion, accident, and noise costs 
caused by increased use of automobiles 
and light trucks developed by the 
Federal Highway Administration to 
estimate these increased costs.506 
NHTSA employed these estimates 
previously in its analysis accompanying 
the MY 2011 final rule, and continues

to find them appropriate for this NPRM 
after reviewing the procedures used by 
FHWA to develop them and considering 
other available estimates of these values. 
The agency multiplies FHWA’s 
estimates of per-mile costs by the 
annual increases in automobile and 
light truck use from the rebound effect 
to yield the estimated increases in 
congestion, accident, and noise 
externality costs during each future 
year. 
k. Petroleum Consumption and Import 
Externalities 
U.S. consumption and imports of 
petroleum products also impose costs 
on the domestic economy that are not 
reflected in the market price for crude 
petroleum, or in the prices paid by 
consumers of petroleum products such 
as gasoline. These costs include (1) 
higher prices for petroleum products 
resulting from the effect of U.S. oil 
import demand on the world oil price; 
(2) the risk of disruptions to the U.S. 
economy caused by sudden reductions 
in the supply of imported oil to the U.S.; 
and (3) expenses for maintaining a U.S. 
military presence to secure imported oil 
supplies from unstable regions, and for 
maintaining the strategic petroleum 
reserve (SPR) to cushion against 
resulting price increases.507 
Higher U.S. imports of crude oil or 
refined petroleum products increase the 
magnitude of these external economic 
costs, thus increasing the true economic 
cost of supplying transportation fuels 
above their market prices. Conversely, 
lowering U.S. imports of crude 
petroleum or refined fuels by reducing 
domestic fuel consumption can reduce 
these external costs, and any reduction 
in their total value that results from 
improved fuel economy represents an 
economic benefit of more stringent 
CAFE standards, in addition to the 
value of saving fuel itself. 
NHTSA has carefully reviewed its 
assumptions regarding the appropriate 
value of these benefits for this proposed 
rule. In analyzing benefits from its 
recent actions to increase light truck 
CAFE standards for model years 2005– 
07 and 2008–11, NHTSA relied on a 
1997 study by Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory (ORNL) to estimate the value 
of reduced economic externalities from 
petroleum consumption and imports.508 
More recently, ORNL updated its 
estimates of the value of these 
externalities, using the analytic 
framework developed in its original 
1997 study in conjunction with recent 
estimates of the variables and 
parameters that determine their 
value.509 The updated ORNL study was 
subjected to a detailed peer review by 
experts selected by EPA, and its 
estimates of the value of oil import 
externalities were subsequently revised 
to reflect their comments and 
recommendations.510 
At the request of EPA, ORNL further 
revised its 2008 estimates of external 
costs from U.S. oil imports to reflect 
recent changes in the outlook for world 
petroleum prices and continuing 
changes in the structure and 
characteristics of global petroleum 
supply and demand. 
These most recent revisions increase 
ORNL’s estimates of the ‘‘monopsony 
premium’’ associated with U.S. oil 
imports, which measures the reduced 
value of payments from U.S. oil 
purchasers to foreign oil suppliers 
beyond the savings from reduced 
purchases of petroleum itself that 
results when lower U.S. import demand 
reduces the world price of petroleum.511 
Consistency with NHTSA’s use of 
estimates of the global benefits from 
reducing emissions of CO2 and other 
greenhouse gases in this analysis, 
however, requires the use of a global 
perspective for assessing their net value. 
From this perspective, reducing these 
payments simply results in a transfer of 
resources from foreign oil suppliers to 
U.S. purchasers (or more properly, in a 
savings in the value of resources 
previously transferred from U.S. 
purchasers to foreign producers), and 
provides no real savings in resources to 
the global economy. Thus NHTSA’s 
analysis of the benefits from adopting 
higher CAFE standards for MY 2012– 
2016 cars and light trucks excludes the 
reduced value of monopsony payments 
by U.S. oil consumers that might result 
from lower fuel consumption by these 
vehicles. 
The literature on the energy security 
for the last two decades has routinely 
combined the monopsony and the 
macroeconomic disruption components 
when calculating the total value of the 
energy security premium. However, in 
the context of using a global value for 
the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) the 
question arises: How should the energy 
security premium be used when some 
benefits from the proposed rule, such as 
the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, are calculated at a global 
level? Monopsony benefits represent 
avoided payments by the U.S. to oil 
producers in foreign countries that 
result from a decrease in the world oil 
price as the U.S. decreases its 
consumption of imported oil. Although 
there is clearly a benefit to the U.S. 
when considered from the domestic 
perspective, the decrease in price due to 
decreased demand in the U.S. also 
represents a loss of income to oil- 
producing countries. Given the 
redistributive nature of this effect, do 
the negative effects on other countries 
‘‘net out’’ the positive impacts to the 
U.S.? If this is the case, then, the 
monopsony portion of the energy 
security premium should be excluded 
from the net benefits calculation for the 
rule. 
As the preceding discussion has 
indicated, the agencies omitted the 
reduction in monopsony payments that 
occurs when U.S. petroleum 
consumption and imports are reduced 
from their estimates of economic 
benefits for the proposed rules. Since 
the reduction in monopsony payments 
by U.S. oil consumers is exactly offset 
by a decline in income to suppliers of 
imported oil, this omission ensures 
consistency of the agencies’ analysis 
with the inclusion of global benefits 
from reducing emissions of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The agencies seek 
comment on whether, from other 
perspectives, it would be reasonable to 
include both the global value of 
reducing GHG emissions and the 
reduction in monopsony payments by 
U.S. consumers of petroleum products 
in their estimates of total economic 
benefits from reducing U.S. fuel 
consumption. 
ORNL’s most recently revised 
estimates of the increase in the expected 
costs associated with potential 
disruptions in U.S. petroleum imports 
imply that each gallon of imported fuel 
or petroleum saved reduces the 
expected costs of oil supply disruptions

512 However, the agency conducted a sensitivity 
analysis of the potential effect of assuming that 
some reduction military spending would result 
from fuel savings and reduced petroleum imports 
in order to investigate its impacts on the standards 
and fuel savings. 
513 Differences between forecast annual U.S. 
imports of crude petroleum and refined products 
among these three scenarios range from 24–89 
percent of differences in projected annual gasoline 
and diesel fuel consumption in the U.S. These 
differences average 49 percent over the forecast 
period spanned by AEO 2009. 
514 Differences between forecast annual U.S. 
imports of crude petroleum among these three 
scenarios range from 67–97 percent of differences 
in total U.S. refining of crude petroleum, and 
average 85 percent over the forecast period spanned 
by AEO 2009. 
515 This figure is calculated as 50 gallons + 50 
gallons * 90% = 50 gallons + 45 gallons = 95 
gallons. 
516 The MOVES model assumes that the per-mile 
rates at which these pollutants are emitted are 
determined by EPA regulations and the 
effectiveness of catalytic after-treatment of engine 
exhaust emissions, and are thus unaffected by 
changes in car and light truck fuel economy. 
517 These are 30 and 15 parts per million (ppm, 
measured on a mass basis) for gasoline and diesel 
respectively, which produces emission rates of 0.17 
grams of SO2 per gallon of gasoline and 0.10 grams 
per gallon of diesel. 
518 Argonne National Laboratories, The 
Greenhouse Gas and Regulated Emissions from 
Transportation (GREET) Model, Version 1.8, June 
2007, available at http:// 
www.transportation.anl.gov/modeling_simulation/ 
GREET/index.html (last accessed August 9, 2009). 
519 Emissions that occur during vehicle refueling 
at retail gasoline stations (primarily evaporative 
emissions of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs) 
are already accounted for in the ‘‘tailpipe’’ emission 
factors used to estimate the emissions generated by 
increased light truck use. GREET estimates 
emissions in each phase of gasoline production and 
distribution in mass per unit of gasoline energy 
content; these factors are then converted to mass 
per gallon of gasoline using the average energy 
content of gasoline. 
to the U.S. economy by $0.16 per gallon 
(in 2007$). The reduction in expected 
disruption costs represents a real 
savings in resources, and thus 
contributes economic benefits in 
addition to the savings in fuel 
production costs that result from 
increasing fuel economy. NHTSA 
employs this value in its evaluation of 
the economic benefits from adopting 
higher CAFE standards for MY 2012– 
2016 cars and light trucks. 
NHTSA’s analysis does not include 
savings in budgetary outlays to support 
U.S. military activities among the 
benefits of higher fuel economy and the 
resulting fuel savings.512 NHTSA’s 
analysis of benefits from alternative 
CAFE standards for MY 2012–2016 also 
excludes any cost savings from 
maintaining a smaller SPR from its 
estimates of the external benefits of 
reducing gasoline consumption and 
petroleum imports. This view concurs 
with that of the recent ORNL study of 
economic costs from U.S. oil imports, 
which concludes that savings in 
government outlays for these purposes 
are unlikely to result from reductions in 
consumption of petroleum products and 
oil imports on the scale of those 
resulting from higher CAFE standards. 
Based on a detailed analysis of 
differences in fuel consumption, 
petroleum imports, and imports of 
refined petroleum products among the 
Reference Case, High Economic Growth, 
and Low Economic Growth Scenarios 
presented in AEO 2009, NHTSA 
estimates that approximately 50 percent 
of the reduction in fuel consumption 
resulting from adopting higher CAFE 
standards is likely to be reflected in 
reduced U.S. imports of refined fuel, 
while the remaining 50 percent would 
be reduce domestic fuel refining.513 Of 
this latter figure, 90 percent is 
anticipated to reduce U.S. imports of 
crude petroleum for use as a refinery 
feedstock, while the remaining 10 
percent is expected to reduce U.S. 
domestic production of crude 
petroleum.514 Thus on balance, each 
100 gallons of fuel saved as a 
consequence of higher CAFE standards 
is anticipated to reduce total U.S. 
imports of crude petroleum or refined 
fuel by 95 gallons.515 
l. Air Pollutant Emissions 
i. Impacts on Criteria Air Pollutant 
Emissions 
Criteria air pollutants emitted by 
vehicles and during fuel production 
include carbon monoxide (CO), 
hydrocarbon compounds (usually 
referred to as ‘‘volatile organic 
compounds,’’ or VOC), nitrogen oxides 
(NOX), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), 
and sulfur oxides (SOX). While 
reductions in domestic fuel refining and 
distribution that result from lower fuel 
consumption will reduce U.S. emissions 
of these pollutants, additional vehicle 
use associated with the rebound effect 
from higher fuel economy will increase 
their emissions. Thus the net effect of 
stricter CAFE standards on emissions of 
each criteria pollutant depends on the 
relative magnitudes of its reduced 
emissions in fuel refining and 
distribution, and increases in its 
emissions from vehicle use. Because the 
relationship between emissions in fuel 
refining and vehicle use is different for 
each criteria pollutant, the net effect of 
fuel savings from the proposed 
standards on total emissions of each 
pollutant is likely to differ. We note that 
any benefits in terms of criteria air 
pollutant reductions resulting from this 
rule would not be direct benefits. 
With the exception of SO2, NHTSA 
calculated annual emissions of each 
criteria pollutant resulting from vehicle 
use by multiplying its estimates of car 
and light truck use during each year 
over their expected lifetimes by per-mile 
emission rates appropriate to each 
vehicle type, fuel, model year, and age. 
These emission rates were developed by 
U.S. EPA using its Motor Vehicle 
Emission Simulator (Draft MOVES 
2009).516 Emission rates for SO2 were 
calculated by NHTSA using average fuel 
sulfur content estimates supplied by 
EPA, together with the assumption that 
the entire sulfur content of fuel is 
emitted in the form of SO2.517 Total SO2 
emissions under each alternative CAFE 
standard were calculated by applying 
the resulting emission rates directly to 
estimated annual gasoline and diesel 
fuel use by cars and light trucks. 
As with other impacts, the changes in 
emissions of criteria air pollutants 
resulting from alternative increases in 
CAFE standards for MY 2012–2016 cars 
and light trucks were calculated from 
the differences between emissions 
under each alternative that would 
increase CAFE standards, and emissions 
under the baseline alternative. 
NHTSA estimated the reductions in 
criteria pollutant emissions from 
producing and distributing fuel that 
would occur under alternative CAFE 
standards using emission rates obtained 
by EPA from Argonne National 
Laboratories’ Greenhouse Gases and 
Regulated Emissions in Transportation 
(GREET) model.518 The GREET model 
provides separate estimates of air 
pollutant emissions that occur in 
different phases of fuel production and 
distribution, including crude oil 
extraction, transportation, and storage, 
fuel refining, and fuel distribution and 
storage.519 EPA modified the GREET 
model to change certain assumptions 
about emissions during crude petroleum 
extraction and transportation, as well as 
to update its emission rates to reflect 
adopted and pending EPA emission 
standards. NHTSA converted these 
emission rates from the mass per fuel 
energy content basis on which GREET 
reports them to mass per gallon of fuel 
supplied using estimates of fuel energy 
content supplied by GREET. 
The resulting emission rates were 
applied to the agency’s estimates of fuel 
consumption under each alternative 
CAFE standard to develop estimates of 
total emissions of each criteria pollutant 
during fuel production and distribution. 
The assumptions about the effects of 
changes in fuel consumption on 
domestic and imported sources of fuel 
supply discussed above were then 
employed to calculate the effects of

520 In effect, this assumes that the distances crude 
oil travels to U.S. refineries are approximately the 
same regardless of whether it travels from domestic 
oilfields or import terminals, and that the distances 
that gasoline travels from refineries to retail stations 
are approximately the same as those from import 
terminals to gasoline stations. 
521 All emissions from increased vehicle use are 
assumed to occur within the U.S., since CAFE 
standards would apply only to vehicles produced 
for sale in the U.S. 
522 These reflect differences in the typical 
geographic distributions of emissions of each 
pollutant, their contributions to ambient PM2.5 
concentrations, pollution levels (predominantly 
those of PM2.5), and resulting changes in population 
exposure. 
reductions in fuel use from alternative 
CAFE standards on changes in imports 
of refined fuel and domestic refining. 
NHTSA’s analysis assumes that 
reductions in imports of refined fuel 
would reduce criteria pollutant 
emissions during fuel storage and 
distribution only. Reductions in 
domestic fuel refining using imported 
crude oil as a feedstock are assumed to 
reduce emissions during fuel refining, 
storage, and distribution, because each 
of these activities would be reduced. 
Reduced domestic fuel refining using 
domestically-produced crude oil is 
assumed to reduce emissions during all 
four phases of fuel production and 
distribution.520 
Finally, NHTSA calculated the net 
changes in domestic emissions of each 
criteria pollutant by summing the 
increases in emissions projected to 
result from increased vehicle use, and 
the reductions anticipated to result from 
lower domestic fuel refining and 
distribution.521 As indicated previously, 
the effect of adopting higher CAFE 
standards on total emissions of each 
criteria pollutant depends on the 
relative magnitudes of the resulting 
reduction in emissions from fuel 
refining and distribution, and the 
increase in emissions from additional 
vehicle use. Although these net changes 
vary significantly among individual 
criteria pollutants, the agency projects 
that on balance, adopting higher CAFE 
standards would reduce emissions of all 
criteria air pollutants except carbon 
monoxide (CO). 
The net changes in domestic 
emissions of fine particulates (PM2.5) 
and its chemical precursors (such as 
NOX, SOX, and VOCs) are converted to 
economic values using estimates of the 
reductions in health damage costs per 
ton of emissions of each pollutant that 
is avoided, which were developed and 
recently revised by EPA. These savings 
represent the estimated reductions in 
the value of damages to human health 
resulting from lower atmospheric 
concentrations and population exposure 
to air pollution that occur when 
emissions of each pollutant that 
contributes to atmospheric PM2.5 
concentrations are reduced. The value 
of reductions in the risk of premature 
death due to exposure to fine particulate 
pollution (PM2.5) account for a majority 
of EPA’s estimated values of reducing 
criteria pollutant emissions, although 
the value of avoiding other health 
impacts is also included in these 
estimates. These values do not include 
a number of unquantified benefits, such 
as reduction in the welfare and 
environmental impacts of PM2.5 
pollution, or reductions in health and 
welfare impacts related to other criteria 
pollutants (ozone, NO2, and SO2) and air 
toxics. EPA estimates different PM- 
related per-ton values for reducing 
emissions from vehicle use than for 
reductions in emissions of that occur 
during fuel production and 
distribution.522 NHTSA applies these 
separate values to its estimates of 
changes in emissions from vehicle use 
and fuel production and distribution to 
determine the net change in total 
economic damages from emissions of 
these pollutants. 
EPA projects that the per-ton values 
for reducing emissions of criteria 
pollutants from both mobile sources 
(including motor vehicles) and 
stationary sources such as fuel refineries 
and storage facilities will increase over 
time. These projected increases reflect 
rising income levels, which are assumed 
to increase affected individuals’ 
willingness to pay for reduced exposure 
to health threats from air pollution, as 
well as future population growth, which 
increases population exposure to future 
levels of air pollution. 
ii. Reductions in CO2 Emissions 
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) occur 
throughout the process of producing 
and distributing transportation fuels, as 
well as from fuel combustion itself. By 
reducing the volume of fuel consumed 
by passenger cars and light trucks, 
higher CAFE standards will reduce GHG 
emissions generated by fuel use, as well 
as throughout the fuel supply cycle. 
Lowering these emissions is likely to 
slow the projected pace and reduce the 
ultimate extent of future changes in the 
global climate, thus reducing future 
economic damages that changes in the 
global climate are expected to cause. By 
reducing the probability that climate 
changes with potentially catastrophic 
economic or environmental impacts will 
occur, lowering GHG emissions may 
also result in economic benefits that 
exceed the resulting reduction in the 
expected future economic costs caused 
by gradual changes in the earth’s 
climatic systems. 
Quantifying and monetizing benefits 
from reducing GHG emissions is thus an 
important step in estimating the total 
economic benefits likely to result from 
establishing higher CAFE standards. 
The agency estimated emissions of CO2 
from passenger car and light truck use 
by multiplying the number of gallons of 
each type of fuel (gasoline and diesel) 
they are projected to consume under 
alternative CAFE standards by the 
quantity or mass of CO2 emissions 
released per gallon of fuel consumed. 
This calculation assumes that the entire 
carbon content of each fuel is converted 
to CO2 emissions during the combustion 
process. Carbon dioxide emissions 
account for nearly 95 percent of total 
GHG emissions that result from fuel 
combustion during vehicle use. 
iii. Economic Value of Reductions in 
CO2 Emissions 
NHTSA has taken the economic 
benefits of reducing CO2 emission into 
account in this rulemaking, both in 
developing proposed CAFE standards 
and in assessing the economic benefits 
of each alternative that was considered. 
Since direct estimates of the economic 
benefits from reducing GHG emissions 
are generally not reported in published 
literature on the impacts of climate 
change, these benefits are typically 
assumed to be the ‘‘mirror image’’ of the 
estimated incremental costs resulting 
from an increase in those emissions. 
That is, the benefits from reducing 
emissions are usually measured by the 
savings in estimated economic damages 
that an equivalent increase in emissions 
would otherwise have caused. 
The ‘‘social cost of carbon’’ (SCC) is 
intended to be a monetary measure of 
the incremental damage resulting from 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, 
including (but not limited to) net 
agricultural productivity loss, human 
health effects, property damages from 
sea level rise, and changes in ecosystem 
services. Any effort to quantify and to 
monetize the consequences associated 
with climate change will raise serious 
questions of science, economics, and 
ethics. But with full regard for the limits 
of both quantification and monetization, 
the SCC can be used to provide an 
estimate of the social benefits of 
reductions in GHG emissions. 
For at least four reasons, any 
particular figure will be contestable. 
First, scientific and economic 
knowledge about the impacts of climate 
change continues to grow. With new 
and better information about relevant 
questions, including the cost, burdens, 
and possibility of adaptation, current

523 For the purposes of this discussion, we 
present all values of the SCC as the cost per ton of 
CO2 emissions. Some discussions of the SCC in the 
literature use an alternative presentation of a dollar 
per ton of Carbon. The standard adjustment factor 
is 3.67, which means, for example, that a SCC of 
$10 per ton of CO2 would be equivalent to a cost 
of $36.70 for a ton of carbon emitted.

525 It is true that Federal statutes are presumed 
not to have extraterritorial effect, in part to ensure 
that the laws of the United States respect the 
interests of foreign sovereigns. But use of a global 
measure for the SCC does not give extraterritorial 
effect to Federal law and hence does not intrude on 
such interests.

estimates will inevitably change over 
time. Second, some of the likely and 
potential damages from climate 
change—for example, the loss of 
endangered species—are generally not 
included in current SCC estimates. 
These omissions may turn out to be 
significant; in the sense that they may 
mean that the best current estimates are 
too low. As noted by the IPCC Fourth 
Assessment Report, ‘‘It is very likely that 
globally aggregated figures 
underestimate the damage costs because 
they cannot include many non- 
quantifiable impacts.’’ Third, it is 
unlikely that the damage estimates 
account for the directed technological 
change that will lead to innovations that 
reduce the costs of responding to 
climate change—for example, it is likely 
that scientists will develop crops that 
are better able to withstand high 
temperatures. In this respect, the current 
estimates may overstate the likely 
damages. Fourth, controversial ethical 
judgments, including those involving 
the treatment of future generations, play 
a role in judgments about the SCC (see 
in particular the discussion of the 
discount rate, below). 
To date, SCC estimates presented in 
recent regulatory documents have 
varied within and among agencies, 
including DOT, DOE, and EPA. For 
example, a regulation proposed by DOT 
in 2008 assumed a value of $7 per ton 
CO2 523 (2006$) for 2011 emission 
reductions (with a range of $0–14 for 
sensitivity analysis). A regulation 
finalized by DOE used a range of $0–$20 
(2007$). Both of these ranges were 
designed to reflect the value of damages 
to the United States resulting from 
carbon emissions, or the ‘‘domestic’’ 
SCC. In the final MY 2011 CAFE EIS, 
DOT used both a domestic SCC value of 
$2/tCO2 and a global SCC value of 
$33/tCO2 (with sensitivity analysis at 
$80/tCO2), increasing at 2.4 percent per 
year thereafter. The final MY 2011 
CAFE rule also presented a range from 
$2 to $80/tCO2. EPA’s Advance Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking for Greenhouse 
Gases discussed the benefits of reducing 
GHG emissions and identified what it 
described as ‘‘very preliminary’’ SCC 
estimates ‘‘subject to revision’’ that 
spanned three orders of magnitude. 
EPA’s global mean values were $68 and 
$40/tCO2 for discount rates of 2 percent 
and 3 percent respectively (in 2006 real 
dollars for 2007 emissions).524 
The current Administration has 
worked to develop a transparent 
methodology for selecting a set of 
interim SCC estimates to use in 
regulatory analyses until a more 
comprehensive characterization of the 
distribution of SCC is developed. This 
discussion proposes a set of values for 
the interim social cost of carbon. It 
should be emphasized that the analysis 
here is preliminary. Today’s proposed 
joint rulemaking presents SCC estimates 
that reflect the Administration’s current 
understanding of the relevant literature. 
These interim estimates are being used 
for the short-term while an interagency 
group develops a more comprehensive 
characterization of the distribution of 
SCC values for future economic and 
regulatory analyses. The interim values 
should not be viewed as a statement 
about the results of the longer-term 
process. The Administration will be 
evaluating and seeking comment in the 
preamble to today’s proposed rule on all 
of the scientific, economic, and ethical 
issues before establishing final estimates 
for use in future rulemakings. 
The outcomes of the Administration’s 
process to develop interim values are 
judgments in favor of (a) global rather 
than domestic values, (b) an annual 
growth rate of 3%, and (c) interim global 
SCC estimates for 2007 (in 2006 dollars) 
of $55, $33, $19, $10, and $5 per ton of 
CO2. Notably, we have centered our 
current attention on a SCC of $19. The 
proposed figures are based on the 
following judgments. 
1. Global and domestic measures. 
Because of the distinctive nature of the 
climate change problem, we present 
both a global SCC and a fraction of that 
value that represents impacts that may 
occur within the borders of the U.S. 
alone, or a ‘‘domestic’’ SCC, but center 
our current attention on the global 
measure. This approach represents a 
departure from past practices, which 
relied, for the most part, on domestic 
measures. As a matter of law, both 
global and domestic values are 
permissible; the relevant statutory 
provisions are ambiguous and allow 
selection of either measure.525 
It is true that under OMB guidance, 
analysis from the domestic perspective 
is required, while analysis from the 
international perspective is optional. 
The domestic decisions of one nation 
are not typically based on a judgment 
about the effects of those decisions on 
other nations. But the climate change 
problem is highly unusual in the sense 
that it involves (a) a global public good 
in which (b) the emissions of one nation 
may inflict significant damages on other 
nations and (c) the United States is 
actively engaged in promoting an 
international agreement to reduce 
worldwide emissions. 
In these circumstances, we believe the 
global measure is preferred. Use of a 
global measure reflects the reality of the 
problem and is expected to contribute to 
the continuing efforts of the United 
States to ensure that emissions 
reductions occur in many nations. 
Domestic SCC values are also 
presented. The development of a 
domestic SCC is greatly complicated by 
the relatively few region- or country- 
specific estimates of the SCC in the 
literature. One potential source of 
estimates comes from a recent 
unpublished EPA modeling effort using 
the FUND model. The resulting 
estimates suggest that the ratio of 
domestic to global benefits varies with 
key parameter assumptions. With a 3 
percent discount rate, for example, the 
U.S. benefit is about 6 percent of the 
global benefit for the ‘‘central’’ (mean) 
FUND results, while, for the 
corresponding ‘‘high’’ estimates 
associated with a higher climate 
sensitivity and lower global economic 
growth, the U.S. benefit is less than 4 
percent of the global benefit. With a 2 
percent discount rate, the U.S. share is 
about 2–5 percent of the global estimate. 
Based on this available evidence, an 
interim domestic SCC value equal to 6 
percent of the global damages is 
proposed. This figure is in the middle 
of the range of available estimates from 
the literature. It is recognized that the 6 
percent figure is approximate and 
highly speculative and alternative 
approaches will be explored before 
establishing final values for future 
rulemakings. 
2. Filtering existing analyses. There 
are numerous SCC estimates in the 
existing literature, and it is reasonable 
to make use of those estimates in order 
to produce a figure for current use. A 
starting point is provided by the meta- 
analysis in Richard Tol, 2008.526 With

527 See OMB Circular A–4, pp. 35–36, citing 
Portney and Weyant, eds. (1999), Discounting and 
Intergenerational Equity, Resources for the Future, 
Washington, DC. 
that starting point, the Administration 
proposes to ‘‘filter’’ existing SCC 
estimates by using those that (1) are 
derived from peer-reviewed studies; (2) 
do not weight the monetized damages to 
one country more than those in other 
countries; (3) use a ‘‘business as usual’’ 
climate scenario; and (4) are based on 
the most recent published version of 
each of the three major integrated 
assessment models (IAMs): FUND, 
PAGE, and DICE. 
Proposal (1) is based on the view that 
those studies that have been subject to 
peer review are more likely to be 
reliable than those that have not been. 
Proposal (2) is based on a principle of 
neutrality and simplicity; it does not 
treat the citizens of one nation (or 
different citizens within the U.S.) 
differently on the basis of speculative or 
controversial considerations. Further, it 
is consistent with the potential 
compensation tests of Kaldor (1939) and 
Hicks (1940), which use unweighted 
sums of willingness to pay. Finally, this 
is the approach used in rulemakings 
across a variety of settings and 
consequently keeps U.S. government 
policy consistent across contexts. 
Proposal (3) stems from the judgment 
that as a general rule, the proper way to 
assess a policy decision is by comparing 
the implementation of the policy against 
a counterfactual state where the policy 
is not implemented. In addition, our 
expectation is that most policies to be 
evaluated using these interim SCC 
estimates will constitute small enough 
changes to the larger economy to safely 
assume that the marginal benefits of 
emissions reductions will not change 
between the baseline and policy 
scenarios. A departure from this 
approach would be to consider a more 
dynamic setting in which other 
countries might implement policies to 
reduce GHG emissions at an unknown 
future date and the U.S. could choose to 
implement such a policy now or at a 
future date. 
Proposal (4) is based on four 
complementary judgments. First, the 
FUND, PAGE, and DICE models now 
stand as the most comprehensive and 
reliable efforts to measure the economic 
damages from climate change. Second, 
the latest versions of the three IAMs are 
likely to reflect the most recent evidence 
and learning, and hence they are 
presumed to be superior to those that 
preceded them. Third, any effort to 
choose among them, or to reject one in 
favor of the others, would be difficult to 
defend at the present time. In the 
absence of a clear reason to choose 
among them, it is reasonable to base the 
SCC on all of them. Fourth, in light of 
the uncertainties associated with the 
SCC, the additional information offered 
by different models is important. 
3. Use a model-weighted average of 
the estimates at each discount rate. At 
this time, a scientifically valid reason to 
prefer any of the three major IAMs 
(FUND, PAGE, and DICE) has not been 
identified. Accordingly, to address the 
concern that certain models not be given 
unequal weight relative to the other 
models, the estimates are based on an 
equal weighting of the means of the 
estimates from each of the models. 
Among estimates that remain after 
applying the filter, we begin by taking 
the average of all estimates within a 
model. The estimated SCC is then 
calculated as the average of the three 
model-specific averages. This approach 
is used to ensure that models with a 
greater number of published results do 
not exert unequal weight on the interim 
SCC estimates. 
4. Apply a 3 percent annual growth 
rate to the chosen SCC values. SCC is 
assumed to increase over time, because 
future emissions are expected to 
produce larger incremental damages as 
physical and economic systems become 
more stressed as the magnitude of 
climate change increases. Indeed, an 
implied growth rate in the SCC can be 
produced by most of the models that 
estimate economic damages caused by 
increased GHG emissions in future 
years. But neither the rate itself nor the 
information necessary to derive its 
implied value is commonly reported. In 
light of the limited amount of debate 
thus far about the appropriate growth 
rate of the SCC, applying a rate of 3 
percent per year seems appropriate at 
this stage. This value is consistent with 
the range recommended by IPCC (2007) 
and close to the latest published 
estimate (Hope 2008). 
(1) Discount Rates 
For estimation of the benefits 
associated with the mitigation of climate 
change, one of the most complex issues 
involves the appropriate discount rate. 
OMB’s current guidance offers a 
detailed discussion of the relevant 
issues and calls for discount rates of 3 
percent and 7 percent. It also permits a 
sensitivity analysis with low rates (1–3 
percent) for intergenerational problems: 
‘‘If your rule will have important 
intergenerational benefits or costs you 
might consider a further sensitivity 
analysis using a lower but positive 
discount rate in addition to calculating 
net benefits using discount rates of 3 
and 7 percent.’’ 527 
The choice of a discount rate, 
especially over long periods of time, 
raises highly contested and exceedingly 
difficult questions of science, 
economics, philosophy, and law. See, 
e.g., William Nordhaus, The Challenge 
of Global Warming (2008); Nicholas 
Stern, The Economics of Climate 
Change (2007); Discounting and 
Intergenerational Equity (Paul Portney 
and John Weyant eds. 1999). It is not 
clear that future generations would be 
willing to trade environmental quality 
for consumption at the same rate as the 
current generations. Under imaginable 
assumptions, decisions based on cost- 
benefit analysis with high discount rates 
might harm future generations—at least 
if investments are not made for the 
benefit of those generations. See Robert 
Lind, Analysis for Intergenerational 
Discounting, id. at 173, 176–177. It is 
also possible that the use of low 
discount rates for particular projects 
might itself harm future generations, by 
ensuring that resources are not used in 
a way that would greatly benefit them. 
In the context of climate change, 
questions of intergenerational equity are 
especially important. 
Reasonable arguments support the use 
of a 3 percent discount rate. First, that 
rate is among the two figures suggested 
by OMB guidance, and hence it fits with 
existing national policy. Second, it is 
standard to base the discount rate on the 
compensation that people receive for 
delaying consumption, and the 3 
percent is close to the risk-free rate of 
return, proxied by the return on long 
term inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury 
Bonds, as of this writing. Although 
these rates are currently closer to 2.5 
percent, the use of 3 percent provides an 
adjustment for the liquidity premium 
that is reflected in these bonds’ returns. 
At the same time, others would argue 
that a 5 percent discount rate can be 
supported. The argument relies on 
several assumptions. First, that rate can 
also be justified by reference to the level 
of compensation for delaying 
consumption, because it fits with 
market behavior with respect to 
individuals’ willingness to trade-off 
consumption across periods as 
measured by the estimated post-tax 
average real returns to risky private 
investments (e.g., the S&P 500). In the 
climate setting, the 5 percent discount 
rate may be preferable to the riskless 
rate because it is based on risky 
investments and the return to projects to 
mitigate climate change is also risky. In 
contrast, the 3 percent riskless rate may 
be a more appropriate discount rate for

528 Specifically, if the benefits of the policy are 
highly correlated with the returns from broader 
economy, then the market rate should be used to 
discount the benefits. If the benefits are 
uncorrelated with the broader economy the long 
term government bond rate should be applied. 
Furthermore, if the benefits are negatively 
correlated with the broader economy a rate less 
than that on long term government bonds should be 
used (Lind, 1982 pp. 89–90).

uncertain rates increase valuations? J. Environ. 
Econ. Manage. 46 (2003) 52–71. 
531 Most of the estimates in Table 1 rely on 
climate scenarios developed by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
The IPCC published a new set of scenarios in 2000 
for use in the Third Assessment Report (Special 
Report on Emissions Scenarios—SRES). The SRES 
scenarios define four narrative storylines: A1, A2, 
B1 and B2, describing the relationships between the 
forces driving greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions 
and their evolution during the 21st century for large 
world regions and globally. Each storyline 
represents different demographic, social, economic, 
technological, and environmental developments 
that diverge in increasingly irreversible ways. The 
storylines are summarized in Nakicenovic et al., 
2000 (see also http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/ 
ddc/sres/). Because the B1 and B2 storylines 
represent policy cases rather than business-as-usual 
projections, estimates derived from these scenarios 
to be less appropriate for use in benefit-cost 
analysis. They are therefore excluded. 
532 Guo et al. (2006) report estimates based on two 
Gollier discounting schemes. The Gollier 
discounting assumes complex specifications about 
individual utility functions and risk preferences. 
After various conditions are satisfied, declining 
social discount rates emerge. Gollier Discounting 
Scheme 1 employs a certainty-equivalent social rate 
of time preference (SRTP) derived by assuming the 
regional growth rate is equally likely to be 1% 
above or below the original forecast growth rate. 
Gollier Discounting Scheme 2 calculates a certainty- 
equivalent social rate of time preference (SRTP) 
using five possible growth rates, and applies the 
new SRTP instead of the original. Hope (2008) 
conducts Monte Carlo analysis on the PRTP 
component of the discount rate. The PRTP is 
modeled as a triangular distribution with a min 
value of 1%/yr, a most likely value of 2%/yr, and 
a max value of 3%/yr. 
projects where the return is known with 
a high degree of confidence (e.g., 
highway guardrails). In principal, the 
correct discount rate would reflect the 
variance in payoff from climate 
mitigation policy and the correlation 
between the payoffs of the policy and 
the broader economy.528 
Second, 5 percent, and not 3 percent, 
is roughly consistent with estimates 
implied by reasonable inputs to the 
theoretically derived Ramsey equation, 
which specifies the optimal time path 
for consumption. That equation 
specifies the optimal discount rate as 
the sum of two components. The first 
term (the product of the elasticity of the 
marginal utility of consumption and the 
growth rate of consumption) reflects the 
fact that consumption in the future is 
likely to be higher than consumption 
today, so diminishing marginal utility 
implies that the same monetary damage 
will cause a smaller reduction of utility 
in the future. Standard estimates of this 
term from the economics literature are 
in the range of 3 percent–5 percent. The 
second component reflects the 
possibility that a lower weight should 
be placed on utility in the future, to 
account for social impatience or 
extinction risk, which is specified by a 
pure rate of time preference (PRTP). A 
common estimate of the PRTP is 2 
percent, though some observers believe 
that a principle of intergenerational 
equity suggests that the PRTP should be 
close to zero. It follows that discount 
rate of 5 percent is near the middle of 
the range of values that are able to be 
derived from the Ramsey equation. 
It is recognized that the arguments 
above—for use of market behavior and 
the Ramsey equation—face objections in 
the context of climate change, and of 
course there are alternative approaches. 
In light of climate change, it is possible 
that consumption in the future will not 
be higher than consumption today, and 
if so, the Ramsey equation will suggest 
a lower figure. However, the historical 
evidence is consistent with rising 
consumption over time. 
Some critics note that using observed 
interest rates for inter-generational 
decisions imposes current preferences 
on future generations, which some 
economists say may not be appropriate. 
For generational equity, they argue that 
the discount rate should be below 
market rates to correct for market 
distortions and inefficiencies in inter- 
generational transfers of wealth (which 
are presumed to compensate future 
generations for damage), and to treat 
generations equitably based on ethical 
principles (see Broome 2008).529 
Additionally, some analyses attempt 
to deal with uncertainty with respect to 
interest rates over time. We explore 
below how this might be done.530 
(2) Proposed Interim Estimates 
The application of the methodology 
outlined above yields interim estimates 
of the SCC that are reported in Table 
IV.C.3–2. These estimates are reported 
separately using 3 percent and 5 percent 
discount rates. The cells are empty in 
rows 10 and 11, because these studies 
did not report estimates of the SCC at 
a 3 percent discount rate. The model- 
weighted means are reported in the final 
or summary row; they are $33 per tCO2 
at a 3 percent discount rate and $5 per 
tCO2 with a 5 percent discount rate.

533 It should be noted that reported discount rates 
may not be consistently derived across models or 
specific applications of models: While the discount 
rate may be identical, it may reflect different 
assumptions about the individual components of 
the Ramsey equation identified earlier. 
534 In contrast, an alternative approach based on 
Weitzman (2001) would assume that there is a 
constant discount rate that is uncertain and 
represented by a probability distribution. The 
Newell and Pizer, and Weitzman approaches are 
relatively recent contributions, and we invite 
comment on the advantages and disadvantages of 
each.

al. (2009), that are based on the most recent published version of FUND, PAGE, or DICE and use business-as-usual climate scenarios.531 532 All 
values are based on the best available information from the underlying studies about the base year and year dollars, rather than the Tol (2008) 
assumption that all estimates included in his review are 1995 values in 1995$. All values were updated to 2007 using a 3 percent annual growth 
rate in the SCC, and adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator. 
Analyses have been conducted at $33 
and $5 as these represent the estimates 
associated with the 3 percent and 5 
percent discount rates, respectively.533 
The 3 percent and 5 percent estimates 
have independent appeal, and at this 
time a clear preference for one over the 
other is not warranted. Thus, we have 
also included—and centered our current 
attention on—the average of the 
estimates associated with these discount 
rates, which is $19. (Based on the $19 
global value, the approximate domestic 
fraction of these benefits would be $1.14 
per ton of CO2 assuming that domestic 
benefits are 6 percent of the global 
benefits. 
It is true that there is uncertainty 
about interest rates over long time 
horizons. Recognizing that point, 
Newell and Pizer (2003) have made a 
careful effort to adjust for that 
uncertainty. The Newell-Pizer approach 
models discount rate uncertainty as 
something that evolves over time.534 
This is a relatively recent contribution 
to the literature, and estimates based on 
this method are included with the aim 
of soliciting comment. 
There are several concerns with using 
this approach in this context. First, it 
would be a departure from current OMB 
guidance. Second, an approach that 
would average what emerges from 
discount rates of 3 percent and 5 
percent reflects uncertainty about the 
discount rate, but based on a different 
model of uncertainty. The Newell-Pizer 
approach models discount rate 
uncertainty as something that evolves 
over time; in contrast, the preferred 
approach (outlined above) assumes that 
there is a single discount rate with equal 
probability of 3 percent and 5 percent. 
Table IV.C.3–3 reports on the 
application of the Newell-Pizer 
adjustments. The precise numbers 
depend on the assumptions about the 
data generating process that governs 
interest rates. Columns (1a) and (1b) 
assume that ‘‘random walk’’ model best 
describes the data and uses 3 percent 
and 5 percent discount rates, 
respectively. Columns (2a) and (2b) 
repeat this, except that it assumes a 
‘‘mean-reverting’’ process. While the 
empirical evidence does not rule out a 
mean-reverting model, Newell and Pizer 
find stronger empirical support for the 
random walk model.

from Guo et al. (2006) that use a different approach to account for discount rate uncertainty (rows 7–8). 
Note that the correction factor from Newell and Pizer is based on the DICE model. The proper adjustment may differ for other integrated as-
sessment models that produce different time schedules of marginal damages. We would expect this difference to be minor.

The resulting estimates of the social 
cost of carbon are necessarily greater. 
When the adjustments from the random 
walk model are applied, the estimates of 
the social cost of carbon are $10 and $55 
per ton of CO2, with the 5 percent and 
3 percent discount rates, respectively. 
The application of the mean-reverting 
adjustment yields estimates of $6 and 
$36. Relying on the random walk model, 
analyses are also conducted with the 
value of the SCC set at $10 and $55. 
(3) Caveats 
There are at least four caveats to the 
approach outlined above. 
First, the impacts of climate change 
are expected to be widespread, diverse, 
and heterogeneous. In addition, the 
exact magnitude of these impacts is 
uncertain, because of the inherent 
randomness in the Earth’s atmospheric 
processes, the U.S. and global 
economies, and the behaviors of current 
and future populations. Current IAM do 
not currently individually account for 
and assign value to all of the important 
physical and other impacts of climate 
change that are recognized in the 
climate change literature. Although it is 
likely that our capability to quantify and 
monetize impacts will improve with 
time, it is also likely that even in future 
applications, there are a number of 
potentially significant benefits 
categories that will remain 
unmonetized. 
Second, in the opposite direction, it is 
unlikely that the damage estimates 
adequately account for the directed 
technological change that climate 
change will cause. In particular, climate 
change will increase the return on 
investment to develop technologies that 
allow individuals to better cope with 
climate change. For example, it is likely 
that scientists will develop crops that 
are better able to withstand high 
temperatures. In this respect, the current 
estimates may overstate the likely 
damages. 
Third, there has been considerable 
recent discussion of the risk of 
catastrophic impacts and of how best to 
account for worst-case scenarios. Recent 
research by Weitzman (2009) specifies 
some conditions under which the 
possibility of catastrophe would 
undermine the use of IAMs and 
conventional cost-benefit analysis. This 
research requires further exploration 
before its generality is known and the 
optimal way to incorporate it into 
regulatory reviews is understood. 
Fourth, it is also worth noting that the 
SCC estimates are only relevant for 
incremental policies relative to the 
projected baselines, which capture 
business-as-usual scenarios. To evaluate 
non-marginal changes, such as might 
occur if the U.S. acts in tandem with 
other nations, then it might be necessary 
to go beyond the simple expedient of 
using the SCC along the BAU path. In 
particular, it would be correct to 
calculate the aggregate WTP to move 
from the BAU scenario to the policy 
scenario, without imposing the 
restriction that the marginal benefit 
remains constant over this range. 
All of the values derived from this 
process are expressed in 2006 dollars. 
NHTSA has adjusted them to their 
equivalent values in 2007 dollars for 
consistency with other values used in 
its analysis of benefits from adopting 
higher CAFE standards for MY 2012– 
2016 passenger cars and light trucks. 
The resulting value upon which we 
have centered our analysis, which is 
derived from the figures reported in the 
tables above, is equivalent to $20 per 
metric ton of CO2 emissions avoided 
when expressed in 2007$, and the 
agency has relied on this value in its 
analysis. NHTSA has also analyzed the 
sensitivity of its benefit estimates to 
alternative values of $5, $10, $34, and 
$56 per metric ton of CO2 emissions 
avoided, with all figures again in 2007$. 
Each of these values applies to 
emissions during 2007, and are assumed 
to grow in real terms by 3 percent 
annually beginning in 2007. NHTSA 
seeks comments on these values and the 
approach used to derive them. 
m. Discounting Future Benefits and 
Costs 
Discounting future fuel savings and 
other benefits is intended to account for 
the reduction in their value to society 
when they are deferred until some 
future date, rather than received 
immediately. The discount rate 
expresses the percent decline in the 
value of these benefits—as viewed from 
today’s perspective—for each year they 
are deferred into the future. In 
evaluating the benefits from alternative 
increases in CAFE standards for MY 
2012–2016 passenger cars and light 
trucks, NHTSA has employed a 
discount rate of 3 percent per year. The 
agency has also tested the sensitivity of 
these benefit and cost estimates to the 
use of a 7 percent discount rate. 
Although these are the same discount 
rates analyzed in the MY 2011 final 
rule, NHTSA has chosen to use 3 
percent as the basis for the Reference 
Case in this proposed rule rather than 
the 7 percent rate it employed 
previously, for the reasons discussed 
below. 
The primary reason that NHTSA has 
selected 3 percent as the appropriate 
rate for discounting future benefits from 
increased CAFE standards is that most 
or all of vehicle manufacturers’ costs for 
complying with higher CAFE standards 
are likely to be reflected in higher sales 
prices for their new vehicle models. By 
increasing sales prices for new cars and 
light trucks, CAFE regulation will thus 
primarily affect vehicle purchases and 
other private consumption decisions. 
Both economic theory and OMB 
guidance on discounting indicate that 
the future benefits and costs of 
regulations that mainly affect private 
consumption should be discounted at 
the social rate of time preference.535 
OMB guidance also indicates that 
savers appear to discount future 
consumption at an average real (that is, 
adjusted to remove the effect of 
inflation) rate of about 3 percent when 
they face little risk about its likely level. 
Since the real rate that savers use to 
discount future consumption represents 
a reasonable estimate of the social rate 
of time preference, NHTSA has 
employed the 3 percent rate to discount 
projected future benefits and costs 
resulting from higher CAFE standards 
for MY 2012–2016 passenger cars and 
light trucks.536 
Because there is some uncertainty 
about the extent to which vehicle 
manufacturers will be able to recover 
their costs for complying with higher 
CAFE standards by increasing vehicle 
sales prices, however, NHTSA has also 
tested the sensitivity of these benefit 
and cost estimates to the use of a higher 
percent discount rate. OMB guidance 
indicates that the real economy-wide 
opportunity cost of capital is the 
appropriate discount rate to apply to 
future benefits and costs when the 
primary effect of a regulation is ‘‘* * * 
to displace or alter the use of capital in 
the private sector,’’ and estimates that 
this rate currently averages about 7 
percent.537 Thus the agency has also 
tested the sensitivity of its benefit and 
cost estimates for alternative MY 2012– 
2016 CAFE standards to the use of a 7 
percent real discount rate. NHTSA seeks 
comment on whether it should evaluate 
CAFE standards using a discount rate of 
3 percent, 7 percent, or an alternative 
value. 
n. Accounting for Uncertainty in 
Benefits and Costs 
In analyzing the uncertainty 
surrounding its estimates of benefits and 
costs from alternative CAFE standards,

538 74 FR 14308–14358 (Mar. 30, 2009). 
539 In a given model year, the model makes 
additional technologies available to each vehicle 
model within several constraints, including (a) 
whether or not the technology is applicable to the 
vehicle model’s technology class, (b) whether the 
vehicle is undergoing a redesign or freshening in 
the given model year, (c) whether engineering 
aspects of the vehicle make the technology 
unavailable (e.g., secondary axle disconnect cannot 
be applied to two-wheel drive vehicles), and (d) 
whether technology application remains within 
‘‘phase in caps’’ constraining the overall share of a 
manufacturer’s fleet to which the technology can be 
added in a given model year. Once enough 
technology is added to a given manufacturer’s fleet 
in a given model year that these constraints make 
further technology application unavailable, 
technologies are exhausted for that manufacturer in 
that model year. 
540 This possibility was added to the model to 
account for the fact that under EPCA/EISA, 
manufacturers must pay fines if they do not achieve 
compliance with applicable CAFE standards. 49 
U.S.C. 32912(b). NHTSA recognizes that some 
manufacturers will find it more cost-effective to pay 
fines than to achieve compliance, and believes that 
to assume these manufacturers would exhaust 
available technologies before paying fines would 
cause unrealistically high estimates of market 
penetration of expensive technologies such as 
diesel engines and strong hybrid electric vehicles, 
as well as correspondingly inflated estimates of 
both the costs and benefits of any potential CAFE 
standards. 
NHTSA has considered alternative 
estimates of those assumptions and 
parameters likely to have the largest 
effect. These include the projected costs 
of fuel economy-improving technologies 
and their expected effectiveness in 
reducing vehicle fuel consumption, 
forecasts of future fuel prices, the 
magnitude of the rebound effect, the 
reduction in external economic costs 
resulting from lower U.S. oil imports, 
the value to the U.S. economy of 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and 
the discount rate applied to future 
benefits and costs. The range for each of 
these variables employed in the 
uncertainty analysis is presented in the 
section of this notice discussing each 
variable. 
The uncertainty analysis was 
conducted by assuming independent 
normal probability distributions for 
each of these variables, using the low 
and high estimates for each variable as 
the values below which 5 percent and 
95 percent of observed values are 
believed to fall. Each trial of the 
uncertainty analysis employed a set of 
values randomly drawn from each of 
these probability distributions, 
assuming that the value of each variable 
is independent of the others. Benefits 
and costs of each alternative standard 
were estimated using each combination 
of variables. A total of 1,000 trials were 
used to establish the likely probability 
distributions of estimated benefits and 
costs for each alternative standard. 
o. Where Can Readers Find More 
Information About the Economic 
Assumptions? 
Much more detailed information is 
provided in Chapter VIII of the PRIA, 
and a discussion of how NHTSA and 
EPA jointly reviewed and updated 
economic assumptions for purposes of 
this NPRM is available in Chapter 4 of 
the TSD. In addition, all of NHTSA’s 
model input and output files are now 
public and available for the reader’s 
review and consideration. The 
economic input files can be found in the 
docket for this NPRM, NHTSA–2009– 
0059, and on NHTSA’s Web site. 
Finally, because much of NHTSA’s 
economic analysis for purposes of this 
NPRM builds on the work that was done 
for the MY 2011 final rule, we refer 
readers to that document as well for 
background information concerning 
how NHTSA’s assumptions regarding 
economic inputs for CAFE analysis have 
evolved over the past several 
rulemakings, both in response to 
comments and as a result of the agency’s 
growing experience with this type of 
analysis.538 
4. How Does NHTSA Use the 
Assumptions in Its Modeling Analysis? 
In developing today’s proposed CAFE 
standards, NHTSA has made significant 
use of results produced by the CAFE 
Compliance and Effects Model 
(commonly referred to as ‘‘the CAFE 
model’’ or ‘‘the Volpe model’’), which 
DOT’s Volpe National Transportation 
Systems Center developed specifically 
to support NHTSA’s CAFE rulemakings. 
The model, which has been constructed 
specifically for the purpose of analyzing 
potential CAFE standards, integrates the 
following core capabilities: 
(1) Estimating how manufacturers 
could apply technologies in response to 
new fuel economy standards, 
(2) Estimating the costs that would be 
incurred in applying these technologies, 
(3) Estimating the physical effects 
resulting from the application of these 
technologies, such as changes in travel 
demand, fuel consumption, and 
emissions of carbon dioxide and criteria 
pollutants, and 
(4) Estimating the monetized societal 
benefits of these physical effects. 
An overview of the model follows 
below. Separate model documentation 
provides a detailed explanation of the 
functions the model performs, the 
calculations it performs in doing so, and 
how to install the model, construct 
inputs to the model, and interpret the 
model’s outputs. Documentation of the 
model, along with model installation 
files, source code, and sample inputs are 
available at NHTSA’s web site. The 
model documentation is also available 
in the docket for today’s proposed rule, 
as are inputs for and outputs from 
analysis of today’s proposed CAFE 
standards. 
a. How Does the Model Operate? 
As discussed above, the agency uses 
the Volpe model to estimate the extent 
to which manufacturers could attempt 
to comply with a given CAFE standard 
by adding technology to fleets that the 
agency anticipates they will produce in 
future model years. This exercise 
constitutes a simulation of 
manufacturers’ decisions regarding 
compliance with CAFE standards. 
This compliance simulation begins 
with the following inputs: (a) The 
baseline market forecast discussed 
above in Section IV.C.1, (b) technology- 
related estimates discussed above in 
Section IV.C.2, (c) economic inputs 
discussed above in Section IV.C.3, and 
(d) inputs defining the characteristics of 
potential new CAFE standards. For each 
manufacturer, the model applies 
technologies in a sequence that follows 
a defined engineering logic (‘‘decision 
trees’’ discussed in the MY 2011 final 
rule and in the model documentation) 
and a cost-minimizing strategy in order 
to identify a set of technologies the 
manufacturer could apply in response to 
new CAFE standards. The model 
applies technologies to each of the 
projected individual vehicles in a 
manufacturer’s fleet, until one of three 
things occurs: 
(1) The manufacturer’s fleet achieves 
compliance with the applicable 
standard; 
(2) The manufacturer ‘‘exhausts’’ 539 
available technologies; or 
(3) For manufacturers estimated to be 
willing to pay civil penalties, the 
manufacturer reaches the point at which 
doing so would be more cost-effective 
(from the manufacturer’s perspective) 
than adding further technology.540 
As discussed below, the model has 
also been modified in order to apply 
additional technology in early model 
years if doing so will facilitate 
compliance in later model years. 
The model accounts explicitly for 
each model year, applying most 
technologies when vehicles are 
scheduled to be redesigned or 
freshened, and carrying forward 
technologies between model years. The 
CAFE model accounts explicitly for 
each model year because EPCA requires 
that NHTSA make a year-by-year 
determination of the appropriate level of

541 49 U.S.C. 32902(a) states that at least 18 
months before the beginning of each model year, 
the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by 
regulation average fuel economy standards for 
automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in 
that model year, and that each standard shall be the 
maximum feasible average fuel economy level that 
the Secretary decides the manufacturers can 
achieve in that year. NHTSA has long interpreted 
this statutory language to require year-by-year 
assessment of manufacturer capabilities. 49 U.S.C. 
32902(b)(2)(C) also requires that standards increase 
ratably between MY 2011 and MY 2020. 
542 As for all of its other rulemakings, NHTSA is 
required by Executive Order 12866 and DOT 
regulations to analyze the costs and benefits of 
CAFE standards. Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 
51735 (Oct. 4, 1993); DOT Order 2100.5, 
‘‘Regulatory Policies and Procedures,’’ 1979,

stringency and then set the standard at 
that level, while ensuring ratable 
increases in average fuel economy.541 
The model also calculates the costs, 
effects, and benefits of technologies that 
it estimates could be added in response 
to a given CAFE standard.542 It 
calculates costs by applying the cost 
estimation techniques discussed above 
in Section IV.C.2, and by accounting for 
the number of affected vehicles. It 
accounts for effects such as changes in 
vehicle travel, changes in fuel 
consumption, and changes in 
greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant 
emissions. It does so by applying the 
fuel consumption estimation techniques 
also discussed in Section IV.C.2, and the 
vehicle survival and mileage 
accumulation forecasts, the rebound 
effect estimate and the fuel properties 
and emission factors discussed in 
Section IV.C.3. Considering changes in 
travel demand and fuel consumption, 
the model estimates the monetized 
value of accompanying benefits to 
society, as discussed in Section IV.C.3. 
The model calculates both the 
undiscounted and discounted value of 
benefits that accrue over time in the 
future. 
The Volpe model has other 
capabilities that facilitate the 
development of a CAFE standard. It can 
be used to fit a mathematical function 
forming the basis for an attribute-based 
CAFE standard, following the steps 
described below. It can also be used to 
evaluate many (e.g., 200 per model year) 
potential levels of stringency 
sequentially, and identify the stringency 
at which specific criteria are met. For 
example, it can identify the stringency 
at which net benefits to society are 
maximized, the stringency at which a 
specified total cost is reached, or the 
stringency at which a given average 
required fuel economy level is attained. 
This allows the agency to compare more 
easily the impacts in terms of fuel 
savings, emissions reductions, and costs 
and benefits of achieving different levels 
of stringency according to different 
criteria. The model can also be used to 
perform uncertainty analysis (i.e., 
Monte Carlo simulation), in which input 
estimates are varied randomly according 
to specified probability distributions, 
such that the uncertainty of key 
measures (e.g., fuel consumption, costs, 
benefits) can be evaluated. 
b. Has NHTSA Considered Other 
Models? 
Nothing in EPCA requires NHTSA to 
use the Volpe model. In principle, 
NHTSA could perform all of these tasks 
through other means. For example, in 
developing the standards proposed 
today, the agency did not use the Volpe 
model’s curve fitting routines, because 
they could not be modified in time to 
reflect the change in the mathematical 
function defining the proposed CAFE 
standards. The Volpe model may be 
modified to do so for the final rule, 
although the agency can also continue 
to fit the mathematical function outside 
the model. In general, though, these 
model capabilities have greatly 
increased the agency’s ability to rapidly, 
systematically, and reproducibly 
conduct key analyses relevant to the 
formulation and evaluation of new 
CAFE standards. 
During its previous rulemaking, 
which led to the final MY 2011 
standards promulgated earlier this year, 
NHTSA received comments from the 
Alliance and CARB encouraging 
NHTSA to examine the usefulness of 
other models. As discussed in that final 
rule, NHTSA, having undertaken such 
consideration, concluded that the Volpe 
model is a sound and reliable tool for 
the development and evaluation of 
potential CAFE standards.543 
In reconsidering and reaffirming this 
conclusion for purposes of this NPRM, 
NHTSA notes that the Volpe model not 
only has been formally peer-reviewed 
and tested through three rulemakings, 
but also has some features especially 
important for the analysis of CAFE 
standards under EPCA/EISA. Among 
these are the ability to perform year-by- 
year analysis, and the ability to account 
for engineering differences between 
specific vehicle models. 
EPCA requires that NHTSA set CAFE 
standards for each model year at the 
level appropriate for that year.544 Doing 
so requires the ability to analyze each 
model year and, when developing 
regulations covering multiple model 
years, to account for the 
interdependency of model years in 
terms of the appropriate levels of 
stringency for each one. Also, as part of 
the evaluation of the economic 
practicability of the standards, as 
required by EPCA, NHTSA has 
traditionally assessed the annual costs 
and benefits of the standards as it is 
permitted to do so. The first (2002) 
version of DOT’s model treated each 
model year separately, and did not 
perform this type of explicit accounting. 
Manufacturers took strong exception to 
these shortcomings. For example, GM 
commented in 2002 that ‘‘although the 
table suggests that the proposed 
standard for MY 2007, considered in 
isolation, promises benefits exceeding 
costs, that anomalous outcome is merely 
an artifact of the peculiar Volpe 
methodology, which treats each year 
independently of any other * * *.’’ In 
2002, GM also criticized DOT’s analysis 
for, in some cases, adding a technology 
in MY 2006 and then replacing it with 
another technology in MY 2007. GM 
(and other manufacturers) argued that 
this completely failed to represent true 
manufacturer product-development 
cycles, and therefore could not be 
technologically feasible or economically 
practicable. 
In response to these concerns, and 
related concerns expressed by other 
manufacturers, DOT modified the CAFE 
model in order to account for 
dependencies between model years and 
to better represent manufacturers’ 
planning cycles, in a way that still 
allowed NHTSA to comply with the 
statutory requirement to determine the 
appropriate level of the standards for 
each model year. This was 
accomplished by limiting the 
application of many technologies to 
model years in which vehicle models 
are scheduled to be redesigned (or, for 
some technologies, ‘‘freshened’’), and by 
causing the model to ‘‘carry forward’’ 
applied technologies from one model 
year to the next. 
During the recent rulemaking for MY 
2011 passenger cars and light trucks, 
DOT further modified the CAFE model 
to account for cost reductions 
attributable to ‘‘learning effects’’ related 
to volume (i.e., economies of scale) and 
the passage of time (i.e., time-based 
learning), both of which evolve on year- 
by-year basis. These changes were 
implemented in response to comments 
by environmental groups and other 
stakeholders. 
The Volpe model is also able to 
account for important engineering 
differences between specific vehicle 
models, and to thereby reduce the risk 
of applying technologies that may be 
incompatible with or already present on

545 Although a manufacturer may, in addition, 
generate CAFE credits in early model years for use 
in later model years (or, less likely, in later years 
for use in early years), EPCA does not allow 
NHTSA, when setting CAFE standards, to account 
for manufacturers’ use of CAFE credits. 
a given vehicle model. Some 
commenters have previously suggested 
that manufacturers are most likely to 
broadly apply generic technology 
‘‘packages,’’ and the Volpe model does 
tend to form ‘‘packages’’ dynamically, 
based on vehicle characteristics, 
redesign schedules, and schedules for 
increases in CAFE standards. For 
example, under the proposed CAFE 
standards for passenger cars, the CAFE 
model estimated that manufacturers 
could apply turbocharged SGDI engines 
mated with dual-clutch AMTs to 1.8 
million passenger cars in MY 2016, 
about 16 percent of the MY 2016 
passenger car fleet. Recent 
modifications to the model, discussed 
below, to represent multi-year planning, 
increase the model’s tendency to add 
relatively cost-effective technologies 
when vehicles are estimated to be 
redesigned, and thereby increase the 
model’s tendency to form such 
packages. 
On the other hand, some 
manufacturers have indicated that 
especially when faced with significant 
progressive increases in the stringency 
of new CAFE standards, they are likely 
to also look for narrower opportunities 
to apply specific technologies. By 
progressively applying specific 
technologies to specific vehicle models, 
the CAFE model also produces such 
outcomes. For example, under the 
proposed CAFE standards for passenger 
cars, the CAFE model estimated that in 
MY 2012, some manufacturers could 
find it advantageous to apply SIDI to 
some vehicle models without also 
adding turbochargers. 
By following this approach of 
combining technologies incrementally 
and on a model-by-model basis, the 
CAFE model is able to account for 
important engineering differences 
between vehicle models and avoid 
unlikely technology combinations. For 
example, the model does not apply 
dual-clutch AMTs (or strong hybrid 
systems) to vehicle models with 6-speed 
manual transmissions. Some vehicle 
buyers prefer a manual transmission; 
this preference cannot be assumed 
away. The model’s accounting for 
manual transmissions is also important 
for vehicles with larger engines: For 
example, cylinder deactivation cannot 
be applied to vehicles with manual 
transmissions, because there is no 
reliable means of predicting when the 
driver will change gears. By retaining 
cylinder deactivation as a specific 
technology rather than part of a pre- 
determined package and by retaining 
differentiation between vehicles with 
different transmissions, DOT’s model is 
able to target cylinder deactivation only 
to vehicle models for which it is 
technologically feasible. 
The Volpe model also produces a 
single vehicle-level output file that, for 
each vehicle model, shows which 
technologies were present at the outset 
of modeling, which technologies were 
superseded by other technologies, and 
which technologies were ultimately 
present at the conclusion of modeling. 
For each vehicle, the same file shows 
resultant changes in vehicle weight, fuel 
economy, and cost. This provides for 
efficient identification, analysis, and 
correction of errors, a task with which 
the public can now assist the agency, 
since all inputs and outputs are public. 
Such considerations, as well as those 
related to the efficiency with which the 
Volpe model is able to analyze attribute- 
based CAFE standards and changes in 
vehicle classification, and to perform 
higher-level analysis such as stringency 
estimation (to meet predetermined 
criteria), sensitivity analysis, and 
uncertainty analysis, lead the agency to 
conclude that the model remains the 
best available to the agency for the 
purposes of analyzing potential new 
CAFE standards. 
c. What Changes Has DOT Made to the 
Model? 
Prior to being used for analysis 
supporting today’s proposal, the Volpe 
model was revised to make some minor 
improvements, and to add one 
significant new capability: the ability to 
simulate manufacturers’ ability to 
engage in ‘‘multi-year planning.’’ Multi- 
year planning refers to the fact that 
when redesigning or freshening 
vehicles, manufacturers can anticipate 
future fuel economy or CO2 standards, 
and add technologies accounting for 
these standards. For example, a 
manufacturer might choose to over- 
comply in a given model year when 
many vehicle models are scheduled for 
redesign, in order to facilitate 
compliance in a later model year when 
standards will be more stringent yet few 
vehicle models are scheduled for 
redesign.545 Prior comments have 
indicated that the Volpe model, by not 
representing such manufacturer choices, 
tended to overestimate compliance 
costs. However, because of the technical 
complexity involved in representing 
these choices when, as in the Volpe 
model, each model year is accounted for 
separately and explicitly, the model 
could not be modified to add this 
capability prior to the statutory deadline 
for the MY 2011 final standards. 
The model now includes this 
capability, and NHTSA has applied it in 
analyzing the standards proposed today. 
Consequently, this often produces 
results indicating that manufacturers 
could over-comply in some model years 
(with corresponding increases in costs 
and benefits in those model years) and 
thereby ‘‘carry forward’’ technology into 
later model years in order to reduce 
compliance costs in those later model 
years. NHTSA believes this better 
represents how manufacturers would 
actually respond to new CAFE 
standards, and thereby produces more 
realistic estimates of the costs and 
benefits of such standards. 
The Volpe model has also been 
modified to accommodate inputs 
specifying the amount of CAFE credit to 
be applied to each manufacturer’s fleet. 
Although the model is not currently 
capable of estimating manufacturers’ 
decisions regarding the generation and 
use of CAFE credits, and EPCA does not 
allow NHTSA, in setting CAFE 
standards, to take into account 
manufacturers’ potential use of credits, 
this additional capability in the Volpe 
model provides a basis for more 
accurately estimating costs, effects, and 
benefits that may actually result from 
new CAFE standards. Insofar as some 
manufacturers actually do earn and use 
CAFE credits, this provides NHTSA 
with some ability to examine outcomes 
more realistically than EPCA allows for 
purposes of setting new CAFE 
standards. 
In comments on recent NHTSA 
rulemakings, some reviewers have 
suggested that the Volpe model should 
be modified to estimate the extent to 
which new CAFE standards would 
induce changes in the mix of vehicles in 
the new vehicle fleet. NHTSA, like EPA, 
agrees that a ‘‘market shift’’ model, also 
called a consumer vehicle choice model, 
could provide useful information 
regarding the possible effects of 
potential new CAFE standards. An 
earlier experimental version of the 
Volpe model included a multinomial 
logit model that estimated changes in 
sales resulting from CAFE-induced 
increases in new vehicle fuel economy 
and prices. A fuller description of this 
attempt can be found in Section V of the 
PRIA. However, NHTSA has thus far 
been unable to develop credible 
coefficients specifying such a model. In 
addition, as discussed in Section II.H.4, 
such a model is sensitive to the 
coefficients used in it, and there is great 
variation over some key values of these 
coefficients in published studies. 
NHTSA seeks comment on ways to

the advantages of using attribute-based standards 
and given the goal of coordinating and harmonizing 
the CAFE and CO2 standards as expressed by 
President Obama in his announcement of the new 
National Program and in the joint NOI. 
improve on this earlier work and 
develop this capability effectively. If the 
agency is able to do so prior to 
conducting analysis supporting 
decisions regarding final CAFE 
standards, it will attempt to reintegrate 
this capability in the Volpe model and 
include these effects in its analysis of 
final standards. If not, NHTSA will 
continue efforts to develop and make 
use of this capability in future 
rulemakings. 
d. Does the Model Set the Standards? 
Although NHTSA currently uses the 
Volpe model as a tool to inform its 
consideration of potential CAFE 
standards, the Volpe model does not 
determine the CAFE standards that 
NHTSA proposes or promulgates as 
final regulations. The results it produces 
are completely dependent on inputs 
selected by NHTSA, based on the best 
available information and data available 
in the agency’s estimation at the time 
standards are set. Although the model 
has been programmed in previous 
rulemakings to estimate at what 
stringency net benefits are maximized, 
NHTSA has not done so here and has 
instead used the Volpe model to 
estimate stringency levels that produce 
roughly constant rates of increase in the 
combined average required fuel 
economy. Ultimately, NHTSA’s 
selection of a CAFE standard is 
governed and guided by the statutory 
requirements of EPCA, as amended by 
EISA: NHTSA sets the standard at the 
maximum feasible average fuel economy 
level that it determines is achievable 
during a particular model year, 
considering technological feasibility, 
economic practicability, the effect of 
other standards of the Government on 
fuel economy, and the need of the 
nation to conserve energy. 
NHTSA considers the results of 
analyses conducted by the Volpe model 
and analyses conducted outside of the 
Volpe model, including analysis of the 
impacts of carbon dioxide and criteria 
pollutant emissions, analysis of 
technologies that may be available in 
the long term and whether NHTSA 
could expedite their entry into the 
market through these standards, and 
analysis of the extent to which changes 
in vehicle prices and fuel economy 
might affect vehicle production and 
sales. Using all of this information—not 
solely that from the Volpe model—the 
agency considers the governing 
statutory factors, along with 
environmental issues and other relevant 
societal issues such as safety, and 
promulgates the standards based on its 
best judgment on how to balance these 
factors. 
This is why the agency considered 
eight regulatory alternatives, only one of 
which reflects the agency’s proposed 
standards, based on the agency’s 
determinations and assumptions. Others 
assess alternative standards, some of 
which exceed the proposed standards 
and/or the point at which net benefits 
are maximized. These comprehensive 
analyses, which also included scenarios 
with different economic input 
assumptions as presented in the FEIS 
and FRIA, are intended to inform and 
contribute to the agency’s consideration 
of the ‘‘need of the United States to 
conserve energy,’’ as well as the other 
statutory factors. 49 U.S.C. 32902(f). 
Additionally, the agency’s analysis 
considers the need of the nation to 
conserve energy by accounting for 
economic externalities of petroleum 
consumption and monetizing the 
economic costs of incremental CO2 
emissions in the social cost of carbon. 
NHTSA uses information from the 
model when considering what standards 
to propose and finalize, but the model 
does not determine the standards. 
e. How Does NHTSA Make the Model 
Available and Transparent? 
Model documentation, which is 
publicly available in the rulemaking 
docket and on NHTSA’s web site, 
explains how the model is installed, 
how the model inputs (all of which are 
available to the public) 546 and outputs 
are structured, and how the model is 
used. The model can be used on any 
Windows-based personal computer with 
Microsoft Office 2003 and the Microsoft 
.NET framework installed (the latter 
available without charge from 
Microsoft). The executable version of 
the model and the underlying source 
code are also available at NHTSA’s Web 
site. The input files used to conduct the 
core analysis documented in this 
proposed rule are available in the public 
docket. With the model and these input 
files, anyone is capable of 
independently running the model to 
repeat, evaluate, and/or modify the 
agency’s analysis. 
5. How Did NHTSA Develop the Shape 
of the Target Curves for the Proposed 
Standards? 
In developing the shape of the target 
curves for today’s proposed standards, 
NHTSA took a new approach, primarily 
in response to comments received in the 
MY 2011 rulemaking. NHTSA’s 
authority under EISA allows 
consideration of any ‘‘attribute related 
to fuel economy’’ and any 
‘‘mathematical function.’’ While the 
attribute, footprint, is the same for these 
proposed standards as the attribute used 
for the MY 2011 standards, the 
mathematical function is new. 
Both vehicle manufacturers and 
public interest groups expressed 
concern in the MY 2011 rulemaking 
process that the constrained logistic 
function, particularly the function for 
the passenger car standards, was overly 
steep and could lead, on the one hand, 
to fuel economy targets that were overly 
stringent for small footprint vehicles, 
and on the other hand, to a greater 
incentive for manufacturers to upsize 
vehicles in order to reduce their 
compliance obligation (because larger- 
footprint vehicles have less stringent 
targets) in ways that could compromise 
energy and environmental benefits. We 
tentatively believe that the constrained 
linear function developed here 
significantly mitigates steepness 
concerns, but we seek comment on 
whether readers agree, and whether 
there are any other issues relating to the 
new approach that NHTSA should 
consider in developing the curves for 
the final rule. 
a. Standards Are Attribute-Based and 
Defined by a Mathematical Function 
EPCA, as amended by EISA, expressly 
requires that CAFE standards for 
passenger cars and light trucks be based 
on one or more vehicle attributes related 
to fuel economy, and be expressed in 
the form of a mathematical function.547 
Like the MY 2011 standards, the MY 
2012–2016 passenger car and light truck 
standards are attribute-based and 
defined by a mathematical function.548 
Also like the MY 2011 standards, the 
MY 2012–2016 standards are based on 
the footprint attribute. However, unlike 
the MY 2011 standards, the MY 2012– 
2016 standards are defined by a 
constrained linear rather than a 
constrained logistic function. The 
reasons for these similarities and 
differences are explained below. 
As discussed above in Section II, 
under attribute-based standards, the 
fleet-wide average fuel economy that a 
particular manufacturer must achieve in 
a given model year depends on the mix 
of vehicles that it produces for sale.

49685 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
549 The 2002 NAS Report described at length and 
quantified the potential safety problem with average 
fuel economy standards that specify a single 
numerical requirement for the entire industry. See 
NAS Report at 5, finding 12. 
550 Id. at 4–5, finding 10. 
551 74 FR 14409–14412 (Mar. 30, 2009). 
Until NHTSA began to set ‘‘Reformed’’ 
attribute-based standards for light trucks 
in MYs 2008–2011, and until EISA gave 
NHTSA authority to set attribute-based 
standards for passenger cars beginning 
in MY 2011, NHTSA set ‘‘universal’’ or 
‘‘flat’’ industry-wide average CAFE 
standards. Attribute-based standards are 
preferable to universal industry-wide 
average standards for several reasons. 
First, attribute-based standards increase 
fuel savings and reduce emissions when 
compared to an equivalent universal 
industry-wide standard under which 
each manufacturer is subject to the same 
numerical requirement. Absent a policy 
to require all full-line manufacturers to 
produce and sell essentially the same 
mix of vehicles, the stringency of the 
universal industry-wide standards is 
constrained by the capability of those 
full-line manufacturers whose product 
mix includes a relatively high 
proportion of larger and heavier 
vehicles. In effect, the standards are 
based on the mix of those 
manufacturers. As a result, the 
standards are generally set below the 
capabilities of full-line and limited-line 
manufacturers that sell predominantly 
lighter and smaller vehicles. 
Under an attribute-based system, in 
contrast, every manufacturer is more 
likely to be required to continue adding 
more fuel-saving technology each year 
because the level of the compliance 
obligation of each manufacturer is based 
on its own particular product mix. 
Thus, the compliance obligation of a 
manufacturer with a higher percentage 
of lighter and smaller vehicles will have 
a higher compliance obligation than a 
manufacturer with a lower percentage of 
such vehicles. As a result, all 
manufacturers must use technologies to 
enhance the fuel economy levels of the 
vehicles they sell. Therefore, fuel 
savings and CO2 emissions reductions 
should be higher under an attribute- 
based system than under a comparable 
industry-wide standard. 
Second, attribute-based standards 
minimize the incentive for 
manufacturers to respond to CAFE in 
ways harmful to safety.549 Because each 
vehicle model has its own target (based 
on the attribute chosen), attribute-based 
standards provide no incentive to build 
smaller vehicles simply to meet a fleet- 
wide average. Since smaller vehicles are 
subject to more stringent fuel economy 
targets, a manufacturer’s increasing its 
proportion of smaller vehicles would 
simply cause its compliance obligation 
to increase. 
Third, attribute-based standards 
provide a more equitable regulatory 
framework for different vehicle 
manufacturers.550 A universal industry- 
wide average standard imposes 
disproportionate cost burdens and 
compliance difficulties on the 
manufacturers that need to change their 
product plans and no obligation on 
those manufacturers that have no need 
to change their plans. Attribute-based 
standards spread the regulatory cost 
burden for fuel economy more broadly 
across all of the vehicle manufacturers 
within the industry. 
And fourth, attribute-based standards 
respect economic conditions and 
consumer choice, instead of having the 
government mandate a certain fleet mix. 
Manufacturers are required to invest in 
technologies that improve the fuel 
economy of their fleets, regardless of 
vehicle mix. Additionally, attribute- 
based standards help to avoid the need 
to conduct rulemakings to amend 
standards if economic conditions 
change, causing a shift in the mix of 
vehicles demanded by the public. 
NHTSA conducted three rulemakings 
during the 1980s to amend passenger 
car standards for MYs 1986–1989 in 
response to unexpected drops in fuel 
prices and resulting shifts in consumer 
demand that made the passenger car 
standard of 27.5 mpg infeasible for 
several years following the change in 
fuel prices. 
As discussed above in Section II, for 
purposes of the CAFE standards 
proposed in this NPRM, NHTSA 
recognizes that the risk, even if small, 
does exist that low fuel prices in MYs 
2012–2016 might lead indirectly to less 
than currently anticipated fuel savings 
and emissions reductions. Thus, we 
seek comment on whether backstop 
standards, or any other method within 
the agencies’ statutory authority, should 
and can be implemented for the import 
and light truck fleets in order to achieve 
the fuel savings that attribute-based 
standards might not absolutely 
guarantee. Commenters are encouraged, 
but not required, to review and respond 
to NHTSA’s discussion of this issue in 
the MY 2011 final rule as a starting 
point.551 
b. What Attribute Does NHTSA Use, and 
Why? 
Consistent with the MY 2011 CAFE 
standards, NHTSA is proposing to use 
footprint as the attribute for the MY 
2012–2016 CAFE standards. There are 
several policy reasons why NHTSA and 
EPA both believe that footprint is the 
most appropriate attribute on which to 
base the standards, as discussed below. 
As discussed in the PRIA, in 
NHTSA’s judgment, from the standpoint 
of vehicle safety, it is important that the 
CAFE standards be set in a way that 
does not encourage manufacturers to 
respond by selling vehicles that are in 
any way less safe. While NHTSA’s 
research also indicates that reductions 
in vehicle mass tend to compromise 
vehicle safety, footprint-based standards 
provide an incentive to use advanced 
lightweight materials and structures that 
would be discouraged by weight-based 
standards, because manufacturers can 
use them to improve a vehicle’s fuel 
economy without their use necessarily 
resulting in a change in the vehicle’s 
target level of fuel economy. 
Further, although we recognize that 
weight is better correlated with fuel 
economy than is footprint, we continue 
to believe that there is less risk of 
‘‘gaming’’ (artificial manipulation of the 
attribute(s) to achieve a more favorable 
target) by increasing footprint under 
footprint-based standards than by 
increasing vehicle mass under weight- 
based standards—it is relatively easy for 
a manufacturer to add enough weight to 
a vehicle to decrease its applicable fuel 
economy target a significant amount, as 
compared to increasing vehicle 
footprint. We also agree with concerns 
raised in 2008 by some commenters in 
the MY 2011 CAFE rulemaking that 
there would be greater potential for 
gaming under multi-attribute standards, 
such as standards under which targets 
would also depend on attributes such as 
weight, torque, power, towing 
capability, and/or off-road capability. 
Standards that incorporate such 
attributes in conjunction with footprint 
would not only be significantly more 
complex, but by providing degrees of 
freedom with respect to more easily- 
adjusted attributes, they would make it 
less certain that the future fleet would 
actually achieve the projected average 
fuel economy and CO2 reduction levels. 
However, while NHTSA tentatively 
concludes that footprint is the most 
appropriate attribute upon which to 
base the proposed standards, 
recognizing strong public interest in this 
issue, we seek comment on whether the 
agency should consider setting 
standards for the final rule based on 
another attribute or another 
combination of attributes. If commenters 
suggest that the agency should consider 
another attribute or another 
combination of attributes, the agency 
specifically requests that the 
commenters address the concerns raised

in the paragraphs above regarding the 
use of other attributes, and explain how 
standards should be developed using 
the other attribute(s) in a way that 
contributes more to fuel savings and 
CO2 reductions than the footprint-based 
standards, without compromising 
safety. 
c. What Mathematical Function Did 
NHTSA Use for the Recently- 
Promulgated MY 2011 CAFE Standards? 
The MY 2011 CAFE standards are 
defined by a continuous, constrained 
logistic function, which takes the form 
of an S-curve, and is defined according 
to the following formula: 
TARGET
e
FOOTPRINT c
FOOTPRINT c
=
+ −
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟ +
−( )
−( )
1
1 1 1
1a b a
e d
d
Here, TARGET is the fuel economy target 
(in mpg) applicable to vehicles of a given 
footprint (FOOTPRINT, in square feet), b and 
a are the function’s lower and upper 
asymptotes (also in mpg), e is approximately 
equal to 2.718,552 c is the footprint (in square 
feet) at which the inverse of the fuel economy 
target falls halfway between the inverses of 
the lower and upper asymptotes, and d is a 
parameter (in square feet) that determines 
how gradually the fuel economy target 
transitions from the upper toward the lower 
asymptote as the footprint increases. 
After fitting this mathematical form 
(separately) to the passenger car and 
light truck fleets and determining the 
stringency of the standards (i.e., the 
vertical positions of the curves), NHTSA 
arrived at the following curves to define 
the MY 2011 standards: 
d. What Mathematical Function is 
NHTSA Proposing to Use for New CAFE 
Standards, and Why? 
In finalizing the MY 2011 standards, 
NHTSA noted that the agency is not 
required to use a constrained logistic 
function and indicated that the agency 
may consider defining future CAFE 
standards in terms of a different 
mathematical function. NHTSA has 
done so in preparation for the proposed 
CAFE standards. 
In revisiting this question, NHTSA 
found that the final MY 2011 CAFE 
standard for passenger cars, though less

553 The agencies excluded diesel engines and 
strong hybrid vehicle technologies from this 
exercise (and only this exercise) because the 
agencies expect that manufacturers would not need 
to rely heavily on these technologies in order to 
comply with the proposed standards. NHTSA and 
EPA did include diesel engines and strong hybrid 
vehicle technologies in all other portions of their 
analyses. 
554 EISA added the following additional 
requirements. Standards must be attribute-based 
and expressed in the form of a mathematical 
function. 49 U.S.C. 32902(b)(3)(A). Standards for 
MYs 2011–2020 must ‘‘increase ratably’’ in each 
model year. 49 U.S.C. 32902(b)(2)(C). NHTSA 
interprets this requirement, in combination with the 
requirement to set the standards for each model 
year at the level determined to be the maximum 
feasible level for that model year, to mean that the 
annual increases should not be disproportionately 
large or small in relation to each other. 
555 49 U.S.C. 32902(b)(2)(A). 
steep than the MY 2011 standard 
NHTSA proposed in 2008, continues to 
concentrate the sloped portion of the 
curve (from a compliance perspective, 
the area in which upsizing results in a 
slightly lower applicable target) within 
a relatively narrow footprint range 
(approximately 47–55 square feet). 
Further, most passenger car models 
have footprints smaller than the curve’s 
51.4 square foot inflection point, and 
many passenger car models have 
footprints at which the curve is 
relatively flat. 
For both passenger cars and light 
trucks, a mathematical function that has 
some slope at most footprints where 
vehicles are produced is advantageous 
in terms of fairly balancing regulatory 
burdens among manufacturers, and in 
terms of providing a disincentive to 
respond to new standards by 
downsizing vehicles in ways that 
compromise vehicle safety. For 
example, a flat standard may be very 
difficult for a full-line manufacturer to 
meet, while requiring very little of a 
manufacturer concentrating on small 
vehicles, and a flat standard may 
provide an incentive to manufacturers 
to downsize certain vehicles, in order to 
‘‘balance out’’ other vehicles subject to 
the same standard. 
As a potential alternative to the 
constrained logistic function, NHTSA 
had, in proposing MY 2011 standards, 
presented information regarding a 
constrained linear function. As shown 
in the 2008 NPRM, a constrained linear 
function has the potential to avoid 
creating a localized region (in terms of 
vehicle footprint) over which the slope 
of the function is relatively steep. 
Although NHTSA did not receive public 
comments on this option, the agency 
indicated that it still believed a linear 
function constrained by upper (on a 
gpm basis) and possibly lower limits 
could merit reconsideration in future 
CAFE rulemakings. 
Having re-examined a constrained 
linear function for purposes of the 
proposed standards, NHTSA tentatively 
concludes that for both passenger cars 
and light trucks, it remains 
meaningfully sloped over a wide 
footprint range, thereby providing a 
well-distributed disincentive to 
downsize vehicles in ways that could 
compromise highway safety. Further, 
the constrained linear function 
proposed today is not so steeply sloped 
that it would provide a strong incentive 
to increase vehicle size in order to 
obtain a lower CAFE requirement and 
higher CO2 limit, thereby compromising 
energy and environmental benefits. 
Therefore, the CAFE standards proposed 
today are defined by constrained linear 
functions. 
The constrained linear function is 
defined according to the following 
formula: 
TARGET
MIN MAX c FOOTPRINT d,
=
× +
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥
1
1 1
a b
,
Here, TARGET is the fuel economy target 
(in mpg) applicable to vehicles of a given 
footprint (FOOTPRINT, in square feet), b and 
a are the function’s lower and upper 
asymptotes (also in mpg), respectively, c is 
the slope (in gpm per square foot) of the 
sloped portion of the function, and d is the 
intercept (in gpm) of the sloped portion of 
the function (that is, the value the sloped 
portion would take if extended to a footprint 
of 0 square feet. The MIN and MAX functions 
take the minimum and maximum, 
respectively of the included values; for 
example, MIN(1,2) = 1, MAX(1,2) = 2, and 
MIN[MAX(1,2),3)]=2. The following chart 
shows an example of a linear target function, 
where a = 0.0241 gpm (41.6 mpg), b = 0.032 
gpm (31.2 mpg), c = 0.000531 gpm per square 
foot, and d = 0.002292 gpm (436 mpg). 
Because the function is linear on a gpm basis, 
not an mpg basis, it is plotted on this basis. 
e. How Did NHTSA Fit the Coefficients 
That Determine the Shape of the 
Proposed Curves? 
For purposes of this NPRM, and for 
EPA’s use in developing new CO2 
emissions standards, the basic curve 
shapes were developed using methods 
similar to those applied by NHTSA in 
fitting the curves defining the MY 2011 
standards. We began with the market 
inputs discussed above, but because the 
baseline fleet is technologically 
heterogeneous, NHTSA used the CAFE 
model to develop a fleet to which nearly 
all the technologies discussed in Section 
V of the PRIA and Chapter 3 of the joint 
TSD 553 were applied, by taking the 
following steps: (1) Treating all 
manufacturers as unwilling to pay civil 
penalties rather than applying 
technology, (2) applying any technology 
at any time, irrespective of scheduled 
vehicle redesigns or freshening, and (3) 
ignoring ‘‘phase-in caps’’ that constrain 
the overall amount of technology that 
can be applied by the model to a given 
manufacturer’s fleet. These steps helped 
to increase technological parity among 
vehicle models, thereby providing a 
better basis (than the baseline fleet) for 
estimating the statistical relationship 
between vehicle size and fuel economy. 
More information on the process for 
fitting the passenger car and light truck 
curves for MYs 2012–2016 is available 
above in Section II.C, and NHTSA refers 
the reader to that section and to Chapter 
2 of the joint TSD. NHTSA seeks 
comment on this approach to fitting the 
curves. We note that final decisions on 
this issue will play an important role in 
determining the form and stringency of 
the final CAFE and CO2 standards, the 
incentives those standards will provide 
(e.g., with respect to downsizing small 
vehicles), and the relative compliance 
burden faced by each manufacturer. 
D. Statutory Requirements 
1. EPCA, as Amended by EISA 
a. Standard Setting 
NHTSA must establish separate 
standards for MY 2011–2020 passenger 
cars and light trucks, subject to two 
principal requirements.554 First, the 
standards are subject to a minimum 
requirement regarding stringency: They 
must be set at levels high enough to 
ensure that the combined U.S. passenger 
car and light truck fleet achieves an 
average fuel economy level of not less 
than 35 mpg not later than MY 2020.555 
Second, as discussed above and at 
length in the March 2009 final rule 
establishing the MY 2011 CAFE 
standards, EPCA requires that the

agency establish standards for all new 
passenger cars and light trucks at the 
maximum feasible average fuel economy 
level that the Secretary decides the 
manufacturers can achieve in that 
model year.556 The implication of this 
second requirement is that it calls for 
exceeding the minimum requirement if 
the agency determines that the 
manufacturers can achieve a higher 
level. When determining the level 
achievable by the manufacturers, EPCA 
requires that the agency consider the 
four statutory factors of technological 
feasibility, economic practicability, the 
effect of other motor vehicle standards 
of the Government on fuel economy, 
and the need of the United States to 
conserve energy. In addition, the agency 
has the authority to and traditionally 
does consider other relevant factors, 
such as the effect of the CAFE standards 
on motor vehicle safety. 
i. Statutory Factors Considered in 
Determining the Achievable Level of 
Average Fuel Economy 
As none of the four factors is defined 
in EPCA and each remains interpreted 
only to a limited degree by case law, 
NHTSA has considerable latitude in 
interpreting them. NHTSA interprets the 
four statutory factors as set forth below. 
(1) Technological Feasibility 
‘‘Technological feasibility’’ refers to 
whether a particular technology for 
improving fuel economy is available or 
can become available for commercial 
application in the model year for which 
a standard is being established. Thus, 
the agency is not limited in determining 
the level of new standards to technology 
that is already being commercially 
applied at the time of the rulemaking. It 
can, instead, set technology-forcing 
standards, i.e., ones that make it 
necessary for manufacturers to engage in 
research and development in order to 
bring a new technology to market. 
(2) Economic Practicability 
‘‘Economic practicability’’ refers to 
whether a standard is one ‘‘within the 
financial capability of the industry, but 
not so stringent as to’’ lead to ‘‘adverse 
economic consequences, such as a 
significant loss of jobs or the 
unreasonable elimination of consumer 
choice.’’ 557 In an attempt to ensure the 
economic practicability, the agency 
considers a variety of factors, including 
the annual rate at which manufacturers 
can increase the percentage of its fleet 
that has a particular type of fuel saving 
technology, and cost to consumers. 
Consumer acceptability is also an 
element of economic practicability. 
At the same time, the law does not 
preclude a CAFE standard that poses 
considerable challenges to any 
individual manufacturer. The 
Conference Report for EPCA, as enacted 
in 1975, makes clear, and the case law 
affirms, ‘‘(A) determination of maximum 
feasible average fuel economy should 
not be keyed to the single manufacturer 
which might have the most difficulty 
achieving a given level of average fuel 
economy.’’ 558 Instead, the agency is 
compelled ‘‘to weigh the benefits to the 
nation of a higher fuel economy 
standard against the difficulties of 
individual automobile manufacturers.’’ 
Id. The law permits CAFE standards 
exceeding the projected capability of 
any particular manufacturer as long as 
the standard is economically practicable 
for the industry as a whole. Thus, while 
a particular CAFE standard may pose 
difficulties for one manufacturer, it may 
also present opportunities for another. 
The CAFE program is not necessarily 
intended to maintain the competitive 
positioning of each particular company. 
Rather, it is intended to enhance fuel 
economy of the vehicle fleet on 
American roads, while protecting motor 
vehicle safety and being mindful of the 
risk of harm to the overall United States 
economy. 
Thus, NHTSA believes that this term 
must be applied in the context of the 
competing concerns associated with 
different levels of standards. Prior to 
switching to attribute-based standards 
in the MY 2008–2011 rulemaking, the 
agency sought to ensure the economy 
practicability of standards in part by 
setting them at or near the capability of 
the ‘‘least capable manufacturer’’ with a 
significant share of the market, i.e., 
typically the manufacturer whose 
vehicles are, on average, the heaviest 
and largest. In the first several 
rulemakings to establish attribute based 
standards, the agency applied marginal 
cost benefit analysis. This ensured that 
the agency’s application of technologies 
was limited to those that would pay for 
themselves and thus would have 
significant appeal to consumers. 
However, the agency can and has 
limited its application of technologies to 
those technologies, with or without the 
use of such analysis. 
(3) The Effect of Other Motor Vehicle 
Standards of the Government on Fuel 
Economy 
‘‘The effect of other motor vehicle 
standards of the Government on fuel 
economy,’’ involves an analysis of the 
effects of compliance with emission,559 
safety, noise, or damageability standards 
on fuel economy capability and thus on 
average fuel economy. In previous CAFE 
rulemakings, the agency has said that 
pursuant to this provision, it considers 
the adverse effects of other motor 
vehicle standards on fuel economy. It 
said so because, from the CAFE 
program’s earliest years 560 until 
present, the effects of such compliance 
on fuel economy capability over the 
history of the CAFE program have been 
negative ones. In those instances in 
which the effects are negative, NHTSA 
is called upon to ‘‘mak[e] a 
straightforward adjustment to the fuel 
economy improvement projections to 
account for the impacts of other Federal 
standards, principally those in the areas 
of emission control, occupant safety, 
vehicle damageability, and vehicle 
noise. However, only the unavoidable 
consequences should be accounted for. 
The automobile manufacturers must be 
expected to adopt those feasible 
methods of achieving compliance with 
other Federal standards which minimize 
any adverse fuel economy effects of 
those standards.’’ 561 For example, 
safety standards that have the effect of 
increasing vehicle weight lower vehicle 
fuel economy capability and thus 
decrease the level of average fuel 
economy that the agency can determine 
to be feasible. 
The ‘‘other motor vehicle standards’’ 
consideration has thus in practice 
functioned in a fashion similar to the 
provision in EPCA, as originally 
enacted, for adjusting the statutorily- 
specified CAFE standards for MY 1978– 
1980 passengers cars.562 EPCA did not 
permit NHTSA to amend those 
standards based on a finding that the 
maximum feasible level of average fuel 
economy for any of those three years 
was greater or less than the standard 
specified for that year. Instead, it 
provided that the agency could only 
reduce the standards and only on one 
basis: if the agency found that there had 
been a Federal standards fuel economy 
reduction, i.e., a reduction in fuel 
economy due to changes in the Federal 
vehicle standards, e.g., emissions and 
safety, relative to the year of enactment, 
1975.

49689 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
563 42 FR 63184, 63188 (1977). 
564 See 74 FR 14396–14407 (Mar. 30, 2009). 
565 49 U.S.C. 32902(h). 
The ‘‘other motor vehicle standards’’ 
provision is broader than the Federal 
standards fuel economy reduction 
provision. Although the effects analyzed 
to date under the ‘‘other motor vehicle 
standards’’ provision have been 
negative, there could be circumstances 
in which the effects are positive. In the 
event that the agency encountered such 
circumstances, it would be required to 
consider those positive effects. For 
example, if changes in vehicle safety 
technology led to NHTSA’s amending a 
safety standard in a way that permits 
manufacturers to reduce the weight 
added in complying with that standard, 
that weight reduction would increase 
vehicle fuel economy capability and 
thus increase the level of average fuel 
economy that could be determined to be 
feasible. 
In the wake of Massachusetts v. EPA 
and of EPA’s proposed endangerment 
finding, granting of a waiver to 
California for its motor vehicle GHG 
standards, and its own proposal of GHG 
standards, the agency is confronted with 
the issue of how to treat those standards 
under the ‘‘other motor vehicle 
standards’’ provision. To the extent the 
GHG standards result in increases in 
fuel economy, they would do so almost 
exclusively as a result of inducing 
manufacturers to install the same types 
of technologies used by manufacturers 
in complying with the CAFE standards. 
The primary exception would involve 
increases in the efficiency of air 
conditioners. 
Thus, NHTSA tentatively concludes 
that the effects of the EPA and 
California standards are neither positive 
nor negative because the proposed rule 
results in consistent standards among 
all components of the National Program. 
Comment is requested on whether and 
in what way the effects of the California 
and EPA standards should be 
considered under the ‘‘other motor 
vehicle standards’’ provision or other 
provisions of EPCA in 49 U.S.C. 32902, 
consistent with NHTSA’s independent 
obligation under EPCA/EISA to issue 
CAFE standards? The agency has 
already considered EPA’s proposal and 
the harmonization benefits of the 
National Program in developing its own 
proposal. 
(4) The Need of the United States To 
Conserve Energy 
‘‘The need of the United States to 
conserve energy’’ means ‘‘the consumer 
cost, national balance of payments, 
environmental, and foreign policy 
implications of our need for large 
quantities of petroleum, especially 
imported petroleum.’’ 563 Environmental 
implications principally include those 
associated with reductions in emissions 
of criteria pollutants and CO2. A prime 
example of foreign policy implications 
are energy independence and security 
concerns. 
ii. Other Factors Considered by NHTSA 
The agency historically has 
considered the potential for adverse 
safety consequences in setting CAFE 
standards. This practice is recognized 
approvingly in case law. As the courts 
have recognized, ‘‘NHTSA has always 
examined the safety consequences of the 
CAFE standards in its overall 
consideration of relevant factors since 
its earliest rulemaking under the CAFE 
program.’’ Competitive Enterprise 
Institute v. NHTSA, 901 F.2d 107, 120 
n. 11 (DC Cir. 1990) (‘‘CEI I’’) (citing 42 
Fed. Reg. 33534, 33551 (June 30, 1977)). 
The courts have consistently upheld 
NHTSA’s implementation of EPCA in 
this manner. See, e.g., Competitive 
Enterprise Institute v. NHTSA, 956 F.2d 
321, 322 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (‘‘CEI II’’) (in 
determining the maximum feasible fuel 
economy standard, ‘‘NHTSA has always 
taken passenger safety into account.’’) 
(citing CEI I, 901 F.2d at 120 n. 11); 
Competitive Enterprise Institute v. 
NHTSA, 45 F.3d 481, 482–83 (D.C. Cir. 
1995) (‘‘CEI III’’) (same); Center for 
Biological Diversity v. NHTSA, 538 F.3d 
1172, 1203–04 (9th Cir. 2008) 
(upholding NHTSA’s analysis of vehicle 
safety issues associated with weight in 
connection with the MY 2008–11 light 
truck CAFE rule). Thus, in evaluating 
what levels of stringency would result 
in maximum feasible standards, NHTSA 
assesses the potential safety impacts and 
considers them in balancing the 
statutory considerations and to 
determine the appropriate level of the 
standards. 
Under the universal or ‘‘flat’’ CAFE 
standards that NHTSA was previously 
authorized to establish, the primary risk 
to safety came from the possibility that 
manufacturers would respond to higher 
standards by building smaller, less safe 
vehicles in order to ‘‘balance out’’ the 
larger, safer vehicles that the public 
generally preferred to buy. Under the 
attribute-based standards being 
proposed today, that risk is reduced 
because building smaller vehicles 
would tend to raise a manufacturer’s 
overall CAFE obligation, rather than 
only raising its fleet average CAFE. 
However, even if the manufacturers did 
not engage in any downsizing under 
attribute-based standards, there is still 
the possibility that manufacturers 
would rely on downweighting to 
improve their fuel economy (for a given 
vehicle at a given footprint target) in 
ways that may reduce safety to a greater 
or lesser extent. While NHTSA 
recognizes that manufacturers may 
nonetheless choose this option for 
raising their CAFE levels, in prior 
rulemakings we have limited the 
application of downweighting/material 
substitution in our modeling analysis to 
vehicles over 5,000 lbs GVWR.564 
For purposes of today’s proposed 
standards, however, NHTSA has revised 
its modeling analysis to allow some 
application of downweighting/material 
substitution for all vehicles, including 
those under 5,000 lbs GVWR, because 
we believe that this is more consistent 
with how manufacturers will actually 
respond to the standards. However, as 
discussed above, NHTSA does not 
mandate the use of any particular 
technology by manufacturers in meeting 
the standards. More information on the 
new approach to modeling 
manufacturer use of downweighting/ 
material substitution is available in 
Chapter 3 of the draft joint TSD and in 
Section V of the PRIA; and the 
estimated safety impacts that may be 
due to the proposed standards are 
described below. 
iii. Factors That NHTSA Is Prohibited 
From Considering 
EPCA also provides that in 
determining the level at which it should 
set CAFE standards for a particular 
model year, NHTSA may not consider 
the ability of manufacturers to take 
advantage of several EPCA provisions 
that facilitate compliance with the 
CAFE standards and thereby reduce the 
costs of compliance.565 As discussed 
further below, manufacturers can earn 
compliance credits by exceeding the 
CAFE standards and then use those 
credits to achieve compliance in years 
in which their measured average fuel 
economy falls below the standards. 
Manufacturers can also increase their 
CAFE levels through MY 2019 by 
producing alternative fuel vehicles. 
EPCA provides an incentive for 
producing these vehicles by specifying 
that their fuel economy is to be 
determined using a special calculation 
procedure that results in those vehicles 
being assigned a high fuel economy 
level. 
The effect of the prohibitions against 
considering these flexibilities in setting 
the CAFE standards is that the 
flexibilities remain voluntarily- 
employed measures. If the agency were

instead to assume manufacturer use of 
those flexibilities in setting new 
standards, that assumption would result 
in higher standards and thus tend to 
require manufacturers to use those 
flexibilities. 
iv. Determining the Level of the 
Standards by Balancing the Factors 
NHTSA has broad discretion in 
balancing the above factors in 
determining the appropriate levels of 
average fuel economy at which to set the 
CAFE standards for each model year. 
Congress ‘‘specifically delegated the 
process of setting * * * fuel economy 
standards with broad guidelines 
concerning the factors that the agency 
must consider.’’ 566 The breadth of those 
guidelines, the absence of any 
statutorily prescribed formula for 
balancing the factors, the fact that the 
relative weight to be given to the various 
factors may change from rulemaking to 
rulemaking as the underlying facts 
change, and the fact that the factors may 
often be conflicting with respect to 
whether they militate toward higher or 
lower standards give NHTSA discretion 
to decide what weight to give each of 
the competing policies and concerns 
and then determine how to balance 
them. The exercise of that discretion is 
subject to the necessity of ensuring that 
NHTSA’s balancing does not undermine 
the fundamental purpose of the EPCA: 
Energy conservation,567 and as long as 
that balancing reasonably 
accommodates ‘‘conflicting policies that 
were committed to the agency’s care by 
the statute.’’ 568 The balancing of the 
factors in any given rulemaking is 
highly dependent on the factual and 
policy context of that rulemaking. Given 
the changes over time in facts bearing 
on assessment of the various factors, 
such as those relating to the economic 
conditions, fuel prices and the state of 
climate change science, the agency 
recognizes that what was a reasonable 
balancing of competing statutory 
priorities in one rulemaking may not be 
a reasonable balancing of those 
priorities in another rulemaking.569 
Nevertheless, the agency retains 
substantial discretion under EPCA to 
choose among reasonable alternatives. 
EPCA neither requires nor precludes 
the use of any type of cost-benefit 
analysis as a tool to help inform the 
balancing process. While NHTSA used 
marginal cost-benefit analysis in the 
first two rulemakings to establish 
attribute-based CAFE standards, it was 
not required to do so and is not required 
to continue to do so. Regardless of what 
type of analysis is or is not used, 
considerations relating to costs and 
benefits remain an important part of 
CAFE standard setting. 
Because the relevant considerations 
and factors can reasonably be balanced 
in a variety of ways under EPCA, and 
because of uncertainties associated with 
the many technological and cost inputs, 
NHTSA considers a wide variety of 
alternative sets of standards, each 
reflecting different balancing of those 
policies and concerns, to aid it in 
discerning reasonable outcomes. Among 
the alternatives providing for an 
increase in the standards in this 
rulemaking, the alternatives range in 
stringency from a set of standards that 
increase, on average, 3 percent annually 
to a set of standards that increase, on 
average, 7 percent annually. 
2. Administrative Procedure Act 
To be upheld under the ‘‘arbitrary and 
capricious’’ standard of judicial review 
in the APA, an agency rule must be 
rational, based on consideration of the 
relevant factors, and within the scope of 
the authority delegated to the agency by 
the statute. The agency must examine 
the relevant data and articulate a 
satisfactory explanation for its action 
including a ‘‘rational connection 
between the facts found and the choice 
made.’’ Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. 
United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962). 
Statutory interpretations included in 
an agency’s rule are subjected to the 
two-step analysis of Chevron, U.S.A., 
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 
81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Under step one, 
where a statute ‘‘has directly spoken to 
the precise question at issue,’’ id. at 842, 
104 S.Ct. 2778, the court and the agency 
‘‘must give effect to the unambiguously 
expressed intent of Congress,’’ id. at 
843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If the statute is 
silent or ambiguous regarding the 
specific question, the court proceeds to 
step two and asks ‘‘whether the agency’s 
answer is based on a permissible 
construction of the statute.’’ Id. 
If an agency’s interpretation differs 
from the one that it has previously 
adopted, the agency need not 
demonstrate that the prior position was 
wrong or even less desirable. Rather, the 
agency would need only to demonstrate 
that its new position is consistent with 
the statute and supported by the record, 
and acknowledge that this is a departure 
from past positions. The Supreme Court 
emphasized this recently in FCC v. Fox 
Television, 129 S.Ct. 1800 (2009). When 
an agency changes course from earlier 
regulations, ‘‘the requirement that an 
agency provide reasoned explanation for 
its action would ordinarily demand that 
it display awareness that it is changing 
position,’’ but ‘‘need not demonstrate to 
a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for 
the new policy are better than the 
reasons for the old one; it suffices that 
the new policy is permissible under the 
statute, that there are good reasons for 
it, and that the agency believes it to be 
better, which the conscious change of 
course adequately indicates.’’ 570 
3. National Environmental Policy Act 
As discussed above, EPCA requires 
the agency to determine what level at 
which to set the CAFE standards for 
each model year by considering the four 
factors of technological feasibility, 
economic practicability, the effect of 
other motor vehicle standards of the 
Government on fuel economy, and the 
need of the United States to conserve 
energy. NEPA directs that 
environmental considerations be 
integrated into that process. To 
accomplish that purpose, NEPA requires 
an agency to compare the potential 
environmental impacts of its proposed 
action to those of a reasonable range of 
alternatives. 
To explore the environmental 
consequences in depth, NHTSA has 
prepared a draft environmental impact 
statement. The purpose of an EIS is to 
‘‘provide full and fair discussion of 
significant environmental impacts and 
[to] inform decisionmakers and the 
public of the reasonable alternatives 
which would avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts or enhance the quality of the 
human environment.’’ 40 CFR 1502.1. 
NEPA is ‘‘a procedural statute that 
mandates a process rather than a 
particular result.’’ Stewart Park & 
Reserve Coal., Inc. v. Slater, 352 F.3d at 
557. The agency’s overall EIS-related 
obligation is to ‘‘take a ‘hard look’ at the 
environmental consequences before 
taking a major action.’’ Baltimore Gas & 
Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 
Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97, 103 S.Ct. 2246, 76 
L.Ed.2d 437 (1983). Significantly, ‘‘[i]f 
the adverse environmental effects of the 
proposed action are adequately 
identified and evaluated, the agency is 
not constrained by NEPA from deciding 
that other values outweigh the 
environmental costs.’’ Robertson v. 
Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 
U.S. 332, 350, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 
L.Ed.2d 351 (1989).

49691 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
571 Required CAFE levels shown here are 
estimated required levels based on NHTSA’s 
current projection of manufacturers’ vehicle fleets 
in MYs 2012–2016. Actual required levels are not 
determined until the end of each model year, when 
all of the vehicles produced by a manufacturer in 
that model year are known and their compliance 
obligation can be determined with certainty. The 
target curves, as defined by the constrained linear 
function, and as embedded in the function for the 
sales-weighted harmonic average, are the real 
‘‘standards’’ being proposed today. 
The agency must identify the 
‘‘environmentally preferable’’ 
alternative, but need not adopt it. 
‘‘Congress in enacting NEPA * * * did 
not require agencies to elevate 
environmental concerns over other 
appropriate considerations.’’ Baltimore 
Gas and Elec. Co. v. Natural Resources 
Defense Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 
(1983). Instead, NEPA requires an 
agency to develop alternatives to the 
proposed action in preparing an EIS. 42 
U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(iii). The statute does 
not command the agency to favor an 
environmentally preferable course of 
action, only that it make its decision to 
proceed with the action after taking a 
hard look at environmental 
consequences. 
E. What Are the Proposed CAFE 
Standards? 
1. Form of the Standards 
Each of the CAFE standards that 
NHTSA is proposing today for 
passenger cars and light trucks is 
expressed as a mathematical function 
that defines a fuel economy target 
applicable to each vehicle model and, 
for each fleet, establishes a required 
CAFE level determined by computing 
the sales-weighted harmonic average of 
those targets.571 
As discussed above in Section II.C, 
NHTSA is proposing to determine fuel 
economy targets using a constrained 
linear function defined according to the 
following formula: 
TARGET
MIN MAX c FOOTPRINT d,
=
× +
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥
1
1 1
a b
,
Here, TARGET is the fuel economy target 
(in mpg) applicable to vehicles of a given 
footprint (FOOTPRINT, in square feet), b and 
a are the function’s lower and upper 
asymptotes (also in mpg), respectively, c is 
the slope (in gpm per square foot) of the 
sloped portion of the function, and d is the 
intercept (in gpm) of the sloped portion of 
the function (that is, the value the sloped 
portion would take if extended to a footprint 
of 0 square feet). The MIN and MAX 
functions take the minimum and maximum, 
respectively of the included values. 
As also discussed in Section II.C, 
under the proposed standards (as under 
the recently-promulgated MY 2011 
standards), the CAFE level required of 
any given manufacturer will be 
determined by calculating the 
production-weighted harmonic average 
of the fuel economy targets applicable to 
each vehicle model: 
CAFE
SALES
SALES
TARGET
required
i
i
i
=
∑
∑
i
i
Here, CAFErequired is the required level for 
a given fleet, SALESi is the number of units 
of model i produced for sale in the United 
States, TARGETi is the fuel economy target 
applicable to model i (according to the 
equation shown in Chapter II and based on 
the footprint of model i), and the summations 
in the numerator and denominator are both 
performed over all models in the fleet in 
question. 
The proposed standards are, therefore, 
specified by the four coefficients 
defining fuel economy targets: 
a = upper limit (mpg) 
b = lower limit (mpg) 
c = slope (gpm per square foot) 
d = intercept (gpm) 
The values of the coefficients are 
different for the passenger car standards 
and the light truck standards. 
2. Passenger Car Standards for MYs 
2012–2016 
For passenger cars, NHTSA is 
proposing CAFE standards defined by 
the following coefficients during MY 
2012–2016: 
TABLE IV.E.2–1—COEFFICIENTS DEFINING PROPOSED MY 2012–2016 FUEL ECONOMY TARGETS FOR PASSENGER CARS 
Coefficient 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 
a (mpg) ....................................................................... 36 .23 37 .15 38 .08 39 .55 41 .38 
b (mpg) ....................................................................... 28 .12 28 .67 29 .22 30 .08 31 .12 
c (gpm/sf) ................................................................... 0 .0005308 0 .0005308 0 .0005308 0 .0005308 0 .0005308 
d (gpm) ....................................................................... 0 .005842 0 .005153 0 .004498 0 .003520 0 .002406 
These coefficients result in footprint- 
dependent target curves shown 
graphically below. The MY 2011 final 
standard, which is specified by a 
constrained logistic function rather than

49692 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
572 In the March 2009 final rule establishing MY 
2011 standards for passenger cars and light trucks, 
NHTSA estimated that the required fuel economy 
levels for passenger cars would average 30.2 mpg 
under the MY 2011 passenger car standard. Based 
on the agency’s current forecast of the MY 2011 
passenger car market, which anticipates greater 
numbers of passenger cars than the forecast used in 
the MY 2011 final rule, NHTSA now estimates that 
the average required fuel economy level for 
passenger cars will be 30.5 mpg in MY 2011. 
As discussed, the CAFE levels 
required of individual manufacturers 
will depend on the mix of vehicles they 
produce for sale in the United States. 
Based on the market forecast of future 
sales that NHTSA has used to examine 
today’s proposed CAFE standards, the 
agency estimates that the targets shown 
above will result in the following 
average required fuel economy levels for 
individual manufacturers during MYs 
2012–2016 (an updated estimate of the 
average required fuel economy level 
under the final MY 2011 standard is 
shown for comparison): 572

49693 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
573 In the March 2009 final rule establishing MY 
2011 standards for passenger cars and light trucks, 
NHTSA estimated that the minimum required 
CAFE standard for domestically manufactured 
passenger cars would be 27.8 mpg under the MY 
2011 passenger car standard. Based on the agency’s 
current forecast of the MY 2011 passenger car 
market, NHTSA now estimates that the minimum 
required CAFE standard will be 28.0 mpg in MY 
2011. 
We note that a manufacturer’s 
required average fuel economy level for 
a model year under the proposed 
standards would be based on its actual 
production numbers in that model year. 
Therefore, its official required fuel 
economy level would not be known 
until the end of that model year. 
However, because the targets for each 
vehicle footprint would be established 
in advance of the model year, a 
manufacturer should be able to estimate 
its required level accurately. 
3. Minimum Domestic Passenger Car 
Standards 
EISA expressly requires each 
manufacturer to meet a minimum fuel 
economy standard for domestically 
manufactured passenger cars in addition 
to meeting the standards set by NHTSA. 
According to the statute (49 U.S.C. 
32902(b)(4)) the minimum standard 
shall be the greater of (A) 27.5 miles per 
gallon; or (B) 92 percent of the average 
fuel economy projected by the Secretary 
for the combined domestic and non- 
domestic passenger automobile fleets 
manufactured for sale in the United 
States by all manufacturers in the model 
year. The agency must publish the 
projected minimum standards in the 
Federal Register when the passenger car 
standards for the model year in question 
are promulgated. 
Based on NHTSA’s current market 
forecast, the agency’s estimates of these 
minimum standards under the proposed 
MY 2012–2016 CAFE standards (and, 
for comparison, the final MY 2011 
standard) are summarized below in 
Table IV.E.2–1.573 For eventual 
compliance calculations, the final 
calculated minimum standards will be 
updated to reflect any changes in the 
average fuel economy level required 
under the final standards. 
TABLE IV.E.3–1—ESTIMATED MINIMUM STANDARD FOR DOMESTICALLY MANUFACTURED PASSENGER CARS UNDER FINAL 
MY 2011 AND PROPOSED MY 2012–2016 CAFE STANDARDS FOR PASSENGER CARS 
2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 
28.0 30.9 31.6 32.4 33.5 34.9 
4. Light Truck Standards 
For light trucks, NHTSA is proposing CAFE standards defined by the following coefficients during MYs 2012–2016: 
TABLE IV.E.4–1—COEFFICIENTS DEFINING PROPOSED MY 2012–2016 FUEL ECONOMY TARGETS FOR LIGHT TRUCKS 
Coefficient 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 
a (mpg) ....................................................................... 29 .44 30 .32 31 .30 32 .70 34 .38 
b (mpg) ....................................................................... 22 .06 22 .55 23 .09 23 .84 24 .72 
c (gpm/sf) ................................................................... 0 .0004546 0 .0004546 0 .0004546 0 .0004546 0 .0004546 
d (gpm) ....................................................................... 0 .01533 0 .01434 0 .01331 0 .01194 0 .01045 
These coefficients result in footprint- 
dependent targets shown graphically 
below. The MY 2011 final standard, 
which is specified by a constrained 
logistic function rather than a 
constrained linear function, is shown 
for comparison.

49694 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
574 In the March 2009 final rule establishing MY 
2011 standards for passenger cars and light trucks, 
NHTSA estimated that the required fuel economy 
levels for light trucks would average 24.1 mpg 
under the MY 2011 light truck standard. Based on 
the agency’s current forecast of the MY 2011 light 
truck market, NHTSA now estimates that the 
required fuel economy levels will average 24.2 mpg 
in MY 2011. The increase in the estimate reflects 
a slight decrease in the size of the average light 
truck. 
Given these targets, the CAFE levels 
required of individual manufacturers 
will depend on the mix of vehicles they 
produce for sale in the United States. 
Based on the market forecast NHTSA 
has used to examine today’s proposed 
CAFE standards, the agency estimates 
that the targets shown above will result 
in the following average required fuel 
economy levels for individual 
manufacturers during MYs 2012–2016 
(an updated estimate of the average 
required fuel economy level under the 
final MY 2011 standard is shown for 
comparison): 574

49695 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
575 Notice of intent to prepare an EIS, 74 FR 
14857, 14859–60, April 1, 2009. 
576 The stringency indicated by each of these 
alternatives depends on the value of inputs to 
NHTSA’s analysis. Results presented here for these 
two alternatives are based on NHTSA’s reference 
case inputs, which underlie the central analysis of 
the proposed standards. In the accompanying PRIA, 
the agency presents the results of that analysis to 
explore the sensitivity of results to changes in key 
economic inputs. Because of numerous changes in 
model inputs (e.g., discount rate, rebound effect, 
CO2 value, technology cost estimates), our analysis 
often exhausts all available technologies before 
reaching the point at which total costs equal total 
benefits. In these cases, the stringency that exhausts 
all available technologies is considered. 
As discussed above with respect to 
the proposed passenger cars standards, 
we note that a manufacturer’s required 
fuel economy level for a model year 
under the proposed standards would be 
based on its actual production numbers 
in that model year. 
F. How Do the Proposed Standards 
Fulfill NHTSA’s Statutory Obligations? 
In developing the proposed MY 2012– 
16 standards, the agency developed and 
considered a wide variety of 
alternatives. NHTSA took a new 
approach to defining alternatives as 
compared to the most recent prior CAFE 
rulemaking. In response to comments 
received in the last round of 
rulemaking, in our March 2009 notice of 
intent to prepare an environmental 
impact statement, the agency selected a 
range of candidate stringencies that 
increased annually, on average, 3% to 
7%.575 That same approach has been 
carried over to this NPRM and to the 
accompanying DEIS and PRIA. The 
majority of the alternatives considered 
in this rulemaking are defined as 
average percentage increases in 
stringency—3 percent per year, 4 
percent per year, 5 percent per year, and 
so on. NHTSA believes that this 
approach more clearly communicates 
the level of stringency of each 
alternative and is more intuitive than 
alternatives defined in terms of different 
cost-benefit ratios, and still allows us to 
identify alternatives that represent 
different ways to balance NHTSA’s 
statutory requirements under EPCA/ 
EISA. 
In the notice of intent, we noted that 
each of the listed alternatives 
represents, in part, a different way in 
which NHTSA could conceivably 
balance conflicting policies and 
considerations in setting the standards. 
We were mindful that the agency would 
need to weigh and balance many factors, 
such as the technological feasibility, 
economic practicability, including 
leadtime considerations for the 
introduction of technologies and 
impacts on the auto industry, the 
impacts of the standards on fuel savings 
and CO2 emissions, fuel savings by 
consumers; as well as other relevant 
factors such as safety. For example, the 
7% Alternative, the most stringent 
alternative, weighs energy conservation 
and climate change considerations more 
heavily and technological feasibility and 
economic practicability less heavily. In 
contrast, the 3% Alternative, the least 
stringent alternative, places more weight 
on technological feasibility and 
economic practicability. We recognized 
that the ‘‘feasibility’’ of the alternatives 
also may reflect differences and 
uncertainties in the way in which key 
economic (e.g., the price of fuel and the 
social cost of carbon) and technological 
inputs could be assessed and estimated 
or valued. 
In subsequently developing the NPRM 
and the associated analytical 
documents, the agency expanded the 
list of alternatives to provide a degree of 
analytical continuity between the old 
and new approach to defining 
alternatives in an effort help the agency 
and the public understand the 
similarities and dissimilarities between 
the two approaches and to make the 
transition to the new approach. To that 
end, we included and analyzed two 
additional alternatives, one that sets 
standards at the point where net 
benefits are maximized, and another 
that sets standards at the point at which 
total costs are equal to total benefits.576 
With respect to the first of those 
alternatives, we note that Executive 
Order 12866 focuses attention on an 
approach that maximizes net benefits. 
Further, since NHTSA has thus far set 
attribute-based CAFE standards at the 
point at which net benefits are 
maximized, we believed it would be 
useful and informative to consider the 
potential impacts of that approach as 
compared to the new approach for MYs 
2012–2016. 
After working with EPA in thoroughly 
reviewing and in some cases reassessing 
the effectiveness and costs of 
technologies, most of which are already 
being incorporated in at least some 
vehicles, market forecasts and economic 
assumptions, we used the Volpe model 
extensively to assess the technologies 
that the manufacturers could apply in 
order to comply with each of the 
alternatives. This permitted us to assess 
the variety, amount and cost of the 
technologies that could be needed to 
enable the manufacturers to comply 
with each of the alternatives. NHTSA 
estimated how the application of these 
and other technologies could increase 
vehicle costs. The following five figures 
show industry-wide average 
incremental (i.e., relative to the 
reference fleet) per-vehicle costs, for 
each model year, each fleet, and the 
combined fleet. Estimates specific to 
each manufacturer are shown in the 
accompanying PRIA.

Corresponding to these per-vehicle 
cost increases, NHTSA estimated total 
incremental outlays for additional 
technology in each model year. The 
following figure shows cumulative 
results for MY 2012–2016 for industry 
and Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, 
Honda, Nissan, and Toyota. This figure 
focuses on these manufacturers as they 
currently (in MY 2008) represent three 
large U.S.-headquartered and three large 
foreign-headquartered full-line 
manufacturers.

For each alternative, NHTSA has also 
estimated all corresponding effects for 
each model year, including fuel savings, 
CO2 reductions, and other effects, as 
well as the estimated societal benefits of 
these effects.

The accompanying PRIA presents a 
detailed analysis of these results. 
Relevant to EPCA’s requirement that 
NHTSA consider, among other factors, 
economic practicability and the need of 
the nation to conserve energy, the 
following figure compares the 
incremental technology outlays 
presented above to the corresponding 
cumulative fuel savings. 
The agency then assessed which 
alternative would represent a reasonable 
balancing of the statutory criteria, given 
the difficulties confronting the industry 
and the economy, and the priorities and 
policy goals of the President. Those 
priorities and goals include achieving 
nationally harmonized and coordinated 
program for regulating fuel economy 
and GHG emissions. 
Part of that assessment entailed an 
evaluation of the stringencies necessary 
to achieve both Federal and State GHG 
emission reduction goals, especially 
those of California and the States that 
have adopted its GHG emission 
standard for motor vehicles. Given that 
EPCA requires attribute-based 
standards, NHTSA and EPA determined 
the level at which an attribute-based 
GHG emissions standard would need to 
be set to achieve the goals of California. 
This was done by evaluating a 
nationwide CAA standard for MY 2016 
that would require the levels of 
technology upgrade, across the country, 
which California standards would 
require for the subset of vehicles sold in 
California under the California 
standards for MY 2009–2016 (known as 
‘‘Pavley 1’’). In essence, the stringency 
of the California Pavley 1 program was 
evaluated, but for a national standard. 
For a number of reasons discussed in 
section III.D, an assessment was 
developed of an equivalent national 
new vehicle fleet-wide CO2 performance 
standards for model year 2016 which 
would result in the new vehicle fleet in 
the State of California having CO2 
performance equal to the performance 
from the California Pavley 1 standards. 
That level, 250 g/mi, is equivalent to 
35.5 mpg if the GHG standard is met

577 Separately, NHTSA has conducted analysis 
that accounts for EPCA’s provisions regarding FFVs. 
578 Because NHTSA’s modeling represents every 
model year explicitly, accounts for estimates of 
when vehicle model redesigns will occur, and sets 
aside these compliance flexibilities, the agency’s 
modeling produces results that differ varyingly 
from EPA’s for specific manufacturers, fleets, and 
model years. 
579 Also, the ‘‘Max NB’’ and the ‘‘TC = TB’’ 
alternatives depend on the inputs to the agencies’ 
analysis. The sensitivity analysis presented in the 
PRIA documents the response of these alternatives 
to changes in key economic inputs. For example, 
the combined average required fuel economy under 
the ‘‘Max NB’’ alternative is 36.8 mpg under the 
reference case economic inputs presented here, and 
ranges from 32.8 mpg to 37.2 mpg under the 
alternative economic inputs presented in the PRIA. 
exclusively by fuel economy 
improvements. 
To obtain the counterpart CAFE 
standard, we then adjusted that level 
downward to account for differences 
between the more prescriptive EPCA 
and the more flexible CAA. These 
differences give EPA greater ability 
under the CAA to provide compliance 
flexibilities that would enable 
manufacturers to achieve compliance 
with a given level of requirement under 
the CAA at less cost than with the same 
level of requirement under EPCA. 
Principal among those greater 
flexibilities are the credits that EPA can 
provide for improving the efficiency of 
air conditioners and reducing the 
leakage of refrigerants from them. The 
adjustments result in a figure of 34.1 
mpg as the appropriate counterpart 
CAFE standard. This differential gives 
manufacturers the opportunity to reach 
35.5 mpg under the CAA in ways that 
would significantly reduce their costs. 
Were NHTSA instead to establish its 
standard at the same level, 
manufacturers would need to make 
substantially greater expenditures on 
fuel-saving technologies to reach 35.5 
mpg under EPCA. 
Given the importance to this 
rulemaking of achieving a harmonized 
National Program, we created a new 
alternative whose annual percentage 
increases would achieve 34.1 mpg by 
MY 2016. That alternative is one which 
increases on average at 4.3% annually. 
This new alternative, like the seven 
alternative presented above, represents a 
unique balancing of the statutory factors 
and other relevant considerations. We 
have added that alternative to the table 
below.

As noted earlier, NHTSA has used the 
Volpe model to analyze each of these 
alternatives based on analytical inputs 
determined jointly with EPA. For a 
given regulatory alternative, the Volpe 
model estimates how each manufacturer 
could apply technology in response to 
the MY 2012 standard (separately for 
cars and trucks), carries technologies 
applied in MY 2012 forward to MY 
2013, and then estimates how each 
manufacturer could apply technology in 
response to the MY 2013 standard. 
When analyzing MY 2013, the model 
considers the potential to add ‘‘extra’’ 
technology in MY 2012 in order to carry 
that technology into MY 2013, thereby 
avoiding the use of more expensive 
technologies in MY 2013. The model 
continues in this fashion through MY 
2016, and then performs calculations to 
estimate the costs, effects, and benefits 
of the applied technologies, and to 
estimate any civil penalties owed based 
on projected noncompliance. For each 
regulatory alternative, the model 
calculates incremental costs, effects, and 
benefits relative to the regulatory 
baseline (i.e., the no-action alternative), 
under which the MY 2011 CAFE 
standards continue through MY 2016. 
The model calculates results for each 
model year, because EPCA requires that 
NHTSA set its standards for each model 
year at the ‘‘maximum feasible average 
fuel economy level that the Secretary 
decides the manufacturers can achieve 
in that model year’’ considering four 
statutory factors. Pursuant to EPCA’s 
directive notice not to consider statutory 
credits in establishing CAFE standards, 
NHTSA did not FFV credits, credits 
carried forward and backward, and 
transferred credit.577 578 In addition, the 
analysis reflects the ability of 
manufacturers to pay fines in lieu of 
compliance. 
Because it entails year-by-year 
examination of eight regulatory 
alternatives for, separately, passenger 
cars and light trucks, NHTSA’s analysis 
involves a large amount of information. 
Detailed results of this analysis are 
presented separately in the PRIA 
accompanying today’s notice. The 
remainder of this section discusses a 
combination of aggregated and 
illustrative results of this analysis. 
The following figure compares 
average fuel economy levels required of 
manufacturers under the eight 
regulatory alternatives in MYs 2012, 
2014, and 2016. Required levels for MY 
2013 and MY 2015 fall between those 
for MYs 2012 and 2014 and MYs 2014 
and 2016, respectively. Although 
required levels for these interim years 
are not presented in the following figure 
to limit the complexity of the figure, 
they do appear in the accompanying 
PRIA.579

As this figure illustrates, the proposed 
standards involve a ‘‘faster start’’ toward 
increased stringency than do any of the 
alternatives that increase steadily (i.e., 
the 3%/y, 4%/y, 5%/y, 6%/y, and 7%/ 
y alternatives). However, by MY 2016, 
the stringency of the proposed standards 
reflects an average annual increase of 
4.3%/y. The proposed standards, 
therefore, represent an alternative that 
could be referred to as ‘‘4.3% per year 
with a fast start’’ or a ‘‘front-loaded 
4.3% average annual increase.’’ 
In NHTSA’s analysis, these achieved 
average fuel economy levels result from 
the application of technology rather 
than changes in the mix of vehicles 
produced for sale in the U.S. The 
accompanying PRIA presents detailed 
estimates of additional technology 
penetration into the NHTSA reference 
fleet associated with each regulatory 
alternative. The following four charts 
illustrate the results of this analysis, 
considering the application of four 
technologies by six manufacturers and 
the industry as a whole. Technologies 
include gasoline direct injection (GDI), 
engine turbocharging and downsizing, 
diesel engines, and strong HEV systems 
(including CISG systems). GDI and 
turbocharging are among the 
technologies that play an important role 
in achieving the fuel economy 
improvements shown in NHTSA’s 
analysis, and diesels and strong HEVs 
represent technologies involving 
significant challenges for widespread 
use through MY 2016. These figures 
focus on Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, 
Honda, Nissan, and Toyota, as these 
manufacturers currently (in MY 2008) 
represent three large U.S.-headquartered 
and three large foreign-headquartered 
full-line manufacturers. For each 
alternative, the figures show additional 
application of technology by MY 2016. 
The PRIA presents results for all model 
years, technologies, and manufacturers, 
and NHTSA has considered these 
broader results when considering the 
eight regulatory alternatives.

The agency began the process of 
winnowing the alternatives by 
determining whether any of the lower 
stringency alternatives should be 
eliminated from consideration. To begin 
with, the agency needs to ensure that its 
standards are high enough to enable the 
combined fleet of passenger cars and 
light trucks to achieve at least 35 mpg 
not later than MY 2020, as required by 
EISA. Achieving that level makes it 
necessary for the chosen alternative to 
increase at over 3 percent annually. 
NHTSA has concluded that it must 
reject the 3%/y and 4%/y alternatives. 
Given that CO2 and fuel savings are very 
closely correlated, the above chart 
reveals that the 3%/y and 4%/y 
alternative would not produce the 
reductions in fuel savings and CO2 
emissions that the Nation needs at this 
time. Picking either of those alternatives 
would unnecessarily result in foregoing 
substantial benefits, in terms of fuel

savings and reduced CO2 emissions, 
which would be achievable at 
reasonable cost. Further, NHTSA has 
tentatively concluded that it must reject 
the 3%/y and 4%/y alternatives, as 
neither would lead to the regulatory 
harmonization that forms a vital core 
principle of the National Program that 
EPA and NHTSA are jointly striving to 
implement. In order to achieve a 
harmonized National Program, an 
average annual increase of 4.3% is 
necessary. 
In contrast, at the upper end of the 
range of alternatives, the agency was 
concerned that the increased benefits 
offered by those alternatives were 
available only at excessive cost and 
might not be practicable in all cases 
within the available leadtime. 
NHTSA first considered the 
environmentally-preferable alternative. 
Based on the information provided in 
the DEIS, the environmentally- 
preferable alternative would be that 
involving stringencies at which total 
costs most nearly equal total benefits. 
NHTSA notes that NEPA does not 
require that agencies choose the 
environmentally-preferable alternative if 
doing so would be contrary to the 
choice that the agency would otherwise 
make under its governing statute. Given 
the levels of stringency required by the 
environmentally-preferable alternative 
and the lack of lead time to achieve 
such levels between now and MY 2016, 
NHTSA tentatively concludes that the 
environmentally-preferable alternative 
would not be economically practicable 
or technologically feasible, and thus 
tentatively concludes that it would 
result in standards that would be 
beyond the level achievable for MYs 
2012–2016. 
NHTSA determined that it would be 
inappropriate to propose any of the 
other more stringent alternatives due to 
concerns over lead time and economic 
practicability. At a time when the entire 
industry remains in an economically 
critical state, the agencies believe that it 
would be unreasonable to propose more 
stringent standards. Even in a case 
where economic factors were not a 
consideration, there are real-world time 
constraints which must be considered 
due to the short lead time available for 
the early years of this program, in 
particular for MYs 2012 and 2013. 
As revealed by the figures shown 
above, the proposed standards already 
require aggressive application of 
technologies, and more stringent 
standards which would require more 
widespread use (including more 
substantial implementation of advanced 
technologies such as stoichiometric 
gasoline direct injection engines and 
strong hybrids) raise serious issues of 
adequacy of lead time, not only to meet 
the standards but to coordinate such 
significant changes with manufacturers’ 
redesign cycles. 
NHTSA does not believe that more 
stringent standards would meet EPCA’s 
requirement that CAFE standards be 
economically practicable. The figures 
presented above reveal that increasing 
stringency beyond the proposed 
standards would entail significant 
additional application of technology— 
technology that, though perhaps feasible 
for individual vehicle models, would 
not be economically practicable for the 
industry at the scales involved. Among 
the more stringent alternatives, the one 
closest in stringency to the standards 
proposed today is the alternative under 
which combined CAFE stringency 
increases at 5% annually. As indicated 
above, this alternative would yield fuel 
savings and CO2 reductions about 12% 
and 9% higher, respectively, than the 
proposed standards. However, 
compared to the proposed standards, 
this alternative would increase outlays 
for new technologies during MY 2012– 
2016 by about 24%, or $14b. Average 
MY 2016 cost increases would, in turn, 
rise from $1,076 under the proposed 
standards to $1,409 when stringency 
increases at 5% annually. This 
represents a 30% increase in per-vehicle 
cost for only a 3% increase in average 
performance (on a gallon-per-mile basis 
to which fuel savings are proportional). 
The following three tables summarize 
estimated manufacturer-level average 
incremental costs for the 5%/y 
alternative and the average of the 
passenger and light truck fleets:

These cost increases derive from 
accelerated application of advanced 
technologies as stringency increases 
past the levels in the proposed 
standards. For example, under the 
proposed standards, additional diesel 
application rates average 2% for the 
industry and range from 0% to 7% 
among Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, 
Nissan, and Toyota. Under standards 
increasing in combined stringency at 
5% annually, these rates more than 
double, averaging 5% for the industry 
and ranging from 2% to 13% for the 
same six manufacturers. The agency 
tentatively concludes that the levels of 
technology penetration required by the 
proposed standards are reasonable. 
Increasing the standards beyond those 
levels would lead to rapidly increasing 
dependence on advanced technologies 
with higher costs, particularly in the 
early years of the rulemaking time 
frame, according to the agency’s 
analysis, and potentially pose too great 
an economic burden given the state of 
the industry. 
In contrast, through analysis of the 
illustrative results shown above, as well 
as the more complete and detailed 
results presented in the accompanying 
PRIA, NHTSA has concluded that the 
proposed standards are technologically 
feasible and economically practicable. 
The proposed standards will require 
manufacturers to apply considerable 
additional technology. Although 
NHTSA cannot predict how 
manufacturers will respond to the 
proposed standards, the agency’s 
analysis indicates that the standards 
could lead to significantly greater use of 
advanced engine and transmission 
technologies. As shown above, the 
agency’s analysis shows considerable 
increases in the application of SGDI 
systems and engine turbocharging and 
downsizing. Though not presented 
above, the agency’s analysis also shows 
similarly large increases in the use of 
dual-clutch automated manual 
transmissions (AMTs). However, the 
agency’s analysis does not suggest that 
the additional application of these 
technologies in response to the 
proposed standards would extend 
beyond levels achievable by the 
industry. These technologies are likely 
to be applied to at least some extent 
even in the absence of new CAFE 
standards. In addition, the agency’s 
analysis indicates that most 
manufacturers would rely only to a 
limited extent on the most expensive 
and advanced technologies, including 
diesel engines and strong HEVs. 
As shown above, NHTSA estimates 
that the proposed standards could lead 
to average incremental costs ranging

from $291 per vehicle (for light trucks 
in MY 2011) to $1,085 per vehicle (for 
passenger cars in MY 2016), increasing 
steadily from $421 per vehicle in for all 
light vehicles in MY 2011 $1,076 for all 
light vehicle in MY 2016. NHTSA 
estimates that these costs would vary 
considerably among manufacturers, but 
would rarely exceed $2,000 per vehicle.

standards and the average of the

580 See Section IV.G.7 below. 
581 In NHTSA’s analysis, ‘‘undercompliance’’ is 
mitigated either through use of FFV credits, use of 
existing or ‘‘banked’’ credits, or through fine 
payment. Because NHTSA cannot consider 
availability of credits in setting standards, the 
estimated achieved CAFE levels presented here do 
not account for their use. In contrast, because 
NHTSA is not prohibited from considering fine 
payment, the estimated achieved CAFE levels 
presented here include the assumption that BMW, 
Daimler (i.e., Mercedes), Porsche, and Tata (i.e., 
Jaguar and Rover) will only apply technology up to 
the point that it would be less expensive to pay 
civil penalties. 
582 In NHTSA’s analysis, ‘‘overcompliance’’ 
occurs through multi-year planning: Manufacturers 
apply some ‘‘extra’’ technology in early model years 
(e.g., MY 2014) in order to carry that technology 
forward and thereby facilitate compliance in later 
model years (e.g., MY 2016) 
583 Consistent with EPCA, NHTSA has not 
accounted for manufacturers’ ability to earn CAFE 
credits for selling FFVs, carry credits forward and 
back between model years, and transfer credits 
between the passenger car and light truck fleets. 
TABLE IV.F.8—AVERAGE INCREMENTAL COSTS ($/VEHICLE) UNDER PROPOSED CAFE STANDARDS—Continued

Volkswagen .......................................................................... 233 470 550 657 970 
Average ......................................................................... 421 605 777 924 1,076 
In summary, NHTSA has considered 
eight regulatory alternatives, including 
the proposed standards, examining 
technologies that could be applied in 
response to each alternative, as well as 
corresponding costs, effects, and 
benefits. The agency has concluded that 
alternatives less stringent than the 
proposed standards would not produce 
the fuel savings and CO2 reductions 
necessary at this time to achieve either 
the overarching purpose of EPCA, i.e., 
energy conservation, or an important 
part of the regulatory harmonization 
underpinning the National Program. 
Conversely, the agency has concluded 
that more stringent standards would 
involve levels of additional technology 
and cost that, considering the fragile 
state of the automotive industry, would 
not be economically practicable. 
Therefore, having considered these eight 
regulatory alternatives, and the 
statutorily-relevant factors of 
technological feasibility, economic 
practicability, the effect of other motor 
vehicle standards of the Government on 
fuel economy, and the need of the 
United States to conserve energy, along 
with other relevant factors such as the 
safety impacts of the proposed 
standards,580 NHTSA tentatively 
concludes that the proposed standards 
represent a reasonable balancing of all 
of these concerns, and are the maximum 
feasible average fuel economy levels 
that the manufacturers can achieve in 
MYs 2012–2016. 
G. Impacts of the Proposed CAFE 
Standards 
1. How Would These Proposed 
Standards Improve Fuel Economy and 
Reduce GHG Emissions for MY 2012– 
2016 Vehicles? 
As discussed above, the CAFE level 
required under an attribute-based 
standard depends on the mix of vehicles 
produced for sale in the U.S. Based on 
the market forecast that NHTSA and 
EPA have used to develop and analyze 
new CAFE and CO2 emissions 
standards, NHTSA estimates that the 
new CAFE standards will require CAFE 
levels to increase by an average of 4.3 
percent annually through MY 2016, 
reaching a combined average fuel 
economy requirement of 34.1 mpg in 
that model year: 
TABLE IV.G.1–1—AVERAGE REQUIRED FUEL ECONOMY (MPG) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 
Passenger Cars ................................................................... 33.6 34.4 35.2 36.4 38.0 
Light Trucks ......................................................................... 25.0 25.6 26.2 27.1 28.3 
Combined ...................................................................... 29.8 30.6 31.4 32.6 34.1 
NHTSA estimates that average 
achieved fuel economy levels will 
correspondingly increase through MY 
2016, but that manufacturers will, on 
average, undercomply 581 in some model 
years and overcomply 582 in others, 
reaching a combined average fuel 
economy of 33.7 mpg in MY 2016: 583

Combined ...................................................................... 29.3 30.5 31.5 32.7 33.7 
NHTSA estimates that these fuel 
economy increases will lead to fuel 
savings totaling 61.6 billion gallons 
during the useful lives of vehicles sold 
in MYs 2012–2016:

2. How Would These Proposed 
Standards Improve Fleet-Wide Fuel 
Economy and Reduce GHG Emissions 
Beyond MY 2016? 
Under the assumption that CAFE 
standards at least as stringent as those 
proposed for MY 2016 would be 
established for subsequent model years, 
the effects of the proposed standards on 
fuel consumption and GHG emissions 
will continue to increase for many 
years. This will occur because over 
time, a growing fraction of the U.S. 
light-duty vehicle fleet will be 
comprised of cars and light trucks that 
meet the MY 2016 standard. The impact 
of the proposed standards on fuel use 
and GHG emissions will continue to 
grow through approximately 2050, 
when virtually all cars and light trucks 
in service will have met the MY 2016 
standard. 
As Table IV.G.2–1 shows, NHTSA 
estimates that the fuel economy 
increases resulting from the proposed 
standards will lead to reductions in total 
fuel consumption by cars and light 
trucks of 9 billion gallons during 2020, 
increasing to 30 billion gallons by 2050. 
Over the period from 2012—when the 
proposed standards would begin to take 
effect—through 2050, cumulative fuel 
savings would total 693 billion gallons, 
as Table IV.G.2–1 also indicates. 
TABLE IV.G.2–1—REDUCTION IN FLEET-WIDE FUEL USE (BILLION GALLONS) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS 
Calendar year 2020 2030 2040 2050 
Total, 
2012– 
2050

Light Trucks ................................................................................................................. 4 7 9 11 262 
Combined .............................................................................................................. 9 19 25 30 693 
As a consequence of these reductions 
in fleet-wide fuel consumption, the 
agency also estimates that the proposed 
CAFE standards for MYs 2012–2016 
will lead to corresponding reductions in 
CO2 emissions from the U.S. light-duty 
vehicle fleet. Specifically, NHTSA 
estimates that total CO2 emissions 
associated with passenger car and light 
truck use in the U.S. use will decline by 
111 million metric tons (mmt) during 
2020 as a consequence of the proposed 
standards, as Table IV.G.2–2 reports. 
The table also shows that the this 
reduction is estimated to grow to 355 
million metric tons by the year 2050, 
and will total 8,247 million metric tons 
over the period from 2012, when the 
proposed standards would take effect, 
through 2050.

These reductions in fleet-wide CO2 
emissions, together with corresponding 
reductions in other GHG emissions from 
fuel production and use, would lead to 
small but significant reductions in 
projected changes in the future global 
climate. These changes are summarized 
in Table IV.G.2–3 below.

3. How Would These Proposed 
Standards Impact Non-GHG Emissions 
and Their Associated Effects? 
Under the assumption that CAFE 
standards at least as stringent as those 
proposed for MY 2016 would be 
established for subsequent model years, 
the effects of the proposed standards on 
air quality and its associated health 
effects will continue to be felt over the 
foreseeable future. This will occur 
because over time a growing fraction of 
the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet will be 
comprised of cars and light trucks that 
meet the MY 2016 standard, and this 
growth will continue until 
approximately 2050. 
Increases in the fuel economy of light- 
duty vehicles required by the proposed 
CAFE standards will cause a slight 
increase in the number of miles they are 
driven, through the fuel economy 
‘‘rebound effect.’’ In turn, this increase 
in vehicle use will lead to increases in 
emissions of criteria air pollutants and 
some airborne toxics, since these are 
products of the number of miles 
vehicles are driven. 
At the same time, however, the 
projected reductions in fuel production 
and use reported in Table IV.G.2–1 
above will lead to corresponding 
reductions in emissions of these 
pollutants that occur during fuel 
production and distribution 
(‘‘upstream’’ emissions). For most of 
these pollutants, the reduction in 
upstream emissions resulting from 
lower fuel production and distribution 
will outweigh the increase in emissions 
from vehicle use, resulting in a net 
decline in their total emissions. 
Tables IV.G.3–1a and 3–1b report 
estimated reductions in emissions of 
selected criteria air pollutants (or their 
chemical precursors) and airborne 
toxics expected to result from the 
proposed standards during calendar 
year 2030. By that date, the majority of 
light-duty vehicles in use will have met 
the proposed MY 2016 CAFE standards, 
so these reductions provide a useful 
index of the long-term impact of the 
proposed standards on air pollution and 
its consequences for human health.

Note: Positive values indicate increases in emissions; negative values indicate reductions. 
In turn, the reductions in emissions 
reported in Tables IV.G.3–1a and 3–1b 
are projected to result in significant 
declines in the health effects that result 
from population exposure to these 
pollutants. Table IV.G.3–2 reports the 
estimated reductions in selected PM2.5- 
related human health impacts that are 
expected to result from reduced 
population exposure to unhealthful 
atmospheric concentrations of PM2.5. 
The estimates reported in Table IV.G.3– 
2 are derived from PM2.5-related dollar- 
per-ton estimates that include only 
quantifiable reductions in health 
impacts likely to result from reduced 
population exposure to particular matter 
(PM). They do not include all health 
impacts related to reduced exposure to 
PM, nor do they include any reductions 
in health impacts resulting from lower 
population exposure to other criteria air 
pollutants (particularly ozone) and air 
toxics. NHTSA and EPA are using PM- 
related benefits-per-ton values as an 
interim approach to estimating the PM- 
related benefits of the proposal. To 
model the ozone and PM air quality 
benefit sof the final rule, the analysis 
will utilize ambient concentration data 
derived from full-scale photochemical 
air quality modeling.

4. What Are the Estimated Costs and 
Benefits of These Proposed Standards? 
NHTSA estimates that the proposed 
standards could entail significant 
additional technology beyond the levels 
reflected in the baseline market forecast 
used by NHTSA. This additional 
technology will lead to increases in 
costs to manufacturers and vehicle 
buyers, as well as fuel savings to vehicle 
buyers. The following three tables 
summarize the extent to which the 
agency estimates technologies could be 
added to the passenger car, light truck, 
and overall fleets in each model year in 
response to the proposed standards. 
Percentages reflect the technology’s 
additional application in the market, 
and are negative in cases where one 
technology is superseded (i.e., 
displaced) by another. For example, the 
agency estimates that many automatic 
transmissions used in light trucks could 
be displaced by dual clutch 
transmissions.

BILLING CODE 6560–50–C 
In order to pay for this additional 
technology (and, for some 
manufacturers, civil penalties), NHTSA 
estimates that average passenger car and 
light truck prices will, relative to levels 
resulting from compliance with baseline 
(MY 2011) standards, increase by $591- 
$1,127 and $283-$1,020, respectively, 
during MYs 2011–2016. The following 
tables summarize the agency’s estimates 
of average price increases for each 
manufacturer’s passenger car, light 
truck, and overall fleets (with 
corresponding averages for the 
industry):

584 The agency seeks comment above on 
appropriate values for these costs. 
Based on the agencies’ estimates of 
manufacturers’ future sales volumes, 
these price increases will lead to a total 
of $60.2 billion in incremental outlays 
during MYs 2012–2016 for additional 
technology attributable to the proposed 
standards: 
TABLE IV.G.4–7—INCREMENTAL TECHNOLOGY OUTLAYS ($B) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total 
Passenger Cars ....................................... 4.1 6.5 8.4 9.9 11.8 40.8 
Light Trucks ............................................. 1.5 2.8 4.0 5.2 5.9 19.4 
Combined .......................................... 5.7 9.3 12.5 15.1 17.6 60.2 
NHTSA notes that these estimates of 
the economic costs for meeting higher 
CAFE standards omit certain potentially 
important categories of costs, and may 
also reflect underestimation (or possibly 
overestimation) of some costs that are 
included. For example, although the 
agency’s analysis attempts to hold 
vehicle performance, capacity, and 
utility constant in estimating the costs 
of applying fuel-saving technologies to 
vehicles, the analysis imputes no cost to 
any actual reductions in vehicle 
performance, capacity, and utility that 
may result from manufacturers’ efforts 
to comply with the proposed CAFE 
standards. Although these costs are 
difficult to estimate accurately, they 
nonetheless represent a potentially 
significant category of omitted costs. 
Similarly, the agency’s estimates of 
costs for meeting higher CAFE standards 
does not estimate the economic value of 
potential increases in motor vehicle 
fatalities and injuries that could result 
from reductions in the size or weight of 
vehicles. While NHTSA reports worst- 
case estimates of these increases in 
fatalities and injuries, no estimate of 
their economic value is included in the 
agency’s estimates of the net benefits 
resulting from the proposed standards 
due to ongoing discussion regarding 
these potential impacts. 
Finally, it is possible that the agency 
may have underestimated or 
overestimated manufacturers’ direct 
costs for applying some fuel economy 
technologies, or the increases in 
manufacturer’s indirect costs associated 
with higher vehicle manufacturing 
costs. In either case, the technology 
outlays reported here will not correctly 
represent the costs of meeting higher 
CAFE standards. Similarly, NHTSA’s 
estimates of increased costs of 
congestion, accidents, and noise 
associated with added vehicle use are 
drawn from a 1997 study, and the 
correct magnitude of these values may 
have changed since they were 
developed.584 If this is the case, the 
costs of increased vehicle use associated 
with the fuel economy rebound effect 
will differ from the agency’s estimates 
in this analysis. Thus, like the agency’s 
estimates of economic benefits, 
estimates of total compliance costs 
reported here may underestimate or 
overestimate the true economic costs of 
the proposed standards. 
However, offsetting these costs, the 
achieved increases in fuel economy will 
also produce significant benefits to 
society. NHTSA estimates that, in 
present value terms (at a discount rate 
of 3 percent), these benefits will total 
$201.7 billion over the useful lives of 
light vehicles sold during MYs 2012– 
2016: 
TABLE IV.G.4–8—PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS ($BILLION) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total 
Passenger Cars ....................................... 7.6 17.0 24.4 31.2 38.7 119.1 
Light Trucks ............................................. 5.5 11.6 17.3 22.2 26.0 82.6 
Combined .......................................... 13.1 28.7 41.8 53.4 64.7 201.7 
NHTSA attributes most of these 
benefits to reductions in fuel 
consumption, valuing fuel at future 
pretax prices in EIA’s reference case 
forecast from AEO 2009. The total 
benefits shown in the above table also 
include other benefits and disbenefits, 
examples of which include the social 
values of reductions in CO2 and criteria 
pollutant emissions, the value of 
additional travel (induced by the 
rebound effect), and the social cost of 
additional congestion, accidents, and 
noise attributable to that additional 
travel. The PRIA accompanying today’s 
proposed rule presents a detailed 
analysis of specific benefits of the 
proposed rule. 
For both the passenger car and light 
truck fleets, NHTSA estimates that the 
benefits of today’s proposed standards 
will exceed the corresponding costs in 
every model year. Over the useful lives 
of the affected (MY 2012–2016) 
vehicles, the agency estimates that the 
benefits of the proposed standards will 
exceed the costs of the proposed 
standards by $141.5 billion:

585 Because some economic inputs change the 
effective cost of some technologies, and NHTSA 
assumes some manufacturers will be willing to pay civil penalties based on economic considerations, 
this outcome is not assured. 
TABLE IV.G.4–9—PRESENT VALUE OF NET BENEFITS ($BILLION) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS—Continued 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total 
Combined .......................................... 7.4 19.4 29.3 38.3 47.1 141.5 
NHTSA’s estimates of economic 
benefits from establishing higher CAFE 
are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty. Most important, the 
agency’s estimates of the fuel savings 
likely to result from adopting higher 
CAFE standards depend critically on the 
accuracy of the estimated fuel economy 
levels that will be achieved under both 
the baseline scenario, which assumes 
that manufacturers will continue to 
comply with the MY 2011 CAFE 
standards, and under alternative 
increases in the standards that apply to 
MY 2012–16 passenger cars and light 
trucks. Specifically, if the agency has 
underestimated the fuel economy levels 
that manufacturers will achieve under 
the baseline scenario, its estimates of 
fuel savings and the resulting economic 
benefits will be too large. As another 
example, the agency’s estimate of 
benefits from reducing the threat of 
economic damages from disruptions in 
the supply of imported petroleum to the 
U.S. applies to calendar year 2015. If the 
magnitude of this estimate would be 
expected to grow after 2015 in response 
to increases in U.S. petroleum imports, 
growth in the level of U.S. economic 
activity, or increases in the likelihood of 
disruptions in the supply of imported 
petroleum, the agency may have 
underestimated the benefits from the 
reduction in petroleum imports 
expected to result from adopting higher 
CAFE standards. 
However, it is also possible that 
NHTSA’s estimates of economic benefits 
from establishing higher CAFE 
standards underestimate the true 
economic benefits of the fuel savings 
those standards would produce. This is 
partly because the agency has been 
unable to develop monetized estimates 
of the economic value of certain 
potentially significant categories of 
benefits from reducing fuel 
consumption. Specifically, the agency’s 
estimate of the economic value of 
reduced damages to human health 
resulting from lower exposure to criteria 
air pollutants includes only the effects 
of reducing population exposure to 
PM2.5 emissions. Although this is likely 
to be the most significant component of 
health benefits from reduced emissions 
of criteria air pollutants, it excludes the 
value of reduced damages to human 
health and other impacts resulting from 
lower emissions and reduced 
population exposure to other criteria air 
pollutants, including ozone and nitrous 
oxide (N2O), as well as airborne toxics. 
The agency’s analysis excludes these 
benefits because no reliable estimates of 
the health impacts of criteria pollutants 
other than PM2.5 or of the health impacts 
of airborne toxics were available to use 
in developing estimates of these 
benefits. 
In addition, the agency’s estimate of 
the value of reduced climate-related 
economic damages from lower 
emissions of GHGs excludes many 
sources of potential benefits from 
reducing the pace and extent of global 
climate change. These include 
reductions in the risk of catastrophic 
changes in the global climate, lower 
costs for necessary adaptations to 
changes in climate, reduced water 
supply within specific global sub- 
regions, reductions in damages caused 
by severe storms, lower population 
exposure to harmful air pollution levels, 
reductions in ecosystem impacts and 
risks to natural resources of global 
significance, and reduced threats from 
widespread social or political unrest. 
Including monetized estimates of 
benefits from reducing the extent of 
climate change and these associated 
impacts would increase the agency’s 
estimates of benefits from adopting 
higher CAFE standards. 
The benefits, costs, and net benefits 
shown above are all based on a discount 
rate of 3 percent. As documented in the 
accompanying PRIA, the agency 
examined the sensitivity of results to 
changes in many economic inputs. With 
an alternative discount rate of 7 percent, 
incremental technology outlays were 
virtually identical to those estimated at 
a 3 percent discount rate: 585

However, the present value of the 
benefits accrued over the lifetime of the 
vehicles covered by the proposal is 
about 20 percent smaller when 
discounted at a 7 percent annual rate 
than when discounted at a 3 percent 
annual rate:

The above benefit and cost estimates 
did not reflect the availability and use 
of flexibility mechanisms, such as 
compliance credits and credit trading, 
because EPCA prohibits NHTSA from 
considering the effects of those 
mechanisms in setting CAFE standards. 
However, the agency noted that, in 
reality, manufacturers were likely to 
rely to some extent on flexibility 
mechanisms provided by EPCA and 
would thereby reduce the cost of 
complying with the proposed standards 
to a meaningful extent. 
As discussed in the PRIA, NHTSA has 
performed an analysis to estimate the 
costs and benefits if EPCA’s provisions 
regarding FFVs are accounted for. The 
agency considered also attempting to 
account for other EPCA flexibility 
mechanisms, in particular credit 
transfers between the passenger and 
nonpassenger fleets, but has concluded 
that, at least within a context in which 
each model year is represented 
explicitly, technologies carry forward 
between model years, and multiyear 
planning effects are represented, there is 
no basis to reliably estimate how 
manufacturers might use these 
mechanisms. Accounting for the FFV 
provisions indicates that achieved fuel 
economies would be 0.6–1.1 mpg lower 
than when these provisions are not 
considered (for comparison see Table 
IV.G.1–2 above): 
TABLE IV.G.4–15—AVERAGE ACHIEVED FUEL ECONOMY (MPG) UNDER PROPOSED STANDARDS (WITH FFV CREDITS)

Combined ...................................................................... 28.7 29.6 30.4 31.6 32.7 
As a result, NHTSA estimates that, 
when FFV credits are taken into 
account, fuel savings will total 58.8 
billion gallons—about 4.5 percent less 
than the 61.6 billion gallons estimated 
when these credits are not considered:

The agency similarly estimates CO2 
emissions reductions would total 639 
million metric tons (mmt), about 2.6 
percent less than the 656 mmt estimated 
when these credits are not 
considered:586

This analysis further indicates 
significant reductions in outlays for

provisions are taken into account— 
about $45b, or about 25 percent less 
than the $60b estimated when excluding

587 The molecular weight of Carbon (C) is 12, the 
molecular weight of Oxygen (O) is 16, thus the 
molecular weight of CO2 is 44. One ton of C = 44/ 
12 tons CO2 = 3.67 tons CO2. 1 gallon of gas weighs 
2,819 grams, of that 2,433 grams are carbon. $1.00 
CO2 = $3.67 C and $3.67/ton * ton/1000kg * kg/ 
1000g * 2433g/gallon = (3.67 * 2433)/1000 * 1000 
= $0.0089/gallon.

Because NHTSA’s analysis indicated 
that FFV provisions would not 
significantly reduce fuel savings, the 
agency’s estimate of discounted benefits 
when including these provisions, 
$192.5b, is only about 4.5 percent lower 
than the $201.7b shown above for the 
analysis that excluded these provisions:

However, although the agency 
estimates lower discounted benefits 
when FFV provisions are taken into 
account, the agency estimates that these 
provisions slightly increase net benefits 
(by about 4 percent, from $141.5b to 
$147.2b) because costs decrease by more 
than discounted benefits:

The agency has performed several 
sensitivity analyses to examine 
important assumptions. We examine 
sensitivity with respect to the following 
five economic parameters: 
(1) The price of gasoline: The 
Reference Case uses the AEO 2009 
reference case estimate for the price of 
gasoline. In this sensitivity analysis we 
examine the effect of using the AEO 
high or low forecast estimates instead. 
(2) The discount rate: The Reference 
Case uses a discount rate of 3 percent to 
discount future benefits. In the 
sensitivity analysis, we equally examine 
the effect of using a 7 percent discount 
rate instead. 
(3) The rebound effect: The Reference 
Case uses a rebound effect of 10 percent 
to project increased miles traveled as 
the cost per mile driven decreases. In 
the sensitivity analysis, we examine the 
effect of using a 5 percent or 15 percent 
rebound effect instead. 
(4) The values of CO2 benefits and 
monopsony: The Reference Case uses 
$20 per ton to quantify the benefits of 
reducing CO2 emissions and $0.178 per 
gallon to quantify the benefits of 
reducing fuel consumption. In the 
sensitivity analysis, we examine the 
effect of using values of $5, $10, $34, or 
$56 per ton instead to value CO2 
benefits. These values can be translated 
into cents per gallon by multiplying by 
0.0089,587 giving the following values: 
($5 per ton CO2) x 0.0089 = $0.0445 per 
gallon 
($10 per ton CO2) x 0.0089 = $0.089 per 
gallon 
($20 per ton CO2) x 0.0089 = $0.178 per 
gallon 
($34 per ton CO2) x 0.0089 = $0.3026 
per gallon 
($56 per ton CO2) x 0.0089 = $0.4984 
per gallon 
The $5 per ton value reflects the 
domestic impacts of CO2 emissions and 
so we use a nonzero monopsony cost, 
namely $0.30 cents per gallon, when 
valuing CO2 emissions at $5 per ton. 
The higher per-ton values of CO2 
emissions reflect the global impacts of 
CO2 emissions and we so use $0 per 
gallon for monopsony in these cases. 
(5) Military security: The Reference 
Case uses $0 per gallon to quantify the 
military security benefits of reducing 
fuel consumption. In the sensitivity 
analysis, we examine the impact of 
using a value of 5 cents per gallon 
instead. 
Varying each of the above 5 
parameters in isolation results in 10 
economic scenarios, not including the 
Reference case. These are listed in Table 
IV.G.4–21 below, together with two 
additional scenarios that use values for 
these parameters that produce the 
lowest and highest valued benefits.

The basic results of the sensitivity 
analyses were as follows: 
(1) The various economic 
assumptions have similar effects on the 
passenger car and light truck standards. 
(2) Varying the economic assumptions 
has virtually no impact on achieved fuel 
economy. 
(3) The economic parameter with the 
greatest impact is fuel price. Changing 
the fuel price forecast to AEO’s High or 
Low forecasts impacts benefits by about 
±37 percent. However, the impact of 
fuel price on other quantities, such as 
cost, is much smaller, resulting in 
increases or decreases of 3–8 percent. 
(4) Economic parameters other than 
fuel price and the rebound effect had no 
effect on per-vehicle cost, total cost, fuel 
savings, or CO2 reductions. Their 
impacts on benefits were 6 percent or 
less, with the exception of the 7 percent 
discount rate, which decreased benefits 
by 20 percent, and the $56/ton CO2 
value, which raised benefits by 14 
percent. 
(5) Changing all economic parameters 
simultaneously (among the considered 
values) changes benefits by at most 
about 60 percent. However impacts to 
other quantities, such as cost, are much 
smaller, resulting in increases or 
decreases of 6 percent or less. 
(6) Impacts other than those discussed 
in 1) through 5) were small (5 percent 
or less). 
For more detailed information 
regarding NHTSA’s sensitivity analyses 
for this NPRM, please see Chapter X of 
NHTSA’s PRIA. 
5. How Would These Proposed 
Standards Impact Vehicle Sales? 
Higher fuel economy standards are 
expected to increase the price of 
passenger cars and light trucks, because 
manufacturers will have to add 
technology to vehicles to increase their 
fuel economy, the cost for which they 
will likely pass on in some fashion to 
consumers. NHTSA examined the 
potential impact of higher vehicle prices 
on sales on an industry-wide basis for 
passenger cars and light trucks 
separately. We note that the analysis 
conducted for this rule does not have 
the precision to examine effects on 
individual manufacturers or different 
vehicle classes. 
There is a broad consensus in the 
economic literature that the price 
elasticity for demand for automobiles is 
approximately –1.0.588 Thus, every one 
percent increase in the price of the 
vehicle would reduce sales by one 
percent. Elasticity estimates assume no 
perceived change in the quality of the 
product. However, in this case, vehicle 
price increases result from adding 
technologies that improve fuel 
economy. If consumers did not value 
improved fuel economy at all, and 
considered nothing but the increase in 
price in their purchase decisions, then 
the estimated impact on sales from price 
elasticity could be applied directly. 
However, NHTSA believes that 
consumers do value improved fuel 
economy, because it reduces the 
operating cost of the vehicles. NHTSA 
also believes that consumers consider 
other factors that affect their costs and 
have included these in the analysis. 
The main question, however, is how 
much of the retail price needed to cover 
the technology investments to meet 
higher fuel economy standards will 
manufacturers be able to pass on to 
consumers. The ability of manufacturers 
to pass the compliance costs on to 
consumers depends upon how 
consumers value the fuel economy 
improvements.589 Consumer valuation 
of fuel economy improvements often 
depends upon the price of gasoline, 
which has recently been very volatile. 
The estimates reported below as part of 
NHTSA’s analysis on sales impacts 
assume that manufacturers will be able 
to pass all of their costs to improve fuel 
economy on to consumers. To the extent 
that NHTSA has accurately predicted 
the price of gasoline and consumers’ 
reactions, and manufacturers can pass 
on all of the costs to consumers, then 
the sales and employment impact 
analyses are reasonable. On the other 
hand, if manufacturers only increase 
retail prices to the extent that 
consumers value these fuel economy 
improvements (i.e., to the extent that 
they value fuel savings), then there 
would be no impact on sales, although 
manufacturers’ profit levels would fall. 
Sales losses are predicted to occur only 
if consumers fail to value fuel economy 
improvements at least as much as they 
pay in higher vehicle prices. Likewise, 
if fuel prices rise beyond levels used in 
this analysis, consumer valuation of 
improved fuel economy could increase 
to match or exceed their initial 
investment, resulting in no impact or 
even an increase in sales levels. 
To estimate the average value 
consumers place on fuel savings at the 
time of purchase, NHTSA assumes that 
the average purchaser considers the fuel 
savings they would receive over a 5-year 
time frame. NHTSA chose 5 years 
because this is the average length of 
time of a financing agreement.590 The

trucks were 46 percent of the on-road fleet, 
resulting in an average light vehicle price for 2006 
of $24,033. 
593 New car loan rates in 2007 averaged about 7.8 
percent at commercial banks and 4.5 percent at auto 
finance companies, so their average is close to 7

August 9, 2009). 
present values of these savings were 
calculated using a 3 percent discount 
rate. NHTSA used a fuel price forecast 
that included taxes, because this is what 
consumers must pay. Fuel savings were 
calculated over the first 5 years and 
discounted back to a present value. 
NHTSA believes that consumers may 
consider several other factors over the 5- 
year horizon when contemplating the 
purchase of a new vehicle. NHTSA 
added these factors into the calculation 
to represent how an increase in 
technology costs might affect 
consumers’ buying considerations. 
First, consumers might consider the 
sales taxes they have to pay at the time 
of purchasing the vehicle. NHTSA took 
sales taxes in 2007 by State and 
weighted them by population by State to 
determine a national weighted-average 
sales tax of 5.5 percent. 
Second, NHTSA considered insurance 
costs over the 5-year period. More 
expensive vehicles will require more 
expensive collision and comprehensive 
(e.g., theft) car insurance. The increase 
in insurance costs is estimated from the 
average value of collision plus 
comprehensive insurance as a 
proportion of average new vehicle price. 
Collision plus comprehensive insurance 
is the portion of insurance costs that 
depends on vehicle value. The 
Insurance Information Institute provides 
the average value of collision plus 
comprehensive insurance in 2006 as 
$448.591 This is compared to an average 
price for light vehicles of $24,033 for 
2006.592 Average prices and estimated 
sales volumes are needed because price 
elasticity is an estimate of how a percent 
increase in price affects the percent 
decrease in sales. 
Dividing the insurance cost by the 
average price of a new vehicle gives the 
proportion of comprehensive plus 
collision insurance as 1.86 percent of 
the price of a vehicle. If we assume that 
this premium is proportional to the new 
vehicle price, it represents about 1.86 
percent of the new vehicle price, and 
insurance is paid each year for the five- 
year period we are considering for 
payback. Discounting that stream of 
insurance costs back to present value 
indicates that the present value of the 
component of insurance costs that vary 
with vehicle price is equal to 8.5 
percent of the vehicle’s price at a 3 
percent discount rate. 
Third, NHTSA considered that 70 
percent of new vehicle purchasers take 
out loans to finance their purchase. The 
average new vehicle loan is for 5 years 
at a 6 percent rate.593 At these terms, the 
average person taking a loan will pay 16 
percent more for their vehicle over the 
5 years than a consumer paying cash for 
the vehicle at the time of purchase.594 
Discounting the additional 3.2 percent 
(16 percent/5 years) per year over the 5 
years using a 3 percent mid-year 
discount rate 595 results in a discounted 
present value of 14.87 percent higher for 
those taking a loan. Multiplying that by 
the 70 percent of consumers who take 
out a loan means that the average 
consumer would pay 10.2 percent more 
than the retail price for loans the 
consumer discounted at a 3 percent 
discount rate. 
Fourth, NHTSA considered the 
residual value (or resale value) of the 
vehicle after 5 years and expressed this 
as a percentage of the new vehicle price. 
In other words, if the price of the 
vehicle increases due to fuel economy 
technologies, the resale value of the 
vehicle will go up proportionately. The 
average resale price of a vehicle after 5 
years is about 35 percent of the original 
purchase price.596 Discounting the 
residual value back 5 years using a 3 
percent discount rate (35 percent * 
.8755) gives an effective residual value 
at new of 30.6 percent. 
NHTSA then adds these four factors 
together. At a 3 percent discount rate, 
the consumer considers she could get 
30.6 percent back upon resale in 5 years, 
but will pay 5.5 percent more for taxes, 
8.5 percent more in insurance, and 10.2 
percent more for loans, resulting in a 
6.48 percent return on the increase in 
price for fuel economy technology. 
Thus, the increase in price per vehicle 
is multiplied by 0.9352 (1¥0.0648) 
before subtracting the fuel savings to 
determine the overall net consumer 
valuation of the increase of costs on her 
purchase decision. 
The following table shows the 
estimated impact on sales for passenger 
cars and light trucks combined for the 
proposed alternative. For all model 
years except MY 2012, NHTSA 
anticipates an increase in sales, based 
on consumers valuing the improvement 
in fuel economy more than the increase 
in price.

6. What Are the Consumer Welfare 
Impacts of These Proposed Standards? 
There are two viewpoints for 
evaluating the costs and benefits of the 
proposed increase in CAFE standards: 
The private perspective of vehicle 
buyers themselves on the higher fuel 
economy levels the proposed rule 
would require, and the economy-wide 
or ‘‘social’’ perspective on the costs and 
benefits of requiring higher fuel 
economy. From the perspective of 
vehicle buyers, raising CAFE standards 
would impose significant costs in the 
form of higher prices for new vehicles, 
as manufacturers attempt to recover 
their added costs for producing vehicles 
with higher fuel efficiency. If vehicle 
manufacturers are unable to fully 
recover their higher costs for producing 
more fuel-efficient cars and light trucks 
through higher sales prices, they will 
bear part of these costs in the form of 
reduced ‘‘producer surplus’’ or short- 
term profits. 
Other private costs from requiring 
higher fuel economy also result from 
changes in the welfare of potential 
vehicle buyers, as they respond to

597 Vehicle buyers are likely to value fuel savings 
using retail fuel prices, which include taxes levied 
by Federal, State, and some local governments. 
Because the reduction in these tax payments 
resulting from lower fuel purchases is exactly offset 
by lower tax revenues to government agencies (and 
reduced spending on the transportation 
infrastructure and other investments financed by 
fuel taxes), it does not represent a net benefit from 
the perspective of the U.S. economy as a whole. 
Thus the social costs of requiring higher fuel 
efficiency also include an adjustment to reflect the 
reduction in fuel tax revenues that results from 
reduced fuel purchases by new-car buyers. 
higher vehicle prices by purchasing 
different models or postponing their 
purchases of new vehicles. The effects 
of requiring higher fuel economy on 
consumer welfare also depend on 
whether manufacturers elect to make 
other changes in vehicle attributes as 
they comply with stricter CAFE 
standards, such as performance, 
passenger- and cargo-carrying capacity, 
comfort, or occupant safety. Although 
NHTSA believes it has employed 
estimates of costs for improving fuel 
economy that include adequate 
allowances for any accompanying 
modifications necessary to maintain 
new vehicles’ current levels of other 
attributes, any changes in these 
attributes that manufacturers elect to 
make will represent additional private 
costs to vehicle buyers from requiring 
increased fuel economy. 
At the same time, raising CAFE 
standards also provides important 
private benefits to vehicle buyers, 
mainly in the form of the values buyers 
assign to the future savings in fuel costs 
they believe are likely to result from 
purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
Although these values are likely to vary 
significantly among buyers depending 
on their expectations about future fuel 
prices, how long they anticipate owning 
their vehicles, and how much they 
expect to drive, fuel savings are the 
primary source of private benefits from 
increased fuel economy. In addition, 
requiring new cars and light trucks to 
attain higher fuel economy will also 
provide benefits to their buyers through 
the increase in vehicle use associated 
with the fuel economy rebound effect, 
as well as from increases in vehicles’ 
driving range, which allow drivers to 
refuel less frequently. 
From the social perspective, the 
economic benefits and costs of 
establishing higher CAFE standards 
include not only these private benefits 
and costs, but also changes in the value 
of environmental and economic 
externalities that result from fuel 
consumption and vehicle use.597 These 
include the reduction in potential 
climate-related economic damages 
resulting from lower CO2 emissions, 
reduced damages to human health from 
lower emissions of criteria air 
pollutants, reductions in economic 
externalities associated with U.S. 
petroleum imports, and increases in 
traffic congestion, vehicle noise, and 
accidents caused by the increased 
driving that results through the fuel 
economy rebound effect. 
NHTSA has estimated most elements 
of the private and social benefits and 
costs that will result from its proposal 
to establish higher CAFE standards for 
model years 2012 through 2016, and the 
agency reports detailed empirical 
estimates of these impacts in this 
document and its Preliminary 
Regulatory Impact Analysis for the 
proposed rule. However, the agency is 
unable to provide a definitive 
accounting of the private costs and 
benefits from establishing higher CAFE 
standards, because we are unable to 
estimate the losses in consumer welfare 
that are likely to result from the effects 
of higher prices for on the number of 
new vehicles sold or on the mix of 
specific vehicle models that buyers 
decide to purchase. Assuming that the 
agency has correctly estimated each of 
the other costs and benefits that will 
result from the proposed rule, its 
estimates of the net private and total 
(private plus social) benefits represent 
their maximum possible values, and 
considering the rule’s impacts on 
consumer welfare would invariably 
reduce the agency’s reported estimates 
of the proposed rule’s net private and 
total benefits. 
If the agency’s estimates of technology 
costs are indeed adequate to maintain 
vehicles’ current levels of these other 
attributes constant, the only changes in 
vehicles’ characteristics resulting from 
higher CAFE standards will be 
improvements in the fuel economy and 
increases in sales prices for some (or 
perhaps even all) models. In this case, 
the welfare effects of requiring higher 
fuel economy depend on exactly how 
potential vehicle buyers value the future 
savings in fuel costs that they anticipate 
will result from purchasing vehicles 
with higher fuel economy. 
If the market for new vehicles is 
perfectly competitive and consumers 
have reliable information to estimate the 
likely magnitude and value of future 
fuel savings from buying more efficient 
models, economic theory suggests that 
they will make correct trade-offs 
between higher initial costs for 
purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles 
and subsequent reductions in their 
operating costs. These include lower 
fuel expenditures, savings in the time 
they spend refueling, and the benefits 
from any additional driving they do in 
response to its lower per-mile cost. The 
assumption that consumers have 
adequate information, foresight, and 
capability to make such trade-offs has 
been challenged on both theoretical and 
empirical grounds. If this assumption is 
accurate, however, no net private 
benefits can result from requiring higher 
fuel economy, since doing so will alter 
both the purchase prices of new cars 
and their lifetime streams of operating 
costs in ways that will inevitably reduce 
consumers’ well-being. 
The essence of this view is that in the 
absence of the regulation, consumers 
fully understand their current and 
future costs for owning and using 
vehicles, and make tradeoffs between 
these that maximize their individual 
welfare. From this viewpoint, CAFE 
standards—or any other regulation that 
alters this trade-off—will reduce their 
private well being. The intuition behind 
this conclusion is probably best 
captured by recognizing that automobile 
manufacturers currently sell a wide 
range of vehicle models, including 
many that already comply with the 
CAFE standards proposed in this rule. 
Yet sufficiently few buyers elect to 
purchase these vehicles that the average 
fuel economy of new vehicles sold 
today remains well below the levels this 
rule would require. 
On the other hand, a great deal of 
recent evidence suggests that many 
consumers do not accurately trade off 
current and future costs of owning and 
operating cars. For example, it appears 
that some buyers do not know how to 
estimate future savings in fuel costs 
from purchasing a higher-mpg vehicle, 
or that they incorrectly estimate the 
increased expense of purchasing a more 
fuel-efficient new car. In this situation, 
higher CAFE standards—which will 
increase purchase prices for new cars, 
but reduce their lifetime operating 
costs—can indeed improve consumers’ 
financial well-being. If these 
circumstances are widespread, then it is 
likely that requiring manufacturers to 
achieve higher fuel economy can 
increase private well-being, and thus 
that potentially significant savings in 
private costs can result from the 
proposed rule. 
Whether these circumstances are 
indeed typical is largely a question of 
the values that consumers place on 
additional fuel economy. NHTSA is not 
currently in a position to reach a 
conclusive judgment on this issue, and 
is thus unable to determine how 
requiring higher fuel economy levels is 
likely to affect consumer welfare, even 
if the only impacts of the proposed rule 
are to change the sales prices and fuel

economy levels of new cars and light 
trucks, as the agency assumes. 
Even if these are the only changes that 
result from the proposed rule, however, 
changes in the sales prices and fuel 
economy levels of some new vehicle 
models are likely to affect some 
potential buyers’ decisions about 
whether to purchase a car and what type 
or model to purchase. Research has 
demonstrated that previous CAFE rules 
and market-based changes in operating 
costs (for example, resulting from 
changes in gasoline prices) lead 
consumers to alter the number and 
types of cars they purchase, and that 
these changes can lead to losses in 
consumer well-being. However, NHTSA 
is not currently able to provide 
empirical estimates of the magnitude of 
potential losses in vehicle buyers’ 
welfare resulting from postponement of 
their decisions to purchase new vehicles 
or changes in the specific models they 
elect to buy. 
For both of these reasons, the likely 
impacts of adopting higher CAFE 
standards on consumer welfare remain 
unknown. Because changes in consumer 
welfare are an important component of 
the total private costs and benefits 
resulting from higher standards, the 
magnitude and even the direction of the 
net private economic impact of adopting 
stricter CAFE standards also remains 
unknown. 
How Do Consumers Value Fuel 
Economy? 
For this proposed rule, NHTSA 
estimates several sources of private 
benefits to vehicle buyers, including 
savings in future fuel costs, the value of 
time saved due to less frequent 
refueling, and utility gained from 
additional travel that results from the 
rebound effect. In combination, the 
agency’s estimates suggest that these 
private savings greatly outweigh its 
estimates of the costs to consumers for 
providing higher fuel economy, even 
without accounting for the additional 
social benefits from higher fuel 
economy. This is due primarily to the 
very large estimated value of future fuel 
savings from higher fuel economy, 
which in turn partly reflects the 
agency’s use of modest discount rates (3 
percent and 7 percent). 
Even without considering the 
unmeasured welfare losses likely to 
result from changes in the number of 
new cars sold and the specific models 
purchased, however, this finding 
presents a conundrum. On the one 
hand, requiring higher fuel economy 
levels appears likely to produce large 
net benefits, primarily because the 
increased cost of producing more fuel- 
efficient cars and light trucks appears to 
be far outweighed by the value of the 
future fuel savings projected to result 
from higher fuel economy (assuming 
modest discount rates). At the same 
time, however, vehicle manufacturers 
currently produce many models that 
would allow them to meet the proposed 
higher CAFE standards, yet at least on 
average, buyers reveal a preference for 
lower fuel economy than the proposed 
rule would require. 
In this situation, often referred to as 
the Energy Efficiency Paradox, 
consumers appear not to purchase 
products that are in their economic 
self-interest. There are theoretical 
reasons that could explain such 
behavior: consumers may be myopic, 
and thus undervalue the long term; they 
might lack information or be unable to 
use it properly even when it is 
presented to them; they may be 
particularly averse to potential 
short-term losses associated with 
purchasing energy-efficient products 
(the behavioral phenomenon of ‘‘loss 
aversion’’); or even if consumers have 
relevant knowledge, the benefits of 
energy efficient vehicles might not seem 
sufficiently important to them at the 
time they decide to purchase a new car. 
A great deal of work in behavioral 
economics has suggested the possibility 
that factors of this sort help account for 
the Energy Efficiency Paradox. 
Another possible explanation for the 
paradox between the apparently large 
private benefits to vehicle buyers from 
requiring higher fuel economy and the 
reluctance of many buyers to purchase 
new vehicles with higher fuel economy 
is that consumers may apply much 
higher discount rates than the agency 
has used when they evaluate future cost 
savings from purchasing more fuel- 
efficient vehicles or other capital goods 
offering gains in energy efficiency. For 
example, the Energy Information 
Agency (1996) has used discount rates 
as high as 111 percent for water heaters 
and 120 percent for electric clothes 
dryers.598 
Some evidence also suggests directly 
that vehicle buyers employ high 
discount rates: consumers surveyed by 
Kubik (2006) reported that fuel savings 
would have to be adequate to pay back 
the additional purchase price of a more 
fuel-efficient vehicle in less than 3 years 
to persuade a typical buyer to purchase 
it. 599 In short, there appears to be no 
consensus in the literature on what the 
private discount rate should be in the 
context of vehicle purchase decisions. 
Another possible reconciliation of the 
Energy Efficiency Paradox, which poses 
a significant complication for evaluating 
the private benefits resulting from 
higher CAFE standards, is that the 
values consumers place on the future 
savings from higher fuel economy may 
vary sufficiently widely that it is 
unclear whether on average this value 
exceeds the costs of providing higher 
fuel economy. A 1988 review of 
consumers’ willingness to pay for 
improved fuel economy found estimates 
that varied by more than an order of 
magnitude: For a $1 per year reduction 
in vehicle operating costs, consumers 
would be willing to spend between 
$0.74 and $25.97 in increased vehicle 
price.600 (For comparison, the present 
value of saving $1 per year on fuel for 
15 years at a 3 percent discount rate is 
$11.94, while a 7 percent discount rate 
produces a present value of $8.78.) 
Thus, this study finds that some 
consumers appear to be willing to pay 
far too much to obtain future fuel 
savings, while others may be willing to 
pay far too little. 
Although NHTSA has not found an 
updated survey of these values, a few 
examples suggest that vehicle choice 
models also imply wide variation in 
estimates of how much people are 
willing to pay for fuel savings. For 
instance, Espey and Nair (2005) and 
McManus (2006) find that consumers 
are willing to pay nearly $600 extra to 
purchase a vehicle that achieves one 
additional mile per gallon.601 In 
contrast, Gramlich (2008) finds that 
consumers’ willingness to pay for an 
increase from 25 mpg to 30 mpg varies 
between $4,100 (for luxury cars when 
gasoline costs $2/gallon) to $20,560 (for 
SUVs when gasoline costs $3.50/ 
gallon).602 Thus, some buyers appear

not to make accurate trade-offs between 
higher initial purchase prices and 
subsequent fuel savings. At the same 
time, however, these results may simply 
reflect the fact that the expected savings 
from purchasing higher fuel economy 
vary widely among individuals, because 
they travel different amounts or have 
different driving styles. 
Finally, it is possible that the 
apparent Energy Efficiency Paradox is in 
fact not a paradox at all when one 
considers the uncertainty surrounding 
future fuel prices and a vehicle’s 
expected lifetime and usage. As Metcalf 
and Rosenthal (1995) indicate, 
purchasing higher fuel economy 
requires buyers to weigh known, 
up-front costs that are essentially 
irreversible (that is, they have a 
relatively low salvage value if the return 
never materializes) against an unknown 
future stream of fuel savings.603 They 
find some evidence that this accounts 
for a large portion of the seeming 
inconsistency between low cost 
opportunities to invest in energy 
efficiency and the current lack of 
investment in them. This would not 
imply failure on the part of consumers 
in making decisions, but rather that the 
rate of return buyers require on their 
vehicle purchases (or other energy 
efficiency investments) is much higher 
than that implied by a 3 percent 
discount rate that does not include a 
provision for uncertainty. 
Greene et al. (2009) find additional 
support for this conclusion in the 
context of fuel economy decisions: They 
find that the expected net present value 
of increasing the fuel economy of a 
passenger car from 28 to 35 miles per 
gallon falls from $405 when calculated 
using standard net present value 
calculations to nearly zero when 
uncertainty regarding future cost 
savings is taken into account.604 In 
contrast to Metcalf and Rosenthal, 
Greene et al. find that uncertainty 
regarding the future price of gasoline is 
less important than uncertainty 
surrounding the expected lifetimes of 
new vehicles. Supporting this 
hypothesis is a finding by Dasgupta et 
al. (2007) that consumers are more 
likely to lease than buy a vehicle with 
higher maintenance costs, because 
leasing provides them with the option to 
return it before those costs become too 
high.605 
In contrast, other research suggests 
that the Energy Efficiency Paradox is 
real and significant, and owes to 
consumers’ inability to value future fuel 
savings appropriately. For example, 
Sanstad and Howarth (1994) argue that 
consumers optimize behavior without 
full information by resorting to 
imprecise but convenient rules of 
thumb. Larrick and Soll (2008) find 
evidence that consumers do not 
understand how to translate changes in 
miles per gallon into fuel savings.606 If 
the behavior identified in these studies 
is indeed widespread, then significant 
gains to consumers can result from 
requiring higher fuel economy. 
How NHTSA Proposes To Treat the 
Issue of Welfare Losses 
In the course of future rulemakings, 
the agency intends to explore methods 
that would allow it to present a more 
comprehensive accounting of private 
costs and benefits from requiring higher 
fuel economy, including more detailed 
estimates of changes in the welfare of 
new vehicle buyers that are likely to 
result from higher CAFE standards. One 
promising approach to estimating the 
full welfare loss associated with CAFE’s 
impact on vehicle purchasing decisions 
is using consumer vehicle choice 
models to evaluate the simultaneous 
effects of increases in sales prices, 
improvements in fuel economy, and 
changes in other attributes of specific 
vehicle models, rather than in the 
average values of these variables. 
NHTSA invites comments on the state 
of the art of consumer vehicle choice 
modeling, as well as on the prospects 
for these models to yield reliable 
estimates of changes in consumer 
welfare from requiring higher fuel 
economy. 
7. What Are the Estimated Safety 
Impacts of These Proposed Standards? 
As discussed above, in evaluating the 
appropriate levels at which to establish 
new CAFE standards, NHTSA must 
assess any potential safety trade-offs. 
Safety trade-offs associated with fuel 
economy increases have occurred in the 
past and the possibility of future ones 
remains a concern. In the 
congressionally-mandated report 
entitled ‘‘Effectiveness and Impact of 
Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
(CAFE) Standards,’’ a committee of the 
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 
(‘‘2002 NAS Report’’) 607 concluded that 
the then-existing form of passenger car 
and light truck CAFE standards, 
together with market forces, created an 
incentive for vehicle manufacturers to 
comply in part by downweighting and 
even downsizing their vehicles and that 
these actions led to additional fatalities. 
Given the cost advantages of downsizing 
instead of substituting lighter, higher 
strength materials, NAS urged that the 
CAFE program be restructured to reduce 
the regulatory incentive to downsize. As 
NAS observed, the ability to reduce 
weight without reducing size does not 
mean they will exclusively rely on those 
means of weight reduction. Responding 
to NAS’ concern, Congress mandated in 
EISA that CAFE standards be based on 
an attribute related to fuel economy, like 
footprint or weight. 
Given the relative cost-effectiveness of 
at least some approaches to weight 
reduction, it is reasonable to assume 
that the vehicle manufacturers will 
choose weight reduction as one means 
of achieving compliance with the 
proposed standards. In fact, informal 
statements by the vehicle manufacturers 
themselves indicate that they intend to 
engage in some weight reduction, as 
appropriate for certain vehicle models, 
during the rulemaking time frame. 
While the manufacturers generally 
indicate that they plan to reduce weight 
without reducing size, their adherence 
to those plans would not remove all 
bases for any safety concerns. 
The question of the effect of changes 
in vehicle weight on safety in the 
context of fuel economy is a complex 
question that poses serious analytic 
challenges and has been a contentious 
issue for many years. This 
contentiousness arises, at least in part, 
from the difficulty of isolating vehicle 
weight from other confounding factors 
(e.g., driver behavior, or vehicle factors 
such as engine size and wheelbase). In 
addition, at least in the past, several 
vehicle factors have been closely 
related, such as vehicle mass, 
wheelbase, track width, and structural 
integrity. The issue has been addressed 
in the literature for more than two 
decades. For the reader’s reference, 
much more information about safety in

610 Vehicle footprint is not synonymous with 
vehicle size. Since the footprint is only that portion 
of the vehicle between the front and rear axles, 
footprint based standards do not discourage 
downsizing the portions of a vehicle in front of the 
front axle and to the rear of the rear axle. The crush 
space provided by those portions of a vehicle can 
make important contributions to managing crash 
energy. 611 Id. 
the CAFE context is available in the MY 
2011 final rule 608 and in Section IX of 
the PRIA. 
Conducting the safety assessment for 
this rulemaking is thus difficult since, 
in general, it is unclear to what extent 
the higher fatality risk of smaller and 
lighter vehicles is associated with their 
reduced mass as compared to their 
reduced physical dimensions. That is 
because, historically, the safest vehicles 
have been heavy and large, while the 
vehicles with the highest fatal-crash 
rates have been light and small, both 
because the crash rate is higher for 
small/light vehicles and because the 
fatality rate is higher for small/light 
vehicle crashes.609 Intuitively, a 
reduction in mass while maintaining 
physical dimensions is likely to be less 
harmful than a reduction in both mass 
and physical dimensions. 
As noted above, the manufacturers 
have generally informally stated that 
they plan to use weight reduction 
methods that do not involve size 
reduction. That is plausible since the 
selection of footprint as the attribute in 
setting CAFE standards helps to 
minimize the incentive to reduce a 
vehicle’s physical dimensions. This is 
because as footprint decreases, the 
corresponding fuel economy target 
decreases.610 
However, NHTSA cautions that 
vehicle footprint is not synonymous 
with vehicle size. Since the footprint is 
only that portion of the vehicle bounded 
by the front and rear axles and by the 
wheels, footprint based standards do not 
discourage downsizing the portions of a 
vehicle in front of the front axle and to 
the rear of the rear axle (front and rear 
overhand). Similarly, they do not 
discourage downsizing the portions of a 
vehicle outside its wheels (side 
overhang). The crush space provided by 
those portions of a vehicle can make 
important contributions to managing 
crash energy. We note that at least one 
manufacturer has confidentially 
indicated plans to reduce overhang as a 
way of reducing weight on some 
vehicles during the rulemaking time 
frame. 
Neither the CAFE standards nor our 
analysis of the feasibility of fuel 
economy improvements mandates mass 
reduction or any other specific 
technology application. In addition, 
considering NHTSA’s analysis of the 
observed relationship between vehicle 
mass and the prevalence of fatalities, 
NHTSA has, except for vehicles with 
baseline curb weight over 5,000 pounds, 
excluded weight reduction from its 
analysis of potential CAFE standards in 
past rulemakings. The agency followed 
this analytical approach in order to 
ensure that its consideration of new 
standards was not dependent on weight 
reduction that could potentially 
compromise highway safety, 
recognizing, though, that the structure 
of CAFE standards does not prohibit 
manufacturers from making such 
responses to new CAFE standards. The 
agency implemented this approach by 
setting the Volpe model to apply this 
exclusion when estimating how 
manufacturers could apply technology 
in response to new CAFE standards. 
In its rulemakings on MY 2008–2011 
light truck CAFE standards and MY 
2011 car and light truck CAFE 
standards, NHTSA received comments 
suggesting that NHTSA expand the 
applicability of weight reduction 
technologies in its modeling to vehicles 
under 5,000 pounds, because, according 
to the commenters, weight reduction 
can be accompanied by proper vehicle 
design to assure that vehicle safety is 
not compromised. In the final rules in 
those rulemakings, the agency said that 
there may be great possibilities in the 
use of material substitution and other 
processes to minimize the safety effects 
of reducing weight. The agency further 
noted that this should be explored as 
data become available. 
After reviewing its assumptions and 
methodologies per the President’s 
January 26 memorandum and working 
with EPA in this rulemaking, NHTSA 
revised its approach to include weight 
reduction of up to 5–10 percent of 
baseline curb weight, depending on 
vehicle type. Recently-submitted 
manufacturer product plans as well as 
public statements from a number of the 
manufacturers suggest some of them 
expect that by MY 2016, they will be 
able to reduce the weight of some 
specific vehicle models by similar 
levels. However, NHTSA does not 
believe that, except where already 
planned, such significant weight 
reductions can be achieved in MY 2012 
or MY 2013, because there is not enough 
lead time for the necessary design, 
engineering, and tooling. NHTSA 
estimates that weight reductions of 1.5 
percent can be achieved during 
redesigns occurring prior to MY 2014, 
and that weight reductions of 5–10 
percent can be achieved in redesigns 
occurring in MY 2014 or later. For 
purposes of analyzing CAFE standards, 
NHTSA has further assumed that weight 
reductions would be limited to 5 
percent for small vehicles (e.g., 
subcompact passenger cars), and that 
reductions of 10 percent would only be 
applied to the larger vehicle types (e.g., 
large light trucks). 
NHTSA’s modeling approach is 
similar to EPA’s in terms of maximum 
available weight reduction for any 
vehicle model, sensitive to vehicle 
safety in terms of when and to which 
vehicle types significant weight 
reduction can be achieved safely, and 
supported by information in some 
manufacturers’ product plans. Some 
manufacturers have indicated that, in 
later model years, they plan to reduce 
significantly the weight of some specific 
vehicle models, and that they plan to do 
so without reducing vehicle size. 
NHTSA’s analysis results in similar 
degrees of weight reduction, applied 
more widely to some manufacturers. 
NHTSA notes, though, that some 
manufacturers are also planning 
considerable changes in product mix, 
and some of these changes could mean 
reduced average size along with reduced 
average weight. In NHTSA’s (and EPA’s) 
analysis, such changes in product mix 
are not counted, because they are either 
in the baseline market forecast, or are 
not estimated. 
As stated above, neither the CAFE 
standards nor our analysis mandates 
mass reduction, or mandates that if 
mass reduction occurs, it be done in any 
specific manner. However, mass 
reduction is one of the technology 
applications available to the 
manufacturers and has been used by 
them in the past. A degree of mass 
reduction is used by the Volpe model in 
determining the capabilities of 
manufacturers and in predicting both 
cost and fuel consumption impacts of 
improved CAFE standards. 
In this section, we briefly summarize 
our analysis of the potential impacts of 
these mass reductions on vehicle safety. 
NHTSA’s quantified analysis is based 
on the 2003 Kahane study,611 which 
estimates the effect of 100-pound 
reductions in MYs 1991–1999 heavy 
light trucks and vans (LTVs), light LTVs, 
heavy passenger cars, and light 
passenger cars. The study compares the 
fatality rates of LTVs and cars to 
quantify differences between vehicle

612 We note that the Volpe model currently does 
not account for the weight of safety standards that 
will be added compared to the MY 2008 baseline, 
nor does it account for the societal cost of 
reductions in weight. However, both of these items 
will be added to the model for the final rule; doing 
so will raise the weight of every vehicle by roughly 
17 pounds in MY 2016 (slightly less in earlier 
years), which will likely require manufacturers to 
add slightly more technology to reach the final 
standards than they were estimated to need to reach 
the proposed standards. However, NHTSA does not 
expect the impact of these roughly 17 pounds per 
vehicle to have a significant impact on the safety 
analysis. 
613 Blincoe, L. and Shankar, U, ‘‘The Impact of 
Safety Standards and Behavioral Trends on Motor 
Vehicle Fatality Rates,’’ DOT HS 810 777, January 
2007. See Table 4 comparing 2020 to 2007 (37,906/ 
43,363 = 12.6% reduction (1¥.126 = .874).

reduction on different crash modes, see 
Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy Standards, NAS 1972, pp 74–75. 
types, given drivers of the same age/ 
gender, etc. In this analysis, the effect of 
‘‘weight reduction’’ is not limited to the 
effect of mass per se, but includes all the 
factors, such as length, width, structural 
strength, and size of the occupant 
compartment, that were naturally or 
historically confounded with mass in 
MYs 1991–1999 vehicles. The rationale 
is that adding length, width, or strength 
to a vehicle will also make it heavier. 
The agency utilized the relationships 
between weight and safety from Kahane 
(2003), expressed as percentage 
increases in fatalities per 100-pound 
weight reduction, and examined the 
weight impacts assumed in this CAFE 
analysis. However, there are several 
identifiable safety trends that are 
already in place or expected to occur in 
the foreseeable future and that are not 
accounted for in the study. For example, 
two important new safety standards that 
have already been issued and will be 
phasing in during the rulemaking time 
frame. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety 
Standard No. 126 (49 CFR 571.126) will 
require electronic stability control in all 
new vehicles by MY 2012, and the 
upgrade to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety 
Standard No. 214 (Side Impact 
Protection, 49 CFR 571.214) will likely 
result in all new vehicles being 
equipped with head-curtain air bags by 
MY 2014.612 Additionally, we anticipate 
continued improvements in driver (and 
passenger) behavior, such as higher 
safety belt use rates. All of these will 
tend to reduce the absolute number of 
fatalities resulting from weight 
reductions. Thus, while the percentage 
increases in Kahane (2003) was applied, 
the reduced base has resulted in smaller 
absolute increases than those that were 
predicted in the 2003 report. 
The agency examined the impacts of 
the identifiable safety trends over the 
lifetime of the vehicles produced in 
each model year. An estimate of these 
impacts was contained in a previous 
agency report.613 The impacts were 
estimated on a year-by-year basis, but 
could be examined in a combined 
fashion. The agency assumed that the 
safety trends will result in a reduction 
in the target population of fatalities from 
which the weight impacts are derived. 
Using this method, we found a 12.6 
percent reduction in fatality levels 
between 2007 and 2020. The estimates 
derived from applying Kahane’s 
percentages to a baseline of 2007 
fatalities were thus multiplied by 0.874 
to account for changes that the agency 
believes will take place in passenger car 
and light truck safety between the 2007 
baseline on-road fleet used for this 
particular analysis and year 2020. 
We note that because these new 
analyses are based on the method 
shown in Kahane (2003), which predicts 
the safety effect of 100-pound mass 
reductions in MY 1991–1999 light 
trucks and vans (LTVs) and passenger 
cars, the new analyses need to be 
understood in the context of that study. 
Specifically, the numbers in the new 
analyses represent an upper bound (or 
worst case) fatality estimate—that is, the 
estimate would only apply if all weight 
reductions come from reducing both 
weight and footprint. Kahane’s 
conclusions are based upon a cross- 
sectional analysis of the actual on-road 
safety experience of 1991–1999 
vehicles. For those vehicles, heavier 
usually also meant larger-footprint. 
Hence, the numbers in the new analyses 
predict the safety-related fatalities that 
would occur in the unlikely event that 
weight reduction for MYs 2012–2016 is 
accomplished entirely by reducing mass 
and reducing footprint. 
Exclusive reliance on downsizing for 
the model years covered by this 
rulemaking is unlikely for the following 
reasons. As noted above, the 
manufacturers have generally indicated 
that they plan reduce weight without 
reducing size. Further, the flat CAFE 
standards in effect when those MY 
1991–1999 vehicles were produced had 
no penalty for such a strategy for 
improving fuel economy. In contrast, as 
discussed above, the current attribute- 
based CAFE standards do not encourage 
vehicle downsizing by reducing 
footprint. This structural change to the 
CAFE program means that the CAFE 
standards now favor the use of weight 
reduction strategies that do not involve 
simply making that portion of the 
vehicle smaller. These other strategies 
include downsizing the engine and 
adding turbocharging, as well as 
materials substitution. 
Given this structural change to the 
CAFE program, it is likely that a 
significant portion of the weight 
reduction in the MY 2012–2016 vehicles 
will be accomplished by strategies that 
have a lesser safety impact than the 
prevalent 1990s strategy of simply 
making the vehicles smaller, although 
NHTSA is unable to predict how large 
a portion. For example, a manufacturer 
could conceivably add length, width, or 
strength to a vehicle by replacing 
existing materials with light, high- 
strength components. 
To the extent that future weight 
reductions could be achieved by 
substituting light, high-strength 
materials for existing materials— 
without any accompanying reduction in 
the size or structural strength of the 
vehicle—then NHTSA believes that the 
fatality increases associated with the 
weight reductions anticipated by the 
model as a result of the proposed 
standards could be significantly smaller 
than those in the worst-case scenario. 
However, NHTSA does not currently 
have information (on-road data) to 
calibrate and predict how much smaller 
those increases would be for any given 
mixture of material substitution and 
downsizing, since the data on the safety 
effects of mass reduction alone is not 
available due to the low numbers of 
vehicles in the current on-road fleet that 
have utilized this technology 
extensively. Further, to the extent that 
weight reductions were accomplished 
through use of light, high-strength 
materials, there would be significant 
additional costs that would need to be 
determined and accounted for. Those 
higher costs are not reflected in 
NHTSA’s cost-benefit analysis for this 
proposal. 
Nevertheless, even though NHTSA 
cannot quantify these safety effects, we 
can project that they could be 
significantly less than those that would 
result from simple downsizing. 
However, we are also convinced that the 
safety effects are larger than zero for the 
following reasons: 
• The effects of mass per se (laws of 
physics) will persist regardless whether 
mass is reduced by material 
substitution, downsizing, or any other 
method. There are a variety of crash 
types that could be impacted in various 
ways by changes in vehicle weight and 
at times by the way in which the 
vehicle’s weight is changed. The 
following discussion examines weight 
reduction by either engine size 
reductions or material substitution and 
its impact on each of the different crash 
types.614

pounds and that Car B weighs X¥100

615 Blincoe et al., The Economic Impact of Motor 
Vehicle Crashes 2000, May 2002, DOT HS 809 446. 
Data from this report were updated for inflation and 
combined with the current DOT guidance on value 
of a statistical life to estimate the comprehensive 
value of a statistical life. 
616 Based on data in Blincoe et al., updated for 
inflation and reflecting the Department’s current 
VSL of $5.8 million. 
pounds and that Cars A and B have the 
same footprint, overhang and structural 
strength. 
Æ Single-vehicle crashes 
Hitting an immovable object (like a 
big tree or bridge abutment). 
In most cases, there would be little 
impact on vehicle safety if Car A and 
Car B each hit a different immovable 
object at the same speed because the 
change in velocity (delta-V) would be 
the same for both vehicles. 
Hitting a partially movable object (like 
a small tree, parked car, storefront, or 
dwelling). 
Heavier vehicles will impart more 
force to movable objects than lighter 
vehicles. This will increase the chance 
that the movable objects will break, 
crush, or otherwise give way and 
increase the distance over which the 
striking vehicle can decelerate, which 
will reduce the delta-V for the vehicle’s 
occupants. 
Single-vehicle rollovers. 
Smaller vehicles end up in more 
rollover crashes than larger vehicles. 
Part of the reason for this is the static 
stability factor, since smaller vehicles 
have less track width. Part of the reason 
for this is the way smaller vehicles are 
driven. Given the same track width for 
Car A and Car B, the impact on rollovers 
is hard to determine since the weight 
helps build up momentum and the 
influence of momentum versus weight 
for tripped rollovers is hard to discern. 
Æ Multi-vehicle crashes 
Frontal impact—two light vehicles. 
While a collision of Car B with Car B 
is likely to have the same risk as a 
similar collision of Car A with Car A, 
the final answer on safety will depend 
upon what vehicle sizes receive overall 
weight reductions. As NHTSA’s study 
shows, if weight is taken out of the 
larger light trucks, overall safety is 
improved. If weight is taken out of 
passenger cars or smaller light trucks, 
overall safety decreases. Overall, we 
can’t determine whether there will be an 
overall difference in safety. 
Side impact—struck vehicle. 
As a struck vehicle, Car B is at a 
disadvantage because its delta V would 
be increased. Car B would be less safe. 
Side impact—striking vehicle. 
NHTSA analyses have shown that for 
a striking vehicle in a side impact, 
weight is not as important as striking 
height. Weight does have an impact, 
because of imparting a lower delta V on 
the struck vehicle. When struck by Car 
B, the struck vehicle would be 
somewhat safer. 
Side impact—overall. 
Overall, there will be a minimal 
difference in safety. 
Collision with an older light vehicle. 
Car B would experience a higher delta 
V and a higher fatality risk than Car A, 
if either were struck by the same pre- 
2012 vehicle. But the occupants of the 
older vehicle would experience a lower 
delta V and a lower risk if struck by Car 
B. 
Collision with a medium-sized truck 
(somewhat over 10,000 GVWR). 
Medium-size trucks are not affected 
by CAFE and do not need to decrease 
their weight. Car B would experience a 
higher delta V and a higher risk than Car 
A. (The risk to the occupants of the 
medium-size truck would be minimally 
higher with Car A.) Overall, Car B 
would be less safe. 
Collision with a fully-loaded tractor 
trailer (significantly over 10,000 
GVWR). 
Car B would experience a higher delta 
V than Car A, but in this case, the 
difference in delta V would be minimal. 
Risk would be similar in both cars. 
Æ Pedestrian/bicyclist impacts 
In general, Car A would impose a 
slightly higher delta V on the pedestrian 
than Car B, but the difference would be 
so small that risk for the pedestrian 
would essentially be the same either 
way. 
• Our attribute-based standards have 
the excellent feature that they can avoid 
encouraging reductions in footprint. 
However, weight can be removed by 
downsizing, rather than material 
substitution, even while maintaining 
footprint: 
Æ By reducing the overhang in front 
of the front wheels and behind the rear 
wheels. These are protective structures 
whose removal would increase risk to 
occupants by reducing vehicle crush 
space. 
Æ By thinning or removing structures 
within the vehicle. 
• NHTSA has found that lighter 
vehicles are driven in a manner that 
results in a higher involvement rate in 
fatal crashes, even after controlling for 
the driver’s age, gender, urbanization, 
and region of the country. However, in 
our response in the MY 2011 final rule 
to the DRI analyses, we were unable to 
attribute this effect to any obvious 
‘‘size’’ parameter such as track width or 
wheelbase. In non-rollover crashes, 
weight continued to be the most 
important parameter, even when track 
width and wheelbase were included as 
independent variables. Until we 
understand the phenomenon better, we 
assume that weight reduction is likely to 
be associated with higher fatal-crash 
rates, no matter how the weight 
reduction is achieved. 
Table IV.G.7–1 below shows the 
results of NHTSA’s worst case analysis 
of safety-related fatalities separately for 
each model year. Additionally, the 
societal impacts of increasing fatalities 
can be monetized using DOT’s 
estimated comprehensive cost per life of 
$6.1 million. This consists of a value of 
a statistical life of $5.8 million plus 
external economic costs associated with 
fatalities such as medical care, 
insurance administration costs and legal 
costs.615 
NHTSA has also calculated an 
assumed impact on injuries and added 
that to the societal costs of fatalities. 
This assumed impact is based on past 
studies indicating that fatalities account 
for roughly 44 percent of total 
comprehensive costs due to injury.616 If 
weight impacts non-fatal injuries 
roughly proportional to its impact on 
fatalities, then total costs would be 
roughly 2.3 times those noted in Table 
IV.G.7–2. The potential societal costs for 
just fatalities are shown in Table IV.G.7– 
2. The combined potential social costs 
are shown in Table IV.G.7–4. 
Looking at the results on a calendar 
year basis, we also note that the safety 
impacts of the Kahane analysis based 
weight reduction have a slow onset. 
Passenger cars typically have a 10–25 
year lifetime, and light trucks somewhat 
longer. Thus, some of the fatalities for 
MY 2016 light trucks will not occur 
until after 2050. Moreover, the weight 
reductions are small in the early model 
years 2012 and 2013. The vehicles with 
reduced weight will only be a small 
proportion of the entire on-road fleet in 
the initial calendar years of these 
proposed CAFE standards. The 
influence of these factors is illustrated 
in Table IV.G.7–3 below. 
Additionally, there will be significant 
fuel-saving benefits from these proposed 
standards, up to 61.6 billion gallons 
during the lifetime of MYs 2012–2016 
vehicles. There will also be significant 
reductions in CO2 emissions, up to 656 
million metric tons during that same 
time period. 
Improved fuel economy will also 
result in a decrease in harmful criteria 
pollutants, which will decrease 
premature deaths due to a number of 
diseases related to environmental 
pollution. The literature strongly 
supports the causal relationship 
between health and exposure to criteria 
pollutants. However, as with vehicle 
safety impacts, there is much

uncertainty regarding the exact level of 
health impacts that might be achieved 
with this rule. Thus, there are 
potentially both positive and negative 
impacts that could result from this 
rulemaking. We have not attempted to 
quantify other beneficial health impacts 
that are expected to result from the 
proposed standards, including the 
results of a decrease in the rate of global 
warming, and increased energy security 
resulting from a lesser dependence on 
oil imported volatile regions of the 
world, but they, too, could be 
significant. 
In summary, the agency recognizes 
the balancing inherent in achieving 
higher levels of fuel economy through 
reduction of vehicle weight. We 
emphasize that these safety-related 
fatality estimates represent a worst case 
scenario for the potential effects of this 
rulemaking, and that actual fatalities 
will be less than these estimates, 
possibly significantly less, based on the 
qualitative discussion above of the 
various factors that could reduce the 
estimates. At the same time, however, 
the agency cannot specify a reasonable 
lower-bound estimate. It is possible that 
the impact could be fairly small, but the 
agency is unable to specify a lower- 
bound at this time due to a lack of 
studies that address the safety risk 
associated with weight reduction that is 
not also accompanied by size reduction. 
Additionally, the estimates presented 
here do not include estimates for 
injuries. Nevertheless, we believe that 
the balancing is reasonable. 
In the absence of data that permit 
examining the fatality impact of 
reductions in weight and footprint 
independently, we considered whether 
it would be appropriate to use the 
industry-sponsored DRI study to 
estimate a lower-bound value. However, 
as noted below, the agency’s inability to 
reproduce DRI’s results raises questions 
whether the DRI reports sufficiently 
satisfy reproducibility criteria and thus 
have the quality, objectivity, utility, and 
integrity needed for information relied 
upon and disseminated by the Federal 
Government to the public. Reliance 
upon non-reproducible studies 
undermines the credibility of the 
Government’s scientific information. 
Further, the DRI reports raise a 
significant additional data quality 
concern. They have not been subjected 
to a rigorous form of peer review. 
DRI produced several studies between 
2000 and 2005, funded by a 
manufacturer of small vehicles and 
purporting to analyze mass, track width, 
and wheelbase as independent 
variables. DRI’s 2002 paper indicated 
that reducing mass would be beneficial, 
while reducing track width and 
wheelbase would be harmful. If true, 
this meant that weight reduction would 
benefit safety if track width and 
wheelbase were maintained. However, 
NHTSA has concluded that the 2002 
DRI study inadvertently introduced 
significant biases in the analysis, as a 
result of including 2-door cars in the 
analysis. Dr. Kahane’s analyses have 
excluded 2-door passenger cars on the 
grounds that in the data reviewed in 
those analyses (and by DRI in its 
analysis), 2-door cars consisted in 
considerable part of sports and muscle 
cars. Including sports and muscle cars 
in a regression analysis of vehicle 
weight and safety biases the results for 
two primary reasons: first, because 
sports and muscle cars tend to have 
short wheelbases but be relatively heavy 
for their size, they function as outliers 
in the regression analysis and thus 
distort the derived relationships and 
second, because sports and muscle cars 
as a group tend to be disproportionately 
involved in crashes. NHTSA provided 
this response to DRI publicly in 2004.617 
In response, DRI submitted a new study 
in 2005 with a sensitivity analysis 
limited to 4-door cars, excluding police 
cars. DRI further stated that it could 
mimic NHTSA’s logistic regression 
approach for an analysis of model year 
1991–98 4-door cars in calendar year 
1995–1999 crashes. DRI stated that its 
updated 2005 analysis still showed 
results directionally similar to its earlier 
work—increased risk for lower track 
width and wheelbase, reduced risk for 
lower mass—although DRI 
acknowledged that the wheelbase and 
mass effects were no longer statistically 
significant after removing the 2-door 
cars from the analysis. 
Since receiving it, NHTSA has 
disagreed with the results of DRI’s 2005 
analysis, most recently on record in the 
MY 2011 CAFE final rule, for two 
primary reasons. First, even using the 
same (NHTSA) data and methodology as 
DRI used, NHTSA has been unable to 
reproduce DRI’s 2005 results. And 
second, to our knowledge, unlike Dr. 
Kahane’s 2003 study, DRI’s 2005 study 
has not been rigorously peer-reviewed. 
The following provides an example of 
how NHTSA has tried to reproduce 
DRI’s results, unsuccessfully. In MY 
1991–1998, the average car weighing x 
+ 100 pounds had a track width that 
was 0.34 inches larger and a wheelbase 
that was 1.01 inches longer. Thus, one 
could say that a ‘‘historical’’ 100-pound 
weight reduction would have been 
accompanied by a 0.34 inch track width 
reduction and a 1.01 inch wheelbase 
reduction. However, using a reasonable 
check, if one dissociates weight, track 
width, and wheelbase and treats them as 
independent parameters, DRI’s logistic 
regression of model year 1991–1998 4- 
door cars excluding police cars 
attributes the following effects:

618 Regression analysis involves modeling and 
analyzing several variables, when the focus is on 
the relationship between a dependent variable and 
one or more independent variables. Logistic 
regression analysis involves three variables. 
619 See, e.g., Kahane (2003), Table 2 on p. xi. 
However, applying NHTSA’s logistic 
regression analyses 618 to NHTSA’s 
database, exactly as described in the 
agency’s response to comments on its 
2003 report, except for limiting the data 
to model years 1991–98, instead of 
1991–99, produces results that are not at 
all like DRI’s. Mass still has the largest 
effect, exceeding track width, and it 
moves in the expected direction. 
NHTSA obtained its estimates by 
adding the results from 12 individual 
logistic regressions: Six types of crashes 
multiplied by two car-weight groups 
(less than 2,950 pounds; 2,950 pounds 
or more).619 DRI does not appear to have 
followed the same procedures, based on 
the widely differing results. 
Based on our review, NHTSA is not 
persuaded by the DRI analysis. 
NHTSA’s analyses do not corroborate 
the 2005 DRI study that suggested mass 
could be reduced without safety harm 
and perhaps with safety benefit. 
Moreover, even though NHTSA’s 
analyses continue to attribute a much 
larger effect for mass than for track 
width or wheelbase in small cars, 
NHTSA has never said that mass alone 
is the single factor that increases or 
decreases fatality risk. There may not be 
a single factor, but rather it may be that 
mass and some of the other factors that 
are historically correlated with mass, 
such as wheelbase and track width, 
together are the factors. 
We note that comparatively it would 
seem the least harmful way to reduce 
mass would be from material 
substitution, where one replaces a heavy 
material with a lighter one that delivers 
the same performance, or other designs 
that reduce mass while maintaining 
wheelbase and track width. While this 
may seem intuitively to be the case, 
there is an absence of supporting data 
for the thrust of the 2005 DRI analysis, 
because those changes have not 
happened to any substantial number of 
vehicles in the real world. NHTSA thus 
has no way, yet, of proving the intuitive 
conclusion. We do know that mass has 
historically been correlated with 
wheelbase and track width, and that 
reductions in mass have also reduced 
those other factors. Until there is an 
analysis that clearly demonstrates that 
mass does not matter for safety, NHTSA 
concludes it should be guided by the 
decades’ worth of studies suggesting

that mass is the most important of the 
related factors. 
The tables below contain NHTSA’s 
estimates of the safety-related fatality 
impacts of the proposed standards, the 
costs associated with those impacts, and 
the overall change in impacts given 
other anticipated mitigating effects 
during the next several years. Again, we 
emphasize that the safety-related fatality 
impacts presented below represent a 
worst case scenario, and that NHTSA 
believes that the fatality increases 
associated with the anticipated weight 
reductions could be significantly 
smaller than those shown, because 
manufacturers are unlikely to respond 
to this rulemaking by decreasing the 
footprint or reducing the structural 
integrity of their vehicles. 
In addition, we note that the 
implementation of new Federal Motor 
Vehicle Safety Standards, combined 
with behavioral changes (e.g., further 
increases in safety belt use), will 
produce important reductions in the 
number of deaths and injuries that 
would otherwise occur in the vehicles 
subject to this rulemaking over their 
lifetime. 
NHTSA seeks comments on its 
analysis of the safety impacts of the 
proposed standards. To aid the agency 
in refining its analysis for the final rule, 
including its attempts to assess 
reasonable upper and lower ends of the 
potential range of estimated fatalities, 
NHTSA requests that each vehicle 
manufacturer provide, for inclusion in 
the record of this rulemaking, detailed 
information concerning the extent to 
which and manner in which it plans to 
reduce the weight of each of its models 
for the period covered by this 
rulemaking, and the cost of each method 
used. Manufacturers should include in 
those plans whether there will be any 
footprint or other size reduction, 
whether through reducing the size of an 
existing model, mix shifting or other 
means. Please also submit the analysis, 
including engineering or computer 
simulation analysis, performed to assess 
the possible safety impacts of such 
planned weight reduction. In addition, 
please submit the results of any vehicle 
crash or component tests that would aid 
in assessing those impacts.

8. What Other Impacts (Quantitative and 
Unquantifiable) Will These Proposed 
Standards Have? 
In addition to the quantified benefits 
and costs of fuel economy standards, the 
standards we are proposing will have 
other impacts that we have not 
quantified in monetary terms. The 
decision on whether or not to quantify 
a particular impact depends on several 
considerations: 
• Does the impact exist, and can the 
magnitude of the impact reasonably be 
attributed to the outcome of this 
rulemaking? 
• Would quantification help NHTSA 
and the public evaluate standards that 
may be set in rulemaking? 
• Is the impact readily quantifiable in 
monetary terms? Do we know how to 
quantify a particular impact? 
• If quantified, would the monetary 
impact likely be material? 
• Can a quantification be derived 
with a sufficiently narrow range of 
uncertainty so that the estimate is 
useful? 
NHTSA expects that this rulemaking 
will have a number of genuine, material 
impacts that have not been quantified 
due to one or more of the considerations 
listed above. In some cases, further 
research may yield estimates for future 
rulemakings. 
Technology Forcing 
The proposed rule will improve the 
fuel economy of the U.S. new vehicle 
fleet, but it will also increase the cost 
(and presumably, the price) of new 
passenger cars and light trucks built 
during MYs 2012–2016. We anticipate 
that the cost, scope, and duration of this 
rule, as well as the steadily rising 
standards it requires, will cause 
automakers and suppliers to devote 
increased attention to methods of 
improving vehicle fuel economy. 
This increased attention will 
stimulate additional research and 
engineering, and we anticipate that, 
over time, innovative approaches to 
reducing the fuel consumption of light 
duty vehicles will emerge. These 
innovative approaches may reduce the 
cost of the proposed rule in its later 
years, and also increase the set of 
feasible technologies in future years. 
We have attempted to estimate the 
effect of learning on known technologies 
within the period of the proposed 
rulemaking. We have not attempted to 
estimate the extent to which not-yet- 
invented technologies will appear, 
either within the time period of the 
current rulemaking or that might be 
available after MY 2016. 
Effects on Vehicle Maintenance, 
Operation, and Insurance Costs 
Any action that increases the cost of 
new vehicles will subsequently make 
such vehicles more costly to maintain, 
repair, and insure. In general, this effect 
can be expected to be a positive linear 
function of vehicle costs. The proposed 
rulemaking, however, raises vehicle 
costs by only a few percent at most, and 
hence the change in maintenance and 
operation costs, distributed over the 
expected life of regulated vehicles and 
discounted back to the present, is 
probably de minimus in terms of the full 
analysis. 
One of the common consequences of 
using more complex or innovative 
technologies is a decline in vehicle 
reliability and an increase in 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 23:31 Sep 25, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00279 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\28SEP2.SGM 28SEP2ms

maintenance costs, borne, in part, by the 
manufacturer (through warranty costs, 
which are included in the indirect costs 
of production) and, in part by the 
vehicle owner. NHTSA believes that 
this effect is difficult to quantify, but 
likely to be de minimus as well. 
Effects on Vehicle Miles Traveled 
(VMT) 
While NHTSA has estimated the 
impact of the rebound effect on VMT, 
we have not estimated how a change in 
vehicle sales could impact VMT. Since 
the value of the fuel savings to 
consumers outweighs the technology 
costs, new vehicle sales are predicted to 
increase. A change in vehicle sales will 
have complicated and a hard-to-quantify 
effect on vehicle miles traveled given 
the rebound effect, the trade-in of older 
vehicles, etc. In general, overall VMT 
should not be significantly affected. 
Effect on Composition of Passenger Car 
and Light Truck Sales 
In addition, manufacturers, to the 
extent that they pass on costs to 
customers, may distribute these costs 
across their motor vehicle fleets in ways 
that affect the composition of sales by 
model. To the extent that changes in the 
composition of sales occur, this could 
affect fuel savings to some degree. 
However, NHTSA’s view is that the 
scope for compositional effects is 
relatively small, since the total effect of 
the regulation itself will be to increase 
costs by only a few percent. 
Compositional effects might be 
important with respect to compliance 
costs for individual manufacturers, but 
are unlikely to be material for the rule 
as a whole. 
NHTSA is continuing to study 
methods of estimating compositional 
effects and may be able to develop 
methods for use in future rulemakings. 
Effects on the Used Vehicle Market 
The effect of this rule on the use and 
scrappage of older vehicles will be 
related to its effects on new vehicle 
prices, the fuel efficiency of new vehicle 
models, and the total sales of new 
vehicles. If the value of fuel savings 
resulting from improved fuel efficiency 
to the typical potential buyer of a new 
vehicle outweighs the average increase 
in new models’ prices, sales of new 
vehicles will rise, while scrappage rates 
of used vehicles will increase slightly. 
This will cause the ‘‘turnover’’ of the 
vehicle fleet—that is, the retirement of 
used vehicles and their replacement by 
new models—to accelerate slightly, thus 
accentuating the anticipated effect of the 
rule on fleet-wide fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions. However, if potential 
buyers value future fuel savings 
resulting from the increased fuel 
efficiency of new models at less than the 
increase in their average selling price, 
sales of new vehicles will decline, as 
will the rate at which used vehicles are 
retired from service. This effect will 
slow the replacement of used vehicles 
by new models, and thus partly offset 
the anticipated effects of the proposed 
rules on fuel use and emissions. 
Because the agencies are uncertain 
about how the value of projected fuel 
savings from the proposed rules to 
potential buyers will compare to their 
estimates of increases in new vehicle 
prices, we have not attempted to 
estimate explicitly the effects of the rule 
on scrappage of older vehicles and the 
turnover of the vehicle fleet. We seek 
comment on the methods that might be 
used to estimate the effect of the 
proposed rule on the scrappage and use 
of older vehicles as part of the analysis 
to be conducted for the final rule. 
Impacts of Changing Fuel Composition 
on Costs, Benefits, and Emissions 
EPAct, as amended by EISA, creates a 
Renewable Fuels Standard that sets 
targets for greatly increased usage of 
renewable fuels over the next decade. 
The law requires fixed volumes of 
renewable fuels to be used—volumes 
that are not linked to actual usage of 
transportation fuels. 
Ethanol and biodiesel (in the required 
volumes) may increase the cost of 
gasoline and diesel depending on crude 
oil prices and tax subsidies. The extra 
cost of renewable fuels will be borne 
through a cross-subsidy: The price of 
every gallon of gasoline will rise 
sufficiently to pay for the extra cost of 
renewable fuels. The proposed CAFE 
rule, by reducing total fuel 
consumption, would tend to increase 
any necessary cross-subsidy per gallon 
of fuel, and hence raise the market price 
of transportation fuels, while there 
would be no change in the volume or 
cost of renewable fuels used. 
Some of these effects are indirectly 
incorporated in NHTSA’s analysis of the 
proposed CAFE rule because they are 
directly incorporated in EIA’s 
projections of future gasoline and diesel 
prices in the Annual Energy Outlook, 
which incorporates in its baseline both 
a Renewable Fuel Standard and an 
increasing CAFE standard. 
The net effect of incorporating an RFS 
then might be to slightly reduce the 
benefits of the rule because affected 
vehicles might be driven slightly less, 
and because they emit slightly fewer 
greenhouse gas emissions per gallon. In 
addition there might be deadweight 
losses from the induced reduction in 
VMT. All of these effects are difficult to 
estimate, because of uncertainty in 
future crude oil prices, uncertainty in 
future tax policy, and uncertainty about 
how petroleum marketers will actually 
comply with the RFS, but they are likely 
to be small, because the cumulative 
deviation from baseline fuel 
consumption induced by the proposed 
rule will itself be small. 
Macroeconomic Impacts of This Rule 
The proposed rule will have a number 
of consequences that may have short- 
run and longer-run macroeconomic 
effects. It is important to recognize, 
however, that these effects do not 
represent benefits in addition to those 
resulting directly from reduced fuel 
consumption and emissions. Instead, 
they represent the economic effects that 
occur as these direct impacts filter 
through the interconnected markets 
comprising the U.S. economy. 
• Increasing the cost and quality (in 
the form of better fuel economy) of new 
light duty vehicles will have ripple 
effects through the rest of the economy. 
Depending on the assumptions made, 
the rule could generate very small 
increases or declines in output. 
• Reducing consumption of imported 
petroleum should induce an increase in 
long-run output. 
• Decreasing the world price of oil 
should induce an increase in long-run 
output. 
NHTSA has not studied the 
macroeconomic effects of the proposal, 
however a discussion of the economy- 
wide impacts of this rule conducted by 
EPA is included in Section III.H.5. 
Although economy-wide models do not 
capture all of the potential impacts of 
this rule (e.g., improvements in product 
quality), these models can provide 
valuable insights on how this proposal 
would impact the U.S. economy in ways 
that extend beyond the transportation 
sector. 
Military Expenditures 
This analysis contains quantified 
estimates for the social cost of 
petroleum imports based on monopsony 
effects and the risk of oil market 
disruption. We have not included 
estimates of the cost of military 
expenditures associated with petroleum 
imports. 
H. Vehicle Classification 
Vehicle classification, for purposes of 
the CAFE program, refers to whether 
NHTSA considers a vehicle to be a 
passenger automobile or a light truck, 
and thus subject to either the passenger 
automobile or the light truck standards. 
As NHTSA explained in the MY 2011

620 538 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir. 2008). 
rulemaking, EPCA categorizes some 
light 4-wheeled vehicles as passenger 
automobiles (cars) and the balance as 
non-passenger automobiles (light 
trucks). EPCA defines passenger 
automobiles as any automobile (other 
than an automobile capable of off- 
highway operation) which NHTSA 
decides by rule is manufactured 
primarily for use in the transportation of 
not more than 10 individuals. EPCA 
501(2), 89 Stat. 901. NHTSA created 
regulatory definitions for passenger 
automobiles and light trucks, found at 
49 CFR part 523, to guide the agency 
and manufacturers in classifying 
vehicles. 
Under EPCA, there are two general 
groups of automobiles that qualify as 
non-passenger automobiles or light 
trucks: (1) Those defined by NHTSA in 
its regulations as other than passenger 
automobiles due to their having design 
features that indicate they were not 
manufactured ‘‘primarily’’ for 
transporting up to ten individuals; and 
(2) those expressly excluded from the 
passenger category by statute due to 
their capability for off-highway 
operation, regardless of whether they 
might have been manufactured 
primarily for passenger transportation. 
NHTSA’s classification rule directly 
tracks those two broad groups of non- 
passenger automobiles in subsections (a) 
and (b), respectively, of 49 CFR 523.5. 
For the purpose of this NPRM for the 
MYs 2012–2016 standards, EPA agreed 
to use NHTSA’s regulatory definitions 
for determining which vehicles would 
be subject to which CO2 standards. 
In the MY 2011 rulemaking, NHTSA 
took a fresh look at the regulatory 
definitions in light of several factors and 
developments: its desire to ensure 
clarity in how vehicles are classified, 
the passage of EISA, and the Ninth 
Circuit’s decision in CBD v. NHTSA.620 
NHTSA explained the origin of the 
current definitions of passenger 
automobiles and light trucks by tracing 
them back through the history of the 
CAFE program, and did not propose to 
change the definitions themselves at 
that time, because the agency concluded 
that the definitions were largely 
consistent with Congress’ intent in 
separating passenger automobiles and 
light trucks, but also in part because the 
agency tentatively concluded that doing 
so would not lead to increased fuel 
savings. However, the agency tightened 
the definitions in § 523.5 to ensure that 
only vehicles that actually have 4WD 
will be classified as off-highway 
vehicles by reason of having 4WD (to 
prevent 2WD SUVs that also come in a 
4WD ‘‘version’’ from qualifying 
automatically as ‘‘off-road capable’’ 
simply by reason of the existence of the 
4WD version). It also took this action to 
ensure that manufacturers may only use 
the ‘‘greater cargo-carrying capacity’’ 
criterion of 523.5(a)(4) for cargo van- 
type vehicles, rather than for SUVs with 
removable second-row seats unless they 
truly have greater cargo-carrying than 
passenger-carrying capacity ‘‘as sold’’ to 
the first retail purchaser. NHTSA 
concluded that these changes increased 
clarity, were consistent with EPCA and 
EISA, and responded to the Ninth 
Circuit’s decision with regard to vehicle 
classification. 
However, manufacturers currently 
have an incentive to classify vehicles as 
light trucks because, generally speaking, 
the fuel economy target for light trucks 
with a given footprint is less stringent 
than the target for passenger cars with 
the same footprint. This is due to the 
fact that the curves are based on actual 
fuel economy capabilities of the 
vehicles to which they apply. Because 
of characteristics like 4WD, towing and 
hauling capacity, and heavy weight, the 
vehicles in the current light truck fleet 
are generally less capable of achieving 
higher fuel economy levels as compared 
to the vehicles in the passenger car fleet. 
2WD SUVs are the vehicles that could 
be most readily redesigned so that they 
can be ‘‘moved’’ from the passenger car 
to the light truck fleet. A manufacturer 
could do this by adding a third row of 
seats, for example, or boosting GVWR 
over 6,000 lbs for a 2WD SUV that 
already meets the ground clearance 
requirements for ‘‘off-road capability.’’ 
A change like this may only be possible 
during a vehicle redesign, but since 
vehicles are redesigned, on average, 
every 5 years, at least some 
manufacturers may make such changes 
before or during the model years 
covered by this rulemaking. 
In looking forward to model years 
beyond 2011 and considering how 
CAFE should operate in the context of 
the National Program and previously- 
received comments as requested by 
President Obama, NHTSA seeks 
comment on the following potential 
changes to NHTSA’s vehicle 
classification system. We request 
comment also on whether, if any of the 
changes were to be adopted, they should 
be applied to any of the model years 
covered by this rulemaking or whether, 
due to lead time concerns, they should 
apply only to MY 2017 and thereafter. 
Reclassifying Minivans and other ‘‘3- 
row’’ light trucks as passenger cars (i.e., 
removing 49 CFR 523.5(a)(5)): 
NHTSA has received repeated 
comments over the course of the last 
several rulemakings from environmental 
and consumer groups regarding the 
classification of minivans as light trucks 
instead of as passenger cars. 
Commenters have argued that because 
minivans generally have three rows of 
seats, are built on unibody chassis, and 
are used primarily for transporting 
passengers, they should be classified as 
passenger cars. NHTSA did not accept 
these arguments in the MY 2011 final 
rule, due to concerns that moving 
minivans to the passenger car fleet 
would lower the fuel economy targets 
for those passenger cars having 
essentially the same footprint as the 
minivans, and thus lower the overall 
fuel average fuel economy level that the 
manufacturers would need to meet. 
However, due to the new methodology 
for setting standards, the as-yet- 
unknown fuel-economy capabilities of 
future minivans and 3-row 2WD SUVs, 
and the unknown state of the vehicle 
market (particularly for MYs 2017 and 
beyond), NHTSA can no longer say with 
certainty that moving these vehicles 
could negatively affect potential 
stringency levels for either passenger 
cars or light trucks. 
Although such a change would not be 
made applicable during the MY 2012– 
2016 time frame, we seek comment on 
why NHTSA should or should not 
consider, as part of this rulemaking, 
reclassifying minivans (and other 
current light trucks that qualify as such 
because they have three rows of 
designated seating positions as standard 
equipment) for MYs 2017 and after. 
Classifying ‘‘like’’ vehicles together: 
Many commenters objected in the 
rulemaking for the MY 2011 standards 
to NHTSA’s regulatory separation of 
‘‘like’’ vehicles. Industry commenters 
argued that it was technologically 
inappropriate for NHTSA to place 4WD 
and 2WD versions of the same SUV in 
separate classes. They argued that the 
vehicles are the same, except for their 
drivetrain features, thus giving them 
similar fuel economy improvement 
potential. They further argued that all 
SUVs should be classified as light 
trucks. Environmental and consumer 
group commenters, on the other hand, 
argued that 4WD SUVs and 2WD SUVs 
that are ‘‘off-highway capable’’ by virtue 
of a GVWR above 6,000 pounds should 
be classified as passenger cars, since 
they are primarily used to transport 
passengers. In the MY 2011 rulemaking, 
NHTSA rejected both of these sets of 
arguments. NHTSA concluded that 2WD 
SUVs that were neither ‘‘off-highway 
capable’’ nor possessed ‘‘truck-like’’ 
functional characteristics were 
appropriately classified as passenger 
cars. At the same time, NHTSA also

621 49 CFR Part 537 is authorized by 49 U.S.C. 
32907. 622 49 U.S.C. 32904(c). 
concluded that because Congress 
explicitly designated vehicles with 
GVWRs over 6,000 pounds as ‘‘off- 
highway capable’’ (if they meet the 
ground clearance requirements 
established by the agency), NHTSA did 
not have authority to move these 
vehicles to the passenger car fleet. 
With regard to the first argument, that 
‘‘like’’ vehicles should be classified 
similarly (i.e., that 2WD SUVs should be 
classified as light trucks because, 
besides their drivetrain, they are ‘‘like’’ 
the 4WD version that qualifies as a light 
truck), NHTSA continues to believe that 
2WD SUVs that do not meet any part of 
the existing regulatory definition for 
light trucks should be classified as 
passenger cars. However, NHTSA 
recognizes the additional point raised 
by industry commenters in the MY 2011 
rulemaking that manufacturers may 
respond to this tighter classification by 
ceasing to build 2WD versions of SUVs, 
which could reduce fuel savings. In 
response to that point, NHTSA stated in 
the MY 2011 final rule that it expects 
that manufacturer decisions about 
whether to continue building 2WD 
SUVs will be driven in much greater 
measure by consumer demand than by 
NHTSA’s regulatory definitions. If it 
appears, in the course of the next 
several model years, that manufacturers 
are indeed responding to the CAFE 
regulatory definitions in a way that 
reduces overall fuel savings from 
expected levels, it may be appropriate 
for NHTSA to review this question 
again. NHTSA seeks comment on how 
the agency might go about reviewing 
this question as more information about 
manufacturer behavior is accumulated. 
With regard to the second argument, 
that NHTSA should move vehicles that 
qualify as ‘‘off-highway capable’’ from 
the light truck to the passenger car fleet 
because they are primarily used to 
transport passengers, NHTSA reiterates 
that EPCA is clear that certain vehicles 
are non-passenger automobiles (i.e., 
light trucks) because of their off- 
highway capabilities, regardless of how 
they may be used day-to-day. 
However, NHTSA could explore 
additional approaches, although not all 
could be pursued on current law. 
Possible alternative legal regimes might 
include: (a) classifying vehicles as 
passenger cars or light trucks based on 
use alone (rather than characteristics); 
(b) removing the regulatory distinction 
altogether and setting standards for the 
entire fleet of vehicles instead of for 
separate passenger car and light truck 
fleets; or (c) dividing the fleet into 
multiple categories more consistent 
with current vehicle fleets (i.e., sedans, 
minivans, SUVs, pickup trucks, etc.). 
NHTSA seeks comment on whether and 
why it should pursue any of these 
courses of action. 
I. Compliance and Enforcement 
1. Overview 
NHTSA’s CAFE enforcement program 
and the compliance flexibilities 
available to manufacturers are largely 
established by statute—unlike the CAA, 
EPCA and EISA are very prescriptive 
and leave the agency limited authority 
to increase the flexibilities available to 
manufacturers. This was intentional, 
however. Congress balanced the energy 
saving purposes of the statute against 
the benefits of the various flexibilities 
and incentives it provided and placed 
precise limits on those flexibilities and 
incentives. For example, while the 
Department sought authority for 
unlimited transfer of credits between a 
manufacturer’s car and light truck fleets, 
Congress limited the extent to which a 
manufacturer could raise its average fuel 
economy for one of its classes of 
vehicles through credit transfer in lieu 
of adding more fuel saving technologies. 
It did not want these provisions to slow 
progress toward achieving greater 
energy conservation or other policy 
goals. In keeping with EPCA’s focus on 
energy conservation, NHTSA has done 
its best, for example, in crafting the 
credit transfer and trading regulations 
authorized by EISA, to ensure that total 
fuel savings are preserved when 
manufacturers exercise their compliance 
flexibilities. 
The following sections explain how 
NHTSA determines whether 
manufacturers are in compliance with 
the CAFE standards for each model 
year, and how manufacturers may 
address potential non-compliance 
situations through the use of 
compliance flexibilities or fine payment. 
2. How Does NHTSA Determine 
Compliance? 
a. Manufacturer Submission of Data and 
CAFE Testing by EPA 
NHTSA begins to determine CAFE 
compliance by considering pre- and 
mid-model year reports submitted by 
manufacturers pursuant to 49 CFR part 
537, Automotive Fuel Economy 
Reports.621 The reports for the current 
model year are submitted to NHTSA 
every December and July. As of the time 
of this NPRM, NHTSA has received 
mid-model year reports from 
manufacturers for MY 2009, and 
anticipates receiving pre-model year 
reports for MY 2010 at the end of this 
year. Although the reports are used for 
NHTSA’s reference only, they help the 
agency, and the manufacturers who 
prepare them, anticipate potential 
compliance issues as early as possible, 
and help manufacturers plan 
compliance strategies. Currently, 
NHTSA receives these reports in paper 
form. In order to facilitate submission 
by manufacturers and consistent with 
the President’s electronic government 
initiatives, NHTSA proposes to amend 
Part 537 to allow for electronic 
submission of the pre- and mid-model 
year CAFE reports. 
NHTSA makes its ultimate 
determination of manufacturers’ CAFE 
compliance upon receiving EPA’s 
official certified and reported CAFE 
data. The EPA certified data is based on 
vehicle testing and on final model year 
data submitted by manufacturers to EPA 
pursuant to 40 CFR 600.512, Model Year 
Report, no later than 90 days after the 
end of the calendar year. Pursuant to 49 
U.S.C. 32904(e), EPA is responsible for 
calculating automobile manufacturers’ 
CAFE values so that NHTSA can 
determine compliance with the CAFE 
standards. In measuring the fuel 
economy of passenger cars, EPA is 
required by EPCA 622 to use the EPA test 
procedures in place as of 1975 (or 
procedures that give comparable 
results), which are the city and highway 
tests of today, with adjustments for 
procedural changes that have occurred 
since 1975. EPA uses similar procedures 
for light trucks, although, as noted 
above, EPCA does not require it to do 
so. One notable shortcoming of the 1975 
test procedure is that it does not include 
a provision for air conditioner usage 
during the test cycle. As discussed in 
Section III above of the preamble, air 
conditioner usage increases the load on 
a vehicle’s engine, reducing fuel 
efficiency and increasing CO2 
emissions. Since the air conditioner is 
not turned on during testing, equipping 
a vehicle model with a relatively 
inefficient air conditioner will not 
adversely affect that model’s measured 
fuel economy, while quipping a vehicle 
model with a relatively efficient air 
conditioner will not raise that model’s 
measured fuel economy. The fuel 
economy test procedures for light trucks 
could be amended through rulemaking 
to provide for air conditioner operation 
during testing and to take other steps for 
improving the accuracy and 
representativeness of fuel economy 
measurements. Comment is sought in 
section I.D.2 regarding implementing 
such amendments beginning in MY 
2017 and also on the more immediate

interim step of providing credits under 
49 U.S.C. 32904(c) for light trucks 
equipped with relatively efficient air 
conditioners for MYs 2012–2016. 
Modernizing the passenger car test 
procedures as well would not be 
possible under EPCA as currently 
written. 
b. NHTSA Then Analyzes EPA– 
Certified CAFE Values for Compliance 
Determining CAFE compliance is 
fairly straightforward. After testing, EPA 
verifies the data submitted by 
manufacturers and issues final CAFE 
reports to manufacturers and to NHTSA 
between April and October of each year 
(for the previous model year). NHTSA 
then identifies the manufacturers’ 
compliance categories (fleets) that do 
not meet the applicable CAFE fleet 
standards. 
To determine if manufacturers have 
earned credits that would offset those 
shortfalls, NHTSA calculates a 
cumulative credit status for each of a 
manufacturer’s vehicle compliance 
categories according to 49 U.S.C. 32903. 
If a manufacturer’s compliance category 
exceeds the applicable fuel economy 
standard, NHTSA adds credits to the 
account for that compliance category. If 
a manufacturer’s vehicles in a particular 
compliance category fall below the 
standard fuel economy value, NHTSA 
will provide written notification to the 
manufacturer that it has not met a 
particular fleet standard. The 
manufacturer will be required to 
confirm the shortfall and must either: 
Submit a plan indicating it will allocate 
existing credits, and/or for MY 2011 and 
later, how it will earn, transfer and/or 
acquire credits; or pay the appropriate 
civil penalty. The manufacturer must 
submit a plan or payment within 60 
days of receiving agency notification. 
The amount of credits are determined 
by multiplying the number of tenths of 
a mpg by which a manufacturer 
exceeds, or falls short of, a standard for 
a particular category of automobiles by 
the total volume of automobiles of that 
category manufactured by the 
manufacturer for a given model year. 
Credits used to offset shortfalls are 
subject to the three and five year 
limitations as described in 49 U.S.C. 
32903(a). Transferred credits are subject 
to the limitations specified by 49 U.S.C. 
32903(g)(3). The value of each credit, 
when used for compliance, received via 
trade or transfer is adjusted, using the 
adjustment factor described in 49 CFR 
part 536.4, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 
32903(f)(1). Credit allocation plans 
received from the manufacturer will be 
reviewed and approved by NHTSA. 
NHTSA will approve a credit allocation 
plan unless it finds the proposed credits 
are unavailable or that it is unlikely that 
the plan will result in the manufacturer 
earning sufficient credits to offset the 
subject credit shortfall. If a plan is 
approved, NHTSA will revise the 
respective manufacturer’s credit account 
accordingly. If a plan is rejected, 
NHTSA will notify the respective 
manufacturer and request a revised plan 
or payment of the appropriate fine. 
In the event that a manufacturer does 
not comply with a CAFE standard, even 
after the consideration of credits, EPCA 
provides for the assessing of civil 
penalties. The Act specifies a precise 
formula for determining the amount of 
civil penalties for such a 
noncompliance. The penalty, as 
adjusted for inflation by law, is $5.50 for 
each tenth of a mpg that a 
manufacturer’s average fuel economy 
falls short of the standard for a given 
model year multiplied by the total 
volume of those vehicles in the affected 
fleet (i.e., import or domestic passenger 
car, or light truck), manufactured for 
that model year. The amount of the 
penalty may not be reduced except 
under the unusual or extreme 
circumstances specified in the statute. 
All penalties are paid to the U.S. 
Treasury and not to NHTSA itself. 
Unlike the National Traffic and Motor 
Vehicle Safety Act, EPCA does not 
provide for recall and remedy in the 
event of a noncompliance. The presence 
of recall and remedy provisions 623 in 
the Safety Act and their absence in 
EPCA is believed to arise from the 
difference in the application of the 
safety standards and CAFE standards. A 
safety standard applies to individual 
vehicles; that is, each vehicle must 
possess the requisite equipment or 
feature which must provide the 
requisite type and level of performance. 
If a vehicle does not, it is noncompliant. 
Typically, a vehicle does not entirely 
lack an item or equipment or feature. 
Instead, the equipment or features fails 
to perform adequately. Recalling the 
vehicle to repair or replace the 
noncompliant equipment or feature can 
usually be readily accomplished. 
In contrast, a CAFE standard applies 
to a manufacturer’s entire fleet for a 
model year. It does not require that a 
particular individual vehicle be 
equipped with any particular equipment 
or feature or meet a particular level of 
fuel economy. It does require that the 
manufacturer’s fleet, as a whole, 
comply. Further, although under the 
attribute-based approach to setting 
CAFE standards fuel economy targets 
are established for individual vehicles 
based on their footprints, the vehicles 
are not required to comply with those 
targets on a model-by-model or vehicle- 
by-vehicle basis. However, as a practical 
matter, if a manufacturer chooses to 
design some vehicles so they fall below 
their target levels of fuel economy, it 
will need to design other vehicles so 
they exceed their targets if the 
manufacturer’s overall fleet average is to 
meet the applicable standard. 
Thus, under EPCA, there is no such 
thing as a noncompliant vehicle, only a 
noncompliant fleet. No particular 
vehicle in a noncompliant fleet is any 
more, or less, noncompliant than any 
other vehicle in the fleet. 
After enforcement letters are sent, 
NHTSA continues to monitor receipt of 
credit allocation plans or civil penalty 
payments that are due within 60 days 
from the date of receipt of the letter by 
the vehicle manufacturer, and takes 
further action if the manufacturer is 
delinquent in responding. 
3. What Compliance Flexibilities Are 
Available Under the CAFE Program and 
How Do Manufacturers Use Them? 
There are three basic flexibilities 
permitted by EPCA/EISA that 
manufacturers can use to achieve 
compliance with CAFE standards 
beyond applying fuel economy- 
improving technologies: (1) Building 
dual- and alternative-fueled vehicles; (2) 
banking, trading, and transferring 
credits earned for exceeding fuel 
economy standards; and (3) paying 
fines. We note again that while these 
flexibility mechanisms will reduce 
compliance costs to some degree for 
most manufacturers, 49 U.S.C. 32902(h) 
expressly prohibits NHTSA from 
considering the availability of credits 
(either for building dual- or alternative- 
fueled vehicles or from accumulated 
transfers or trades) in determining the 
level of the standards. Thus, NHTSA 
may not raise CAFE standards because 
manufacturers have enough credits to 
meet higher standards. This is an 
important difference from EPA’s 
authority under the CAA, which does 
not contain such a restriction, and 
which allows EPA to set higher 
standards as a result. 
a. Dual- and Alternative-Fueled 
Vehicles 
As discussed at length in prior 
rulemakings, EPCA encourages 
manufacturers to build alternative- 
fueled and dual- (or flexible-) fueled 
vehicles by providing special fuel 
economy calculations for ‘‘dedicated’’ 
(that is, 100 percent) alternative fueled 
vehicles and ‘‘dual-fueled’’ (that is,

624 49 U.S.C. 32905(a). 
625 49 U.S.C. 32905(b) 
626 49 U.S.C. 32905(c). 
627 49 U.S.C. 32906(a). NHTSA notes that the 
incentive for dedicated alternative-fuel 
automobiles, automobiles that run exclusively on 
an alternative fuel, at 49 U.S.C. 32905(a), was not 
phased-out by EISA. 
628 Congress required that DOT establish a credit 
‘‘transferring’’ regulation, to allow individual 
manufacturers to move credits from one of their 
fleets to another (e.g., using a credit earned for 
exceeding the light truck standard for compliance 
with the domestic passenger car standard). Congress 
allowed DOT to establish a credit ‘‘trading’’ 
regulation, so that credits may be bought and sold 
between manufacturers and other parties. 
629 In contrast, manufacturers stated in comments 
in NHTSA’s MY 2011 rulemaking that they did not 
anticipate a robust market for credit trading, due to 
competitive concerns. NHTSA does not yet know 
whether those concerns will continue to deter 
manufacturers from exercising the trading 
flexibility during MYs 2012–2016. 
capable of running on either the 
alternative fuel or gasoline) vehicles. 
The fuel economy of a dedicated 
alternative fuel vehicle is determined by 
dividing its fuel economy in equivalent 
miles per gallon of gasoline or diesel 
fuel by 0.15.624 Thus, a 15 mpg 
dedicated alternative fuel vehicle would 
be rated as 100 mpg. For dual-fueled 
vehicles, the rating is the average of the 
fuel economy on gasoline or diesel and 
the fuel economy on the alternative fuel 
vehicle divided by 0.15.625 
For example, this calculation 
procedure turns a dual-fueled vehicle 
that averages 25 mpg on gasoline or 
diesel into a 40 mpg vehicle for CAFE 
purposes. This assumes that (1) the 
vehicle operates on gasoline or diesel 50 
percent of the time and on alternative 
fuel 50 percent of the time; (2) fuel 
economy while operating on alternative 
fuel is 15 mpg (15/.15 = 100 mpg); and 
(3) fuel economy while operating on gas 
or diesel is 25 mpg. Thus: 
CAFE FE = 1/{0.5/(mpg gas) + 0.5/(mpg 
alt fuel)} = 1/{0.5/25 + 0.5/100) = 
40 mpg 
In the case of natural gas, the 
calculation is performed in a similar 
manner. The fuel economy is the 
weighted average while operating on 
natural gas and operating on gas or 
diesel. The statute specifies that 100 
cubic feet (ft3) of natural gas is 
equivalent to 0.823 gallons of gasoline. 
The gallon equivalency of natural gas is 
equal to 0.15 (as for other alternative 
fuels).626 Thus, if a vehicle averages 25 
miles per 100 ft3 of natural gas, then: 
CAFE FE = (25/100) * (100/.823)* (1/ 
0.15) = 203 mpg 
Congress extended the incentive in 
EISA for dual-fueled automobiles 
through MY 2019, but provided for its 
phase out between MYs 2015 and 
2019.627 The maximum fuel economy 
increase which may be attributed to the 
incentive is thus as follows: 
Model year mpg increase 
MYs 1993–2014 ..................... 1 .2 
MY 2015 ................................. 1 .0 
MY 2016 ................................. 0 .8 
MY 2017 ................................. 0 .6 
MY 2018 ................................. 0 .4 
MY 2019 ................................. 0 .2 
After MY 2019 ........................ 0 
49 CFR part 538 implements the 
statutory alternative-fueled and dual- 
fueled automobile manufacturing 
incentive. NHTSA is proposing to 
update Part 538 as part of this NPRM to 
reflect the EISA changes, but to the 
extent that 49 U.S.C. 32906(a) differs 
from the current version of 49 CFR 
538.9, the statute supersedes the 
regulation, and regulated parties may 
rely on the text of the statute. 
A major difference between EPA’s 
statutory authority and NHTSA’s 
statutory authority is that the CAA 
contains no specific prescriptions with 
regard to credits for dual- and 
alternative-fueled vehicles comparable 
to those found in EPCA/EISA. As an 
exercise of that authority, and as 
discussed in Section III above, EPA is 
offering similar credits for dual- and 
alternative-fueled vehicles through MY 
2015 for compliance with its CO2 
standards, but for MY 2016 and beyond 
EPA will establish CO2 emission levels 
for alternative fuel vehicles based on 
measurement of actual CO2 emissions 
during testing, plus a manufacturer 
demonstration that the vehicles are 
actually being run on the alternative 
fuel. NHTSA has no such authority 
under EPCA/EISA to require that 
vehicles manufactured for the purpose 
of obtaining the credit actually be run 
on the alternative fuel, but requests 
comment on whether it should seek 
legislative changes to revise its authority 
to address this issue. 
b. Credit Trading and Transfer 
In the MY 2011 final rule, NHTSA 
established Part 536 for credit trading 
and transfer. Part 536 implements the 
provisions in EISA authorizing NHTSA 
to establish by regulation a credit 
trading program and directing it to 
establish by regulation a credit transfer 
program.628 Since its enactment, EPCA 
has permitted manufacturers to earn 
credits for exceeding the standards and 
to carry those credits backward or 
forward. EISA extended the ‘‘carry- 
forward’’ period from three to five 
model years, and left the ‘‘carry-back’’ 
period at three model years. Under Part 
536, credit holders (including, but not 
limited to, manufacturers) will have 
credit accounts with NHTSA, and will 
be able to hold credits, use them to 
achieve compliance with CAFE 
standards, transfer them between 
compliance categories, or trade them. A 
credit may also be cancelled before its 
expiry date, if the credit holder so 
chooses. Traded and transferred credits 
are subject to an ‘‘adjustment factor’’ to 
ensure total oil savings are preserved, as 
required by EISA. EISA also prohibits 
credits earned before MY 2011 from 
being transferred, so NHTSA has 
developed several regulatory restrictions 
on trading and transferring to facilitate 
Congress’ intent in this regard. EISA 
also establishes a ‘‘cap’’ for the 
maximum increase in any compliance 
category attributable to transferred 
credits: for MYs 2011–2013, transferred 
credits can only be used to increase a 
manufacturer’s CAFE level in a given 
compliance category by 1.0 mpg; for 
MYs 2014–2017, by 1.5 mpg; and for 
MYs 2018 and beyond, by 2.0 mpg. 
NHTSA recognizes that some 
manufacturers may have to rely on 
credit transferring for compliance in 
MYs 2012–2017.629 As a way to improve 
the transferring flexibility mechanism 
for manufacturers, NHTSA interprets 
EISA not to prohibit the banking of 
transferred credits for use in later model 
years. Thus, NHTSA believes that the 
language of EISA may be read to allow 
manufacturers to transfer credits from 
one fleet that has an excess number of 
credits, within the limits specified, to 
another fleet that may also have excess 
credits instead of transferring only to a 
fleet that has a credit shortfall. This 
would mean that a manufacturer could 
transfer a certain number of credits each 
year and bank them, and then the 
credits could be carried forward or back 
‘‘without limit’’ later if and when a 
shortfall ever occurred in that same 
fleet. NHTSA bases this interpretation 
on 49 U.S.C. 32903(g)(2), which states 
that transferred credits ‘‘are available to 
be used in the same model years that the 
manufacturer could have applied such 
credits under subsections (a), (b), (d), 
and (e), as well as for the model year in 
which the manufacturer earned such 
credits.’’ The EISA limitation applies 
only to the application of such credits 
for compliance in particular model 
years, and not their transfer per se. If 
transferred credits have the same 
lifespan and may be used in carry-back 
and carry-forward plans, it seems 
reasonable that they should be allowed 
to be stored in any fleet, rather than 
only in the fleet in which they were

earned. Of course, manufacturers could 
not transfer and bank credits for 
purposes of achieving the minimum 
standard for domestically-manufactured 
passenger cars, as prohibited by 49 
U.S.C. 32903(g)(4). Transferred and 
banked credits would additionally still 
be subject to the adjustment factor when 
actually used, which would help to 
ensure that total oil savings are 
preserved while still offering greater 
flexibility to manufacturers. This 
interpretation of EISA also helps 
NHTSA, to some extent, to harmonize 
better with EPA’s CO2 program, which 
allows unlimited banking and transfer 
of credits. NHTSA seeks comment on 
this interpretation of EISA.

passenger car, light truck) falls below 
the applicable standard, and the 
manufacturer cannot make up the 
difference by using credits earned or 
acquired, the manufacturer is subject to 
penalties. The penalty, as mentioned, is 
$5.50 for each tenth of a mpg that a 
manufacturer’s average fuel economy 
falls short of the standard for a given 
model year, multiplied by the total 
volume of those vehicles in the affected 
fleet, manufactured for that model year. 
NHTSA has collected $772,850,459.00 
to date in CAFE penalties, the largest 
ever being paid by DaimlerChrysler for 
its MY 2006 import passenger car fleet, 
$30,257,920.00. For their MY 2007 
fleets, five manufacturers paid CAFE 
fines for not meeting an applicable 
standard—Ferrari, Maserati, Mercedes- 
Benz, Porsche, and Volkswagen—for a 
total of $37,385,941.00 
NHTSA recognizes that some 
manufacturers may use the option to 
pay fines as a CAFE compliance 
flexibility—presumably, when paying 
fines is deemed more cost-effective than 
applying additional fuel economy- 
improving technology, or when adding 
fuel economy-improving technology 
would fundamentally change the 
characteristics of the vehicle in ways 
that the manufacturer believes its target 
consumers would not accept. NHTSA 
has no authority under EPCA/EISA to 
prevent manufacturers from turning to 
fine-payment if they choose to do so. 
This is another important difference 
from EPA’s authority under the CAA, 
which allows EPA to revoke a 
manufacturer’s certificate of compliance 
that permits it to sell vehicles if EPA 
determines that the manufacturer is in 
non-compliance, and does not permit 
manufacturers to pay fines in lieu of 
compliance with applicable standards. 
NHTSA has grappled repeatedly with 
the issue of whether fines are 
motivational for manufacturers, and 
whether raising fines would increase 
manufacturers’ compliance with the 
standards. EPCA authorizes increasing 
the civil penalty very slightly up to 
$10.00, exclusive of inflationary 
adjustments, if NHTSA decides that the 
increase in the penalty ‘‘will result in, 
or substantially further, substantial 
energy conservation for automobiles in 
the model years in which the increased 
penalty may be imposed; and will not 
have a substantial deleterious impact on 
the economy of the United States, a 
State, or a region of a State.’’ 49 U.S.C. 
32912(c). 
To support a decision that increasing 
the penalty would result in ‘‘substantial 
energy conservation’’ without having ‘‘a 
substantial deleterious impact on the 
economy,’’ NHTSA would likely need to 
provide some reasonably certain 
quantitative estimates of the fuel that 
would be saved, and the impact on the 
economy, if the penalty were raised. 
Comments received on this issue in the 
past have not explained in clear 
quantitative terms what the benefits and 
drawbacks to raising the penalty might 
be. Additionally, it may be that the 
range of possible increase that the 
statute provides, i.e., up to $10 per tenth 
of a mpg, is insufficient to result in 
substantial energy conservation, 
although changing this would require an 
amendment to the statute by Congress. 
While NHTSA continues to seek to gain 
information on this issue to inform a 
future rulemaking decision, we request 
that commenters wishing to address this 
issue please provide, as specifically as 
possible, estimates of how raising or not 
raising the penalty amount will or will 
not substantially raise energy 
conservation and impact the economy. 
4. Other CAFE Enforcement Issues— 
Variations in Footprint 
NHTSA has a standardized test 
procedure for determining vehicle 
footprint,630 which is defined by 
regulation as follows: 
Footprint is defined as the product of 
track width (measured in inches, 
calculated as the average of front and 
rear track widths, and rounded to the 
nearest tenth of an inch) times 
wheelbase (measured in inches and 
rounded to the nearest tenth of an inch), 
divided by 144 and then rounded to the 
nearest tenth of a square foot.631 
‘‘Track width,’’ in turn, is defined as 
‘‘the lateral distance between the 
centerlines of the base tires at ground, 
including the camber angle.’’ 632 
‘‘Wheelbase’’ is defined as ‘‘the 
longitudinal distance between front and 
rear wheel centerlines.’’ 633 
NHTSA began requiring 
manufacturers to submit this 
information as part of their pre-model 
year reports in MY 2008 for light trucks, 
and will require manufacturers to 
submit this information for passenger 
cars as well beginning in MY 2011. 
Manufacturers have submitted the 
required information for their light 
trucks, but NHTSA has identified 
several issues with regard to footprint 
measurement, that could affect how 
required fuel economy levels are 
calculated for a manufacturer. The 
paragraphs that follow explain NHTSA’s 
views regarding these issues, and solicit 
public input on what NHTSA should do 
to address them in the future. 
a. Variations in Track Width 
By definition, wheelbase 
measurement should be very consistent 
from one vehicle to another of the same 
model. Track width, in contrast, may 
vary in two respects: Wheel offset,634 
and camber. Most current vehicles have 
wheels with positive offset, with 
technical specifications for offset 
typically expressed in millimeters. 
Additionally, for most vehicles, the 
camber angle of each of a vehicle’s 
wheels is specified as a range, i.e., front 
axle, left and right within minus 0.9 to 
plus 0.3 degree and rear axle, left and 
right within minus 0.9 to plus 0.1 
degree. Given the small variations in 
offset and camber angle dimensions, the 
potential effects of components (wheels) 
and vehicle specifications (camber) 
within existing designs on vehicle 
footprints are considered insignificant. 
However, NHTSA recognizes that 
manufacturers may change the 
specifications of and the equipment on 
vehicles, even those that are not 
redesigned or refreshed, during a model 
year and from year to year. There may 
be opportunity for manufacturers to 
change specifications for wheel offset 
and camber to increase a vehicle’s track

width and footprint, and thus decrease 
their required fuel economy level. 
NHTSA believes that this is likely 
easiest on vehicles that already have 
sufficient space to accommodate 
changes without accompanying changes 
to the body profile and/or suspension 
component locations. 
There may be drawbacks to such a 
decision, however. Changing from 
positive offset wheels to wheels with 
zero or negative offset will move tires 
and wheels outward toward the fenders. 
Increasing the negative upper limit of 
camber will tilt the top of the tire and 
wheel inward and move the bottom 
outward, placing the upper portion of 
the rotating tires and wheels in closer 
proximity to suspension components. In 
addition, higher negative camber can 
adversely affect tire life and the on-road 
fuel economy of the vehicle. 
Furthermore, it is likely that most 
vehicle designs have already used the 
available space in wheel areas since, by 
doing so, the vehicle’s handling 
performance is improved. Therefore, it 
seems unlikely that manufacturers will 
make significant changes to wheel offset 
and camber. 
b. How Manufacturers Designate ‘‘Base 
Tires’’ and Wheels 
According to the definition of ‘‘track 
width’’ in 49 CFR 523.2, manufacturers 
must determine track width when the 
vehicle is equipped with ‘‘base tires.’’ 
Section 523.2 defines ‘‘base tire,’’ in 
turn, as ‘‘the tire specified as standard 
equipment by a manufacturer on each 
configuration of a model type.’’ NHTSA 
did not define ‘‘standard equipment.’’ 
In their pre-model year reports 
required by 49 CFR part 537, 
manufacturers have the option of either 
(A) reporting a base tire for each model 
type, or (B) reporting a base tire for each 
vehicle configuration within a model 
type, which represents an additional 
level of specificity. If different vehicle 
configurations have different footprint 
values, then reporting the number of 
vehicles for each footprint will improve 
the accuracy of the required fuel 
economy level for the fleet, since the 
pre-model year report data is part of 
what manufacturers use to determine 
their CAFE obligations. 
For example, assume a manufacturer’s 
pre-model year report listed five vehicle 
configurations that comprise one model 
type. If the manufacturer provides only 
one vehicle configuration’s front and 
rear track widths, wheelbase, footprint 
and base tire size to represent the model 
type, and the other vehicle 
configurations all have a different tire 
size specified as standard equipment, 
the footprint value represented by the 
manufacturer may not capture the full 
spectrum of footprint values for that 
model type. Similarly, the base tires of 
a model type may be mounted on two 
or more wheels with different offset 
dimensions for different vehicle 
configurations. Of course, if the 
footprint value for all vehicle 
configurations is essentially the same, 
there would be no need to report by 
vehicle configuration. However, if 
footprints are different—larger or 
smaller—reporting for each group with 
similar footprints or for each vehicle 
configuration would produce a more 
accurate result. 
c. Vehicle ‘‘Design’’ Values Reported by 
Manufacturers 
NHTSA understands that the track 
widths and wheelbase values and the 
calculated footprint calculated values, 
as provided in pre-model year reports, 
are based on vehicle designs. This can 
lead to inaccurate calculations of 
required fuel economy level. For 
example, if the values reported by 
manufacturers are within an expected 
range of values, but are skewed to the 
higher end of the ranges, the required 
fuel economy level for the fleet will be 
artificially lower, an inaccurate attribute 
based value. Likewise, it would be 
inaccurate for manufacturers to submit 
values on the lower end of the ranges, 
but would decrease the likelihood that 
measured values would be less than the 
values reported and reduce the 
likelihood of an agency inquiry. Since 
not every vehicle is identical, it is also 
probable that variations between 
vehicles exist that can affect track 
width, wheelbase and footprint. As with 
other self-certifications, each 
manufacturer must decide how it will 
report, by model type, vehicle 
configuration, or a combination, and 
whether the reported values have 
sufficient margin to account for 
variations. 
To address this, the agency will be 
monitoring the track widths, wheelbases 
and footprints reported by 
manufacturers, and anticipates 
measuring vehicles to determine if the 
reported and measured values are 
consistent. We will look for year-to-year 
changes in the reported values. We can 
compare MY 2008 light truck 
information and MY 2010 passenger car 
information to the information reported 
in subsequent model years. Moreover, 
under 49 CFR 537.8, manufacturers may 
make separate reports to explain why 
changes have occurred or they may be 
contacted by the agency to explain 
them. 
d. How Manufacturers Report This 
Information in their Pre-Model Year 
Reports 
49 CFR 537.7(c) requires that 
manufacturers’ pre-model year reports 
include ‘‘model type and configuration 
fuel economy and technical 
information.’’ The fuel economy of a 
‘‘model type’’ is, for many 
manufacturers, comprised of a number 
of vehicle configurations. 49 CFR 537.4 
states that ‘‘model type’’ and ‘‘vehicle 
configuration’’ are defined in 40 CFR 
part 600. Under that Part, ‘‘model type’’ 
includes engine, transmission, and drive 
configuration (2WD, 4WD, or all-wheel 
drive), while ‘‘vehicle configuration’’ 
includes those parameters plus test 
weight. Model type is important for 
calculating fuel economy in the new 
attribute-based system—the required 
fuel economy level for each of a 
manufacturer’s fleets is calculated using 
the number of vehicles within each 
model type and the applicable fuel 
economy target for each model type. 
In MY 2008 and 2009 pre-model year 
reports for light trucks, manufacturers 
have expressed information in different 
ways. Some manufacturers that have 
many vehicle configurations within a 
model type have included information 
for each vehicle configuration’s track 
width, wheelbase and footprint. Other 
manufacturers reported vehicle 
configuration information per 
§ 537.7(c)(4), but provided only model 
type track width, wheelbase and 
footprint information for subsections 
537.7(c)(4)(xvi)(B)(3), (4) and (5). 
NHTSA believes that these 
manufacturers may have reported the 
information this way because the track 
widths, wheelbase and footprint are 
essentially the same for each vehicle 
configuration within each model type. A 
third group of manufacturers submitted 
model type information only, 
presumably because each model type 
contains only one vehicle configuration. 
NHTSA does not believe that this 
variation in reporting methodology 
presents an inherent problem, as long as 
manufacturers follow the specifications 
in Part 537 for reporting format, and as 
long as pre-model year reports provide 
information that is accurate and 
represents each vehicle configuration 
within a model type. The report may, 
but need not, be similar to what 
manufacturers submit to EPA as their 
end-of-model year report. However, 
NHTSA seeks comment on any potential 
benefits or drawbacks to requiring a 
more standardized reporting 
methodology. If commenters 
recommend increasing standardization, 
NHTSA requests that they provide

effect on the date of EISA’s enactment. 
specific examples of what information 
should be required and how NHTSA 
should require it to be provided. 
J. Other Near-Term Rulemakings 
Mandated by EISA 
1. Commercial Medium- and Heavy- 
Duty On-Highway Vehicles and Work 
Trucks 
EISA added a new provision to 49 
U.S.C. 32902 requiring DOT, in 
consultation with DOE and EPA, to 
examine the fuel efficiency of 
commercial medium- and heavy-duty 
on-highway vehicles 635 and work 
trucks 636 and determine the appropriate 
test procedures and methodologies for 
measuring their fuel efficiency, as well 
as the appropriate metric for measuring 
and expressing their fuel efficiency 
performance and the range of factors 
that affect their fuel efficiency. Work on 
developing these standards is on-going. 
2. Consumer Information 
EISA also added a new provision to 
49 U.S.C. 32908 requiring DOT, in 
consultation with DOE and EPA, to 
develop and implement by rule a 
program to require manufacturers to 
label new automobiles sold in the 
United States with: 
(1) Information reflecting an 
automobile’s performance on the basis 
of criteria that EPA shall develop, not 
later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of EISA, to reflect fuel 
economy and greenhouse gas and other 
emissions over the useful life of the 
automobile; and 
(2) A rating system that would make 
it easy for consumers to compare the 
fuel economy and greenhouse gas and 
other emissions of automobiles at the 
point of purchase, including a 
designation of automobiles with the 
lowest greenhouse gas emissions over 
the useful life of the vehicles; and with 
the highest fuel economy. 
DOT must also develop and 
implement by rule a program to require 
manufacturers to include in the owner’s 
manual for vehicles capable of operating 
on alternative fuels information that 
describes that capability and the 
benefits of using alternative fuels, 
including the renewable nature and 
environmental benefits of using 
alternative fuels. 
EISA further requires DOT, in 
consultation with DOE and EPA, to 
• Develop and implement by rule a 
consumer education program to 
improve consumer understanding of 
automobile performance described [by 
the label to be developed] and to inform 
consumers of the benefits of using 
alternative fuel in automobiles and the 
location of stations with alternative fuel 
capacity; 
• Establish a consumer education 
campaign on the fuel savings that would 
be recognized from the purchase of 
vehicles equipped with thermal 
management technologies, including 
energy efficient air conditioning systems 
and glass; and 
• By rule require a label to be 
attached to the fuel compartment of 
vehicles capable of operating on 
alternative fuels, with the form of 
alternative fuel stated on the label. 
49 U.S.C. 32908(g)(2) and (3). DOT has 
42 months from the date of EISA’s 
enactment (by the end of 2011) to issue 
final rules under this subsection. Work 
on developing these standards is also 
on-going. 
Additionally, in preparation for this 
future rulemaking, NHTSA will 
consider appropriate metrics for 
presenting fuel economy-related 
information on labels. Based on the non- 
linear relationship between mpg and 
fuel costs as well as emissions, 
inclusion of the ‘‘gallons per 100 miles’’ 
metric on fuel economy labels may be 
appropriate going forward, although the 
mpg information is currently required 
by law. A cost/distance metric may also 
be useful, as could a CO2e grams per 
mile metric to facilitate comparisons 
between conventional vehicles and 
alternative fuel vehicles and to 
incorporate information about air 
conditioning-related emissions. NHTSA 
seeks comment on these options. 
K. Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
Executive Order 12866, ‘‘Regulatory 
Planning and Review’’ (58 FR 51735, 
Oct. 4, 1993), provides for making 
determinations whether a regulatory 
action is ‘‘significant’’ and therefore 
subject to OMB review and to the 
requirements of the Executive Order. 
The Order defines a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ as one that is likely 
to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more or 
adversely affect in a material way the 
economy, a sector of the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or 
State, local or Tribal governments or 
communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary 
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, 
or loan programs or the rights and 
obligations of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues 
arising out of legal mandates, the 
President’s priorities, or the principles 
set forth in the Executive Order. 
The rulemaking proposed in this 
NPRM will be economically significant 
if adopted. Accordingly, OMB reviewed 
it under Executive Order 12866. The 
rule, if adopted, would also be 
significant within the meaning of the 
Department of Transportation’s 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures. 
The benefits and costs of this proposal 
are described above. Because the 
proposed rule would, if adopted, be 
economically significant under both the 
Department of Transportation’s 
procedures and OMB guidelines, the 
agency has prepared a Preliminary 
Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) and 
placed it in the docket and on the 
agency’s Web site. Further, pursuant to 
OMB Circular A–4, we have prepared a 
formal probabilistic uncertainty analysis 
for this proposal. The circular requires 
such an analysis for complex rules 
where there are large, multiple 
uncertainties whose analysis raises 
technical challenges or where effects 
cascade and where the impacts of the 
rule exceed $1 billion. This proposal 
meets these criteria on all counts. 
2. National Environmental Policy Act 
NHTSA has initiated the 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
process under the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 
U.S.C. 4321–4347, and implementing 
regulations issued by the Council on 
Environmental Quality (CEQ), 40 CFR 
part 1500, and NHTSA, 49 CFR part 
520. On April 1, 2009, NHTSA 
published a notice of intent to prepare 
an EIS for this rulemaking and 
requested scoping comments. (74 FR 
14857) The notice invites Federal, State, 
and local agencies, Indian tribes, and 
the public to participate in the scoping 
process and to help identify the 
environmental issues and reasonable 
alternatives to be examined in the EIS. 
The scoping notice also provides 
information about the proposed 
standards, the alternatives NHTSA 
expects to consider in its NEPA 
analysis, and the scoping process. 
Concurrently with this NPRM, 
NHTSA is releasing a Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). 
NHTSA prepared the DEIS to analyze 
and disclose the potential

environmental impacts of the proposed 
MY 2012–2016 CAFE standards for the 
total fleet of passenger cars and light 
trucks and reasonable alternative 
standards for the NHTSA CAFE Program 
pursuant to the Council on 
Environmental Quality (CEQ) 
regulations implementing NEPA, DOT 
Order 5610.1C, and NHTSA 
regulations.637 The DEIS compares the 
potential environmental impacts of 
alternative mile per gallon (mpg) levels 
that will be considered by NHTSA for 
the final rule. It also analyzes direct, 
indirect, and cumulative impacts and 
analyzes impacts in proportion to their 
significance. 
The DEIS also describes potential 
environmental impacts to a variety of 
resources. Resources that may be 
affected by the proposed action and 
alternatives include water resources, 
biological resources, land use and 
development, safety, hazardous 
materials and regulated wastes, noise, 
socioeconomics, and environmental 
justice. These resource areas were 
assessed qualitatively in the DEIS. 
Throughout the DEIS, NHTSA has 
relied extensively on findings of the 
United Nations Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. 
Climate Change Science Program 
(CCSP), and EPA. Our discussion relies 
heavily on the most recent, thoroughly 
peer-reviewed, and credible assessments 
of global and U.S. climate change: the 
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 
(Climate Change 2007), EPA’s proposed 
Endangerment and Cause or Contribute 
Findings for Greenhouse Gases under 
Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act and 
the accompanying Technical Support 
Document (TSD), and CCSP and 
National Science and Technology 
Council reports that include the 
Scientific Assessment of the Effects of 
Global Change on the United States and 
Synthesis and Assessment Products. 
The DEIS cites these sources and the 
studies they review frequently. 
Because of the link between the 
transportation sector and GHG 
emissions, NHTSA recognizes the need 
to consider the possible impacts on 
climate and global climate change in the 
analysis of the effects of these fuel 
economy standards. NHTSA also 
recognizes the difficulties and 
uncertainties involved in such an 
impact analysis. Accordingly, consistent 
with CEQ regulations on addressing 
incomplete or unavailable information 
in environmental impact analyses, 
NHTSA has reviewed existing credible 
scientific evidence that is relevant to 
this analysis and summarized it in the 
DEIS. NHTSA has also employed and 
summarized the results of research 
models generally accepted in the 
scientific community. 
Although the alternatives have the 
potential to decrease GHG emissions 
substantially, they do not prevent 
climate change, but only result in 
reductions in the anticipated increases 
in CO2 concentrations, temperature, 
precipitation, and sea level. They would 
also, to a small degree, delay the point 
at which certain temperature increases 
and other physical effects stemming 
from increased GHG emissions would 
occur. As discussed below, NHTSA 
presumes that these reductions in 
climate effects will be reflected in 
reduced impacts on affected resources. 
NHTSA consulted with various 
Federal agencies in the development of 
the DEIS, including EPA, Bureau of 
Land Management, Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, Minerals 
Management Service, National Park 
Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
U.S. Forest Service, and Advisory 
Council on Historic Preservation. 
NHTSA is also exploring its obligations 
under Section 7 of the Endangered 
Species Act with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Fisheries Service. 
The main direct and indirect effects 
resulting from the different alternatives 
analyzed in the DEIS are as follows: 
Fuel consumption: For passenger cars, 
fuel consumption under the No Action 
Alternative is 171 billion gallons in 
2060. Fuel consumption ranges from 
156.1 billion gallons under Alternative 
2 (3-Percent Alternative) to 133.7 billion 
gallons under Alternative 9 (TCTB). 
Fuel consumption is 149.3 billion 
gallons under the Preferred Alternative. 
For light trucks, fuel consumption 
under the No Action Alternative is 
105.4 billion gallons in 2060. Fuel 
consumption ranges from 97.1 billion 
gallons under Alternative 2 (3-Percent 
Alternative) to 83.8 billion gallons 
under Alternative 9 (TCTB). Fuel 
consumption is 92.2 billion gallons 
under the Preferred Alternative 
(Alternative 4). 
Air quality: Emissions of criteria 
pollutants change very little between 
the No Action Alternative and 
Alternatives 2 through 4. In the case of 
particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur oxides 
(SOX), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the 
No Action Alternative results in the 
highest emissions, and emissions 
generally decline as fuel economy 
standards increase across alternatives. 
There are some increases from 
Alternative 6 through Alternative 9, but 
emissions remain below the levels 
under the No Action Alternative. In the 
case of carbon monoxide (CO), 
emissions under Alternatives 2 through 
4 are slightly higher than under the No 
Action Alternative. Emissions of CO 
decline as fuel economy standards 
increase across Alternatives 5 through 9. 
The trend for toxic air pollutant 
emissions across the alternatives is 
mixed. Emissions of nearly all toxic air 
pollutants are highest under the No 
Action Alternative, except for those of 
acrolein, which increases with each 
successive alternative and are highest 
under Alternative 9. The acrolein 
emissions are an upper-bound estimate 
and actual emissions might be less. 
Emissions of acetaldehyde, benzene, 
and DPM in 2030 decrease with 
successive alternatives from Alternative 
1 to Alternative 9. Emissions of 1,3- 
butadiene increase slightly from 
Alternative 3 (4-Percent Alternative) to 
Alternative 4 (Preferred), and emissions 
of formaldehyde increase slightly from 
Alternative 8 (7-Percent Alternative) to 
Alternative 9 (TCTB) in 2030. 
The reductions in emissions are 
expected to lead to reductions in 
adverse health effects. There would be 
reductions in adverse health effects 
nationwide under Alternatives 2 (3- 
Percent Alternative) through 9 (TCTB) 
compared to the No Action Alternative. 
These reductions primarily reflect the 
projected PM2.5 reductions, and 
secondarily the reductions in SO2. The 
economic value of health impacts would 
vary proportionally with changes in 
health outcomes. 
Climate: The DEIS uses a climate 
model to estimate the changes in CO2 
concentrations, global mean surface 
temperature, and changes in sea level 
for each alternative CAFE standard. 
NHTSA used the publicly available 
modeling software, Model for 
Assessment of Greenhouse Gas-induced 
Climate Change (MAGICC) version 
5.3.v2 to estimate changes in key direct 
and indirect effects. The application of 
MAGICC version 5.3.v2 uses the 
emissions estimates for CO2, CH4, N2O, 
CO, NOX, SO2, and VOCs from the 
Volpe model. A sensitivity analysis was 
completed to examine the relationship 
among selected CAFE alternatives and 
likely climate sensitivities, and the 
associated direct and indirect effects for 
each combination. These relationships 
can be used to infer the effect of 
emissions associated with the regulatory 
alternatives on direct and indirect 
climate effects.

638 The reference scenario for global emissions 
assumes the absence of significant global GHG 
control policies. It is based on the Climate Change 
Science Program’s (CCSP) Synthesis and 
Assessment Product (SAP) 2.1 MiniCAM reference 
scenario, and has been revised by the Joint Global 
Change Research Institute to update emission 
estimates of non-CO2 gases. 
639 These conclusions are not meant to be 
interpreted as expressing NHTSA’s views that 
impacts on global mean surface temperature, 
precipitation, or sea-level rise are not areas of 
concern for policymakers. Under NEPA, the agency 
is obligated to discuss the environmental impact[s] 
of the proposed action. 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) 
(emphasis added). This analysis fulfills NHTSA’s 
obligations in this regard. 
640 NHTSA considers these AEO projected mpg 
increases to be reasonably foreseeable future actions 
under NEPA because the AEO projections reflect 
future consumer and industry actions that result in 
ongoing mpg gains through 2030. The AEO 
projections of fuel economy gains beyond the EISA 
requirement of combined achieved 35 mpg by 2020 
result from a future forecasted increase in consumer 
demand for fuel economy resulting from projected 
fuel price increases. Since the AEO forecasts do not 
extend beyond the year 2030, the mpg estimates for 
MY 2030 through MY 2060 remain constant. 
For the analysis using MAGICC, 
NHTSA has assumed that global 
emissions consistent with the No Action 
Alternative (Alternative 1) follow the 
trajectory provided by the 
Representative Concentration Pathway 
(RCP) 4.5 MiniCAM (Mini Climate 
Assessment Model) reference 
scenario.638 The SAP 2.1 global 
emissions scenarios were created as part 
of CCSP’s effort to develop a set of long- 
term (2000 to 2100) global emissions 
scenarios that incorporate an update of 
economic and technology data and 
utilize improved scenario development 
tools compared to the IPCC Special 
Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) 
developed more than a decade ago. 
The results rely primarily on the RCP 
4.5 MiniCAM reference scenario to 
represent an emissions scenario, that is, 
future global emissions assuming no 
additional climate policy. Each 
alternative was simulated by calculating 
the difference in annual GHG emissions 
in relation to the No Action Alternative 
and subtracting this change from the 
RCP 4.5 MiniCAM reference scenario to 
generate modified global-scale 
emissions scenarios, which each show 
the effect of the various regulatory 
alternatives on the global emissions 
path. 
To estimate changes in global 
precipitation, this EIS uses increases in 
global mean surface temperature 
combined with a scaling approach and 
coefficients from the IPCC Fourth 
Assessment Report. 
For all of the climate change analysis, 
the approaches focus on marginal 
changes in emissions that affect climate. 
Thus, the approaches result in a 
reasonable characterization of climate 
change for a given set of emissions 
reductions, regardless of the underlying 
details associated with those emissions 
reductions. The climate sensitivity 
analysis provides a basis for 
determining climate responses to 
varying climate sensitivities under the 
No Action Alternative (Alternative 1) 
and the Preferred Alternative 
(Alternative 4). Some responses of the 
climate system are believed to be non- 
linear; by using a range of emissions 
cases and climate sensitivities, the 
effects of the alternatives in relation to 
different scenarios and sensitivities can 
be estimated. 
GHG emissions: Although GHG 
emissions from new passenger cars and 
light trucks will continue to rise over 
2012 through 2100 (absent other 
reduction efforts), the effect of the 
alternatives is to slow this increase by 
varying amounts. Emissions for the 
period range from 196,341 million 
metric tons of CO2 (MMTCO2) for the 
TCTB Alternative (Alternative 9) to 
244,821 MMTCO2 for the No Action 
Alternative (Alternative 1). Compared to 
the No Action Alternative, projections 
of emissions reductions over the period 
2012 to 2100 due to the MY 2012–2016 
CAFE standards range from 19,169 to 
48,480 MMTCO2. Compared to 
cumulative global emissions of 
5,293,896 MMTCO2 over this period 
(projected by the RCP 4.5 MiniCAM 
reference scenario), this rulemaking is 
expected to reduce global CO2 emissions 
by about 0.4 to 0.9 percent. 
To get a sense of the relative impact 
of these reductions, it can be helpful to 
consider the relative importance of 
emissions from passenger cars and light 
trucks as a whole and to compare them 
against emissions projections from the 
transportation sector. As mentioned 
earlier, U.S. passenger cars and light 
trucks currently account for significant 
CO2 emissions in the United States. 
With the action alternatives reducing 
U.S. passenger car and light truck CO2 
emissions by 7.8 to 19.8 percent, the 
CAFE alternatives would have a 
noticeable impact on total U.S. CO2 
emissions. Compared to total U.S. CO2 
emissions in 2100 projected by the 
MiniCAM reference scenario of 7,886 
MMTCO2, the action alternatives would 
reduce annual U.S. CO2 emissions by 
3.5 to 8.9 percent in 2100. 
CO2 concentration, global mean 
surface temperature, sea-level rise, and 
precipitation: Estimated CO2 
concentrations for 2100 range from 
778.4 ppm under the most stringent 
alternative (TCTB) to 783.0 ppm under 
the No Action Alternative. For 2030 and 
2050, the range is even smaller. Because 
CO2 concentration is the key driver of 
other climate effects (which in turn act 
as drivers on resource impacts), this 
leads to small differences in these 
effects. For the No Action alternative, 
the temperature increase from 1990 is 
0.92 °C for 2030, 1.56 °C for 2050, and 
3.14 °C for 2100. The differences among 
alternatives are small. For 2100, the 
reduction in temperature increase, in 
relation to the No Action Alternative, 
ranges from 0.007 °C to 0.018 °C. Given 
that all the action alternatives reduce 
temperature increases slightly in 
relation to the No Action Alternative, 
they also slightly reduce predicted 
increases in precipitation. 
In summary, the impacts of the 
proposed action and alternatives on 
global mean surface temperature, 
precipitation, or sea-level rise are small 
in absolute terms. This is because the 
action alternatives have a small 
proportional change in the emissions 
trajectories in the RCP 4.5 MiniCAM 
reference scenario.639 This is due 
primarily to the global and multi- 
sectoral nature of the climate change 
issues. 
Under CEQ regulations, NHTSA must 
also analyze cumulative impacts, 
defined as ‘‘the impact on the 
environment which results from the 
incremental impact of the action when 
added to other past, present, and 
reasonably foreseeable future actions 
regardless of what agency or person 
undertakes such other actions.’’ 40 CFR 
1508.7. Following is a description of the 
cumulative effects of the proposed 
action and alternatives on energy, air 
quality, and climate. 
The methodology for evaluating 
cumulative effects includes the 
reasonably foreseeable future actions of 
projected average annual passenger-car 
and light-truck mpg estimates from 2016 
through 2030 that differ from mpg 
estimates reflected in the analysis of the 
direct and indirect impacts of MY 2012 
through MY 2016 fuel economy 
requirements under each of the action 
alternatives, assuming no further 
increases in average new passenger-car 
or light-truck mpg after 2016. The 
evaluation of cumulative effects projects 
ongoing gains in average new passenger- 
car and light-truck mpg consistent with 
further increases in CAFE standards to 
an EISA-mandated minimum level of 35 
mpg combined for passenger cars and 
light trucks by the year 2020, along with 
AEO April 2009 (updated) Reference 
Case projections of annual percentage 
gains of 0.51 percent in passenger-car 
mpg and 0.86 percent in light-truck mpg 
through 2030.640 AEO Reference Case

641 These conclusions are not meant to be 
interpreted as expressing NHTSA’s views that 
impacts on air quality is not an area of concern for 
policymakers. Under NEPA, the agency is obligated 
to discuss the environmental impact[s] of the 
proposed action. 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) (emphasis 
added). This analysis fulfills NHTSA’s obligations 
in this regard. 
projections are regarded as the official 
U.S. government energy projections by 
both the public and private sector. 
The assumption that all action 
alternatives reach the EISA 35 mpg 
target by 2020, with mpg growth at the 
AEO forecast rate from 2020 to 2030, 
results in estimated cumulative impacts 
for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 that are 
substantially equivalent, with any minor 
variation in cumulative impacts across 
these Alternatives due to the specific 
modeling assumptions used to ensure 
that each Alternative achieves at least 
35 mpg by 2020. Therefore, the 
cumulative impacts analysis adds 
substantively to the analysis of direct 
and indirect impacts when comparing 
cumulative impacts between 
Alternatives 4 through 9, but not when 
comparing cumulative impacts between 
Alternatives 2 through 4. Another 
important difference in the methodology 
for evaluating cumulative effects is that 
the No Action Alternative (Alternative 
1) also reflects the AEO Reference Case 
projected annual percentage gains of 
0.51 percent in car mpg and 0.86 
percent in light truck mpg for the period 
2016 through 2030, whereas the direct 
and indirect impacts analysis assumed 
no increases in average new passenger- 
car or light-truck mpg after 2016 under 
any alternative, including the No Action 
Alternative. NHTSA also considered 
other reasonably foreseeable actions that 
would affect greenhouse gas emissions, 
such as regional, national, and 
international initiatives and programs to 
reduce GHG emissions. 
Fuel consumption: The nine 
alternatives examined in the DEIS will 
result in different future levels of fuel 
use, total energy, and petroleum 
consumption, which will in turn have 
an impact on emissions of GHG and 
criteria air pollutants. For passenger 
cars, by 2060, fuel consumption reaches 
160.4 billion gallons under the No 
Action Alternative (Alternative 1). 
Consumption falls across the 
alternatives, from 139.4 billion gallons 
under the Preferred Alternative 
(Alternative 4) to 125.7 billion gallons 
under the TCTB Alternative (Alternative 
9) representing a fuel savings of 21.0 to 
34.7 billion gallons in 2060, as 
compared to fuel consumption projected 
under the No Action Alternative. For 
light trucks, fuel consumption by 2060 
reaches 94.8 billion gallons under the 
No Action Alternative (Alternative 1). 
Consumption declines across the 
alternatives, from 83.3 billion gallons 
under the 3-Percent Alternative 
(Alternative 2) to 75.7 billion gallons 
under the TCTB Alternative (Alternative 
9). This represents a fuel savings of 11.5 
to 19.1 billion gallons in 2060, as 
compared to fuel consumption projected 
under the No Action Alternative. 
Air quality: In the case of PM2.5, SOX, 
NOX, and VOCs, the No Action 
Alternative results in the highest 
emissions, and emissions generally 
decline as fuel economy standards 
increase across alternatives. Exceptions 
to this declining trend are NOX under 
the Preferred Alternative (Alternative 4); 
PM2.5 under Alternatives 3 and 4, and 
Alternatives 8 and 9; SOX under 
Alternatives 3 (4-Percent Alternative) 
and 4 (Preferred Alternative); and VOCs 
under Alternative 4. Despite these 
individual increases, emissions of 
PM2.5, SOX, NOX, and VOCs remain 
below the levels under the No Action 
Alternative (Alternative 1). In the case 
of CO, emissions under Alternatives 2 
through 4 are slightly higher than under 
the No Action Alternative. Emissions of 
CO decline as fuel economy standards 
increase across Alternatives 5 through 9. 
As with criteria pollutants, emissions 
of most toxic air pollutants would 
decrease from one alternative to the next 
more stringent alternative. The 
exceptions are acetaldehyde emissions, 
which would increase under Alternative 
4; acrolein emissions, which increase 
under each of the alternatives; benzene 
emissions, which would increase under 
Alternative 4; 1,3-butadiene, which 
would increase under Alternatives 2 
and 4; diesel particulate matter (DPM), 
which would increase under 
Alternatives 3 and 4; and formaldehyde, 
which would increase under 
Alternatives 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. The 
changes in toxic air pollutant emissions, 
whether positive or negative, generally 
would be small relative to Alternative 1 
emissions levels.641 The exceptions are 
acetaldehyde emissions, which would 
decrease by more than 10 percent under 
Alternative 9; acrolein emissions, which 
would increase across successive 
alternatives (as noted above, the 
acrolein emissions are an upper-bound 
estimate and actual emissions might be 
less); benzene emissions, which would 
decrease by more than 10 percent under 
Alternatives 8 and 9; and DPM 
emissions, which would decrease by 
more than 10 percent under all action 
alternatives. 
Cumulative emissions generally 
would be less than noncumulative 
emissions for the same combination of 
pollutant, year, and alternative because 
of differing changes in VMT and fuel 
consumption under the cumulative case 
compared to the noncumulative case. 
The exceptions are acrolein for all 
alternatives except Alternative 9, and 
1,3-butadiene for all alternatives except 
Alternative 2 (3-Percent Alternative). 
The reductions in emissions are 
expected to lead to reductions in 
cumulative adverse health effects. There 
would be reductions in adverse health 
effects nationwide under Alternatives 2 
(3-Percent Alternative) through 9 
(TCTB) compared to the No Action 
Alternative. Reductions in adverse 
health effects decrease from Alternative 
2 (3-Percent Alternative) through 
Alternative 4 (Preferred Alternative), 
and then increase under Alternatives 5 
(5-Percent Alternative through 
Alternative 9 (TCTB). These reductions 
primarily reflect the projected PM2.5 
reductions, and secondarily the 
reductions in SO2. The economic value 
of health impacts would vary 
proportionally with changes in health 
outcomes. 
Climate change: As with the analysis 
of the direct and indirect effects of the 
proposed action and alternatives on 
climate change, for the cumulative 
impacts analysis this EIS uses MAGICC 
version 5.3.v2 to estimate the changes in 
CO2 concentrations, global mean surface 
temperature, and changes in sea level 
for each alternative CAFE standard. To 
estimate changes in global precipitation, 
NHTSA uses increases in global mean 
surface temperature combined with a 
scaling approach and coefficients from 
the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. A 
sensitivity analysis was completed to 
examine the relationship among the 
alternatives and likely climate 
sensitivities, and the associated direct 
and indirect effects for each 
combination. These relationships can be 
used to infer the effect of emissions 
associated with the regulatory 
alternatives on direct and indirect 
climate effects. 
One of the key categories of inputs to 
MAGICC is a time series of global GHG 
emissions. In assessing the cumulative 
effects on climate, NHTSA used the 
CCSP SAP 2.1 MiniCAM Level 3 
scenario to represent a Reference Case 
global emission scenario, that is, future 
global emissions assuming significant 
global actions to address climate 
change. This Reference Case global 
emission scenario serves as a baseline 
against which the climate benefits of the 
various alternatives can be measured. 
The Reference Case global emissions 
scenario used in the cumulative impacts 
analysis (and described in Chapter 4 of 
this EIS) differs from the global 
emissions scenario used for the climate

642 The regional, national, and international 
initiatives and programs discussed above are those 
which NHTSA has tentatively concluded are 
reasonably foreseeable past, current, or future 
actions to reduce GHG emissions. Although some 
of the actions, policies, or programs listed are not 
associated with precise GHG reduction 
commitments, collectively they illustrate a current 
and continuing trend of U.S. and global awareness, 
emphasis, and efforts towards significant GHG 
reductions. Together they imply that future 
commitments for reductions are probable and, 
therefore, reasonably foreseeable under NEPA. 
643 Because the actual increase in global mean 
surface temperature lags the commitment to 
warming, the impact on global mean surface 
temperature increase is less than the long-term 
commitment to warming. 
644 These conclusions are not meant to be 
interpreted as expressing NHTSA’s views that 
impacts on global mean surface temperature, 
precipitation, or sea-level rise are not areas of 
concern for policymakers. Under NEPA, the agency 
is obligated to discuss the environmental impact[s] 
of the proposed action. 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) 
(emphasis added). This analysis fulfills NHTSA’s 
obligations in this regard. 
change modeling presented in Chapter 
3. In Chapter 4, the Reference Case 
global emission scenario reflects 
reasonably foreseeable actions in global 
climate change policy; in Chapter 3, the 
global emissions scenario used for the 
analysis assumes that there are no 
significant global controls. Given that 
the climate system is non-linear, the 
choice of a global emissions scenario 
could produce different estimates of the 
benefits of the proposed action and 
alternatives, if the emission reductions 
of the alternatives were held constant. 
The SAP 2.1 MiniCAM Level 3 
scenario assumes a moderate level of 
global GHG reductions, resulting in a 
global atmospheric CO2 concentration of 
roughly 650 parts per million by volume 
(ppmv) as of 2100. The following 
regional, national, and international 
initiatives and programs are reasonably 
foreseeable actions to reduce GHG 
emissions: Regional Greenhouse Gas 
Initiative (RGGI); Western Climate 
Initiative (WCI); Midwestern 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord; 
EPA’s Proposed GHG Emissions 
Standards; H.R. 2454: American Clean 
Energy and Security Act (‘‘Waxman- 
Markey Bill’’); Renewable Fuel Standard 
(RFS2); Program Activities of DOE’s 
Office of Fossil Energy; Program 
Activities of DOE’s Office of Nuclear 
Energy; United Nation’s Framework 
Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC)—The Kyoto Protocol and 
upcoming Conference of the Parties 
(COP) 15 in Copenhagen, Denmark; G8 
Declaration—Summit 2009; and the 
Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean 
Development and Climate.642 The SAP 
2.1 MiniCAM Level 3 scenario provides 
a global context for emissions of a full 
suite of GHGs and ozone precursors for 
a Reference Case harmonious with 
implementation of the above policies 
and initiatives. Each of the action 
alternatives was simulated by 
calculating the difference in annual 
GHG emissions in relation to the No 
Action Alternative, and subtracting this 
change in the MiniCAM Level 3 
scenario to generate modified global- 
scale emissions scenarios, which each 
show the effect of the various regulatory 
alternatives on the global emissions 
path. 
NHTSA used the MiniCAM Level 3 
scenario as the primary global emissions 
scenario for evaluating climate effects, 
and used the MiniCAM Level 2 scenario 
and the RCP 4.5 MiniCAM reference 
emissions scenario to evaluate the 
sensitivity of the results to alternative 
emission scenarios. The sensitivity 
analysis provides a basis for 
determining climate responses to 
varying levels of climate sensitivities 
and global emissions and under the No 
Action Alternative (Alternative 1) and 
the Preferred Alternative (Alternative 4). 
Some responses of the climate system 
are believed to be non-linear; by using 
a range of emissions cases and climate 
sensitivities, it is possible to estimate 
the effects of the alternatives in relation 
to different reference cases. 
Cumulative GHG emissions: 
Projections of GHG emissions 
reductions over the 2012 to 2100 period 
due to the MY 2012–2016 CAFE 
standards and other reasonably 
foreseeable future actions ranged from 
27,164 to 44,626 MMTCO2. Compared to 
global emissions of 3,919,462 MMTCO2 
over this period (projected by the SAP 
2.1 MiniCAM Level 3 scenario), the 
incremental impact of this rulemaking is 
expected to reduce global CO2 emissions 
by about 0.7 to 1.1 percent from their 
projected levels under the No Action 
Alternative. 
CO2 concentration, global mean 
surface temperature, sea-level rise, and 
precipitation: For the mid-range results 
of MAGICC model simulations for the 
No Action Alternative and the eight 
action alternatives in terms of CO2 
concentrations and increase in global 
mean surface temperature in 2030, 2050, 
and 2100, the impact on the growth in 
CO2 concentrations and temperature is 
just a fraction of the total growth in CO2 
concentrations and global mean surface 
temperature. However, the relative 
impact of the action alternatives is 
illustrated by the reduction in growth of 
both CO2 concentrations and 
temperature in the TCTB Alternative 
(Alternative 9). 
There is a fairly narrow band of 
estimated CO2 concentrations as of 
2100, from 653.5 ppm for the TCTB 
Alternative (Alternative 9) to 657.5 ppm 
for the No Action Alternative 
(Alternative 1). For 2030 and 2050, the 
range is even smaller. Because CO2 
concentrations are the key driver of all 
other climate effects, this leads to small 
differences in these effects. 
The MAGICC simulations of mean 
global surface air temperature increases 
are also shown in Table S–18. For all 
alternatives, the cumulative global mean 
surface temperature increase is about 
0.80 °C to 0.81 °C as of 2030; 1.32 to 
1.33 °C as of 2050; and 2.59 to 2.61 °C 
as of 2100.643 The differences among 
alternatives are small. For 2100, the 
reduction in temperature increase for 
the action alternatives in relation to the 
No Action Alternative is about 0.01 to 
0.02 °C. 
The impact on sea-level rise in 2100 
ranges from 32.84 centimeters under the 
No Action Alternative (Alternative 1) to 
32.68 centimeters under the TCTB 
Alternative (Alternative 9), for a 
maximum reduction of 0.16 centimeter 
by 2100 from the action alternatives. 
Given that the action alternatives 
would reduce temperature increases 
slightly in relation to the No Action 
Alternative (Alternative 1), they also 
would reduce predicted increases in 
precipitation slightly. In summary, the 
impacts of the proposed action and 
alternatives and other reasonably 
foreseeable future actions on global 
mean surface temperature, sea-level rise, 
and precipitation are relatively small in 
the context of the expected changes 
associated with the emissions 
trajectories in the SRES scenarios.644 
This is due primarily to the global and 
multi-sectoral nature of the climate 
problem. 
NHTSA examined the sensitivity of 
climate effects on key assumptions used 
in the analysis. The two variables for 
which assumptions were varied were 
climate sensitivity and global emissions. 
Climate sensitivities used included 
2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 °C for a doubling of CO2 
concentrations in the atmosphere. 
Global emissions scenarios used 
included the SAP 2.1 MiniCAM Level 3 
(650 ppm as of 2100), the SAP 2.1 
MiniCAM Level 2 (550 ppm as of 2100), 
and RCP 4.5 MiniCAM reference 
scenario (783 ppm as of 2100). The 
sensitivity analysis is based on the 
results provided for two alternatives— 
the No Action Alternative (Alternative 
1) and the Preferred Alternative 
(Alternative 4). The sensitivity analysis 
was conducted only for two alternatives, 
as this was deemed sufficient to assess 
the effect of various climate sensitivities 
on the results.

645 Equilibrium climate sensitivity (or climate 
sensitivity) is the projected responsiveness of 
Earth’s global climate system to forcing from GHG 
drivers, and is often expressed in terms of changes 
to global surface temperature resulting from a 
doubling of CO2 in relation to pre-industrial 
atmospheric concentrations. According to IPCC, 
using a likely emissions scenario that results in a 
doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2, 
there is a 66- to 90-percent probability of an 
increase in surface warming of 2.5 to 4.0 °C by the 
end of the century (relative to 1990 average global 
temperatures), with 3 °C as the single most likely 
surface temperature increase. 
646 See 42 U.S.C. 4332 (requiring Federal agencies 
to ‘‘identify and develop methods and procedures 
* * * which will insure that presently 
unquantified environmental amenities and values 
may be given appropriate consideration’’); 40 CFR 
1502.23 (requiring an EIS to discuss the 
relationship between a cost-benefit analysis and any 
analyses of unquantified environmental impacts, 
values, and amenities); CEQ, Considering 
Cumulative Effects Under the National 
Environmental Policy Act (1984), available at 
http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/ccenepa/ccenepa.htm 
(recognizing that agencies are sometimes ‘‘limited 
to qualitative evaluations of effects because cause- 
and-effect relationships are poorly understood’’ or 
cannot be quantified). 
The results of these simulations 
illustrate the uncertainty due to factors 
influencing future global emissions of 
GHGs (factors other than the CAFE 
rulemaking). The use of different 
climate sensitivities 645 (the equilibrium 
warming that occurs at a doubling of 
CO2 from pre-industrial levels) can 
affect not only warming but also 
indirectly affect sea-level rise and CO2 
concentration. The use of alternative 
global emissions scenarios can influence 
the results in several ways. Emissions 
reductions can lead to larger reductions 
in the CO2 concentrations in later years 
because more anthropogenic emissions 
can be expected to stay in the 
atmosphere. 
NHTSA’s analysis indicates that the 
sensitivity of the simulated CO2 
emissions in 2030, 2050, and 2100 to 
assumptions of global emissions and 
climate sensitivity is low; stated simply, 
CO2 emissions do not change much with 
changes in global emissions and climate 
sensitivity. For 2030 and 2050, the 
choice of global emissions scenario has 
little impact on the results. By 2100, the 
Preferred Alternative (Alternative 4) has 
the greatest impact in the global 
emissions scenario with the highest CO2 
emissions (MiniCAM Reference) and the 
least impact in the scenario with the 
lowest CO2 emissions (MiniCAM Level 
2). The total range of the impact of the 
Preferred Alternative on CO2 
concentrations in 2100 is from 2.2 to 2.6 
ppm. The Reference Case using the 
MiniCAM Level 3 scenario and a 3.0 °C 
climate sensitivity has an impact of 2.4 
ppm. 
The sensitivity of the simulated global 
mean surface temperatures for 2030 is 
also low due primarily to the slow rate 
at which the global mean surface 
temperature increases in response to 
increases in radiative forcing. The 
relatively slow response in the climate 
system explains the observation that 
even by 2100, when CO2 concentrations 
more than double in comparison to pre- 
industrial levels, the temperature 
increase is below the equilibrium 
sensitivity levels, i.e., the climate 
system has not had enough time to 
equilibrate to the new CO2 
concentrations. Nonetheless, as of 2100 
there is a larger range in temperatures 
across the different values of climate 
sensitivity: The reduction in global 
mean surface temperature from the No 
Action Alternative to the Preferred 
Alternative ranges from 0.008 °C for the 
2.0 °C climate sensitivity to 0.012 °C for 
the 4.5 °C climate sensitivity, for the 
MiniCAM Level 3 emissions scenario. 
The impact on global mean surface 
temperature due to assumptions 
concerning global emissions of GHGs is 
also important. The scenario with the 
higher global emissions of GHGs (viz., 
the MiniCAM Reference) has a slightly 
lower reduction in global mean surface 
temperature, and the scenario with 
lower global emissions (viz., the 
MiniCAM Level 2) has a slightly higher 
reduction. This is in large part due to 
the non-linear and near-logarithmic 
relationship between radiative forcing 
and CO2 concentrations. At high 
emissions levels, CO2 concentrations are 
higher and, as a result, a fixed reduction 
in emissions yields a lower reduction in 
radiative forcing and global mean 
surface temperature. 
The sensitivity of the simulated sea- 
level rise to changes in climate 
sensitivity and global GHG emissions 
mirrors that of global temperature. 
Scenarios with lower climate 
sensitivities have lower increases in sea- 
level rise. The greater the climate 
sensitivity, the greater the decrement in 
sea-level rise for the Preferred 
Alternative as compared to the No 
Action Alternative. 
Resource impacts of climate change: 
The effects of the alternatives on 
climate—CO2 concentrations, 
temperature, precipitation, and sea-level 
rise—can translate into impacts on key 
resources including terrestrial and 
freshwater ecosystems; marine, coastal 
systems, and low-lying areas; food, 
fiber, and forest products; industries, 
settlements, and society; and human 
health. Although the alternatives have 
the potential to substantially decrease 
GHG emissions, they would not alone 
prevent climate change from occurring. 
The magnitude of the changes in climate 
effects that the alternatives would 
produce—two to five parts per million 
of CO2, a few hundredths of a degree 
Celsius difference in temperature, a 
small percentage change in the rate of 
precipitation increase, and 1 or 2 
millimeters of sea-level rise—are too 
small to address quantitatively in terms 
of their impacts on resources. Given the 
enormous resource values at stake, these 
distinctions could be important—very 
small percentages of huge numbers can 
still yield substantial results—but they 
are too small for current quantitative 
techniques to resolve. Consequently, the 
discussion of resource impacts does not 
distinguish among the CAFE 
alternatives; rather, it provides a 
qualitative review of the benefits of 
reducing GHG emissions and the 
magnitude of the risks involved in 
climate change.646 
NHTSA examined the impacts 
resulting from global climate change 
due to all global emissions on the U.S. 
and global scale. Impacts to freshwater 
resources could include changes in 
precipitation patterns, decreasing 
aquifer recharge in some locations, 
changes in snowpack and timing of 
snowmelt, salt-water intrusion from sea- 
level changes, changes in weather 
patterns resulting in flooding or drought 
in certain regions, increased water 
temperature, and numerous other 
changes to freshwater systems that 
disrupt human use and natural aquatic 
habitats. Impacts to terrestrial 
ecosystems could include shifts in 
species range and migration patterns, 
potential extinctions of sensitive species 
unable to adapt to changing conditions, 
increases in the occurrence of forest 
fires and pest infestation, and changes 
in habitat productivity because of 
increased atmospheric CO2. Impacts to 
coastal ecosystems, primarily from 
predicted sea-level rise, could include 
the loss of coastal areas due to 
submersion and erosion, additional 
impacts from severe weather and storm 
surges, and increased salinization of 
estuaries and freshwater aquifers (for 
example, one impact could be 
reductions in manatee habitat in the 
Florida coastal areas). Impacts to land 
use and several key economic sectors 
could include flooding and severe- 
weather impacts to coastal, floodplain, 
and island settlements; extreme heat 
and cold waves; increases in drought in 
some locations; and weather- or sea- 
level related disruptions of the service, 
agricultural, and transportation sectors. 
Impacts to human health could include 
increased mortality and morbidity due 
to excessive heat, increases in 
respiratory conditions due to poor air 
quality, increases in water and food-

borne diseases, changes to the seasonal 
patterns of vector-borne diseases, and 
increases in malnutrition. 
Non-climate cumulative impacts of 
CO2 emissions: In addition to its role as 
a GHG in the atmosphere, CO2 is 
transferred from the atmosphere to 
water, plants, and soil. In water, CO2 
combines with water molecules to form 
carbonic acid. When CO2 dissolves in 
seawater, a series of well-known 
chemical reactions begin that increase 
the concentration of hydrogen ions and 
make seawater more acidic, which has 
adverse effects on corals and some other 
marine life. 
Increased concentrations of CO2 in the 
atmosphere can also stimulate plant 
growth to some degree, a phenomenon 
known as the CO2 fertilization effect. 
This effect could have positive 
ramifications for agricultural 
productivity and forest growth. The 
available evidence indicates that 
different plants respond in different 
ways to enhanced CO2 concentrations. 
As with the climate effects of CO2, the 
changes in non-climate impacts 
associated with the alternatives are 
difficult to assess quantitatively. 
Whether the distinction in 
concentrations is substantial across 
alternatives is not clear because the 
damage functions and potential 
existence of thresholds for CO2 
concentration are not known. However, 
what is clear is that a reduction in the 
rate of increase in atmospheric CO2, 
which all the action alternatives would 
provide to some extent, would reduce 
the ocean acidification effect and the 
CO2 fertilization effect. 
For much more information on 
NHTSA’s NEPA analysis, please see the 
DEIS. 
3. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended by 
the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 
1996), whenever an agency is required 
to publish a notice of rulemaking for 
any proposed or final rule, it must 
prepare and make available for public 
comment a regulatory flexibility 
analysis that describes the effect of the 
rule on small entities (i.e., small 
businesses, small organizations, and 
small governmental jurisdictions). The 
Small Business Administration’s 
regulations at 13 CFR part 121 define a 
small business, in part, as a business 
entity ‘‘which operates primarily within 
the United States.’’ 13 CFR 121.105(a). 
No regulatory flexibility analysis is 
required if the head of an agency 
certifies the rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
I certify that the proposed rule would 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. The following is NHTSA’s 
statement providing the factual basis for 
the certification (5 U.S.C. 605(b)). 
If adopted, the proposal would 
directly affect twenty-one large single 
stage motor vehicle manufacturers.647 
The proposal would also affect two 
small domestic single stage motor 
vehicle manufacturers, Saleen and 
Tesla.648 According to the Small 
Business Administration’s small 
business size standards (see 13 CFR 
121.201), a single stage automobile or 
light truck manufacturer (NAICS code 
336111, Automobile Manufacturing; 
336112, Light Truck and Utility Vehicle 
Manufacturing) must have 1,000 or 
fewer employees to qualify as a small 
business. Both Saleen and Tesla have 
less than 1,000 employees and make 
less than 1,000 vehicles per year. We 
believe that the rulemaking would not 
have a significant economic impact on 
these small vehicle manufacturers 
because under Part 525, passenger car 
manufacturers making less than 10,000 
vehicles per year can petition NHTSA to 
have alternative standards set for those 
manufacturers. Tesla produces only 
electric vehicles with fuel economy 
values far beyond those proposed today, 
so we would not expect them to need 
to petition for relief. Saleen modifies a 
very small number of vehicles produced 
by one of the 21 large single-stage 
manufacturers, and currently does not 
meet the 27.5 mpg passenger car 
standard, nor is it anticipated to be able 
to meet the standards proposed today. 
However, Saleen already petitions the 
agency for relief. If the standard is 
raised, it has no meaningful impact on 
Saleen, because it must still go through 
the same process to petition for relief. 
Given that there already is a mechanism 
for handling small businesses, which is 
the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, a regulatory flexibility analysis was 
not prepared. 
4. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
Executive Order 13132 requires 
NHTSA to develop an accountable 
process to ensure ‘‘meaningful and 
timely input by State and local officials 
in the development of regulatory 
policies that have federalism 
implications.’’ The Order defines the 
term ‘‘Policies that have federalism 
implications’’ to include regulations 
that have ‘‘substantial direct effects on 
the States, on the relationship between 
the national government and the States, 
or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government.’’ Under the Order, 
NHTSA may not issue a regulation that 
has federalism implications, that 
imposes substantial direct compliance 
costs, and that is not required by statute, 
unless the Federal government provides 
the funds necessary to pay the direct 
compliance costs incurred by State and 
local governments, or NHTSA consults 
with State and local officials early in the 
process of developing the proposed 
regulation. 
NHTSA solicits comment on this 
proposed action from State and local 
officials. In his January 26 
memorandum, the President requested 
NHTSA to ‘‘consider whether any 
provisions regarding preemption are 
consistent with the EISA, the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. 
EPA and other relevant provisions of 
law and the policies underlying them.’’ 
NHTSA is deferring consideration of the 
preemption issue. The agency believes 
that it is unnecessary to address the 
issue further at this time because of the 
consistent and coordinated Federal 
standards that would apply nationally 
under the proposed National Program. 
5. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice 
Reform) 
Pursuant to Executive Order 12988, 
‘‘Civil Justice Reform,’’ 649 NHTSA has 
considered whether this rulemaking 
would have any retroactive effect. This 
proposed rule does not have any 
retroactive effect. 
6. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
requires Federal agencies to prepare a 
written assessment of the costs, benefits, 
and other effects of a proposed or final 
rule that includes a Federal mandate 
likely to result in the expenditure by 
State, local, or tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
more than $100 million in any one year 
(adjusted for inflation with base year of 
1995). Adjusting this amount by the 
implicit gross domestic product price 
deflator for 2006 results in $126 million 
(116.043/92.106=1.26). Before 
promulgating a rule for which a written 
statement is needed, section 205 of

650 The national median hourly rate for 
mechanical engineers, May 2008, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, is $36.02. See http:// 
www.bls.gov/oes/2008/may/oes_nat.htm#b17-0000 
(last accessed August 26, 2009). 
UMRA generally requires NHTSA to 
identify and consider a reasonable 
number of regulatory alternatives and 
adopt the least costly, most cost- 
effective, or least burdensome 
alternative that achieves the objectives 
of the rule. The provisions of section 
205 do not apply when they are 
inconsistent with applicable law. 
Moreover, section 205 allows NHTSA to 
adopt an alternative other than the least 
costly, most cost-effective, or least 
burdensome alternative if the agency 
publishes with the final rule an 
explanation why that alternative was 
not adopted. 
This proposed rule will not result in 
the expenditure by State, local, or tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, of more 
than $126 million annually, but it will 
result in the expenditure of that 
magnitude by vehicle manufacturers 
and/or their suppliers. In promulgating 
this proposal, NHTSA considered a 
variety of alternative average fuel 
economy standards lower and higher 
than those proposed. NHTSA is 
statutorily required to set standards at 
the maximum feasible level achievable 
by manufacturers based on its 
consideration and balancing of relevant 
factors and has tentatively concluded 
that the proposed fuel economy 
standards are the maximum feasible 
standards for the passenger car and light 
truck fleets for MYs 2012–2016 in light 
of the statutory considerations. 
7. Paperwork Reduction Act 
Under the procedures established by 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, a 
person is not required to respond to a 
collection of information by a Federal 
agency unless the collection displays a 
valid OMB control number. This section 
describes a request for clearance for a 
collection of information associated 
with product plan information to assist 
the agency in developing final corporate 
average fuel economy standards for MY 
2012 through 2016 passenger cars and 
light trucks. The establishment of those 
standards is required by the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act, as 
amended by the Energy Independence 
and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, Pub. L. 
110–140. In compliance with the PRA, 
this notice requests comment on the 
Information Collection Request (ICR) 
abstracted below. The ICR describes the 
nature of the information collection and 
its expected burden. This is a request for 
an extension of an existing collection. 
Agency: National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA). 
Title: 49 CFR parts 531 and 533 
Passenger Car Average Fuel Economy 
Standards—Model Years 2008–2020; 
Light Truck Average Fuel Economy 
Standards—Model Years 2008–2020; 
Production Plan Data 
Type of Request: Extension of existing 
collection. 
OMB Clearance Number: 2127–0655. 
Form Number: This collection of 
information will not use any standard 
forms. 
Summary of the Collection of 
Information 
In this collection of information, 
NHTSA is requesting any updates to 
previously-submitted future product 
plans from vehicle manufacturers, as 
well as production data through the 
recent past, including data about 
engines and transmissions for model 
year (MY) 2008 through MY 2020 
passenger cars and light trucks and the 
assumptions underlying those plans. If 
manufacturers have not previously 
submitted product plan information to 
NHTSA and wish to do so, NHTSA also 
requests such information from them. 
NHTSA requests information for MYs 
2008–2020 to supplement other 
information used by NHTSA in 
developing a realistic forecast of the MY 
2012–2016 vehicle market, and in 
evaluating what technologies may 
feasibly be applied by manufacturers to 
achieve compliance with the MY 2012– 
2016 standards. Information regarding 
earlier model years may help the agency 
to better account for cumulative effects 
such as volume- and time-based 
reductions in costs, and also may help 
to reveal product mix and technology 
application trends during model years 
for which the agency is currently 
receiving actual corporate average fuel 
economy (CAFE) compliance data. 
Information regarding later model years 
may help the agency gain a better 
understanding of how manufacturers’ 
plans through MY 2016 relate to their 
longer-term expectations regarding 
Energy Independence and Security Act 
requirements, market trends, and 
prospects for more advanced 
technologies. 
NHTSA will also consider 
information from model years before 
and after MYs 2012–2016 when 
reviewing manufacturers’ planned 
schedules for redesigning and 
freshening their products, in order to 
examine how manufacturers anticipate 
tying technology introduction to 
product design schedules and to 
consider how the agency should 
account for those schedules in its 
analysis for the final rule. In addition, 
the agency is requesting information 
regarding manufacturers’ estimates of 
the future vehicle population, and fuel 
economy improvements and 
incremental costs attributed to this 
notice. 
Description of the Need for the 
Information and Use of the Information 
NHTSA needs the information 
described above to aid in assessing what 
CAFE standards should be established 
for MY 2012 through 2016 passenger 
cars and light trucks. 
Description of the Likely Respondents 
(Including Estimated Number, and 
Proposed Frequency of Response to the 
Collection of Information) 
It is estimated that this collection 
affects approximately 22 motor vehicle 
manufacturers. The information that is 
the subject of this collection of 
information is collected whenever 
NHTSA publishes a notice of proposed 
rulemaking for the purpose of setting 
CAFE standards. 
Estimate of the Total Annual Reporting 
and Recordkeeping Burden Resulting 
From the Collection of Information 
It is estimated that this collection 
affects approximately 22 vehicle 
manufacturers. One major manufacturer 
(General Motors) estimated their burden 
to be approximately 4,300 hours. The 
burden to other manufacturers was 
estimated using sales weights relative to 
General Motor’s total sales (e.g., if a 
manufacturer produces 50 percent as 
many vehicles as General Motors, their 
burden is estimated to be 4,300 * 0.5 = 
2,150 hours). Therefore the burden to 
each manufacturer depends on the 
number of vehicles that manufacturer 
produces. The total estimated burden is 
16,000 hours annually.

The monetized cost associated with this

vehicle manufacturers will use 
mechanical engineers to prepare and 
submit the data. Therefore, we are 
applying a labor rate of $36.02 per hour 
which is the median national wage for 
mechanical engineers.650 Thus, the

Comments are specifically sought on 
the following issues: 
• Whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
Department, including whether the 
information will have practical utility. 
• Whether the Department’s estimate 
for the burden of the information 
collection is accurate. 
• Ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on 
respondents, including the use of 
automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology. 
Please send comments to the docket 
number cited in the heading of this 
notice. PRA comments are due within 
60 days following publication of this 
document in the Federal Register. The 
agency recognizes that the amendment 
to the existing collection of information 
may be subject to revision in response 
to public comments and the OMB 
review. 
For further information on this 
proposal to extend the collection of 
information, please contact Ken Katz, 
Fuel Economy Division, Office of 
International Policy, Fuel Economy, and 
Consumer Programs, National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, 1200 New 
Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC

phone at (202) 366–0846 or by fax at 
(202) 493–2290. 
8. Regulation Identifier Number 
The Department of Transportation 
assigns a regulation identifier number 
(RIN) to each regulatory action listed in 
the Unified Agenda of Federal 
Regulations. The Regulatory Information 
Service Center publishes the Unified 
Agenda in April and October of each 
year. You may use the RIN contained in 
the heading at the beginning of this 
document to find this action in the 
Unified Agenda. 
9. Executive Order 13045 
Executive Order 13045 651 applies to 
any rule that: (1) Is determined to be 
economically significant as defined 
under E.O. 12866, and (2) concerns an 
environmental, health, or safety risk that 
NHTSA has reason to believe may have 
a disproportionate effect on children. If 
the regulatory action meets both criteria, 
we must evaluate the environmental 
health or safety effects of the proposed 
rule on children, and explain why the 
proposed regulation is preferable to 
other potentially effective and 
reasonably foreseeable alternatives 
considered by us. 
Chapter 4 of NHTSA’s DEIS notes that 
breathing PM can cause respiratory 
ailments, heart attack, and arrhythmias 
(Dockery et al. 1993, Samet et al. 2000, 
Pope et al. 1995, 2002, 2004, Pope and 
Dockery 2006, Dominici et al. 2006, 
Laden et al. 2006, all in Ebi et al. 2008). 
Populations at greatest risk could 
include children, the elderly, and those 
with heart and lung disease, diabetes 
(Ebi et al. 2008), and high blood 
pressure (Künzli et al. 2005, in Ebi et al. 
2008). Chronic exposure to PM could 
decrease lifespan by 1 to 3 years (Pope 
2000, in American Lung Association 
2008). Increasing PM concentrations are 
expected to have a measurable adverse 
impact on human health (Confalonieri 
et al. 2007). 
Additionally, the DEIS notes that 
substantial morbidity and childhood 
mortality has been linked to water- and 
food-borne diseases. Climate change is 
projected to alter temperature and the 
hydrologic cycle through changes in 
precipitation, evaporation, 
transpiration, and water storage. These 
changes, in turn, potentially affect 
water-borne and food-borne diseases, 
such as salmonellosis, campylobacter, 
leptospirosis, and pathogenic species of 
vibrio. They also have a direct impact 
on surface water availability and water 
quality. It has been estimated that more 
than 1 billion people in 2002 did not 
have access to adequate clean water 
(McMichael et al. 2003, in Epstein et al. 
2006). Increased temperatures, greater 
evaporation, and heavy rain events have 
been associated with adverse impacts on 
drinking water through increased 
waterborne diseases, algal blooms, and 
toxins (Chorus and Bartram 1999, Levin 
et al. 2002, Johnson and Murphy 2004, 
all in Epstein et al. 2006). A seasonal 
signature has been associated with 
waterborne disease outbreaks (EPA 
2009b). In the United States, 68 percent 
of all waterborne diseases between 1948 
and 1994 were observed after heavy 
rainfall events (Curriero et al. 2001a, in 
Epstein et al. 2006). 
Climate change could further impact 
a pathogen by directly affecting its life 
cycle (Ebi et al. 2008). The global 
increase in the frequency, intensity, and 
duration of red tides could be linked to 
local impacts already associated with 
climate change (Harvell et al. 1999, in 
Epstein et al. 2006); toxins associated 
with red tide directly affect the nervous 
system (Epstein et al. 2006). 
Many people do not report or seek 
medical attention for their ailments of 
water-borne or food-borne diseases; 
hence, the number of actual cases with 
these diseases is greater than clinical 
records demonstrate (Mead et al. 1999, 
in Ebi et al. 2008). Many of the 
gastrointestinal diseases associated with 
water-borne and food-borne diseases 
can be self-limiting; however, 
vulnerable populations include young 
children, those with a compromised 
immune system, and the elderly. 
Thus, as detailed in the DEIS, NHTSA 
has evaluated the environmental health 
and safety effects of the proposed rule 
on children. The DEIS also explains 
why the proposed regulation is 
preferable to other potentially effective 
and reasonably foreseeable alternatives 
considered by the agency. 
10. National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act 
Section 12(d) of the National 
Technology Transfer and Advancement 
Act (NTTAA) requires NHTA to 
evaluate and use existing voluntary 
consensus standards in its regulatory 
activities unless doing so would be 
inconsistent with applicable law (e.g., 
the statutory provisions regarding 
NHTSA’s vehicle safety authority) or 
otherwise impractical. 
Voluntary consensus standards are 
technical standards developed or 
adopted by voluntary consensus 
standards bodies. Technical standards 
are defined by the NTTAA as 
‘‘performance-base or design-specific 
technical specification and related 
management systems practices.’’ They 
pertain to ‘‘products and processes, 
such as size, strength, or technical 
performance of a product, process or 
material.’’ 
Examples of organizations generally 
regarded as voluntary consensus 
standards bodies include the American 
Society for Testing and Materials 
(ASTM), the Society of Automotive 
Engineers (SAE), and the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI). If 
NHTSA does not use available and 
potentially applicable voluntary 
consensus standards, we are required by 
the Act to provide Congress, through 
OMB, an explanation of the reasons for 
not using such standards. 
There are currently no voluntary 
consensus standards relevant to today’s 
proposed CAFE standards. 
11. Executive Order 13211 
Executive Order 13211 652 applies to 
any rule that: (1) Is determined to be 
economically significant as defined 
under E.O. 12866, and is likely to have 
a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy; or 
(2) that is designated by the 
Administrator of the Office of

49748 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Information and Regulatory Affairs as a 
significant energy action. If the 
regulatory action meets either criterion, 
we must evaluate the adverse energy 
effects of the proposed rule and explain 
why the proposed regulation is 
preferable to other potentially effective 
and reasonably feasible alternatives 
considered by us. 
The proposed rule seeks to establish 
passenger car and light truck fuel 
economy standards that will reduce the 
consumption of petroleum and will not 
have any adverse energy effects. 
Accordingly, this proposed rulemaking 
action is not designated as a significant 
energy action. 
12. Department of Energy Review 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
32902(j)(1), we submitted this proposed 
rule to the Department of Energy for 
review. That Department did not make 
any comments that we have not 
addressed. 
13. Plain Language 
Executive Order 12866 requires each 
agency to write all rules in plain 
language. Application of the principles 
of plain language includes consideration 
of the following questions: 
• Have we organized the material to 
suit the public’s needs? 
• Are the requirements in the rule 
clearly stated? 
• Does the rule contain technical 
language or jargon that isn’t clear? 
• Would a different format (grouping 
and order of sections, use of headings, 
paragraphing) make the rule easier to 
understand? 
• Would more (but shorter) sections 
be better? 
• Could we improve clarity by adding 
tables, lists, or diagrams? 
• What else could we do to make the 
rule easier to understand? 
If you have any responses to these 
questions, please include them in your 
comments on this proposal.

aggressive driving (US06) and air 
conditioning (SC03) that comprise the 
exhaust emission components of the 
SFTP. Section 86.127–96(e) discusses 
fuel spitback emissions and paragraphs 
(h) and (i) of this section are applicable 
to all vehicle emission test procedures. 
Section 86.127–00 includes text that 
specifies requirements that differ from 
§ 86.127–96. Where a paragraph in 
§ 86.127–96 is identical and applicable 
to § 86.127–00, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph 
and the statement ‘‘[Reserved]. For 
guidance see § 86.127–96.’’ 
(a) The overall test consists of 
prescribed sequences of fueling, 
parking, and operating test conditions. 
Vehicles are tested for any or all of the 
following emissions, depending upon 
the specific test requirements and the 
vehicle fuel type: 
(1) Gaseous exhaust THC, NMHC, CO, 
NOX, CO2, N2O, CH4, CH3OH, C2H5OH, 
C2H4O, and HCHO. 
* * * * * 
(b) The FTP Otto-cycle exhaust 
emission test is designed to determine 
gaseous THC, CO, CO2, CH4, NOX, N2O, 
and particulate mass emissions from 
gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and 
gaseous-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles as 
well as methanol and formaldehyde 
from methanol-fueled Otto-cycle 
vehicles, as well as methanol, ethanol, 
acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde from 
ethanol-fueled vehicles while 
simulating an average trip in an urban 
area of 11 miles (18 kilometers). The test 
consists of engine start-ups and vehicle 
operation on a chassis dynamometer 
through a specified driving schedule 
(see paragraph (a) of appendix I to this 
part for the Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule). A proportional part of the 
diluted exhaust is collected 
continuously for subsequent analysis, 
using a constant volume (variable 
dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi 
sampler. 
(c) The diesel-cycle exhaust emission 
test is designed to determine particulate 
and gaseous mass emissions during a 
test similar to the test in § 86.127(b). For 
petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles, 
diluted exhaust is continuously 
analyzed for THC using a heated sample 
line and analyzer; the other gaseous 
emissions (CH4, CO, CO2, N2O, and 
NOX) are collected continuously for 
analysis as in § 86.127(b). For methanol- 
and ethanol-fueled vehicles, THC, 
methanol, formaldehyde, CO, CO2, CH4, 
N2O, and NOX are collected 
continuously for analysis as in 
§ 86.127(b). Additionally, for ethanol- 
fueled vehicles, ethanol and 
acetaldehyde are collected continuously 
for analysis as in § 86.127(b). THC, 
methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and 
formaldehyde are collected using heated 
sample lines, and a heated FID is used 
for THC analyses. Simultaneous with 
the gaseous exhaust collection and 
analysis, particulates from a 
proportional part of the diluted exhaust 
are collected continuously on a filter. 
The mass of particulate is determined 
by the procedure described in § 86.139. 
This testing requires a dilution tunnel as 
well as the constant volume sampler. 
(d)–(e) [Reserved]. For guidance see 
§ 86.127–96. 
* * * * * 
5. Section 86.135–00 is amended by 
revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§ 86.135–12 Dynamometer procedure. 
* * * * * 
(a) Overview. The dynamometer run 
consists of two tests, a ‘‘cold’’ start test, 
after a minimum 12-hour and a 
maximum 36-hour soak according to the 
provisions of §§ 86.132 and 86.133, and 
a ‘‘hot’’ start test following the ‘‘cold’’ 
start by 10 minutes. Engine startup 
(with all accessories turned off), 
operation over the UDDS and engine 
shutdown make a complete cold start 
test. Engine startup and operation over 
the first 505 seconds of the driving 
schedule complete the hot start test. The 
exhaust emissions are diluted with 
ambient air in the dilution tunnel as 
shown in Figure B94–5 and Figure B94– 
6. A dilution tunnel is not required for 
testing vehicles waived from the 
requirement to measure particulates. Six 
particulate samples are collected on 
filters for weighing; the first sample plus 
backup is collected during the first 505 
seconds of the cold start test; the second 
sample plus backup is collected during 
the remainder of the cold start test 
(including shutdown); the third sample 
plus backup is collected during the hot 
start test. Continuous proportional 
samples of gaseous emissions are 
collected for analysis during each test 
phase. For gasoline-fueled, natural gas- 
fueled and liquefied petroleum gas- 
fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the 
composite samples collected in bags are 
analyzed for THC, CO, CO2, CH4, NOX, 
and, for 2012 and later model year 
vehicles, N2O. For petroleum-fueled 
diesel-cycle vehicles (optional for 
natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum 
gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel- 
cycle vehicles), THC is sampled and 
analyzed continuously according to the 
provisions of § 86.110. Parallel samples 
of the dilution air are similarly analyzed 
for THC, CO, CO2, CH4, NOX, and, for 
2012 and later model year vehicles, 
N2O. For natural gas-fueled, liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled and methanol- 
fueled vehicles, bag samples are 
collected and analyzed for THC (if not 
sampled continuously), CO, CO2, CH4, 
NOX, and, for 2012 and later model year 
vehicles, N2O. For methanol-fueled 
vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde 
samples are taken for both exhaust 
emissions and dilution air (a single 
dilution air formaldehyde sample, 
covering the total test period may be 
collected). For ethanol-fueled vehicles, 
methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and 
formaldehyde samples are taken for 
both exhaust emissions and dilution air 
(a single dilution air formaldehyde 
sample, covering the total test period 
may be collected). Parallel bag samples 
of dilution air are analyzed for THC, CO, 
CO2, CH4, NOX, and, for 2012 and later 
model year vehicles, N2O. Methanol and 
formaldehyde samples may be omitted 
for 1990 through 1994 model years 
when a FID calibrated on methanol is 
used. 
* * * * * 
6. A new § 86.165–12 is added to 
subpart B to read as follows: 
§ 86.165–12 Air conditioning idle test 
procedure. 
(a) Applicability. This section 
describes procedures for determining air 
conditioning-related CO2 emissions 
from 2014 and later model year light- 
duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and 
medium-duty passenger vehicles. The 
results of this test are used to qualify for 
air conditioning efficiency CO2 credits 
according to § 86.1866–12(c). 
(b) Overview. The test consists of a 
brief period to stabilize the vehicle at 
idle, followed by a ten-minute period at 
idle when CO2 emissions are measured 
without any air conditioning systems 
operating, followed by a ten-minute 
period at idle when CO2 emissions are 
measured with the air conditioning 
system operating. This test is designed 
to determine the air conditioning- 
related CO2 emission value, in grams 
per minute. If engine stalling occurs 
during cycle operation, follow the 
provisions of § 86.136–90 to restart the 
test. Measurement instruments must 
meet the specifications described in this 
subpart. 
(c) Test cell ambient conditions. 
(1) Ambient humidity within the test 
cell during all phases of the test 
sequence shall be controlled to an 
average of 50 ± 5 grains of water/pound 
of dry air. 
(2) Ambient air temperature within 
the test cell during all phases of the test 
sequence shall be controlled to 75 ± 
2 °F on average and 75 ± 5 °F as an 
instantaneous measurement. Air 
temperature shall be recorded

continuously at a minimum of 30 
second intervals. 
(d) Test sequence. 
(1) Connect the vehicle exhaust 
system to the raw sampling location or 
dilution stage according to the 
provisions of this subpart. For dilution 
systems, dilute the exhaust as described 
in this subpart. Continuous sampling 
systems must meet the specifications 
provided in this subpart. 
(2) Test the vehicle in a fully warmed- 
up condition. If the vehicle has soaked 
for two hours or less since the last 
exhaust test element, preconditioning 
may consist of a 505 Cycle, 866 Cycle, 
US06, or SC03, as these terms are 
defined in § 86.1803–01, or a highway 
fuel economy test procedure, as defined 
in § 600.002–08 of this chapter. For 
longer soak periods, precondition the 
vehicle using one full Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Schedule. Ensure 
that the vehicle has stabilized at test cell 
ambient conditions such that the 
vehicle interior temperature is not 
substantially different from the external 
test cell temperature. Windows may be 
opened during preconditioning to 
achieve this stabilization. 
(3) Immediately after the 
preconditioning, turn off any cooling 
fans, if present, close the vehicle’s hood, 
fully close all the vehicle’s windows, 
ensure that all the vehicle’s air 
conditioning systems are set to full off, 
start the CO2 sampling system, and then 
idle the vehicle for not less than 1 
minute and not more than 5 minutes to 
achieve normal and stable idle 
operation. 
(4) Measure and record the 
continuous CO2 concentration for 600 
seconds. Measure the CO2 concentration 
continuously using raw or dilute 
sampling procedures. Multiply this 
concentration by the continuous (raw or 
dilute) flow rate at the emission 
sampling location to determine the CO2 
flow rate. Calculate the CO2 cumulative 
flow rate continuously over the test 
interval. This cumulative value is the 
total mass of the emitted CO2. 
(5) Within 60 seconds after 
completing the measurement described 
in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, turn 
on the vehicle’s air conditioning system. 
Set automatic air conditioning systems 
to a temperature 9 °F (5 °C) below the 
ambient temperature of the test cell. Set 
manual air conditioning systems to 
maximum cooling with recirculation 
turned off, except that recirculation 
shall be enabled if the air conditioning 
system automatically defaults to a 
recirculation mode when set to 
maximum cooling. Continue idling the 
vehicle while measuring and recording 
the continuous CO2 concentration for 
600 seconds as described in paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section. Air conditioning 
systems with automatic temperature 
controls are finished with the test. 
Manually controlled air conditioning 
systems must complete one additional 
idle period described in paragraph (d)(6) 
of this section. 
(6) This paragraph (d)(6) applies only 
to manually controlled air conditioning 
systems. Within 60 seconds after 
completing the measurement described 
in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, leave 
the vehicle’s air conditioning system on 
and set as described in paragraph (d)(5) 
of this section but set the fan speed to 
the lowest setting that continues to 
provide air flow. Recirculation shall be 
turned off except that if the system 
defaults to a recirculation mode when 
set to maximum cooling and maintains 
recirculation with the low fan speed, 
then recirculation shall continue to be 
enabled. After the fan speed has been 
set, continue idling the vehicle while 
measuring and recording the continuous 
CO2 concentration for a total of 600 
seconds as described in paragraph (d)(4) 
of this section. 
(e) Calculations. (1) For the 
measurement with no air conditioning, 
calculate the CO2 emissions (in grams 
per minute) by dividing the total mass 
of CO2 from paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section by 10.0 (the duration in minutes 
for which CO2 is measured). Round this 
result to the nearest whole gram per 
minute. 
(2)(i) For the measurement with air 
conditioning in operation for automatic 
air conditioning systems, calculate the 
CO2 emissions (in grams per minute) by 
dividing the total mass of CO2 from 
paragraph (d)(5) of this section by 10.0. 
Round this result to the nearest whole 
gram per minute. 
(ii) For the measurement with air 
conditioning in operation for manually 
controlled air conditioning systems, 
calculate the CO2 emissions (in grams 
per minute) by summing the total mass 
of CO2 from paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) 
of this section and dividing by 20.0. 
Round this result to the nearest whole 
gram per minute. 
(3) Calculate the increased CO2 
emissions due to air conditioning (in 
grams per minute) by subtracting the 
results of paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
from the results of paragraph (e)(2)(i) or 
(ii) of this section, whichever is 
applicable. 
7. A new § 86.166–12 is added to 
subpart B to read as follows: 
§ 86.166–12 Method for calculating 
emissions due to air conditioning leakage. 
This section describes procedures 
used to determine a refrigerant leakage 
rate from vehicle-based air conditioning 
units. The results of this test are used to 
determine air conditioning leakage 
credits according to § 86.1866–12(b). 
(a) Emission totals. Calculate an 
annual rate of refrigerant leakage from 
an air conditioning system using the 
following equation: 
Grams/YRTOT = Grams/YRRP + Grams/ 
YRSP + Grams/YRFH + Grams/YRMC + 
Grams/YRC ¥ Grams/YRCREDIT 
Where: 
Grams/YRTOT = Total air conditioning system 
emission rate in grams per year and 
rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram 
per year. 
Grams/YRRP = Emission rate for rigid pipe 
connections as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section. 
Grams/YRSP = Emission rate for service ports 
and refrigerant control devices as 
described in paragraph (c) of this section. 
Grams/YRFH = Emission rate for flexible 
hoses as described in paragraph (d) of 
this section. 
Grams/YRMC = Emission rate for heat 
exchangers, mufflers, receiver/driers, 
and accumulators as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section. 
Grams/YRC = Emission rate for compressors 
as described in paragraph (f) of this 
section. 
Grams/YRCREDIT = Leakage monitoring credit, 
as applicable, from paragraph (g) of this 
section. 
(b) Fittings. Determine the grams per 
year emission rate for rigid pipe 
connections using the following 
equation: 
Grams/YRRP = 0.00522 · [(125 · SO) + 
(75 · SCO) + (50 · MO) + (10 · SW) 
+ (5 · SWO) + (MG)] 
Where: 
Grams/YRRP = Total emission rate for rigid 
pipe connections in grams per year. 
SO = The number of single O-ring 
connections. 
SCO = The number of single captured O-ring 
connections. 
MO = The number of multiple O-ring 
connections. 
SW = The number of seal washer 
connections. 
SWO = The number of seal washer with O- 
ring connections. 
MG = The number of metal gasket 
connections. 
(c) Service ports and refrigerant 
control devices. Determine the grams 
per year emission rate for service ports 
and refrigerant control devices using the 
following equation: 
Grams/YRSP = (0.3 · HSSP · 0.522) + (0.2 
· LSSP · 0.522) + (0.2 · STV · 0.522) 
+ (0.2 · TXV · 0.522) 
Where: 
Grams/YRSP = The emission rate for service 
ports and refrigerant control devices, in 
grams per year. 
HSSP = The number of high side service 
ports.

(f) Compressors. Determine the 
emission rate for compressors using the 
following equation, except that the final 
term in the equation (‘‘1500/SSL’’) is not 
applicable to electric (or semi-hermetic) 
compressors: 
Grams/YRC = 0.00522 · [(300 · OHS) + 
(200 · MHS) + (150 · FAP) + (100

to the operator through an interior 
driver information display or an air 
conditioning-specific malfunction 
indicator when the air conditioning 
system has lost 40 percent of its charge

(h) Definitions. The following 
definitions apply to this section: 
(1) All rubber hose means a Type A 
or Type B hose as defined by SAE J2064 
with a permeation rate not greater than 
15 kg/m2/year when tested according to 
SAE J2064. SAE J2064 is incorporated

(2) Standard barrier or veneer hose 
means a Type C, D, E, or F hose as 
defined by SAE J2064 with a permeation 
rate not greater than 5 kg/m2/year when

J2064 is incorporated by reference; see 
§ 86.1. 
(3) Ultra-low permeation barrier or 
veneer hose means a hose with a 
permeation rate not greater than 1.5 kg/ 
m2/year when tested according to SAE 
J2064. SAE J2064 is incorporated by 
reference; see § 86.1. 
8. A new § 86.167–12 is added to 
subpart B to read as follows: 
§ 86.167–12 N2O measurement devices. 
(a) General component requirements. 
We recommend that you use an analyzer 
that meets the specifications in Table 1 
of 40 CFR 1065.205. Note that your 
system must meet the linearity 
verification in 40 CFR 1065.307. 
(b) Instrument types. You may use any 
of the following analyzers to measure 
N2O: 
(1) Nondispersive infra-red (NDIR) 
analyzer. You may use an NDIR 
analyzer that has compensation 
algorithms that are functions of other 
gaseous measurements and the engine’s 
known or assumed fuel properties. The 
target value for any compensation 
algorithm is 0.0% (that is, no bias high 
and no bias low), regardless of the 
uncompensated signal’s bias. 
(2) Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) 
analyzer. You may use an FTIR analyzer 
that has compensation algorithms that 
are functions of other gaseous 
measurements and the engine’s known 
or assumed fuel properties. The target 
value for any compensation algorithm is 
0.0% (that is, no bias high and no bias 
low), regardless of the uncompensated 
signal’s bias. Use EPA Test Method 320 
‘‘Measurement of Vapor Phase Organic 
and Inorganic Emissions by Extractive 
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) 
Spectroscopy’’ for spectral 
interpretation (see 40 CFR part 63 
appendix A). 
(3) Photoacoustic analyzer. You may 
use a photoacoustic analyzer that has 
compensation algorithms that are 
functions of other gaseous 
measurements. The target value for any 
compensation algorithm is 0.0% (that is, 
no bias high and no bias low), regardless 
of the uncompensated signal’s bias. Use 
an optical wheel configuration that 
gives analytical priority to measurement 
of the least stable components in the 
sample. Select a sample integration time 
of at least 5 seconds. Take into account 
sample chamber and sample line 
volumes when determining flush times 
for your instrument. 
(4) Gas chromatograph (GC) analyzer. 
You may use a gas chromatograph with 
Electron Capture Detector (ECD) to 
measure N2O concentrations of diluted 
exhaust for batch sampling. You may 
use a packed or porous layer open 
tubular (PLOT) column phase of 
suitable polarity and length to achieve 
adequate resolution of the N2O peak for 
analysis. Examples of acceptable 
columns are a PLOT column consisting 
of bonded polystyrene-divinylbenzene 
or a Porapack Q packed column. Take 
the column temperature profile and 
carrier gas selection into consideration 
when setting up your method to achieve 
adequate N2O peak resolution. 
(c) Interference validation. Perform 
interference validation for NDIR, FTIR, 
and Photoacoustic analyzers using the 
procedures of § 86.168–12 as follows: 
(1) Certain interference gases can 
positively interfere with these analyzers 
by causing a response similar to N2O as 
follows: 
(i) The interference gases for NDIR 
analyzers are CO, CO2, H2O, CH4 and 
SO2. Note that interference species, with 
the exception of H2O, are dependent on 
the N2O infrared absorption band 
chosen by the instrument manufacturer 
and should be determined 
independently for each analyzer. 
(ii) Use good engineering judgment to 
determine interference gases for FTIR. 
Note that interference species, with the 
exception of H2O, are dependent on the 
N2O infrared absorption band chosen by 
the instrument manufacturer and should 
be determined independently for each 
analyzer. 
(iii) The interference gases for 
photoacoustic analyzers are CO, CO2, 
and H2O.

(2) Analyzers must have combined 
interference that is within (0.0 ± 1.0) 
mol/mol. We strongly recommend a 
lower interference that is within (0.0 ± 
0.5) mol/. 
9. A new § 86.168–12 is added to 
subpart B to read as follows: 
§ 86.168–12 Interference verification for 
N2O analyzers. 
(a) Scope and frequency. See 40 CFR 
1065.275 to determine whether you 
need to verify the amount of 
interference after initial analyzer 
installation and after major 
maintenance. 
(b) Measurement principles. 
Interference gasses can positively 
interfere with certain analyzers by 
causing a response similar to N2O. If the 
analyzer uses compensation algorithms 
that utilize measurements of other gases 
to meet this interference verification, 
simultaneously conduct these other 
measurements to test the compensation 
algorithms during the analyzer 
interference verification. 
(c) System requirements. See 40 CFR 
1065.275 for system requirements 
related to allowable interference levels. 
(d) Procedure. Perform the 
interference verification as follows: 
(1) Start, operate, zero, and span the 
N2O FTIR analyzer as you would before 
an emission test. If the sample is passed 
through a dryer during emission testing, 
you may run this verification test with 
the dryer if it meets the requirements of 
40 CFR 1065.342. Operate the dryer at 
the same conditions as you will for an 
emission test. You may also run this 
verification test without the sample 
dryer. 
(2) Create a humidified test gas by 
bubbling a multi component span gas 
that incorporates the target interference 
species and meets the specifications in 
40 CFR 1065.750 through distilled water 
in a sealed vessel. If the sample is not 
passed through a dryer during emission 
testing, control the vessel temperature to 
generate an H2O level at least as high as 
the maximum expected during emission 
testing. If the sample is passed through 
a dryer during emission testing, control 
the vessel temperature to generate an 
H2O level at least as high as the level 
determined in 40 CFR 1065.145(e)(2) for 
that dryer. Use interference span gas 
concentrations that are at least as high 
as the maximum expected during 
testing. 
(3) Introduce the humidified 
interference test gas into the sample 
system. You may introduce it 
downstream of any sample dryer, if one 
is used during testing. 
(4) If the sample is not passed through 
a dryer during this verification test, 
measure the water mole fraction, xH2O, 
of the humidified interference test gas as 
close as possible to the inlet of the 
analyzer. For example, measure 
dewpoint, Tdew, and absolute pressure, 
ptotal, to calculate xH2O. Verify that the 
water content meets the requirement in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the 
sample is passed through a dryer during 
this verification test, you must verify 
that the water content of the humidified 
test gas downstream of the vessel meets 
the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section based on either direct 
measurement of the water content (e.g., 
dewpoint and pressure) or an estimate 
based on the vessel pressure and 
temperature. Use good engineering 
judgment to estimate the water content. 
For example, you may use previous 
direct measurements of water content to 
verify the vessel’s level of saturation. 
(5) If a sample dryer is not used in this 
verification test, use good engineering 
judgment to prevent condensation in the 
transfer lines, fittings, or valves from the 
point where xH2O is measured to the 
analyzer. We recommend that you 
design your system so that the wall 
temperatures in the transfer lines, 
fittings, and valves from the point where 
xH2O is measured to the analyzer are at 
least 5 °C above the local sample gas 
dewpoint. 
(6) Allow time for the analyzer 
response to stabilize. Stabilization time 
may include time to purge the transfer 
line and to account for analyzer 
response. 
(7) While the analyzer measures the 
sample’s concentration, record its 
output for 30 seconds. Calculate the 
arithmetic mean of this data. 
(8) The analyzer meets the 
interference verification if the result of 
paragraph (d)(7) of this section meets 
the tolerance in 40 CFR 1065.275. 
(9) You may also run interference 
procedures separately for individual 
interference gases. If the interference gas 
levels used are higher than the 
maximum levels expected during 
testing, you may scale down each 
observed interference value by 
multiplying the observed interference 
by the ratio of the maximum expected 
concentration value to the actual value 
used during this procedure. You may 
run separate interference concentrations 
of H2O (down to 0.025 mol/mol H2O 
content) that are lower than the 
maximum levels expected during 
testing, but you must scale up the 
observed H2O interference by 
multiplying the observed interference 
by the ratio of the maximum expected 
H2O concentration value to the actual 
value used during this procedure. The 
sum of the scaled interference values 
must meet the tolerance specified in 40 
CFR 1065.275. 
Subpart S—[Amended] 
10. A new § 86.1801–12 is added to

§ 86.1805–12 Useful life. 
(a) Except as permitted under 
paragraph (b) of this section or required 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, the full useful life for all LDVs 
and LLDTs is a period of use of 10 years 
or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first. 
The full useful life for all HLDTs, 
MDPVs, and complete heavy-duty 
vehicles is a period of 11 years or 
120,000 miles, whichever occurs first. 
These full useful life values apply to all 
exhaust, evaporative and refueling 
emission requirements except for 
standards which are specified to only be 
applicable at the time of certification. 
These full useful life requirements also 
apply to all air conditioning leakage 
credits, air conditioning efficiency

by the manufacturer to comply with 
fleet average CO2 emission standards. 
(b) Manufacturers may elect to 
optionally certify a test group to the Tier 
2 exhaust emission standards for 
150,000 miles to gain additional NOX 
credits, as permitted in § 86.1860–04(g), 
or to opt out of intermediate life 
standards as permitted in § 86.1811– 
04(c). In such cases, useful life is a 
period of use of 15 years or 150,000 
miles, whichever occurs first, for all 
exhaust, evaporative and refueling 
emission requirements except for cold 
CO standards and standards which are 
applicable only at the time of 
certification. 
(c) Where intermediate useful life 
exhaust emission standards are 
applicable, such standards are

manufacturer must submit, with the Part 
II certification application, an 
engineering evaluation demonstrating to 
the satisfaction of the Administrator that 
a discontinuity in emissions of non- 
methane organic gases, carbon 
monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of 
nitrogen and formaldehyde measured on 
the Federal Test Procedure (subpart B of 
this part) does not occur in the 
temperature range of 20 to 86 °F. For 
diesel vehicles, the engineering 
evaluation must also include particulate 
emissions. 
15. Section 86.1810–09 is amended by 
revising paragraph (f) to read as follows:

cold temperature NMHC standards 
described in § 86.1811–10(g) and the 
CO2, N2O, and CH4 exhaust emission 
standards described in § 86.1818–12, 
manufacturers must submit an 
engineering evaluation indicating that 
common calibration approaches are 
utilized at high altitudes. Any deviation 
from low altitude emission control 
practices must be included in the 
auxiliary emission control device 
(AECD) descriptions submitted at 
certification. Any AECD specific to high 
altitude must require engineering 
emission data for EPA evaluation to 
quantify any emission impact and 
validity of the AECD. 
* * * * * 
16. A new § 86.1818–12 is added to 
read as follows:

carbon-related exhaust emission value 
calculated according to the provisions of 
40 CFR 600.208–08 (except that total 
model year production data shall be 
used instead of sales projections) 
multiplied by 1.1 and rounded to the 
nearest whole gram per mile. These 
standards apply to in-use testing 
performed by the manufacturer 
pursuant to regulations at § 86.1845–04 
and 86.1846–01 and to in-use testing 
performed by EPA. For any model type

standard shall be the CO2-equivalent 
value submitted at certification 
according to the provisions of § 86.1841 
multiplied by 1.1 and rounded to the 
nearest whole gram per mile. 
(e) Optional interim fleet average CO2 
standards for qualifying manufacturers. 
(1) The interim fleet average CO2 
standards in this paragraph (e) are 
optionally applicable to each qualifying 
manufacturer as follows: 
(i) A qualifying manufacturer is a 
manufacturer with sales of 2009 model 
year combined passenger automobiles 
and light trucks in the United States of 
less than 400,000 vehicles, except that 
manufacturers with no U.S. sales in the 
2009 model year do not qualify for the 
optional interim standards. 
(ii) For the purposes of making the 
determination in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of 
this section, ‘‘manufacturer’’ shall mean 
that term as defined at 49 CFR 531.4 and 
as that definition was applied to the 
2009 model year for the purpose of 
determining compliance with the 2009 
corporate average fuel economy 
standards at 49 CFR parts 531 and 533. 
(iii) Only 2012 through 2015 model 
year passenger automobiles and light 
trucks are eligible for these standards. 
All model year 2016 and later passenger 
automobiles and light trucks are subject 
to the fleet average standards described 
in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(iv) A qualifying manufacturer may 
select any combination of 2012 through 
2015 model year passenger automobiles 
and/or light trucks to comply with these 
optional standards up to a cumulative 
total of 100,000 vehicles. Vehicles 
selected to comply with these standards 
shall not be included in the calculations 
of the manufacturer’s fleet average 
standards under paragraph (c) of this 
section. 
(v) A qualifying manufacturer may not 
use these optional interim fleet average 
CO2 standards until they have used all 
available banked CO2 credits and/or CO2 
credits available for transfer. A 
qualifying manufacturer with a net 
positive credit balance in any model 
year after considering all available 
credits generated, carried forward from 
a prior model year, transferred from 
other averaging sets, or obtained from 
other manufacturers, may not use these 
optional interim fleet average CO2 
standards in such model year. 
(2) To calculate an optional interim 
fleet average CO2 standard, qualifying 
manufacturers shall determine the fleet 
average standard separately for the 
passenger automobiles and light trucks 
selected by the manufacturer to be 
subject to the interim fleet average CO2 
standard, subject to the limitations 
expressed in paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and 
(iv) of this section. 
(i) The interim fleet average CO2 
standard applicable to qualified 
passenger automobiles shall be the 
standard calculated using the provisions 
of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for 
the appropriate model year multiplied 
by 1.25 and rounded to the nearest 
whole gram per mile. For the purposes 
of applying paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section to determine the standard, the 
passenger automobile fleet shall be 
limited to those passenger automobiles 
subject to the interim fleet average CO2 
standard. 
(ii) The interim fleet average CO2 
standard applicable to qualified light 
trucks shall be the standard calculated 
using the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section for the 
appropriate model year multiplied by 
1.25 and rounded to the nearest whole 
gram per mile. For the purposes of 
applying paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this 
section to determine the standard, the 
light truck fleet shall be limited to those 
light trucks subject to the interim fleet 
average CO2 standard. 
(3) Manufacturers choosing to 
optionally apply these standards are 
subject to the restrictions on credit 
banking and trading specified in 
§ 86.1865–12. 
(f) N2O standards for light-duty 
vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium- 
duty passenger vehicles. Exhaust 
emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) shall 
not exceed 0.010 grams per mile at full 
useful life, as measured according to the 
Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described 
in subpart B of this part. 
(g) Methane standards for light-duty 
vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium- 
duty passenger vehicles. Exhaust 
emissions of methane (CH4) shall not 
exceed 0.030 grams per mile at full 
useful life, as measured according to the 
Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described 
in subpart B of this part. 
17. Section 86.1823–08 is amended by 
adding paragraph (m) to read as follows: 
§ 86.1823–08 Durability demonstration 
procedures for exhaust emissions. 
* * * * * 
(m) Durability demonstration 
procedures for vehicles subject to the 
greenhouse gas exhaust emission 
standards specified in 86.1818–12. 
(1) CO2. (i) Unless otherwise specified 
under paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this 
section, manufacturers may use a 
multiplicative CO2 deterioration factor 
of one or an additive deterioration factor 
of zero. 
(ii) Based on an analysis of industry- 
wide data, EPA may periodically 
establish and/or update the 
deterioration factor for CO2 emissions 
including air conditioning and other 
credit related emissions. Deterioration 
factors established and/or updated 
under this paragraph (m)(1)(ii) will 
provide adequate lead time for 
manufacturers to plan for the change. 
(iii) Alternatively, manufacturers may 
use the whole-vehicle mileage 
accumulation procedures in § 86.1823– 
08 paragraphs (c) or (d)(1) to determine 
CO2 deterioration factors. In this case, 
each FTP test performed on the 
durability data vehicle selected under 
§ 86.1822–01 of this part must also be 
accompanied by an HFET test, and 
combined FTP/HFET CO2 results 
determined by averaging the city (FTP) 
and highway (HFET) CO2 values, 
weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively. 
The deterioration factor will be 
determined for this combined CO2 
value. Calculated multiplicative 
deterioration factors that are less than 
one shall be set to equal one, and 
calculated additive deterioration factors 
that are less than zero shall be set to 
zero. 
(iv) If, in the good engineering 
judgment of the manufacturer, the 
deterioration factors determined 
according to paragraphs (m)(1)(i), 
(m)(1)(ii), or (m)(1)(iii) of this section do 
not adequately account for the expected 
CO2 emission deterioration over the 
vehicle’s useful life, the manufacturer 
may petition EPA to request a more 
appropriate deterioration factor. 
(2) N2O and CH4. Deterioration factors 
for N2O and CH4 shall be determined 
according to the provisions of 
§ 86.1823–08. 
(3) Air Conditioning leakage and 
efficiency or other emission credit 
requirements to comply with exhaust 
CO2 standards. Manufactures will attest 
to the durability of components and 
systems used to meet the CO2 standards. 
Manufacturers may submit engineering 
data to provide durability 
demonstration.

that meets the specified criteria. The 
testing requirements apply separately 
for each model year starting with model 
year 2001. These provisions do not 
apply to heavy-duty vehicles or heavy- 
duty engines prior to the 2007 model 
year. These provisions do not apply to 
emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. 
* * * * * 
(b) Criteria for additional testing. A 
manufacturer shall test a test group or 
a subset of a test group as described in 
paragraph (j) of this section when the 
results from testing conducted under 
§§ 86.1845–01 and 86.1845–04, as 
applicable, show mean emissions for 
that test group of any pollutant(s) 
(except CO2, CH4, and N2O) to be equal 
to or greater than 1.30 times the 
applicable in-use standard and a failure 
rate, among the test group vehicles, for 
the corresponding pollutant(s) of fifty 
percent or greater. 
* * * * * 
24. Section 86.1848–10 is amended by 
adding paragraph (c)(9) to read as 
follows: 
§ 86.1848–10 Certification. 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
(9) For 2012 and later model year 
LDVs, LDTs, and MDPVs, all certificates 
of conformity issued are conditional 
upon compliance with all provisions of 
§§ 86.1818–12 and 86.1865–12 both 
during and after model year production. 
The manufacturer bears the burden of 
establishing to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the terms and 
conditions upon which the certificate(s) 
was (were) issued were satisfied. For 
recall and warranty purposes, vehicles 
not covered by a certificate of 
conformity will continue to be held to 
the standards stated or referenced in the 
certificate that otherwise would have 
applied to the vehicles. 
(i) Failure to meet the fleet average 
CO2 requirements will be considered a 
failure to satisfy the terms and 
conditions upon which the certificate(s) 
was (were) issued and the vehicles sold 
in violation of the fleet average CO2 
standard will not be covered by the 
certificate(s). The vehicles sold in 
violation will be determined according 
to § 86.1865–12(k)(7). 
(ii) Failure to comply fully with the 
prohibition against selling credits that 
are not generated or that are not 
available, as specified in § 86.1865–12, 
will be considered a failure to satisfy the 
terms and conditions upon which the

average CO2 standards. 
(a) Applicability. (1) Unless otherwise 
exempted under the provisions of 
§ 86.1801–12(j), CO2 fleet average 
exhaust emission standards apply to: 
(i) 2012 and later model year 
passenger automobiles and light trucks. 
(ii) Aftermarket conversion systems as 
defined in 40 CFR 85.502. 
(iii) Vehicles imported by ICIs as 
defined in 40 CFR 85.1502. 
(2) The terms ‘‘passenger automobile’’ 
and ‘‘light truck’’ as used in this section 
have the meanings as defined in 
§ 86.1818–12. 
(b) Useful life requirements. Full 
useful life requirements for CO2 
standards are defined in § 86.1818–12. 
There is not an intermediate useful life 
standard for CO2 standards. 
(c) Altitude. Altitude requirements for 
CO2 standards are provided in 
§ 86.1810–12(f). 
(d) Small volume manufacturer 
certification procedures. Certification 
procedures for small volume 
manufacturers are provided in 
§ 86.1838–01. Small businesses meeting 
certain criteria may be exempted from 
the fleet average CO2 standards under 
§ 86.1801–12(j). 
(e) CO2 fleet average exhaust emission 
standards. The fleet average standards 
referred to in this section are the 
corporate fleet average CO2 standards 
for passenger automobiles and light 
trucks set forth in 86.1818–12(c) and (e). 
The fleet average CO2 standards 
applicable in a given model year are 
calculated separately for passenger 
automobiles and light trucks for each 
manufacturer and each model year 
according to the provisions in 
§ 86.1818–12. Each manufacturer must 
comply with the applicable CO2 fleet 
average standard on a production- 
weighted average basis, for each 
separate averaging set, at the end of each 
model year, using the procedure 
described in paragraph (c) of this 
section. 
(f) In-use CO2 standards. In-use CO2 
exhaust emission standards applicable 
to each model type are provided in 
§ 86.1818–12(d). 
(g) Durability procedures and method 
of determining deterioration factors 
(DFs). Deterioration factors for CO2 
exhaust emission standards are 
provided in § 86.1823–08(m). 
(h) Vehicle test procedures. (1) The 
test procedures for demonstrating 
compliance with CO2 exhaust emission 
standards are contained in subpart B of 
this part and subpart B of part 600 of 
this chapter. 
(2) Testing of all passenger 
automobiles and light trucks to 
determine compliance with CO2 exhaust 
emission standards set forth in this 
section must be on a loaded vehicle 
weight (LVW) basis, as defined in 
§ 86.1803–01. 
(3) Testing for the purpose of 
providing certification data is required 
only at low altitude conditions. If 
hardware and software emission control 
strategies used during low altitude 
condition testing are not used similarly 
across all altitudes for in-use operation, 
the manufacturer must include a 
statement in the application for 
certification, in accordance with 
§§ 86.1844–01(d)(11) and 86.1810–12(f), 
stating what the different strategies are 
and why they are used. 
(i) Calculating the fleet average 
carbon-related exhaust emissions. (1) 
Manufacturers must compute separate 
production-weighted fleet average 
carbon-related exhaust emissions at the 
end of the model year for passenger 
automobiles and light trucks, using 
actual production, where production 
means vehicles produced and delivered 
for sale, and certifying model types to 
standards as defined in § 86.1818–12. 
The model type carbon-related exhaust 
emission results determined according 
to 40 CFR 600 subpart F become the 
certification standard for each model 
type. 
(2) Manufacturers must separately 
calculate production-weighted fleet 
average carbon-related exhaust 
emissions levels for the following 
averaging sets according to the 
provisions of part 600 subpart F of this 
chapter:

be considered not covered by the 
certificate of conformity (see paragraph 
(k)(7) of this section). A manufacturer 
will be subject to penalties on an 
individual-vehicle basis for sale of 
vehicles not covered by a certificate. 
(iv) EPA will review each 
manufacturer’s production to designate 
the vehicles that caused the exceedence 
of the corporate average standard. EPA 
will designate as nonconforming those 
vehicles in test groups with the highest 
certification emission values first, 
continuing until reaching a number of 
vehicles equal to the calculated number 
of noncomplying vehicles as determined 
in paragraph (k)(7) of this section. In a 
group where only a portion of vehicles 
would be deemed nonconforming, EPA 
will determine the actual 
nonconforming vehicles by counting 
backwards from the last vehicle 
produced in that test group. 
Manufacturers will be liable for 
penalties for each vehicle sold that is 
not covered by a certificate. 
(k) Requirements for the CO2 
averaging, banking and trading (ABT) 
program. (1) A manufacturer whose CO2 
fleet average emissions exceed the 
applicable standard must complete the 
calculation in paragraph (k)(4) of this 
section to determine the size of its CO2 
deficit. A manufacturer whose CO2 fleet 
average emissions are less than the 
applicable standard must complete the 
calculation in paragraph (k)(4) of this 
section to generate CO2 credits. In either 
case, the number of credits or debits 
must be rounded to the nearest whole 
number. 
(2) There are no property rights 
associated with CO2 credits generated 
under this subpart. Credits are a limited 
authorization to emit the designated 
amount of emissions. Nothing in this 
part or any other provision of law 
should be construed to limit EPA’s 
authority to terminate or limit this 
authorization through a rulemaking. 
(3) Each manufacturer must comply 
with the reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements of paragraph (l) of this 
section for CO2 credits, including early 
credits. The averaging, banking and 
trading program is enforceable through 
the certificate of conformity that allows 
the manufacturer to introduce any 
regulated vehicles into commerce. 
(4) Credits are earned on the last day 
of the model year. Manufacturers must 
calculate, for a given model year, the 
number of credits or debits it has 
generated according to the following 
equation, rounded to the nearest 
megagram: 
CO2 Credits or Debits (Mg) = [(CO2 
Standard—Manufacturer’s 
Production-Weighted Fleet Average 
CO2 Emissions) × (Total Number of 
Vehicles Produced) × (Vehicle 
Lifetime Miles)] ÷ 1,000,000 
Where: 
CO2 Standard = the applicable standard for 
the model year as determined by 
§ 86.1818–12; 
Manufacturer’s Production-Weighted Fleet 
Average CO2 Emissions = average 
calculated according to paragraph (i) of 
this section; 
Total Number of Vehicles Produced = The 
number of vehicles domestically 
produced plus those imported as defined 
in 40 CFR 600.511–80; and 
Vehicle Lifetime Miles is 190,971 for 
passenger automobiles and 221,199 for 
light trucks. 
(5) Total credits or debits generated in 
a model year, maintained and reported 
separately for passenger automobiles 
and light trucks, shall be the sum of the 
credits or debits calculated in paragraph 
(k)(4) of this section and any of the 
following credits, if applicable: 
(i) Air conditioning leakage credits 
earned according to the provisions of 
86.1866–12(b); 
(ii) Air conditioning efficiency credits 
earned according to the provisions of 
86.1866–12(c); 
(iii) Off-cycle technology credits 
earned according to the provisions of 
86.1866–12(d). 
(6) Unused CO2 credits shall retain 
their full value through the five 
subsequent model years after the model 
year in which they were generated. 
Credits available at the end of the fifth 
model year after the year in which they 
were generated shall expire. 
(7) Credits may be used as follows: 
(i) Credits generated and calculated 
according to the method in paragraph 
(k)(4) of this section may not be used to 
offset deficits other than those deficits 
accrued with respect to the standard in 
§ 86.1818–12. Credits may be banked 
and used in a future model year in 
which a manufacturer’s average CO2 
level exceeds the applicable standard. 
Credits may be exchanged between the 
passenger automobile and light truck 
fleets of a given manufacturer. Credits 
may also be traded to another 
manufacturer according to the 
provisions in paragraph (k)(8) of this 
section. Before trading or carrying over 
credits to the next model year, a 
manufacturer must apply available 
credits to offset any deficit, where the 
deadline to offset that credit deficit has 
not yet passed. 
(ii) The use of credits shall not change 
Selective Enforcement Auditing or in- 
use testing failures from a failure to a 
non-failure. The enforcement of the 
averaging standard occurs through the 
vehicle’s certificate of conformity. A 
manufacturer’s certificate of conformity 
is conditioned upon compliance with 
the averaging provisions. The certificate 
will be void ab initio if a manufacturer

fails to meet the corporate average 
standard and does not obtain 
appropriate credits to cover its shortfalls 
in that model year or subsequent model 
years (see deficit carry-forward 
provisions in paragraph (k)(7) of this 
section). Manufacturers must track their 
certification levels and production 
unless they produce only vehicles 
certified to CO2 levels below the 
standard and do not plan to bank 
credits. 
(iii) Special provisions for 
manufacturers using the optional 
interim fleet average CO2 standards. (A) 
Credits generated by vehicles subject to 
the fleet average CO2 standards 
specified in § 86.1818–12(c) may only 
be used to offset a deficit generated by 
vehicles subject to the optional interim 
fleet average CO2 standards specified in 
§ 86.1818–12(e). 
(B) Credits generated by a passenger 
automobile or light truck averaging set 
subject to the optional interim fleet 
average CO2 standards specified in 
§ 86.1818–12(e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this 
section may be used to offset a deficit 
generated by an averaging set subject to 
the optional interim fleet average CO2 
standards through the 2015 model year. 
(C) Credits generated by an averaging 
set subject to the optional interim fleet 
average CO2 standards specified in 
§ 86.1818–12(e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this 
section may not be used to offset a 
deficit generated by an averaging set 
subject to the fleet average CO2 
standards specified in § 86.1818– 
12(c)(2) or (3) or otherwise transferred to 
an averaging set subject to the fleet 
average CO2 standards specified in 
§ 86.1818–12(c)(2) or (3). 
(D) Credits generated by vehicles 
subject to the optional interim fleet 
average CO2 standards specified in 
§ 86.1818–12(e)(2)(i) or (ii) may be 
banked for use in a future model year, 
except that all such credits shall expire 
at the end of the 2015 model year. 
(E) A manufacturer with any vehicles 
subject to the optional interim fleet 
average CO2 standards specified in 
§ 86.1818–12(e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this 
section in a model year in which that 
manufacturer also generates credits with 
vehicles subject to the fleet average CO2 
standards specified in § 86.1818–12(c) 
may not trade those credits or bank 
those credits earned against the fleet 
average standards in § 86.1818–12(c) for 
use in a future model year. 
(8) The following provisions apply if 
debits are accrued: 
(i) If a manufacturer calculates that it 
has negative credits (also called 
‘‘debits’’ or a ‘‘credit deficit’’) for a given 
model year, it may carry that deficit 
forward into the next three model years. 
Such a carry-forward may only occur 
after the manufacturer exhausts any 
supply of banked credits. At the end of 
the third model year, the deficit must be 
covered with an appropriate number of 
credits that the manufacturer generates 
or purchases. Any remaining deficit is 
subject to a voiding of the certificate ab 
initio, as described in this paragraph 
(k)(8). Manufacturers are not permitted 
to have a credit deficit for four 
consecutive years. 
(ii) If debits are not offset within the 
specified time period, the number of 
vehicles not meeting the fleet average 
CO2 standards (and therefore not 
covered by the certificate) must be 
calculated. 
(A) Determine the gram per mile 
quantity of debits for the noncompliant 
vehicle category by multiplying the total 
megagram deficit by 1,000,000 and then 
dividing by the vehicle lifetime miles 
for the vehicle category (passenger 
automobile or light truck) specified in 
paragraph (k)(4) of this section. 
(B) Divide the result by the fleet 
average standard applicable to the 
model year in which the deficit failed to 
be offset and round to the nearest whole 
number to determine the number of 
vehicles not meeting the fleet average 
CO2 standards. 
(iii) EPA will determine the vehicles 
not covered by a certificate because the 
condition on the certificate was not 
satisfied by designating vehicles in 
those test groups with the highest CO2 
emission values first and continuing 
until reaching a number of vehicles 
equal to the calculated number of 
noncomplying vehicles as determined 
in paragraph (k)(7) of this section. If this 
calculation determines that only a 
portion of vehicles in a test group 
contribute to the debit situation, then 
EPA will designate actual vehicles in 
that test group as not covered by the 
certificate, starting with the last vehicle 
produced and counting backwards. 
(iv)(A) If a manufacturer ceases 
production of passenger cars and light 
trucks, the manufacturer continues to be 
responsible for offsetting any debits 
outstanding within the required time 
period. Any failure to offset the debits 
will be considered a violation of 
paragraph (k)(7)(i) of this section and 
may subject the manufacturer to an 
enforcement action for sale of vehicles 
not covered by a certificate, pursuant to 
paragraphs (k)(7)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section. 
(B) If a manufacturer is purchased by, 
merges with, or otherwise combines 
with another manufacturer, the 
controlling entity is responsible for 
offsetting any debits outstanding within 
the required time period. Any failure to 
offset the debits will be considered a 
violation of paragraph (k)(7)(i) of this 
section and may subject the 
manufacturer to an enforcement action 
for sale of vehicles not covered by a 
certificate, pursuant to paragraphs 
(k)(7)(ii) and (iii) of this section. 
(v) For purposes of calculating the 
statute of limitations, a violation of the 
requirements of paragraph (k)(7)(i) of 
this section, a failure to satisfy the 
conditions upon which a certificate(s) 
was issued and hence a sale of vehicles 
not covered by the certificate, all occur 
upon the expiration of the deadline for 
offsetting debits specified in paragraph 
(k)(7)(i) of this section. 
(9) The following provisions apply to 
CO2 credit trading: 
(i) EPA may reject CO2 credit trades 
if the involved manufacturers fail to 
submit the credit trade notification in 
the annual report. 
(ii) A manufacturer may not sell 
credits that are not available for sale 
pursuant to the provisions in paragraph 
(k)(6)(i) of this section. 
(iii) In the event of a negative credit 
balance resulting from a transaction, 
both the buyer and seller are liable. EPA 
may void ab initio the certificates of 
conformity of all test groups 
participating in such a trade. 
(iv) (A) If a manufacturer trades a 
credit that it has not generated pursuant 
to paragraph (k) of this section or 
acquired from another party, the 
manufacturer will be considered to have 
generated a debit in the model year that 
the manufacturer traded the credit. The 
manufacturer must offset such debits by 
the deadline for the annual report for 
that same model year. 
(B) Failure to offset the debits within 
the required time period will be 
considered a failure to satisfy the 
conditions upon which the certificate(s) 
was issued and will be addressed 
pursuant to paragraph (k)(7) of this 
section. 
(v) A manufacturer may only trade 
credits that it has generated pursuant to 
paragraph (k)(4) of this section or 
acquired from another party. 
(l) Maintenance of records and 
submittal of information relevant to 
compliance with fleet average CO2 
standards—(1) Maintenance of records. 
(i) Manufacturers producing any light- 
duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, or 
medium-duty passenger vehicles subject 
to the provisions in this subpart must 
establish, maintain, and retain all the 
following information in adequately 
organized records for each model year: 
(A) Model year. 
(B) Applicable fleet average CO2 
standards for each averaging set as 
defined in paragraph (i) of this section.

years from the due date for the annual 
report. Records may be stored in any 
format and on any media, as long as 
manufacturers can promptly send EPA 
organized written records in English if 
we ask for them. Manufacturers must 
keep records readily available as EPA 
may review them at any time. 
(iv) The Administrator may require 
the manufacturer to retain additional 
records or submit information not 
specifically required by this section. 
(v) Pursuant to a request made by the 
Administrator, the manufacturer must 
submit to the Administrator the 
information that the manufacturer is 
required to retain. 
(vi) EPA may void ab initio a 
certificate of conformity for vehicles 
certified to emission standards as set 
forth or otherwise referenced in this 
subpart for which the manufacturer fails 
to retain the records required in this 
section or to provide such information 
to the Administrator upon request, or to 
submit the reports required in this 
section in the specified time period. 
(2) Reporting. (i) Each manufacturer 
must submit an annual report. The 
annual report must contain for each 
applicable CO2 standard, the calculated 
fleet average CO2 value, all values 
required to calculate the CO2 emissions 
value, the number of credits generated 
or debits incurred, all the values 
required to calculate the credits or 
debits, and the resulting balance of 
credits or debits. 
(ii) For each applicable fleet average 
CO2 standard, the annual report must 
also include documentation on all credit 
transactions the manufacturer has 
engaged in since those included in the 
last report. Information for each 
transaction must include all of the 
following:

report required under § 600.512–12, a 
manufacturer must submit an annual 
report for each model year after 
production ends for all affected vehicles 
produced by the manufacturer subject to 
the provisions of this subpart and no 
later than May 1 of the calendar year 
following the given model year. Annual 
reports must be submitted to: Director, 
Compliance and Innovative Strategies 
Division, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, 2000 Traverwood, Ann Arbor, 
Michigan 48105. 
(vii) Failure by a manufacturer to 
submit the annual report in the

initial decision by the Presiding Officer. 
27. A new section 86.1866–12 is 
added to subpart S to read as follows: 
§ 86.1866–12 CO2 fleet average credit 
programs. 
(a) Additional credits for certification 
of advanced technology vehicles. A 
manufacturer may generate additional 
credits by certifying and producing 
electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles, or fuel cell electric vehicles, as 
those terms are defined in § 86.1803–01, 
in the 2012 through 2016 model years. 
When calculating the fleet average CO2 
emissions according to the provisions of 
part 600 subpart F of this chapter, the 
manufacturer may multiply the number 
of advanced technology vehicles 
produced by [1.2–2.0]. This multiplier 
may be used if the following conditions 
are met: 
(1) Documentation of the use of this 
multiplier and the number of credits 
generated by its use shall be included in 
the annual report to the Administrator; 
(2) Vehicles must be certified to Tier 
2 Bin No. 5 or a more stringent set of 
emissions standards in § 86.1811– 
04(c)(6); 
(3) These multipliers may not be used 
after the 2016 model year; 
(b) Credits for reduction of air 
conditioning refrigerant leakage. 
Manufacturers may generate credits 
applicable to the CO2 fleet average 
program described in § 86.1865–12 by 
implementing specific air conditioning 
system technologies designed to reduce 
air conditioning refrigerant leakage over 
the useful life of their passenger cars 
and/or light trucks. Credits shall be 
calculated according to this paragraph

(b) for each air conditioning system that 
the manufacturer is using to generate 
CO2 credits. 
(1) The manufacturer shall calculate 
an annual rate of refrigerant leakage 
from an air conditioning system in 
grams per year according to the 
provisions of § 86.166–12. 
(2) The CO2-equivalent gram per mile 
leakage reduction to be used to calculate 
the total credits generated by the air 
conditioning system shall be 
determined according to the following 
formulae, rounded to the nearest tenth 
of a gram per mile: 
(i) Passenger automobiles:

⎦⎥⎥
Where: 
MaxCredit is 12.6 for air conditioning 
systems using HFC 134a, and 13.8 for air 
conditioning systems using a refrigerant 
with a lower global warming potential. 
Leakage means the annual refrigerant leakage 
rate determined according to the 
provisions of § 86.166–12(a), except if 
the calculated rate is less than 8.3 grams 
per year the rate for the purpose of this 
formula shall be 8.3 grams per year; 
GWPNEW means the global warming potential 
of the refrigerant, if such refrigerant is 
not R134a, as determined by the 
Administrator; 
GWPHFC134a means the global warming 
potential of HFC 134a, which shall be 
equal to 1430 unless determined 
otherwise by the Administrator.

Where: 
MaxCredit is 15.6 for air conditioning 
systems using HFC 134a, and 17.2 for air 
conditioning systems using a refrigerant with 
a lower global warming potential. 
Leakage means the annual refrigerant 
leakage rate determined according to the 
provisions of § 86.166–12(a), except if the 
calculated rate is less than 10.4 grams per 
year the rate for the purpose of this formula 
shall be 10.4 grams per year; 
GWPNEW means the global warming potential 
of the refrigerant, if such refrigerant is 
not HFC 134a, as determined by the 
Administrator; 
GWPR134a means the global warming 
potential of HFC 134a, which shall be 
equal to 1430 unless determined 
otherwise by the Administrator. 
(3) The total leakage reduction credits 
generated by the air conditioning system 
shall be calculated separately for 
passenger cars and light trucks 
according to the following formula: 
Total Credits (megagrams) = (Leakage × 
Production × VLM) ÷ 1,000,000 
Where: 
Leakage = the CO2-equivalent leakage credit 
value in grams per mile determined in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 
Production = The total number of passenger 
cars or light trucks, whichever is 
applicable, produced with the air 
conditioning system to which to the 
leakage credit value from paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section applies. 
VLM = vehicle lifetime miles, which for 
passenger cars shall be 190,971 and for 
light trucks shall be 221,199. 
(4) The results of paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section, rounded to the nearest 
whole number, shall be included in the 
manufacturer’s credit/debit totals 
calculated in § 86.1865–12(k)(5). 
(c) Credits for improving air 
conditioning system efficiency. 
Manufacturers may generate credits 
applicable to the CO2 fleet average 
program described in § 86.1865–12 by 
implementing specific air conditioning 
system technologies designed to reduce 
air conditioning-related CO2 emissions 
over the useful life of their passenger 
cars and/or light trucks. Credits shall be 
calculated according to this paragraph 
(c) for each air conditioning system that 
the manufacturer is using to generate 
CO2 credits. Manufacturers may also 
generate early air conditioning 
efficiency credits under this paragraph 
(b) for the 2009 through 2011 model 
years according to the provisions of 
§ 86.1867–12(c). For model years 2012 
and 2013 the manufacturer may 
determine air conditioning efficiency 
credits using the requirements in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this 
section. For model years 2014 and later 
the eligibility requirements specified in 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section must be 
met before an air conditioning system is 
allowed to generate credits. 
(1) Air conditioning efficiency credits 
are available for the following 
technologies in the gram per mile 
amounts indicated: 
(i) Reduced reheat, with externally- 
controlled, variable-displacement 
compressor: 1.7 g/mi. 
(ii) Reduced reheat, with externally- 
controlled, fixed-displacement or 
pneumatic variable displacement 
compressor: 1.1 g/mi. 
(iii) Default to recirculated air mode 
whenever the air conditioning system is 
being used to reduce cabin air 
temperature and the outside air 
temperature is greater than 75 °F: 1.7 g/ 
mi. 
(iv) Blower motor and cooling fan 
controls which limit waste energy (e.g. 
pulsewidth modulated power 
controller): 0.9 g/mi. 
(v) Electronic expansion valve: 1.1 g/ 
mi. 
(vi) Improved evaporators and 
condensers (with system analysis on 
each component indicating a coefficient 
of performance improvement greater 
than 10%, when compared to previous 
design): 1.1 g/mi. 
(vii) Oil separator: 0.6 g/mi. 
(2) Air conditioning efficiency credits 
are determined on an air conditioning 
system basis. For each air conditioning 
system that is eligible for a credit based 
on the use of one or more of the items 
listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
the total credit value is the sum of the 
gram per mile values listed in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section for each item that 
applies to the air conditioning system. 
If the sum of those values for an air 
conditioning system is greater than 5.7 
grams per mile, the total credit value is 
deemed to be 5.7 grams per mile. 
(3) The total efficiency credits 
generated by an air conditioning system 
shall be calculated separately for 
passenger cars and light trucks 
according to the following formula: 
Total Credits (Megagrams) = (Credit × 
Production × VLM) ÷ 1,000,000

Credit = the CO2 efficiency credit value in 
grams per mile determined in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. 
Production = The total number of passenger 
cars or light trucks, whichever is 
applicable, produced with the air 
conditioning system to which the 
efficiency credit value from paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section applies. 
VLM = vehicle lifetime miles, which for 
passenger cars shall be 190,971 and for 
light trucks shall be 221,199. 
(4) The results of paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, rounded to the nearest 
whole number, shall be included in the 
manufacturer’s credit/debit totals 
calculated in § 86.1865–12(k)(5). 
(5) Use of the Air Conditioning Idle 
Test Procedure is required after the 2013 
model year as specified in this 
paragraph (c)(5). 
(i) After the 2013 model year, for each 
air conditioning system selected by the 
manufacturer to generate air 
conditioning efficiency credits, the 
manufacturer shall perform the Air 
Conditioning Idle Test Procedure 
specified in § 86.165–14 of this part. 
(ii) Using good engineering judgment, 
the manufacturer must select the vehicle 
configuration to be tested that is 
expected to result in the greatest 
increased CO2 emissions as a result of 
the operation of the air conditioning 
system for which efficiency credits are 
being sought. If the air conditioning 
system is being installed in passenger 
automobiles and light trucks, a separate 
determination of the quantity of credits 
for passenger automobiles and light 
trucks must be made, but only one test 
vehicle is required to represent the air 
conditioning system, provided it 
represents the worst-case impact of the 
system on CO2 emissions. 
(iii) For an air conditioning system to 
be eligible to generate credits in the 
2014 and later model years, the 
increased CO2 emissions as a result of 
the operation of that air conditioning 
system determined according to the Idle 
Test Procedure in § 86.165–14 must be 
less than 14.9 grams per minute. 
(iv) Air conditioning systems with 
compressors that are solely powered by 
electricity shall submit Air Conditioning 
Idle Test Procedure data to be eligible to 
generate credits in the 2014 and later 
model years, but such systems are not 
required to meet a specific threshold to 
be eligible to generate such credits, as 
long as the engine remains off for a 
period of at least 2 minutes during the 
air conditioning on portion of the Idle 
Test Procedure in § 86.165–12 (d). 
(6) The following definitions apply to 
this paragraph (c): 
(i) Reduced reheat, with externally- 
controlled, variable displacement 
compressor means a system in which 
compressor displacement is controlled 
via an electronic signal, based on input 
from sensors (e.g. position or setpoint of 
interior temperature control, interior 
temperature, evaporator outlet air 
temperature, or refrigerant temperature) 
and air temperature at the outlet of the 
evaporator can be controlled to a level 
at 41 °F, or higher. 
(ii) Reduced reheat, with externally- 
controlled, fixed-displacement or 
pneumatic variable displacement 
compressor means a system in which 
the output of either compressor is 
controlled by cycling the compressor 
clutch off-and-on via an electronic 
signal, based on input from sensors (e.g. 
position or setpoint of interior 
temperature control, interior 
temperature, evaporator outlet air 
temperature, or refrigerant temperature) 
and air temperature at the outlet of the 
evaporator can be controlled to a level 
at 41 °F, or higher. 
(iii) Default to recirculated air mode 
means that the default position of the 
mechanism which controls the source of 
air supplied to the air conditioning 
system shall change from outside air to 
recirculated air when the operator or the 
automatic climate control system has 
engaged the air conditioning system (i.e. 
evaporator is removing heat), except 
under those conditions where 
dehumidification is required for 
visibility (i.e. defogger mode). In 
vehicles equipped with interior air 
quality sensors (e.g. humidity sensor, or 
carbon dioxide sensor), the controls may 
determine proper blend of air supply 
sources to maintain freshness of the 
cabin air while continuing to maximize 
the use of recirculated air. At any time, 
the vehicle operator may manually 
select the non-recirculated air setting 
during vehicle operation but the system 
must default to recirculated air mode on 
subsequent vehicle operations (i.e. next 
vehicle start). The climate control 
system may delay switching to 
recirculation mode until the interior air 
temperature is less than the outside air 
temperature, at which time the system 
must switch to recirculated air mode. 
(iv) Blower motor and cooling fan 
controls which limit waste energy means 
a method of controlling fan and blower 
speeds which does not use resistive 
elements to decrease the voltage 
supplied to the motor. 
(v) Electronic expansion valve means 
a valve which throttles the expansion of 
the refrigerant where the position of the 
valve (and flow of refrigerant) is 
controlled via an electronic signal, 
based on input from sensors (e.g. 
position or setpoint of interior 
temperature control, interior 
temperature, evaporator outlet air 
temperature, or refrigerant temperature). 
(vi) Improved evaporators and 
condensers means that the coefficient of 
performance (COP) of air conditioning 
system using improved evaporator and 
condenser designs is 10 percent higher, 
as determined using the bench test 
procedures described in SAE J2765 
‘‘Procedure for Measuring System COP 
of a Mobile Air Conditioning System on 
a Test Bench,’’ when compared to a 
system using standard, or prior model 
year, component designs. SAE J2765 is 
incorporated by reference; see § 86.1. 
(vii) Oil separator means a 
mechanism which removes at least 50 
percent of the oil entrained in the oil/ 
refrigerant mixture exiting the 
compressor and returns it to the 
compressor housing or compressor inlet, 
or a compressor design which does not 
rely on the circulation of an oil/ 
refrigerant mixture for lubrication. 
(d) Credits for CO2-reducing 
technologies where the CO2 reduction is 
not captured on the Federal Test 
Procedure or the Highway Fuel 
Economy Test. Manufacturers may 
optionally generate credits applicable to 
the CO2 fleet average program described 
in § 86.1865–12 by implementing 
innovative technologies that have a 
measurable, demonstrable, and 
verifiable real-world CO2 reduction. 
These optional credits are referred to as 
‘‘off-cycle’’ credits and may be earned 
through the 2016 model year. 
(1) Qualification criteria. To qualify 
for this credit, the following must be 
true: 
(i) The technology must be an 
innovative and novel vehicle- or engine- 
based approach to reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, and not in widespread 
use. 
(ii) The CO2-reducing impact of the 
technology must not be significantly 
measurable over the Federal Test 
Procedure and the Highway Fuel 
Economy Test. The technology must 
improve CO2 emissions beyond the 
driving conditions of those tests. 
(iii) The technology must be able to be 
demonstrated to be effective for the full 
useful life of the vehicle. Unless the 
manufacturer demonstrates that the 
technology is not subject to in-use 
deterioration, the manufacturer must 
account for the deterioration in their 
analysis. 
(2) Quantifying the CO2 reductions of 
an off-cycle technology. The 
manufacturer may use one of the two 
options specified in this paragraph 
(d)(2) to measure the CO2-reducing 
potential of an innovative off-cycle 
technology. The option described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section may

be used only with EPA approval, and to 
use that option the manufacturer must 
be able to justify to the Administrator 
why the 5-cycle option described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section 
insufficiently characterizes the 
effectiveness of the off-cycle technology. 
The manufacturer should notify EPA in 
their pre-model year report of their 
intention to generate any credits under 
paragraph (d) of this section. 
(i) Technology demonstration using 
EPA 5-cycle methodology. To 
demonstrate an off-cycle technology and 
to determine a CO2 credit using the EPA 
5-cycle methodology, the manufacturer 
shall determine 5-cycle city/highway 
combined carbon-related exhaust 
emissions both with the technology 
installed and operating and without the 
technology installed and/or operating. 
The manufacturer shall conduct the 
following steps, both with the off-cycle 
technology installed and operating and 
without the technology operating or 
installed. 
(A) Determine carbon-related exhaust 
emissions over the FTP, the HFET, the 
US06, the SC03, and the cold 
temperature FTP test procedures 
according to the test procedure 
provisions specified in 40 CFR part 600 
subpart B and using the calculation 
procedures specified in § 600.113–08 of 
this chapter. 
(B) Calculate 5-cycle city and highway 
carbon-related exhaust emissions using 
data determined in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i)(A) of this section according to 
the calculation procedures in 
paragraphs (d) through (f) of 40 CFR 
600.114–08. 
(C) Calculate a 5-cycle city/highway 
combined carbon-related exhaust 
emission value using the city and 
highway values determined in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section. 
(D) Subtract the 5-cycle city/highway 
combined carbon-related exhaust 
emission value determined with the off- 
cycle technology operating from the 5- 
cycle city/highway combined carbon- 
related exhaust emission value 
determined with the off-cycle 
technology not operating. The result is 
the gram per mile credit amount 
assigned to the technology. 
(ii) Technology demonstration using 
alternative EPA-approved methodology. 
In cases where the EPA 5-cycle 
methodology described in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section cannot 
adequately measure the emission 
reduction attributable to an innovative 
off-cycle technology, the manufacturer 
may develop an alternative approach. 
Prior to a model year in which a 
manufacturer intends to seek these 
credits, the manufacturer must submit a 
detailed analytical plan to EPA. EPA 
will work with the manufacturer to 
ensure that an analytical plan will result 
in appropriate data for the purposes of 
generating these credits. The alternative 
demonstration program must be 
approved in advance by the 
Administrator and should: 
(A) Use modeling, on-road testing, on- 
road data collection, or other approved 
analytical or engineering methods; 
(B) Be robust, verifiable, and capable 
of demonstrating the real-world 
emissions benefit with strong statistical 
significance; 
(C) Result in a demonstration of 
baseline and controlled emissions over 
a wide range of driving conditions and 
number of vehicles such that issues of 
data uncertainty are minimized; 
(D) Result in data on a model type 
basis unless the manufacturer 
demonstrates that another basis is 
appropriate and adequate. 
(iii) Calculation of total off-cycle 
credits. Total off-cycle credits in 
Megagrams of CO2 shall be calculated 
separately for passenger automobiles 
and light trucks according to the 
following formula: 
Total Credits (Megagrams) = (Credit × 
Production × VLM) ÷ 1,000,000 
Where: 
Credit = the 5-cycle credit value in grams per 
mile determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(D) 
or (d)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Production = The total number of passenger 
cars or light trucks, whichever is 
applicable, produced with the off-cycle 
technology to which to the credit value 
determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(D) or 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section applies. 
VLM = vehicle lifetime miles, which for 
passenger cars shall be 190,971 and for 
light trucks shall be 221,199. 
28. A new § 86.1867–12 is added to 
subpart S to read as follows: 
§ 86.1867–12 Optional early CO2 credit 
programs. 
Manufacturers may optionally 
generate CO2 credits in the 2009 through 
2011 model years for use in the 2012 
and later model years subject to the 
provisions of this section. 
Manufacturers may generate early fleet 
average credits, air conditioning leakage 
credits, air conditioning efficiency 
credits, early advanced technology 
credits, and early off-cycle technology 
credits. Manufacturers generating any 
credits under this section must submit 
an early credits report to the 
Administrator as required in this 
section. 
(a) Early fleet average CO2 reduction 
credits. Manufacturers may optionally 
generate credits for reductions in their 
fleet average CO2 emissions achieved in 
the 2009 through 2011 model years. To 
generate early fleet average CO2 
reduction credits, manufacturers must 
select one of the four pathways 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(4) of this section. The manufacturer 
may select only one pathway, and that 
pathway must remain in effect for the 
2009 through 2011 model years. Fleet 
average credits (or debits) must be 
calculated and reported to EPA for each 
model year under each selected 
pathway. Early credits are subject to five 
year carry-forward restrictions based on 
the model year in which the credits are 
generated. 
(1) Pathway 1. To earn credits under 
this pathway, the manufacturer shall 
calculate an average carbon-related 
exhaust emission value to the nearest 
one gram per mile for the classes of 
motor vehicles identified in this 
paragraph (a)(1), and the results of such 
calculations will be reported to the 
Administrator for use in determining 
compliance with the applicable CO2 
early credit threshold values. 
(i) An average carbon-related exhaust 
emission value calculation will be made 
for the combined LDV/LDT1 averaging 
set. 
(ii) An average carbon-related exhaust 
emission value calculation will be made 
for the combined LDT2/HLDT/MDPV 
averaging set. 
(iii) Average carbon-related exhaust 
emission values shall be determined 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR 
600.510–12, except that: 
(A) Total U.S. model year sales data 
will be used, instead of production data; 
(B) The average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions for alcohol fueled 
model types shall be calculated 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR 
600.510–12(j)(2)(ii)(B), without the use 
of the 0.15 multiplicative factor. 
(C) The average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions for natural gas fueled 
model types shall be calculated 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR 
600.510–12(j)(2)(iii)(B), without the use 
of the 0.15 multiplicative factor. 
(D) The average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions for alcohol dual 
fueled model types shall be calculated 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR 
600.510–12(j)(2)(vi), without the use of 
the 0.15 multiplicative factor and with 
F=0. For the 2010 and 2011 model years 
only, if the California Air Resources 
Board has approved a manufacturer’s 
request to use a non-zero value of F, the 
manufacturer may use such an approved 
value. 
(E) The average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions for natural gas dual 
fueled model types shall be calculated 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR

the 0.15 multiplicative factor and with 
F=0. For the 2010 and 2011 model years 
only, if the California Air Resources 
Board has approved a manufacturer’s 
request to use a non-zero value of F, the 
manufacturer may use such an approved 
value. 
(F) 40 CFR 600.510–12(j)(3) shall not 
apply. Electric, fuel cell electric, and 
plug-in hybrid electric model type 
carbon-related exhaust emission values 
shall be included in the fleet average 
determined under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section only to the extent that such 
vehicles are not being used to generate 
early advanced technology vehicle 
credits under paragraph (c) of this 
section. 
(iv) Fleet average CO2 credit threshold 
values.

2011 ........................................................................................... 265 ............................................................................................ 388 
(v) Credits are earned on the last day 
of the model year. Manufacturers must 
calculate, for a given model year, the 
number of credits or debits it has 
generated according to the following 
equation, rounded to the nearest 
megagram: 
CO2 Credits or Debits (Mg) = [(CO2 
Credit Threshold ¥ Manufacturer’s 
Sales Weighted Fleet Average CO2 
Emissions) × (Total Number of 
Vehicles Sold) × (Vehicle Lifetime 
Miles)] ÷ 1,000,000 
Where: 
CO2 Credit Threshold = the applicable credit 
threshold value for the model year and 
vehicle averaging set as determined by 
paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section; 
Manufacturer’s Sales Weighted Fleet Average 
CO2 Emissions = average calculated 
according to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section; 
Total Number of Vehicles Sold = The number 
of vehicles domestically sold as defined 
in 40 CFR 600.511–80; and 
Vehicle Lifetime Miles is 190,971 for the 
LDV/LDT1 averaging set and 221,199 for 
the LDT2/HLDT/MDPV averaging set. 
(vi) Deficits generated against the 
applicable CO2 credit threshold values 
in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section in 
any averaging set for any of the 2009– 
2011 model years must be offset using 
credits accumulated by any averaging 
set in any of the 2009–2011 model years 
before determining the number of 
credits that may be carried forward to 
the 2012. Deficit carry forward and 
credit banking provisions of § 86.1865– 
12 apply to early credits earned under 
this paragraph (a)(1), except that deficits 
may not be carried forward from any of 
the 2009–2011 model years into the 
2012 model year. 
(2) Pathway 2. To earn credits under 
this pathway, manufacturers shall 
calculate an average carbon-related 
exhaust emission value to the nearest 
one gram per mile for the classes of 
motor vehicles identified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, and the results of 
such calculations will be reported to the 
Administrator for use in determining 
compliance with the applicable CO2 
early credit threshold values. 
(i) Credits under this pathway shall be 
calculated according to the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except 
credits may only be generated by 
vehicles sold in a model year in States 
with a section 177 program in effect in 
that model year. For the purposes of this 
section, ‘‘section 177 program’’ means 
State regulations or other laws that 
apply to any of the following categories 
of motor vehicles: Passenger cars, light- 
duty trucks up through 6,000 pounds 
GVWR, and medium-duty vehicles from 
6,001 to 14,000 pounds GVWR, as these 
categories of motor vehicles are defined 
in the California Code of Regulations, 
Title 13, Division 3, Chapter 1, Article 
1, Section 1900. 
(ii) A deficit in any averaging set for 
any of the 2009–2011 model years must 
be offset using credits accumulated by 
any averaging set in any of the 2009– 
2011 model years before determining 
the number of credits that may be 
carried forward to the 2012 model year. 
Deficit carry forward and credit banking 
provisions of § 86.1865–12 apply to 
early credits earned under this 
paragraph (a)(1), except that deficits 
may not be carried forward from any of 
the 2009–2011 model years into the 
2012 model year. 
(3) Pathway 3. Pathway 3 credits are 
those credits earned under Pathway 2 as 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section and in the section 177 States 
determined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section, combined with additional 
credits earned in the set of states that 
does not include the section 177 States 
determined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section and calculated according to this 
paragraph (a)(3). 
(i) Manufacturers shall earn 
additional credits under Pathway 3 by 
calculating an average carbon-related 
exhaust emission value to the nearest 
one gram per mile for the classes of 
motor vehicles identified in this 
paragraph (a)(3). The results of such 
calculations will be reported to the 
Administrator for use in determining 
compliance with the applicable CO2 
early credit threshold values. 
(ii) Credits may only be generated by 
vehicles sold in the States not included 
in the section 177 States determined in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. 
(iii) An average carbon-related 
exhaust emission value calculation will 
be made for the passenger automobile 
averaging set. The term ‘‘passenger 
automobile’’ shall have the meaning 
given by the Department of 
Transportation at 49 CFR 523.4 for the 
specific model year for which the 
calculation is being made. 
(iv) An average carbon-related exhaust 
emission value calculation will be made 
for the light truck averaging set. The 
term ‘‘light truck’’ shall have the 
meaning given by the Department of 
Transportation at 49 CFR 523.5 for the 
specific model year for which the 
calculation is being made. 
(v) Average carbon-related exhaust 
emission values shall be determined 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR 
600.510–12, except that: 
(A) Total model year sales data will be 
used, instead of production data, except 
that vehicles sold in the section 177 
States determined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) 
of this section shall not be included; 
(B) The average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions for alcohol fueled 
model types shall be calculated 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR 
600.510–12(j)(2)(ii)(B), without the use 
of the 0.15 multiplicative factor. 
(C) The average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions for natural gas fueled 
model types shall be calculated 
according to the provisions of 40 CFR 
600.510–12(j)(2)(iii)(B), without the use 
of the 0.15 multiplicative factor.

the 0.15 multiplicative factor and with 
F=0. 
(F) 40 CFR 600.510–12(j)(3) shall not 
apply. Electric, fuel cell electric, and 
plug-in hybrid electric model type 
carbon-related exhaust emission values 
shall be included in the fleet average 
determined under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section only to the extent that such 
vehicles are not being used to generate 
early advanced technology vehicle 
credits under paragraph (c) of this 
section. 
(vi) Pathway 3 fleet average CO2 credit 
threshold values. 
(A) For 2009 and 2010 model year 
passenger automobiles, the fleet average 
CO2 credit threshold value is 323 grams/ 
mile. 
(B) For 2009 model year light trucks 
the fleet average CO2 credit threshold 
value is 381 grams/mile, or, if the 
manufacturer chose to optionally meet 
an alternative manufacturer-specific 
light truck fuel economy standard 
calculated under 49 CFR 533.5 for the 
2009 model year, the gram per mile fleet 
average CO2 credit threshold shall be 
the CO2 value determined by dividing 
8887 by that alternative manufacturer- 
specific fuel economy standard and 
rounding to the nearest whole gram per 
mile. 
(C) For 2010 model year light trucks 
the fleet average CO2 credit threshold 
value is 376 grams/mile, or, if the 
manufacturer chose to optionally meet 
an alternative manufacturer-specific 
light truck fuel economy standard 
calculated under 49 CFR 533.5 for the 
2010 model year, the gram per mile fleet 
average CO2 credit threshold shall be 
the CO2 value determined by dividing 
8887 by that alternative manufacturer- 
specific fuel economy standard and 
rounding to the nearest whole gram per 
mile. 
(D) For 2011 model year passenger 
automobiles the fleet average CO2 credit 
threshold value is the value determined 
by dividing 8887 by the manufacturer- 
specific passenger automobile fuel 
economy standard for the 2011 model 
year determined under 49 CFR 531.5 
and rounding to the nearest whole gram

(E) For 2011 model year light trucks 
the fleet average CO2 credit threshold 
value is the value determined by 
dividing 8887 by the manufacturer- 
specific light truck fuel economy 
standard for the 2011 model year 
determined under 49 CFR 533.5 and 
rounding to the nearest whole gram per 
mile. 
(vii) Credits are earned on the last day 
of the model year. Manufacturers must 
calculate, for a given model year, the 
number of credits or debits it has 
generated according to the following 
equation, rounded to the nearest 
megagram: 
CO2 Credits or Debits (Mg) = [(CO2 
Credit Threshold ¥ Manufacturer’s 
Sales Weighted Fleet Average CO2 
Emissions) × (Total Number of 
Vehicles Sold) × (Vehicle Lifetime 
Miles)] ÷ 1,000,000 
Where: 
CO2 Credit Threshold = the applicable credit 
threshold value for the model year and 
vehicle averaging set as determined by 
paragraph (a)(3)(vii) of this section; 
Manufacturer’s Sales Weighted Fleet Average 
CO2 Emissions = average calculated 
according to paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this 
section; 
Total Number of Vehicles Sold = The number 
of vehicles domestically sold as defined 
in 40 CFR 600.511–80 except that 
vehicles sold in the section 177 States 
determined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section shall not be included; and

LDV/LDT1 averaging set and 221,199 for 
the LDT2/HLDT/MDPV averaging set. 
(viii) Deficits in any averaging set for 
any of the 2009–2011 model years must 
be offset using credits accumulated by 
any averaging set in any of the 2009– 
2011 model years before determining 
the number of credits that may be 
carried forward to the 2012. Deficit 
carry forward and credit banking 
provisions of 86.1865–12 apply to early 
credits earned under this paragraph 
(a)(3), except that deficits may not be 
carried forward from any of the 2009– 
2011 model years into the 2012 model 
year. 
(4) Pathway 4. Pathway 4 credits are 
those credits earned under Pathway 3 as 
described in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section in the set of states that does not 
include the section 177 States 
determined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section and calculated according to 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Credits 
may only be generated by vehicles sold 
in the set of states that does not include 
the section 177 States determined in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

through 2011. The early credits are 
subject to five year carry forward limits 
based on the model year in which the 
credits are generated. Credits must be 
tracked by model type and model year. 
(2) Manufacturers that select Pathway 
4 described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section may not generate early air 
conditioning credits for vehicles sold in 
the section 177 States as determined in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. 
(c) Early advanced technology vehicle 
credits. Vehicles eligible for this credit 
are electric vehicles, fuel cell electric 
vehicles, and plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles, as those terms are defined in 
§ 86.1803–01. If a manufacturer chooses 
to not include electric vehicles, fuel cell 
electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid 
electric vehicles in their fleet averages 
calculated under any of the options 
described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the manufacturer may generate 
early advanced technology vehicle

manufacturer shall multiply the US06 
total grams/mile values determined in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section by the 
estimated proportion of fuel use for the 
city and highway phases relative to the 
total US06 fuel use. The manufacturer 
may estimate the proportion of fuel use 
for the US06 City and US06 Highway 
phases by using modal CO2, HC, and CO 
emissions data, or by using appropriate 
OBD data (e.g., fuel flow rate in grams 
of fuel per second), or another method 
approved by the Administrator.

40. Section 600.115–08 is amended by 
revising the introductory text to read as 
follows: 
§ 600.115–08 Criteria for determining the 
fuel economy label calculation method for 
2011 and later model year vehicles. 
This section provides the criteria to 
determine if the derived 5-cycle method 
for determining fuel economy label 
values, as specified in § 600.210–08 
(a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable, may be 
used to determine label values for 2011 
and later model year vehicles. Separate 
criteria apply to city and highway fuel 
economy for each test group. The 
provisions of this section are optional. 
If this option is not chosen, or if the 
criteria provided in this section are not 
met, fuel economy label values for 2011 
and later model year vehicles must be 
determined according to the vehicle- 
specific 5-cycle method specified in 
§ 600.210–08(a)(1) or (b)(1), as 
applicable. However, dedicated 
alternative-fuel vehicles, dual fuel 
vehicles when operating on alternative 
fuel, and MDPVs may use the derived 5- 
cycle method for determining fuel 
economy labels for 2011 and later model 
years whether or not the criteria 
provided in this section are met.

49777 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
for each vehicle configuration for which 
data are available. 
(1) If only one set of FTP-based city 
and HFET-based highway fuel economy 
values is accepted for a vehicle 
configuration, these values, rounded to 
the nearest tenth of a mile per gallon, 
comprise the city and highway fuel 
economy values for that configuration. If 
only one set of FTP-based city and 
HFET-based highway carbon-related 
exhaust emission values is accepted for 
a vehicle configuration, these values, 
rounded to the nearest gram per mile, 
comprise the city and highway carbon- 
related exhaust emission values for that 
configuration. 
(2) If more than one set of FTP-based 
city and HFET-based highway fuel 
economy and/or carbon-related exhaust 
emission values are accepted for a 
vehicle configuration: 
(i) All data shall be grouped according 
to the subconfiguration for which the 
data were generated using sales 
projections supplied in accordance with 
§ 600.208(a)(3). 
(ii) Within each group of data, all fuel 
economy values are harmonically 
averaged and rounded to the nearest 
0.0001 of a mile per gallon and all 
carbon-related exhaust emission values 
are arithmetically averaged and rounded 
to the nearest tenth of a gram per mile 
in order to determine FTP-based city 
and HFET-based highway fuel economy 
and carbon-related exhaust emission 
values for each subconfiguration at 
which the vehicle configuration was 
tested. 
(iii) All FTP-based city fuel economy 
and carbon-related exhaust emission 
values and all HFET-based highway fuel 
economy and carbon-related exhaust 
emission values calculated in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section are (separately 
for city and highway) averaged in 
proportion to the sales fraction (rounded 
to the nearest 0.0001) within the vehicle 
configuration (as provided to the 
Administrator by the manufacturer) of 
vehicles of each tested subconfiguration. 
Fuel economy values shall be 
harmonically averaged and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values shall be 
arithmetically averaged. The resultant 
fuel economy values, rounded to the 
nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon, are the 
FTP-based city and HFET-based 
highway fuel economy values for the 
vehicle configuration. The resultant 
carbon-related exhaust emission values, 
rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram 
per mile, are the FTP-based city and 
HFET-based highway carbon-related 
exhaust emission values for the vehicle 
configuration. 
(3)(i) For the purpose of determining 
average fuel economy under § 600.510– 
08, the combined fuel economy value 
for a vehicle configuration is calculated 
by harmonically averaging the FTP- 
based city and HFET-based highway 
fuel economy values, as determined in 
§ 600.206(a)(1) or (2) of this section, 
weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, 
and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile 
per gallon. A sample of this calculation 
appears in Appendix II of this part. 
(ii) For the purpose of determining 
average carbon-related exhaust 
emissions under § 600.510–08, the 
combined carbon-related exhaust 
emission value for a vehicle 
configuration is calculated by 
arithmetically averaging the FTP-based 
city and HFET-based highway carbon- 
related exhaust emission values, as 
determined in § 600.206(a)(1) or (2) of 
this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 
respectively, and rounded to the nearest 
tenth of gram per mile. 
(4) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles 
and natural gas dual fuel automobiles 
the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) or 
(2) of this section, as applicable, shall be 
used to calculate two separate sets of 
FTP-based city, HFET-based highway, 
and combined fuel economy and 
carbon-related exhaust emission values 
for each configuration. 
(i) Calculate the city, highway, and 
combined fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values from 
the tests performed using gasoline or 
diesel test fuel. 
(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and 
combined fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values from 
the tests performed using alcohol or 
natural gas test fuel. 
(b) If only one equivalent petroleum- 
based fuel economy value exists for an 
electric vehicle configuration, that 
value, rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
mile per gallon, will comprise the 
petroleum-based fuel economy for that 
configuration. The carbon-related 
exhaust emission value for that 
configuration shall be 0 grams per mile. 
(c) If more than one equivalent 
petroleum-based fuel economy value 
exists for an electric vehicle 
configuration, all values for that vehicle 
configuration are harmonically averaged 
and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile 
per gallon for that configuration. The 
carbon-related exhaust emission value 
for that configuration shall be 0 grams 
per mile. 
44. A new § 600.208–12 is added to 
subpart C to read as follows: 
§ 600.208–12 Calculation of FTP-based 
and HFET-based fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values for a model 
type. 
(a) Fuel economy and carbon-related 
exhaust emission values for a base level 
are calculated from vehicle 
configuration fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values as 
determined in § 600.206–08(a), (b), or (c) 
as applicable, for low-altitude tests. 
(1) If the Administrator determines 
that automobiles intended for sale in the 
State of California are likely to exhibit 
significant differences in fuel economy 
and carbon-related exhaust emission 
values from those intended for sale in 
other states, she will calculate fuel 
economy and carbon-related exhaust 
emission values for each base level for 
vehicles intended for sale in California 
and for each base level for vehicles 
intended for sale in the rest of the 
States. 
(2) In order to highlight the fuel 
efficiency and carbon-related exhaust 
emission values of certain designs 
otherwise included within a model 
type, a manufacturer may wish to 
subdivide a model type into one or more 
additional model types. This is 
accomplished by separating 
subconfigurations from an existing base 
level and placing them into a new base 
level. The new base level is identical to 
the existing base level except that it 
shall be considered, for the purposes of 
this paragraph, as containing a new 
basic engine. The manufacturer will be 
permitted to designate such new basic 
engines and base level(s) if: 
(i) Each additional model type 
resulting from division of another model 
type has a unique car line name and that 
name appears on the label and on the 
vehicle bearing that label; 
(ii) The subconfigurations included in 
the new base levels are not included in 
any other base level which differs only 
by basic engine (i.e., they are not 
included in the calculation of the 
original base level fuel economy values); 
and 
(iii) All subconfigurations within the 
new base level are represented by test 
data in accordance with § 600.010– 
08(c)(1)(ii). 
(3) The manufacturer shall supply 
total model year sales projections for 
each car line/vehicle subconfiguration 
combination. 
(i) Sales projections must be supplied 
separately for each car line-vehicle 
subconfiguration intended for sale in 
California and each car line/vehicle 
subconfiguration intended for sale in 
the rest of the States if required by the 
Administrator under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.

(ii) Manufacturers shall update sales 
projections at the time any model type 
value is calculated for a label value. 
(iii) The provisions of paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section may be satisfied by 
providing an amended application for 
certification, as described in § 86.1844– 
01. 
(4) Vehicle configuration fuel 
economy and carbon-related exhaust 
emission values, as determined in 
§ 600.206–08 (a), (b) or (c), as 
applicable, are grouped according to 
base level. 
(i) If only one vehicle configuration 
within a base level has been tested, the 
fuel economy and carbon-related 
exhaust emission values from that 
vehicle configuration will constitute the 
fuel economy and carbon-related 
exhaust emission values for that base 
level. 
(ii) If more than one vehicle 
configuration within a base level has 
been tested, the vehicle configuration 
fuel economy values are harmonically 
averaged in proportion to the respective 
sales fraction (rounded to the nearest 
0.0001) of each vehicle configuration 
and the resultant fuel economy value 
rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per 
gallon; and the vehicle configuration 
carbon-related exhaust emission values 
are arithmetically averaged in 
proportion to the respective sales 
fraction (rounded to the nearest 0.0001) 
of each vehicle configuration and the 
resultant carbon-related exhaust 
emission value rounded to the nearest 
gram per mile. 
(5) The procedure specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this 
section will be repeated for each base 
level, thus establishing city, highway, 
and combined fuel economy and 
carbon-related exhaust emission values 
for each base level. 
(6) For the purposes of calculating a 
base level fuel economy or carbon- 
related exhaust emission value, if the 
only vehicle configuration(s) within the 
base level are vehicle configuration(s) 
which are intended for sale at high 
altitude, the Administrator may use fuel 
economy and carbon-related exhaust 
emission data from tests conducted on 
these vehicle configuration(s) at high 
altitude to calculate the fuel economy or 
carbon-related exhaust emission value 
for the base level. 
(7) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles 
and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, 
the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (6) of this section shall be used 
to calculate two separate sets of city, 
highway, and combined fuel economy 
and carbon-related exhaust emission 
values for each base level. 
(i) Calculate the city, highway, and 
combined fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values from 
the tests performed using gasoline or 
diesel test fuel. 
(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and 
combined fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values from 
the tests performed using alcohol or 
natural gas test fuel. 
(b) For each model type, as 
determined by the Administrator, a city, 
highway, and combined fuel economy 
value and a carbon-related exhaust 
emission value will be calculated by 
using the projected sales and fuel 
economy and carbon-related exhaust 
emission values for each base level 
within the model type. Separate model 
type calculations will be done based on 
the vehicle configuration fuel economy 
and carbon-related exhaust emission 
values as determined in § 600.206–08 
(a), (b) or (c), as applicable. 
(1) If the Administrator determines 
that automobiles intended for sale in the 
State of California are likely to exhibit 
significant differences in fuel economy 
and carbon-related exhaust emission 
values from those intended for sale in 
other States, she will calculate fuel 
economy and carbon-related exhaust 
emission values for each model type for 
vehicles intended for sale in California 
and for each model type for vehicles 
intended for sale in the rest of the 
States. 
(2) The sales fraction for each base 
level is calculated by dividing the 
projected sales of the base level within 
the model type by the projected sales of 
the model type and rounding the 
quotient to the nearest 0.0001. 
(3)(i) The FTP-based city fuel 
economy values of the model type 
(calculated to the nearest 0.0001 mpg) 
are determined by dividing one by a 
sum of terms, each of which 
corresponds to a base level and which 
is a fraction determined by dividing: 
(A) The sales fraction of a base level; 
by 
(B) The FTP-based city fuel economy 
value for the respective base level. 
(ii) The FTP-based city carbon-related 
exhaust emission value of the model 
type (calculated to the nearest gram per 
mile) are determined by a sum of terms, 
each of which corresponds to a base 
level and which is a product determined 
by multiplying: 
(A) The sales fraction of a base level; 
by 
(B) The FTP-based city carbon-related 
exhaust emission value for the 
respective base level. 
(4) The procedure specified in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section is 
repeated in an analogous manner to 
determine the highway and combined 
fuel economy and carbon-related 
exhaust emission values for the model 
type. 
(5) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles 
and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, 
the procedures of paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (4) of this section shall be used 
to calculate two separate sets of city, 
highway, and combined fuel economy 
values and two separate sets of city, 
highway, and combined carbon-related 
exhaust emission values for each model 
type. 
(i) Calculate the city, highway, and 
combined fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values from 
the tests performed using gasoline or 
diesel test fuel. 
(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and 
combined fuel economy and carbon- 
related exhaust emission values from 
the tests performed using alcohol or 
natural gas test fuel.

(iii) The fuel economy value of diesel- 
powered model types will be multiplied 
by the factor 1.0 to convert gallons of 
diesel fuel to equivalent gallons of 
gasoline. 
(c) Except as permitted in paragraph 
(d) of this section, the average fuel 
economy will be calculated individually 
for each category identified in paragraph 
(a) of this section as follows: 
(1) Divide the total production 
volume of that category of automobiles; 
by 
(2) A sum of terms, each of which 
corresponds to a model type within that 
category of automobiles and is a fraction 
determined by dividing the number of 
automobiles of that model type 
produced by the manufacturer in the 
model year; by 
(i) For gasoline-fueled and diesel- 
fueled model types, the fuel economy 
calculated for that model type in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section; or 
(ii) For alcohol-fueled model types, 
the fuel economy value calculated for 
that model type in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section divided 
by 0.15 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 
mpg; or 
(iii) For natural gas-fueled model 
types, the fuel economy value 
calculated for that model type in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section divided by 0.15 and rounded to 
the nearest 0.1 mpg; or 
(iv) For alcohol dual fuel model types, 
for model years 1993 through 2019, the 
harmonic average of the following two 
terms; the result rounded to the nearest 
0.1 mpg: 
(A) The combined model type fuel 
economy value for operation on gasoline 
or diesel fuel as determined in 
§ 600.208(b)(5)(i); and 
(B) The combined model type fuel 
economy value for operation on alcohol 
fuel as determined in § 600.208(b)(5)(ii) 
divided by 0.15 provided the 
requirements of § 600.510(g) are met; or 
(v) For natural gas dual fuel model 
types, for model years 1993 through 
2019, the harmonic average of the 
following two terms; the result rounded 
to the nearest 0.1 mpg: 
(A) The combined model type fuel 
economy value for operation on gasoline 
or diesel as determined in 
§ 600.208(b)(5)(i); and 
(B) The combined model type fuel 
economy value for operation on natural 
gas as determined in § 600.208(b)(5)(ii) 
divided by 0.15 provided the 
requirements of paragraph (g) of this 
section are met. 
(d) The Administrator may approve 
alternative calculation methods if they 
are part of an approved credit plan 
under the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 2003. 
(e) For passenger categories identified 
in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this 
section, the average fuel economy 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section shall be adjusted using 
the following equation: 
AFEadj = AFE[((0.55 × a × c) + (0.45 × 
c) + (0.5556 × a) + 0.4487)/((0.55 × 
a) + 0.45)] + IW 
Where: 
AFEadj = Adjusted average combined fuel 
economy, rounded to the nearest 0.1 
mpg; 
AFE = Average combined fuel economy as 
calculated in paragraph (c) of this 
section, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 
mpg; 
a = Sales-weight average (rounded to the 
nearest 0.0001 mpg) of all model type 
highway fuel economy values (rounded 
to the nearest 0.1 mpg) divided by the 
sales-weighted average (rounded to the 
nearest 0.0001 mpg) of all model type 
city fuel economy values (rounded to the 
nearest 0.1 mpg). The quotient shall be 
rounded to 4 decimal places. These 
average fuel economies shall be 
determined using the methodology of 
paragraph (c) of this section. 
c = 0.0014; 
IW = (9.2917 × 10 ¥3 × SF3IWC × FE3IWC) ¥ 
(3.5123 × 10 ¥3 × SF4ETW × FE4IWC). 
Note: Any calculated value of IW less than 
zero shall be set equal to zero. 
SF3IWC = The 3000 lb. inertia weight class 
sales divided by total sales. The quotient 
shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. 
SF4ETW = The 4000 lb. equivalent test weight 
category sales divided by total sales. The 
quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal 
places. 
FE4IWC = The sales-weighted average 
combined fuel economy of all 3000 lb. 
inertia weight class base levels in the 
compliance category. Round the result to 
the nearest 0.0001 mpg. 
FE4IWC = The sales-weighted average 
combined fuel economy of all 4000 lb. 
inertia weight class base levels in the 
compliance category. Round the result to 
the nearest 0.0001 mpg. 
(f) The Administrator shall calculate 
and apply additional average fuel 
economy adjustments if, after notice and 
opportunity for comment, the 
Administrator determines that, as a 
result of test procedure changes not 
previously considered, such correction 
is necessary to yield fuel economy test 
results that are comparable to those 
obtained under the 1975 test 
procedures. In making such 
determinations, the Administrator must 
find that: 
(1) A directional change in measured 
fuel economy of an average vehicle can 
be predicted from a revision to the test 
procedures; 
(2) The magnitude of the change in 
measured fuel economy for any vehicle 
or fleet of vehicles caused by a revision 
to the test procedures is quantifiable 
from theoretical calculations or best 
available test data; 
(3) The impact of a change on average 
fuel economy is not due to eliminating 
the ability of manufacturers to take 
advantage of flexibility within the 
existing test procedures to gain 
measured improvements in fuel 
economy which are not the result of 
actual improvements in the fuel 
economy of production vehicles; 
(4) The impact of a change on average 
fuel economy is not solely due to a 
greater ability of manufacturers to 
reflect in average fuel economy those 
design changes expected to have 
comparable effects on in-use fuel 
economy; 
(5) The test procedure change is 
required by EPA or is a change initiated 
by EPA in its laboratory and is not a 
change implemented solely by a 
manufacturer in its own laboratory. 
(g)(1) Alcohol dual fuel automobiles 
and natural gas dual fuel automobiles 
must provide equal or greater energy 
efficiency while operating on alcohol or 
natural gas as while operating on 
gasoline or diesel fuel to obtain the 
CAFE credit determined in paragraphs 
(c)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section or to 
obtain the carbon-related exhaust 
emissions credit determined in 
paragraphs (j)(2)(ii) and (iii). The 
following equation must hold true: 
Ealt/Epet> or = 1 
Where: 
Ealt = [FEalt/(NHValt × Dalt)] × 106 = energy 
efficiency while operating on alternative 
fuel rounded to the nearest 0.01 miles/ 
million BTU. 
Epet = [FEpet/(NHVpet × Dpet)] × 106 = energy 
efficiency while operating on gasoline or 
diesel (petroleum) fuel rounded to the 
nearest 0.01 miles/million BTU. 
FEalt is the fuel economy [miles/gallon for 
liquid fuels or miles/100 standard cubic 
feet for gaseous fuels] while operated on 
the alternative fuel as determined in 
§ 600.113–08(a) and (b); 
FEpet is the fuel economy [miles/gallon] while 
operated on petroleum fuel (gasoline or 
diesel) as determined in § 600.113(a) and 
(b); 
NHValt is the net (lower) heating value [BTU/ 
lb] of the alternative fuel; 
NHVpet is the net (lower) heating value [BTU/ 
lb] of the petroleum fuel; 
Dalt is the density [lb/gallon for liquid fuels 
or lb/100 standard cubic feet for gaseous 
fuels] of the alternative fuel; 
Dpet is the density [lb/gallon] of the 
petroleum fuel. 
(i) The equation must hold true for 
both the FTP city and HFET highway 
fuel economy values for each test of 
each test vehicle. 
(ii)(A) The net heating value for 
alcohol fuels shall be determined per

(1) The Administrator shall calculate 
the decrease in average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions to determine if the 
maximum decrease provided in 
paragraph (i) of this section has been 
reached. The Administrator shall 
calculate the average carbon-related

operated exclusively on gasoline (or 
diesel) fuel. The difference is limited to 
the maximum decrease specified in 
paragraph (i) of this section. 
(2) [Reserved] 
(j) The average carbon-related exhaust 
emissions will be calculated 
individually for each category identified 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section as 
follows: 
(1) Divide the total production 
volume of that category of automobiles 
into: 
(2) A sum of terms, each of which 
corresponds to a model type within that 
category of automobiles and is a product 
determined by multiplying the number 
of automobiles of that model type 
produced by the manufacturer in the 
model year by: 
(i) For gasoline-fueled and diesel- 
fueled model types, the carbon-related 
exhaust emissions value calculated for 
that model type in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or 
(ii)(A) For alcohol-fueled model types, 
for model years 2012 through 2015, the 
carbon-related exhaust emissions value 
calculated for that model type in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section multiplied by 0.15 and rounded 
to the nearest gram per mile; or

according to the following formula and 
rounded to the nearest gram per mile: 
CREE = (F × CREEalt) + ((1¥F) × 
CREEgas) 
Where: 
F = 0.00 unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator according to the 
provisions of paragraph (k) of this 
section; 
CREEalt = The combined model type carbon- 
related exhaust emissions value for 
operation on alcohol fuel as determined 
in § 600.208(b)(5)(ii); and 
CREEgas = The combined model type carbon- 
related exhaust emissions value for 
operation on gasoline or diesel fuel as 
determined in § 600.208(b)(5)(i). 
(vii) For natural gas dual fuel model 
types, for model years 2016 and later,

provisions of paragraph (k) of this 
section; 
CREEalt = The combined model type carbon- 
related exhaust emissions value for 
operation on natural gas as determined 
in § 600.208(b)(5)(ii); and 
CREEgas = The combined model type carbon- 
related exhaust emissions value for 
operation on gasoline or diesel fuel as 
determined in § 600.208(b)(5)(i). 
(3) The production volume of electric, 
fuel cell electric and plug-in hybrid 
electric model types for model years 
2012 through 2016 may be adjusted by 
the multiplier specified in 40 CFR 
86.1866–12(a) and in accordance with 
the provisions of 40 CFR 86.1866–12(a). 
The adjusted production volumes shall 
be accounted for both in the total 
production volume specified in 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section and in 
the model type production volume 
specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section. 
(k) Alternative in-use weighting 
factors for dual fuel model types. Using 
one of the methods in either paragraph 
(k)(1) or (2) of this section, 
manufacturers may request the use of 
alternative values for the weighting 
factor F in the equations in paragraphs 
(j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this section. Unless 
otherwise approved by the 
Administrator, the manufacturer must 
use the value of F that is in effect in 
paragraphs (j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this 
section. 
(1) Upon written request from a 
manufacturer, the Administrator will 
determine and publish by written 
guidance an appropriate value of F for 
each requested alternative fuel based on 
the Administrator’s assessment of real- 
world use of the alternative fuel. Such 
published values would be available for 
any manufacturer to use. The 
Administrator will periodically update 
these values upon written request from 
a manufacturer. 
(2) The manufacturer may optionally 
submit to the Administrator its own 
demonstration regarding the real-world 
use of the alternative fuel in their 
vehicles and its own estimate of the 
appropriate value of F in the equations 
in paragraphs (j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this 
section. Depending on the nature of the 
analytical approach, the manufacturer 
could provide estimates of F that are 
model type specific or that are generally 
applicable to the manufacturer’s dual 
fuel fleet. The manufacturer’s analysis 
could include use of data gathered from 
on-board sensors and computers, from 
dual fuel vehicles in fleets that are 
centrally fueled, or from other sources. 
The analysis must be based on sound 
statistical methodology and must 
account for analytical uncertainty. Any 
approval by the Administrator will 
pertain to the use of values of F for the 
model types specified by the 
manufacturer. 
51. A new § 600.512–12 is added to 
subpart F to read as follows: 
§ 600.512–12 Model year report. 
(a) For each model year, the 
manufacturer shall submit to the 
Administrator a report, known as the 
model year report, containing all 
information necessary for the 
calculation of the manufacturer’s 
average fuel economy and all 
information necessary for the 
calculation of the manufacturer’s 
average carbon-related exhaust 
emissions. 
(1) The results of the manufacturer 
calculations and summary information 
of model type fuel economy values 
which are contained in the average fuel 
economy calculation shall also be 
submitted to the Secretary of the 
Department of Transportation, National 
Highway and Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
(2) The results of the manufacturer 
calculations and summary information 
of model type carbon-related exhaust 
emission values which are contained in 
the average calculation shall be 
submitted to the Administrator. 
(b)(1) The model year report shall be 
in writing, signed by the authorized 
representative of the manufacturer and 
shall be submitted no later than 90 days 
after the end of the model year. 
(2) The Administrator may waive the 
requirement that the model year report 
be submitted no later than 90 days after 
the end of the model year. Based upon 
a request by the manufacturer, if the 
Administrator determines that 90 days 
is insufficient time for the manufacturer 
to provide all additional data required 
as determined in § 600.507, the 
Administrator shall establish an 
alternative date by which the model 
year report must be submitted. 
(3) Separate reports shall be submitted 
for passenger automobiles and light 
trucks (as identified in § 600.510). 
(c) The model year report must 
include the following information: 
(1)(i) All fuel economy data used in 
the FTP/HFET-based model type

(2) Specify the period during which 
the item must be withheld to avoid that 
damage; and 
(3) Show that earlier disclosure would 
result in that damage. 
(4) Each report required by this 
section must be based upon all 
information and data available to the 
manufacturer 30 days before the report 
is submitted to the Administrator. 
(b) General content of reports. (1) Pre- 
model year report. Except as provided 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each 
pre-model year report for each model 
year must contain the information 
required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. 
(2) Supplementary report. Each 
supplementary report must contain the 
information required by paragraph 
(e)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii), as appropriate.

under 40 CFR 600.506, when such 
determination is required. Each 
manufacturer that does not include 
information under the exception in the 
immediately preceding sentence shall 
indicate in its report the date by which 
it must submit that preliminary 
determination. 
(ii) The pre-model year report 
submitted by an incomplete automobile 
manufacturer for any model year is not 
required to contain the information 
specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv)(O) 
through (Q) and (c)(3)(v) of this section. 
The information provided by the 
incomplete automobile manufacturer 
under (c)(3) shall be according to base 
level instead of model type or carline. 
(c) Pre-model year reports. (1) Provide 
the information required by paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (3) of this section for the 
manufacturer’s passenger automobiles 
and light trucks for the current model

carbon-related exhaust emissions. (i) 
State the projected average carbon- 
related exhaust emissions for the 
manufacturer’s automobiles determined 
in accordance with § 600.510–12 and 
based upon the carbon-related exhaust 
emission values and projected sales 
figures provided under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section. 
(ii) State the projected final average 
carbon-related exhaust emissions value 
that the manufacturer anticipates having 
if changes implemented during the 
model year will cause that average to be 
different from the average carbon- 
related exhaust emissions projected 
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. 
(iii) State the projected required 
carbon-related exhaust emissions value 
for the manufacturer’s passenger 
automobiles and light trucks determined 
in accordance with 40 CFR 86.1818–12 
and based upon the projected sales 
figures provided under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section. 
(iv) State the projected final required 
carbon-related exhaust emissions value 
that the manufacturer anticipates having 
if changes implemented during the 
model year will cause the targets to be 
different from the target carbon-related 
exhaust emissions projected under 
paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. 
(v) State whether the manufacturer 
believes that the projections it provides 
under paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iv) 
of this section, or if it does not provide 
an average or target under those 
paragraphs, the projections it provides 
under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(iii) 
of this section, sufficiently represent the 
manufacturer’s average and target 
carbon-related exhaust emissions for the 
current model year. In the case of a 
manufacturer that believes that the 
projections are not sufficiently 
representative for those purposes, state 
the specific nature of any reason for the 
insufficiency and the specific additional 
testing or derivation of carbon-related 
exhaust emission values by analytical 
methods believed by the manufacturer 
necessary to eliminate the insufficiency 
and any plans of the manufacturer to 
undertake that testing or derivation 
voluntarily and submit the resulting 
data to the Environmental Protection 
Agency under 40 CFR 600.509. 
(vi) State the number of credits, if any, 
projected to be earned under the 
provisions of § 86.1866–12 and the

(e) Determination of carbon-related 
exhaust emission values and average 
carbon-related exhaust emissions. 
(1) Vehicle configuration carbon- 
related exhaust emission values. (i) For 
each vehicle configuration for which a 
carbon-related exhaust emission value is 
required under paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section and has been determined and 
approved under 40 CFR part 600, the 
manufacturer shall submit that carbon- 
related exhaust emission value. 
(ii) For each vehicle configuration 
specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this 
section for which a carbon-related 
exhaust emissions value approved 
under 40 CFR part 600, does not exist, 
but for which a carbon-related exhaust 
emissions value determined under that 
part exists, the manufacturer shall 
submit that carbon-related exhaust 
emissions value. 
(iii) For each vehicle configuration 
specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this 
section for which a carbon-related 
exhaust emissions value has been 
neither determined nor approved under 
40 CFR part 600, the manufacturer shall 
submit a carbon-related exhaust 
emissions value based on tests or 
analyses comparable to those prescribed 
or permitted under 40 CFR part 600 and 
a description of the test procedures or 
analytical methods used. 
(2) Base level and model type carbon- 
related exhaust emission values. For 
each base level and model type, the 
manufacturer shall submit a carbon- 
related exhaust emission value based on 
the values submitted under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section and calculated in 
the same manner as base level and 
model type carbon-related exhaust 
emission values are calculated for use 
under subpart F of 40 CFR part 600. 
(3) Average carbon-related exhaust 
emissions. Average carbon-related 
exhaust emissions must be based upon 
carbon-related exhaust emission values 
calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section for each model type and must be 
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 
600.506, using the configurations 
specified in 40 CFR 600.506(a)(2), 
except that carbon-related exhaust 
emission values for running changes 
and for new base levels are required 
only for those changes made or base 
levels added before the average carbon- 
related exhaust emission value is 
required to be submitted under this 
section. 
In consideration of the foregoing, 
under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 32901, 
32902, 32903, and 32907, and 
delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50,
