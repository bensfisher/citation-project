Executive Summary
Introduction
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead,
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied
facilities (COFs). 1 The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692)
and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has
been found to create lead hazards. Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint,
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed.
The 2008 LRRP regulations require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based
paint.
The proposed rule contains two major revisions to the LRRP program. The first revision is the removal
of the opt-out provision in 40 CFR §745.82(c), under which renovators do not need to follow the work
practices in the LRRP rule if they obtain a signed statement from the owner of a target housing unit
agreeing that the required LRRP work practices will not be used and stating that the renovation will occur
in the owner’s residence, no child under age 6 or pregnant woman resides there, and the housing is not a
COF. The second revision is a requirement that renovation firms provide owners and occupants with a
copy of the records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the
LRRP rule (referred to here as the “recordkeeping checklist requirement”).
Disturbing lead-based paint in renovation, repair, and painting events generates lead dust that is an
important source of lead exposure. Exposure to lead results in increased blood lead levels associated with
various adverse health effects. If EPA were to take no action, society would not incur the costs to comply
with the proposed rule, but the negative health and environmental effects due to these preventable lead
exposures would continue.
Number of Facilities Subject to the Rule
Table ES-1 provides summary information about the numbers of structures affected by the rule’s
requirements. There are 78 million target housing units and COFs, composed of 77.9 million target
housing units and 0.1 million COFs in public or commercial buildings. The 2008 LRRP rule applied to
37.7 million target housing units and 0.1 million public and commercial buildings. About 40.2 million
1 Target housing is defined as any housing constructed before 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities
(unless any child under age 6 resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0-bedroom dwelling. A COF is
defined as a building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978, visited regularly by the same child, under 6 years
of age, on at least two different days within any week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that each day’s visit lasts
at least 3 hours and the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the combined annual visits last at least 60 hours.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-2
target housing units would be added to the regulated universe due to the elimination of the opt-out
provision. The recordkeeping checklist provision of the proposed rule would apply to all 78 million
target housing units and COFs.

Target housing: Owner-occupied housing where no child <age 6

COF in target housing, or a child <age 6 or pregnant woman
resides in housing X 37,665,000
Subtotal – all target housing 77,888,000
COFs in public or commercial - covered by 2008 LRRP rule X 97,000
Total 77,985,000
Note: Number of structures includes buildings with and without lead-based paint.
Estimated number of structures affected by the removal of the opt-out provision assumes that all owners of target
housing eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008 LRRP rule would have chosen to opt-out.
Rule Options Analyzed
This economic analysis considers a variety of options for addressing the risks created by renovation,
repair, and painting (RRP) activities disturbing lead-based paint in housing previously eligible for the opt-
out provision. These options include different alternatives for the effective date of the rule; an option
phasing out the opt-out provision depending on when the housing was built; and different options for the
work practices requirements.
Options A through D all apply the 2008 LRRP requirements to renovations in the housing previously
eligible for the opt-out provision. However, the date when the opt-out provision would be eliminated
differs across options A through D. Options E1 through E4 all have the same effective date, but have
varying work practice requirements. Table ES-2 summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they
are described in more detail below.
Options A and D both start eliminating the opt-out provision in June 2010, but Option A removes it for all
houses in June 2010 while Option D allows the owners of houses built between 1960 and 1978 to
continue to opt out until June 2011. Options B and C have effective dates of January 2011 and June 2011
(respectively) for the complete elimination of the opt-out provision.
Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of regulated structures as Option A,
but include alternative work practice requirements. Option E1 has the same containment requirements as
the 2008 LRRP rule, but does not include any cleaning or cleaning verification work practices. Option E2
has the same cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as the 2008 LRRP rule, but does not include
any containment work practices. Option E3 has the same cleaning requirements as the 2008 LRRP rule,
but does not include any containment or cleaning verification work practices. Option E4 has the same
containment, cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as the 2008 LRRP rule, but does not restrict
or prohibit any paint removal practices.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-3
All the options would also require renovation firms to provide owners and occupants of the buildings with
a copy of the records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the
LRRP rule. The effective date for the recordkeeping checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options.

*The effective date for the recordkeeping checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options.
Costs
The costs associated with the revisions to the §402(c) LRRP Rule are divided into four categories: (1)
work practice costs, (2) training costs, (3) certification costs (which include the firm’s paperwork burden
and EPA administrative and enforcement costs), and (4) recordkeeping checklist provision costs.2 The
costs associated with the first three components are all attributable to the elimination of the opt-out
provision, which will extend the 2008 LRRP rule requirements to additional housing units. In addition to
the work practice costs associated with the RRP events in these housing units, this change is predicted to
result in more individuals and firms seeking training and certification.3 The fourth component,
recordkeeping checklist provision costs, applies to all renovations regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule as
well as the additional housing units that would no longer be eligible for the opt-out provision.
2 Note that the costs of the proposed action as estimated in the Economic Analysis are expressed in 2005 dollars. The estimated
costs would be approximately 10 percent higher if they were adjusted to be expressed in 2009$.
3 This analysis assumes that renovation firms are somewhat specialized in terms of whether they work in facilities where the RRP
program is applicable. However, there may be many instances where firms working in opt-out housing will already have
become certified, and their staff been trained, because they also work in regulated facilities ineligible for the opt-out
provision. If firms are less specialized than the analysis assumed, there may be little to no incremental training and
certification costs due to the proposed rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-4
Costs are driven, in part, by the additional number of renovation, repair, and painting (RRP) events where
renovators test for lead-based paint once the opt-out provision is removed; and the subset of these events
that test positive for lead-based paint and where RRP is performed using the lead-safe cleaning,
containment, and verification practices required by the rule (referred to as lead-safe work practice events).
The number of events under each option is summarized in Table ES-3 and is compared with the number
of events regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule. The differences in the number of events in the first year
for options A through D are due to variation in the date the opt-out provision is eliminated, so the
differences in the costs estimated for Options A through D are all due to the timing of the opt-out
elimination. And since Options A and E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of
regulated structures, the cost differences among these options are all attributable to their different work
practice costs.
Because not all buildings built before 1978 have lead-based paint, the number of renovation events that
need to use lead safe work practices (LSWP) is a subset of the total number of events covered by the rule.
Currently available test kits for detecting whether lead-based paint is present have a high false positive
rate resulting in the frequent use of lead safe work practices when they are not necessary, i.e., when lead-
based paint is not present. EPA is working on the development of test kits that accurately identify both
the presence and absence of lead in paint at levels that exceed the Federal standards. This analysis
assumes that improved test kits will be in use starting in June 2011. Thus, the number of events with lead
safe work practices is estimated to decrease from the first year to the second year because of the adoption
of the improved test kits.

Table ES-4 indicates the component costs that comprise the total cost for Option A. Work practice costs
in housing formerly eligible for the opt-out provision represents the largest share of total costs of the
proposed rule.

Total $507 $279 $260 $320
In addition to the number of renovation events complying with the rule, other major factors in
determining the costs of the rule revisions are the additional number of firms certified and the additional
number of renovators and workers trained. The elimination of the opt-out provision is predicted to result
in more individuals and firms seeking training and certification in order to meet the increased demand for
RRP performed by certified firms and trained renovators resulting from the increase in the number of
events where it will be required. Each renovation project covered by the LRRP rule must be performed
by a certified firm and the work must be performed and/or directed by an individual who has become a
certified renovator by successfully completing renovator training from an accredited training provider.
The renovation activities may be performed by workers who have been provided on-the-job training by a
certified renovator. However, the certified renovator must be physically present at the work site while
signs are being posted, containment is being established, and the work area is being cleaned after the
renovation to ensure that these tasks are performed correctly.
Table ES-5 presents a summary of the estimated increase in the number of establishments that will seek
firm certification each year as a result of the removal of the opt-out provision, as well as the increase in
the estimated number of employees that will need to be trained as renovators and workers in the first three
years, and compares this to prior estimates for the 2008 LRRP rule.

Results for the proposed rule options only include the events affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision. These numbers
are incremental to the estimates for the 2008 LRRP rule (in the shaded row).
Analysis assumes a 75% compliance rate with the rule.
The estimates presented in Table ES-5 reflect the simplifying assumption that additional initial
certification and training due to the removal of the opt-out provision takes place over a 12 month period
starting from the effective date. For example, it is estimated that an additional 127 thousand trained
renovators would be necessary to meet the increased demand after the elimination of the opt-out
provision, so under Option A all 127 thousand are assumed to be trained from June 2010 through June
2011. Under Option B, the opt-out provision is eliminated half-way through the first year (January 2011).
Thus, half of the 127 thousand, or 56 thousand renovators, are assumed to incur the training costs in the
first year. Since the opt-out provision is not eliminated until the second year under Option C (June 2011),
it is assumed that no training costs are incurred in the first year under Option C. A simplifying
assumption was necessary because it is not possible to predict the precise timing of the training and
certification that would occur under the various options. In reality, any additional firms and renovators
that become certified and trained because of the removal of the opt-out provision may do so before the
removal of the opt-out provision goes into effect. Thus, under Option C, it is unlikely that there would
actually be zero firms certified or renovators trained in the first year after promulgation of the rule.
Benefits
A great deal of information on the numerous adverse health effects of lead is available from decades of
medical observation and scientific research. Inhaled or ingested lead is distributed throughout the body
and is toxic to many organ systems. As a result, its toxicity manifests itself in the form of impacts on
several organ systems. A reduction in lead exposure resulting from the rule would lead to a reduction in
these adverse health effects and the costs of treating them. Young children (from birth through age five)
are particularly sensitive to lead, which impairs a child’s neuropsychological development (frequently
measured by IQ change).
These cognitive and behavioral effects, discussed above, are strongly related to future productivity and
expected earnings. The estimated value of an IQ point is approximately $13,000, which represents the
present value of a loss in expected lifetime earnings due to a one point IQ drop. This estimated value of
an IQ point is limited to reduced income, and does not include other potential impacts such as additional
education costs for special and remedial education, and medical costs to treat very high levels of lead.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-7
Investigating associations between lead exposure and behavior, mood, and social conduct of children has
been an emerging area of research. Early studies indicated linkages between lower-level lead toxicity and
behavioral problems (e.g., aggression, attentional problems, and hyperactivity) in children. Blood-lead
and tooth-lead levels have been associated with behavioral features of attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), including distractibility, poor organization, lack of persistence in completing tasks, and
daydreaming, in various cohorts of children with a wide range of lead exposures. The relationship
between lead exposure and delinquent and criminal behavior also has been addressed in several
investigations. Studies linking attention deficits, aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and poor self-
regulation with lead have raised the prospect that early exposure may result in an increased likelihood of
engaging in antisocial behaviors in later life. Elevated lead levels have been associated with several
measures of behavioral disturbance and delinquent behavior.
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and increased
hypertension.
Both epidemiologic and toxicologic studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead affect
many different organ systems. Neurotoxic effects in children and cardiovascular effects in adults are
among those best substantiated as occurring at blood-lead concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ug/dL (or
possibly lower); and these categories of effects are currently of greatest public health concern. Other
newly demonstrated immune and renal system effects among general population groups are also emerging
as low-level lead exposure effects of potential public health concern. It appears that some of these
effects, particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's
neurobehavioral development, may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a
threshold.
The proposed rule’s removal of the opt-out provision will apply the LRRP program’s work practices,
training and certification requirements to renovations in all target housing and COFs (including housing
previously eligible for the opt-out provision). This will reduce lead exposure by increasing the
containment and cleanup of dust and debris generated by RRP activities. Additional reductions in lead
exposure will be achieved by prohibiting the use of certain paint preparation and removal techniques in
jobs that require lead-safe work practices. These reductions in exposure will in turn reduce the risks of
adverse health and ecological effects in the vicinity of these activities.
The proposed requirement that renovators provide the owners and occupants of renovated buildings with
copies of the records renovation firms must maintain to document compliance with the rule’s training and
work practice requirements will enable building owners and occupants to better understand what the
renovation firm did to comply with the rule and how the rule’s provisions affected their specific
renovation. Educating the owners and occupants in this way is likely to help them to be better able to
protect themselves from lead-based paint hazards that may have been created by the renovation and
improve their ability to assist the EPA in monitoring compliance with the LRRP rule. These
improvements in education and monitoring will improve compliance with the rule, which will ultimately
protect children and adults from exposure to lead hazards due to renovation activities.
Removing the opt-out provision will protect children and adults from exposure to lead dust from
renovations in a variety of situations. They include children under the age of six who visit a friend,
relative, or caregiver’s house where a renovation has been performed under the opt-out provision;
children who move into such housing when their family purchases it after such a renovation has been
performed; and children who live in a property adjacent to housing where renovation has been performed
under the opt-out provision. Removing the opt-out provision will also protect individuals age 6 and older
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-8
who live in houses that were renovated under the opt-out provision; who move into such housing after
such a renovation has been performed; and who live in adjacent properties.
In addition, removal of the opt-out provision will provide additional protection for women who do not
know they are pregnant at the time a renovation commences, women who become pregnant shortly after a
renovation occurs, and women of child-bearing age in general. This is particularly important because the
transplacental transfer of lead in humans is well documented, and infants are generally born with a lead
body burden reflecting that of the mother.
Removing the opt-out provision will also result in fewer homes being purchased with pre-existing lead
hazards. It is common for home owners to perform activities that disturb paint before selling a house.
Removing the opt-out provision decreases the likelihood of lead hazards being present when new
occupants move into the home.
Eliminating the opt-out provision will also protect individuals residing adjacent to homes undergoing
renovations. Renovations on the exterior of a residence can spread leaded dust and debris some distance
from the renovation activity. There are approximately 1.6 million owner-occupied single-family attached
homes built before 1978 eligible for the opt-out provision. If these homeowners opt out of the LRRP
program, renovations on the exterior of these homes are likely to contaminate neighboring yards and
porches, resulting in exposure inside the neighboring houses as well as outside (because exterior dust is
tracked into the home). Many more single-family detached homes are located in close proximity to each
other, and renovations performed under the opt-out provision present a similar risk for these homes.
Removing the opt-out provision will also provide protection to family pets living in owner-occupied
housing where no children under age 6 or pregnant women reside. Lead poisoning resulting from
renovations has been documented in both cats and dogs, resulting in both veterinary care costs and, in
some instances, loss of a family pet.
EPA has calculated crude benefits numbers for several groups of individuals protected by removing the
opt-out provision. This has been done by estimating the number of individuals in each group and
combining this with the average benefit per individual for a similar group from previous LRRP rule
analyses. These averages do not replicate the scenarios used in the previous analyses, which included an
array of factors such as age of child, type of renovation, size of job, and building vintage, so the
calculations in this chapter do not reflect the methodology that EPA previously had peer reviewed for the
LRRP rule analysis.
As a result of severe time constraints for the conduct of this analysis, the average benefits per individual
from the previous analyses have not been modified to reflect any differences in exposure between
populations protected by the 2008 rule and those protected by the removal of the opt-out provision.
While these values can serve as a proxy to provide a sense of the magnitude of benefits from this action,
the amount of error in these values is unknown.
Estimating benefits from avoided lead exposure is not an issue that lends itself to simplified calculations.
Thus, the benefits calculations used here should be viewed as crude indicators of the magnitude of
benefits. In light of this, the analysis calculates benefits under two different scenarios. In one of the
scenarios, aggregate benefits are based on average benefits per individual from previous analyses
multiplied by an estimate of the number of people affected by the proposed rule. In the second scenario,
benefits are calculated by applying a simple linear adjustment factor to one of the components in the first
scenario, in order to reflect the uncertainties created by relying on the average benefit per individual from
previous analyses as a basis for the calculation.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-10
Small Entity Impacts
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996, requires regulators to assess the effects of regulations on small entities
including businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments. The vast majority of entities in the
industries affected by the proposed rule are small. The small entity impact analysis considers firms that
would seek certification as a result of the elimination of the opt-out provision (opt-out entities) separately
from the firms that are currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule (currently regulated entities). The
proposed revisions to the renovation, repair, and painting program will affect approximately 289,000
small entities; of those small entities, it is predicted that up to 101,000 will incur certification, work
practice, and training costs as a result of the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision.
Two factors are evaluated in analyzing the rule’s impacts on small entities, (1) the number of firms that
would experience the impact, and (2) the size of the impact. Average annual compliance costs as a
percentage of average annual revenues are used to assess the potential average impact of the rule on small
businesses and small governments. This ratio is a good measure of entities’ ability to afford the costs
attributable to a regulatory requirement, because comparing compliance costs to revenues provides a
reasonable indication of the magnitude of the regulatory burden relative to a commonly available measure
of economic activity. Where regulatory costs represent a small fraction of a typical entity’s revenues, the
financial impacts of the regulation on such entities may be considered as not significant. For non-profit
organizations, impacts are measured by comparing rule costs to the organization’s annual expenditures.
When expenditure data were not available, however, revenue information was used as a proxy for
expenditures. It is appropriate to calculate the impact ratios using annualized costs, because these costs
are more representative of the continuing costs entities face to comply with the rule.
There are approximately 101,000 small entities that would be affected by the removal of the opt-out
provision. The average annualized cost to a typical small entity in this group is estimated to range from
about $1,133 to $6,408 per year, depending on the number of renovation, repair, and painting events
undertaken by a small entity in the industry sector involved. As shown in Table ES-8, the cost impact of
the proposed revisions on small opt-out entities ranges from about 0.8 percent to 1.7 percent of revenues,
depending on the industry sector. (If renovation firms are less specialized than the analysis assumed, in
terms of whether they work in facilities where the RRP program is applicable, impacts will be lower than
calculated because some firms that also work in regulated facilities ineligible for the opt-out provision
will already have incurred costs for training and certification.)
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-11
There are approximately 189,000 small entities that are not predicted to be affected by the removal of the
opt-out provision, but that are expected to be affected by the additional recordkeeping requirements.
These are all entities that were previously assumed to be affected by the 2008 LRRP rule. For a typical
small entity in this group, the average annualized cost of the proposed rule is estimated to range from
about $1 to $283 per year, depending on the number of RRP events undertaken by a small entity in the
industry sector involved. As shown in Table ES-9, the cost impact on currently regulated small entities
ranges from about 0.0001 percent to 0.08 percent of revenues, depending on the industry sector.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule ES-13
Some of the small entities subject to the rule have employees while others are non-employers. The non-
employers typically perform fewer jobs than firms with employees, and thus have lower work practice
compliance costs. However, they also have lower average revenues than entities with employees, so their
impacts (measured as costs divided by revenues) can be higher. Impact estimates for non-employers
should be interpreted with caution, as some non-employers may have issues related to understatement of
income, which would tend to exaggerate the average impact ratio for this class of small entities.
As shown in Table ES-11, there are 75,000 non-employer renovation contractors estimated to be affected
by the removal of the opt-out provision. The average cost to these contractors is estimated to be $1,193
apiece. This represents 1.3% to 4.7% of reported revenues, depending on the industry sector. This
proposed rule’s new recordkeeping requirement is estimated to affect an additional 96,000 non-employer
renovation contractors not affected by removal of the opt-out provision. The costs to these contractors are
estimated to be $42 apiece. This represents 0.05% to 0.17% of revenues, depending on the industry
sector.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 1-1
1. Introduction
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead,
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied
facilities (COFs). The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692)
and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
The existing LRRP regulations require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based
paint.
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has
been found to create lead hazards. Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint,
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed.
The proposed revisions to the LRRP program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision for owner-
occupied target housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence, and
(2) an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners
and occupants of renovated structures.
1.1 Purpose of the LRRP Rule Revisions
Removing the opt-out provision will protect individuals (including children under age 6 and pregnant
women), who visit, move into, or live adjacent to a home renovated under the opt-out provision, from
exposure to lead hazards due to renovation activities. Requiring renovators to provide owners and
occupants of renovated buildings with copies of the records documenting the renovation firm’s
compliance with the rule’s training and work practice requirements will enable them to better understand
what the renovation firm did to comply with the rule and improve their ability to assist the EPA in
monitoring compliance with the RRP rule. EPA anticipates that the rule will further develop a market1
for lead safe renovation services that has been established by past lead rules.
The LRRP rule requires certification of entities that perform renovation, repair and/or painting in
buildings covered by the regulations. This includes construction contractors (including sole practitioners)
as well as landlords and other building owners (such as school districts) that may perform RRP activities
using their own staff. It does not, however, cover renovation, repair and painting (RRP) work performed
by homeowners on their own homes. The certified entity must ensure that all persons performing RRP
activities on behalf of the entity in buildings covered by the rule are either renovators who have received
formal training in EPA-approved work practices from an EPA-accredited course or workers who have
received on-the-job training in these approved work practices. In addition, the rule requires the use of
these approved work practices to ensure that proper cleanup has occurred. Supporting these work
practices, training and certification requirements, EPA is undertaking an enhanced outreach program to
1 These markets are expected to consist of suppliers who offer lead safe renovation services (LSRS) and consumers
who are willing to pay the incremental costs associated with using LSRS over non-LSRS.

educate the general public about the dangers of lead exposure and ways to limit exposure resulting from
RRP activities.
1.2 Goal of the Economic Analysis
The purpose of this report is to analyze various options for the LRRP rulemaking revisions. The report
addresses the requirements for economic analysis of Executive Order 12866 – Regulatory Planning and
Review; the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness
Act (SBRFA); Executive Order 12898 – Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations; Executive Order 13045 – Protection of Children from
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks; the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; Executive Order
12875 – Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership; and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).
This economic analysis considers various regulatory options. The effective date for the recordkeeping
checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options. Options A through D all include containment,
cleaning, and cleaning verification requirements, as well as restricting or prohibiting certain paint removal
practices. However, options A through D differ in terms of the effective dates of the elimination of the
opt-out provision. In addition, the economic analysis considers four options with varying work practice
requirements, Options E1 through E4. Table 1-1 summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they
are described in more detail below.
Options A and D both have effective dates of June 2010 for the elimination of the opt-out provision, but
Option A does not phase in the opt-out elimination while Option D is limits opt-out elimination to pre-
1960 structures during Phase 1 of the regulation and expands the requirements to structures built between
1960 and 1978 in Phase 2, which has an effective date of June 2011. Options B and C have effective
dates of January 2011 and June 2011 for the elimination of the opt-out provision respectively, and neither
option phases in this requirement.
Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of regulated structures as Option A,
but consider alternative work practice requirements. Option E1 has the same containment requirements
as 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any cleaning or cleaning verification work practices. Option E2
has the same cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any
containment work practices. Option E3 has the same cleaning requirements as 40 CFR 745.85, but does
not include any containment or cleaning verification work practices. Option E4 has the same
containment, cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as 40 CFR 745.85, but does not restrict or
prohibit any paint removal practices.

1.3 Organization of this Report
Chapter 2 profiles the RRP industry, as well as non-profit and governmental suppliers of childcare
including family daycare providers. It examines the supply of and demand for renovation, remodeling and
painting services. Using data from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Economic Census, the chapter
discusses the size of the RRP industry and characteristics of its firms, as well as the organizational
structure and competitiveness of the industry. The demand for RRP services is characterized and the
factors that affect demand are discussed. Other affected industries (e.g. training providers, property
owners and managers) are also profiled in this chapter.
Chapter 3 characterizes the lead contamination problem to be addressed under the proposed rule. It
discusses how incomplete information and external costs have resulted in inefficient levels of lead
contamination resulting from renovation activity, and introduces regulation as a reasonable solution for
these market failures. The chapter also reviews state and local regulations that affect RRP activities and
demonstrates that these are not sufficient to address the problem.
Chapter 4 describes in detail the methods used to calculate costs of the various regulatory options
considered. It describes the data sources used and is organized around the four general categories of costs
incurred under the proposed rule: work practice compliance costs, training costs, certification and
administrative costs, and checklist provision costs. The last section of the chapter estimates the costs of
each option over a 50-year period and presents annualized costs at both 3 percent and 7 percent.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 1-4
Chapter 5 calculates crude benefits numbers for several groups of individuals protected by removing the
opt-out provision. While these values can serve as a proxy to provide a sense of the magnitude of benefits
from this action, the amount of error in these values is unknown.
Chapter 6 presents findings of distributional analyses relevant to specific rule-making requirements,
including small business impacts, environmental justice, protection of children and unfunded mandates.

2. Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting Industry Profile
The LRRP rule for target housing and child occupied facilities (COFs) was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR
21692) and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
The existing LRRP regulations apply to entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in target housing or child occupied facilities, including building owners or managers who
use their own staff to conduct RRP activities. These entities must become certified by EPA, ensure that
their employees are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when
disturbing lead-based paint.
The proposed revisions to the LRRP program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision for owner-
occupied target housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence, (2)
an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners
and occupants of renovated structures, and (3) clarifications and other technical changes to the LRRP
program that do not have cost implications.
Target housing is defined in section 401 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as any housing
constructed before 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child
under age 6 resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0-bedroom dwelling.
A COF is defined under the rule in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §745.83, as:
Child-occupied facility means a building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978,
visited regularly by the same child, under 6 years of age, on at least two different days within any
week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that each day’s visit lasts at least 3 hours and
the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the combined annual visits last at least 60
hours. Child-occupied facilities may include, but are not limited to, day care centers, preschools
and kindergarten classrooms. Child-occupied facilities may be located in target housing or in
public and commercial buildings. With respect to common areas in public and commercial
buildings that contain child-occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility encompasses only
those common areas that are routinely used by children under age 6, such as restrooms and
cafeterias. Common areas that children under age 6 only pass through, such as hallways,
stairways, and garages are not included. In addition, for public and commercial buildings that
contain child-occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility encompasses only the exterior sides
of the building that are immediately adjacent to the child-occupied facility or the common areas
routinely used by children under age 6.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-2
The term renovation is defined in 40 CFR §745.83 to encompass a wide variety of construction activities:
Renovation means the modification of any existing structure, or portion thereof, that results in the
disturbance of painted surfaces, unless that activity is performed as part of an abatement as
defined by this part (40 CFR § 745.223). The term renovation includes (but is not limited to): the
removal, modification or repair of painted surfaces or painted components (e.g., modification of
painted doors, surface restoration, window repair, surface preparation activity (such as sanding,
scraping, or other such activities that may generate paint dust)); the removal of building
components (e.g., walls, ceilings, plumbing, windows); weatherization projects (e.g., cutting
holes in painted surfaces to install blown-in insulation or to gain access to attics, planing
thresholds to install weather-stripping), and interim controls that disturb painted surfaces. A
renovation performed for the purpose of converting a building, or part of a building, into target
housing or a child-occupied facility is a renovation under this subpart.
Thus, renovation includes repair work as well as painting work involving sanding, scraping, or other paint
removal. Renovation activities are conducted without the intent of removing lead, but may disturb it in
the process. Lead abatement activities, on the other hand, are conducted with the intent to remove lead-
based paint or otherwise permanently eliminate a lead-based paint hazard. Depending on the reason they
are undertaken, many activities, such as replacing windows, can be either renovation or abatement.
Because the rule will address renovation, rather than abatement activity, this profile characterizes the
renovation industry as opposed to the abatement services industry.
The industry profile is categorized into eight sections. Section 2.1 discusses the supply of contractor-
provided renovation services. Section 2.2 presents information on the numbers and types of child care
facilities and schools. Section 2.3 presents information on the number and sizes of non-residential
property owners and managers likely to be affected by the rule. Section 2.4 focuses on the demand-side
of renovation by identifying the quantity of renovation activities performed. Section 2.5 discusses the
overall market organization for the renovation industry. Section 2.6 describes the residential property
owner and manager industry. Section 2.7 discusses training providers. Section 2.8 provides an overview
of the structures that would be affected by the revisions to the LRRP rule.
2.1 Contractors that Supply Renovation Services
Data from the U.S. Economic Census were used to identify the North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS) industry groups that may provide renovation, repair and painting work (U.S. Census
Bureau 2004a). An establishment is assigned to a NAICS group based on the activities from which it
derives the greatest share of its revenues. These activities may or may not make up the majority of work
(i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related
(or unrelated) lines of work. The analysis identified 12 NAICS codes that are likely to include the vast
majority of construction-related establishments that will be affected by the rule. Affected industry groups
include two building construction sectors (NAICS 236118 – Residential Remodelers; and NAICS 236220
– Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) and ten specialty trade contractor sectors.
The number of contracting establishments affected is also discussed in Chapter 4. This profile examines
the financial and employment characteristics of construction establishments likely to provide renovation
work in child-occupied facilities.
NAICS sectors likely to perform projects regulated under the LRRP rule, as well as examples of the work
they perform, are presented in Table 2-1.

2.1.1 Number of Establishments with Employees
The U.S. Economic Census tracks businesses with paid employees (employer establishments) and non-
employer establishments (self-employed contractors) separately.1 This discussion deals with employer
establishments only; non-employers are addressed in the next section.
Table 2-2 presents both the number of establishments and the number of employees in each NAICS group
of interest. The number of establishments “includes all establishments that were in business at any time
during the year are included. Construction establishments that were inactive or idle for the entire year
were not included” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006a). Table 2-2 also presents the average per-establishment
employment numbers by NAICS code. The average employment numbers are small for all affected
sectors. Overall, Other Building Equipment contractors have the largest number of employees per
establishment (20.8 people), while Residential Remodelers have the smallest (3.9 people).

Table 2-3 presents the total number of employees and the number of construction workers in each
identified industry. The number of employees “includes all full-time and part-time individuals on the
payrolls of construction establishments during any part of the pay period which included the 12th of
March, May, August, and November” (U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). The number of construction
workers “includes all payroll workers (up through the working supervisory level) directly engaged in
construction operations, such as painters, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians… journeymen,
mechanics…truck drivers and helpers.” Non-construction employees include “payroll employees in
executive, purchasing, accounting, …and routine office functions” (U.S. Census Bureau 2005m).
Because construction workers form the vast majority of the people who require training under the rule,
1 Data at the firm level were not available for these NAICS groups when the analysis was performed.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-5
their role in the composition of each sector’s labor force provides an indication of the extent to which
each sector will be affected by the regulations.
In total, about 3.8 million people work for the 394,365 establishments in the potentially affected
industries. About 73 percent of these employees are construction workers. The affected sectors differ in
terms of the composition of their labor force. For example, construction workers make up 84 percent of
employees in the Drywall and Insulation contractor sector. In the Residential Remodelers sector,
however, construction workers make up only 65 percent of the labor force (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c)
2.1.2 Number of Non-Employer Establishments
As mentioned above, the U.S. Economic Census tracks non-employer establishments separately from
establishments with employees. Data on the number of non-employer establishments were available from
the U.S. Small Business Administration. A non-employer firm “is defined as one that has no paid
employees, has annual business receipts of $1,000 or more ($1 or more in the construction industries),
and is subject to federal income taxes” (U.S. Small Business Administration 2006a). Essentially, non-
employers are self-employed contractors. Because little financial and operational data is available for
non-employers, the vast majority of this profile focuses on establishments with employees. This
subsection discusses the number of non-employers in the affected industry sectors and the receipts of
these establishments.
The U.S. Small Business Administration did not provide data on the number or revenues of non-employer
establishments in each of the 6-digit level NAICS industries addressed in this profile. Data on the
number of such establishments was available for Plumbing and HVAC contractors (NAICS 238220) and
Electrical contractors (NAICS 238210) only; for the remaining industries, data was provided at the more
general 4-digit NAICS level. In total, there are nearly 1.2 million self-employed contractors.
To estimate the number of non-employer establishments in each of the 6-digit sectors, it was assumed that
the distribution of non-employer establishments in each 4-digit NAICS code is the same as the
distribution of establishments with payroll in the same 4-digit group. Similarly, to estimate the revenues

same as the distribution of revenues of payroll establishments in the same 4-digit industry.

2.1.3 Financial Profile
In this section, Census data is used to examine key financial indicators for the renovation industry. The
indicators include net value of construction (value of construction less value of construction
subcontracted out to others) and labor costs. Net value of construction work is used instead of the total
value of construction work because it is a measure of the work actually performed by the establishment.
Table 2-5 presents the average per establishment net value of construction work (NVCW) for each
industry sector. The table also presents labor costs as a percent of the net value of construction for each
of the affected NAICS codes.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-7
Table 2-5 shows the wide range of values of construction work per establishment across all NAICS codes
of interest. The average establishment in the Residential Remodeler industry (NAICS 236118) has the
smallest net value of construction work ($370,000), followed by the Finish Carpentry contractors industry
($446,000). Meanwhile, the average establishment in the Commercial Building Construction industry
(NAICS 236220) has the largest net value of construction value ($2,909,000), with the Other Building
Equipment contractors industry netting the second largest value ($2,247,000). It should come as no
surprise that the Commercial Building Construction industry’s net value of construction is so much larger
than the Residential Remodeler industry’s net value of construction work given that commercial building
construction projects tend to be substantially larger in scope and size than residential remodeling projects.
As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the
industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering
contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of
construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor
cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S.
Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small
percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to
covering the cost of materials and profit.

2.1.3.1 Establishment Size by Revenue Bracket
The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business in both the Residential Remodeler
and Commercial Building Construction industries as one that has revenues of $33.5 million dollars a year
or less. The small business definition for the ten specialty contractor industries is $14 million per year
(U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). The SBA size standards apply to firms rather than
establishments; at the time the analysis was performed, revenue data in the 2002 Economic Census was
only available at the establishment level. Since a firm may consist of one establishment, a few
establishments or even a very large number of establishments, by using establishment rather than firm
data, this analysis overestimates the number of small businesses in the affected industry.
The remainder of this section examines the number of establishments, number of employees, net value of
construction work and value of business done2 distributed by establishment revenue bracket. These data
were available from the 2002 Economic Census at the NAICS code level only. Establishments were
classified into two revenue categories based on the total value of business done – those with revenues less
that $10 million and those with revenues greater than $10 million. Because the Census groups all
establishments with revenues of $10 million or more into one revenue bracket, it is not possible to
determine what percentage of Residential Remodeler nor Commercial Building Construction
establishments have revenues of less than $33.5 million. Note, however, that nearly 100 percent of
Residential Remodeler establishments have revenues of less than $10 million per year. The same cannot
be said for Commercial Building Construction establishments, as 12 percent have revenues greater than
$10 million per year. The percent of establishments, employees and net value of construction contributed
by establishments in each revenue bracket is presented in Table 2-6.
2 Value of business done is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as including “the sum of value of construction work
and other business receipts. Value of business done is the sum of receipts, billings, or sales from establishments of
construction business activities plus receipts from other business activities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2004d).

The distribution of the number of establishments for all twelve NAICS codes is greatly skewed toward
smaller establishments. In five out of twelve industry sectors, over 99.5 percent of establishments have
revenues below $10 million. For the remaining sectors, establishments with revenues greater than $10
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-10
million make up less than 5 percent of establishments in any sector (with the exception of the Commercial
Building Construction industry where 12% of establishments earn more than $10 million in revenues3).
Thus, about 98 percent of all establishments in the affected industries have revenues well below the SBA
definition of small business.
Establishments with revenues of less than $10 million account for between 41 and 95 percent of total
employment for each sector, and about 69 percent of employment overall. The distribution of the net
value of construction work and the total value of business done is skewed toward smaller establishments
in a manner similar to the distribution of employees. Establishments with revenues of less than $10
million account for between 30 and 92 percent of the net value of construction work and between 24 and
91 percent of the total value of business done in each sector. It is worth mentioning that if the
Commercial Building Construction industry is removed, the lows in the previously cited categories jump
to 55 percent. Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 58 percent of the net
value of construction work and 50% of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau
2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m).
2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done
In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly
on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total
establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments. Figure 2-1 examines labor and
material costs, as well as the cost of construction work subcontracted out as a percentage of the total value
of business done for the twelve affected sectors. While the rule will increase the cost of material slightly,
the major impact will be on labor costs, including the training of staff. Each of the sectors was broken
down into two size categories by revenue bracket: less than $10 million and $10 million and more. The
cost of labor, of materials, and of construction work subcontracted out was summed across the 12 industry
sectors for large and for small establishments. These values were then compared to their total value of
business.
Labor costs, material costs, and the cost of construction work subcontracted out as a percentage of total
value of business done are presented in Figure 2-1. Regardless of size of establishments, material costs
tend to be a slightly larger percentage of total revenues than do labor costs. Labor costs make up about 25
percent of revenues for small establishments and about 16 percent for large establishments. Based on
Census data, large establishments subcontract out a much larger percentage of their work than do small
businesses.
3 Once again, this difference arises because of the larger size of a majority of Commercial building construction
projects. Regardless, if only 12% earn revenues greater than $10 million, it can easily be assumed that a much
smaller percentage of establishments in this industry earn revenues greater than the SBA cutoff of $33.5
million.

2.2 Child Care and Schools: Child Occupied Facilities
For the purposes of analysis, COFs are divided into the following categories4:
 Kindergartens and Pre-Kindergartens in Schools: Located in public and private schools;
 Daycare centers: Organized (licensed) facilities located in public and commercial buildings;
 Family daycare: Organized (licensed) daycare facilities located in the provider’s home; and
 Informal daycare: Informal (i.e. not licensed) day care providers, including relatives and non-
relatives. Some of these providers may be paid for their services.
There is a great deal of diversity and complexity in the childcare industry. The formal childcare sector
consists primarily of two types of facilities – center-based care and family daycare. Daycare centers are
typically located in commercial or educational buildings, including schools and university campuses.
They include private for-profit and non-profit facilities that can operate as independent centers or as part
of chains. For-profit facilities can be found in office buildings, factories, other workplace settings, or in
stand-alone facilities. Non-profit facilities may be found in YMCAs or other community centers,
churches, college and university campuses, as well as in office or stand-alone buildings. Government
4 The analysis is limited to kindergartens, pre-schools, daycare centers, family daycare, and informal daycare. Due
to a lack of data, it does not include other facilities that may qualify as COFs under the rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-12
education and human services agencies also provide daycare through programs such as Head Start, as
well as through kindergarten and pre-kindergarten programs at local schools.
Unlike center-based care, family daycare is typically offered in the home of the caregiver. Family
daycare facilities tend to serve smaller groups of children and have a smaller child-to-caregiver ratio
(KeepKidsHealthy 2001). In addition to formal care provided by daycare centers, schools, and family
daycare, children may also be cared for informally by relatives, family friends, or other acquaintances.
Informal care may be paid or unpaid, and usually takes place at the home of either the child or the
provider.
Table 2-7 summarizes the types and numbers of facilities and childcare providers in this universe,
grouping them by the age of their construction. It shows that the rule would apply to 1,656,000 child-
occupied facilities, of which 1,559,000 are in target housing.

2.2.1 Daycare Centers and Family Daycare
Establishments involved in the provision of day care of infants or children are classified under NAICS
624410 – Child Day Care Services. This industry covers child day care centers (including those located
in the provider’s home), pre-school centers, nursery schools and pre-kindergarten centers (except as part
of elementary schools). In 2002, Census reported that this industry included over 55,000 firms that
employed nearly 752,000 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005d). Furthermore, Census reports 618,947
non-employers in the industry (U.S. Census Bureau 2005k).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-13
While Census covers both family and center-based childcare under NAICS 624410, there is reason to
believe that Census undercounts the number of employer firms in this industry. This is likely to occur for
two reasons. First, it is likely that the number of firms reported by Census primarily includes centers,
since care provided solely by one person (as occurs at many family daycare establishments) would be
classified under non-employer statistics. Second, Census classifies a business into NAICS 624410 if its
primary line of business is the provision of child day care services; it is likely that many facilities have
alternate primary lines of business (YMCAs and churches, for example). The number of non-employers,
on the other hand, is likely to include care providers such as nannies or babysitters that do not constitute
formal care, but that cannot be disentangled from the total count.
In light of the limitations of the Census data, an alternative data source is used for this analysis. In 2005,
the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) in conjunction with the National
Childcare Information Center (NCCIC) conducted a study on the number and licensed capacity of daycare
centers and family daycare establishments in the 50 U.S. states. Based on these data, there are
approximately 115,000 licensed daycare centers in the United States. Because licensing requirements
differ from state to state, this count includes 105,444 facilities licensed as daycare centers, as well as
about 10,000 facilities such as Head Start, religious daycare, and other similar establishments, which are
required to obtain a license in some states, but must only be registered or certified in others.
According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) First National Health Survey
of Childcare Centers, about 22 percent of licensed daycare centers are located in elementary schools.
Since throughout this analysis, schools are analyzed separately from daycare centers, the number of
daycare centers was reduced by 22 percent, bringing the total number of centers to 89,260. According to
NCES data on public and private schools, however, an additional 1,421 schools without kindergartens
have a pre-kindergarten program (See Section 2.2.2.1). These 1,421 centers are also excluded from the
total center counts to avoid double-counting, bringing the number of centers to 87,840.
In addition to the 115,000 centers, NARA reported a total of 166,514 licensed small family childcare
homes and 47,452 large family childcare homes.5 With the addition of about 16,000 family daycare
homes that are reported as certified, not licensed, NARA reports a total of 229,875 family daycare
facilities.
Because some states either completely exempt family daycare with fewer than a certain number of
students from licensing requirements, or offer voluntary registration, the family daycare numbers reported
by NARA are likely to underestimate the total family daycare universe. As such, to estimate the number
of family daycares, this analysis relied on a 2002 report by the Center for the Childcare Workforce, which
provides data on family childcare providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes. Based on
these data, it is estimated that there are a total of 591,071 family daycare facilities in the United States.
Table 2-8 summarizes the size of the formal (center and family daycare) childcare universe.

used by SBA.

2.2.1.1 Daycare Center and Family Daycare Outlook
Figure 2-2 plots changes in the numbers of licensed child-occupied facilities between 1995 and 2004
using information compiled from the Childcare Licensing Studies published annually by the Children’s
Foundation and the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA).6 These data give larger
counts than the data above because they include facilities in Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.7
But the trends displayed in this data are likely to be present in the smaller data set. The number of
licensed Childcare Centers has grown gradually over time, from 92,000 in 1995 to 120,000 facilities in
2004. The number of Large/Group Family Childcare Homes grew in a similar manner, before tapering
off in 2004. Over the time period specified, the number of Small Family Childcare Homes declined from
276,000 to 256,000, while exhibiting much more variation from year to year than the other two
categories. Here, as noted earlier, large and small refer to the number of children enrolled, not the SBA
definition of a large or small entity.
6 When the Children’s Foundation closed in 2005, NARA assumed sole responsibility for collecting licensing
information through the annual study. However, because the methodology was altered with the new leadership,
data from the 2005 Childcare Licensing Study were not included into Figure 2-2.
7 While the rule would apply to Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands, they are not included in this analysis for
reasons of consistency since some of the major data sources used elsewhere in the analysis were limited to the
50 states and the District of Columbia. Holding all other things equal, by not including COFs in Puerto Rico,
Guam, and the Virgin Islands, the analysis underestimates the costs and benefits of the rule.

The market for lead-safe renovation activities in COFs is dependent on the number of care providing
facilities. Figure 2-2 indicates that while there have been some fluctuations in the underlying components
of the overall market, when considered over the entire time frame, the number of licensed COFs has been
relatively stable.
While there wasn’t significant growth in childcare over the 1995-2004 timeframe, a study forecasts
growth in the demand for childcare labor. Fueling the future demand for childcare services is the
expected increase in the amount of children below 5 between 2004 and 2014. Adding to this growing
demand will be an increased female labor force participation rate, forcing families to find alternate care
options for their children. Furthermore, many states will be implementing their own care programs for 3-
and 4- year old children in the coming years. The government also plans to increase subsidies for low-
income families attending day care programs (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005). While trends point to
increased demand for childcare labor, it is difficult to assess whether this will be accompanied by an
increase in the number of facilities, and to what extent these new facilities will be located in pre-1978
buildings.
2.2.1.2 Informal Daycare
Informal daycare is provided by unlicensed providers, including relatives, friends, and others.
Calculations determining the number of informal daycare providers are based on figures and percentages
found in a report on the number of paid relatives and non-relatives providing childcare entitled
“Estimating the Size Components of the U.S. Childcare Workforce and Caregiving Population: Key
Findings from the Childcare Workforce Estimate” (Center for Childcare Work Force 2002).8

Target Housing COFs
Family daycare and informal daycare take place in target housing. Renovation events in some target
housing COFs would be regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule regardless of their status as a COF; for
example, if they are owner-occupied units where a child under the age of six or a pregnant woman resides
or if they are rental units. For a detailed explanation of the methodology used to estimate the number of
target housing COFs, please see Section 4.2 of Chapter 4. Section 2.8 presents the estimated numbers of
target housing COFs affected by the rule.
2.2.2 Public and Private Schools
This section describes the number and size of public and private schools with kindergartens and pre-
kindergartens.
2.2.2.1 Number of Schools
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, during the 2004-2005 academic year, there
were 93,295 public schools with students in the United States. In total, these schools served 48.8 million
students (NCES 2006a). The rule will apply only to those portions of schools that meet the COF
definition. Thus, the rule is expected to primarily impact schools that have kindergarten or pre-
kindergarten programs. According to the NCES’s Public Elementary and Secondary School Universe
Survey, which collects data on all operational public schools in the United States, in 2004-2005, 52,129
of the 93,295 U.S. public schools (roughly 56 percent) provided either pre-kindergarten or kindergarten
services.9 Of these 52,129 schools, 20,885 offered both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten and 29,884
schools provided kindergarten services only. Only 1,400 schools offered pre-kindergarten, but not
kindergarten services; this group of schools includes standalone preschools operated by local school
boards, as well as daycare centers located in public middle schools, high schools, and ungraded schools
(See Table 2-9). Note that these figures are not limited to schools with pre-1978 buildings.

As shown in Table 2-10, in 2004-2005 a total of 990,421 pre-kindergartners and 3,543,554 kindergartners
were enrolled in pre-kindergartens and kindergartens offered at public schools, respectively. Given the
number of programs described above, this means that there are roughly 44 pre-kindergarten students per
school and 70 kindergarten students per school.
9 A school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero
students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment data were
not provided. Similarly, a school was considered as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten enrollment was
greater than zero, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten or kindergarten,
but did not report kindergarten enrollment.

Number of Public School Districts
Public schools in the United States are operated by local education agencies (LEAs), organizations
“responsible for providing free public elementary/secondary instruction or education support services.”
The National Center for Education Statistics collects data on LEAs through its Common Core of Data
(CCD) fiscal and non-fiscal surveys. NCES designed the Common Core of Data system to
“accommodate the many and varied organizational structures used in the provision of public elementary
and secondary education.” As such the CCD contains records that represent “administrative and
operating units that are unlike typical public schools and school districts – for example, regional
administrative service centers without students.”
According to the CCD Local Education Agency Universe Survey, in 2004-2005, 17,647 LEAs operated
in the 50 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Of these 17,647 agencies, 14,473 operated at
least one school that offered pre-kindergarten or kindergarten services and may thus be affected by the
rule.
Of the 14,473 local education agencies responsible for schools with pre-kindergarten and kindergarten
programs, just under 13,200 are typical public school districts (usually county or town agencies
responsible for providing education services in that location). An additional 949 agencies are charter
school organizations. The remaining 333 agencies represent regional, state, and federal institutions, as
well as supervisory union administrative centers.10 Table 2-11 presents a detailed breakdown of the
number of education agencies by agency type, as well as counts of schools with pre-kindergartens and/or
kindergartens operated by each agency.
10 Supervisory union administrative centers operate schools only in Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia.

School District Finance Survey. Table 2-12 presents the total revenues, average revenues, and percent
revenues derived from federal, state, and local funds for education agencies operating schools with pre-
kindergarten and/or or kindergarten programs. All figures are based only on agencies with available data;

Table 2-13 presents the total and average expenditures of local education agencies. Total expenditures
are composed of total current expenditures for elementary/secondary education, as well as other
expenditures. Elementary/secondary education current expenditures include expenditures for instruction
(e.g. teacher salaries), support services (including, but not limited to, administrative, maintenance, and
operations costs), and other expenses, such as transportation and food services. Other expenditures
include spending not related to elementary/secondary education, such as expenditures for community
service, or adult education, capital outlay expenditures, payments to other government and educational
entities, and debt interest payments. In Table 2-13 current expenditures are split out by type, while the
remainder (capital and non-educational) are combined and labeled as “all other” expenditures.

For most LEAs, the majority of expenditures (51 percent on average, across all LEAs) are spent on
instruction. In aggregate, the category containing maintenance costs (i.e. support service) makes up
around one-third of all expenditures. Lastly, the “all other” expenditures category makes up a significant
percentage of the expenditures for regional education services agencies.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, public school districts are considered large if they serve a
population of more than 50,000. Table 2-14 presents the number of LEAs that operate schools that have
pre-kindergartens and/or kindergartens, by agency type and the size of the population served.

Private schools
In 2003-2004, the National Center for Education Statistics conducted a survey of private schools in the
United States. NCES’s Characteristics of Private Schools in the United States: Results From the 2003-
2004 Private School Universe Survey (2006) presents a summary of survey results, including numbers of
schools currently in operation, the number of students enrolled, and teachers employed. Table 2-15
presents summary statistics on national private schools, including a total count of all private schools,
enrollment and teachers, as presented in NCES’s report.

According to the NCES data, in 2003-2004 there were 34,681 private schools in the U.S., enrolling a total
of just over 5.2 million students, with a total teaching staff of over 441,000. On average, there were 150
students enrolled in a private school and 13 teachers per school. These figures must be interpreted with
caution however, since they encompass elementary schools, secondary schools, etc. which, by definition,
include different numbers of classes.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-22
While the NCES report provides some data on the number of private schools by grade level, it does not
provide data on grades offered by each individual school in the survey. In order to identify schools with
kindergartens only, pre-kindergartens and kindergartens, and pre-kindergartens only, this analysis relied
on the Excel database underlying NCES’s 2003-2004 report. This database, which contains records for
29,907 of the estimated 34,461 private schools in the United States, specifies the highest and lowest grade
offered at each school, as well as the number of students enrolled in each grade. The database, however,
does not include sampling weights used to adjust some of the survey results to generate final numbers
presented in NCES’s report. In order to most accurately estimate the number of schools offering each
combination of kindergarten or pre-kindergarten programs, as well as the number of children enrolled in
these programs, this analysis:
 used the underlying database to identify schools with pre-kindergartens only, kindergartens only,
and both kindergartens and pre-kindergartens, then
 inflated these counts to account for the 4,500 schools that were not included in the database. The
numbers of schools offering each combination of programs was inflated using the ratio of the
number of schools presented in the published report to the number of schools included in the
database. Similarly, the number of children in each school setting, estimated based on the
underlying data, was adjusted using the ratio of the number of kindergartners presented in the
published report to the number of kindergartners reported in the database.11
Table 2-16 breaks down the totals from the previous table to provide a count of the number of private
schools with pre-kindergartens and/or kindergartens.

kindergarten and kindergarten services. Only 21 private schools provided pre-kindergarten but not
11 In its report, NCES tracks schools where kindergarten is the highest grade offered separately from regular
elementary, middle and high schools. As such, when inflating counts obtained from underlying data, the
analysis calculated two sets of ratios for the numbers of schools and numbers of children enrolled – one for
regular, and another for kindergarten-terminal schools.

services. Note that these figures are not limited to schools in pre-1978 buildings.
Table 2-17 presents a count of the number of pre-kindergarten and kindergarten students served in private
schools, as well as the average number of students served per school.

According to Table 2-17, there are 26,510 private schools with kindergartens, enrolling a total of 555,531
kindergarteners. Also, there are 19,326 private schools with pre-kindergartens, enrolling 863,542 pre-
kindergarten students. The average number of private pre-kindergarten students per school (45) is more
than double the average number of kindergarten students (21). Whereas public schools displayed nearly
the opposite ratio with on average 44 pre-kindergarten students and 70 kindergarten students per school.
Non-profit organizations, including private schools, are defined as small under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act if they are independently owned and operated and not dominant in their field. While determining
whether a school meets this definition is difficult, it is useful to present some statistics describing the size
distribution of private schools. Table 2-18 shows the distribution of private schools by the number of
students they serve. This represents the total number of students served, and not just the number of
kindergarten and pre-kindergarten students.

Source: NCES 2006e
The distribution of private schools in the U.S. is heavily skewed toward smaller schools, with 94% of
private schools serving less than 500 students and 99% of private schools serving less than 1000 students.
13 Beginning in 1995, the definition of school employed by the Private School Survey was expanded to include
schools whose highest grade was kindergarten. Therefore, these statistics are likely to include some pre-
kindergartens that are more likely also classified as preschools in other sources (NCES 2006e). Later sections
explain how the calculations avoid double-counting. However, because this is a small figure, it is almost
negligible.

However, these data do not indicate whether the schools are affiliated with or part of a larger
organization.
2.3 Nonresidential Commercial Property Owners and Managers
Nonresidential commercial property owners and managers will be affected by the rule if they rent space to
daycare facilities or other COFs in buildings constructed prior to 1978. The number and size of firms in
this industry is described below.
2.3.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics
Firms involved in the leasing of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses) are classified under
NAICS 531120 – Lessors of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses). In 2002, this industry
included 28,426 firms that employed 154,725 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).
Firms involved in the management of non-residential properties are classified under NAICS 531312 –
Nonresidential property managers. In 2002, this industry included 10,506 firms that employed 125,616
people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).14 Table 2-19 includes only firms with employees. The U.S. Census
Bureau does not differentiate between self-employed individuals that lease or manage commercial real
estate as opposed to residential buildings. This analysis assumes that non-employers primarily lease
residential buildings, rather than commercial property. As such, non-employer establishments are not
included in this profile, or in the remainder of the analysis.

Sources: U.S. Census Bureau 2005j
The 2008 LRRP rule economic analysis (EPA 2008) indicated that a total of 17,705 daycare centers rent
space in pre-1978 buildings. Because daycare centers are only one of many types of establishments
renting non-residential space, and because the rule applies only to centers in buildings constructed prior to
1978, the analysis also assumes that each property manager or lessor firm owns only one regulated
building. As such, the number of affected lessor/manager firms is equivalent to the number of daycare
centers renting space, or 17,705.
2.3.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment
The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that to qualify for small business status, a firm in
NAICS 531120 must have revenues of less than $7 million, while firms in NAICS 531312 must have
revenues of less than $2 million (U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). Average revenues in these
NAICS codes are significantly below the small business designation threshold (Table 2-20).
14 Firms involved in the leasing and/or management of residential buildings are already covered under the residential lead RRP

Census data are not specific enough to report revenues at either the $7 million dollar or $2 million dollar
cutoff; Table 2-21 presents the percent of firms in NAICS 531120 and NAICS 531312 that have revenues
below $5 million and $1 million respectively. Consequently, the figures in Table 2-21 are all
underestimates of the true percentages of firms that qualify as small businesses.

Based on 2002 data, 96 percent of NAICS 531120 firms and 81 percent of NAICS 531312 firms have
revenues below $5 million and $1 million, respectively. In the Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings
industry, these firms contribute 32 percent of the industry revenues while employing 73 percent of the
workforce. The revenue and employment distribution is more skewed in the Nonresidential Property
Managers sector. Small firms in this industry contribute only 19 percent of the revenues, while
employing only 26 percent of the workforce.
2.4 The Demand for Renovation Services
The demand for renovation is responsive to changes in the overall economic conditions. The same factors
that stimulate economic growth, such as low unemployment, high consumer confidence and low interest
rates, also stimulate the demand for renovation activities. For both residential and nonresidential building
projects, the U.S. Census Bureau tracks information on the “value of construction put in place,” a figure
composed of some of the variables previously discussed in this chapter such as labor and material costs
(while also including other variables such as the contractors profit, the cost of architectural and
engineering work, etc). Although the definition of construction includes renovations, alterations,
additions, and other improvements, it does not include “maintenance and repairs to existing structures or
service facilities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006d), two components of primary interest to this rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-26
Using this Census data, Figure 2-3 illustrates the relationship between the value of construction put in
place for private preschools (a term that includes childcare and day-care centers, nurseries, and
preschools), state and local elementary school buildings, private primary and secondary educational
buildings, and real GDP (U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c).15 Both real GDP and the value of state and local
construction of elementary school buildings substantially increased over the previous 12 years.
Meanwhile, the value of private preschool construction and private primary and secondary educational
buildings construction have seen more moderate growth, peaking around 2001 and then gradually
tapering off.

Construction is a term that encompasses not only the creation of new buildings but renovations to older
structures as well. While the Census tracks this breakdown between renovation and new building
construction for residential construction, it does not for non-residential construction. The U.S. Census
Bureau, however, did compile statistics for the expenditures of non-residential improvements in 1986,
1989, and 1992. The U.S. Census defines improvements as “additions, alterations (renovations,
15 State and Local Construction of Elementary School Buildings is meant to give an indication of public kindergarten
construction, while Private Primary and Secondary Educational Building Construction is meant to give an
indication of private school kindergartens. Since the variables shown in Figure 2-3 are more broadly defined
than the variables of interest, they overestimate the value of construction put in place.

remodeling, etc.) and major replacements.” While not being able to collect data on the number or extent
of the individual projects, the Census was able to make some estimations in the non-residential domain,
concluding that “about 23 percent of all buildings had some improvement work, while about 71 percent
had some expenditures for repair” (U.S. Census Bureau 1999). The collected data, however, were not
specific enough to capture improvement expenditures on COFs. Thus, Table 2-22 presents improvement
expenditures as the percentage of the total value of non-residential educational building construction put
in place in each of the three years for which improvement expenditure data were available.
Table 2-22: Improvement Expenditures as a Percentage of the Value of
Construction Put in Place for Non-Residential Educational Buildings
Type of Construction 1986 1989 1992
Private Non-Residential Educational
Buildings 40% 46% 19%
State and Local Non-Residential
Educational Buildings 58% 35% 41%
Source: U.S. Census Bureau 1999, U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c
As shown in Table 2-22, expenditures on improvements as a percent of the total value of educational
building construction put in place vary year to year. Expenditures on improvement made up between 35
and 58 percent of the total value of construction put in place in either private or state and local non-
residential buildings in the three selected years, with the data moderately variable. These figures indicate
that a substantial amount of non-residential educational building expenditures are for activities that might
disturb lead-based paint. The high frequency of these improvement activities points to the importance of
schools in this rule.
2.5 Renovation Industry Market Structure
The previous sections focused on the supply and demand for renovation services. This section discusses
the overall market structure of the renovation industry.
Firms and consumers interact in markets for goods and services with the results of these interactions
depending on the competitive characteristics of the market. Competitive markets are characterized as
markets with a large number of buyers (e.g., consumers) and sellers (e.g., firms) and relatively
homogeneous goods. In competitive markets, neither firms nor consumers can influence the price of the
good by altering their supply or demand decisions. Oligopolistic, monopolistic and monopsonistic
markets are markets where either firms or consumers have market power and exhibit strategic behavior to
change the price of the good sold. The competitive nature of an industry can be estimated by examining
the following market characteristics.
 Number of establishments;
 Specialization of establishments;
 Number of consumers;
 Barriers to entry;
 Availability of substitutes; and
 Homogeneity of the good/service.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-28
The data in Section 2.1 indicate that there are a large number of firms in the construction industry. Using
data for the twelve NAICS codes, there are approximately 394,365 establishments with employees in
construction sectors potentially affected by the rule. Of these establishments, only 2.3 percent have
annual revenues of $10 million or more. In addition, there are about 1.2 million self-employed contractors
in these industries, all of which are, in all likelihood, considered small by SBA standards. Given the large
number of small establishments, it is unlikely that any one firm exhibits substantial market share in the
overall market for renovation services. It is possible in some geographic areas for a small number of
firms or a single firm to establish a market niche, but overall the market for renovation services appears to
be quite competitive on the supply side.
The relatively low barriers to entry in the renovation industry enhance the competition taking place within
it. Much of the work covered by this rule does not require particularly unusual or high levels of skills.
Renovation work has traditionally attracted recent immigrants because a lack of English is not important
(Farzad 2005). While any training required as part of this rule will increase the skill level, the cost of the
training is expected to be relatively low.
There are also a large number of consumers in the industry. As such, no single consumer of renovation
services is expected to exhibit influence over the price of these services.
There are three sources of substitutes for renovation services. First, consumers can substitute from one
contractor to another. Second, consumers can substitute away from professional renovation and into DIY
work. This is less likely to occur for COFs than for residential RRP work. Operators of COFs must be
certified and have their employees trained in order to do covered RRP in the facility. Third, consumers
can reduce the scope of the project or forgo renovation altogether. However, that is unlikely as the cost of
the rule is a relatively small share of the cost of a renovation. Again, this is less likely to occur for COFs
than for residential RRP work. Many states require annual inspections in COFs that assess the amount of
chipped or peeling lead-based paint and dictate that appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the
risk that it imposes.
Additional characteristics of the RRP market result in reduced demand elasticity. First, some
differentiation in RRP services does exist. Contractors can provide services at a higher price if they can
convince consumers that their services are better or distinctly different from their competitors. This is an
important factor in anticipating the impact of the RRP requirements on contractors. The costs of safely
renovating or repairing target housing and COFs are expected to be higher than traditional methods. If
the consumer is indifferent between safe- or unsafe-lead work practices, then those companies that choose
not to use lead-safe work practices may have a competitive advantage in the market due to lower costs.
However, if the consumer recognizes that higher quality renovation jobs are those jobs completed with
lead-safe work practices, then firms may be able to comply with the regulation and charge a higher price.
Under such a scenario, the consumer’s marginal benefit for an additional unit of safe renovation may be
higher than for an additional unit of unsafe renovation. The consumer who has a preference for lead-safe
work practices would choose to do lead-safe renovation as long as the incremental cost of the lead-safe
renovation is less than the incremental benefit of such a renovation. Also, the market for RRP services is
fragmented and there are substantial costs involved in getting prices. Getting bids from various
contractors takes time and consumers need to compare prices across services that differ along many
dimensions. These difficulties make it easier for firms to increase their prices to cover the costs for the
new requirements.
The combination of a large number of firms, a large number of consumers, low barriers to entry, and
available substitutes indicate that the renovation industry is likely to have a relatively high price elasticity
of supply. The price elasticity of demand, however, may be small in absolute value.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-29
2.6 Residential Property Owners & Managers
Property owners and managers also will be affected by the rule if they choose to perform their own RRP
projects rather than hire an outside contractor or if their renovation and maintenance costs rise as a result
of the regulations.
Property owners and managers may have in-house crews that perform RRP activities. If this is the case,
then the property owners and managers will directly bear the costs of training and certifying their workers
as well as the cost of safe work practices. Furthermore, because all firms that perform regulated RRP
projects will experience an increase in costs due to training of supervisors and workers and the use of safe
work practices, it is assumed that costs to property owners and managers who hire outside contractors will
increase.
2.6.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics
Establishments involved in the leasing of apartments and other residential units are classified under
NAICS 531110 - Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings. This industry, in turn, is divided into
two sub-sectors, NAICS 5311101—Lessors of Apartment Buildings and NAICS 5311109—Lessors of
Dwellings Other than Apartment Buildings. According to the 2002 U.S. Economic Census data, together
these industries include a total of 61,787 establishments that employ 292,405 people (U.S. Census Bureau
2004b).
Establishments involved in the management of residential properties are classified under NAICS
531311—Residential Property Managers. In 2002, this industry included 26,233 establishments that
employed 289,870 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2004b). Table 2-23 presents summary statistics for the
businesses in NAICS 531311 as well as NAICS 531110 and its sub-sectors.

2.6.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment
The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that to qualify for small business status, a firm in
NAICS 531110 must have annual revenues of less than $7 million, while establishments in NAICS
531311 must have revenues of less than $2 million (U.S. Small Business Administration, 2004).
Although data on the number of firms by revenue bracket were not available from the 2002 U.S.
Economic Census when this analysis was performed, the average revenues of establishments in these
NAICS codes are significantly below the small business designation threshold (Table 2-24).

In 1997, 98.7 percent of the then 51,572 establishments in the Lessors of Residential Buildings and
Dwellings sector had annual revenues below $5 million and about 85 percent of the 19,000 establishments
in NAICS 531311 had revenues less than $1 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2000a).16 Because 2002 data
on the number of establishments by revenue bracket was not available at the time the estimates were
developed, 1997 data was used to estimate the percent of establishments in each industry that qualify for
small business status. Table 2-25 presents the percent of NAICS 531311 and NAICS 531110
establishments that have revenues below $1 million and $5 million, respectively. The table also presents
the percent of industry revenues and employment that can be attributed to these establishments.

Based on 1997 data over 85 percent of NAICS 531311 establishments, and about 99 percent of NAICS
53110 establishments have revenues below the small business threshold defined by SBA. In the
Residential Property Manager industry, these establishments contribute only 35 percent of the revenues,
and employ only 40 percent of the workforce. The revenue and employment distribution is less skewed in
the Lessor of Residential Buildings and Dwellings sector. Small establishments in this industry
contribute about 82 percent of the revenues and employ 86 percent of the workforce (U.S. Census Bureau
2000a).
2.6.3 Industry Outlook
The market for lead-safe renovation activities will depend in part on the state of the rental housing
market—an increase in rents would provide resources to construct new housing and/or renovate existing
16 Includes establishments open year-round only.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-31
housing. According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), “rents fell in 9 of
the 27 metropolitan areas tracked by the federal government [in 2003]. Nationally, real contract and gross
rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased
home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004).
At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to
9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of
2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market
over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.”
The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home
ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004).
2.7 Training Providers
Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry. Certified renovators will need
accredited training. Both initial and refresher training courses will be required for certified renovators.
2.7.1 Definitions and Industry Characteristics
It is likely that lead-based paint training courses will be provided by establishments categorized as
NAICS code 611519: Other Technical and Trade Schools. Census defines NAICS 61159 as
“establishments primarily engaged in offering job or career vocational or technical courses (except
cosmetology and barber training, aviation and flight training, and apprenticeship training). The
curriculums offered by these schools are highly structured and specialized and lead to job-specific
certification” and these establishments are believed to currently provide training for lead abatement
professionals (U.S. Census Bureau 2004p).
According to the 2002 Economic Census, there are a total of 3,323 establishments in the U.S. certified as
Other Technical and Trade Schools (see Table 2-26). On average, each establishment employs 15.3
people. A striking characteristic is that about 19% of these establishments are exempt from the Federal
Income Tax (FIT). Exempt establishments include non-profit organizations and educational institutions
such as colleges or universities.

Table 2-27 summarizes available financial information for establishments categorized under NAICS
611519. These include total revenues for the sector, average annual revenues per establishment, annual
payroll for the sector, and payroll as a percent of revenue. As Table 2-27 indicates, for Other Technical
and Trade schools, annual payroll is equal to about 35 percent of establishment revenue.

According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in order to qualify as a small business, a firm
categorized under NAICS 611519 must have annual revenues of $7 million or less (U.S. Small Business
Administration 2006a).17 The 2002 Economic Census provided data on the number of firms by revenue
bracket. In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that
were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This
figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus
qualified for small business status.
2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments
As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade
school industry. It is likely that only a small portion of these establishments are involved in lead based
paint-related training. To help characterize the lead training segment of the training provider industry, a
random sample of firms that offer one or more of the courses required for EPA lead abatement
certification were identified as part of the economic analysis of the 2006 proposed LRRP target housing
rule (EPA 2006). The goal was both to collect tuition data for currently offered lead abatement training
courses and to learn what types of institutions (private establishments, non-profits, unions, etc.) offer
these classes.
The sample consisted of 83 establishments selected from the Lead Listing18 directory of 194 training
providers.19 Data were collected from company web sites (when available) and/or over the phone.
Information was obtained from 68 training providers; a total of 15 training providers could not be
reached. Seven of the 68 contacted providers no longer offered lead abatement training courses.
There were five types of training providers in the sample: private for-profit establishments, non-profit
establishments, educational institutions, trade unions and public/government training institutions. Trade
unions provide tuition-free training to their members. Public/government providers train state employees
and workers who qualify for financial assistance through government programs. They do not offer
training to the general public.
17 Effective July 31st, 2006.
18 The Lead Listing (www.leadlisting.org) website was run for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control that contained a directory of lead service
providers. It is no longer in operation (as of late 2004).
19 The sample included all the establishments on the list that are certified to offer a Project Designer course (42
total), as well as a random sample of 41 establishments that were not certified to offer this class. The data were
weighted by the inversed probability of selection into the sample (P=1 for providers that offer a Project
Designer course and P=.270 for providers that do not offer this class). It was assumed that there was no non-
response bias.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-33
Table 2-28 summarizes the number of private establishments, educational institutions, non-profits, unions
and public government providers that appeared in the sample. The table also presents the estimated
national number of providers that fall into each of these categories. More than a third of lead hazard
reduction training providers are private, for-profit establishments. The next largest group of providers is
labor unions, followed by educational institutions (colleges and universities). None of the unions,
however, are certified to offer the Project Designer course. About 13 percent of certified providers either
do not offer training at this time, or have permanently stopped offering lead courses.
More than half of the privately owned, for-profit establishments in the sample (19 out of 35) offer
environmental consulting services in addition to training. Thirteen of the 35 privately-owned providers
specialize in training and do not offer other services. All of these 13 firms offer both lead and asbestos
training courses, as well as, in most cases, OSHA safety, HAZ-MAT and/or mold classes. Although there
was not enough information to determine the services provided by the remaining three companies, these
findings indicate that lead-based paint training providers generally participate in several lines of business.

2.8 Summary Characteristics: Numbers of Structures in the Regulated
Universe
This section provides summary information about the numbers of target housing and public or
commercial building COFs that form the basis for the analyses presented in the subsequent chapters of
this report. Each tally is then subdivided into categories based on the age of the building and the type of
structure. After each table, there is a discussion of how the numbers presented in that table were
calculated.
Table 2-29 provides counts of the number of buildings by type and vintage of building. There are 78.0
million structures covered by the recordkeeping checklist provision of the proposed revisions to the rule,
including 77.9 million target housing units and 0.1 million COFs in public or commercial buildings.
About 40.2 million target housing units would be added to the regulated universe due to the elimination
of the opt-out provision. Table 2-29 also shows the regulated universe under the existing 2008 LRRP rule
(37.7 million target housing units and 0.1 million public and commercial buildings).

2.8.1 Target Housing
This section provides a brief discussion of the estimates of the number of the target housing units
presented in Table 2-29; a detailed explanation of the data sources used to develop these estimates can be
found in Section 4.2 of Chapter 4.
Estimates of the number of housing units by tenure of occupant (owner or renter), age of occupants, and
pregnancy status of occupants were estimated using the 2003 American Housing Survey, which is
described in more detail in Section 4.2 of Chapter 4. Section 4.2 of Chapter 4 also provides a detailed
explanation of the estimated number of target housing units that are defined as COFs. The COFs in target
housing include family daycare providers and the homes of family, friends, and neighbors who regularly
care for someone else’s children. These estimates include care provided for pay and not for pay, and rely
primarily on estimates of the size of the childcare workforce as published by the Center for Childcare
Workforce, 2002. This report includes data on the number of: (1) family childcare providers caring for
unrelated children, (2) paid relatives and non-relatives providing childcare, and (3) unpaid relatives and
non-relatives providing childcare. Based on data provided by the Center for Childcare Workforce, a total
of just under 2.4 million caregivers provide care outside of the child’s home for more than six hours per
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-35
week. As described in detail in Section 4.2, these data are used to estimate the number of COFs in target
housing. These numbers are further reduced to estimate the number of pre-1960 and pre-1978 housing
units based on American Housing Survey data.
2.8.2 Childcare Centers
In 2006, the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) released a report entitled “The
2005 Childcare Licensing Study” providing counts of all the licensed childcare centers and family
childcare homes in the United States. The NARA report indicated that there were approximately 115,000
licensed childcare centers, 66,700 of which are estimated to be built before 1978 according to
Commercial Building Energy Consumption Suevey (CBECS) data (DOE 2003). According to HUD's
First National Health Survey of Childcare Centers (HUD 2003), approximately 24 percent of licensed
centers are located in elementary schools. These 15,753 centers are assumed to be included in the
estimated 40,190 elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens. Thus, there are a total of
50,947 pre-1978 daycare centers located outside of elementary schools. According to NCES data on
public and private schools, however, an additional 824 pre-1978 schools without kindergartens have a
pre-kindergarten program, which brings the total number of buildings accounted for as daycare centers to
51,771 (EPA 2008).
2.8.2.1 Public Schools
The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that during the 2004-2005 academic year,
there were more than 93,000 public schools in the United States. Of these 93,295 public schools, 52,129
had either a pre-kindergarten (PK) or kindergarten (K) program. The Common Core of Data Public
Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey data was used to calculate the number of private schools
with PK or K programs. Using this data, a school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-
kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade
offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment data were not provided. Similarly, a school was considered
as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero, or b) the school reported that
the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten or kindergarten, but did not report kindergarten enrollment.
Again, the educational building age distribution found in CBECS and HUD (2003) was applied to the
total counts, resulting in the estimated 17,000 pre-1960, and 30,000 pre-1978 public schools.
2.8.2.2 Private Schools
This analysis used NCES’s Results from the 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey report and the
underlying dataset to estimate the number of private schools with kindergartens and/or pre-kindergartens.
A school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-kindergarten enrollment was greater than
zero students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment
data were not provided. Similarly, a school was considered as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten
enrollment was greater than zero, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-
kindergarten or kindergarten, but did not report kindergarten enrollment. The previously cited CBECS
and HUD educational building age distribution was then applied to the private school universe to
calculate the number of private schools by age of construction. This adjustment yielded 9,000 pre-1960,
and 15,000 pre-1978 private schools.
For the purpose of the total cost analysis, private and public schools were categorized according to
whether they offered kindergarten only, kindergarten and pre-kindergarten, and pre-kindergarten only.
Table 2-29 uses information drawn from Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 to obtain the total number of schools
with each combination of programs. Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 indicate that there are 29,844 public
schools and 7,205 private schools with kindergarten programs only, for a total of 37,049 such schools.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-36
Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 also indicate that there are 20,885 public schools and 19,305 private schools
with both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten programs. Finally, there are a total of 1,400 public and 21
private schools with pre-kindergarten, but no kindergarten, which are accounted for as daycare centers for
the purposes of the analysis. Table 2-29 presents the total number of schools with kindergartens,
kindergartens and pre-kindergartens, and pre-kindergartens only by age of construction. Information
about the age distribution of buildings was taken from CBECS and HUD and applied to the data to give
estimates of the number of schools by the age of the building.

3. Problem Definition
This chapter begins by characterizing the lead contamination problem, including the various sources of
exposure, presented in Section 3.1. This is followed by a summary of the regulatory background in
Section 3.2. Section 3.3 discusses how market failure due to incomplete information and external costs
result in inefficient levels of lead containment and control in renovation activities, requiring regulatory
intervention. Section 3.4 describes how the proposed rule will address these market failures.
3.1 Lead Contamination Problem
Despite recent reductions in air, water, and food contamination, important sources of lead exposure
remain, due largely to the widespread presence of lead-based paint. Exposure to lead results in increased
blood lead levels associated with various adverse health effects, including reductions in IQ and other
negative cognitive effects, particularly in children. In addition, exposure to lead can result in a variety of
adverse health effects in adults.
3.1.1 Exposure Sources
As described in Chapter 5 lead may cause adverse health effects in any individual, exposed at any stage of
life (in utero through adulthood) (U.S. EPA 2005c). However, young children are particularly susceptible
to lead hazards because their central nervous systems are rapidly developing, and because their behavior
is likely to result in greater exposure to lead than older individuals experience.
Currently, the most significant high-dose source of lead exposure in children under school age is lead-
based paint. Through the 1940's, paint manufacturers used lead as a primary ingredient in many oil-based
interior and exterior house paints. During the 1950's and 1960's, the usage gradually decreased as new
paints were developed, and in 1978 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) ruled that paint
used for residences, toys, furniture, and public areas must not contain more than 0.06% lead by weight.
Nevertheless, about 50 percent of housing units and public and commercial buildings constructed before
1980 still contain lead-based paint (U.S. HUD 2000). Children’s exposure to lead from lead-based paint
is likely to be high when the paint is in a deteriorated state or is found on accessible, chewable, impact, or
friction surfaces, making the lead paint available to children who ingest paint chips. This “pica” behavior
appears to be rare, but is the likely cause of many of the highest blood lead levels observed in children.
Renovation activities can create lead-based paint hazards for children by making paint chips more
accessible for ingestion. These hazards can occur both within and outside the building unit being
renovated.
In addition to being a source of direct exposure, lead-based paint can be the source of lead contamination
in soil and dust. Children are exposed to lead from soil or dust in their homes as a result of typical hand-
to-mouth activities. Lead-contaminated dust and soil are the major pathway through which most young
children are exposed to lead from lead-based paint hazards. Renovation activities increase the level of
lead dust in the facility and in the soil, thereby increasing the risk of lead ingestion in young children.
While occupational exposure is the primary exposure pathway to lead for adults, other common exposure
pathways for teenagers and adults include gardening, housework, drinking water and certain hobbies such
as creating objects from stained-glass and making pottery. Individuals (children, teenagers and adults) are
also exposed to a variety of other lead sources, some of which are localized in nature.
Airborne lead is present in emissions from lead smelters, battery manufacturing plants, and solid waste
incinerators. The phase-out of leaded gasoline has substantially reduced airborne lead. Drinking water
may become contaminated with lead after it leaves the treatment plant. Although lead levels in drinking
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-2
water generally do not have a statistically significant effect on blood-lead concentrations as a result of
regulations stemming from the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act, water is still considered an important
localized exposure source where lead solder and/or brass plumbing fixtures are present because of the
high absorption rate of lead in water. Lead exposure through food ingestion has declined greatly due to
the phase-out of lead-soldered food cans and public education. With these improvements in exposure
from air, water, and food, lead-based paint remains as the largest widespread source of lead exposure.
3.1.2 Lead from Renovation Activities
EPA exposure data (EPA 1997) indicate that renovation activities potentially increase both short-term and
long-term lead exposure levels. Lead concentrations are greatest in the area where the renovation work is
performed, but lead does settle into other areas of the building and potentially the surrounding area,
causing longer-term exposure. The study found that, with the exception of carpet removal and drilling
into plaster, all renovation activities examined deposited significant amounts of lead onto the floors in the
area where the work was being performed, ranging from 480 micrograms per square foot for sawing to
15,500 micrograms per square foot for paint removal. This lead may be ingested or inhaled by occupants
if proper containment and clean-up practices are not used. The study found that sweeping and shop-
vacuum clean-up, considered to be standard practice in the industry, reduced the total amount of lead
available to occupants. However, as the distance from the activity increased, the cleanup left a higher
percentage of the lead behind so that lead hazards remained following cleanup. These findings
demonstrate that these practices do not adequately reduce risks from lead dust generated by renovation
activities. Lead dust settled in carpeted areas or in soil is the most difficult to remove with simple broom
and vacuum clean-up and thereby creates the longest lasting exposure pathway for facility occupants.
EPA conducted a field study in 2007 (Characterization of Dust Lead Levels after Renovation, Repair, and
Painting Activities) (the ‘‘Dust Study’’) to characterize dust lead levels resulting from various renovation,
repair, and painting activities (EPA 2007). This study was designed to compare environmental lead levels
at appropriate stages after various types of renovation, repair, and painting preparation activities were
performed on the interiors and exteriors of target housing units and child-occupied facilities. All of the
jobs disturbed more than 2 square feet of lead-based paint, so they would not have been eligible for the
minor maintenance exception. The renovation activities were conducted by local professional renovation
firms, using personnel who received lead safe work practices training using the curriculum developed by
EPA and HUD, ‘‘Lead Safety for Remodeling, Repair, and Painting’’ (EPA 2003a). The activities
conducted represented a range of activities that would be permitted under the 2006 Proposal, including
work practices that are restricted or prohibited for abatements under 40 CFR 745.227(e)(6). Of particular
interest was the impact of using specific work practices that renovation firms would be required to use
under the proposed rule, such as the use of plastic to contain the work area and a multi-step cleaning
protocol, as opposed to more typical work practices.
In the Dust Study, 12 different interior and 12 different exterior renovation activities were performed at 7
vacant target housing units in Columbus, Ohio, and 8 vacant target housing units (including four
apartments) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three different interior and three different exterior renovation
activities were conducted at a building representing a child-occupied facility, a vacant school in
Columbus. The presence of lead-based paint was confirmed by laboratory analysis before a building was
assigned a particular renovation activity or set of activities. Before interior renovation activities were
performed, the floors and windowsills in the work area and adjacent rooms were cleaned. In most cases,
pre-work cleaning resulted in dust lead levels on floors of less than 10 μg/ft2; nearly all floors were less
than 40 μg/ft2 before work started. Most windowsills that would be used for later sampling were cleaned
to dust lead levels less than 250 μg/ft2. In the few cases where that level was not achieved on a
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-3
windowsill needed for sampling, dust collection trays were used. Interior renovation activities included
the following jobs:
 Making cut-outs in the walls.
 Replacing a window from the inside.
 Removing paint with a high temperature (greater than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint with a low temperature (less than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint by dry scraping.
 Removing kitchen cabinets.
 Removing paint with a power planer.
To illustrate the impact of the containment plastic and the specialized cleaning and cleaning verification
protocol that would be required by the 2006 Proposal, each activity was performed a minimum of four
times:
 With the plastic containment described in the 2006 Proposal followed by the cleaning protocol
described in the proposal.
 With the plastic containment described in the 2006 Proposal followed by dry sweeping and
vacuuming with a shop vacuum.
 With no plastic containment followed by the cleaning protocol described in the 2006 Proposal.
 With no plastic containment followed by dry sweeping and vacuuming with a shop vacuum.
Dust samples were collected after the renovation work was completed, after cleaning, and after cleaning
verification. If a building was being used again for the same job under different work practices, or for a
completely different job, the unit was recleaned and retested prior to starting the next job. All buildings
were cleaned and tested after the last job.
Geometric mean post-work, pre-cleaning floor dust lead levels in the work room were as follows (in μg/
ft2):
 Cut-outs – 422.
 Kitchen cabinet removal – 958.
 Low temperature heat gun- – 2,080.
 Dry scraping – 2,686.
 Window replacement – 3,993.
 High temperature heat gun – 7,737.
 Power planing – 32,644.
Where baseline practices, i.e., no containment, dry sweeping, and vacuuming with a shop vacuum, were
used, the geometric mean post-job floor dust lead levels in the work room were as follows (in μg/ft2):
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-4
 Cut-outs – 22.
 Kitchen cabinet removal – 58.
 Low temperature heat gun – 41.
 Dry scraping – 66.
 Window replacement – 135.
 High temperature heat gun – 445.
 Power planing – 450.
The package of proposed rule requirements, i.e., containment, specialized cleaning, and cleaning
verification, resulted in the lowest geometric mean dust lead levels in the work room at the end of a job.
These results were as follows (in μg/ft2):
 Cut-outs – 5.
 Kitchen cabinet removal – 12.
 Low temperature heat gun – 24.
 Dry scraping – 30.
 Window replacement – 33.
 High temperature heat gun – 36.
 Power planing – 148.
Windowsill sample results were similar; the geometric mean dust lead levels after renovation activities
performed in accordance with the proposed rule exceeded 250 μg/ft2 only where power planing or a high
temperature heat gun were used. When baseline practices were used, the geometric mean dust lead levels
on the windowsills exceeded 250 μg/ft2 for kitchen cabinet removal, window replacement, high
temperature heat gun use, and power planing.
Exterior renovation activities performed as part of the study included the following:
 Replacing a door and doorway.
 Replacing fascia boards, soffits, and other trim.
 Removing paint with a high temperature (greater than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint with a low temperature (less than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.
 Removing paint by dry scraping.
 Removing paint with a needle gun.
 Removing paint with power sanding or grinding.
 Removing paint with a torch or open flame.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-5
For the exterior jobs, plastic sheeting was placed on the ground to catch the debris and dust from the job,
in accordance with the requirements of the proposed rule. Additional plastic sheeting was laid out beneath
and beyond the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic. Trays to collect dust and debris were placed on top of and
underneath the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic. Trays were also placed just outside of the ‘‘proposed rule’’
plastic to assess how far the dust was spreading. A vertical containment, as high as the work zone, was
erected at the end of the additional plastic.
The use of the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic as a ground covering captured large amounts of leaded dust. For
all job types except removing paint with a torch, there was a substantial difference between the amount of
lead captured by the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic and the amount under the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic.
Including both bulk debris and dust, geometric mean lead levels in exterior samples from the collection
trays on top of the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic ranged from a low of 60,662 μg/ft2 for the door replacement
activity to a high of 7,216,358 μg/ft2for removing paint with a high temperature heat gun. Geometric
mean lead levels from the collection trays under the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic ranged from a low of 32
μg/ft2 for door replacement to 8,565 μg/ft2 for removing paint with a torch.
The 2008 final LRRP rule was supported by the Dust Study discussed above. Therefore, EPA conducted a
peer review in accordance with OMB’s Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review. EPA
requested this review from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) Lead Review Panel.
The CASAC, which is comprised of seven members appointed by the EPA Administrator, was
established under the Clean Air Act as an independent scientific advisory committee. The CASAC’s
comments on the Dust Study, along with EPA’s responses, have been placed into the public docket for
this action. More information on the CASAC consultation process, along with background documents, is
available on EPA’s website at http://www.epa.gov/ lead/pubs/casac.htm.
According to the peer review report, the CASAC Panel found
“. . .that the [Dust Study] was reasonably well-designed, considering the complexity of the
problem, and that the report provided information not available from any other source. The study
indicated that the rule cleaning procedures reduced the residual lead (Pb) remaining after a
renovation more than did the baseline cleaning procedures. Another positive aspect of the Dust
Study was that it described deviations from the protocol when they occurred. “
The CASAC Panel also contended that the limited data from residential housing units and child-occupied
facilities included in the Dust Study, most likely do not represent a statistically valid sample of housing at
the national level. They noted that there are aspects of the study that would underestimate the levels of
lead-loadings while other aspects of the study would overestimate the loadings. EPA agrees that the Dust
Study is not nationally representative of all housing. EPA notes that there are several reasons why this is
the case, including the fact that all of the housing studied was built during 1925 or earlier, and a large
number of the floors were in poor condition. A major purpose of the Dust Study was to assess the
proposed work practices. A statistically valid sample of housing at the national level is not needed to
assess the work practices. If anything, the Dust Study is conservative with respect to the age of housing
because it studied older houses and therefore is appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the work
practices.
3.2 Regulatory Background
This section outlines the extensive history of lead-based paint regulations at the federal level. Childhood
lead exposure continues to be a major public health problem among young children in the United States.
Most children with blood lead levels in excess of CDC’s current level of concern have been exposed to
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-6
lead in non-intact paint, interior settled dust, and dust and soil in and around deteriorating older housing
(CDC 2004). The nature and extent of the problems associated with lead-based paint in housing units
have been thoroughly investigated. Approximately 40% of all U.S. housing units (about 38 million
homes) have some lead-based paint. Use of lead safe work practices during renovation can advance the
goal of primary prevention of lead poisoning (CDC 2004).
The Federal Lead-based Paint Program.
Title X and the Federal goal
Primarily in response to the persistent health threat posed by lead-based paint, in 1992 Congress enacted
Title X. Congress found that low-level lead poisoning was widespread among American children,
affecting, at that time, as many as 3 million children under age 6; that the ingestion of household dust
containing lead from deteriorating or abraded lead-based paint was the most common cause of lead
poisoning in children; and that the health and development of children living in as many as 3.8 million
American homes was endangered by chipping or peeling lead paint, or excessive amounts of lead-
contaminated dust in their homes. Congress determined that the prior Federal response to this crisis was
insufficient and established, in Title X, a national goal of eliminating lead-based paint hazards as
expeditiously as possible. Congress decided that the Federal government would take a leadership role in
building the infrastructure necessary to achieve this goal.
The stated purposes of Title X are:
 To develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based paint
hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible.
 To reorient the national approach to the presence of lead-based paint in housing to implement, on
a priority basis, a broad program to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint hazards in the Nation’s
housing stock.
 To encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable
framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation and reduction and by ending the current
confusion over reasonable standards of care.
 To ensure that the existence of lead-based paint hazards is taken into account in the development
of Government housing policies and in the sale, rental, and renovation of homes and apartments.
 To mobilize national resources expeditiously, through a partnership among all levels of
government and the private sector, to develop the most promising, cost-effective methods for
evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards.
 To reduce the threat of childhood lead poisoning in housing owned, assisted, or transferred by the
Federal Government.
 To educate the public concerning the hazards and sources of lead-based paint poisoning and steps
to reduce and eliminate such hazards (Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of
1992).
EPA’s lead-based paint program
Under Title X, EPA is directed to take actions that can be divided into 4 key categories:
 Establishing a training and certification program for persons engaged in lead-based paint
activities, accrediting training providers, establishing work practice standards for the safe,
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-7
reliable, and effective identification and elimination of lead-based paint hazards, and developing a
program to address exposure to lead-based paint hazards from renovation and remodeling
activities.
 Ensuring that, for most housing constructed before 1978, lead-based paint information flows from
sellers to purchasers, from landlords to tenants, and from renovators to owners and occupants.
 Establishing standards for identifying dangerous levels of lead in paint, dust and soil.
 Providing information on lead hazards to the public, including steps that people can take to
protect themselves and their families from lead-based paint hazards. Each of these categories is
discussed in more detail in the following sections.
a. Training and certification, accreditation, and work practice standards. Title X added a new title to
TSCA entitled ‘‘Title IV Lead Exposure Reduction.’’ Most of EPA’s responsibilities for addressing lead-
based paint hazards can be found in this title, with section 402 being one source of the rulemaking
authority to carry out these responsibilities. TSCA section 402(a) directs EPA to promulgate regulations
covering lead-based paint activities to ensure persons performing these activities are properly trained, that
training programs are accredited, and that contractors performing these activities are certified. These
regulations must contain standards for performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account
reliability, effectiveness, and safety.
On August 29, 1996, EPA promulgated final regulations under TSCA section 402(a) governing lead-
based paint inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments, and abatements in target housing (U.S.
EPA 1996). TSCA section 401 defines ‘‘target housing’’ as any housing constructed prior to 1978,
except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age
resides or is expected to reside in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0-
bedroom dwelling. These regulations also apply to ‘‘child-occupied facilities,’’ which are defined at 40
CFR 745.223 as buildings constructed before 1978, or portions of such buildings, where children under
age 6 are regularly present. TSCA section 402 defines lead-based paint activities in target housing as
inspections, risk assessments and abatements. The 1996 regulations cover lead-based paint abatement
activities in target housing and child-occupied facilities, along with limited screening activities called lead
hazard screens. The regulations also established an accreditation program for training providers and a
certification program for individuals and firms performing these activities. Training providers who wish
to provide lead-based paint training for the purposes of the Federal lead-based paint program must be
accredited by EPA. Implementing regulations at 40 CFR 745.225 describe in detail the requirements for
each course of study, how training programs must be operated, and the process for obtaining
accreditation. Training programs must have a training manager with experience or education in a
construction or environmental field, and a principal instructor with experience or education in a related
field and education or experience in teaching adults. Training programs must also have adequate facilities
and equipment for delivering the training. To become accredited, an application for accreditation must be
submitted to EPA on behalf of the training program. The application must either include the course
materials and syllabus, or a statement that EPA model materials or materials approved by an authorized
State or Tribe will be used. The application must also include a description of the facilities and
equipment that will be used, a copy of the test blueprint for each course, a description of the activities and
procedures that will be used during the hands-on skills portion of each course, a copy of the quality
control plan, and the correct amount of fees. If EPA finds that the program meets the regulatory
requirements, it will accredit the training program for 4 years. To maintain accreditation, the training
program must submit an application and the correct amount of fees every 4 years.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-8
Individuals and firms that perform inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments, or abatements in
target housing or child-occupied facilities must be certified. Certification requirements and the process
for becoming certified are described in 40 CFR 745.226. A firm that wishes to become certified must
submit an application, along with the correct amount of fees, attesting that it will use only certified
individuals to perform lead-based paint activities and that it will follow the work practice standards in 40
CFR 745.227. An individual who wishes to become certified must take an accredited training course in at
least one of the certified disciplines: Inspector, risk assessor, project designer, abatement worker, and
abatement supervisor. The risk assessor, project designer, and abatement supervisor disciplines have
additional requirements for education or experience in a construction or environmental field. The
inspector, risk assessor, and abatement supervisor disciplines also require the applicant to pass a
certification examination administered by a third party.
The regulations at 40 CFR part 745, subpart L, also contain work practice standards for performing
inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments and abatements in target housing and child-occupied
facilities. The regulations contain specific requirements for conducting paint sampling during an
inspection and specify information that must be gathered and samples that must be taken as part of a lead
hazard screen or risk assessment. The requirements for abatements are also set forth in the regulations.
When conducting abatements, an occupant protection plan must be prepared by a certified supervisor or
project designer; certain work practices such as open-flame burning, machine sanding or abrasive blasting
without high-efficiency exhaust control, dry scraping, and heat guns at high settings are prohibited; and a
visual inspection and dust clearance sampling must be performed after the abatement is finished to ensure
that the area is ready for re-occupancy. Any samples collected during any of these regulated lead-based
paint activities must be analyzed by a laboratory recognized by EPA as being capable of analyzing paint
chips, dust, and soil for lead. Requirements for inspection, lead hazard screen, risk assessment or
abatement reports are also described in this section
Recognizing the importance of States and Territories in achieving the goal of eliminating lead-based paint
hazards in housing, Congress specifically directed EPA to establish a model State program and a process
for authorizing States to operate such programs in lieu of the Federal program. Concurrently with the
subpart L rulemaking in 1996, EPA codified, at 40 CFR part 745, subpart Q, a model training and
certification program and a process for enabling States, Territories, and Tribes to apply for authorization
to administer their own lead-based paint activity programs. Providing Indian Tribes with this opportunity
is consistent with EPA’s Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian
Reservations (U.S. EPA 1984). EPA also provides grants under TSCA section 404 to States, Territories,
and Tribes to assist them in developing and administering these programs, as well as programs
implementing TSCA section 406(b). On June 9, 1999, the subpart L regulations were amended to include
a fee schedule for training programs seeking EPA accreditation and for individuals and firms seeking
EPA certification (U.S. EPA 1999). These fees were established as directed by TSCA section 402(a)(3),
which requires EPA to recover the cost of administering and enforcing the lead-based paint activities
requirements in unauthorized States. The most recent amendment to the subpart L regulations occurred
on March 20, 2009 (U.S. EPA 2009).
In addition, Congress directed EPA, in TSCA section 405, to establish protocols, criteria, and minimum
performance standards for analysis of lead in paint, dust, and soil. TSCA section 405 further directed
EPA, in consultation with HHS, to develop a program to certify qualified laboratories. The National Lead
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) provides the public with a list of laboratories that have met
EPA requirements and demonstrated the capability to accurately analyze paint chip, dust, or soil samples
for lead. All laboratories recognized by NLLAP must pass on-site audits conducted by one of the two
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-9
accrediting organizations currently participating in NLLAP, the American Industrial Hygiene Association
(AIHA), and the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation. Recognized laboratories must also
perform successfully on a continuing basis in the Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing
(ELPAT) Program established by NIOSH, AIHA, and EPA.
More recently, the LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692) and
is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The rule was promulgated
under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section IV of TSCA was
established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known as Title X of
the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.
The 2008 LRRP regulation requires entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based
paint.
b. Lead-based paint information for purchasers, renters, owners, and occupants of target housing.
Another of EPA’s responsibilities under Title X is to require that purchasers and tenants of target housing,
as well as occupants of target housing and parents of children in COFs undergoing renovation are
provided information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards. As directed by TSCA section
406(a), CPSC, HUD, and EPA, in consultation with CDC, jointly developed a lead hazard information
pamphlet entitled ‘‘Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home’’ (‘‘PYF’’) (U.S. EPA et al 2003b).
This pamphlet was designed to be distributed as part of the disclosure requirements of section 1018 of
Title X and TSCA section 406(b), to provide home purchasers, renters, owners, and occupants with the
information necessary to allow them to make informed choices when selecting housing to buy or rent, or
deciding on home renovation projects. The pamphlet contains information on the health effects of lead,
how exposure can occur, and steps that can be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of exposure during
various activities in the home.
Pursuant to the authority provided in section 1018 of Title X, on March 6, 1996, HUD and EPA jointly
promulgated regulations requiring persons who are selling or leasing target housing to provide the PYF
pamphlet and information on known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the housing to
purchasers and renters (HUD and U.S. EPA 1996). These joint regulations, codified at 24 CFR part 35,
subpart A, and 40 CFR part 745, subpart F, describe in detail the information that must be provided
before the contract or lease is signed and require that sellers, landlords, and agents document compliance
with the disclosure requirements in the contract to sell or lease the property. Title X does not provide for
these requirements to be administered by States or Tribes in lieu of the Federal regulations. Therefore,
HUD and EPA are responsible for administering and enforcing these disclosure obligations.
TSCA section 406(b) directs EPA to promulgate regulations requiring persons who perform home
renovations for compensation to provide a lead hazard information pamphlet to owners and occupants of
target housing being renovated. These regulations, promulgated on June 1, 1998, are codified at 40 CFR
part 745, subpart E (U.S. EPA 1998). The term ‘‘renovation’’ is defined, at 40 CFR 745.83, as the
modification of any existing structure, or portion of a structure, that results in the disturbance of painted
surfaces. Lead-based paint abatement projects are specifically excluded, as are small projects that disturb
2 square feet or less of painted surfaces, emergency projects, and renovations affecting components that
have been found to be free of lead-based paint, as that term is defined in the regulations, by a certified
inspector or risk assessor. Like the regulations regarding disclosure during sales or leases, these
regulations require the renovation firm to document compliance with the requirement to provide the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-10
owner and the occupant with the PYF pamphlet. One important difference from the disclosure
requirements in section 1018 of Title X is that TSCA section 404 allows States to apply for, and receive
authorization to administer, the TSCA section 406(b) requirements. Two States are currently authorized
to operate this program.
c. Standards for lead in paint, dust, and soil. Another responsibility assigned to EPA by Title X is the
development of standards for identifying dangerous levels of lead in paint, dust and soil. These standards,
promulgated pursuant to TSCA section 403 on January 5, 2001 and codified at 40 CFR part 745, subpart
D, provide various Federal agencies, including HUD, and State, local and Tribal governments with
uniform benchmarks on which to base decisions on remedial actions to safeguard children and the public
from lead-based paint hazards (U.S. EPA 2001b). These standards also allow certified inspectors and risk
assessors to easily determine whether a particular situation presents a lead-based paint hazard and whether
to recommend remedial actions such as lead-based paint abatement, cleaning of dust, or removal of soil.
The standards define lead-based paint hazards in target housing and child-occupied facilities as paint-lead,
dust-lead, and soil-lead hazards. A paint-lead hazard is defined as any damaged or deteriorated lead-
based paint, any chewable lead-based painted surface with evidence of teeth marks, or any lead-based
paint on a friction surface if lead dust levels underneath the friction surface exceed the dust-lead hazard
standards. A dust-lead hazard is surface dust that contains a mass-per-area concentration of lead equal to
or exceeding 40 micrograms per square foot (µg/ft2) on floors or 250 µg/ft2on interior windowsills based
on wipe samples. A soil-lead hazard is bare soil that contains total lead equal to or exceeding 400 parts
per million (µg/g) in a play area or average of 1,200 parts per million of bare soil in the rest of the yard
based on soil samples.
d. Public outreach and education. Among other things, TSCA section 405(d) directs EPA, along with
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and HUD, to sponsor public education
and outreach activities to increase public awareness of the health effects of lead, the potential for
exposures, the importance of screening children for elevated blood lead levels, and measures that can be
taken to reduce or eliminate lead-based paint hazards. Accordingly, EPA has worked to provide the
public with information and increase public awareness of such matters. To date, these activities have
included web site management, development of public outreach strategies, development of partnership
agreements, distribution of materials, participation in national conferences and exhibits, and developing
hazard information documents (and other media, such as videos), as necessary to implement Title X. EPA
has collaborated closely with other Federal agencies and its State, Tribal, and local government partners
in developing outreach campaigns. EPA has also been involved in developing model tool kits of various
educational tools to provide to partners, such as slogans and graphic materials for public buses, trains, and
mass transit stations.
TSCA section 405(e) further directs EPA to establish, in connection with HUD, CDC, other Federal
agencies, and State and local governments, a clearinghouse for information on lead-based paint and a
hotline for the public to use for questions and requests for information on lead-based paint. This
clearinghouse, the National Lead Information Center, handles approximately 50,000 calls per year, and
disseminates up to 500,000 documents per year to the public.
Lead-based paint programs at other Federal agencies
In addition to EPA, other Federal agencies have important roles in achieving the goals of reducing or
eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing. Other agencies specifically assigned tasks in Title X
include HUD, CDC, and OSHA.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-11
The Federal agencies have long realized that they must work together to develop and implement Federal
strategies for addressing lead-based paint hazards in order to be efficient and effective. In 1989, HUD
and EPA formed an inter-agency task force to work through issues associated with lead-based paint
abatement. The Federal Interagency Lead Based Paint Task Force has remained active throughout the
years and continues to meet on a quarterly basis. Participating agencies include the Department of
Defense, the Veterans Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
U.S. Public Health Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the National
Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), ATSDR, CDC, CPSC, NIOSH, OSHA, HUD, and
EPA. This Task Force serves as an important forum for coordinating the strategic plans of the Federal
agencies who have responsibilities under Title X or who have responsibilities for maintaining and
disposing of property that may contain lead-based paint.
Title X assigned certain responsibilities to HUD. One of HUD’s functions is the administration of the
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program established by the Act. This program provides grants of
$1 million to $3 million to State and local governments for control of lead-based paint hazards in
privately owned, low-income owner-occupied and rental housing that is not receiving federal assistance.
These grants are also designed to stimulate the development of a trained and certified hazard evaluation
and control industry. Evaluation and hazard control work funded by the program must be conducted by
either contractors who are certified by EPA or an EPA-approved State or Tribal program, or by
contractors trained in lead-safe work practices, in the case of interim controls. Through these
requirements, HUD hopes to create infrastructure that will last beyond the life of the grant. In awarding
grants, HUD promotes the use of cost-effective approaches to hazard control that can be replicated across
the nation. Since 1993, approximately $971 million has been awarded to over 200 local and State
jurisdictions across the country. The work approved to date will lead to the control of lead-based paint
hazards in more than 70,000 homes where young children reside or are expected to reside. Other HUD
lead grant programs include the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration program, the Lead Elimination
Action Program (LEAP), the Lead Outreach program and the Lead Technical Studies program.
HUD was also given regulatory authority over some aspects of lead based paint hazard control. As noted
previously, on March 6, 1996, HUD and EPA jointly promulgated regulations requiring the disclosure of
lead-based paint information during sale or lease transactions involving target housing. The HUD
disclosure regulations are codified at 24 CFR part 35, subpart A. Subparts B through R of 24 CFR part
35 are known as the ‘‘Lead Safe Housing Rule,’’ initially promulgated on September 15, 1999, and
updated in June 2004 (HUD 2004b). This rule was designed to protect young children from lead-based
paint hazards in target housing that is being sold by the Federal government or receives financial
assistance from the government. The requirements generally depend upon the level of assistance being
provided, and may include such things as inspections, risk assessments, abatement, paint stabilization, or
interim controls, which are temporary measures to reduce potential exposure to lead-based paint hazards.
The emphasis is on reducing lead-based paint hazards, so, after paint is disturbed, a visual assessment for
surface dust, debris, and residue and dust clearance testing is required to ensure that no dust lead hazards
were created or left in the work area or, for rehabilitation projects of moderate or substantial scope, in the
entire housing unit. More information on the Lead Safe Housing Rule is available on the HUD website at
http://www.hud.gov/offices/lead.
Section 1017 of Title X required HUD to issue ‘‘guidelines for the conduct of federally supported work
involving risk assessments, inspections, interim controls, and abatement of lead-based paint hazards.’’ In
response to this directive, HUD completed the Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-12
Paint Hazards in Housing (Guidelines), in June 1995 (HUD 1995). The Guidelines provide detailed,
comprehensive, technical information on how to identify lead-based paint hazards in housing and how to
control such hazards safely and efficiently.
Other core activities of HUD’s lead-based paint program include providing technical assistance to
housing authorities, nonprofit housing providers, local and State agencies, other Federal agencies, housing
developers, inspectors, real estate professionals, contractors and financiers, and public health authorities;
evaluating the hazard reduction methods used in the grant program to measure their effectiveness, cost
and safety; and maintaining a community outreach program in coordination with the other Federal
agencies involved in lead-based paint hazard reduction.
CDC also provides significant funding for the prevention of childhood lead poisoning. CDC provides
funding to support State, city and county programs in the areas of primary prevention, case management
and screening, surveillance, strategic partnerships, and program evaluation. Since 2002, CDC has
recommended that a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) be used as a threshold for
individual intervention (CDC 2002). Additional CDC recommendations address the type and intensity of
individual intervention strategies that should be undertaken, depending upon the child’s blood lead level.
These strategies range from nutritional and educational interventions, along with more frequent testing,
for a child with a blood lead level of 10–14 µg/dL, to medical and environmental interventions for
children with blood lead levels above 45 µg/dL (CDC 2002). CDC has established a national surveillance
system for children with elevated blood lead levels. In addition, CDC works with HUD and EPA to
coordinate outreach and education campaigns.
OSHA is another agency with regulatory authority under Title X. As directed by the Act, OSHA
promulgated an interim final standard on May 4, 1993, which regulates lead exposures in the construction
industry (OSHA 1993). This standard, codified at 29 CFR 1926.62, limits worker exposures to 50
micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air averaged over an 8–hour workday. Employers must use a
combination of engineering controls and work practices to reduce employee exposure as much as
possible, using appropriate respiratory protection where necessary to achieve the exposure limit.
Employees must receive training on the health effects of lead and how to limit exposure through proper
work practices and personal protective equipment. Exposure monitoring and medical monitoring,
including blood lead testing, are also required. This standard remains in effect and OSHA retains the
authority to protect workers from occupational exposure to lead.
Many Federal agencies have been working to reduce or eliminate lead-based paint hazards in housing and
to end lead poisoning. EPA, HUD, and other Federal agencies have been working for many years on the
problem of lead-based paint hazards that can be created during renovation and remodeling activities in
housing and child-occupied facilities. This rulemaking is an important component of the Federal strategy
for eliminating lead poisoning.
3.3 Justification for Federal Regulations of Lead Exposure during Renovation
3.3.1 Market Failure
From an economic perspective, a necessary condition for regulations is the existence of inefficiency in the
allocation of resources. This inefficiency is commonly labeled a market failure since the market is the
mechanism assumed to make efficient resource allocations possible. A market failure can come from one
or more of several sources. These include poorly defined property rights (such as negative externalities,
common property resources, and public goods); imperfect markets for trading property rights (because of
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-13
a lack of perfect information or of contingent markets; monopoly power; distortionary taxes and subsidies
and other inappropriate government regulations); and the divergence of private and social discount rates.
The occurrence of any of these conditions justifies further inquiry into the need for government regulation
to reduce inefficiencies in the allocation of society’s resources. This section considers whether any of
these conditions are linked to lead exposures resulting from renovation in target housing and public or
commercial building COFs. If so, understanding the nature of the inefficiencies involved facilitates the
design of more effective regulations. The specific regulatory approach considered here involves the
removal of the opt-out provision (currently available for renovations in owner-occupied target housing
where no child under the age of 6 or pregnant woman resides and no COF operates), and a requirement
that renovators provide owners and occupants with information documenting compliance with the training
and work practice requirements of the LRRP rule.
Economic efficiency suggests that “lead-safe” renovation will occur as long as the property owners’
willingness-to-pay for reduced lead risks exceeds the cost of reducing these risks. If the property owners
are aware of the risks and of the availability and costs of reducing these risks, then arguably they might be
able to accurately trade off risk and cost without the aid of government regulation. However, there are
two arguments for why individual property owners may not trade off risk and cost efficiently.
Externalities and Public-Good Characteristics of Lead-Safe Renovation
A major cause of failure in the market for lead-safe renovations stems from externalities due to
renovations disturbing lead-based paint that do not use lead-safe work practices because they occur in
target housing units eligible for the opt-out provision. An efficient outcome is achieved when the
marginal willingness-to-pay for a service is equivalent to the marginal cost of providing that service.
Because the use of lead-safe work practices is likely to benefit not only the consumer of the renovation
(the homeowner and his or her family members) but also residents of adjacent properties, future
occupants, visitors, and children receiving child care on the premises, lead-safe renovation services are, in
part, a public good. As such, even with perfect information, the maximum amount that the individual
consumer of the renovation would be willing to pay for lead-safe work is likely to be lower than the total
amount that that particular consumer plus the other beneficiaries (neighbors, future occupants, etc.) would
be willing-to-pay for the service. For example, occupants of neighboring properties may also experience
an increased exposure to lead and may be willing to pay to reduce or eliminate this exposure but may not
be consulted by the property owner making the decision. As another example, children do not testify to
their willingness-to-pay for risk reduction and rely on their parents’ or the property owners’ willingness-
to-pay. Even if other parties were consulted, the transaction costs of reaching an agreement would be
high, so that this would be an inefficient process.
An example of an externality can be found in an owner’s decision about which contractor to hire to
perform renovation in his or her housing unit. Contractors that provide lead-safe renovation services are
likely to charge more for their work than establishments that do not use lead-safe practices. Lead-safe
work practices may also increase the duration of the project because contractors need to take additional
steps to prevent the spread of lead dust. Since the property owner pays for the renovation, but not
necessarily for the consequences of all the resulting lead exposure, he or she is faced with powerful short-
term incentives (lower cost and a faster turn-around) to hire a contractor that does not use lead-safe work
practices. Other parties (such as residents of adjacent properties, future occupants, visitors, and children
receiving child care and their parents) pay for the consequences of lead exposures, not the property
owner. This externality results in a socially inefficient outcome of too little lead-safe renovation services
being purchased.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-14
A similar external cost problem also leads to inefficiencies on the supply side of this market. Renovators
that use lead-safe work practices incur higher costs than other contractors who are faced with the
incentives to keep their costs as low as possible. Similar to property owners, contractors may not incur
the costs of consumer lead exposure resulting from unsafe renovation work.
Because the legal/liability system is not perfect, the contractor’s financial responsibilities (in terms of
costs related to the customer’s lead exposure) are not clear and consistently enforced. The same situation
occurs with respect to a property owner’s responsibilities to residents of adjacent properties, future
occupants, visitors, and child-care customers. This is likely to result in an inefficient outcome of either
too little lead-safe renovation services being consumed.
Inadequate Information
Another cause of failure in the market for lead-safe work practices is due to inadequate information.
Correct information is an important prerequisite to the demand for containment and clean-up practices
that reduce lead exposure during renovation projects. In deciding whether lead-safe work practices or
well-trained contractors are worth the extra cost, the property owner has to know whether there is lead in
the work area, what risks are implied by having renovation done in areas with lead-based paint, the
significance of these risks, what can be accomplished in reducing those risks through specific
containment and clean-up practices, and how much these practices cost.
Misinformation can lead to inefficient outcomes. Without knowing there is a lead problem, or how
renovation might create lead hazards, the owner will have too low a demand for proper work practices
and may be unwilling to pay additional costs for contractors who voluntarily abide by these containment
and clean-up standards. Furthermore, a great deal of uncertainty can exist if the consumer is unsure about
the quality of lead-safe renovation services being purchased and their likely benefits. If consumers do not
have any guarantee that contractor are qualified to identify and control lead-based paint hazards, demand
for these services is likely to be lower than in the presence of such a guarantee. On the supply side,
contractors may be unaware of the risks they are creating and the methods they can use to reduce risks of
lead exposure.
Impacts of the Regulation on Demand for Lead-Safe Renovation Services in Opt-out Housing
A consumer’s demand for renovation services is a function of the price of these services, the
characteristics of the services (e.g., quality, lead safety etc.), and the characteristics of consumers.
Assume that all renovation services are identical except that some are performed using lead-safe
containment and clean-up practices and some are not. Assume for illustration purposes that there is only
one consumer and one supplier in the market. Of the services that are performed not using these lead-safe
practices, some are done by the supplier, while others are do-it-yourself projects performed by the
consumer. The general market failure relationships discussed above are illustrated in Exhibit 3-1 as three
markets for close substitutes. Figure (a) represents the market for lead-safe renovation projects, Figure
(b) represents the professional market for “standard practice” renovations that do not use lead-safe work
practices, and Figure (c) represents the do-it-yourself market for “standard practice” renovations. In each
market, S0 represents the supply of renovation services and D0 represents the demand for renovation
services in the baseline with incomplete information. Note that, moving from left to right, each supply
curve is lower than the prior one, corresponding to the lower cost in terms of materials and time
combined. The area under the demand curve in each market represents the consumer’s willingness-to-pay
for renovation services.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-15
Exhibit 3-1: Impact of Regulation on Markets for Renovation/Remodeling Services in Opt-out Housing
The LRRP program alters the nature of these three markets by providing information to the consumer and
contractor about the risk associated with lead-based paint renovation activities and by requiring lead-safe
containment and clean-up practices for professional projects. The implementation of the LRRP program
will help to establish a more structured market for lead-safe renovation services. Prior to the LRRP
program, consumers of renovation services generally had no guarantee that a contractor who claimed to
provide lead-safe renovation services would actually perform the project in a lead-safe manner. The
implementation of work practice standards and training/certification requirements is likely to increase
consumer confidence in the quality of the work provided by certified contractors, increasing their
willingness-to-pay for these services.
EPA’s targeted outreach program is also likely to increase demand for lead-safe renovation services by
raising consumer awareness about the dangers of unsafe work. Although contractors that currently
provide well-trained staff and perform lead-safe work practices are expected to find it in their vested
interest to provide the kinds of information cited above, this possibility has not closed the information
gaps for the public. One impediment may be public uncertainty about the reliability of information that
contractors themselves provide. Their information may be considered unreliable because consumers are
not fully competent to assess the lead contamination and what needs to be done, because the businesses
are subject to moral hazard (which occurs, for example, because businesses have a financial interest in
minimizing their work practice costs), or both. Since many property owners may lack easy access to
independent sources of information to motivate their decisions, doing nothing may be the likely response.
With the implementation of the LRRP program, however, consumers are more likely to avoid the dangers
posed by unsafe renovation and hire a qualified contractor to perform the work in a lead-safe manner.
The increased demand discussed above is shown by an upward shift of the demand curve in Figure (a)
from D0 to D1 and an associated increase in price. Simultaneously, the demand for “standard practice”
renovation services decreases with an associated decrease in price. Given scarce resources for
enforcement, it is expected that some “standard practice” professional work will continue, even in
properties where there is the potential for lead exposure. The effect of the regulation on the do-it-yourself
market is ambiguous. Some property owners that might have hired a professional to perform “standard
practice” renovation work in the baseline may decide to perform this work themselves rather than pay the
additional costs for lead-safe work practices. This would shift the supply curve back up. On the other

hand, with increased information, property owners that would have performed do-it-yourself “standard”
practice” renovation in the baseline may decide to either forgo renovation altogether or hire a lead-safe
professional, thus reducing do-it-yourself demand.
Impacts of the Regulation on the Supply of Lead-Safe Renovation Services
The regulation will increase both the costs of supplying lead-safe services and standard services. In
Figures (a) and (b), S1 represents the supply of services with the regulations. A contractor that already
uses lead-safe practices will also incur the costs of training, certification and cleaning verification. A
contractor that continues to provide standard (not lead-safe) renovation services will have higher costs of
operation due to potential enforcement actions, and potentially higher liability. The relative size of the
shifts in the two submarkets will affect the final changes in quantity and price of both lead-safe and
standard renovation services.
The net impact on the quantity of renovation projects performed is also ambiguous. If all property owners
are willing to pay the full amount for lead-safe work practices, then the total quantity performed across all
three markets will remain constant but the average price will rise. However, if some property owners are
not willing to pay for the risk reduction they may chose to forgo renovation services altogether, resulting
in a net decline in renovation services provided after regulation.1
Conclusions
As demonstrated in this review, due to inadequate information and the existence of externalities, the
quantity of lead-safe RRP services currently provided is likely to be inefficiently low. The results of the
market failures discussed in this review are significant in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
Childhood lead exposure continues to be a major public health problem among young children in the
United States. During 1999 through 2002, approximately 310,000 children aged 1 to 5 years, had blood-
lead levels greater than 10 μg/dL, despite the removal of lead from gasoline and the banning of lead-based
paint in 1978 (CDC 2005). Most children with blood-lead levels in excess of CDC’s current level of
concern have been exposed to lead in non-intact paint, interior settled dust, and dust and soil in and
around deteriorating older housing or other buildings where they spend time. According to the Center for
Disease Control (CDC), “renovation and remodeling activities that disturb lead-based paint can create
substantial amounts of lead dust in the home; such dust can then be inhaled or ingested by children”
(CDC 1997). An insufficient number of lead-based paint interventions have occurred to remove the
dangers posed by uncontrolled renovation activities; renovation activity thus continues to pose a
significant risk of lead exposure.
3.3.2 Justification for Regulation at the Federal Level
In the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X), the United States Congress
stated that the elimination of lead-based paint hazards was a national goal. Under §402, Congress
directed EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals
are properly trained, that training programs are accredited, and that contractors engaged in such activities
are certified; and to promulgate guidelines for the conduct of such renovation and remodeling activities
which may create a risk of exposure to dangerous levels of lead. Accordingly, the 2008 LRRP rule
1 The amount by which price and quantity change in each of these markets is a function of both the amount by which
the supply and/or demand functions shift and the relative elasticities of the two functions. See Appendix 3A for
a discussion of how these factors affect the price of renovation services and the quantity provided by the
market. Appendix 3B presents price elasticity estimates for construction and RRP.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-17
established training, certification and accreditation requirements, as well as work practice requirements
for renovation work in target housing and COFs.
The proposed rule revises the LRRP program by removing the opt-out provision in the 2008 LRRP rule.
The proposed rule also requires renovation firms to provide owners and occupants with a copy of the
records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the LRRP rule.
Since both of these provisions revise the existing Federal RRP regulation, it is appropriate that the
changes be made at the Federal level, instead of the state or local level.
3.4 Approaches for Reducing Lead Exposure Resulting from Renovation
This section examines how the information provision and the mandatory training and work practice
requirements in the proposed rule address the market failures discussed in the previous section.
3.4.1 Information Provision
Information provision will occur in several ways under the LRRP program, in conjunction with other
sections of Title X. Consumers will be directly informed about lead-based paint hazards and risks
associated with renovation work through educational programs and through the expanded notification
requirements. The aim of these programs will be to educate the property owner about the risks associated
with lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards and having renovation work done in areas where these
are present, the significance of these risks, and how specific work practices can reduce those risks. In
addition, requiring training of professionals who carry out renovation projects will provide these
individuals information about the hazards of lead exposure and the use of appropriate procedures to
reduce exposure during their work. Similarly, the entity certification process will act as an indirect form
of information provision to the consumer by assuring them that the services they are purchasing will
reduce or eliminate lead exposure.
The proposed rule addresses the market failure due to inadequate information in two ways. First,
removing the opt-out provision will bring renovations in these housing units under the purview of the
LRRP program, which assures consumers that firms are certified and renovation staff are trained and
qualified to minimize exposure to lead-based paint hazards created during renovations. Second, requiring
renovators to provide owners and occupants with a record of the steps taken to comply with the
requirements of the LRRP program (using the checklist or other means) can facilitate a review and
discussion between the parties of how well the renovator complied with the work practice requirements in
the LRRP program. Both of these information provision activities are described below.
Effect of Removing the Opt-Out Provision
The objective of removing the opt-out provision is to reduce exposure to lead dust generated by
renovation projects and thereby protect children and adults from the health hazards posed by lead. Due to
the nature of the problem, uncertainty currently exists on the part of consumers about the quality of lead-
safe renovation services and their likely benefits. The lack of information regarding the benefits of and
the lack of confidence in the quality of a good or service generally leads to a lower demand and a lower
willingness-to-pay for that good or service. Thus, if consumers of renovation services are not aware of
the dangers posed by lead dust generated during renovation, or if they are not confident that a contractor
who claims to use lead-safe work practices has been properly trained, they may not be willing to pay the
additional costs of contractors who voluntarily abide by these work practice standards. Removing the
opt-out provision will bring renovations in these housing units under the purview of the LRRP program,
which assures consumers that firms are certified and renovation staff are trained and qualified to
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-18
minimize exposure to lead-based paint hazards created during renovations. This provision of information
will act as an important instrument in alleviating the problems contributing to undue lead exposure. An
example of the market failure stemming from inadequate information is presented in the previous section
and is shown graphically in Exhibit 3-1.
An additional information flow will occur under these regulations. The teaching of safe work practices to
contractors and other personnel performing RRP work in opt-out housing will provide them with
information they need to undertake renovation activities in ways that will minimize exposure to the
occupants of the building and others. The training course will also provide information about the hazards
associated with lead and renovation activities, which contractors will pass along to their clients. This
provision of information is likely to increase the demand for lead-safe work practices and assist in
eliminating the market failure that currently exists due to incomplete or misinformation.
Effect of Requiring Checklist Provision
The proposed rule’s requirement for renovators to provide the owner and occupant with a record of the
steps taken to comply with the requirements of the LRRP program is one of several information provision
requirements under Title X. For example, the proposed rule will function in conjunction with EPA’s pre-
renovation education rule, promulgated under TSCA section 406(b), that requires renovators to provide
owners and occupants of target housing and COFs with a lead hazard information pamphlet before
conducting renovations. The pamphlet that renovators must provide (entitled Renovate Right: Important
Lead Hazard Information for Families, Child Care Providers and Schools) covers topics including the
potential health effects resulting from lead exposure; how to prepare for a renovation; the work practices
that contractors must follow (containment, cleaning, cleaning verification, etc.); and what to look during
the job and after the job is done.
The proposed rule requires renovators to provide a copy of the checklist (or other information
documenting the steps taken to comply with the requirements of the LRRP program) when the final
invoice for the renovation is delivered, or within 30 days of the completion of the renovation, whichever
is earlier. Because the owner will receive the information prior to making the final payment for the work,
he or she can use this information in a discussion with the renovator about any differences between the
work practices required in the rule and those identified on the checklist as having been completed, or
between the work practices that the renovator identified on the checklist and those that the owner
observed being used. If there were any deficiencies in the contractor’s work practices, the two parties
may then be able to negotiate a resolution to address them. For example, if the renovator failed to
appropriately contain the work area, he or she may agree to have the dust levels checked through dust
wipe sampling, and (depending on the results) to perform additional cleaning in order to decrease dust
lead levels. Or owners may want to perform additional cleaning on their own.
In situations where the occupant is not the owner (i.e., in a rental unit), the occupant may be in a better
position than the homeowner to note whether the renovator followed all of the steps noted on the
checklist. Because the renovator also provides the occupant with a copy of the checklist, the occupant
can raise with the owner any discrepancies between what the occupant observed and what the completed
checklist says. The owner can then take the steps outlined above.
Requiring the renovator to provide the owner and occupant with a record of the steps taken to comply
with the LRRP program creates an additional incentive for the renovator to comply. A renovator is more
likely to adhere to all of the work practice requirements knowing that a consumer with a copy of the
completed checklist will be in a better position to evaluate whether the work followed the requirements.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-19
A mandatory information provision requirement is useful for renovators as well as consumers, since it
provides renovators with an affirmative indication that they have followed the work practice requirements
in the rule. Having the option of using a checklist developed and suggested by EPA (instead of using a
checklist that has been developed by private parties) may address possible questions of whether the
checklist renovators are using is sufficient and appropriate.
EPA’s version of the checklist is short (one page long) and is written in simple and clear language. The
information provided by the renovator is supplied in checkboxes or in short fill-in-the-blank answers.
Thus, the information is provided in a format the owners and occupants can readily understand. Because
renovators must provide the checklist prior to final payment for the work, owners will receive the
information in a timely fashion. This provides them with the ability to act on the information in an
appropriate manner.
If renovators were not mandated to provide this information to consumers, responsible renovators might
theoretically provide it voluntarily (although renovators who are not as responsible are unlikely to provide
this information voluntarily). But there is no evidence that even responsible renovators are doing this.
EPA’s analyses for this rule and for the 2008 LRRP rule assumes that some of the work practices required
by the LRRP program are already used in a fraction of the renovations in the baseline (that is, without the
LRRP program applying). If renovators were interested in voluntarily providing consumers with
information similar to that on the checklist, then presumably some of them would already be doing it (i.e.,
providing consumers with documentation of the types of containment, cleaning, and other work practices
they are using in the baseline). However, there has been no indication that renovators are providing
owners with documentation of the work practices used, much less that renovators are providing
documentation comparing the work practices used with the suite of work practices required by the LRRP
program. The failure of the marketplace to provide this information on its own means that owners and
occupants may not be able to react appropriately to avoid or prevent risks from lead-based paint.
The proposed rule does not require owners and occupants to read the checklist or to take further actions to
reduce lead-based paint hazards. Thus, the extent to which lead exposure is reduced (beyond the expected
increase in the compliance rate discussed above) depends upon how participants in the transaction
respond to the information provision required by the proposed rule. Neither the costs nor benefits of these
responses can be quantified because doing so would require predicting the behavior of the parties, which
is influenced by many factors unique to each individual situation. Data are not available to estimate the
behavior changes.
3.4.2 Mandatory Training and Work Practice Requirements
The information provision described above will aid in reducing the extent of the market failure that
currently exists for lead-safe renovation services. However, relying solely on information provision is
unlikely to be sufficient to correct the market failure because of the nature of the lead paint problem. The
lead in lead-based paint cannot be seen on visual inspection, so the owner and occupant do not know if
lead is present and whether a lead exposure hazard exists. Likewise, the adverse health effects are not
noticeable for several years, and the source may not be recognized. In such situations, education may not
be sufficient and other mechanisms are needed to ensure that if a potential risk exists, it is suitably
addressed. The LRRP program introduces other mechanisms for the elimination of lead-based paint
hazards during renovation work. These include training requirements for personnel engaged in
renovation work, and the use of standard practices for the containment and cleanup of lead dust and debris
generated during the project, and the prohibition or restriction of certain high-hazard techniques. The rule
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-20
requires the use of these work practices in all target housing by removing the opt-out provision from the
LRRP program.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-21
Appendix 3A: The Role of Elasticities in Determining the Impacts of a
Rule
EPA is often faced with deciding on a regulatory policy in the absence of good information about the
likely effects of the policy on consumers and producers. In particular, data on the own-price elasticity of
supply and demand often are uncertain. This appendix provides background information on the likely
effects of own-price elasticity of demand and supply on the outcomes of EPA’s regulatory efforts. The
bulk of the discussion focuses on the case of perfect competition, not because the majority of markets
EPA is likely to affect will exhibit competitive behavior, but simply because the theory is clearly defined
in this case. However, this appendix also examines the likely impacts of relaxing the assumption of
perfect competition. It focuses on two general classes of regulatory options: regulations that alter the
market outcome by imposing additional costs upon producers, and regulations that alter the market by
providing information to consumers.
3A.1 Elasticities of Supply and Demand
The market equilibrium for a commodity (e.g., purchasing renovation, remodeling or painting (RRP)
work that uses lead-safe work practices) is determined by the intersection of the aggregate demand and
supply curves. The aggregate demand curve depicts consumer behavior and is based on consumer income
and preferences. Likewise, the aggregate supply curve describes the behavior of producers in the market,
and is dependent upon the costs of production. At market equilibrium, the price is referred to as market
clearing. In other words, at this price, the quantity demanded by consumers and supplied by producers
are equal and neither the consumer nor producer has any incentive to move away from this steady state as
long as current demand and supply conditions prevail.
However, when demand and supply conditions do change, for example when new information causes
consumers to adjust their preferences and thus shift the demand curve, or changes in input prices affect
costs of production and shift the supply curve, the market gravitates to a new equilibrium. This new
equilibrium is represented by a new combination of market clearing price and quantity. The magnitude of
the change in price and quantity is dependent not only upon the extent of the shift in the demand or supply
curve, but also on the own-price elasticity of demand and supply for the commodity.
The own-price elasticity of demand is defined as the ratio of the percent change in quantity demanded to
the percent change in price, and is reflected in the slope of the demand curve, similarly for the own-price
elasticity of supply. By determining the level of change in price and quantity, the elasticities of the two
curves also determine the distribution of the burden or benefit between the consumer and producer
resulting from a change in equilibrium conditions. Analyzing changes in consumer and producer
surpluses provides a means for quantifying such distributional changes.
Figure 3A-1 below provides a hypothetical example of how the effects of regulation may impact
consumer and producer surpluses. In the baseline, the supply curve is represented by S1, and producers
supply Q1 at a price P1. On all the inframarginal units supplied, producers receive a price above the cost
of production. The difference between the price and the cost of production represents the producer
surplus resulting from supplying Q1 at price P1 (triangle P1CD). Similarly, in the baseline consumers
demand quantity Q1 at price P1. For all the inframarginal units demanded, consumers would be willing to
pay more than that price and thus receive a surplus. The difference between what consumers are willing
to pay as measured by the height of the demand curve, and what they have to pay is the consumer surplus
(triangle ACP1).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-22
So what are the effects of regulation? In Figure 3A-1, the upward shift in the supply curve to S2 (say
from a rise in production costs due to the implementation of the RRP rule which requires use of the more
costly lead-safe work practices) results in a new equilibrium at the point B, with a new market price of P2
and quantity of Q2. Note that producer surplus decreases from P1CD to EBP2 and the consumer surplus
also decreases from ACP1 to ABP2. Thus, in the arbitrary case drawn in Figure 3A-1, the social costs of
the regulation are born by both consumers and producers of the pollution-generating good. This result
turns out to be a function of the way the supply and demand curves have been drawn, and the distribution
of costs between consumers and producers depends on the slope (elasticity) of the demand and supply
curves.

In general, for a given production cost increase, the more elastic the demand curve, the greater the
inability on the part of the producers to pass the additional costs of production on to the consumers. As
shown in Figure 3A-2 (a) and 3A-2 (b) below, the differing slopes of the demand curve lead to
differential impacts on the consumer and producer surplus. In Figure 3A-2 (a) demand for the good is
relatively price elastic, while in Figure 3A-2 (b) the good has a relatively inelastic demand. Notice that
when demand is less elastic, the price increase resulting from a shift in supply is greater and consumers
bear a greater share of the loss in consumer surplus. On the other hand, with a more elastic demand, the
overall price increase is smaller and the share of total costs born by producers is larger.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-23
The elasticity of demand is determined in general by the existence of suitable substitutes for a
commodity. If several commodities exist in the market that are considered to be close substitutes for each
other, then a consumer is likely to have a great deal of choice available to him while making his
consumption decision. This being the case, if the price of the commodity that he is presently consuming
happens to rise, he is easily able to reduce his current consumption level of that commodity and switch
over to consuming more of one of the substitutes. This flexibility limits the ability of the producer to pass
on the burden of the cost increase on to the consumer. Thus, the availability of close substitutes in the
market explains why the demand curve for a commodity will be relatively elastic, and why the rise in
price will be relatively small. On the other hand, if substitutes are lacking for a commodity that
experiences a price increase (and it is not a luxury good), then the consumer has little choice but to carry
on consuming similar quantities of the same product. Thus, in this situation he will have to shoulder a
larger share of the increased costs by paying a much higher price, and this rigidity in his consumption
behavior explains the inelastic nature of the demand curve for that commodity.
Recognizing that most markets are not perfectly competitive, product differentiation allows firms to
charge prices higher than marginal costs and charge different prices for similar goods. The degree to
which producers can pass on the cost of production depends heavily on the degree to which they can
convince consumers that their product is different from other products. In its limit this argument is just a
restatement of the fact that markets with lower elasticities of demand will experience higher price
increases. If “market demand” is defined to be the demand for a single brand of good, then the number of
substitutes for the good affects its demand elasticity and thus affects the degree to which the producer can
pass on cost increases. If the firm can convince consumers that the product is distinct then it in essence
lowers the elasticity of demand for its product.
The own price elasticity of supply, on the other hand, is dependent on the degree of specialization of
inputs. If the inputs are highly specialized or firms are locked into long-term contracts then firms in this
industry can be left with substantial sunk investments creating high transition costs which are reflected in
an inelastic supply curve. However, if supply is highly elastic then firms can easily switch production to
other uses and minimize the effect of the demand shock. In essence the elasticity of supply measures the
amount of resources lost or tied up indefinitely when consumption patterns change suddenly.
The EPA seeks to reduce hazards from lead-based paint by two separate pathways of regulatory impact.
First, it hopes to reduce exposure to lead-based paint by regulating the “method of production” of RRP
work in opt-out housing by establishing standards for such activities and through requiring certifications
and/or training. This is likely to result in an increase in the “costs of production” of RRP work thereby
affecting the supply curve for such activities. Second, the rule will provide information to consumers. In
this case EPA is likely to alter the market outcomes by changing the demand for products (lead-safe and
non lead-safe work practices). To the extent that the demand and supply of RRP work will be affected by
the rule, one must consider the price elasticities involved to determine the distributive impact of the rule
on consumers and producers.
An important factor on which the price elasticity will depend is the number of substitutes that exist for the
RRP service that is sought in the market. As previously explained, the greater the number of available
substitutes, the more elastic the demand and lesser the burden of a production cost increase likely to fall
on the consumer. Under this rule three classes of substitutes may be said to exist for RRP services. These
are (1) professionals using lead-safe work practices, (2) professionals using non lead-safe work practices,
and (3) the do-it-yourself jobs. Thus, a certain amount of flexibility is available to the consumer when it
comes to hiring RRP services.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-24
Currently a sizeable number of RRP firms may not necessarily be following lead-safe work practices
thereby limiting the size of the class of firms that do so. However, with the implementation of the rule, a
much larger number of firms are expected to adhere to these practices in the future, thus enlarging the size
of this class. In addition, this increase in the number of professionals using lead-safe work practices will
also have a geographical impact. Presently, the limited number of professionals who use lead-safe work
practices are concentrated in a select number of locations where state and local regulations have fostered
their development. As a result, in many parts of the country the choice of hiring “lead-safe” professionals
currently does not exist. But this situation will change as a larger number of firms switch to lead-safe
work practices once the rule come into effect.
However, if the increase in production costs from the rule is extremely high such a large transition of
firms from using lead-unsafe to lead-safe work practices may not occur. This is because the cheaper
option of using non-certified (non lead-safe work practice using) RRP workers or doing the work yourself
will limit the ability of the certified (lead-safe work practice using) professional to charge the consumer
for all or a large portion of this significant cost increase. In this situation a large number of lead-unsafe
firms may remain in existence. Thus, one may assume that as long as an appreciable difference exists
between “costs of production” of lead-safe and non lead-safe work practices, firms of both types will
continue to exist. The continued existence of firms using non lead-safe practices also depends on the
extent and effectiveness of enforcement activities. The greater the cost differential between lead-safe and
non lead-safe practices, the greater the need for enforcement activities.
In addition to the number of substitutes, the closeness of substitutes in their ability to replace one another
needs to be judged. The important question is whether RRP work done by uncertified professionals and
the do-it-yourself efforts are substantially less safe than the services of certified professionals. To the
extent an appreciable difference exists between the quality of service (in terms of preventing or reducing
lead-based paint hazards) provided by the two groups, they will not be perceived as close substitutes for
each other and their demand curves will not be as elastic as they would have been if they were considered
close substitutes. In such a situation, consumers feel that a sufficiently differentiated product is being
offered by the two groups, and thus their choice is limited.
This judgment on the degree of closeness of substitutes will to some extent depend upon the importance
that lead safety holds with the property owner compared to other priorities. To the extent that the priority
assigned to lead exposure is relatively small, the uncertified professionals and do-it-yourself jobs will
tend to be seen as closer substitutes for certified professionals, than if lead-based paint hazards are
perceived as a larger threat by the property owner. Thus, the elasticity of demand will also vary according
to owner priorities, and in this regard, the informational aspect of the rule may in fact assist in raising
more awareness, resulting in lead safety being assigned a higher priority.
Of a related nature, the firm certification aspect of the rule is likely to increase consumer ability to
differentiate between the services being offered by the three classes of substitutes. The certification
process will create a distinct divide which will permit the property owner to get a better appreciation of
the varied benefits to be gained from the alternatives at hand. This is likely to reduce to some extent the
perceived closeness of the substitutes and thereby make the demand more inelastic for each class of RRP
service.

3A.2 How Price Elasticity of Demand Affects the RRP Rule
As discussed above, EPA foresees two separate pathways by which the rule will take effect; increasing
costs of production leading to a shift in supply and provision of information to consumers leading to a
shift in demand. The way these two effects will play out and the role that price elasticities will play in the
adjustment of prices and quantities under the two scenarios is discussed below.
3A.2.1 Effect of Rule on the Cost of Production (Supply Shift)
EPA seeks to reduce exposure to lead-based paint hazards by the introduction of lead-safe work practices
during RRP work. These practices involve the use of increased precautions in situations where lead-based
paint hazards may potentially be created during RRP work, and as a result costs of RRP work are likely to
increase above current levels. Since producers seek to maximize profits and in the baseline will produce
goods using the lowest-cost combination of inputs, a rule requiring producers to change their input mix
will necessarily increase the cost of production. Thus, one impact of the rule will be to increase the
production costs, leading the supply curve to shift upward and to the left.
Figures 3A-2(a) and 3A-2(b) demonstrate the distributional affects of such a hypothetical shift in supply
in markets with different elasticities of demand. The price increase is much higher (P1 to P2) and the
decrease in quantity demanded is much lower (Q1 to Q2) with a given shift in supply when demand is
less elastic (as shown in Figure 3A-2(b)) as compared to the elastic demand scenario in Figure 3A-2(a).
Thus, the consumers bear a higher share of the total social cost from the regulation (represented by the
relatively larger decrease in the consumer surplus compared to that in the producer surplus). On the other
hand, Figure 3A-2(a) shows that the higher the elasticity of demand, the lower the overall price increase,
the larger the reduction in quantity demanded, and thus the larger the share of total costs to be born by
producers (represented similarly by the larger decrease in producer surplus as compared to the consumer
surplus).
3A.2.2 Effect of Rule on the Provision of Information to Consumers (Demand Shift)
The alternative regulatory approach is to provide information to consumers in the hopes that they will
make more environmentally friendly consumption choices. In this case EPA alters the market outcomes
by changing the demand for products. Figures 3A-3(a) and 3A-3(b) depict such a hypothetical example.
In these cases the commodity in question (non lead-safe work practices) has negative environmental
effects (byproducts). By educating consumers about these byproducts and alternative products that have
lower levels of adverse effects (lead-safe work practices), EPA can change consumer preferences and
shift demand for the “bad product” inward and to the left. This lower demand curve would more
accurately reflect the true “social” marginal benefits of consuming the product.
What are the likely distributional and efficiency effects of this type of regulatory policy? Figures 3A-3(a)
and 3A-3(b) reveal that under both scenarios (for an elastic and inelastic supply curve), the downward
shift in the demand curve will lead to a decrease in price and quantity demanded of the commodity.
However, in the case of an elastic supply curve when the transition costs associated with switching to the
production of other products is relatively low, the decrease in price of the commodity is smaller and the
decrease in quantity demanded larger, as compared to the changes in the case of an inelastic supply curve
involving high transition costs. Restated in terms of changes in producer and consumer surpluses, the
producer surplus is reduced under each scenario, but the elastic supply curve causes a relatively smaller
burden to fall on the producer than the inelastic supply curve. Similarly, the consumer receives a
reduction in social benefit under each scenario; however, the magnitude of this reduction is larger under
the inelastic supply curve case.

3A.2.3 Application to Renovation
In the rule, EPA is both affecting production and providing information. The likely effects of the
regulation on prices and welfare are difficult to discuss without more accurate information on the supply
and demand elasticities. However, some general observations are warranted.
The welfare effects of the regulation will likely be driven by the supply side rather than the demand side.
This is because the elasticity of supply for RRP services is likely to be relatively higher than the elasticity
of demand. Supply elasticities are expected to be relatively high because there are relatively few barriers
to entering or leaving this industry. Little capital equipment or specialized labor skills are needed for
RRP work, and what is needed is easily transferred from non-compliant renovation to “lead-safe”
projects. On the demand side, there are two primary categories of RRP events – those of a maintenance
character and those of an improvement character. Maintenance activities usually cannot be postponed
and thus are not particularly sensitive to price. Improvement projects, however, can more easily be
postponed and thus tend to be more price elastic. Complicating matters, however, are the existence of
different categories of purchasers. Some place a high premium on quality and timeliness, while others
actively seek low prices. Appendix 3B discusses some of the empirical evidence on elasticities of
demand and supply.
However, the analysis does not suggest that the education factor is unimportant. If the regulation is not
accompanied by education efforts and enforcement, then EPA could unintentionally drive up demand for
non-compliant renovation projects creating additional welfare losses. These losses are the result of the
fact that if consumers were aware of the lead paint issues their true marginal valuation for the non-
compliant projects is lower than the price of these projects. Thus, if enforcement is not perfect, education
is essential. EPA can compensate for the fact that it is raising the costs of lead-free renovation on the
supply side by educating consumers on the environmental effects of non-compliant renovations thereby
making these cheaper, non-compliant projects less attractive.

Appendix 3B: Elasticities of Demand and Supply for Housing /
Renovation Services
As described in Chapter 3 and Appendix 3A, the impact of increases in the cost of RRP services on
demand for RRP will depend on both the size of the cost increase and the elasticity of demand for these
services. Likewise, the impact on the supply of RRP services will depend on both the size of the cost
increase and the elasticity of supply for these services. These impacts are expressed in terms of changes
in price and in the quantity of services purchased. Chapter 4 estimates the cost increases due to the
requirements of the various regulatory options, based on the increased labor and materials costs of
complying with the containment and clean-up requirements, as well as the training and certification costs
imposed by the requirements. This appendix reviews the existing literature on residential demand
elasticities.
Unfortunately, RRP has received relatively little attention by housing economists. While there are many
studies that estimate elasticities for new construction, these studies have only limited applicability to
renovation and remodeling. The income elasticity of demand for housing is generally estimated to be
somewhat inelastic (in the 1.0 to 0.8 range). This is consistent with housing being a necessity –
expenditures on housing do not increase as rapidly as income (Green and Malpezzi 2003). Demand for
housing is also considered to be somewhat price inelastic, with generally accepted values either in the
range of -0.5 to -1.0 or -0.75 to -1.2 (Mayo 1981, Malpezzi and Maclennan 2001, Ellwood and Polinski
1979). One study is available that estimated a renovation demand elasticity (Gyourko and Saiz 2003).
This study found renovation demand to be very inelastic, with an elasticity estimated to be –0.28.
On the other hand, housing supply appears to be very elastic – consistent with the highly competitive
nature of the residential construction market and the large number of small contractors. Because it is very
easy to enter (and to leave) the construction business, supply is very responsive to changes in prices,
especially in the long run.2 Based on the literature surveyed, estimates of housing supply elasticities tend
to range from 1.0 to 4.0, but a couple of studies found elasticities as high as 13 or higher (DiPasquale and
Wheaton 1994, Topel and Rosen 1988, Blackley 1999, Malpezzi and Maclennan 2001). No elasticity
numbers specific to the supply of renovation services could be found.
Several characteristics of RRP tend to make its demand more price elastic than the demand for housing in
general. For example:
 The existence of close substitutes to compliant RRP. These substitutes include:
 Do-It-Yourself RRP –owners of buildings may be tempted to do their own RRP work
without proper training and certification.
 Firms that do not complying with the regulations. These regulations may be difficult to
enforce against contractors, particularly the large number of small contractors who may
be hard to identify and monitor.
 Reductions in the scope of the projects, or postponement of the projects, to compensate
for the price increase. Purchasers can reduce other RRP-related costs by substituting
lower-priced fixtures/finishes and/or less extensive remodeling.
 Many RRP projects are discretionary. The price elasticity of discretionary projects is likely to be
higher than replacement projects (e.g. new roof). For discretionary RRP projects, it is relatively
2 Note – stock adjustment models give lower elasticities than flow models. Malpezzi and Maclennan (2001).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 3-28
easy for the purchaser to reduce the scale/scope of the project, postpone the project, or never do
it.
Offsetting these characteristics that foster higher elasticities of demand, are ones that foster lower
elasticities. The major one is that the product purchased cannot be separated from the firm providing the
product, which is true of all services. In addition to the various RRP events analyzed in the subsequent
chapters, RRP firms themselves are relatively differentiated. Some firms specialize in high-end,
complicated projects (e.g. elaborate new kitchens) while other firms specialize in performing small
routine tasks (repainting apartments at tenant turn-over). Some firms only work in historic or Victorian
homes, while others will work on any type of home. Some firms do only one type of project (e.g.
replacing siding) while other firms will do any and all types of RRP work. This differentiation results in
lower demand elasticities, because producers may not be considered particularly close substitutes.
 To the extent that lead-safe work can be distinguished from non-lead-safe work, a higher price
can be charged for it.
 Many contractors already employ lead-safe practices (or at least control the dispersion of dust and
clean well before leaving). The regulations will serve to reduce this differentiation.
Second, the nature of RRP projects may also reduce price competition. For relatively small jobs, property
owners frequently will not get multiple bids – the assumed cost of the job does not warrant the effort. In
this case, the compliance cost can be passed on without fear of losing the work. In the case of large jobs,
where owners will get bids, compliance costs will make up a relatively small proportion of the total cost
and, again, passing on the costs may be easy.
Characteristics of the purchaser of the RRP services may also affect their demand price elasticity. High-
income purchasers are likely to be less price sensitive than low-income purchasers. In addition, owners of
rental properties may be more price sensitive than owner occupants because they have different objective
functions. Owner-occupants operate so as to maximize their utility (their enjoyment of the house) and
asset growth is likely to enter their decision as a secondary factor. Owners of rental housing, on the other
hand, are assumed to be maximizing their profits. It is reasonable to expect that the optimal level of
capital of an absentee landlord’s rental building is lower than that of an owner-occupier’s house, since the
landlord’s marginal rent revenue from renovations is likely to be less than the homeowner’s marginal
utility.
Because of the lack of detailed price elasticity estimates for RRP, the analysis in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 does
not incorporate any reduction in professional RRP activities in response to the cost increases resulting
from the regulation.

4. Costs of the Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule
Revisions
The proposed revisions to the LRRP program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision for owner-
occupied target housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence, and
(2) an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners
and occupants of renovated structures.
The costs associated with the revisions to the §402(c) Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting (LRRP)
Rule are divided into four categories for the purposes of this analysis: (1) work practice costs, (2) training
costs, (3) certification costs (which include the firm’s paperwork burden and EPA administrative and
enforcement costs), and (4) recordkeeping checklist provision costs. The costs associated with the first
three components are all attributable to the elimination of the opt-out provision, which will extend the
2008 LRRP requirements to additional housing units. In addition to the work practice costs associated
with the RRP events in these housing units, this change is expected to result in more individuals and firms
seeking training and certification. The fourth component, recordkeeping checklist provision costs, applies
to all housing units regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule as well as the additional housing units that would
no longer be eligible for the opt-out provision.
The general approach of the analysis is to first estimate the number of affected activities or entities and
then estimate the incremental regulatory cost per-activity or entity affected. Finally, the incremental costs
and the number of affected activities and entities are combined to estimate the total costs. The analysis
estimates the total costs associated with the first three years of regulation and then extrapolates to the
costs of the regulation over a fifty year period—estimated with three and seven percent discount rates.
The chapter is organized as follows: Section 4.1 defines the regulatory options considered in this analysis;
Section 4.2 estimates the number of regulated renovation, repair, and painting events under the various
regulatory scenarios; Section 4.3 presents the estimated costs of using the required work practices;
Section 4.4 presents the estimated number of firms, renovators, and workers seeking training and
certification; Section 4.5 presents the incremental training costs; Section 4.6 presents the estimated
certification, administrative and enforcement cost estimates; Section 4.7 presents the recordkeeping
checklist provision cost estimates; Section 4.8 presents the total costs of the regulation; and Section 4.9
presents the total costs associated with various alternative regulatory options.
4.1 Definitions of Options
This economic analysis considers various regulatory options. The effective date for the recordkeeping
checklist requirement is June 2010 under all options. However, options A through D differ in terms of
the effective dates of the elimination of the opt-out provision. In addition, the economic analysis
considers four options with varying work practice requirements, Options E1 through E4. Table 4-1
summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they are described in more detail below.
Options A and D both have effective dates of June 2010 for the elimination of the opt-out provision, but
Option A does not phase in the opt-out elimination while Option D limits opt-out elimination to pre-1960
structures during Phase 1 of the regulation and expands the requirements to structures built between 1960
and 1978 in Phase 2, which has an effective date of June 2011. Options B and C have effective dates of
January 2011 and June 2011 for the elimination of the opt-out provision, respectively and neither option
phases in this requirement.
Options E1 through E4, analyzed in Section 4.9, have the same effective dates and universe of regulated
structures as Option A, but consider alternative work practice requirements. Option E1 has the same
containment requirements as specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any cleaning or cleaning

verification work practices. Option E2 has the same cleaning and cleaning verification requirements as
specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any containment work practices. Option E3 has the
same cleaning requirements as specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not include any containment or
cleaning verification work practices. Option E4 has the same containment, cleaning and cleaning
verification requirements as specified in 40 CFR 745.85, but does not restrict or prohibit any paint
removal practices.

4.1.1 Affected Universe
The term “target housing” is defined in TSCA Section 401 as any housing constructed before 1978,
except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child under 6 resides or is expected
to reside in such housing) or any 0-bedroom dwelling. A child-occupied facility (COF) is defined as ‘‘a
building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978, visited regularly by the same child, under the
age of six, on at least 2 different days within any week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that
each day’s visit lasts at least 3 hours and the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the
combined annual visits last at least 60 hours. Child-occupied facilities may include, but are not limited
to, day-care centers, preschools and kindergarten classrooms” as follows:
 Kindergartens: Located in public and private schools.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-3
 Pre-Schools and Daycare centers: Organized (licensed) facilities located in public or
commercial buildings.
 Family daycare: Organized (licensed) daycare facilities located in the provider’s home.
 Informal daycare: Informal (i.e. not licensed) day care providers, including relatives and non-
relatives. Some of these providers may be paid for their services.
Some COFs are also target housing (e.g., daycare facilities located in the provider’s home). The 2008
LRRP rule applied to rental units, all target housing COFs, and all owner-occupied target housing units
where a child under the age of 6 resides within the vintage categories specified above. The 2008 LRRP
rule provided an opt-out provision for owner-occupied target housing units that are not COFs and where
no child under the age of 6 or pregnant woman resides. The proposed revisions to the LRRP program
include the removal of this opt-out provision and an additional requirement that the renovator provide a
copy of their recordkeeping checklist to owners and occupants of renovated structures.
4.1.2 Containment, Cleaning, and Verification Standards
The containment, cleaning, and verification standards discussed in this section are the same for Options
A-D as for the 2008 LRRP rule. Options with alternative work practice are considered in section 4.9 of
this analysis.
4.1.3 Occupant protection
Under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 745.85(a)(1), work areas must be
clearly defined with signs warning occupants and other persons not involved in renovation activities to
remain outside of the work area. These signs must be posted before beginning the renovation and must
remain in place until the renovation has been completed and the work area has been verified to have been
adequately cleaned. If warning signs have been posted in accordance with HUD’s Lead Safe Housing
Rule (24 CFR §35.1345(b)(2)) or OSHA’s Lead in Construction Standard (29 CFR §1926.62(m)),
additional signs are not required by this proposal.
4.1.4 Containing the work area
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(2), a firm must contain the work area so that no visible dust or debris leaves
the work area while the renovation is being performed. Containment refers to methods of preventing
leaded dust from migrating beyond the work area. It includes everything from the simple use of
disposable plastic drop cloths to the sealing of openings with plastic sheeting.
4.1.4.1 Interior renovations
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(2)(ii), a firm must take the necessary work site preparation steps in order to
prevent dust and debris from leaving the work area. Renovation projects generate varying amounts of
leaded dust, paint chips, and other lead-contaminated materials depending on the type of work, area
affected, and applied work methods. For example, repairing a small area of damaged drywall would
likely generate less lead-contaminated dust and debris than sanding a large area in preparation for
painting.
4.1.4.2 Exterior renovations
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(2)(ii), a firm preparing the work area for an external renovation must close all
doors and windows within and below the area undergoing renovation and to cover the ground with plastic
sheeting or other disposable impermeable material extending out from the edge of the structure a
sufficient distance to collect falling paint debris. In addition, doors within the work area that must be
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-4
used while the job is being performed must be covered with plastic sheeting to prevent dust and debris
from entering the building.
4.1.5 Waste from renovations
Renovation projects can generate a considerable amount of waste material. Lead-contaminated building
components and work area debris must be handled carefully to prevent the release of lead-contaminated
dust and debris. Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(3), a firm must contain the waste from renovation activities to
prevent releases of dust and debris before the waste is removed from the work area for storage or
disposal. If a chute is used to remove waste from the work area, it must be covered. At the conclusion of
each work day and at the conclusion of the renovation, waste that has been collected from renovation
activities must be stored under containment, or behind a barrier that prevents release of dust and debris
out of the work area and prevents access to dust and debris.
In addition, transporting lead-based paint waste in uncovered vehicles is a possible source of releases of
paint chips or dust. Therefore, lead-based paint waste from RRP activities must be transported under
containment that prevents identifiable releases (e.g., inside a plastic garbage bag).
4.1.6 Cleaning the work area
Under 40 CFR §745.85(a)(4), a firm must clean the work area until no visible dust, debris, or residue
remains. The firm must also conduct a more thorough, specialized cleaning, which would remove both
visible debris and dust particles too small to be seen by the naked eye.
4.1.7 Cleaning verification
Under 40 CFR §745.85(b), a firm must conduct an additional cleaning verification step following the
visual inspection. This step involves wiping the windowsills and floors with specialized cleaning cloths
and comparing them to a cleaning verification card developed and distributed, or otherwise approved, by
EPA for the purpose of determining, through comparison of disposable cleaning cloths with the card,
whether post renovation cleaning has been properly completed.
4.1.8 Exceptions
As defined in 40 CFR §745.83, minor repair and maintenance activities (including minor electrical work
and plumbing) are not considered renovations and are not subject to the work practice requirements
described above if they disrupt 6 square feet or less of a painted surface per room for interior renovations
or 20 square feet or less for exterior renovations. Such activities are only considered minor maintenance
if they do not involve prohibited or restricted practices, window replacement, or demolition of painted
surface areas.
Under 40 CFR §745.82, the work practice requirements of the rule do not apply to renovations that only
affect painted components that a certified inspector or risk assessor has determined do not contain
regulated lead-based paint (at least 1.0 mg/cm2 or 0.5% by weight lead). Furthermore, the work practice
requirements do not apply to renovations that only affect painted components that have been
demonstrated to be free of regulated lead-based paint through the use of an EPA-recognized test kit by a
certified renovator. Test kits for LBP that are currently available have false positive rates that range from
47 percent to 78 percent. EPA believes that by the end of 2010, improved test kits will be developed that
will have a false positive rate of 10 percent or less.

4.2 Estimating the Number of Regulated Renovation, Repair, and Painting
Events
4.2.1 Estimating the Number of Regulated Renovation, Repair, and Painting Events in
Target Housing
To achieve the rule’s objective of controlling lead exposure through containment, cleanup, and
verification, most of the compliance costs associated with the RRP rule’s work practices pertain to the
room or area where the renovation work is performed. Therefore, this analysis defines a regulated event
as any group of renovation tasks where two or more square feet of a painted surface are disturbed in a
specific room or area of a housing unit. The 2003 American Housing Survey (AHS) is the primary data
source for the estimates of regulated RRP events that occur in owner-occupied housing. The 1995
Property Owners and Managers Survey (POMS) is the primary data source utilized for estimating the
number of regulated events in renter-occupied housing.
Following the methodology from the economic analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule (EPA 2008), event counts
are estimated separately by housing type (single-family or multi-family) and tenure of occupant (owner or
renter). The housing units affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision include both single-family
and multi-family owner-occupied units.1 Since single-family owner-occupied units have larger average
sizes compared to multi-family owner-occupied units, separate work practice compliance costs are
estimated for these two types of housing units. Since all rental units are ineligible for the opt-out
provision under the 2008 LRRP rule, no work practice costs, training costs, or certification costs are
associated with these units under the LRRP rule revision. However, recordkeeping checklist provision
costs are estimated for events in all housing types, since this provision affects both the units regulated
under the 2008 LRRP rule and the units that will be regulated under the removal of the opt-out provision.
Available renovation data do not include information specific enough to determine when a renovation
task disturbs a painted surface or when renovation tasks are performed together in the same room or area.
Thus, it was necessary to make some assumptions about which types of renovation tasks are likely to
disturb painted surfaces and which sets of tasks are likely to be performed together as part of one
renovation project. Note that the counts of exterior events for multi-family housing units are adjusted to
correspond to building-specific compliance costs. 2
4.2.1.1 Data Sources
U.S. Census: American Housing Survey
According to the U.S. Census (2005g):
The survey is conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD).
The American Housing Survey (AHS) collects data on the Nation's housing including apartments, single-
family homes, mobile homes, vacant housing units, household characteristics, income, housing and
neighborhood quality, housing costs, equipment and fuels, size of housing unit, and recent moves.
National data are collected in odd numbered years. Data for each of 47 selected Metropolitan Areas are
collected currently about every six years.
1 Multi-family owner-occupied units include rental properties where the owner resides in one of the units, owner-occupied condo
units, and owner-occupied co-op units.
2 For example, when siding is replaced on the outside of a three-unit building, the analysis accounts for this as one siding
replacement event rather than the siding replacement outside of three units.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-6
The surveys utilized in this analysis, 1997 and 2003, have sample sizes of 45,932 and 55,452,
respectively. Of the housing units sampled, 33,549 and 35,996, for the 1997 and 2003 surveys
respectively, have at least one bedroom, are not public housing, receive no rent subsidies, and were built
before 1980. The 2003 AHS groups housing units built in the 1970’s as units built between 1970-74 or
1975-1979, so this analysis counts all housing units built before 1980 in the pre-1978 regulated universe.
The sample weights provided by the U.S. Census for analyzing the AHS data were designed so that
estimates using the provided sample weights would represent the national housing population. However,
the U.S. Census weights were not designed to correct for underreporting within housing units—such as
information reported on occupants living in the housing units. Since there is underreporting within-
housing units, estimates of the number of individuals calculated using the U.S. Census weights results in
lower population estimates than those estimated using other U.S. Census population data sources. In
addition, according to Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies (personal communication with Kermit
Baker, August 2005), it appears that the 2003 survey labels too many housing units as vacant; these units
are actually occupied by individuals that did not respond to the survey. To correct for this bias, the Joint
Center for Housing Studies has adjusted the weights provided by the U.S. Census for the 2003 AHS.
These adjusted weights provided by the Joint Center for Housing Studies are utilized for all of the
calculations using the 2003 AHS in this analysis; population estimates calculated from the AHS are more
closely aligned with other U.S. Census population estimates when calculated with these adjusted weights.
U.S. Census: Property Owners and Managers Survey
According to the U.S. Census (2005h):
The Property Owners and Managers Survey (POMS) was designed to learn more about rental housing and
its providers. The purpose was to gain a better understanding of the property owners and managers on
whom the nation depends to provide affordable rental housing and what motivates their rental and
maintenance policies. Survey interviews were conducted between November 1995 and June 1996.
A nationwide sample of approximately 16,300 housing units which were rented or vacant-for-rent in the
1993 American Housing Survey National Sample (AHS-N) was selected and a questionnaire was mailed
to the property owner, manager, or other agent of the owner of each property containing a selected unit.
Detailed information was collected on maintenance, management practices, tenant policy, financial
aspects of rental property ownership, owner characteristics, and related topics.
POMS Sample Areas
The addresses included in the POMS sample were limited to counties and independent cities in the 438
sampling areas used for the Census Bureau's 1993 American Housing Survey (AHS) National Sample.
Units Included
A unit (and the property containing the unit) was included in the survey if it was a privately owned rental
unit in the 1993 AHS-N and was still a rental at the time of the POMS (November 1995 to June 1996). A
unit was considered a rental if it was either rented for cash rent, occupied by someone other than the
owner without payment of cash rent, or vacant but available for rent.
Since the POMS survey is relatively old (1995), this analysis first calculates the percentage of rental-
housing units performing renovations according to the POMS and then applies these percentages to the
corresponding number of rental-housing units in 2003 according to calculations using the AHS. This
approach is described in greater detail in the section below.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-7
4.2.1.2 Number of Regulated Events in Owner-Occupied Housing Units
The 2003 AHS is the primary data source used for estimating the number of RRP events in owner-
occupied housing for which compliance costs will be incurred. The 1997 AHS is also used for estimating
the number of RRP events since it contains some more specific renovation information that was not
included in the 2003 survey. AHS respondents report information about the ages of householders who are
defined in the survey as persons who live or sleep there most of the time. Thus, child-occupied
households are defined as those households with a householder under the age of 6 at the time of the RRP.
Child-occupied households are estimated to be households with a householder between the ages of one
and seven at the time of the survey since it is assumed that any RRP reported occurred a year earlier (RRP
performed up to two years earlier may be reported). It follows that a household is defined as being
occupied by a pregnant woman if there is a woman of childbearing age and a child who is under the age
of one at the time of the survey. This section describes how the numbers of events are estimated from the
renovation module of the AHS and the methodology for estimating the number of Interior Painting and
Exterior Painting events using data from the (one-time) 1997 lead paint module of the AHS.
AHS Renovation Tasks
The 2003 AHS allows respondents to report 40 different renovation tasks; this analysis categorized 24 of
these 40 as tasks that may disturb more than 6 square feet or more per room of a painted surface for
interior renovations, or 20 square feet or more for exterior renovations. Since tasks performed within two
years of the survey can be reported, it is assumed that half occurred in the first year and half occurred in
the second (i.e. the total number of events counted for the two year period is divided by two). Since do-it-
yourself RRP is not covered by the rule, only tasks that are reported to be performed by professionals are
included in the analysis.
Table 4-2 lists these 24 AHS renovation tasks by their event category. Note that while the respondents do
not specifically report whether or not painted surfaces were disturbed, the survey instrument instructed
them to only include major work.3 This analysis groups the 24 AHS tasks into seven event categories
(bathroom event, kitchen event, addition event, window/door event, wall-disturbing event, whole exterior
event, contained exterior event) based on the room or area where each AHS renovation task is likely to be
performed.
When a household reported multiple tasks to AHS that fall under the same EPA event category, it is
assumed that these tasks are performed together in the same area of the housing unit. Therefore, one set
of compliance costs are assumed to apply to each event. For example, if a household reported to AHS
that they replaced their air conditioning system and replaced their heating system, this analysis assumes
that they would incur the compliance costs associated with one wall-disturbing event. Compliance costs
are dependent on the size of the work area. Thus, when a household reported a wall-disturbing task to
AHS that is not specific to a particular room as well as a room-specific task—e.g. remodeling the kitchen
(specific to the kitchen) and replacing water pipes (not room-specific)—this analysis accounts for this as
one event with a work area that includes the room in which a room-specific task was reported. However,
if a household reported tasks to AHS corresponding to multiple room-specific events (such as remodeling
the kitchen and bathroom), these are counted as separate events. .
As shown in Table 4-2 and discussed above, some tasks reported to AHS are not necessarily confined to a
specific room or area of the unit. Most of these tasks are likely to involve disturbing a wall or the ceiling
3Specifically, the survey instrument instructed respondents with the following language: “We are only interested in
jobs that were MAJOR alterations or improvements, such as rewiring, a new roof, new windows or doors. Do NOT
include minor repairs or other routine maintenance.” This analysis assumes that jobs that were not reported to AHS
would qualify for the minor maintenance exception under the LRRP rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-8
(e.g., replacing wiring or pipes); in these cases, the tasks are assigned to a wall-disturbing event. Window
or door replacement tasks are assigned to their own event category, because (as described in Section
4.2.1.5) there is a higher likelihood that windows and doors contain lead-based paint (LBP), and this
analysis accounts for the likelihood of LBP by component type.
As stated above, the 2003 AHS did not explicitly ask respondents whether a renovation task involved
disturbing a painted surface. Therefore, in order to estimate the number of events subject to the rule’s
requirements, this analysis makes assumptions about which tasks might disturb paint. In general, when a
tasked reported to AHS will sometimes involve disturbing a painted surface, it is assumed that
compliance costs are incurred each time that task is reported to AHS. For example, replacing internal
water pipes will sometimes, but not always, require disturbing painted walls to access old pipes and
replace them with new ones. However, the analysis makes no adjustment to the AHS data to account for
the instances where no painted surfaces are disturbed or when a job will qualify for the minor
maintenance exception4. Sufficient data for making such an adjustment are not available. Thus, these
assumptions may lead to an overestimate of the number of regulated events.
In the case of adding or replacing heating equipment (AHS task 58) and/or central air conditioning
equipment (AHS task 57)—Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) tasks—it is assumed that
only a fraction of these HVAC tasks require disturbing a painted surface. In addition, 18 percent of the
households reporting tasks listed in Table 4-2 to AHS reported at least one HVAC task without reporting
any other wall-disturbing task. Therefore, assuming that all HVAC work disturbs painted surfaces likely
results in a substantial overestimate of wall-disturbing events that disturb LBP and are subject to the
LRRP rule.
The percentages of HVAC tasks that are assumed to disturb painted surfaces are estimated using the 1997
AHS. Unlike the 2003 AHS, the 1997 AHS distinguishes between installing new HVAC equipment and
replacing existing equipment. Since disturbing a painted surface is most likely to occur while performing
work on the HVAC ducts (which often are behind painted walls), it is assumed that this occurs when new
systems are installed but not when existing systems are replaced.5
In addition to the seven event definitions in Table 4-2, the analysis estimates costs for Interior Painting
events and Exterior Painting events. The remodeling module of the 2003 AHS data does not cover these
types of activities but the 1997 AHS did, so data from the 1997 (one-time) lead module are utilized to
estimate the number of these events.
4 Jobs that disturb 6 square feet or less of a painted surface per room for interior renovations or 20 square feet or less for exterior
renovations; and do not involve prohibited or restricted practices, window replacement, or demolition of painted surface
areas.
5 When heating equipment work (but not air conditioning work) is reported, 7 percent and 9 percent of these tasks involve adding
a new system for single- and multi-family units, respectively. When air conditioning equipment work (but not heating work) is
reported, 36 percent and 17 percent of these tasks involve adding a new system for single- and multi-family units, respectively.
When both heating and air-conditioning equipment work is reported, 52 percent and 29 percent of the households install a new
system for single- and multi-family units, respectively.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-9
Interior Painting Events
In the 1997 AHS, respondents were asked two questions related to painting activities that are used to
estimate the number of Interior Painting events. Respondents were asked:
 Was there any painting done on the inside of the unit?
 Before painting, did anyone sand or scrape off any of the old paint?
The number of painting events involving sanding or scraping is important because painting without
sanding, scraping, or other substrate preparation does not qualify as disturbing LBP and is not subject to
the LRRP rule.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-10
In contrast with the other AHS renovation questions, respondents were not asked to specify whether the
work was performed by a professional. Thus, obtaining a count of the number of Interior Painting events
is not as simple as adding up the number of respondents that answered yes to both of these questions. It is
also necessary to estimate: (1) how many of the respondents that had painting done with sanding or
scraping hired a professional to do the work, and (2) how many of these events occur in conjunction with
other professional events reported (so the analysis does not double count if, for example, someone painted
with sanding or scraping in their kitchen and reported both painting with sanding or scraping and
remodeling their kitchen).
This analysis assumes that 44 percent of the interior painting with sanding and scraping reported in AHS
was performed by professionals. An Angie’s List (Bucksot 2006) online poll found that 44 percent of
respondents reported that they hired professionals to perform painting rather than doing it themselves.
Since Angie’s List is used to find professional contractors it seems likely that respondents would be more
likely to hire professionals than the general population. Thus, this assumption may lead to an
overstatement of the number of interior painting events that are subject to the rule.
Exterior Painting Events
This analysis assumes that exteriors of 100 percent of homes with some paint on their exterior are painted
with sanding or scraping every eight years.6 Since data on the percentage of homes with some paint on
their exteriors are not available, it is assumed that 75 percent of all pre-1978 homes have some exterior
paint; this assumption is based on data from HUD’s (2001) National Survey of Dust Lead Hazards and
Allergens in Housing, which indicates that 70 percent of pre-1960 homes have some lead paint on their
exterior. Not all pre-1960 homes have exterior paint. But of those that do, nearly all have at least some
exterior lead-based paint. Since nearly all exterior painted surfaces on pre-1960 homes are likely to have
some lead paint, it was assumed that slightly more, 75 percent, of all pre-1978 homes have exterior
painted surfaces. The annual number of Exterior Painting events is estimated as one eighth of the number
of regulated structures with exterior paint.
4.2.1.3 Number of Regulated Events in Renter-Occupied Housing Units
The 1995 POMS is the primary data source used for estimating the number of RRP events in renter
occupied housing where compliance costs will be incurred. Renter occupied units are only affected by the
additional recordkeeping checklist requirement proposed as a revision to the LRRP rule. The 1997 and
2003 AHS are also used for estimating the number of renter-occupied RRP events, since these data
contain more current estimates of the number of potentially regulated households as well as some other
information not available from the POMS.
This section first describes how the POMS data are used to obtain the annual percentage of renter-
occupied housing units where there is a regulated RRP event. Second, it describes the methods employed
for combining the percentages estimated from the POMS and the AHS data to obtain an estimate of
regulated RRP events in renter-occupied units for the first year the rule is in effect.
POMS Data
The POMS data generally has less detail then the AHS but is still the best source of renter-occupied
renovation information available. The POMS asked property owners or managers about 12 or 13 types of
maintenance and repair activities (for single-family and multi-family units respectively) and about 11
types of capital improvements that may have been made to their properties. It is likely that 12 of these
6 According to the Painting and Decorating Council, exteriors of homes are usually painted every 4-12 years; thus, the analysis
uses the midpoint, eight, for estimating the number of Exterior Painting events.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-11
maintenance, repair, or upgrade activities require disturbing painted surfaces; these activities are listed in
Table 4-3 according to the event category that they are classified by in this analysis.
The percentage of units where at least one of the RRP activities listed under each event was performed is
calculated separately for single- and multi-family units. This is because the average square footage of
these two groups of housing differs, and the estimated costs for many of the work practices required by
the rule depend on the size of the work area. Similar to the owner-occupied event estimates, when
multiple tasks are reported in POMS, this analysis assumes that these tasks are performed together in the
same area. Therefore, the compliance costs are estimated based on those costs associated with the task
with the largest work area. Unlike in the AHS data, POMS respondents were not asked whether sanding
or scraping was performed before painting (and painting without sanding or scraping is not subject to the
rule’s requirements). Therefore, it is assumed that 40 percent of the households reporting interior
painting are subject to the rule’s requirements based on the percentage of rental households that reported
sanding or scraping before painting in the AHS.7
In POMS, questions about capital improvements were asked about the entire property rather than about a
specific unit. To account for this difference, it was assumed that a specific unit was worked on 40% of
the time an upgrade was reported for a property. Since properties average about three units each, this
assumption results in more renovation compared to the assumption that upgrades are performed on one
unit at a time. The assumption utilized in this analysis results in renovation frequencies in multi-family
properties that are similar to those estimated for single-family properties.
Window or door replacement tasks are assigned to their own event category, because (as described in
Section 4.2.1.5 there is a higher likelihood that windows and doors contain LBP, and this analysis
accounts for the likelihood of LBP by component type. Since POMS does not ask respondents about
replacing windows or doors, the frequency for these tasks is assumed to be the same in rental units as was
reported in AHS for owner-occupied units. Therefore, it is assumed that 3.7 and 3.4 percent of renter-
occupied single- and multi-family units, respectively, replace windows or doors each year. Since these
improvements are likely to be reported in the POMS data as “other major upgrades,” this analysis adjusts
downward the numbers of “other major upgrade” tasks that are reported in POMS to reflect this. Since 10
and 14.8 percent of owner-occupied single- and multi-family units, respectively, reported other major
upgrades, 37 and 23 percent of “other major upgrades” reported in the POMS are assumed to be window
or door replacements, for single- and multi-family units respectively.8
Similar to the methodology for the owner-occupied RRP event estimates, it is assumed that HVAC
related activities do not always incur compliance costs. The analysis assumes that compliance costs are
incurred 28 percent and 15 percent of the time for single- and multi-family units respectively, which is the
percentage of the time new equipment is installed when HVAC work is performed in owner-occupied
units according to the 1997 AHS.
7 The 40 percent of rental units that reported sanding or scraping before painting in AHS compares to the 35 percent
of owner-occupied units that reported sanding or scraping before painting in AHS.
8 37% = 3.7%/10% and 23% = 3.4%/14.8%.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-12
4.2.1.4 Extrapolating from the POMS and AHS Data
After calculating the percentages of rental units where RRP was performed in the event categories listed
in Table 4-3, the number of renter-occupied events in these categories are calculated by applying the
event frequencies calculated with the 1995 POMS data to the number of rental-units according to the
2003 AHS. It is assumed that Whole Exterior events and Contained Exterior events occur in rental units
with the same frequency as they do in owner-occupied units (since data on these types of events are not
available in the POMS). Additional tasks reported in the AHS data but not the POMS data are not
estimated for rental units since these renovation activities are fairly uncommon in rental units and likely
to already be reported as “other major upgrade” and counted as a wall-disturbing event.
Estimating the Number of Target Housing Events Affected by the Removal of the Opt-out
Provision
The LRRP revisions remove the opt-out provision from the LRRP rule for certain owner-occupied
housing units. Owner-occupied target housing units where a child under the age of six or a pregnant
woman resides, rental units, and COFs (including owner-occupied target housing units that qualify as
COFs) would not be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision because these units were not
eligible for this provision under the 2008 LRRP rule.
The number of housing units that would be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision is
estimated by taking the number of owner-occupied housing units and subtracting the number of owner-
occupied target housing units that: (1) have a child under the age of six or pregnant woman in residence,
or (2) are COFs.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-13
Owner-occupied housing units with a child under the age of six or pregnant woman in residence
The 2003 AHS data identifies owner-occupied housing units where a child under the age of six or a
pregnant woman resides. AHS respondents report information about the ages of householders, who are
defined by the survey as persons who live or sleep there most of the time. Thus, child-occupied
households are defined as those households with a householder under the age of 6 at the time of the RRP.
Child-occupied households are estimated as households with a householder between the ages of one and
seven at the time of the survey since it is assumed that any RRP reported occurred a year earlier (RRP
performed up to two years earlier may be reported). It follows that a household is defined as being
occupied by a pregnant woman if there is a woman of childbearing age and a child who is under the age
of one in the household at the time of the survey.
Owner-Occupied housing units that are COFs
COFs in target housing include family daycare providers and the homes of family, friends, and neighbors
who regularly care for someone else’s children. The estimated number of target housing COFs includes
care provided with and without compensation and relies primarily on estimates of the size of the childcare
workforce (Center for the Child Care Workforce 2002). The Center for the Child Care Workforce (2002)
report includes: (1) data on family child care providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes,
(2) paid relatives and non-relatives providing child care, and (3) unpaid relatives and non-relatives
providing child care.
The number of target housing COFs is projected based on estimates of the caregiver workforce in the
Center for the Child Care Workforce (2002) report. Based on a Wilder Research Center report, it is
assumed that 10 percent of family child care providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes
employ 2 workers (Wilder Research Center 2001, p.16). For the remaining childcare providers, one
worker is assumed per location. Based on 2003 American Housing Survey data for the general
population of housing, it is assumed that 65 percent of these housing units were built before 1978.
The number of target housing units where child care is provised was also adjusted to exclude those units
that are already included in the RRP rule universe because care is provided in a child’s own home, or
where the units do not qualify as COFs because less than six hours of care per-week is provided9. In
addition, the number of target housing COFs that are not eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008
LRRP rule because they are rental units or have a child under the age of six or pregnant woman in
residence must be estimated to avoid double counting. The basis for these adjustments is discussed
below.
Care Provided in Child’s Own Home
It is assumed that 22 percent of relatives and non-relatives (paid or unpaid) providing care provide it in
the child’s home based on a Wilder Research Center (2005, p.28) report on the results of the 2004
Minnesota Statewide Household Child Care Survey.
Less Than Six Hours of Care Per-Week is Provided
Of those providing care in their own home, it is assumed that 27 percent of relatives and non-relatives
(paid or unpaid) provide care for less than six hours a week (Wilder Research Center 2005, p.28). All
family daycare providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes are assumed to care for at least
one child for more than six hours a week.
9 There is not sufficient data to adjust for the other COF criteria that the building is visited at least 2 different days within any
week, that each day’s visits lasts at least 3 hours, or that the combined annual visits last at least 60 hours.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-14
Caregiver Lives in a Rental Unit
It is assumed that family, friend, and neighbor caregivers have the same likelihood of living in a rental
unit as the general population of target housing occupants (39 percent).
Caregiver has a Child Under Six Living With Them
Based on the January 2006 Current Population Survey (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2006), 16 percent
of Child Care Workers have children under six. Thus, it is assumed that 16 percent of in-home family
daycare providers (formal care providers) caring for unrelated children in their own homes have children
under the age of six. Based on the Wilder Research Center (2005, p.19) report, 57.5 percent of family,
friend, and neighbor caregivers (informal care providers) have children under the age of 12. Thus it is
assumed that half as many, or 29 percent, have children under the age of six.

rule.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-15
Target Housing Units Affected by the Removal of the Opt-out Provision
As described in Table 4-4, there are about 824,000 target housing COFs where no child under the age of
six or a pregnant woman resides. Thus, of the 47,080,000 owner occupied housing units (see Section 2.8
of Chapter 2):
 A child under six resides or pregnant woman resides in 6,370,000 units (see Section 2.8 of
Chapter 2)
 About 824,000 units are COFs where no child under the age of six or pregnant woman resides
(see Table 4-4)
Therefore, about 39,886,000 units would be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision.10 The
frequency of RRP events in these housing units is estimated using the 2003 AHS data as described in
section 4.2.1.2.
4.2.1.5 Likelihood of Positive Test Kit Result for LBP
It is assumed that all certified renovators use a test kit for LBP before performing any RRP, given that
performing this relatively inexpensive test may allow the renovator to avoid the costs of using Lead-Safe
Work Practices (LSWP) that are required when LBP is disturbed. Since LBP is most likely to be found
on certain components of housing units—and therefore most likely to be disturbed during certain types of
renovations—the analysis accounts for this by estimating LBP likelihoods specific to each event type.
These LBP likelihoods are estimated using data from HUD’s 2000 National Survey of Lead and
Allergens in Housing (HUD 2001).11 The survey has information on approximately 630 housing units
built before 1978 including data on the presence of LBP in certain rooms (e.g. kitchen) and on certain
components or surfaces (e.g. floors, walls, ceilings, doors and windows).
The probability that LBP is disturbed during a RRP event is estimated as the probability of LBP in any of
the rooms where RRP is performed or on any of the components that might be disturbed during the RRP
event. This assumption leads to an upward bias in the estimates of the number of events where LSWP are
required. For example, if there is LBP in the kitchen, it is assumed that a kitchen remodeling will disturb
LBP. However, the LBP component(s) will not necessarily always be disturbed. For example, the LBP
in the kitchen may be on the window trim, but the renovation may not disturb the window trim.
Unfortunately, there is no reasonable basis for correcting this bias using currently available data. For the
purposes of this analysis, data from HUD (2001) are used to estimate event-specific likelihoods of
positive test kit results based on the estimated likelihood of disturbing LBP for each event type, as
described in Table 4-5.
10 39,886,000 = 47,080,000 – 6,370,000 – 824,000.
11 In addition to the likelihood of the presence of lead-based paint varying by age of housing, there is evidence that
the concentration of lead in the paint varies by the age of housing. A review of the data in HUD 2000 is
presented in EPA 2005c. This document is available in the docket for this rulemaking.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-16
Test kits for LBP that are currently available have false positive rates that range from 47 percent to 78
percent. This analysis assumes a false positive rate of 63 percent, the midpoint, for the first year following
rule implementation. This analysis assumes that an improved test kit that will have a false positive rate of
10 percent or less will be in use by June 2011.12 A false negative rate of 5 percent is also assumed for
both the current and improved test kits. Thus, the likelihood of a positive test kit result in the first year is
estimated as 95 percent of the likelihood of LBP, plus 63 percent of the percentage of homes without
LBP. In the second year, the likelihood of a positive test kit result is estimated as 95 percent of the
likelihood of LBP plus 10 percent of the percentage of homes without LBP. Table 4-6 shows the
likelihoods of LBP that are used to estimate the percentage of events where LBP is disturbed.
In cases where a household performed more than one interior event, the likelihood of disturbing LBP is
estimated as the likelihood of LBP anywhere in the interior of the unit. There are two exceptions to this:
(1) when one of the events is an Addition, the Addition likelihood is used, and (2) when the sum of the
12 EPA believes that the sensitivity of test kits can be adjusted so the results reliably correspond to one of the two
Federal standards for lead-based paint (1.0 mg/cm2 and 0.5% by weight). EPA is working on the development
of test kits that accurately identify both the presence and absence of lead in paint at levels that exceed the
Federal standards. EPA is confident that improved test kits can be commercially available by September 2010,
although for ease of computation, this analysis does not assume they will be in use until June 2011.

Event Type

require some demolition of the interior and exterior)

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-17
individual event probabilities is less than the likelihood of LBP anywhere in the interior of the unit, the
sum of the event probabilities is used. These simplifying assumptions are necessary because the data are
not sufficient for calculating the joint probabilities that would be necessary for relaxing this assumption.
As a result, the estimates of the number of events where LSWP will be used are biased upward. That is,
for a housing unit performing multiple interior events, it is assumed that if there is LBP in the housing
unit, all the interior events in that unit require LSWP. However, the LBP component(s) may be disturbed
only in certain areas throughout the house, requiring less containment than is assumed. Similar to the
assumptions pertaining to households performing multiple interior events, for households performing
multiple exterior events the likelihood of disturbing LBP is assumed to be the maximum likelihood for
the events performed. Unlike for interior events, this is always the same as the largest and most costly
exterior event that determines the housing unit’s exterior compliance costs.
4.2.1.6 Event Sizes
For interior events, the average square footage of particular rooms was determined by taking the average
square footage of the whole unit from the AHS and reviewing house plans for homes of similar square
footage (Homestyles.com 2002). The work area sizes for wall-disturbing events were estimated as
follows:

single-family owner occupied home. The perimeter of a single-family renter unit was estimated to be 130
feet, which assumes that the proportion of a single-family renter unit has the same proportion of total square
footage to square footage of the first floor of a single-family owner unit. The perimeter of a multi-family

The structures in a Contained Exterior event are outside the main body of the house and the structural work

estimated to be 60 feet (10’×20’). Containment is necessary along the entire perimeter of a detached
structure. However, it is assumed that less containment is required for attached contained exterior structures,
which are assumed to be attached to the main structure of the house along a 20 foot side of the detached
contained exterior structure. The analysis assumes half are attached structures and half are detached
structures.
a Estimated based on information from http://www.dreamhomesource.com (2005) on the average size of the first floor of nine
2,000 square foot two stories homes (1,280 sq. feet). The weighted average of a first floor was calculated using 2003 AHS data
which shows that 85% of single-family housing units are two stories high and the remaining 15% of homes are one story (i.e.,
first floor is 2,016 sq. feet).
4.2.1.7 Estimated Number of RRP Events in the First and Second Years
The numbers of regulated events are estimated using the methodology outlined above along with the
assumption that 75 percent of the RRP events subject to the rule’s requirements comply with the
requirements. This assumption is based on compliance rates observed for the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration’s (OSHA) regulations for the construction industry (Gilkeya 2003 and Weil 1999).
The variation in the number of regulated events in compliance under the different options reflects the
variation in the regulated universe.
Table 4-13 through Table 4-16 present the numbers of RRP events potentially affected by the removal of
the opt-out provision by type of event, for the first and second year the rule is in effect. Note that Option
C does not go into effect until the second year, so this option does not affect any events in the first year.
Each table shows the total number of events where compliance costs are incurred, labeled “All Events.”
“All Events” include all the events where a test kit was used to test for LBP. The columns labeled “LBP
Events” include all the events where test kits correctly identified that LBP was present; it does not include
events where there was a false positive or a false negative test kit result. The columns labeled “LSWP
Events” include all events where there was a positive test kit result – including false positives. The
LSWP event estimate is the estimated number of events where compliance costs associated with cleaning,
containment, and verification are incurred. Table 4-17 through Table 4-19 present the likelihoods of
events where LBP is correctly identified as well as those where there was a positive test kit result (LSWP
Events).

Notes: Events where compliance costs are incurred include those that are: (1) subject to the rule’s
requirements, and (2) in compliance. Thus, this includes some events where LSWP are not required because
a test kit indicates that LBP is not present. It excludes the 25% of regulated events that are assumed to be
noncompliant. A “-” indicates that zero events were estimated; a “0” indicates that fewer than 500 events
were estimated. All Events With Costs include those where there is a negative test kit result for LBP. LBP
Events include all the events where test kits correctly identified that LBP was present; it does not include
events where there was a false positive or a false negative test kit result. LSWP events include all events with
test kit results that are positive for LBP, including false positive results. See Table 4-1 for options
descriptions. Note that the number of LSWP events is equal to the number of LBP events (which exclude
false negatives) plus the number of false positive events; i.e., (LSWP Events) = (LBP Events) + ((All Events
With Costs) – (LBP Events)/0.95) * (False Positive Rate).

4.2.2 Estimating the Number of Regulated Renovation, Repair, and Painting Events in
COFs in Public or Commercial Buildings
This section describes the proposed methodology for estimating the number of events in daycare centers,
pre-schools and kindergartens—i.e., COFs in public or commercial buildings. Events in these structures
are all regulated under the existing LRRP program. Events in these structures, however, will be affected
by the proposed revision to require the provision of the recordkeeping checklist to owners or occupants.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-29
4.2.2.1 Data Sources
This section provides a brief summary of the primary data sources used to estimate the number of RRP
events in COFs in public or commercial buildings.
HUD's (2003) First National Health Survey of Child Care Centers
HUD’s (2003) First National Environmental Health Survey of Child Care Centers was conducted under
the sponsorship of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to assess children's
potential exposure to lead, allergens, and pesticides in licensed child care centers. The survey data were
collected in 2001 and were published in 2003; they include data on 98 childcare centers that are known to
have been built before 1978. Note that while the data only includes child care centers, some of these
centers are located in schools and the information on lead likelihoods, characteristics of classrooms, and
the frequencies of painting are extrapolated to elementary schools with pre-schools or kindergartens. This
survey can be used to estimate lead levels in dust, paint, and soil in childcare centers. This analysis uses
these data to estimate: (1) likelihoods of LBP on various components that might be disturbed during RRP,
(2) various characteristics of the rooms and buildings (such as the size and number of rooms, windows,
and doors), and (3) the frequency of interior painting, exterior painting, and cleaning.
Whitestone (2006) Building Maintenance and Repair Cost Reference 2006-2007
Whitestone Research is a commercial service that provides data on the frequency of different types of
maintenance activities and their costs, for use by building managers and investors. For over 50 building
types (including both elementary schools and childcare centers), Whitestone defines a typical building
and lists the building components they are likely to contain (e.g. type of windows, type of interior and
exterior wall coverings, type of heating system, etc.). Whitestone lists the frequency and type of repairs
each building component will need, including replacements. The Whitestone data can be used to estimate
the types and frequency of RRP work for COFs in public or commercial buildings.
4.2.2.2 Description of Methodology for Estimating the Number of RRP Events in COFs in Public or
Commercial Buildings
The basic steps for estimating the number of events are:
1. Estimate the number of COFs (rooms and buildings),
2. Estimate the frequency of performing an event,
3. Estimate the likelihood that an event will be covered by the rule (disturbing paint).
4. Combine the results of the above four steps to estimate: (1) annual number of buildings and
classrooms where more than six square feet of a painted surface per room is disturbed for interior
renovations, or twenty square feet for exterior renovations.
The methodology for performing these steps is described below in more detail.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-30
Step 1: Estimate the Number of Public or Commercial Building COFs (rooms and centers)
Based on the number of daycare centers reported to be located in schools according to the HUD (2003)
data, 22 percent of the estimated 115,000 centers are estimated to be located in elementary schools. Thus,
these 25,300 daycare centers are assumed to be accounted for in the estimated 40,190 elementary schools
with pre-schools and kindergartens. Although an additional 1,421 pre-schools are located in schools
without kindergarten programs (such as middle or high schools), these pre-schools are included in the
count of daycare centers for the purposes of the total cost analysis. In summary, there are 40,190
elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens, 37,049 elementary schools with kindergartens but
no pre-school and 89,261 daycare centers (see Section 2.9 of Chapter 2).13 Using data from the
Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) for education buildings (DOE 2003), it
was estimated that 58 percent of buildings were built prior to 1978. The HUD (2003) data was used to
estimate the relative number of pre-1960 buildings.
This analysis considers three categories of COFs in public or commercial buildings: (1) daycare centers,
(2) elementary schools with kindergartens only, and (3) elementary schools with kindergartens and pre-
schools. The analysis distinguishes between these types of buildings because they have different sizes
and thus different compliance costs. The number of childcare center classrooms was estimated using the
HUD (2003) data. The estimated numbers of pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms per building
are 3.8 and 6.7 for elementary schools with kindergartens and elementary schools with pre-schools and
kindergartens, respectively. The number of pre-school classrooms per building was estimated based on
the number of pre-kindergarten schools and classes reported in the NCES Prekindergarten in U.S. Public
Schools 2000-2001 Report (U.S. Department of Education 2003). The number of kindergarten
classrooms per building was estimated based on the number of kindergarten schools and classes reported
in the Full-Day and Half-Day Kindergarten in the United States 1998-1999 (U.S. Department of
Education 2003). In addition, this analysis accounts for RRP events in spaces other than classrooms in the
public or commercial buildings that might be visited by children under the age of six on a regular basis
(libraries, cafeterias, gyms, etc.).
Spaces in Addition To Regular Kindergarten and Pre-Kindergarten Classrooms Regularly Visited
by Children Under Age Six
At least for part of the year, children under the age of 6 are in first grade. In addition, in some schools
children under the age of 6 might use other rooms on a regular basis, including libraries, cafeterias, gyms,
computer rooms, and music and/or art rooms.
According to NCES’s 2005 After-School Programs and Activities Survey of the National Household
Education Surveys Program data, just under 0.5 percent of all first graders are 5 years old. Thus there are
nearly 19,000 first graders who are age 5 (NCES 2005). The survey collected age data as of December
31st of 2004 and as such does not include children who turned 6 after the start of the school year in
September but before the end of December. Thus it is thus likely that this figure underestimates the
number of children who are 5 years old when they enter first grade. While the total number of five year
olds in first grade is relatively small, any class with one of these children is subject to the rule.
Unlike for pre-kindergartens or kindergartens, there is no data on the number of first grade classrooms in
the United States. The number of first grade classrooms was estimated based on student enrollment and
the average number of first graders in a typical classroom. Data on the average number of students in first
grade were obtained from four states – Texas, New Hampshire, New York, and Illinois (Texas Education
13 The 89,261 daycare centers include 1,421 schools with pre-kindergarten but no kindergarten, and 87,840 daycare
centers located outside of schools (see Section 2.9 of Chapter 2).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-31
Agency 1999; New Hampshire Department of Education 2006; New York State Office of the State
Comptroller 2005; ASU 2007). The number of students per classroom reported in these states ranged
from 18 to 21.6, with an average of 20 students per classroom. To estimate the total number of first grade
classrooms, the total number of first graders (3,663,005 in public schools + 439,510 in private schools)
was divided by the average of 20 students per first-grade class. The resulting number of classrooms
(205,126) was divided by the total number of schools with a first grade (51,572 public schools + 22,362
private schools) to estimate the average number of classrooms per school.14 Based on these calculations,
there is an average of 2.8 first grade classrooms per school.
Data were not available on the amount of the school day or week that kindergartners and first graders
spend outside of their primary classroom or the rooms they visit. Nor were data available on the average
size of these rooms in older elementary schools. Thus the following assumptions were made:
Gyms are about the size of 5 classrooms. This estimate is based on the assumption that most elementary
school gyms will accommodate a basketball court. A basketball court is 3,108 square feet and an average
classroom is 729 square feet (ProDunkHoops 2006; HUD 2003). Thus, a basketball court is about 4.25
classrooms, which was rounded up to 5 to accommodate bleachers, etc.
 Cafeterias are about the same size as an elementary school gym.
 Elementary school libraries are about the size of 2 classrooms
 Students were also assumed to regularly spend time in at least one other classroom (e.g. computer
room, music or art room).
Estimates were generated using data on the percentage of public elementary schools that have various
non-classroom facilities as follows:
 Cafeteria 98%15 (NCES 2006g)
 Library 95% (NCES 2004)
 Gymnasium 80% (NCES 2007)
Using these percentages and the classroom-equivalent sizes for rooms specified above, the equivalent of
an additional 12 rooms was assumed to be covered by the rule because children under the age of 6 use
them in addition to their regular classrooms. The calculation is:
98% * (1 cafeteria)*(5 classroom equivalents) + 95% * (1 library)*(2 classroom equivalents) +
80% * (1 gym)*(5 classroom equivalents) + (1 extra room) = 12 classroom equivalents.
14 The numbers of first graders in public and private schools were drawn from NCES’s Overview of Public
Elementary and Secondary Students, Staff, Schools, School Districts, Revenues, and Expenditures: School Year
2004-2005 and Fiscal Year 2004 (NCES 2006a) and Characteristics of Private Schools in the United States:
Results From the 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey (NCES 2006e), respectively. The numbers of
public and private schools with first grades were calculated using NCES’s Common Core of Data Public
Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey Data, 2004-2005 (NCES 2006b) and 2003-2004 Private School
Universe Survey Data (NCES 2006f), respectively.
15 This figure is based on the number of schools providing food services in a cafeteria or lunch room. Since many
elementary schools use the gymnasium as a lunch room, there may be substantial overlap between cafeterias
and gymnasiums. Also, in some schools children do not eat in the cafeteria until 1st grade. Thus, this may
overestimate the areas in schools potentially impacted by the rule.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-32
In addition, an average of 2.8 first grade classrooms are assumed to be covered by the rule, making the
average total number of additional classroom equivalents 14.8. The estimated numbers of pre-
kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms per building are 3.8 and 6.7 for elementary schools with
kindergartens and elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens, respectively. Thus, the average
numbers of classrooms and classroom equivalents covered under the rule are 18.6 and 21.5 for elementary
schools with kindergartens and elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens, respectively.
The resulting estimates of the number of regulated daycare centers and elementary schools with
preschools or kindergartens, as well as the number of regulated classrooms in these buildings are
presented in Table 4-20.
Step 2: Estimate the frequency of performing an event
Interior Painting
When asked how often they repainted the interior, respondents to the HUD (2003) survey could respond:
(1) every 1 to 4 years, (2) every 5 to 10 years, or (3) every 10 to 20 years. The average frequency of
painting was estimated using the midpoints for these ranges (weighted averages were calculated using the
buildings’ survey weight). On average, building interiors are painted every 4.4 years. It is assumed that
35 percent involve sanding and/or scraping before painting, based on data for housing units (EPA 2006).
Exterior Painting
When asked how often they repainted the exterior, respondents to the HUD (2003) survey could respond:
(1) every 1 to 4 years, (2) every 5 to 10 years, or (3) every 10 to 20 years. The average frequency of
painting was estimated using the midpoints for these ranges (weighted averages were calculated using the
building’s survey weight); on average, buildings paint their exterior every 7 years. Thus, the analysis
assumes that buildings with exterior paint (about 90 percent of the buildings have exterior paint) are
painted every seven years. It is assumed that the exterior is always sanded or scraped before painting
(EPA 2006).
Wall Disturbing Events
The number of events where walls are disturbed is considered separately from those events that generally
disturb trim, doors, and windows, which have higher likelihoods of LBP. The number of wall disturbing
events is estimated using the Whitestone Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Cost Reference. The
Whitestone M&R Cost Reference provides information on the frequency of a wide variety of maintenance
and repair activities. As described in their Preface, the book is intended for two audiences.
“The first group has a common need to know the long-term M&R costs of specific
buildings. This group consists of analysts, developers, architects, bankers, investors and

*The stock of public or commercial buildings is assumed to decline by 0.41% per year. That rate was
calculated using the average annual compound rate of change in the pre-1980 housing stock using data from
the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census (U.S. Census Bureau 1990 and 2000c).

others who must account for M&R costs that, over a 50-year building lifetime, can easily
exceed the cost of construction. … The second audience consists of facility managers and
all those responsible for estimating and justifying facility maintenance budgets.”
The bulk of the reference is composed of detailed lists of building components and M&R tasks, along
with their average size, frequency of the M&R tasks, trade involved (e.g. plumber, carpenter) and
estimated cost. The reference also provides building profiles for 56 different building types, including
childcare centers and elementary schools. Each profile lists the typical building components for that
building type and then generates a 50-year stream of expenditures that cover these building components.
The number of wall disturbing events is estimated based on the following categories of RRP events:
 Replace Plumbing Pipes and Fixtures
 Replace HVAC Systems
 Replace Electrical System and Fixtures
Using the frequencies of major renewal and replacement tasks that are likely to disturb lead-based paint
for the building components described in the childcare center and elementary school profiles, this analysis
developed the assumed frequency of RRP events shown in Table 4-21.

Source: Derived from Whitestone M&R Reference (2006).
Because historical data on M&R activities for wall disturbing events in these buildings are not available,
and to simplify the calculations, it is assumed that the RRP events are evenly spread over the population
of buildings. In other words, if a plumbing replacement job typically occurs once every 10 years, the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-35
analysis assumes that one-tenth of the buildings experience this RRP event in any given year. Thus in
any given year, it is assumed that plumbing is replaced in 10 percent of buildings, HVAC systems are
replaced in 10 percent of buildings and electrical systems are replaced in 5 percent of buildings. If
multiple jobs are occurring in the same building, the analysis assumes they occur at different times in the
year and thus each incurs its own work practice costs. To the extent that these events are actually
occurring at the same time, the analysis overestimates the work practice costs. The Whitestone data does
not include information on the frequency of unscheduled maintenance events. Instead, this analysis
assumes that 1 out of 11 classrooms have an unscheduled maintenance job performed in a given year –
this is approximately one job per building. The number of unscheduled maintenance events is based on
an assumption, and not on empirical data.
Window and Door Replacement Events
The number of events where windows and doors are disturbed is also estimated using the Whitestone
M&R Cost Reference, which listed the frequency with which door and window types typically found in
elementary schools and daycare centers must be replaced—about every 20 years. Thus, in any given
year, windows and doors are assumed to be replaced in 5 percent of buildings.
Step 3: Estimate the likelihood that an event will be affected by the rule (disturbing paint)
The next step is to estimate how many events in public or commercial building COFs disturb painted
surfaces and therefore would be affected by the recordkeeping checklist provision requirement of the
LRRP rule revision. This analysis considers four types of events for public or commercial buildings: (1)
Interior Painting, (2) Exterior Painting, (3) Window Replacement, and (4) Wall Disturbing Events (e.g.,
plumbing, electrical). It is estimated that 35 percent of interior painting jobs involve disturbing painted
surfaces (i.e., sanding and/or scraping before painting), based on data for housing units (EPA 2006). All
other event types are always assumed to disturb painted surfaces.
Step 4: Combine the results
The number of affected classrooms or buildings is multiplied by the frequency of renovation activities
that disturb painted surfaces to yield the number of events in public or commercial buildings where the
recordkeeping checklist will have to be provided by the renovator. These results are presented in Table 4-
22.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-36
4.3 Work Practice Compliance Costs
RRP projects generate varying amounts of leaded dust, paint chips, and other lead-contaminated materials
depending on the type of work, size of area affected, and work methods used. For example, repairing a
small area of damaged drywall is likely to generate less lead-contaminated dust and debris than sanding a
large area in preparation for painting. Because of this variability, the size of the area that must be isolated
and the containment methods used will vary from project to project. Large renovation projects could
involve one or more rooms and potentially encompass an entire home or building while small projects
may involve a portion of a room or a building’s exterior. The necessary work area preparations will
depend on the size of the surface(s) being disturbed, the method used in disturbing the surface, and the
building layout. The certified renovator assigned to a renovation would weigh all of these factors in
determining the appropriate work area size for that particular situation. For example, repairing a small
area of damaged drywall would probably require a smaller work area while demolition work would
probably require a larger work area in order to prevent the migration of dust and debris from the work
area.
Note that the costs of the proposed action as estimated in the Economic Analysis are expressed in 2005
dollars. To express values in terms of current dollars, the Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic
Product as determined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis can be consulted for an indication of how
nominal prices for goods and services produced in the economy have changed over time. From 2005 to
the second quarter of 2009, the implicit price deflator increased from 100 to 109.686, a difference of
approximately 10 percent (BEA 2009).
4.3.1 LBP Test Kit Compliance Costs
It is assumed that spot test kits are used to test for LBP before each RRP event where a lead inspection
has not been performed; they are inexpensive to use and a negative result will allow the renovator to forgo
the more costly containment, cleaning and verification requirements. Lead test kits currently can be

was calculated using the average annual compound rate of change in the pre-1980 housing stock

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-37
purchased in bulk at a cost of approximately $0.50 per test. It is assumed that the renovator will take an
average of four samples, because some jobs may disturb multiple components (walls, trim, windows, etc.)
or multiple rooms, and testing four samples will require about 15 minutes of a certified renovator’s time.
The loaded wage rate for certified renovators is $31.64/hour16. Thus, testing using the test kits is
estimated to cost $10 per event (15 minutes * $31.64/hour + 4 test kits * $0.50/test = $10).
RRP purchasers may choose to have x-ray fluorescence (XRF) testing conducted to detect the presence of
LBP instead of using a test kit. XRF testing has the advantage of having lower false positive rates but the
testing cost per event is much higher than a test kit. Therefore, it is assumed that test kits are used in lieu
of XRF testing.
4.3.2 Containment, Cleaning, and Verification
The containment and cleaning practices covered in the cost estimates are:17
For large interior events:
 Remove or cover all objects in the room where the renovation will be performed including
furniture, rugs, and window coverings.
 Close and cover all ducts opening into the room with taped-down plastic sheeting or other
impermeable material.
 Close windows and doors in the work area. Doors must be covered with plastic sheeting or other
impermeable material. Doors used as an entrance to the work area must be covered with plastic
sheeting or other impermeable material in a manner that allows workers to pass through while
confining dust and debris to the work area.18
 Cover the floor with taped-down plastic sheeting or other impermeable material. Place a tack pad
at the edge of the sheeting at the entrance to the room. Cover paths through the rest of the
buildings used by persons performing the renovation with plastic sheeting or other impermeable
material.
For small interior events:
 Remove or cover all objects within five feet of the work area, including furniture, rugs, and
window coverings.
 Close all windows, doors, and ducts within five feet of the work area. Cover ducts with plastic
sheeting or other impermeable material.
 Cover the floor within five feet of the work area with taped-down plastic sheeting or other
impermeable material.
 Wear disposable shoe covers and vacuum clothes.
16 Wages are based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005a) data, from the occupational employment statistics series. All
wages are fully loaded to account for fringe benefits with an average fringe rate for the construction industry of 23.5 percent.
Certified renovators’ fully loaded wages ($31.64/hour) are estimated from the wages earned by First-Line
Supervisors/Managers of Construction Trades and Extraction Workers (Occupation 47-1011) who work in the residential
building construction industry. Workers’ loaded wages ($16.94/hour) are estimated from the wages of Construction
Laborers who work in the residential building construction industry (Occupation 47-2061).
17 For the purposes of simplifying the modeling of the costs, some of the work practices described here are slightly
different than those practices required by the rule. The costs of these practices are expected to be representative
of the practices required by the rule.
18 This analysis assumes that contractors will meet the entrance door requirement by creating an airlock using two
sheets of plastic.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-38
For large and small exterior events:
 Cover the ground with plastic sheeting or other disposable impermeable material extending out
from the edge of the structure a sufficient distance to collect falling paint debris.
 Ensure that doors within the work area that must be used while the job is being performed are
covered with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material in a manner that allows workers to
pass through while confining dust and debris to the work area.
For all events:
 Post signs warning occupants and other persons not involved in renovation activities to remain
outside of the work area.
 Isolate the work area so that no visible dust or debris leaves the work area while the renovation is
being performed.
 Contain waste from renovation activities to prevent releases of dust and debris before the waste is
removed from the work area for storage or disposal.
 At the conclusion of each workday, store waste from renovation activities under containment, in
an enclosure, or behind a barrier that prevents release of dust and debris and prevents access to
dust and debris.
 Pick up all paint chips and debris.
 Remove plastic sheeting from objects in the work area and the floor or ground. Mist the sheeting
before folding it, fold the dirty side inward and tape shut to seal. Dispose of the sheeting as
waste.
Additional Cleaning for interior events
 Clean all objects and surfaces in and around the work area for interior events in the following
manner, cleaning from higher to lower:
a. Thoroughly vacuum all surfaces and objects in the work area, including furniture and
fixtures, with a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.
Where feasible, floor surfaces underneath a rug or carpeting must also be thoroughly
vacuumed with a HEPA vacuum.
b. Wipe all surfaces and objects in the work area with a damp cloth (except for walls,
ceilings, carpeted surfaces and upholstered surfaces).
c. Mop uncarpeted floors thoroughly, using a two-bucket mopping method that keeps
the wash water separate from the rinse water, or using a wet mopping system.
Post-renovation cleaning verification for interior events:
 A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine if visible amounts of dust,
debris or residue are still present. If visible amounts of dust, debris or residue are present, these
conditions must be eliminated by re-cleaning and another visual inspection must be performed.
 After a successful visual inspection, a certified renovator must:
a. Wipe uncarpeted floors within the work area with a disposable wet cleaning cloth.
The cloth must remain damp at all times while it is being used to wipe the floor for
post-cleaning verification. If the floor surface within the work area is greater than 40
square feet, the floor within the area must be divided into roughly equal sections that
are less than 40 square feet. Wipe each such section separately with a new
disposable cleaning cloth. If the cloths used to wipe each section of the floor within
the work area match the cleaning verification card, that section of the floor has been
adequately cleaned.
b. If the cloth used to wipe a particular section of floor does not match the cleaning
verification card, re-clean that section of the floor using the two-bucket mopping
method. Then wipe that section of the floor using a new wet cleaning cloth. If the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-39
cloth matches the cleaning verification card, that section of the floor has been
adequately cleaned.
c. If the second cloth used to wipe a particular floor section does not match the cleaning
verification card, re-clean that section of the floor using the two-bucket mopping
method described above and allow the entire floor within the work area to dry
completely. After the entire floor within the work area has completely dried, wipe
the floor with electrostatic cleaning cloths until a cloth that has wiped the entire floor
matches the cleaning verification card.19
d. Wipe the windowsills in the work area following the same protocol as used for floors
but with one wet-wipe per-windowsill.
e. When the area passes the post-renovation cleaning verification, remove the warning
signs.
Post-renovation cleaning verification for exterior events:
 A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine if visible amounts of dust,
debris or residue are still present. If visible amounts of dust, debris or residue are present, these
conditions must be eliminated by re-cleaning and another visual inspection must be performed.
When the area passes the visual inspection, remove the warning signs.
4.3.3 Cost of Each Containment and Cleaning Practice
The primary source of information on the cost of containment and cleaning practices, equipment, and
materials was the Means CostWorks Repair & Remodeling Cost Data (R.S. Means 2005). The data are
designed to help contractors estimate the cost of a renovation project. The database provides the total
labor and material costs of different renovation components on a unit basis. Most of the unit costs taken
from the R.S. Means database utilized in this analysis were for an asbestos abatement project, which
requires much more elaborate containment and clean up than required under the analyzed options. The
R.S. Means labor estimates have been adjusted downwards to reflect the less stringent requirements of the
LRRP rule. Depending on the type of activity, the unit may be a square foot, each item, or some other
measure. Table 4-23 and Table 4-24 show the material costs, labor requirements and total cost for the
containment and cleaning practices for interior events and exterior events, respectively.
19 It is assumed that a second cleaning is required 30 percent of the time and a third cleaning is required 2 percent of
the time.

Table 4-25 and Table 4-26 describe how the number of units required for each work practice is estimated
for the various event types. This methodology is the same as that used to estimate work practice costs in
the 2008 LRRP rule analysis (EPA 2008). Appendix 4A in the Economic Analysis of the 2008 LRRP
rule (EPA 2008) presents the resulting estimates for each type of event. The number of units is multiplied
by the per-unit costs, which can be per-each, per-square foot, or per hour, as described above in section
4.3.3.

4.3.5 Baseline Frequency of Prohibited Practice and Costs of Alternatives
Several paint preparation and removal practices are prohibited or restricted in renovations that require
lead-safe work practices under the existing rule. A telephone questionnaire was administered to nine
respondents to gather information on the baseline use of certain paint removal practices. The respondents
included six painting firms and three historic home restoration firms. The six painting firms were
randomly drawn from the online sales lead provider, Salesgenie.com. The historic home restoration firms
were drawn randomly from the Old House Journal’s online restoration directory.
These firms were asked how often they used the following four paint removal techniques on the interior
and exterior of pre-1978 buildings:
1. Open flame burning or torching of paint;
2. Using a heat gun above 1,100º F;
3. Power sanding, grinding, or abrasive blasting except when done with HEPA exhaust control; and
4. Dry scraping of lead based-paint.
If the firms reported that they did not use the method, they were asked why they did not use it and what
alternatives they used instead. They were also asked how much they thought costs would increase if the
specific removal technique was prohibited and if there were any situations where use of the method could
not be avoided. When responding firms could not precisely state what percentage of the time they used a
certain work practice they were prompted with never, rarely, sometimes, often or nearly always. These
prompted answers are assumed to correspond with the following percentages:

Based on these estimates it was estimated that interior and exterior painting jobs use various paint
removal techniques with the frequencies presented in Table 4-29. Since several respondents indicated
that they typically used heat guns at lower temperatures that are allowed under the LRRP rule (under
1100 °F), it was assumed that 20 percent of paint removal was performed with low temperature heat guns.
The remaining 80 percent of paint removal practices were assumed to occur proportionally to the
frequencies in the telephone questionnaire responses so that the sum of the frequencies for the five paint
removal practices equals 100 percent.

4.3.5.1 Estimating the Incremental Costs of Alternatives to Prohibited Work Practices
Power Sanding without attachment to HEPA Vacuum
It is assumed that if power sanding, grinding, or abrasive blasting is prohibited in opt-out housing for
renovations requiring lead-safe work practices under the rule, except when done with HEPA exhaust
control, renovators would use power tools with HEPA exhaust controls.
The costs of requiring that power sanders be attached to vacuums with HEPA filters includes: (1) the cost
of a sander capable of being attached to a HEPA vacuum, and (2) the cost of additional HEPA filters that
will be required because of the increased vacuum use. The cost of a HEPA vacuum is not included as an
incremental cost of this requirement since HEPA vacuum costs are already accounted for in the estimated
costs of complying with the cleaning requirements under the rule.
To estimate the cost of the HEPA vacuum compatible power sanders, quotes for 27 power sanders were
found through online queries; the average cost for such sanders was $209. It is assumed that each sander
can be used for at least 200 jobs. Most power sanders have one-year warranties, thus 200 jobs represents
the minimum lifespan. Therefore, the per-job cost of a new sander is $1.05 [$209/200].
The cost of extra HEPA filters was based on the cost of re-useable HEPA filters. Internet queries found
that re-useable filters cost between $30 and $38 each, with an average price of about $35. It is assumed
that each is good for the life of the sander (200 jobs), resulting in a cost per job of $.18 [$35/200].

Expected Lifespan (#

Per Job Cost
Power Sander $209 200 $1.05
HEPA Filter $35 200 $0.18
Sum of Sander and Filter $1.23
High Temperature Heat Guns and Open Flame Burning or Torching of Paint
It is assumed that if the use of high temperature heat guns (over 1,100 degrees F) and open flame burning
or torching of paint is prohibited for renovations in opt-out housing requiring lead-safe work practices
under the rule, renovators will use low temperature heat guns (under 1,100 degrees F) instead. The cost
of switching to low temperature heat guns is described below for typical interior and exterior painting
events where they may be used.
High Temperature Heat Guns and Open Flame Burning– Interior
An average interior heat gun event was assumed to involve paint removal from 144 sq. ft. of a 10’ x 10’
room. This calculation includes 3” molding around the ceiling, 6” baseboard, 1 doorway, and two 3’ x 5’
windows. It was estimated that this would take 1.05 hours using a high temperature heat gun and 1.36
hours using a low temperature heat gun.20 Thus, switching to a low temperature heat gun would require
20 According to Hunt (2006), a high temperature heat gun can remove the same amount of paint as dry scraping in 64
percent of the time required for dry scraping. It was estimated that dry scraping can be performed at a rate of
35-100 square feet per-hour, or 68 square feet per-hour on average (the rate of 35-100 square feet per-hour is
from Painting and Decorating Contractors of America, 2003). Based on personal communications with industry
sources, low-temperature heat gun paint removal takes 30 percent longer than high-temperature heat gun paint
removal.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-46
an additional 0.31 hours per job. At an hourly rate of $18/hr plus 60% overhead, the additional cost of
using a low temperature heat gun rather than a high temperature heat gun is $8.93 (PDCA 2003).
High Temperature Heat Guns and Open Flame Burning – Exterior
Assuming exterior paint removal from 2 doorways and 10 windows, the average event would include
paint removal from 243 sq. ft. It was estimated that this would take 1.77 hours using a high temperature
heat gun and 2.3 hours using a low temperature heat gun.21 Thus, switching to a low temperature heat
gun would require an additional 0.53 hours per job. At an hourly rate of $18/hr plus 60% overhead, the
incremental cost of using a low temperature heat gun is $15.26 per job. The cost of switching from using
open flame burning or torching of paint to a low temperature heat gun is assumed to be the same as for
switching from a high temperature heat gun to a low temperature heat gun.

An average interior heat gun event was assumed to involve paint removal from 144 sq. ft. of a 10’
x 10’ room. This calculation includes 3” molding around the ceiling, 6” baseboard, 1 doorway,
and two 3’ x 5’ windows. An average exterior heat gun event was assumed to involve paint
removal from 243 sq. ft., involving 2 doorways and 10 windows.
Estimating Average Costs Per Interior Painting and Exterior Painting Job
The sections above described how the average costs per event using a prohibited or restricted practice
were estimated. For cost estimating purposes an average cost across all jobs was estimated– including
those without prohibited practices. Table 4-32 presents these estimates.

*The average additional cost is a weighted average across all interior and exterior painting jobs, including those
where prohibited practices are not used (and additional costs are not incurred).
Interior open flame burning is combined with interior high temperature heat gun jobs (EPA 2008).
Low temperature heat guns are assumed to be the alternative to high temperature heat guns and open flame
burning. The alternative to power sanding not attached to a HEPA vacuum is assumed to be power sanding
attached to a HEPA vacuum.
4.3.6 Frequency and Cost of Vertical Containment for Exterior Events
In certain situations, the renovation firm must take extra precautions in containing the work area for opt-
out housing to ensure that dust and debris from an exterior renovation does not contaminate other
buildings or other areas of the property or migrate to adjacent properties. These situations include work
areas in close proximity to other buildings, work areas that abut a property line, and work in windy
conditions. In some cases, it may be necessary to erect a system of vertical containment to prevent paint
dust and debris from contaminating the ground or any object beyond the work area. Such vertical
containment could take a number of forms such as attaching plastic sheeting to a fence or other support at
the property line, attaching the plastic to a building or a frame attached to the building, or attaching the
plastic to scaffolding erected next to the building.
This section presents the calculations used to determine the total and incremental vertical containment
costs for events occurring along one side of a building or all four sides (referred to as 1 and 4-wall events)
in target housing units. The hanging of disposable reinforced plastic sheeting constitutes the largest
component of the vertical containment costs, so the average height of the buildings must be calculated to
determine the surface area of the sheeting.
Information from the 2005 American Housing Survey (AHS) was used to calculate the average height of
residential housing units. The AHS includes information on the number of stories in the buildings where
housing units are located. The average heights of owner occupied units and renter occupied units are just
under two stories and two-and-a-half stories, respectively.
In order to apply the average number of stories to the cost estimates, separate height estimates are needed
for: single-family owner occupied, single-family rental, and multi-family units. Data from the U.S.
Census Bureau’s American Factfinder was used to determine which average height values from Table 4-
33 to apply to these three categories of residential housing units using information on the percent of units
that are in single-family or multi-family buildings.

As shown in Table 4-34, the majority of owner-occupied housing units are in one-unit buildings. Thus
the average height of owner-occupied housing (2.0 stories) is used to characterize all single-family
housing and the average height of rental housing (2.5 stories) is used to characterize the height of multi-
family housing.

Table 4-36 presents the total and incremental costs of a vertical containment event involving either one or
four walls in the various residential housing units.22 It is assumed that vertical containment is used for 2%
of exterior painting events. To calculate the necessary amount of disposable reinforced plastic sheeting, it
was assumed that the workers would hang the sheeting not on the perimeter of the house but on the
perimeter of the laid polyethylene sheeting. Furthermore, it is assumed that for those jobs using vertical
containment, 50% of the events in residential units will not need scaffolding because they will use plastic
at the fence line or attached to the building, and that 50% of those events that do need scaffolding for
vertical containment are already using it for other reasons, and only incur incremental costs related to
plastic sheeting. Therefore only 25% of the residential units that undertake vertical containment will incur
incremental costs for scaffolding.
22 The analysis only considered one and four wall exterior events to capture the range of containment that might be required for
exterior painting events. Two or three wall events are also possible and would result in containment costs between those
estimated for the one and four wall events.

a. The scaffolding costs take into account the assumption that only 25% of residential housing units with vertical containment will need
incur incremental costs for scaffolding. It is assumed that the scaffolding is needed for one day per wall.
b. Based on a web search, which showed that reinforced plastic sheeting costs $.07 per square foot.
c. Based on a web search, which showed that duct tape costs $0.02 per square foot and 6 mil. polyethylene sheeting costs $0.06 per
square foot.
d. This includes both material and labor costs.
e. The average presented is the average across all exterior painting jobs, including the 98% of exterior painting jobs where vertical
containment is not assumed to be used.
Table 4-36 shows that the costs range in value from just over $760 for a one wall event in a single-family
renter occupied unit, to just under $6,250 for a four wall event in a multi-family housing unit. On average,
59% of the total cost is due to the labor involved with erecting and dismantling the scaffolding.
4.3.7 Baseline Work Practices
Some of the containment and cleaning practice standards specified by EPA under the rule are currently in
use by certain renovation contractors. The costs of work practices already in use are not incremental costs
of the rule and are subtracted out of the cost estimates. In order to determine how often the required work
practices are used in the absence of regulation, a telephone questionnaire was administered to 9
contractors in 2007 to collect information on baseline industry practices. A series of questions were
asked to determine if the listed work practices were currently in use and if they were, the frequency with
which they occur.
The questionnaire’s objective was to collect responses to two sets of questions. One set of questions dealt
with current interior RRP work practices. The other dealt with exterior work practices. The list of
contractors to contact was generated from Salesgenie.com, an online service that contains contact
information for over 14 million U.S. businesses. The service permitted companies to be selected based on
their SIC Codes. The universe of potential respondents was generated by randomly selecting businesses
with the following SIC Codes: 172101 (Painting Contractors), 1521 (General Contractors - Single-Family
Houses), and 1522 (General Contractors - Residential Buildings Other Than Single-Family). The
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-51
responding companies were comprised of four painting firms and five general contracting firms. All nine
of the painting and general contracting firms answered both the interior and exterior surveys. The
instrument used to administer the questionnaire is presented below (Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2).

(1) How often do you post signs warning residents to remain outside the work area?
(2) While the work is being performed, how often do you keep all windows and doors
within 20 feet of the work area closed, or covered with sheeting?
(3) How often do you cover the ground with sheeting in order to collect falling paint
debris?
Table 4-37 presents the individual results of the surveys as well as overall statistics for across the surveys.
The data are broken down by firm type (painting or general contracting), and survey type (interior or

Notes: When respondents gave a range of values for the percent of time they used a certain work practice, the midpoint of
the range was used in calculating the average. When the respondent was unable to give a response, a question mark is
presented and the value is excluded from the calculation.
Table 4-38 describes how the incremental cost adjustment is estimated to account for the use of required
work practices in the baseline. These calculations are based on the questionnaire responses and adjusted
to account for the assumption in this analysis that there will be 75 percent compliance with the rule. For
example, based on the average questionnaire response, signs are posted 34 percent of the time. Since it is
assumed that signs will be posted 75 percent of the time after the rule, 45 percent (45% = 34%/75%) of
the post-rule sign-posting costs are already incurred in the baseline. Thus, since it is estimated that
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-53
posting a sign costs $0.11 per-event, the incremental impact of the rule’s sign posting requirement is
$0.07 ($0.11 * (1-45%)) after adjusting for baseline sign posting

4.3.8 Summary of Incremental Work Practice Costs Per Event in Target Housing
Table 4-39 summarizes the incremental work practice costs associated with containment, cleaning, and
verification in target housing. The methodology behind these estimates is described in the preceding
sections and more detailed data is presented in Appendix 4A of the Economic Analysis of the 2008 LRRP
rule (EPA 2008). Table 4-40 shows the average expected costs per-compliant event, accounting for the
relative number of small and large events. These are average expected costs so some individual events
will be above the average and some will be below it.

Notes: The sum of the containment, cleaning and verification costs may not equal the total per-event cost due
to rounding. The costs associated with using prohibited practice alternatives are only included in the Total

4.3.9 Total Work Practice Costs Resulting from Removing Opt-Out Provisions
Table 4-40 through Table 4-43 present the total work practice costs associated with target housing
regulated under the revised rule (i.e., owner occupied housing that may no longer opt out of the LRRP
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-56
program requirements) for the first and second years after the revisions rule goes into effect. For
individual options the costs vary between the first and the second year for two primary reasons: (1) for
some options, the scope of the regulated universe expands between the first and the second year, and (2)
the improved test kits are assumed to become available by January 2011, which is the second year of the
rule for Options A through C. Increasing the scope of the regulated universe tends to increase costs and
the availability of the improved test kits tends to decrease the costs (since improved test kits will lower
the number of instances where LSWP costs are incurred when lead-based paint is not disturbed). After
the second year, estimated work practice costs decline proportionally to the assumed decline in the stock
of regulated buildings (a 0.41 percent decline per year). Note that the removal of the opt-out provision
would not begin until the second year under Option C.

4.4 Estimating the Number of Firms and Personnel Obtaining Training and
Certification to Meet the Demand for Lead-Safe RRP Services
The rule requires all entities that conduct RRP activities for compensation in regulated structures to
become certified under the rule. This analysis refers to these certified entities as firms. The regulations
also require firms to ensure that all persons performing renovation activities on behalf of the firm are
either certified renovators that have received formal training or have received informal training from a
certified renovator. Hereafter, “renovator” refers to an individual who has successfully completed a
renovator course accredited by EPA or an EPA-authorized State or Tribal program, and “worker” refers to
an individual who has received on-the-job training in the work practices from a certified renovator. It is
expected that two types of construction businesses will perform regulated RRP work – businesses with
employees and non-employer, or self-employed, contractors. In addition, rental companies are likely to
perform some of the RRP work on the properties they manage rather than hire an outside contractor.
Likewise, schools and daycare centers are likely to perform some or all of their RRP work with their own
staff. The regulation requires that a certified renovator be physically present when warning signs are
being posted, the work site is being contained, and when the post-renovation cleaning is being done. The
certified renovator must be available, either on-site or by telephone, at all other times when regulated
renovation activities are being performed. In addition, only a certified renovator may perform the
cleaning verification step required by the rule. As such, each certified firm with employees will need to

have at least one certified renovator on staff. All self-employed contractors performing regulated RRP
work will need to be trained as renovators and upon satisfying the training requirements, will need to be
certified as firms.
4.4.1 Residential Activities: Estimating the Number of Firms and Personnel Obtaining
Training and Certification to Meet the Demand for Lead-Safe RRP Services
This section describes how the analysis estimates the number of (1) firms obtaining certification, (2)
renovators obtaining formal training, and (3) workers obtaining informal on-the-job training in order to
meet the demand for lead-safe RRP services in residential settings. The general approach was to obtain
Census estimates of the total number of establishments and employees in affected industries and adjust
these estimates to account for the fact that not all work performed in these industries is affected by the
rule. Note that Census data are only available for establishments and not firms, and these data are used as
the basis for estimating the number of firms that will obtain certification. The total numbers of
establishments and employees are adjusted in two ways: (1) according to the share of their revenues that
come from residential work, and (2) to reflect the share of the housing stock that is affected by the LRRP
revisions rule. 23 These adjustments imply that there will be some degree of specialization in regulated
work. They do not, however, imply full specialization in regulated work. In addition, the adjustments do
not fully reflect the share of RRP work that does not disturb any painted surfaces, or the disproportionate
amount of residential work that is related to new construction. Adjusting for these two factors would
result in a lower estimate of the number of affected firms and personnel.
4.4.1.1 Estimating the Stock of Certified Firms Necessary to Meet Demand for Residential RRP
The numbers of firms seeking certification under the rule are estimated in three segments: (1) residential
construction establishments with employees, (2) non-employer residential construction establishments
(i.e., self-employed contractors), and (3) Residential Property Managers and Lessors. Residential
Property Managers and Lessors would not be affected by the removal of the opt-out provision (because
rental units were not eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008 LRRP rule) but they would be
affected by the additional recordkeeping checklist requirement.
23 With respect to the second adjustment, it implies that by expanding the scope of the LRRP program (by removing the opt-out
provisions), the LRRP revisions will proportionately increase the number of certified firms and trained renovators and
workers, and thus the total training and certification costs for residential contractors. To the extent that firms are less
specialized than assumed here, more renovators and firms than originally predicted may become trained and renovated as a
result of the 2008 LRRP rule. In that case, the incremental training and certification cost of the LRRP revisions rule may be
less than this analysis estimates.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-61
Estimating the Number of Residential Construction Establishments with Employees
The LRRP revisions rule requires firms that conduct RRP activities in housing previously eligible for the
opt-out provision to become certified under the LRRP program rule. Because the majority of firms
involved in construction work are likely to be small, single establishment businesses, this analysis
assumes that firms will seek certification at the establishment level. As demonstrated in Chapter 2, the
eleven potentially affected construction sectors (Residential Remodelers and ten specialty contractor
sectors: Plumbing and HVAC, Tile and Terrazzo, Painting and Wall Covering, Finish Carpentry, Glass
and Glazing, Drywall and Insulation, Siding, Other Building Equipment, Other Building Finishing, and
Electrical contractors) include over 357,000 establishments with employees. Because these
establishments are involved in a variety of construction and non-construction activities, in all likelihood
only some of them will seek certification under the LRRP program rule. For example, only 54 percent of
Residential Remodeling establishments specialize in residential work (i.e. derive at least 51 percent of
their revenues from residential work). In addition, only 56 percent of the revenues of Residential
Remodelers come from residential RRP activities. Establishments may choose to incur the cost of
certification and of training their employees only if they derive a substantial portion of their revenues
from residential Renovation, Repair, and Painting in housing affected by the regulations. Businesses that
derive the majority of their revenues from new construction or from RRP activities in non-target housing
may decide not to invest in certification.
Unfortunately, the U.S. Economic Census does not provide data on the number of establishments that
specialize in residential RRP. The number of establishments estimated to specialize in residential RRP
was estimated by multiplying the total number of establishments by each industry sector’s ratio of RRP
residential revenues to total construction revenues (See Table 4-44).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-62
Estimating the Number of Non-Employer Residential Construction Firms
The number of self-employed (non-employer) firms in each of the eleven affected industry sectors is
presented in Table 4-45. It was assumed that these firms will specialize in residential work with the same
frequency as employer establishments in the same industry. In other words, to estimate the number of
self-employed contractors specializing in residential work, the estimated number of non-employer
establishments in each industry was multiplied by that industry’s ratio of residential RRP revenues to total
construction revenues (see Table 4-45).

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-63
Estimating the Number of Property Managers and Lessors that Perform Residential RRP
Instead of hiring an outside contractor for RRP work on properties under their management, Residential
Property Managers (NAICS 531311) and Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings (NAICS
531110) may choose to do the renovation work with their own staff. Since all firms performing RRP
work in regulated housing must be certified, establishments that choose to perform their own RRP work
will seek certifications under the regulations. The estimated numbers of these establishments are
presented in Table 4-46. Note that rental units and therefore Residential Property Managers and Lessors
of Residential Buildings and Dwellings are not affected by the opt-out provision, but would be subject to
the additional recordkeeping checklist requirement.
The U.S. Economic Census does not present any data on the amount of RRP work performed by
Residential Property Managers on their own properties. Due to this lack of data, this analysis assumes
that all Residential Property Management and Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings
establishments that have paid employees and manage housing regulated by the rule will seek certification
and train their employees as certified renovators or workers. Although this assumption is likely to
overestimate the number of establishments and personnel seeking certification and training, it is not
unreasonable since performing minor renovation or maintenance work in-house is often less expensive
than hiring an outside contractor. The vast majority of establishments that manage regulated housing may

thus find certification worthwhile. Note that only establishments with employees are expected to seek
certification; non-employers are unlikely to have the time or manpower to perform renovations
themselves and are more likely to hire an outside contractor for work that disturbs more than 6 square feet
per room of a painted surface for interior renovations or 20 square feet for exterior renovations.

Summary of the Additional Number of Establishments Needed to Perform Residential RRP After
the Removal of the Opt-Out Provision
Table 4-47 presents a summary of the estimated number of establishments specializing in residential
RRP. The estimated number of residential RRP establishments was further reduced to account for the fact
that only some of these entities will perform RRP work in target housing. The latter adjustment was
made based on data obtained from the American Housing Survey that 65 percent of U.S. households
reside in target housing.

The estimate that 373,968 firms perform residential RRP in pre-1978 housing represents the total stock of
firms that would be required to meet the potential demand for RRP using LSWP in all target housing. To
estimate the stock of certified firms under the various options, 373,968 is adjusted by 75 percent to
account for the 75 percent rate of compliance assumed in this analysis. In addition, the compliance-
adjusted estimate is adjusted to reflect the scope of each regulatory option, based on the percentage of all
target housing RRP events regulated under each option. The removal of the opt-out provision from the
final LRRP rule would affect entities performing RRP work in owner-occupied target housing units that
are not COFs and where no child under the age of six or a pregnant woman resides. The estimated stock

Estimating the Stock of Trained Construction Workers Necessary to Meet Demand for Residential
RRP
The rule requires certified firms to ensure that renovation activities covered by the rule are performed by
certified renovators, or by renovation workers who receive on-the-job training in the work practices from
a certified renovator. The regulation requires that a certified renovator be physically present when
warning signs are being posted, the work site is being contained, and during post-renovation cleaning.
The certified renovator must be available, either on-site or by telephone, at all other times when regulated
renovation activities are being performed. In addition, only a certified renovator may perform the
cleaning verification step required by the rule. As such, each certified establishment with employees will
need to have at least one certified renovator on staff. All self-employed contractors performing regulated
RRP work will need to be trained as renovators and upon satisfying the training requirements, will need
to be certified as firms.
Estimating the Number of Residential Construction Employees (excluding self-employed)
To estimate the number of construction employees that will train to become certified renovators, this
analysis looked at the average number of construction employees in establishments performing residential
RRP jobs. The average employment size was calculated by dividing the number of construction
employees seeking training by the number of establishments certified in each industry (See Table 4-49).
This analysis also assumed that establishments will employ one certified renovator per every five
construction employees. In other words, establishments that have one to five construction workers on
staff will employ one renovator, establishments with more than five and fewer than 10 construction
workers on staff will employ two renovators, and those with 10 or more construction workers on staff will
employ three renovators. The average number of construction workers per establishment was no higher
than 15 in any affected sector.
To estimate the number of construction employees that would be trained as renovators, the estimated
number of establishments seeking certification in each sector was multiplied by the expected number of
renovators per establishment for that sector (see Table 4-49 and Table 4-50). Four of the affected sectors
(Other Building Equipment Contractors, Other Building Finishing Contractors, Electrical Contractors and
Drywall and Insulation Contractors) had, on average, between 10 and 15 construction employees per
establishment and were assumed to have three renovators on staff each. The number of construction
employees in each sector that will need to receive worker training was estimated by subtracting the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-66
number of people receiving renovator certification from the total number of people seeking training (see
Table 4-50).
The number of employee establishment personnel expected to seek training as either certified renovators
or workers was estimated by applying the same approach used for the estimation of the number of
establishments that will seek certification under the regulations (note: employee establishment personnel
does not include the self-employed). It was assumed that the number of people who perform RRP work in
each of the affected industries is proportional to the ratio of residential RRP revenues to the total
construction revenues in that sector. In other words, it was assumed that since 28 percent of construction
revenues in the Tile and Terrazzo contractor industry come from residential RRP, then 28 percent of the
construction employees perform residential RRP work. The number of employees estimated to specialize
in residential RRP was estimated by multiplying the total number of employees by each industry sector’s
ratio of RRP residential revenues to total construction revenues (See Table 4-50).

the fact that Residential Property Manager establishments are involved in a variety of non-construction
activities; it is thus unlikely that these businesses will have more than one ten-person construction crew
on staff. Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings establishments employ about five people on

4.4.1.2 Estimating the Increase in the Number of Firms and Personnel Seeking Certification and
Training Each Year After the Removal of the Opt-Out Provision
The number of renovators and firms that seek training and certification in the first few years is estimated
slightly differently for the option with a phase-in period (Option D) as it is for those that do not phase-in
regulated structures in the second year (Options A and C). Further, Option B, which would implement
the revised rule midway through the first year, is calculated similarly to an option with a phase-in period.
The methodology employed to estimate the stock of renovators and firms required to meet the demand for
lead-safe RRP services is described above and the results are summarized in Table 4-48. The number of
firms and individuals seeking training and certification in any given year is estimated from the stock of
firms and individuals necessary to meet demand for lead-safe RRP services. (Because training and
certification are valid for five years, the annual number trained and certified each year after the first year
is a fraction of the total stock of trained individuals and certified firms.) The differences in the number of
renovators and firms seeking training and certification across the options are proportional to the number
of RRP events regulated by each option..
Note that many of the additional firms and renovators that expected to become certified and trained
because of the removal of the opt-out provision are likely to seek certification and training before the
removal of the opt-out provision goes into effect. (So, for example, under Option C, it is unlikely that
there would actually be zero firms certified or renovators trained in the first year after promulgation of the
rule.) However, this analysis utilizes the simplifying assumption that any additional initial certification
and training takes place over a 12 month period starting from the date of the expansion of the regulated
universe.
Options Without Phase-In (Options A and C)
In the first year, it is assumed that the increase in the number of renovators and firms that seek initial
training and certification is equal to the number that is necessary to meet the increase in demand for lead-
safe RRP services in that first year. Thus, under options A and C, the number of initial trainings and
certifications in the year the opt-out provision is removed is equal to the stock of renovators and firms
required to meet the increase in demand for lead-safe RRP services associated with all owner-occupied
target housing units where no child under age six or pregnant woman resides. After the first year, it is
assumed that one-fifth of the necessary stock of individuals and firms will obtain training and certification
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-69
each year (since refresher-training and re-certification is required every five years). In addition, the
number of individuals trained is assumed to decline by 0.41 percent annually to account for the decline in
the size of the pre-1978 housing stock over time, and thus the decline in demand for lead-safe renovation
services. The entire stock of workers is assumed to receive informal training each year.
Options With Phase-In (Option D):
In the first year, it is assumed that the increase in the number of renovators and firms that seek initial
training and certification is equal to the number that is necessary to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP
services in that first year. Under Option D, the number of initial trainings and certifications in the first
year is equal to the stock of renovators and firms required to meet the increase in demand for lead-safe
RRP services associated with all owner-occupied pre-1960 housing units where no child under age six or
pregnant woman resides. In the second year, this analysis makes the simplifying assumption that one-fifth
of the number who were trained and certified in the first year will seek initial- or re-certification (adjusted
by 0.41 percent annually to reflect the decline in the stock of pre-1978 buildings), and that the stock of
individuals and firms required to meet the additional demand in the newly regulated 1960 to 1978
structures will obtain initial training and certification. In later years, it is assumed that one-fifth of the
necessary stock of individuals and firms will obtain training and certification each year (since refresher-
training and re-certification is required every five years). The entire stock of workers is assumed to
receive informal training each year.
Options With Partial-Year Implementation (Option B):
In the first year, it is assumed that the increase in the number of renovators and firms that seek initial
training and certification is equal to the number that is necessary to meet the increased demand for lead-
safe RRP services in that first year. Under Option B, the rule does not become effective until halfway
through the first year. Thus, under Option B, the stock of renovators and firms seeking initial training and
certification in the first year is half as large as that required to meet the increase in demand for lead-safe
RRP services in all pre-1978 structures during a full year. In the second year, this analysis makes the
simplifying assumption that one-fifth of the number who were trained and certified in the first year will
seek initial- or re-certification (adjusted by 0.41 percent annually to reflect the decline in the stock of pre-
1978 buildings). In addition, the stock of individuals and firms required to meet the additional demand
for a full year’s renovations (rather than the six months in the first year) will obtain initial training and
certification. In later years, it is assumed that one-fifth of the necessary stock of individuals and firms
will obtain training and certification each year (since refresher-training and re-certification is required
every five years). The entire stock of workers is assumed to receive informal training each year.
Training and Certification after the Initial Years
As indicated above, this analysis assumes a steady annual number of firm and individual certifications
after the second year of regulation with an annual decline of 0.41 percent. If all the individuals and firms
needed to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP were trained and certified in the first and second years, one
might expect a drop in the level of training and certification in the third year, followed by a spike in the
next year. That is, one might expect a cyclical pattern of training and certification to emerge. However,
it is difficult to predict how cyclical the training and certification demand might be or how this cyclicality
might diminish over time. Therefore, this analysis assumes that a typical amount of training and
certification occurs each year after the first two years. Modeling a cyclical component would add little to
the analysis without being able to estimate the extent of any cyclicality more precisely.
The analysis does account for certified firms and trained individuals that exit the industry each year and
are replaced by new entrants. This analysis accounts for turnover in the regulated RRP industry by
assuming a certain percentage of certifications each year are initial certifications. Specifically, after the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-70
first year, 52 percent of the renovators seeking training and certification are assumed to be seeking their
initial certification. This percentage is based on the relative number of Abatement Supervisors applying
for initial certifications according to the Federal Lead-Based Paint Program (FLPP) database (EPA 2005).
Similarly, 54 percent of firms seeking certification are assumed to be seeking their initial certification
based on the relative frequency of initial certifications observed for abatement firms in the FLPP
database.
Summary of Number of Individuals Trained to Perform Residential RRP using LSWP
Table 4-52 presents a summary of the estimated number of construction renovators and workers
specializing in residential RRP. The estimated number of residential RRP renovators and workers was
further reduced to account for the fact that only some of these individuals will perform RRP work in
target housing. The latter adjustment was made based on data obtained from the American Housing
Survey that 65 percent of U.S. households reside in target housing.

The estimated number of renovators and workers that perform residential RRP in pre-1978 housing,
426,038 and 636,787, respectively, represents the estimated stock of renovators and workers that would
be required to meet the demand for RRP in target housing (This includes renovations covered by the 2008
LRRP rule as well as the LRRP revisions rule). To estimate the stock of trained individuals under the
various options, these estimates are adjusted by 75 percent to account for the 75 percent rate of
compliance assumed in this analysis. In addition, the compliance-adjusted estimate is further adjusted to
reflect the scope of each regulatory option based on the percentage of all target housing RRP events
regulated under each option. For example, the increase in the stock of trained renovators under Option A
(126,940) is estimated by multiplying the estimated stock of renovators that would be required to meet the
demand for RRP in all target housing (426,038) by the compliance rate (75 percent) and the percentage of
target housing RRP events regulated under Option A (35 percent). The removal of the opt-out provision
from the 2008 LRRP rule would require that RRP is performed by trained renovators and workers in
owner-occupied target housing units that are not COFs and where no child under the age of six or a
pregnant woman resides. The estimated increase in the stock of renovators and workers that would be

Note: Components may not add up to totals due to rounding. The number of firms and individuals certified and
trained, respectively, are assumed to decline by 0.41 percent annually to account for the decline in the size of the
regulated housing stock over time, and thus the demand for lead-safe renovation services. This table presents the
numbers of renovators and firms seeking training and certification in a given year; therefore the numbers in years 2 and
3 differ from those presented in Table 4-48, which presents the stock of trained renovators and certified firms. Because
training and certification are valid for five years, the stock of certified firms and trained individuals exceeds the annual
number trained and certified each year after Year 1. Workers receive training each year.
See Table 4-1 for options descriptions.

4.5 Training Costs
Training costs include the cost of the time spent on training activities as well as the associated travel and
tuition costs. Note that tuition costs are assumed to include the costs associated with training provider
accreditation. In other words, it is assumed that accredited training providers pass along their
accreditation fees and other administrative costs through their tuition. These accreditation fees and other
administrative costs are estimated in the paperwork burden analysis but are only implicitly accounted for
(as part of tuition costs) in the estimates of the total cost of the rule.
4.5.1 Training Burden Per Individual
To estimate the incremental burden of training, several cost components are calculated, including tuition
rates, wage rates, and travel and expense costs. Each certified renovator will participate in 8 hours of
formal initial training. Refresher renovator certification training is required every five years; the refresher
course is only four hours. Workers receive informal, on-the-job training; it is assumed that, on average,
three workers are trained at a time by a certified renovator and the training requires one hour.
Tuition for the initial certified renovator training class is estimated to be $186; the corresponding
refresher course tuition is estimated to be $93 (EPA 2006). This estimate relies on the assumption that
the average hourly tuition is equal to the observed rates for the accredited lead abatement and evaluation
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-73
courses ($23.26/hr).24 Additional travel and meal costs associated with training are assumed to be $121
(EPA 2006).25 Digital photos of each certified renovator are also added into the additional costs. The
total cost for a one-time use digital camera that takes 25 pictures is $14 ($0.56 per picture taken). The
total time allotted to taking and processing these photos is estimated at 3 minutes ($1.20). A total cost of
$1.76 (rounded to $2 in the total cost estimates) is therefore estimated. For a class size of 10 students, 3
minutes per student is equivalent to a total time of 30 minutes to take the digital photos, associate them
with the appropriate students, and insert the photos onto the training certificates.
The value of the time for certified renovators to receive formal initial training is $253 (8 hours at a loaded
wage rate of $31.64/hour); the refresher training is half this amount, or $127 (EPA 2006). Certified
renovators may be self-employed or might be employed by a larger company. Therefore, the value of
time is likely to represent a mix of lost wages and additional overhead to firms. Assuming one certified
renovator trains three workers at a time and this informal training requires an hour, informal training is
estimated to cost $27 per worker trained, based on the renovator wage rate and an average loaded wage
rate for workers of $16.94/hour (EPA 2006). Thus, as shown in Table 4-55, the aggregated incremental
cost of training is $560 for initial certified renovator training, $341 for refresher certified renovator
training and $27 for informal worker training (EPA 2006).

4.5.2 Total Training Costs
Table 4-56 through Table 4-58 present the total training costs of the rule for the first three years. The
number of renovators and workers seeking training is described in Section 4.4.1.2, the value of training
time for renovators and workers is described in Section 4.5.1. The average training cost per renovator
varies in the initial years of the regulation according to the relative number of initial and refresher
trainings. After the second year, 52 percent of contractors and public or commercial building renovators
receive initial training (due to turnover in the industry) and the rest obtain refresher training. Note that an
individual who received initial training and let their certification expire must retake the initial training.
The stock of regulated structures declines by 0.41 percent annually which also reduces the demand for
lead-safe renovation services, and thus the number of renovators and workers seeking training and the
undiscounted total training costs.
24 The average of the hourly tuition rates are used rather than picking a single similar course because no single
course is similar enough to the renovator course. For example, the initial courses are the only courses with
hands-on training, but they are also longer than the renovator course. The refresher courses are more similar in
length, but have no hands on requirements.
25 Travel costs include 2 hours of travel time ($63), meals ($9), and mileage costs (50 miles, $49).

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-75
4.6 Certification Costs: Firm Paperwork Burden and EPA Administrative and
Enforcement Costs
Under this rule, states are given the option of administering the regulations as long as the state
implementation plan is approved by EPA. EPA will directly administer programs in states that do not
have an approved implementation plan. This section of the analysis estimates costs that EPA expects to
incur while administrating and enforcing the LRRP rule under the assumption that EPA administers the
program everywhere. States that choose to implement the rule themselves are expected to incur similar
costs in lieu of EPA. Firm paperwork costs associated with certification are also presented in this section.
EPA will perform three tasks as part of administering the LRRP rule: accrediting training providers,
certifying firms, and processing training provider notifications. In addition to administrative costs, EPA
will also incur costs to enforce the LRRP rule. To reduce the burden on the regulated community, EPA
has decided not to require formal certification for renovators and workers.
In the economic analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule, EPA estimated enforcement costs independently from
firm certification costs. However, for this analysis, EPA adopted firm certification fees set forth in a
separate rulemaking. Under this fee schedule, enforcement costs are assumed to be variable and captured
by the certification fees paid by firms.
Accreditation/certification cost estimates are based on the 2009 rule that set fees for accreditation of
training programs and certification of lead-based paint activities and renovation contractors (EPA 2009).
This analysis utilizes the $300 per firm fees set for initial certification and re-certification. Note that there
are also administrative and enforcement costs related to accrediting training providers but these costs are
also assumed to be recovered through tuition charges and are therefore accounted for through the tuition
costs.
4.6.1 Administrative and Enforcement Costs: Contribution to Total Costs
The fees that firms and training providers pay to become certified and accredited, respectively, are
designed to recover EPA’s administrative and enforcement costs. These fees were set in a separate
rulemaking (74 Federal Register 11863, March 20, 2009, codified at 40 CFR '745.92). Simply adding
these costs to the other cost components, however, will result in some double counting. This analysis
assumes that training providers will recover their accreditation fees (which in turn cover EPA’s
administrative and enforcement costs of training provider accreditation) through the tuition they charge to
renovators. Those costs have already been accounted for in Section 4.5 Thus, the additional social cost
of EPA’s administrative and enforcement activities can be calculated based on the fees firms pay to
become certified. The EPA costs that will be recovered from RRP firms in a given year are calculated as
follows:
4.6.2 Firm Paperwork Burden
It is estimated that firms will spend a total of three hours to familiarize themselves with the LRRP rule’s
requirements and a half an hour to fill out and mail the one-page application for renovator certification.
In addition, each year time is spent keeping records that demonstrate compliance with the LRRP training
and work-practice requirements. Additional costs are minor and include: one application printout, one
photocopy for personal records, an envelope, and a stamp. As shown in Table 4-60, it is estimated that

4.6.3 Total Certification Costs: Increase in Firm Paperwork and EPA Administrative and
Enforcement Costs Associated with the Removal of the Opt-Out Provision
Table 4-60 shows the total certification costs for the LRRP rule revision in the first year. Table 4-61 and
Table 4-62 show the total certification costs by initial certification firms, refresher certification firms, and
firms not seeking certification for the LRRP rule revision in the second and third years, respectively. The
certification costs decline by 0.41 percent each year after the third year, accounting for the expected
decline in regulated universe as older housing units are replaced with newer structures. Total costs per-
firm are the sum of EPA’s administrative costs per firm and the firm’s costs for paperwork and
recordkeeping. This cost per firm is multiplied by the additional number of establishments estimated to
provide lead-safe RRP services as a result of the removal of the opt-out provision (see Section 4.4.1.1).
In the first year, all the firms listed in the number of establishments’ column in Table 4-60 are presumed
to seek initial certification, paying their share of EPA’s administrative and enforcement costs ($300 per
firm, see Section 4.6.1). In addition, they incur a cost for paperwork and recordkeeping. The tables
reflect only those additional firms that are expected to become certified as a result of the removal of the
opt-out provision.

estimated based on the costs presented in Table 4-61 and Table 4-62 and the relative number of firms
seeking initial-certification, re-certification, and not seeking certification. Section 4.4.1.1 describes and
presents these estimates. The increase in the number of establishments is shown for firms seeking initial
certification, recertification, and not seeking certification.

4.7 Recordkeeping Checklist Provision Costs
4.7.1 Recordkeeping Checklist Provision Requirements
The proposed revision to the 2008 LRRP rule would require all renovation firms to provide a copy of the
records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the RRP rule to the
owner and, if different, the occupant of the building being renovated or the operator of the child-occupied
facility. Renovation firms would have to provide this information to owners and occupants when the final
invoice for the renovation is delivered, or within thirty days of the completion of work, whichever is
earlier. It is expected that renovators will furnish this information by providing a copy of the short
checklist or other form that is used for compliance purposes, and thus it is referred to here as a checklist.
If dust clearance is performed in lieu of cleaning verification, the renovation firm must also provide a
copy of the dust wipe sampling report(s). For renovations occurring in common areas of target housing or
child-occupied facilities, the renovation firm can post instructions to tenants on how to obtain the
information.
The checklist or form must include documentation that a certified renovator was assigned to the project,
that the certified renovator provided on-the-job training for workers used on the project, that the certified
renovator performed or directed workers who performed the tasks required by this final rule, and that the
certified renovator performed the post-renovation cleaning verification. It must also include the
identifying information on the manufacturer and model of the test kits used, if any; a description of the
components that were tested including their locations; and the test kit results. This documentation must
include a certification by the certified renovator that the work practices were followed with descriptions
as applicable (see Figure 4-3 for a sample recordkeeping checklist).

4.7.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Unit Costs
4.7.2.1 Labor Costs
Under the requirements of the 2008 LRRP rule, renovation firms must complete and retain a copy of the
information described above for enforcement purposes. Therefore, the LRRP revisions rule would only
result in renovation firms incurring the incremental labor costs of photocopying and distributing the
checklist to the owners and/or occupants. The burden will be minimal, since the renovator will typically
be delivering the checklist along with an invoice or other job-relate paperwork. EPA assumed that
photocopying and distributing the checklist would take an average of three minutes of a renovator’s time
at a loaded wage rate of $31.64 per hour, for an average cost of $1.58.
4.7.2.2 Material Costs
The checklist provision requires renovation firms to supply a copy of the checklist to the owner of the
affected building, or if different, the occupant of the affected target housing unit or operator of the child-
occupied facility, and to post the checklist in a common area. Therefore, renovation firms performing
work in target housing or public or commercial buildings would incur an incremental cost of photocopy
materials.
Table 4-63 shows the estimated average costs per event of the checklist provision requirements.
4.7.3 Number of Events Affected by the Checklist Provision
The recordkeeping checklist provision would apply to both firms affected by the 2008 LRRP rule and to
firms that would be covered by the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision. Under Option A, the
entire stock of firms necessary to meet demand, including those working in target housing, and public or
commercial building COFs, would incur checklist costs in the first year. However, under Options B and
C, which have delayed implementation, and Option D, which has a phase-in period, only some of the
incremental stock of firms ultimately affected by the removal of the opt-out provision would incur costs
in the first year. That is, there would be no delay in providing the checklist for events covered by the
2008 LRRP rule; for options with a delayed effective date or phase-in, the checklist provision requirement
would take effect at the same time as the LRRP work practice requirements. From the second year
onward, the entire stock of firms would incur checklist provision costs.
As mentioned above, firms performing work in owner-occupied target housing would be required to
distribute one copy of the checklist while firms performing work in renter-occupied target housing would
be required to provide a copy to the owner and occupant. If the work occurs in the common area of an

apartment building, the checklist, or information on how to obtain the checklist, can be posted on a sign in
the common area.
The checklist provision also applies to firms performing work in public or commercial building COFs.
Child-occupied facilities that perform work themselves must post the checklist, or information on how to
obtain the checklist, on a sign that is accessible to parents or guardians of the children. Similarly,
landlords that perform work would have to supply one copy of the checklist attached to a sign in the area
where the work is being performed. Contractors who perform work in owner-occupied COFs must
provide two copies of the checklist: one copy to the owner of the COF and one copy to be posted on a
sign in the COF. In addition to the two copies required in owner-occupied events, contractors working in
renter-occupied COFs must also provide the operator of the COF with a third copy of the checklist.

4.7.4 Total Costs of the Recordkeeping Checklist Provision
Table 4-65 presents the total costs imposed on firms as a result of the recordkeeping checklist provision in
the first and second years of the rule’s implementation under each option with the costs that would be
incurred without the elimination of the opt-out provision (costs of events regulated under the 2008 LRRP
rule). EPA estimated total costs by multiplying unit costs in Table 4-63 with the corresponding number
of events in Table 4-64.
4.8 Total Costs
This section presents the total costs of the revisions to the LRRP program. Total costs are estimated for
the first, second, and third years of regulation. Total 50-year costs and 50-year annualized costs are also
calculated. Out year costs are estimated using discount rates of both 3 and 7 percent.
4.8.1 Total Costs in the First Year of Regulation
Table 4-66 presents the total first year costs associated with the LRRP rule. Total containment, cleaning,
and verification costs are calculated by adding the cost of testing using the LBP test kits to the costs of
containment, cleaning, and verification. The total costs of containment, cleaning, and verification are
calculated by multiplying the number of events requiring work practices (Section 4.2) by the
corresponding incremental unit costs (Section 4.3). The total cost of conducting LBP tests using test kits

is removed, including the checklist cost for the 2008 LRRP Rule Events. The cost for events affected by the opt-
out removal can be calculated by subtracting the cost for the 2008 LRRP Rule Events from the cost for each

is estimated as the number of events (Section 4.2) multiplied by the cost of conducting the test (see
Section 4.3.1). Total training costs are calculated by multiplying the number of trained individuals
(Section 4.4) by the corresponding incremental training costs (Section 4.5.1). Total certification costs are
calculated by multiplying the number of firms (Section 4.4) by the corresponding incremental firm costs
(Section 4.6). The recordkeeping checklist provision costs are calculated by multiplying the number of
events where a recordkeeping checklist must be provided (Section 4.7.3) by the corresponding unit cost of
providing the recordkeeping checklist (Section 4.7.2).
The total costs are higher in the first year for the options that regulate more RRP events. First year costs
are highest under Option A ($507 million), which fully eliminates the opt-out provision immediately.
First year costs are second highest under Option D ($291 million), which fully eliminates the opt-out
provision for pre-1960 housing as soon as the rule is implemented. The costs under Option B ($263
million), which fully eliminates the opt-out provision midway through the first year, are slightly lower
compared to Option D. Option C first year total costs ($20 million) only include recordkeeping checklist
provision costs for events covered by the 2008 LRRP rule in the first year.

4.8.2 Total Costs in the Second and Third Years of Regulation
Table 4-67 and Table 4-68 show that total costs differ across options in the second year but are the same
across all options by the third year. Despite the second year expansion of the number of regulated events
under Option D, the total work practice costs are only slightly higher than in the first year. This modest
increase results from the improved effectiveness of the test kit (decrease in false positive rate of 63
percent to 10 percent), which offsets a portion of the cost increase associated with the larger universe of
regulated events.
In the second year, the training and certification costs are highest under Option C and are relatively higher
under Option B and Option D compared to Option A. This ranking reflects the delayed start-up costs
associated with training and certifying the additional individuals and firms needed to meet the demand
increase that corresponds to the expansion in the regulated universe in the second year. From the third
year forward, training and certification costs are the same under all options.

4.8.3 Total 50-Year and 50-Year Annualized Costs
The total costs are also calculated discounted over a 50-year period. Discounting refers to the economic
conversion of future costs (and benefits) to their present values, accounting for the fact that society tends
to value future costs or benefits less than comparable near-term costs or benefits. Discounting is
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 4-85
important when the values of costs or benefits occur over a multiple year period and may vary from year
to year. Discounting enables the accumulation of the cost and benefit values from multiple years at a
single point in time, accounting for the difference in how society values those costs and benefits
depending on the year in which the values are estimated to occur.
The 50-year costs were estimated by developing a profile of the compliance costs associated with each
option over a 50-year period. (The 50-year period was chosen to be consistent with the economic analysis
done for the TSCA Section 403 Lead-Based Paint Hazard Standards.) The profile of costs over time was
developed by estimating an annual decline in pre-1978 housing stock of 0.41 percent per-year and
assuming that the regulated universe would decrease by that rate every year. That rate was calculated
using the average annual compound rate of change in the pre-1980 housing stock using data from the
1990 and 2000 Decennial Census (U.S. Census Bureau 1990 and 2000c). This rate affects costs because
it decreases the number of events and number of workers trained every year.
As discussed above, first year training and certification costs account for the training and certification of
all renovators and firms to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP services in the first year. For Option B
and Option D, it is assumed that the additional individuals and firms will obtain training and certification
in the second year to meet the increase in demand associated with the larger number of regulated RRP
events in the second year. In subsequent years, it is assumed that one fifth of the necessary stock of
individuals and firms will obtain training and certification each year (since refresher-training and re-
certification is required every five years).
In fact, if all the individuals and firms needed to meet the demand for lead-safe RRP are trained and
certified in the first and second years, one might expect a drop in the level of training and certification in
the third year followed by a spike in the future years. That is, one might expect a cyclical pattern of
training and certification to emerge. This analysis assumes a typical amount of training and certification
occurs each year because modeling such a trend would add little to the analysis without being able to
precisely estimate the extent of any cyclicality.
The total 50-year costs and the 50-year annualized costs are discounted using rates of 3 and 7 percent.
These discount rate values reflect guidance from the Office of Management and Budget regulatory
analysis guidance document, Circular A-4 (OMB, 2003).
The following formula was used to calculate the present value (PV) of the time stream of costs:
PV = )1(
,
)1(  t
tx
r
Cost
where:
Costt = Costs in year t;
r = Discount rate (3 percent and 7 percent); and
t = Year in which cost is incurred.
This analysis also presents the 50-year annualized costs of the rule. Conceptually, the 50-year annualized
cost is the level annual payment that one would have to make to pay off a debt equal to the present value
total 50-year cost for a given interest rate (the discount rate).
The following formula is used to calculate the 50-year annualized cost.

Table 4-69 shows the present value of the total 50-year costs, and Table 4-70 shows the annualized 50-
year costs for the options considered. Because the test kits available for the first year (i.e., starting in June
2010) have a high false positive rate, including the newer housing units in the regulated universe before
improved test kits are available is relatively costly. This is because the high rate of false positives will
require many units without LBP to use the more costly work practices.

4.9 Alternative Regulatory Options: Options E1 – E4
Options A through D differ only in the timing of how the regulated universe is covered. This section
presents cost estimates for various work practice alternatives to Option A, including: (1) requiring interior
containment without any cleaning or verification requirements, (2) requiring interior cleaning without any
containment or verification requirements, (3) requiring interior cleaning and verification without any
interior containment requirements, and (4) no ban on prohibited practices and no exterior vertical
containment requirements. Like Option A, these options would become effective June 2010, and would
be applied to all pre-1978 housing eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008 LRRP rule. In
addition, the requirement for the renovator to provide the recordkeeping checklist to the owners and
occupants would apply in both the renovations covered by the 2008 LRRP rule and those formerly
eligible for the opt-out provision. Options E1 to E4 cover the same number of renovation events as
Option A, and result in the same number of renovators being trained and firms certified. Thus, Options
E1 to E4 have the same training, certification, and checklist costs as Option A, but the work practice costs
differ from Option A.
4.9.1 Alternative Interior Containment, Cleaning, and Verification Requirements
Section 4.3 presents the work practice unit costs for the following three components: (1) containment, (2)
cleaning, and (3) verification. Under the alternative regulatory options presented in Table 4-71, not all of
these work practice components are required and therefore compliance costs are lower. Not requiring any
interior cleaning or verification, but requiring rule containment, lowers the total annualized costs by about
12 percent compared to Option A. Requiring rule-style interior cleaning and verification, but not
requiring interior containment also lowers the annualized total costs of the rule by 12 percent compared to
Option A. Not requiring any interior containment or verification, but requiring rule-style cleaning, results
in the largest decline in total annualized costs of about 17 percent compared to Option A.

4.9.2 Regulatory Alternative without a Paint Removal Practice Prohibition
This alternative regulatory option has the same scope and work practice requirements as Option A, except
that there is no prohibition or restriction on open-flame burning or torching of LBP; operating a heat gun
on LBP at 1100° F or higher; or using machines that remove LBP through high speed operation (such as
sanding, grinding, power planing, needle gun, abrasive blasting, or sandblasting) without HEPA exhaust
control. As shown in Table 4-72, if the rule allows these paint removal practices to continue to be used,
total annualized costs for the option would be 1 percent lower than for Option A.

 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-1    
5. Benefits of the Revisions to the LRRP Rule  
This chapter presents a discussion of the benefits associated with reducing lead exposure by revising the 
lead, renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations.  The proposed revisions to the LRRP 
program include: (1) the removal of the opt-out provision (currently available for owner-occupied target 
housing without either children under the age of 6 or a pregnant woman in residence and where the 
housing is not a COF), and (2) an additional requirement that the renovator provide a copy of their 
recordkeeping checklist to owners and occupants of renovated structures. 
An overview of the opt-out provision, as it applies to this benefits estimation, is provided in Section  5.1.  
Section  5.2 presents calculated values meant to serve as a proxy for the magnitude of benefits under this 
action.  Section  5.3 includes a discussion of the benefits of the additional recordkeeping checklist 
provision requirement.  Finally, in Section  5.4, the human health and ecological consequences of lead 
exposure are summarized.   
The proposed work practices, training and certification requirements for the housing units previously 
eligible for the opt-out provision will reduce lead exposure by increasing the containment and cleanup of 
dust and debris generated by renovation, repair, and painting (RRP) activities.  Additional reductions in 
lead exposure will be achieved by prohibiting the use of certain paint preparation and removal techniques 
in jobs that require lead-safe work practices.  These reductions in exposure will in turn reduce the risks of 
adverse health and ecological effects in the vicinity of these activities.  
A great deal of information on the numerous adverse health effects of lead is available from decades of 
medical observation and scientific research.  Inhaled or ingested lead is distributed throughout the body 
and is toxic to many organ systems.  As a result, its toxicity manifests itself in the form of impacts on 
several organ systems.  A reduction in lead exposure resulting from the rule would lead to a reduction in 
these adverse health effects and the costs of treating them.  Young children (from birth through age five) 
are particularly sensitive to lead, which impairs a child’s neuropsychological development (frequently 
measured by IQ change).  EPA’s Air Quality Criteria for Lead (EPA 2006b) provided a thorough review 
of the available science on lead-related health and ecological effects.  An excerpt from the Executive 
Summary is provided in section  5.4 of this analysis. 
With regard to potential implications of lead effects on IQ, the Criteria Document recognizes the 
‘‘critical’’ distinction between population and individual risk, identifying issues regarding declines in IQ 
for an individual and for the population. The Criteria Document further states that a ‘‘point estimate 
indicating a modest mean change on a health index at the individual level can have substantial 
implications at the population level’’ (CD, p. 8–77).  A downward shift in the mean IQ value is associated 
with both substantial decreases in percentages achieving very high scores and substantial increases in the 
percentage of individuals achieving very low scores (AQCD, p. 8–81).  For an individual functioning in 
the low IQ range due to the influence of developmental risk factors other than lead, a lead-associated IQ 
decline of several points might be sufficient to drop that individual into the range associated with 
increased risk of educational, vocational, and social failure (AQCD, p. 8–77).   
Other cognitive effects observed in studies of children have included effects on attention, executive 
functions, language, memory, learning and visuospatial processing (AQCD, sections 5.3.5, 6.2.5 and 
8.4.2.1), with attention and executive function effects associated with lead exposures indexed by blood 
lead levels below 10 µg/dL (AQCD, section 6.2.5 and pp. 8–30 to 8–31). The evidence for the role of lead 
in this suite of effects includes experimental animal findings (discussed in AQCD, section 8.4.2.1; p. 8–
31), which provide strong biological plausibility of lead effects on learning ability, memory and attention 
(AQCD, section 5.3.5), as well as associated mechanistic findings.  
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-2    
These cognitive and behavioral effects, discussed above, are strongly related to future productivity and 
expected earnings (Salkever 1995).   Based on Salkever’s coefficients, the estimated value of an IQ point 
is $12,953 (2005 dollars).  This IQ value is modeled as the present value of a loss in expected lifetime 
earnings due to a one point IQ drop.  The present value is calculated assuming that children would be 
affected by lead at 3 years of age, the median of the range when children are most susceptible to lead 
hazards; that while most people start working at age 18, average income in the early adult years is 
reduced because some are still in school; and that retirement occurs at the age of 67.  This estimated value 
of an IQ point is limited to reduced income, and does not include other potential impacts such as 
additional education costs for special and remedial education, and medical costs to treat very high levels 
of lead.   
Both epidemiologic and toxicological studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead 
affect many different organ systems (EPA 2006b, p.E-8).  It appears that some of these effects, 
particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's neurobehavioral 
development, may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a threshold (EPA 2004).   
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced 
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and increased 
hypertension (EPA 2006b).  Neurotoxic effects in children and cardiovascular effects in adults are among 
those best substantiated as occurring at blood-lead concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ug/dL (or possibly 
lower); and these categories of effects are currently clearly of greatest public health concern (EPA 2006b, 
p 8-60). Other newly demonstrated immune and renal system effects among general population groups 
are also emerging as low-level lead exposure effects of potential public health concern (EPA 2006b, p 8-
60).   
Some studies have examined the question of whether the neurological effects of exposures in early 
childhood are ameliorated when blood-lead levels decline.  The data are mixed on this issue.  In a study 
that treated lead-exposed children with a chelating agent, Ruff (1993) found that children whose blood-
lead levels had the greatest decline showed the most improvement in cognitive scores.  In contrast, Rogan 
(2001) found that treatment with a chelating agent lowered blood-lead levels in children but did not 
appear to improve neurological function.  Liu (2002) also found that chelation therapy at age 2, while 
lowering blood-lead levels, did not improve neurological function in children at 5 years of age.  While the 
study did detect a relationship between declining blood-lead and improved neurological function, this 
association was observed only in the untreated group, leading the authors to speculate that some other 
factor besides declining lead levels from chelation therapy (such as greater parental involvement), led to 
the neurological gains.  Dietrich (2004) had similar findings in the same cohort of children at 7 years of 
age.  One study cited in ATSDR (1999) showed impaired motor and cognitive function at a current mean 
level of 2.9 µg/dL, about 20 years after exposure when blood-lead levels were 40-50 µg/dL (Stokes 1998).  
The negative impact of lead on IQ and other neurobehavioral outcomes persist in most recent studies 
following adjustment for numerous confounding factors including social class, quality of caregiving, and 
parental intelligence. Moreover, these effects appear to persist into adolescence and young adulthood in 
the absence of marked reductions in environmental exposure to lead. (EPA 2006b, p. 6-76). This further 
supports the concern that early exposures to lead may lead to irreversible damage and supports the 
benefits of regulatory interventions to prevent and/or reduce lead exposure. 
5.1 Overview of Removal of Opt-Out Provision in Terms of Benefits Estimation 
Under 40 CFR 745.82(c), the LRRP rule’s training requirements and work practice standards do not apply 
to renovations in target housing when the firm performing the renovation has obtained a statement signed 
by the owner that the renovation will occur in the owner's residence, no child under age 6 resides there, no 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-3    
pregnant woman resides there, the housing is not a child-occupied facility, and the owner acknowledges 
that the renovation firm will not be required to use the work practices contained in EPA's renovation, 
repair, and painting rule.  This is referred to as the “opt-out provision” of the LRRP rule. 
After further consideration of the opt-out provision, the Agency believes it is in the best interest of the 
public to remove the provision.  EPA has decided it is important to require the LRRP work practices in 
target housing even if there is no child under age six or pregnant woman residing there and the housing is 
not a COF.  The 2008 LRRP rule focused mainly on protecting young children and pregnant women from 
lead hazards. Lead exposure adversely affects older children and adults.  Those effects most pertinent to 
adults at levels associated with individual blood lead levels in the range of 10 ug/dL and less include 
hematological, cardiovascular and renal effects.  
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced 
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and incidence of 
hypertension. A meta-analysis of numerous studies estimates that a doubling of blood-lead level (e.g., 
from 5 to 10 µg/dL) is associated with ~1.0 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) increase in systolic blood 
pressure and ~0.6 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure.  The evidence for an association of lead with 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is limited but supportive (EPA 2006b, p. E-10). 
The Criteria Document states ‘‘although an increase of a few mmHg in blood pressure might not be of 
concern for an individual’s well-being, the same increase in the population mean might be associated with 
substantial increases in the percentages of individuals with values that are sufficiently extreme that they 
exceed the criteria used to diagnose hypertension’’ (EPA 2006b, p. 8–77). 
Renovation activities that disturb lead-based paint create high dust-lead levels which are not removed 
through typical cleaning practices.  EPA’s Dust Study (EPA 2007) found that dust-lead levels created by 
renovation activities ranged from 422 to 32,633 µg/ft2.  While dry sweeping and the use of a regular shop 
vacuum resulted in a reduction in these levels, a significant amount of leaded dust remained.  All 
residents of the household or occupants of the building can be exposed to this dust, regardless of age.  
EPA’s Exposure Factors Handbook (EPA 1997) contains recommended soil and dust ingestion estimates 
for adults, and EPA’s Child-Specific Exposure Factors Handbook (EPA 2008a), which includes 
recommended soil and dust ingestion estimates for children between the ages of 6 and 21.  
By removing the opt-out provision the rule will go farther toward protecting older children and adult 
occupants of target housing where no child under six or pregnant woman resides.   In addition, removal of 
the opt-out provision will provide additional protection for women who do not know they are pregnant at 
the time a renovation commences, women who become pregnant shortly after a renovation occurs, and 
women of child-bearing age in general.  This is particularly important because the transplacental transfer 
of lead in humans is well documented, and infants are generally born with a lead body burden reflecting 
that of the mother.   
Removing the opt-out provision also protects children under the age of six who spend a limited amount of 
time in housing (such as a relative or caregiver’s house) where a renovation has been performed under the 
opt-out provision; children who move into such housing when their family purchases it after such a 
renovation has been performed; and children who live in a property adjacent or near to owner-occupied 
housing where renovation has been performed under the opt-out provision.      
Some locations where children under the age of six regularly receive child care are eligible for the opt-out 
provision because of the way a child-occupied facility (COF) is defined.  A COF is defined as ‘‘a 
building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978, visited regularly by the same child, under the 
age of six, on at least 2 different days within any week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that 
each day’s visit lasts at least 3 hours and the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-4    
combined annual visits last at least 60 hours.” Non-resident children may regularly visit or receive child 
care in target housing that is eligible for the opt-out provision because the children do not spend enough 
time there for the building to meet the COF definition.  These children may nevertheless receive a dose of 
lead from playing in dust-lead hazards created by renovations performed under the opt-out provision 
Removing the opt-out provision will also result in fewer homes being purchased with pre-existing lead 
hazards. It is common for home owners to perform activities that disturb paint before selling a house.  
Under the RRP rule, the opt-out provision was limited to owner-occupied target housing and did not 
extend to rental housing because of the concern that future lessees could unknowingly move into a rental 
unit where dust-lead hazards created by the renovation are present.  In the same way, dust-lead hazards 
created during renovations in an owner-occupied residence conducted prior to a sale will be present for 
the next occupants.  Removing the opt-out provision decreases the likelihood of lead hazards being 
present when someone else (which may include a child under the age of six or a pregnant woman) moves 
into the home. 
Eliminating the opt-out provision will also protect individuals including pregnant women and families 
with young children residing adjacent to homes undergoing renovations.  Under the 2008 LRRP rule, an 
owner occupant can take advantage of the opt-out provision even if a child under 6 or pregnant woman 
lives in an adjacent home.  Renovations on the exterior of a residence can spread leaded dust and debris 
some distance from the renovation activity, which is why, for regulated exterior renovations, EPA 
requires renovation firms to cover the ground with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material a 
distance of 10 feet from the renovation.  If homeowners opt out of the LRRP program, renovations on the 
exterior of their homes are likely to contaminate neighboring yards and porches, resulting in exposure 
inside the neighboring houses as well as outside (because exterior dust is tracked into the home).   
Removing the opt-out provision will also provide protection to family pets living in owner-occupied 
housing where no children under age 6 or pregnant women reside.  Lead poisoning resulting from 
renovations has been identified as a means of exposure in both cats and dogs (Knight 2003, Kowalczyk 
1976).  This can result in both veterinary care costs and, in some instances, loss of a family pet.     
5.1.1 Regulatory Options Under the Elimination of the Opt-Out Provision 
This economic analysis considers several regulatory options related to removal of the opt-out provision 
(See Table  5-1).  Options A through D all include containment, cleaning, and cleaning verification 
requirements, as well as restricting or prohibiting certain paint removal practices.  Options A through D 
differ in terms of the effective date of the proposed rule and the universe of structures affected in each 
year (phasing in of regulatory coverage).  Options A and D both have effective dates of June 2010, but 
Option A does not phase in regulatory coverage while Option D is limited to pre-1960 structures during 
Phase 1 of the regulation and its scope is expanded to include structures built between 1960 and 1978 in 
Phase 2, which has an effective date of June 2011.  Options B and D have effective dates of January 2011 
and June 2011, respectively, and neither option phases in regulatory coverage.  Options E1 to E4 cover 
the same target housing universe and have the same effective date as Option A, but do not provide the 
same level of protection because they do not require all of the work practice standards under 40 CFR 
734.85.

5.2 Calculated Benefits of Eliminating the Opt-Out Provision 
EPA has calculated crude benefits numbers for several groups of individuals protected by removing the 
opt-out provision.  This has been done by estimating the number of individuals in each group and 
combining this with the average benefit per individual for a similar group from previous LRRP rule 
analyses.  These averages do not replicate the scenarios used in the previous analyses, which included an 
array of factors such as age of child, type of renovation, size of job, and building vintage, so the 
calculations in this chapter do not reflect the methodology that EPA previously had peer reviewed for the 
LRRP rule analysis.   
As a result of severe time constraints for the conduct of this analysis, the average benefits per individual 
from the previous analyses have not been modified to reflect any differences in exposure between 
populations protected by the 2008 rule and those protected by the removal of the opt-out provision.  
While these values can serve as a proxy to provide a sense of the magnitude of benefits from this action, 
the amount of error in these values is unknown.  The exposure scenarios differ between this rule and the 
2008 rule, for example, in the length of time that individuals spend in renovated structures, and in the 
frequency, types, and sizes of renovations affected by the two rulemakings.  Simple computational 
adjustments to the average benefits to try and address the differences in the scenarios do not fully reflect 
the complex nature of the relationships being addressed.  For example, there are two key relationships 
involved in calculating IQ change – going from lead exposure to blood lead, and from blood lead to IQ.  
Both of these relationships are non-linear, with the steepest slopes at lower levels, meaning that IQ effects 
are proportionately greater for lower exposures and blood lead levels.   
Moreover, because of the complex interactions between different components of the previous analysis for 
the 2008 rule, how the estimated benefits differ between scenarios is not always obvious.  For example, 
children who receive childcare in a COF in target housing generally spend less time there than in their 
own residence.  Yet as described later in this section, based on the 2008 analysis, preventing exposures to 
the children in target housing COFs yields an average benefit of $1,772 per child, which is larger than the 
average benefit of $1,384 per child for children residing in target housing.  (This is due to differences in 
average background lead levels and the non-linear relations that are being modeled.)  This example 
demonstrates the pitfalls of making simplified assumptions such as calculating the benefits to one group 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-6    
of children by scaling the estimated benefits to a different group of children based on the amount of time 
spent at home or in childcare.  In the example given above, calculating the average benefits per child for 
children in target housing COFs by a linear scaling of the results for children residing in target housing 
would yield a lower average benefits value for the non-residential children, while the 2008 analysis 
indicates that the benefits are higher.   
Estimating benefits from avoided lead exposure is not an issue that lends itself to simplified calculations.  
Thus, the benefits calculations used here should be viewed as crude indicators of the magnitude of 
benefits.  In light of this, the analysis calculates benefits under two different scenarios.  In one of the 
scenarios, aggregate benefits are based on average benefits per individual from previous analyses 
multiplied by an estimate of the number of people affected by the proposed rule.  In the second scenario, 
benefits are calculated by applying a simple linear adjustment factor to one of the components in the first 
scenario, in order to reflect the uncertainties created by relying on the average benefit per individual from 
previous analyses as a basis for the calculation. 
It would not be accurate to characterize the average benefits per child calculated here as an upper bound 
estimate.  The change in IQ may be larger for children with lower exposures, due to the non-linearities in 
the relationships.  Because the previous LRRP rule analysis reflected a broad range of exposures and 
conditions, the IQ benefits in the earlier analysis may include flatter sections of the curves.   To the extent 
that children protected by removing the opt-out provision are on steeper sections of the curves, the 
average benefit per child calculated from the 2008 analysis may underestimate the benefit of avoiding 
exposures by removing the opt-out provision. 
A limitation of this analysis is that the benefits calculations presented here are only based on some of the 
populations protected by the rule, and on some of the health effects avoided due to the rule.  The 
population groups discussed below do not reflect all of the individuals protected by removing the opt-out, 
but instead represent groups for which calculations can be readily made.  For example, these calculations 
do not include individuals living in detached houses adjacent to houses renovated under the opt-out 
provision, or children who spend time in a friend or relative’s house renovated under the opt-out.  
Furthermore, the calculations do not include the benefits of avoiding other effects that can be caused by 
lead exposure such as neurobehavioral impacts in children (e.g., aggression, attention deficit problems, 
and hyperactivity), as well as various other health effects that can also occur in individuals of all ages 
(including renal effects, immune system effects, and reproductive and developmental effects).  The 
benefits of avoiding these effects were not quantified in the previous LRRP analyses, and thus are not 
calculated here. 
Benefits are calculated in this chapter for several groups of individuals affected by the removal of the opt-
out provision:  those residing in housing renovated under the opt-out provision; those living contiguous to 
attached housing renovated under the opt-out provision; those moving in to housing renovated by the 
previous owner under the opt-out provision; and those receiving childcare in housing renovated under the 
opt-out provision. 
5.2.1 Individuals Residing in Housing Units Renovated Under the Opt-out Provision 
Lead can result in serious effects for adults at low blood lead levels.  According to the Clean Air 
Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) Lead Review Panel (CASAC 2007a): 
Lead’s effects extend beyond childhood. In adults, lead exposure is a risk factor for some of the 
most prevalent diseases or conditions of industrialized society, including cardiovascular disease 
and renal disease (16–20). There is also compelling evidence that the risks for mortality from 
stroke and myocardial infarction are increased at PbB concentrations below 10 µg/dl, which is 
considerably lower than those considered acceptable for adults (19). Finally, although less 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-7    
definitive, there is also evidence that lead exposure during pregnancy is a risk factor for 
spontaneous abortion or miscarriage at PbB concentrations < 10 µg/dl (21).  
CASAC has advised EPA not to focus only on IQ changes in children (CASAC 2007b): 
While the CASAC agrees with the Agency’s choice of IQ alterations in young children as the 
priority health effect and population for the risk assessment, the Lead Panel cautions against 
focusing only on IQ loss (or gain). There are ramifications of lead exposure on other endpoints 
that have societal and individual implications of great importance. Neurological developmental 
and functional effects in children exposed to Pb can lead to negative and disruptive behaviors 
well into teenage years. Moreover, while the adult nervous system has long been recognized as a 
target of Pb toxicity, epidemiologic and experimental toxicology data are emerging that support 
the relationship between Pb exposure and increased adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including 
increased blood pressure, increased incidence of hypertension, and cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality at lower and lower levels of exposure. 
Removing the opt-out provision will benefit adults by reducing their exposure to lead dust generated by 
RRP activities in housing eligible for the opt-out provision.  The first step in calculating these benefits is 
to estimate the number of individuals that would be protected by eliminating the opt-out provision.  This 
is done by estimating the number of affected housing units.  Next the number of occupants in the affected 
households must be estimated.  Then the number of individuals protected is estimated as the number of 
individuals who reside where LBP is disturbed during RRP.  Finally, the number of individuals is 
multiplied by the average benefit per individual. 
5.2.1.1 Estimating the Number of Individuals Residing in Housing Units Renovated Under the Opt-
out Provision 
The elimination of the opt-out provision would affect owner-occupied target housing units where no child 
under the age of six or pregnant woman resides, and that do not meet the definition of a COF.  Owner-
occupied housing units where a child under the age of six or a pregnant woman resides can be identified 
in the 2003 American Housing Survey (AHS) data.  (See Chapter 4 for a detailed discussion of the AHS 
data.)  AHS respondents report information about the ages of householders, who are defined by the survey 
as persons who live or sleep there most of the time.  Thus, child-occupied households are defined as those 
households with a householder under the age of six at the time of the RRP.  Child-occupied households 
are estimated as households with a householder between the ages of one and seven at the time of the 
survey, since it is assumed that any RRP reported occurred a year earlier.  (RRP performed up to two 
years earlier may be reported.)  It follows that the number of households occupied by pregnant women 
can be estimated as the number of households with a woman of childbearing age and a child who is under 
the age of one in the household at the time of the survey.   
As described above, the AHS data can be used to identify rental units and target housing units where no 
child under the age of six or pregnant woman resides.  However, to estimate the number of units that 
would be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision, target housing units that are also COFs 
must also be identified so they can be excluded from the count of affected units.  
Note that COFs in target housing include family daycare providers and the homes of family, friends, and 
neighbors who regularly care for someone else’s children.  The estimates include care provided with and 
without compensation and rely primarily on estimates of the size of the childcare workforce (Center for 
the Child Care Workforce, 2002).  The Center for the Child Care Workforce (2002) report includes: (1) 
data on family child care providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes, (2) paid relatives and 
non-relatives providing child care, and (3) unpaid relatives and non-relatives providing child care.   
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-8    
The number of target housing COFs is projected based on estimates of the caregiver workforce in the 
Center for the Child Care Workforce (2002) report.  Based on a Wilder Research Center report, it is 
assumed that 10 percent of family child care providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes 
employ 2 workers (Wilder Research Center 2001, p.16).  For the remaining childcare providers, one 
worker is assumed per location.  Based on 2003 AHS data for the general population of target housing, it 
is assumed that 65 percent of these housing units were built before 1978.   
The number of target housing units is adjusted to account for units that are already included in the LRRP 
rule universe or do not qualify as COFs because: (1) care is provided in a child’s own home, or (2) less 
than six hours of care per week is provided.  In addition, the number of target housing units where 
childcare is provided that are regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule without qualifying as COFs must be 
estimated to avoid double counting.  This includes: (1) units where the caregiver is pregnant or has a child 
under six living in the household, and (2) units where the caregiver lives in a rental unit.  The basis for 
these adjustments is presented below. 
¾ Care Provided in Child’s Own Home  
 It is assumed that 22 percent of relatives and non-relatives (paid or unpaid) provide care in 
the child’s home; this is based on a Wilder Research Center (2005, p.28) report on the results 
of the 2004 Minnesota Statewide Household Child Care Survey. 
¾ Less Than Six Hours of Care Per-Week is Provided 
 Of those providing care in their own home, it is assumed that 27 percent of relatives and non-
relatives (paid or unpaid) provide care for less than six hours a week (Wilder Research Center 
2005, p.28).  All family daycare providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes 
are assumed to care for at least one child for more than six hours a week. 
¾ Caregiver Lives in a Rental Unit 
 It is assumed that family, friend, and neighbor caregivers have the same likelihood of living 
in a rental unit as the general population of target housing occupants (39 percent). 
¾ Caregiver has a Child Under Six Living With Them 
 Based on the January 2006 Current Population Survey (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
2006), 16 percent of Child Care Workers have children under six.  Thus, it is assumed that 16 
percent of in-home family daycare providers (formal care providers) caring for unrelated 
children in their own homes themselves have children under the age of six.  Based on the 
Wilder Research Center (2005, p.19) report, 57.5 percent of family, friend, and neighbor 
caregivers (informal care providers) have children under the age of 12.  Thus it is assumed 
that half as many, or 29 percent, have children under the age of six. 
¾ Caregiver is Pregnant 
 It was estimated that 1.1% of owner-occupied households with no child under the age of six 
were occupied by a pregnant woman using the 2003 AHS data.

As described in Table  5-2, there are about 824,000 target housing COFs where no child under the age of 
six or a pregnant woman resides.  Thus, of the 47,080,000 owner occupied housing units (see Section 2.8 
of Chapter 2): 
 
¾ A child under six resides or pregnant woman resides in 6,370,000 units (see Section 2.8 of 
Chapter 2) 
¾ About 824,000 units are COFs where no child under the age of six or pregnant woman resides 
(see Table  5-2) 
Therefore, about 39,886,000 units would be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision.1 
5.2.1.3 Number of Individuals Residing in Housing Units Affected by the Elimination of the Opt-
Out Provision 
Only individuals age six and greater reside in housing units that would be affected by the elimination of 
the opt-out provision.  Using the methodology described in Section 4.2 of Chapter 4, it was estimated that 
about 5.7 percent of pre-1978 households disturb LBP during RRP annually.  In pre-1960 households, 
which are more likely to contain LBP, 10.1 percent households disturb LBP during RRP annually. The 
resulting estimates of the number of individuals who reside in these housing units where LBP is disturbed 
during RRP are presented in Table  5-3.

b. The stock of target housing, and therefore the number of individuals living in 
target housing, is assumed to decline by 0.41% per year (due to demolitions, 
conversions, etc,) based on Census data.  
c.  Options E1 to E4 cover the same target housing universe and have the same 
effective date as Option A, but do not provide the same level of protection 
because they do not require all of the work practice standards under 40 CFR 
734.85.   
 
Since the opt-out provision is eliminated under Option A as soon as the rule becomes effective, all 
individuals residing in opt-out eligible housing performing RRP that disturbs LBP are protected in the 
first year.  Since the opt-out provision under Option B is eliminated six months later (halfway through the 
beginning of the first year the rule is in place), the number of individuals protected under Option B in the 
first year is half the number estimated for Option A. Under Option C, the opt-out provision is eliminated a 
year later.  Under Option D the opt-out provision is eliminated as soon as the rule becomes effective for 
housing built before 1960.  Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of 
regulated structures as Option A, but consider alternative work practice requirements.  As indicated in the 
numbers presented in Table  5-3, the majority of the individuals that would be protected by the elimination 
of the opt-out provision reside in housing built before 1960 because of the higher likelihood of LBP in 
these housing units.  In the second year (starting June 2011), the opt-out provision would be eliminated 
under all options.2 
5.2.1.4 Calculated Benefits to Individuals Residing in Housing Units Renovated Under the Opt-out 
Provision 
EPA’s Economic Analysis for the 2006 proposed LRRP rule included estimates of benefits from avoided 
increases in blood pressure due to lead exposure and associated incidences of hypertension, heart attack, 
stroke, and death (EPA 2006b).  The proposed rule was estimated to protect around 4.5 million 
individuals age 6 and older, resulting in annualized adult benefit of $2.25 billion/year, which is equivalent 
to an average benefit of $523 per year per person.  The 2006 proposed rule only estimated cardiovascular 
benefits for adults age 40 and older, but the number of such adults protected by the LRRP rule was not 
listed in the Economic Analysis report.  Instead, the 2006 report provides information on the number of 
                                                     
2 The stock of target housing, and therefore the number of individuals living in target housing, is assumed to decline by 0.41% 
per year (due to demolitions, conversions, etc.) based on Census data.    
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-11    
individuals age 6 and older.  Dividing total estimated adult benefits from the 2006 LRRP analysis by the 
number of individuals 6 and older protected by the LRRP rule underestimates the average cardiovascular 
benefit per person for adults 40 and older.  However, assuming that the ratio of the number of adults over 
age 40 protected to the number of all individuals over age 6 protected is similar for both the LRRP rule 
and the proposed opt-out rule, multiplying the average benefit per individual age 6 and above by the 
number of individuals age 6 and above protected by the opt-out rule yields an estimate of the 
cardiovascular benefits of the opt-out rule to adults age 40 and older.      
Table  5-4 combines that $523 average with the 5.2 million individuals age 6 and older living in opt-out 
housing to calculate cardiovascular benefits under Scenario 2.  Similar to the IQ change calculations 
discussed earlier, this is a crude indicator that does not account for differences in renovations or exposure 
between the LRRP rule and the opt-out proposal.  This calculation is limited to cardiovascular effects and 
does not include the avoided incidence of other effects such as renal effects, immune system effects, and 
reproductive and developmental effects.  
Due to the uncretainty in calculating benefits using the average benefit per individual from a previous 
LRRP analysis, Scenario 1 is calculated assuming that the average cardiovascular benefit per individual is 
a quarter of the Scenario 2 value, or an average of $130.86 per individual age 6 and older.  This could 
reflect potential improvements in treatment of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease since the 
1970’s and 1980’s, when the data on which the Scenario 2 benefits per individual were based, were 
collected.  These results are also shown in Table  5-4. 
As discussed in the 2006 analysis (EPA 2006a, p. 5-42), EPA acknowledges that the dose-response 
functions noted in that analysis rely on older published data and that not all of these data were included in 
the review presented in Appendix 5A of the 2006 document.  As part of this proposal, EPA has 
specifically asked for comment on how it can more fully quantify the benefits associated with avoiding 
the other adverse effects associated with lead exposure to both children and adults that were not included 
in this analysis.  EPA will consider these comments in determining how to characterize the benefits for 
the final rule.

5.2.2 Number of Individuals Residing in Housing Attached to Opt-Out Housing 
Another group that would benefit from the removal of the opt-out provision is neighbors living nearby.  
The Dust Study indicates that exterior renovations generate large quantities of lead dust that spreads from 
the renovation site.  This lead dust can contaminate neighboring properties.  This analysis calculates the 
benefits of removing the opt-out provision for residents of neighboring properties, but the calculation is 
limited to a subset of such properties.  The benefits calculation is based on the number of neighbors living 
in attached housing (such as townhouses) contiguous with housing renovated under the opt-out provision.  
In the Dust Study, testing samples taken 12 to 15 feet or more from the renovation work showed high dust 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-12    
lead levels.  These distances are sufficient to reach across the property lines of attached houses.  However, 
dust from RRP work can also contaminate non-contiguous attached houses and detached houses.  
Therefore, the individuals counted here represent a subset of the number of neighbors potentially exposed 
from RRP work on opt-out housing. 
Based on American Housing Survey (AHS) data (U.S. Census 2003), there are approximately 3.4 million 
attached housing units built before 1978, of which 1.9 million are owner-occupied.  About 1.6 million of 
these units (or 48 percent of the 3.4 million pre-1978 attached units) are eligible for the opt-out provision 
under the 2008 LRRP rule because there is no child under the age of 6 or pregnant woman in residence 
and the unit is not a COF.  According to the AHS data, about 751 thousand children under the age of six 
and 7.7 million individuals age six and older reside in these 3.4 million pre-1978 attached housing units.  
These individuals are among those who may be exposed to lead dust generated from exterior RRP work 
performed on a nearby unit that is renovated under the opt-out provision.  
The number of exposed individuals in attached housing units contiguous to a unit renovated under the 
opt-out provision is calculated by extrapolating from the existing LRRP analyses based on the number of 
exterior renovations that disturb lead-based paint.  The number of attached opt-out housing units with 
exterior renovations that disturb lead-based paint and comply with the rule represent 3.2 percent of all 
compliant regulated single family housing units (assuming a 75 percent compliance rate).3  Assuming 
each attached opt-out unit is attached to two other housing units (one on either side), the probability that 
LBP is disturbed during exterior RRP in an adjacent unit is double the 3.2 percent, or 6.4 percent4.  Since 
about 48 percent of attached housing units are eligible for the opt-out provision, 3.1 percent of all 
attached housing units will be attached to an opt-out eligible housing unit where LBP is disturbed during 
exterior RRP work (where 3.1 percent is the product of 48 percent and 6.4 percent).  Thus, it is estimated 
that the removal of the opt-out provision would protect 23 thousand children and 238 thousand 
individuals aged 6 and older from exterior RRP work that disturbs LBP on a contiguous attached housing 
unit. 
The benefits to children in contiguous attached housing are calculated using the average benefit per child 
from the analysis of the 2008 LRRP final rule (EPA 2008b) for children under six residing in target 
housing with exterior renovation jobs.  That value was $689.32 per child, and is used to calculate benefits 
under both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.5   
There are multiple factors that influence the benefits to individuals in these contiguous attached housing.  
Because of insufficient data, the analysis does not address these factors.  For example, calculating benefits 
based on the average benefit for exterior RRP events from the 2008 analysis may underestimate the 
                                                     
3 3.2 percent is calculated as the sum of the exterior events where test kits correctly identified the presence of LBP in single 
family owner-occupied housing (1,226 thousand, see Table 4-13) divided by the total number of single family owner-
occupied housing units, 38.1 million. 
4 Some houses that are semi-attached (e.g., duplexes and end units) rather than townhouses were included in this analysis, and 
such units are attached to one other housing unit instead of two units.  It should be noted that semi-attached houses are 
typically placed on small lots.  Thus, the distance between the opt-out house and the non-contiguous adjacent house are 
typically relatively small.  These non-contiguous adjacent houses are not included in this analysis, but the impact on 
residents of such housing may be similar to residents of attached houses. 
5 Numerous epidemiological studies have reported neurocognitive, neurobehavioral, sensory, and motor function effects in 
children with blood lead levels below 10µg/dL (CD, sections 6.2 and 8.4). [FN 7.  Further, neurological effects in general 
include behavioral effects, such as delinquent behavior (CD, sections 6.2.6 and 8.4.2.2), sensory effects, such as those 
related to hearing and vision (CD, sections 6.2.7 and 8.4.2.3), and deficits in neuromotor function (CD, p. 8–36).]  The 
benefits of avoiding other adverse effects caused by lead exposure were not quantified in the previous analyses, and thus are 
not calculated here.  See section  5.4 for a discussion of these health effects. 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-13    
benefits to children living in contiguous attached housing of removing the opt-out provision.  The 2008 
analysis of exterior target housing RRP events calculated a single average lead level for an entire yard, 
assumed to be 9,304 square feet in size.  (The use of a yard-wide average was based on the modeling 
assumption that a child is equally likely to spend time in any part of a yard.)  The yard-wide lead level 
was a weighted average calculated by combining the lead levels from three component areas – the 
dripline area, the nearby area, and the rest of the yard.  The dripline area was between 4 feet and 12 feet 
from the house (depending on the Dust Study experiment being modeled) and the lead loading was based 
on samples taken from the area covered by rule plastic in the Dust Study.  The nearby area extended from 
3 feet to 8 feet from the dripline area (again depending on the Dust Study experiment being modeled), and 
the lead loading was based on samples taken from the area covered by containment plastic in the Dust 
Study.  The lead level in the rest of the yard was an average soil level taken from HUD NSLAH data, and 
was significantly below the levels in the dripline and nearby areas.  Since the yard-wide average lead 
level is the weighted average of these three areas, and the rest of the yard area was larger than the other 
areas, the yard-wide average lead level was well below the levels in the dripline area and the nearby area. 
The yards for typical attached housing are likely to be smaller than those for detached housing.  For some 
attached housing, the entire yard size is an area equivalent to the dripline area or the combined dripline 
and nearby areas.  The lead levels in the yards of both renovated attached opt-out housing and the 
contiguous attached housing may be underestimated by using yard-wide lead levels based on a 9,304 
square feet yard.  Other factors, such as neighboring housing not being subject to the work practices (like 
closing windows and using plastic to collect lead dust) may affect the magnitude or exposure and related 
benefits for children in neighboring attached housing, compared to those for children in housing 
undergoing renovation.  Because the net effect of such factors is unknown, the average benefit per child 
in Scenarios 1 and 2 are the same for this group of exposed children.  Combining the number of children 
with the average benefit per child, Table  5-5 presents the calculated benefit of removing the opt-out 
provision in terms of the avoided IQ loss for children residing in contiguous attached housing units.

5.2.3 Individuals Moving into Housing Units Renovated Under the Opt-Out Provision  
Another group that would benefit from the removal of the opt-out provision is individuals who move into 
housing units that were recently renovated under the opt-out provision.  Owners typically perform 
painting and renovation work prior to selling a house, and baseline cleaning (i.e., not following the rule’s 
work practices) removes only visible dust, often leaving behind lead dust hazards.  Thus, individuals who 
move into a house where RRP work has been performed under the opt-out provision will be exposed to 
the lead dust that remains.   
Based on AHS data (U.S. Census 2003), there are about 2.8 million owner-occupied target housing units 
that are sold per year, and about 927 thousand children under the age of six and 6.5 million individuals 
ago six and above move into these units.  About 85 percent of these housing units were eligible for the 
opt-out provision under the previous owner, based on the overall percentage of owner-occupied target 
housing units that are eligible for the opt-out provision.  Thus, each year about 785,000 children under the 
age of 6 and 5.5 million individuals age six and above move into units that were eligible for the opt-out 
provision.  
Overall, an average of about 35 percent of renovations in opt-out housing disturb lead-based paint (see 
Table 4-13 in Chapter 4).  Scenario 1 uses this 35 percent and assumes that RRP work is performed in one 
quarter of these opt-out housing units before the units are sold.  Thus, under Scenario 1, about 69 
thousand children under the age of six and 481 thousand individuals age 6 and above move into housing 
units each year where LBP was disturbed during RRP.  Assuming 75 percent compliance with the rule, 
eliminating the opt-out provision will protect about 52 thousand children under the age of six and 361 
thousand individuals age six and above annually from RRP events where LBP was disturbed before they 
move in. 
Scenario 2 assumes that RRP work that disturbs lead-based paint is performed in all opt-out housing units 
before the units are sold.  Thus, under Scenario 2, assuming a 75 percent compliance rate, eliminating the 
opt-out provision will protect about 206 thousand children under the age of six and 1.4 million individuals 
age six and above annually from RRP events where LBP was disturbed before they move in. 
Benefits are calculated under this simplified scenario assuming that homeowners disturb lead-based paint 
by painting or remodeling shortly before their house is sold, so that relatively few iterations of routine 
cleaning occur prior to the new occupants moving in.  To the extent that there is an appreciable time 
period between when these RRP events occur and when new tenants move in, the lead levels in these 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-15    
housing units may be lower than the lead levels used in the 2008 analysis.  However, since the health 
effects models are non-linear, the size of the impact on the benefits calculation is not known.  
The average monetized benefit from the 2008 LRRP rule analysis for avoided IQ loss in children exposed 
in target housing where an RRP event was performed that disturbed lead-based paint is $1,384.07 (EPA 
2008b).  Table  5-7 presents the calculated benefits of avoided IQ loss for children residing in housing 
units where LBP is disturbed during a RRP event before they moved in.

As shown in Table  5-8, Scenarios 1 and 2 use the same average adult cardiovascular benefit per 
individual ($131 and $523, respectively) as Scenarios 1 and 2 in Section  5.2.1.4.  The calculations shown 
in this table are not included in the summary of the benefits calculations shown in Table  5-12.  Since the 
calculations for this scenario are based on the assumption that RRP work occurs shortly before the new 
occupants move in, the original owners are assumed to move out shortly after the RRP work is performed.  
Under this scenario, excluding the new residents from the total is equivalent to subtracting the individuals 
who move out from the number of individuals calculated in Table  5-4.  However, the adult benefit 
estimates in the 2006 analysis were based on a non-linear model, so benefits to avoiding exposure to two 
individuals (the home seller and the home buyer) for a shorter period of time may exceed the benefits of 
avoiding exposure to one individual for a longer time period.  Under a different scenario (where there was 
assumed to be a non-trivial time delay between when RRP work was performed and when the house was 
sold), it would be appropriate to count benefits to both the old and new occupants in the total.

 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-16    
5.2.4 Children Receiving Regular Care in Target Housing that is not a COF 
A target housing unit where a child visits regularly, but spends fewer that 6 hours a week, is not 
considered a child-occupied facility.  Therefore, these housing units, hereafter referred to as Regular Care 
Target Housing (RCTH) units, are eligible for the opt-out provision under the existing LRRP rule 
providing that there is no child under the age of six or pregnant woman that resides in the unit.  Thus, 
children visiting RCTH may benefit from the elimination of the opt-out provision by reducing their 
potential exposures to lead dust during these visits.  
The methodology developed to estimate the number of children protected from potential lead exposures in 
RCTH units eligible for the opt-out provision under the existing rule has three primary steps: (1) estimate 
the number of children who regularly visit RCTH units that are eligible for the opt-out provision, (2) 
estimate the frequency that LBP is disturbed during RRP in these units, and (3) combine the results.  
These steps are described in more detail below. 
5.2.4.1 Number of Children Visiting RCTH units 
The total population of children under the age of six and the estimated percentages of children in non-
parental care arrangements utilized in this analysis is from Mulligan et al. (2005) and is presented in 
Table  5-9.   Following the methodology from the economic analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule (EPA 2008b), 
it is assumed that all paid non-relative care arrangements are in COFs (care for at least one child is 
provided for more than six hours a week) and therefore would not be affected by the elimination of the 
opt-out provision.  However, some unpaid non-relative care arrangements and relative care arrangements 
(paid and unpaid) are expected to be for fewer than six hours a week and therefore may be in the RCTH 
units that would be affected by the elimination of the opt-out provision.  Of those providing care in their 
own home, it is assumed that 27 percent of relatives (paid and unpaid) and unpaid non-relatives provide 
care for less than six hours a week (Wilder Research Center 2005, p.28).  In addition, the estimates are 
adjusted by 22 percent so that they only include children receiving care in homes that are (1) target 
housing, (2) owner occupied, (3) where no pregnant woman resides, (4) outside the child’s own home, 
and (5) where no child under the age of six resides.6   
The adjustment factors listed above are combined to estimate the number of children who regularly visit 
RCTH units that are eligible for the opt-out provision of the existing LRRP rule presented in Table  5-9. 
                                                     
6 Based on 2003 AHS data it is estimated that 65 percent of housing units are target housing, 61 percent are owner-occupied, and 
98.9 percent of housing units are not occupied by a pregnant woman.  
Based on the Wilder Research Center (2005, p.19) report, 57.5 percent of family, friend, and neighbor caregivers (informal care 
providers) have children under the age of 12.  It is assumed that half as many, or 29 percent, have children under the age of 
six. Thus, 71 percent of RCTH units are not occupied by a child under the age of six. 
Based on a Wilder Research Center (2005, p.28) report on the results of the 2004 Minnesota Statewide Household Child Care 
Survey it is assumed that 78 percent of relatives and non-relatives (paid or unpaid) provide care outside the child’s home. 
The product of the above adjustment factors, 65%, 61%, 98.9%, 71%, and 78%, is 22%.

pregnant woman resides. The product of 61%, 65%, 78%, 71%, and 98.9% is 22%. 
 
5.2.4.2 Number of Children Visiting RCTH Protected by the Opt-Out Provision Elimination 
The second measure of the benefits for each of the regulatory options consists of the number of children 
regularly visiting RCTH units where LBP is disturbed during RRP in housing eligible for the opt-out 
provision under the existing rule. Using the methodology described in Section 4.2 of Chapter 4, it was 
estimated that about 5.7 percent of Pre-1978 households perform RRP that disturbs lead-based paint 
(LBP) annually.  In Pre-1960 households, which are more likely to contain LBP, 10.1 percent households 
perform RRP that disturbs lead-based paint (LBP) annually.  Combining the 5.7 percent of RRP events 
that disturb LBP with the 283,900 children receiving child care in RCTH units presented in Table  5-9 
yields the estimate of 16,215 children presented in Table  5-10.

b. The stock of target housing, and therefore the number of individuals living in 
target housing, is assumed to decline by 0.41% per year (due to demolitions, 
conversions, etc,) based on Census data.    
c.  Options E1 to E4 cover the same target housing universe and have the same 
effective date as Option A, but do not provide the same level of protection 
because they do not require all of the work practice standards under 40 CFR 
734.85.   
 
Since the opt-out provision is eliminated under Option A as soon as the rule becomes effective, all 
children receiving care in opt-out eligible RCTH performing RRP that disturbs LBP are protected in the 
first year. Since the opt-out provision under Option B is eliminated six months later (halfway through the 
beginning of the first year the rule is in place), the number of individuals protected under Option B in the 
first year is half the number estimated for Option A. Under Option C, the opt-out provision is eliminated a 
year later. Under Option D the opt-out provision is eliminated as soon as the rule becomes effective for 
housing built before 1960.  Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of 
regulated structures as Option A, but consider alternative work practice requirements.  As indicated in the 
numbers presented in Table  5-10, the majority of the children that would be protected by the elimination 
of the opt-out provision reside in housing built before 1960 because of the higher likelihood of LBP in 
these housing units.  In the second year (starting June 2011), the opt-out provision would be eliminated 
under all options. 
Calculated Benefits for Children in Opt-Out Eligible RCTH 
Under Scenario 2, the IQ benefit per child for children receiving care in RCTH units eligible for the opt-
out provision is calculated using the average monetized benefits due to IQ loss for children receiving 
childcare in target housing where LBP was disturbed during RRP work, taken from the Economic 
Analysis for the 2008 LRRP rule (EPA 2008b).  The average calculated benefit due to IQ loss for these 
children $1,771.97 per child.7  
                                                     
7 The benefits of avoiding other adverse effects caused by lead exposure (including such neurobehavioral impacts in children as 
aggression, attention deficit problems, and hyperactivity), as well as various other health effects that can also occur in older 
individuals (including renal effects, immune system effects, and reproductive and developmental effects), were not 
quantified in the previous analyses, and thus are not calculated here.  See section  5.4 for a discussion of these health effects. 
 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-19    
The average Scenario 2 benefit of $1,771.97 per child for children receiving childcare in target housing is 
higher than the $1,384.07 average benefit for children residing in target housing.  (Both of these values 
are for target housing where an RRP event was performed that disturbed LBP.)  At first glance this result 
seems counterintuitive, since children who reside in renovated target housing spend more time there on 
average than children who attend childcare in renovated target housing.  The result is due to differences in 
background levels for the two groups, and non-linearities in the benefits modeling.   
In the 2008 analysis, vintage-specific background levels were used to estimate media concentrations at 
the site where the RRP activity was occurring.  However, "overall" background levels were used to 
estimate media concentrations during time spent away from the site where the RRP activity was 
occurring.  The "overall" background level was the average background level across all vintages – 
including post-1978 buildings.  When the exposure scenario was at a child's house, and he spent some 
time at daycare, his background exposure was lower for the time at daycare.  When the exposure scenario 
was at a child's daycare, her background exposure was lower when she was at home. 
In the 2008 analysis, when a child started from a lower background level of exposure, the damage in 
terms of IQ loss from an exposure was greater.  This "background" effect dominated the effect from 
spending less time at the exposure site.  As described earlier in this report, there are two key relationships 
involved in calculating IQ change – going from lead exposure to blood lead, and from blood lead to IQ.  
Both of these relationships are nonlinear, with the steepest slopes at lower levels, meaning that IQ effects 
are proportionately greater for lower exposures and blood lead levels.  Thus, benefits from avoiding 
exposure are proportionately greater for children starting from a lower background level of exposure.  The 
children with the lowest average background exposure level are those exposed at daycare in target 
housing – because these children include children living in post-1978 housing.  The result is that children 
receiving childcare in target housing have a higher average benefit per child ($1,771.97 per child) under 
Scenario 2 than children exposed in all target housing units ($1,384.07 per child). 
According to data from the Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics’s 2005 
"Early Childhood Program Participation Survey", the average amount of time that children under the age 
of 6 spend in COFs in target housing varies by age of child, ranging from 25 to 30 hours per week.  
Because the 6 hours per week in childcare assumed for RCTH children is about one quarter of the average 
amount of time children spend in COFs, Scenario 1 assumes that the average benefit per child is one 
quarter that of Scenario 2, or $442.99 per child.  
To be classified as a COF, a pre-1978 building must be frequented by the same child at least two different 
days of the week, with each visit consisting of at least 3 hours each day, and the combined visits at least 6 
hours per week.  This can result in a situation where a facility is not classified as a COF even though a 
child receives more than 6 hours of care per week.  For example, if a child is in a pre-1978 building 2 
hours per day for 5 days a week, for a total of 10 hours per week, the building would not be classified as a 
COF.  Similarly, if a child is in a pre-1978 building 8 hours one day a week and 2.75 hours the other 6 
days a week, for a total of 24.5 hours per week, the building would also not be classified as a COF.  There 
are of course other scenarios in which day-care would occur for more than 6 hours a week but where the 
building would not be considered to be a COF.  Thus, although this analysis assumes that children spend 
an average of 6 hours per week in RCTH, this is not the upper bound for the time that children spend in 
RCTH.   
Table  5-11 presents the calculated benefits under Option A from removing the opt-out provision for 
children under the age of six receiving childcare at an RCTH where LBP is disturbed during an RRP 
event.

5.2.5 Summary of Calculated Benefits  
Table  5-12 presents the Scenario 1 results and Table  5-13 presents the Scenario 2 results at 3 percent and 
7 percent discount rates.  Table  5-14 shows both scenarios using a 3 percent discount rate, and Table  5-15 
shows similar information using a 7 percent discount rate.   
The results do not include other populations that will benefit from the rule, such as individuals other than 
those in contiguous attached housing who live near a house renovated under the opt-out provision; or 
those who spend time in a friend’s or relative’s house renovated under the opt-out provision. 
The benefits calculations for children under the age of 6 are based on avoided losses in expected earnings 
due to IQ drop, and the calculations for adults are based on the avoided medical costs (or other proxies for 
willingness to pay) for hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and the resulting incidence of deaths.  
The quantified benefits to children do not include the avoided costs of other associated impacts of lead 
exposure such as aggression, attention deficit problems, hyperactivity, or other neurobehavioral impacts; 
additional education costs for special and remedial education; or medical costs to treat very high levels of 
lead.  Nor do any of the calculations include the benefits of renal effects, immune system effects, 
reproductive and developmental effects, or various other health effects that can be caused by lead 
exposure.  See Section  5.4 for a discussion of these health effects.

5.3 Benefits of Additional Recordkeeping Requirements 
In promulgating the 2008 LRRP rule, EPA recognized the importance of education and outreach to teach 
consumers about lead-safe work practices and to encourage them to hire certified renovation firms.  
EPA’s work on the education and outreach campaign for the LRRP program has continued to highlight 
the importance of an informed public to the success of the LRRP program in minimizing exposures to 
lead-based paint hazards that may be created by renovations.   
EPA has determined that if renovators are required to provide the owners and occupants of renovated 
buildings with copies of the records renovation firms must maintain to document compliance with the 
rule’s training and work practice requirements, it will serve to reinforce the information provided in 
EPA’s “Renovate Right” brochure on the potential hazards of renovations and on the LRRP requirements.  
These records will enable building owners and occupants to better understand what the renovation firm 
did to comply with the rule and how the rule’s provisions affected their specific renovation.  Educating 
the owners and occupants in this way is likely to help them to be better able to protect themselves from 
lead-based paint hazards that may have been created by the renovation and improve their ability to assist 
the EPA in monitoring compliance with the LRRP rule.  For example, the checklist may cause owners or 
occupants to question whether the containment used was sufficient, or whether cleaning verification was 
properly performed.  Tenants may raise their concerns with their landlord, and owners may discuss their 
concerns with the renovation firm before making final payment for the renovation.  These improvements 
in education and monitoring will improve compliance with the rule, which will ultimately protect children 
and adults from exposure to lead hazards due to renovation activities. 
5.4 Lead-Related Health Effects and Ecological Effects 
Lead exposure can cause many adverse health and ecological effects. This section supplements the 
benefits chapter by providing a broader, qualitative discussion of lead-related effects (including adult 
effects and ecological effects), based on EPA’s Air Quality Criteria for Lead.

5.4.1 Background 
The purpose of the 2006 Lead Air Quality Criteria document (AQCD) is to critically assess the latest 
scientific information on lead.  The final version of the revised Lead AQCD mainly assesses pertinent 
literature published or accepted for publication through December 2005.  
The First External Review Draft (dated December 2005) of the revised Lead AQCD underwent public 
comment and was reviewed by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) at a public 
meeting held in Durham, NC on February 28-March 1, 2006.  The public comments and CASAC 
recommendations received were taken into account in making appropriate revisions and incorporating 
them into a Second External Review Draft (dated May, 2006) which was released for further public 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-26    
comment and CASAC review at a public meeting held June 28-29, 2006.  In addition, still further revised 
drafts of the Integrative Synthesis chapter and the Executive Summary were then issued and discussed 
during an August 15, 2006 CASAC teleconference call.  Public comments and CASAC advice received 
on these latter materials, as well as Second External Review Draft materials, were taken into account in 
making and incorporating further revisions into this final version of the Lead AQCD.  
5.4.2 Health Effects Associated with Lead Exposure 
Both epidemiologic and toxicological studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead 
affect many different organ systems.  Research completed since the 1986 AQCD/Addendum and 1990 
Supplement indicates that lead effects occur at blood-lead levels even lower than those previously 
reported for many endpoints.  Remarkable progress has been made since the mid-1980s in understanding 
the Pb effects on health.  Recent studies have focused on details of the associations, including the shapes 
of concentration-response relationships, especially at levels well within the range of general population 
exposures, and on those biological and/or socio-environmental factors that either increase or decrease an 
individual’s risk.  Key findings and conclusions regarding important outcomes of newly available 
toxicological and epidemiologic studies of Pb health effects are highlighted below. 
5.4.2.1 Neurotoxic Effects   
• Neurobehavioral effects of Pb-exposure early in development (during fetal, neonatal, and later 
postnatal periods) in young infants and children (<7 years old) have been observed with 
remarkable consistency across numerous studies involving varying study designs, different 
developmental assessment protocols, and diverse populations.  Negative Pb impacts on 
neurocognitive ability and other neurobehavioral outcomes are robust in most recent studies even 
after adjustment for numerous potentially confounding factors (including quality of care giving, 
parental intelligence, and socioeconomic status).  These effects generally appear to persist into 
adolescence and young adulthood. 
• The overall weight of the available evidence provides clear substantiation of neurocognitive 
decrements being associated in young children with blood-Pb concentrations in the range of 5-10 
µg/dL, and possibly somewhat lower. Some newly available analyses appear to show Pb effects 
on the intellectual attainment of preschool and school age children at population mean concurrent 
blood-Pb levels ranging down to as low as 2 to 8 µg/dL. A decline of 6.2 points in full scale IQ 
for an increase in concurrent blood Pb levels from 1 to 10 µg/dL has been estimated, based on a 
pooled analysis of results derived from seven well-conducted prospective epidemiologic studies. 
• In the limited literature examining the effects of environmental Pb exposure on adults, mixed 
evidence exists regarding associations between Pb and neurocognitive performance.  No 
associations were observed between cognitive performance and blood Pb levels; however, 
significant associations were observed in relation to bone Pb concentrations, suggesting that long-
term cumulative Pb exposure may contribute to neurocognitive deficits in adults. 
• Animal toxicology data indicate that developmental Pb exposures creating steady-state blood-Pb 
concentrations of ~10 µg/dL result in behavioral impairments that persist into adulthood in rats 
and monkeys. No evident threshold has yet been found; and Pb-induced deficits, for the most 
part, have been found to be very persistent, even with various chelation treatments. However, 
experimental studies indicate that environmental enrichment during development can partially 
mitigate the effects of Pb on cognitive function. In rats, neurobehavioral deficits that persisted 
well into adulthood were observed with prenatal, preweaning, and postweaning Pb exposure. In 
monkeys, such neurobehavioral deficits were observed both with in utero-only exposure and with 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-27    
early postnatal-only exposure when peak blood-Pb levels did not exceed 15 µg/dL and steady-
state levels were ~11 µg/dL. 
• Learning impairment has been observed in animal studies at blood levels as low as 10 µg/dL, 
with higher level learning showing greater impairment than simple learning tasks. The 
mechanisms associated with these deficits include: response preservation; insensitivity to changes 
in reinforcement density or contingencies; deficits in attention; reduced ability to inhibit 
inappropriate responding; impulsivity; and distractibility. 
• Lead affects reactivity to the environment and social behavior in both rodents and nonhuman 
primates at blood Pb levels of 15 to 40 µg/dL. Rodent studies also show that Pb exposure 
potentiates the effects of stress in females. 
• Auditory function has also been shown to be impaired at blood Pb levels of 33 µg/dL, while 
visual functions are affected at 19 µg/dL. 
• Neurotoxicological studies in animals clearly demonstrated that Pb mimics calcium and affects 
neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. 
• Epidemiologic studies have identified genetic polymorphisms of two genes that may alter 
susceptibility to the neurodevelopmental consequences of Pb exposure in children. Variant alleles 
of the ALAD gene are associated with differences in absorption, retention, and toxicokinetics of 
Pb. Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor gene have been shown to affect the rate of 
resorption and excretion of Pb over time. These studies are only suggestive, and parallel animal 
studies have not been completed. 
5.4.2.2 Cardiovascular Effects  
• Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between Pb exposure and 
enhanced risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and 
incidence of hypertension. A meta-analysis of numerous studies estimates that a doubling of 
blood-Pb level (e.g., from 5 to 10 µg/dL) is associated with ~1.0 mm Hg increase in systolic 
blood pressure and ~0.6 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure. Studies have also found that 
cumulative past Pb exposure (e.g., bone Pb) may be as important, if not more, than present Pb 
exposure in assessing cardiovascular effects. The evidence for an association of Pb with 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is limited but supportive. 
• Experimental toxicology studies have confirmed Pb effects on cardiovascular functions.  Most 
have shown that exposures creating blood-Pb levels of ~20 to 30 µg/dL for long periods result in 
arterial hypertension that persists long after cessation of Pb exposure in genetically normal 
animals. One study reported blood pressure increases at blood-Pb levels as low as 2 µg/dL in rats. 
A number of in vivo and in vitro studies provide compelling evidence for the role of oxidative 
stress in the pathogenesis of Pb-induced hypertension.  However, experimental investigations of 
cardiovascular effects of Pb in animals are unclear as to why low, but not high, levels of Pb 
exposure cause hypertension in experimental animals. 
5.4.2.3 Renal Effects 
• In the general population, both circulating and cumulative Pb was found to be associated with 
longitudinal decline in renal function. Effects on creatine clearance have been reported in human 
adult hypertensives to be associated with general population mean blood-Pb levels of only 4.2 
µg/dL. The public health significance of such effects is not clear, however, in view of more 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-28    
serious signs of kidney dysfunction being seen in occupationally exposed workers only at much 
higher blood-Pb levels (>30-40 µg/dL). 
• Experimental studies using laboratory animals demonstrated that the initial accumulation of 
absorbed Pb occurs primarily in the kidneys. This takes place mainly through glomerular 
filtration and subsequent reabsorption, and, to a small extent, through direct absorption from the 
blood. Both low dose Pb-treated animals and high dose Pb-treated animals showed a 
“hyperfiltration” phenomenon during the first 3 months of Pb exposure. Investigations into 
biochemical alterations in Pb-induced renal toxicity suggested a role for oxidative stress and 
involvement of NO, with a significant increase in nitrotyrosine and substantial fall in urinary 
excretion of NOx. 
• Iron deficiency increases intestinal absorption of Pb and the Pb content of soft tissues and bone. 
Aluminum decreases kidney Pb content and serum creatinine in Pb-intoxicated animals. Age also 
has an effect on Pb retention. There is higher Pb retention at a very young age and lower bone and 
kidney Pb at old age, attributed in part to increased bone resorption and decreased bone accretion 
and, also, kidney Pb. 
5.4.2.4 Immune System Effects 
• Findings from recent epidemiologic studies suggest that Pb exposure may be associated with 
effects on cellular and humoral immunity. These include changes in serum immunoglobulin 
levels. Studies of biomarkers of humoral immunity in children have consistently found significant 
associations between increasing blood-Pb concentrations and serum IgE levels at blood-Pb levels 
<10 µg/dL. 
• Toxicologic studies have shown that Pb targets immune cells, causing suppression of delayed 
type hypersensitivity response, elevation of IgE, and modulation of macrophages into a hyper-
inflammatory phenotype. These types of changes can cause increased risk of atopy, asthma, and 
some forms of autoimmunity and reduced resistance to some infectious diseases. Lead exposure 
of embryos resulting in blood-Pb levels <10 µg/dL can produce persistent later-life 
immunotoxicity. 
5.4.2.5 Effects on Heme Synthesis 
• Lead exposure has been associated with disruption of heme synthesis in both children and adults. 
A 10% probability of anemia (hematocrit <35%) is estimated to be associated with a blood-Pb 
level of ~20 µg/dL at age 1 year. Increases in blood Pb concentration of about 20-30 µg/dL are 
sufficient to halve erythrocyte ALAD activity and sufficiently inhibit ferrochelatase to double 
erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels. 
• Toxicological studies demonstrated that Pb intoxication interferes with red blood cell (RBC) 
survival and alters RBC mobility. Hematological parameters, such as mean corpuscular volume, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, are also 
significantly decreased upon exposure to Pb. These effects are due to internalization of Pb by 
RBC. The transport of Pb across the RBC membrane is energy-independent and carrier-mediated; 
and the uptake of Pb appears to be mediated by an anion exchanger through a vanadate-sensitive 
pathway. 
• Erythrocyte ALAD activity ratio (ratio of activated/non activated enzyme activity) has been 
shown to be a sensitive, dose-responsive measure of Pb exposure, regardless of the mode of 
administration of Pb. Competitive enzyme kinetic analyses in RBCs from both humans and 
Cynomolgus monkeys indicated similar inhibition profiles by Pb. 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-29    
5.4.2.6 Effects on Bones and Teeth 
• Experimental studies in animals demonstrate that Pb substitutes for calcium and is readily taken 
up and stored in the bone and teeth of animals, potentially allowing bone cell function to be 
compromised both directly and indirectly by exposure.  Relatively short-term exposure of mature 
animals to Pb does not result in significant growth suppression. However, chronic Pb exposure 
during times of inadequate nutrition has been shown to adversely influence bone growth, 
including decreased bone density, decreased trabecular bone, and growth plates. 
• Exposure of developing animals to Pb during gestation and the immediate postnatal period has 
clearly been shown to significantly depress early bone growth in a dose-dependent fashion, 
though this effect is not manifest below a certain threshold. 
• Systemically, Pb has been shown to disrupt mineralization of bone during growth, to alter 
calcium binding proteins, and to increase calcium and phosphorus concentration in the blood 
stream, in addition to potentially altering bone cell differentiation and function by altering plasma 
levels of growth hormone and calciotropic hormones such as vitamin D3 [1,25- (OH2)D3. 
• Periods of extensive bone remodeling, such as occur during weight loss, advanced age, altered 
metabolic state, and pregnancy and lactation are all associated with mobilization of Pb stores 
from bone of animals. 
• Numerous epidemiologic studies and, separately, animal studies (both post-eruptive Pb exposure 
and pre- and perinatal Pb exposure studies) suggest that Pb is a caries-promoting element. 
However, whether Pb incorporation into the enamel surface compromises the integrity and 
resistance of the surface to dissolution, and ultimately increases risk of dental decay, is unclear. 
• Increased risk of dental caries has been associated with Pb exposure in children and adults. Lead 
effects on caries were observed in populations whose mean blood-Pb levels were less than 10 
µg/dL. 
5.4.2.7 Reproductive and Developmental Effects 
• Epidemiologic evidence suggests small associations between Pb exposure and male reproductive 
outcomes, including perturbed semen quality and increased time to pregnancy.  There are no 
adequate epidemiologic data to evaluate associations between Pb exposure and female fertility. 
Most studies have yielded no associations, or weak associations, of Pb exposure with thyroid 
hormone status and male reproductive endocrine status in highly exposed occupational 
populations. 
• New toxicologic studies support earlier conclusions, presented in the 1986 Lead AQCD, that (a) 
Pb can produce both temporary and persisting effects on male and female reproductive function 
and development and (b) Pb disrupts endocrine function at multiple points along the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Although there is evidence for a common mode of action, 
consistent effects on circulating testosterone levels are not always observed in Pb-exposed 
animals. Inconsistencies in reports of circulating testosterone levels complicate derivation of a 
dose-response relationship for this endpoint. 
• Lead-induced testicular damage (ultrastructural changes in testes of monkeys at blood-Pb >35 to 
40 µg/dL) and altered female sex hormone release, imprinting during early development, and 
altered female fertility all suggest Pb-induced reproductive effects. However, Pb exposure does 
not generally produce total sterility. Pre- and postnatal exposure to Pb has been demonstrated to 
result in fetal mortality and produce a variety of sublethal effects in the offspring. Many of the 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-30    
Pb-induced sublethal developmental effects occur at maternal blood-Pb levels that do not result in 
clinical (overt) toxicity in the mothers. Teratogenic effects resulting from Pb exposure reported in 
a few studies appear to be confounded by maternal toxicity. 
5.4.2.8 Effects on Other Organ Systems 
• Lead impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, elevating corticosterone levels and altering 
stress responsivity. This may be a potential mechanism contributing to Pb-induced hypertension, 
with further possible roles in the etiology of diabetes, obesity and other disorders.   
• Studies of hepatic enzyme levels in serum suggest that liver injury may be present in Pb workers; 
however, associations specifically with Pb exposures are not evident. Children exposed to 
relatively high levels of Pb (blood Pb >30 µg/dL) exhibit depressed levels of circulating 1,25-
dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-OH-D).  However, associations between serum vitamin D status and 
blood Pb were not evident in a study of calcium-replete children who had average lifetime blood-
Pb concentrations <25 µg/dL. 
• Field studies that evaluated hepatic enzyme levels in serum suggest that liver injury may be 
present in Pb workers; however, associations specifically with Pb exposures have not been well 
established. 
• Simultaneous induction of the activities of phase II drug metabolizing enzymes and decreased 
phase I enzymes with a single exposure to Pb nitrate in rat liver suggest that Pb is capable of 
causing biochemical phenotype similar to hepatic nodules. 
• Newer studies examined the induction of GST-P at both transcriptional and translational levels 
using in vitro systems and indicated a role for Pb-nitrate and Pb-acetate in the induction process.  
• Lead-induced alterations in cholesterol metabolism appear to be mediated by the induction of 
several enzymes related to cholesterol metabolism and the decrease of 7 α-hydroxylase, a 
cholesterol-catabolizing enzyme. This regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is modulated by 
changes in cytokine expression and related signaling. 
• Newer experimental evidence suggests that Pb-induced alterations in liver heme metabolism 
involve perturbations in ALAD activity, porphyrin metabolism, alterations in Transferrin gene 
expression, and associated changes in iron metabolism. 
• Gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of Pb is influenced by a variety of factors, including chemical 
and physical forms of the element in ingested media, age at intake, and various nutritional factors. 
The degeneration of intestinal mucosal epithelium leading to potential malabsorption and 
alterations in the jejunal ultrastructure (possibly associated with distortion of glycocalyx layer) 
have been reported in the intestine of Pb-exposed rats. 
• Nutritional studies that varied Pb, Ca, and vitamin D levels in the diet have demonstrated 
competition of Pb with Ca absorption. Supplementation with vitamin D has been reported to 
enhance intestinal absorption of Ca and Pb. Physiological amounts of vitamin D, when 
administered to vitamin D-deficient rats, resulted in elevated Pb and Ca levels.  In the case of 
severe Ca deficiency, Pb ingestion results in a marked decrease in serum 1,25 hydroxy vitamin D. 
5.4.2.9 Genotoxic and Carcinogenic Effects 
• Epidemiologic studies of highly exposed occupational populations suggest a relationship between 
Pb and cancers of the lung and the stomach; however the evidence is limited by the presence of 
various potential confounders, including metal coexposures (e.g., to arsenic, cadmium), smoking, 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-31    
and dietary habits. The 2003 NTP and 2004 IARC reviews concluded that Pb and Pb compounds 
were probable carcinogens, based on limited evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in 
animals. Similarly, Pb and Pb compounds would likely be classified as likely to be carcinogenic 
to humans according to the new 2005 EPA Cancer Assessment Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk 
Assessment, based on animal data even though the human data are inadequate. 
• Studies of genotoxicity consistently find associations of Pb exposure with DNA damage and 
micronuclei formation; however, the associations with the more established indicator of cancer 
risk, chromosomal aberrations, are inconsistent. 
• Pb is an animal carcinogen and extends our understanding of mechanisms involved to include a 
role for metallothionein. Specifically, the recent data show that metallothionein may participate in 
Pb inclusion bodies and, thus, serves to prevent or reduce Pb-induced tumorigenesis. 
• In vitro cell culture studies that evaluated the potential for Pb to transform rodent cells are 
inconsistent, and careful study of a time course of exposure is necessary to determine whether Pb 
actually induces transformation in cultured rodent cells. There is increased evidence suggesting 
that Pb may be co-carcinogenic or promotes the carcinogenicity of other compounds. Cell culture 
studies do support a possible epigenetic mechanism or co-mutagenic effects. 
5.4.2.10 Lead-Binding Proteins 
• Proteins depending upon sulfur-containing side chains for maintaining conformity or activity are 
vulnerable to inactivation by Pb, due to its strong sulfur-binding affinity. 
• The enzyme, ALAD, a 280 kDa protein, is inducible and is the major Pb-binding protein within 
the erythrocyte. 
• The Pb-binding protein in rat kidney has been identified as a cleavage product of α-2-
microglobulin. The low molecular weight Pb-binding proteins in human kidney have been 
identified as thymosin β 4 (molecular weight 5 kDa) and acyl-CoA binding protein (molecular 
weight 9 kDa). In human brain, Pb-binding proteins include thymosin β4 and an unidentified 
protein of 23 kDa.   
• Animal toxicology studies with metallothionein-null mice demonstrated a possible role for 
metallothionein as a renal Pb-binding protein. 
5.4.2.11 Human Population Groups At Special Risk And Potential Public Health Impacts 
• Children, in general and especially low SES (often including larger proportions of African-
American and Hispanic) children, have been well-documented as being at increased risk for Pb 
exposure and Pb-induced adverse health effects. This is due to several factors, including 
enhanced exposure to Pb via ingestion of soil-Pb and/or dust-Pb due to normal hand-to-mouth 
activity and/or pica. 
• Even children with low Pb exposure levels (having blood Pb of 5-10 µg/dL or, possibly, 
somewhat lower) are at notable risk, due to apparent non-linear dose-response relationships 
between blood Pb and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is hypothesized that initial 
neurodevelopmental lesions occurring at blood-Pb levels <10 µg/dL may disrupt different 
developmental processes in the nervous system than more severe high level exposures. 
• Adults with idiosyncratic exposures to Pb through occupations, hobbies, make-up use, glazed 
pottery, native medicines, and other sources are at risk for Pb toxicity. Certain ethnic and racial 
groups are known to have cultural practices that involve ingestion of Pb-containing substances, 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-32    
e.g., ingestion of foods or beverages stored in Pb-glazed pottery or imported canned food from 
countries that allow Pb-soldered cans. 
• Cumulative past Pb exposure, measured by bone Pb, may be a better predictor of cardiovascular 
effects than current blood-Pb levels. African-Americans are known to have substantially higher 
baseline blood pressure than other ethnic groups, so Pb’s impact on an already higher baseline 
could indicate a greater susceptibility to Pb for this group. 
• Effects on adults of low-level Pb exposures also include some renal effects (i.e., altered creatinine 
clearance) at blood-Pb levels <5 ug/dL. Lead exposure combined with other risk factors, such as 
diabetes, hypertension, or chronic renal insufficiency may result in clinically relevant effects in 
individuals with two or more other risk factors. 
• At least two genetic polymorphisms, of the ALAD and the vitamin D receptor gene, have been 
suggested to play a role in susceptibility to Pb. In one study, African-American children were 
found to have a higher incidence of being homozygous for alleles of the vitamin D receptor gene 
thought to contribute to greater Pb blood levels. This work is preliminary and further studies will 
be necessary to determine implications of genetic differences that may make certain populations 
more susceptible to Pb exposure. 
• What was considered “low” for Pb exposure levels in the 1980s is an order of magnitude higher 
than the current mean level in the U.S. population, and current average blood-Pb levels in U.S. 
populations remain perhaps as much as two orders of magnitude above preindustrial “natural” 
levels in humans. There is no level of Pb exposure that has yet been identified, with confidence, 
as being clearly not being associated with possible risk of deleterious health effects. Some recent 
studies of Pb neurotoxicity in infants have observed effects at population average blood-Pb levels 
of only 1 or 2 µg/dL; and some cardiovascular, renal, and immune outcomes have been reported 
at blood-Pb levels below 5 µg/dL. 
• Public health interventions have resulted in declines, over the last 25 years, of more than 90% in 
the mean blood-Pb level within all age and gender subgroups of the U.S. population, substantially 
decreasing the numbers of individuals at likely risk for Pb-induced toxicities. Nevertheless, 
estimates of the magnitude of potential public health impacts of Pb exposure can be substantial 
for the U.S. population. For example, in estimating the effect of Pb exposure on intelligence, it 
was projected that the fraction of individuals with an IQ >120 would decrease from ~9% with no 
Pb exposure to less than 3% at a blood-Pb level of 10 µg/dL. Also, the fraction of individuals 
with an IQ >130 points was estimated as being likely to decrease from 2.25% to 0.5% with a 
blood-Pb level change from 0 to 10 µg/dL.  In addition, an estimate of hypertension-related risk 
for serious cardiovascular events (coronary disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, cardiac 
failure) indicates that a decrease in blood Pb from 10 to 5 µg/dL could result in an annual 
decrease of 27 events per 100,000 women and 39 events per 100,000 men. 
5.4.3 Environmental Effects of Lead 
5.4.3.1 Terrestrial Ecosystems 
Methodologies Used in Terrestrial Ecosystem Research 
• Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques provide the greatest information on metal 
speciation. Other techniques, such as EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) and 
EXANES (extended X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), show great promise and will be 
important in solving key mechanistic questions. 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-33    
• In situ methodologies have been developed to lower soil-Pb relative bioavailability. These 
amendments typically fall within the categories of phosphate, biosolid, and Al/Fe/Mn-oxide 
amendments. Some of the drawbacks to soil amendment include phosphate toxicity to plants and 
increased arsenic mobility at high soil phosphate concentrations. The use of iron (III) phosphate 
seems to mitigate arsenic mobility, however increased concentrations of phosphate and iron limit 
their application when drinking water quality is a concern. 
Distribution of Atmospherically Delivered Lead in Terrestrial Ecosystems 
• Total Pb deposition during the 20th century has been estimated at 1 to 3 g Pb m-2, depending on 
elevation and proximity to urban areas. Total contemporary loadings to terrestrial ecosystems are 
~1 to 2 mg m-2 year-1. This is a relatively small annual flux of Pb compared to the reservoir of 
~0.5 to 4 g m-2 of gasoline additive-derived Pb already deposited in surface soils over much of the 
United States. 
• Dry deposition can account for 10% to >90% of total Pb deposition. Because Clean Air Act 
Legislation has preferentially reduced Pb associated with fine particles, relative contributions of 
dry deposition have changed in the last few decades. 
• Although inputs of Pb to ecosystems are currently low, Pb export from watersheds via 
groundwater and streams is substantially lower than inputs. Therefore, even at current input 
levels, watersheds are accumulating anthropogenic Pb. 
• Species of Pb delivered to terrestrial ecosystems can be inferred by emission source. For example, 
Pb species emitted from automobile exhaust are dominated by particulate Pb halides and double 
salts with ammonium halides (e.g., PbBrCl, PbBrCl2NH4Cl), while Pb emitted from smelters is 
dominated by Pb-sulfur species. Halides from automobile exhaust break down rapidly in the 
atmosphere, via redox reactions in the presence of atmospheric acids. Lead phases in the 
atmosphere, and presumably the compounds delivered to the surface of the earth (i.e., to 
vegetation and soils), are suspected to be in the form of PbSO4, PbS, and PbO. 
• The importance of humic and fulvic acids and hydrous Mn- and Fe-oxides for scavenging Pb in 
soils was discussed in some detail in the 1986 Lead AQCD. The importance of these Pb binding 
substrates is reinforced by studies reported in the more contemporary literature. 
• The amount of Pb that has leached into mineral soil appears to be on the order of 20 to 50% of the 
total anthropogenic Pb deposition. 
• The vertical distribution and mobility of atmospheric Pb in soils was poorly documented prior to 
1986. Techniques using radiogenic Pb isotopes have been developed to differentiate between 
gasoline-derived Pb and natural, geogenic (native) Pb. These techniques provide more accurate 
determinations of the depth-distribution and potential migration velocities for atmospherically 
delivered Pb in soils.  
• Selective chemical extractions have been used extensively over the past 20 years to quantify 
amounts of a particular metal phase in soil or sediment rather than total metal concentration. 
However, some problems persist with the selective extraction technique: (a) extractions are rarely 
specific to a single phase; and (b) in addition to the nonselectivity of reagents, significant metal 
redistribution has been found to occur during sequential chemical extractions. Thus, although 
chemical extractions provide some useful information on metal phases in soil or sediment, the 
results should be treated as “operationally defined,” e.g., “H2O2-liberated Pb” rather than “organic 
Pb.” 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-34    
• Soil solution dissolved organic matter content and pH typically have very strong positive and 
negative correlations, respectively, with the concentration of dissolved Pb species. 
Effects of Lead on Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems 
• Atmospheric Pb pollution has resulted in the accumulation of Pb in terrestrial ecosystems 
throughout the world. In the United States, anthropogenically-derived Pb represents a significant 
fraction of the total Pb burden in soils, even in sites remote from smelters and other industrial 
plants. However, few significant effects of Pb pollution have been observed at sites that are not 
near point sources of Pb. 
• Evidence from precipitation collection and sediment analyses indicates that atmospheric 
deposition of Pb has declined dramatically (>95%) at sites unaffected by point sources of Pb, and 
there is little evidence that Pb accumulated in soils at these sites represents a threat to ground 
water or surface water supplies. 
• The effects of Pb and other chemical emissions on terrestrial ecosystems near smelters and other 
industrial sites decrease downwind from the Pb source. Several studies using the soil burden as an 
indicator have shown that much of the contamination occurs within a radius of 20 to 50 km 
around the emission source. Elevated metal concentrations around smelters have been found to 
persist despite significant reductions in emissions. The concentrations of Pb in soils, vegetation, 
and fauna at these sites can be two to three orders of magnitude higher than in reference areas. 
Assessing the risks specifically associated with Pb is difficult, because these sites also experience 
elevated concentrations of other metals and because of effects related to SO2 emissions. The 
confounding effect of other pollutants makes the assessment of Pb-specific exposure-response 
relationships impossible at the whole ecosystem level. 
• In the most extreme cases, near smelter sites, the death of vegetation causes a near-complete 
collapse of the detrital food web, creating a terrestrial ecosystem in which energy and nutrient 
flows are minimal. 
• More commonly, stress in soil microorganisms and detritivores can cause reductions in the rate of 
decomposition of detrital organic matter. Although there is little evidence of significant 
bioaccumulation of Pb in natural terrestrial ecosystems, reductions in microbial and detritivorous 
populations can affect the success of their predators. Thus, at present, industrial point sources 
represent the greatest Pb-related threat to the maintenance of sustainable, healthy, diverse, and 
high-functioning terrestrial ecosystems in the United States. 
Terrestrial Species Response/Mode of Action 
• Plants take up Pb via their foliage and through their root systems. Surface deposition of Pb onto 
plants may represent a significant contribution to the total Pb in and on the plant, as has been 
observed for plants near smelters and along roadsides.  
• There are two possible mechanisms (symplastic or apoplastic) by which Pb may enter the root of 
a plant. The symplastic route is through the cell membranes of root hairs; this is the mechanism of 
uptake for water and nutrients. The apoplastic route is an extracellular route between epidermal 
cells into the intercellular spaces of the root cortex. The symplastic route is considered the 
primary mechanism of Pb uptake in plants. 
• Recent work supports previous conclusions that the form of metal tested, and its speciation in 
soil, influence uptake and toxicity to plants and invertebrates. The oxide form of Pb is less toxic 
than the chloride or acetate forms, which are less toxic that the nitrate form of Pb. However, these 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-35    
results must be interpreted with caution, as the counter ion (e.g., the nitrate ion) may also be 
contributing to the observed toxicity. 
• Lead may be detoxified in plants by deposition in root cell walls, and this may be influenced by 
calcium concentrations. Other hypotheses put forward recently include the presence of sulfur 
ligands and the sequestration of Pb in old leaves as detoxification mechanisms. Lead 
detoxification has not been studied extensively in invertebrates. Glutathione detoxification 
enzymes were measured in two species of spider. Lead may be stored in waste nodules in 
earthworms or as pyromorphite in the nematode. 
• Lead effects on heme synthesis (as measured primarily by ALAD activity and protoporphyrin 
concentration) were documented in the 1986 Lead AQCD and continue to be studied. However, 
researchers caution that changes in ALAD and other enzyme parameters are not always related to 
adverse effects, but may simply indicate exposure. Other effects on plasma enzymes, which may 
damage other organs, have been reported. Lead also may cause lipid peroxidation, which may be 
alleviated by vitamin E, although Pb poisoning may still result.  Changes in fatty acid production 
have been reported, which may influence immune response and bone formation.   
• Insectivorous mammals may be more exposed to Pb than herbivores, and higher trophic-level 
consumers may be less exposed than lower trophic-level organisms. Nutritionally deficient diets 
(including low calcium) cause increased uptake of Pb and greater toxicity in birds. 
• Interactions of Pb with other metals are inconsistent, depending on the endpoint measured, the 
tissue analyzed, the animal species, and the metal combination. 
Exposure/Response of Terrestrial Species 
• Recent critical advancements reported in the current Lead AQCD in understanding toxicity levels 
relies heavily on the work completed by a multi-stakeholder group, consisting of federal, state, 
consulting, industry, and academic participants, led by the EPA to develop Ecological Soil 
Screening Levels (Eco-SSLs). 
• Eco-SSLs are concentrations of contaminants in soils that would result in little or no measurable 
effect on ecological receptors. The Eco-SSLs are intentionally conservative in order to provide 
confidence that contaminants that could present an unacceptable risk are not screened out early in 
the evaluation process. That is, at or below these levels, adverse effects are considered unlikely. 
Due to conservative modeling assumptions (e.g., metal exists in most toxic form or highly 
bioavailable form, high food ingestion rate, high soil ingestion rate) that are common to screening 
processes, several Eco-SSLs are derived below the average background soil concentration for a 
particular contaminant. 
• The Eco-SSLs for terrestrial plants, birds, mammals, and soil invertebrates are 120, 11, 56, and 
1700 mg Pb/kg soil, respectively. 
5.4.3.2 Aquatic Ecosystems 
Methodologies Used in Aquatic Ecosystem Research 
• Many of the terrestrial methods can also be applied to suspended solids and sediments collected 
from aquatic ecosystems. Just as in the terrestrial environment, the speciation of Pb and other 
trace metals in natural freshwaters and seawater plays a crucial role in determining their 
reactivity, mobility, bioavailability, and toxicity. Many of the same speciation techniques 
employed for the speciation of Pb in terrestrial ecosystems are applicable in aquatic ecosystems. 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-36    
• There is now a better understanding of the potential effects of sampling, sample handling, and 
sample preparation on aqueous-phase metal speciation. Thus, a need has arisen for dynamic 
analytical techniques that are able to capture a metal's speciation, in-situ and in real time. 
• With few exceptions, ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) are derived based on data from 
aquatic toxicity studies conducted in the laboratory. In general, both acute (short term) and 
chronic (long term) AWQCs are developed. Depending on the species, the toxicity studies 
considered for developing acute criteria range in length from 48 to 96 hours. 
• Acceptable chronic toxicity studies should encompass the full life cycle of the test organism, 
although for fish, early life stage or partial life cycle toxicity studies are considered acceptable. 
Acceptable endpoints include reproduction, growth and development, and survival, with the 
effect levels expressed as the chronic value. 
• The biotic ligand model (BLM), which considers the binding of free metal ion to the site of toxic 
action and competition between metal species and other ions, has been developed to predict the 
toxicity of several metals under a variety of water quality conditions. However, there are 
limitations to this tool in deriving AWQC because, currently, limited work has been conducted in 
developing chronic BLMs (for any metals, let alone Pb) and the acute BLMs to date do not 
account for dietary metal exposures. 
Distribution of Lead in Aquatic Ecosystems 
• Atmospheric Pb is delivered to aquatic ecosystems primarily through deposition (wet and/or dry) 
or through erosional transport of soil particles. 
• A significant portion of Pb in the aquatic environment exists in the undissolved form (i.e., bound 
to suspended particulate matter). The ratio of Pb in suspended solids to Pb in filtrate varies from 
4:1 in rural streams to 27:1 in urban streams. 
• The oxidation potential of Pb is high in slightly acidic solutions, and Pb2+ binds with high affinity 
to sulfur-, oxygen-, and nitrogen-containing ligands. Therefore, speciation of Pb in the aquatic 
environment is controlled by many factors (e.g., pH, redox, dissolved organic carbon, sulfides). 
The primary form of Pb in aquatic environments is divalent (Pb2+), while Pb4+ exists only under 
extreme oxidizing conditions. Labile forms of Pb (e.g., Pb2+, PbOH+, PbCO3) are a significant 
portion of the Pb inputs to aquatic systems from atmospheric washout. Lead is typically present in 
acidic aquatic environments as PbSO4, PbCl4, ionic Pb, cationic forms of Pb-hydroxide, and 
ordinary Pb-hydroxide (Pb(OH)2). In alkaline waters, common species of Pb include anionic 
forms of Pb-carbonate (Pb(CO3)) and Pb(OH)2.  
• Lead concentrations in lakes and oceans were generally found to be much lower than those 
measured in the lotic waters assessed by NAWQA. In open waters of the North Atlantic the 
decline of Pb concentrations has been associated with the phasing out of leaded gasoline in North 
America and Western Europe. However, in estuarine systems, it appears that similar declines 
following the phase-out of leaded gasoline are not necessarily as rapid.  
• Based on a synthesis of NAWQA data from the United States, Pb concentrations in surface 
waters, sediments, and fish tissues (whole body) respectively range from: 0.04 to 30 µg/L (mean 
= 0.66, median = 0.50, 95th %tile = 1.1); 0.5 to 12,000 mg/kg (mean = 120, median = 28, 95th 
%tile = 200); and 0.08 to 23 mg/kg (mean = 1.03, median = 0.59, 95th %tile = 3.24). 
Effects of Lead on Natural Aquatic Ecosystems 
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-37    
• Lead exposure may adversely affect organisms at different levels of organization, i.e., individual 
organisms, populations, communities, or ecosystems. Generally, however, there is insufficient 
information available for single materials in controlled studies to permit evaluation of specific 
impacts on higher levels of organization (beyond the individual organism). Potential effects at the 
population level or higher are, of necessity, extrapolated from individual level studies. Available 
population, community, or ecosystem level studies are typically conducted at sites that have been 
contaminated or adversely affected by multiple stressors (several chemicals alone or combined 
with physical or biological stressors). Therefore, the best-documented links between Pb and 
effects on the environment are with effects on individual organisms. 
• Natural systems frequently contain multiple metals, making it difficult to attribute observed 
adverse effects to single metals. For example, macro invertebrate communities have been widely 
studied with respect to metals contamination and community composition and species richness. In 
these studies, multiple metals were evaluated and correlations between observed community level 
effects were ascertained. The results often indicate a correlation between the presence of one or 
more metals (or total metals) and the negative effects observed. While, correlation may imply a 
relationship between two variables, it does not imply causation of effects. 
• In simulated microcosms or natural systems, environmental exposure to Pb in water and sediment 
has been shown to affect energy flow and nutrient cycling and benthic community structure.  
• In field studies, Pb contamination has been shown to significantly alter the aquatic environment 
through bioaccumulation and alterations of community structure and function.   
• Exposure to Pb in laboratory studies and simulated ecosystems may alter species competitive 
behaviors, predator-prey interactions, and contaminant avoidance behaviors. Alteration of these 
interactions may have negative effects on species abundance and community structure.  
• In natural aquatic ecosystems, Pb is often found coexisting with other metals and other stressors. 
Thus, understanding the effects of Pb in natural systems is challenging given that observed effects 
may be due to cumulative toxicity from multiple stressors. 
Aquatic Species Response/Mode of Action 
• Recent research has suggested that due to the low solubility of Pb in water, dietary Pb (i.e., Pb 
adsorbed to sediment, particulate matter, and food) may contribute substantially to exposure and 
toxicity in aquatic biota.   
• Generally speaking, aquatic organisms exhibit three Pb accumulation strategies: (1) accumulation 
of significant Pb concentrations with a low rate of loss, (2) excretion of Pb roughly in balance 
with availability of metal in the environment, and (3) weak net accumulation due to very low 
metal uptake rate and no significant excretion.  
• Protists and plants produce intracellular polypeptides that form complexes with Pb.  Macrophytes 
and wetland plants that thrive in Pb-contaminated regions have developed translocation strategies 
for tolerance and detoxification. 
• Like aquatic plants and protists, aquatic animals detoxify Pb by preventing it from being 
metabolically available, though their mechanisms for doing so vary. Invertebrates use lysosomal-
vacuolar systems to sequester and process Pb within glandular cells. They also accumulate Pb as 
deposits on and within skeletal tissue, and some can efficiently excrete Pb. Fish scales and 
mucous chelate Pb in the water column, and potentially reduce visceral exposure.   
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-38    
• Numerous studies have reported the effects of Pb exposure on blood chemistry in aquatic biota. 
Plasma cholesterol, blood serum protein, albumin, and globulin concentrations were identified as 
bioindicators of Pb stress in fish. 
• Nutrients affect Pb toxicity in aquatic organisms. Some nutrients seem capable of reducing 
toxicity. Exposure to Pb has not been shown to reduce nutrient uptake ability, though it has been 
demonstrated that Pb exposure may lead to increased production and loss of organic material 
(e.g., mucus and other complex organic ligands). 
• Avoidance responses are actions performed to evade a perceived threat. Some aquatic organisms 
have been shown to be quite adept at avoiding Pb in aquatic systems, while others seem incapable 
of detecting its presence. 
• The two most commonly reported Pb-element interactions are between Pb and calcium and 
between Pb and zinc. Both calcium and zinc are essential elements in organisms and the 
interaction of Pb with these ions can lead to adverse effects both by increased Pb uptake and by a 
decrease in Ca and Zn required for normal metabolic functions. 
Exposure/Response of Aquatic Species 
• The 1986 Lead AQCD reviewed data in the context of sublethal effects of Pb exposure. The 
document focused on describing the types and ranges of Pb exposures in ecosystems likely to 
adversely impact domestic animals. As such, the 1986 AQCD did not provide a comprehensive 
analysis of the effects of Pb to most aquatic primary producers, consumers, and decomposers. 
• Waterborne Pb is highly toxic to aquatic organisms, with toxicity varying with the species and 
life stage tested, duration of exposure, form of Pb tested, and water quality characteristics. 
• Among the species tested, aquatic invertebrates, such as amphipods and water fleas, were the 
most sensitive to the effects of Pb, with adverse effects being reported at concentrations as low as 
0.45 µg/L (range: 0.45 to 8000 µg/L).   
• Freshwater fish demonstrated adverse effects at concentrations ranging from 10 to >5400 µg/L, 
depending generally upon water quality parameters. 
• Amphibians tend to be relatively Pb tolerant; however, they may exhibit decreased enzyme 
activity (e.g., ALAD reduction) and changes in behavior (e.g., hypoxia response behavior). 
5.4.3.3 Critical Loads for Lead in Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems 
• Critical loads are defined as threshold deposition rates of air pollutants that current knowledge 
indicates will not cause long-term adverse effects to ecosystem structure and function. A critical 
load is related to an ecosystem's sensitivity to anthropogenic inputs of a specific chemical. 
• The critical loads approach for sensitive ecosystems from acidification has been in use throughout 
Europe for about 20 years. Its application to Pb and other heavy metals in Europe is more recent. 
European critical load values for Pb have been developed but are highly specific to the bedrock 
geology, soil types, vegetation, and historical deposition trends in each European country. To 
date, the critical loads framework has not been used for regulatory purposes in the United States 
for any chemical. Considerable research is necessary before critical load estimates can be 
formulated for ecosystems extant in the United States. 
• Speciation strongly influences the toxicity of Pb in soil and water and partitioning between 
dissolved and solid phases determines the concentration of Pb in soil drainage water, but it has 
not been taken into account in most of the critical load calculations for Pb performed to date.  
 Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 5-39    
• Runoff of Pb from soil may be the major source of Pb into aquatic systems. However, little 
attempt has been made to include this source into critical load calculations for aquatic systems 
due to the complexity of including this source in the critical load models. 
In summary, due to the deposition of Pb from past practices (e.g., leaded gasoline, ore smelting) and the 
long residence time of Pb in many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, a legacy of environmental Pb 
burden exists, over which is superimposed much lower contemporary Pb loadings. The potential for 
ecological effects of the combined legacy and contemporary Pb burden to occur is a function of the 
bioavailability or bioaccessibility of the Pb, which, in turn, is highly dependent upon numerous site 
factors (e.g., soil organic carbon content, pH, water hardness). Moreover, while the more localized 
ecosystem impacts observed around smelters are often striking, these perturbations cannot be attributed 
solely to Pb. Many other stressors (e.g., other heavy metals, oxides of sulfur and nitrogen) can also act 
singly or in concert with Pb to cause such notable environmental impacts.

6. Estimated Impacts of the Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting
Rule Revisions
In addition to the cost and benefit analyses presented in Chapters 4 and 5, several other types of impacts
are important to consider in evaluating the effects of a regulation. This chapter presents the incremental
impact of the proposed revisions to the Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (LRRP) Rule on:
 paperwork burden,
 the financial condition of small entities,
 whether the regulation has a disproportionate effect on low-income and or minority persons,
 the environmental health risk or safety risk to children due to the regulation,
 State, local, and Tribal governments, and the private sector,
 federalism,
 the relationship between the Federal government and the Indian tribes, or on the distribution of
power and responsibilities between the Federal government and Indian tribes,
 energy effects, and
 whether voluntary consensus standards are used in its regulatory activities.
The demand for certified firms and renovators is predicted to increase as a result of the elimination of the
opt-out provision, and therefore more firms and renovators are expected to seek certification and training
as a result of the revisions. Separate impacts are estimated for these firms and individuals that are not
projected to have sought certification and training without the elimination of the opt-out provision.
Hereafter these entities are referred to as “opt-out entities.” Likewise, those firms and individuals that
were estimated to have sought certification and training without the elimination of the opt-out provision
are referred to as “currently regulated entities.” The impacts of the proposed revisions to the rule on the
opt-out entities include all the costs associated with the requirements of the revised LRRP rule. In
contrast, the only impacts of the proposed rule on the currently regulated entities are those associated with
the proposed recordkeeping checklist requirement.
6.1 Paperwork Reduction Act
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (superseding the PRA of 1980), as implemented by the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), requires that agencies submit a supporting statement to OMB
for any information collection that solicits the same data from more than nine parties. The PRA seeks to
ensure that Federal agencies balance their need to collect information with the paperwork burden imposed
on the public by the collection.
The definition of “information collection” includes activities required by regulations such as permit
development, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. The term “burden” refers to the “time, effort, or
financial resources” the public expends to provide information to or for a Federal agency, or to otherwise
fulfill statutory or regulatory requirements. PRA paperwork burden is measured in terms of annual time
and financial resources the public devotes to meet one-time and recurring information requests (44 U.S.C.
3502(2); 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(b)).
Information collection activities may include:
 reviewing rule requirements;
 using technology to collect, process, and disclose information;
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-2
 adjusting existing practices to comply with requirements;
 searching data sources;
 completing and reviewing the response; and
 transmitting or disclosing information.
Agencies must provide information to OMB on the parties affected, the annual reporting burden, and the
annualized cost of responding to the information collection.
6.1.1 RRP Entity Paperwork Burden
6.1.1.1 Certification and Recordkeeping
LRRP contractors performing regulated RRP work are estimated to spend approximately half an hour to
fill out and mail the Application for Renovator Certification when they are applying for initial
certification or re-certification (which occurs every five years). It is estimated that these entities will
spend an average of three hours to familiarize themselves with the RRP rule’s requirements when
becoming certified. Entities performing RRP tasks on target housing units will spend, on average, about
five hours annually for recordkeeping tasks. These activities add up to an average burden in the first year
of 7.8 hours per contractor. At a loaded wage rate of $31.64, the paperwork cost in the first year will
average $263 per firm (See Table 6-1). Additional costs are minor; these costs include an application
printout, one photocopy for personal records, an envelope, and a stamp. The total first year information
collection cost is estimated to average $263 per contractor. Every five years entities must complete the
certification form to apply for re-certification as well as keep records that demonstrate compliance with
the RRP Rule. The total time required during a re-certification year is 5.3 hours at a cost of $168 per
contractor. In years when entities do not need to apply for certification or re-certification, contractors will
only incur the five-hour recordkeeping burden at a cost of $152.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-3
6.1.1.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Provision Requirements
The proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule would require all renovation firms to provide a copy of the
records demonstrating compliance with the training and work practice requirements of the RRP rule to the
owner and, if different, the occupant of the building being renovated or the operator of the child-occupied
facility. Specifically, renovation firms would have to provide this information to owners and occupants in
a short, easily-read checklist or other form within thirty days of the completion of work. If optional dust
clearance is performed in lieu of cleaning verification, the renovation firm must provide a copy of the dust
wipe sampling report(s) to the owner of the building that was renovated as well as to the occupants, if
different. For renovations occurring in common areas of target housing or child-occupied facilities, the
renovation firm can post instructions to tenants on how to obtain this information.
6.1.1.3 Recordkeeping Checklist Provision Unit Costs
Labor Costs
Under a separate requirement of the 2008 LRRP rule, renovation firms must complete and retain a copy
of the checklist for enforcement purposes. Therefore, renovation firms would only incur the incremental
labor costs of photocopying and distributing the checklist as a result of the additional recordkeeping
checklist provision requirement. EPA assumed this burden to be three minutes at a loaded wage rate of
$31.64 per hour.
Material Costs
The recordkeeping checklist provision would require renovation firms to supply a copy of the checklist to
the owner of the affected building, or if different, the occupant of the affected target housing unit or
operator of the child-occupied facility, and to post the checklist in a common area. Therefore, renovation
firms performing work in target housing or public and commercial buildings would incur an incremental
cost of eight cents per page to photocopy materials.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-4
Option A, the entire stock of firms necessary to meet demand, including those working in target housing
and public or commercial building COFs, would incur recordkeeping checklist costs starting in the first
year. Firms performing work in owner-occupied target housing would be required to distribute one copy
of the checklist while firms performing work in renter-occupied target housing would be required to
provide copies to the owner and occupant. If the work occurs in the common area of an apartment
building, the checklist, or information on how to obtain the checklist, can be posted on a sign in the
common area.
The recordkeeping checklist provision also applies to firms performing work in public or commercial
building COFs. Child-occupied facilities that perform work with their own staff must post the checklist,
or information on how to obtain the checklist, on a sign that is accessible to parents or guardians of the
children. Similarly, landlords who perform work with their own staff would have to supply one copy of
the checklist attached to a sign in the area where the work is being performed. Contractors who perform
work in owner-occupied COFs must provide two copies of the checklist: one copy to the operator of the
COF and one copy to be posted on a sign in the COF. In addition to the two copies required in owner-
occupied events, contractors working in renter-occupied COFs must also provide the owner of the
building with a third copy of the checklist.
Table 6-3 presents the number of events affected by the proposed checklist provision in the first and
second years of the proposed revisions’ implementation by event type under Option A.
6.1.2 Training Provider Paperwork Burden
EPA has also estimated the information collection burden imposed on Training Providers. No Training
Providers are estimated to become accredited as a result of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule;
therefore, they would not incur an incremental paperwork burden of accreditation and re-accreditation.
However, since the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision implies an increase in training course
demand, it is estimated that training providers would incur an incremental paperwork burden related to
course notification. To comply with the 2008 LRRP rule, Training Providers must keep records on both
the courses they provide and the students they train. In addition, they must notify EPA before offering
each course (to facilitate EPA’s enforcement activities) and after each course (so EPA has a record of the
individuals who have completed the course).

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-5
6.1.2.1 Burden Associated with Notification Requirements
It is assumed that the pre-notification for each class requires an average of 0.15 hours and that each post-
notification requires 1.54 hours. The post notifications are more time consuming because the Training
Provider must send records pertaining to each student who attended the course. Approximately 12
percent of courses will also require a re-notification, which is also estimated to take 0.15 hours. These
activities add up to an average of 1.7 clerical hours per course. The number of courses offered per year
depends on the number of individuals who need to be trained. As the proposed revisions to the 2008
LRRP rule would eliminate the opt-out provision, more renovators are predicted to seek training. It is
assumed that under Option A, Training Providers would offer an extra 30 courses in the first year, or a
total of 90 hours, for the added renovator demand. It is assumed that each notification requires one
photocopy, one envelope, and one stamp; thus approximately two of each of these items are required per
course. Under Option A, the incremental cost of notifications in the first year is approximately $2,772 per
Training Provider. There would be approximately 6 extra courses offered per Training Provider in the
second and third years, with a notification cost of about $550 per year.
6.1.2.2 Total Burden and Cost per Training Provider
As shown in Table 6-4, accredited training providers would incur an incremental $2,772 of paperwork
costs in the first year due to added demand resulting from the proposed elimination of the opt-out
provision under Option A.

6.1.3 Total Paperwork Burden on RRP Firms and Training Providers
Table 6-5 presents the total paperwork burden incurred by all RRP firms and training providers in the first
and second years of the proposed revisions’ implementation. For training providers, total notification
burden was estimated by multiplying the per-entity burden estimates in Table 6-4 by the number of
training providers in each year. For RRP firms, total certification and recordkeeping burden was
estimated by multiplying the per firm burden estimates in Table 6-1 by the number of firms undergoing
certification or re-certification, or not becoming certified in each year. For checklist costs, the number of
events per firm was first estimated by dividing the events shown in Table 6-3 by the total number of firms
complying with the checklist provision in each year. Second, this number was multiplied by the
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-6
estimated checklist labor burden of three minutes (0.05 hours) to produce hours per RRP firm. Finally,
this number was multiplied by the total number of firms, yielding the total checklist burden.

6.2 Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996, requires regulators to assess the effects of regulations on small entities
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-7
including businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments. In some instances, agencies are also
required to examine regulatory alternatives that may reduce adverse economic effects on significantly
impacted small entities. The RFA requires agencies to prepare an initial and final regulatory flexibility
analysis for each rule unless the Agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The RFA, however, does not specifically define “a significant
economic impact on a substantial number” of small entities. Sections 603 and 604 of the RFA require
that regulatory flexibility analyses identify the types and estimate the numbers of small entities to which
the rule will apply. It also requires a description of the rule requirements to which small entities will be
subject and any regulatory alternatives, including exemptions and deferral, which would lessen the rule’s
burden on small entities.
The 2008 LRRP Rule requires that all entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for
compensation in target housing or public and commercial buildings with COFs become certified by EPA,
ensure that their employees are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices
when disturbing lead-based paint, other than events that qualify for the minor maintenance exception.
This analysis considers the incremental impacts of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule on small
entities in the affected construction, real estate, and child-occupied facility industry sectors. The
proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule eliminates the opt-out provision for entities performing work in
owner-occupied target housing units that are not COFs and where no child under the age of 6 or pregnant
woman resides. It is predicted that this revision would result in additional firms and renovators seeking
certification and training. Therefore, only those small entities that would not have otherwise obtained
certification (“opt-out entities”) would incur certification, training, work practice, and cleaning
verification costs under the proposed revisions.
In addition, the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule include a new recordkeeping checklist
provision requirement. The checklist provision requires that renovation firms working in target housing
provide the owner and, if a rental unit, the occupant with a copy of the RRP compliance checklist. Firms
working in public or commercial building COFs must provide the owner and, if necessary, the operator of
the COF with a copy of the checklist, as well as post the compliance information in a location visible to
parents or guardians. The requirements of the checklist provision apply both to firms affected by the
2008 LRRP rule and to firms that would be affected by the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision.
Therefore, the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule affect small entities that provide childcare for
compensation including private sector firms (e.g. daycare centers and family daycare); small governments
(particularly school districts) and non-profit organizations; small construction-related contracting firms
that provide RRP services to residences or public or commercial buildings containing COFs; and property
managers and lessors who lease space to COFs and use their own staff to conduct RRP work in their
buildings.
The impacts on training providers are not analyzed because the rule will result in an increased demand for
their services. Therefore training providers will incur positive rather than negative impacts. Although the
rule may also result in additional costs for training providers (i.e. costs of additional recordkeeping and
submitting notifications), training providers are expected to recoup these costs via tuition fees. These
tuition fees are accounted for elsewhere in the analysis in the estimation of training costs that are incurred
by the other entities subject to the rule.
6.2.1 Definitions of Small Entity
The Regulatory Flexibility Act defines a small government as a government of a city, county, town,
school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000. A small non-profit organization is
defined as any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-8
in its field. The RFA relies on the definition of a “small business” found in the Small Business Act,
which authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to develop definitions for “small business.”
For this analysis, EPA uses SBA’s definition of a small business for each industry.
For many industry sectors, the SBA definition of a small business is based on revenues, where revenue
standards vary by industry. In establishing revenue standards, SBA considers a number of economic and
market characteristics that may allow a firm to exercise dominance in an industry. These standards
represent the maximum revenue that a for-profit enterprise may have and still qualify as a small business.
The twelve NAICS codes listed in Table 6-6 are the general and specialty contractors this rule will likely
impact. Their respective SBA thresholds are also listed. The twelve NAICS codes are followed with two
NAICS codes for residential real estate industries, two NAICS codes for nonresidential real estate
industries, and one NAICS code for child day care services that are also likely to be affected by the rule.

The RFA classifies small entities as small businesses, small non-profit organizations, or small
governments. Property managers and lessors, and construction-related contractors, are all assumed to be
for profit operations. All daycare providers operating in individual homes (frequently referred to as
family daycare) are assumed to be for-profit operations. Daycare centers can be operated by for-profit or
non-profit organizations. Kindergartens and pre-kindergartens refer to facilities in either public schools
(governmental) or in private schools (assumed to be non-profits). These classifications are summarized in
the following table.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-9
6.2.2 General Assumptions and Approach
This analysis measures the potential incremental impacts of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP
Rule on small businesses in terms of annual compliance costs as a percentage of annual revenues, referred
to as the cost impact ratio.1 This approach is based on the premise that the cost impact percentage is an
appropriate measure of an entity’s ability to afford the costs attributable to a regulatory change. For
purposes of determining small entity impacts, comparing annual compliance costs to annual revenues
provides a reasonable indication of the magnitude of the regulatory burden relative to a commonly
available and objective measure of a company’s business volume. Where regulatory costs represent a
very small fraction of a typical establishment’s revenue, the impacts of a regulation are likely to be
minimal.
This analysis considers eight different groups of entities: public school districts, private schools, daycare
centers, family daycare, construction contractors (residential and non-residential), and property lessors
and managers (residential and non-residential). The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the incremental
impacts of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP Rule on small entities in a typical year. In order to
develop a realistic portrayal of the long-term effects of the rule on small entities, annualized costs of the
rule, rather than first-year costs, are used to measure its impacts. Furthermore, when presenting the
number of businesses affected, the analysis presents the annual average number of businesses, rather than
first or second year estimates of affected businesses.
The SBA size standards are measured at the firm or parent company level. Conceptually, the small entity
analysis would also be conducted at that level. Due to data limitations, this small entity analysis is
conducted at the establishment level rather than at the firm or parent company level for most sectors.
Census information was available primarily at the establishment level, making a firm or parent company
analysis unfeasible. The only sectors where firm-level data are used are non-residential managers and
lessors, and public schools. Because establishments, and not organizations, are analyzed, an assumption
is made that none of the small establishments are subsidiaries of larger organizations. This assumption
leads to an overestimate of the number of small independent establishments affected by the rule.
Furthermore, since organization-level revenues of multi-establishment businesses are higher than
establishment revenues, the use of establishment data may result in higher cost-impact ratios than actually
exist.
The cost-impact ratios estimated for the residential and non-residential real estate industries (NAICS
531110, 531311, 531120, 531312) in this small entity analysis are based on employment and revenue data
1 For private schools, where adequate revenue data were not available, costs are compared to annual expenditures.

for employer establishments only. It is assumed that the majority of non-residential property lessors and
managers are businesses with employees. Further, the analysis assumes that a self-employed lessor or
manager is likely to hire a contractor to perform work on his property, particularly in a non-residential
building.
6.2.2.1 Costs Incurred by Small Establishments
This small entity analysis evaluates the incremental impacts of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP
rule on small entities under Option A, as it has the highest cost impact implications (see Section 4.1 for
option definitions). To estimate the costs incurred by the small entities subject to the requirements of the
rule, this analysis calculates the number of people trained, certifications sought, and events performed by
each of the small entities in a typical year under Option A. As explained at the beginning of this section,
only opt-out contractors would incur incremental costs for certification, training, work practices, and
cleaning verification under the proposed revisions. However, all entities, currently regulated and opt-out,
would incur recordkeeping checklist provision costs. Therefore, the following sections present costs for
currently regulated and opt-out entities separately.
Average Annualized Unit Cost Estimates
Unit training costs were calculated by annualizing the total 50-year costs of training renovators and
workers performing RRP projects in opt-out housing under Option A, then dividing this total by the
average annual number of renovators and workers trained by these establishments. Similarly, the
annualized total costs of maintaining certification, complying with work practice standards, and
disseminating the checklist under Option A were divided by the average annual number of firms certified,
and events, respectively. This single set of average annualized unit costs was used to calculate total costs
to small entities working in opt-out housing. Annualized unit checklist costs for entities currently
regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule were similarly calculated. The use of annual numbers of firms,
individuals, and events in calculating average annualized costs takes into account the fact that the pre-
1978 housing and building stock is expected to decrease by 0.41 percent per year due to demolition of a
portion of the building stock.
The numbers of events, individuals, and firms were averaged over the 50 years covered in this analysis
using the following formula:
Annual Average =
Where:
A1 = First year number of events, individuals or firms
A2 = Second year number of events, individuals or firms
r = (1 – 0.41% demolition rate), or 0.9959

6.2.3 Residential Contractors and Real Estate Industries
Establishments that perform RRP work in opt-out housing will incur the costs of training and
certification, as well as the cost of using lead-safe work practices during projects that disturb lead-based
paint. In order to distribute the total costs of the rule between small and large establishments, EPA
assumed that the compliance cost incurred by each establishment is a function of the number of regulated
renovation events that the establishment performs in a typical year. For each of eleven residential
contractor NAICS groups and two residential real estate NAICS groups, EPA calculated the average
annualized numbers of small opt-out entities seeking certification, workers being trained by small opt-out
entities, and events being performed by small opt-out entities. These averages were calculated separately
for non-employer and employer firms. Using the average annualized unit costs, EPA calculated the
average annualized total costs to small opt-out entities affected by the proposed revisions. The use of
annualized costs provides a more accurate representation of the long-term (typical year) impacts of the
rule than would be provided by first or second year costs.
The following six steps were used to calculate the cost-impact ratios for the target housing contractor and
residential real estate industries. To estimate the impacts of the proposed revisions on small opt-out
entities in the affected industries, the following calculations were performed for each NAICS industry:
Step 1: Certified establishments were classified as either small or large businesses depending on their
revenues. Self-employed contractors were considered separately from small employer establishments,
and therefore there are two small business categories for each residential contractor NAICS group.
Step 2: Census data were used to characterize a “typical” small establishment (in terms of revenues and
number of employees) in each of the affected industry sectors.
Step 3: The average number of regulated events performed by an establishment each year was estimated
by multiplying the ratio of regulated events to trained personnel by the establishment employment size.
Step 4: An average work practice compliance cost per event2, certification cost per firm, training cost per
renovator, certification per worker, and checklist cost per event were calculated for Option A using the
2 The work practice cost per event includes the cost to landlords and contractors of complying with the pre-
renovation education regulations.

total annualized 50-year costs to entities working in owner-occupied, opt-out target housing and the
incremental 50-year average number of renovation events, renovators/workers trained, and firms certified
as a result of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule. For currently regulated entities, numbers
were only generated for checklist costs.
Step 5: For opt-out entities (i.e., those working in housing previously eligible for the opt-out provision),
total establishment compliance costs were calculated by multiplying the number of events performed, the
number of renovators trained, and the number of firms becoming certified by the corresponding average
annualized cost under Option A. For currently regulated entities, numbers were only generated for
checklist costs.
Step 6: Cost-impact ratios were calculated for a typical small establishment in each industry sector by
dividing the total compliance costs incurred by the establishment (Step 5) by the establishment’s revenues
(Step 2). These cost impact ratios were calculated both for non-employer and small employer NAICS
groups separately and combined.
6.2.3.1 Number of Small Residential Contractors and Real Estate Entities Affected by the
Proposed Revisions
The data used in this analysis were drawn primarily from the 2002 U.S. Economic Census. As discussed
in Chapter 2, Census data were used to estimate the number of non-employer establishments (self-
employed contractors) in the affected construction industries. The 2002 Census also provides data on the
number, revenue and employment of establishments with payroll by revenue bracket for each of the
eleven construction industry sectors affected by the rule. In Chapter 2, these data were used to classify
construction establishments into two main size classes – establishments with annual revenues of less than
$10 million, and establishments with annual revenues of $10 million or more. The percent of
establishments, employees, net value of construction and total value of business contributed by
establishments in each revenue bracket can be found in Chapter 2.
Because 2002 Census data on the number of establishments by revenue bracket was not available at the
time the estimates were developed, 1997 Census data was used to estimate the percent of establishments
in each industry that qualify for small business status. These percentages, as well as the percent of
industry revenues and employment contributed by small and large establishments, are presented in
Chapter 2.
The Small Business Administration revenue thresholds for establishments in the construction sectors are
currently set at $33.5 million for Residential Remodelers and at $14 million for the ten specialty
contractor industries. However, in applying the U.S. Economic Census data to the SBA definition of
small business, it is not possible to estimate the exact number of construction establishments that have
revenues below the SBA threshold because the U.S. Economic Census groups all establishments with
revenues of $10 million or more into one revenue bracket. Applying the U.S. Economic Census data
therefore requires either under or overestimating the number of small businesses affected by the rule. On
the one hand, using data for the entire industry would overestimate the number of small businesses
affected by the rule. It would also underestimate the rule’s impact on small businesses because the
impacts would be calculated using the revenues of large businesses in addition to small businesses. On
the other hand, applying the closest, albeit lower, revenue bracket would underestimate the number of
small businesses affected by the rule while at the same time overestimating the impacts. For example,
because the $10 million cut-off is below the SBA threshold for the Residential Remodeler industry, using
the U.S. Economic Census data may lead to an underestimate of the number of small businesses in this
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-13
sector, although likely a small underestimate.3 At the same time, using these data may lead to a slight
overestimate of the impacts of the rule, as the average revenues of small businesses will appear smaller
when larger establishments (those with revenues of $10 to $33.5 million) are left out. See Section 6.2.2
for a discussion of assumptions that may result in an overestimation of the number of affected small
businesses. Moreover, using data on all businesses regardless of size would defeat the purpose of
estimating impacts on small business. EPA has chosen to be more conservative in estimating the cost
impacts of the rule on small businesses by using the $10 million threshold for construction industry
sectors.
As with the Residential Remodelers and the ten specialty contractor industries discussed above, it is not
possible to estimate the exact number of small Residential Property Manager establishments or Lessor of
Residential Buildings and Dwellings establishments because Census-defined revenue brackets group
establishments with revenues of $1 million to $5 million and $5 million to $10 million, respectively. For
the same reasons set forth above (the Agency had the choice to either overestimate or underestimate the
impacts), the Agency has chosen to overestimate the impacts. Thus, EPA has applied the U.S. Economic
Census data for establishments with revenues of less than $1 million to Residential Property Managers,
and the U.S. Census Economic data for establishments with revenues of less than $5 million to Lessor of
Residential Buildings.4
In order to estimate the number of certified small establishments with paid employees, EPA assumed that
the number of certified small employers is proportional to the total number of small employer
establishments in the industry. The total number of certified establishments in each industry (calculated
in Chapter 4) was multiplied by the percentage of establishments in that industry with revenues below the
revenue thresholds described above. For the eleven residential construction industry sectors, the resulting
number of small employer establishments was added to the total number of certified self-employed
contractors to obtain the total number of small certified establishments.
Table 6-9 shows the 50-year average number of small businesses affected by the proposed revisions. The
number of affected businesses is predicted to decrease proportionally to the number of regulated events,
which in turn decline at an annual rate of 0.41 percent (see Chapter 4 for discussion).
3 Because 99.7 percent of Residential Remodeler establishments earn less than $10 million per year, any
underestimate of the number of establishments is likely to be minimal.
4 Approximately 85 percent of Residential Property Manager establishments earn less than $1 million per year, and
about 99 percent of Lessor of Residential Buildings and Dwellings establishments earn less than $5 million per year.

6.2.3.2 Training and Certification Costs – Residential Contractors
Number of Firms Certified and Individuals Trained – Residential Contractors
As described above, the number of certified small establishments with paid employees was estimated
assuming that the number of certified small employers is proportional to the total number of small
employer establishments in the industry. The total number of certified establishments in each industry
(calculated in Chapter 4) was multiplied by the percentage of establishments in that industry with
revenues below the revenue thresholds described above in section 6.2.3. The number of small employer
establishments in each NAICS group estimated to obtain certification as a result of eliminating the opt-out
provision is presented in Table 6-10.
In order to estimate the number of renovators trained by each small employer establishment, the estimated
number of certified firms in each sector was multiplied by the expected number of renovators per
establishment for that sector. See Section 4.4.1.1 for a description of how the expected number of
renovators per establishment was estimated.
In order to estimate the number of employees of an average small establishment in each affected industry,
EPA used U.S. Economic Census data to determine the portion of each industry’s employees that work
for small businesses. This percentage was applied to the estimated number of trained renovators and
workers in each sector to calculate the number of trained renovators and workers employed by small
certified establishments. For each of the construction industry sectors, the total number of employees
(including non-employers5 who are trained as renovators) was divided by the total number of small
establishments to calculate an average small business employment size.
Table 6-10 presents the 50-year average number of renovators trained by small certified employer firms,
the percent of the workforce employed by small establishments,6 and the estimated numbers of trained
workers employed by small certified establishments in each NAICS group under Option A. Only entities
that would seek certification as a result of the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision would incur
additional certification and training costs.

Total Certification and Training Costs to Small Residential Contractor Establishments
To estimate small residential contractor training and certification costs, the numbers of individuals and
firms in Table 6-9 and Table 6-10 were multiplied by the average annualized costs of training a single
certified renovator and worker and maintaining certification from Table 6-8. The resulting average
annualized training and certification costs are presented in Table 6-12.
6.2.3.3 Work Practice Costs – Small Residential Contractors and Real Estate Establishments
Number of Events Performed Annually by Small Residential Contractor and Real Estate
Establishments
As discussed in Section 6.2.2 and the beginning of this section, this analysis attributes the work practice
costs of the rule to establishments on a per-event basis. In order to estimate the total number of events
performed by establishments in each of the affected industries and in order to distribute these events
between small and large establishments, EPA assumed that the number of events performed by each
establishment is proportional to the number of people the establishment employs. Furthermore, EPA

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-17
assumed that the number of events performed by each trained employee will be the same across all
industries including Residential Property Managers and Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings.
If property managers and lessors perform fewer events than estimated here, the impacts on these
establishments will be slightly smaller and the impacts on construction firms will be larger.
The number of events per small establishment in a particular industry was calculated as follows:
EPA estimated the 50-year average number of events per certified renovator or worker by calculating the
ratio of the total number of regulated RRP events to the total number of trained personnel (using the 50-
year averages). Because the number of people trained, as estimated in Chapter 4, was assumed to be
proportional to the regulated housing stock and the number of regulated events, the number of RRP
events per employee does not change over time and is approximately the same across options.
To estimate the average number of events performed by a small establishment in a given industry, the
establishment’s average employment size was multiplied by the average number of events per person.
Table 6-13 presents the 50-year average estimated number of events per small establishment.
Total Work Practice Compliance Costs – Residential Contractors and Real Estate Establishments
Table 6-8 presents the annualized average per event costs of the rule. For opt-out entities, these costs
include the cost of using lead-safe work practices and complying with the recordkeeping checklist
provision requirements. For entities currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule, costs are limited to
meeting the checklist provision requirements. Multiplying the average work practice and checklist cost
per small establishment by the total 50-year average number of small entities (see Section 6.2.3 for a
description of the derivation of this number) yields the total annualized work practice costs above and
beyond the 2008 LRRP rule. These costs are presented in Table 6-14.

6.2.3.4 Residential Contractors and Real Estate Industry Revenues
Cost-impact ratio analysis compares the cost of a regulation to a firm’s (in this case, establishment’s) total
revenues, not just to its revenues from the regulated activity. As such, for construction establishments,
the costs of the rule were compared to the total value of business done rather than just to the total value of
construction work. For real estate establishments, total revenues were used. Because no revenue data are
available specifically for establishments expected to seek certification under the regulations, EPA
assumed that average revenues of these businesses do not differ significantly from industry averages.
EPA calculated the revenues of a small certified construction business as a weighted average of small
employer and non-employer revenues. The 2002 U.S. Economic Census presents data on the number and
total value of business done by construction establishments with total annual revenues of $0 to $10
million and $10 million or more. To estimate the average revenues of small employers in each of the
affected construction sectors, the total value of business done by establishments in the $0 to $10 million
bracket was divided by the total number of establishments in that bracket. Since the Census presents
revenue figures in year 2002 dollars, the resulting average revenues were inflated to 2005 dollars using
the Consumer Price Index.7 Per-establishment revenues for non-employers were estimated for the cost
impact ratio analysis by dividing non-employer revenues (inflated to 2005 dollars) by the number of non-
employer establishments in each industry. Average revenues of certified small establishments are
presented in Table 6-15. Because 2002 data on the number of establishments by revenue bracket was not
available at the time the estimates were developed, 1997 data was used to estimate the percent of
establishments in each industry that qualify for small business status. EPA also used 1997 Census data to
calculate the percent of industry revenues contributed by these establishments. These percentages were
then applied to the 2002 numbers of establishments and industry revenue figures to estimate the number
and revenues of small and large employers in each industry. Average small and large employer revenues
(calculated by dividing the revenues of establishments in each industry and revenue bracket by the
corresponding number of establishments) were inflated to 2005 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.8
The resulting estimates are presented in Table 6-15.

6.2.3.5 Impacts on Small Residential Contractors and Real Estate Establishments
Impacts of the rule on small residential contractors and real estate industries are measured by comparing
the costs of the rule incurred by an establishment to the establishment’s revenues. The impacts on small
residential contractors and real estate establishments were estimated by first summing the total annualized
work practice, training, certification, and checklist costs incurred by these entities under Option A and
dividing these total costs by the number of establishments. Average costs per establishment were then
divided by average revenues to calculate a cost-to-revenue ratio. These calculations, and the resulting
cost-to-revenue ratios, are presented in Table 6-16.

employers may have issues related to under-reporting of income, which would tend to tend to exaggerate
the average impact ratio for this class of small entities. According to GAO, many sole proprietors
underreport their income, with a small proportion accounting for the bulk of understatements (GAO 1994
and 2007). According to IRS estimates reported by GAO, sole proprietors underreported their net income
by 57 percent in 2001 (GAO 2007). The IRS estimates address net income (i.e., revenues minus
expenses), while the small entity analysis compares compliance costs to revenues. According to IRS
figures, underreporting of gross income makes up at least half of the misreporting of net income. A key
reason for this underreporting is that the income of the self-employed is not subject to withholding and
only a portion of that income is subject to information reporting by third parties (GAO 2007). The IRS
estimates that at least 61 percent of sole proprietors underreported their income, and the IRS recognizes
that these are underestimates because detecting underreported income is difficult, especially cash receipts
(GAO 2007). Although at least 61 percent of sole proprietors had understated taxes, the amounts were
skewed with half of sole proprietors understating less than $903.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-23
6.2.4 Non-Residential Contractors
Non-residential contractors (i.e., those working in public or commercial building COFs) are currently
regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule and are not affected by the removal of the opt-out provision.
However, these entities would incur recordkeeping checklist provision costs under the proposed revisions
to the 2008 LRRP rule. Since this analysis estimates the incremental costs of the proposed revisions, the
following sections present the potential cost impacts of the checklist provision only.
Jobs that are not performed in-house by public and private schools, non-residential property
managers/lessors, and daycare centers will be performed by general and specialty contractors including
painters, electricians, plumbers/HVAC specialists, and non-residential building contractors. Under the
proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule, 3,223 establishments are expected to incur checklist costs in
the first year as a result of the checklist provision for projects in public or commercial building COFs.
Because different contractors are generally expected to work in public or commercial buildings and target
housing, this analysis considers impacts on these groups of establishments separately.
This analysis assumes that only contractors with employees will work on COFs in public or commercial
buildings.9 Furthermore, the types of jobs performed in public or commercial building COFs are
generally less varied than those in target housing. Events in COFs are assumed to consist primarily of
painting, window/door replacement, and plumbing and electrical projects. As such, it is likely that most
of these projects will be performed by painting, plumbing/HVAC, electrical and commercial contractors
(NAICS 236320, 238210, 238320 and 236220, respectively).
6.2.4.1 Number of Small Non-Residential Contractors Affected by the Proposed Revisions
To estimate the number of construction establishments working in public or commercial building COFs,
the percentage of newly trained workers and supervisors that those establishments employ, the number of
jobs they perform and their average revenues, the following assumptions are made:
 The number of additional contractors obtaining training and certification in each sector is
proportional to the number of jobs likely to be performed by each type of contractor. For
example, since painting jobs are estimated to make up 5 percent of all jobs performed by
contractors in public or commercial building COFs, 5 percent of the 3,223 contractor
establishments estimated to incur checklist costs are assumed to be painting contractors. Table 6-
19 presents the distribution of jobs by job type, describes the assumptions made to assign these
jobs to each type of contractor, and presents estimates of the number of contractor establishments
incurring checklist costs in the first year under Option A.
 These currently regulated contractors are only assumed to perform projects in public or
commercial building COFs. In reality, however, these additional contractors may perform some
residential work and some commercial work, while contractors with employees that were
included in the residential contractor section of this analysis may also do some of the non-
residential COF work. As such, to define the size and revenue of the average small firm working
in public or commercial building COFs, the numbers of certified non-residential contractors with
employees were added to the pool of pre-existing certified residential employer establishments in
the corresponding sectors. The percent of small establishments in each sector, percent of workers
employed (and thus jobs performed) by these establishments, and percent of total value of
business earned by these establishments were calculated using 2002 Economic Census data on the
number of small establishments and employees working for small establishments (U.S. Census

employed) contractors will work on COFs in target housing.

Bureau 2005a). Average revenues of small establishments were estimated by dividing the total
value of business earned by establishments with revenues below $10 million in each sector by the
total number of establishments with revenues below $10 million in that sector. The results of
these calculations are presented for Option A in Table 6-20. Note that because only
establishments with employees are assumed to work in public or commercial building COFs,
average revenues of small establishments in Table 6-20 are higher than the average revenues of
residential construction establishments, which include self-employed contractors.

a. The majority of unscheduled maintenance events are expected to be plumbing or electrical
events, which must be performed by a specialized contractor. It is assumed, however, that
every other year, one of the unscheduled maintenance events in each building will be a
painting or window/door project (for example, a soccer ball may break a window that will
then need to be replaced).
b. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that half of the scheduled plumbing and electrical
projects and all other unscheduled maintenance projects will be performed by plumbers and
the other half by electricians.

6.2.4.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Costs – Non-Residential Contractors
Number of Events Performed by Small Establishments – Non-Residential Contractors
On average, 98 percent of the 3,223 non-residential construction contractor establishments that will incur
checklist costs in the first year as a result of the proposed revisions to the LRRP Rule under Option A are
small businesses. Since the number of jobs performed by an establishment is proportional to the number
of people that establishment employs, these small businesses are expected to perform 69 percent of the
non-residential COF contractor jobs as a result of the 2008 LRRP rule. Table 6-21 presents the total
number of small contractor establishments incurring recordkeeping checklist costs and the number of
events in the first year under Option A.

Total Recordkeeping Checklist Costs
To estimate total checklist costs incurred by small non-residential construction establishments working in
public or commercial buildings housing COFs, the 50-Year average annual number of events performed
by these establishments (approximately 61 per firm) was multiplied by the sum of average annualized
recordkeeping checklist cost per event ($2; see Table 6-8). Table 6-23 presents the resulting annualized
total and average checklist costs to small non-residential construction establishments.

6.2.4.3 Impacts of the Proposed Revisions on Non-Residential Contractors
Impacts of the rule on small non-residential contractors are measured by comparing the costs of the rule
incurred by an establishment to the establishment’s revenues. The impacts on small non-residential
contractors were estimated by first dividing the total checklist costs under Option A by the number of
establishments. Average costs per establishment were then divided by average revenues to calculate a
cost-to-revenue ratio. These calculations, and the resulting cost-to-revenue ratios, are presented in Table
6-24.
6.2.5 Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers
Non-residential property lessors and managers are currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule and are
not affected by the removal of the opt-out provision. However, these entities would incur recordkeeping
checklist provision costs under the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule. As this analysis estimates
the incremental costs of the proposed revisions, the following sections present the potential cost impacts
of the checklist provision, only.
Lessors and managers of pre-1978 public or commercial (non-residential) buildings that rent space to
daycare centers and perform regulated projects on their own properties will incur recordkeeping checklist
costs under the revision to the 2008 LRRP rule. As discussed in Chapter 4, this analysis estimates that
13,279 daycare centers will rent space in pre-1978 non-residential buildings in the first year. On average
(over 50 years), 12,028 daycare centers are expected to rent space in pre-1978 buildings each year under
Option A. Because daycare centers are only one of many types of establishments renting non-residential
space and because the LRRP Rule applies only to centers in buildings constructed prior to 1978, the
analysis also assumes that each property manager or lessor firm owns only one non-residential building
containing a COF. As such, the number of affected lessor/manager firms is equivalent to the number of

affected daycare centers renting space or 12,028 firms under Option A. Due to the lack of data on the
extent to which these firms perform renovation work in their own buildings, this analysis assumes that
they will behave similarly to the operators of other public or commercial buildings with child-occupied
facilities, namely that they will perform all of their own painting and window/door carpentry projects as
well as an average of one unscheduled maintenance project per building every year.
6.2.5.1 Number of Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers Affected by the Proposed
revisions to the 2008 LRRP Rule
Lessors and managers of non-residential properties fall under NAICS 531120 and 531312, respectively.
In order to estimate the number of regulated firms in each of these sectors, it is assumed that the percent
of regulated firms in each industry is equivalent to the total percent of firms in that industry. In other
words, since Lessors of Non-Residential Buildings (NAICS 531120) make up 73 percent of
establishments in NACIS 531120 and 531312 combined, 73 percent of the 12,028 lessor/manager firms
affected by the rule under Option A are also assumed to fall in this sector, while the remaining 27 percent
are assumed to fall under NAICS 531312 (Calculated based on U.S. Census Bureau 2005f).
As discussed Section 2.4.2 of Chapter 2, 96 percent of Lessors of Non-Residential Real Estate, and 81
percent of Non-Residential Property Managers qualify for small business status under the SBA definition
of a small business in these sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This analysis assumes that the size
distribution of regulated firms mirrors the size distribution of the entire non-residential property lessor
and manager industry. Table 6-25 presents the resulting estimates of the number of small non-residential
property lessors and managers affected by the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule under Option A
in a typical year.
6.2.5.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Costs – Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers
The estimation of checklist costs incurred by each property lessor or manager is based on the average
number of events per building and the average checklist costs per event.
Total Checklist Compliance Costs – Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers
The annual number of events performed by each of these firms is estimated to be 0.71 events per year.
This average number of events was multiplied by the 50-year average number of small lessor/manager
firms to estimate the number of regulated projects performed by these businesses in a typical year. The
total number of regulated events, in turn, was multiplied by the annualized checklist costs per event (see
Table 6-8) to calculate these firms’ total annualized checklist costs. Table 6-26 presents these estimates,
as well as the average checklist costs per small firm.

6.2.5.3 Impacts of the Proposed Revisions on Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers
This small entity analysis measures the incremental impacts of the proposed revision to the 2008 LRRP
rule on small non-residential property lessors and managers by comparing rule costs incurred by these
firms to the weighted average revenue of small firms in NAICS 531120 and 531312, calculated based on
2002 Census Data. The weighted average revenue figure of $111,460 was inflated to 2005 dollars using
the Consumer Price Index to obtain estimated revenues of $126,256. The impacts on small non-
residential property lessors and managers were estimated by first dividing checklist costs incurred by
these entities under Option A by the number of establishments. Average costs per establishment were
then divided by average revenues to calculate a cost-to-revenue ratio.
The average annual numbers of businesses affected, average annualized per-business costs and revenues,
and the resulting cost-to-revenue ratio are presented in Table 6-27.

6.2.6 Daycare Centers (Small Non-Profits)
Daycare centers are currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule and are not affected by the removal of
the opt-out provision. However, these entities would incur recordkeeping checklist provision costs under
the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule. As this analysis estimates the incremental costs of the
proposed revisions, the following sections present the potential cost impacts of the checklist provision,
only.
6.2.6.1 Number of Small, Non-Profit Daycare Centers Affected by the Proposed Revisions to the
2008 LRRP Rule
As discussed in Chapter 2, there are an estimated 87,840 daycare centers in the United States. These
daycare centers include facilities that provide day care outside of a residential home and outside of
schools. Assuming a 75% compliance rate, and adjusting the total number of centers for building age
using HUD data on the age of education buildings, an estimated 38,210 daycare centers will be affected
by the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP Rule in the first year under Option A.10 As discussed in
Chapter 4, because of their locations, for-profit daycare centers are expected to hire outside contractors to
perform their renovations and repairs or to have their landlord handle these activities. The costs and
10 Based on 2003 HUD data, 58 percent of all education buildings were constructed before 1978, and 55 percent of
the pre-1978 buildings were constructed before 1960.

impacts for these events are accounted for in the sections of this chapter dealing with contractors and
landlords.
Daycare centers located in religious establishments such as churches or synagogues, however, frequently
use their own staff to perform some of their RRP events. According to the HUD survey of child care
centers (HUD 2003), approximately 73 percent of daycare centers located in churches and other religious
establishments use their own (or the religious organization’s) staff to perform painting projects. This
analysis assumes that, similar to public school districts and private schools, these establishments will also
use their own staff to perform all window/door carpentry work as well as one unscheduled maintenance
project every year.
The number of daycare centers located in religious establishments was estimated with data from the HUD
survey of child care centers (HUD 2003). According to these data, 41 percent of all daycare centers are
situated in churches or other similar organizations. (In contrast, the US Census reports that about 35
percent of daycare centers located outside of schools are non-profits (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c).) The
other 59 percent of daycare centers are assumed to use outside contractors for their RRP work rather than
in-house staff. Because the estimate of centers that are in religious settings is relatively large and there is
no independent data on other non-profits, this analysis estimates that about 30 percent of daycare centers
(0.73*0.41=.299) will perform their own renovation work and thus incur direct work practice, training,
and certification costs.11 Because all of these establishments are treated as though they are operated by
religious organizations, all daycare centers considered in the small entity analysis are considered to be
non-profit organizations. As the RFA defines independently owned and operated not-for-profit
enterprises that are not dominant in their field as “small organizations,” all the non-profit organizations
operating these day care centers are assumed to qualify as small entities. This assumption may
overestimate the number of impacted small non-profits, since some of these non-profit organizations may
not be small entities.
Table 6-28 presents the number of daycare centers regulated under Option A in a typical year, the total
number of daycare centers operated by non-profit organizations (based on the number in religious
organizations), and the number expected to perform some renovation work in-house. The estimation of
annual average numbers of centers accounts for the fact that, after the first year, the number of regulated
daycare centers is expected to decrease by 0.41 percent per year due to building demolition.
6.2.6.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Costs – Non-Profit Daycare Centers
The estimation of work practice costs incurred by each daycare center is based on the average number of
events per-building performed in-house and the average work practice costs per event.
11 Given the small size of the HUD survey sample, and the difference between the HUD and Census figures, the
estimate may include some non-profits operating daycare facilities that are not in religious settings but perform
their own repair work. Other non-profit daycare facilities may be hiring outside contractors, the same as for-
profit daycare facilities are assumed to do.

Total Checklist Compliance Costs – Non-Profit Daycare Centers
Staff in non-profit daycare centers (such as those operated by religious establishments) are expected to
perform in-house all painting and window/door carpentry work in their building as well as one
unscheduled maintenance event every year. Center staff are expected to perform 0.71 events per year in-
house.
As discussed in 6.2.2, the average annualized checklist cost per event in COFs in public and commercial
buildings is $2 under Option A (see Table 6-8). Multiplying this average cost by the total 50-year
average annual number of events in daycare centers that perform their own work yields the total
annualized checklist costs incurred by these centers in an average year. The total annual number of
events is the product of 0.71 and the number of centers doing in-house RRP work from Table 6-28.
These costs, and average per-center checklist costs, are presented in Table 6-29.

6.2.6.3 Non-Profit Daycare Center Expenditures
In analyzing impacts of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule on an entity, the analysis
conceptually should compare rule costs to the revenues or expenditures of an entire organization. As
such, costs of the rule to non-profit daycare centers should be compared to the revenues or expenditures
of the parent organization (such as the religious organization that operates them), rather than a single
center. Due to a lack of data both on the structure of these organizations and on their finances, such a
comparison was not possible. Instead, this analysis is based on daycare center revenues. Ten state
childcare industry impact studies were reviewed to obtain daycare center revenue data.12 Nine of these
studies did not differentiate between revenues of non-profit and for-profit centers. The Virginia
Economic Impact of the Child Care Industry report (Voices of Virginia’s Children 2004), however,
provided revenue data specific to religiously affiliated daycare centers. The state reported annual total
revenues of $236 million for its 929 religious daycare facilities or average revenues (inflated to 2005$) of
$287,605 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2006). This figure was used to measure the incremental
impacts of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule on non-profit centers.
6.2.6.4 Impacts on Non-Profit Daycare Centers
The impacts on non-profit daycare centers were estimated by first dividing total annualized checklist costs
incurred by these entities under Option A by the number of centers. Average costs per center were then
divided by average revenues to calculate a cost-to-revenue ratio. These calculations and the resulting
ratios are presented in Table 6-30.
12 Data were available for the following states: Oklahoma, New Jersey, Iowa, Hawaii, Ohio, Kansas, South Carolina,
West Virginia, Louisiana, Virginia, New York, South Dakota, Indiana, Maine and Massachusetts.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-31
6.2.7 Public Schools (Small Governments)
The RFA defines a small government jurisdiction as the government of a city, county, town, school
district or special district with a population of less than 50,000. This economic analysis relies on National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD) survey data to estimate the number
of school districts that have schools with pre-kindergarten or kindergarten programs, the number of such
schools per district, and district revenues.13 Furthermore, for most districts, a cross-reference system with
the 2000 Decennial Census provides a means for estimating the size of the population served by the
district.
Public schools are currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule and would seek certification before the
removal of the opt-out provision. However, these entities would incur recordkeeping checklist provision
costs under the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule. As this analysis estimates the incremental
costs of the proposed revisions, the following sections present only the potential cost impacts of the
checklist provision.
6.2.7.1 Number of Small Public School Districts Affected by the Proposed Revisions to the 2008
LRRP Rule
Number of Small Public School Districts
As discussed in Chapter 2, there are approximately 18,000 public school districts in the United States.
Based on CCD data, 14,473 of these school districts have at least one school with a kindergarten or pre-K
program; in total, these districts have 52,129 such schools (NCES 2006b,c). Of the 14,473 school
districts, 13,330 serve a population of fewer than 50,000 people. These 13,330 districts have a total of
26,779 schools with kindergartens or pre-kindergartens (NCES 2006b,c,g). These counts are not limited
to pre-1978 schools.
Since the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is only concerned with the direct costs of regulation, this small
entity analysis only considers the costs that school districts will incur if they perform regulated
renovation, repair, or painting projects using their own maintenance staff instead of hiring a contractor.
Costs and impacts associated with work performed by a contractor are accounted for in the contractor
section of this analysis.
As discussed in Chapter 4, this analysis assumes that public schools will perform all painting and
carpentry events using in-house staff. In addition, they are assumed to perform one of the unscheduled
maintenance events in each building using in-house staff each year.14 Thus, all small school districts that
13 It is possible that government agencies also operate some of the childcare facilities included in the daycare center
counts throughout this economic analysis. Due to insufficient data, it was not possible to estimate the number
of such government-run facilities, or the number or size of the agencies that operate them. As such, this small
government impact analysis is limited to public school districts.
14 The analysis assumes that all electrical, plumbing and HVAC work, as well as the remaining unscheduled
maintenance projects, are contracted out.

have at least one pre-1978 building will incur recordkeeping checklist costs under the proposed revisions
to the 2008 LRRP rule.
Number of Small Public Schools Affected by the Proposed Revisions to the 2008 LRRP Rule
The number of small school districts with at least one regulated building was estimated based on the
number of school buildings in the district and the likelihood that any one of the buildings is old enough to
be regulated. Using 2003 HUD data, 58 percent of school buildings are estimated to have been built
before 1978, and 55 percent of the pre-1978 buildings are estimated to have built before 1960 (U.S. HUD
2003). Thus, for example, under Option A the probability that any particular school building was built
after 1978 is 0.42 (1-0.58). The likelihood that a district has no pre-1978 buildings is a function of the
number of buildings and 0.42 as follows15:
(0.42)^X, where X is the number of schools with kindergarten or pre-kindergarten in the district
For example, a district with three buildings has a (0.42)*(0.42)*(0.42) = 0.074 probability of containing
no pre-1978 buildings. Using this approach, 92.6 percent of districts with three buildings are estimated to
have at least one building that is pre-1978. To estimate the average number of pre-1978 buildings in a 3-
building district with at least one pre-1978 building, the total number of buildings in 3-building districts
was multiplied by the percent of all schools constructed before 1978 (58 percent) and divided by the
number of districts with at least one pre-1978 building.
Table 6-31 presents the 50-year average numbers of small school districts with at least one pre-1978
building and the average number of buildings in these districts under Option A. The use of 50-year
average, rather than first or second year numbers accounts for the fact that, after the first year, the
numbers of regulated districts and pre-1978 schools are expected to decrease by 0.41 percent per year due
to building demolition.
6.2.7.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Costs – Public Schools
The estimation of checklist costs incurred by each district is based on the number of regulated buildings
in these districts, the average number of events per-building performed in-house, and the average
checklist costs per event.
Number of Events Performed Annually by Schools in Small Districts – Public Schools
Public and private schools (except for private schools with less than 100 students) are expected to perform
in-house all painting and window/door carpentry work as well as an average of one unscheduled
maintenance event per building every year using their own staff. (Private schools with fewer than 100
15 It is assumed that the age of each building is independent of the age of all other buildings in the district. This may
somewhat overestimate the number of districts that have at least one pre-1978 buildings. But data are not
available to calculate the joint probabilities.

6.2.7.3 Public School Revenues
The impact of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule on small government jurisdictions is
estimated by comparing the estimated incremental costs of the proposed revisions to the annual
government revenues of small regulated jurisdictions. Revenue data for school districts is available from
NCES’s Common Core of Data “Local Education Agency (School District) Finance Survey (F-33)”
dataset (NCES 2006d). Small districts include local school boards, supervisory unions, regional
education agencies, and other agencies, which primarily include charter schools. Revenue data are
available for the vast majority of districts. Average revenues for all small districts were estimated by a)
calculating the average revenues of each type of district based on available data, b) multiplying the
average revenues by the total number of districts of that type, then c) summing the resulting total revenues
and dividing by the total number of small districts. This approach presumes that there is no non-response
bias among districts within each category.
Table 6-34 presents small district revenue calculations and resulting estimates.

Table 6-33 presents the total annualized recordkeeping checklist costs incurred by small public school
districts as well as the average annualized costs per small district. Average annualized costs are then
divided by annual district revenues, as calculated in Table 6-35, to obtain a cost-to-revenue ratio.

6.2.8 Private Schools (Small Non-Profits)
Private schools are currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule and are not affected by the removal of
the opt-out provision. However, these entities would incur recordkeeping checklist provision costs under
the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule. As this analysis estimates the incremental costs of the
proposed revisions, the following sections present the potential cost impacts of the checklist provision,
only.
6.2.8.1 Number of Small Private Schools
As discussed in Chapter 2, according to the 2003-2004 NCES Private School Universe Survey Data, there
are a total of 26,531 private schools with kindergarten or pre-kindergarten programs in the United States
(NCES 2006e,f). Based on HUD data, 58 percent, or 15,387 of these schools were constructed before
1978, and 55 percent of the pre-1978 buildings, or 8,463 schools, were constructed before 1960. Because
no data source providing the number of private schools at different revenue levels was identified, all
private schools are considered to be small entities. In other words, the analysis assumes that each private
school is independently run and is not part of a larger organization. As such, the analysis may
overestimate the number of affected non-profit organizations and the impacts of the rule on these entities.

a. There are two different types of local school districts in NCES data – independent districts and districts that
are connected to a supervisory union office. These local school districts are combined in Chapters 2 and 4,
but are treated separately in estimating weighted average revenues.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-35
Similar to public schools, private schools will only incur direct costs as a result of this rule if they use
their own maintenance staff to perform regulated RRP work. Schools that perform regulated jobs in-
house will incur recordkeeping checklist costs as a result of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP
rule. This analysis assumes that private schools with fewer than 100 students will contract out all of their
renovation and repair work because of their small size, and costs and impacts associated with work
performed by a contractor are accounted for in the contractor section of this analysis. Private schools
serving more than 100 students are assumed to use their own staff to perform all painting and
window/door carpentry work as well as perform an average of one unscheduled maintenance event every
two years and to hire contractors to perform all other renovation, addition, and alteration projects.
As discussed in detail in Chapter 2, based on NCES’s Private School Universe survey data, 41 percent of
private schools with a kindergarten and/or pre-kindergarten have fewer than 100 students. Table 6-36
presents the total number of private schools regulated under Option A in a typical year, the number of
schools with fewer than 100 students, and the number of schools with more than 100 students. The use of
average annual numbers accounts for the fact that after the first year, the numbers of pre-1978 schools are
expected to decrease by 0.41 percent per year due to building demolition.
6.2.8.2 Recordkeeping Checklist Costs – Private Schools
Schools are expected to perform an average of approximately 2.9 events in-house per year. Table 6-37
presents the total number of private schools regulated in the first year under Option A, the total number of
events performed in these schools, and the total annualized checklist costs associated with these events.
Total checklist costs are estimated by multiplying the average annual number of events by the average
annualized checklist cost per event ($2; see Table 6-8). Average annualized checklist costs per private
school are calculated by dividing total checklist costs by the number of affected schools.
6.2.8.3 Impact of the Proposed Revisions to the 2008 LRRP Rule on Small Private Schools
Conceptually, impacts on non-profit establishments such as schools might be measured in terms of the
ratio of rule costs to annual operating expenses. Due to the scarcity of data on private school operating
expenditures (schools are excluded from the U.S. Economic Census, and NCES does not have a financial

data set for private schools), annual private school expenditures are approximated based on estimated
operating expenses per student obtained from a 1995 study by NCES entitled Estimates of Expenditures
for Private K-12 Schools and information on the number of students enrolled at each school as reported in
NCES’s 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey data set.
Based on NCES data (1995), this analysis estimates that private school expenditures average about $3,377
(2005$) per child per year. Appendix 6A explains the derivation of this estimate in detail.
To estimate average private school expenditures for schools with over 100 students operating pre-
kindergarten or kindergarten programs, the average number of students per school meeting this criteria
was calculated based on 2003-2004 NCES survey data (NCES 2006f). Schools for which no total student
enrollment data was available were assumed to have the average enrollment at schools with more than
100 students where student data was provided. Using these assumptions, the average private school with
over 100 students was estimated to serve 283 students per year. As such, average expenditures for private
schools are estimated to be $3,377*283, or $956,697.
Impacts on private schools were estimated by dividing the total annualized checklist costs incurred by
these schools under Option A by the number of regulated schools. Average costs per school were then
divided by average expenditures to calculate a cost-to-expenditure ratio. These calculations and the
resulting ratio are presented in Table 6-38.

6.2.9 Summary of the Proposed Revisions to the 2008 LRRP Rule Impacts on Small
Governments, Non-Profit Organizations, and Small For-Profit Businesses
The vast majority of entities in the industries affected by the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule
are small. As a result of the proposed revisions, approximately 289,250 small entities would incur costs
under Option A, incremental to impacts associated with the 2008 LRRP rule. Of the total, 100,662 small
residential contractors would seek certification as a result of the proposed removal of the opt-out
provision; therefore, they would incur training, certification, work practice, and checklist costs. The
remaining 188,588 small entities, who are currently regulated by the 2008 LRRP rule, would only incur
the incremental costs of the proposed recordkeeping checklist provisions.
6.2.9.1 Incremental Impacts of the Proposed Revisions – Opt-Out Entities
The average annualized incremental cost of the proposed revisions to a typical small opt-out entity is
estimated to range from $1,700 to $5,200 under Option A, depending on the number of renovation, repair,
and painting events undertaken by a small opt-out entity in the industry sector involved. As shown in
Table 6-39, under Option A, the incremental cost impact of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule
on small opt-out entities ranges from 0.87 percent to 2.19 percent of revenues depending on the industry
sector.

repair, and painting events undertaken by a small entity in the industry sector involved. As shown in
Table 6-41, under Option A, the incremental cost impact of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule
on small currently regulated entities ranges from about .0001 percent to .07 percent of revenues,
depending on the industry sector.

6.3 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4, establishes requirements for
Federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments,
and the private sector. Under section 202 of the UMRA, EPA generally must prepare a written statement,
including a cost-benefit analysis, for proposed and 2008 LRRP rules with “Federal mandates” that might
result in expenditures by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of
$100 million or more (when adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.16
Before promulgating a regulation for which a written statement is needed, section 205 of the UMRA
generally requires EPA to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and adopt
the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the
rule. The provisions of section 205 do not apply when they are inconsistent with applicable law.
Moreover, section 205 allows EPA to adopt an alternative other than the least costly, most cost-effective,
or least burdensome alternative if the Administrator publishes with the rule an explanation of why that
alternative was not adopted. Before EPA establishes any regulatory requirements that might significantly
or uniquely affect small governments, including Tribal governments, it must have developed under
section 203 of the UMRA a small government agency plan. The plan must provide for notifying
potentially affected small governments, enabling officials of affected small governments to have
meaningful and timely input in the development of EPA regulatory proposals with significant
intergovernmental mandates, and informing, educating, and advising small governments on compliance
with regulatory requirements. This section identifies the government entities that may be affected by the
proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule.
16 When the original $100 million UMRA threshold is adjusted for inflation from 1995 to 2005 dollars using an
implicit price deflator for gross domestic product, the result is a threshold of $118 million.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-40
6.3.1 Affected Government Entities
The proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule will affect activities in publicly owned child-occupied
facilities, specifically publicly owned housing and public schools.17 As with the private sector, the
proposed recordkeeping checklist provision will increase the cost of operating these facilities by requiring
that a copy of the recordkeeping checklist be posted in an area available to parents of students. Each
school district that uses its own in-house staff to perform RRP activities in regulated buildings is required
to comply with the checklist provision. Thus, state and local governments will incur incremental costs of
photocopying and posting the checklist during the renovation, repair, and painting of public school
buildings.
While most of what is commonly referred to as public housing is owned by state or local governments
and provided for the benefit of low-income and/or elderly households, other public entities (such as public
colleges and universities) may provide housing regulated under the LRRP rule. As with the private
sector, the proposed revisions to the LRRP regulations will increase the cost of operating this housing by
requiring that the recordkeeping checklist be made available to occupants. However, this is a very small
cost, estimated to average $2 per renovation.
6.3.2 Expenditures by State, Local, and Tribal Governments – Public School Districts
State, local, and Tribal governments will incur the incremental costs imposed by the proposed revisions to
the 2008 LRRP rule when public school districts engage in certain RRP activities.18 Based on available
data and the economic analysis presented in Chapter 4 and Section 6.2, Section 6.3 assumes that all public
school districts will perform all painting- and window/door carpentry tasks themselves, as well as some
unscheduled maintenance and repairs. Public schools are assumed to hire third-party contractors to
perform the remainder of their RRP work. Since all public school districts use their own staff to perform
some of their RRP activities, all public school districts would need to comply with the recordkeeping
checklist requirements outlined in Chapter 4.19 Table 6-44 presents the estimated total annualized
incremental costs of the proposed revisions that would be incurred by public school districts under Option
A.
17 It is possible that government agencies also operate some of the childcare facilities included in the daycare center
counts throughout this economic analysis. Due to insufficient data, it was not possible to estimate the number
of such government-run facilities, or the number or size of the agencies that operate them. As such, this
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act is limited to public school districts.
18 As discussed in Chapter 4, states would be able to apply for, and receive authorization to administer these
proposed requirements, but would be under no obligation to do so.
19 It is important to note that this analysis uses a 75 percent compliance rate. See Chapter 4 and the small entity
analysis (Section 6.2) for a more comprehensive discussion of these cost estimates.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-41

6.4 Executive Order 13132 - Federalism
Executive Order 13132, entitled Federalism (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), directs federal agencies to
consider whether a rule has federalism implications (i.e. whether it has substantial direct effects on the
states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132).
As discussed in Chapter 4, states would be able to apply for and receive authorization to administer these
requirements but would be under no obligation to do so. In the absence of a state authorization, EPA will
administer these requirements. While the cost analysis assumes that EPA will administer and enforce the
program in all places, it also assumes that states would incur similar costs if they administer and enforce
the regulation. To the extent that they operate target housing or child-occupied facilities, states may incur
costs due to the requirement that the recordkeeping checklist be made available to occupants. Given the
low cost per event of providing the checklist, this rule is not expected to have a significant impact on
states.
6.5 Executive Order 13175 - Tribal Implications
Executive Order 13175, entitled Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments (59 FR
22951, November 6, 2000), directs federal agencies to consider whether a rule has tribal implications (i.e.
whether it has substantial direct effects on tribal governments, on the relationship between the Federal
government and the Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal
government and Indian tribes).
Under the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule, Tribes would be able to apply for and receive
authorization to administer these requirements on Tribal lands, but Tribes would be under no obligation to
do so. In the absence of a Tribal authorization, EPA will administer these requirements.

a. In the first year, the COF Rule is expected to affect 7,782 public school districts and 12,648 school
buildings in these districts. Every year thereafter, the number of affected districts and schools is
expected to decrease by 0.41 percent as older buildings are demolished. The use of 50-year
average numbers of districts and schools captures this annual decrease.
b. Schools are expected to perform 2.87 events per year per building using their own maintenance
staff (see Section 6.2 for more details).
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-42
To the extent that Tribes operate target housing or child-occupied facilities, they may incur costs due to
the requirement that the recordkeeping checklist be made available to occupants. The number of Tribal
authorities that conduct renovation work on regulated properties is not known. However, given the low
cost per event for providing the checklist, this rule is not expected to have a substantial direct effect on
Tribes.
6.6 Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risk and Safety Risks
Under Executive Order 13045, a regulation must be reviewed if the regulatory action is economically
significant and concerns an environmental health risk or safety risk that may disproportionately affect
children. Since children are particularly susceptible to the IQ loss and adverse health effects caused by
exposure to lead dust, a significant objective of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule is the
protection of children’s health. Removing the opt-out provision protects children under the age of six
who spend a limited amount of time in housing (such as a relative or caregiver’s house) where a
renovation has been performed under the opt-out provision; children who move into such housing when
their family purchases it after such a renovation has been performed; and children who live in a property
adjacent or near to owner-occupied housing where renovation has been performed under the opt-out
provision. This analysis looks at the number of children in one of these groups – children who receive
regular care in a house that does not meet the definition of a child-occupied facility.
6.6.1 Target Housing Affected by the Proposed Elimination of the Opt-Out Provision
Children Receiving Regular Care in Target Housing that is not a COF
A target housing unit where a child visits regularly, but spends fewer that 6 hours a week is not
considered a child-occupied facility. Therefore, these housing units, hereafter referred to as Regular Care
Target Housing (RCTH) units, are eligible for the opt-out provision under the 2008 LRRP rule providing
that there is no child under the age of six or pregnant woman that resides in the unit. Thus, children
visiting RCTH may benefit from the elimination of the opt-out provision by reducing potential exposures
to lead dust during these visits.
Table 6-46 presents the annual number of children visiting opt-out eligible RCTH where LBP is disturbed
during RRP events that are protected by the removal of the opt-out provision.

a. Assumes a 75% compliance rate.
b. The stock of target housing, and therefore the number of individuals living in
target housing, is assumed to decline by 0.41% per year (due to demolitions,
conversions, etc,) based on Census data.
c. Options E1 to E4 cover the same target housing universe and have the same
effective date as Option A, but do not provide the same level of protection
because they do not require all of the work practice standards under 40 CFR
734.85.
Since the opt-out provision is eliminated under Option A as soon as the rule becomes effective, all
children receiving care in opt-out eligible RCTH performing RRP that disturbs LBP are protected in the
first year. Since the opt-out provision under Option B is eliminated six months later (halfway through the
beginning of the first year the rule is in place), the number of individuals protected under Option B in the
first year is half the number estimated for Option A. Under Option C, the opt-out provision is eliminated a
year later. Under Option D the opt-out provision is eliminated as soon as the rule becomes effective for
housing built before 1960. Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of
regulated structures as Option A, but consider alternative work practice requirements. As indicated in
Table 6-46, the majority of the children that would be protected by the elimination of the opt-out
provision reside in housing built before 1960 because of the higher likelihood of LBP in these housing
units. Options E1 through E4 have the same effective dates and universe of regulated structures as Option
A, but consider alternative work practice requirements. In the second year (starting June 2011), the opt-
out provision would be eliminated under all options.
6.7 Executive Order 13211 - Energy Effects
Executive Order 13211, entitled Actions Concerning Regulations that Significantly Affect Energy Supply,
Distribution, or Use (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001), directs federal agencies to identify actions that will
have a significant adverse energy effect. Adverse effects are defined as:
 Reductions in crude oil supply in excess of 10,000 barrels per day;
 Reductions in fuel production in excess of 4,000 barrels per day;
 Reductions in coal production in excess of 5 million tons per year;
 Reductions in natural gas production in excess of 25 million mcf per year;
 Reductions in electricity production in excess of 1 billion kilowatt-hours per year or in excess of
500 megawatts of installed capacity;
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-44
 Increases in energy use required by the regulatory action that exceed any of the thresholds above;
 Increases in the cost of energy production in excess of one percent;
 Increases in the cost of energy distribution in excess of one percent; or
 Other similarly adverse outcomes.
The regulations under consideration will not significantly reduce energy production nor significantly
increase energy costs.
6.8 National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act
Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (“NTTAA”), Public
Law No. 104-113, 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs federal agencies to use voluntary consensus
standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or
otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials
specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted
by voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA directs federal agencies to provide Congress,
through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary
consensus standards.
This proposed rulemaking does not involve technical standards. Therefore, EPA is not considering the use
of any voluntary consensus standards.
6.9 Executive Order 12898 – Environmental Justice
Under Executive Order 12898, when promulgating a regulation, EPA investigates whether there are
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income
populations. The LRRP regulation requires that renovators, when undertaking renovation activities in
regulated facilities, reduce the risk of exposure to lead by employing the use of safe work practices. In
addition, renovators are required to undertake cleaning verification at the end of each project. This
environmental justice analysis first summarizes a few important points to consider when viewing the
results. Next a summary of the impacts from the regulation on minority and low-income populations in
target housing units and child-occupied facilities is presented. Racial minorities and low-income
households stand to accrue benefits as a result of the proposed revision to the LRRP rule.
Following the work practice, cleaning, and cleaning verification steps specified in the rule will increase
the costs for renovation, repair and painting activities that would be regulated as a result of the proposed
elimination of the opt-out provision from the 2008 LRRP rule. These additional costs may lead some
lower income homeowners of properties in lower income neighborhoods to avoid using certified
renovators or recommended practices. The incremental costs of the proposed rule’s work practices are
typically below $200, and for many jobs the cost is significantly below this figure.20 These costs are
likely to be a small part of the total cost of the renovation, repair, and painting projects. EPA believes
that these costs are unlikely to result in significant changes in consumer behavior. If however, the
increased costs result in more projects being undertaken by uncertified firms or by do-it-yourselfers, the
risks in these instances would be the same as in the baseline and would not constitute new risks resulting
from the proposed revisions. EPA believes that the proposed revisions would result in new risks only if
the increased costs caused individuals to delay work such as painting until lead-based paint began peeling
and chipping, creating a lead hazard. Such delays are expected to occur infrequently given the proposed
revisions’ low cost per event.
20 This estimate is adjusted for baseline work practices and assumes a 75% compliance rate. See Chapter 4.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-45
The proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule would only add recordkeeping checklist requirements for
buildings that are ineligible for the opt-out provision. The proposed checklist requirements are not
expected to have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority
and low-income populations.
6.9.1 Target Housing Currently Eligible for the Opt-Out Provision
This section evaluates the distribution of renovation events in target housing units and the individuals
protected across three race and two income groups. Although it would be preferable to perform a joint
environmental justice analysis for the race and income groups, relevant data are not available to make
these population inferences. Therefore, the analysis was performed separately for the race and income
groups.
6.9.1.1 Low Income
EPA defines low income individuals as individuals whose income are below the level set by the federal
government’s official poverty definition. Based on data from the 2000 Decennial Census, 12.4% of
individuals were living below the poverty level (U.S. Census Bureau 2000a). The analysis evaluates
whether the removal of the opt-out provision will have a disproportionately greater effect on low income
individuals.
The data in Table 6-47 presents the numbers of households below the poverty level that own their home.
As a result of the proposed elimination of the opt-out provision from the 2008 LRRP rule, more owner-
occupied target housing events would be performed using the work practices required by the 2008 LRRP
rule. Only households built prior to 1978 would potentially be affected by the proposed revisions. About
4.5 percent of pre-1980 owner-occupied housing units have residents below the poverty line.

6.9.1.2 Race:
This section of the environmental justice analysis considers the impacts of the proposed revisions across
three race categories. The data in Table 6-48 compares the percentages of owners and renters for three
categories of race, “White Alone,” “Black/African American Alone,” and “Asian Alone.” The 2000
Census data shows that Black/African American households and Asian households are almost as likely to
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-46
reside in owner housing as rental housing. Because no data were available for race by age of housing
unit, this analysis uses pre-2000 housing to provide a general idea of these proportions.
6.9.2 Conclusions
The proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule seeks to minimize the exposure of children and adults to
lead-based paint hazards created during renovation, repair, and painting activities in certain types of
owner-occupied target housing that are currently eligible for the opt-out provision. As such, EPA
concludes that the proposed revisions to the rule will not lead to disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects on minority and low income populations in target housing units
that would become regulated.

APPENDIX 6A – Estimating average per-pupil expenditures of private schools
This appendix outlines the methodology used to estimate total annual private school expenditures for the
small entity analysis. Total annual school expenditures were estimated based on per-student operating
expense data and information on the number of students enrolled. This analysis used per-pupil
expenditure values for 1991-92, first calculated in a working paper published by the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES) entitled “Estimates of Expenditures for Private K-12 Schools” (NCES 1995).
The two mean per-pupil expenditure values (one for elementary schools and one for combined schools)
presented were combined into one value - the private school per-pupil expenditure value - using selected
weights. Finally, this value was inflated to 2005 dollars using the CPI. The inflated value was used to
estimate the total expenditures of private schools with various sized student bodies.
The NCES working paper divided 1991-92 Private School Survey (PSS) data into 19 mutually exclusive
and exhaustive sectors of schools based on grade level (elementary, secondary, and combined elementary
and secondary), and religious or other affiliation. The paper relied on expenditure data collected by three
school associations (The National Catholic Education Association (NCEA), the Lutheran Church-
Missouri Synod (LCNS), and the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS)) to calculate
average annual per-student expenditures for their associated schools. Data from the three surveyed school
associations accounted for 45% of the total private school as presented in the PSS (NCES 1995). For the
remaining schools, NCES estimated two sets of per-student expenditures using data obtained from
Catholic and Lutheran schools (referred to as the Catholic and Lutheran School Models, respectively).
Table 6A-1 presents the number of schools and the annual per-student expenditures for the 19 sectors of
schools using the Lutheran school data to estimate missing expenditure values.

The per-student expenditure estimates presented are based on the Lutheran School Model rather than the
Catholic School Model because, based on the evidence presented in NCES’s study, Lutheran school data
are likely to be more accurate. Specifically, when assessing the quality of the data, the working paper
authors express concern over potential non-response bias and sampling error in the Catholic elementary
and secondary school data. In addition, a comparison of the total operating expenses of private
elementary and secondary schools generated by each model with an alternate estimate calculated annually
by NCES indicated that while that both the Catholic and the Lutheran School Model estimates are below
the alternative NCES estimates, the Lutheran School Model is the closer of the two.21 Therefore the
Lutheran School Model was used in this analysis.
To estimate per-student expenditures for schools likely to be affected by the proposed revisions to the
LRRP Rule, the school sectors most likely to contain schools with pre-kindergarten and kindergarten

programs were identified in the NCES study. Table 6A-2 shows Table 6A-1 with an additional column
indicating whether or not the estimated mean for that sector was included in the calculation for mean per-
private-school-pupil expenditure based on the assumptions made about the likelihood of that sector
containing a kindergarten or pre-kindergarten program. An “x” indicates that the mean per-pupil
expenditure value is included in the calculation.

Of the 19 sectors, 6 are for secondary schools only. Since the working paper notes that secondary
schools22 spend more than twice as much as elementary schools spend per pupil, and are the least likely,
by definition, to contain a COF, they are excluded from the calculation of the mean per-pupil expenditure
value.
22 Defined as having a highest grade less than or equal to 12th and a lowest grade of greater than or equal to 6th.
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 6-50
For elementary schools23, the $2,003 mean per-pupil expenditure cost was selected. This value represents
8,887 of the 17,093 (52%) elementary schools presented in the working paper. Though Catholic schools
represent approximately 45 percent of all elementary schools, their associated mean per-pupil expenditure
estimate is not used due to the potential bias discussed above. The remaining elementary school per-pupil
expenditure values are between 3 and 4 times larger than the chosen value; however these means
represent schools unlikely to be affected by the LRRP rule. For example, the mean per-pupil expenditure
values presented for NAIS schools (449 of the 561 remaining schools) are much higher since “a relatively
large proportion of NAIS schools are boarding schools and expenditures for dormitories are apparently
included in the total operating expenditures for these schools.” It is unlikely that a COF would be found in
a boarding school. The remaining 112 schools are special education elementary schools, which are more
costly because of their unique needs and are also less likely to contain a COF. Furthermore, as the
working paper notes, “preschool is probably less expensive than other grades,” and therefore, it is likely
that the average across all elementary schools ($2,125) would overstate expenditures.
For combined schools, the $4,527 mean per-pupil expenditure cost is used. 24 This value represents 5,028
of the 6,285 (80%) combined schools presented in the working paper. The other mean per-pupil values
are roughly double this value, pulling the mean for all combined schools up to $5,766. This higher value
is not used as it most likely overstates the expenditures given that boarding schools and special education
schools are again included in the calculation.
In order to obtain one private school per-pupil expenditure value, the previously discussed elementary
school and combined school data were weighted. The weights were based on the current proportions of
elementary schools and combined schools with either a pre-kindergarten or kindergarten program. In
order to calculate the weights, this analysis used the data set underlying the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) report entitled “Characteristics of Private Schools in the United States: Results From
the 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey.” Note that it was assumed that per-student expenditures
at K-terminal schools were the same as in elementary schools. 25
In 2003-2004, there were a total of 18,289 private elementary schools and 4,338 private combined schools
with pre-K or kindergarten programs. Thus, a weight of 0.81 (18,289/22,627) was attached to the mean
per-pupil elementary school expenditure value and a weight of 0.19 (4,338/22,627) was attached to the
mean per-pupil combined school expenditure value. This calculation yields a final private school per-
pupil expenditure value of $2,426.
Because the study is based on 1991-1992 PSS data, it was assumed that expenditure values were in 1992
dollars. Taking into account inflation, $2,426 in 1992 dollars is equivalent to $3,377 in 2006 dollars (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics 2006).
23 Defined as having a highest grade of less than or equal to 8th.
24 A combined school is defined as having a highest grade less than or equal to 12th and a lowest grade less than or
equal to 5th.
25 A K-terminal school is defined as a school for which kindergarten is the highest grade. In the 2003-2004 PSS, K-
terminals represented an estimated 22% of all private schools with either a kindergarten or pre-kindergarten
program.
