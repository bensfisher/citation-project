EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
ES.1 Overview 
Based on its review of the air quality criteria and the national ambient air quality 
standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
is proposing to revise the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) NAAQS for fine 
particles (generally referring to particles less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers [µm] in 
diameter—PM2.5) to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. As 
has traditionally been done in NAAQS rulemakings, the EPA has conducted a Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (RIA) to provide the public with illustrative estimates of the potential costs and health 
and welfare benefits of attaining several alternative PM2.5 standards based on one possible set 
of selected control strategies for reducing direct PM and PM precursor emissions. 
In NAAQS rulemakings, the RIA is prepared for informational purposes only, and the 
proposed decisions on the PM NAAQS discussed in the proposed rulemaking are not in any way 
based on consideration of the information or analyses in the RIA. The RIA fulfills the 
requirements of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 and guidelines of the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB) Circular A-4.1 Benefit and cost estimates provided in the RIA 
are not additive to benefits and costs from other regulations, and the costs and benefits 
identified in this RIA will not be realized until specific controls are mandated by State 
Implementation Plans (SIPs) or other federal regulations. 
ES.2 Existing and Alternative PM Air Quality Standards 
Currently, two primary PM2.5 standards provide public health protection from effects 
associated with fine particle exposures: the annual standard and the 24-hour standard. The 
annual standard is set at a level of 15.0 µg/m3, based on the 3-year average of annual 
arithmetic mean PM2.5 concentrations. The 24-hour standard is set at a level of 35 µg/m3, based 
on the 3-year average of the 98th percentile of 24-hour PM2.5 concentration. In the RIA, the 
current primary PM2.5 standard, including both annual and 24-hour averaging times is denoted 
as 15/35. 
In the current PM NAAQS review, the EPA is proposing to revise the level of the primary 
annual PM2.5 standard within the range of 12 to 13 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the level 
of the 24-hour standard at 35 µg/m3. In order to characterize the costs and benefits, it was

ES-2 
necessary to identify discrete levels along this continuum. For purposes of this analysis, we 
identified an annual standard of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the level of the 24-hour 
standard at 35 µg/m3 (denoted 12/35) and an annual standard of 13 µg/m3 in conjunction with 
retaining the level of the 24-hour standard at 35 µg/m3 (denoted as and 13/35). 
In addition to 12/35 and 13/35, the RIA also analyzes the benefits and costs of 
incremental control strategies for two other alternative standards (11/35 and 11/30). The four 
alternative standards analyzed are as follows: 
 A revised annual standard level of 13 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 
24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (13/35) 
 A revised annual standard level of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 
24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (12/35) 
 A revised annual standard level of 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 
24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (11/35 ) 
 A revised annual standard level of 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with a revised 24-hour 
standard level at 30 µg/m3 (11/30 ) 
In analyzing the current 15/35 standard (baseline), the EPA determined that all counties 
would meet the 14/35 standard concurrently with meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no 
additional cost. Consequently, no incremental costs or benefits are associated with 14/35 and 
therefore, no need to present an analysis of 14/35 in this RIA. 
Currently, the existing secondary PM2.5 standards are identical in all respects to the 
primary standards. In the current PM NAAQS review, the EPA is proposing to add a distinct 
standard for PM2.5 to provide protection from PM-related visibility impairment. Specifically, the 
EPA is proposing to establish a separate secondary standard defined in terms of a PM2.5 
visibility index, which would use speciated PM2.5 mass concentrations and relative humidity 
data to calculate PM2.5 light extinction, similar to the Regional Haze Program; a 24-hour 
averaging time; a 90th percentile form; and a level of either 30 deciviews (dv) or 28 dv. Based 
on the air quality analysis conducted for the primary PM2.5 standard, all monitored areas are 
estimated to be in attainment with both proposed secondary standard levels in 2020, assuming 
full attainment of the primary PM2.5 standard. For the two optional levels proposed for the 
secondary standard, no additional costs or benefits will be realized beyond those quantified for 
meeting the primary PM2.5 standard in this RIA. 
ES-3 
With regard to the primary and secondary standards for particles less than or equal to 
10 µm in diameter (PM10), the EPA is proposing to retain the current primary and secondary 
24-hour PM10 standards. Both standards are the same. The current primary and secondary 24-
hour standards are set at a level of 150 µg/m3, not to be exceeded more than once per year on 
average over 3 years (EPA, 1997)2. Since the benefit-cost analysis of the alternative PM10 
standards was conducted when the standard was selected, this RIA does not repeat that 
analysis here. 
ES.2.1 Establishing the Baseline 
The RIA is intended to evaluate the costs and benefits of reaching attainment with 
potential alternative PM2.5 standards. In order to develop and evaluate control strategies for 
attaining a more stringent primary standard, it is important to first estimate PM2.5 levels in 2020 
given the current NAAQS standards (15/35) and air quality trends. Estimating the 2020 levels is 
known as the baseline. Establishing this baseline allows us to estimate the incremental costs 
and benefits of attaining any alternative primary standard. 
The baseline includes reductions already achieved as a result of national regulations, 
reductions expected prior to 2020 from recently promulgated national regulations3 (i.e., 
reductions that were not realized before 2005 but are expected prior to attainment of the 
current PM standard), and reductions from additional controls which the EPA estimates need to 
be included to attain the current standard (15/35). Reductions achieved as a result of state and 
local agency regulations and voluntary programs are reflected to the extent that they are 
represented in emission inventory information submitted to the EPA by state and local 
agencies4. Two steps were used to develop the baseline. First, the reductions expected in 
national PM2.5 concentrations from national rules promulgated prior to this analysis were 
considered (referred to as the base case). Below is a list of some of the major national rules 
reflected in the base case. Refer to Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2 for a more detailed discussion of 
the rules reflected in the base case emissions inventory. 
 Light-Duty Vehicle Tier 2 Rule (U.S. EPA, 1999)

National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Proposed Regional Haze Rule. Available at:

3 The recently proposed Boiler MACT and CISWI reconsiderations are not included in the base case. These rules 
were not yet proposed at the time of this analysis. It is not clear how the geographic scope of this rule will 
match with the counties analyzed for this RIA—the costs may decrease but the magnitude is uncertain. 
4 The amendments to the Low Emissions Vehicle Program (LEV-III) in California are not included in the base case. 
This program requires an approval of U.S. EPA via a waiver. At the time of this analysis the waiver had not been 
submitted.

We did not conduct this analysis incremental to controls applied as part of previous 
NAAQS analyses (e.g., O3, NOx, or SO2) because the data and modeling on which these previous 
analyses were based are now considered outdated and are not compatible with the current 
PM2.5 NAAQS analysis. In addition, all control strategies analyzed in NAAQS RIAs are 
hypothetical. This analysis presents one scenario that states may employ but does not prescribe 
how attainment must be achieved. 
Second, because the base case reductions alone were not predicted to bring all areas 
into attainment with the current standard (15/35), please see Figures 4-1 and 4-2 in Chapter 4 
of this RIA, the EPA used a hypothetical control strategy to apply additional known controls to 
illustrate attainment with that standard. To establish the baseline, additional control measures 
were used in two sectors:5 Non-Electricity Generating Unit Point Sources (Non-EGUs) and Non-
Point Area Sources (Area). 
                                                     
5 In establishing the baseline, the EPA selected a set of cost-effective controls to simulate attainment of the current 
PM2.5 standard. These control sets are hypothetical because states will ultimately determine controls as part of 
the SIP process.

ES.2.2 Emission Reduction Estimates by Alternative Standards (2020) 
Emission reductions were calculated for the four alternative standards (13/35, 12/35, 
11/35, and 11/30) from a baseline of attaining the current standard of 15/35. Emission 
reductions were calculated for the known control strategy analysis and the extrapolated cost 
analysis for each alternative standard being analyzed. The EPA estimates the national-scale 
emission reductions for each of the alternative standards as shown in Table ES-1.

11/30 22,000 23,000 8,200 
a Estimates are rounded to two significant figures. 
ES.2.3 Health and Welfare Benefits Analysis Approach 
The EPA estimated human health (e.g., mortality and morbidity effects) under full 
attainment of the three alternative combinations of primary PM2.5 standards. We considered an 
array of health impacts attributable to changes in PM2.5 exposure. The EPA has incorporated an 
array of policy and technical updates to the benefits analysis approach applied in this RIA, 
including incorporation of the most recent follow-up to the American Cancer Society (ACS) 
cohort (Krewski et al., 2009), updated health endpoints, new morbidity studies, updated 
hospital cost-of-illness estimates, and an expanded uncertainty assessment. Each of these 
updates is fully described in the benefits chapter. Even though the alternative primary 
standards are designed to protect against adverse effects to human health, the emission 
reductions have welfare co-benefits in addition to the direct human health benefits. The term 
welfare co-benefits covers both environmental and societal benefits of reducing pollution, such 
as reductions in visibility impairment, materials damage, and ecosystem damage. Despite our 
attempts to quantify and monetize as many of the benefits as possible, welfare benefits are not 
quantified or monetized in this analysis. Unquantified health benefits are discussed in Chapter 
5, and unquantified welfare benefits are discussed in Chapter 6. 
It is important to note that estimates of the health benefits from reduced PM2.5 
exposure reported here contain uncertainty, including from the following key assumptions: 
ES-6 
1. We assumed that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 
equally potent in causing premature mortality. This assumption is an important 
assumption, because PM2.5 varies considerably in composition across sources, but 
the scientific evidence is not yet sufficient to allow differentiation of effects 
estimates by particle type. 
2. We assumed that the health impact function for fine particles is linear within the 
range of ambient concentrations under consideration. Thus, the estimates include 
health benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of 
PM2.5, including both regions that are in attainment with the fine particle standard 
and those that do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled 
concentrations. 
As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, the Policy Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2011c) 
concludes that the range from the 25th to 10th percentiles of the air quality data used the 
epidemiology studies is a reasonable range below which we have appreciably less confidence in 
the associations observed in the epidemiological studies. In the RIA accompanying the 
promulgated PM NAAQS, EPA will characterize the distribution of estimated PM-related health 
benefits attributable to PM reductions occurring above and below the selected standard. For 
12/35, we estimate that 51% and 92% of the estimated avoided premature deaths occur at or 
above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 μg/m3 (the lowest measured level (LML) of the Laden et 
al. 2006 study) and 5.8 μg/m3 (the LML of the Krewski et al. 2009 study), respectively. For 13/35, 
these estimates are 62% and 89%. These are the two source studies for the concentration-
response functions used to estimate mortality benefits. The EPA briefly describes the 
uncertainties in the concentration-response functions below and in considerably more detail in 
the benefits chapter of this RIA. 
Although these concentration benchmark analyses (e.g., 25th percentile, 10th percentile, 
and LML) provide some insight into the level of uncertainty in the estimated PM2.5 mortality 
benefits, EPA does not view these concentration benchmarks as a concentration threshold. The 
best estimate of benefits includes estimates below and above these concentration benchmarks, 
but uncertainty is higher in health benefits estimated at lower concentrations, with the lowest 
confidence below the LML. Estimated health impacts reflecting air quality improvements both 
below and above these concentration benchmarks are appropriately included in the total 
benefits estimate. In other words, our increased confidence in the estimated benefits above 
these concentration benchmarks should not imply an absence of confidence in the benefits 
estimated below these concentration benchmarks. 
ES-7 
It is important to note that these estimated benefits reflect specific control measures 
and emission reductions that are needed to lower PM2.5 concentrations for monitors projected 
to exceed the alternative standard analyzed. The result is that air quality will improve in 
counties that exceed the alternative standards as well as surrounding areas that do not exceed 
the alternative standards. It is not possible to apply controls that only reduce PM2.5 at the 
monitor without affecting surrounding areas. In order to make a direct comparison between 
the benefits and costs of these control strategies, it is appropriate to include all the benefits 
occurring as a result of the control strategies applied. 
We estimate benefits using modeled air quality data with 12km grid cells, which is 
important because the grid cells are smaller than counties and PM2.5 concentrations vary 
spatially within a county. Some grid cells in a county can be below the level of the alternative 
standard even though the highest monitor value is above the alternative standard. Thus, 
emission reductions lead to benefits in grid cells that are below the alternative standards even 
within a county with a monitor that exceeds the alternative standard. We have not estimated 
the fraction of benefits that occur only in counties that exceed the alternative standards. 
ES.2.4 Cost Analysis Approach 
The EPA estimated total costs under partial and full attainment of the alternative PM2.5 
standards. The engineering costs generally include the costs of purchasing, installing, and 
operating the referenced control technologies. The technologies and control strategies selected 
for analysis are illustrative of one way in which nonattainment areas could meet a revised 
standard. There are numerous ways to construct and evaluate potential control programs that 
would bring areas into attainment with alternative standards, and the EPA anticipates that 
state and local governments will consider programs that are best suited for local conditions. 
The partial-attainment cost analysis reflects the costs associated with applying known 
controls. Costs for full attainment include estimates for the engineering costs of the additional 
tons of emissions reductions that are needed beyond identified controls, referred to as 
extrapolated costs. The EPA recognizes that the extrapolated portion of the engineering cost 
estimates reflects substantial uncertainty about which sectors and which technologies might 
become available for cost-effective application in the future. 
ES.2.5 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
In the analysis, we estimate the net benefits of the proposed range of annual PM2.5 
standards of 12/35 to 13/35. For 12/35, net benefits are estimated to be $2.3 billion to $5.9 
billion at a 3% discount rate and $2.0 billion to $5.3 billion at a 7% discount rate in 2020 (2006 
ES-8 
dollars).6 For 13/35, net benefits are estimated to be $85 million to $220 million at the 3% 
discount rate and $76 million to $200 million at the 7% discount rate. 
The EPA estimated the net benefits of the alternative annual PM2.5 standard of 11/35 to 
be $8.9 billion to $23 billion at a 3% discount rate and $8.0 billion to $21 billion at a 7% 
discount rate in 2020. The EPA estimated the net benefits of the alternative annual PM2.5 
standard of 11/30 to be $14 billion to $36 billion at a 3% discount rate and $13 billion to $33 
billion at a 7% discount rate in 2020. All estimates are in 2006$.7 
In analyzing the current 15/35 standard (baseline), the EPA determined that all counties 
would meet the 14/35 standard concurrently with meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no 
additional cost. No incremental costs or benefits are associated with 14/35 and consequently, 
there is no analysis 14/35 in this RIA. 
We provide these results in Table ES-2 and a regional percentage breakdown of costs 
and benefits in Table ES-3. In Table ES-4, we provide the avoided health incidences associated 
with these standard levels. 
ES.2.6 Conclusions of the Analysis 
The EPA’s illustrative analysis has estimated the health and welfare benefits and costs 
associated with the proposed revised PM NAAQS. The results for 2020 suggest there will be 
significant health and welfare benefits and these benefits will outweigh the costs associated 
with the illustrative control strategies in 2020. 
                                                     
6 Using a 2010$ year increases estimated costs and benefits by approximately 8%. Because of data limitations, we 
were unable to discount compliance costs for all sectors at 3%. As a result, the net benefit calculations at 3% 
were computed by subtracting the costs at 7% from the monetized benefits at 3%.

valuation assumes discounting over the Science Advisory Board-recommended 20-year segmented lag structure. 
Not all possible benefits or disbenefits are quantified and monetized in this analysis. B is the sum of all 
unquantified benefits. Data limitations prevented us from quantifying these endpoints, and as such, these 
benefits are inherently more uncertain than those benefits that we were able to quantify. 
c Due to data limitations, we were unable to discount compliance costs for all sectors at 3%. As a result, the net 
benefit calculations at 3% were computed by subtracting the costs at 7% from monetized benefits at 3%. 
For the lower end of the proposed standard range of 12/35, the EPA estimates that the 
benefits of full attainment exceed the costs of full attainment by 34 to 86 times at a 3% 
discount rate and 30 to 78 times at a 7% discount rate. For the upper end of the proposed 
standard range of 13/35, the EPA estimates that the benefits of full attainment exceed the 
costs of full attainment by 30 to 77 times at a 3% discount rate and 27 to 69 times at a 7% 
discount rate. For the alternative standards, 11/35 and 11/30, the EPA estimates that the 
benefits of full attainment exceed the costs of full attainment by 34 to 94 times at a 3% 
discount rate and 30 to 85 times at a 7% discount rate.

ES.3 Caveats and Limitations 
EPA acknowledges several important limitations of the primary and secondary analysis. 
These include: 
ES.3.1 Benefits Caveats 
 PM2.5 mortality co-benefits represent a substantial proportion of total monetized 
benefits (over 98%). To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between 
PM2.5 and premature mortality, we include a set of twelve estimates of the 
concentration-response function based on results of the PM2.5 mortality expert 
elicitation study in addition to our core estimates. Even these multiple 
characterizations omit the uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence 
rates, populations exposed, and transferability of the effect estimate to diverse 
locations. As a result, the reported confidence intervals and range of estimates give 
an incomplete picture about the overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates. This 
information should be interpreted within the context of the larger uncertainty 
surrounding the entire analysis. 
 Most of the estimated avoided premature deaths occur at or above the lowest 
measured PM2.5 concentration in the two studies used to estimate mortality 
benefits. In general, we have greater confidence in risk estimates based on PM2.5 
concentrations where the bulk of the data reside and somewhat less confidence 
where data density is lower. 
 We analyzed full attainment in 2020, and projecting key variables introduces 
uncertainty. Inherent in any analysis of future regulatory programs are uncertainties 
in projecting atmospheric conditions and source-level emissions, as well as 
population, health baselines, incomes, technology, and other factors. 
 There are uncertainties related to the health impact functions used in the analysis. 
These include within-study variability; pooling across studies; the application of C-R 
functions nationwide and for all particle species; extrapolation of impact functions 
across populations; and various uncertainties in the C-R function, including causality 
and shape of the function at low concentrations. Therefore, benefits may be under- 
or over-estimates. 
 This analysis omits certain unquantified effects due to lack of data, time, and 
resources. These unquantified endpoints include other health and ecosystem 
effects. The EPA will continue to evaluate new methods and models and select those 
most appropriate for estimating the benefits of reductions in air pollution. 
ES-12 
ES.3.2 Control Strategy and Cost Analysis Caveats and Limitations 
Control Technology Data 
 Technologies applied may not reflect emerging devices that may be available in 
future years. 
 Control efficiency data depend on equipment being well maintained. 
 Area source controls assume a constant estimate of emission reductions, despite 
variability in extent and scale of application. 
Control Strategy Development 
 States may develop different control strategies than the ones illustrated. 
 Data on baseline controls from current SIPs are lacking. 
 Timing of control strategies may be different than envisioned in the RIA. 
 Controls are applied within the county with the violating monitor. It is possible that 
additional known controls could be available in a wider geographical area. 
 Unknown controls were needed to reach attainment in several counties. Costs 
associated with these unknown controls were estimated using a fixed-cost per ton 
methodology as well as an extrapolated cost methodology. 
 Emissions reductions from mobile sources, EGUs, other PM2.5 precursors (i.e., 
ammonia and VOC), and voluntary programs are not reflected in the analyses. 
Technological Change 
 Emission reductions do not reflect potential effects of technological change that may 
be available in future years. 
 Effects of “learning by doing” are not accounted for in the emission reduction 
estimates. 
 Future technology developments in sectors not analyzed here (e.g., EGUs) may be 
transferrable to non-EGU and area sources, making these sources more viable for 
achieving future attainment at a lower cost than the cost presented in this analysis. 
Engineering Cost Estimates 
 Because of data limitations, we were unable to discount compliance costs for all 
sectors at 3%. 
 Estimates of private compliance cost are used as a proxy for social cost. 
Unquantified Costs 
 A number of costs remain unquantified, including administration costs of federal and 
state SIP programs, and transactional costs. 
ES-13 
ES.3.3 Limitations of the Secondary Standard Analysis 
Visibility design values for 2020 were calculated using the CMAQ modeling information 
and 2004-2006 ambient measurements. To determine the design values for meeting the 
current primary PM2.5 standard and proposed alternative primary standards, we used a 
methodology, described in Chapter 3, to estimate the small emissions reductions needed from 
control measures to show attainment and to estimate the costs and benefits of attaining the 
proposed alternative primary standards. It is not possible to apply this methodology to the 
visibility design values.8 As a result, the only analysis available for the proposed alternative 
secondary standards in 2020 is prior to full attainment of the current primary standard. All 
monitors analyzed are projected to attain a secondary standard of 30 dv in the 2020 base case. 
Given the 24-hr design value reductions that were included in simulating attainment of 15/35 in 
the 2020 base case, we are confident in our conclusion that all monitors will also attain a 
secondary standard of 28 dv when they attain the current primary standards.9 
ES.4 Discussion 
An extensive body of scientific evidence documented in the Integrated Science 
Assessment for Particulate Matter (PM ISA) indicates that PM2.5 can penetrate deep into the 
lungs and cause serious health effects, including premature death and other non-fatal illnesses 
(U.S. EPA, 2009). As described in the preamble to the proposed regulation, the proposed 
changes to the standards are based on an integrative assessment of an extensive body of new 
scientific evidence (U.S. EPA, 2009). Health studies published since the PM ISA(e.g., Pope et al. 
[2009]) confirm that recent levels of PM2.5 have had a significant impact on public health. Based 
on the air quality analysis in this RIA, the EPA projects that nearly all counties with PM2.5 
monitors in the U.S. would meet an annual standard of 12 µg/m3 by 2020 without additional 
                                                     
8As described in Chapter 3, we apply a methodology of air quality ratios to estimate the emissions reductions 
needed to meet the current and proposed alternative levels for the primary standard. While this methodology 
can estimate how these emissions reductions will affect changes in the future-year annual design value and the 
corresponding response of the future-year 24-hr design value to changes in the annual design value, it is unable 
to estimate how each of the PM2.5 species will change with these emission reductions. Given that estimating 
changes in future-year visibility is dependent on the IMPROVE equation and how the PM2.5 species are 
projected to change in time, we are unable to estimate visibility design values for meeting the current and 
proposed alternative levels for the primary standard.  
9 The projected 2020 base case design values for the secondary standard for the following monitors with id 
numbers 60658001 (located in Riverside, CA), 60290014 (located in Kern, CA), and 60990005 (located in 
Stanislaus, CA) are 29 dv, 30 dv, and 29 dv, respectively. The emissions reductions selected for simulating 
attainment of 15/35 in the 2020 base case resulted in the following reductions in the 24-hr design values for 
these three monitors: 11.1 µg/m3, 21.9 µg/m3 and 5.3 µg/m3, respectively. We believe that these emissions 
reductions and 24-hr design value changes for simulating the current primary standard levels of 15/35 will be 
enough to lower the projected 2020 secondary standard design values for these three monitors to 28 dv or 
lower. 
ES-14 
federal, state, or local PM control programs. This demonstrates the substantial progress that 
the U.S. has made in reducing air pollution emissions over the last several decades. Regulations 
such as the EPA’s recent Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), the Cross-State Air Pollution 
Rule (CSAPR), and other federal programs such as diesel standards will provide substantial 
improvements in regional concentrations of PM2.5. Our analysis shows a few areas would still 
need additional emissions reductions to address local sources of air pollution, including ports 
and uncontrolled industrial emissions. For this reason, we have designed the RIA analysis to 
focus on local controls in these few areas. We estimate that these additional local controls 
would yield benefits well in excess of costs, by a ratio of at least 30 to 1. 
The setting of a NAAQS does not compel specific pollution reductions, and as such does 
not directly result in costs or benefits. For this reason, NAAQS RIAs are merely illustrative. The 
NAAQS RIAs illustrate the potential costs and benefits of additional steps States could take to 
attain a revised air quality standard nationwide beyond rules already on the books. We base 
our illustrative estimates on an array of emission control strategies for different sources. The 
costs and benefits identified in this RIA will not be realized until specific controls are mandated 
by State Implementation Plans (SIPs) or other federal regulations. In short, NAAQS RIAs 
hypothesize, but do not prescribe, the control strategies that States may choose to enact when 
implementing a revised NAAQS. 
It is important to emphasize that the EPA does not “double count” the costs or the 
benefits of our rules. Emission reductions achieved under rules that require specific actions 
from sources—such as MATS—are in the baseline of this NAAQS analysis, as are emission 
reductions needed to meet the current NAAQS. For this reason, the cost and benefits estimates 
provided in this RIA and all other NAAQS RIAs should not be added to the estimates for 
implementation rules. 
Furthermore, the monetized benefits estimates do not paint a complete picture of the 
burden of PM to public health. For example, modeling by Fann et al. (2012) estimated that 2005 
levels of air pollution were responsible for between 130,000 and 320,000 PM2.5-related deaths, 
or between 6.1% and 15% of total deaths from all causes in the continental United States. The 
monetized benefits associated with attaining the proposed range of standards appear modest 
when viewed within the context of the potential overall public health burden of PM2.5 and 
ozone air pollution estimated by Fann et al. (2012), but this is primarily because regulations 
already on the books will make great strides toward reducing future levels of PM. One 
important distinction between the total public health burden estimated for 2005 air pollution 
levels and the estimated benefits in this RIA is that ambient levels of PM2.5 will have improved 
ES-15 
substantially by 2020. For example, we estimate that SO2 emissions in the U.S. would fall from 
14 million tons in 2005 to less than 5 million tons by 2020 (a reduction of 66%). For this reason, 
States will only need to achieve small air quality improvements to reach the proposed PM 
standards. As shown in recent RIAs for the CSAPR (U.S. EPA, 2011a) and MATS (U.S. EPA, 
2011b), implementing other federal and state air quality actions will address a substantial 
fraction of the total public health burden of PM2.5 and ozone air pollution. 
The NAAQS are not set at levels that eliminate the risk of air pollution. Instead, the 
Administrator sets the NAAQS at a level requisite to protect public health with an adequate 
margin of safety, taking into consideration effects on susceptible populations based on the 
scientific literature. The risk analysis prepared in support of this PM NAAQS reported risks 
below these levels, while acknowledging that the confidence in those effect estimates is higher 
at levels closer to the standard (U.S. EPA, 2010). While benefits occurring below the standard 
are assumed to be more uncertain than those occurring above the standard, the EPA considers 
these to be legitimate components of the total benefits estimate. Though there are greater 
uncertainties at lower PM2.5 concentrations, there is no evidence of a population-level 
threshold in PM2.5-related health effects in the epidemiology literature. 
Lastly, the EPA was unable to monetize fully all of the benefits associated with reaching 
these standards in this RIA, including other health effects of PM, visibility effects, ecosystem 
effects, and climate effects. If the EPA were able to monetize all of the benefits, the benefits 
would exceed the costs by an even greater margin. Even when considered in light of the 
quantified and unquantified uncertainties identified in this RIA, we believe that implementing 
the proposed range of standards would have substantial public health benefits that outweigh 
the costs.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
1.1 Synopsis 
This chapter summarizes the purpose and results of this Regulatory Impact Analysis 
(RIA). This RIA estimates the human health and welfare benefits and costs of attaining several 
particulate matter (PM) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nationwide. According 
to the Clean Air Act (“Act”), the EPA must use health-based criteria in setting the NAAQS and 
cannot consider estimates of compliance cost. The EPA is producing this RIA both to provide the 
public a sense of the benefits and costs of meeting a new NAAQS and to meet the requirements 
of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563. 
1.2 Background 
1.2.1 NAAQS 
Two sections of the Clean Air Act (“the Act”) govern the establishment and revision of 
NAAQS. Section 108 (42 U.S.C. 7408) directs the Administrator to identify pollutants that “may 
reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare” and to issue air quality criteria 
for them. These air quality criteria are intended to “accurately reflect the latest scientific 
knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or 
welfare which may be expected from the presence of [a] pollutant in the ambient air.” PM is 
one of six pollutants for which the EPA has developed air quality criteria. 
Section 109 (42 U.S.C. 7409) directs the Administrator to propose and promulgate 
“primary” and “secondary” NAAQS for pollutants identified under section 108. Section 
109(b)(1) defines a primary standard as “the attainment and maintenance of which in the 
judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria and allowing an adequate margin of 
safety, [are] requisite to protect the public health.” A secondary standard, as defined in section 
109(b)(2), must “specify a level of air quality the attainment and maintenance of which in the 
judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria, [are] requisite to protect the public 
welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of [the] 
pollutant in the ambient air.” Welfare effects as defined in section 302(h) [42 U.S.C. 7602(h)] 
include but are not limited to “effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, 
animals, wildlife, weather, visibility and climate, damage to and deterioration of property, and 
hazards to transportation, as well as effects on economic values and on personal comfort and 
well-being.” 
1-2 
Section 109(d) of the Act directs the Administrator to review existing criteria and 
standards at 5-year intervals. When warranted by such review, the Administrator is to retain or 
revise the NAAQS. After promulgation or revision of the NAAQS, the standards are 
implemented by the states. 
1.2.2 2006 PM NAAQS 
In 2006, the EPA’s final PM rule established a 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3 and 
retained the annual standard of 15 µg/m3. The EPA revised the secondary standards for fine 
particles by making them identical in all respects to the primary standards. Following 
promulgation of the final rule in 2006, several parties filed petitions for its review. On February 
24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the primary 
annual PM2.5 NAAQS to the EPA citing that the EPA failed to adequately explain why the 
standard provided the requisite protection from both short- and long-term exposures to fine 
particles, including protection for at-risk populations. The court remanded the secondary 
standards to the EPA citing that the Agency failed to adequately explain why setting the 
secondary PM standards identical to the primary standards provided the required protection 
for public welfare, including protection from visibility impairment. 
1.3 Role of this RIA in the Process of Setting the NAAQS 
1.3.1 Legislative Roles 
In setting primary ambient air quality standards, the EPA’s responsibility under the law 
is to establish standards that protect public health, regardless of the costs of implementing a 
new standard. The Act requires the EPA, for each criteria pollutant, to set a standard that 
protects public health with “an adequate margin of safety.” As interpreted by the Agency and 
the courts, the Act requires the EPA to create standards based on health considerations only. 
The prohibition against the consideration of cost in the setting of the primary air quality 
standard, however, does not mean that costs or other economic considerations are 
unimportant or should be ignored. The Agency believes that consideration of costs and benefits 
is essential to making efficient, cost-effective decisions for implementing these standards. The 
impact of cost and efficiency is considered by states during this process, as they decide what 
timelines, strategies, and policies make the most sense. This RIA is intended to inform the 
public about the potential costs and benefits that may result when new standards are 
implemented, but it is not relevant to establishing the standards themselves. 
1-3 
1.3.2 Role of Statutory and Executive Orders 
This RIA is separate from the NAAQS decision-making process, but several statutes and 
executive orders still apply to any public documentation. The analysis required by these 
statutes and executive orders is presented in Chapter 9. 
The EPA presents this RIA pursuant to Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 and the 
guidelines of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-4.1 These documents present 
guidelines for the EPA to assess the benefits and costs of the selected regulatory option as well 
as more and less stringent options than those proposed or selected. In concordance with these 
guidelines, the RIA also analyzes the benefits and costs of alternative combinations of primary 
PM2.5 standards, one combination that is more stringent than the existing standards, but less 
stringent than the proposed standards and another combination that is more stringent than the 
proposed standards (see Section 1.4.2). 
In the current PM NAAQS review, the EPA is proposing to revise the level of the primary 
annual PM2.5 standard within the range of 12 to 13 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the level 
of the 24-hour standard at 35 µg/m3 (denoted 12/35 and 13/35). In addition to the range of 
12/35 to 13/35, the RIA also analyzes the benefits and costs of incremental control strategies 
for two other alternative standards (11/35 and 11/30). In analyzing the current 15/35 standard 
(baseline), the EPA determined that all counties would meet the 14/35 standard concurrently 
with meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no additional cost. Consequently, no incremental 
costs or benefits are associated with 14/35; thus, no analysis of 14/35 is presented. 
Benefit and cost estimates provided in the RIA are not additive to benefits and costs 
from other regulations, and, further, the costs and benefits identified in this RIA will not be 
realized until specific controls are mandated by State Implementation Plans (SIPs) or other 
federal regulations. 
1.3.3 The Need for National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
OMB Circular A-4 indicates that one of the reasons a regulation such as the NAAQS may 
be issued is to address existing “externalities.” An externality occurs when one party’s actions 
impose uncompensated benefits or costs on another party. Environmental problems are a 
classic case of an externality. Setting primary and secondary air quality standards is one way the

government can address an externality and thereby increase air quality and improve overall 
public health and welfare. 
1.3.4 Illustrative Nature of the Analysis 
This NAAQS RIA is an illustrative analysis that provides useful insights into a limited 
number of emissions control scenarios that states might implement to achieve revised NAAQS. 
Because states are ultimately responsible for implementing strategies to meet any revised 
standard, the control scenarios in this RIA are necessarily hypothetical in nature. Important 
uncertainties and limitations are documented in the relevant portions of the analysis. 
The illustrative goals of this RIA are somewhat different from other EPA analyses of 
national rules, or the implementation plans states develop, and the distinctions are worth brief 
mention. This RIA does not assess the regulatory impact of an EPA-prescribed national rule, nor 
does it attempt to model the specific actions that any state would take to implement a revised 
standard. This analysis attempts to estimate the costs and human and welfare benefits of cost-
effective implementation strategies that might be undertaken to achieve national attainment of 
new standards. These hypothetical strategies represent a scenario where states use one set of 
cost-effective controls to attain a revised NAAQS. Because states—not the EPA—will implement 
any revised NAAQS, they will ultimately determine appropriate emissions control scenarios. 
SIPs would likely vary from the EPA’s estimates due to differences in the data and assumptions 
that states use to develop these plans. 
The illustrative attainment scenarios presented in this RIA were constructed with the 
understanding that there are inherent uncertainties in projecting emissions and controls. 
1.4 Overview and Design of the RIA 
The RIA evaluates the costs and benefits of hypothetical national strategies to attain 
several alternative PM standards. 
1.4.1 Modeling PM2.5 Levels in the Future (Analysis Year = 2020) 
A national-scale air quality modeling analysis was performed to estimate future-year 
annual and 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations and light extinction for the future year of 2020. Air 
quality ratios were then developed using model responsiveness to emissions changes between 
a recent year of air quality, 2005, and a future year of air quality, 2020. The air quality ratios 
were used to determine potential control scenarios designed to attain the proposed alternative 
NAAQS, as well as the costs of attaining these levels. These data were then used to estimate 
1-5 
how air quality would change under each set of potential control scenarios, and as inputs to the 
calculation of expected benefits from the alternative NAAQS considered in this assessment. 
1.4.2 Existing and Alternative PM Air Quality Standards 
Currently two primary PM2.5 standards provide public health protection from effects 
associated with fine particle exposures. The annual standard is set at a level of 15.0 µg/m3, 
based on the 3-year average of annual arithmetic mean PM2.5 concentrations. The 24-hour 
standard is set at a level of 35 µg/m3, based on the 3-year average of the 98th percentile of 
24-hour PM2.5 concentrations. In the RIA, the current suite of primary PM2.5 standards, 
including both annual and 24-hour averaging times, is denoted as 15/35. 
In the current PM NAAQS review, the EPA is proposing to revise the level of the primary 
annual PM2.5 standard within the range of 12 to 13 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the level 
of the 24-hour standard at 35 µg/m3 (denoted 12/35 and 13/35). 
In addition to the range of 12/35 to 13/35, the RIA also analyzes the benefits and costs 
of incremental control strategies for two other alternative standards (11/35 and 11/30). The 
four alternative standards analyzed are as follows: 
 A revised annual standard level of 13 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 
24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (13/35) 
 A revised annual standard level of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 
24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (12/35) 
 A revised annual standard level of 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 
24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (11/35 ) 
 A revised annual standard level of 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with a revised 24-hour 
standard level at 30 µg/m3 (11/30 ) 
In analyzing the current 15/35 standard (baseline), the EPA determined that all counties 
would meet the 14/35 standard concurrently with meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no 
additional cost. Consequently, no incremental costs or benefits are associated with 14/35; thus, 
no analysis of 14/35 is presented in this RIA. 
Currently, the existing secondary PM2.5 standards are identical in all respects to the 
primary standards. In the current PM NAAQS review, the EPA is proposing to add a distinct 
standard for PM2.5 to provide protection from PM-related visibility impairment. Specifically, the 
EPA is proposing to establish a separate secondary standard defined in terms of a PM2.5 
1-6 
visibility index, which would use speciated PM2.5 mass concentrations and relative humidity 
data to calculate PM2.5 light extinction, similar to the Regional Haze Program; a 24-hour 
averaging time; a 90th percentile form; and a level of either 30 deciviews (dv) or 28 dv. Based 
on the air quality analysis conducted for the primary PM2.5 standard, all monitored areas are 
estimated to be in attainment with both proposed secondary standard levels in 2020, assuming 
full attainment of the primary PM2.5 standard. For the two optional levels proposed for the 
secondary standard, no additional costs or benefits will be realized beyond those quantified for 
meeting the primary PM2.5 standard in this RIA. 
With regard to the primary and secondary standards for particles less than or equal to 
10 µm in diameter (PM10), the EPA is proposing to retain the current primary and secondary 
24-hour PM10 standards. Both standards are the same. The current primary and secondary 
24-hour standards are set at a level of 150 µg/m3, not to be exceeded more than once per year 
on average over 3 years (EPA, 1997)2. Since the benefit cost analysis of the alternative PM10 
standards was conducted when the standard was selected, this RIA does not repeat that 
analysis here. 
1.4.3 Benefits Analysis Approach 
The EPA estimated human health (e.g., mortality and morbidity effects) under full 
attainment of several alternative PM standards. We considered an array of health impacts 
attributable to changes in PM2.5. Even though the alternative primary standards are designed to 
protect against adverse effects to human health, the emission reductions have welfare 
co-benefits in addition to the direct human health benefits. The term welfare co-benefits covers 
both environmental and societal benefits of reducing pollution, such as reductions in visibility 
impairment, materials damage, and ecosystem damage. Despite our attempts to quantify and 
monetize as many of the benefits as possible, many welfare benefits are not quantified or 
monetized. 
1.4.4 Costs Analysis Approach 
The EPA estimated total costs under partial and full attainment of several alternative 
PM standards. The engineering costs generally include the costs of purchasing, installing, and 
operating the referenced control technologies. The technologies and control strategies selected 
for analysis are illustrative of one way in which nonattainment areas could meet a revised

standard. There are numerous ways to construct and evaluate potential control programs that 
would bring areas into attainment with alternative standards, and the EPA anticipates that 
state and local governments will consider programs that are best suited for local conditions. 
The partial attainment cost analysis reflects the costs associated with known controls. Costs for 
full attainment include estimates for the engineering costs of the additional tons of emissions 
reductions that are needed beyond identified controls, referred to as extrapolated costs. The 
EPA recognizes that the extrapolated portion of the engineering cost estimates reflects 
substantial uncertainty about which sectors, and which technologies, might become available 
for cost-effective application in the future.

CHAPTER 2 
DEFINING THE PM AIR QUALITY PROBLEM 
2.1 Synopsis 
This chapter characterizes the nature, scope and magnitude of the current year PM 
problem. It includes 1) a summary of the spatial and temporal distribution of PM2.5 and the 
likely origin from direct emissions or atmospheric transformations of gaseous precursors; 
2) discussion of what visibility is and how it is calculated from measured concentrations and 
meteorological values; and 3) current year design values for PM2.5 and visibility. 
2.2 Particulate Matter (PM) Properties 
Particulate matter (PM) is a highly complex mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets 
distributed among numerous atmospheric gases which interact with solid and liquid phases. 
Particles range in size from those smaller than 1 nanometer (10-9 meter) to over 100 
micrometer (µm, or 10-6 meter) in diameter (for reference, a typical strand of human hair is 70 
µm in diameter and a grain of salt is about 100 µm). Atmospheric particles can be grouped into 
several classes according to their aerodynamic and physical sizes, including ultrafine particles 
(<0.1 µm), accumulation mode or ‘fine’ particles (0.1 to ~3 µm), and coarse particles (>1 µm). 
For regulatory purposes, fine particles are measured as PM2.5 and inhalable or thoracic coarse 
particles are measured as PM10-2.5, corresponding to their size (diameter) range in micrometers 
and referring to total particle mass under 2.5 and between 2.5 and 10 micrometers, 
respectively. The EPA currently has standards that measure PM2.5 and PM10. 
Particles span many sizes and shapes and consist of hundreds of different chemicals. 
Particles are emitted directly from sources and are also formed through atmospheric chemical 
reactions; the former are often referred to as “primary” particles, and the latter as “secondary” 
particles. Particle pollution also varies by time of year and location and is affected by several 
weather-related factors, such as temperature, clouds, humidity, and wind. A further layer of 
complexity comes from particles’ ability to shift between solid/liquid and gaseous phases, 
which is influenced by concentration and meteorology, especially temperature. 
Particles are made up of different chemical components. The major chemical 
components include carbonaceous materials (carbon soot and organic compounds), and 
inorganic compounds including, sulfate and nitrate compounds that usually include ammonium, 
and a mix of substances often apportioned to crustal materials such as soil and ash. As 
mentioned above, particulate matter includes both “primary” PM, which is directly emitted into 
the air, and “secondary” PM, which forms indirectly from emissions from fuel combustion and 
 2-2 
other sources. Primary PM consists of carbonaceous materials (soot and accompanying 
organics) and includes: 
 Elemental carbon, organic carbon, and crustal material directly emitted from cars, 
trucks, heavy equipment, forest fires, some industrial processes and burning waste. 
 Both combustion and process related fine metals and larger crustal material from 
unpaved roads, stone crushing, construction sites, and metallurgical operations. 
Secondary PM forms in the atmosphere from gases. Some of these reactions require 
sunlight and/or water vapor. Secondary PM includes: 
 Sulfates formed from sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants and industrial 
facilities; 
 Nitrates formed from nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from cars, trucks, industrial 
facilities, and power plants; and 
 Ammonium formed from ammonia (NH3) emissions from gas-powered vehicles and 
fertilizer and animal feed operations. These contribute to the formation of sulfates 
and nitrates that exist in the atmosphere as ammonium sulfate and ammonium 
nitrate.1 
 Organic carbon (OC) formed from reactive organic gas emissions, including volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs), from cars, trucks, industrial facilities, forest fires, and 
biogenic sources such as trees.1 
As described above, organic carbon has both primary and secondary components. The 
percentage contribution to total OC from directly emitted OC versus secondarily formed OC 
varies based on location. In an urban area, near direct sources of OC such as cars, trucks, and 
industrial sources, the percentage of primary OC may dominate, whereas, in a rural area with 
more biogenic sources, OC may be mostly secondarily formed. In addition, emissions from 
sources such as power plants and industrial facilities may have small amounts of directly 
emitted PM2.5 speciated into sulfate. Figure 2-1 (EPA, 2006) shows, in detail, the sources 
contributing to directly emitted PM2.5 and PM10, as well as PM precursors: SO2, NOx, NH3, and 
VOC.

2.2.1 PM2.5 
“Fine particles” or PM2.5 are particles with diameters that are less than 2.5 micrometers. 
As discussed above, these particles are composed of both primary (derived directly from 
emissions) and secondary (derived from atmospheric reactions involving gaseous precursors) 
components. 
2.2.1.1 Geographical Scale and Transport 
Both local and regional sources contribute to particle pollution. Fine particles can be 
transported long distances by wind and weather and can be found in the air thousands of miles 
from where they formed. Nitrates and sulfates formed from NOx and SO2 are generally 
transported over wide areas leading to substantial background contributions in urban areas. 
Organic carbon, which has both a primary and secondary component, can also be transported 
but to a far lesser degree. In general, higher concentrations of elemental carbon and crustal 
matter are found closest to the sources of these emissions. 
Figure 2-2 shows how much of the PM2.5 mass can be attributed to local versus regional 
sources for 13 selected urban areas (EPA, 2004).2 In each of these urban areas, monitoring sites 
were paired with nearby rural sites. When the average rural concentration is subtracted from 
the measured urban concentration, the estimated local and regional contributions become 
apparent. We observe a large urban excess across the U.S. for most PM2.5 species but especially 
for total carbon mass with Fresno, CA having the highest observed measure. Larger urban 
excess of nitrates is seen in the western U.S. with Fresno, CA and Salt Lake City, UT significantly 
higher than all other areas. These results indicate that local sources of these pollutants are 
indeed contributing to the PM2.5 air quality problem in these areas. As expected for a 
predominately regional pollutant, only a modest urban excess is observed for sulfates. 
In the East, regional pollution contributes to more than half of total PM2.5 
concentrations. Rural background PM2.5 concentrations are high in the East and are somewhat 
uniform over large geographic areas. These regional concentrations come from emission 
sources such as power plants, natural sources, and urban pollution and can be transported 
hundreds of miles and reflect to some extent the denser clustering of urban areas in the East as 
compared to the West. In the West, much of the measured PM2.5 concentrations tend to be 
local in nature. These concentrations come from emission sources such as wood combustion 
and mobile sources. In general, these data indicate that reducing regional SO2 and local sources

of carbon in the East, and local sources of nitrate and carbon in the West will be most effective 
in reducing PM2.5 concentrations.

2.2.1.2 Regional and Seasonal Patterns 
The chemical makeup of particles varies across the United States, as illustrated in 
Figure 2-3. For example, the higher regional emissions of SO2 in the East result in higher 
absolute and relative amounts of sulfates as compared to the western U.S. Fine particles in 
southern California generally contain more nitrates than other areas of the country. Carbon is a 
substantial component of fine particles everywhere.

Derived Using the SANDWICH Method. Data from the 42 monitoring locations shown on the 
map were stratified by region and season including cool months (October–April) and warm 
months (May–September) 
Fine particles can also have a seasonal pattern. As shown in Figure 2-3, PM2.5 values in 
the eastern half of the United States are typically higher in warmer weather when 
 2-7 
meteorological conditions are more favorable for the formation and build up of sulfates from 
higher sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants in that region. Fine particle 
concentrations tend to be higher in the cooler calendar months in urban areas in the West, in 
part because fine particle nitrates and carbonaceous particles are more readily formed in cooler 
weather, and wood stove and fireplace use increases direct emissions of carbon. 
2.2.1.3 Composition of PM2.5 as Measured by the Federal Reference Method 
The speciation measurements in the preceding analyses represented data from EPA’s 
Speciation Trends Network, along with adjustments to reflect the fine particle mass associated 
with these ambient measurements. In order to more accurately predict the change in PM2.5 
design values for particular emission control scenarios, EPA characterizes the composition of 
PM2.5 as measured by the Federal Reference Method (FRM). The current PM2.5 FRM does not 
capture all ambient particles measured by speciation samplers as presented in the previous 
sections. The FRM-measured fine particle mass reflects losses of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) 
and other semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs; negative artifacts). It also includes particle-
bound water (PBW) associated with hygroscopic species (positive artifacts) (Frank, 2006). 
Comparison of FRM and collocated speciation sampler NO3- values in Table 2-1 show that 
annual average NO3 retention in FRM samples for six cities varies from 15% in Birmingham to 
76% in Chicago, with an annual average loss of 1 µg/m3. The volatilization is a function of 
temperature and relative humidity (RH), with more loss at higher temperatures and lower RH. 
Accordingly, nitrate is mostly retained during the cold winter days, while little may be retained 
during the hot summer days. 
PM2.5 FRM measurements also include water associated with hygroscopic aerosol. This 
is because the method derives fine particle concentrations from sampled mass equilibrated at 
20–23 °C and 30–40% RH. At these conditions, the hygroscopic aerosol collected at more humid 
environments will retain their particle-bound water. The water content is higher for more acidic 
and sulfate-dominated aerosols. Combining the effects of reduced nitrate and hydrated aerosol 
causes the estimated nitrate and sulfate FRM mass to differ from the measured ions simply 
expressed as dry ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate. The composition of FRM mass is 
denoted as SANDWICH based on the Sulfate, Adjusted Nitrate Derived Water and Inferred 
Carbon approach from which they are derived. The PM2.5 mass estimated from speciated 
measurements of fine particles is termed ReConstructed Fine Mass (RCFM). The application of 
SANDWICH adjustments to speciation measurements at six sites is illustrated in Table 2-1 and 
Figure 2-4. EPAs modeling incorporates these SANDWICH adjustments in the Model Attainment 
Test Software (MATS) (Abt, 2010).

The annual and 24-hour PM2.5 design values were calculated using 2003–2007 FRM 
24-hour average PM2.5 concentration measurements and consistent with CFR Part 50.3 
Figures 2-5 and 2-6 show the county-level maximum values for both the annual and 24-hour 
standards, respectively. For the most part, counties in the center of the U.S. have PM2.5 design 
values that are above both 11 µg/m3 for the annual standard and 30 µg/m3 for the 24-hour 
standard. In the East, the counties above the current NAAQS (i.e., 15 µg/m3 annual and 35 
µg/m3 24-hour standards) are similar. In the West, there are fewer counties above the annual 
level of 15 µg/m3 than exceed the 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3.

3 These years of ambient measurements were selected since they frame the air quality model year of 2005. As 
discussed in Chapter 3, it is most appropriate to select ambient measurement years that include the model year 
to allow for a more true projection of future year air quality using the air quality model.

2.2.2 Visibility 
Air pollution can affect light extinction, a measure of how much the components of the 
atmosphere scatter and absorb light. More light extinction means that the clarity of visual 
images and visual range is reduced, all else held constant. Light extinction is the optical 
characteristic of the atmosphere that occurs when light is either scattered or absorbed, which 
converts the light to heat. Particulate matter and gases can both scatter and absorb light. Fine 
particles with significant light-extinction efficiencies include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, 
elemental carbon, and soil (Sisler, 1996). The extent to which any amount of light extinction 
affects a person’s ability to view a scene depends on both scene and light characteristics. For 
example, the appearance of a nearby object (e.g., a building) is generally less sensitive to a 
change in light extinction than the appearance of a similar object at a greater distance. See 
Figure 2-7 for an illustration of the important factors affecting visibility. 
 2-11 
 
Figure 2-7. Important Factors Involved in Seeing a Scenic Vista 
Source: Malm, 1999. 
2.2.2.1 Calculating Visibility 
Visibility degradation is often directly proportional to decreases in light transmittal in 
the atmosphere. Scattering and absorption by both gases and particles decrease light 
transmittance. To quantify changes in visibility, our analysis computes a light-extinction 
coefficient, based on the work of Sisler (1996), which shows the total fraction of light that is 
decreased per unit distance. This coefficient accounts for the scattering and absorption of light 
by both particles and gases, and accounts for the higher extinction efficiency of fine particles 
compared to coarse particles. Fine particles with significant light-extinction efficiencies include 
sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon (soot), and soil (Sisler, 1996). 
As described in the Policy Assessment Document (EPA, 2011), the formula for total light 
extinction (bext) in units of Mm-1 using the original IMPROVE equation is: 
 𝑏ext =  3 x 𝑓(RH) x [𝑆𝑢𝑙𝑓𝑎𝑡𝑒]  +  3 x 𝑓(RH) x [𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒] +  4 x [𝑂𝑟𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑐 𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠]  + 10 x [𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛]  +  1 x [𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙]  +  0.6 x [Coarse Mass] +  10   (2.1) 
 2-12 
where the mass concentrations of the components indicated in brackets are in units of μg/m3, 
and f(RH) is the unitless water growth term that depends on relative humidity. The final term in 
the equation is known as the Rayleigh scattering term and accounts for light scattering by the 
natural gases in unpolluted air. Since IMPROVE does not include ammonium ion monitoring, the 
assumption is made that all sulfate is fully neutralized ammonium sulfate and all nitrate is 
assumed to be ammonium nitrate. 
Based upon the light-extinction coefficient, a unitless visibility index, called a “deciview,” 
can also be calculated using Equation (2.2): 
 𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠 = 10 ∗ ln �391
𝑉𝑅
� = 10 ∗ ln �βext
10
�  (2.2) 
where VR denotes visual range (in kilometers) and βext denotes light extinction (in Mm-1). The 
deciview metric provides a scale for perceived visual changes over the entire range of 
conditions, from clear to hazy. Under many scenic conditions, the average person can generally 
perceive a change of one deciview. The higher the deciview value, the worse the visibility. Thus, 
an improvement in visibility is a decrease in deciview value. 
2.2.2.2 Geographical Scale and Variability 
Annual average visibility conditions (reflecting light extinction due to both 
anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources) vary regionally across the U.S. and by season 
(U.S. EPA, 2009). Particulate sulfate is the dominant source of regional haze in the eastern U.S. 
(>50% of the particulate light extinction) and an important contributor to haze elsewhere in the 
country (>20% of particulate light extinction) (U.S. EPA, 2009). Particulate nitrate is an 
important contributor to light extinction in California and the upper Midwestern U.S., 
particularly during winter (U.S. EPA, 2009). Smoke plumes from large wildfires dominate many 
of the worst haze periods in the western U.S., while Asian dust only caused a few of the worst 
haze episodes, primarily in the more northerly regions of the west (U.S. EPA, 2009). Higher 
visibility impairment levels in the East are due to generally higher concentrations of fine 
particles, particularly sulfates, and higher average relative humidity levels (U.S. EPA, 2009). 
Humidity increases visibility impairment because some particles such as ammonium sulfate and 
ammonium nitrate absorb water and form droplets that become larger when relative humidity 
increases, thus resulting in increased light scattering (U.S. EPA, 2009). 
Figure 2-8 shows the average trends in visual ranges at select monitors in the eastern 
and western areas of the U.S. since 1992 using data from the IMPROVE monitoring network 
(U.S. EPA (2008); IMPROVE (2010)). Because trends in haze are closely associated with trends in 
 2-13 
particulate sulfate and nitrate due to the simple relationship between their concentration and 
light extinction, visibility trends have improved as emissions of SO2 and NOx have decreased 
overtime due to air pollution regulations such as the Acid Rain Program (U.S. EPA, 2009). For 
example, Figure 2-8 shows that visual range increased nearly 50% in the eastern U.S. since 
19924. While visibility trends have improved in most Class 1 areas5, the recent data show that 
these areas continue to suffer from visibility impairment (U.S. EPA, 2009). Calculated from light 
extinction efficiencies from Trijonis et al. (1987, 1988), annual average visual range under 
natural conditions in the East is estimated to be 150 km ± 45 km (i.e., 65 to 120 miles) and 230 
km ± 35 km (i.e., 120 to 165 miles) in the West (Irving, 1991).

The secondary PM2.5 NAAQS standard consists of three parts: a level, averaging period, 
and form. EPA proposes using a 3-year average, 90th percentile form for the standard, 
calculated using 24-hr speciated PM2.5 measurements. EPA analyzed two proposed levels of 30

20%, and the “worst days” are defined as the worst 20% of days (IMPROVE, 2010).

dv and 28 dv, as well as a more stringent standard of 25 dv. The ambient design values analyzed 
in this RIA are based on measured 24-hour PM2.5 speciation data from 2004–20066. These data 
were calculated as described in the Policy Assessment Document (EPA, 2011) and provided in 
Chapter 13. Figure 2-9 shows the county-level maximum design values. 20 counties were above 
30 dv and 90 counties were above 28 dv. For the more stringent proposed level, 77 additional 
counties were above 25 dv. The large majority of these counties are located in the East.

CHAPTER 3 
AIR QUALITY MODELING AND ANALYSIS 
3.1 Synopsis 
In order to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of trying to reach the 
alterative primary and secondary PM standards proposed in this RIA, it was necessary to use 
models to predict concentrations in the future. The data, tools and methodology used for 
projecting future-year air quality are described in this chapter, as well as the post-processing 
techniques used to produce a number of air quality metrics for input into the analysis of costs 
and benefits. 
3.2 Modeling PM2.5 Levels in the Future 
A national scale air quality modeling analysis was performed to estimate PM2.5 
concentrations for the annual and 24-hour primary standards and light extinction for the future 
year of 2020.1 Air quality ratios were then developed using model responsiveness to emissions 
changes between a recent year of air quality, 2005, and a future year of air quality, 2020. The 
air quality ratios were used to determine potential control scenarios designed to attain the 
proposed alternative NAAQS, as well as the costs of attaining these levels. These data were 
then used to estimate how air quality would change under each set of potential control 
scenarios, and as inputs to the calculation of expected benefits from the alternative NAAQS 
considered in this assessment. 
3.2.1 Air Quality Modeling Platform 
The 2005-based Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling platform was used 
as the tool to project future-year air quality for 2020 and to estimate the costs and benefits for 
attaining the current and proposed alternative NAAQS considered in this assessment. In 
addition to the CMAQ model, the modeling platform includes the emissions, meteorology, and 
initial and boundary condition data which are inputs to this model. 
The CMAQ model is a three-dimensional grid-based Eulerian air quality model designed 
to estimate the formation and fate of oxidant precursors, primary and secondary particulate 
matter concentrations and deposition over regional and urban spatial scales (e.g., over the 
contiguous U.S.) (Appel et al., 2008; Appel et al., 2007; Byun and Schere, 2006). Consideration 
                                                     
1 As described in more detail in this chapter, the future-year emissions inventory used in the air quality modeling 
analysis is a combination of emissions sectors projected to 2017 and 2020. We have chosen to label the future-
year of modeling as “2020” because the EGU sector, which is projected to 2020, is of significant importance to 
the concentrations of PM2.5 in the U.S.  
 3-2 
of the different processes (e.g., transport and deposition) that affect primary (directly emitted) 
and secondary (formed by atmospheric processes) PM at the regional scale in different 
locations is fundamental to understanding and assessing the effects of pollution control 
measures that affect PM, ozone and deposition of pollutants to the surface. Because it accounts 
for spatial and temporal variations as well as differences in the reactivity of emissions, CMAQ is 
useful for evaluating the impacts of the control strategies on PM2.5 concentrations. Version 
4.7.1 of CMAQ was employed for this RIA modeling, as described in the Air Quality Modeling 
Technical Support Document (EPA, 2011b). 
3.2.1.1 Air Quality Modeling Domain 
Figure 3-1 shows the modeling domains that were used as a part of this analysis. The 
geographic specifications for these domains are provided in Table 3-1. All three modeling 
domains contain 14 vertical layers with a top at about 16,200 meters, or 100 millibars (mb). 
Two domains with 12 km horizontal resolution were used for modeling the 2005 base year and 
2020 control strategy scenarios. These domains are labeled as the East and West 12 km 
domains in Figure 3-1. Simulations for the 36 km domain were only used to provide initial and 
boundary concentrations for the 12 km domains.

The model produces gridded air quality concentrations on an hourly basis for the entire 
modeling domain. For this analysis, predictions from the East domain were used to provide 
data for all areas that are east of approximately 104 degrees longitude. Model predictions from 
the West domain were used for all areas west of this longitude. 
3.2.1.2 Air Quality Model Inputs 
CMAQ requires a variety of input files that contain information pertaining to the 
modeling domain and simulation period. These include gridded, hourly emissions estimates and 
meteorological data, and initial and boundary conditions. Separate emissions inventories were 
prepared for the 2005 base year and the future year of 2020. All other inputs were specified for 
the 2005 base year model application and remained unchanged for each future-year modeling 
scenario. 
CMAQ requires detailed emissions inventories containing temporally allocated (i.e., 
hourly) emissions for each grid-cell in the modeling domain for a large number of chemical 
species that act as primary pollutants or precursors to secondary pollutants. The annual 
emission inventories, described in Section 3.2.2, were preprocessed into CMAQ-ready inputs 
using the SMOKE emissions preprocessing system. Meteorological inputs reflecting 2005 
conditions across the contiguous U.S. were derived from Version 5 of the Mesoscale Model 
(MM5). These inputs included hourly-varying horizontal wind components (i.e., speed and 
direction), temperature, moisture, vertical diffusion rates, and rainfall rates for each grid cell in 
each vertical layer. Details of the annual 2005 meteorological modeling are provided in the Air 
Quality Modeling Technical Support Document: Final EGU NESHAP (EPA, 2011d). 
The lateral boundary and initial species concentrations for the CMAQ simulations using 
a 36 km domain are provided by a three dimensional global atmospheric chemistry and 
transport model (GEOS-CHEM). The lateral boundary species concentrations varied with height 
and time (every 3 hours). These data were used in CMAQ for the 36 km domain. Initial and 
 3-4 
boundary concentrations from the CMAQ 36 km domain were then used to provide initial and 
boundary concentrations for CMAQ simulations using the East and West 12 km domains. The 
development of model inputs is discussed in greater detail in the Air Quality Modeling Technical 
Support Document: Final EGU NESHAP (EPA, 2011d). 
3.2.1.3 Air Quality Model Evaluation 
An operational model performance evaluation for PM2.5 and its related speciated 
components (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, elemental carbon, organic carbon) was performed to 
estimate the ability of the CMAQ modeling system to replicate 2005 base year concentrations. 
This evaluation principally comprises statistical assessments of model predictions versus 
observations paired in time and space on an hourly, 24-hour, or weekly basis depending on the 
sampling period of measured data. Details on the evaluation methodology and the calculation 
of performance statistics are provided in the Air Quality Modeling Technical Support Document: 
Final EGU NESHAP (EPA, 2011d). Overall, the model performance statistics for sulfate, nitrate, 
organic carbon, and elemental carbon from the CMAQ 2005 simulation are within or close to 
the ranges found in other recent applications. These model performance results give us 
confidence that our applications of CMAQ using this 2005 modeling platform provide a 
scientifically credible approach for assessing PM2.5 concentrations for the purposes of the RIA. 
3.2.2 Emissions Inventory 
The future-year base-case inventory, projected from the 2005 Version 4.3 emissions 
modeling platform, is the starting point for the baseline and control strategy for the Proposed 
PM NAAQS emissions inventory. The Emissions Modeling for the Final Mercury and Air Toxics 
Standard (MATS) TSD (EPA, 2011c) describes in detail the development of the 2005 base year 
inventory, the projection methodology, and the controls applied to create the projected 
inventory. Note that the referenced Emissions Modeling TSD describes the use of year 2015 
emissions for EGUs and 2017 emissions for other sources, while this analysis used 2020 
emissions for EGUs. 
The EGU projected inventory represents demand growth, fuel resource availability, 
generating technology cost and performance, and other economic factors affecting power 
sector behavior. It also reflects environmental rules and regulations, consent decrees and 
settlements, plant closures, and newly built units for the calendar year 2020. In this analysis, 
the projected EGU emissions include the Final MATS policy case announced on December 21, 
2011 and the Final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) issued on July 6, 2011. The EGU 
emissions were developed using version 4.10 Final MATS version of the Integrated Planning 
 3-5 
Model (IPM) and documented in detail at http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-
ipm/toxics.html. The IPM is a multiregional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming model 
of the U.S. electric power sector. Note that for this analysis, no further EGU control measures 
were selected for illustrating attainment of the current and proposed alternative standard 
levels, as discussed in Chapter 4, and the EGU emissions are unchanged between the future-
year base-case and control strategies. 
The mobile source emissions were projected to 2017 using activity data. These 
emissions represent the effects of the Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule, the Light-Duty Vehicle 
Tier 2 Rule, the Heavy Duty Diesel Rule, and other finalized rules. Table 3-2 provides a 
comprehensive list of the rules/control strategies and projection assumptions in the projected 
base-case (i.e., reference case) inventory. A full discussion of the future year base inventory is 
provided in the Emissions Modeling TSD. The 2017 onroad mobile source emissions were 
developed by using the MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES)2 to create emission factors 
that were then input to the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions system (SMOKE). The 
SMOKE-MOVES Integration Tools combined the county and temperature-specific emission 
factors with the activity data to compute the actual emissions based on hourly gridded 
temperature data. 
The future year scenarios include the same year 2006 Canada and year 1999 Mexico 
emissions as the 2005 base case. All 2005 and projected base case emissions inventories are 
available on the EPA’s Emissions Modeling Clearinghouse website at: 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/index.html#toxics. The inventories used to support this 
analysis can be found under ftp://ftp.epa.gov/EmisInventory/2005v4_3/mats.

3.3 Modeling Results and Analyses 
The air quality modeling results were used in the RIA to estimate future-year PM2.5 
concentrations for the 2020 base case and to calculate the air quality ratios that were used to 
determine potential control scenarios designed to attain the current and proposed alternative 
NAAQS. These data are then used to estimate the costs and benefits of attaining these current 
and proposed NAAQS levels. Consistent with EPA guidance (EPA, 2007), the air quality modeling 
results are applied in a relative sense to estimate 2020 future-year design values for PM2.5 and 
visibility for the base case as described in Sections 3.3.1.1 and 3.3.2.1. Air quality ratios are 
calculated using the changes in the 2005 and 2020 base case design values and emissions as 
described in Section 3.3.1.2. The data are then used to estimate the tons of emissions 
reductions needed to show attainment of the current and alternative NAAQS levels as 
 3-12 
described in Section 3.3.1.3 and in Chapter 4. Based on the tons of emissions needed in each 
county, annual standard design values are calculated for attaining the current and alternative 
standard levels for input into the benefits assessment as described in Section 3.3.1.4. 
Limitations of this approach are described in Section 3.3.1.5. 
Additional data were also processed to calculate visibility design values for the 2020 
base case. Details on this post-processing are discussed in Section 3.3.2. 
3.3.1 PM2.5 
As discussed in Chapter 1, this RIA evaluates the costs and benefits of attaining four 
alterative combinations of standards relative to meeting the current primary PM2.5 standards 
(15/35). The five alterative combinations of standards evaluated are: an annual standard level 
of 14 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the current 24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 
(14/35); an annual standard level of 13 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the current 24-hour 
standard level at 35 µg/m3 (13/35); an annual standard level of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with 
retaining the current 24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (12/35); an annual standard level of 11 
µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the current 24-hour standard level at 35 µg/m3 (11/35); 
and an annual standard level of 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with a 24-hour standard level of 30 
µg/m3 (11/30). We modeled to project future-year PM2.5 concentrations for a 2020 base case 
using CMAQ and then estimated the air quality concentrations for meeting 15/35, 14/35, 
13/35, 12/35, 11/35 and 11/30 using air quality ratios. 
3.3.1.1 Calculating Future-year Design Values for 2020 Base Case 
To estimate costs of attaining the alternative NAAQS, we use air quality modeling results 
to predict the impact of the control strategies on future-year attainment. This is done by using 
the air quality model results in a relative sense, as recommended by the EPA modeling guidance 
(EPA, 2007), and estimating future-year PM2.5 relative reduction factors (RRFs). RRFs are ratios 
that are calculated from the changes in PM2.5 species concentrations between recent-year and 
future-year air quality modeling results. RRFs are calculated for each PM2.5 component. Future-
year estimates of the PM2.5 annual and 24-hour standard design values at monitor locations are 
then calculated by applying the species-specific RRFs to ambient PM2.5 concentrations from the 
IMPROVE Network, the Speciated Trends Network (STN), and the Federal Reference Method 
(FRM) Network. 
To more easily apply this methodology, EPA has created software, called Modeled 
Attainment Test Software (MATS) (Abt, 2010), to calculate future-year PM2.5 annual and 24-
hour standard design values. For this RIA, the RRFs are based on the changes in modeled 
 3-13 
concentrations between the 2005 and 2020 base case. Ambient measurements used in MATS 
are from IMPROVE and STN sites for 2004–2006 and FRM sites for 2003–2007. Output from 
MATS includes the projected future-year annual and 24-hour standard design values, as well as 
percentage sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon, organic carbon and crustal matter 
contributing to the annual and 24-hour standard design values for each site. These data are 
useful to better understand the PM species contributing to high PM2.5 concentrations and to 
help determine what control measures might be most effective in reducing the future-year 
design values to the proposed levels. Annual and 24-hour standard design values for 2005 and 
2020 base case are discussed in Chapter 4 and shown in Appendix 4. 
3.3.1.2 Calculating Future-year Design Values for Meeting the Current Standard and Proposed 
Alternative Standard Levels 
To estimate the tons of emissions reductions needed to reach attainment of the current 
and proposed alternative standard levels, we calculated air quality ratios based on how 
modeled concentrations changed with changes in emissions between a recent year of air 
quality, 2005, and the future year of air quality, 2020. These air quality ratios represent an 
estimate of how the annual standard design value at a monitor would change in response to 
emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, or direct PM2.5. Below are the details of how these air quality 
ratios were estimated. 
To calculate the air quality ratios for changes in response to emissions reductions of SO2 
and NOx we used the following methodology. 
Step 1: The speciated changes in annual standard design values between 20053 and 
2020 were obtained from the MATS (Abt, 2010) output files. For each monitor, we computed 
the percent change in the NH4SO4 and NH4NO34 components of the annual standard design 
value between 2005 and 2020, relative to the 2005 monitor annual standard design value. 
Step 2: For NH4SO41 and NH4NO33 components, we computed the change in emissions of 
SO2 and NOx used in the air quality modeling for the 2005 and 2020 base case for groups of 
                                                     
3As described previously in this section, the “2005” annual design values are based on ambient measurements 
used in MATS from IMPROVE and STN sites for 2004–2006 and FRM sites for 2003–2007. These years of 
ambient measurements were selected since they frame the air quality model year of 2005. Because the air 
quality model is used to predict the change in design values between recent and projected future year air 
quality, with the modeled RRFs being applied to the recent year measured design values, it is important to 
select ambient measurement years that include the model year to allow a more true prediction of the future 
year air quality. 
4The NH4SO4 and NH4NO3 components are computed using the SO4, NO3, NH4 and water fraction from MATS as 
described in EPA guidance (EPA, 2007). 
 3-14 
adjacent counties. This larger grouping of counties allowed us to better represent the more 
regional nature of NH4SO4 and NH4NO3 formation and transport. These groupings of counties 
were selected by including all counties within a state that bordered a county with a monitor 
above the current or proposed alternative standard levels. For the state of California, where 
these groupings could have expanded to include most of the counties within the state if we had 
used the same selection criteria, we determined smaller groupings to more realistically 
represent the area around a monitor from which emissions reductions would most influence 
changes in the design value. This smaller grouping was also done for counties in Utah5. These 
groups are listed in Appendix 4, Table 4.A-5. 
Step 3: Using the data from Steps 1 and 2, we computed the percent change in the 
NH4SO4 component of the annual standard design value at each monitor per reduction of 1000 
tons of SO2 emissions in the surrounding counties between the 2005 and 2020 base case air 
quality and emissions data. Similarly, we computed the percent change in the annual standard 
NH4NO3 component of the design value at each monitor per change in 1000 tons of NOx 
emissions in the surrounding counties. 
Step 4: The data from Step 3 are then used to compute the median value for all 
monitors within the grouping of counties of the percent change in the NH4SO4 and NH4NO3 
components of the annual standard design value per change in tons of SO2 and NO3 emissions, 
respectively. This gives us an estimate for each grouping of monitors that indicates the 
response of the sulfate and nitrate components of the annual standard design values to 
changes in SO2 and NOx emissions, relative to the PM2.5 speciation at the monitor. 
Step 5: The percent change values from Step 4 are then multiplied by the NH4SO4 and 
NH4NO3 speciation values at each monitor in the 2020 base case to produce the “air quality 
ratios.” These data give an estimate of how the annual standard design value (µg/m3) at a 
monitor would change if 1000 tons of SO2 and/or NOx emissions were reduced in the county in 
which the monitor is located. 
To calculate the air quality ratios for changes in response to emissions reductions of 
direct PM2.5 we follow the following methodology. 
                                                     
5 To determine the counties for the smaller groupings in California and Utah, we simply grouped counties together 
geographically with a minimum of two counties allowed in each of the smaller groupings.  
 3-15 
Step 1: The speciated changes in annual standard design values between 20056 and 
2020 were obtained from the MATS (Abt, 2010) output files. For each monitor, we computed 
the percent change in the direct PM2.57 components of the annual standard design value 
between 2005 and 2020, relative to 2005 monitor annual standard design value. 
Step 2: We computed the change in emissions of direct PM2.5 in the emissions inventory 
data used in the air quality modeling for the 2005 and 2020 base case for each county. 
Step 3: Using the data from Steps 1 and 2, we computed the percent change in the 
annual standard direct PM2.5 component of the design value at each monitor per change in tons 
of direct PM2.5 emissions at the county level. 
Step 4: The data from Step 3 are then used to compute the median value of the percent 
change in the PM2.5 component of the annual standard design value per change in tons of direct 
PM2.5 emissions for all monitors within the grouping of counties used to compute the SO2 and 
NOx air quality ratios (see Appendix 4, Table 4.A-5) within a state. We now have an estimate for 
each grouping of monitors that indicates the response of the direct PM2.5 components of the 
annual standard design values to changes in direct PM2.5 emissions, relative to the PM2.5 
speciation at each monitor. 
Step 5: The percent change values from Step 4 are then multiplied by the direct PM2.5 
speciation values at each monitor in the 2020 base case to produce air quality ratios. 
Step 6: The responsiveness of air quality at a specific monitor location to direct PM2.5 
emission reductions will depend on several factors including the specific meteorology and 
topography in an area and the nearness of the emissions source to the monitor. Because of the 
more local influence of changes in directly emitted PM2.5 emissions on air quality, a monitor 
where significant changes in direct PM2.5 emissions occurred between 2005 and 2020 due to 
sources very close to a monitor can result in large non-representative values in Step 5. A large 
change suggests the monitor is more responsive to PM2.5 emissions reductions than it actually 
                                                     
6As described previously in this section, the “2005” annual design values are based on ambient measurements 
used in MATS from IMPROVE and STN sites for 2004–2006 and FRM sites for 2003–2007. These years of 
ambient measurements were selected since they frame the air quality model year of 2005. Because the air 
quality model is used to predict the change in design values between recent and projected future year air 
quality, with the modeled RRFs being applied to the recent year measured design values, it is important to 
select ambient measurement years that include the model year to allow a more true prediction of the future 
year air quality. 
7The direct PM2.5 design value component is computed by summing the elemental carbon, organic carbon and 
crustal portions of the design value.

would be if those reductions were applied further away from the monitor. Given that the air 
quality ratios must be applicable to multiple monitors across each county and must be 
applicable for emissions reductions where we may not know the specific source location (e.g., 
extrapolated emissions reductions), the air quality ratios we employ should not be strongly 
influenced by very local emissions changes which may have a much larger, non-representative 
impact on air quality at the nearby monitor. To remedy this and obtain representative values 
for air quality ratios, we separated all the counties for which PM2.5 air quality ratios were 
computed (as shown in Table 4.A-10) into four areas of the country: East, West, Northern 
California, and Southern California as shown in Table 3-38. We then computed a single 
“trimmed” median PM2.5 ratio for each of the four areas after removing the highest ten percent 
of the values in each area. That is, we calculated the median value of all the PM2.5 air quality 
ratios in each area over counties for which air quality ratios had been calculated after the 
highest ten percent of the values were removed. The resulting PM2.5 air quality ratios that are 
used for all monitors in the four areas are shown in Table 3-3. These data give an estimate of 
how the annual standard design value (µg/m3) at a monitor would change if 1000 tons of direct 
PM2.5 emissions were reduced in the county in which the monitor is located.

To be able to estimate how the 24-hour standard design value would change in

design value to the change in the 24-hour standard design value between 2005 and 2020 base 
case for each monitor, and then use these data to compute the average value for all monitors 
within a state that are included within a grouping shown in Appendix 4, Table 4.A-5. The end 
result is an estimate for each state of the expected change in the 24-hour standard design value 
per 1 µg/m3 change in the annual standard design value. These values varied from state-to-
state but in general, a 1 µg/m3 change in the annual standard design value corresponded to a 
2–3 µg/m3 change in the 24-hour standard design value at the same monitor. Tables of these 
values are provided with the air quality ratios in Chapter 4. 
3.3.1.3 Estimating Emissions Reductions and Costs of Attaining the Current and Proposed 
Alternative PM2.5 Standards 
The air quality ratios described in Section 3.3.1.2 are used to determine the most 
effective control measures for reducing the annual and 24-hour standard design values to 
meeting the current and proposed alternative standard levels. The total amount of SO2, NOx 
and/or direct PM2.5 emissions reduced per county, based on the control measures selected for 
each strategy, are then used in conjunction with the air quality ratios to estimate how the 
annual and 24-hour standard design values would change in the counties with emissions 
reductions. The details of control measure selections and their associated costs are described in 
Chapter 4. 
3.3.1.4 Estimating Changes in Annual Average PM2.5 for Benefits Inputs 
MATS (Abt, 2010) can also provide gridded fields of changes in annual average PM2.5 
concentrations for the entire CMAQ 12km domain. MATS does this by calculating RRFs at every 
grid cell within the CMAQ domain for each future-year control scenario, and applying these 
RRFs to ambient data that have been interpolated to cover all grid cells in the modeling 
domain. The basic interpolation technique, called Voronoi Neighbor Averaging (VNA), identifies 
the set of monitors that are nearest to the center of each CMAQ grid cell, and then takes an 
inverse distance squared weighted average of the monitor concentrations. A “fused” spatial 
field is then calculated by adjusting the interpolated ambient data (in each grid cell) up or down 
by a multiplicative factor calculated as the ratio of the modeled concentration at the grid cell 
divided by the modeled concentration at the nearest neighbor monitor locations (weighted by 
distance). We use the 2005 and 2020 base case CMAQ modeling outputs, in conjunction with 
the ambient measurements from the IMPROVE and STN sites for 2004–2006 and FRM sites for 
2003–2007, to create a spatial surface for the 2020 base case. 
 3-18 
To generate spatial surfaces that represent annual average PM2.5 concentrations when 
attaining the current and proposed alternative standard levels for the benefits analysis, we 
need to adjust the 2020 base case spatial surface to reflect attainment of the current and 
alternative standard levels. Given the MATS gridded annual average PM2.5 concentrations for 
the CMAQ 12km domain and projected design values at monitors, the “monitor rollback” 
approach is used to approximate the air quality change resulting from attaining alternative 
NAAQS at each design value monitor. Figure 3-2 depicts the rollback process. This approach 
aims to estimate the change in population exposure associated with attaining an alternate 
NAAQS, relying on data from the existing monitoring network and the inverse distance variant 
of the VNA interpolation method to adjust the CMAQ-modeled concentrations such that each 
area attains the standard alternatives. Using the VNA spatial averaging technique, the annual 
average PM2.5 spatial surface is smoothed to minimize sharp gradients in PM2.5 concentrations 
in the spatial fields due to changes in the monitor concentrations. 
3.3.1.5 Limitations of Using Air Quality Ratios 
There are important limitations to the methodology of calculating and using air quality 
ratios to predict the response of air quality to emissions changes. The air quality ratios are 
calculated with results from only two CMAQ model runs and are based on the assumption that 
the monitor design values would decrease with additional reductions in emissions of SO2, NOx 
and direct PM2.5 in the future similar to how the two CMAQ model runs predicted changes in air 
quality concentrations. The uncertainty of this assumption will increase with increasing 
emissions reductions needed to estimate attainment. In addition, the model response to 
emissions changes are analyzed at a county-level or within a small group of counties, and we 
assume that air quality concentrations at a monitor will decrease linearly with emissions 
reductions in a county (e.g., direct PM2.5 emission reductions) or a group of counties (e.g., SO2 
and NOx emissions reductions). Because of the more local influence of changes in directly 
emitted PM2.5 emissions on air quality, it is also particularly difficult for the air quality ratio 
approach to estimate well how the design value at a monitor in a county would respond to 
changes in direct PM2.5 emissions in a county without knowing the location of the source (e.g., 
extrapolated emissions reductions) relative to the location of the monitor. 
The exact impact of using this methodology to estimate the emissions reductions 
needed for attainment and the associated effect on the cost and benefits is uncertain and may 
vary from monitor-to-monitor. We do not believe that this methodology tends towards any 
general trend and does not always result in either an underestimation or overestimation of the 
costs and benefits of attaining the proposed alternative standards.

natural gases in unpolluted air. Since IMPROVE does not include ammonium ion monitoring, the 
assumption is made that all sulfate is fully neutralized ammonium sulfate and all nitrate is 
assumed to be ammonium nitrate. Using equation (3.1), light extinction (bext) can then be 
converted into units of deciviews, a scale frequently used in the scientific and regulatory 
literature on visibility. 
3.3.2.1 Calculating Future-year Visibility Design Values for 2020 Base Case 
The visibility design value calculations are based on 24-hour averages and the 90th 
percentile format. To estimate future-year visibility design values, we use the air quality 
modeling results in a relative sense, as recommended by the EPA modeling guidance (EPA, 
2007), and estimate future-year relative reduction factors (RRFs) for each speciated component 
of the light extinction (bext) equation. To be consistent with visibility calculations described in 
the Policy Assessment Document (EPA, 2011a), which focuses on PM2.5 visibility, we do not 
include coarse mass (PM10-2.5) in the calculation. The steps for projecting the future-year 
visibility design values are described below. 
Step 1: We extract 24-hour averages of sulfate, nitrate, organic mass, elemental carbon 
and fine soil for the 2020 future-year modeled base case for each CMAQ grid cell in which a STN 
monitor is located. For the assumption that sulfate is fully neutralized and all nitrate is assumed 
to be ammonium nitrate, we multiply 24-hour average sulfate mass by 1.375 and nitrate mass 
by 1.29. 
Step 2: For the Regional Haze Program, there exists a gridded file of monthly averaged 
f(RH) climatological mean values.9 Using these data, we assign a f(RH) values to each STN 
monitor for each season10 by averaging the 3 monthly f(RH) values in each season using the 
data from the closest available data point. 
Step 3: Using the data from Step 1 &2, we calculate bext for every day in the 2005 
modeled base case using equation (3.1) without the coarse mass component. 
Step 4: For every season, we extract the top 10% worst modeled visibility days (i.e., top 
9 days) in 2005 based on their bext values. Using the species concentrations for these nine

maximum bext days, we calculate the average species specific bext value for each season for each 
monitor location. 
Step 5: We repeat step 3 for each of the future-year modeled scenario, and extract the 
same calendar days that were selected in step 4 for 2005. 
Step 6: Using the data from steps 4 and 5, we calculate the species specific Relative 
Response Factors (RRFs) for each monitor in each season for each of the future-year modeled 
scenario. This is done by dividing the average speciated bext value for the top 10% worse 
visibility days for each season for every monitor in each future-year scenario by the average 
species specific concentration for same the season for every monitor in 2005. In this way, we 
will have an RRF for every monitor for each season for each future-year control scenario. 
Step 7: The set of seasonal RRFs for each monitor for each future-year control scenario 
are applied to the corresponding 2004–2006 ambient data11 and the 90th percentile value is 
extracted. The end result is a set of visibility design values for each future-year scenario. 
3.3.2.2 Calculating Future-year Visibility Design Values for Meeting the Current and Proposed 
Alternative Standard Levels 
It is important to understand how changes in the PM2.5 design values to simulate full 
attainment for each proposed alternative NAAQS will affect visibility design values. 
As described in Section 3.3.1.2, we apply a methodology of air quality ratios to estimate 
the emissions reductions needed to meet the current and proposed alternative levels for the 
primary standard for PM2.5. While this methodology can estimate how the emissions reductions 
in each control scenario will affect changes in the future-year annual design values, and the 
corresponding response of the future-year 24-hour design values to these changes in the 
annual design value, it is unable to estimate how each of the PM2.5 species will change with 
these emission reductions. Given that estimating changes in future-year visibility is dependent 
on the IMPROVE equation (3.1) and how the PM2.5 species are projected to change in time, we 
are unable to estimate visibility design values for meeting the current and proposed alternative 
levels for the primary PM2.5 standard. 
                                                     
11 These years of ambient measurements were selected since they frame the air quality model year of 2005. 
Because the air quality model is used to predict the change in design values between recent and projected 
future year air quality, with the modeled RRFs being applied to the recent year measured design values, it is 
important to select ambient measurement years that include the model year to allow a more true prediction of 
the future year air quality.

3.3.2.3 Estimating Changes in Visibility for Analyzing Welfare Benefits 
The visibility calculations for the welfare benefits assessment are based on 24-hour 
average light extinction (bext) values, averaged over the year and converted to units of 
deciviews. As described in Sections 3.3.2.1 and 3.3.2.2, we calculated the visibility design values 
for the 2020 base case but were unable to estimate how these visibility design values would 
change for meeting the current and proposed alternative levels for the primary PM2.5 standard. 
In this same way, we are unable to estimate the light extinction values for meeting the current 
and proposed alternative levels for the primary PM2.5 standard, which are needed to assess

CHAPTER 4 
CONTROL STRATEGIES 
4.1 Synopsis 
In order to estimate the costs and benefits of alternative PM2.5 standards, the U.S. EPA 
has analyzed hypothetical control strategies that areas across the country might employ to 
attain alternative more stringent annual standards of 13, 12, and 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with 
retaining the 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3, as well as an alternative more stringent annual 
standard of 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with an alternative more stringent 24-hour standard of 30 
µg/m3 (referred to as 13/35, 12/35, 11/35, and 11/30). The U.S. EPA also analyzed a 14/35 
alternative standard and determined that all counties would meet such a standard concurrent 
with meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no additional costs and with no additional benefits 
because of significant air quality improvements from the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards 
(MATS), the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), and other Clean Air Act rules as described in 
Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2. Thus, there is no need to present an analysis of 14/35. 
For the purposes of this discussion, it will be helpful to define some terminology. These 
definitions are specific to this analysis: 
 Base Case—Emissions projected to the year 2020 reflecting current state and federal 
programs, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and the Mercury and Air 
Toxics Standards. This does not include control programs specifically for the purpose 
of attaining the current PM2.5 standard (15/35). 
 Baseline—Emissions projections to the year 2020 reflecting the base case plus 
additional emission reductions needed to reach attainment of the current PM2.5 
Standard (15/35). 
 Alternative Standard Analysis—Emission reductions and associated hypothetical 
controls needed to reach attainment of the alternative standards. These reductions 
and controls are incremental to the baseline. 
 Design Value—A metric that is compared to the level of the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standard (NAAQS) to determine compliance. Design values are typically used 
to classify nonattainment areas, assess progress towards meeting the NAAQS, and 
develop control strategies. The design value for the annual PM2.5 standard is 
calculated as the 3-year average of annual means for a single monitoring site or a 
group of monitoring sites. The design value for the 24-hour standard is calculated as 
the 3-year average of annual 98th percentile 24-hour average values recorded at 
each monitoring site. 
 4-2 
The U.S. EPA has analyzed the impact that additional emissions controls across 
numerous sectors would have on predicted ambient PM2.5 concentrations incremental to a 
baseline, which includes the current PM2.5 standard as well as other major rules such as CSAPR 
and MATS. Thus, the analysis for a revised standard focuses specifically on incremental 
improvements beyond the current standard and other existing major rules, and uses control 
options that might be available to states for application by 2020. The hypothetical control 
strategies presented in this RIA represent illustrative options for achieving emissions reductions 
to move towards a national attainment of a tighter standard. It is not a recommendation for 
how a tighter PM2.5 standard should be implemented, and states will make all final decisions 
regarding implementation strategies once a final NAAQS has been established. 
In order to analyze these hypothetical control strategies incremental to attainment of 
the current standard and beyond other existing major rules, the U.S. EPA employed a multi-
stage approach. First, the U.S. EPA identified controls to be included in the base case (e.g., 
reflecting current standard of 15/35) to reflect current state and federal programs. Next 
additional controls were applied to attain the current PM2.5 standard. The current state and 
federal programs combined with the additional controls needed for attainment of the current 
PM2.5 standard make up the baseline for this analysis. Once the baseline was established, we 
applied additional known controls within counties containing a monitor predicted to exceed the 
standard alternatives of 13/35, 12/35, 11/35, and 11/30 so as to bring them into attainment 
with the various alternatives in 2020.1 This chapter presents the hypothetical control strategies 
and the results in 2020 after their application. For most of these alternative standards, 
application of known control measures did not achieve attainment. In such cases, additional 
emission reductions beyond the capability of known controls were estimated in order to reach 
full attainment. 
4.2 PM2.5 Control Strategy Analysis 
4.2.1 Establishing the Baseline 
The RIA is intended to evaluate the costs and benefits of reaching attainment with 
alternative PM2.5 standards. In order to develop and evaluate hypothetical control strategies for 
attaining a more stringent primary standard, it is important to first estimate PM2.5 levels in 
20202 given the current NAAQS standards (15/35) and trends. This scenario is known as the

where reductions were applied.

baseline. Establishing this baseline allows us to estimate the incremental costs and benefits of 
attaining any alternative primary standard. 
The baseline includes reductions already achieved as a result of national regulations, 
reductions expected prior to 2020 from recently promulgated national regulations3 (i.e., 
reductions that were not realized before 2005 but are expected prior to attainment of the 
current PM standard), and reductions from additional controls which the U.S. EPA estimates 
need to be included to attain the current standard (15/35). Reductions achieved as a result of 
state and local agency regulations and voluntary programs are reflected to the extent that they 
are represented in emission inventory information submitted to the U.S. EPA by state and local 
agencies4. Two steps were used to develop the baseline. First, the reductions expected in 
national PM2.5 concentrations from national rules promulgated prior to this analysis were 
considered (referred to as the base case). Below is a list of some of the major national rules 
reflected in the base case. Refer to Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2 for a more detailed discussion of 
the rules reflected in the base case emissions inventory.

3 The recently proposed Boiler MACT and CISWI reconsiderations are not included in the base case. These rules 
were not yet proposed at the time of this analysis. It is not clear how the geographic scope of this rule will 
match with the counties analyzed for this RIA—the costs may decrease but the magnitude is uncertain. 
4 The amendments to the Low Emissions Vehicle Program (LEV-III) in California are not included in the base case. 
This program requires an approval of U.S. EPA via a waiver. At the time of this analysis the waiver had not been 
submitted.

 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (U.S. EPA, 2011) 
 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (U.S. EPA, 2011) 
Note that we did not conduct this analysis incremental to controls applied as part of 
previous NAAQS analyses (e.g., O3, NOx, or SO2) because the data and modeling on which these 
previous analyses were based are now considered outdated and are not compatible with the 
current PM2.5 NAAQS analysis. In addition, all control strategies analyzed in NAAQS RIAs are 
hypothetical. Second, because the base case reductions alone were not predicted to bring all 
areas into attainment with the current standard (2 counties are projected to exceed an 
alternative standard of 13/35 and 18 counties are projected to exceed an alternative standard 
of 12/35—see Section 4.2.2.1 for more details), the U.S. EPA used a hypothetical control 
strategy to apply additional known controls to illustrate attainment with the current PM2.5 
standard. Additional control measures were used in two sectors to establish the baseline:5 Non-
Electricity Generating Unit Point Sources (Non-EGUs) and Non-Point Area Sources (Area). 
The 2020 baseline for this analysis presents one scenario of future year air quality based 
upon specific control measures, including federal rules such as CSAPR and MATS, years of air 
quality monitoring and emissions data. This analysis presents one illustrative strategy relying on 
the identified federal measures and other strategies that states may employ. States may 
ultimately employ other strategies and/or other federal rules may be adopted that would also 
help in achieving attainment. The U.S. EPA plans to issue the final rule no later than December 
14, 2012 and intends to complete designations two years following promulgation of the final 
rule. Under the Clean Air Act, States are required to submit State implementation plans within 3 
years of the effective date of the designations. The plans are required to show attainment as 
expeditiously as practicable but no later than 5 years following the effective date of the 
designations, with the possibility, in certain cases, of an attainment date up to 10 years from 
the effective date of the designations, considering the severity of air quality concentrations in 
the area and the availability and feasibility of emission control measures. Designations will 
likely be based on air quality data from 2011-2013, but attainment will not occur until 2020 at 
                                                     
5 In establishing the baseline, the U.S. EPA selected a set of cost-effective controls to simulate attainment of the 
current PM2.5 standard. These control sets are hypothetical as states will ultimately determine controls as part 
of the SIP process.

the earliest. Thus EPA’s projections for control costs and benefits focus on the year 2020. The 
number of counties that will be part of the designations process may be different than the 
number of counties projected to exceed as part of this analysis. Refer to Section IX of the 
proposed PM2.5 NAAQS for more details concerning implementation requirements for the 
proposed NAAQS. 
Two maps of the country are presented in Figures 4-1 and 4-2, which show the 
predicted concentrations for year 2020 for the 575 counties with PM2.5 annual design values 
and 569 counties with 24-hour design values prior to applying controls to meet the current 
standard of 15/35. Control measures were applied to 14 counties in the baseline analysis to 
meet the current PM2.5 standard.

4.2.1.1 Controls Applied in the Baseline 
The purpose of identifying and analyzing hypothetical baseline controls for PM2.5 and its 
precursors is to establish a level of emissions associated with ambient concentrations that 
would meet the current PM2.5 standard. The additional known controls included in the baseline 
to simulate attainment with current PM2.5 NAAQS are listed in Table 4-1; details regarding the 
individual controls are provided in Appendix 4.A. Controls were applied to directly emitted 
PM2.5 and the PM2.5 precursors of NOx and SO2 given that nitrate, sulfate, and primary PM2.5 
species usually dominate measured PM2.5 based on speciation data measured at the Chemical 
Speciation Network (CSN) sites. Control measures that directly reduced emissions of PM2.5 were 
determined to be most effective close to the exceeding monitors with NOx and SO2 controls 
supplemented depending upon the monitor speciation data. PM2.5 control measures were

applied in the county containing the exceeding monitor for the non-EGU point and area source 
emissions. If additional emission control was needed, SO2 and NOx control measures were 
applied within the county exceeding and any contiguous county.6 Additional control measures 
were not applied to electric generating units (EGUs) due to the extensive nature of controls 
resulting from the inclusion of MATS and CSAPR, and additional controls were not applied to 
mobile sources due to our inability to capture regional reductions using the air quality screening 
methodology employed for this analysis.

4.2.2 Alternative Standard Control Strategies 
After establishing the baseline of attaining the current standard of 15/35, additional 
emission reductions needed to meet four alternative standards 13/35, 12/35, 11/35, and 11/30 
were calculated. 
4.2.2.1 Counties Exceeding Alternative Standards 
Only two counties are projected to exceed an alternative standard of 13/35 using the 
results from the baseline analysis. These are Riverside County, CA and San Bernardino County, 
CA. Figures 4-3 through 4-5 show the counties projected to exceed the alternative standards 
12/35, 11/35, and 11/30, respectively. Six counties are projected to exceed an alternative 
 4-9 
standard of 12/35, eighteen counties are projected to exceed an alternative standard of 11/35, 
and thirty-five counties are projected to exceed an alternative standard of 11/30. For a 
complete list of monitor values see Appendix 4.A.

In developing the control strategies for this RIA, the U.S. EPA first applied known 
controls to reach attainment. For these control strategies, controls for two sectors were used in 
developing the control analysis, as discussed previously: non-EGU point and area sources. An 
approach similar to that taken for the baseline analysis was used in the analysis for the control 
strategies for the alternative standards. Due to the lack of air quality modeling for the control 
strategies, county-specific ratios of air quality response to emission reductions were applied 
based on recent air quality modeling results. A least cost framework was adapted to adjust for 
the use of the air quality to emissions ratios. 
In this analysis, PM2.5 controls were applied first because they were more cost-effective 
and the air quality ratio approach is generally more accurate for PM2.5 emission changes than 
for emission changes from the precursors, SO2 and NOx. If additional control was needed SO2 
and NOx controls were added. 
 4-12 
It should be noted that while PM2.5 controls were applied only within the counties with 
monitors projected to exceed the alternative standard being analyzed, SO2 and NOx controls 
were applied in the exceeding county as well as in the surrounding counties because of the 
transport of NOx and SO2 across counties. Table 4-2 shows the number of exceeding counties 
and the number of surrounding counties to which controls were applied for the alternative 
standards analyzed. For a complete list of geographic areas for all alternative standards see 
Appendix 4.A.

There were some areas where known controls did not achieve enough emission 
reductions to attain the alternative annual standards in 2020. To complete the analysis, the U.S. 
EPA then estimated the additional emission reductions required to reach attainment. The 
methodology used to develop those estimates and those calculations are presented in Section 
4.2.3. 
4.2.2.2 Non-EGU and Area Controls Applied for Alternative Standards 
Non-EGU point and area control measures were identified using the U.S. EPA’s Control 
Strategy Tool7 (CoST). Many of these controls are summarized in Appendix 4.A. 
Area source emissions data are generated at the county level, and therefore controls for 
this emission sector were applied to the county. Area source controls were applied to NOx, SO2, 
and PM2.5. Table 4-1 lists the major controls applied to each sector. The same controls that 
were applied in the baseline analysis were applied to additional sources and additional counties 
in the analyses for the alternative standards. Controls for area sources were applied to: home 
heating, restaurant operations, prescribed burning, and other open burning. 
                                                     
7 See http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/cost.htm for a description of CoST. 
 4-13 
The analysis for non-EGUs applied NOx, SO2, and PM2.5 controls to the following source 
categories: industrial boilers, commercial and institutional boilers, sulfuric acid plants (both 
standalone and at other facilities such as copper and lead smelters), primary metal plants (iron 
and steel mills, lead smelters), mineral products (primarily cement kilns), and petroleum 
refineries. Among the control measures applied were: wet FGD scrubbers and spray dryer 
absorbers (SDA) for SO2 reductions, fabric filters for PM2.5 reductions, and SCR and low NOx 
burners for NOx. 
To more accurately depict available controls, the U.S. EPA employed a decision rule in 
which controls were not applied to any non-EGU or area sources with 50 tons/year of emissions 
or less. This decision rule is the same rule we employed for sources in the previous PM2.5 
NAAQS RIA completed in 2006. The reason for applying this decision rule is based on a finding 
that most point sources with emissions of this level or less had controls already in place. This 
decision rule helps fill gaps in information regarding existing controls on non-EGU sources.

4.2.3 Emission Reductions Needed Beyond Identified Controls 
For each alternative standard and geographic area that cannot reach attainment with 
known controls, we estimated the additional emission reductions needed beyond identified 
known controls for PM2.5 and for the two PM2.5 precursors (SO2 and NOx) to attain the standard. 
In Appendix 4.A, we provide estimates of the relationship between additional emission 
reductions for each pollutant and air quality improvement. 
Because three different pollutants affect ambient levels of PM2.5 in this analysis there 
are many different combinations of pollutant reductions that would result in the required air 
quality improvements. To determine which pollutant reductions to include in our analysis, we 
employ a least cost approach using what we call the hybrid cost methodology. A detailed 
discussion of this methodology appears in Chapter 7. In Appendix 7.A, we show cost estimates 
for each additional emission reduction for each pollutant and geographic area. As expected, the 
unit costs increase under this methodology as more of a particular pollutant is controlled. The 
mix of pollutants controlled, however, varies by area because each area has a different 
combination of known controls applied, varying amounts of additional air quality improvement 
required, and different amounts of uncontrolled emissions remaining. 
The process used to determine the emission reductions needed for each pollutant is 
described below. First, the U.S. EPA examined the emissions remaining for each geographic 
area and pollutant (NOx, PM2.5, SO2). Each pollutant has a marginal cost curve that increases 
(e.g., the third ton removed costs more than the second ton removed, and so on). Each 
pollutant has an estimated effectiveness at reducing the ambient concentration of PM2.5 per 
ton of emissions controlled (see Chapter 3 for more details) that varies by geographic area. The 
U.S. EPA used a least cost methodology to determine the optimum way to reach attainment. 
The optimization methodology used to estimate the quantity of PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors 
needed for each geographic area is described in more detail in Chapter 7 and Appendix 7.A. 
Because the marginal cost equation for each pollutant is expected to be less accurate 
for the very last portion of a pollutant in an area, and it is unlikely an area would reduce all 
anthropogenic emissions to zero on one pollutant prior to controlling others, we added the 
constraint that no more than 90% of the remaining emissions in an area for a given pollutant 
can be reduced from emission reductions beyond known control measures. This decision was 
based upon the rationale that no geographic area would be able to eliminate 100% of the 
emissions of a pollutant given current control measures. This methodology used the marginal 
cost curves for each of the three pollutants along with the air quality to emissions response 
 4-15 
ratios to determine the most cost-effective way to achieve the necessary levels of air quality 
improvement. A detailed discussion of the methodology, including formulas and description of 
how parameters were estimated, can be found in Chapter 7. 
The emission reductions needed beyond known controls are shown in Table 4-4. For a 
listing of emission reductions needed by county for the unknown controls, see Appendix 4.A. 
For the alternative standard 13/35 there are only two counties projected to exceed—Riverside 
County, CA and San Bernardino County, CA. For Riverside County, all known controls were 
applied in the analysis to illustrate attainment of the baseline (15/35). Thus, no known controls 
remained for demonstrating attainment of more stringent standards. For the other alternative 
standards (12/35, 11/35, and 11/30), known controls accounted for over 70% of the needed 
emission reductions. 
The emissions reductions estimated using the hybrid methodology together with 
reductions associated with known controls form the basis of the cost and benefit estimates. 
However, a different mix of reductions in SO2 emissions and PM2.5 emissions may have been 
identified as least cost using a fixed cost per ton approach rather than the hybrid approach.8 
Using the hybrid methodology, the less expensive pollutant to reduce will be selected 
until the marginal cost to reduce the next ton exceeds the marginal cost to reduce the next ton 
of an alternate pollutant. At that point, the methodology chooses a mix of pollutants to achieve 
the least-cost solution. Since the cost per ton is held constant in the fixed-cost methodology, 
the least-cost solution would select all available direct PM2.5 emissions reductions before 
selecting SO2 emissions reductions.9 Therefore, the hybrid methodology estimates PM2.5 
emissions reductions lower than or equal to the fixed-cost methodology and SO2 emission 
reductions higher than or equal to the fixed-cost methodology. 
Even so, for the proposed 12/35 and 13/35 standards, direct PM2.5 reductions account 
for approximately 75%–100% of the reductions, and thus using the fixed cost per ton approach 
to select the combination of emissions reductions would not have substantially changed the 
mix of emissions reductions or the outcome of the cost and benefit analyses. 
                                                     
8 NOx reduction were not selected under either approach as the least cost alternative to achieve the necessary 
PM2.5 reductions. 
9 Because the marginal cost equation for each pollutant is expected to be less accurate for the very last portion of 
a pollutant in an area, and it is unlikely an area would reduce all anthropogenic emissions to zero on one 
pollutant prior to controlling others, we included the constraint that no more than 90% of the remaining 
emissions in an area for a given pollutant can be reduced from emission reductions beyond known control 
measures. 
 4-16 
That said, the hybrid approach still has a number of important uncertainties, and the 
reliability of the method for extrapolating costs in cases where emissions reductions required 
go well beyond known controls has not been evaluated. The degree of extrapolation for 
emissions reductions in California in particular has caused us to rethink the use of the hybrid 
method in providing a range of cost estimates for the proposed standards, therefore we 
provide the hybrid approach as a sensitivity analysis in Appendix 7.A. We would like to take 
comment on analyzing an alternate compliance pathway for California.

4.3 Limitations and Uncertainties 
The U.S. EPA’s analysis is based on its best judgment for various input assumptions that 
are uncertain. As a general matter, the Agency selects the best available information from 
engineering studies of air pollution controls and has set up what it believes is the most 
reasonable modeling framework for analyzing the cost, emission changes, and other impacts of 
regulatory controls. However, the estimates of emission reductions associated with our control 
strategies above are subject to important limitations and uncertainties. We outline, and 
 4-17 
qualitatively assess the impact of, those limitations and uncertainties that are most significant. 
EPA requests comment on the likelihood that new technologies that control direct PM2.5 and its 
precursors will become available between now and 2020. 
A number of limitations and uncertainties are associated with the analysis of emission 
control measures are listed in Table 4-5. For a complete discussion of the terminology used

APPENDIX 4.A 
ADDITIONAL CONTROL STRATEGY INFORMATION 
4.A.1 Control Measures for Stationary Sources 
This appendix describes measures that were employed in this analysis to illustrate a 
hypothetical scenario for controlling emissions of PM and precursors from non-EGU point and 
area source categories to attain alternative annual and 24-hr air quality standards for PM2.5. 
Most of the control measures available are add-on technologies but some other technologies 
and practices that are not add-on in nature can reduce emissions of PM and PM precursors. 
4.A.1.1 PM Emissions Control Technologies1 
This section summarizes control measures focused on reduction of PM2.5 from non-EGU 
point and area sources. However, it should be noted that PM10 will also be reduced by these 
measures. The amount of PM10 reduction varies by the fraction of PM10 in the inlet stream to 
the control measure and the specific design of the measure. 
4.A.1.1.1 PM Control Measures for NonEGU Point Sources 
Most control measures for non-EGU point sources are add-on technologies. These 
technologies include: fabric filters (baghouses), ESPs, and wet PM scrubbers. Fabric filters 
collect particles with sizes ranging from below 1 micrometer to several hundred micrometers in 
diameter at efficiencies in excess of 99%, and this device is used where high-efficiency particle 
collection is required. A fabric filter unit consists of one or more isolated compartments 
containing rows of fabric bags in the form of round, flat, or shaped tubes, or pleated cartridges. 
Particle-laden gas passes up (usually) along the surface of the bags then radially through the 
fabric. Particles are retained on the upstream face of the bags, and the cleaned gas stream is 
vented to the atmosphere. The filter is operated cyclically, alternating between relatively long 
periods of filtering and short periods of cleaning. Dust that accumulates on the bags is removed 
from the fabric surface when cleaning and deposited in a hopper for subsequent disposal. 
ESPs use electrical forces to move particles out of a flowing gas stream and onto 
collector plates. The particles are given an electrical charge by forcing them to pass through a 
corona, a region in which gaseous ions flow. The electrical field that forces the charged particles 
to the plates comes from electrodes maintained at high voltage in the center of the flow lane. 
Once particles are on the collector plates, they must be removed without re-entraining them

Manual, Sixth Edition. This is found on the Internet at http://epa.gov/ttn/catc/products.html#cccinfo. 
 4.A-2 
into the gas stream. This is usually accomplished by rapping the plates mechanically which 
loosens the collected particles from the collector plates, allowing the particles to slide down 
into a hopper from which they are evacuated. This removal of collected particles is typical of a 
“dry” ESP. A “wet” ESP operates by having a water flow applied intermittently or continuously 
to wash away the collected particles for disposal. The advantage of wet ESPs is that there are 
no problems with rapping re-entrainment or with “back coronas” (unintended injection of 
positively charged ions which reduces the charge on particles and lowers the collection 
efficiency). The disadvantage is that the collected slurry must be handled more carefully than a 
dry product, adding to the expense of disposal. ESPs capture particles with sizes ranging from 
below 1 micrometer to several hundred micrometers in diameter at efficiencies from 95 to up 
to 99% and higher. 
Wet PM scrubbers remove PM and acid gases from waste gas streams of stationary 
point sources. The pollutants are removed primarily through the impaction, diffusion, 
interception and/or absorption of the pollutant onto droplets of liquid. The liquid containing 
the pollutant is then collected for disposal. Collection efficiencies for wet scrubbers vary by 
scrubber type, and with the PM size distribution of the waste gas stream. In general, collection 
efficiency decreases as the PM size decreases. Collection efficiencies range from in excess of 
99% for venturi scrubbers to 40% to 60% for simple spray towers. Wet scrubbers are generally 
smaller and more compact than fabric filters or ESPs, and have lower capital cost and 
comparable operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Wet scrubbers, however, operate with a 
higher pressure drop than either fabric filters or ESPs, thus leading to higher energy costs. In 
addition, they are limited to lower waste gas flow rates and operating temperatures than fabric 
filters or ESPs, and also generate sludge that requires additional treatment or disposal. This RIA 
only applies wet scrubbers to fluid catalytic cracking units (FCCUs) at petroleum refineries. 
In addition, we also examined additional add-on control measures specifically for steel 
mills. Virtually all steel mills have some type of PM control measure, but there is additional 
equipment that in many cases could be installed to further reduce emissions. Capture hoods 
that route PM emissions from a blast furnace casthouse to a fabric filter can provide 80% to 
90% additional emission reductions from a steel mill. Other capture and control systems at 
blast oxygen furnaces (BOFs) can also provide 80% to 90% additional reductions. 
Table 4.A-1 lists some of these technologies. For more information on these 
technologies, refer to the EPA Air Pollution Control Cost Manual.1

average annualized cost/ton estimates presented here for these control measures are outputs from our 
modeling, not inputs. They also reflect applications of control where there is no PM control measure currently 
operating except if the control measure is an upgrade (e.g., ESP upgrades). 
4.A.1.1.2 PM Control Measures for Area Sources 
Specific controls exist for a number of stationary area sources. Area source PM controls 
at stationary sources include: 
 catalytic oxidizers on conveyorized charbroilers at restaurants (up to 80% reduction 
of PM), 
 replacement of older woodstoves with ones compliant with the New Source 
Performance Standard (NSPS) for residential wood combustion (up to 98% reduction 
of PM2), and 
 education and advisory programs to help users to operate woodstoves more 
efficiently and with fewer emissions (up to 50% reduction of PM) 
Another PM area source control measure, diesel particulate filters, can be applied to existing 
diesel-fueled compression-ignition (C-I) engines to achieve up to a 90% reduction in fine PM. 
This measure is being applied to new C-I engines as part of a NSPS that was implemented 
beginning in 2006.

Libby, MT per the efforts of the U.S. EPA and several co-sponsors. For more information, refer to

4.A.1.2 SO2 Control Measures 
4.A.1.2.1 SO2 Control Measures for NonEGU Point Sources 
The SO2 emission control measures used in this analysis are similar to those used in the 
PM2.5 RIA prepared about four years ago. Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubbers can achieve 
95–98% control of SO2 for nonEGU point sources and for utility boilers. Spray dryer absorbers 
(SDA) are another commonly employed technology, and SDA can achieve up to 90% or more 
control of SO2. For specific source categories, other types of control technologies are available 
that are more specific to the sources controlled. Table 4.A-3 lists some of these technologies. 
For more information on these technologies, please refer to the CoST control measures

these control measures reflect applications of control where there is no SO2 control measure currently operating 
except for the Cesium promoted catalyst. 
4.A.1.2.2 SO2 Control Technology for Area Sources 
Fuel switching from high to low-sulfur fuels is the predominant control measure 
available for SO2 area sources. For home heating oil users, our analyses included switching from 
a high-sulfur oil (approximately 2,500 parts per million (ppm) sulfur content) to a low-sulfur oil 
(approximately 500 ppm sulfur). A similar control measure is available for oil-fired industrial 
boilers. For more information on these measures, please refer to the CoST control measures 
documentation report.3 
4.A.1.3 NOx Emissions Control Measures 
4.A.1.3.1 NOx Control Measures for Non-EGU Point Sources 
This section describes available measures for controlling emissions of NOx from non-EGU 
point sources. In general, low-NOx burners (LNB) are often applied as a control technology for 
industrial boilers and for some other non-EGU sources because of their wide applicability and 
cost-effectiveness. While all controls presented in this analysis are considered generally 
technically feasible for each class of sources, source-specific cases may exist where a control 
technology is in fact not technically feasible. 
 4.A-6 
Several types of NOx control technologies exist for non-EGU sources: selective catalytic 
reduction (SCR), selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), natural gas reburn (NGR), coal reburn, 
and low-NOx burners. The two control measures chosen most often were LNB and SCR because 
of their breadth of application. In some cases, LNB accompanied by flue gas recirculation (FGR) 
is applicable, such as when fuel-borne NOx emissions are expected to be of greater importance 
than thermal NOx emissions. When circumstances suggest that combustion controls are not 
feasible as a control technology (e.g., sintering processes, coke oven batteries, sulfur recovery 
plants), SNCR or SCR may be an appropriate choice. Finally, SCR can be applied along with a 
combustion control such as LNB with overfire air (OFA) to further reduce NOx emissions. All of 
these control measures are available for application on industrial boilers. 
Besides industrial boilers, other non-EGU source categories covered in this RIA include 
petroleum refineries, kraft pulp mills, cement kilns, stationary internal combustion engines, 
glass manufacturing, combustion turbines, and incinerators. NOx control measures available for 
petroleum refineries, particularly process heaters at these plants, include LNB, SNCR, FGR, and 
SCR along with combinations of these technologies. NOx control measures available for kraft 
pulp mills include those available to industrial boilers, namely LNB, SCR, SNCR, along with water 
injection (WI). NOx control measures available for cement kilns include those available to 
industrial boilers, namely LNB, SCR, and SNCR. In addition, mid-kiln firing (MKF), ammonia-
based SNCR, and biosolids injection can be used on cement kilns where appropriate. Non-
selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) can be used on stationary internal combustion engines. 
OXY-Firing, a technique to modify combustion at glass manufacturing plants, can be used to 
reduce NOx emissions at such plants. LNB, SCR, and SCR combined with steam injection (SI) are 
available measures for combustion turbines. Finally, SNCR is an available control technology at 
incinerators. Table 4.A-4 lists typical examples of the control measures available for these 
categories. For more information on these measures, please refer to the CoST control measures 
documentation report.3

from application of a control measure. The estimates for these control measures reflect applications of control 
where there is no NOx control measure currently operating except for post-combustion controls such as SCR and 
SNCR. For these measures, the costs presume that a NOx combustion control (such as LNB) is already operating 
on the unit to which the SCR or SNCR is applied.

CHAPTER 5 
HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS ANALYSIS APPROACH AND RESULTS 
5.1 Synopsis 
This chapter presents the estimated human health benefits for the proposed National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM). In this chapter, we quantify 
the health-related benefits of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-related air quality 
improvements resulting from the illustrative emission control scenarios that reduce emissions 
of directly emitted particles and precursor pollutants including SO2 and NOx to attain alternative 
PM2.5 NAAQS levels in 2020. 
These benefits are relative to a 2020 baseline reflecting attainment of the current 
primary PM2.5 standards (i.e., annual standard at 15 µg/m3 and 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3, 
referred to as “15/35”) that includes promulgated national regulations and illustrative emission 
controls to simulate attainment with 15/35. We project PM2.5 levels in certain areas would 
exceed 13/35, 12/35, 11/35, and 11/30 after illustrative controls to simulate attainment with 
15/35. In analyzing the current 15/35 standard (baseline), EPA determined that all counties 
would meet the 14/35 standard concurrently with meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no 
additional cost. Consequently, there are no incremental costs or benefits for 14/35, and no 
need to present an analysis of 14/35. Table 5-1 summarizes the total monetized benefits of 
these alternative PM2.5 standards in 2020. These estimates reflect the sum of the estimated 
PM2.5 mortality impacts identified and the value of all morbidity impacts.

which are discounted over the SAB-recommended 20-year segmented lag. It was not all possible to quantify all 
benefits due to data limitations in this analysis. “B” is the sum of all unquantified health and welfare benefits. 
  
5-2 
For annual standards at 12 µg/m3 and 13 µg/m3, the majority of benefits (i.e., 70% and 
98%, respectively) occur in California because this highly populated area is where the most air 
quality improvement beyond 15/35 is needed to reach these levels. In addition, several recent 
rules such as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
(CSAPR) will have substantially reduced PM2.5 levels by 2020 in the East, thus few additional 
controls would be needed to reach 12/35 or 13/35 in the East. 
In general, we have greater confidence in risk estimates based on PM2.5 concentrations 
where the bulk of the data reside and somewhat less confidence where data density is lower. 
As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, the range from the 25th to 10th percentiles of 
the air quality data used the epidemiology studies is a reasonable range below which we have 
appreciably less confidence in the associations observed in the epidemiological studies. Most of 
the estimated avoided premature deaths occur at or above the lowest measured PM2.5 
concentration in the two studies used to estimate mortality benefits. 
In addition to PM2.5 benefits, implementation of emissions controls to attain the 
alternative PM2.5 standards would reduce other ambient pollutants, such as SO2, NO2, and 
ozone. However, because the method used in this analysis to simulate attainment does not 
simulate changes in ambient concentrations of other pollutants, we were not able to quantify 
the co-benefits of reduced exposure to other pollutants. In addition, due to data and 
methodology limitations, we were unable to estimate additional health benefits associated 
with exposure to PM2.5 or the additional benefits from improvements in welfare effects, such as 
ecosystem effects and visibility. We describe the unquantified health benefits in this chapter 
and the unquantified welfare benefits in Chapter 6. 
5.2 Overview 
This chapter contains a subset of the estimated health benefits of the proposed and 
alternative PM2.5 standards in 2020 that EPA was able to quantify, given the available resources 
and methods. The analysis in this chapter aims to characterize the benefits of the air quality 
changes resulting from the implementation of new PM standards by answering two key 
questions: 
1. What are the health effects of changes in ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) 
resulting from reductions in directly emitted PM2.5 and precursors due to the 
attainment of a new PM2.5 standard? 
2. What is the economic value of these effects? 
  
5-3 
In this analysis, we consider an array of health impacts attributable to changes in PM2.5. 
The Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2009b) identifies the 
human health effects associated with ambient particles, which include premature mortality and 
a variety of morbidity effects associated with acute and chronic exposures. Table 5-2 
summarizes human health categories contained within the main benefits estimate as well as 
those categories that were unquantified due to limited data or resources. It is important to 
emphasize that the list of unquantified benefit categories is not exhaustive, nor is quantification 
of each effect complete. In order to identify the most meaningful human health and 
environmental co-benefits, we excluded effects not identified as having at least a causal, likely 
causal, or suggestive relationship with the affected pollutants in the most recent 
comprehensive scientific assessment, such as an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA). This does 
not imply that additional relationships between these and other human health and 
environmental co-benefits and the affected pollutants do not exist. Due to this decision 
criterion, some effects that were identified in previous lists of unquantified benefits in other 
RIAs have been dropped (e.g., UVb exposure). 
The benefits analysis in this chapter relies on an array of data inputs—including air 
quality modeling, health impact functions and valuation estimates among others—which are 
themselves subject to uncertainty and may also in turn contribute to the overall uncertainty in 
this analysis. We employ several techniques to characterize this uncertainty, which are 
described in detail in section 5.4. 
As described in Chapter 1, there are important differences worth noting in the design 
and analytical objectives of NAAQS RIAs compared to RIAs for implementation rules, such as 
the recent MATS rule (U.S. EPA, 2011d). The NAAQS RIAs illustrate the potential costs and 
benefits of attaining a revised air quality standard nationwide based on an array of emission 
control strategies for different sources, incremental to implementation of existing regulations 
and controls needed to attain current standards. In short, NAAQS RIAs hypothesize, but do not 
predict, the control strategies that States may choose to enact when implementing a revised 
NAAQS. The setting of a NAAQS does not directly result in costs or benefits, and as such, NAAQS 
RIAs are merely illustrative and are not intended to be added to the costs and benefits of other 
regulations that result in specific costs of control and emission reductions. By contrast, the 
emission reductions from implementation rules are generally for specific, well-characterized 
sources, such as the recent MATS rule (U.S. EPA, 2011d). In general, EPA is more confident in 
the magnitude and location of the emission reductions for implementation rules. As such, 
emission reductions achieved under promulgated implementation rules such as MATS have 
  
5-4 
been reflected in the baseline of this NAAQS analysis. Subsequent implementation rules will be 
reflected in the baseline for the next PM NAAQS review. For this reason, the benefits estimated 
provided in this RIA and all other NAAQS RIAs should not be added to the benefits estimated for 
implementation rules.

1 We assess these benefits qualitative due to time and resource limitations for this analysis. 
2 We assess these benefits qualitatively because we do not have sufficient confidence in available data or 
methods. 
3 We assess these benefits qualitatively because current evidence is only suggestive of causality or there are other 
significant concerns over the strength of the association. 
4 We quantify these benefits in a sensitivity analysis, but not the main analysis. 
5.3 Updated Methodology Presented in this RIA 
The benefits analysis presented in this chapter incorporates an array of policy and 
technical changes that the Agency has adopted since the previous review of the PM2.5 standards 
in 2006, and since publication of the most recent major benefits analysis, documented in the 
benefits chapter of the RIA accompanying the final MATS(U.S. EPA, 2011d). Below we note the 
aspects of this analysis that differ from the MATS RIA: 
1. Incorporation of the newest American Cancer Society (ACS) mortality study. In 2009, 
the Health Effects Institute published an extended analysis of the ACS cohort 
(Krewski et al., 2009). Compared to the study it replaces (Pope et al., 2002), this new 
analysis incorporates a number of methodological improvements that we describe in 
detail below. The all-cause PM2.5 mortality risk estimate drawn from Krewski et al. 
  
5-7 
(2009) is identical to the Pope et al. (2002) risk estimate applied in recent EPA 
analyses of long-term PM2.5 mortality but has narrower confidence intervals. 
2. Updated health endpoints. We have moved the quantification of chronic bronchitis 
from our main analysis to a sensitivity analysis. This change is consistent with the 
findings of the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) that the evidence for an 
association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and respiratory effects is more 
tenuous (U.S. EPA, 2009). We also add two new sensitivity analyses, including an 
assessment of PM-related cerebrovascular disease and cardiovascular emergency 
department visits. The incorporation of these two new endpoints follows the 
findings of the PM ISA that recent studies have strengthened the relationship 
between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular outcomes (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
3. Incorporation of new morbidity studies. Since the publication of the 2004 Criteria 
Document for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2004) the epidemiological literature has 
produced a significant number of new studies examining the association between 
short-term PM2.5 exposure and acute myocardial infarctions, respiratory and 
cardiovascular hospitalizations, respiratory emergency department visits, acute 
respiratory symptoms and exacerbation of asthma. Upon careful evaluation of this 
new literature we have incorporated new studies into our health impact 
assessment; in many cases we have replaced older single-city time-series studies 
with newer multi-city time-series analyses. 
4. Updated hospital cost-of-illness (COI), including median wage data. In previous 
versions of BenMAP, estimates of hospital charges and lengths of hospital stays 
were based on discharge statistics provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality’s Healthcare Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 
for 2000 (AHRQ, 2000). The newest version of BenMAP (version 4.0.51) used in this 
analysis updated this information to use the 2007 database. The data source for the 
updated median annual income is the 2007 American Community Survey (ACS, 
2007). 
5. Expanded uncertainty assessment. We have incorporated a more comprehensive 
assessment of the various uncertain parameters and assumptions within the 
benefits analysis. 
While the list above identifies the major changes implemented since the MATS RIA, EPA 
has updated several additional components of the benefits analysis since the 2006 PM NAAQS 
RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006a). In the Portland Cement NESHAP proposal RIA (U.S. EPA, 2009a), the 
Agency removed the threshold assumption in the concentration-response function for PM2.5-
related health effects and began using the benefits derived from the two major cohort studies 
of PM2.5 and mortality as the main benefits estimates, while still including a range of sensitivity 
estimates based on EPA’s PM2.5 mortality expert elicitation. In the NO2 NAAQS proposal RIA 
  
5-8 
(U.S. EPA, 2009a), we revised the estimate used for the value-of-a-statistical life to be 
consistent with Agency guidance. In the proposed CSAPR (previously the “Transport Rule”) (U.S. 
EPA, 2010g), we incorporated the “lowest measured level” assessment to help characterize 
uncertainty in estimates of benefits of reductions in PM2.5 at lower baseline concentrations of 
PM2.5. In the final CSAPR (U.S. EPA, 2011c), we updated the baseline incidence rates for hospital 
admissions and emergency department visits and asthma prevalence rates. We direct the 
reader to each of these RIAs for more information on these changes. 
5.4 Human Health Benefits Analysis Methods 
We follow a “damage-function” approach in calculating total benefits of the modeled 
changes in environmental quality. This approach estimates changes in individual health and 
welfare endpoints (specific effects that can be associated with changes in air quality) and 
assigns values to those changes assuming independence of the values for those individual 
endpoints. Total benefits are calculated simply as the sum of the values for all non-overlapping 
health and welfare endpoints. The “damage-function” approach is the standard method for 
assessing costs and benefits of environmental quality programs and has been used in several 
recent published analyses (Levy et al., 2009; Fann et al., 2012a; Tagaris et al., 2009). 
To assess economic value in a damage-function framework, the changes in 
environmental quality must be translated into effects on people or on the things that people 
value. In some cases, the changes in environmental quality can be directly valued, as is the case 
for changes in visibility. In other cases, such as for changes in ozone and PM, a health and 
welfare impact analysis must first be conducted to convert air quality changes into effects that 
can be assigned dollar values. For the purposes of this RIA, the health impacts analysis (HIA) is 
limited to those health effects that are directly linked to ambient levels of air pollution and 
specifically to those linked to PM2.5. 
We note at the outset that EPA rarely has the time or resources to perform extensive 
new research to measure directly either the health outcomes or their values for regulatory 
analyses. Thus, similar to Kunzli et al. (2000) and other, more recent health impact analyses, our 
estimates are based on the best available methods of benefits transfer. Benefits transfer is the 
science and art of adapting primary research from similar contexts to obtain the most accurate 
measure of benefits for the environmental quality change under analysis. Adjustments are 
made for the level of environmental quality change, the socio-demographic and economic 
characteristics of the affected population, and other factors to improve the accuracy and 
robustness of benefits estimates.

5.4.1 Health Impact Assessment 
The Health Impact Assessment (HIA) quantifies the changes in the incidence of adverse 
health impacts resulting from changes in human exposure to PM2.5 and ozone air quality. HIAs 
are a well-established approach for estimating the retrospective or prospective change in 
adverse health impacts expected to result from population-level changes in exposure to 
pollutants (Levy et al., 2009). PC-based tools such as the environmental Benefits Mapping and 
Analysis Program (BenMAP) can systematize health impact analyses by applying a database of 
key input parameters, including health impact functions and population projections—provided 
that key input data are available, including air quality estimates and risk coefficients (Abt 
Associates, 2010). Analysts have applied the HIA approach to estimate human health impacts 
resulting from hypothetical changes in pollutant levels (Hubbell et al., 2005; Tagaris et al., 2009; 
Fann et al., 2012a). EPA and others have relied upon this method to predict future changes in 
health impacts expected to result from the implementation of regulations affecting air quality 
(e.g., U.S. EPA, 2011d). For this assessment, the HIA is limited to those health effects that are 
directly linked to ambient PM2.5 concentrations. There may be other indirect health impacts 
associated with implementing emissions controls, such as occupational health exposures. 
The HIA approach used in this analysis involves three basic steps: (1) utilizing projections 
of PM2.5 air quality1 and estimating the change in the spatial distribution of the ambient air 
quality; (2) determining the subsequent change in population-level exposure; (3) calculating 
health impacts by applying concentration-response relationships drawn from the 
epidemiological literature (Hubbell et al., 2009) to this change in population exposure. 
A typical health impact function might look as follows: 
 ∆𝑦 = 𝑦𝑜  ∙ �𝑒𝛽∙∆𝑥 −  1� ∙ 𝑃𝑜𝑝 (5-1) 
where y0 is the baseline incidence rate for the health endpoint being quantified (for example, a 
health impact function quantifying changes in mortality would use the baseline, or background, 
mortality rate for the given population of interest); Pop is the population affected by the 
change in air quality; ∆x is the change in air quality; and β is the effect coefficient drawn from 
the epidemiological study. Figure 5-1 provides a simplified overview of this approach.

Quality model (CMAQ). See Chapter 3 of this RIA for more information on the air quality modeling.

5.4.2 Economic Valuation of Health Impacts 
After quantifying the change in adverse health impacts, the final step is to estimate the 
economic value of these avoided impacts. The appropriate economic value for a change in a 
health effect depends on whether the health effect is viewed ex ante (before the effect has 
occurred) or ex post (after the effect has occurred). Reductions in ambient concentrations of air 
pollution generally lower the risk of future adverse health effects by a small amount for a large 
population. The appropriate economic measure is therefore ex ante Willingness to Pay (WTP) 
for changes in risk. However, epidemiological studies generally provide estimates of the relative 
risks of a particular health effect avoided due to a reduction in air pollution. A convenient way 
to use these data in a consistent framework is to convert probabilities to units of avoided 
statistical incidences. This measure is calculated by dividing individual WTP for a risk reduction 
by the related observed change in risk. For example, suppose a measure is able to reduce the 
risk of premature mortality from 2 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000 (a reduction of 1 in 10,000). If 
individual WTP for this risk reduction is $100, then the WTP for an avoided statistical premature 
mortality amounts to $1 million ($100/0.0001 change in risk). Using this approach, the size of 
  
5-11 
the affected population is automatically taken into account by the number of incidences 
predicted by epidemiological studies applied to the relevant population. The same type of 
calculation can produce values for statistical incidences of other health endpoints. 
For some health effects, such as hospital admissions, WTP estimates are generally not 
available. In these cases, we use the cost of treating or mitigating the effect. For example, for 
the valuation of hospital admissions we use the avoided medical costs as an estimate of the 
value of avoiding the health effects causing the admission. These cost-of-illness (COI) estimates 
generally (although not in every case) understate the true value of reductions in risk of a health 
effect. They tend to reflect the direct expenditures related to treatment but not the value of 
avoided pain and suffering from the health effect. 
We use the BenMAP model version 4.0.52 (Abt Associates, 2010) to estimate the health 
impacts and monetized health benefits for the proposed standard. Figure 5-2 shows the data 
inputs and outputs for the BenMAP model.

5.5 Uncertainty Characterization 
In any complex analysis using estimated parameters and inputs from numerous models, 
there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. This analysis is no exception. As outlined 
both in this and preceding chapters, this analysis includes many data sources as inputs, 
including emission inventories, air quality data from models (with their associated parameters 
and inputs), population data, population estimates, health effect estimates from epidemiology 
studies, economic data for monetizing benefits, and assumptions regarding the future state of 
the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human behavior). Each of these inputs may be 
uncertain and would affect the benefits estimate. When the uncertainties from each stage of 
the analysis are compounded, even small uncertainties can have large effects on the total 
quantified benefits. 
After reviewing EPA’s approach, the National Research Council (NRC) (2002, 2008), 
which is part of the National Academies of Science, concluded that EPA’s general methodology 
for calculating the benefits of reducing air pollution is reasonable and informative in spite of 
inherent uncertainties. The NRC also highlighted the need to conduct rigorous quantitative 
analyses of uncertainty and to present benefits estimates to decision makers in ways that foster 
an appropriate appreciation of their inherent uncertainty. Since the publication of these 
reports, EPA has continued work to improve the characterization of uncertainty in both health 
incidence and benefits estimates. In response to these recommendations, we have expanded 
our previous analyses to incorporate additional quantitative and qualitative characterizations of 
uncertainty. 
To characterize uncertainty and variability, we follow an approach that combines 
elements from two recent EPA analyses (U.S. EPA, 2010b; U.S. EPA, 2011a), and uses a tiered 
approach developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for characterizing uncertainty 
(WHO, 2008). We present this tiered assessment as well as an assessment of the potential 
impact and magnitude of each aspect of uncertainty In Appendix 5c. While data limitations 
prevent us from treating each source of uncertainty quantitatively and from reaching a full-
probabilistic simulation of our results, we were able to consider the influence of uncertainty in 
the risk coefficients and economic valuation functions by incorporating six quantitative analyses 
described in more detail below: 
1. A Monte Carlo assessment that accounts for random sampling error and between 
study variability in the epidemiological and economic valuation studies; 
  
5-13 
2. A concentration benchmark assessment that characterizes the distribution of 
avoided PM2.5-related deaths relative to specific concentrations in the long-term 
epidemiological studies used to estimate PM2.5-related mortality; 
3. The quantification of PM-related mortality using alternative PM2.5 mortality effect 
estimates drawn from two long-term cohort studies and an expert elicitation; 
4. Sensitivity analyses of several aspects of PM-related benefits; 
5. Distributional analyses of PM2.5-related benefits by location, race, income, and 
education; and 
6. An analysis of the influence of various parameters on total monetized benefits. 
5.5.1 Monte Carlo Assessment 
Similar to other recent RIAs, we used Monte Carlo methods for characterizing random 
sampling error associated with the concentration response functions from epidemiological 
studies and random effects modeling to characterize both sampling error and variability across 
the economic valuation functions. The Monte Carlo simulation in the BenMAP software 
randomly samples from a distribution of incidence and valuation estimates to characterize the 
effects of uncertainty on output variables. Specifically, we used Monte Carlo methods to 
generate confidence intervals around the estimated health impact and monetized benefits. The 
reported standard errors in the epidemiological studies determined the distributions for 
individual effect estimates for endpoints estimated using a single study. For endpoints 
estimated using a pooled estimate of multiple studies, the confidence intervals reflect both the 
standard errors and the variance across studies. The confidence intervals around the monetized 
benefits incorporate the epidemiology standard errors as well as the distribution of the 
valuation function. These confidence intervals do not reflect other sources of uncertainty 
inherent within the estimates, such as baseline incidence rates, populations exposed and 
transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. As a result, the reported confidence 
intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the overall uncertainty in the 
benefits estimates. 
5.5.2 Concentration Benchmark Analysis for PM2.5 
We include a concentration benchmark assessment, which identifies the baseline (i.e., 
pre-rule) annual mean PM2.5 levels at which populations are exposed and specific 
concentrations in the two long-term cohort studies we use to quantify mortality impacts. This 
analysis characterize avoided PM2.5-related deaths relative the the 10th and 25th percentiles of 
  
5-14 
the the air quality data used the Krewski et al. (2009) study as well as the lowest measured level 
(LML) of the Krewski et al. (2009) and Laden et al. (2006) studies. 
5.5.3 Alternative Concentration-Response Functions for PM2.5 –Related Mortality 
We assign the greatest economic value to the reduction in PM2.5 related mortality risk. 
Therefore, it is particularly important to attempt to characterize the uncertainties associated 
with reductions in premature mortality. To better understand the concentration-response 
relationship between PM2.5 exposure and premature mortality, EPA conducted an expert 
elicitation in 2006 (Roman et al., 2008; IEc, 2006).2 In general, the results of the expert 
elicitation support the conclusion that the benefits of PM2.5 control are very likely to be 
substantial. 
Alternative concentration-response functions are useful for assessing uncertainty 
beyond random statistical error, including uncertainty in the functional form of the model or 
alternative study design. Thus, we include the expert elicitation results as well as standard 
errors approaches to provide insights into the likelihood of different outcomes and about the 
state of knowledge regarding the benefits estimates. In this analysis, we present the results 
derived from the expert elicitation as indicative of the uncertainty associated with a major 
component of the health impact functions, and we provide the independent estimates derived 
from each of the twelve experts to better characterize the degree of variability in the expert 
responses. 
In previous RIAs, EPA presented benefits estimates using concentration response 
functions derived from the PM2.5 Expert Elicitation (Roman et al., 2008) as a range from the 
lowest expert value (Expert K) to the highest expert value (Expert E). However, this approach 
did not indicate the agency’s judgment on what the best estimate of PM2.5 benefits may be, and 
EPA’s independent Science Advisory Board raised concerns about this presentation (U.S. EPA-
SAB, 2008). Therefore, we began to present the cohort-based studies (Krewski et al., 2009; 
Laden et al., 2006) as our core estimates in the proposal RIA for the Portland Cement NESHAP 
(U.S. EPA, 2009a). Using alternate relationships between PM2.5 and premature mortality 
supplied by experts, higher and lower benefits estimates are plausible, but most of the expert-
based estimates of the mean PM2.5 effect on mortality fall between the two epidemiology-
based estimates (Roman et al., 2008). In addition to these studies, we have included a 
discussion or other recent multi-state cohort studies conducted in North America, but we have 
                                                     
2 Expert elicitation is a formal, highly structured and well documented process whereby expert judgments, usually 
of multiple experts, are obtained (Ayyub, 2002). 
  
5-15 
not estimated benefits using the effect coefficients from these studies. Please note that the 
benefits estimates results presented are not the direct results from the studies or expert 
elicitation; rather, the estimates are based in part on the effect coefficients provided in those 
studies or by experts. 
Even these multiple characterizations with confidence intervals omit the contribution to 
overall uncertainty from uncertainty in air quality changes, baseline incidence rates, and 
populations exposed. Furthermore, the approach presented here does not yet include methods 
for addressing correlation between input parameters and the identification of reasonable upper 
and lower bounds for input distributions characterizing uncertainty in additional model 
elements. As a result, the reported confidence intervals and range of estimates give an 
incomplete picture about the overall uncertainty in the estimates. This information should be 
interpreted within the context of the larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. 
5.5.4 Sensitivity Analyses 
For some aspects of uncertainty, we have sufficient data to conduct sensitivity analyses. 
In this analysis, we performed four such analyses for the proposed standard level. In particular, 
we: 
1. Assessed the sensitivity of the economic value of reductions in the risk of PM2.5-
related death according to differing assumptions regarding the lag between PM2.5 
exposure and premature death. The timing of such premature deaths affects the 
magnitude of the discounted PM2.5-related mortality benefits. In this sensitivity 
assessment, we consider 6 alternative cessation lags. 
2. Characterized the sensitivity of the economic value of the health endpoints valued 
using willingness-to-pay estimates to a higher and a lower assumption regarding 
income elasticity. As we discuss below, economic theory argues that individual 
willingness to pay increases as personal income grows. The relationship between 
growth in personal income and willingness-to-pay to reduce mortality and morbidity 
risk is characterized by the income growth factor. 
3. Summarized the avoided cases of certain health endpoints for which we either 
lacked an appropriate economic value (cardiovascular hospital admissions and 
stroke) or in which we no longer had sufficient confidence to retain in our primary 
benefits estimate (chronic bronchitis). 
4. Compared the valuation of hospitalizations and work loss days using the 2000 AHRQ 
database to the 2007 database. 
  
5-16 
5.5.5 Distributional Assessment 
In the Appendix to this chapter, we characterize the distribution of PM2.5-related 
benefits based on the geographic distribution of race and education in areas where the selected 
control strategies would reduce PM2.5 concentrations. In this assessment, we aim to answer two 
key questions: 
1. What is the estimated distribution of PM2.5-related mortality risk based on the race 
and education characteristics of the population living within areas projected to 
exceed alternative combinations of primary PM2.5 standards? 
2. How would air quality improvements within these counties change the distribution 
of risk among populations of different races and educational attainment?3 
This assessment is generally consistent with the distributional assessments performed in 
support of the CSAPR (EPA, 2011c) and the MATS (EPA, 2011c), with one key difference. The 
environmental justice analyses accompanying the CSAPR and MATS RIAs applied CMAQ-
modeled PM2.5 predictions that represent the change in air quality after the implementation of 
each rule. By contrast, this RIA aims to illustrate the potential benefits and costs of attaining 
alternative primary PM2.5 standards; the states will ultimately implement attainment strategies, 
which may differ greatly from the least-cost strategy EPA modeled here. Alternative attainment 
strategies—particularly those that maximize benefits to human health and provide a more 
equitable distribution of risk—are also available to the states, though not modeled here (Fann 
et al., 2012b). 
5.5.6 Influence Analysis—Quantitative Assessment of Uncertainty 
In the past few years, EPA has initiated several projects to improve the characterization 
of uncertainty for benefits analysis. In particular, EPA recently completed the first phase of a 
quantitative uncertainty analysis of benefits, hereafter referred to as the “Influence Analysis” 
(Mansfield et al., 2009). The Influence Analysis diagramed the uncertain components of each 
step within the benefits analysis process, identified plausible ranges for a sensitivity analysis, 
and assessed the sensitivity to total benefits to changes in each component. While this analysis 
does not quite fulfill the goal of a full probabilistic assessment, it accomplished the necessary 
first steps and identified the challenges to accomplishing that goal. Below are some of the 
preliminary observations from the first phase of the project. 
                                                     
3 In this analysis we assess the change in risk among populations of different race and educational attainment. As 
we discuss further in the methodology, we consider this last variable because of the availability of education-
modified PM2.5 mortality risk estimates. 
  
5-17 
 The components that contribute the most to uncertainty of the monetized benefits 
and mortality incidence (in order of importance) are the value-of-a-statistical-life 
(VSL), the concentration-response (C-R) function for mortality, and change in PM2.5 
concentration. 
 The components that contribute the least to uncertainty of the monetized benefits 
and mortality incidence are population, morbidity valuation, and income elasticity. 
 The choice of a C-R function for mortality affects the mortality incidence and 
monetized benefits more than other sources of uncertainty within each C-R 
function. 
 Alternative cessation lag structures for mortality have a moderate effect on the 
monetized benefits. 
 Because the health impact function is essentially linear, the key components show 
the same sensitivity across all mortality C-R functions even if the midpoints differ 
significantly from one expert to another. 
5.5.7 Qualitative Assessment of Uncertainty and Other Analysis Limitations 
Although we strive to incorporate as many quantitative assessments of uncertainty as 
possible, there are several aspects we are only able to address qualitatively. These aspects are 
important factors to consider when evaluating the relative benefits of the attainment strategies 
for each of the alternative standards: 
The total monetized benefits presented in this chapter are based on our interpretation 
of the best available scientific literature and methods and supported by EPA’s independent 
Science Advisory Board (Health Effects Subcommittee) (SAB-HES) (U.S. EPA- SAB, 2010a) and 
the National Academies of Science (NAS) (NRC, 2002). The benefits estimates are subject to a 
number of assumptions and uncertainties. For example, the key assumptions underlying the 
estimates for premature mortality, which account for over 98% of the total monetized benefits 
in this analysis, include the following: 
1. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 
equally potent in causing premature mortality. This is an important assumption, 
because PM2.5 varies considerably in composition across sources, but the scientific 
evidence is not yet sufficient to allow differentiation of effect estimates by particle 
type. The PM ISA, which was twice reviewed by CASAC, concluded that “many 
constituents of PM2.5 can be linked with multiple health effects, and the evidence is 
not yet sufficient to allow differentiation of those constituents or sources that are 
more closely related to specific outcomes” (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
  
5-18 
2. We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is log-linear down to 
the lowest air quality levels modeled in this analysis. Thus, the estimates include 
health benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of 
PM2.5, including both regions that are in attainment with the fine particle standard 
and those that do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled 
concentrations. 
3. To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between PM2.5 and premature 
mortality (which account for over 98% of total monetized benefits in this analysis), 
we include a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert elicitation study 
in addition to our core estimates. Even these multiple characterizations omit the 
uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence rates, populations exposed 
and transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. As a result, the 
reported confidence intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture 
about the overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates. This information should be 
interpreted within the context of the larger uncertainty surrounding the entire 
analysis. 
As previously described, we strive to monetize as many of the benefits anticipated from 
the alternative standards as possible given data and resource limitations, but the monetized 
benefits estimated in this RIA inevitably only reflect a portion of the benefits. Specifically, only 
certain benefits attributable to the health impacts associated with exposure to ambient fine 
particles have been monetized in this analysis. Data and methodological limitations prevented 
EPA from quantifying or monetizing the benefits from several important health benefit 
categories in this RIA, including benefits from reducing ozone exposure, NO2 exposure, SO2 
exposure, and methylmercury exposure (see section 5.6.5 for more information). If we could 
fully monetize all of the benefit categories, the total monetized benefits would exceed the costs 
by an even greater margin than we currently estimate. 
To more fully address all these uncertainties including those we cannot quantify, we 
apply a four-tiered approach using the WHO uncertainty framework (WHO, 2008), which 
provides a means for systematically linking the characterization of uncertainty to the 
sophistication of the underlying risk assessment. EPA has applied similar approaches in analyses 
(U.S. EPA, 2010b, 2011a). Using this framework, we summarize the key uncertainties in the 
health benefits analysis, including our assessment of the direction of potential bias, magnitude 
of impact on the monetized benefits, degree of confidence in our analytical approach, and our 
ability to assess the source of uncertainty. More information on this approach and the 
uncertainty characterization are available in Appendix 5C. Because this approach reflects a new 
  
5-19 
application for regulatory benefits analysis, we request comments on this general approach to 
characterizing uncertainty as well as the specific uncertainty assessments. 
5.6 Benefits Analysis Data Inputs 
In Figure 5-2, we summarized the key data inputs to the health impact and economic 
valuation estimate. Below we summarize the data sources for each of these inputs, including 
demographic projections, incidence and prevalence rates, effect coefficients, and economic 
valuation. We indicate where we have updated key data inputs since the benefits analysis 
conducted for the MATS (U.S. EPA, 2011d). 
5.6.1 Demographic Data 
Quantified and monetized human health impacts depend on the demographic 
characteristics of the population, including age, location, and income. We use projections based 
on economic forecasting models developed by Woods and Poole, Inc. (Woods and Poole, 2007). 
The Woods and Poole (WP) database contains county-level projections of population by age, 
sex, and race out to 2030. Projections in each county are determined simultaneously with every 
other county in the United States to take into account patterns of economic growth and 
migration. The sum of growth in county-level populations is constrained to equal a previously 
determined national population growth, based on Bureau of Census estimates (Hollman et al., 
2000). According to WP, linking county-level growth projections together and constraining to a 
national-level total growth avoids potential errors introduced by forecasting each county 
independently. County projections are developed in a four-stage process: 
• First, national-level variables such as income, employment, and populations are 
forecasted. 
• Second, employment projections are made for 179 economic areas defined by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. BEA, 2004), using an “export-base” 
approach, which relies on linking industrial-sector production of non-locally 
consumed production items, such as outputs from mining, agriculture, and 
manufacturing with the national economy. The export-based approach requires 
estimation of demand equations or calculation of historical growth rates for 
output and employment by sector. 
• Third, population is projected for each economic area based on net migration 
rates derived from employment opportunities and following a cohort-
component method based on fertility and mortality in each area. 
• Fourth, employment and population projections are repeated for counties, using 
the economic region totals as bounds. The age, sex, and race distributions for 
  
5-20 
each region or county are determined by aging the population by single year of 
age by sex and race for each year through 2020 based on historical rates of 
mortality, fertility, and migration. 
5.6.2 Baseline Incidence and Prevalence Estimates 
Epidemiological studies of the association between pollution levels and adverse health 
effects generally provide a direct estimate of the relationship of air quality changes to the 
relative risk of a health effect, rather than estimating the absolute number of avoided cases. For 
example, a typical result might be that a 10 µg/m3 decrease in daily PM2.5 levels might be 
associated with a decrease in hospital admissions of 3%. The baseline incidence of the health 
effect is necessary to convert this relative change into a number of cases. A baseline incidence 
rate is the estimate of the number of cases of the health effect per year in the assessment 
location, as it corresponds to baseline pollutant levels in that location. To derive the total 
baseline incidence per year, this rate must be multiplied by the corresponding population 
number. For example, if the baseline incidence rate is the number of cases per year per million 
people, that number must be multiplied by the millions of people in the total population. 
Table 5-3 summarizes the sources of baseline incidence rates and provides average 
incidence rates for the endpoints included in the analysis. For both baseline incidence and 
prevalence data, we used age-specific rates where available. We applied concentration-
response functions to individual age groups and then summed over the relevant age range to 
provide an estimate of total population benefits. In most cases, we used a single national 
incidence rate, due to a lack of more spatially disaggregated data. Whenever possible, the 
national rates used are national averages, because these data are most applicable to a national 
assessment of benefits. For some studies, however, the only available incidence information 
comes from the studies themselves; in these cases, incidence in the study population is 
assumed to represent typical incidence at the national level. County, state and regional 
incidence rates are available for hospital admissions, and county-level data are available for 
premature mortality. We have projected mortality rates such that future mortality rates are 
consistent with our projections of population growth (Abt Associates, 2011). 
The baseline incidence rates for hospital admissions and emergency department visits 
reflect the revised rates first applied in the CSAPR RIA (U.S. EPA, 2011c). In addition, we have 
also revised the baseline incidence rates for acute myocardial infarction. These revised rates are 
more recent (AHRQ, 2007), which provides a better representation of the rates at which 
populations of different ages, and in different locations, visit the hospital and emergency 
department for air pollution-related illnesses. Also, the new baseline incidence rates are more 
  
5-21 
spatially refined. For many locations within the U.S., these data are resolved at the county- or 
state-level, providing a better characterization of the geographic distribution of hospital and 
emergency department visits than the previous national rates. Lastly, these rates reflect 
unscheduled hospital admissions only, which represents a conservative assumption that most 
air pollution-related visits are likely to be unscheduled. If air pollution-related hospital 
admissions are scheduled, this assumption would underestimate these benefits.

assume no change in prevalence rates in future years. We updated these rates in the CSAPR RIA

5.6.3 Effect Coefficients 
The first step in selecting effect coefficients is to identify the health endpoints to be 
quantified. We base our selection of health endpoints on consistency with EPA’s Integrated 
Science Assessments (which replace previous Criteria Documents), with input and advice from 
the EPA Science Advisory Board—Health Effects Subcommittee (SAB-HES), a scientific review 
panel specifically established to provide advice on the use of the scientific literature in 
developing benefits analyses for air pollution regulations. In general, we follow a weight of 
evidence approach, based on the biological plausibility of effects, availability of concentration-
response functions from well conducted peer-reviewed epidemiological studies, cohesiveness 
of results across studies, and a focus on endpoints reflecting public health impacts (like hospital 
admissions) rather than physiological responses (such as changes in clinical measures like 
Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1)). 
There are several types of data that can support the determination of types and 
magnitude of health effects associated with air pollution exposures. These sources of data 
include toxicological studies (including animal and cellular studies), human clinical trials, and 
observational epidemiology studies. All of these data sources provide important contributions 
to the weight of evidence surrounding a particular health impact. However, only epidemiology 
studies provide direct concentration-response relationships that can be used to evaluate 
population-level impacts of reductions in ambient pollution levels in a health impact 
assessment. 
For the data-derived estimates, we relied on the published scientific literature to 
ascertain the relationship between PM2.5 and adverse human health effects. We evaluated 
epidemiological studies using the selection criteria summarized in Table 5-5. These criteria 
include consideration of whether the study was peer-reviewed, the match between the 
pollutant studied and the pollutant of interest, the study design and location, and 
characteristics of the study population, among other considerations. In general, the use of 
concentration-response functions from more than a single study can provide a more 
representative distribution of the effect estimate. However, there are often differences 
between studies examining the same endpoint, making it difficult to pool the results in a 
consistent manner. For example, studies may examine different pollutants or different age 
groups. For this reason, we consider very carefully the set of studies available examining each 
endpoint and select a consistent subset that provides a good balance of population coverage 
and match with the pollutant of interest. In many cases, either because of a lack of multiple 
  
5-25 
studies, consistency problems, or clear superiority in the quality or comprehensiveness of one 
study over others, a single published study is selected as the basis of the effect estimate. 
When several effect estimates for a pollutant and a given health endpoint have been 
selected, they are quantitatively combined or pooled to derive a more robust estimate of the 
relationship. The BenMAP Manual Technical Appendices provides details of the procedures 
used to combine multiple impact functions (Abt Associates, 2011). In general, we used fixed or 
random effects models to pool estimates from different single city studies of the same 
endpoint. Fixed effects pooling simply weights each study’s estimate by the inverse variance, 
giving more weight to studies with greater statistical power (lower variance). Random effects 
pooling accounts for both within-study variance and between-study variability, due, for 
example, to differences in population susceptibility. We used the fixed effects model as our null 
hypothesis and then determined whether the data suggest that we should reject this null 
hypothesis, in which case we would use the random effects model. Pooled impact functions are 
used to estimate hospital admissions and asthma exacerbations. When combining evidence 
across multi-city studies (e.g., cardiovascular hospital admission studies), we use equal weights 
pooling. The effect estimates drawn from each multi-city study are themselves pooled across a 
large number of urban areas. For this reason, we elected to give each study an equal weight 
rather than weighting by the inverse of the variance reported in each study. For more details on 
methods used to pool incidence estimates, see the BenMAP Manual Appendices (Abt 
Associates, 2011). 
Effect estimates selected for a given health endpoint were applied consistently across all 
locations nationwide. This applies to both impact functions defined by a single effect estimate 
and those defined by a pooling of multiple effect estimates. Although the effect estimate may, 
in fact, vary from one location to another (e.g., because of differences in population 
susceptibilities or differences in the composition of PM), location-specific effect estimates are 
generally not available. 
The specific studies from which effect estimates for the main analysis are drawn are 
included in Table 5-6. We highlight in blue those studies that have been added since the 
benefits analysis conducted for the MATS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2011d) and incorporated into the 
central benefits estimate. In all cases where effect estimates are drawn directly from 
epidemiological studies, standard errors are used as a partial representation of the uncertainty 
in the size of the effect estimate. Table 5-7 summarizes those health endpoints and studies we 
have included as in sensitivity analyses.

Table 5-5. Criteria Used When Selecting C-R Functions 
Consideration Comments 
Peer-Reviewed 
Research 
Peer-reviewed research is preferred to research that has not undergone the peer-review 
process. 
Study Type Among studies that consider chronic exposure (e.g., over a year or longer), prospective 
cohort studies are preferred over ecological studies because they control for important 
individual-level confounding variables that cannot be controlled for in ecological studies.  
Study Period Studies examining a relatively longer period of time (and therefore having more data) are 
preferred, because they have greater statistical power to detect effects. Studies that are 
more recent are also preferred because of possible changes in pollution mixes, medical 
care, and lifestyle over time. However, when there are only a few studies available, 
studies from all years will be included. 
Population Attributes The most technically appropriate measures of benefits would be based on impact 
functions that cover the entire sensitive population but allow for heterogeneity across 
age or other relevant demographic factors. In the absence of effect estimates specific to 
age, sex, preexisting condition status, or other relevant factors, it may be appropriate to 
select effect estimates that cover the broadest population to match with the desired 
outcome of the analysis, which is total national-level health impacts. When available, 
multi-city studies are preferred to single city studies because they provide a more 
generalizable representation of the concentration-response function. 
Study Size Studies examining a relatively large sample are preferred because they generally have 
more power to detect small magnitude effects. A large sample can be obtained in several 
ways, including through a large population or through repeated observations on a 
smaller population (e.g., through a symptom diary recorded for a panel of asthmatic 
children). 
Study Location U.S. studies are more desirable than non-U.S. studies because of potential differences in 
pollution characteristics, exposure patterns, medical care system, population behavior, 
and lifestyle. 
Pollutants Included in 
Model 
When modeling the effects of ozone and PM (or other pollutant combinations) jointly, it 
is important to use properly specified impact functions that include both pollutants. 
Using single-pollutant models in cases where both pollutants are expected to affect a 
health outcome can lead to double-counting when pollutants are correlated. 
Measure of PM For this analysis, impact functions based on PM2.5 are preferred to PM10 because of the 
focus on reducing emissions of PM2.5 precursors, and because air quality modeling was 
conducted for this size fraction of PM. Where PM2.5 functions are not available, PM10 
functions are used as surrogates, recognizing that there will be potential downward 
(upward) biases if the fine fraction of PM10 is more (less) toxic than the coarse fraction.  
Economically Valuable 
Health Effects 
Some health effects, such as forced expiratory volume and other technical 
measurements of lung function, are difficult to value in monetary terms. These health 
effects are not quantified in this analysis. 
Non-overlapping 
Endpoints 
Although the benefits associated with each individual health endpoint may be analyzed 
separately, care must be exercised in selecting health endpoints to include in the overall 
benefits analysis because of the possibility of double-counting of benefits.

5.6.3.1 PM2.5 Premature Mortality Effect Coefficients 
Both long- and short-term exposures to ambient levels of PM2.5 air pollution have been 
associated with increased risk of premature mortality. The size of the mortality effect estimates 
  
5-29 
from epidemiological studies, the serious nature of the effect itself, and the high monetary 
value ascribed to prolonging life make mortality risk reduction the most significant health 
endpoint quantified in this analysis. 
Although a number of uncertainties remain to be addressed by continued research 
(NRC, 2002), a substantial body of published scientific literature documents the correlation 
between elevated PM2.5 concentrations and increased mortality rates (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Time-
series methods have been used to relate short-term (often day-to-day) changes in PM2.5 
concentrations and changes in daily mortality rates up to several days after a period of elevated 
PM2.5 concentrations. Cohort methods have been used to examine the potential relationship 
between community-level PM2.5 exposures over multiple years (i.e., long-term exposures) and 
community-level annual mortality rates. Researchers have found statistically significant 
associations between PM2.5 and premature mortality using both types of studies. In general, the 
effect estimates based on the cohort studies are larger than those derived from time-series 
studies. When choosing between using short-term studies or cohort studies for estimating 
mortality benefits, cohort analyses are thought to capture more of the public health impact of 
exposure to air pollution over time because they account for the effects of long-term exposures 
as well as some fraction of short-term exposures (Kunzli et al., 2001; NRC, 2002). This section 
discusses some of the issues surrounding the estimation of PM2.5-related premature mortality. 
To demonstrate the sensitivity of the benefits estimates to various concentration-response 
estimates in the epidemiological literature, we present benefits estimates using several relative 
risk estimates from the largest long-term epidemiological studies as well as a U.S. EPA-
sponsored expert elicitation (Roman et al. 2008). The epidemiological studies from which these 
estimates are drawn are described below. The PM2.5 expert elicitation and the derivation of 
effect estimates from the expert elicitation results are described in the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS RIA 
(U.S. EPA, 2006a) and Roman et al. (2008). In the interest of brevity, we do not repeat those 
details here. 4 
                                                     
4 In summary, the goal of the study was to elicit from a sample of health experts probabilistic distributions 
describing uncertainty in estimates of the reduction in mortality among the adult U.S. population resulting from 
reductions in ambient annual average PM2.5 levels. These distributions were obtained through a formal interview 
protocol using methods designed to elicit subjective expert judgments. These experts were selected through a 
peer-nomination process and included experts in epidemiology, toxicology, and medicine. The elicitation 
interview consisted of a protocol of carefully structured questions, both qualitative and quantitative, about the 
nature of the PM2.5-mortality relationship questions requiring qualitative responses probed experts’ beliefs 
concerning key evidence and critical sources of uncertainty and enabled them to establish a conceptual basis 
supporting their quantitative judgments. The results of the full-scale study consist of twelve individual 
distributions for the coefficient or slope of the C-R function relating changes in annual average PM2.5 exposures 
  
5-30 
Over a dozen epidemiological studies demonstrate significant associations between 
various measures of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality, beginning with Lave and Seskin 
(1977). Most of the published studies found positive (but not always statistically significant) 
associations with available PM indices such as total suspended particles (TSP). However, 
exploration of alternative model specifications sometimes raised questions about causal 
relationships (e.g., Lipfert et al., 1989). These early “ecological cross-sectional” studies (Lave 
and Seskin, 1977; Ozkaynak and Thurston, 1987) were criticized for a number of methodological 
limitations, particularly for inadequate control at the individual level for variables that are 
potentially important in causing mortality, such as wealth, smoking, and diet. 
Over the last two decades, several studies using “prospective cohort” designs have been 
published that are consistent with the earlier body of literature. These “prospective cohort” 
studies reflect a significant improvement over the earlier work because they include individual 
level information with respect to health status and residence. Two prospective cohort groups, 
often referred to as the Harvard “Six Cities Study” (Dockery et al., 1993; Laden et al., 2006) and 
the “American Cancer Society or ACS study” (Pope et al., 1995; Pope et al., 2002; Pope et al., 
2004; Krewski et al., 2009), provide the most extensive analyses of ambient PM2.5 
concentrations and mortality. These studies have found consistent relationships between fine 
particle indicators and premature mortality across multiple locations in the United States. A 
third major data set comes from the California-based 7th Day Adventist Study (e.g., Abbey 
et al., 1999), which reported associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and mortality in 
men. Results from this cohort, however, have been inconsistent, the air quality results are not 
geographically representative of most of the United States, and the lifestyle of the population is 
not reflective of much of the U.S. population. Analysis is also available for a cohort of adult 
male veterans diagnosed with hypertension (Lipfert et al., 2000, 2003, 2006). The 
characteristics of this group also differ from the cohorts in the Six Cities and ACS studies as well 
as the 7th Day Adventist study with respect to income, race, health status, and smoking status. 
Unlike previous long-term analyses, this study found some associations between mortality and 
ozone but found inconsistent results for PM indicators. 
Given their consistent results and broad geographic coverage, and importance in 
informing the NAAQS development process, the Six Cities and ACS data have been particularly 
important in benefits analyses. The credibility of these two studies is further enhanced by the 
fact that the initial published studies (Pope et al., 1995; Dockery et al., 1993) were subject to 
                                                                                                                                                                           
to annual, adult all-cause mortality. The results have not been combined in order to preserve the breadth and 
diversity of opinion on the expert panel. Roman et al (2006). 
  
5-31 
extensive reexamination and reanalysis by an independent team of scientific experts 
commissioned by the Health Effect Institute (HEI) (Krewski et al., 2000). The final results of the 
reanalysis were then independently peer reviewed by a Special Panel of the HEI Health Review 
Committee. The results of these reanalyses confirmed and expanded the conclusions of the 
original investigators. While the HEI reexamination lends credibility to the original studies, it 
also highlights sensitivities concerning the relative impact of various pollutants, such as SO2, the 
potential role of education in mediating the association between pollution and mortality, and 
the influence of spatial correlation modeling. Further confirmation and extension of the 
findings of the 1993 Six Cities Study and the 1995 ACS study were recently completed using 
more recent air quality and a longer follow-up period for the ACS cohort was published over the 
past several years (Pope et al., 2002, 2004; Laden et al., 2006; Krewski et al., 2009). The follow 
up to the Harvard Six Cities Study both confirmed the effect size from the first analysis and 
provided additional confirmation that reductions in PM2.5 are associated with reductions in the 
risk of premature death. This additional evidence stems from the observed reductions in PM2.5 
in each city during the extended follow-up period. Laden et al. (2006) found that mortality rates 
consistently went down at a rate proportional to the observed reductions in PM2.5. 
A number of additional analyses have been conducted on the ACS cohort data (Pope 
et al., 2009). These studies have continued to find a strong significant relationship between 
PM2.5 and mortality outcomes and life expectancy. Specifically, much of the recent research has 
suggested a stronger relationship between cardiovascular mortality and lung cancer mortality 
with PM2.5, and a less significant relationship between respiratory-related mortality and PM2.5. 
The extended analyses of the ACS cohort data (Krewski et al., 2009) provides additional 
refinements to the analysis of PM-related mortality by (a) extending the follow-up period by 
2 years to the year 2000, for a total of 18 years; (b) incorporating almost double the number of 
urban areas (c) addressing spatial autocorrelation by incorporating ecological, or community-
level, co-variates; (d) performing an extensive spatial analysis using land use regression 
modeling in two large urban areas. These enhancements make this analysis well-suited for the 
assessment of mortality risk from long-term PM2.5 exposures for EPA benefits analyses. 
In developing and improving the methods for estimating and valuing the potential 
reductions in mortality risk over the years, EPA consulted with the Health Effects Subcommittee 
of the Science Advisory Board (SAB-HES). That panel recommended using long-term prospective 
cohort studies in estimating mortality risk reduction (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999). This 
recommendation has been confirmed by a report from the National Research Council, which 
stated that “it is essential to use the cohort studies in benefits analysis to capture all important 
  
5-32 
effects from air pollution exposure” (NRC, 2002, p. 108). NRC further notes that “the overall 
effect estimates may be a combination of effects from long-term exposure plus some fraction 
from short-term exposure. The amount of overlap is unknown” (NRC, 2002, p. 108-9). More 
specifically, the SAB recommended emphasis on the ACS study because it includes a much 
larger sample size and longer exposure interval and covers more locations (e.g., 50 cities 
compared to the Six Cities Study) than other studies of its kind. Because of the refinements in 
the extended follow-up analysis, the SAB-HES recommended using the Pope et al. (2002) study 
as the basis for the main mortality estimate for adults and suggests that alternate estimates of 
mortality generated using other cohort and time-series studies could be included as part of the 
sensitivity analysis (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a). In 2009, the SAB-HES again reviewed the choice of 
mortality risk coefficients for benefits analysis, concluding that “[t]he Krewski et al. (2009) 
findings, while informative, have not yet undergone the same degree of peer review as have 
the aforementioned studies. Thus, the HES recommends that EPA not use the Krewski et al. 
(2009) findings for generating the Primary Estimate” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010a). Since this time, the 
Krewski et al. (2009) has undergone additional peer review, which we believe strengthens the 
support for including this study in this RIA. For example, the PM ISA (U.S. EPA, 2009b), which 
was twice reviewed by Clean Air Scientific Review Committee (CASAC) (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009b, 
2009c), included this study among the key mortality studies. In addition, the risk assessment 
supporting the PM NAAQS (U.S. EPA, 2010b) utilized risk coefficients drawn from the Krewski et 
al. (2009) study, the most recent reanalysis of the ACS cohort data. The risk assessment cited a 
number of advantages that informed the selection of the Krewski et al. (2009) study as the 
source of the core effect estimates, including the extended period of observation, the rigorous 
examination of model forms and effect estimates, the coverage for ecological variables, and the 
large dataset with over 1.2 million individuals and 156 MSAs (U.S. EPA, 2010b). The CASAC also 
provided extensive peer review of the risk assessment and supported the use of effect 
estimates from this study (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009a, 2010b,c). 
As both the ACS and Six Cities studies have inherent strengths and weaknesses and the 
expert elicitation results encompass within their range the estimates from both the earlier ACS 
Study (Pope et al. 2002) and from the Laden et al. (2006) study, we present benefits estimates 
using RR estimates from the Krewski et al. (2009) (RR=1.06, 95% confidence intervals 1.04–1.08 
per 10µg/m3 increase in PM2.5) and Laden et al. (2006; RR=1.16, 95% confidence intervals 1.07–
1.26 per 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5) studies. For the ACS Study (Krewski et al., 2009), we use 
the all-cause mortality risk estimate based on the random-effects Cox proportional hazard 
model that incorporates 44 individual and 7 ecological co-variates, consistent with the 
Quantitative Health Risk Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2010b). Unlike the Pope 
  
5-33 
et al. (2002) study, Krewski et al. (2009) do not report a risk estimate based on an average 
between the initial monitoring period (1979–1983) and the follow-up period (1999–2000). 
When considering each time period from which we could select risk coefficients, we elected to 
use the estimate based on the 1999–2000 air quality monitoring period because it reflected 
more recent population exposures, a larger number of urban areas (116 vs. 58) and a larger 
population cohort (488,000 vs. 343,000). The relative risk estimate (1.06 per 10µg/m3 increase 
in PM2.5) is identical to the risk estimate drawn from the Pope et al. (2002) study, though the 
confidence interval around the Krewski et al. (2009) risk estimate is tighter. 
Presenting results using both ACS and Six Cities is consistent with other recent RIAs (e.g., 
U.S. EPA, 2006a, 2010c, 2011c, 2011d). EPA’s independent SAB also supported using these two 
cohorts for benefits, concluding that “the selection of these cohort studies as the underlying 
basis for PM mortality benefit estimates to be a good choice. These are widely cited, well 
studied and extensively reviewed data sets” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010a). 
In addition to the ACS and Six Cities cohorts described above, several recent cohort 
studies conducted in North America provide evidence for the relationship between long-term 
exposure to PM2.5 and the risk of premature death. Many of these additional cohort studies are 
described in the PM ISA (U.S. EPA, 2009) (and thus not summarized here). We describe the 
newer multi-state studies below.5,6 Table 5-8 provides the effect estimates from each of these 
cohort studies (new and included in the PM ISA) for all-cause, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, 
and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality as well as the lowest measured air quality level 
(LML) in the study. 
Puett et al. (2009) examined the risk of all-cause mortality and fatal congestive heart 
disease among a cohort of about 66,000 female nurses in 13 northeastern and midwestern 
states (i.e., the Nurses’ Health Study cohort) resulting from long-term exposure to PM2.5. 
Consistent with findings from previous cohort studies, the researchers found significant 
associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality and fatal coronary heart 
disease. Puett et al. (2011) examined the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among a 
cohort of 17,000 male health professionals with high socioeconomic status in 13 northeastern 
and midwestern states. The researchers found no association between long-term PM2.5 
                                                     
5 It is important to note that these newer studies have not been assessed in the context of an Integrated Science 
Assessment nor gone through review by the SAB. In addition, only the ACS and H6C cohort studies have been 
recommended by the SAB as appropriate for benefits analysis of national rulemakings. 
6 In this chapter, we only describe multi-state cohort studies. There are additional cohorts that focus on single 
cities, such as Gan et al. (2012) that we have not included. In Appendix 5B, we provide additional information 
regarding cohort studies in California, which is the only state for which we identified single state cohorts.

exposure and mortality, concluding that additional research is needed to determine whether 
men with higher socioeconomic status are less susceptible to cardiovascular outcomes 
associated with long-term particle exposure.

Crouse et al. (2012) found elevated risks of non-accidental and ischemic heart disease 
mortality associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5 from the period of 1991 to 2001 among 
a cohort of Canadian adults aged 25 and older. This study used a combination of monitored air 
quality data and remote-sensing (i.e., satellite) data to assign PM2.5 concentrations to the 
population cohort. Notably, the median annual mean PM2.5 levels observed, or modeled, in this 
study were 7.4 µg/m3 and the minimum value was 1.9 µg/m3. The authors note that these air 
quality values are significantly lower than those observed in either the ACS or Six Cities studies, 
which provides further evidence that PM effects may occur at very low annual mean PM2.5 
levels. 
Lepeule et al. (2012) evaluated the sensitivity of previous Six Cities results to model 
specifications, lower exposures, and averaging time using eleven additional years of cohort 
follow-up that incorporated recent lower exposures. The authors found significant associations 
between PM2.5 exposure and increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and lung cancer 
mortality. The authors also concluded that the concentration-response relationship was linear 
down to PM2.5 concentrations of 8 μg/m3, and that mortality rate ratios for PM2.5 fluctuated 
over time, but without clear trends, despite a substantial drop in the sulfate fraction. 
As further described in the mortality valuation discussion, we assume that there is a 
“cessation” lag between PM exposures and the total realization of changes in health effects. 
While the structure of the lag is uncertain, most of the premature deaths occur within the first 
couple years after the change in exposure (U.S. EPA, 2004c; Schwartz et al, 2008). Changes in 
the cessation lag assumptions do not change the total number of estimated deaths but rather 
the timing of those deaths. 
In addition to the adult mortality studies described above, several studies provide 
evidence for an association between PM exposure and respiratory inflammation and infection 
leading to premature mortality in children under 5 years of age. Specifically, the SAB-HES noted 
the release of the WHO Global Burden of Disease Study focusing on ambient air, which cites 
several recently published time-series studies relating daily PM exposure to mortality in 
children (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a). The SAB-HES also cites the study by Belanger et al. (2003) as 
corroborating findings linking PM exposure to increased respiratory inflammation and 
infections in children. Recently, a study by Chay and Greenstone (2003) found that reductions 
in TSP caused by the recession of 1981– 1982 were related to reductions in infant mortality at 
the county level. With regard to the cohort study conducted by Woodruff et al. (1997), the SAB-
HES notes several strengths of the study, including the use of a larger cohort drawn from a large 
number of metropolitan areas and efforts to control for a variety of individual risk factors in 
  
5-36 
infants (e.g., maternal educational level, maternal ethnicity, parental marital status, and 
maternal smoking status). Based on these findings, the SAB-HES recommends that EPA 
incorporate infant mortality into the primary benefits estimate and that infant mortality be 
evaluated using an impact function developed from the Woodruff et al. (1997) study (U.S. EPA-
SAB, 2004a). A more recent study by Woodruff et al. (2006) continues to find associations 
between PM2.5 and infant mortality. The study also found the most significant relationships with 
respiratory-related causes of death. We have not yet sought comment from the SAB on this 
more recent study and as such continue to rely on the earlier 1997 analysis. 
5.6.3.2 Nonfatal Acute Myocardial Infarctions (AMI) (Heart Attacks) 
Nonfatal heart attacks have been linked with short-term exposures to PM2.5 in the 
United States (Mustafić et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2001; Sullivan et al., 2005; Pope et al., 2006; 
Zanobetti and Schwartz, 2006; Zanobetti et al., 2009) and other countries (Poloniecki et al., 
1997; Barnett et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2005). In previous health impact assessments, we have 
relied upon a study by Peters et al. (2001) as the basis for the impact function estimating the 
relationship between PM2.5 and nonfatal heart attacks. The Peters et al. (2001) study exhibits a 
number of strengths. In particular, it includes a robust characterization of populations 
experiencing acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs). The researchers interviewed patients within 4 
days of their AMI events and, for inclusion in the study, patients were required to meet a series 
of criteria including minimum kinase levels, an identifiable onset of pain or other symptoms and 
the ability to indicate the time, place and other characteristics of their AMI pain in an interview. 
Since the publication of Peters et al. (2001), a number of other single and multi-city 
studies have appeared in the literature. These studies include Sullivan et al. (2005), which 
considered the risk of PM2.5-related hospitalization for AMIs in King County, WA; Pope et al. 
(2006), based in Wasatch Range, UT; Zanobetti and Schwartz (2006), based in Boston; and, 
Zanobetti et al. (2009), a multi-city study of 26 U.S. communities. Each of these single and 
multi-city studies, with the exception of Pope et al. (2006), measure AMIs using hospital 
discharge rates. Conversely, the Pope et al. (2006) study is based on a large registry with 
angiographically characterized patients—arguably a more precise indicator of AMI. Because the 
Pope et al. (2006) study reflected both myocardial infarctions and unstable angina, this 
produces a more comprehensive estimate of acute ischemic heart disease events than the 
other studies. However, unlike the Peters study (Peters et al., 2006), Pope and colleagues did 
not measure the time of symptom onset, and PM2.5 data were not measured on an hourly basis. 
  
5-37 
As a means of recognizing the strengths of the Peters study while also incorporating the 
newer evidence found in the four single and multi-city studies, we present a range of AMI 
estimates. The upper end of the range is calculated using the Peters study while the lower end 
of the range is the result of an equal-weights pooling of these four newer studies. It is 
important to note that when calculating the incidence of nonfatal AMI, the fraction of fatal 
heart attacks is subtracted to ensure that there is no double-counting with premature mortality 
estimates. Specifically, based on Rosamond et al. (1999), we apply an adjustment factor of 0.93 
in the concentration-response function to reflect the probability of survival 28 days after the 
heart attack. 
5.6.3.3 Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits 
Because of the availability of detailed hospital admission and discharge records, there is 
an extensive body of literature examining the relationship between hospital admissions and air 
pollution. For this reason, we pool together the incidence estimates using several different 
studies for many of the hospital admission endpoints. In addition, some studies have examined 
the relationship between air pollution and emergency department visits. Since most emergency 
department visits do not result in an admission to the hospital (i.e., most people going to the 
emergency department are treated and return home), we treat hospital admissions and 
emergency department visits separately, taking account of the fraction of emergency 
department visits that are admitted to the hospital. Specifically, within the baseline incidence 
rates, we parse out the scheduled hospital visits from unscheduled ones as well as the hospital 
visits that originated in the emergency department. 
The two main groups of hospital admissions estimated in this analysis are respiratory 
admissions and cardiovascular admissions. There is not much evidence linking PM2.5 with other 
types of hospital admissions. Both asthma- and cardiovascular-related visits have been linked to 
PM2.5 in the United States, though as we note below, we are able to assign an economic value 
to asthma-related events only. To estimate the effects of PM2.5 air pollution reductions on 
asthma-related ER visits, we use the effect estimate from a study of children 18 and under by 
Mar et al. (2010) and Slaughter et al. (2005). Both studies examine populations 0 to 99 in 
Washington State. Mar and colleagues perform their study in Tacoma, while Slaughter and 
colleagues base their study in Spokane. We apply random/fixed effects pooling to combine 
evidence across these two studies. 
To estimate avoided incidences of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with 
PM2.5, we used studies by Moolgavkar (2000), Zanobetti et al. (2009), Peng et al. (2008, 2009) 
  
5-38 
and Bell et al., (2008). Only Moolgavkar (2000) provided a separate effect estimate for adults 20 
to 64, while the remainder estimate risk among adults over 64.7 Total cardiovascular hospital 
admissions are thus the sum of the pooled estimate for adults over 65 and the single study 
estimate for adults 20 to 64. Cardiovascular hospital admissions include admissions for 
myocardial infarctions. To avoid double-counting benefits from reductions in myocardial 
infarctions when applying the impact function for cardiovascular hospital admissions, we first 
adjusted the baseline cardiovascular hospital admissions to remove admissions for myocardial 
infarctions. We applied equal weights pooling to the multi-city studies assessing risk among 
adults over 64 because these studies already incorporated pooling across the city-level 
estimates. One potential limitation of our approach is that while the Zanobetti et al. (2009) 
study assesses all cardiovascular risk, Bell et al. (2008), and Peng et al., (2008, 2009) studies 
estimate a subset of cardiovascular hospitalizations as well as certain cerebro- and peripheral-
vascular diseases. To address the potential for the pooling of these four studies to produce a 
biased estimate, we match the pooled risk estimate with a baseline incidence rate that excludes 
cerebro- and peripheral-vascular disease. An alternative approach would be to use the 
Zanobetti et al. (2009) study alone, though this would prevent us from drawing upon the 
strengths of the three multi-city studies. 
To estimate avoided incidences of respiratory hospital admissions associated with PM2.5, 
we used a number of studies examining total respiratory hospital admissions as well as asthma 
and chronic lung disease. We estimated impacts among three age groups: adults over 65, adults 
18 to 64 and children 0 to 17. For adults over 65, the multi-city study by Zanobetti et al. (2009) 
provides an effect estimate for total respiratory hospital admissions (defined as ICD codes 460–
519). Moolgavkar et al. (2003) examines PM2.5 and chronic lung disease hospital admissions 
(less asthma) in Los Angeles, CA among adults 18 to 64. For children 0 to 18, we pool two 
studies using random/fixed effects. The first is Babin et al. (2007) which assessed PM2.5 and 
asthma hospital admissions in Washington, DC among children 1 to 18; we adjusted the age 
range for this study to apply to children 0 to 18. The second is Sheppard et al. (2003) which 
assessed PM2.5 and asthma hospitalizations in Seattle, Washington, among children 0 to 18. 
                                                     
7 Note that the Moolgavkar (2000) study has not been updated to reflect the more stringent GAM convergence 
criteria. However, given that no other estimates are available for this age group, we chose to use the existing 
study. Given the very small (<5%) difference in the effect estimates for people 65 and older with cardiovascular 
hospital admissions between the original and reanalyzed results, we do not expect this choice to introduce 
much bias. For a discussion of the GAM convergence criteria, and how it affected the size of effect coefficients 
reported by time series epidemiological studies using NMMAPS data, see: 
http://www.healtheffects.org/Pubs/st-timeseries.htm. 
  
5-39 
5.6.3.4 Acute Health Events and School/Work Loss Days 
In addition to mortality, chronic illness, and hospital admissions, a number of acute 
health effects not requiring hospitalization are associated with exposure to PM2.5. The sources 
for the effect estimates used to quantify these effects are described below. 
Approximately 4% of U.S. children between the ages of 5 and 17 experience episodes of 
acute bronchitis annually (ALA, 2002). Acute bronchitis is characterized by coughing, chest 
discomfort, slight fever, and extreme tiredness, lasting for a number of days. According to the 
MedlinePlus medical encyclopedia,8 with the exception of cough, most acute bronchitis 
symptoms abate within 7 to 10 days. Incidence of episodes of acute bronchitis in children 
between the ages of 5 and 17 were estimated using an effect estimate developed from Dockery 
et al. (1996). Incidences of lower respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheezing, deep cough) in children 
aged 7 to 14 were estimated using an effect estimate from Schwartz and Neas (2000). 
Because asthmatics have greater sensitivity to stimuli (including air pollution), children 
with asthma can be more susceptible to a variety of upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., runny or 
stuffy nose; wet cough; and burning, aching, or red eyes). Research on the effects of air 
pollution on upper respiratory symptoms has thus focused on effects in asthmatics. Incidences 
of upper respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children aged 9 to 11 are estimated using an effect 
estimate developed from Pope et al. (1991). 
Health effects from air pollution can also result in missed days of work (either from 
personal symptoms or from caring for a sick family member). Days of work lost due to PM2.5 
were estimated using an effect estimate developed from Ostro (1987). Children may also be 
absent from school because of respiratory or other diseases caused by exposure to air 
pollution, but we have not quantified these effects for this rule. 
Minor restricted activity days (MRAD) result when individuals reduce most usual daily 
activities and replace them with less strenuous activities or rest, yet not to the point of missing 
work or school. For example, a mechanic who would usually be doing physical work most of the 
day will instead spend the day at a desk doing paper and phone work because of difficulty 
breathing or chest pain. The effect of PM2.5 on MRAD was estimated using an effect estimate 
derived from Ostro and Rothschild (1989). 
More recently published literature examining the relationship between short-term PM2.5 
exposure and acute respiratory symptoms was available in the PM ISA (U.S. EPA, 2009), but

proved to be unsuitable for use in this benefits analysis. In particular, the best available study 
(Patel et al., 2010) specified a population aged 13-20, which overlaps with the population in 
which we asses asthma exacerbation. As we describe in detail below, to avoid the chance of 
double-counting impacts, we do not estimate changes in acute respiratory symptoms and 
asthma exacerbation among populations of the same age. 
For this RIA, we have followed the SAB-HES recommendations regarding asthma 
exacerbations in developing the main estimate (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a). While certain studies of 
acute respiratory events characterize these impacts among only asthmatic populations, others 
consider the full population, including both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. For this reason, 
incidence estimates derived from studies focused only on asthmatics cannot be added to 
estimates from studies that consider the full population—to do so would double-count impacts. 
To prevent such double-counting, we estimated the exacerbation of asthma among children 
and excluded adults from the calculation. Asthma exacerbations occurring in adults are 
assumed to be captured in the general population endpoints such as work loss days and 
MRADs. Finally, note also the important distinction between the exacerbation of asthma among 
asthmatic populations, and the onset of asthma among populations not previously suffering 
from asthma; in this RIA, we quantify the exacerbation of asthma among asthmatic populations 
and not the onset of new cases of asthma. 
To characterize asthma exacerbations in children, we selected two studies (Ostro et al., 
2001; Mar et al., 2004) that followed panels of asthmatic children. Ostro et al. (2001) followed a 
group of 138 African-American children in Los Angeles for 13 weeks, recording daily 
occurrences of respiratory symptoms associated with asthma exacerbations (e.g., shortness of 
breath, wheeze, and cough). This study found a statistically significant association between 
PM2.5, measured as a 12-hour average, and the daily prevalence of shortness of breath and 
wheeze endpoints. Although the association was not statistically significant for cough, the 
results were still positive and close to significance; consequently, we decided to include this 
endpoint, along with shortness of breath and wheeze, in generating incidence estimates (see 
below). 
Mar et al. (2004) studied the effects of various size fractions of particulate matter on 
respiratory symptoms of adults and children with asthma, monitored over many months. The 
study was conducted in Spokane, Washington, a semiarid city with diverse sources of 
particulate matter. Data on respiratory symptoms and medication use were recorded daily by 
the study’s subjects, while air pollution data was collected by the local air agency and 
Washington State University. Subjects in the study consisted of 16 adults—the majority of 
  
5-41 
whom participated for over a year—and nine children, all of whom were studied for over eight 
months. Among the children, the authors found a strong association between cough symptoms 
and several metrics of particulate matter, including PM2.5. However, the authors found no 
association between respiratory symptoms and PM of any metric in adults. Mar et al. therefore 
concluded that the discrepancy in results between children and adults was due either to the 
way in which air quality was monitored, or a greater sensitivity of children than adults to 
increased levels of PM air pollution. 
We employed the following pooling approach in combining estimates generated using 
effect estimates from the two studies to produce a single asthma exacerbation incidence 
estimate. First, we used random/fixed effects pooling to combine the Ostro and Mar estimates 
for shortness of breath and cough. Next, we pooled the Ostro estimate of wheeze with the 
pooled cough and shortness of breath estimates to derive an overall estimate of asthma 
exacerbation. 
5.6.3.5 Effect Coefficients Selected for the Sensitivity Analyses 
Chronic Bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by mucus in the lungs and a 
persistent wet cough for at least 3 months a year for several years in a row. Chronic bronchitis 
affects an estimated 5% of the U.S. population (ALA, 1999). A limited number of studies have 
estimated the impact of air pollution on new incidences of chronic bronchitis. Schwartz (1993) 
and Abbey et al. (1995) provide evidence that long-term PM2.5 exposure gives rise to the 
development of chronic bronchitis in adults in the United States; these remain the two most 
recent studies observing a relationship between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the onset of 
chronic bronchitis in the U.S. The absence of newer studies finding a relationship between long-
term PM2.5 exposure and chronic bronchitis argues for moving this endpoint from the main 
benefits analysis to a sensitivity analysis. In their review of the scientific literature on chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the 
American Thoracic Society concluded that air pollution is “associated with COPD, but sufficient 
criteria for causation were not met” (Eisner et al., 2010). 
Stroke. The PM ISA (U.S. EPA, 2009) includes several new studies that have examined 
the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cerebrovascular events (U.S. EPA, 2009). Time-
series studies have generally been inconsistent with several studies showing positive 
associations (Dominici et al., 2006; Metzger et al., 2004; Lippman et al., 2000; Lisabeth et al., 
2008). Several other studies have demonstrated null or negative associations (Anderson et al., 
2001; Barnett et al., 2006; Peel et al., 2007). In general, these studies examined cerebrovascular 
  
5-42 
disease as a group, though a few studies partition ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes separately 
(Lisabeth et al., 2008). A key limitation of these time-series studies is that they use hospital 
discharge rates as the diagnosis and relatively short lags (0–2 days)—this is problematic, as 
discharge rates are an imperfect diagnosis and strokes may occur several days before admission 
to the hospital. 
Longer-term prospective cohort studies of PM2.5 and stroke include Miller et al. (2007), 
which estimated the change in risk among post-menopausal women enrolled in the Women’s 
Health Initiative (U.S. EPA, 2009b). After adjusting for age, race, smoking status, educational 
level, household income, body-mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, 
hazard ratios were estimated for the first cardiovascular event. Because this study considers 
first-time cardiovascular events, a key challenge to incorporating this study into a health impact 
assessment would be to match the baseline incidence rate correctly. 
Three factors argue for treating this endpoint in the sensitivity analysis: (1) the 
epidemiological literature examining PM-related cerebrovascular events is still evolving; (2) 
there are special uncertainties associated with quantifying this endpoint; (3) we have not yet 
identified an appropriate method for estimating the economic value of this endpoint. 
Cardiovascular Emergency Department Visits. A large number of recent U.S.-based 
studies provide support for an association between short-term increases in PM2.5 and increased 
risk of ED visits for ischemic heart diseases (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Both Metzger et al. (2004) and 
Tolbert et al. (2007) published interim results from the Study of Particles and Health in Atlanta 
(SOPHIA), finding a relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular emergency 
department visits. These cardiovascular emergency department visits are distinct from 
cardiovascular hospital admissions and non-fatal heart attacks. To ensure no double-counting, 
we excluded ICD-9-411 (ischemic heart disease) from the baseline incidence rates for 
cardiovascular emergency department visits. The principal challenge to incorporating these 
studies is the absence of readily-available economic valuation estimates for cardiovascular 
emergency department visits. Until we develop an approach for estimating the economic value 
of this endpoint, we will treat these ED visits as a sensitivity analysis. 
5.6.4 Unquantified Human Health Benefits 
Implementing the illustrative control strategy described in Chapter 4 would reduce 
emissions of directly emitted particles, SO2, and NOx. Although we have quantified many of the 
health benefits associated with reducing exposure to PM2.5, as shown in Table 5-2, we are 
  
5-43 
unable to quantify the health benefits associated with reducing ozone exposure, SO2 exposure, 
NO2 exposure or methylmercury exposure due to the absence of air quality modeling data for 
these pollutants in this analysis. Although we applied the rollback method to simulate the 
impact of attaining alternative combination of standard levels on ambient levels of PM2.5, this 
method does not simulate how the illustrative emission reductions would affect ambient levels 
of ozone, SO2, or NO2. Furthermore, the air quality modeling conducted for this analysis did not 
assess mercury, so we are unable to estimate mercury deposition associated with the 
illustrative controls or subsequent bioaccumulation and exposure. Below we provide a 
qualitative description these health benefits. In general, previous analyses have shown that the 
monetized value of these additional health benefits is much smaller than PM2.5-related benefits 
(U.S. EPA, 2010a, 2010c, 2010d). The extent to which ozone, SO2, NOx, and/or methylmercury 
would be reduced would depend on the specific control strategy used to reduce PM2.5 in a given 
area. 
Reducing NOx emissions also reduces ozone concentrations in most areas. Reducing 
ambient ozone concentrations is associated with significant human health benefits, including 
mortality and respiratory morbidity (U.S. EPA, 2008a, 2010d). Epidemiological researchers have 
associated ozone exposure with adverse health effects in numerous toxicological, clinical and 
epidemiological studies (U.S. EPA, 2006b). When adequate data and resources are available, 
EPA generally quantifies several health effects associated with exposure to ozone (e.g., U.S. 
EPA, 2008a, 2010d, 2011a, 2011c). These health effects include respiratory morbidity such as 
asthma attacks, hospital and emergency department visits, school loss days, as well as 
premature mortality. The scientific literature suggests that exposure to ozone is also associated 
with chronic respiratory damage and premature aging of the lungs, but EPA has not quantified 
these effects in benefits analyses previously. 
Following an extensive evaluation of health evidence from epidemiologic and laboratory 
studies, the Integrated Science Assessment for Sulfur Dioxide—Health Criteria (SO2 ISA) 
concluded that there is a causal relationship between respiratory health effects and short-term 
exposure to SO2 (U.S. EPA, 2008c). The immediate effect of SO2 on the respiratory system in 
humans is bronchoconstriction. Asthmatics are more sensitive to the effects of SO2 likely 
resulting from preexisting inflammation associated with this disease. A clear concentration-
response relationship has been demonstrated in laboratory studies following exposures to SO2 
at concentrations between 20 and 100 ppb, both in terms of increasing severity of effect and 
percentage of asthmatics adversely affected. Based on our review of this information, we 
identified four short-term morbidity endpoints that the SO2 ISA identified as a “causal 
  
5-44 
relationship”: asthma exacerbation, respiratory-related emergency department visits, and 
respiratory-related hospitalizations. The differing evidence and associated strength of the 
evidence for these different effects is described in detail in the SO2 ISA. The SO2 ISA also 
concluded that the relationship between short-term SO2 exposure and premature mortality was 
“suggestive of a causal relationship” because it is difficult to attribute the mortality risk effects 
to SO2 alone. Although the SO2 ISA stated that studies are generally consistent in reporting a 
relationship between SO2 exposure and mortality, there was a lack of robustness of the 
observed associations to adjustment for pollutants. We did not quantify these benefits due to 
data constraints. 
Epidemiological researchers have associated NO2 exposure with adverse health effects 
in numerous toxicological, clinical and epidemiological studies, as described in the Integrated 
Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen—Health Criteria (NO2 ISA) (U.S. EPA, 2008b). The 
NO2 ISA provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence of health and environmental 
effects of NO2. The NO2 ISA concluded that the evidence “is sufficient to infer a likely causal 
relationship between short-term NO2 exposure and adverse effects on the respiratory system.” 
These epidemiologic and experimental studies encompass a number of endpoints including 
emergency department visits and hospitalizations, respiratory symptoms, airway 
hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, and lung function. Effect estimates from 
epidemiologic studies conducted in the United States and Canada generally indicate a 2–20% 
increase in risks for ED visits and hospital admissions and higher risks for respiratory symptoms. 
The NO2 ISA concluded that the relationship between short-term NO2 exposure and premature 
mortality was “suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship” because it is difficult 
to attribute the mortality risk effects to NO2 alone. Although the NO2 ISA stated that studies 
consistently reported a relationship between NO2 exposure and mortality, the effect was 
generally smaller than that for other pollutants such as PM. We did not quantify these benefits 
due to data constraints. 
5.6.5 Economic Valuation Estimates 
Reductions in ambient concentrations of air pollution generally lower the risk of future 
adverse health effects for a large population. Therefore, the appropriate economic measure is 
WTP for changes in risk of a health effect rather than WTP for a health effect that would occur 
with certainty (Freeman, 1993). Epidemiological studies generally provide estimates of the 
relative risks of a particular health effect that is avoided because of a reduction in air pollution. 
We converted those changes in risk to units of avoided statistical incidence for ease of 
  
5-45 
presentation. We calculated the value of avoided statistical incidences by dividing individual 
WTP for a risk reduction by the related observed change in risk. 
WTP estimates generally are not available for some health effects, such as hospital 
admissions. In these cases, we instead used the cost of treating or mitigating the effect to 
estimate the economic value. These cost-of-illness (COI) estimates generally understate the 
true value of reducing the risk of a health effect, because they reflect the direct expenditures 
related to treatment, but not the value of avoided pain and suffering (Harrington and Portney, 
1987; Berger, 1987). We provide unit values for health endpoints (along with information on 
the distribution of the unit value) in Table 5-9. All values are in constant year 2006 dollars, 
adjusted for growth in real income out to 2020 using projections provided by Standard and 
Poor’s. Economic theory argues that WTP for most goods (such as environmental protection) 
will increase if real income increases. Several of the valuation studies used in this analysis were 
conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and we are in the process of reviewing the 
literature to update these unit values. Because real income has grown since the studies were 
conducted, people’s willingness to pay for reductions in the risk of premature death and 
disease likely has grown as well. We do not have data to adjust the COI estimates for 
projections of medical costs in the future, which leads to an inherent though unavoidable 
inconsistency between COI- and WTP-based estimates. For these two reasons, these cost-of-
illness estimates may underestimate the economic value of avoided health impacts. The 
discussion below provides additional details on valuing PM2.5-related related endpoints.

5.6.6.1 Mortality Valuation 
Following the advice of the EEAC of the SAB, EPA currently uses the value of statistical 
life (VSL) approach in calculating the main estimate of mortality benefits, because we believe 
this calculation provides the most reasonable single estimate of an individual’s willingness to 
trade off money for reductions in mortality risk (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2000). The VSL approach is a 
summary measure for the value of small changes in mortality risk experienced by a large 
number of people. For a period of time (2004–2008), the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) 
valued mortality risk reductions using a VSL estimate derived from a limited analysis of some of 
the available studies. OAR arrived at a VSL using a range of $1 million to $10 million (2000$) 
consistent with two meta-analyses of the wage-risk literature. The $1 million value represented 
the lower end of the interquartile range from the Mrozek and Taylor (2002) meta-analysis of 33 
studies. The $10 million value represented the upper end of the interquartile range from the 
Viscusi and Aldy (2003) meta-analysis of 43 studies. The mean estimate of $5.5 million (2000$) 
was also consistent with the mean VSL of $5.4 million estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006) meta-
analysis. However, the Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-
makings nor subjected the interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the 
Science Advisory Board (SAB) or other peer-review group. 
During this time, the Agency continued work to update its guidance on valuing mortality 
risk reductions, including commissioning a report from meta-analytic experts to evaluate 
methodological questions raised by EPA and the SAB on combining estimates from the various 
data sources. In addition, the Agency consulted several times with the Science Advisory Board 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) on the issue. With input from the 
meta-analytic experts, the SAB-EEAC advised the Agency to update its guidance using specific, 
appropriate meta-analytic techniques to combine estimates from unique data sources and 
different studies, including those using different methodologies (i.e., wage-risk and stated 
preference) (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2007). 
Until updated guidance is available, the Agency determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the SAB-EEAC advice it has received. Therefore, the 
Agency has decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the Guidelines 
for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)1 while the Agency continues its efforts to 
update its guidance on this issue. This approach calculates a mean value across VSL estimates 
                                                     
1 In the updated Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2010e), EPA retained the VSL endorsed by 
the SAB with the understanding that further updates to the mortality risk valuation guidance would be 
forthcoming in the near future.

derived from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 and 
1991. The mean VSL across these studies is $4.8 million (1990$) or $6.3 million (2000$).2 The 
Agency is committed to using scientifically sound, appropriately reviewed evidence in valuing 
mortality risk reductions and has made significant progress in responding to the SAB-EEAC’s 
specific recommendations. In the process, the Agency has identified a number of important 
issues to be considered in updating its mortality risk valuation estimates. These are detailed in a 
white paper on “Valuing Mortality Risk Reductions in Environmental Policy,” which recently 
underwent review by EPA’s independent Science Advisory Board). A meeting with the SAB on 
this paper was held on March 14, 2011 and formal recommendations were transmitted on 
July 29, 2011 (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2011). Draft guidance responding to SAB recommendations will be 
developed shortly. 
The economics literature concerning the appropriate method for valuing reductions in 
premature mortality risk is still developing. The adoption of a value for the projected reduction 
in the risk of premature mortality is the subject of continuing discussion within the economics 
and public policy analysis community. EPA strives to use the best economic science in its 
analyses. Given the mixed theoretical finding and empirical evidence regarding adjustments to 
VSL for risk and population characteristics, we use a single VSL for all reductions in mortality 
risk. 
Although there are several differences between the labor market studies EPA uses to 
derive a VSL estimate and the PM2.5 air pollution context addressed here, those differences in 
the affected populations and the nature of the risks imply both upward and downward 
adjustments. Table 5-10 lists some of these differences and the expected effect on the VSL 
estimate for air pollution-related mortality. In the absence of a comprehensive and balanced 
set of adjustment factors, EPA believes it is reasonable to continue to use the $4.8 million 
(1990$) value adjusted for inflation and income growth over time while acknowledging the 
significant limitations and uncertainties in the available literature. 
The SAB-EEAC has reviewed many potential VSL adjustments and the state of the 
economics literature. The SAB-EEAC advised EPA to “continue to use a wage-risk-based VSL as 
its primary estimate, including appropriate sensitivity analyses to reflect the uncertainty of 
these estimates,” and that “the only risk characteristic for which adjustments to the VSL can be 
made is the timing of the risk” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2000). In developing our main estimate of the 
                                                     
2 In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2006$) and to account for income 
growth to 2020. After applying these adjustments to the $6.3 million value, the VSL is $8.9M.  
  
5-52 
benefits of premature mortality reductions, we have followed this advice. For premature 
mortality, we assume that there is a “cessation” lag between PM exposures and the total 
realization of changes in health effects. We assumed for this analysis that some of the 
incidences of premature mortality related to PM2.5 exposures occur in a distributed fashion over 
the 20 years following exposure and discounted over the period between exposure and 
premature mortality. Although the structure of the lag is uncertain, EPA follows the advice of 
the SAB-HES to assume a segmented lag structure characterized by 30% of mortality reductions 
in the first year, 50% over years 2 to 5, and 20% over the years 6 to 20 after the reduction in 
PM2.5 (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004c). Additional cessation lag structures are described and assessed in 
Appendix 5B of the RIA. To take this into account in the valuation of reductions in premature 
mortality, we discount the value of premature mortality occurring in future years using rates of 
3% and 7%.3 Changes in the cessation lag assumptions do not change the total number of 
estimated deaths but rather the timing of those deaths. As such, the monetized benefits using a 
7% discount rate are only approximately 10% less than the monetized benefits using a 3% 
discount rate. Further discussion of this topic appears in EPA’s Guidelines for Preparing 
Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2010e).

Uncertainties Specific to Premature Mortality Valuation. The economic benefits 
associated with reductions in the risk of premature mortality are the largest category of 
monetized benefits of the CSAPR. In addition, in prior analyses, EPA has identified valuation of 
mortality-related benefits as the largest contributor to the range of uncertainty in monetized 
                                                     
3 The choice of a discount rate, and its associated conceptual basis, is a topic of ongoing discussion within the 
federal government. To comply with Circular A-4, EPA provides monetized benefits using discount rates of 3% 
and 7% (OMB, 2003). A 3% discount reflects reliance on a “social rate of time preference” discounting concept. 
A 7% rate is consistent with an “opportunity cost of capital” concept to reflect the time value of resources 
directed to meet regulatory requirements.

benefits (Mansfield et al., 2009).4 Because of the uncertainty in estimates of the value of 
reducing premature mortality risk, it is important to adequately characterize and understand 
the various types of economic approaches available for valuing reductions in mortality risk. 
Such an assessment also requires an understanding of how alternative valuation approaches 
reflect that some individuals may be more susceptible to air pollution-induced mortality or 
reflect differences in the nature of the risk presented by air pollution relative to the risks 
studied in the relevant economics literature. 
The health science literature on air pollution indicates that several human 
characteristics affect the degree to which mortality risk affects an individual. For example, some 
age groups appear to be more susceptible to air pollution than others (e.g., the elderly and 
children). Health status prior to exposure also affects susceptibility. An ideal benefits estimate 
of mortality risk reduction would reflect these human characteristics, in addition to an 
individual’s WTP to improve one’s own chances of survival plus WTP to improve other 
individuals’ survival rates. The ideal measure would also take into account the specific nature of 
the risk reduction commodity that is provided to individuals, as well as the context in which risk 
is reduced. To measure this value, it is important to assess how reductions in air pollution 
reduce the risk of dying from the time that reductions take effect onward and how individuals 
value these changes. Each individual’s survival curve, or the probability of surviving beyond a 
given age, should shift as a result of an environmental quality improvement. For example, 
changing the current probability of survival for an individual also shifts future probabilities of 
that individual’s survival. This probability shift will differ across individuals because survival 
curves depend on such characteristics as age, health state, and the current age to which the 
individual is likely to survive. 
Although a survival curve approach provides a theoretically preferred method for 
valuing the benefits of reduced risk of premature mortality associated with reducing air 
pollution, the approach requires a great deal of data to implement. The economic valuation 
literature does not yet include good estimates of the value of this risk reduction commodity. As 
a result, in this study we value reductions in premature mortality risk using the VSL approach. 
                                                     
4 This conclusion was based on an assessment of uncertainty based on statistical error in epidemiological effect 
estimates and economic valuation estimates. Additional sources of model error such as those examined in the 
PM2.5 mortality expert elicitation (Roman et al., 2008) may result in different conclusions about the relative 
contribution of sources of uncertainty. 
  
5-54 
Other uncertainties specific to premature mortality valuation include the following: 
 Across-study variation: There is considerable uncertainty as to whether the available 
literature on VSL provides adequate estimates of the VSL for risk reductions from air 
pollution reduction. Although there is considerable variation in the analytical designs 
and data used in the existing literature, the majority of the studies involve the value 
of risks to a middle-aged working population. Most of the studies examine 
differences in wages of risky occupations, using a hedonic wage approach. Certain 
characteristics of both the population affected and the mortality risk facing that 
population are believed to affect the average WTP to reduce the risk. The 
appropriateness of a distribution of WTP based on the current VSL literature for 
valuing the mortality-related benefits of reductions in air pollution concentrations 
therefore depends not only on the quality of the studies (i.e., how well they 
measure what they are trying to measure), but also on the extent to which the risks 
being valued are similar and the extent to which the subjects in the studies are 
similar to the population affected by changes in pollution concentrations. 
 Level of risk reduction: The transferability of estimates of the VSL from the wage-risk 
studies to the context of the PM NAAQS analysis rests on the assumption that, 
within a reasonable range, WTP for reductions in mortality risk is linear in risk 
reduction. For example, suppose a study provides a result that the average WTP for 
a reduction in mortality risk of 1/100,000 is $50, but that the actual mortality risk 
reduction resulting from a given pollutant reduction is 1/10,000. If WTP for 
reductions in mortality risk is linear in risk reduction, then a WTP of $50 for a 
reduction of 1/100,000 implies a WTP of $500 for a risk reduction of 1/10,000 
(which is 10 times the risk reduction valued in the study). Under the assumption of 
linearity, the estimate of the VSL does not depend on the particular amount of risk 
reduction being valued. This assumption has been shown to be reasonable provided 
the change in the risk being valued is within the range of risks evaluated in the 
underlying studies (Rowlatt et al., 1998). 
 Voluntariness of risks evaluated: Although job-related mortality risks may differ in 
several ways from air pollution-related mortality risks, the most important 
difference may be that job-related risks are incurred voluntarily, or generally 
assumed to be, whereas air pollution-related risks are incurred involuntarily. Some 
evidence suggests that people will pay more to reduce involuntarily incurred risks 
than risks incurred voluntarily. If this is the case, WTP estimates based on wage-risk 
studies may understate WTP to reduce involuntarily incurred air pollution-related 
mortality risks. 
 Sudden versus protracted death: A final important difference related to the nature of 
the risk may be that some workplace mortality risks tend to involve sudden, 
catastrophic events, whereas air pollution-related risks tend to involve longer 
periods of disease and suffering prior to death. Some evidence suggests that WTP to 
  
5-55 
avoid a risk of a protracted death involving prolonged suffering and loss of dignity 
and personal control is greater than the WTP to avoid a risk (of identical magnitude) 
of sudden death. To the extent that the mortality risks addressed in this assessment 
are associated with longer periods of illness or greater pain and suffering than are 
the risks addressed in the valuation literature, the WTP measurements employed in 
the present analysis would reflect a downward bias. 
 Self-selection and skill in avoiding risk: Recent research (Shogren and Stamland, 
2002) suggests that VSL estimates based on hedonic wage studies may overstate the 
average value of a risk reduction. This is based on the fact that the risk-wage trade-
off revealed in hedonic studies reflects the preferences of the marginal worker (i.e., 
that worker who demands the highest compensation for his risk reduction). This 
worker must have either a higher workplace risk than the average worker, a lower 
risk tolerance than the average worker, or both. However, the risk estimate used in 
hedonic studies is generally based on average risk, so the VSL may be upwardly 
biased because the wage differential and risk measures do not match. 
 Baseline risk and age: Recent research (Smith, Pattanayak, and Van Houtven, 2006) 
finds that because individuals reevaluate their baseline risk of death as they age, the 
marginal value of risk reductions does not decline with age as predicted by some 
lifetime consumption models. This research supports findings in recent stated 
preference studies that suggest only small reductions in the value of mortality risk 
reductions with increasing age. 
5.6.6.2 Nonfatal Myocardial Infarctions Valuation 
We were not able to identify a suitable WTP value for reductions in the risk of nonfatal 
heart attacks. Instead, we use a COI unit value with two components: the direct medical costs 
and the opportunity cost (lost earnings) associated with the illness event. Because the costs 
associated with a myocardial infarction extend beyond the initial event itself, we consider costs 
incurred over several years. Using age-specific annual lost earnings estimated by Cropper and 
Krupnick (1990) and a 3% discount rate, we estimated a rounded present discounted value in 
lost earnings (in 2000$) over 5 years due to a myocardial infarction of $8,800 for someone 
between the ages of 25 and 44, $13,000 for someone between the ages of 45 and 54, and 
$75,000 for someone between the ages of 55 and 65. The rounded corresponding age-specific 
estimates of lost earnings (in 2000$) using a 7% discount rate are $7,900, $12,000, and $67,000, 
respectively. Cropper and Krupnick (1990) do not provide lost earnings estimates for 
populations under 25 or over 65. As such, we do not include lost earnings in the cost estimates 
for these age groups. 
We found three possible sources in the literature of estimates of the direct medical 
costs of myocardial infarction, which provide significantly different values (see Table 5-11):

c Using a 3% discount rate. Discounted values as reported in the study. 
 Wittels et al. (1990) estimated expected total medical costs of myocardial infarction 
over 5 years to be $51,000 (rounded in 1986$) for people who were admitted to the 
hospital and survived hospitalization. (There does not appear to be any discounting 
used.) This estimated cost is based on a medical cost model, which incorporated 
therapeutic options, projected outcomes, and prices (using “knowledgeable 
cardiologists” as consultants). The model used medical data and medical decision 
algorithms to estimate the probabilities of certain events and/or medical procedures 
being used. The authors note that the average length of hospitalization for acute 
myocardial infarction has decreased over time (from an average of 12.9 days in 1980 
to an average of 11 days in 1983). Wittels et al. used 10 days as the average in their 
study. It is unclear how much further the length of stay for myocardial infarction 
may have decreased from 1983 to the present. The average length of stay for ICD 
code 410 (myocardial infarction) in the year-2000 Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality (AHRQ) HCUP database is 5.5 days (AHRQ, 2000). However, this may 
include patients who died in the hospital (not included among our nonfatal 
myocardial infarction cases), and whose length of stay was therefore substantially 
shorter than it would be if they had not died. 
 Eisenstein et al. (2001) estimated 10-year costs of $45,000 in rounded 1997$ (using 
a 3% discount rate) for myocardial infarction patients, using statistical prediction 
(regression) models to estimate inpatient costs. Only inpatient costs (physician fees 
and hospital costs) were included. 
 Russell et al. (1998) estimated first-year direct medical costs of treating nonfatal 
myocardial infarction of $16,000 (in rounded 1995$) and $1,100 annually thereafter 
for a 10-year period. 
As noted above, the estimates from these three studies are substantially different, and 
we have not adequately resolved the sources of differences in the estimates. Because the 
  
5-57 
wage-related opportunity cost estimates from Cropper and Krupnick (1990) cover a 5-year 
period, we used estimates for medical costs that similarly cover a 5-year period (i.e., estimates 
from Wittels et al. (1990) and Russell et al. (1998). We used a simple average of the two 5-year 
estimates, or rounded to $66,000, and added it to the 5-year opportunity cost estimate. The 
resulting estimates are given in Table 5-12.

5.6.6 Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Valuation 
In the absence of estimates of societal WTP to avoid hospital visits/admissions for 
specific illnesses, we derive COI estimates for use in the benefits analysis. The International 
Classification of Diseases (WHO, 1977) code-specific COI estimates used in this analysis consist 
of estimated hospital charges and the estimated opportunity cost of time spent in the hospital 
(based on the average length of a hospital stay for the illness). We based all estimates of 
hospital charges and length of stays on statistics provided by the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality’s Healthcare Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 
(AHRQ, 2007). We estimated the opportunity cost of a day spent in the hospital as the value of 
the lost daily wage, regardless of whether the hospitalized individual is in the workforce. To 
estimate the lost daily wage, we divided the median weekly wage reported by the 2007 
American Community Survey (ACS) by five and deflated the result to year 2006$ using the CPI-U 
“all items” (Abt Associates, 2011). The resulting national average lost daily wage is $134. The 
total cost-of-illness estimate for an ICD code-specific hospital stay lasting n days, then, was the 
mean hospital charge plus $134 multiplied by n. In general, the mean length of stay has 
decreased since the 2000 database used in previous version of BenMAP while the mean 
  
5-58 
hospital charge has increased. We provide the rounded unit values in 2000$ for the COI 
functions used in this analysis in Table 5-13.

To value asthma emergency department visits, we used a simple average of two 
estimates from the health economics literature. The first estimate comes from Smith et al. 
(1997), who reported approximately 1.2 million asthma-related emergency department visits in 
1987, at a total cost of $186.5 million (1987$). The average cost per visit that year was $155; in 
2006$, that cost was $401 (using the CPI-U for medical care to adjust to 2006$). The second 
estimate comes from Stanford et al. (1999), who reported the cost of an average asthma-
related emergency department visit at $335, based on 1996–1997 data. A simple average of the 
two estimates yields a unit value of $368. 
5.6.7 Minor Restricted Activity Days Valuation 
No studies are reported to have estimated WTP to avoid a minor restricted activity day. 
However, Neumann et al. (1994) derived an estimate of willingness to pay to avoid a minor 
respiratory restricted activity day, using estimates from Tolley et al. (1986) of WTP for avoiding 
a combination of coughing, throat congestion and sinusitis. This estimate of WTP to avoid a 
minor respiratory restricted activity day is $38 (1990$), or about $62 (2006$). Although Ostro 
and Rothschild (1989) statistically linked ozone and minor restricted activity days, it is likely that 
most MRADs associated with ozone and PM2.5 exposure are, in fact, minor respiratory restricted 
activity days. For the purpose of valuing this health endpoint, we used the estimate of mean 
WTP to avoid a minor respiratory restricted activity day. 
  
5-59 
5.6.8 Growth in WTP Reflecting National Income Growth Over Time 
Our analysis accounts for expected growth in real income over time. This is a distinct 
concept from inflation and currency year. Economic theory argues that WTP for most goods 
(such as environmental protection) will increase if real incomes increase. There is substantial 
empirical evidence that the income elasticity5 of WTP for health risk reductions is positive, 
although there is uncertainty about its exact value. Thus, as real income increases, the WTP for 
environmental improvements also increases. Although many analyses assume that the income 
elasticity of WTP is unit elastic (i.e., a 10% higher real income level implies a 10% higher WTP to 
reduce risk changes), empirical evidence suggests that income elasticity is substantially less 
than one and thus relatively inelastic. As real income rises, the WTP value also rises but at a 
slower rate than real income. 
The effects of real income changes on WTP estimates can influence benefits estimates 
in two different ways: through real income growth between the year a WTP study was 
conducted and the year for which benefits are estimated, and through differences in income 
between study populations and the affected populations at a particular time. Empirical 
evidence of the effect of real income on WTP gathered to date is based on studies examining 
the former. The Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (EEAC) of the Science Advisory 
Board (SAB) advised EPA to adjust WTP for increases in real income over time but not to adjust 
WTP to account for cross-sectional income differences “because of the sensitivity of making 
such distinctions, and because of insufficient evidence available at present” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2000). An advisory by another committee associated with the SAB, the Advisory Council on 
Clean Air Compliance Analysis, has provided conflicting advice. While agreeing with “the 
general principle that the willingness to pay to reduce mortality risks is likely to increase with 
growth in real income” and that “[t]he same increase should be assumed for the WTP for 
serious nonfatal health effects,” they note that “given the limitations and uncertainties in the 
available empirical evidence, the Council does not support the use of the proposed adjustments 
for aggregate income growth as part of the primary analysis” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004b). Until these 
conflicting advisories have been reconciled, EPA will continue to adjust valuation estimates to 
reflect income growth using the methods described below, while providing sensitivity analyses 
for alternative income growth adjustment factors. 
Based on a review of the available income elasticity literature, we adjusted the valuation 
of human health benefits upward to account for projected growth in real U.S. income. Faced 
                                                     
5 Income elasticity is a common economic measure equal to the percentage change in WTP for a 1% change in 
income. 
  
5-60 
with a dearth of estimates of income elasticities derived from time-series studies, we applied 
estimates derived from cross-sectional studies in our analysis. Details of the procedure can be 
found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999). An abbreviated description of the procedure we used 
to account for WTP for real income growth between 1990 and 2020 is presented below. 
Reported income elasticities suggest that the severity of a health effect is a primary 
determinant of the strength of the relationship between changes in real income and WTP. As 
such, we use different elasticity estimates to adjust the WTP for minor health effects, severe 
and chronic health effects, and premature mortality. Note that because of the variety of 
empirical sources used in deriving the income elasticities, there may appear to be 
inconsistencies in the magnitudes of the income elasticities relative to the severity of the 
effects (a priori one might expect that more severe outcomes would show less income elasticity 
of WTP). We have not imposed any additional restrictions on the empirical estimates of income 
elasticity. One explanation for the seeming inconsistency is the difference in timing of 
conditions. WTP for minor illnesses is often expressed as a short term payment to avoid a single 
episode. WTP for major illnesses and mortality risk reductions are based on longer term 
measures of payment (such as wages or annual income). Economic theory suggests that 
relationships become more elastic as the length of time grows, reflecting the ability to adjust 
spending over a longer time period. Based on this theory, it would be expected that WTP for 
reducing long term risks would be more elastic than WTP for reducing short term risks. We also 
expect that the WTP for improved visibility in Class I areas would increase with growth in real 
income. The relative magnitude of the income elasticity of WTP for visibility compared with 
those for health effects suggests that visibility is not as much of a necessity as health, thus, WTP 
is more elastic with respect to income. The elasticity values used to adjust estimates of benefits 
in 2020 are presented in Table 5-14. 
Table 5-14. Elasticity Values Used to Account for Projected Real Income Growtha 
Benefit Category Central Elasticity Estimate 
Minor Health Effect 0.14 
Severe and Chronic Health Effects 0.45 
Premature Mortality 0.40 
a Derivation of estimates can be found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999). COI estimates are not adjusted for 
income growth. 
In addition to elasticity estimates, projections of real gross domestic product (GDP) and 
populations from 1990 to 2020 are needed to adjust benefits to reflect real per capita income 
  
5-61 
growth. For consistency with the emissions and benefits modeling, we used national population 
estimates for the years 1990 to 1999 based on U.S. Census Bureau estimates (Hollman, Mulder, 
and Kallan, 2000). These population estimates are based on application of a cohort-component 
model applied to 1990 U.S. Census data projections (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2000). For the years 
between 2000 and 2020, we applied growth rates based on the U.S. Census Bureau projections 
to the U.S. Census estimate of national population in 2000. We used projections of real GDP 
provided in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) for the years 1990 to 2010.6 We used projections of 
real GDP (in chained 1996 dollars) provided by Standard and Poor’s (2000) for the years 2010 to 
2020.7 
Using the method outlined in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) and the population and 
income data described above, we calculated WTP adjustment factors for each of the elasticity 
estimates listed in Table 5-15. Benefits for each of the categories (minor health effects, severe 
and chronic health effects, premature mortality, and visibility) are adjusted by multiplying the 
unadjusted benefits by the appropriate adjustment factor. Note that, for premature mortality, 
we applied the income adjustment factor to the present discounted value of the stream of 
avoided mortalities occurring over the lag period. Because of a lack of data on the dependence 
of COI and income and a lack of data on projected growth in average wages, no adjustments are 
made to benefits based on the COI approach or to work loss days and worker productivity. This 
assumption leads us to underpredict benefits in future years because it is likely that increases in 
real U.S. income would also result in increased COI (due, for example, to increases in wages 
paid to medical workers) and increased cost of work loss days and lost worker productivity 
(reflecting that if worker incomes are higher, the losses resulting from reduced worker 
production would also be higher).

Through 2007 (1997). Note that projections for 2007 to 2010 are based on average GDP growth rates between 
1999 and 2007. 
7 In previous analyses, we used the Standard and Poor’s projections of GDP directly. This led to an apparent 
discontinuity in the adjustment factors between 2010 and 2011. We refined the method by applying the 
relative growth rates for GDP derived from the Standard and Poor’s projections to the 2010 projected GDP 
based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis projections.

5.7 Benefits Results 
5.7.1 Benefits of Attaining Alternative Combinations of Primary PM2.5 Standards 
Applying the impact and valuation functions described previously in this chapter to the 
estimated changes in PM2.5 yields estimates of the changes in physical damages (e.g., 
premature mortalities, cases of acute bronchitis and hospital admissions) and the associated 
monetary values for those changes. Not all known PM health effects could be quantified or 
monetized. The monetized value of these unquantified effects is represented by adding an 
unknown “B” to the aggregate total. The estimate of total monetized health benefits is thus 
equal to the subset of monetized PM-related health benefits plus B, the sum of the non-
monetized health and welfare benefits; this B represents both uncertainty and a bias in this 
analysis, as it reflects those benefits categories that we are unable quantify in this analysis. 
Table 5-16 shows the population-weighted air quality change for the alternative 
standards averaged across the continental U.S. Tables 5-17 through 5-24 present the benefits 
results for the alternative combinations of primary PM2.5 standards. In analyzing the current 
15/35 standard (baseline), EPA determined that all counties would meet the 14/35 standard 
concurrently with meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no additional cost. Consequently, 
there are no incremental costs or benefits for 14/35, and no need to present an analysis of 
14/35. Figure 5-3 graphically displays the total monetized benefits of the proposed range of 
primary standard combinations (12/35 and 13/35) using alternative concentration-response 
functions at discount rates of 3% and 7%. Figure 5-4 graphically displays the cumulative 
distribution of total monetized benefits using the 2 epidemiology-derived and the 12 expert-
derived relationships between PM2.5 and mortality for 12/35 and 13/35.

5.7.2 Uncertainty in Benefits Results 
Health benefits account for between 97 and 99% of total benefits depending on the 
PM2.5 mortality estimates used, in part because we are unable to quantify most of the non-
health benefits. The next largest benefit is for reductions in chronic illness (nonfatal heart 
attacks), although this value is more than an order of magnitude lower than for premature 
mortality. Hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular causes, MRADs and work loss 
days account for the majority of the remaining benefits. The remaining categories each account 
for a small percentage of total benefit; however, they represent a large number of avoided 
incidences affecting many individuals. A comparison of the incidence table to the monetary 
benefits table reveals that there is not always a close correspondence between the number of 
incidences avoided for a given endpoint and the monetary value associated with that endpoint. 
For example, we estimate almost 100 times more work loss days would be avoided than 
premature mortalities, yet work loss days account for only a very small fraction of total 
monetized benefits. This reflects the fact that many of the less severe health effects, while 
more common, are valued at a lower level than the more severe health effects. Also, some 
effects, such as hospital admissions, are valued using a proxy measure of WTP. As such, the true 
value of these effects may be higher than that reported in the tables above. 
PM2.5 mortality benefits represent a substantial proportion of total monetized benefits 
(over 98% in this analysis), and these estimates have the following key assumptions and 
uncertainties. 
 Implementation of this new air quality standard is expected to reduce emissions of 
directly emitted PM2.5, SO2, and NOx. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of 
their chemical composition, are equally potent in causing premature mortality. This 
is an important assumption, because PM2.5 produced varies considerably in 
  
5-64 
composition across sources, but the scientific evidence is not yet sufficient to allow 
differential effects estimates by particle type. 
 We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is linear within the 
range of ambient concentrations under consideration. Thus, the estimates include 
health benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of 
PM2.5, including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and 
those that do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled concentrations. 
Given that reductions in premature mortality dominate the size of the overall monetized 
benefits, more focus on uncertainty in mortality-related benefits gives us greater confidence in 
our uncertainty characterization surrounding total benefits.

5.7.3 Estimated Life Years Gained Attributable to Reduced PM2.5 Exposure and Percent of 
Total Mortality 
In their 2008 review of EPA’s approach to estimating ozone-related mortality benefits, 
NRC indicated, “EPA should consider placing greater emphasis on reporting decreases in age-
specific death rates in the relevant population and develop models for consistent calculation of 
changes in life expectancy and changes in number of deaths at all ages” (NRC, 2008). In 
addition, NRC previously noted in an earlier report that “[f]rom a public-health perspective, life-
years lost might be more relevant than annual number of mortality cases” (NRC, 2002). This 
advice is consistent with that of the HES, which agreed that “…the interpretation of mortality 
risk results is enhanced if estimates of lost life-years can be made” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a). To 
address these recommendations, we estimate the number of life years gained and the 
reduction in the percentage of all deaths attributable to PM2.5 resulting from attainment of the 
alternative combinations of primary PM2.5 standards. EPA included similar estimates of life 
years gained in a previous assessment of PM2.5 benefits (U.S. EPA, 2006a, 2011a), the latter of 
which was peer reviewed by the HES (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010a). 
Because changes in life years and changes in life expectancy at birth are frequently 
conflated, it is important to distinguish these two very different metrics. Life expectancy varies 
by age. CDC defines life expectancy as the “average number of years of life remaining for 
persons who have attained a given age” (CDC, 2011). In other words, changes in life expectancy 
refer to an average change for the entire population, and refer to the future. Over the past 50 
years, average life expectancy at birth in the U.S. has increased by 8.4 years (CDC, 2001). Life 
years, on the other hand, measure the amount of time that an individual loses if they die before 
the age of their life expectancy. Life years refer to individuals, and refer to the past, e.g., when 
the individual has already died. For example, life expectancy at birth was estimated in 2007 to 
be 77.9 years for an average person born in the U.S., but for people surviving to age 60, 
estimated life expectancy is 82.5 years (i.e., 4.6 years more than life expectancy at birth) (CDC, 
2011). If a 60-year old individual dies, we estimate about that this individual would lose about 
22.5 years of life (i.e., the average population life expectancy for an individual of this age minus 
this person’s age at death). 
In this analysis, we use the same general approach as Hubbell (2006) and Fann et al. 
(2012a) for estimating potential life years gained by reducing exposure to PM2.5 in adult 
populations. We have not estimated the change in average life expectancy at birth in this RIA. 
Hubbell (2006) estimated that reducing exposure to PM2.5 from air pollution regulations result 
in an average gain of 15 years of life for those adults prematurely dying from PM2.5 exposure. In 
  
5-75 
contrast, Pope et al. (2009) estimated changes in average life expectancy at birth over a twenty 
year period, finding that reducing exposure to air pollution increased average life expectancy at 
birth by approximately 7 months, which was 15% of the overall increase in life expectancy at 
birth from 1980 through 2000. These results are not inconsistent because they are reporting 
different metrics. Because life expectancy is an average of the entire population (including 
those who will not die from PM exposure as well as those who will), average life expectancy 
changes associated with PM exposure will always be significantly smaller than the average 
number of life years lost by an individual who is projected to die prematurely from PM 
exposure. 
To calculate the potential distribution of life years gained for populations of different 
ages, we use standard life tables available from the CDC (2003) and the following formula: 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑒 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 =  ∑ 𝐿𝐸𝑖  ×  𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖=1  (5-2) 
where LEi is the remaining life expectancy for age interval i, Mi is the change in number of 
deaths in age interval i, and n is the number of age intervals. We binned the life year results by 
age range and calculated the average per life lost. 
When we estimate the number of avoided premature deaths attributed to changes in 
PM2.5 exposure in 2020, we apply risk coefficients estimated for all adult populations in 
conjunction with age-specific mortality rates. That is, we apply risk coefficients that do not vary 
by age, but use baseline mortality rates do. Because mortality rates for younger populations are 
much lower than mortality rates for older populations, most but not all, of the avoided deaths 
tend to be in older populations. By comparing the projected age distribution of the avoided 
premature deaths with the age distribution of life years gained, we observed that about half of 
the deaths occur in populations age 75-99, but half of the life years would occur in populations 
younger than 65. This is because the younger populations have the potential to lose more life 
years per death than older populations based on changes in PM2.5 exposure in 2020. On 
average, we estimate that the average individual who would otherwise have died prematurely 
from PM exposure would gain 16 additional years of life. 
When calculating changes in life years, we assume that the life expectancy at birth of 
those dying from PM2.5 exposure is the same as the general population. In reference to the 
most recent Six Cities extended analysis by Laden et al. (2006), Krewski et al. (2009) notes that 
“[w]hether PM2.5 exposure was modeled as the annual average in the year of death or as the 
average over the entire follow-up period, it had similar effects on mortality. The results from 
  
5-76 
the study suggest that since PM2.5 exposure may affect sensitive individuals with preexisting 
conditions and play a role in the development of chronic disease, as exposure declines so may 
the excess mortality related to it.” For this reason, we believe that this is a reasonable 
assumption. 
In addition, this analysis includes an estimate of the percentage of all-cause mortality 
attributed to reduced PM2.5 exposure in 2020 as a result of the illustrative control strategies. 
The percentage of premature PM2.5-related mortality is calculated by dividing the number of 
excess deaths estimated for each alternative standard by the total number of deaths in each 
county. We have also binned these results by age range. 
Tables 5-25 and 5-26 summarize the estimated number of life years gained and the 
reduction in the percentage of all-cause mortality attributable to reduced PM2.5 exposure in 
2020 by age range for 12/35. Figure 5-5 bins the potential life years gained and avoided 
premature deaths into age ranges for 12/35 for comparison. The number of life years gained 
and avoided mortalities would be similar across various combinations of standards on a relative 
basis. Because we assume that there is a “cessation” lag between PM exposures and the 
reduction in the risk of premature death, there is uncertainty regarding the specific ages that 
people die relative to the change in exposure. While the structure of the lag is uncertain, some 
studies suggest that most of the premature deaths are avoided within the first three years after 
the change in exposure, while others are unable to find a critical window of exposure (U.S. EPA, 
2004c; Schwartz, 2008; Krewski et al. 2009). These studies did not examine whether the 
cessation lag was modified by either age of exposure or cumulative lifetime exposure.

5.7.4 Analysis of Mortality Impacts at Various Concentration Benchmarks 
In this analysis, we estimate the number of avoided PM2.5-related deaths occurring 
down to various PM2.5 concentration benchmarks, including the Lowest Measured Level (LML) 
of each long-term PM2.5 mortality study. We include this sensitivity analysis because 
assessments quantifying PM2.5 related health impacts generally find that cases of avoided 
mortality represent the majority of the monetized benefits. This analysis is one of several 
sensitivities that EPA has historically performed that characterize the uncertainty associated 
with the PM-mortality relationship and the economic value of reducing the risk of premature 
death (Roman et al., 2008; U.S. EPA, 2006a, 2011a; Mansfield, 2009). 
Based on our review of the current body of scientific literature, EPA estimated PM-
related mortality without applying an assumed concentration threshold. The PM ISA (U.S. EPA, 
2009b), which was reviewed by EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009b), concluded that the scientific literature consistently finds that a 
no-threshold log-linear model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-
response relationship while also recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape of the 
  
5-80 
concentration-response function.8 Consistent with this finding, we incorporated a LML 
assessment, which is a method EPA has employed in several recent RIAs (U.S. EPA, 2010g, 
2011c, 2011d). In addition, we have incorporated an assessment using specific concentration 
benchmarks identified in EPA’s Policy Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2011b). 
This approach summarizes the distribution of avoided PM2.5-related mortality impacts 
according to the baseline (i.e., pre-rule) annual mean PM2.5 levels at which populations are 
exposed and the minimum observed air quality level of each long-term cohort study we use to 
quantify mortality impacts. In general, our confidence in the estimated number of premature 
deaths diminishes as we estimate these impacts in locations where PM2.5 levels are below this 
level. This interpretation is consistent with the Policy Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2011b) and advice 
from CASAC during their peer review (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010d). In general, we have greater 
confidence in risk estimates based on PM2.5 concentrations where the bulk of the data reside 
and somewhat less confidence where data density is lower. However, there are uncertainties 
inherent in identifying any particular point at which our confidence in reported associations 
becomes appreciably less. 
As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, the Policy Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2011b) 
concludes that the range from the 25th to 10th percentiles of the air quality data used in the 
epidemiology studies is a reasonable range below which we have appreciably less confidence in 
the associations observed in the epidemiological studies. 
Although these types of concentration benchmark analyses (e.g., 25th percentile, 10th 
percentile, and LML) provide some insight into the level of uncertainty in the estimated PM2.5 
mortality benefits, EPA does not view these concentration benchmarks as a concentration 
threshold. The central benefits estimates reported in this RIA reflect a full range of modeled air 
quality concentrations. In reviewing the Policy Assessment, CASAC confirmed that “[a]lthough 
there is increasing uncertainty at lower levels, there is no evidence of a threshold (i.e., a level 
below which there is no risk for adverse health effects)” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010d). In addition, in 
reviewing the Costs and Benefits of the Clean Air Act (U.S. EPA, 2011a), the HES noted that 
“[t]his [no-threshold] decision is supported by the data, which are quite consistent in showing 
effects down to the lowest measured levels. Analyses of cohorts using data from more recent 
years, during which time PM concentrations have fallen, continue to report strong associations 
with mortality” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010a). Therefore, the best estimate of benefits includes 
                                                     
8 For a summary of the scientific review statements regarding the lack of a threshold in the PM2.5-mortality 
relationship, see the Technical Support Document (TSD) entitled Summary of Expert Opinions on the Existence 
of a Threshold in the Concentration-Response Function for PM2.5-related Mortality (U.S. EPA, 2010f). 
  
5-81 
estimates below and above these concentration benchmarks but uncertainty is higher in health 
benefits estimated at lower concentrations, with the lowest confidence below the LML. 
Estimated health impacts reflecting air quality improvements below and above these 
concentration benchmarks are appropriately included in the total benefits estimate. In other 
words, our confidence in the estimated benefits above these concentration benchmarks should 
not imply an absence of confidence in the benefits estimated below these concentration 
benchmarks. 
We estimate that most of the avoided PM-related impacts we estimate in this analysis 
occur among populations exposed at or above the LML of the Laden et al. (2006) study, while a 
majority of the impacts occur at or above the LML of the Krewski et al. (2009) study. We show 
the estimated reduction in incidence of premature mortality above and below the LML of these 
studies in Tables 5-27 and 5-28, and we graphically display the distribution of PM2.5-related 
mortality impacts for 12/35 and 13/35 in Figures 5-6 and 5-7. When interpreting these LML 
graphs, it is important to understand that the plots illustrate the avoided PM2.5 deaths 
estimated to occur from PM2.5 reductions in the baseline air quality simulation in which we 
assume that 15/35 is already met. When simulating attainment with alternative standards, we 
do not adjust the PM2.5 concentration in every 12km grid cell to equal the alternative standard. 
Instead, we adjust the design value at the monitor to equal the alternative standard and 
simulate how that adjustment would be reflected in the surrounding grid cells. As such, there 
may be a small number of grid cells with concentrations greater than 15 µg/m3 in the baseline 
even though all monitors meet an annual standard at 15 µg/m3. Specifically, there is one grid 
cell in San Bernardino County with a baseline concentration of 16.4 µg/m3, which falls in the 16 
to 17 µg/m3 bin. This one grid cell is highly populated and has a relatively high percentage of 
the avoided premature mortalities because this area received the most air quality improvement 
from the control strategies to reach 12/35 and 13/35. In addition, several recent rules such as 
the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) will 
have substantially reduced PM2.5 levels by 2020 in the East, thus few additional controls would 
be needed to reach 12/35 or 13/35 in the East. 
It is important to note that these estimated benefits reflect specific control measures 
and emission reductions that are needed to lower PM2.5 concentrations for monitors projected 
to exceed the alternative standard analyzed. The result is that air quality will improve in 
counties that exceed the alternative standards as well as surrounding areas that do not exceed 
the alternative standards. It is not possible to apply controls that only reduce PM2.5 at the 
monitor without affecting surrounding areas. In order to make a direct comparison between 
  
5-82 
the benefits and costs of these control strategies, it is appropriate to include all the benefits 
occurring as a result of the control strategies applied. 
We estimate benefits using modeled air quality data with 12km grid cells, which is 
important because the grid cells are smaller than counties and PM2.5 concentrations vary 
spatially within a county. Some grid cells in a county can be below the level of the alternative 
standard even though the highest monitor value is above the alternative standard. Thus, 
emission reductions lead to benefits in grid cells that are below the alternative standards even 
within a county with a monitor that exceeds the alternative standard. We have not estimated 
the fraction of benefits that occur only in counties that exceed the alternative standards.

health effects from exposure to PM2.5 do not occur.

While the LML of each study is important to consider when characterizing and 
interpreting the overall level PM2.5-related co-benefits, as discussed earlier in this chapter, EPA 
believes that both cohort-based mortality estimates are suitable for use in air pollution health 
impact analyses. When estimating PM-related premature deaths avoided using risk coefficients 
drawn from the Laden et al. (2006) analysis of the Harvard Six Cities and the Krewski et al. 
(2009) analysis of the ACS cohorts there are innumerable other attributes that may affect the 
size of the reported effect estimates—including differences in population demographics, the 
size of the cohort, activity patterns and particle composition among others. The LML 
assessment presented here provides a limited representation of one key difference between 
the two studies.

5.7.5 Additional Sensitivity Analyses 
The details of these sensitivity analyses are provided in appendix 5B, and summarized 
here. The use of an alternate lag structure would change the PM2.5-related mortality benefits 
discounted at 3% discounted by between 10% and –27%; when discounted at 7%, these 
benefits change by between 22% and −52%. When applying higher and lower income growth 
adjustments, the monetary value of PM2.5-related premature mortality changes between 33% 
and −14%; the value of acute endpoints changes between 8% and −4%. Using the updated cost-
of-illness functions for hospital admissions, the rounded estimates of total monetized benefits 
do not change, but the monetary value of respiratory hospital admissions increases 3.4% and 
cardiovascular hospital admissions increase 2.1%. These results on a percentage basis would be 
similar for alternative combinations of standards.

5.8 Discussion 
This analysis demonstrates the potential for significant health benefits of the illustrative 
emission controls applied to simulate attainment with the alternative combination of primary 
PM2.5 standards. We estimate that by 2020 the proposed standards would have reduced the 
number of PM2.5-related premature mortalities and produce substantial non-mortality benefits. 
This rule promises to yield significant welfare impacts as well, though the quantification of 
those endpoints in this RIA is incomplete. Even considering the quantified and unquantified 
uncertainties identified in this chapter, we believe that the implementing the proposed 
standard would have substantial public health benefits that outweigh the costs. 
Inherent in any complex RIA such as this one are multiple sources of uncertainty. Some 
of these we characterized through our quantification of statistical error in the concentration 
response relationships and our use of the expert elicitation-derived PM2.5 mortality functions. 
Others, including the projection of atmospheric conditions and source-level emissions, the 
projection of baseline morbidity rates, incomes and technological development are 
unquantified. When evaluated within the context of these uncertainties, the health impact and 
monetized benefits estimates in this RIA can provide useful information regarding the public 
health benefits associated with a revised PM NAAQS. 
There are important differences worth noting in the design and analytical objectives of 
NAAQS RIAs compared to RIAs for implementation rules, such as the recent MATS rule (U.S. 
EPA, 2011d). The NAAQS RIAs illustrate the potential costs and benefits of attaining a revised 
air quality standard nationwide based on an array of emission control strategies for different 
sources, incremental to implementation of existing regulations and controls needed to attain 
current standards. In short, NAAQS RIAs hypothesize, but do not predict, the control strategies 
that States may choose to enact when implementing a revised NAAQS. The setting of a NAAQS 
does not directly result in costs or benefits, and as such, NAAQS RIAs are merely illustrative and 
are not intended to be added to the costs and benefits of other regulations that result in 
specific costs of control and emission reductions. By contrast, the emission reductions from 
implementation rules are generally for specific, well-characterized sources, such as the recent 
MATS rule (U.S. EPA, 2011d). In general, EPA is more confident in the magnitude and location of 
the emission reductions for implementation rules. As such, emission reductions achieved under 
promulgated implementation rules such as MATS have been reflected in the baseline of this 
NAAQS analysis. Subsequent implementation rules will be reflected in the baseline for the next 
PM NAAQS review. For this reason, the benefits estimated provided in this RIA and all other 
NAAQS RIAs should not be added to the benefits estimated for implementation rules. 
  
5-87 
In setting the NAAQS, EPA considers that PM2.5 concentrations vary over space and time. 
While the standard is designed to limit concentrations at the highest monitor in an area, it is 
understood that emission controls put in place to meet the standard at the highest monitor will 
simultaneously result in lower PM2.5 concentrations throughout the entire area. In fact, the 
Quantitative Risk and Exposure Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2010b) shows how 
different standard levels would affect the entire distribution of PM2.5 concentrations, and thus 
people’s exposures and risk, across urban areas. For this reason, it is inappropriate to use the 
NAAQS level as a bright line for health effects. 
The NAAQS are not set at levels that eliminate the risk of air pollution completely. 
Instead, the Administrator sets the NAAQS at a level requisite to protect public health with an 
adequate margin of safety, taking into consideration effects on susceptible populations based 
on the scientific literature. The risk analysis prepared in support of this PM NAAQS reported 
risks below these levels, while acknowledging that the confidence in those effect estimates is 
higher at levels closer to the standard (U.S. EPA, 2010b). While benefits occurring below the 
standard may be somewhat more uncertain than those occurring above the standard, EPA 
considers these to be legitimate components of the total benefits estimate. Though there are 
greater uncertainties at lower PM2.5 concentrations, there is no evidence of a threshold in 
PM2.5-related health effects in the epidemiology literature. Given that the epidemiological 
literature in most cases has not provided estimates based on threshold models, there would be 
additional uncertainties imposed by assuming thresholds or other non-linear concentration-
response functions for the purposes of benefits analysis.

APPENDIX 5.A 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PM2.5-RELATED BENEFITS 
5.A.1 Overview 
EPA is developing new approaches and metrics to improve its characterization of the 
impacts of EPA rules on different populations. This analysis reflects one such approach, which 
attempts to answer two questions regarding the distribution of PM2.5-related benefits resulting 
from the illustrative attainment of a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM): 
1. What is the baseline distribution of PM2.5-related mortality risk according to the 
race, income and education of the population living within areas projected to exceed 
alternative combinations of primary PM2.5 standards? 
2. How would air quality improvements within these counties change the distribution 
of risk among populations of different races—particularly those populations at 
greatest risk in the baseline?1 
There are important methodological differences between this distributional analysis and 
the Environmental Justice analyses accompanying the Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) for the 
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard that are worth noting 
here. These latter two RIAs applied photochemical modeling to characterize the change in 
population exposure to PM2.5 after the implementation of well-characterized emission controls 
on Electricity Generating Units. By contrast, this RIA aims to illustrate the potential benefits and 
costs of attaining alternative primary PM2.5 standards. For this reason, similar to the main 
benefits analysis in this RIA, we performed monitor rollbacks to just attain the alternative 
combinations of primary standards following the approach described in Chapter 2 of this RIA. 
A limitation of this approach to characterizing improvements in PM2.5 air quality is that 
populations in each projected nonattainment area share the exposure reductions equally; this 
is because simple rollbacks do not reflect the spatial heterogeneity in PM2.5 changes one would 
expect from a modeled attainment strategy. However, as EPA demonstrated in the Detroit 
multi-pollutant pilot project, states can design attainment strategies to maximize air quality 
improvements among those populations at greatest risk of air pollution health impacts—which 
both maximizes overall benefits while lowering the level of risk inequality (Fann et al., 2012a). 
                                                     
1 In this analysis we assess the change in risk among populations of different race and educational attainment. As 
we discuss further in the methodology, we consider this last variable because of the availability of education-
modified PM2.5 mortality risk estimates. 
  
5.A-2 
In this analysis we estimated that in 2020, prior to the attainment of a more stringent 
PM standard, the level of PM2.5 mortality risk is not distributed equally among populations of 
different levels of educational attainment—though the level of mortality risk appears to be 
shared fairly equally among populations of different races. We find that attaining a more 
stringent alternative annual PM NAAQS level of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with a 24-hour 
standard of 35 µg/m3 (as an illustrative example) would provide air quality improvements, and 
lower PM2.5-related mortality risk, by a fairly consistent margin among minority populations. 
We note that while the methods used for this analysis have been employed in recent EPA 
Regulatory Impact Assessments (U.S. EPA, 2011) and are drawn from techniques described in 
the peer reviewed literature (Fann et al., 2012b) EPA will continue to modify these approaches 
based on evaluation of the methods. 
5.A.2 Methodology 
As a first step, we identify the counties exceeding an annual standard of 12 µg/m3 in 
conjunction with a 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3 in 2020, using the results of the baseline 
CMAQ air quality modeling. This air quality modeling simulation projects PM2.5 levels after the 
incorporation of all “on the books” rules (i.e., those promulgated at the time the air quality 
modeling was performed), but does not reflect the illustrative attainment strategies. We next 
identified the counties whose PM2.5 levels exceed the alternative combinations of PM2.5 
standards. We then performed a monitor rollback to adjust the annual PM2.5 levels in each 
county such that they attain the alternative combinations of PM2.5 standards. This approach 
provides us with baseline and rolled-back PM2.5 levels that attain this combination of annual 
and daily PM2.5 standards. Within each county exceeding the this combination of PM2.5 
standards, we estimate the level of all-cause PM2.5 mortality risks for adult populations as well 
as the level of PM2.5 mortality risk according to the race and educational attainment of the 
population. 
Our approach to calculating PM2.5 mortality risk is generally consistent with the primary 
analysis with two exceptions: the PM mortality risk coefficients used to quantify impacts and 
the baseline mortality rates used to calculate education-modified mortality impacts (a detailed 
discussion of how both the mortality risk coefficients and baseline incidence rates are used to 
estimate the incidence of PM2.5-related deaths may be found in the benefits chapter). Within 
both this and other analyses of the ACS cohort (see: Krewski et al., 2000), educational 
attainment has been found to be inversely related to the risk of all-cause mortality. That is, 
populations with lower levels of education (in particular, < grade 12) are more vulnerable to 
PM2.5-related mortality. Krewski and colleagues note that “…the level of education attainment 
  
5.A-3 
may likely indicate the effects of complex and multi-factorial socioeconomic processes on 
mortality…,” factors that we would like to account for in this distributional assessment. When 
estimating PM mortality impacts among populations according to level of education, we 
applied PM2.5 mortality risk coefficients modified by educational attainment: less than grade 12 
(Relative Risk (RR) = 1.082, 95% confidence intervals 1.024—1.144 per 10 µg/m3 change), grade 
12 (RR = 1.072, 95% confidence intervals 1.020—1.127 per 10 µg/m3 change), and greater than 
grade 12 (RR = 1.055, 95% confidence intervals 1.018—1.094 per 10 µg/m3 change). The Pope 
et al. (2002) study, which EPA has frequently relied upon to quantify PM-related mortality, does 
not provide education-stratified RR estimates. The principal reason we applied risk estimates 
from the Krewski study was to ensure that the risk coefficients used to estimate all-cause 
mortality risk and education-modified mortality risk were drawn from a consistent modeling 
framework and because the use of the Krewski study is consistent with the primary benefits 
analysis. 
The other key difference between this distributional analysis and the main benefits 
analysis for this rule relates to the baseline mortality rates. As described in Chapter 5 of this 
RIA, we calculate PM2.5-related mortality risk relative to baseline mortality rates in each county. 
Traditionally, for benefits analysis, we have applied county-level age- and sex-stratified baseline 
mortality rates when calculating mortality impacts (Abt Associates, 2010). To calculate PM2.5 
impacts by race, we incorporated race-specific (stratified by White/Black/Asian/Native 
American) baseline mortality rates. This approach improves our ability to characterize the 
relationship between race and PM2.5-related mortality however, we do not have a differential 
concentration-response function as we do for education, and as a result, we are not able to 
capture the full impacts of race in modifying the benefits associated with reductions in PM2.5. 
Table 5.A-1 summarizes the key attributes of the two distributional assessments.

5.A-4 
The result of this analysis is a distribution of PM2.5 mortality risk estimates by county, 
stratified by each of the two population variables (race and educational attainment). We have 
less confidence in county-level estimates of mortality than the national or even state estimates. 
However, the modeling down to the county level can be considered reasonable because the 
estimates are based on monitored air quality modeling estimates of PM2.5, county level baseline 
mortality rates, and a concentration-response function that is derived from county level data. 
We next identified the counties projected to exceed the current combination of annual and 
daily PM2.5 standards (15/35) (“baseline”) in 2020. The second step of the analysis was to repeat 
the sequence above by estimating PM2.5 mortality risk in counties projected to exceed an 
illustrative combination of PM2.5 standards (12/35) after rolling back monitor values to reach 
attainment in 2020. 
5.A.3 Results 
Figures 5.A-1 and 5.A-2 summarize the change in the median level of PM2.5 mortality risk 
among populations stratified by educational attainment and race in non-attaining counties. The 
percentage of deaths due to PM2.5 among populations with less than a grade 12 education is 
significantly higher than those who have either completed high school or who have attained an 
education level greater than high school. This finding is consistent with the relative levels of risk 
coefficients for each population, where we apply a much larger risk coefficient for populations 
with less than a grade 12 education. The level of risk reduction between the baseline and 12/35 
is roughly equal between the three groups. 
In Figure 5.A-2, Black and Native American populations are at significantly greater PM2.5 
mortality risk in the baseline, as compared to other races. White and Asian populations are at 
lower levels of PM2.5 mortality risk. The finding that black populations are at greater PM2.5 
mortality risk in the baseline may be due both to the elevated baseline mortality risks or greater 
exposure to PM2.5 among this population. After attaining 12/35, populations of all races benefit, 
though the reduction in PM mortality risk among whites is within rounding error.

5.A.4 Discussion 
This analysis is subject to certain limitations, some of which we note above but are 
worth repeating here. First, the change in the distribution of PM2.5-related mortality risk we 
estimate here depends is influenced strongly by the simulated attainment strategy. While we 
performed simple monitor rollbacks to attain a more stringent standard, we describe other 
approaches above that may maximize human health benefits while also reducing the level of 
risk inequality. The monitor rollback approach employed here simulates improvements in PM2.5 
levels in proximity to monitors projected to exceed a tighter PM NAAQS; we would expect an 
attainment strategy to achieve air quality improvements over a broader geographic area, 
affecting a greater portion the population than we have reflected here. 
Notwithstanding these uncertainties, these results suggest that all populations, 
irrespective of education attainment or race, living in locations projected to exceed an 
illustrative annual standard of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with a 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3 in 
2020 would experience a reduction in PM-related mortality risk. Certain sub-populations, 
including those with less than a grade 12 education and Native Americans, area at an elevated 
risk in the baseline. Attainment of this illustrative standard in 2020 would reduce the level of 
mortality risk among these sub-populations.

APPENDIX 5.B 
ADDITIONAL SENSITIVITY ANALYSES RELATED TO THE HEALTH BENEFITS ANALYSIS 
The analysis presented in Chapter 5 of this RIA is based on our current interpretation of 
the scientific and economic literature. That interpretation requires judgments regarding the 
best available data, models, and modeling methodologies and the assumptions that are most 
appropriate to adopt in the face of important uncertainties. The majority of the analytical 
assumptions used to develop the main estimates of benefits have been reviewed and approved 
by EPA’s independent Science Advisory Board (SAB). Both EPA and the SAB recognize that data 
and modeling limitations as well as simplifying assumptions can introduce significant 
uncertainty into the benefit results and that alternative choices exist for some inputs to the 
analysis, such as the concentration-response functions for mortality. 
This appendix supplements our main analysis of benefits with five additional sensitivity 
calculations. The supplemental estimates examine sensitivity to both for physical effects issues 
(i.e., the structure of the cessation lag; estimates of the number of avoided cerebrovascular 
events, cardiovascular emergency department visits and cases of chronic bronchitis; and 
alternate effect estimates for cohorts in California) and valuation issues (i.e., the appropriate 
income elasticity, updated cost-of-illness estimates). We conducted these sensitivity analyses 
for an annual standard of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with a 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3 as an 
illustrative example. These supplemental estimates are not meant to be comprehensive. 
Rather, they reflect some of the key issues identified by EPA or commenters as likely to have a 
significant impact on total benefits, or they are health endpoints for which the health data are 
still evolving, or for which we lack an appropriate method to estimate the economic value. The 
individual income growth and lag adjustments in the tables should not simply be added 
together because 1) there may be overlap among the alternative assumptions, and 2) the joint 
probability among certain sets of alternative assumptions may be low. 
5.B.1 Cessation Lag Structure for PM2.5-Related Premature Mortality 
Based in part on prior advice from the EPA’s independent Science Advisory Board (SAB), 
EPA typically assumes that there is a time lag between reductions in particulate matter (PM) 
exposures in a population and the full realization of reductions in premature mortality. Within 
the context of benefits analyses, this term is often referred to as “cessation lag.” The existence 
of such a lag is important for the valuation of reductions in premature mortality because 
economic theory suggests that dollar-based representations of health effect incidence changes 
occurring in the future should be discounted. 
  
5.B-2 
Over the last 15 years, there has been a continuing discussion and evolving advice 
regarding the timing of changes in health effects following changes in ambient air pollution. It 
has been hypothesized that some reductions in premature mortality from exposure to ambient 
PM2.5 will occur over short periods of time in individuals with compromised health status, but 
other effects are likely to occur among individuals who, at baseline, have reasonably good 
health that will deteriorate because of continued exposure. No animal models have yet been 
developed to quantify these cumulative effects, nor are there epidemiologic studies bearing on 
this question. The SAB-HES has recognized this lack of direct evidence. However, in early advice, 
they also note that “although there is substantial evidence that a portion of the mortality effect 
of PM is manifest within a short period of time, i.e., less than one year, it can be argued that, if 
no lag assumption is made, the entire mortality excess observed in the cohort studies will be 
analyzed as immediate effects, and this will result in an overestimate of the health benefits of 
improved air quality. Thus some time lag is appropriate for distributing the cumulative mortality 
effect of PM in the population” (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-00-001, 1999, p. 9). In more recent 
advice, the SAB-HES suggests that appropriate lag structures may be developed based on the 
distribution of cause-specific deaths within the overall all-cause estimate (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-
ADV-04-002, 2004). They suggest that diseases with longer progressions should be 
characterized by longer-term lag structures, while air pollution impacts occurring in populations 
with existing disease may be characterized by shorter-term lags. 
A key question is the distribution of causes of death within the relatively broad 
categories analyzed in the long-term cohort studies. Although it may be reasonable to assume 
the cessation lag for lung cancer deaths mirrors the long latency of the disease, it is not at all 
clear what the appropriate lag structure should be for cardiopulmonary deaths, which include 
both respiratory and cardiovascular causes. Some respiratory diseases may have a long period 
of progression, while others, such as pneumonia, have a very short duration. In the case of 
cardiovascular disease, there is an important question of whether air pollution is causing the 
disease, which would imply a relatively long cessation lag, or whether air pollution is causing 
premature death in individuals with preexisting heart disease, which would imply very short 
cessation lags. The SAB-HES provides several recommendations for future research that could 
support the development of defensible lag structures, including using disease-specific lag 
models and constructing a segmented lag distribution to combine differential lags across causes 
of death (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-04-002, 2004). The SAB-HES indicated support for using “a 
Weibull distribution or a simpler distributional form made up of several segments to cover the 
response mechanisms outlined above, given our lack of knowledge on the specific form of the 
distributions” (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-04-002, 2004, p. 24). However, they noted that “an 
  
5.B-3 
important question to be resolved is what the relative magnitudes of these segments should 
be, and how many of the acute effects are assumed to be included in the cohort effect 
estimate” (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-04-002, 2004, p. 24-25). Since the publication of that report 
in March 2004, EPA has sought additional clarification from this committee. In its follow-up 
advice provided in December 2004, this SAB suggested that until additional research has been 
completed, EPA should assume a segmented lag structure characterized by 30% of mortality 
reductions occurring in the first year, 50% occurring evenly over years 2 to 5 after the reduction 
in PM2.5, and 20% occurring evenly over the years 6 to 20 after the reduction in PM2.5 (EPA-
COUNCIL-LTR-05-001, 2004). The distribution of deaths over the latency period is intended to 
reflect the contribution of short-term exposures in the first year, cardiopulmonary deaths in the 
2- to 5-year period, and long-term lung disease and lung cancer in the 6- to 20-year period. 
Furthermore, in their advisory letter, the SAB-HES recommended that EPA include sensitivity 
analyses on other possible lag structures. In this appendix, we investigate the sensitivity of 
premature mortality-reduction related benefits to alternative cessation lag structures, noting 
that ongoing and future research may result in changes to the lag structure used for the main 
analysis. 
In previous advice from the SAB-HES, they recommended an analysis of 0-, 8-, and 15-
year lags, as well as variations on the proportions of mortality allocated to each segment in the 
segmented lag structure (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-00-001, 1999, (EPA-COUNCIL-LTR-05-001, 
2004). The 0-year lag is representative of EPA’s assumption in previous RIAs. The 8- and 15-year 
lags are based on the study periods from the Pope et al. (1995) and Dockery et al. (1993) 
studies, respectively.1 However, neither the Pope et al. nor Dockery et al. studies assumed any 
lag structure when estimating the relative risks from PM exposure. In fact, the Pope et al. and 
Dockery et al. analyses do not supporting or refute the existence of a lag. Therefore, any lag 
structure applied to the avoided incidences estimated from either of these studies will be an 
assumed structure. The 8- and 15-year lags implicitly assume that all premature mortalities 
occur at the end of the study periods (i.e., at 8 and 15 years). 
In addition to the simple 8- and 15-year lags, we have added several additional 
sensitivity analyses examining the impact of assuming different allocations of mortality to the 
segmented lag of the type suggested by the SAB-HES. The first alternate lag structure assumes 
that more of the mortality impact is associated with chronic lung diseases or lung cancer and 
                                                     
1 Although these studies were conducted for 8 and 15 years, respectively, the choice of the duration of the study 
by the authors was not likely due to observations of a lag in effects but is more likely due to the expense of 
conducting long-term exposure studies or the amount of satisfactory data that could be collected during this 
time period. 
  
5.B-4 
less with acute cardiopulmonary causes. This illustrative lag structure (“alternate segmented”) 
is characterized by 20% of mortality reductions occurring in the first year, 50% occurring evenly 
over years 2 to 5 after the reduction in PM2.5, and 30% occurring evenly over the years 6 to 20 
after the reduction in PM2.5. The second alternate lag structure (“5-year distributed”) assumes 
the 5-year distributed lag structure used in previous analyses, which is equivalent to a three-
segment lag structure with 50% in the first 2-year segment, 50% in the second 3-year segment, 
and 0% in the 6- to 20-year segment. The third alternate lag structure assumes a smooth 
negative exponential relationship between the reduction in exposure and the reduction in 
mortality risk, which is described in more detail below. 
In 2004, SAB-HES (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004) urged EPA to consider using smoothed lag 
distributions, incorporating information from the smoking cessation literature. In June 2010, 
the SAB-HES provided additional advice regarding alternate cessation lags (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010). 
For PM2.5-related benefits, the SAB-HES continued to support the previous 20-year distributed 
lag as the main estimate. while recommending that EPA further examine additional exponential 
decay functions. Specifically, the SAB-HES suggested varying the rate constant with the risk 
coefficient from in the cohort studies. EPA intends to incorporate these new alternate cessation 
lag for PM2.5-related benefits in the final PM NAAQS RIA. 
In response to these suggestions, EPA identified Röösli et al. (2005) as model that 
combines empirical data on the relationship between changes in exposure and changes in 
mortality and the timing of the cessation of those effects for the smooth decay function.2 
Because an exponential model is often observed in biological systems, Röösli et al. (2005) 
developed a dynamic model that assumes that mortality risks decrease exponentially after 
exposure termination. This model assumes the form risk=exp-kt, where k is the time constant 
and t is the time after t0. The relative risk from air pollution (RR) at a given time (t) can be 
calculated from the excess relative risk (ERR) attributable to air pollution from PM cohort 
studies (ERR=RR-R0), as follows: 
 𝑅𝑅(𝑡) = 𝐸𝑅𝑅 × 𝑒𝑥𝑝−𝑘𝑡 + 𝑅0 (5.B.1) 
where R0 is the baseline relative risk in the absence of air pollution (R0=1). After cessation of 
exposure, mortality will start to decline and approach the baseline level. The change in 
mortality (ΔM), in units of percent-years, can be derived from Equation (5.B.1) as follows: 
                                                     
2 In the 2006 PM NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006), EPA applied equations and the time constant from a conference 
presentation by Röösli et al. (2004). We have updated this sensitivity analysis in this assessment to reflect the 
published version in Röösli et al. (2005) and generated additional time constants.  
  
5.B-5 
 ∆𝑀 = 𝐸𝑅𝑅 × 𝑡 − ∫ 𝐸𝑅𝑅 × 𝑒𝑥𝑝−𝑘𝑡𝑑𝑡𝑡0  (5.B.2) 
 Integrating Equation (5.B.2) gives: 
 ∆𝑀 = 𝐸𝑅𝑅 × 𝑡 − 𝐸𝑅𝑅
𝑘
+ 𝐸𝑅𝑅
𝑘
× 𝑒𝑥𝑝−𝑘𝑡 (5.B.3) 
In order to calculate values for the time constant, k, we applied the ΔM values from the 
two intervention studies that provide data on the time course of the change in mortality along 
with the ERR values from cohort studies on PM2.5-related mortality. We applied the 
intervention studies by Clancy et al. (2002), which analyzed the change in mortality following 
the ban of coal sales in Dublin, and by Pope et al. (1992), which examined the change in 
mortality resulting from the closure of a steel mill in the Utah Valley. We applied effect 
estimates from the American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort by Krewski et al. (2002)3 and the Six 
Cities cohort by Laden et al. (2006). Applying combinations of these studies to equation 5.B.3 
generates four estimates of k that range from 0.05 to 1.24. For additional context, the time 
constant calculated using on a smoking cessation study (i.e., Leksell and Rabl (2001)) is in the 
middle of this range (k=0.10). For this sensitivity analysis, we applied a time constant of k=0.45 
as a reasonable parameter for the exponential decay function, but we acknowledge the range 
of estimates that we could have chosen. This k constant is calculated as the average of the 
average k constants corresponding to each cohort study.4 Table 5.B. 1 provides the time 
constants for each of these combinations and averages, and Figure 5.B.2 illustrates the 
exponential decay lag structures. 
  
                                                     
3 The relative risk estimate from Krewski et al. (2009) (1.06 per 10 µg/m3 change in average PM2.5 exposure for all-
cause mortality) is the same as the risk estimate from Pope et al. (2002). 
4 The general approach for calculating the time constants based on the combination of the intervention study and 
cohort study is consistent with the 812 analysis (U.S. EPA, 2011), which was reviewed by SAB. However, in this 
analysis we have applied a single time constant (k=0.45) rather than presenting the monetized benefits results 
for every exponential lag function applying the various time constants.

The estimated impacts of alternative lag structures on the monetary benefits associated 
with reductions in PM-related premature mortality (estimated using the effect estimate from 
Krewski et al. (2009)) are presented in Table 5.B-2. These monetized estimates are calculated 
using the value of a statistical life (i.e., $6.3 million per incidence adjusted for inflation and 
income growth) and are presented for both a 3 and 7% discount rate over the lag period). The 
choice of mortality risk study and mortality valuation approach are described in detail in 
Chapter 5 of this RIA. Figure 5.B.1 illustrates the cumulative distributions of the cessation lags 
applied in this appendix. 
The results of this sensitivity analyses demonstrate that because of discounting of 
delayed benefits, the lag structure may also have a large impact on monetized benefits, 
reducing benefits by 27% if an extreme assumption that no effects occur until after 15 years is 
applied at a 3% discount rate and 53% at a 7% discount rate. However, for most reasonable 
distributed lag structures, differences in the specific shape of the lag function have relatively 
small impacts on overall benefits. For example, the overall impact of moving from the previous 
5-year distributed lag to the segmented lag recommended by the SAB-HES in 2004 in the main 
estimate is relatively modest, reducing benefits by approximately 5% when a 3% discount rate 
is used and 9% when a 7% discount rate is used. If no lag is assumed, benefits are increased by 
approximately 10% relative to the segmented lag at a 3% discount rate and 22% at a 7% 
discount rate.

5.B.2 Income Elasticity of Willingness to Pay 
As discussed in Chapter 5, our estimates of monetized benefits account for growth in 
real GDP per capita by adjusting the WTP for individual endpoints based on the central estimate 
of the adjustment factor for each of the categories (minor health effects, severe and chronic 
health effects, premature mortality, and visibility). We examined how sensitive the estimate of 
total benefits is to alternative estimates of the income elasticities. Table 5.B-3 lists the ranges of 
elasticity values used to calculate the income adjustment factors, while Table 5.B-4 lists the 
ranges of corresponding adjustment factors. The results of this sensitivity analysis, giving the 
monetized benefit subtotals for the four benefit categories, are presented in Table 5.B-5.

Minor Health Effect 0.04 0.30

a Derivation of these ranges can be found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999). COI estimates are assigned an 
adjustment factor of 1.0.

or a 7% discount rate would show the same proportional range. 
  
5.B-10 
Consistent with the impact of mortality on total benefits, the adjustment factor for 
mortality has the largest impact on total benefits. The value of mortality in 2020 ranges from 
96% to 108% of the main estimate based on the lower and upper sensitivity bounds on the 
income adjustment factor. The effect on the value of minor health effects is much less 
pronounced, ranging from 86% to 133% of the main estimate for minor effects. 
5.B.3 Analysis of Cardiovascular Emergency Department Visits, Cerebrovascular Events and 
Chronic Bronchitis 
Below we summarize the results of a sensitivity analysis of three health endpoints: 
cardiovascular emergency department visits, cerebrovascular events (stroke) and chronic 
bronchitis (Table 5.B-6). While in the benefits chapter we provide a full description of the 
rationale for treating these endpoints as a sensitivity, it is worth summarizing these reasons 
here. In the case of cardiovascular emergency department visits, we lack the necessary 
economic valuation functions to quantify the monetary value of these avoided cases. We treat 
cerebrovascular events as a sensitivity for three reasons: (1) the epidemiological literature 
examining PM-related cerebrovascular events is still evolving; (2) there are special uncertainties 
associated with quantifying this endpoint; (3) we have not yet identified an appropriate means 
for estimating the economic value of this endpoint. Finally, we now quantify chronic bronchitis 
as a sensitivity because of the absence of newer studies finding a relationship between long-
term PM2.5 exposure and this endpoint. 
To quantify cardiovascular hospital admissions, we apply risk coefficient drawn from 
Metzger et al. (2004) (RR= 1.033, 95% confidence intervals 1.01–1.056 per 10 µg/m3 PM2.5) and 
Tolbert et al. (2007) (RR= 1.005, 95% confidence intervals 0.993–1.017 per 10 µg/m3 PM2.5). To 
estimate cerebrovascular events, we apply a risk coefficient drawn from Miller et al. (2007) 
(RR= 1.28, 95% confidence intervals 1.02–1.61 per 10 µg/m3 PM2.5). To estimate chronic 
bronchitis, we use a risk coefficient drawn from Abbey et al. (1995) (RR= 1.81, 95% confidence 
intervals 0.98–3.25 per 45 µg/m3 PM2.5). Additional information, including the rationale for 
incorporating these new endpoints into the analysis, the baseline incidence rates for these 
endpoints, and the prevalence rate for chronic bronchitis are described in Chapter 5 of this RIA.

5.B.4 New Hospitalization Cost-of-Illness Functions and Median Wage Data 
As described in Chapter 5 of this RIA, we updated the cost-of-illness functions for 
hospitalizations. Specifically, we updated the estimates of hospital charges and lengths of 
hospital stays were based on discharge statistics provided by the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality’s Healthcare Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 
for 2000 (AHRQ, 2000) to 2007 (AHRQ, 2007). In addition, we updated the county-level median 
wage data reported by the 2007 American Community Survey (ACS) (Abt Associates, 2011). 
Using cost-of-illness functions for hospital admissions, which include updated charges, length of 
stay, and median wages, the rounded estimates of total monetized benefits do not change, but 
the monetary value of respiratory hospital admissions increases 3% and cardiovascular hospital 
admissions increase 2%. Because the median wages were updated, the valuation also changed 
the valuation for work loss days. It is important to note that while the national average median 
daily wage slightly decreased (i.e., approximately 2% in 2000$), the county-level median income 
increased slightly in the locations where PM2.5 levels improved for 12/35. Tables 5.B.7 and 5.B.8 
show the previous and current unit values, respectively. Table 5.B.9 shows the sensitivity of the 
monetized hospitalization benefits to this update.

5.B.5 Long-term PM2.5 Mortality Estimates using Cohort Studies in California 
In Chapter 5, we described the multi-state cohort studies we used to estimate the PM2.5-
related mortality (i.e., Krewski et al., 2009; Laden et al., 2006), as well as summarized the effect 
estimates for additional cohort studies. In this appendix, we provide additional information 
  
5.B-13 
about cohort studies in California.1 As shown in Table 5.x in the health benefits chapter, a large 
percentage of the monetized human health benefits associated with the illustrative control 
strategy to attain the alternative combination of standards are projected to occur in California. 
Specifically, for an annual PM2.5 standard of 12 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 24-hour 
standard of 35 µg/m3, 70% of the total monetized benefits were estimated to occur in California 
and 98% for an annual PM2.5 standard of 13 µg/m3. For this reason, we determined that it was 
appropriate to consider the sensitivity of the benefits results using effect estimates for cohorts 
in California specifically. Although we have not calculated the benefits results using these 
cohort studies, it is possible to use the effect estimates themselves to determine how much the 
monetized benefits in California would have changed if we used effect estimates from the 
California cohorts. Each of the California cohort studies are summarized in the PM ISA (and thus 
not summarized here) with the exception of the Ostro et al. (2010, 2011) studies, which we 
describe below. Table 5.B.10 provides the effect estimates from each of these cohort studies 
for all-cause, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality for 
each of the California cohort studies. 
Ostro et al. (2010) characterize the risk of premature death associated with long-term 
exposure to PM2.5 in California among a cohort of about 134,000 current and former female 
public school professionals (i.e., the California Teacher’s Study (CTS)). In this prospective cohort 
study, Ostro and colleagues estimated long-term PM exposure to several PM constituents, 
including elemental carbon, organic carbon, sulfates, nitrates, iron, potassium, silicon and zinc. 
In an erratum, Ostro et al. (2011) modified their approach to assigning PM2.5 levels to the 
cohort populations, noting that they “reanalyzed the CTS data using time-dependent pollution 
metrics—in which the exposure estimates for everyone remaining alive in the risk set were 
recalculated at the time of each death—in order to compare their average exposures up to that 
time with that of the individual who had died. In this way, decedents and survivors comprising 
the risk set had similar periods of pollution exposure, without subsequent pollution trends 
influencing the surviving women’s exposure estimates.” This change in assumption attenuated 
the hazard ratios significantly, though hazard ratios remained significant for cardiovascular 
mortality and total PM2.5 mass and certain constituents, nitrate and sulfate; no association was 
observed between all-cause mortality and total PM2.5 mass or its constituents. The authors note 
that these revised results are generally consistent with other long-term PM cohort studies, 
including the ACS and H6C studies. 
                                                     
1 In addition to cohorts studies conducted in California, we have also identified a cross-sectional studies (Hankey 
et al., 2012). However, we have not summarized that study here.

As shown in Table 5.B.10, most of the cohort studies conducted in California report 
central effect estimates similar to the (nation-wide) all-cause mortality risk estimate we applied 
from Krewski et al. (2009) and Laden et al. (2006) albeit with wider confidence intervals. A 
couple cohort studies conducted in California indicate higher risks than the risk estimates we 
applied.

APPENDIX 5.C 
QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY 
Although we strive to incorporate as many quantitative assessments of uncertainty as 
possible, there are several aspects we are only able to address qualitatively. These aspects are 
important factors to consider when evaluating the relative benefits of the attainment strategies 
for each of the alternative standards:  
To more fully address all these uncertainties including those we cannot quantify, we 
apply a four-tiered approach using the WHO uncertainty framework (WHO, 2008), which 
provides a means for systematically linking the characterization of uncertainty to the 
sophistication of the underlying risk assessment. EPA has applied similar approaches in peer-
reviewed analyses of PM2.5-related impacts (U.S. EPA, 2010b, 2011a). In addition to the WHO 
uncertainty framework, we also include an assessment of how each aspect of uncertainty could 
affect the benefits results, including the direction of potential bias, the magnitude of impact on 
results, and the degree of confidence in our approach. In Table 5.C-1, we summarize the key 
uncertainties in the health benefits analysis, including our assessment of the direction of 
potential bias, magnitude of impact on the monetized benefits, degree of confidence in our 
analytical approach, and our ability to assess the source of uncertainty. Because this approach 
reflects a new application for regulatory benefits analysis, we request comments on this 
general approach as well as the specific uncertainty assessments. 
5.C.1 Description of Classifications Applied in the Uncertainty Characterization 
Uncertainty Characterization Tiers 
 The WHO framework (2008) defines 4 tiers of uncertainty characterization, which vary 
depending on the degree of quantification. In Table 5.C-1, we apply these tiers considering the 
degree of quantification of uncertainty we have conducted in this analysis or that we plan to 
conduct for the final RIA. Ultimately, the tier decision is professional judgment based on the 
availability of information. 
 Tier 0—Screening level, generic qualitative characterization 
 Tier 1—Scenario-specific qualitative characterization 
 Tier 2—Scenario-specific sensitivity analysis 
  
5.C-2 
 Tier 3—Scenario-specific probabilistic assessment of individual and combined 
uncertainty 
Magnitude of Impact 
 The magnitude of impact is an assessment of how much a plausible alternative 
assumption or approach could influence the overall monetary benefits. Similar classifications 
have been included in a previous analyses (U.S. EPA, 2010b, 2011a), but we have revised the 
category names and the cut-offs here.1 We note that PM2.5-related mortality benefits comprise 
over 98% of the monetized benefits in this analysis, thus alternative assumptions affecting 
mortality have the potential to have higher impacts on the total monetized benefits. Including 
currently omitted categories of benefits would lead to a reduction in the fraction of monetized 
benefits attributable to lower mortality risk. Ultimately, the magnitude decision is professional 
judgment based on the experience with various sensitivity analyses. 
 High—If this uncertainty could influence the total monetized benefits by more than 25% 
 Medium—If this uncertainty could influence the total monetized benefits by 5% to 25% 
 Low—If this uncertainty could influence the total monetized benefits by less than 5% 
Degree of Confidence in Our Analytic Approach 
 The degree of confidence is an assessment based on our assessment of the available 
body of evidence. That is, based on the given available evidence, how certain we are that the 
selected assumption is the most plausible of the alternatives. Similar classifications have been 
included in a previous analyses (U.S. EPA, 2010b, 2011a).2 Ultimately, the degree of confidence 
is professional judgment based on the volume and consistence of supporting evidence, much of 
                                                     
1 In The Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act from 1990 to 2020 (U.S. EPA, 2011a), EPA applied a classification of 
“potentially major” if a plausible alternative assumption or approach could influence the overall monetary 
benefit estimate by 5% percent or more and “probably minor.” if an alternative assumption or approach is likely 
to change the total benefit estimate by less than five percent. In the Quantitative Health Risk Assessment for 
Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2010b), EPA applied classifications of “low” if the impact would not be expected to 
impact the interpretation of risk estimates in the context of the PM NAAQS review, “medium” if the impact had 
the potential to change the interpretation; “high” if it was are likely to influence the interpretation of risk in the 
context of the PM NAAQS review. 
2 We have applied the same classification as The Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act from 1990 to 2020 (U.S. 
EPA, 2011a) in this analysis. In the Quantitative Health Risk Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2010b), 
EPA assessed the degree of uncertainty (low, medium, or high) associated with the knowledge-base (i.e., 
assessed how well we understand each source of uncertainty), but did not provide specific criteria for the 
classification.

which has been evaluated in the PM ISA. 
 High—The current evidence is plentiful and strongly supports the selected approach 
 Medium—Some evidence exists to support the selected approach, but data gaps are 
present 
 Low—Limited data exists to support the selected approach

demonstrate the potentially

of uncertainty can have on effect

The results from Krewski et al.

Epidemiology studies often 
create a composite air quality 
monitor that is assumed to be 
representative of an entire urban 
area to estimate health risks, 
while benefits are often 
calculated using air quality 
modeling conducted at 12 km 
spatial resolution. This spatial 
mismatch could introduce 
uncertainty.

Both Medium- High 
Epidemiology studies examining 
regional differences in PM2.5-
related health effects have found 
differences in the magnitude of 
those effects. While these may 
be the result of factors other 
than composition (e.g., different 
degrees of exposure 
misclassification), composition 
remains one potential 
explanatory factor.  
Medium Tier 1 
Differential toxicity of particle 
components 
Unknown 
We assume that all fine particles, 
regardless of their chemical 
composition, are equally potent 
in causing premature mortality. 
Depending on the toxicity of 
each PM species reduced, this 
could over or underestimate 
benefits. 
Medium 
If the benefits are due to a 
variety of PM species reduced, 
the magnitude of this 
uncertainty is likely to be small. If 
only one PM species is reduced, 
this uncertainty may have larger 
magnitude. 
Medium-Low 
The PM ISA (U.S. EPA, 2009b), 
which was twice peer reviewed 
by CASAC, evaluated the entire 
body of scientific literature and 
concluded that because there is 
no clear scientific evidence that 
would support the development 
of differential effects estimates 
by particle type (U.S. EPA, 
2009b).

The C-R functions for several 
health endpoints were applied 
only to subgroups of the U.S. 
population (e.g., adults 30+ for 
mortality, children 8-12 for acute 
bronchitis), and thus this may 
underestimate the whole 
population benefits of reductions 
in pollutant exposures.

PM-related health effects is

If there is a threshold (i.e., a level 
of exposure below which health 
effects do not occur), then the 
relative risk (i.e., steeper slope) 
estimates would be higher within 
the range of observed effects.  
Medium  
For PM2.5-related long-term 
mortality, the PM ISA concludes 
that a log-linear non-threshold 
model is best supported in the 
scientific literature (U.S. EPA, 
2009b). Although consideration 
for alternative model forms 
(Krewski et al., 2009) does 
suggest that different models 
can impact effect estimates to a 
certain extent, generally this 
appears to be a moderate source 
of overall uncertainty.

Impact of historical exposure on 
long-term effect estimates 
Both 
Long-term studies of mortality 
suggest that different time 
periods of PM exposure can 
produce significantly different 
effects estimates, raising the 
issue of uncertainty in relation to 
determining which exposure 
window is most strongly 
associated with mortality. 
Medium 
The Reanalysis II study (HEI, 
2009) which looked at exposure 
windows (1979-1983 and 1999-
2000) for long-term exposure in 
relation to mortality, did not 
draw any conclusions as to which 
window was more strongly 
associated with mortality. 
However, the study did suggest 
that moderately different effects 
estimates are associated with 
the different exposure periods 
(with the more recent period 
having larger estimates). Overall, 
the evidence for determining the 
window over which the mortality 
effects of long-term pollution 
exposures occur suggests a 
latency period of up to five years, 
with the strongest results 
observed in the first few years 
after intervention (PM ISA, 
section 7.6.4. p. 7-95).

For long-term health endpoints, 
the final ISA states, “Given 
similar sources for multiple 
pollutants (e.g., traffic), 
disentangling the health 
responses of co-pollutants is a 
challenge in the study of ambient 
air pollution.” The PM ISA also 
notes that in some instances, 
consideration of co-pollutants 
can have a significant impact on 
effect estimates.  
For morbidity, the PM ISA 
concludes that observed 
associations are fairly robust to 
the inclusion of co-pollutants in 
the predictive models (see PM 
ISA).

Cessation lag structure for long

Underestimate 
Recent studies (Schwartz, 2008) 
have shown that the majority of 
the risk occurs within 2 years of 
reduced exposure. EPA’s current 
lag structure assumption was 
provided by the SAB, and it 
estimates that 30% of mortality 
reductions in the first year, 50% 
over years 2 to 5, and 20% over 
the years 6 to 20 after the 
reduction in PM2.5 (U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2004c). 
Medium 
Although the cessation lag does 
not affect the number of 
premature deaths attributable to 
PM2.5 exposure, it affects the 
timing of those deaths and thus 
the discounted monetized 
benefits.

was recently confirmed by the

Uncertainties Associated with Valuation (continued) 
Morbidity valuation Underestimate 
Morbidity benefits such as 
hospital admissions and heart 
attacks are calculated using cost-
of-illness (COI) estimates, which 
studies have shown (Alberini and 
Krupnick, 2000) are generally half 
as much as willingness-to-pay to 
avoid the illness. in addition, the 
quantified morbidity impacts do 
not reflect physiological 
responses or sequelae events, 
such as increased susceptibility 
for future morbidity. 
Low 
Mortality valuation generally 
dominates monetized benefits.  
Low 
Although the COI estimates for 
hospitalizations reflect recent 
data, other COI estimates such as 
for AMI have not yet been 
updated. Nevertheless, even 
current COI valuation estimates 
do not capture the full valuation 
of these morbidity impacts. 
Tier 1 
Income growth adjustments Both 
Income growth increases 
willingness-to-pay valuation 
estimates, including mortality, 
over time. From 1997 to 2010, 
personal income and GDP growth 
have begun to diverge If this 
trend continues, the assumption 
that per capita GDP growth is a 
reasonable proxy for income 
growth may lead to an 
overstatement of benefits. (IEc, 
2012). 
Medium 
Income growth from 1990 to 
2020 increases mortality 
valuation by 20%. Alternate 
estimates for this adjustment 
vary by 20%(IEc, 2012). 
Medium 
Adjusting for income growth is 
consistent with SAB 
recommendations (U.S. EPA,-
SAB, 2000). Difficult to forecast 
future income growth. However, 
in the absence of readily 
available income data 
projections, per capita GDP is the 
best available option.

Uncertainty in projecting

Both  
Baseline mortality rates are at 
the county level and projected 
for 5-year increments for 
multiple age groups. Due to data 
suppression for small numbers of 
specific 
age/gender/race/ethnicity 
combinations, many counties 
have missing baseline mortality 
rates. 
Medium 
Mortality valuation generally 
dominates monetized benefits. 
The county-level baseline 
mortality rates reflect recent 
databases (i.e., 2004-2006). Also, 
the mortality rates projections for 
future years are internally 
consistent with population 
projections in that they reflect 
changes in mortality patterns as 
well as population growth. 
Medium-High 
The mortality rate databases 
(CDC, 2008) are generally 
considered to have relatively low 
uncertainty. These projections 
account for both spatial and 
temporal changes. 
 
Tier 1 
Uncertainty in projecting 
baseline incidence rates and 
prevalence rates or morbidity 
Both 
Morbidity baseline incidence is 
available for year 2000 only (i.e., 
no projections available).  
 
Low 
Mortality valuation generally 
dominates monetized benefits. 
The magnitude of uncertainty 
associated with projections of 
morbidity baseline incidence 
varies with the health endpoint. 
Some endpoints such as 
hospitalizations and ER visits have 
more recent data (i.e., 2007) 
stratified by age and geographic 
location. Other endpoints, such as 
respiratory symptoms reflect one 
national average. 
Low

CHAPTER 6 
WELFARE BENEFITS ANALYSIS APPROACH 
6.1 Important Caveats Regarding this Chapter 
Due to data limitations for this proposed rule, we were unable to calculate changes in 
light extinction associated with emission reductions from the illustrative control strategies, 
which are necessary for calculating the visibility benefits. Instead, this chapter and associated 
appendix describe in detail the methodology for calculating visibility benefits to encourage 
comment on the revised approach. 
6.2 Synopsis 
Emission reductions associated with the illustrative control strategies to attain 
alternative combinations of the PM NAAQS have numerous documented effects on 
environmental quality that affect human welfare, including changes in visibility, materials 
damage, ecological effects from PM deposition, ecological effects from nitrogen and sulfur 
emissions, vegetation effects from ozone exposure, ecological effects from mercury deposition, 
and climate effects. Even though the primary standards are designed to protect against adverse 
effects to human health, the emission reductions have welfare co-benefits in addition to the 
direct human health benefits. Due to data limitations for this proposed rule, we are unable to 
estimate the recreational visibility and residential visibility benefits associated for alternative 
standard combinations in 2020 even though we have a complete methodology for estimating 
benefits for scenarios with light extinction estimates for both the baseline and control 
scenarios. We intend to apply the approach described in this chapter in the RIA accompanying 
the final rulemaking, and as such, we solicit comment here. Despite our goal to quantify and 
monetize as many of the benefits as possible, welfare benefits remain unquantified and 
nonmonetized in this analysis due to data, methodology, and resource limitations. The 
monetized value of these unquantified effects is represented by adding an unknown “B” to the 
aggregate total benefits. These unquantified welfare benefits may be substantial, although the 
magnitude of these benefits is highly uncertain. 
6.3 Introduction to Welfare Benefits Analysis 
Emission reductions associated with the illustrative control strategies to attain 
alternative combinations of the PM NAAQS have numerous documented effects on 
environmental quality that affect human welfare. We define welfare effects to include any non-
health effects, including direct damages to property, either through impacts on material 
structures or by soiling of surfaces, direct economic damages in the form of lost productivity of 
  
6-2 
crops and trees, indirect damages through alteration of ecosystem functions, and indirect 
economic damages through the loss in value of recreational experiences or the existence value 
of important resources. EPA’s Integrated Science Assessments for PM (hereafter, “PM ISA”) 
(U.S. EPA, 2009b) and NOX/SOX—Ecological Criteria (U.S. EPA, 2008), as well as the Criteria 
Document for ozone (U.S. EPA, 2006) identify numerous physical and ecological effects known 
to be causally linked to these pollutants. This chapter describes these individual effects and 
how we would quantify and monetize them if there is enough data to do so. These welfare 
effects include changes in visibility, materials damage, ecological effects from PM deposition, 
ecological effects from nitrogen and sulfur emissions, vegetation effects from ozone exposure, 
ecological effects from mercury deposition, and climate effects. 
These welfare benefits are associated with reductions in emissions of specific pollutants 
resulting from emissions controls applied to attain the suite of PM standards, not the form or 
intent of any specific standard. Even though the primary standards are designed to protect 
against adverse effects to human health, the emission reductions have welfare co-benefits in 
addition to the direct human health benefits. 
The impacts of emission reductions associated with the illustrative control strategies can 
be grouped into four categories: directly emitted PM (e.g., metals, organic compounds, dust), 
reductions of PM2.5 precursors (e.g., NOx, SOx, VOCs), other ancillary reductions from 
illustrative control strategies (e.g., mercury and CO2), and secondary co-pollutant formation 
from PM precursors (e.g., ozone from NOx and VOCs). Regardless of the category, these 
emission changes are anticipated to affect ambient concentrations and deposition, and 
consequently affect public welfare. It is therefore appropriate and reasonable to include all the 
benefits associated with these emission reductions to provide a comprehensive understanding 
of the likely public impacts of attaining alternative standard level combinations. Table 6-1 
shows the welfare effects associated with the various pollutants (either directly or as a 
precursor to secondary formation of PM or ozone) that would be reduced by the illustrative 
control strategies to attain the alternative standard level combinations. 
Based on previous EPA analyses, we believe the welfare benefits associated with these 
non-health benefit categories could be significant (U.S. EPA, 2011b). Despite our goal to 
quantify and monetize as many of the benefits as possible, welfare benefits remain 
unquantified and nonmonetized in this analysis due to data, methodology, and resource 
limitations. For the final rulemaking, we anticipate that visibility would be the only welfare 
benefit category with sufficient data to quantify monetized benefits. Although it is possible to 
estimate some of the acidification and ozone vegetation benefits, we are limited by the time

and resources available, and we do not anticipate being able to quantify these benefits in the 
final rulemaking. The other welfare effects have additional data and methodology limitations 
that preclude us from monetizing those benefits. Therefore, the total benefits would be larger 
than we have estimated in this analysis. The monetized value of these unquantified effects is 
represented by adding an unknown “B,” which includes both unmonetized health and welfare 
effects, to the aggregate total for the cost-benefit comparison. These unquantified benefits 
may be substantial, although the magnitude of these benefits is highly uncertain. For these 
categories of welfare benefits that we are unable to quantify in this analysis, we include a 
qualitative analysis of the anticipated effects in this chapter to characterize the type and 
potential extent of those benefits. In Table 6-2, we identify the quantified and unquantified 
welfare benefits. 
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 6.3 provides the 
methodology for the visibility benefits analysis. Sections 6.4 through 6.6 provide qualitative 
benefits for the unquantified benefits categories of materials damage, climate, and ecosystem 
benefits. References are provided in Section 6.7. Additional information regarding technical 
details of the visibility benefits analysis is provided in Appendix 6a.

6.4 Visibility Benefits 
6.4.1 Visibility and Light Extinction 
The illustrative strategies designed to attain alternative standard level combinations 
would reduce emissions of directly emitted PM2.5 as well as precursor emissions such as NOx 
and SO2. These emission reductions would improve the level of visibility throughout the United 
States because these suspended particles and gases impair visibility by scattering and absorbing 
light (U.S. EPA, 2009b).1 Visibility is also referred to as visual air quality (VAQ),2 and it directly 
affects people’s enjoyment of a variety of daily activities (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Good visibility 
increases quality of life where individuals live and work, and where they travel for recreational 
activities, including sites of unique public value, such as the Great Smoky Mountains National 
Park (U. S. EPA, 2009b). This section discusses the economic benefits associated with improved 
visibility as a result of emission reductions associated with the alternative PM2.5 standard level 
combinations. 
Air pollution affects light extinction, a measure of how much the components of the 
atmosphere scatter and absorb light. More light extinction means that the clarity of visual 
images and visual range is reduced, all else held constant. Light extinction is the optical 
characteristic of the atmosphere that occurs when light is either scattered or absorbed, which 
converts the light to heat. Particulate matter and gases can both scatter and absorb light. Fine 
particles with significant light-extinction efficiencies include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, 
elemental carbon, and soil (Sisler, 1996). The extent to which any amount of light extinction 
affects a person’s ability to view a scene depends on both scene and light characteristics. For 
example, the appearance of a nearby object (e.g., a building) is generally less sensitive to a 
change in light extinction than the appearance of a similar object at a greater distance. See 
Figure 6-1 for an illustration of the important factors affecting visibility. 
According to the PM ISA, there is strong and consistent evidence that PM is the 
overwhelming source of visibility impairment in both urban and remote areas (U.S. EPA, 
2009b). After reviewing all of the evidence, the PM ISA concluded that the evidence was 
sufficient to conclude that a causal relationship exists between PM and visibility impairment. 
                                                     
1 The visibility benefits results shown in this section only reflect the emission reductions associated with attaining 
the alternative PM2.5 primary standards. Visibility benefits results associated with attaining alternative 
secondary PM NAAQS levels are provided in Chapter 13 of this RIA. 
2 We use the term VAQ to refer to the visibility effects caused solely by air quality conditions, excluding fog. 
  
6-7 
 
Figure 6-1. Important Factors Involved in Seeing a Scenic Vista (Malm, 1999) 
 
Visibility is commonly measured as either light extinction (βext), which is defined as the 
loss of light per unit of distance in terms of inverse megameters (Mm-1), or using the deciview 
(dv) metric, which is a logarithmic function of extinction (Pitchford and Malm, 1994). Deciviews, 
a unitless measure of visibility, are standardized for a reference distance in such a way that one 
deciview corresponds to a change of about 10% in available light.3 Pitchford and Malm (1994) 
characterize a change of one deciview as “a small but perceptible scenic change under many 
circumstances.”4 Extinction and deciviews are both physical measures of the amount of 
visibility impairment (e.g., the amount of “haze”), with both extinction and deciview increasing 
as the amount of haze increases. Using the relationships derived by Pitchford and Malm (1994), 
                                                     
3 Note that deciviews are inversely related to visual range, such that a decrease in deciviews implies an increase in 
visual range (i.e., improved visibility). Conversely, an increase in deciviews implies a decrease in visual range 
(i.e., decreased visibility). Deciview, in effect, is a measure of the lack of visibility. 
4 An instantaneous change of less than 1 deciview (i.e., less than 10% in the light extinction budget) represents a 
measurable improvement in visibility but may not be perceptible to the eye. The visibility benefits analysis 
described in this chapter reflects annual average changes in visibility, which are likely made up of periods with 
changes less than one deciview and periods with changes exceeding one deciview. Annual averages appear to 
more closely correspond to the economic literature relied upon for valuation of visibility changes in this 
analysis. The secondary PM NAAQS uses a different averaging time than the benefits analysis (see Chapter 13).

where VR denotes visual range (in kilometers) and βext denotes light extinction (in Mm-1).5 
Annual average visibility conditions (reflecting light extinction due to both 
anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources) vary regionally across the U.S. and by season 
(U.S. EPA, 2009b). Particulate sulfate is the dominant source of regional haze in the eastern U.S. 
(>50% of the particulate light extinction) and an important contributor to haze elsewhere in the 
country (>20% of particulate light extinction) (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Particulate nitrate is an 
important contributor to light extinction in California and the upper Midwestern U.S., 
particularly during winter (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Smoke plumes from large wildfires dominate many 
of the worst haze periods in the western U.S., while Asian dust only caused a few of the worst 
haze episodes, primarily in the more northerly regions of the west (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Higher 
visibility impairment levels in the East are due to generally higher concentrations of fine 
particles, particularly sulfates, and higher average relative humidity levels (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
Humidity increases visibility impairment because some particles such as ammonium sulfate and 
ammonium nitrate absorb water and form droplets that become larger when relative humidity 
increases, thus resulting in increased light scattering (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
Reductions in air pollution from implementation of various programs associated with 
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) provisions have resulted in substantial 
improvements in visibility, and will continue to do so in the future. Because trends in haze are 
closely associated with trends in particulate sulfate and nitrate due to the simple relationship 
between their concentration and light extinction, visibility trends have improved as emissions 
of SO2 and NOx have decreased over time due to air pollution regulations such as the Acid Rain 
Program (U.S. EPA, 2009b). For example, Figure 6-2 shows that visual range increased nearly 
50% in the eastern U.S. since 1992.6 Recent EPA regulations such as the Cross-State Air 
Pollution Rule (U.S. EPA, 2011c) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (U.S. EPA, 2011d) are 
anticipated to reduce SO2 emissions down to 2 million tons nationally, which would lead to 
substantial further improvement in visibility levels in the Eastern U.S. Calculated from light  
                                                     
5 It has been noted that, for a given deciview value, there can be many different visual ranges, depending on the 
other factors that affect visual range—such as light angle and altitude. See Appendix 6a for more detail. 
6 In Figure 6-2, the “best days” are defined as the best 20% of days, the “mid-range days” are defined as the middle 
20%, and the “worst days” are defined as the worst 20% of days (IMPROVE, 2010).

extinction efficiencies from Trijonis et al. (1987, 1988), annual average visual range under 
natural conditions in the East is estimated to be 150 km ± 45 km (i.e., 65 to 120 miles) and 230 
km ± 35 km (i.e., 120 to 165 miles) in the West (Irving, 1991). Figure 6-2 reflects the average 
trends in visual ranges at select monitors in the eastern and western areas of the U.S. since 
1992 using data from the IMPROVE monitoring network (U.S. EPA (2008) updated; IMPROVE 
(2010)). As an illustration of the improvements in visibility attributable to the CAAA, Figure 6-3 
depicts the modeled improvements in visibility associated with all the CAAA provisions in 2020 
compared to a counterfactual scenario without the CAAA (U.S. EPA, 2011b). While visibility 
trends have improved in most National Parks, the recent data show that these areas continue 
to suffer from visibility impairment beyond natural background levels (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
For the final rulemaking, we would generate light extinction estimates using the CMAQ 
model in conjunction with the IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual 
Environments) algorithm that estimates light extinction as a function of PM concentrations and 
relative humidity levels (U.S. EPA, 2009b).7 The procedure for calculating light extinction

8 It is important to note that visibility levels shown in these maps were modeled differently than the modeling 
conducted for this analysis, including coarser grid resolution (i.e., 36 km instead of 12 km). In addition, these 
maps present annual average visibility levels, which are different than the short-term averages being 
considered for the secondary standard.

associated with alternative standard level combinations is described in detail in Chapter 3 of 
this RIA. In addition, Appendix 6a describes how the spatial resolution of the light extinction 
estimates was then adjusted for the benefits analysis. 
It is important to note that the light extinction estimates used in this benefits analysis 
represent annual averages, which is different from the averaging times currently being 
considered for the secondary PM NAAQS. While the annual averages are influenced by days 
with extremely impaired visibility, the light extinction data is not sufficient to provide higher 
temporal resolution than quarterly averages. While we suspect that the most impaired days 
would have disproportionately improved visibility from the emission reductions associated with 
attaining the alternative standard level combinations, we are not able to quantify those 
impacts. These data gaps result in an underestimate of visibility benefits associated with 
extreme days. We recognize that recent advice from EPA’s Science Advisory Board recommends 
estimating visibility benefits considering daytime visibility on days with severe impairment (U.S. 
EPA-SAB, 2010), but the available data and valuation studies do not allow such fine temporal

While we have made substantial improvements in estimating light extinction nationally 
in this analysis, we are still developing a method to estimate coarse particle concentrations for 
the entire continental U.S. for estimating light extinction. As an interim solution, we provide 
sensitivity analyses to show the potential impact of omitting coarse particles from the 
recreational and residential visibility benefits analysis. For this sensitivity analysis, we selected 
the levels of coarse particles to represent the full range of possible annual concentrations from 
a recent report on the IMPROVE monitoring network (Debell et al., 2006). We estimate the 
sensitivity of impacts on recreational and residential visibility benefits using four levels of 
coarse particles: no coarse particles, 5 µg/m3 nationwide, 15 µg/m3 in the Southwest with 
5 µg/m3 in the rest of the country, and 15 µg/m3 in the Southwest with 8 µg/m3 in the rest of 
the country.9 
In Table 6-3, we also provide a qualitative assessment of how key assumptions in the 
estimation of light extinction affect the visibility benefits.

Mexico, Colorado, and Texas.

6.4.2 Visibility Valuation Overview 
In the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, the U.S. Government recognized visibility’s 
value to society by establishing a national goal to protect national parks and wilderness areas 
from visibility impairment caused by manmade pollution.10 Air pollution impairs visibility in 
both residential and recreational settings, and an individual’s willingness to pay (WTP) to 
improve visibility differs in these two settings. Benefits of residential visibility relate to the 
impact of visibility changes on an individual’s daily life (e.g., at home, at work, and while 
engaged in routine recreational activities). Benefits of recreational visibility relate to the impact 
of visibility changes manifested at parks and wilderness areas that are expected to be 
experienced by recreational visitors. 
Both recreational and residential visibility benefits consist of use values and nonuse 
values. Use values include the aesthetic benefits of better visibility, improved road and air 
safety, and enhanced recreation in activities like hunting and birdwatching. Nonuse values are 
based on a belief that the environment ought to exist free of human-induced haze. This 
includes the value of better visibility for use by others now and in the future (bequest value). 
Nonuse values may be more important for recreational areas, particularly national parks and 
monuments. 
The relationship between a household’s WTP and changes in visibility can be derived 
from a number of contingent valuation (CV) studies published in the peer-reviewed economics 
literature. The studies used to estimate the residential and recreational visibility benefits 
                                                     
10 See Section 169(a) of the Clean Air Act.  
  
6-13 
associated with alternative standard level combinations are described in the following sections. 
In addition to CV studies, hedonic valuation studies (Beron et al., 2001, 2004) also demonstrate 
that visibility has value, but we are unable to apply these valuation estimates in the context of 
estimating the visibility benefits associated with national regulations that reduce air pollution 
(Leggett and Neumann, 2004). 
In this approach, we assume that individuals value visibility for aesthetic reasons rather 
than viewing visibility as a proxy for other impacts associated with air pollution, such as health 
or ecological improvements. Some studies in the literature indicate that individuals may have 
difficulty distinguishing visibility from other aspects of air pollution (e.g., McClelland et al., 
1993; Chestnut and Rowe, 1990c; Carson, Mitchell, and Rudd, 1990). Because visual air quality 
is inherently multi-attribute, it is a challenge for all visibility valuation studies to isolate the 
value of visibility from the collection of intertwined benefits. Each study used in this analysis 
attempts to isolate visibility from other effect categories, but the different studies take 
different approaches (U.S. EPA, 2009b).11 Because we believe that residual potential for double-
counting visibility and health effects is relatively minimal, we do not further adjust the benefits 
to account for potentially embedded health effects beyond what the studies have already done. 
Similarly, it is important to try to distinguish residential visibility from recreational 
visibility benefits, specifically whether these can these be treated as distinct and additive 
benefit categories based on the available literature. In this analysis, we assume that residential 
and recreational visibility benefits are distinct and separable. It is conceivable that respondents 
to the recreational visibility survey may have partially included values for their own residential 
visibility when evaluating changes at national parks and wilderness areas located in their region 
of the country. However, we believe that the potential for double-counting recreational and 
residential visibility is minimal for several reasons. First, we only include a subset of areas in the 
primary estimates of recreational and residential visibility benefits, which overlap in only a few 
places.12 Second, a number of the overlapping counties are wilderness areas, which contribute 
little to the overall monetized benefits due to low visitation rates, rather than highly visited 
national parks. For example, Los Angeles County is home to the San Gabriel Wilderness Area, 
which has 10 thousand annual visitors (NPS, 2008). If we exclude the residential visibility 
benefits that accrue to 10 million residents in Los Angeles County and only include the very 
small recreational visibility benefits for the wilderness area, we would be substantially biasing 
                                                     
11 See Leggett and Neumann (2004) for a more detailed discussion of this issue.  
12 As described in detail in Sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.4, we only include a subset of visibility benefits in the primary 
benefits estimates, while providing the rest of the visibility benefits in sensitivity analyses. 
  
6-14 
the overall estimates downward. For these reasons, we believe that the potential for double-
counting is minimal. 
In the next sections, we describe the methodology and limitations of the recreational 
and residential visibility analysis. Consistent with the health benefits analysis, the monetized 
visibility benefits would be adjusted for inflation and income growth. These benefits would be 
specific to the analysis year, and as population and income increase over time, these benefits 
can be expected to increase each year for the same incremental change in light extinction. 
6.4.3 Recreational Visibility 
6.4.3.1 Methodology 
The methodology for estimating recreational visibility benefits in this RIA follows a well-
established approach that has been used in numerous EPA analyses (U.S. EPA, 2006; U.S. EPA, 
2005; U.S. EPA, 2010; U.S. EPA, 1999; U.S. EPA, 2011b). For the purposes of this analysis, 
recreational visibility benefits apply to Class I areas, such as National Parks and Wilderness 
Areas.13 Although other recreational settings such as National Forests, state parks, or even 
hiking trails or roadside areas have important scenic vistas, a lack of suitable economic 
valuation literature to identify these other areas and/or a lack of visitation data prevents us 
from generating estimates for those recreational vista areas. 
Under the 1999 Regional Haze Rule (64 FR 35714), states are required to set goals 
develop long-term strategies to improve visibility in Class I areas, with the goal of achieving 
natural background visibility levels by 2064. In conjunction with the U.S. National Park Service 
(NPS), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), other Federal land managers, and State organizations in 
the U.S., the U.S. EPA has supported visibility monitoring in national parks and wilderness areas 
since 1988. The monitoring network known as IMPROVE includes 156 sites that represent the 
Class I areas across the country (U.S. EPA, 2009b).14 The IMPROVE monitoring network 
measures fine particles, coarse particles, and key PM2.5 constituents that affect visibility, such 
as sulfate, nitrate, organic and elemental carbon, soil dust, and several other elements. 
Figure 6-4 identifies where each of these parks are located in the U.S. 
                                                     
13 Hereafter referred to as Class I areas, which are defined as areas of the country such as national parks, national 
wilderness areas, and national monuments that have been set aside under Section 169(a) of the Clean Air Act 
to receive the most stringent degree of air quality protection. Mandatory Class I federal lands fall under the 
jurisdiction of three federal agencies, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Forest 
Service. EPA has designated 156 areas as mandatory Class I federal areas for visibility protection, including 
national parks that exceed 6,000 acres and wilderness areas that exceed 5,000 acres (40 CFR §81.400). 
14 The formula used to estimate light extinction from concentrations of PM constituents and relative humidity is 
referred to as the IMPROVE algorithm.

Figure 6-4. Mandatory Class I Areas in the U.S. 
 
For recreational visibility, EPA has determined that only one existing study provides 
adequate monetary estimates of the value of changes in recreational visibility: a contingent 
valuation (CV) survey conducted by Chestnut and Rowe in 1988 (1990a; 1990b). Although there 
are several other studies in the literature on recreational visibility valuation, they are older and 
use less robust methods. In EPA’s judgment, the Chestnut and Rowe study contains many of the 
elements of a valid CV study and is sufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for monetary 
estimates of the benefits of visibility changes in recreational areas.15 This study serves as an 
essential input to our estimates of the benefits from improving recreational visibility. 
In this analysis, we assume that the household WTP is higher if the Class I recreational 
area is located close to the person’s home (i.e., in the same region of the country). People 
appear to be willing to pay more for visibility improvements at parks and wilderness areas that 
                                                     
15 In 1999, EPA’s SAB stated, “many members of the Council believe that the Chestnut and Rowe study is the best 
available” study for recreational visibility valuation” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999). In July 2010, the SAB stated that the 
studies were dated, but EPA “used what the Council understands to be the only relevant studies.” (U.S. EPA-
SAB, 2010)

are in the same region as their household than at those that are not in the same region as their 
household (Chestnut and Rowe, 1990a, 1990b). This is plausible, because people are more likely 
to visit, be familiar with, and care about parks and wilderness areas in their own part of the 
country. However, studies have also found many people who had never visited and never 
planned to visit the parks still had positive values for visibility improvements in those locations 
(Chestnut and Rowe, 1990b). 
The Chestnut and Rowe survey measured the demand for visibility in Class I areas 
managed by the NPS in three broad regions of the country: California, the Colorado Plateau 
(Southwest), and the Southeast.16 Respondents in five states were asked about their WTP to 
protect national parks or NPS-managed wilderness areas within a particular region. The survey 
used photographs reflecting different visibility levels in the specified recreational areas. The 
authors used the survey data to estimate household WTP values for improved visibility in each 
region. 
The separate regions were developed to capture differences in household WTP values 
based on proximity to recreational areas. Chestnut (1997) also concluded that, for a given 
region, a substantial proportion of the WTP is attributable to one specific park within the 
region. This so called “indicator park” is the most well-known and frequently visited park within 
a particular region. The indicator parks for the three studied park regions are Yosemite National 
Park for the California region, the Grand Canyon National Park for the Southwest region, and 
Shenandoah National Park for the Southeast region. In accordance with the methodology in 
Chestnut (1997), this analysis calculates the benefits from households for a particular region for 
a given change in visibility at a particular Class I area. In theory, summing benefits from 
households in all regions would yield the total monetary benefits associated with a given 
visibility improvement at a particular park, which could then be summed with other parks and 
regions to estimate national benefits. Because recreational visibility benefits may reflect the 
value an individual places on visibility improvements regardless of whether the person plans to 
visit the park, all households in the U.S. are assumed to derive some benefit from 
improvements to Class I areas. 
To value recreational visibility improvements associated with its rulemakings, EPA 
developed a valuation WTP equation function based on the baseline of visibility, the magnitude 
                                                     
16 The Colorado Plateau (Southwest) region is defined as the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. 
The Southeast region is defined as the states of West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, 
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky. The California region includes the state of 
California and one wilderness area in Nevada.  
  
6-17 
of the visibility improvement, and household income. This function requires light extinction 
estimates measured as visual range. The behavioral parameters of this equation were taken 
from analysis of the Chestnut and Rowe survey (1990a, 1990b). These parameters were used to 
calibrate WTP for the visibility changes resulting from this rule.17 As an example, household 
WTP for a visibility improvement at a park in their region takes the following form: 
 𝑊𝑇𝑃(∆𝑄𝑖𝑘) = 𝑚 − [𝑚𝜌 +  𝛾𝑖𝑘 ∗ �𝑄0𝑖𝑘𝜌 − 𝑄1𝑖𝑘𝜌 �]1𝜌 
where: 
i indexes region, 
k indexes park, 
m = household income, 
ρ = shape parameter (0.1), 
γ = parameter corresponding to the visibility at in-region parks, 
Q0 = starting visibility, and 
Q1 = visibility after change. 
As discussed in more detail in Appendix 6a of this RIA, this approach to valuing 
recreational visibility changes is an application of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) 
utility function approach and is based on the preference calibration method developed by 
Smith, Van Houtven, and Pattanayak (2002).18 Available evidence indicates that households are 
willing to pay more for a given visibility improvement as their income increases (Chestnut, 
1997). Using the income elasticity calculated by Chestnut (1997), the visibility benefits assume a 
1% increase in income is associated with a 0.9% increase in WTP for a given change in visibility. 
WTP responses reported in Chestnut and Rowe (1990a, 1990b) were also region-specific, rather 
than park-specific. As visibility improvements are not constant across all parks in a region, we 
must infer park-specific visibility parameters in order to calculate WTP for projected visibility 
changes. As the quantity and quality of parks differs between regions, we apportion the 
regional WTP parameters based on relative visitation rates at the different parks, because this 
statistic likely captures both park quality (more people visit parks with more desirable 
attributes, so collective WTP is likely higher) and quantity (more people visit parks in a region if 
                                                     
17 The parameters for each region are available in Appendix 6a of this RIA. 
18 The Constant Elasticity of Substitution utility function has been chosen for use in this analysis due to its flexibility 
when illustrating the degree of substitutability present in various economic relationships (in this case, the 
tradeoff between income and improvements in visibility). 
  
6-18 
the parks are more numerous, so collective WTP is likely higher).19 We also adjust the benefits 
for inflation and growth in real income. 
Recreational visibility benefits are calculated as the sum of the household WTPs for 
changes in light extinction. We assume that each household is valuing the first or only visibility 
change that occurs in a particular area. The benefits at particular areas can be calculated by 
assuming that the subset of visibility changes of interest is the first or the only set of changes 
being valued by households. Estimating benefit components in this way will yield slightly 
upwardly biased estimates of benefits, because disposable income is not reduced by the WTPs 
for any prior visibility improvements. The upward bias should be extremely small, however, 
because all of the WTPs for visibility changes are very small relative to income. 
The primary estimate for recreational visibility only includes benefits for 86 Class I areas 
in the original study regions (i.e., California, the Southwest, and the Southeast).20 These 
benefits reflect the value to households living in the same region as the Class I area as well as 
values for all households in the United States living outside the state containing the Class I area. 
The Chestnut and Rowe study did not measure values for visibility improvement in Class 
I areas in the Northwest, Northern Rockies, and Rest of U.S. regions.21 Their study covered 86 of 
the 156 Class I areas in the United States. We can infer the value of visibility changes in the 70 
additional Class I areas by transferring values of visibility changes at Class I areas in the study 
regions.22 In order to obtain estimates of WTP for visibility changes for parks in these additional 
regions, we have to transfer the WTP values from the studied regions. This benefits transfer 
approach introduces additional uncertainty into the estimates. However, we have taken steps 
to adjust the WTP values to account for the possibility that a visibility improvement in parks 
within one region may not necessarily represent the same visibility improvement at parks 
within a different region in terms of environmental improvement. This may be due to 
                                                     
19 We use 2008 park visitation data from the National Park Service Statistical Abstracts (NPS, 2008), as this is the 
most current data available. Where the data for a particular park was not representative of normal visitation 
rates at that park (for example due to fire damage that occurred during that year), we substitute data from the 
prior year. We use 1997 visitation data for those wilderness areas not included in the National Park Service 
Statistical Abstracts, as more current data is not readily available. As visitation rates for Wilderness Areas are 
small compared to visitation rates in National Parks, the inaccuracies generated by using 1997 data are likely to 
also be small.  
20 The 86 Class I areas in the three studied park regions represented 68% of the total visitor days to Class I areas in 
2008 (NPS, 2008). 
21 The Northwest region is defined as the states of Washington and Oregon. The Northern Rockies region include 
the states of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The Rest of the U.S. region includes 
all other states not included in the other 5 regions.  
22 The 70 additional Class I areas represented 32% of the total visitor days to Class I areas in 2008 (NPS, 2008). 
  
6-19 
differences in the scenic vistas at different parks, uniqueness of the parks, or other factors, such 
as public familiarity with the park resource. To account for this potential difference, we 
adjusted the transferred WTP being transferred by the ratio of visitor days in the two regions.23 
A complete description of the benefits transfer method used to infer values for visibility 
changes in Class I areas outside the study regions is provided in Appendix 6a of this RIA. 
Table 6-4 indicates which studied park regions we used to estimate the value in the non-
studied park regions. Figure 6-5 shows how the visitation rates vary across Class I areas and 
regions and indicates whether each Class 1 area is located within one of the studied regions. 
6.4.3.2 Recreational Visibility Limitations, Caveats, and Uncertainties 
This analysis relies upon several data sources as inputs, including emission inventories, 
air quality data from models (with their associated parameters and inputs), relative humidity 
measurements, park information, economic data and assumptions for monetizing benefits. 
Each of these inputs may contain uncertainty that would affect the recreational visibility 
benefits estimates. Though we are unable to quantify the cumulative effect of all of these 
uncertainties in this analysis, we do provide information on uncertainty based on the available 
data, including model evaluation24 and sensitivity analyses to characterize major omissions (i.e., 
benefits from parks in non-studied park regions and inclusion of coarse particles). Although we 
strive to incorporate as many quantitative assessments of uncertainty as possible, we are 
severely limited by the available data, and there are several aspects that we are only able to 
address qualitatively. A summary of the key assumptions including direction and magnitude of 
bias is provided in Table 6-5. 
One major source of uncertainty for the recreational visibility benefits estimate is the 
benefits transfer process. Choices regarding the functional form and key parameters of the 
estimating equation for WTP for the affected population could have significant effects on the 
magnitude of the estimates. Assumptions about how individuals respond to changes in visibility 
that are either very small or outside the range covered in the Chestnut and Rowe study could 
also affect the estimates. 
                                                     
23 For example, if total park visitation in a transfer region was less than visitation in a study region, transferred WTP 
would be adjusted downward by the ratio of the two. 
24 See Chapter 4 for more information on model evaluation.

Since the valuation of recreational visibility benefits relies upon one study (Chestnut and 
Rowe, 1990a; 1990b), all of the uncertainties within that study also pertain to this analysis. In 
general, the survey design and implementation reflect the period in which the Chestnut and 
Rowe study was conducted. Since that time, many improvements to the design of stated 
preference surveys have been developed (e.g., Arrow, 1993), but we are currently unaware of 
newer studies that we could incorporate into our visibility benefits methodology. Although 
Chestnut and Rowe still offers the best available WTP estimates, the study has a number of 
limitations, including: 
 The vintage of the survey (late 1980s) invites questions whether the values would 
still be valid for current populations, or more importantly for this analysis, future 
populations in 2020. 
 The survey focused on visibility improvements in and around specific national parks 
and wilderness areas. Given that national parks and wilderness areas exhibit unique 
characteristics, it is not clear whether the WTP estimate obtained from this survey 
can be transferred to other national parks and wilderness areas, even other parks 
within the studied park regions, without introducing additional uncertainty. 
  
6-22 
 The survey focused only on populations in five states, so the application of the 
estimated values to populations outside those states requires that preferences of 
populations in the five surveyed states be similar to those of non-surveyed states. 
 There is an inherent difficulty in separating values expressed for visibility 
improvements from an overall value for improved air quality. The survey attempted 
to control for this by informing respondents that “other households are being asked 
about visibility, human health, and vegetation protections in urban areas and at 
national parks in other regions.” However, most of the respondents did not feel that 
they were able to segregate recreational visibility at national parks entirely from 
residential visibility and health effects. 
 It is not clear exactly what visibility improvements the respondents to the survey 
were valuing. The WTP question asked about changes in average visibility, but the 
survey respondents were shown photographs of only daytime, summer conditions, 
when visibility is generally at its worst. It is possible that the respondents believed 
those visibility conditions held year-round, in which case they would have been 
valuing much larger overall improvements in visibility than what otherwise would be 
the case. For the purpose of the benefits analysis for this rule, EPA assumed that 
respondents provided values for changes in annual average visibility. Because most 
policies would result in a shift in the distribution of visibility (usually affecting the 
worst days more than the best days), the annual average may not be the most 
relevant metric for policy analysis. 
 The survey did not include reminders of possible substitutes (e.g., visibility at other 
parks) or budget constraints. These reminders are considered to be best practice for 
stated preference surveys. 
6.4.4 Residential Visibility 
6.4.4.1 Methodology 
Residential visibility benefits are those that occur from visibility changes in urban, 
suburban, and rural areas where people live. These benefits are important because some 
people living in certain urban areas may place a high value on unique scenic resources in or 
near these areas that are outside of Class I areas. For example, the State of Colorado 
established a local visibility standard for the Denver metropolitan area in 1990 (Ely et al., 1991). 
For the purposes of this analysis, residential visibility improvements are defined as those that 
occur specifically in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). 
In the Urban-focused Visibility Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2010b) and the Policy Assessment 
for the Review of the PM NAAQS (U.S. EPA, 2011a), several preference studies provide the 
  
6-23 
foundation for the secondary PM NAAQS.25 The three completed survey studies (all in the west) 
included Denver, Colorado (Ely et al., 1991), one in the lower Fraser River valley near 
Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), Canada (Pryor, 1996), and one in Phoenix, Arizona (BBC 
Research & Consulting, 2003). A pilot focus group study was conducted in Washington, DC on 
behalf of EPA to inform the 2006 PM NAAQS review (Abt Associates Inc., 2001). While these 
studies indicate that visual air quality associated with ambient levels of air pollution in urban 
areas have been deemed unacceptable, they do not provide sufficient information on which to 
develop monetized benefits estimates. Specifically, the public perception studies do not 
provide preferences expressed in dollar values, even though they do provide additional 
evidence that the benefits associated with improving residential visibility are not zero. 
A wide range of published, peer-reviewed literature supports a non-zero value for 
residential visibility (Brookshire et al., 1982; Rae, 1983; Tolley et al., 1984; Chestnut and Rowe, 
1990c; McClelland et al., 1993; Loehman et al., 1994). Furthermore, Chestnut and Rowe (1990c) 
conclude that residential visibility benefits are likely to be at least as high as recreational 
visibility benefits because of the quantity of time most people spend in and near their homes 
and the substantial number of people affected. In previous assessments, EPA used a study on 
residential visibility valuation conducted in 1990 (McClelland et al., 1993). Consistent with 
advice from EPA’s Science Advisory Board (SAB), EPA designated the McClelland et al. study as 
significantly less reliable for regulatory benefit-cost analysis, although it does provide useful 
estimates on the order of magnitude of residential visibility benefits (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999).26 In 
order to estimate residential visibility benefits in this analysis, we have replaced the previous 
methodology with a new benefits transfer approach and incorporated additional valuation 
studies. This new approach was developed for The Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act 1990 
to 2020: EPA Report to Congress (U.S. EPA, 2011)27 and reviewed by the SAB (U. S. EPA-SAB, 
2004, 2010). 
                                                     
25 For more detail about these preference studies, including information about study designs and sampling 
protocols, please see Section 2 of the Particulate Matter Urban-Focused Visibility Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2010b). 
26 EPA’s Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis noted that the McClelland et al. (1993) study may not 
incorporate two potentially important adjustments. First, their study does not account for the “warm glow” 
effect, in which respondents may provide higher willingness to pay estimates simply because they favor “good 
causes” such as environmental improvement. Second, while the study accounts for non-response bias, it may 
not employ the best available methods. As a result of these concerns, the Council recommended that 
residential visibility be omitted from the overall primary benefits estimate. (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999) 
27 This report is also known as the Second Prospective 812 analysis.  
  
6-24 
To value residential visibility improvements, the new approach draws upon information 
from the Brookshire et al. (1979), Loehman et al. (1985) and Tolley et al. (1984) studies.28 Each 
of the studies provides estimates of household WTP to improve visibility conditions. While 
uncertainty exists regarding the precision of these older, stated-preference residential 
valuation studies, we believe their results support the argument that individuals have a non-
zero value for residential visibility improvements. These studies provide primary visibility values 
for Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Mobile, San Francisco, and Washington 
D.C.29 
In accordance with Chestnut and Rowe (1990c), we utilize the WTP estimates and the 
associated change in visual range from each study to estimate the β parameter for the eight 
study areas. The β parameter represents the WTP for a specific improvement in visibility in a 
specific location. Where studies provide multiple estimates for visual range improvements, we 
estimate β by regressing the natural log of the ratio of visual range following and prior to 
improvement against WTP. To express these value estimates in comparable terms across study 
locations, we express household WTP for a change in visual range in a specific MSA using the 
following function: 
 WTP (∆VR)= β* ln ( VR1
VR0
) 
where: 
VR0 = mean annual visual range in miles before the improvement, 
VR1 = mean annual visual range in miles after the improvement, and 
β = parameter. 
Total residential visibility benefits within a particular MSA are driven by visibility 
improvements, population density, and the WTP value applied. Only those people living within 
                                                     
28 Loehman et al. (1985) and Brookshire et al. (1979) were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals (see 
Loehman et al. (1994) and Brookshire et al. (1982). The specific details need to compute visibility benefits using 
Tolley et al. (1984) were not subsequently published, but the overall work including study and survey design 
was subject to peer review during study development. (see Leggett et al, 2004 and Patterson et al., 2005) In 
addition, Tolley et al. subsequently published a book based on this research, which notes in the preface that 
the methods were critiqued throughout by various external economists (Tolley et al., 1988). 
29 Recognizing potential fundamental issues associated with data collected in Cincinnati and Miami (e.g., see 
Chestnut et al. (1986) and Chestnut and Rowe (1990c), we do not include values for these cities in our analysis. 
The 8 MSAs where the valuation studies were conducted represent 15% of the total US population in 2020 (U.S. 
Census).

in an MSA are assumed to receive benefits from improved residential visibility. In other words, 
unlike recreational visibility, we do not assume a non-use value by people who live outside the 
MSA for residential visibility. Table 6-6 provides a summary of these valuation estimates for 
each study location, as well as an illustrative implied WTP value for a 10% improvement in 
visual range. As shown, the implied annual per-household WTP estimates for a hypothetical 
10% improvement ranges from $21 to $220, depending on the study area. It is not surprising 
that such a range of values exists, as these study areas all feature different landscapes and 
vistas, populations and prevailing visibility conditions.

a The table assumes full attainment of the alternative standard level combinations. Because these benefits occur 
within the analysis year, the monetized benefits are the same for all discount rates. These benefits reflect the 
WTP for households who live in MSAs. 
Similar to recreational visibility benefits, we then incorporate preference calibration 
using the method developed by Smith, Van Houtven, and Pattanayak (2002), which is discussed 
in more detail in Appendix 6a of this RIA. To express these “preference-calibrated” value 
estimates across study locations, we express household WTP for a change in visual range in a 
specific MSA using the following function: 
  
  
6-26 
 𝑊𝑇𝑃(∆𝑉𝑅) = 𝑚 − [𝑚𝜌 +  𝜃 ∗ �𝑉𝑅0𝜌 − 𝑉𝑅1𝜌�]1𝜌 
where: 
m = household income, 
ρ = shape parameter (0.1), 
θ = WTP parameter corresponding to the visibility at MSA, 
VR0 = starting visibility, and 
VR1 = visibility after change. 
While the primary estimate for residential visibility includes benefits in only the eight 
MSAs included in the valuation studies, people living in other urban areas also have non-zero 
values for residential visibility. For this reason, the sensitivity analysis for residential visibility 
includes the benefits extrapolated to the 351 additional MSAs.30 Because there is considerable 
uncertainty about the validity of this benefit transfer approach, these extrapolated benefits are 
included in a sensitivity analysis only. 
There are many factors that could influence WTP for residential visibility, and these 
factors vary across urban areas. For the purpose of this analysis, we utilize the benefit transfer 
approach developed for the Second Prospective 812 analysis, but we recognize that there are 
alternative methods that we could have used. We assigned a valuation study area to each MSA 
based on two factors: geographic proximity to one of the eight study cities and elevation. Any 
MSA with a county elevation above 1,500 meters was assigned the Denver valuation instead of 
the nearest study area.31 Because residents of Denver have a dramatic view of the Rocky 
Mountains that is rarely obstructed by trees, it is plausible that they might have a greater 
interest in protecting visibility than a city without nearby mountains. The geographic proximity 
factor is constrained in two areas. The San Francisco valuation study is only assigned to the six 
counties in the San Francisco Bay area MSAs because the study is unique among the three 
regarding the temporal description of visibility conditions, landscape/vistas, and prevailing 
weather conditions. In addition, the Los Angeles valuation was assigned to the Riverside MSA 
                                                     
30 The 351 additional MSAs plus the 8 study area MSAs represent 84% of the total US population in 2020 (U.S. 
Census). 
31 Elevation data represent the county-level maximum, which were calculated using the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst tool 
“Zonal Statistics” using the geographic database HYDRO1K for North America (U.S. Geological Survey, 1997).

despite exceeding the elevation threshold.32 Figure 6-6 indicates the study cities as well as the 
assignment of the other MSAs to the study cities. 
6.4.4.2 Residential Visibility Limitations, Caveats, and Uncertainties 
Similar to recreational visibility benefits, there are many data inputs into the residential 
visibility benefits that contribute to overall uncertainty. We provide sensitivity analyses to 
characterize major omissions (i.e., benefits in other MSAs and coarse particles). A summary of 
the key assumptions including direction and magnitude of bias is provided in Table 6-7.

32 Riverside MSA is assigned to the Los Angeles study area because a significant portion of Riverside County itself is 
located in the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which can be considered by to be part of the same 
regulated airshed as Los Angeles. The geographic assignment is preserved despite exceeding the elevation 
threshold because Riverside is adjacent to one of the study cities and this region has a particular set of location-
specific characteristics that set it apart from Denver.

The valuation studies relied upon for the residential visibility benefits, although 
representing the best available estimates, have a number of limitations. These include the 
following: 
 The survey design and implementation reflects the period in which the surveys were 
conducted. Since that time, many improvements to the stated preference methods 
have been developed. 
 The vintage of the surveys (1970s and 1980s) invites questions whether the values 
are still valid for current populations, or more importantly for this analysis, future 
populations in 2020. 
 The survey focused only on populations in eight cities, so the transfer of the WTP 
estimates values to populations outside those cities requires that their preferences 
be similar to those in non-surveyed cities, as well as the visibility attributes be 
similar across study and transfer MSAs. 
 There is an inherent difficulty in separating values expressed for visibility 
improvements from an overall value for improved air quality. The studies attempted 
to control for this, but most of the respondents did not feel that they were able to 
segregate residential visibility entirely from recreational visibility and health effects. 
  
6-29 
6.4.5 Discussion of Visibility Benefits 
As described in the previous sections of this chapter, the estimation of visibility benefits 
is complex and suffers from unavoidable limitations. While we are confident that the underlying 
scientific literature supports a non-zero estimate for visibility benefits attributable to emission 
reductions, we are less confident in the magnitude of those benefits outside of previously 
studied locations. While acknowledging these limitations, it is important to emphasize that 
these valuation studies have withstood intense scrutiny (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010). To minimize 
uncertainties related to extrapolation and double counting, we only include a subset of 
monetized visibility benefits in the primary benefits estimate to correspond with our higher 
level of confidence in recreational benefits within the study regions and residential benefits 
within the study cities. Although we are confident that visibility benefits extend beyond these 
studied areas, we are less confident about the magnitude of those benefits. 
In the approach described here, we have revised several aspects of the visibility benefits 
analysis since previous RIAs, including light extinction estimation methods, visitation data for 
Class I areas (used in extrapolating benefits), valuation studies for residential visibility benefits, 
and the benefit transfer technique for residential benefits. Including residential visibility 
benefits in the primary benefits estimates reflects an evolution in our understanding of the 
nature and importance of the effect on public welfare from visibility impairment to a more 
multifaceted approach that includes non-Class I areas, such as urban areas. This evolution has 
occurred in conjunction with the expansion of available PM data and information from 
associated studies of public perception, valuation and personal comfort and well-being. While 
visibility preference studies (Abt Associates Inc., 2001, Ely et al., 1991, Pryor, 1996, BBC 
Research & Consulting, 2003) also provide support for a non-zero benefits estimate, these 
surveys did not include questions that would enable monetization of those preferences. 
Despite these improvements, we are limited by the available peer-reviewed studies on 
visibility benefits, which have not undergone a similar expansion as the health literature. In 
fact, to our knowledge, no peer-reviewed studies have been published in the past 10 years on 
visibility valuation that we are able to incorporate into this analysis.33 When EPA’s Scientific 
Advisory Council reviewed the visibility benefits analysis for the Second Prospective 812 
analysis, they also lamented on the need for additional research to improve methods and 
estimates (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010). Because of time and resource constraints, performing original 
                                                     
33 While several studies using hedonic valuation techniques to value air quality have been published in the last 10 
years (Kim et al., 2010; Bayer et al., 2009; Anselin and Lozano-Gracia, 2006, 2008; Chay and Greenstone, 2005), 
these studies do not provide any mechanism to distinguish visibility from health or ecosystem effects.  
  
6-30 
research for regulatory analyses of specific policy actions is infeasible. Therefore, we actively 
encourage and solicit new research to address many of the limitations in our analysis. Most 
importantly, we are interested in recently published national-scale visibility valuation studies 
that incorporate current CV best practices, as the existing studies are limited to specific subset 
of geographic areas. Other important research questions that remain unresolved include 
identifying factors that affect valuation preferences in order to facilitate benefits transfer from 
the original studies to transfer sites across localities, disentangling health and ecosystem 
valuation from visibility valuation, usefulness of preference calibration, and potential role of 
hedonic valuation approaches. Many of these same research needs were identified by Cropper 
(2000), but they have yet to be addressed by the research community. 
For these reasons, EPA requests public comment on the approach taken here to 
quantify the monetary value of changes in recreational and residential visibility. Specifically, we 
request comment on additional valuation studies, methods for benefit transfer, and methods 
for characterizing uncertainty. 
6.5 Materials Damage Benefits 
Building materials including metals, stones, cements, and paints undergo natural 
weathering processes from exposure to environmental elements (e.g., wind, moisture, 
temperature fluctuations, sunlight, etc.). Pollution can worsen and accelerate these effects. 
Deposition of PM is associated with both physical damage (materials damage effects) and 
impaired aesthetic qualities (soiling effects). Wet and dry deposition of PM can physically affect 
materials, adding to the effects of natural weathering processes, by potentially promoting or 
accelerating the corrosion of metals, by degrading paints and by deteriorating building 
materials such as stone, concrete and marble (U.S. EPA, 2009b). The effects of PM are 
exacerbated by the presence of acidic gases and can be additive or synergistic due to the 
complex mixture of pollutants in the air and surface characteristics of the material. Acidic 
deposition has been shown to have an effect on materials including zinc/galvanized steel and 
other metal, carbonate stone (as monuments and building facings), and surface coatings 
(paints) (Irving, 1991). The effects on historic buildings and outdoor works of art are of 
particular concern because of the uniqueness and irreplaceability of many of these objects. 
The PM ISA concludes that evidence is sufficient to support a causal relationship 
between PM and effects on materials (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Considerable research has been 
conducted on the effects of air pollutants on metal surfaces due to the economic importance of 
these materials, especially steel, zinc, aluminum, and copper. Moisture is the single greatest 
  
6-31 
factor promoting metal corrosion; however, deposited PM can have additive, antagonistic or 
synergistic effects. In general, SO2 is more corrosive than NOx although mixtures of NOx, SO2 
and other particulate matter corrode some metals at a faster rate than either pollutant alone 
(U.S. EPA, 2008). Metal structures are usually coated by alkaline corrosion product layers and 
thus are subject to increased corrosion by acidic deposition. In addition, research has 
demonstrated that iron, copper, and aluminum-based products are subject to increased 
corrosion due to pollution (Irving, 1991). Information from both the PM ISA (U.S. EPA, 2009b) 
and NOx/SOx ISA (U.S. EPA, 2008) suggest that the extent of damage to metals due to ambient 
PM is variable and dependent upon the type of metal, prevailing environmental conditions, rate 
of natural weathering and presence or absence of other pollutants 
In addition, the deposition of PM can cause soiling, which is the accumulation of dirt, 
dust, and ash on exposed surfaces such as metal, glass, stone and paint. Particles consisting 
primarily of carbonaceous compounds can cause soiling of commonly used building materials 
and culturally important items such as statues and works of art. Soiling occurs when PM 
accumulates on an object and alters the optical characteristics (appearance). The reflectivity of 
a surface may be changed or presence of particulates may alter light transmission. These 
effects can reduce the aesthetic value of a structure or result in reversible or irreversible 
damage to statues, artwork and architecturally or culturally significant buildings. Due to soiling 
of building surfaces by PM, the frequency and duration of cleaning or repainting may be 
increased. In addition to natural factors, exposure to PM may give painted surfaces a dirty 
appearance. Pigments in works of art can be degraded or discolored by atmospheric pollutants, 
especially sulfates (U.S. EPA, 2008). Previous assessments estimated household soiling benefits 
based on the Manuel et al. (1982) study of consumer expenditures on cleaning and household 
maintenance. However, the data used to estimate household soiling damages in the Manuel et 
al. study is from a 1972 consumer expenditure survey and as such may not accurately represent 
consumer preferences in the future. In light of this significant limitation, we believe that this 
study cannot provide reliable estimates of the likely magnitude of the benefits of reduced PM 
household soiling. 
In order to estimate the monetized benefits associated with reducing materials damage 
and household soiling, quantitative relationships are needed between particle size, 
concentration, chemical concentrations and frequency of maintenance and repair. Such an 
analysis would require three steps: 
1. Develop a national inventory of sensitive materials; 
  
6-32 
2. Derive concentration-response functions that relate material damage to change in 
pollution concentration or deposition; and, 
3. Estimate the value of lost materials and/or repair of damage. 
Due to data limitations and uncertainties inherent in each of these steps, we have 
chosen not to include a monetized estimate of materials damage and household soiling in this 
analysis. The PM ISA concluded that there is considerable uncertainty with regard to interaction 
of co-pollutants in regards to materials damage and soiling processes (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
Previous EPA benefits analyses have provided quantitative estimates of materials damage (U.S. 
EPA, 2011b) and household soiling damage (U.S. EPA, 1999). Consistent with SAB advice (U.S. 
EPA, 1998), we determined that the existing data are not sufficient to calculate a reliable 
estimate of future year household soiling damages (U.S. EPA, 1998). These previous analyses 
have shown that materials damage benefits are significantly smaller than the health benefits 
associated with reduced exposure to PM2.5 and ozone, or even visibility benefits. However, 
studies of materials damage to historic buildings and outdoor artwork in Sweden (Grosclaude 
and Soguel, 1994) indicate that these benefits could be an order of magnitude larger than 
household soiling benefits. 
In the absence of quantified benefits, we provide a qualitative description of the 
avoided damage associated with reducing PM and PM precursor pollutants. Table 6-8 shows 
the effect of various PM2.5 precursor pollutants and other co-pollutants on various materials.

6.6 Climate Benefits 
Actions taken by state and local governments to implement the proposed PM2.5 
standards are likely to have implications for climate change because emission controls 
ultimately implemented to meet the standard may have impacts on emissions of long-lived 
greenhouse gas (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), short-lived climate forcers such as black 
carbon (BC), and cooling aerosols like organic carbon (OC). Our ability to quantify the climate 
effects of these proposed standards is quite limited due to lack of available information on the 
co-controlled GHG emission reductions, the energy and associated climate gas implications of 
control technologies assumed in the illustrative regulatory alternatives, and remaining 
uncertainties regarding the impact of long-lived and short-lived climate forcer impacts on 
climate change. For this RIA, we discuss qualitatively the implications of potential emission 
reductions in warming and cooling aerosols and changes in long-lived GHG emissions such as 
CO2 for the regulatory alternatives. Implementation strategies undertaken by state and local 
governments to comply with the standards may differ from the illustrative control strategies in 
this RIA. It is important to note that the net climate forcing depends on the specific 
  
6-34 
combinations of emission reductions chosen to meet the proposed standards because of the 
differences in warming and cooling potential of the difference pollutants. 
6.6.1 Climate Effects of Short Lived Climate Forcers 
Pollutants that affect the energy balance of the earth are referred to as climate forcers. 
A pollutant that increases the amount of energy in the Earth’s climate system is said to exert 
“positive radiative forcing,” which leads to warming and climate change. In contrast, a pollutant 
that exerts negative radiative forcing reduces the amount of energy in the Earth’s system and 
leads to cooling. 
Long-lived gases such as CO2 differ from short-lived pollutants such as BC in the length 
of time they remain in the atmosphere affecting the earth’s energy balance. Long-lived gases 
remain in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. Short-lived climate forcers 
(SLCFs), in contrast, remain in the atmosphere for short periods of time ranging from days to 
weeks. The potential to affect near-term climate change and the rate of climate change with 
policies to address these emissions is gaining attention nationally and internationally (e.g., Black 
Carbon Report to Congress (currently undergoing peer review), Arctic Council Task Force, 
Global Methane Initiative, and Convention on Long-Range Trans-boundary Air Pollution of the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe). A recent United Nations Environmental 
Programme (UNEP) study provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the benefits of 
measures to reduce SLCFs including methane, ozone, and black carbon assessing the health, 
climate, and agricultural benefits of a suite of mitigation technologies. The report concludes 
that the climate is changing now, and these changes have the potential to “trigger abrupt 
transitions such as the release of carbon from thawing permafrost and biodiversity loss.” While 
reducing long-lived GHGs such as CO2 is necessary to protect against long-term climate change, 
reducing SLCF gases including BC and ozone is beneficial and will slow the rate of climate 
change within the first half of this century (UNEP, 2011). 
6.6.1.1 Climate Effects of Black Carbon 
Black carbon is the most strongly light-absorbing component of PM2.5, and is formed by 
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass. The short atmospheric lifetime of 
BC lasting from days to weeks and the mechanisms by which BC affects climate distinguish it 
from long-lived GHGs like CO2. This means that actions taken to reduce the BC constituents in 
direct PM2.5 will have almost immediate effects on climate change. Emissions sources and 
ambient concentrations of BC vary geographically and temporally resulting in climate effects 
that are more regionally and seasonally dependent than the effects of long-lived, well-mixed 
  
6-35 
GHGs. Likewise, mitigation actions for BC will produce different climate impacts depending on 
the region, season, and emission source category affected. 
BC influences climate in multiple ways: directly, indirectly, and through snow and ice 
albedo. Specifically, BC affects climate directly by absorbing both incoming and outgoing 
radiation of all wavelengths. In contrast, GHGs mainly trap outgoing infrared radiation from the 
earth’s surface. Per unit of mass in the atmosphere, BC can absorb a million times more energy 
than CO2 (Bond and Sun 2005). This strong absorptive capacity is the property most relevant to 
its potential to affect the Earth’s climate. BC also affects climate indirectly by altering the 
properties of clouds, affecting cloud reflectivity, precipitation, and surface dimming. These 
indirect impacts of BC are associated with all ambient particles and may lead to cooling, but are 
not associated with long-lived well mixed GHGs. Finally, when BC is deposited on snow and ice, 
it darkens the surface and decreases reflectivity, thereby increasing absorption and accelerating 
melting. 
The illustrative control strategies evaluated for this proposal include reductions in BC 
emissions that will tend to have a beneficial cooling effect on the atmosphere. BC and 
elemental carbon (EC) (or particulate elemental carbon (PEC)) are used interchangeably in this 
report because EPA traditionally estimates EC emissions rather than BC and for the purpose of 
this analysis these measures are essentially equivalent. Emissions reductions discussed below 
are from the modeled scenarios for each regulatory alterative, and not from the full attainment 
scenarios. This is because speciated PM2.5 data were not available for emissions reductions 
beyond known controls. 
The snow/ice albedo effects from BC deposition have been linked to accelerated snow 
and ice melting (Wiscombe and Warren, 1980). While many glaciers around the world and 
Arctic sea ice have receded in recent decades, determining whether this phenomenon is 
attributable to BC is challenging due to other contributing factors. Emissions north of the 40th 
parallel latitude are thought to be particularly important for BC’s climate related effects in the 
Arctic (Shindell, 2007; Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008). 
Snow and ice cover in the Western U.S. has also been affected by BC. Specifically, 
deposition of BC on mountain glaciers and snow packs produces a positive snow and ice albedo 
effect, contributing to the melting of snowpack earlier in the spring and reducing the amount of 
snowmelt that normally would occur later in the spring and summer (Hadley et al. 2010). This 
has implications for freshwater resources in regions of the U.S. dependent on snow-fed or 
glacier-fed water systems. In the Sierra Nevada mountain range, Hadley et al. (2010) found BC 
  
6-36 
at different depths in the snowpack, deposited over the winter months by snowfall. In the 
spring, the continuous uncovering of the BC contributed to the early melt. A model capturing 
the effects of soot on snow in the western U.S. shows significant decreases in snowpack 
between December and May (Qian et al., 2009). Snow water equivalent (the amount of water 
that would be produced by melting all the snow) is reduced 2-50 millimeters (mm) in 
mountainous areas, particularly over the Central Rockies, Sierra Nevadas, and western Canada. 
A study found that biomass burning emissions in Alaska and the Rocky Mountain region during 
the summer can enhance snowmelt. Dust deposition on snow, at high concentrations, can have 
similar effects to BC (Koch et al., 2007). Similarly, a study done by Painter et al. (2007) in the 
San Juan Mountains in Colorado indicated a decrease in snow cover duration of 18-35 days as a 
result of dust transported from non-local desert sources. National elemental carbon and 
organic carbon deposition maps are included in Appendix 6B to this report. 
6.6.1.2 Climate Effects of Nitrates, Sulfate, and Organic Carbon (excluding BC) 
The composition of the total emissions mixture is also relevant as to whether emissions 
are warming or cooling to the atmosphere. Pollutants such as SO2, NOX, and most OC particles 
tend to produce a cooling influence on climate. Exceptions include OC deposition on snow and 
ice, which leads to increased melting. 
In addition, it is important to account for the indirect effects of all PM constituents on 
climate: all aerosols (including BC) affect climate indirectly by changing the reflectivity and 
lifetime of clouds. The net indirect effect of all aerosols is very uncertain but is thought to be a 
net cooling influence. 
6.6.1.3 Climate Effects of Ozone 
Ozone changes due to this proposed regulation are not estimated for this analysis but 
may occur due to the NOx reductions estimated. Ozone is a well-known SLCF (U.S. EPA, 2006). 
Stratospheric ozone (the upper ozone layer) is beneficial because it protects life on Earth from 
the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In contrast, tropospheric ozone (ozone in the lower 
atmosphere) is a harmful air pollutant that adversely affects human health and the 
environment and contributes significantly to regional and global climate change. Due to its 
short atmospheric lifetime, tropospheric ozone concentrations exhibit large spatial and 
temporal variability (U.S. EPA, 2009). The discernable influence of ground level ozone on 
climate leads to increases in global surface temperature and changes in hydrological cycles. 
While reducing long-lived GHGs such as CO2 is necessary to protect against long-term climate 
  
6-37 
change, reducing SLCF gases including ozone is beneficial and will slow the rate of climate 
change within the first half of this century (UNEP, 2011). 
6.6.1.4 SLCFs Summary and Conclusions 
Assessing the net climate impact of SLCFs for the illustrative emission control strategies 
is outside the scope of this regulatory analysis and requires climate atmospheric modeling not 
undertaken due to time and resource constraints. Information about the amount of BC relative 
to non-BC constituents emitted from a source is important. In general, these non-BC 
constituents are emitted in greater volume than BC, counteracting the warming influence of BC. 
Qualitatively, it seems likely that BC emission reductions associated with direct emitted PM2.5 
controls will be beneficial for the climate in terms of reduced radiative forcing and deposition 
on snow and ice. Reductions in OC, sulfates and nitrates are likely to produce warming in the 
atmosphere. The indirect impacts of aerosols on clouds and precipitation remain the subject of 
great uncertainty making it more difficult to estimate the quantitative impact of aerosol 
reductions on climate. 
6.6.2 Climate Effects of Long-Lived Greenhouse Gases 
The importance of mitigating long-lived climate gases such as CO2 has been stressed by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007). While addressing short-lived 
climate forcers may result in more immediate climate benefits in specific areas, long-term 
policies must deal with long lived GHGs to address long-term climate change. We are unable to 
quantify the impact of the illustrative control strategies for this rulemaking on long-lived 
climate gases due lack of available data. However, State and Local governments may want to 
consider human health, welfare, and climate implications of regulatory strategies undertaken 
to implement the promulgated PM standards. 
6.7 Ecosystem Benefits and Services 
The effects of air pollution on the health and stability of ecosystems are potentially very 
important. At present, it is difficult to measure the impact of reducing air pollution in a national 
scale analysis across different types of ecosystems and different pollutant effects. Previous EPA 
science assessments (U.S. EPA, 2006a; U.S. EPA, 2008c; U.S. EPA, 2009b) have determined that 
air pollution can be directly linked to aquatic and terrestrial acidification, nutrient enrichment, 
vegetation injury, and metal bioaccumulation in animals. Ecosystem services are a useful 
conceptual framework for analyzing the impact of ecosystem changes on public welfare. 
  
6-38 
Ecosystem services can be generally defined as the benefits that individuals and 
organizations obtain from ecosystems. EPA has defined ecological goods and services as the 
“outputs of ecological functions or processes that directly or indirectly contribute to social 
welfare or have the potential to do so in the future. Some outputs may be bought and sold, but 
most are not marketed” (U.S. EPA, 2006c). Figure 6-7 provides the Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment’s schematic demonstrating the connections between the categories of ecosystem 
services and human well-being. The interrelatedness of these categories means that any one 
ecosystem may provide multiple services. Changes in these services can affect human well-
being by affecting security, health, social relationships, and access to basic material goods 
(MEA, 2005). 
 
Figure 6-7. Linkages between Categories of Ecosystem Services and Components of Human 
Well-Being from Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005) 
 
In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005), ecosystem services are classified 
into four main categories: 
1. Provisioning: Products obtained from ecosystems, such as the production of food 
and water 
2. Regulating: Benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes, such as 
the control of climate and disease 
3. Cultural: Nonmaterial benefits that people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual 
enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic 
experiences 
  
6-39 
4. Supporting: Services necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services, 
such as nutrient cycles and crop pollination 
The monetization of ecosystem services generally involves estimating the value of 
ecological goods and services based on what people are willing to pay (WTP) to increase 
ecological services or by what people are willing to accept (WTA) in compensation for 
reductions in them (U.S. EPA, 2006c). There are three primary approaches for estimating the 
monetary value of ecosystem services: market-based approaches, revealed preference 
methods, and stated preference methods (U.S. EPA, 2006c). Because economic valuation of 
ecosystem services can be difficult, nonmonetary valuation using biophysical measurements 
and concepts also can be used. An example of a nonmonetary valuation method is the use of 
relative-value indicators (e.g., a flow chart indicating uses of a water body, such as boatable, 
fishable, swimmable, etc.). It is necessary to recognize that in the analysis of the environmental 
responses associated with any particular policy or environmental management action, only a 
subset of the ecosystem services likely to be affected are readily identified. Of those ecosystem 
services that are identified, only a subset of the changes can be quantified. Within those 
services whose changes can be quantified, only a few will likely be monetized, and many will 
remain nonmonetized. The stepwise concept leading up to the valuation of ecosystems services 
is graphically depicted in Figure 6-8.

6.7.1 Ecosystem Benefits for Metallic and Organic Constituents of PM 
Several significant ecological effects are associated with deposition of chemical 
constituents of ambient PM such as metals and organics (U.S. EPA, 2009b). The trace metal 
constituents of PM include cadmium, copper, chromium, mercury, nickel, zinc, and lead. The 
organics include persistent organic pollutants (POPs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 
polybromiated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Exposure to PM for direct effects occur via deposition 
(e.g., wet, dry or occult) to vegetation surfaces, while indirect effects occur via deposition to 
ecosystem soils or surface waters where the deposited constituents of PM then interacts with 
biological organisms. While both fine and coarse-mode particles may affect plants and other 
organisms, more often the chemical constituents drive the ecosystem response to PM (Grantz 
et al., 2003). Ecological effects of PM include direct effects to metabolic processes of plant 
foliage; contribution to total metal loading resulting in alteration of soil biogeochemistry and 
microbiology, plant and animal growth and reproduction; and contribution to total organics 
loading resulting in bioaccumulation and biomagnification across trophic levels. 
The PM ISA concludes that a causal relationship is likely to exist between deposition of 
PM and a variety of effects on individual organisms and ecosystems (U.S. EPA 2009b). Most 
direct ecosystem effects associated with particulate pollution occur in severely polluted areas 
near industrial point sources (quarries, cement kilns, metal smelting) (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
However the PM ISA also finds, in many cases, it is difficult to characterize the nature and 
magnitude of effects and to quantify relationships between ambient concentrations of PM and 
ecosystem response due to significant data gaps and uncertainties as well as considerable 
variability that exists in the components of PM and their various ecological effects (U.S. EPA, 
2009b). 
Particulate matter can adversely impact plants and ecosystem services provided by 
plants by deposition to vegetative surfaces (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Particulates deposited on the 
surfaces of leaves and needles can block light, altering the radiation received by the plant. PM 
deposition near sources of heavy deposition can obstruct stomata limiting gas exchange, 
damage leaf cuticles and increase plant temperatures (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Plants growing on 
roadsides exhibit impact damage from near-road PM deposition, having higher levels of 
organics and heavy metals, and accumulate salt from road de-icing during winter months (U.S. 
EPA, 2009b). In addition, atmospheric PM can convert direct solar radiation to diffuse radiation, 
which is more uniformly distributed in a tree canopy, allowing radiation to reach lower leaves 
(U.S. EPA, 2009b). Decreases in crop yields (a provisioning service) due to reductions in solar 
  
6-41 
radiation have been attributed to regional scale air pollution in other counties with especially 
severe regional haze (Chameides et al., 1999). 
In addition to damage to plant surfaces, deposited PM can be taken up by plants from 
soil or foliage. Copper, zinc, and nickel have been shown to be directly toxic to vegetation under 
field conditions (U.S. EPA, 2009b). The ability of vegetation to take up heavy metals is 
dependent upon the amount, solubility and chemical composition of the deposited PM. Uptake 
of PM by plants from soils and vegetative surfaces can disrupt photosynthesis, alter pigments 
and mineral content, reduce plant vigor, decrease frost hardiness and impair root development. 
Particulate matter can also contain organic air toxic pollutants, including PAHs, which 
are a class of polycyclic organic matter (POM). PAHs can accumulate in sediments and 
bioaccumulate in freshwater, flora and fauna. The uptake of organics depends on the plant 
species, site of deposition, physical and chemical properties of the organic compound and 
prevailing environmental conditions (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Different species can have different 
uptake rates of PAHs. For example, zucchini (Cucurbita pepo) accumulated significantly more 
PAHs than related plant species (Parrish et al., 2006). PAHs can accumulate to high enough 
concentrations in some coastal environments to pose an environmental health threat that 
includes cancer in fish populations, toxicity to organisms living in the sediment and risks to 
those (e.g., migratory birds) that consume these organisms (Simcik et al., 1996; Simcik et al., 
1999). Atmospheric deposition of particles is thought to be the major source of PAHs to the 
sediments of Lake Michigan, Chesapeake Bay, Tampa Bay and other coastal areas of the U.S. 
(Arzavus, Dickhut, and Canuel, 2001). 
Contamination of plant leaves by heavy metals can lead to elevated concentrations in 
the soil. Trace metals absorbed into the plant, frequently bind to the leaf tissue, and then are 
lost when the leaf drops. As the fallen leaves decompose, the heavy metals are transferred into 
the soil (Cotrufo et al., 1995; Niklinska et al., 1998). Many of the major indirect plant responses 
to PM deposition are chiefly soil-mediated and depend on the chemical composition of 
individual components of deposited PM. Upon entering the soil environment, PM pollutants 
can alter ecological processes of energy flow and nutrient cycling, inhibit nutrient uptake to 
plants, change microbial community structure and, affect biodiversity. Accumulation of heavy 
metals in soils depends on factors such as local soil characteristics, geologic origin of parent 
soils, and metal bioavailability. Heavy metals, such as zinc, copper, and cadmium, and some 
pesticides can interfere with microorganisms that are responsible for decomposition of soil 
litter, an important regulating ecosystem service that serves as a source of soil nutrients (U.S. 
EPA, 2009b). Surface litter decomposition is reduced in soils having high metal concentrations. 
  
6-42 
Soil communities have associated bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates that are essential to soil 
nutrient cycling processes. Changes to the relative species abundance and community 
composition are associated with deposited PM to soil biota (U.S. EPA, 2009b). 
Atmospheric deposition can be the primary source of some organics and metals to 
watersheds. Deposition of PM to surfaces in urban settings increases the metal and organic 
component of storm water runoff (U.S. EPA, 2009b). This atmospherically-associated pollutant 
burden can then be toxic to aquatic biota. The contribution of atmospherically deposited PAHs 
to aquatic food webs was demonstrated in high elevation mountain lakes with no other 
anthropogenic contaminant sources (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Metals associated with PM deposition 
limit phytoplankton growth, affecting aquatic trophic structure. Long-range atmospheric 
transport of 47 pesticides and degradation products to the snowpack in seven national parks in 
the Western U.S. was recently quantified indicating PM-associated contaminant inputs to 
receiving waters during spring snowmelt (Hageman et al., 2006). 
The recently completed Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Project (WACAP) is 
the most comprehensive database on contaminant transport and PM depositional effects on 
sensitive ecosystems in the Western U.S. (Landers et al., 2008). In this project, the transport, 
fate, and ecological impacts of anthropogenic contaminants from atmospheric sources were 
assessed from 2002 to 2007 in seven ecosystem components (air, snow, water, sediment, 
lichen, conifer needles and fish) in eight core national parks. The study concluded that 
bioaccumulation of semi-volatile organic compounds occurred throughout park ecosystems, an 
elevational gradient in PM deposition exists with greater accumulation in higher altitude areas, 
and contaminants accumulate in proximity to individual agriculture and industry sources, which 
is counter to the original working hypothesis that most of the contaminants would originate 
from Eastern Europe and Asia. 
Although there is considerable data on impacts of PM on ecological receptors, few 
studies link ambient PM levels to observed effect. This is due, in part, to the nature, deposition, 
transport and fate of PM in ecosystems. Some of the difficulties in quantifying the ecosystem 
benefits associated with reduced PM deposition include the following: 
 PM is not a single pollutant, but a heterogeneous mixture of particles differing in 
size, origin and chemical composition. Since vegetation and other ecosystem 
components are affected more by particulate chemistry than size fraction, exposure 
to a given mass concentration of airborne PM may lead to widely differing plant or 
ecosystem responses, depending on the particular mix of deposited particles. 
  
6-43 
 Composition of ambient PM varies in time and space and the particulate mixture 
may have synergistic, antagonistic or additive effects on ecological receptors 
depending upon the chemical species present. 
 Presence of co-pollutants makes it difficult to attribute observed effects to 
ecological receptors to PM alone or one component of deposited PM. 
 Ecosystem effects linked to PM are difficult to determine because the changes may 
not be observed until pollutant deposition has occurred for many decades. 
Furthermore, many PM components bioaccumulate over time in organisms or 
plants, making correlations to ambient levels of PM difficult. 
 Multiple ecological stressors can confound attempts to link specific ecosystem 
responses to PM deposition. These stressors can be anthropogenic (e.g., habitat 
destruction, eutrophication, other pollutants) or natural (e.g., drought, fire, disease). 
Deposited PM interacts with other stressors to affect ecosystem patterns and 
processes. 
 Each ecosystem has a unique topography, underlying bedrock, soils, climate, 
meteorology, hydrologic regime, natural and land use history, and species 
composition. Sensitivity of ecosystem response can be highly variable in space and 
time. Because of this variety and lack of data for most ecosystems, extrapolating 
these effects from one ecosystem to another is highly uncertain. 
6.7.2 Ecosystem Benefits from Reductions in Nitrogen and Sulfur Emissions 
Emissions of the PM precursors, such as nitrogen and sulfur oxides occur over large 
regions of North America. Once these pollutants are lofted to the middle and upper 
troposphere, they typically have a much longer lifetime and, with the generally stronger winds 
at these altitudes, can be transported long distances from their source regions. The length scale 
of this transport is highly variable owing to differing chemical and meteorological conditions 
encountered along the transport path (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Secondary particles are formed from 
NOX and SO2 gaseous emissions and associated chemical reactions in the atmosphere. 
Deposition can occur in either a wet (i.e., rain, snow, sleet, hail, clouds, or fog) or dry form (i.e., 
gases or particles). Together these emissions are deposited onto terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems across the U.S., contributing to the problems of acidification, nutrient enrichment, 
and methylmercury production as represented in Figures 6-9 and 6-10. Although there is some 
evidence that nitrogen deposition may have positive effects on agricultural and forest output 
through passive fertilization, it is likely that the overall value is very small relative to other 
health and welfare effects. In addition to deposition effects, SO2 can affect vegetation at 
ambient levels near pollution sources.

The atmospheric lifetimes of particles vary with particle size. Accumulation-mode 
particles such as sulfates are kept in suspension by normal air motions and have a lower 
deposition velocity than coarse-mode particles; they can be transported thousands of 
kilometers and remain in the atmosphere for a number of days. They are removed from the 
atmosphere primarily by cloud processes. Particulates affect acid deposition by serving as cloud 
condensation nuclei and contribute directly to the acidification of rain. In addition, the gas-
phase species that lead to the dry deposition of acidity are also precursors of particles. 
Therefore, reductions in NOX and SO2 emissions will decrease both acid deposition and PM 
concentrations, but not necessarily in a linear fashion (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Sulfuric acid is also 
deposited on surfaces by dry deposition and can contribute to environmental effects (U.S. EPA, 
2008c). 
6.7.2.1 Ecological Effects of Acidification 
Deposition of nitrogen and sulfur can cause acidification, which alters biogeochemistry 
and affects animal and plant life in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across the U.S. Soil 
acidification is a natural process, but is often accelerated by acidifying deposition, which can 
decrease concentrations of exchangeable base cations in soils (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Major 
  
6-46 
terrestrial effects include a decline in sensitive tree species, such as red spruce (Picea rubens) 
and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Biological effects of acidification in 
terrestrial ecosystems are generally linked to aluminum toxicity and decreased ability of plant 
roots to take up base cations (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Decreases in the acid neutralizing capacity and 
increases in inorganic aluminum concentration contribute to declines in zooplankton, macro 
invertebrates, and fish species richness in aquatic ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2008c). 
Geology (particularly surficial geology) is the principal factor governing the sensitivity of 
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to acidification from nitrogen and sulfur deposition (U.S. 
EPA, 2008c). Geologic formations having low base cation supply generally underlie the 
watersheds of acid-sensitive lakes and streams. Other factors contribute to the sensitivity of 
soils and surface waters to acidifying deposition, including topography, soil chemistry, land use, 
and hydrologic flow path (U.S. EPA, 2008c). 
Aquatic Acidification. Aquatic effects of acidification have been well studied in the U.S. 
and elsewhere at various trophic levels. These studies indicate that aquatic biota have been 
affected by acidification at virtually all levels of the food web in acid sensitive aquatic 
ecosystems. The ISA for NOx/SOx—Ecological Criteria concluded that the evidence is sufficient 
to infer a causal relationship between acidifying deposition and effects on biogeochemistry 
related to aquatic ecosystems and biota in aquatic ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Effects have 
been most clearly documented for fish, aquatic insects, other invertebrates, and algae. 
Biological effects are primarily attributable to a combination of low pH and high inorganic 
aluminum concentrations. Such conditions occur more frequently during rainfall and snowmelt 
that cause high flows of water and less commonly during low-flow conditions, except where 
chronic acidity conditions are severe. Biological effects of episodes include reduced fish 
condition factor34, changes in species composition and declines in aquatic species richness 
across multiple taxa, ecosystems and regions. These conditions may also result in direct fish 
mortality (Van Sickle et al., 1996). Biological effects in aquatic ecosystems can be divided into 
two major categories: effects on health, vigor, and reproductive success; and effects on 
biodiversity. Surface water with ANC values greater than 50 μeq/L generally provides moderate 
protection for most fish (i.e., brook trout, others) and other aquatic organisms (U.S. EPA, 
2009c). Table 6-9 provides a summary of the biological effects experienced at various ANC 
levels. 
                                                     
34 Condition factor is an index that describes the relationship between fish weight and length, and is one measure 
of sublethal acidification stress that has been used to quantify effects of acidification on an individual fish (U.S. 
EPA, 2008f).

Near complete loss of fish populations is expected. Planktonic communities have

individuals in plankton species that are present is greatly reduced.

Fish species richness is greatly reduced (i.e., more than half of expected species 
can be missing). On average, brook trout populations experience sublethal 
effects, including loss of health, reproduction capacity, and fitness. Diversity and 
distribution of zooplankton communities decline. 
Moderate 
Concern 50–100 μeq/L 
Fish species richness begins to decline (i.e., sensitive species are lost from lakes). 
Brook trout populations are sensitive and variable, with possible sublethal 
effects. Diversity and distribution of zooplankton communities also begin to 
decline as species that are sensitive to acidifying deposition are affected. 
Low Concern >100 μeq/L 
Fish species richness may be unaffected. Reproducing brook trout populations 
are expected where habitat is suitable. Zooplankton communities are unaffected 
and exhibit expected diversity and distribution. 
 
A number of national and regional assessments have been conducted to estimate the 
distribution and extent of surface water acidity in the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2008c). As a result, several 
regions of the U.S. have been identified as containing a large number of lakes and streams that 
are seriously impacted by acidification. Figure 6-11 illustrates those areas of the U.S. where 
aquatic ecosystems are at risk from acidification. 
Because acidification primarily affects the diversity and abundance of aquatic biota, it 
also affects the ecosystem services that are derived from the fish and other aquatic life found in 
these surface waters. 
While acidification is unlikely to have serious negative effects on, for example, water 
supplies, it can limit the productivity of surface waters as a source of food (i.e., fish). In the 
northeastern United States, the surface waters affected by acidification are not a major source 
of commercially raised or caught fish; however, they are a source of food for some recreational 
and subsistence fishermen and for other consumers. For example, there is evidence that certain 
population subgroups in the northeastern United States, such as the Hmong and Chippewa 
ethnic groups, have particularly high rates of self-caught fish consumption (Hutchison and Kraft, 
1994; Peterson et al., 1994). However, it is not known if and how their consumption patterns 
are affected by the reductions in available fish populations caused by surface water 
acidification.

Inland surface waters support several cultural services, including aesthetic and 
educational services and recreational fishing. Recreational fishing in lakes and streams is among 
the most popular outdoor recreational activities in the northeastern United States. Based on 
studies conducted in the northeastern United States, Kaval and Loomis (2003) estimated 
average consumer surplus values per day of $36 for recreational fishing (in 2007 dollars); 
therefore, the implied total annual value of freshwater fishing in the northeastern United States 
was $5.1 billion in 2006.35 For recreation days, consumer surplus value is most commonly 
measured using recreation demand, travel cost models. 
Another estimate of the overarching ecological benefits associated with reducing lake 
acidification levels in Adirondacks National Park can be derived from the contingent valuation 
(CV) survey (Banzhaf et al., 2006), which elicited values for specific improvements in 
acidification-related water quality and ecological conditions in Adirondack lakes. The survey 
described a base version with minor improvements said to result from the program, and a

result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.

scope version with large improvements due to the program and a gradually worsening status 
quo. After adapting and transferring the results of this study and converting the 10-year annual 
payments to permanent annual payments using discount rates of 3% and 5%, the WTP 
estimates ranged from $48 to $107 per year per household (in 2004 dollars) for the base 
version and $54 to $154 for the scope version. Using these estimates, the aggregate annual 
benefits of eliminating all anthropogenic sources of NOx and SOx emissions were estimated to 
range from $291 million to $829 million (U.S. EPA, 2009c).36 
In addition, inland surface waters provide a number of regulating services associated 
with hydrological and climate regulation by providing environments that sustain aquatic food 
webs. These services are disrupted by the toxic effects of acidification on fish and other aquatic 
life. Although it is difficult to quantify these services and how they are affected by acidification, 
some of these services may be captured through measures of provisioning and cultural services. 
Terrestrial Acidification. Acidifying deposition has altered major biogeochemical 
processes in the U.S. by increasing the nitrogen and sulfur content of soils, accelerating nitrate 
and sulfate leaching from soil to drainage waters, depleting base cations (especially calcium and 
magnesium) from soils, and increasing the mobility of aluminum. Inorganic aluminum is toxic to 
some tree roots. Plants affected by high levels of aluminum from the soil often have reduced 
root growth, which restricts the ability of the plant to take up water and nutrients, especially 
calcium (U. S. EPA, 2008c). These direct effects can, in turn, influence the response of these 
plants to climatic stresses such as droughts and cold temperatures. They can also influence the 
sensitivity of plants to other stresses, including insect pests and disease (Joslin et al., 1992) 
leading to increased mortality of canopy trees. In the U.S., terrestrial effects of acidification are 
best described for forested ecosystems (especially red spruce and sugar maple ecosystems) 
with additional information on other plant communities, including shrubs and lichen (U.S. EPA, 
2008c). The ISA for NOx/SOx—Ecological Criteria concluded that the evidence is sufficient to 
infer a causal relationship between acidifying deposition and effects on biogeochemistry 
related to terrestrial ecosystems and biota in terrestrial ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2008c). 
Certain ecosystems in the continental U.S. are potentially sensitive to terrestrial 
acidification, which is the greatest concern regarding nitrogen and sulfur deposition U.S. EPA 
(2008c). Figure 6-12 depicts the areas across the U.S. that are potentially sensitive to terrestrial 
acidification.

result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.

Both coniferous and deciduous forests throughout the eastern U.S. are experiencing 
gradual losses of base cation nutrients from the soil due to accelerated leaching from acidifying 
deposition. This change in nutrient availability may reduce the quality of forest nutrition over 
the long term. Evidence suggests that red spruce and sugar maple in some areas in the eastern 
U.S. have experienced declining health because of this deposition. For red spruce, (Picea 
rubens) dieback or decline has been observed across high elevation landscapes of the 
northeastern U.S., and to a lesser extent, the southeastern U.S., and acidifying deposition has 
been implicated as a causal factor (DeHayes et al., 1999). Figure 6-13 shows the distribution of 
red spruce (brown) and sugar maple (green) in the eastern U.S. 
Terrestrial acidification affects several important ecological endpoints, including 
declines in habitat for threatened and endangered species (cultural), declines in forest 
aesthetics (cultural), declines in forest productivity (provisioning), and increases in forest soil 
erosion and reductions in water retention (cultural and regulating).

Forests in the northeastern United States provide several important and valuable 
provisioning services in the form of tree products. Sugar maples are a particularly important 
commercial hardwood tree species, providing timber and maple syrup. In the United States, 
sugar maple saw timber was nearly 900 million board feet in 2006 (USFS, 2006), and annual 
production of maple syrup was nearly 1.4 million gallons, accounting for approximately 19% of 
worldwide production. The total annual value of U.S. production in these years was 
approximately $160 million (NASS, 2008).37 Red spruce is also used in a variety of products 
including lumber, pulpwood, poles, plywood, and musical instruments. The total removal of red 
spruce saw timber from timberland in the United States was over 300 million board feet in 
2006 (USFS, 2006). 
Forests in the northeastern United States are also an important source of cultural 
ecosystem services—nonuse (i.e., existence value for threatened and endangered species),

recreational, and aesthetic services. Red spruce forests are home to two federally listed species 
and one delisted species: 
1. Spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga)—endangered 
2. Rock gnome lichen (Gymnoderma lineare)—endangered 
3. Virginia northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus)—delisted, but

Forestlands support a wide variety of outdoor recreational activities, including fishing, 
hiking, camping, off-road driving, hunting, and wildlife viewing. Regional statistics on 
recreational activities that are specifically forest based are not available; however, more 
general data on outdoor recreation provide some insights into the overall level of recreational 
services provided by forests. More than 30% of the U.S. adult population visited a wilderness or 
primitive area during the previous year and engaged in day hiking (Cordell et al., 2008). From 
1999 to 2004, 16% of adults in the northeastern United States participated in off-road vehicle 
recreation, for an average of 27 days per year (Cordell et al., 2005). The average consumer 
surplus value per day of off-road driving in the United States was $25 (in 2007 dollars), and the 
implied total annual value of off-road driving recreation in the northeastern United States was 
more than $9 billion (Kaval and Loomis, 2003). More than 5% of adults in the northeastern 
United States participated in nearly 84 million hunting days (U.S. FWS and U.S. Census Bureau, 
2007). Ten percent of adults in northeastern states participated in wildlife viewing away from 
home on 122 million days in 2006. For these recreational activities in the northeastern United 
States, Kaval and Loomis (2003) estimated average consumer surplus values per day of $52 for 
hunting and $34 for wildlife viewing (in 2007 dollars). The implied total annual value of hunting 
and wildlife viewing in the northeastern United States was, therefore, $4.4 billion and $4.2 
billion, respectively, in 2006 (U.S. EPA, 2009c).38 
As previously mentioned, it is difficult to estimate the portion of these recreational 
services that are specifically attributable to forests and to the health of specific tree species. 
However, one recreational activity that is directly dependent on forest conditions is fall color 
viewing. Sugar maple trees, in particular, are known for their bright colors and are, therefore, 
an essential aesthetic component of most fall color landscapes. A survey of residents in the 
Great Lakes area found that roughly 30% of residents reported at least one trip in the previous 
year involving fall color viewing (Spencer and Holecek, 2007). In a separate study conducted in 
                                                     
38 These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a 
result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.  
  
6-53 
Vermont, Brown (2002) reported that more than 22% of households visiting Vermont in 2001 
made the trip primarily for viewing fall colors. 
Two studies estimated values for protecting high-elevation spruce forests in the 
southern Appalachian Mountains. Kramer et al. (2003) conducted a contingent valuation study 
estimating households’ WTP for programs to protect remaining high-elevation spruce forests 
from damages associated with air pollution and insect infestation. Median household WTP was 
estimated to be roughly $29 (in 2007 dollars) for a smaller program, and $44 for the more 
extensive program. Jenkins et al. (2002) conducted a very similar study in seven Southern 
Appalachian states on a potential program to maintain forest conditions at status quo levels. 
The overall mean annual WTP for the forest protection programs was $208 (in 2007 dollars). 
Multiplying the average WTP estimate from these studies by the total number of households in 
the seven-state Appalachian region results in an aggregate annual range of $470 million to $3.4 
billion for avoiding a significant decline in the health of high-elevation spruce forests in the 
Southern Appalachian region (U.S. EPA, 2009c).39 
Forests in the northeastern United States also support and provide a wide variety of 
valuable regulating services, including soil stabilization and erosion control, water regulation, 
and climate regulation. The total value of these ecosystem services is very difficult to quantify 
in a meaningful way, as is the reduction in the value of these services associated with total 
nitrogen and sulfur deposition. As terrestrial acidification contributes to root damages, reduced 
biomass growth, and tree mortality, all of these services are likely to be affected; however, the 
magnitude of these impacts is currently very uncertain. 
6.7.2.2 Ecological Effects from Nitrogen Enrichment 
Aquatic Enrichment. The ISA for NOx/SOx—Ecological Criteria concluded that the 
evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between nitrogen deposition and the 
alteration of species richness, species composition, and biodiversity in wetland, freshwater 
aquatic and coastal marine ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2008c). 
One of the main adverse ecological effects resulting from nitrogen deposition, 
particularly in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, is the effect associated with nutrient 
enrichment in estuarine waters. A recent assessment of 141 estuaries nationwide by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded that 19 estuaries (13%) 
suffered from moderately high or high levels of eutrophication due to excessive inputs of both 
                                                     
39 These estimates reflect the marginal value of the service for the hypothetical program described in the survey, 
not the marginal change in the value of the service as a result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.

N and phosphorus, and a majority of these estuaries are located in the coastal area from North 
Carolina to Massachusetts (NOAA, 2007). For estuaries in the Mid-Atlantic region, the 
contribution of atmospheric distribution to total N loads is estimated to range between 10% 
and 58% (Valigura et al., 2001). 
Eutrophication in estuaries is associated with a range of adverse ecological effects. The 
conceptual framework developed by NOAA emphasizes four main types of eutrophication 
effects—low dissolved oxygen (DO), harmful algal blooms (HABs), loss of submerged aquatic 
vegetation (SAV), and low water clarity. Low DO disrupts aquatic habitats, causing stress to fish 
and shellfish, which, in the short-term, can lead to episodic fish kills and, in the long-term, can 
damage overall growth in fish and shellfish populations. Low DO also degrades the aesthetic 
qualities of surface water. In addition to often being toxic to fish and shellfish, and leading to 
fish kills and aesthetic impairments of estuaries, HABs can, in some instances, also be harmful 
to human health. SAV provides critical habitat for many aquatic species in estuaries and, in 
some instances, can also protect shorelines by reducing wave strength; therefore, declines in 
SAV due to nutrient enrichment are an important source of concern. Low water clarity is in part 
the result of accumulations of both algae and sediments in estuarine waters. In addition to 
contributing to declines in SAV, high levels of turbidity also degrade the aesthetic qualities of 
the estuarine environment. 
Estuaries in the eastern United States are an important source of food production, in 
particular fish and shellfish production. The estuaries are capable of supporting large stocks of 
resident commercial species, and they serve as the breeding grounds and interim habitat for 
several migratory species. To provide an indication of the magnitude of provisioning services 
associated with coastal fisheries, from 2005 to 2007, the average value of total catch was $1.5 
billion per year. It is not known, however, what percentage of this value is directly attributable 
to or dependent upon the estuaries in these states. 
In addition to affecting provisioning services through commercial fish harvests, 
eutrophication in estuaries may also affect the demand for seafood. For example, a well-
publicized toxic pfiesteria bloom in the Maryland Eastern Shore in 1997, which involved 
thousands of dead and lesioned fish, led to an estimated $56 million (in 2007 dollars) in lost 
seafood sales for 360 seafood firms in Maryland in the months following the outbreak (Lipton, 
1999). 
Estuaries in the United States also provide an important and substantial variety of 
cultural ecosystem services, including water-based recreational and aesthetic services. The 
  
6-55 
water quality in the estuary directly affects the quality of these experiences. For example, there 
were 26 million days of saltwater fishing coastal states from North Carolina to Massachusetts in 
2006 (FWA and Census, 2007). Assuming an average consumer surplus value for a fishing day at 
$36 (in 2007 dollars) in the Northeast and $87 in the Southeast (Kaval and Loomis, 2003), the 
aggregate value was approximately $1.3 billion (in 2007 dollars) (U.S. EPA, 2009c).40 In addition, 
almost 6 million adults participated in motorboating in coastal states from North Carolina to 
Massachusetts, for a total of nearly 63 million days annually during 1999–2000 (Leeworthy and 
Wiley, 2001). Using a national daily value estimate of $32 (in 2007 dollars) for motorboating 
(Kaval and Loomis (2003), the aggregate value of these coastal motorboating outings was $2 
billion per year (U.S. EPA, 2009c).41 Almost 7 million participated in birdwatching for 175 million 
days per year, and more than 3 million participated in visits to non-beach coastal waterside 
areas. 
Estuaries and marshes have the potential to support a wide range of regulating services, 
including climate, biological, and water regulation; pollution detoxification; erosion prevention; 
and protection against natural hazards from declines in SAV (MEA, 2005). SAV can help reduce 
wave energy levels and thus protect shorelines against excessive erosion, which increases the 
risks of episodic flooding and associated damages to near-shore properties or public 
infrastructure or even contribute to shoreline retreat. 
We are unable to provide an estimate of the aquatic enrichment benefits associated 
with the alternative standard level combinations due to data, time, and resource limitations. 
Terrestrial Enrichment. Terrestrial enrichment occurs when terrestrial ecosystems 
receive N loadings in excess of natural background levels, through either atmospheric 
deposition or direct application. Evidence presented in the Integrated Science Assessment (U.S. 
EPA, 2008c) supports a causal relationship between atmospheric N deposition and 
biogeochemical cycling and fluxes of N and carbon in terrestrial systems. Furthermore, 
evidence summarized in the report supports a causal link between atmospheric N deposition 
and changes in the types and number of species and biodiversity in terrestrial systems. 
Nitrogen enrichment occurs over a long time period; as a result, it may take as much as 50 
years or more to see changes in ecosystem conditions and indicators. This long time scale also 
affects the timing of the ecosystem service changes. The ISA for NOx/SOx—Ecological Criteria 
                                                     
40 These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a 
result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.

concluded that the evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between nitrogen 
deposition and the alteration of species richness, species composition, and biodiversity in 
terrestrial ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2008c). 
One of the main provisioning services potentially affected by N deposition is grazing 
opportunities offered by grasslands for livestock production in the Central U.S. Although N 
deposition on these grasslands can offer supplementary nutritive value and promote overall 
grass production, there are concerns that fertilization may favor invasive grasses and shift the 
species composition away from native grasses. This process may ultimately reduce the 
productivity of grasslands for livestock production. Losses due to invasive grasses can be 
significant; for example, based on a bioeconomic model of cattle grazing in the upper Great 
Plains, Leitch, Leistritz, and Bangsund (1996) and Leistritz, Bangsund, and Hodur (2004) 
estimated $130 million in losses due to a leafy spurge infestation in the Dakotas, Montana, and 
Wyoming.42 However, the contribution of N deposition to these losses is still uncertain. 
Terrestrial nutrient enrichment also affects cultural and regulating services. For 
example, in California, Coastal Sage Scrub (CSS) habitat concerns focus on a decline in CSS and 
an increase in nonnative grasses and other species, impacts on the viability of threatened and 
endangered species associated with CSS, and an increase in fire frequency. Changes in Mixed 
Conifer Forest (MCF) include changes in habitat suitability and increased tree mortality, 
increased fire intensity, and a change in the forest’s nutrient cycling that may affect surface 
water quality through nitrate leaching (U.S. EPA, 2008c). CSS and MCF are an integral part of 
the California landscape, and together the ranges of these habitats include the densely 
populated and valuable coastline and the mountain areas. Numerous threatened and 
endangered species at both the state and federal levels reside in CSS and MCF. The value that 
California residents and the U.S. population as a whole place on CSS and MCF habitats is 
reflected in the various federal, state, and local government measures that have been put in 
place to protect these habitats, including the Endangered Species Act, conservation planning 
programs, and private and local land trusts. CSS and MCF habitat are showcased in many 
popular recreation areas in California, including several national parks and monuments. In 
addition, millions of individuals are involved in fishing, hunting, and wildlife viewing in California 
every year (DOI, 2007). The quality of these trips depends in part on the health of the 
ecosystems and their ability to support the diversity of plants and animals found in important 
habitats found in CSS or MCF ecosystems and the parks associated with those ecosystems. 
                                                     
42 These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a 
result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.  
  
6-57 
Based on analyses in the NOx SOx REA average values of the total benefits in 2006 from fishing, 
hunting, and wildlife viewing away from home in California were approximately $950 million, 
$170 million, and $3.6 billion, respectively (U.S. EPA, 2009c).43 In addition, data from California 
State Parks (2003) indicate that in 2002, 69% of adult residents participated in trail hiking for an 
average of 24 days per year. The aggregate annual benefit for California residents from trail 
hiking in 2007 was $11 billion (U.S. EPA, 2009c).44 It is not currently possible to quantify the loss 
in value of services due to nitrogen deposition as those losses are already reflected in the 
estimates of the contemporaneous total value of these recreational activities. Restoration of 
services through decreases in nitrogen deposition would likely increase the total value of 
recreational services. 
Fire regulation is also an important regulating service that could be affected by nutrient 
enrichment of the CSS and MCF ecosystems by encouraging growth of more flammable grasses, 
increasing fuel loads, and altering the fire cycle. Over the 5-year period from 2004 to 2008, 
Southern California experienced, on average, over 4,000 fires per year burning, on average, 
over 400,000 acres per year (National Association of State Foresters [NASF], 2009). It is not 
possible at this time to quantify the contribution of nitrogen deposition, among many other 
factors, to increased fire risk. 
We are unable to provide an estimate of the terrestrial nutrient enrichment benefits 
associated with the alternative standard level combinations due to data, time, and resource 
limitations. Methods are not yet available to allow estimation of changes in ecosystem services 
due to nitrogen deposition. 
6.7.2.3 Vegetation Effects Associated with Gaseous Sulfur Dioxide 
Uptake of gaseous sulfur dioxide in a plant canopy is a complex process involving 
adsorption to surfaces (leaves, stems, and soil) and absorption into leaves. SO2 penetrates into 
leaves through to the stomata, although there is evidence for limited pathways via the cuticle 
(U.S. EPA, 2008c). Pollutants must be transported from the bulk air to the leaf boundary layer in 
order to get to the stomata. When the stomata are closed, as occurs under dark or drought 
conditions, resistance to gas uptake is very high and the plant has a very low degree of 
susceptibility to injury. In contrast, mosses and lichens do not have a protective cuticle barrier 
to gaseous pollutants or stomates and are generally more sensitive to gaseous sulfur and

nitrogen than vascular plants (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Acute foliar injury usually happens within hours 
of exposure, involves a rapid absorption of a toxic dose, and involves collapse or necrosis of 
plant tissues. Another type of visible injury is termed chronic injury and is usually a result of 
variable SO2 exposures over the growing season. Besides foliar injury, chronic exposure to low 
SO2 concentrations can result in reduced photosynthesis, growth, and yield of plants (U.S. EPA, 
2008c). These effects are cumulative over the season and are often not associated with visible 
foliar injury. As with foliar injury, these effects vary among species and growing environment. 
SO2 is also considered the primary factor causing the death of lichens in many urban and 
industrial areas (Hutchinson et al., 1996). The ISA for NOx/SOx—Ecological Criteria concluded 
that the evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between SO2 injury to vegetation 
(U.S. EPA, 2008c). 
6.7.2.4 Mercury-Related Benefits Associated with the Role of Sulfate in Mercury Methylation 
Mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative toxic metal that is emitted from in three forms: 
gaseous elemental Hg (Hg0), oxidized Hg compounds (Hg+2), and particle-bound Hg (HgP). 
Methylmercury (MeHg) is formed by microbial action in the top layers of sediment and soils, 
after Hg has precipitated from the air and deposited into waterbodies or land. Once formed, 
MeHg is taken up by aquatic organisms and bioaccumulates up the aquatic food web. Larger 
predatory fish may have MeHg concentrations many times, typically on the order of one million 
times, that of the concentrations in the freshwater body in which they live. 
The NOx SOx ISA—Ecological Criteria concluded that evidence is sufficient to infer a 
causal relationship between sulfur deposition and increased mercury methylation in wetlands 
and aquatic environments (U.S. EPA, 2008c). Specifically, there appears to be a relationship 
between SO42- deposition and mercury methylation; however, the rate of mercury methylation 
varies according to several spatial and biogeochemical factors whose influence has not been 
fully quantified (see Figure 6-14). Therefore, the correlation between SO42- deposition and 
MeHg could not be quantified for the purpose of interpolating the association across 
waterbodies or regions. Nevertheless, because changes in MeHg in ecosystems represent 
changes in significant human and ecological health risks, the association between sulfur and 
mercury cannot be neglected (U.S. EPA, 2008c). 
  
6-59 
 
Figure 6-14. Spatial and Biogeochemical Factors Influencing MeHg Production 
 
As research evolves and the computational capacity of models expands to meet the 
complexity of mercury methylation processes in ecosystems, the role of interacting factors may 
be better parsed out to identify ecosystems or regions that are more likely to generate higher 
concentrations of MeHg. Figure 6-15 illustrates the type of current and forward-looking 
research being developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to synthesize the contributing 
factors of mercury and to develop a map of sensitive watersheds. The mercury score 
referenced in Figure 6-15 is based on SO42- concentrations, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), 
levels of dissolved organic carbon and pH, mercury species concentrations, and soil types to 
gauge the methylation sensitivity (Myers et al., 2007). 
  
6-60

Source: Myers et al., 2007 
Interdependent biogeochemical factors preclude the existence of simple sulfate-related 
mercury methylation models. It is clear that decreasing sulfate deposition is likely to result in 
decreased MeHg concentrations. Future research may allow for the characterization of a usable 
sulfate-MeHg response curve; however, no regional or classification calculation scale can be 
created at this time because of the number of confounding factors. 
Decreases in SO42- deposition have already shown promising reductions in MeHg. 
Observed decreases in MeHg fish tissue concentrations have been linked to decreased 
acidification and declining SO42- and mercury deposition in Little Rock Lake, WI (Hrabik and 
Watras, 2002), and to decreased SO42- deposition in Isle Royale in Lake Superior, MI (Drevnick et 
al., 2007). Although the possibility exists that reductions in SO42- emissions could generate a 
pulse in MeHg production because of decreased sulfide inhibition in sulfate-saturated waters, 
this effect would likely involve a limited number of U.S. waters (Harmon et al., 2007). Also, 
because of the diffusion and outward flow of both mercury-sulfide complexes and SO42-, 
increased mercury methylation downstream may still occur in sulfate-enriched ecosystems with 
increased organic matter and/or downstream transport capabilities. 
  
6-61 
Remediation of sediments heavily contaminated with mercury has yielded significant 
reductions of MeHg in biotic tissues. Establishing quantitative relations in biotic responses to 
MeHg levels as a result of changes in atmospheric mercury deposition, however, presents 
difficulties because direct associations can be confounded by all of the factors discussed in this 
section. Current research does suggest that the levels of MeHg and total mercury in ecosystems 
are positively correlated, so that reductions in mercury deposited into ecosystems would also 
eventually lead to reductions in MeHg in biotic tissues. Ultimately, an integrated approach that 
involves the reduction of both sulfur and mercury emissions may be most efficient because of 
the variability in ecosystem responses. Reducing SOX emissions could have a beneficial effect on 
levels of MeHg in many waters of the United States. 
MeHg is the only form of mercury that biomagnifies in the food web. Concentrations of 
MeHg in fish are generally on the order of a million times the MeHg concentration in water. In 
addition to mercury deposition, key factors affecting MeHg production and accumulation in fish 
include the amount and forms of sulfur and carbon species present in a given waterbody. Thus, 
two adjoining water bodies receiving the same deposition can have significantly different fish 
mercury concentrations. 
Methylmercury builds up more in some types of fish and shellfish than in others. The 
levels of methylmercury in high and shellfish vary widely depending on what they eat, how long 
they live, and how high they are in the food chain. Most fish, including ocean species and local 
freshwater fish, contain some methylmercury. In general, higher mercury concentrations are 
expected in top predators, which are often large fish relative to other species in a waterbody. 
The ecosystem service most directly affected by sulfate-mediated mercury methylation 
is the provision of fish for consumption as a food source. This service is of particular importance 
to groups engaged in subsistence fishing, pregnant women and young children. 
6.7.3 Ecosystem Benefits from Reductions in Mercury Emissions 
Deposition of mercury to waterbodies can also have an impact on ecosystems and 
wildlife. Mercury contamination is present in all environmental media with aquatic systems 
experiencing the greatest exposures due to bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation refers to the net 
uptake of a contaminant from all possible pathways and includes the accumulation that may 
occur by direct exposure to contaminated media as well as uptake from food. 
Atmospheric mercury enters freshwater ecosystems by direct deposition and through 
runoff from terrestrial watersheds. Once mercury deposits, it may be converted to organic 
  
6-62 
methylmercury mediated primarily by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Methylation is enhanced in 
anaerobic and acidic environments, greatly increasing mercury toxicity and potential to 
bioaccumulate in aquatic foodwebs. A number of key biogeochemical controls influence the 
production of methylmercury in aquatic ecosystems. These include sulfur, pH, organic matter, 
iron, mercury “aging,” and bacteria type and activity (Munthe et al., 2007). 
Wet and dry deposition of oxidized mercury is a dominant pathway for bringing mercury 
to terrestrial surfaces. In forest ecosystems, elemental mercury may also be absorbed by plants 
stomatally, incorporated by foliar tissues and released in litterfall (Ericksen et al., 2003). 
Mercury in throughfall, direct deposition in precipitation, and uptake of dissolved mercury by 
roots (Rea et al., 2002) are also important in mercury accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems. 
Soils have significant capacity to store large quantities of atmospherically deposited 
mercury where it can leach into groundwater and surface waters. The risk of mercury exposure 
extends to insectivorous terrestrial species such as songbirds, bats, spiders, and amphibians 
that receive mercury deposition or from aquatic systems near the forest areas they inhabit 
(Bergeron et al., 2010a, b; Cristol et al., 2008; Rimmer et al., 2005; Wada et al., 2009 & 2010). 
Numerous studies have generated field data on the levels of mercury in a variety of wild 
species. Many of the data from these environmental studies are anecdotal in nature rather than 
representative or statistically designed studies. The body of work examining the effects of these 
exposures is growing but still incomplete given the complexities of the natural world. A large 
portion of the adverse effect research conducted to date has been carried out in the laboratory 
setting rather than in the wild; thus, conclusions about overarching ecosystem health and 
population effects are difficult to make at this time. In the sections that follow numerous 
effects have been identified at differing exposure levels. 
6.7.3.1 Mercury Effects on Fish 
A review of the literature on effects of mercury on fish (Crump and Trudeau, 2009) 
reports results for numerous species including trout, bass (large and smallmouth), northern 
pike, carp, walleye, salmon and others from laboratory and field studies. The effects studied are 
reproductive and include deficits in sperm and egg formation, histopathological changes in 
testes and ovaries, and disruption of reproductive hormone synthesis. These studies were 
conducted in areas from New York to Washington and while many were conducted by adding 
MeHg to water or diet many were conducted at current environmental levels. While we cannot 
determine at this time whether these reproductive deficits are affecting fish populations across 
the United States it should be noted that it is possible that over time reproductive deficits could 
  
6-63 
have an effect on populations. Lower fish populations would conceivably impact the ecosystem 
services like recreational fishing derived from having healthy aquatic ecosystems quite apart 
from the effects of consumption advisories due to the human health effects of mercury. 
6.7.3.2 Mercury Effects on Birds 
In addition to effects on fish, mercury also affects avian species. In previous reports (U.S. 
EPA (1997); U.S. EPA (2005)), much of the focus has been on large piscivorous species in 
particular the common loon. The loon is most visible to the public during the summer breeding 
season on northern lakes and they have become an important symbol of wilderness in these 
areas (McIntyre and Barr, 1997). A multitude of loon watch, preservation, and protection 
groups have formed over the past few decades and have been instrumental in promoting 
conservation, education, monitoring, and research of breeding loons (McIntyre and Evers, 
2000; Evers, 2006). Significant adverse effects on breeding loons from mercury have been 
found to occur including behavioral (reduced nest-sitting), physiological (flight feather 
asymmetry) and reproductive (chicks fledged/territorial pair) effects (Evers, 2008). Additionally 
Evers, et al (2008) report that they believe that the weight of evidence indicates that 
population-level effects occur in parts of Maine and New Hampshire, and potentially in broad 
areas of the loon’s range. 
Recently attention has turned to other piscivorous species such as the white ibis, and 
great snowy egret. While considered to be fish-eating generally these wading birds have a very 
wide diet including crayfish, crabs, snails, insects and frogs. These species are experiencing a 
range of adverse effects due to exposure to mercury. The white ibis has been observed to have 
decreased foraging efficiency (Adams and Frederick, 2008). Additionally ibises have been shown 
to exhibit decreased reproductive success and altered pair behavior (Frederick and Jayasena, 
2010). These effects include significantly more unproductive nests, male/male pairing, reduced 
courtship behavior (head bobbing and pair bowing) and lower nestling production by exposed 
males. In this study, a worst-case scenario suggested by the results could involve up to a 50% 
reduction in fledglings due to MeHg in diet. These estimates may be conservative if male/male 
pairing in the wild it could result in a shortage of partners for females and the effect of 
homosexual breeding would be magnified. In egrets, mercury has been implicated in the 
decline of the species in south Florida (Sepulveda, et al., 1999) and Hoffman (2010) has shown 
that egrets show liver and possibly kidney effects. While ibises and egrets are most abundant in 
coastal areas and these studies were conducted in south Florida and Nevada the ranges of 
ibises and egrets extend to a large portion of the United States. Ibis territory can range inland 
  
6-64 
to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee. Egret range covers virtually the entire United States 
except the mountain west. 
Insectivorous birds have also been shown to suffer adverse effects due to mercury 
exposure. These songbirds such as Bicknell’s thrush, tree swallows and the great tit have shown 
reduced reproduction, survival, and changes in singing behavior. Exposed tree swallows 
produced fewer fledglings (Brasso, 2008), lower survival (Hallinger, 2010) and had 
compromised immune competence (Hawley, 2009). The great tit has exhibited reduced singing 
behavior and smaller song repertoire in an area of high contamination in the vicinity of a 
metallurgic smelter in Flanders (Gorissen, 2005). 
6.7.3.3 Mercury Effects on Mammals 
In mammals, adverse effects have been observed in mink and river otter, both fish 
eating species. For otter from Maine and Vermont maximum concentrations on Hg in fur nearly 
equal or exceed a concentration associated with mortality and concentration in liver for mink in 
Massachusetts/Connecticut and the levels in fur from mink in Maine exceed concentrations 
associated with acute mortality (Yates, 2005). Adverse sublethal effects may be associated with 
lower Hg concentrations and consequently be more widespread than potential acute effects. 
These effects may include increased activity, poorer maze performance, abnormal startle reflex, 
and impaired escape and avoidance behavior (Scheuhammer et al., 2007). 
6.7.3.4 Mercury Ecological Conclusions 
The studies cited here provide a glimpse of the scope of mercury effects on wildlife 
particularly reproductive and survival effects. These effects range across species from fish to 
mammals and spatially across a wide area of the United States. The literature is far from 
complete however. Much more research is required to establish a link between the ecological 
effects on wildlife and the effect on ecosystem services (services that the environment provides 
to people) for example recreational fishing, bird watching and wildlife viewing. EPA is not, 
however, currently able to quantify or monetize the benefits of reducing mercury exposures 
affecting provision of ecosystem services. 
6.7.4 Vegetation Benefits from Reductions in Ambient Ozone 
Control strategies that include emission reductions of NOx would affect ambient ozone 
concentrations. Ozone causes discernible injury to a wide array of vegetation (U.S. EPA, 2006a; 
Fox and Mickler, 1996). Air pollution can affect the environment and affect ecological systems, 
leading to changes in the ecological community and influencing the diversity, health, and vigor 
  
6-65 
of individual species (U.S. EPA, 2006a). In terms of forest productivity and ecosystem diversity, 
ozone may be the pollutant with the greatest potential for regional-scale forest impacts (U.S. 
EPA, 2006a). Studies have demonstrated repeatedly that ozone concentrations commonly 
observed in polluted areas can have substantial impacts on plant function (De Steiguer et al., 
1990; Pye, 1988). 
When ozone is present in the air, it can enter the leaves of plants, where it can cause 
significant cellular damage. Like carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gaseous substances, ozone 
enters plant tissues primarily through the stomata in leaves in a process called “uptake” 
(Winner and Atkinson, 1986). Once sufficient levels of ozone (a highly reactive substance), or its 
reaction products, reaches the interior of plant cells, it can inhibit or damage essential cellular 
components and functions, including enzyme activities, lipids, and cellular membranes, 
disrupting the plant’s osmotic (i.e., water) balance and energy utilization patterns (U.S. EPA, 
2006a; Tingey and Taylor, 1982). With fewer resources available, the plant reallocates existing 
resources away from root growth and storage, above ground growth or yield, and reproductive 
processes, toward leaf repair and maintenance, leading to reduced growth and/or 
reproduction. Studies have shown that plants stressed in these ways may exhibit a general loss 
of vigor, which can lead to secondary impacts that modify plants’ responses to other 
environmental factors. Specifically, plants may become more sensitive to other air pollutants, 
or more susceptible to disease, pest infestation, harsh weather (e.g., drought, frost) and other 
environmental stresses, which can all produce a loss in plant vigor in ozone-sensitive species 
that over time may lead to premature plant death. Furthermore, there is evidence that ozone 
can interfere with the formation of mycorrhiza, essential symbiotic fungi associated with the 
roots of most terrestrial plants, by reducing the amount of carbon available for transfer from 
the host to the symbiont (U.S. EPA, 2006a). 
This ozone damage may or may not be accompanied by visible injury on leaves, and 
likewise, visible foliar injury may or may not be a symptom of the other types of plant damage 
described above. Foliar injury is usually the first visible sign of injury to plants from ozone 
exposure and indicates impaired physiological processes in the leaves (Grulke, 2003). When 
visible injury is present, it is commonly manifested as chlorotic or necrotic spots, and/or 
increased leaf senescence (accelerated leaf aging). Visible foliar injury reduces the aesthetic 
value of ornamental vegetation and trees in urban landscapes and negatively affects scenic 
vistas in protected natural areas. 
Ozone can produce both acute and chronic injury in sensitive species depending on the 
concentration level and the duration of the exposure. Ozone effects also tend to accumulate 
  
6-66 
over the growing season of the plant, so that even lower concentrations experienced for a 
longer duration have the potential to create chronic stress on sensitive vegetation. Not all 
plants, however, are equally sensitive to ozone. Much of the variation in sensitivity between 
individual plants or whole species is related to the plant’s ability to regulate the extent of gas 
exchange via leaf stomata (e.g., avoidance of ozone uptake through closure of stomata) and the 
relative ability of species to detoxify ozone-generated reactive oxygen free radicals (U.S. EPA, 
2006a; Winner, 1994). After injuries have occurred, plants may be capable of repairing the 
damage to a limited extent (U.S. EPA, 2006a). Because of the differing sensitivities among 
plants to ozone, ozone pollution can also exert a selective pressure that leads to changes in 
plant community composition. Given the range of plant sensitivities and the fact that numerous 
other environmental factors modify plant uptake and response to ozone, it is not possible to 
identify threshold values above which ozone is consistently toxic for all plants. 
Because plants are at the base of the food web in many ecosystems, changes to the 
plant community can affect associated organisms and ecosystems (including the suitability of 
habitats that support threatened or endangered species and below ground organisms living in 
the root zone). Ozone impacts at the community and ecosystem level vary widely depending 
upon numerous factors, including concentration and temporal variation of tropospheric ozone, 
species composition, soil properties and climatic factors (U.S. EPA, 2006a). In most instances, 
responses to chronic or recurrent exposure in forested ecosystems are subtle and not 
observable for many years. These injuries can cause stand-level forest decline in sensitive 
ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2006a, McBride et al., 1985; Miller et al., 1982). It is not yet possible to 
predict ecosystem responses to ozone with certainty; however, considerable knowledge of 
potential ecosystem responses is available through long-term observations in highly damaged 
forests in the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2006a). 
6.7.4.1 Ozone Effects on Forests 
Air pollution can affect the environment and affect ecological systems, leading to 
changes in the ecological community and influencing the diversity, health, and vigor of 
individual species (U.S. EPA, 2006a). Ozone has been shown in numerous studies to have a 
strong effect on the health of many plants, including a variety of commercial and ecologically 
important forest tree species throughout the United States (U.S. EPA, 2007b). 
In the U.S., this data comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest 
Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. As part of its Phase 3 program (formerly 
known as Forest Health Monitoring), FIA looks for visible foliar injury of ozone-sensitive forest 
plant species at each ground monitoring site across the country (excluding woodlots and urban 
  
6-67 
trees) that meets certain minimum criteria. Because ozone injury is cumulative over the course 
of the growing season, examinations are conducted in July and August, when ozone 
concentrations and associated injury are typically highest. 
Monitoring of ozone injury to plants by the U.S. Forest Service has expanded over the 
last 15 years from monitoring sites in 10 states in 1994 to nearly 1,000 monitoring sites in 41 
states in 2002. Since 2002, the monitoring program has further expanded to 1,130 monitoring 
sites in 45 states. Figure 6-16 shows the results of this monitoring program for the year 2002 
broken down by U.S. EPA Regions.45 Figure 6-17 identifies the counties that were included in 
Figure 6-16, and provides the county-level data regarding the presence or absence of ozone-
related injury. As shown in Figure 6-16, large geographic areas of EPA Regions 6, 8, and 10 were 
not included in the assessment. Ozone damage to forest plants is classified using a subjective 
five-category biosite index based on expert opinion, but designed to be equivalent from site to 
site. Ranges of biosite values translate to no injury, low or moderate foliar injury (visible foliar 
injury to highly sensitive or moderately sensitive plants, respectively), and high or severe foliar 
injury, which would be expected to result in tree-level or ecosystem-level responses, 
respectively (U.S. EPA, 2006a; Coulston, 2004). The highest percentages of observed high and 
severe foliar injury, which are most likely to be associated with tree or ecosystem-level 
responses, are primarily found in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. While the assessment 
showed considerable regional variation in ozone injury, this assessment targeted different 
ozone-sensitive species in different parts of the country with varying ozone sensitivity, which 
contributes to the apparent regional differences. It is important to note that ozone can have 
other, more significant impacts on forest plants (e.g., reduced biomass growth in trees) prior to 
showing signs of visible foliar injury (U.S. EPA, 2006a). 
Assessing the impact of ground-level ozone on forests in the U.S. involves understanding 
the risks to sensitive tree species from ambient ozone concentrations and accounting for the 
prevalence of those species within the forest. As a way to quantify the risks to particular plants 
from ground-level ozone, scientists have developed ozone-exposure/tree-response functions by 
exposing tree seedlings to different ozone levels and measuring reductions in growth as 
“biomass loss.” Typically, seedlings are used because they are easy to manipulate and measure 
their growth loss from ozone pollution. The mechanisms of susceptibility to ozone within the 
leaves of seedlings and mature trees are identical, and the decreases predicted using the 
seedlings should be related to the decrease in overall plant fitness for mature trees, but the 
                                                     
45 The data are based on averages of all observations collected in 2002, which is the last year for which data are 
publicly available. For more information, please consult EPA’s 2008 Report on the Environment (U.S. EPA, 
2008b).

c Degree of Injury: These categories reflect a subjective index based on expert opinion. Ozone can have other, 
more significant impacts on forest plants (e.g., reduced biomass growth in trees) prior to showing signs of visible 
foliar injury.

magnitude of the effect may be higher or lower depending on the tree species (Chappelka and 
Samuelson, 1998). In areas where certain ozone-sensitive species dominate the forest 
community, the biomass loss from ozone can be significant. Experts have identified 2% annual 
biomass loss as a level of concern, which would cause long term ecological harm as the short-
term negative effects on seedlings compound to affect long-term forest health (Heck and 
Cowling, 1997). 
Ozone damage to the plants including the trees and understory in a forest can affect the 
ability of the forest to sustain suitable habitat for associated species particularly threatened and 
endangered species that have existence value—a nonuse ecosystem service—for the public. 
Similarly, damage to trees and the loss of biomass can affect the forest’s provisioning services 
in the form of timber for various commercial uses. In addition, ozone can cause discoloration of 
leaves and more rapid senescence (early shedding of leaves), which could negatively affect fall-
color tourism because the fall foliage would be less available or less attractive. Beyond the 
aesthetic damage to fall color vistas, forests provide the public with many other recreational 
and educational services that may be affected by reduced forest health including hiking, wildlife 
  
6-70 
viewing (including bird watching), camping, picnicking, and hunting. Another potential effect of 
biomass loss in forests is the subsequent loss of climate regulation service in the form of 
reduced ability to sequester carbon and alteration of hydrologic cycles. 
Some of the common tree species in the United States that are sensitive to ozone are 
black cherry (Prunus serotina), tulip-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and eastern white pine 
(Pinus strobus). Ozone-exposure/tree-response functions have been developed for each of 
these tree species, as well as for aspen (Populus tremuliodes), and ponderosa pine (Pinus 
ponderosa) (U.S. EPA, 2007b). 
6.7.4.2 Ozone Effects on Crops 
Laboratory and field experiments have shown reductions in yields for agronomic crops 
exposed to ozone, including vegetables (e.g., lettuce) and field crops (e.g., cotton and wheat). 
Damage to crops from ozone exposures includes yield losses (i.e., in terms of weight, number, 
or size of the plant part that is harvested), as well as changes in crop quality (i.e., physical 
appearance, chemical composition, or the ability to withstand storage) (U.S. EPA, 2007b). The 
most extensive field experiments, conducted under the National Crop Loss Assessment 
Network (NCLAN) examined 15 species and numerous cultivars. The NCLAN results show that 
“several economically important crop species are sensitive to ozone levels typical of those 
found in the United States” (U.S. EPA, 2006a). In addition, economic studies have shown 
reduced economic benefits as a result of predicted reductions in crop yields, directly affecting 
the amount and quality of the provisioning service provided by these crops, associated with 
observed ozone levels (Kopp et al., 1985; Adams et al., 1986; Adams et al., 1989). In addition, 
visible foliar injury by itself can reduce the market value of certain leafy crops (such as spinach, 
lettuce). According to the Ozone Staff Paper, there has been no evidence that crops are 
becoming more tolerant of ozone (U.S. EPA, 2007b). Using the Agriculture Simulation Model 
(AGSIM) (Taylor, 1994) to calculate the agricultural benefits of reductions in ozone exposure, 
U.S. EPA estimated that attaining a W126 standard of 13 ppm-hr would produce monetized 
benefits of approximately $400 million to $620 million in 2006 (inflated to 2006 dollars) (U.S. 
EPA, 2007b).46 
                                                     
46 These estimates illustrate the value of vegetation effects from a substantial reduction of ozone concentrations, 
not the marginal change in ozone concentrations anticipated a result of the emission reductions achieved by 
this rule.

6.7.4.3 Ozone Effects on Ornamental Plants 
Urban ornamental plants are an additional vegetation category likely to experience 
some degree of negative effects associated with exposure to ambient ozone levels. Several 
ornamental species have been listed as sensitive to ozone (Abt Associates, 1995). Because 
ozone causes visible foliar injury, the aesthetic value of ornamental plants (such as petunia, 
geranium, and poinsettia) in urban landscapes would be reduced (U.S. EPA, 2007b). Sensitive 
ornamental species would require more frequent replacement and/or increased maintenance 
(fertilizer or pesticide application) to maintain the desired appearance because of exposure to 
ambient ozone (U.S. EPA, 2007b). In addition, many businesses rely on healthy-looking 
vegetation for their livelihoods (e.g., horticulturalists, landscapers, Christmas tree growers, 
farmers of leafy crops, etc.). The ornamental landscaping industry is a multi-billion dollar 
industry that affects both private property owners/tenants and governmental units responsible 
for public areas (Abt Associates, 1995). Preliminary data from the 2007 Economic Census 
indicate that the landscaping services industry, which is primarily engaged in providing 
landscape care and maintenance services and installing trees, shrubs, plants, lawns, or gardens, 
was valued at $53 billion (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Therefore, urban ornamentals represent a 
potentially large unquantified benefit category. This aesthetic damage may affect the 
enjoyment of urban parks by the public and homeowners’ enjoyment of their landscaping and 
gardening activities. In addition, homeowners may experience a reduction in home value or a 
home may linger on the market longer due to decreased aesthetic appeal. In the absence of 
adequate exposure-response functions and economic damage functions for the potential range 
of effects relevant to ornamental plants, we cannot conduct a quantitative analysis to estimate 
these effects. 
We are unable to provide an estimate of the ozone crop benefits associated with the 
alternative standard level combinations due to data, time, and resource limitations.

APPENDIX 6.A 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THE VISIBILITY BENEFITS METHODOLOGY 
6.A.1 Introduction 
Economic benefits may result from two broad categories of changes in light extinction: 
(1) changes in “residential” visibility—i.e., the visibility in and around the locations where 
people live; and (2) changes in “recreational” visibility at Class I areas—i.e., visibility at Class I 
national parks and wilderness areas.1 In this analysis, only those recreational and residential 
benefits in areas that have been directly studied in the valuation literature are included in the 
primary presentation of benefits; recreational benefits in other U.S. Class I regions and 
residential benefits in other metropolitan areas are presented as sensitivity analyses of visibility 
benefits. 
In Chapter 6 of this RIA, we provide an overview of the visibility benefits methodology 
and results. This appendix provides additional detail regarding specific aspects of the visibility 
benefits methodology and is organized as follows. Section 6.A.2 describes the process we used 
to convert the modeled light extinction data to match the spatial scale of the visibility benefits 
assessment. We present the basic utility model in Section 6.A.3. In Section 6.A.4 we discuss the 
measurement of visibility, and the mapping from environmental “bads” to environmental 
“goods.” In Sections 6.A.5 and 6.A.6 we summarize the methodology for estimating the 
parameters of the model corresponding to visibility at in-region and out-of-region Class I areas, 
and visibility in residential areas, respectively, and we describe the methods used to estimate 
these parameters. Section 6.A.7 describes the process for aggregating the recreational and 
residential visibility benefits. Section 6.A.8 describes the adjustment to reflect income growth 
over time. Section 6.A.9 provides all the parameters used to calculate visibility benefits. 
6.A.2 Converting Modeled Light Extinction Estimates 
To calculate visibility benefits, we use light extinction estimates generated by the CMAQ 
model.2 Modeled light extinction estimates are measured in units of inverse megameters 
(Mm-1). Because the valuation studies measure visibility in terms of visual range, we convert the 
light extinction units from Mm-1 to visual range (in km) for both recreational and residential 
                                                     
1 Hereafter referred to as Class I areas, which are defined as areas of the country such as national parks, national 
wilderness areas, and national monuments that have been set aside under Section 169(a) of the Clean Air Act 
to receive the most stringent degree of air quality protection. Class I federal lands fall under the jurisdiction of 
three federal agencies, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Forest Service.

this RIA.

visibility benefits. Using the relationships derived by Pitchford and Malm (1994), the formulas 
for this conversion are 
 𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠 = 10 ∗ ln �391
𝑉𝑅
� = 10 ∗ ln �βext
10
�  
where VR denotes visual range (in kilometers) and βext denotes light extinction (in Mm-1). 
Because we leverage the tools and data prepared for previous analyses (U.S. EPA, 2011), we use 
a two-step process to convert from Mm-1 to VR using deciviews as an intermediate conversion 
instead of converting directly. Therefore, the full formula incorporating the two-step 
conversion is 
 𝑉𝑅 = 391 ∗ 𝑒−0.1∗(10∗ln�𝛽𝑒𝑥𝑡10 �) 
The spatial scale of the modeled light extinction estimates must also be adjusted to 
correspond with the design of the valuation studies and the underlying population and 
economic data. For the residential visibility benefits analysis, we convert the spatial resolution 
of the light extinction estimates from 12-km grid to county-level. We use county-level light 
extinction to match the MSA boundaries, population data, and household income data. We 
used the geographic centroids of each 12-km grid cell with the Veronoi Neighborhood 
Averaging (VNA) interpolation method in the BenMAP model for this conversion (Abt 
Associates, 2010). 
For the recreational visibility benefits analysis, we use the light extinction estimates 
from 12-km grid cell located at the geographic center of the Class I area. Although we 
considered using the IMPROVE monitor location instead, we selected the park centroid for 
three reasons: 
1. Consistency with previous method for estimating recreational visibility benefits 
2. Not all Class I areas have monitors, and shared monitors may be outside park 
3. Siting criteria for IMPROVE monitors do not include iconic scenic vista location 
6.A.3 Basic Utility Model 
Within the category of recreational visibility, further distinctions have been made. There 
is evidence (Chestnut and Rowe, 1990) that an individual’s WTP for improvements in visibility at 
a Class I area is influenced by whether it is in the region in which the individual lives, or whether 
it is somewhere else. In general, people appear to be willing to pay more for visibility 
  
6.A-3 
improvements at parks and wilderness areas that are “in-region” than at those that are “out-of-
region.” This is plausible, because people are more likely to visit, be familiar with, and care 
about parks and wilderness areas in their own part of the country. 
To value estimated changes in visibility, we use an approach that is consistent with 
economic theory. Below we discuss an application of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution 
(CES) utility function approach3 to value both residential visibility improvements and visibility 
improvements at Class I areas in the United States. This approach is based on the preference 
calibration method developed by Smith, Van Houtven, and Pattanayak (2002). 
We begin with a CES utility function in which a household derives utility from 
1. “all consumption goods,” X, 
2. visibility in the residential area in which the household is located (“residential 
visibility”),4 
3. visibility at Class I areas in the same region as the household (“in-region recreational 
visibility”), and 
4. visibility at Class I areas outside the household’s region (“out-of-region recreational 
visibility”). 
We have specified a total of six recreational visibility regions,5 so there are five regions 
for which any household is out of region. The utility function of a household in the nth 
residential area and the ith region of the country is: 
  
                                                     
3 The constant elasticity of substitution utility function has been chosen for use in this analysis because of its 
flexibility when illustrating the degree of substitutability present in various economic relationships (in this case, 
the trade-off between income and improvements in visibility). 
4 We remind the reader that, although residential and recreational visibility benefits estimation is discussed 
simultaneously in this section, benefits are calculated and presented separately for each visibility category. 
5 See Section 6.3.4 of this RIA for a description of the different recreational visibility considered in this analysis.

where 
Zn = the level of visibility in the nth residential area; 
Qik = the level of visibility at the kth in-region park (i.e., the kth park in the ith region); 
Qjk = the level of visibility at the kth park in the jth region (for which the household is 
out of region), j≠i; 
Ni = the number of Class I areas in the ith region; 
Nj = the number of Class I areas in the jth region (for which the household is out of 
region), j≠i; and 
θ, the γ’s and δ’s are parameters of the utility function corresponding to the visibility 
levels at residential areas, and at in-region and out-of-region Class I areas, 
respectively. 
In particular, the γik’s are the parameters corresponding to visibility at in-region Class I 
areas; the δ1’s are the parameters corresponding to visibility at Class I areas in region 1 
(California), if i≠1; the δ2’s are the parameters corresponding to visibility at Class I areas in 
region 2 (Colorado Plateau), if i≠2, and so forth. Because the model assumes that the 
relationship between residential visibility and utility is the same everywhere, there is only one 
θ. The parameter ρ in this CES utility function is an important determinant of the slope of the 
marginal WTP curve associated with any of the environmental quality variables. When ρ=1, the 
marginal WTP curve is horizontal. When ρ<1, it is downward sloping. 
The household’s budget constraint is: 
  
where m is income, and p is the price of X. Without loss of generality, set ρ = 1. The only choice 
variable is X. The household maximizes its utility by choosing X=m. The indirect utility function 
for a household in the nth residential area and the ith region is therefore 
  
where Q denotes the vector of vectors, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, and Q6, and the unsubscripted γ and 
δ denote vectors as well.

6.A-5 
Given estimates of ρ, θ, the γ’s and the δ’s, the household’s utility function and the 
corresponding WTP functions are fully specified. The household’s WTP for any set of changes in 
the levels of visibility at in-region Class I areas, out-of-region Class I areas, and the household’s 
residential area can be shown to be: 
  
The household’s WTP for a single visibility improvement will depend on its order in the 
series of visibility improvements the household is valuing. If it is the first visibility improvement 
to be valued, the household’s WTP for it follows directly from the previous equation. For 
example, the household’s WTP for an improvement in visibility at the first in-region park, from 
Qi1 = Q0i1 to Qi1 = Q1i1, is 
  
if this is the first (or only) visibility change the household values. 
6.A.4 Measure of Visibility: Environmental “Goods” Versus “Bads” 
In the above model, Q and Z are environmental “goods.” As the level of visibility 
increases, utility increases. The utility function and the corresponding WTP function both have 
reasonable properties. The first derivative of the indirect utility function with respect to Q (or Z) 
is positive; the second derivative is negative. WTP for a change from Q0 to a higher (improved) 
level of visibility, Q1, is therefore a concave function of Q1, with decreasing marginal WTP. 
The measure of visibility that is currently preferred by air quality scientists is the 
deciview, which increases as visibility decreases. Deciview, in effect, is a measure of the lack of 
visibility. As deciviews increase, visibility, and therefore utility, decreases. The deciview, then, is 
a measure of an environmental “bad.” There are many examples of environmental “bads”—all 
types of pollution are environmental “bads.” Utility decreases, for example, as the 
concentration of particulate matter in the atmosphere increases. 
One way to value decreases in environmental bads is to consider the “goods” with 
which they are associated, and to incorporate those goods into the utility function. In 
particular, if B denotes an environmental “bad,” such that:

6.A-6 
and the environmental “good,” Q, is a function of B, 
  
then the environmental “bad” can be related to utility via the corresponding environmental 
“good”:6 
  
The relationship between Q and B, F(B), is an empirical relationship that must be estimated. 
There is a potential problem with this approach, however. If the function relating B and 
Q is not the same everywhere (i.e., if for a given value of B, the value of Q depends on other 
factors as well), then there can be more than one value of the environmental good 
corresponding to any given value of the environmental bad, and it is not clear which value to 
use. This has been identified as a problem with translating deciviews (an environmental “bad”) 
into visual range (an environmental “good”). It has been noted that, for a given deciview value, 
there can be many different visual ranges, depending on the other factors that affect visual 
range—such as light angle and altitude. We note here, however, that this problem is not unique 
to visibility, but is a general problem when trying to translate environmental “bads” into 
“goods.”7 
In order to translate deciviews (a “bad”) into visual range (a “good”), we use a 
relationship derived by Pitchford and Malm (1994) in which 
  
where DV denotes deciview and VR denotes visual range (in kilometers). Solving for VR as a 
function of DV yields 
                                                     
6 There may be more than one “good” related to a given environmental “bad.” To simplify the discussion, however, 
we assume only a single “good.” 
7 Another example of an environmental “bad” is particulate matter air pollution (PM). The relationship between 
survival probability (Q) and the ambient PM level is generally taken to be of the form  
 where ∀ denotes the mortality rate (or level) when there is no ambient PM (i.e., when 
PM=0). However, α is implicitly a function of all the factors other than PM that affect mortality. As these factors 
change (e.g., from one location to another), αwill change (just as visual range changes as light angle changes). It 
is therefore possible to have many values of Q corresponding to a given value of PM, as the values of ∀ vary.

6.A-7 
  
This conversion is based on specific assumptions characterizing the “average” conditions 
of those factors, such as light angle, that affect visual range. To the extent that specific 
locations depart from the average conditions, the relationship will be an imperfect 
approximation.8 
6.A.5 Estimating the Parameters for Visibility at Class I Areas: the γ’s and δ’s 
As noted in Section 6.A.3, if we consider a particular visibility change as the first or the 
only visibility change valued by the household, the household’s WTP for that change in visibility 
can be calculated, given income (m), the “shape” parameter, ρ, and the corresponding 
recreational visibility parameter. For example, a Southeast household’s WTP for a change in 
visibility at in-region parks (collectively) from Q1 = Q01 to Q1 = Q11 is: 
  
if this is the first (or only) visibility change the household values. 
Alternatively, if we have estimates of m as well as WTP1in and WTP1out of in-region and 
out-of-region households, respectively, for a given change in visibility from Q01 to Q11 in 
Southeast parks, we can solve for γ1 and δ1 as a function of our estimates of m, WTP1in and 
WTP1out, for any given value of ρ. Generalizing, we can derive the values of γ and δ for the jth 
region as follows: 
  
and 
  
Chestnut and Rowe (1990) and Chestnut (1997) estimated WTP (per household) for 
specific visibility changes at national parks in three regions of the United States—both for 
households that are in-region (in the same region as the park) and for households that are out-
                                                     
8 Ideally, we would want the location-, time-, and meteorological condition-specific relationships between 
deciviews and visual range, which could be applied as appropriate. This is probably not feasible, however.

of-region. The Chestnut and Rowe study asked study subjects what they would be willing to pay 
for each of three visibility improvements in the national parks in a given region. Study subjects 
were shown a map of the region, with dots indicating the locations of the parks in question. The 
WTP questions referred to the three visibility improvements in all the parks collectively; the 
survey did not ask subjects’ WTP for these improvements in specific parks individually. 
Responses were categorized according to whether the respondents lived in the same region as 
the parks in question (“in-region” respondents) or in a different region (“out-of-region” 
respondents). The areas for which in-region and out-of-region WTP estimates are available 
from Chestnut and Rowe (1990), and the sources of benefits transfer-based estimates that we 
employ in the absence of estimates, are summarized in Table 6.A-1. In all cases, WTP refers to 
WTP per household.

a In-region” WTP is WTP for a visibility improvement in a park in the same region as that in which the household is 
located. For example, in-region WTP in the “Southeast” row is the estimate of the average Southeast 
household’s WTP for a visibility improvement in a Southeast park. 
b Out-of-region” WTP is WTP for a visibility improvement in a park that is not in the same region in which the 
household is located. For example, out-of-region WTP in the “Southeast” row is the estimate of WTP for a 
visibility improvement in a park in the Southeast by a household outside of the Southeast. 
In the primary calculation of visibility benefits for this analysis, only visibility changes at 
parks within visibility regions for which a WTP estimate was available from Chestnut and Rowe 
(1990) are considered (for both in- and out-of-region benefits). Primary estimates will not 
include visibility benefits calculated by transferring WTP values to visibility changes at parks not 
included in the Chestnut and Rowe study. Transferred benefits at parks located outside of the 
Chestnut and Rowe visibility regions will, however, be included as an alternative calculation.

The values of the parameters in a household’s utility function will depend on where the 
household is located. The region-specific parameters associated with visibility at Class I areas 
(that is, all parameters except the residential visibility parameter) are arrayed in Table 6.A-2. 
The parameters in columns 1 through 3 can be directly estimated using WTP estimates from 
Chestnut and Rowe (1990) (the columns labeled “Region 1,” “Region 2,” and “Region 3”).

a The parameters arrayed in this table are region-specific rather than park-specific or wilderness area-specific. For 
example, δ1 is the parameter associated with visibility at “Class I areas in region 1” for a household in any region 
other than region 1. The benefits analysis must derive Class I area-specific parameters (e.g., δ1k, for the k
th Class I 
area in the first region). 
For the three regions covered in Chestnut and Rowe (1990a) (California, the Colorado 
Plateau, and the Southeast United States), we can directly use the in-region WTP estimates 
from the study to estimate the parameters in the utility functions corresponding to visibility at 
in-region parks (γ1); similarly, we can directly use the out-of-region WTP estimates from the 
study to estimate the parameters for out-of-region parks (δ1). For the other three regions not 
covered in the study, however, we must rely on benefits transfer to estimate the necessary 
parameters. 
While Chestnut and Rowe (1990) provide useful information on households’ WTP for 
visibility improvements in national parks, there are several significant gaps remaining between 
the information provided in that study and the information necessary for the benefits analysis. 
First, as noted above, the WTP responses were not park specific, but only region specific. 
Because visibility improvements vary from one park in a region to another, the benefits analysis 
must value park-specific visibility changes. Second, not all Class I areas in each of the three 
regions considered in the study were included on the maps shown to study subjects. Because 
  
6.A-10 
the focus of the study was primarily national parks, most Class I wilderness areas were not 
included. Third, only three regions of the United States were included, leaving the three 
remaining regions without direct WTP estimates. 
In addition, Chestnut and Rowe (1990) elicited WTP responses for three different 
visibility changes, rather than a single change. In theory, if the CES utility function accurately 
describes household preferences, and if all households in a region have the same preference 
structure, then households’ three WTP responses corresponding to the three different visibility 
changes should all produce the same value of the associated recreational visibility parameter, 
given a value of ρ and an income, m. In practice, of course, this is not the case. 
In addressing these issues, we take a three-phase approach: 
1. We estimate region-specific parameters for the region in the modeled domain 
covered by Chestnut and Rowe (1990a) (California, the Colorado Plateau, and the 
Southeast)—γ1, γ2, and γ3 and δ1, δ2, and δ3. 
2. We infer region-specific parameters for those regions not covered by the Chestnut 
and Rowe study (the Northwest United States, the Northern Rockies, and the rest of 
the U.S.)—γ4, γ5, and γ6 and δ4, δ5, and δ6. 
3. We derive park- and wilderness area-specific parameters within each region (γ1k and 
δ1k, for k=1, …, N1; γ2k and δ2k, for k=1, …, N2; and so forth). 
The question that must be addressed in the first phase is how to estimate a single 
region-specific in-region parameter and a single region-specific out-of-region parameter for 
each of the three regions covered in Chestnut and Rowe (1990) from study respondents’ WTPs 
for three different visibility changes in each region. All parks in a region are treated collectively 
as if they were a single “regional park” in this first phase. In the second phase, we infer region-
specific recreational visibility parameters for regions not covered in the Chestnut and Rowe 
study (the Northwest United States, the Northern Rockies, and the rest of the United States). As 
in the first phase, we ignore the necessity to derive park-specific parameters at this phase. 
Finally, in the third phase, we derive park- and wilderness area-specific parameters for each 
region. 
6.A.5.1 Estimating Region-Specific Recreational Visibility Parameters for the Region Covered 
in the Chestnut and Rowe Study (Regions 1, 2, and 3) 
Given a value of ρ and estimates of m and in-region and out-of-region WTPs for a 
change from Q0 to Q1 in a given region, the in-region parameter, γ, and the out-of-region 
parameter, δ, for that region can be solved for. Chestnut and Rowe (1990), however, 
  
6.A-11 
considered not just one, but three visibility changes in each region, each of which results in a 
different calibrated γ and a different calibrated δ, even though in theory all the γ’s should be 
the same and similarly, all the δ’s should be the same. For each region, however, we must have 
only a single γ and a single δ. 
Denoting  as our estimate of γ for the jth region, based on all three visibility changes, 
we chose  to best predict the three WTPs observed in the study for the three visibility 
improvements in the jth region. First, we calculated , i=1, 2, 3, corresponding to each of the 
three visibility improvements considered in the study. Then, using a grid search method 
beginning at the average of the three’s , we chose to minimize the sum of the squared 
differences between the WTPs we predict using  and the three region-specific WTPs 
observed in the study. That is, we selected to minimize: 
  
where WTPij and WTPij() are the observed and the predicted WTPs for a change in visibility in 
the jth region from Q0 = Q0i to Q1= Q1i, i=1, …, 3. An analogous procedure was used to select an 
optimal δ, for each of the three regions in the Chestnut and Rowe study. 
6.A.5.2 Inferring Region-Specific Recreational Visibility Parameters for Regions Not Covered 
in the Chestnut and Rowe Study (Regions 4, 5, and 6) 
One possible approach to estimating region-specific parameters for regions not covered 
by Chestnut and Rowe (1990a) (γ4, γ5, and γ6 and δ4, δ5, and δ6) is to simply assume that 
households’ utility functions are the same everywhere, and that the environmental goods being 
valued are the same—e.g., that a change in visibility at national parks in California is the same 
environmental good to a Californian as a change in visibility at national parks in Minnesota is to 
a Minnesotan. 
For example, to estimate δ4 in the utility function of a California household, 
corresponding to visibility at national parks in the Northwest United States, we might assume 
that out-of-region WTP for a given visibility change at national parks in the Northwest United 
States is the same as out-of-region WTP for the same visibility change at national parks in 
California (income held constant). Suppose, for example, that we have an estimated mean WTP 
of out-of-region households for a visibility change from Q01 to Q11 at national parks in California 
(region 1), denoted WTP1out. Suppose the mean income of the out-of-region subjects in the

study was m. We might assume that, for the same change in visibility at national parks in the 
Northwest United States, WTP4out = WTP1out among out-of-region individuals with income m. 
We could then derive the value of δ4, given a value of ρ as follows: 
  
where Q04 = Q01 and Q14 = Q11, (i.e., where it is the same visibility change in parks in region 4 
that was valued at parks in the region 1). 
This benefits transfer method assumes that (1) all households have the same preference 
structures and (2) what is being valued in the Northwest United States (by a California 
household) is the same as what is being valued in the California (by all out-of-region 
households). While we cannot know the extent to which the first assumption approximates 
reality, the second assumption is clearly problematic. National parks in one region are likely to 
differ from national parks in another region in both quality and quantity (i.e., number of parks). 
One statistic that is likely to reflect both the quality and quantity of national parks in a 
region is the average annual visitation rate to the parks in that region. A reasonable way to 
gauge the extent to which out-of-region people would be willing to pay for visibility changes in 
parks in the Northwest United States versus in California might be to compare visitation rates in 
the two regions.9 Suppose, for example, that twice as many visitor-days are spent in California 
parks per year as in parks in the Northwest United States per year. This could be an indication 
that the parks in California are in some way more desirable than those in the Northwest United 
States and/or that there are more of them—i.e., that the environmental goods being valued in 
the two regions (“visibility at national parks”) are not the same. 
A preferable way to estimate δ4, then, might be to assume the following relationship: 
  
(income held constant), where n1 = the average annual number of visitor-days to California 
parks and n4 = the average annual number of visitor-days to parks in the Northwest United 
States. This implies that 
                                                     
9 We acknowledge that reliance on visitation rates does not get at nonuse value.

for the same change in visibility in region 4 parks among out-of-region individuals with income 
m. If, for example, n1 = 2n4, WTP4out would be half of WTP1out. The interpretation would be the 
following: California national parks have twice as many visitor-days per year as national parks in 
the Northwest United States; therefore they must be twice as desirable/plentiful; therefore, 
out-of-region people would be willing to pay twice as much for visibility changes in California 
parks as in parks in the Northwest United States; therefore a Californian would be willing to pay 
only half as much for a visibility change in national parks in the Northwest United States as an 
out-of-region individual would be willing to pay for the same visibility change in national parks 
in California. This adjustment, then, is based on the premise that the environmental goods 
being valued (by people out of region) are not the same in all regions. 
The parameter δ4 is estimated as shown above, using this adjusted WTP4out. The same 
procedure is used to estimate δ5 and δ6. We estimate γ4, γ, and γ6 in an analogous way, using 
the in-region WTP estimates from the transfer regions, e.g., 
  
6.A.5.3 Estimating Park- and Wilderness Area-Specific Parameters 
As noted above, Chestnut and Rowe (1990) estimated WTP for a region’s national parks 
collectively, rather than providing park-specific WTP estimates. The ’s and ’s are the  
the parameters that would be in household utility functions if there were only a single park in 
each region, or if the many parks in a region were effectively indistinguishable from one 
another. Also noted above is the fact that the Chestnut and Rowe study did not include all Class 
I areas in the regions it covered, focusing primarily on national parks rather than wilderness 
areas. Most Class I wilderness areas were not represented on the maps shown to study 
subjects. In California, for example, there are 31 Class I areas, including 6 national parks and 25 
wilderness areas. The Chestnut and Rowe study map of California included only 10 of these 
Class I areas, including all 6 of the national parks. It is unclear whether subjects had in mind “all 
parks and wilderness areas” when they offered their WTPs for visibility improvements, or 
whether they had in mind the specific number of (mostly) parks that were shown on the maps. 
The derivation of park- and wilderness area-specific parameters depends on this.

6.A.5.4 Derivation of Region-Specific WTP for National Parks and Wilderness Areas 
If study subjects were lumping all Class I areas together in their minds when giving their 
WTP responses, then it would be reasonable to allocate that WTP among the specific parks and 
wilderness areas in the region to derive park- and wilderness area-specific γ’s and δ’s for the 
region. If, on the other hand, study subjects were thinking only of the (mostly) parks shown on 
the map when they gave their WTP response, then there are two possible approaches that 
could be taken. One approach assumes that households would be willing to pay some 
additional amount for the same visibility improvement in additional Class I areas that were not 
shown, and that this additional amount can be estimated using the same benefits transfer 
approach used to estimate region-specific WTPs in regions not covered by Chestnut and Rowe 
(1990a). 
However, even if we believe that households would be willing to pay some additional 
amount for the same visibility improvement in additional Class I areas that were not shown, it is 
open to question whether this additional amount can be estimated using benefits transfer 
methods. A third possibility, then, is to simply omit wilderness areas from the benefits analysis. 
For this analysis we calculate visibility benefits assuming that study subjects lumped all Class I 
areas together when stating their WTP, even if these Class I areas were not present on the map. 
6.A.5.5 Derivation of Park- and Wilderness Area-Specific WTPs, Given Region-Specific WTPs 
for National Parks and Wilderness Areas 
The first step in deriving park- and wilderness area-specific parameters is the estimation 
of park- and wilderness area-specific WTPs. To derive park and wilderness area-specific WTPs, 
we apportion the region-specific WTP to the specific Class I areas in the region according to 
each area’s share of the region’s visitor-days. For example, if WTP1in and WTP1out denote the 
mean household WTPs in the Chestnut and Rowe (1990) study among respondents who were 
in-region-1 and out-of-region-1, respectively, n1k denotes the annual average number of visitor-
days to the kth Class I area in California, and n1 denotes the annual average number of visitor-
days to all Class I areas in California (that are included in the benefits analysis), then we assume 
that

Using WTPjin and WTPjout, either from the Chestnut and Rowe study (for j = 1, 2, and 3) or 
derived by the benefits transfer method (for j = 4, 5, and 6), the same method is used to derive 
Class I area-specific WTPs in each of the six regions. 
While this is not a perfect allocation scheme, it is a reasonable scheme, given the 
limitations of data. Visitors to national parks in the United States are not all from the United 
States, and certainly not all from the region in which the park is located. A very large proportion 
of the visitors to Yosemite National Park in California, for example, may come from outside the 
United States. The above allocation scheme implicitly assumes that the relative frequencies of 
visits to the parks in a region from everyone in the world is a reasonable index of the relative 
WTP of an average household in that region (WTPjin) or out of that region (but in the United 
States) (WTPjout) for visibility improvements at these parks.10 
A possible problem with this allocation scheme is that the relative frequency of visits is 
an indicator of use value but not necessarily of nonuse value, which may be a substantial 
component of the household’s total WTP for a visibility improvement at Class I areas. If park A 
is twice as popular (i.e., has twice as many visitors per year) as park B, this does not necessarily 
imply that a household’s WTP for an improvement in visibility at park A is twice its WTP for the 
same improvement at park B. Although an allocation scheme based on relative visitation 
frequencies has some obvious problems, however, it is still probably the best way to allocate a 
collective WTP. 
6.A.5.6 Derivation of Park- and Wilderness Area-Specific Parameters, Given Park- and 
Wilderness-Specific WTP 
Once the Class I area-specific WTPs have been estimated, we could derive the park- and 
wilderness area-specific γ’s and δ’s using the method used to derive region-specific γ’s and δ’s. 
Recall that that method involved (1) calibrating γ and δ to each of the three visibility 
improvements in the Chestnut and Rowe study (producing three γ’s and three δ’s), 
(2) averaging the three γ’s and averaging the three δ’s, and finally, (3) using these average γ and 
δ as starting points for a grid search to find the optimal γ and the optimal δ—i.e., the γ and δ 
                                                     
10 This might be thought of as two assumptions: (1) that the relative frequencies of visits to the parks in a region 
from everyone in the world is a reasonable representation of the relative frequency of visits from people in the 
United States—i.e., that the parks that are most popular (receive the most visitors per year) in general are also 
the most popular among Americans; and (2) that the relative frequency with which Americans visit each of their 
parks is a good index of their relative WTPs for visibility improvements at these parks.

that would allow us to reproduce, as closely as possible, the three in-region and three out-of-
region WTPs in the study for the three visibility changes being valued. 
Going through this procedure for each national park and each wilderness area 
separately would be very time consuming, however. We therefore used a simpler approach, 
which produces very close approximations to the γ’s and δ’s produced using the above 
approach. If: 
WTPjin = the in-region WTP for the change in visibility from Q0 to Q1 in the jth region; 
WTPjkin = the in-region WTP for the same visibility change (from Q0 to Q1) in the kth 
Class I area in the jth region (= sjk*WTPjin, where sjk is the kth area’s share of 
visitor-days in the jth region); 
m = income; 
γj* = the optimal value of γ for the jth region; and 
γjk = the value of γjk calibrated to WTPjkin and the change from Q0 to Q1; 
then11:

11 γj* is only approximately equal to the right-hand side because, although it is the optimal value designed to 
reproduce as closely as possible all three of the WTPs corresponding to the three visibility changes in the 
Chestnut and Rowe study, γj* will not exactly reproduce any of these WTPs.

We use the adjustment factor, ajk, to derive γjk from γj*, for the kth Class I area in the jth 
region. We use an analogous procedure to derive δjk from δj* for the kth Class I area in the jth 
region (where, in this case, we use WTPjout and WTPjkout instead of WTPjin and WTPjkin).12 
6.A.6 Estimating the Parameter for Visibility in Residential Areas: θ 
In previous assessments, EPA used a study on residential visibility valuation conducted 
in 1990 (McClelland et al., 1993). Consistent with advice from EPA’s Science Advisory Board 
(SAB), EPA designated the McClelland et al. study as significantly less reliable for regulatory 
benefit-cost analysis, although it does provide useful estimates on the order of magnitude of 
residential visibility benefits (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999).13 In order to estimate residential visibility 
benefits in this analysis, we have replaced the previous methodology with a new benefits 
transfer approach and incorporated additional valuation studies. This new approach was 
developed for The Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act 1990 to 2020: EPA Report to Congress 
(U.S. EPA, 2011) and reviewed by the SAB (U. S. EPA-SAB, 2010). To value residential visibility 
improvements, the new approach draws upon information from the Brookshire et al. (1979), 
Loehman et al. (1985) and Tolley et al. (1984) studies.14 These studies provide primary visibility 
values for Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Mobile, San Francisco, and 
Washington D.C.15 
The estimation of θ is a simpler procedure for residential visibility benefits, involving a 
straightforward calibration using the study income and WTP for each study city: 
  
                                                     
12 This method uses a single in-region WTP and a single out-of-region WTP per region. Although the choice of WTP 
will affect the resulting adjustment factors (the ajk’s) and therefore the resulting γjk’s and δjk’s, the effect is 
negligible. We confirmed this by using each of the three in-region WTPs in California and comparing the 
resulting three sets of γjk’s and δjk’s, which were different from each other by about one one-hundredth of a 
percent. 
13 EPA’s Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis noted that the McClelland et al. (1993) study may not 
incorporate two potentially important adjustments. First, their study does not account for the “warm glow” 
effect, in which respondents may provide higher willingness to pay estimates simply because they favor “good 
causes” such as environmental improvement. Second, while the study accounts for non-response bias, it may 
not employ the best available methods. As a result of these concerns, the Council recommended that 
residential visibility be omitted from the overall primary benefits estimate. (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999) 
14 Loehman et al. (1985) and Brookshire et al. (1979) were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals (see 
Loehman et al. (1994) and Brookshire et al. (1982). The Tolley et al. (1984) work was not published, but was 
subject to peer review during study development. 
15 Recognizing potential fundamental issues associated with data collected in Cincinnati and Miami (e.g., see 
Chestnut et al. (1986) and Chestnut and Rowe (1990c), we do not include values for these cities in our analysis.

where: 
m = household income, 
ρ = shape parameter (0.1), 
θ = WTP parameter corresponding to the visibility at MSA, 
Z0 = starting visibility, and 
Z1 = visibility after change. 
Where studies provide multiple estimates for visual range improvements for a single 
study city, we estimate one θ as the simple average of the θ calculated for each set of visual 
range improvements. 
6.A.7 Putting It All Together: The Household Utility and WTP Functions 
Given an estimate of θ, derived as shown in Section 6.A.4, and estimates of the γ’s and 
δ’s, derived as shown in Section 6.A.3, based on an assumed or estimated value of ρ, the utility 
and WTP functions for a household in any region are fully specified. We could therefore 
estimate the value to that household of visibility changes from any baseline level to any 
alternative level in the household’s residential area and/or at any or all of the Class I areas in 
the United States, in a way that is consistent with economic theory. In particular, the WTP of a 
household in the ith region and the nth residential area for any set of changes in the levels of 
visibility at in-region Class I areas, out-of-region Class I areas, and the household’s residential 
area is: 
  
The national benefits associated with any suite of visibility changes would be calculated 
as the sum of these household WTPs for those changes. The benefit of any subset of visibility 
changes (e.g., changes in visibility only at Class I areas in California) can be calculated by setting 
all the other components of the WTP function to zero (that is, by assuming that all other 
visibility changes that are not of interest are zero). This is effectively the same as assuming that 
the subset of visibility changes of interest is the first or the only set of changes being valued by 
households. Estimating benefit components in this way will yield slightly upward biased 
estimates of benefits, because disposable income, m, is not being reduced by the WTPs for any 
prior visibility improvements. That is, each visibility improvement (e.g., visibility at Class I areas 
in the California) is assumed to be the first, and they cannot all be the first. The upward bias

should be extremely small, however, because all of the WTPs for visibility changes are very 
small relative to income. 
Although we recognize that the approach described above is most consistent with 
economic theory, we have chosen to not use this function with income constraints on overall 
WTP. Instead, we simply add the total preference calibrated recreational visibility benefits to 
the preference-calibrated residential visibility benefits. Again, because all of the WTPs for 
visibility changes are very small relative to income, the upward bias should be extremely small. 
6.A.8 Income Elasticity and Income Growth Adjustment for Visibility Benefits 
Growth in real income over time is an important component of benefits analysis. 
Economic theory argues that WTP for most goods (such as environmental protection) will 
increase if real incomes increase. There is substantial empirical evidence that the income 
elasticity16 of WTP for health risk reductions is positive, although there is uncertainty about its 
exact value. Thus, as real income increases, the WTP for environmental improvements also 
increases. Although many analyses assume that the income elasticity of WTP is unit elastic (i.e., 
a 10% higher real income level implies a 10% higher WTP to reduce risk changes), empirical 
evidence suggests that income elasticity is substantially less than one and thus relatively 
inelastic. As real income rises, the WTP value also rises but at a slower rate than real income. 
The effects of real income changes on WTP estimates can influence benefits estimates 
in two different ways: through real income growth between the year a WTP study was 
conducted and the year for which benefits are estimated, and through differences in income 
between study populations and the affected populations at a particular time. Empirical 
evidence of the effect of real income on WTP gathered to date is based on studies examining 
the former. The Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (EEAC) of the Science Advisory 
Board (SAB) advised EPA to adjust WTP for increases in real income over time but not to adjust 
WTP to account for cross-sectional income differences “because of the sensitivity of making 
such distinctions, and because of insufficient evidence available at present” (U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2000a). A recent advisory by another committee associated with the SAB, the Advisory Council 
on Clean Air Compliance Analysis, has provided conflicting advice. While agreeing with “the 
general principle that the willingness to pay to reduce mortality risks is likely to increase with 
growth in real income (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004)” and that “The same increase should be assumed 
for the WTP for serious nonfatal health effects (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004),” they note that “given the 
                                                     
16 Income elasticity is a common economic measure equal to the percentage change in WTP for a 1% change in 
income. 
  
6.A-20 
limitations and uncertainties in the available empirical evidence, the Council does not support 
the use of the proposed adjustments for aggregate income growth as part of the primary 
analysis (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004).” Until these conflicting advisories have been reconciled, EPA will 
continue to adjust valuation estimates to reflect income growth using the methods described 
below, while providing sensitivity analyses for alternative income growth adjustment factors. 
We assume that the WTP for improved visibility would increase with growth in real 
income. The relative magnitude of the income elasticity of WTP for visibility compared with 
those for health effects suggests that visibility is not as much of a necessity as health, thus, WTP 
is more elastic with respect to income. 
Details of the general procedure to account for projected growth in real U.S. income 
between 1990 and 2020 can be found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999). Specifically, we use the 
elasticity for visibility benefits provided in Chestnut (1997). 
In addition to elasticity estimates, projections of real gross domestic product (GDP) and 
populations from 1990 to 2020 are needed to adjust benefits to reflect real per capita income 
growth. We used projections of real GDP provided in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) for the 
years 1990 to 2010.17 We used projections of real GDP provided by Standard and Poor’s (2000) 
for the years 2010 to 2020.18 Visibility benefits are adjusted by multiplying the unadjusted 
benefits by the appropriate adjustment factor.

and residential visibility benefits.

are based on average GDP growth rates between 1999 and 2007. 
18 In previous analyses, we used the Standard and Poor’s projections of GDP directly. This led to an apparent 
discontinuity in the adjustment factors between 2010 and 2011. We refined the method by applying the 
relative growth rates for GDP derived from the Standard and Poor’s projections to the 2010 projected GDP 
based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis projections.

CHAPTER 7 
ENGINEERING COST ANALYSIS 
7.1 Synopsis 
This chapter summarizes the data sources and methodology used to estimate the 
engineering costs of attaining the alternative, more stringent levels for the PM2.5 primary 
standard analyzed in this RIA. This chapter provides the estimates of the engineering costs of 
alternative annual standards of 13, 12, and 11 µg/m3 in conjunction with retaining the 24-hour 
standard of 35 µg/m3, as well as one of the alternative, more stringent annual standards 
(11 µg/m3) in conjunction with an alternative, more stringent 24-hour standard of 30 µg/m3 
(referred to as 13/35, 12/35, 11/35, and 11/30). This chapter also presents engineering cost 
estimates for the control strategies outlined in Chapter 4. The cost discussion for known 
controls in Section 7.2.2 is followed by a presentation of estimates for the engineering costs of 
the additional (beyond known controls) tons of emission reductions that are needed to move to 
full attainment of the alternative standards analyzed; this estimation approach, discussed in 
Section 7.2.3, is referred to as extrapolated costs. 
The engineering costs described in this chapter generally include the costs of 
purchasing, installing, operating, and maintaining the referenced technologies. For a variety of 
reasons, actual control costs may vary from the estimates EPA presents. As discussed 
throughout this document, the technologies and control strategies selected for analysis are 
illustrative of one way in which nonattainment areas could meet a revised standard. There are 
numerous ways to construct and evaluate potential control programs that would bring areas 
into attainment with alternative standards, and EPA anticipates that state and local 
governments will consider programs that are best suited for local conditions. Furthermore, 
based on past experience, EPA believes that it is reasonable to anticipate that the marginal cost 
of control will decline over time due to technological improvements and more widespread 
adoption of previously considered niche control technologies.1 Also, EPA recognizes the 
extrapolated portion of the engineering cost estimates reflects substantial uncertainty about 
which sectors, and which technologies, might become available for cost-effective application in 
the future.  
The engineering cost estimates are limited in their scope. This analysis focuses on the 
emission reductions needed for attainment of a range of alternative revised standards, not 
                                                     
1 See Chapter 4, Section 4.3 for additional discussion of uncertainties associated with predicting technological 
advancements that may occur between now and 2020. 
 7-2 
implementation of a final revised standard. EPA understands that some states will incur costs 
both designing State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for and implementing new control strategies 
to meet the revised standard. However, EPA does not know what specific actions states will 
take to design their SIPs to meet the revised standards, therefore we do not present estimated 
costs that government agencies may incur for managing the requirement, implementing these 
(or other) control strategies, or for offering incentives that may be necessary to encourage the 
implementation of specific technologies, especially for technologies that are not necessarily 
market driven. This analysis does not assume specific control measures that would be required 
in order to implement these technologies on a regional or local level. 
7.2 PM2.5 Engineering Costs 
7.2.1 Data and Methods—Identified Control Costs (non-EGU Point and Area Sources) 
After designing the hypothetical control strategy using the methodology discussed in 
Chapter 4, EPA used the Control Strategy Tool2 (CoST) to estimate engineering control costs for 
non-EGU point and area sources.3 CoST calculates engineering costs using one of three 
different methods: (1) by multiplying an average annualized cost-per-ton estimate against the 
total tons of a pollutant reduced to derive a total cost estimate; (2) by calculating cost using an 
equation that incorporates key plant information; or (3) by using both cost-per-ton and cost 
equations. Most control cost information within CoST was developed based on the cost-per-ton 
approach because estimating engineering costs using an equation requires more data, and 
parameters used in other non-cost-per-ton methods may not be readily available or broadly 
representative across sources within the emissions inventory. The costing equations used in 
CoST require either plant capacity or stack flow to determine annual, capital and/or operating 
and maintenance (O&M) costs. Capital costs are converted to annual costs using the capital 
recovery factor (CRF).4 Where possible, cost calculations are used to calculate total annual 
control cost (TACC), which is a function of capital costs (CC) and O&M costs. The CRF 
incorporates the interest rate and equipment life (in years) of the control equipment. Operating 
costs are calculated as a function of annual O&M and other variable costs. The resulting TACC 
equation is TACC = (CRF * CC) + O&M. 
                                                     
2 The Control Strategy Tool recently underwent peer review by an ad hoc panel of experts. Responses to the peer 
review are currently under development and will be available by final promulgation of this rule. 
3 Area sources are not necessarily non-urban sources. 
4 The capital recovery factor formula is expressed as [r*(1+r)^n/(1+r)^n -1]. Where r is the real rate of interest and 
n is the number of time periods. For more information on this cost methodology and the CoST, please refer to 
the documentation at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/CoST, the EPA Air Pollution Control Cost Manual found at 
http://epa.gov/ttn/catc/products.html#cccinfo, and EPA’s Guidelines for Preparing Economic 
Analyses, Chapter 6 found at http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/webpages/Guidelines.html#download. 
 7-3 
Engineering costs will differ based upon quantity of emissions reduced, plant capacity, 
or stack flow, which can vary by the emissions inventory year. Engineering costs will also differ 
in nominal terms by the year the costs are calculated for (i.e., 1999$ versus 2006$).5 For capital 
investment, in order to attain standards in 2020 we assume capital investment occurs at the 
beginning of 2020. We make this simplifying assumption because we do not know what all firms 
making capital investments will do and when they will do it. For 2020, our estimate of 
annualized costs includes annualized capital and O&M costs for those controls included in our 
identified control strategy analysis. Our engineering cost analysis uses the equivalent uniform 
annual costs (EUAC) method, in which annualized costs are calculated based on the equipment 
life for the control measure along with the interest rate incorporated into the CRF. Annualized 
costs represent an equal stream of yearly costs over the period the control technology is 
expected to operate. We make no presumption of additional capital investment in years 
beyond 2020. The EUAC method is discussed in detail in the EPA Air Pollution Control Cost 
Manual.6 Applied controls and their respective engineering costs are provided in the PM NAAQS 
docket. 
7.2.2 Identified Control Costs 
In this section, we provide engineering cost estimates for the control strategies 
identified in Chapter 4 that include control technologies on non-EGU point sources and area 
sources. Engineering costs generally refer to the capital equipment expense, the site 
preparation costs for the application, and annual operating and maintenance costs. Note that 
the application of these control strategies results in some, but not all, geographic areas 
reaching attainment for the alternative PM2.5 standards. 
Because we obtain control cost data from many sources, we are not always able to 
obtain consistent data across original data sources.7 If disaggregated control cost data is 
unavailable (i.e., where capital, equipment life value, and O&M costs are not separated out), 
EPA typically assumes that the estimated control costs are annualized using a 7 percent 
discount rate. When disaggregated control cost data is available (i.e., where capital, equipment 
life value, and O&M costs are explicit) we can recalculate costs using a 3 percent discount rate. 
For non-EGU point source controls, some disaggregated data is available and we were able to 
calculate costs at both 3 and 7 percent discount rates for that control cost data. For the 12/35, 
                                                     
5 The engineering costs will not be any different in real (inflation-adjusted) terms if calculated in 2006 versus other-
year dollars, if the other-year dollars are properly adjusted. For this analysis, all costs are reported in real 2006 
dollars.

7 Data sources can include states and technical studies, which do not typically include the original data source. 
 7-4 
11/35, and 11/30 alternative standards approximately 31 percent, 33 percent, and 29 percent, 
respectively, of known control costs are disaggregated at a level that could be discounted at 3 
percent. Because we do not have disaggregated control cost data for any area source controls, 
total annualized costs are assumed to be calculated using a 7 percent discount rate. See Table 
7-1 for a summary of sectors, control costs, and discount rates used.

a All estimates rounded to two significant figures. 
b All non-EGU point source costs and all area source costs are included in this column and are assumed to be 
calculated at a 7 percent discount rate. 
c This column includes the non-EGU point source costs that we were able to calculate at a 3 percent rate and no 
area source costs. The non-EGU point source costs calculated at a 3 percent rate are those for which we have 
disaggregated control cost data. 
d Our known control costs discounted at a 3 percent rate are a combination of area source costs and non-EGU 
point source costs discounted at a 7 percent rate only and non-EGU point source costs discounted at 3 percent 
when disaggregated control cost data is available. 
The total annualized cost of control in each sector in the control scenario is summarized 
by region in Table 7-2. Table 7-2 includes annualized control costs to allow for comparison 
across regions and between costs and benefits. These numbers reflect the engineering costs 
annualized at discount rates of 3 percent and 7 percent, consistent with the guidance provided 
in the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) (2003) Circular A-4. However, it is important 
to note that it is not possible to estimate both 3 percent and 7 percent discount rates for each 
individual facility. 
 7-5 
In this RIA, non-EGU point sources were the only sources with available data to perform 
a sensitivity analysis of our annualized control costs to the choice of interest rate. As such, the 3 
percent column in Table 7-2 reflects the sum of some non-EGU point sources at a 3 percent 
discount rate, some non-EGU point sources at a 7 percent discount rate, and the area sources 
at a 7 percent discount rate. The 3 percent column represents a slight overestimate because 
some non-EGU point sources and area sources are included using a 7 percent discount rate.8 
With the exception of the 3 percent Total Annualized Cost estimate in Table 7-2, engineering 
cost estimates presented throughout this and subsequent chapters are based on a 7 percent 
discount rate.

8 In these analyses, the discount rates refer to the rate at which capital costs are annualized. A higher discount, or 
interest, rate results in a larger annualized cost of capital estimate.

b Because we obtain control cost data from many sources, we are not always able to obtain consistent data across 
original data sources. Where disaggregated control cost data is available (i.e., where capital, equipment life 
value, and O&M costs are explicit) we can calculate costs using a 3 percent discount rate. Therefore the cost 
estimate provided here is a summation of costs at 3 percent and 7 percent discount rates. 
c All known controls were applied in the baseline. 
The total annualized engineering costs associated with the application of known 
controls, incremental to the baseline and using a 7 percent discount rate, are approximately 
$310,000 for an alternative annual standard of 12/35, $53 million for an 11/35 alternative 
standard, and $100 million for an 11/30 alternative standard. In addition, it is important to note 
there is no partial attainment known control costs for a 13/35 alternative standard.9 
7.2.3 Extrapolated Costs 
This section presents the methodology and results of the extrapolated engineering cost 
calculations for attainment of alternative PM2.5 standards of 13/35, 12/35, 11/35, and 11/30. All 
costs presented for the illustrative control strategies are calculated incrementally from the 
current PM2.5 standard of 15/35, therefore, any additional emission reductions needed to attain 
the current 24-hour standard of 35 µg/m3 are part of the baseline analysis and not presented 
here. Note that the extrapolated costs don’t account for cost differences between reducing 
additional tons by emissions source sector. 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the application of the modeled control strategy 
was not successful in reaching nationwide attainment for these alternative PM2.5 standards. 
Because some areas remained in nonattainment, the engineering costs detailed in Section 7.2.2 
represent the costs of partial attainment for PM2.5 standards of 13/35, 12/35, 11/35, and 11/30. 
For each alternative standard and geographic area that cannot reach attainment with known 
controls, we estimated, in a least-cost way, the additional emission reductions needed for PM2.5 
and its precursors, NOx and SO2, to attain the standard. To generate estimates of the costs and 
benefits of meeting alternative standards, EPA has assumed the application of unspecified 
future controls that make possible the emission reductions needed for attainment in 2020. By 
definition, no cost data currently exists for unidentified future technologies or innovative 
strategies. EPA used two methodologies for estimating the costs of unspecified future controls: 
a fixed-cost methodology and a hybrid methodology. The fixed-cost methodology is more 
straight forward and transparent than the hybrid methodology. In the hybrid methodology, the 
coefficient for the X2 term can be difficult to estimate and if it is zero, the functional form 
                                                     
9 Only one county (Riverside County, CA) exceeded the 13/35 alternative standard. All known controls were used in 
the baseline analysis for this county; therefore there are no known control costs for this standard. Total costs 
for 13/35 are represented by extrapolated costs only—see Table 7.3 below. 
 7-7 
becomes the same as the fixed-cost methodology’s functional form. Additional discussion of 
the functional form associated with the hybrid methodology is in Appendix 7.A. Both 
approaches assume that innovative strategies and new control options make possible the 
emissions reductions needed for attainment by 2020. The fixed-cost methodology uses a 
$15,000/ton estimate for each ton of PM2.5, SO2, and NOx reduced, and the hybrid approach is 
similar to the hybrid approach used for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS RIA cost analysis. The 
$15,000/ton amount is commensurate with that used in the 1997 Ozone Regulatory Impact 
Analysis and is consistent with what an advisory committee to the Section 812 second 
prospective analysis on the Clean Air Act Amendments suggested. In Section 7.A.2.1 we conduct 
sensitivity analysis on the fixed-cost estimate of $15,000/ton. The fixed-cost methodology was 
preferred by EPA’s Science Advisory Board over two other options, including a marginal-cost-
based approach.  
“When assigning costs to unidentified measures, the Council suggests that a simple, 
transparent method that is sensitive to the degree of uncertainty about these costs is best. 
Of the three approaches outlined, assuming a fixed cost/ton appears to be the simplest 
and most straightforward. Uncertainty might be represented using alternative fixed costs 
per ton of emissions avoided.”  
EPA requests comments or suggestions on all aspects of the methodologies for estimating the 
costs of unspecified future controls to provide illustrative estimates of NAAQS costs, including 
choice of functional forms of the equations, initial parameter estimates, and the initial fixed-
cost estimate of $15,000/ton. 
In Appendix 4.A we include estimates of the relationship between additional emission 
reductions for each pollutant and air quality improvements. In this chapter we present 
estimates of the costs for each additional emission reduction for each pollutant and geographic 
area. The mix of pollutants varies by area, because each area has different amounts of known 
controls, different additional air quality improvements required, and different amounts of 
uncontrolled emissions remaining.  
Estimating engineering costs for emission reductions needed beyond those from known 
controls to reach attainment in 2020 is inherently a challenging exercise. As described later in 
this chapter, our experience with Clean Air Act implementation shows that technological 
advances and development of innovative strategies can reduce emissions and reduce the costs 
of emerging technologies over time. Technological change may provide new possibilities for 
controlling emissions as well as reducing the cost of known controls through technological 
 7-8 
improvements or higher control efficiencies. EPA requests comment on the likelihood that new 
technologies that control direct PM2.5 and its precursors will become available between now 
and 2020. 
Because three different pollutants are involved, there are many different combinations 
of pollutant reductions that would result in the required air quality improvements. Early in our 
analysis we decided to use the hybrid-cost methodology to estimate the costs of the emission 
reductions needed from unknown controls. However, the hybrid methodology still has a 
number of important uncertainties, and its reliability for extrapolating costs has not been 
evaluated. While we applied the methodology to generate emission reduction estimates 
needed beyond known controls for the proposed PM2.5 standards and several alternatives, the 
degree of extrapolation for emissions reductions caused us to reconsider applying the hybrid 
methodology to obtain estimates of extrapolated costs. Consistent with an SAB 
recommendation, we use the fixed-cost per ton methodology to generate the estimates of 
extrapolated costs for emission reductions needed from unknown controls. We perform 
sensitivity analyses using both the alternative fixed cost per ton and the hybrid methodologies 
in Appendix 7.A  
As discussed in Chapter 4, we developed the emission reduction estimates for each 
alternative standard using the hybrid methodology. As a result, the emissions reductions that 
form the basis of the primary cost and benefit estimates may include a different mix of PM2.5 
and SO2 emissions reductions than may have been identified as least cost had we employed the 
fixed-cost methodology to develop the emission reduction estimates. Using the fixed-cost 
methodology, the less expensive pollutant, for air quality improvements, to reduce will be 
selected until there are no remaining tons to reduce. Using the hybrid methodology, the less 
expensive pollutant to reduce will be selected until the marginal cost to reduce the next ton 
exceeds the marginal cost to reduce the next ton of an alternate pollutant. At that point, the 
methodology chooses a mix of pollutants to achieve the least-cost solution. Since the cost per 
ton is held constant in the fixed-cost methodology, the least-cost solution would select all 
available direct PM2.5 emissions reductions before selecting SO2 emissions reductions.10 
Therefore, the hybrid methodology estimates PM2.5 emissions reductions lower than or equal 
                                                     
10 Because the marginal cost equation for each pollutant is expected to be less accurate for the very last portion of 
a pollutant in an area, and it is unlikely an area would reduce all anthropogenic emissions to zero on one 
pollutant prior to controlling others, we included the constraint that no more than 90% of the remaining 
emissions in an area for a given pollutant can be reduced from emission reductions beyond known control 
measures. 
 7-9 
to the fixed-cost methodology and SO2 emission reductions higher than or equal to the fixed-
cost methodology.  
Because we used the hybrid methodology in selecting emissions reductions, the total 
cost estimate is higher than if we had selected needed emissions reductions using the fixed-
cost methodology. This is because the total number of tons identified and summed across 
pollutants under the hybrid methodology may be higher than the total number of tons needed 
under the fixed-cost methodology. For example, the hybrid methodology may choose to reduce 
direct PM2.5 by 15 tons of and SO2 by 8 tons, whereas the fixed-cost methodology may choose 
to reduce direct PM2.5 by 20 tons to obtain the same air quality improvement for an area. 
Applying the fixed cost-per-ton to the total reductions, the hybrid methodology would result in 
total costs of $345,000 (23 tons * $15,000/ton), and the fixed-cost methodology would result in 
total costs of $300,000 (20 tons * $15,000/ton). 
Extrapolated cost estimates are provided using a 7 percent discount rate because 
known control measure information is available at 7 percent for all measures applied in this 
analysis. Table 7-3 provides the extrapolated cost estimates using the fixed-cost methodology 
described above, using a fixed cost-per-ton of $15,000/ton. The extrapolated costs estimate is 
$69 million dollars (2006$) for the 12/35 alternative standard.

Of note is the geographic distribution of extrapolated costs. For all of the alternative 
standards, the above costs indicate that California, as possibly expected, represents a 
significant portion of the extrapolated costs. For the 11/30, 11/35, 12/35, and 13/35 alternative 
standards, California represents 65 percent, 82 percent, 94 percent and 100 percent, 
respectively, of the extrapolated cost estimates.  
7.2.4 Total Cost Estimates 
 Table 7-4 presents a summary of the total national costs of attaining 13/35, 12/35, 
11/35, and 11/30 alternative standards in 2020. This summary includes the engineering costs 
presented above from the known controls analysis, as well as the extrapolated costs. As 
discussed in Section 7.2.2, costs for known controls for non-EGU point sources where capital 
 7-11 
cost and equipment life information were available were calculated at a 3 percent discount 
rate. Extrapolated costs were calculated at a 7 percent discount rate only.  
To calculate total cost estimates at a 3 percent discount rate and to include the 
extrapolated costs in those totals, we added the known control estimates at a 3 percent 
discount rate to the extrapolated costs at a 7 percent discount rate. To more clearly present the 
total cost calculations for both approaches, we include column labels in Table 7-4, e.g., A, B, 
and C.  
The costs associated with monitoring, reporting, and record keeping for affected 
sources are not included in these annualized cost estimates. Based on preliminary estimates 
prepared for the upcoming PM2.5 Implementation Rule Information Collection Request (ICR), 
EPA believes these costs are minor compared to the control costs.

7.3 Changes in Regulatory Cost Estimates over Time 
Our analyses focus on controls for non-EGU and area sources. Future technology 
developments in sectors not analyzed here (e.g., EGUs) may be transferrable to non-EGU and 
area sources, making these sources more viable for achieving future attainment at a lower cost. 
These same future technology developments may also make the sectors not analyzed here 
(e.g., EGUs) more viable for achieving future attainment at a lower cost. There are many 
examples in which technological innovation and “learning by doing” have made it possible to 
achieve greater emission reductions than had been feasible earlier, or have reduced the costs 
 7-13 
of emission control in relation to original estimates. Studies have concluded that costs of some 
EPA programs have been less than originally estimated, due in part to EPA’s inability to predict 
and account for future technological innovation in regulatory impact analyses.11 Technological 
change will affect baseline conditions for our analysis. This change may lead to potential 
improvements in the efficiency with which firms produce goods and services; for example, firms 
may use less energy to produce the same quantities of output. 
Constantly increasing marginal abatement costs are likely to induce the type of 
innovation that would result in lower costs than estimated in this chapter. By 2020, 
breakthrough technologies in control equipment could result in a downward shift in the 
marginal abatement cost curve for such equipment (Figure 7-1)12 as well as a decrease in its 
slope, reducing marginal costs per unit of abatement. In addition, elevated abatement costs 
may result in significant increases in the cost of production and would likely induce production 
efficiencies, in particular those related to energy inputs, which would lower emissions from the 
production side. EPA requests comment on how marginal control costs for specific technology 
applications may have changed over the past 20 years.

7.3.1 Examples of Technological Advances in Pollution Control 
There are numerous examples of low-emission technologies developed and/or 
commercialized over the past 15 or 20 years, such as 
 Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and ultra-low NOx burners for NOx emissions 
 Scrubbers, which achieve 95% and potentially greater SO2 control on boilers 
 Sophisticated new valve seals and leak detection equipment for refineries and 
chemical plants 
 Low- or zero-VOC paints, consumer products and cleaning processes 
 Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) free air conditioners, refrigerators, and solvents 
 Water- and powder-based coatings to replace petroleum-based formulations 
 Vehicles are much cleaner than believed possible in the late 1980s due to 
improvements in evaporative controls, catalyst design and fuel control systems for 
light-duty vehicles; and treatment devices and retrofit technologies for heavy-duty 
engines 
 Idle-reduction technologies for engines, including truck stop electrification efforts 
 Market penetration of gas-electric hybrid vehicles, and clean fuels 
 The development of retrofit technology to reduce emissions from in-use vehicles 
and non-road equipment 
These technologies were not commercially available 2 decades ago, and some did not 
even exist. Yet today, all of these technologies are on the market, and many are widely 
employed. Several are key components of major pollution control programs. 
What is known as “learning by doing” or “learning curve impacts,” which is a concept 
distinct from technological innovation, have also made it possible to achieve greater emissions 
reductions than had been feasible earlier, or have reduced the costs of emission control in 
relation to original estimates. Learning curve impacts can be defined generally as the extent to 
which variable costs (of production and/or pollution control) decline as firms gain experience 
with a specific technology. Impacts such as these would manifest themselves as a lowering of 
expected costs for operation of technologies in the future below what they may have been. 
 7-15 
The magnitude of learning curve impacts on pollution control costs has been estimated 
for a variety of sectors as part of the cost analyses done for the Draft Direct Cost Report for the 
second EPA Section 812 Prospective Analysis of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.13 In 
that report, learning curve adjustments were included for those sectors and technologies for 
which learning curve data was available. A typical learning curve adjustment example is to 
reduce either capital or O&M costs by a certain percentage given a doubling of output from 
that sector or for that technology. In other words, capital or O&M costs will be reduced by 
some percentage for every doubling of output for the given sector or technology. 
T.P. Wright, in 1936, was the first to characterize the relationship between increased 
productivity and cumulative production. He analyzed man-hours required to assemble 
successive airplane bodies. He suggested the relationship is a log linear function, since he 
observed a constant linear reduction in man-hours every time the total number of airplanes 
assembled was doubled. The relationship he devised between number assembled and assembly 
time is called Wright’s Equation (Gumerman and Marnay, 2004).14 This equation, shown below, 
has been shown to be widely applicable in manufacturing: 
 Wright’s Equation: CN = Co * Nb, (7.2) 
where: 
N = cumulative production 
CN = cost to produce Nth unit of capacity 
Co = cost to produce the first unit 
b = learning parameter = ln (1-LR)/ln(2), where 
LR = learning by doing rate, or cost reduction per doubling of capacity or output. 
The percentage adjustments to costs can range from 5 to 20 percent, depending on the 
sector and technology. Learning curve adjustments were prepared in a memo by IEc supplied to 
US EPA and applied for the mobile source sector (both onroad and nonroad) and for application

of various EGU control technologies within the Draft Direct Cost Report.15 Advice received from 
the SAB Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis in June 2007 indicated an interest in 
expanding the treatment of learning curves to those portions of the cost analysis for which no 
learning curve impact data are currently available. Examples of these sectors are non-EGU point 
sources and area sources. The memo by IEc outlined various approaches by which learning 
curve impacts can be addressed for those sectors. The recommended learning curve impact 
adjustment for virtually every sector considered in the Draft Direct Cost Report is a 10% 
reduction in O&M costs for two doublings of cumulative output, with proxies such as 
cumulative fuel sales or cumulative emission reductions being used when output data was 
unavailable. 
For this RIA, we do not have the necessary data for cumulative output, fuel sales, or 
emission reductions for all sectors included in our analysis in order to properly generate control 
costs that reflect learning curve impacts. Clearly, the effect of including these impacts would be 
to lower our estimates of costs for our control strategies in 2020, but we are not able to include 
such an analysis in this RIA. 
7.3.2 Influence on Regulatory Cost Estimates 
Studies indicate that it is not uncommon for pre-regulatory cost estimates to be higher 
than later estimates, in part because of an inability to predict technological advances. Over 
longer time horizons, the opportunity for technical advances is greater. 
7.3.2.1 Multi-Rule Study 
Harrington et al. of Resources for the Future (RFF)16 conducted an analysis of the 
predicted and actual costs of 28 federal and state rules, including 21 issued by EPA and the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and found a tendency for predicted 
costs to overstate actual implementation costs. Costs were considered accurate if they fell 
within the analysis error bounds or if they fall within 25 percent (greater or less than) of the 
predicted amount. They found that predicted total costs were overestimated for 14 of the 28 
rules, while total costs were underestimated for only three rules. Differences can result 
because of quantity differences (e.g., overestimate of pollution reductions) or differences in 
per-unit costs (e.g., cost per unit of pollution reduction). Per-unit costs of regulations were

overestimated in 14 cases, while they were underestimated in six cases. In the case of EPA 
rules, the Agency overestimated per-unit costs for five regulations, underestimated them for 
four regulations (three of these were relatively small pesticide rules), and accurately estimated 
them for four. Based on examination of eight economic incentive rules, “for those rules that 
employed economic incentive mechanisms, overestimation of per-unit costs seems to be the 
norm,” the study said. It is worth noting here that the controls applied for this NAAQS do not 
use an economic incentive mechanism. In addition, Harrington et al. also states that 
overestimation of total costs can be due to error in the quantity of emission reductions 
achieved, which would also cause the benefits to be overestimated. A 2010 update to this study 
by Harrington et al. of RFF showed that EPA and other regulatory agencies tend to overestimate 
the total costs of regulations; their estimates of the cost per-unit of pollution eliminated by 
regulations tend to be more accurate, however. Calculations of the total cost of regulation 
include not only the “unit costs” multiplied by the number of units of pollution avoided, but 
also estimates of the basic adjustment process and costs of change itself. Of the rules initially 
examined, 14 projected inflated total costs, while pre-regulation estimates were too low for 
only three rules. These exaggerated adjustment costs are often attributable to underestimates 
of the potential that technological change could minimize pollution abatement costs.17 
Based on the case study results and existing literature, the authors identified 
technological innovation as one of five explanations of why predicted and actual regulatory cost 
estimates differ: “Most regulatory cost estimates ignore the possibility of technological 
innovation … Technical change is, after all, notoriously difficult to forecast … In numerous case 
studies actual compliance costs are lower than predicted because of unanticipated use of new 
technology.” 
It should be noted that many (though not all) of the EPA rules examined by Harrington 
et al. had compliance dates of several years, which allowed a limited period for technical 
innovation.

7.3.2.2 Acid Rain SO2 Trading Program 
Recent cost estimates of the Acid Rain SO2 trading program by RFF and MIT have been 
as much as 83 percent lower than originally projected by EPA.18 As noted in the RIA for the 
Clean Air Interstate Rule, the ex ante numbers in 1989 were an overestimate in part because of 
the limitation of economic modeling to predict technological improvement of pollution controls 
and other compliance options, such as fuel switching. The fuel switching from high-sulfur to 
low-sulfur coal was spurred by a reduction in rail transportation costs due to deregulation of 
rail rates during the 1990’s. Harrington et al. report that scrubbing turned out to be more 
efficient (95% removal vs. 80–85% removal) and more reliable (95% vs. 85% reliability) than 
expected, and that unanticipated opportunities arose to blend low- and high-sulfur coal in older 
boilers up to a 40/60 mixture, compared with the 5/95 mixture originally estimated.

A 2002 study by two economists with EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality19 
examined EPA vehicle and fuels rules and found a general pattern that “all ex ante estimates 
tended to exceed actual price impacts, with the EPA estimates exceeding actual prices by the 
smallest amount.” The paper notes that cost is not the same as price, but suggests that a 
comparison nonetheless can be instructive.20 An example focusing on fuel rules is provided in

Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) Phase-Out: EPA used a combination of regulatory, market-
based (i.e., a cap-and-trade system among manufacturers), and voluntary approaches to phase 
out the most harmful ozone depleting substances. This was done more efficiently than either 
EPA or industry originally anticipated. The phase out for Class I substances was implemented  
4–6 years faster, included 13 more chemicals, and cost 30 percent less than was predicted at 
the time the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted.21 
The Harrington et al. study states, “When the original cost analysis was performed for 
the CFC phase-out it was not anticipated that the hydrofluorocarbon HFC-134a could be 
substituted for CFC-12 in refrigeration. However, as Hammit22 notes, ‘since 1991 most new U.S.

automobile air conditioners have contained HFC-134a (a compound for which no commercial 
production technology was available in 1986) instead of CFC-12” (p.13). He cites a similar story 
for HCFRC-141b and 142b, which are currently substituting for CFC-11 in important foam-
blowing applications.” 
Additional examples of decreasing costs of emissions controls include: SCR catalyst costs 
decreasing from $11k-$14k/m3 in 1998 to $3.5k-$5k/m3 in 2004, and improved low NOx burners 
reduced emissions by 50% from 1993–2003 while the associated capital cost dropped from $25-
$38/kW to $15/kW.23 Also, FGD scrubber capital costs have been estimated to have decreased 
by more than 50 percent from 1976 to 2005, and the O&M costs decreased by more than 50% 
from 1982 to 2005. Many process improvements contributed to lowering the capital costs, 
especially improved understanding and control of process chemistry, improved materials of 
construction, simplified absorber designs, and other factors that improved reliability.24 
We cannot estimate the precise interplay between EPA regulation and technology 
improvement, but it is clear that a priori cost estimation often results in overestimation of costs 
because changes in technology (whatever the cause) make less costly control possible. 
7.3.3 Influence of Regulation on Technological Change 
We cannot estimate the interplay between EPA regulation and technology improvement 
but have reason to believe it may be significant. There is emerging research on technology-
forcing polices (i.e., where a regulator specifies a policy standard that cannot be met with 
existing technology or met with existing technology but not at an acceptable cost, and over 
time market demand will provide incentives for industry to develop the appropriate 
technology). This is illustrated by Gerard and Lave (2005). Therein, they demonstrate through a 
careful policy history that the 1970 CAA legislated dramatic improvements in the reduction of 
emissions for 1975 and 1976 automobiles. Those mandated improvements went beyond the 
capabilities of existing technologies. But the regulatory pressure “pulled” forth or “forced” 
catalytic converting technology in 1975. 
Work for EPA by RTI in 2011 studied the relationship between patents and the SO2 cap-
and-trade program. This preliminary, non-peer reviewed study seems to indicate that patents

may be related to SO2 regulatory actions and drops in the long-term SO2 allowance price. Popp 
(2003) and Keohane (2002) have both provided empirical evidence that Title IV led to induced 
technological change. Popp provides evidence that since Title IV there has been technological 
innovations that have improved the removal efficiency of scrubbers. Keohane provides 
evidence that fossil-fuel fired electric utilities that were subject to Title IV were, for a given 
increase in the cost of switching to low sulfur coal, more likely to install a scrubber. 
7.4 Uncertainties and Limitations 
EPA bases its estimates of emission control costs on the best available information from 
available engineering studies of air pollution controls and developed a reliable modeling 
framework for analyzing the cost, emission changes, and other impacts of regulatory controls. 
However, our cost analysis is subject to uncertainties and limitations, which we document on a 
qualitative basis in Table 7-7 below. For additional discussion of how we assess uncertainty, see

APPENDIX 7.A 
OTHER EXTRAPOLATED COST APPROACHES 
7.A.1 Extrapolated Cost Equations 
The hybrid methodology creates a total cost curve for each pollutant for unknown 
future controls that might be used in order to move toward 2020 attainment. This approach 
explicitly estimates the cost of removing emissions for each pollutant for each area, with a 
higher cost-per-ton in areas needing a higher proportion of unknown controls relative to known 
modeled controls. For each pollutant in each area, the cost begins with a national constant 
cost-per-ton for that pollutant and increases as more of that pollutant is selected. The selection 
is made so that costs are minimized. The incremental improvement in air quality for an 
unknown control is determined, by pollutant, using an area-by-area ratio of air quality 
improvement to air quality change multiplied by the emission reductions from unknown 
controls for each pollutant and area. For each pollutant in an area, the per-unit costs of control 
increase with each additional unit of that pollutant chosen. The choices are made to minimize 
total cost.  
The hybrid methodology has the advantage of using the information about how 
significant the needed reductions from unspecified control technologies are relative to the 
known control measures and matching that with expected increasing per-unit cost for applying 
controls beyond those modeled. Under this approach, the relative costs of unknown controls in 
different geographic areas reflect the expectation that average per-ton control costs are likely 
to be higher in areas needing a higher ratio of emission reductions from unknown to known 
controls. Because no cost data exists for unknown future strategies, it is unclear whether 
approaches using hypothetical cost curves will be more accurate or less accurate in forecasting 
total national costs of unknown controls than a fixed-cost approach that uses a range of 
national cost-per-ton values. Extrapolated cost estimates are provided using a 7 percent 
discount rate because known control measure information is available at 7 percent for all 
measures applied in the analysis.  
7.A.1.1 Theoretical Model for Hybrid Methodology 
A model of increasing total costs was developed for each pollutant. The simplest form of 
ax2 + bx + c was used where x is the tons of a particular pollutant to be reduced in a particular 
area and a, b, and c are constants. For the hybrid methodology b is set to be a national, initial 
cost-per-ton (N) for unknown controls for a pollutant, and c is zero because there is no cost to 
 7.A-2 
imposing no control. The hybrid methodology has a different a for each pollutant and 
geographical area. For a particular geographic area and pollutant a is N/E where 
N = national, initial cost/ton (b from above) 
E = by geographic area and by pollutant, is the denominator1 and represents all 
emission reductions estimated to be required (from applying known and 
unknown controls to obtain the 15/35 baseline, as well as known controls to 
achieve the alternative standard) prior to estimating needed emission reductions 
from unknown controls to achieve the alternative standard.  
The hybrid methodology attempts to consider the varying conditions in each geographic 
area exceeding the alternative standard. Using the hybrid methodology, we develop marginal 
control cost curves associated with unknown control costs for each geographic area. Because 
the rate at which the unknown control costs increase varies across areas, the marginal cost will 
vary. For example, applying unknown controls to obtain the needed emission reductions in a 
geographic area with few emissions sources, very few known controls and many emission 
reductions needed will have a higher marginal cost. Where in another circumstance, applying 
unknown controls to obtain the needed emission reductions in a geographic area with many 
emissions sources, many known controls and many emission reductions needed will have a 
lower marginal cost. 
The total cost equations presented below in Section 7.A.1.2 are used with the constraint 
that 
 𝑄 − 𝑅𝑆𝑂2𝑈𝑆𝑂2 −  𝑅𝑃𝑀2.5𝑈𝑃𝑀2.5 −  𝑅𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑈𝑁𝑂𝑥 = 0 (7.1) 
where 
U = unknown emission reductions 
Q = air quality change needed for area to reach attainment 
R = air quality to emissions ratio for area. 
This equation above uses the R developed in Section 3.3.1.3 (Estimating Full Attainment) 
for each pollutant and area that is used to estimate the change in air quality for each unit of 
emissions. In other words, R is a measure of how much the air quality concentration changes 
                                                     
1 The numerator differs by pollutant and is the national, initial cost-per-ton for unknown controls discussed below, 
e.g., $17,000/ton for PM2.5. 
 7.A-3 
when the emissions change. The least-cost solution is found for each geographic area and for 
each standard. See Section 4.2.2 for a discussion of the order in which controls were applied for 
geographic areas and pollutants.  
The cost-per-ton estimates were calculated by developing marginal cost curves for all 
known controls applied for the alternative standards as well as the baseline. We reviewed data 
on controls in approximately 120 counties with higher PM2.5 concentrations. We plotted, in 
order of increasing marginal cost, the cost-per-ton and cumulative emission reductions 
associated with these controls for PM2.5, SO2, and NOx. For PM2.5, the data show that 
approximately 96 percent of potential emission reductions associated with the known controls 
in those 120 counties could be obtained for $17,000/ton (2006 dollars) or less. For SO2, the data 
show that approximately 94 percent of potential emission reductions associated with the 
known controls in those 120 counties could be obtained for $5,400/ton (2006 dollars) or less. 
For NOx, the data show that approximately 92 percent of potential emission reductions 
associated with the known controls in those 120 counties could be obtained for $5,500/ton 
(2006 dollars) or less. We conservatively defined a threshold of 90 percent for unknown 
emission reductions for a particular pollutant in an area after reductions associated with known 
controls are achieved. As such, the national, initial cost-per-ton for unknown controls for the 
parameters NPM2.5, NSO2, and 𝑁NOx were chosen at $17,000/ton (2006 dollars), $5,400/ton (2006 
dollars), and $5,500/ton (2006 dollars) for PM2.5, SO2, and NOx emission reductions, 
respectively.  
The results for the alternative hybrid methodology described in this Appendix and the 
fixed-cost approach described in Chapter 7 are presented for comparison in Table 7.A-1.

The constraints require the emissions changes to result in the required air quality 
change. The emissions changes cannot be negative. The unknown emission reductions for a 
particular pollutant in an area cannot exceed 90% of the remaining emissions after reductions 
associated with known controls are achieved. Section 7.2.3.1 includes information on the 
selection of the 90% threshold. 
where 
N = national constant cost/ton 
E = known emission reductions 
U = unknown emission reductions 
Q = air quality change 
R = air quality to emissions ratio 
T = total emissions 
This optimization can be executed in a number of ways (all resulting in the same 
answer). For this analysis we employed the data solver add-in (solver) for Microsoft Excel. We 
ran the solver for each area needing unknown controls for each standard. The detailed 
spreadsheet will be in the PM NAAQS docket. 
7.A.1.3 Cost Minimization Approach 
The solver iterates to select how much of each pollutant to choose in a cost-minimizing 
manner. In each geographic area with one or more counties that requires additional emission 
reductions to reach attainment, to select a quantity of each pollutant to minimize the costs of 
the needed emissions reductions, the solver 
 looks simultaneously at PM2.5 emissions within any counties not meeting the 
standard and SO2 and NOx emissions from within the geographic area. 
For example, for a three-county area where two counties are not estimated to meet the 
alternative standard, the solver picks PM2.5 reductions in each of the two counties and then SO2 
 7.A-6 
and NOx reductions for the entire geographic area such that both counties would reach 
attainment in the least cost way. 
In Chapter 3, we define ratios for each of the two counties associated with how much 
air quality concentration improvement would result from 1,000 tons of PM2.5 reduction in each 
respective county. Also in Chapter 3, we define ratios for each of the two counties associated 
with how much air quality concentration improvement would result from 1,000 tons of SO2 
reduction in the defined geographic area (not just the respective counties). Lastly in Chapter 3, 
we define ratios for each of the two counties associated with how much air quality 
concentration improvement would result from 1,000 tons of NOx reduction in the defined 
geographic area (not just the respective county). In Chapters 3 and 4, we define and present 
geographic areas where SO2 and NOx emissions contribute to the air quality problems in a close 
cluster of counties.  
7.A.2 Sensitivity Analyses of Extrapolated Cost Approaches 
Because of the uncertainties associated with estimating costs for the PM2.5 NAAQS and 
because a significant portion of the estimated emissions reductions and related costs for 
attaining the NAAQS come from unknown controls, it is important to test the sensitivity of the 
assumptions applied to estimate unknown controls. The sensitivity analyses below are included 
to help characterize the uncertainty for the cost estimates from unknown controls and the 
responsiveness of the cost estimates to varying parameter estimates and assumptions. Note 
that the tables below include cost estimates associated with unknown controls and not total 
cost estimates. 
While there are many approaches to sensitivity analysis, we selected analyses below, 
keeping emissions estimates constant, to show variability in the cost estimates and remain 
consistent with the benefits analysis. Note that the extrapolated cost estimates are provided 
using a 7 percent discount rate because known control measure information is available at 7 
percent for all measures applied in this analysis.  
7.A.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis of Fixed-Cost Approach 
Table 7.A.2 below presents the sensitivity analysis of the fixed-cost approach and 
includes, by region and alternative standard, the primary cost estimate of $15,000/ton. The 
Table also includes, by region and alternative standard, cost estimates using $10,000/ton and 
$20,000/ton. For the 12/35 alternative standard, the total cost estimate associated with 
unknown control costs ranges from $46 million to $92 million, depending on the fixed-cost-per-
ton assumed.

NPM2.5, NSO2, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑵NOx were chosen at $17,000/ton (2006 dollars), $5,400/ton (2006 dollars), and $5,500/ton 
(2006 dollars) for PM2.5, SO2, and NOx emission reductions, respectively. In addition, as discussed in Chapter 7, 
Section 7.2.3, the hybrid cost methodology is used to estimate the needed emission reductions. 
d These estimates reflect national, initial cost-per ton estimates for the three parameters that are 30 percent 
higher.

CHAPTER 8 
COMPARISON OF BENEFITS AND COSTS 
8.1 Synopsis 
This chapter compares estimates of the benefits with economic costs and summarizes 
the net benefits of alternative standards relative to a baseline that includes recently 
promulgated national regulations (CSAPR, MATS, and others). We include a discussion of net 
benefits for the case of full attainment and discuss selected limitations of the analyses. 
8.2 Analysis 
In the analysis, we estimate the net benefits of the proposed range of annual PM2.5 
standards of 12/35 to 13/35. For 12/35, net benefits are estimated to be $2.3 billion to $5.9 
billion at a 3% discount rate and $2.0 billion to $5.3 billion at a 7% discount rate in 2020 (2006 
dollars).1 For 13/35, net benefits are estimated to be $85 million to $220 million at the 3% 
discount rate and $76 million to $200 million at the 7% discount rate. 
The RIA also analyzes the benefits and costs of two alternative primary PM2.5 standards 
(11/35 and 11/30) that are more stringent than the proposed standard range of 12/35 to 13/35. 
The EPA estimated the net benefits of the alternative annual PM2.5 standard of 11/35 to be $8.9 
billion to $23 billion at a 3% discount rate and $8.0 billion to $21 billion at a 7% discount rate in 
2020. The EPA estimated the net benefits of the alternative annual PM2.5 standard of 11/30 to 
be $14 billion to $36 billion at a 3% discount rate and $13 billion to $33 billion at a 7% discount 
rate in 2020. All estimates are in 2006$.2 
The EPA determined that all counties would meet the 14/35 standard concurrently with 
meeting the existing 15/35 standard at no additional cost. Consequently, there is no need to 
present an analysis of 14/35 in this RIA. 
We provide these results in Table 8-1. In Table 8-2, we provide the avoided health 
incidences associated with these standard levels. 
                                                     
1 Using a 2010$ year increases estimated costs and benefits by approximately 8%. Because of data limitations, we 
were unable to discount compliance costs for all sectors at 3%. As a result, the net benefit calculations at 3% 
were computed by subtracting the monetized benefits at 3% minus the costs at 7%. 
2 Using a 2010 $ year increases estimated costs and benefits by approximately 8%. Because of data limitations, we

8.3 Conclusions of the Analysis 
EPA’s illustrative analysis has estimated the health and welfare benefits and costs 
associated with proposed revised PM NAAQS. The results for 2020 suggest there will be 
significant health and welfare benefits and these benefits will outweigh the costs associated 
with the illustrative control strategies in 2020.

a Rounded to two significant figures. Using a 2010$ year increases estimated costs and benefits by approximately 
8%. 
b The reduction in premature deaths each year accounts for over 90% of total monetized benefits. Mortality risk 
valuation assumes discounting over the SAB-recommended 20-year segmented lag structure. Not all possible 
benefits or disbenefits are quantified and monetized in this analysis. B is the sum of all unquantified benefits. 
Data limitations prevented us from quantifying these endpoints, and as such, these benefits are inherently more 
uncertain than those benefits that we were able to quantify. 
c Due to data limitations, we were unable to discount compliance costs for all sectors at 3%. As a result, the net 
benefit calculations at 3% were computed by subtracting the monetized benefits at 3% minus the costs at 7%. 
For the lower end of the proposed standard range of 12/35, the EPA estimates that the 
benefits of full attainment exceed the costs of full attainment by 34 to 86 times at a 3% 
discount rate and 30 to 78 times at a 7% discount rate. For the upper end of the proposed 
standard range of 13/35, the EPA estimates that the benefits of full attainment exceed the 
costs of full attainment by 30 to 77 times at a 3% discount rate and 27 to 69 times at a 7% 
discount rate. For the alternative standards, 11/35 and 11/30, the EPA estimates that the 
benefits of full attainment exceed the costs of full attainment by 34 to 94 times at a 3% 
discount rate and 30 to 85 times at a 7% discount rate.

8.4 Caveats and Limitations 
EPA acknowledges several important limitations of the primary and secondary analysis. 
These include: 
8.4.1 Benefits Caveats 
 PM2.5 mortality co-benefits represent a substantial proportion of total monetized 
benefits (over 98%). To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between 
PM2.5 and premature mortality, we include a set of twelve estimates based on 
results of the PM2.5 mortality expert elicitation study in addition to our core 
estimates. Even these multiple characterizations omit the uncertainty in air quality 
estimates, baseline incidence rates, populations exposed, and transferability of the 
effect estimate to diverse locations. As a result, the reported confidence intervals 
and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the overall uncertainty in 
the PM2.5 estimates. This information should be interpreted within the context of the 
larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. 
 Most of the estimated avoided premature deaths occur at or above the lowest 
measured PM2.5 concentration in the two studies used to estimate mortality 
 8-4 
benefits. In general, we have greater confidence in risk estimates based on PM2.5 
concentrations where the bulk of the data reside and somewhat less confidence 
where data density is lower. 
 We analyzed full attainment in 2020, and projecting key variables introduces 
uncertainty. Inherent in any analysis of future regulatory programs are uncertainties 
in projecting atmospheric conditions and source-level emissions, as well as 
population, health baselines, incomes, technology, and other factors. 
 There are uncertainties related to the health impact functions used in the analysis. 
These include within-study variability; pooling across studies; the application of C-R 
functions nationwide and for all particle species; extrapolation of impact functions 
across populations; and various uncertainties in the C-R function, including causality 
and shape of the function at low concentrations. Therefore, benefits may be under- 
or over-estimates. 
 This analysis omits certain unquantified effects due to lack of data, time, and 
resources. These unquantified endpoints include other health and ecosystem 
effects. The EPA will continue to evaluate new methods and models and select those 
most appropriate for estimating the benefits of reductions in air pollution.  
8.4.2 Control Strategy and Cost Analysis Caveats and Limitations 
Control Technology Data 
 Technologies applied may not reflect emerging devices that may be available in 
future years. 
 Control efficiency data depend on equipment being well maintained. 
 Area source controls assume a constant estimate of emission reductions, despite 
variability in extent and scale of application. 
Control Strategy Development 
 States may develop different control strategies than the ones illustrated. 
 Data on baseline controls from current SIPs are lacking. 
 Timing of control strategies may be different than envisioned in the RIA. 
 Controls are applied within the county with the violating monitor. It is possible that 
additional known controls could be available in a wider geographical area. 
 Unknown controls were needed to reach attainment in several counties. Costs 
associated with these unknown controls were estimated using a fixed cost per ton 
methodology as well as an extrapolated cost methodology. 
 Emissions reductions from mobile sources, EGUs, other PM2.5 precursors (i.e., 
ammonia and VOC), and voluntary programs are not reflected in the analyses. 
 8-5 
Technological Change 
 Emission reductions do not reflect potential effects of technological change that may 
be available in future years. 
 Effects of “learning by doing” are not accounted for in the emission reduction 
estimates. 
 Future technology developments in sectors not analyzed here (e.g., EGUs) may be 
transferrable to non-EGU and area sources, making these sources more viable for 
achieving future attainment at a lower cost than the cost presented in this analysis. 
Engineering Cost Estimates 
 Because of data limitations, we were unable to discount compliance costs for all 
sectors at 3%.  
 Estimates of private compliance cost are used as a proxy for social cost.  
Unquantified Costs 
 A number of costs remain unquantified, including administration costs of federal and 
state SIP programs, and transactional costs.

CHAPTER 9 
STATUTORY AND EXECUTIVE ORDER REVIEWS 
9.1 Synopsis 
This chapter summarizes the Statutory and Executive Order (EO) impact analyses 
relevant for the PM NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis. For each EO and Statutory requirement 
we describe both the requirements and the way in which our analysis addresses these 
requirements. 
9.2 Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review 
Under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), this 
action is an “economically significant regulatory action” because it is likely to have an annual 
effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Accordingly, the EPA submitted this action to 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Orders 12866 and 
13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011), and any changes made in response to OMB 
recommendations have been documented in the docket for this action. 
9.3 Paperwork Reduction Act 
This action does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of 
the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.S. 3501 et seq. Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b). 
There are no information collection requirements directly associated with revisions to a NAAQS 
under section 109 of the CAA. 
9.4 Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under 
the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule 
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small 
entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. 
For purposes of assessing the impacts of this rule on small entities, small entity is 
defined as: (1) a small business that is a small industrial entity as defined by the Small Business 
Administration’s (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that 
is a government of a city, county, town, school district or special district with a population of 
less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is 
independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field. 
 9-2 
After considering the economic impacts of this proposed rule on small entities, I certify 
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. This proposed rule will not impose any requirements on small entities. Rather, this rule 
establishes national standards for allowable concentrations of particulate matter in ambient air 
as required by section 109 of the CAA. See also American Trucking Associations v. EPA. 175 F.3d 
at 1044-45 (NAAQS do not have significant impacts upon small entities because NAAQS 
themselves impose no regulations upon small entities). Please refer to the preamble for 
additional details. 
9.5 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
This action contains no Federal mandates under the provisions of Title II of the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538 for state, local, or tribal 
governments or the private sector. The action imposes no enforceable duty on any state, local 
or tribal governments or the private sector. Therefore, this action is not subject to the 
requirements of sections 202 or 205 of the UMRA. 
This action is also not subject to the requirements section 205 of the UMRA because it 
contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. This action imposes no new expenditure or enforceable duty on any state, local, 
or tribal governments or the private sector, and the EPA has determined that this rule contains 
no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. 
Furthermore, in setting a NAAQS, the EPA cannot consider the economic or 
technological feasibility of attaining ambient air quality standards, although such factors may be 
considered to a degree in the development of state plans to implement the standards. See also 
American Trucking Associations v. EPA, 175 F. 3d at 1043 (noting that because the EPA is 
precluded from considering costs of implementation in establishing NAAQS, preparation of a 
Regulatory Impact Analysis pursuant to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act would not furnish 
any information which the court could consider in reviewing the NAAQS). The EPA 
acknowledges, however, that any corresponding revisions to associated SIP requirements and 
air quality surveillance requirements, 40 CFR part 51 and 40 CFR part 58, respectively, might 
result in such effects. Accordingly, the EPA will address, as appropriate, unfunded mandates if 
and when it proposes any revisions to 40 CFR parts 51 or 58. 
9.6 Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct 
effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or 
 9-3 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as 
specified in Executive Order 13132. The rule does not alter the relationship between the 
Federal government and the states regarding the establishment and implementation of air 
quality improvement programs as codified in the CAA. Under section 109 of the CAA, the EPA is 
mandated to establish and review NAAQS; however, CAA section 116 preserves the rights of 
states to establish more stringent requirements if deemed necessary by a state. Furthermore, 
this proposed rule does not impact CAA section 107 which establishes that the states have 
primary responsibility for implementation of the NAAQS. Finally, as noted in section D on UMRA 
in the preamble, this rule does not impose significant costs on state, local, or Tribal 
governments or the private sector. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this action. 
However, as also noted in section D on UMRA in the preamble, the EPA recognizes that 
states will have a substantial interest in this rule and any corresponding revisions to associated 
air quality surveillance requirements, 40 CFR part 58. Please refer to the preamble for 
additional details on the Executive Order. 
9.7 Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments 
The action does not have tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175 (65 
FR 67249, November 9, 2000). It does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian 
Tribes, since Tribes are not obligated to adopt or implement any NAAQS. The Tribal Authority 
Rule gives Tribes the opportunity to develop and implement CAA programs such as the PM 
NAAQS, but it leaves to the discretion of the Tribe whether to develop these programs and 
which programs, or appropriate elements of a program, they will adopt. Thus, Executive Order 
13175 does not apply to this rule. 
Although Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this rule, the EPA consulted with 
tribal officials or other representatives of tribal governments in developing this action. Please 
refer to the preamble for additional details on the Executive Order. 
9.8 Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children from Environmental Health and Safety 
Risks 
This action is subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it 
is an economically significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866, and the 
EPA believes that the environmental health or safety risk addressed by this action may have a 
disproportionate effect on children. Accordingly, we have evaluated the environmental health 
or safety effects of PM exposures on children. The protection offered by these standards may 
 9-4 
be especially important for children because childhood represents a lifestage associated with 
increased susceptibility to PM-related health effects. Because children have been identified as a 
susceptible population, we have carefully evaluated the environmental health effects of 
exposure to PM pollution among children. Discussions of the results of the evaluation of the 
scientific evidence and policy considerations pertaining to children are contained in sections 
III.B, III.D, IV.B, and IV.C of the preamble. A listing of documents that contain the evaluation of 
scientific evidence and policy considerations that pertain to children is found in the section on 
Children’s Environmental Health in the Supplementary Information section of the preamble, 
and a copy of all documents have been placed in the public docket for this action. 
9.9 Executive Order 13211: Actions that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution or 
Use 
This action is not a “significant energy action” as defined in Executive Order 13211, (66 
FR 28355, May 22, 2001) because it is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy. The purpose of this action concerns the review of the 
NAAQS for PM. The action does not prescribe specific pollution control strategies by which 
these ambient standards will be met. Such strategies are developed by states on a case-by-case 
basis, and the EPA cannot predict whether the control options selected by states will include 
regulations on energy suppliers, distributors, or users. 
9.10 National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act 
Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 
(NTTAA), Public Law 104– 113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs the EPA to use 
voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent 
with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical 
standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business 
practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA 
directs the EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not 
to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. 
This proposed rulemaking involves technical standards for environmental monitoring 
and measurement. Specifically, the EPA proposes to retain the indicators for fine (PM2.5) and 
coarse (PM10) particles. The indicator for fine particles is measured using the Reference 
Method for the Determination of Fine Particulate Matter as PM2.5 in the Atmosphere (appendix 
L to 40 CFR part 50), which is known as the PM2.5 FRM, and the indicator for coarse particles is 
measured using the Reference Method for the Determination of Particulate Matter as PM10 in 
 9-5 
the Atmosphere (appendix J to 40 CFR part 50), which is known as the PM10 FRM. The EPA also 
proposes a separate secondary standard defined in terms of a calculated PM2.5 light extinction 
indicator, which would use PM2.5 mass species and relative humidity data to calculate PM2.5 
light extinction. 
To the extent feasible, the EPA employs a Performance-Based Measurement System 
(PBMS), which does not require the use of specific, prescribed analytic methods. The PBMS is 
defined as a set of processes wherein the data quality needs, mandates or limitations of a 
program or project are specified, and serve as criteria for selecting appropriate methods to 
meet those needs in a cost-effective manner. It is intended to be more flexible and cost 
effective for the regulated community; it is also intended to encourage innovation in analytical 
technology and improved data quality. Though the FRM defines the particular specifications for 
ambient monitors, there is some variability with regard to how monitors measure PM, 
depending on the type and size of PM and environmental conditions. Therefore, it is not 
practically possible to fully define the FRM in performance terms to account for this variability. 
Nevertheless, our approach in the past has resulted in multiple brands of monitors being 
approved as FRM for PM, and we expect this to continue. Also, the FRMs described in 40 CFR 
part 50 and the equivalency criteria described in 40 CFR part 53, constitute a performance-
based measurement system for PM, since methods that meet the field testing and performance 
criteria can be approved as FEMs. Since finalized in 2006 (71 FR, 61236, October 17, 2006) the 
new field and performance criteria for approval of PM2.5 continuous FEMs has resulted in the 
approval of six approved FEMs. In summary, for measurement of PM2.5 and PM10, the EPA 
relies on both FRMs and FEMs, with FEMs relying on a PBMS approach for their approval. The 
EPA is not precluding the use of any other method, whether it constitutes a voluntary 
consensus standard or not, as long as it meets the specified performance criteria. 
For the proposed distinct secondary standard defined in terms of a calculated PM2.5 light 
extinction indicator, the EPA proposes to use existing monitoring technologies that are already 
deployed in the CSN and IMPROVE monitoring programs as well as relative humidity data from 
sensors already deployed at routine weather stations. The sampling and analysis protocols in 
use in the CSN program are the result of substantial input and recommendations from CASAC 
both during their initial deployment about ten years ago, and during the more recent transition 
to carbon sampling that is consistent with IMPROVE protocols (Henderson 2005c). Monitoring 
agencies also played a strong role in directing the sampling technologies used in the CSN. 
During the first few years of implementing the CSN there were up to four different sampling 
approaches used in the network. Over time as monitoring agencies shared their experiences 
 9-6 
and data with each other, several agencies shifted their network operations to the sampling 
technology used today. By 2008, the EPA was working closely with all remaining monitoring 
agencies to transition to the current CSN sampling for ions and elements. All carbon sampling 
was fully transitioned to the current method by October of 2009 for consistency with the 
IMPROVE program. Therefore, while the current CSN sampling methods were not developed or 
adopted by a voluntary consensus standard body, they are the result of harmonizing the 
network by monitoring agency users and EPA. The CSN network and methods are described in 
more detail in the Policy Assessment (US EPA, 2011a, Appendix B, section B.1.3). 
9.11 Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority 
Populations and Low-Income Populations 
Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) establishes federal executive 
policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the greatest 
extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by 
identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health 
or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and 
low-income populations in the United States. 
The EPA maintains an ongoing commitment to ensure environmental justice for all 
people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income. Ensuring environmental justice 
means not only protecting human health and the environment for everyone, but also ensuring 
that all people are treated fairly and are given the opportunity to participate meaningfully in 
the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and 
policies. The EPA has identified potential disproportionately high and adverse effects on 
minority and/or low-income populations from this proposed rule. 
The EPA has identified persons from lower socioeconomic strata as a susceptible 
population for PM-related health effects. As a result, the EPA has carefully evaluated the 
potential impacts on low-income and minority populations as discussed in section III.E.3.a of 
the preamble. The Agency expects this proposed rule would lead to the establishment of 
uniform NAAQS for PM. The Integrated Science Assessment and Policy Assessment contain the 
evaluation of the scientific evidence and policy considerations that pertain to these 
populations. These documents are available as described in the Supplementary Information 
section of the preamble and copies of all documents have been placed in the public docket for 
this action.

CHAPTER 10 
SECONDARY STANDARDS ANALYSIS 
10.1 Introduction 
As defined by section 109(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the purpose of a secondary 
NAAQS standard is to protect public welfare against negative effects of criteria air pollutants, 
including decreased visibility, climate effects, and damage to ecological systems and building 
materials. Ambient PM has been associated with visibility impairment in diverse regions across 
the United States and is considered adverse to the public welfare. EPA is proposing a national 
visibility standard in conjunction with the Regional Haze Program as a means of achieving 
appropriate levels of protection against PM-related visibility impairments in urban, non-urban 
and Federal Class I areas across the country. EPA evaluated two proposed secondary standard 
levels of 30 deciviews (dv) and 28 dv, along with a more stringent standard level of 25 dv, based 
on 24-hour average speciated PM2.5 measurements and with a 3-year average, 90th percentile 
form.  
10.2 The Secondary NAAQS Standard 
The secondary PM2.5 NAAQS standard consists of three parts: a level, averaging period, 
and form. In the Urban-focused Visibility Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2010) and the Policy Assessment 
for the Review of the PM NAAQS (U.S. EPA, 2011), several preference studies provide the 
foundation for the secondary PM NAAQS.1 The three completed survey studies (all in the west) 
included Denver, Colorado (Ely et al., 1991), one in the lower Fraser River valley near 
Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), Canada (Pryor, 1996), and one in Phoenix, Arizona (BBC 
Research & Consulting, 2003). A pilot focus group study was conducted in Washington, DC on 
behalf of EPA to inform the 2006 PM NAAQS review (Abt Associates Inc., 2001). Using the 
results of these studies, EPA determined that for a majority of individuals, the range of 
acceptable urban visibility falls between 20 dv and 30 dv based on a 4-hour average indicator 
(U.S. EPA, 2011). For this analysis, we consider the two proposed standard levels of 30 dv and 
28 dv, both averaged over 24 hours, along with a more stringent 24-hour average standard 
level.2 While a sub-daily (i.e., 4-hour) averaging period would capture the wide variations in 
                                                     
1 For more detail about these preference studies, including information about study designs and sampling 
protocols, please see Section 2 of the Particulate Matter Urban-Focused Visibility Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2010b). 
2In order to provide generally equivalent protection, the level of a NAAQS based on a 24-hour average indicator 
should include an adjustment compared to the level that would be applied to a NAAQS based on a daily 
maximum daylight 4-hour average indicator. Using 15 study sites, EPA staff investigated five approaches to 
making this adjustment, for 4-hour indicator NAAQS levels of 20, 25, and 30 dv. An approach thought by EPA 
staff to be more appropriate for further consideration yielded adjusted NAAQS levels of 21, 25, and 28 dv as 
 10-2 
visibility conditions that occur over the course of a day, a 24-hour averaging period avoids data 
quality uncertainties associated with instruments currently available to measure hourly PM2.5 
mass (U.S. EPA, 2011).  
EPA proposes using a 3-year average, 90th percentile form for the standard. Determining 
attainment using this form requires comparing the level of the standard to the 3-year average 
of the 90th percentile of the measured indicator. Using a multi-year percentile form for the 
standard lessens the influence of unusual emissions values and provides a degree of stability for 
implementation planning (U.S. EPA, 2011). 
10.3 Visibility Benefits from PM Reduction3 
Visibility directly impacts the quality of life in the places where people live, work, and 
travel (U.S. EPA, 2009). Air pollution, including particulates, contributes to decreased visibility 
by scattering and absorbing light, which reduces visual range and clarity. PM2.5 component 
species that contribute to decreased visibility include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, 
elemental carbon, and soil (Sisler, 1996). Visibility impairment is expressed in terms of light 
extinction, measured in inverse megameters (Mm-1), or in terms of the deciview haze index, 
which is calculated based on total light extinction (Pitchford and Malm, 1994). A change of one 
dv is believed to be the smallest change in visible air quality perceptible by the human eye 
(Pitchford and Malm, 1994). 
Visibility conditions and sources of visibility impairment vary both by region and season. 
Humidity increases visibility impairment because some particles, such as ammonium sulfate 
and ammonium nitrate, absorb water and become larger when relative humidity increases, 
resulting in increased visibility impairment (U.S. EPA, 2009). The eastern U.S. generally 
experiences greater visibility impairment due to higher concentrations of particulates and 
higher average humidity levels. Particulate sulfate is the dominant source of reduced visual air 
quality in the eastern U.S. (>50% of the particulate light extinction) and an important 
contributor to visibility impairment elsewhere in the country (>20% of particulate light 
extinction) (U.S. EPA, 2009). Particulate nitrate contributes to decreased visibility in California 
and the upper Midwest, particularly during the winter (U.S. EPA, 2009). In all regions, urban 
particulate concentrations are higher than those in the surrounding non-urban area, but 
                                                                                                                                                                           
the 24-hour PM2.5 light extinction indicator levels that are generally equivalent to levels of 20, 25, and 30 dv 
applied to a daily maximum daylight 4-hour PM2.5 light extinction indicator (U.S. EPA, 2011).

in Chapter 6 of this RIA. 
 10-3 
western urban areas show greater differences from the surrounding non-urban areas than do 
eastern urban areas (U.S. EPA, 2009). 
10.4 Baseline Modeling Projection Data (2020) 
EPA has proposed to use a calculated indicator of PM-related light extinction to 
determine whether an area is in attainment for the secondary PM2.5 NAAQS standard. The 
IMPROVE4 algorithm uses the estimated impact of each PM component species and relative 
humidity to calculate the amount of PM-related light extinction. In the equation, each PM 
component species is multiplied by a factor related to its impact on light extinction. Component 
species affected by the presence of water in the ambient air are also multiplied by a factor 
representing the relative humidity. These factors are summed to determine the total light 
extinction caused by PM. To calculate design values for this analysis, EPA is using a modified 
version of this algorithm, which is explained in more detail in Chapter 3 of this RIA. 
To estimate design values for this analysis, we apply the original IMPROVE algorithm to 
24-hour, speciated PM2.5 concentrations measured at 236 Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) 
monitors across the country and climatological mean relative humidity data to calculate the 
estimated light extinction in each location. The 207 counties with CSN monitors are identified in 
Figure 10-1. We then compare the calculated light extinction from a monitor to the standard 
level to determine whether the county where the monitor is located is in attainment (U.S. EPA, 
2011). 
Even before incorporating reductions to attain the current primary standard of 15 µg/m3 
annual and 35 µg/m3 24-hour (denoted 15/35), no monitors are expected to exceed a 
secondary standard level of 30 dv and only three monitors are expected to exceed a secondary 
standard level of 28 dv in 2020. Because all three of these monitors also exceed the 15/35 
primary standard,5 we would expect each would attain a secondary standard of 28 dv when 
controlled at the primary standard level. Further emission reductions to meet a more stringent 
primary standard would lead to additional improvement in visibility in all areas. Table 10-1 
                                                     
4The Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environment (IMPROVE) program was established in 1985 to aid 
in the creation of state and federal implementation plans for visibility in Class I areas as required in the 1977 
amendments to the CAA. 
5The monitors that are above 15/35 are monitor id numbers: 60658001 (located in Riverside, CA); 60290014 
(located in Kern, CA); and 60990005 (located in Stanislaus, CA). The projected 2020 base case design values for 
the primary standard for these monitors are 16.30/46.5 µg/m3, 14.18/44.0 µg/m3, and 10.85/37.0 µg/m3, 
respectively. The projected 2020 base case design values for the secondary standard for these monitors are: 29 
dv, 30 dv, and 29 dv, respectively. We believe that the emissions reductions needed to obtain the current 
primary standard levels of 15/35 will be enough to lower the projected 2020 secondary standard design values 
to 28 dv.

Of the 236 monitors for which visibility design values are available, 208 (88%) attain a 
secondary standard of 25 dv or better in 2020, prior to full attainment of the current primary 
standard. Figure 10-2 shows the counties that would exceed the secondary standards in this 
analysis. Visibility design values calculated from data for each monitor location included in this 
analysis can be found in Appendix 10-A.

10.5 Impacts of Attaining a Distinct Secondary Standard 
Based on the air quality analysis conducted for the primary PM2.5 standard, all 
monitored areas are estimated to be in attainment with a secondary standard level of either 30 
dv or 28 dv in 2020, assuming full attainment of the primary PM2.5 standard. For the two 
optional levels proposed for the secondary standard, no additional costs or benefits will be 
realized beyond those quantified for the primary PM2.5 standard in this RIA.6 
10.6 Limitations of Analysis 
Visibility design values for 2020 were calculated using the CMAQ modeling information 
and 2004-2006 ambient measurements. To determine the design values for meeting the 
current primary PM2.5 standard and proposed alternative primary standards, we used a 
                                                     
6 Based on the air quality modeling used in this analysis, EPA does not believe that any county that is in compliance 
with primary will violate secondary standard. However, different modeling trajectories could potentially lead to 
cases in which the secondary standard is binding. 
 10-6 
methodology, described in Chapter 3, to estimate the small emissions reductions needed from 
control measures to show attainment and to estimate the costs and benefits of attaining the 
proposed alternative primary standards. It is not possible to apply this methodology to the 
visibility design values.7 As a result, the only analysis available for the proposed alternative 
secondary standards in 2020 is prior to full attainment of the current primary standard. All 
monitors analyzed are projected to attain a secondary standard of 30 dv in the 2020 base case. 
Given the 24-hr design value reductions that were included in simulating attainment of 15/35 in 
the 2020 base case, it is likely that all monitors will also attain a secondary standard of 28 dv 
when they attain the current primary standards.8

7As described in Chapter 3, we apply a methodology of air quality ratios to estimate the emissions reductions 
needed to meet the current and proposed alternative levels for the primary standard. While this methodology 
can estimate how these emissions reductions will affect changes in the future-year annual design value and the 
corresponding response of the future-year 24-hr design value to changes in the annual design value, it is unable 
to estimate how each of the PM2.5 species will change with these emission reductions. Given that estimating 
changes in future-year visibility is dependent on the IMPROVE equation and how the PM2.5 species are 
projected to change in time, we are unable to estimate visibility design values for meeting the current and 
proposed alternative levels for the primary standard.  
8 The projected 2020 base case design values for the secondary standard for the following monitors with id 
numbers 60658001 (located in Riverside, CA), 60290014 (located in Kern, CA), and 60990005 (located in 
Stanislaus, CA) are 29 dv, 30 dv, and 29 dv, respectively. The emissions reductions selected for simulating 
attainment of 15/35 in the 2020 base case resulted in the following reductions in the 24-hr design values for 
these three monitors: 11.1 µg/m3, 21.9 µg/m3 and 5.3 µg/m3, respectively. Based on the trends presented in 
Wayland, 2012, we believe that these emissions reductions and 24-hr design value changes for simulating the 
current primary standard levels of 15/35 will be enough to lower the projected 2020 secondary standard design 
values for these three monitors to 28 dv or lower.

CHAPTER 11 
QUALITATIVE DISCUSSION OF EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS OF AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS 
11.1 Introduction 
Executive Order 13563 states that federal agencies should consider the effect of 
regulations on employment. According to the Executive Order, “our regulatory system must 
protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic growth, 
innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. It must be based on the best available science” 
(Executive Order 13563, 2011). Although a stand-alone analysis of employment impacts is not 
typically included in a standard cost-benefit analysis,1 employment impacts are currently of 
particular concern due to recent economic conditions reflecting relatively high levels of 
unemployment. This chapter is intended to provide context for considering the potential 
influence of environmental regulation on growth and job shifts in the U.S. economy. Section 
11.2 addresses the particular influence of this proposed rule on employment. Section 11.3 
presents a descriptive overview of the peer-reviewed literature relevant to evaluating the 
effect of air quality regulation on employment. Finally, in Section 11.4, we offer several 
conclusions. 
11.2 Influence of NAAQS Controls on Employment 
Peer-reviewed econometric studies that estimate the impact of air quality regulation on 
net overall employment and within the regulated sector converge on the finding that any net 
employment effects, whether positive or negative, have been small. This finding holds for even 
major nationwide environmental regulations. Therefore, given the overall small effect 
environmental regulations have been shown to have on net employment in the regulated 
sectors, we do not expect them to have a significant impact on the overall economy. 
Other factors affecting U.S. employment include cyclical, technological, demographic, 
and economic trends both in the United States and abroad. In this section, we focus on the 
studies most directly applicable to EPA analyses.  
Estimating specific employment impacts from a new NAAQS standard is particularly 
challenging for two reasons. First, the NAAQS is a target level of public health protection that 
individual areas have flexibility to meet in a variety of ways, and the primary regulatory activity 
and implementation occur at the state or local level. Under these circumstances, states and 
localities are given considerable flexibility in choosing which strategies to adopt to meet the 
                                                     
1 This is the case except to the extent that labor costs are part of total costs in a cost-benefit analysis. 
 11-2 
NAAQS target. State and local officials can consider employment impacts of various control 
strategies, as well as other factors, when designing their state implementation plans (SIPs). This 
makes it challenging to predict how specific sectors will be impacted and how those impacts 
vary across regions of the country. Analyses in the RIA are based on a particular NAAQS 
compliance scenario that reflects assumptions about control measures applied across all 
sectors and locations, specific control strategies adopted by the states and associated 
extrapolated costs. EPA believes this compliance scenario supports reasonably illustrative 
quantitative estimates of the potential overall economic effects of the revised NAAQS. 
However, EPA does not consider this illustrative, aggregate compliance scenario to be 
sufficiently certain and precise to support quantitative projections of outcomes in particular 
locations, sectors, or markets, including labor markets, in light of the scarcity of applicable 
studies that can be used to generate such estimates. Therefore, this RIA does not include 
quantitative projections of aggregate shifts in employment.  
 Second, we anticipate that national employment levels will be changing during the 
period that the NAAQS is being implemented, a period that may be greater than 10 years for 
some areas, following designations of nonattainment. Although current unemployment rates 
remain high relative to historical averages largely due to the sharp increase in unemployment 
that began in early 2008 (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012a), current 
data suggest unemployment rates have been declining in recent months (U.S. Department of 
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012b). Policies to meet the NAAQS in all areas will not go 
into effect for several years. By this time we anticipate the economy will have had a chance to 
recover toward higher employment levels that more closely approximate full employment. In 
addition, over a period of 10 years or longer, potentially significant changes in technology, 
growth and distribution of economic activities, and other key determinants of local and national 
labor market conditions further complicate projections of future employment and the potential 
incremental effect of regulatory programs. 
Although a quantitative assessment of employment consequences of today’s proposed 
revision to the national ambient PM standards remains beyond the reach of available data and 
modeling tools, EPA is in the process of supporting the development of tools and research that 
could assist in the future. In the interim, some insights on the potentially relevant 
consequences of revising ambient air pollution standards can be gained by considering 
currently available literature, including its limitations. In light of these challenges, Section 11.3 
focuses on qualitative insights from currently available peer-reviewed literature on the impact 
of air quality regulations in general. 
 11-3 
11.3 The Current State of Knowledge Based on the Peer-Reviewed Literature 
There is limited peer-reviewed econometric literature estimating employment effects of 
environmental regulations. We present an overview here, highlighting studies with particular 
relevance for NAAQS. Determining the direction of employment effects in the regulated 
industries is challenging because of competing effects. Complying with the new or more 
stringent regulation requires additional inputs, including labor, and may alter the relative 
proportions of labor and capital used by regulated firms in their production processes.  
When the economy is at full employment, an environmental regulation is unlikely to 
have a considerable impact on net employment in the long run. Instead, labor would primarily 
be reallocated from one productive use to another (e.g., from producing electricity or steel to 
producing pollution abatement equipment). Theory supports the argument that, in the case of 
full employment, the net national employment effects from environmental regulation are likely 
to be small and transitory (e.g., as workers move from one job to another). There is reason to 
believe that when the economy is operating at less than full employment environmental 
regulation could result in a short-run net increase in employment.2 Several empirical studies 
suggest that net employment impacts may be positive but small even in the regulated sector. 
Taken together, the peer- reviewed literature does not contain evidence that environmental 
regulation would have a notable impact on net employment across the whole economy. 
This discussion focuses on both short- and long-term employment impacts in the 
regulated industries, as well as on the environmental protection sector for construction of 
needed pollution control equipment prior to the compliance date of the regulation. EPA is 
committed to using the best available science and the relevant theoretical and empirical 
literature in this assessment and is pursuing efforts to support new research in this field. 
11.3.1 Immediate and Short-Run Employment Impacts 
Environmental regulations are typically phased in to allow firms time to invest in the 
necessary technology and process changes to meet the new standards. Whatever effects a 
regulation will have on employment in the regulated sector will typically occur only after a 
regulation takes effect, or in the long term, as new technologies are introduced. However, the 
environmental protection sector (pollution control equipment) often sees immediate 
employment effects. When a regulation is promulgated, the first response of industry is to 
order pollution control equipment and services to comply with the regulation when it becomes 
effective. This can produce a short-term increase in labor demand for specialized workers 
                                                     
2 See Schmalansee and Stavin (2011) 
 11-4 
within the environmental protection sector related to design, construction, installation and 
operation of the new pollution control equipment required by the regulation. (see Schmalansee 
and Stavins, 2011; Bezdek, Wendling, and Diperna, 2008).  
As the NAAQS are implemented, it is possible that the regulated sector will experience 
short-run changes in employment. Because it is the states’ responsibility to design their state 
implementation plans (SIPs) over the next few years, we cannot assess the short-term effects of 
those SIPs on the regulated sector with sufficient precision to quantify the resulting incremental 
effects on employment. However, as previously noted, even in a full employment case, there 
may be transitory effects as workers change jobs. Some workers may need to retrain or 
relocate in anticipation of the new requirements or require time to search for new jobs, while 
shortages in some sectors or regions could bid up wages to attract workers. 
It is important to recognize that these adjustment costs can entail local labor 
disruptions, and, although the net change in the national workforce might be small, gross 
reductions in employment can still have negative impacts on individuals and communities. The 
peer-reviewed literature that is currently available is focused on medium- and long-term 
employment impacts and does not offer much insight into the short-term balance between 
increased employment in the environmental protection sector and possible decreased 
employment in some regulated sectors. 
11.3.2 Long-Term Employment Impacts on the Regulated Industry  
Determining the direction of net employment effects in regulated industries is 
challenging because of competing effects. Morgenstern, Pizer, and Shih (2002) demonstrate 
that environmental regulations can be understood as requiring regulated firms to add a new 
output (environmental quality) to their product mix. Although legally compelled to produce this 
new output, regulated firms have to finance this additional production input with the proceeds 
of sales of their other (market) products. The current literature on employment impacts of air 
quality regulations can be disaggregated into two types of approaches or models: 1) structural 
and 2) reduced-form models. Two papers that present a formal structural model of the 
underlying profit maximizing/cost minimizing problem of the firm are Berman and Bui (2001) 
and Morgenstern, Pizer, and Shih (2002). Berman and Bui (2001) developed an innovative 
approach to estimating the effect of environmental regulations designed to meet a NAAQS 
(e.g., ozone and NOX) requirement in California on employment. Berman and Bui’s model 
allows environmental regulation to operate via two separate mechanisms: 1) the output 
elasticity of labor demand and 2) the effect of pollution abatement activities on demand for 
 11-5 
variable factors, combined with the marginal rates of technical substitution between 
abatement activity and variable factors, including labor. Berman and Bui demonstrate, using 
economic theory, that the overall net effect of environmental regulation on employment, 
predicted by this model, is ambiguous. Neoclassical economic theory predicts that the output 
effect is, in most cases, negative, while the direction of the second, composite effect is 
indeterminate making the overall net effect ambiguous.  
Morgenstern, Pizer, and Shih (2002) developed a similar structural model to Berman and 
Bui’s (2001) model. Their model focuses on three mechanisms whereby environmental 
regulation may impact employment in regulated industries. First, is the demand, or output, 
effect, where new compliance costs increase the cost of production, raising prices and thereby 
reducing consumer demand, which, in turn, reduces labor demand. Second, is the cost effect, 
which increases the demand for inputs, including labor, as more inputs are now required to 
produce the same amount of output. Finally, the factor-shift effect notes how regulated firms’ 
production technologies may be more or less labor intensive after complying with the 
regulation (i.e., more/less labor is required relative to capital per dollar of output), implying an 
ambiguous overall net effect on labor demand. Conceptually, this theoretical approach, which is 
very similar to Berman and Bui’s approach, could be applied to NAAQS. However, Morgenstern 
et al.’s empirical approach uses pollution abatement expenditures for only four highly 
polluting/regulated sectors (pulp and paper, plastics, steel, and petroleum refining) to estimate 
effects on net employment; therefore, their empirical results are not directly applicable to the 
full range of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries affected by NAAQS. Regardless, 
their work represents one of the most rigorous attempts to quantify the net employment 
impacts of regulation on the regulated sector. Morgenstern et al. conclude from their empirical 
results that increased pollution abatement expenditures generally have not caused a significant 
change in net employment in those four sectors. More specifically, their results show that, on 
average across the industries studied, each additional $1 million ($1987) spent on pollution 
abatement results in a (statistically insignificant) net increase of 1.5 jobs.  
Berman and Bui (2001) use their model to empirically examine how an increase in local 
air quality regulation that reduces NOX emissions as a precursor to ozone and PM10 affects 
manufacturing employment in the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), 
which incorporates Los Angeles and its suburbs. During the time frame of their study, 1979 to 
1992, the SCAQMD enacted some of the country’s most stringent air quality regulations. Using 
SCAQMD’s local air quality regulations, which are more stringent than federal and state 
regulations, Berman and Bui identify the effect of environmental regulations on net 
 11-6 
employment in the regulated sectors.3 They compare changes in employment in affected plants 
to those in other plants in the same industries but in regions not subject to the local 
regulations. The authors find that “while regulations do impose large costs, they have a limited 
effect on employment”—even when exit and dissuaded entry effects are considered (Berman 
and Bui, 2001, p. 269). Their conclusion is that local air quality regulation “probably increased 
labor demand slightly” but that “the employment effects of both compliance and increased 
stringency are fairly precisely estimated zeros [emphasis added], even when exit and dissuaded 
entry effects are included” (Berman and Bui, 2001, p. 269). In their view, the limited effects 
likely arose because 1) the regulations applied disproportionately to capital-intensive plants 
with relatively little employment, 2) the plants sold to local markets where competitors were 
subject to the same regulations (so that sales were relatively unaffected), and 3) abatement 
inputs served as complements to employment. Although Berman and Bui focus on more sectors 
than Morgenstern et al. and focus specifically on air regulations, the study only examined 
impacts in Southern California and impacts may differ in other nonattainment areas. 
Other studies, including Henderson (1996), Becker and Henderson (2000), Greenstone 
(2002), and List et al. (2003), have taken a reduced-form approach to ask a related but quite 
different question regarding the impact of environmental regulation on economic activity. All of 
these studies examined the effect of attainment status, with respect to NAAQS, on various 
forms of economic activity (e.g., employment growth, plant openings and closings, investment). 
Polluting plants already located in and new polluting plants wanting to open in nonattainment 
counties (counties not in compliance with one or more NAAQSs) are likely to face more 
stringent air pollution regulations to help bring them into compliance. Thus, the stringency in 
environmental regulations may vary spatially, which may affect the spatial distribution of 
economic activity but not necessarily the overall level of economic activity. These studies find 
limited evidence that employment grows more slowly, investment is lower, or fewer new 
polluting plants open in nonattainment areas relative to attainment areas. However, this 
evidence does not mean that there is less aggregate economic activity as a result of 
environmental regulation nor does it provide evidence regarding absolute growth rates; it 
simply suggests that the relative growth rate of some sectors may differ between attainment 
and nonattainment areas. The approach used in all of these other studies is not capable of 
estimating net employment effects as would be necessary for a national rulemaking, only 
certain aspects of gross labor flows in selected areas. 
                                                     
3 Note, like Morgenstern, Pizer, and Shih (2002), this study does not estimate the number of jobs created in the 
environmental protection sector.

11.4 Conclusion 
The long-term effects of a regulation on the environmental protection sector (which 
provides goods and services to the regulated sector) are difficult to assess. Employment in the 
industry supplying pollution control equipment is likely to increase with the increased demand 
from the regulated industry for the equipment.4 According to U.S. Department of Commerce 
(2010) data, by 2008, there were 119,000 environmental technology (ET) firms generating 
approximately $300 billion in revenues domestically (2% of national gross domestic product 
[GDP]), producing $43.8 billion in exports (2% of total exports), and supporting nearly 1.7 
million jobs (0.93% of total jobs). Air pollution control accounted for 18% of the domestic ET 
market and 16% of exports. Small and medium-size companies represent 99% of private ET 
firms, producing 20% of total revenue. The remaining 1% of companies are large companies 
supplying 49% of ET revenue (OEEI, 2010).5 
As described above, deriving estimates of how regulations will impact economy-wide 
net employment is a difficult task, especially in the case of setting a new NAAQS, given that 
economic theory predicts that the net effect of an environmental regulation on regulated 
sectors and the overall economy is indeterminate (not necessarily positive or negative). Peer-
reviewed econometric studies that use a structural approach, applicable to overall net effects in 
the regulated sectors, converge on the finding that any net employment effects of 
environmental regulation in general, whether positive or negative, have been small and have 
not affected employment in the economy in a significant way.
