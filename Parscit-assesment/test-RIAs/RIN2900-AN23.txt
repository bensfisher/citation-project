3535 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
to announce the location and date of the 
public meeting. 73 FR 76296. In this 
notice, we announce that public 
meeting to receive comments on this 
proposed rule. 
In the NPRM, we proposed to expand 
the applicability of Notice of Arrival 
and Departure (NOAD) and Automatic 
Identification System (AIS) 
requirements to more commercial 
vessels, modify NOAD reporting 
requirements, establish a mandatory 
method for electronic data submission 
and establish a separate requirement for 
certain vessels to submit notices of 
departure. The proposed rulemaking 
would also clarify existing AIS 
requirements and extend the 
applicability of AIS requirements 
beyond Vessel Traffic Service areas to 
all U.S. navigable waters. 
You may view the NPRM in our 
online docket, in addition to supporting 
documents prepared by the Coast Guard

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public 
Law 104–262, the Veterans’ Health Care 
Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, required 
VA to establish a national enrollment 
system to manage the delivery of 
inpatient hospital care and outpatient 
medical care, within available 
appropriated resources. It directed that 
the enrollment system be managed in 
such a way as ‘‘to ensure that the 
provision of care to enrollees is timely 
and acceptable in quality,’’ and 
authorized such subprioritization of the 
statutory enrollment categories ‘‘as the 
Secretary determines necessary.’’ The 
law also provided that starting October 
1, 1998, most veterans had to enroll in 
the VA health care system as a 
condition for receiving VA hospital and 
outpatient care. 
In a document published in the 
Federal Register on January 17, 2003 
(68 FR 2670), VA published an interim 
final rule that amended 38 CFR 17.36 to 
add two new subpriorities to both 
enrollment priority categories 7 and 8, 
for a total of four subpriorities in each 
category. It also announced that

3536 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 12 / Wednesday, January 21, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
beginning January 17, 2003, VA would 
enroll all priority categories of veterans 
except that those veterans in priority 
category 8 who were not in an enrolled 
status on January 17, 2003, or who 
requested disenrollment after that date, 
would not be eligible to be enrolled. The 
veterans in this priority category are 
those whose incomes exceed certain 
income limits and who do not qualify 
for enrollment in another priority 
category. Since then, VA has not 
enrolled veterans in priority category 8 
unless they had been enrolled in 
another priority category and no longer 
qualified for enrollment in that category. 
This proposed rule would establish 
additional subpriorities within 
enrollment priority category 8 and 
would provide that beginning on the 
effective date of the rule, VA would 
enroll priority category 8 veterans 
whose income exceeds the current 
means test and geographic means test 
income thresholds by 10 percent or less. 
These veterans would continue 
enrollment in these subpriority groups 
(even if their income exceeds the 
current tests by more than 10 percent) 
unless they become eligible for 
enrollment in a higher category or 
subpriority; a request for disenrollment 
is made; or a decision is made to 
disenroll their particular subpriority or 
category. This proposed rule would also 
amend the medical regulations by 
making a nonsubstantive change to 
reflect an alternative method to submit 
VA’s Application for Health Care 
Benefits (VA Form 10–10EZ). 
Projections for Increasing Enrollment of 
Priority Category 8 Veterans Whose 
Income Exceeds the Current VA Means 
Test and Geographic Means Test 
Income Thresholds by 10 Percent or 
Less 
An existing regulation (38 CFR 
17.36(c)) requires that the Secretary 
determine which categories of veterans 
are eligible to be enrolled and that the 
Secretary notify eligible enrollees of the 
determination by announcing it in the 
Federal Register. In making that 
determination, the Secretary must 
consider an array of factors including 
economic information such as available 
resources, projections of demand for 
enrollment, and the length of waiting 
times for appointments for care. 
The actual number of total enrollees 
who were enrolled at any time in 2003 
was 7,120,347. The corresponding 
number in 2008 was 7,802,382. The 
increase in the veterans enrolled in the 
VA health care system between 2003 
and 2008 is, therefore, 682,035. 
The 2009 Appropriations Act 
provided funding in VA’s health care 
appropriation to increase priority 
category 8 enrollment. The Veterans 
Health Administration’s (VHA) total FY 
2009 medical care appropriation is 
$40.434 billion. This is supplemented 
by an additional $3.717 billion from 
collections for copayments, third-party 
reimbursements for services, other 
revenue, and carry-over funds. The sum 
of these resources is $44.151 billion. 
The following table shows the projected 
enrollment for FY 2009 together with 
the projected expenditures that would 
be needed to provide the medical 
benefits package to enrollees under VA’s 
current enrollment policy:

1 This table does not include projections regarding the impact of the proposed regulatory change. 
The following table shows the 
projected enrollment and expenditures 
for FY 2009 if the expanded enrollment 
as proposed in this document is 
implemented. The projections are based 
on reopening enrollment for Priority 8 
veterans whose income exceeds the 
current VA means test (VMT) and 
geographic means test (GMT) income 
thresholds by 10 percent or less. The 
means tests are currently based on 
Calendar Year (CY) 2007 income. 
Priority 8 veterans eligible to enroll 
under VMT/GMT+10 percent are 
assumed to enroll at higher rates than 
the average historical rates evidenced in 
the current Priority 8 enrollee 
population. Experience shows that 
veterans in the lower income ranges for 
Priority 8 veterans are more likely to 
enroll. The FY 2009 enrollment 
projections also reflect an expected 
surge in enrollment when the 
suspension is lifted and veterans who 
have not been able to enroll take 
advantage of this opportunity. The 
higher enrollment rates for VMT/ 
GMT+10 percent veterans were 
increased by 17.5 percent for FY 2009 
to reflect the expected surge. In absence 
of any data to support a different 
assumption, the projections for VMT/ 
GMT+10 percent assume the new 
Priority 8 enrollees will have the same 
reliance and morbidity as current 
Priority 8 enrollees.

1 FY 2009 Projections in this table include projections under Current Enrollment Policy plus the impact of the proposed regulatory change. 
The previous tables display 2009 
projections based on the 2008 Enrollee 
Health Care Projection Model, VA’s 
health care actuarial model. The VA 
Enrollee Health Care Projection Model 
(the ‘‘Model’’) supports the VHA health 
care budget, projects the number of 
veterans who will be enrolled, the 
health care services they will choose to 
get from VHA, and the expenditures 
associated with that utilization for 20 
years. The utilization and expenditure 
projections are developed based on 
where enrollees live to support 
population-based long-term planning. 
Base year unit costs are based on FY 
2007 unit cost data from VA’s financial 
accounting system—Decision Support 
System (DSS). The base year unit costs 
are trended forward using health care 
cost trends and adjusted for the impact 
of enrollee aging and changes in VA’s 
level of health care management over 
the 20-year projection period. The 
expenditures projected by this model 
reflected in these tables exclude services 
such as Long Term Care, Readjustment 
Counseling, Spina Bifida, Foreign 
Medical Programs, Non-Veteran Medical 
Care, and the Civilian Health and 
Medical Program of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). Total 
expenditures for medical care not 
included in the model are projected to 
be $6.959 billion in FY 2009. The 
following tables show VA’s projections 
for enrollment through 2019 under the 
current enrollment policy and how the 
proposed expansion of enrollment in 
priority category 8 would affect that.

1 The enrollment projections begin with VetPop data, 20-year projections of the veteran population that are produced by the VA Office of the 
Actuary. At this time, VetPop does not provide veteran projections by Priority Levels so VetPop data is combined with other data sources to cre-
ate VetPop Proxy data, which provides veteran projections by Priority Level. 
Historical enrollment data are analyzed to develop enrollment rates by Priority Level, Age Band, Geographic Area, and Special Conflict Status. 
The enrollment rates are then applied to the enrollment pool, which is VetPop minus the enrolled veteran population, to determine projected en-
rollees for any given year. 
Mortality rates specific to age, gender, and Priority Level are then applied to the enrollee population, and the enrollment and potential enrollee 
pool are aged one year at the end of each fiscal year to arrive at the projections for the beginning of the next fiscal year. The process of apply-
ing enrollment and mortality rates then repeats for the duration of the enrollment projections. 
The VA Enrollee Health Care [Projection Model (EHCPM) also accounts for geographic migration and enrollees who transition between enroll-
ment Priority Levels. 
2 FY 2009–2019 Projections under Current Enrollment Policy do not include the impact of the proposed regulatory change.

2 FY 2009–2019 Projections in this column include projections under Current Enrollment Policy plus the impact of the proposed regulatory 
change. 
As can be seen from the FY 2009 
medical care appropriation and the 
tables above, VA projects that available 
resources to expand enrollment will be 
adequate to support the proposed 
expansion of enrollment of Priority 8 
veterans. 
Previous Interim Final Rules and 
Responses to Comments 
This document includes proposed 
changes in the provisions adopted in the 
interim final rule published in the 
Federal Register on January 17, 2003 
(68 FR 2669, RIN 2900–AL51). We 
received five comments on that interim 
final rule. All of the commenters 
expressed disagreement with VA’s 
decision to suspend enrollment of 
additional veterans in priority category 
8. Each of the commenters generally 
expressed the view that VA should 
provide care to all veterans seeking care 
because they had served their country. 
Thoughtful consideration was given to 
the comments received. However, as 
discussed in the preamble 
accompanying publication of the 
interim final rule, VA is required to 
assess available resources and 
determine the number of veterans it is 
able to enroll to ensure that medical 
services provided are both timely and 
acceptable in quality. An enrollment 
system is necessary because the 
provision of VA health care is 
discretionary and can be provided only 
to the extent that appropriated resources 
are available for that purpose. The 
enrollment decision made in January 
2003 was based on available resources, 
and the comments do not suggest that 
VA’s assessment of available resources 
was incorrect. 
Unfunded Mandates 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
requires, at 2 U.S.C. 1532, that agencies 
prepare an assessment of anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule that may result in the expenditure 
by State, local, and tribal governments, 
in the aggregate, or by the private sector 
of $100 million or more in any given 
year. This rule would have no such 
effect on State, local, or tribal 
governments. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
This proposed rule contains no 
provisions constituting a new collection 
of information, but would change, 
merely by adding an option of a new 
method of submission, a collection of 
information that has been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3521). OMB assigns a 
control number for each collection of 
information it approves. VA may not 
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. 
The information collection provisions 
affected by this proposed rule have been 
approved under control number 2900– 
0091. 
Executive Order 12866 and 
Congressional Review Act 
This is an economically significant 
regulatory action under Executive Order 
12866 and constitutes a major rule 
under the Congressional Review Act. 
Executive Order 12866 directs 
agencies to assess all costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
when regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health 
and safety, and other advantages; 
distributive impacts; and equity). 
Executive Order 12866 classifies a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ requiring 
review by OMB as any regulatory action 
that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more, or 
adversely affect in a material way the 
economy, a sector of the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or 
State, local, or tribal governments or 
communities; (2) create a serious 
inconsistency or interfere with an action 
taken or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
entitlement recipients; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in the Executive 
Order. 
VA has examined the economic, 
interagency, budgetary, legal, and policy 
implications of this proposed rule and 
has concluded that it is an economically 
significant regulatory action under 
Executive Order 12866 because it is 
likely to result in a rule that may have 
an annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more and may raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in the Executive 
Order. This proposed rule is also a 
major rule under the Congressional 
Review Act because it is likely to result 
in an annual effect on the economy of 
$100 million or more. 
VA has attempted to follow OMB 
circular A–4 to the extent feasible in 
this analysis. The circular first calls for 
a discussion of the need for the 
regulation. The Consolidated Security, 
Disaster Assistance, and Continuing 
Appropriations Act, 2009 (Pub. L. 110– 
329) was enacted on September 30, 
2008. The accompanying report 
language stated that funding was 
included to reopen priority category 8 
enrollment. The preamble above 
discusses the need for the regulation in 
more detail. There are not any 
alternatives to publishing this proposed 
rule that will accomplish the stated 
provisions in the report language of the 
Consolidated Security, Disaster 
Assistance, and Continuing 
Appropriations Act, 2009 (Pub. L. 110– 
329). 
VA uses the Enrollee Health Care 
Projection Model (Model), a health care 
actuarial model, to project veteran 
demand for VA health care. To project 
enrollment and expenditures under this 
proposed regulatory change, VA first 
identified the number of non-enrolled 
veterans whose income exceeds the 
current VA means test and geographic 
means test income thresholds by 10

percent or less. VA then projected the 
number of those veterans who would 
enroll based on historical priority 
category 8 enrollment rates. The 
projected health care service utilization 
for these new enrollees was based on 
the historical morbidity and reliance 
rates of the current priority category 8 
enrollee population. The projected 
expenditures represent the cost to 
provide the projected health care 
services to these new enrollees. 
Using the 2008 Model, VA projects 
that this proposed regulatory change 
would result in an additional 258,705 
priority category 8 enrollees in FY 2009. 
The projected increase in total health 
care service expenditures associated 
with this new enrollment is $485 
million in FY 2009. The revenues 
generated by the first- and third-party 
collections are projected to be $121 
million,1 resulting in a $364 million 
growth in net health service 
expenditures for FY 2009, and $375 
million was provided in the 
Consolidated Security, Disaster 
Assistance, and Continuing 
Appropriations Act, 2009 (Pub. L. 110– 
329). VA’s expenditures related to this 
proposed regulatory change are 
projected to be approximately $2.931 
billion for five years.2 These 
expenditures exclude services such as 
Long Term Care, Readjustment 
Counseling, Spina Bifida, Foreign 
Medical Programs, Non-Veteran Medical 
Care and CHAMPVA. 
1 The first party collections are based on 
the projected health care service utilization 
of the new Priority 8 enrollees. In the base 
year (2007), we applied the appropriate co- 
payment to the projected services. We then 
balanced the resulting co-payment revenue 
projections to the actual collections for 2007 
for four categories (inpatient, outpatient, 
residential rehabilitation, and pharmacy) 
and by Veterans Integrated Service Network 
(VISN) to account for the amount actually 
collected. The resulting first-party revenue 
per service developed for 2007 is applied to 
the projected services in future years to 
project the first-party revenue associated with 
health care utilization of the new Priority 8 
enrollees. Further, the pharmacy co-payment 
is increased over time based on the legislated 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) schedule. 
To develop the third-party collections, we 
calculated the percentage of third-party 
revenue collected in 2007 as a percent of 
2007 expenditures by VISN, priority level, 
and two age bands (under and over age 65). 
We then applied these percentages to the 
projected expenditures for the new Priority 8 
enrollees in future years. For 2010, the 
percentages were increased to reflect VHA’s 
initiatives to increase third-party revenue 
collections.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Secretary hereby certifies that the 
adoption of this proposed rule would 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
as they are defined in the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601–612. This 
rule would not directly affect any small 
entities. Only individuals could be 
directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 605(b), this rule is exempt from 
the initial and final regulatory flexibility 
analysis requirements of sections 603 
and 604.

James B. Peake, 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
For the reasons set out in the 
preamble, VA proposes to amend 38 
CFR part 17 as set forth below: 
PART 17—MEDICAL 
1. The authority citation for part 17 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 1721, and as 
stated in specific sections. 
2. Amend § 17.36 by revising 
paragraphs (b)(8), (c)(1), (c)(2), and 
(d)(1) and the authority citation to read 
as follows: 
§ 17.36 Enrollment—provision of hospital 
and outpatient care to veterans.

(8) Veterans not included in priority 
category 4 or 7, who are eligible for care 
only if they agree to pay to the United 
States the applicable copayment 
determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 
1710(g). This category is further 
prioritized into the following 
subcategories: 
(i) Noncompensable zero percent 
service-connected veterans who were in 
an enrolled status on January 17, 2003, 
or who are moved from a higher priority 
category or subcategory due to no longer 
being eligible for inclusion in such 
priority category or subcategory and 
who subsequently do not request 
disenrollment; 
(ii) Noncompensable zero percent 
service-connected veterans not included 
in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section and 
whose income is not greater than ten 
percent more than the income that

would permit their enrollment in 
priority category 5 or priority category 7, 
whichever is higher; 
(iii) Nonservice-connected veterans 
who were in an enrolled status on 
January 17, 2003, or who are moved 
from a higher priority category or 
subcategory due to no longer being 
eligible for inclusion in such priority 
category or subcategory and who 
subsequently do not request 
disenrollment; 
(iv) Nonservice-connected veterans 
not included in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of 
this section and whose income is not 
greater than ten percent more than the 
income that would permit their 
enrollment in priority category 5 or 
priority category 7, whichever is higher; 
(v) Noncompensable zero percent 
service-connected veterans not included 
in paragraph (b)(8)(i) or paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii) of this section; and 
(vi) Nonservice-connected veterans 
not included in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) or 
paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section. 
(c) * * * 
(1) It is anticipated that each year the 
Secretary will consider whether to 
change the categories and subcategories 
of veterans eligible to be enrolled. The 
Secretary at any time may revise the 
categories or subcategories of veterans 
eligible to be enrolled by amending 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The 
preamble to a Federal Register 
document announcing which priority 
categories and subcategories are eligible 
to be enrolled must specify the 
projected number of fiscal year 
applicants for enrollment in each 
priority category, projected healthcare 
utilization and expenditures for 
veterans in each priority category, 
appropriated funds and other revenue 
projected to be available for fiscal year 
enrollees, and projected total 
expenditures for enrollees by priority 
category. The determination should 
include consideration of relevant 
internal and external factors, e.g., 
economic changes, changes in medical 
practices, and waiting times to obtain an 
appointment for care. Consistent with 
these criteria, the Secretary will 
determine which categories of veterans 
are eligible to be enrolled based on the 
order of priority specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section. 
(2) Unless changed by a rulemaking 
document in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, VA will enroll the 
priority categories of veterans set forth 
in § 17.36(b) beginning [effective date of 
regulation], except that those veterans in 
subcategories (v) and (vi) of priority 
category 8 are not eligible to be enrolled. 
(d) * * * 
(1) Application for enrollment. A 
veteran may apply to be enrolled in the 
VA healthcare system at any time. A 
veteran who wishes to be enrolled must 
apply by submitting a VA Form 10– 
10EZ to a VA medical facility or via an 
online submission at https:// 
www.1010ez.med.va.gov/sec/vha/ 
1010ez/.
